Paul Krugman, recipient of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Eco-
nomic Sciences, is Professor of Economics at Princeton University, where he 
regularly teaches the principles course. He received his BA from Yale and his 
PhD from MIT. Prior to his current position, he taught at Yale, Stanford, and 
MIT. He also spent a year on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers in 
1982–1983. His research is mainly in the area of international trade, where he 
is one of the founders of the “new trade theory,” which focuses on increasing 
returns and imperfect competition. He also works in international finance, 
with a concentration in currency crises. In 1991, Krugman received the 
American Economic Association’s John Bates Clark medal. In addition to his 
teaching and academic research, Krugman writes extensively for nontechnical 
audiences. He is a regular op-ed columnist for the New York Times. His latest 
trade books, both best-sellers, include The Return of Depression Economics and 
the Crisis of 2008, a history of recent economic troubles and their implications 
for economic policy, and The Conscience of a Liberal, a study of the political 
economy of economic inequality and its relationship with political polariza-
tion from the Gilded Age to the present. His earlier books, Peddling Prosperity 
and The Age of Diminished Expectations, have become modern classics.
Robin Wells was a Lecturer and Researcher in Economics at Prince-
ton University. She received her BA from the University of Chicago and her 
PhD from the University of California at Berkeley; she then did postdoctoral 
work at MIT. She has taught at the University of Michigan, the University of 
Southampton (United Kingdom), Stanford, and MIT. The subject of her teach-
ing and research is the theory of organizations and incentives.

FROM PAUL AND ROBIN
More than a decade ago, when we began writing the 
first edition of this textbook, we had many small ideas: 
particular aspects of economics that we believed weren’t 
covered the right way in existing textbooks. But we also 
had one big idea: the belief that an economics textbook 
could and should be built around narratives, that it 
should never lose sight of the fact that economics is, in 
the end, a set of stories about what people do.
Many of the stories economists tell take the form of 
models—for whatever else they are, economic models are 
stories about how the world works. But we believed that 
students’ understanding of and appreciation for models 
would be greatly enhanced if they were presented, as 
much as possible, in the context of stories about the real 
world, stories that both illustrate economic concepts and 
touch on the concerns we all face as individuals living in 
a world shaped by economic forces. Those stories have 
been integrated into every edition, including this one, 
which contains more stories than ever before. Once again, 
you’ll find them in the openers, in boxed features like 
Economics in Action, For Inquiring Minds, and Global 
Comparisons, but now in our new Business Cases as well.
We have been gratified by the reception this storytell-
ing approach has received, but we have also heard from 
users who urged us to expand the range of our stories 
to reach an even broader audience. In this edition of 
Microeconomics we have tried to expand the book’s 
appeal with some carefully selected changes.
As in the previous edition, we’ve made extensive changes 
and updates in coverage to reflect current events—events 
that have come thick and fast in a turbulent, troubled 
world economy, which is affecting the lives and prospects 
of students everywhere. Currency is very important to us. 
We have also expanded our coverage of business issues, 
both because business experience is a key source of eco-
nomic lessons and because most students will eventually 
find themselves working in the business world. We are 
especially pleased with how the new Business Cases have 
turned out and how they augment the overall number and 
richness of our stories. And we’ve made a major effort to 
streamline and simplify in places where our zeal to get it 
right ran ahead of our commitment to keep it clear.
We remain extremely fortunate in our reviewers, who 
have put in an immense amount of work helping us 
to make this book even better. And we are also deeply 
thankful to all the users who have given us feedback, 
telling us what works and, even more important, what 
doesn’t. (We also received useful comments from those 
who chose not to use our book and explained why!)
Many things have changed since the second edition 
of this book. As you’ll see, there’s a great deal of new 
material, and there are some significant changes (and, 
we hope, improvements) in pedagogy. But we’ve tried to 
keep the spirit the same. This is a book about economics 
as the study of what people do and how they interact, a 
study very much informed by real-world experience.
The Third Edition: What’s New
Although the second edition was a resounding success, 
further establishing Microeconomics as one of the best-
selling microeconomics textbooks, we learn with each 
new edition that there is always room for improvement. 
So, for the third edition, we undertook a revision with 
three goals in mind: to expand the book’s appeal to busi-
ness students, to be as current and cutting edge as pos-
sible in terms of topics covered and examples included, 
and to make the book more accessible. We hope that the 
following revisions lead to a more successful teaching 
experience for you.
New Business Case Studies
Now, more than ever, students entering the business 
community need a strong understanding of economic 
principles and their applications to business decisions. 
To meet this demand, every chapter now concludes with 
a real-world Business Case, showing how the economic 
issues discussed in the chapter play out in the world of 
entrepreneurs and bottom lines.
The cases range from the story of the trading firm Li 
& Fung, which is in the business of making money from 
comparative advantage, to a look at how apps like TheFind 
are making the retail market for electronics much more 
competitive, to an examination of how lean production 
techniques at Boeing and Toyota have impacted compara-
tive advantage in the airline and auto industries. The cases 
provide insight into business decision making in both 
American and international companies and at recogniz-
able firms like Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Amazon.com, 
and Priceline. Lesser-known firms are also used to 
illustrate economic concepts behind the supply costs of 
labor during seasonal work (Kiva Systems and the debate 
on human versus robotic order fulfillment), the role of 
incentives in the preservation of endangered species 
(Mauricedale Game Ranch), and the positive externalities 
of economic geography during the digital boom (Silicon 
Valley in California and Route 128 outside Boston).
Each case is followed by critical thinking questions 
that prompt students to apply the economics they 
learned in the chapter to the real-life business situa-
tions. A full list of the Business Cases can be found on 
the inside front cover of this book.
“Stories are good for us, whether we hear them, read them, write 
them, or simply imagine them. But stories that we read are 
particularly good for us. In fact I believe they are essential.”
Frank Smith, Reading: FAQ
PREFACE
xvi

New Coverage of Behavioral Economics
We have added a completely new section on behav-
ioral economics to Chapter 9, “Decision Making by 
Individuals and Firms,” because more and more princi-
ples instructors are including this groundbreaking per-
spective on “irrational” decision making in their courses. 
Originating in the research of Amos Tversky and Nobel 
laureate Daniel Kahneman, and further developed by a 
new generation of economists, this exciting subdiscipline 
probes multiple fallacies of the human mind. 
Our coverage in the third edition includes such top-
ics as how fairness intercedes in decision making, the 
effect of decisions made under risk and uncertainty, 
misperceptions of opportunity costs, and the dangers of 
overconfidence. We firmly believe that by learning how 
people make persistently irrational choices, students gain 
a deeper understanding of what constitutes rational eco-
nomic decision making.
An Emphasis on Currency
The third edition is updated to remain the most current 
textbook on the market in its data, examples, and the 
opening stories—a currency that drives student interest 
in each chapter.
Economics in Action: A Richer Story to Be Told 
Students and instructors alike have always championed 
Microeconomics for its applications of economic prin-
ciples, especially our Economics in Action feature. In the 
third edition, we have revised or replaced a significant 
number of Economics in Action applications in every 
single chapter. We believe this provides the richness of 
content that drives student and instructor interest. All 
Economics in Action features are listed on the inside cover.
Opening Stories We have always taken great care 
to ensure that each chapter’s opening story illustrates 
the key concepts of that chapter in a compelling and 
accessible way. To continue to do so, almost every story 
in the third edition was updated and nearly a third 
were replaced in an effort to bridge the gap between 
economic concepts and student interest in the world 
around them. New openers include the story of the 
Embrear Dreamliner and its genesis in the wind tun-
nels that the Wright brothers built at Kitty Hawk; the 
story behind the high price of blue jeans as cotton 
supply fell after natural disasters struck key produc-
ers; and the story of Ashley Hildreth, a class of 2008 
journalism major at the University of Oregon, as it 
reflects the decisions college graduates must make in a 
depressed economy.
Coverage of Public Policy The new edition continues 
to offer a significant examination of real-world policy 
that helps students see how the nation engages in public 
policy. We’ve included up-to-date coverage of health care 
reform and the rise in income equality in Chapter 18, 
“The Economics of the Welfare State,” and much more.
A More Accessible and Visual 
Presentation
Streamlined Chapters Because less is often more, 
we’ve streamlined the exposition in a number of places 
where our desire for thoroughness got a little ahead of 
our pedagogy. The chapters on oligopoly and externali-
ties, in particular, are now shorter and smoother in this 
edition.
A More Visual Exposition The research tells us 
that students read more online, in shorter bursts, and 
respond better to visual representations of information 
than ever before. In the third edition, we’ve worked 
hard to present information in the format that best 
teaches students.
We’ve shortened our paragraphs for easier reading 
and included numbered and bulleted lists whenever 
content would allow. You will find helpful new sum-
mary tables in this edition. And, most helpful, are the 
new visual displays in the book, including the dynamic 
representations of the factors that shift demand (p. 75) 
and the factors that shift supply (p. 82), among others.
Advantages of This Book
Our basic approach to textbook writing remains 
unchanged:
 • Chapters build intuition through realistic exam-
ples. In every chapter, we use real-world examples, 
stories, applications, and case studies to teach the 
core concepts and motivate student learning. The 
best way to introduce concepts and reinforce them is 
through real-world examples; students simply relate 
more easily to them.
 • Pedagogical features reinforce learning. We’ve 
crafted a genuinely helpful set of features that are 
described in the next section, “Tools for Learning.”
 • Chapters are accessible and entertaining. We use 
a fluid and friendly writing style to make concepts 
accessible and, whenever possible, we use examples 
that are familiar to students.
 
• Although easy to understand, the book also 
prepares students for further coursework. 
There’s no need to choose between two unappeal-
ing alternatives: a textbook that is “easy to teach” 
but leaves major gaps in students’ understanding, 
or a textbook that is “hard to teach” but adequately 
prepares students for future coursework. We offer 
the best of both worlds.

F YOU BOUGHT A PAIR OF BLUE
jeans in 2011, you may have been 
shocked at the price. Or maybe not: fash-
ions change, and maybe you thought you 
were paying the price for being fashion-
able. But you weren’t—you were paying 
for cotton. Jeans are made of denim, 
which is a particular weave of cotton, 
and by late 2010, when jeans manufac-
turers were buying supplies for the com-
ing year, cotton prices were more than 
triple their level just two years earlier. 
By December 2010, the price of a pound 
of cotton had hit a 140-year high, the 
highest cotton price since records began 
in 1870.
And why were cotton prices so high?
On one side, demand for clothing of 
all kinds was surging. In 2008–2009, as 
the world struggled with the effects of a 
financial crisis, nervous consumers cut 
back on clothing purchases. But by 2010, 
with the worst apparently over, buyers 
were back in force. On the supply side, 
severe weather events hit world cotton 
production. Most notably, Pakistan, the 
world’s fourth-largest cotton producer, 
was hit by devastating floods that put 
one-fifth of the country underwater and 
virtually destroyed its cotton crop.
Fearing that consumers had limit-
ed tolerance for large increases in the 
price of cotton clothing, apparel mak-
ers began scrambling to find ways to 
reduce costs without offending con-
sumers’ fashion sense. They adopted 
changes like smaller buttons, cheaper 
linings, and—yes—polyester, doubting 
that consumers would be willing to pay 
more for cotton goods. In fact, some 
experts on the cotton market warned 
that the sky-high prices of cotton in 
2010–2011 might lead to a permanent 
shift in tastes, with consumers becom-
ing more willing to wear synthetics even 
when cotton prices came down.
At the same time, it was not all bad 
news for everyone connected with the 
cotton trade. In the United States, cot-
ton producers had not been hit by bad 
weather and were relishing the higher 
prices. American farmers responded to 
sky-high cotton prices by sharply increas-
ing the acreage devoted to the crop. None 
of this was enough, however, to produce 
immediate price relief.
Wait a minute: how, exactly, does 
flooding in Pakistan translate into high-
er jeans prices and more polyester in 
your T-shirts? It’s a matter of supply and 
demand—but what does that mean? 
Many people use “supply and demand” 
as a sort of catchphrase to mean “the 
laws of the marketplace at work.” To 
economists, however, the concept of 
supply and demand has a precise mean-
ing: it is a model of how a market behaves
that is extremely useful for understand-
ing many—but not all—markets.
In this chapter, we lay out the 
pieces that make up the supply and 
demand model, put them together, and 
show how this model can be used to 
understand how many—but not all—
markets behave.

Introduction: The Ordinary Business of Life
Initiates students into the study of economics with basic terms 
and explains the difference between microeconomics and 
macroeconomics.
 1. First Principles
Outlines 12 principles underlying the study of economics: 
principles of individual choice, interaction between individuals, 
and economy-wide interaction.
 2. Economic Models: Trade-offs and Trade
Employs two economic models—the production possibilities 
frontier and comparative advantage—as an introduction to gains 
from trade and international comparisons.
Chapter 2 Appendix: Graphs in Economics
Offers a comprehensive review of graphing and math skills for 
students who would find a refresher helpful and to prepare them 
for better economic literacy.
 3. Supply and Demand
Covers the essentials of supply, demand, market equilibrium, 
surplus, and shortage. 
 4. Consumer and Producer Surplus
Introduces students to market efficiency, the ways markets fail, the 
role of prices as signals, and property rights.
 5. Price Controls and Quotas: Meddling with Markets
Covers market interventions and their consequences: price and 
quantity controls, inefficiency, and deadweight loss.
 6. Elasticity
Introduces the various elasticity measures and explains how to 
calculate and interpret them, including price, cross-price and 
income elasticity of demand, and price elasticity of supply.
 7. Taxes
Covers basic tax analysis along with a review of the burden of 
taxation and considerations of equity versus efficiency. The structure 
of taxation, tax policy, and public spending are also introduced.
 8. International Trade
Here we trace the sources of comparative advantage, consider 
tariffs and quotas, and explore the politics of trade protection. The 
chapter includes coverage on the controversy over imports from 
low-wage countries.
 9. Decision Making by Individuals and Firms
Microeconomics is a science of how to make decisions. The chapter 
focuses on marginal analysis (“either–or” and “how much” decisions) 
and the concept of sunk cost; it also includes a new section on 
behavioral economics, showing the limitations of rational thought.
 10. The Rational Consumer
Provides a complete treatment of consumer behavior for 
instructors who don’t cover indifference curves, including the 
budget line, optimal consumption choice, diminishing marginal 
utility, and substitution effects.
 Chapter 10 Appendix: Consumer Preferences and 
Consumer Choice
Offers more detailed treatment for those who wish to cover 
indifference curves.

 11. Behind the Supply Curve: Inputs and Costs
Develops the production function and the various cost measures 
of the firm, including discussion of the difference between average 
cost and marginal cost.
 12. Perfect Competition and the Supply Curve
Explains the output decision of the perfectly competitive firm, its 
entry/exit decision, the industry supply curve, and the equilibrium 
of a perfectly competitive market.
 13. Monopoly
A complete treatment of monopoly, including topics such as price 
discrimination and the welfare effects of monopoly.
 14. Oligopoly
Streamlined for the new edition, the chapter focuses on defining 
the concept of oligopoly along with basic game theory in both 
a one-shot and repeated game context. Coverage of the kinked 
demand curve has moved online.
 15. Monopolistic Competition and Product 
Differentiation
The chapter emphasizes instances in which students encounter 
monopolistic competition, covering the entry/exit decision, 
efficiency considerations, and advertising.
 16. Externalities
Streamlined in the new edition, the chapter covers negative 
externalities and solutions to them, such as Coasian private 
trades, emissions taxes, and a system of tradable permits. 
Also examined are positive externalities (in a new section), 
technological spillovers, and network externalities.
 17. Public Goods and Common Resources
Explains how to classify goods into four categories (private goods, 
common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods) 
based on excludability and rivalry in consumption, in the process 
clarifying why some goods but not others can be efficiently 
managed by markets.
 18. The Economics of the Welfare State
Provides a comprehensive overview of the welfare state as well as 
its philosophical foundations. Examined in the chapter are health 
care economics (including a new section on 2010 health care 
reform), the problem of poverty, and the issue of income inequality.
 19. Factor Markets and the Distribution of Income 
Appendix: Indifference Curve Analysis of Labor 
Supply
Covers the efficiency-wage model of the labor market as well as 
influence of education, discrimination, and market power. The 
appendix examines the labor-leisure trade-off and the backward 
bending labor supply curve.
 20. Uncertainty, Risk, and Private Information
This unique, applied chapter explains attitudes toward risk, 
examines the benefits and limits of diversification, and considers 
private information, adverse selection, and moral hazard.

Printed Test Bank Coordinator and Consultant: Doris 
Bennett, Jacksonville State University. The Test Bank 
provides a wide range of questions appropriate for 
assessing your students’ comprehension, interpretation, 
analysis, and synthesis skills. Totaling over 4,500 ques-
tions, the Test Bank offers multiple-choice, true/false, 
and short-answer questions designed for comprehen-
sive coverage of the text concepts. Questions have been 
checked for continuity with the text content, overall 
usability, and accuracy.
The Test Bank features include the following:
 • To aid instructors in building tests, each question 
has been categorized according to its general degree 
of difficulty. The three levels are: easy, moderate, and 
difficult.
 • Easy questions require students to recognize 
concepts and definitions. These are questions 
that can be answered by direct reference to the 
textbook.
 • Moderate questions require some analysis on the 
student’s part.
 • Difficult questions usually require more detailed 
analysis by the student.
 • Each question has also been categorized accord-
ing to a skill descriptor. These include: Fact-Based, 
Definitional, Concept-Based, Critical Thinking, and 
Analytical Thinking.
 • Fact-Based Questions require students to identify 
facts presented in the text.
 • Definitional Questions require students to define an 
economic term or concept.
 • Concept-Based Questions require a straightforward 
knowledge of basic concepts.
 • Critical Thinking Questions require the student to 
apply a concept to a particular situation.
 • Analytical Thinking Questions require another 
level of analysis to answer the question. Students 
must be able to apply a concept and use this 
knowledge for further analysis of a situation or 
scenario.
 • To further aid instructors in building tests, each 
question is conveniently cross-referenced to the 
appropriate topic heading in the textbook. Questions 
are presented in the order in which concepts are 
presented in the text.
 • The Test Bank includes questions with tables that stu-
dents must analyze to solve for numerical answers. 
It also contains questions based on the graphs that 
appear in the book. These questions ask students to 
use the graphical models developed in the textbook 
and to interpret the information presented in the 
graph. Selected questions are paired with scenarios 
to reinforce comprehension.
 
• Questions have been designed to correlate with 
the various questions in the text. Study Guide 
Questions are also available in each chapter. This 
is a unique set of 25–30 questions per chapter that 
are parallel to the Chapter Review Questions in 
the printed Study Guide. These questions focus 
on the key concepts from the text that students 
should grasp after reading the chapter. These 
questions reflect the types of questions that the 
students have likely already worked through in 
homework assignments or in self-testing. These 
questions can also be used for testing or for brief 
in-class quizzes.
Computerized Test Bank The printed Test Bank 
is available in CD-ROM format for both Windows and 
Macintosh users. With this program, instructors can 
easily create and print tests and write and edit ques-
tions. Tests can be printed in a wide range of formats.

T’S SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN THE 
spring of 2011, and Route 1 in central 
New Jersey is a busy place. Thousands 
of people crowd the shopping malls that 
line the road for 20 miles, all the way 
from Trenton to New Brunswick. Most 
of the shoppers are cheerful—and why 
not? The stores in those malls offer an 
extraordinary range of choice; you can 
buy everything from sophisticated elec-
tronic equipment to fashionable clothes 
to organic carrots. There are probably 
100,000 distinct items available along 
that stretch of road. And most of these 
items are not luxury goods that only the 
rich can afford; they are products that 
millions of Americans can and do pur-
chase every day.
The scene along Route 1 on this 
spring day is, of course, perfectly ordi-
nary—very much like the scene along 
hundreds of other stretches of road, 
all across America, that same after-
noon. And the discipline of economics is 
mainly concerned with ordinary things. 
As the great nineteenth-century econo-
mist Alfred Marshall put it, economics 
is “a study of mankind in the ordinary 
business of life.”
What can economics say about this 
“ordinary business”? Quite a lot, it turns 
out. What we’ll see in this book is that 
even familiar scenes of economic life 
pose some very important questions—
questions that economics can help 
answer. Among these questions are:
• How does our economic system 
work? That is, how does it manage to 
deliver the goods?
• When and why does our economic 
system go astray, leading people into 
counterproductive behavior?
• Why are there ups and downs in the 
economy? That is, why does the econ-
omy sometimes have a “bad year”?
• Finally, why is the long run mainly a 
story of ups rather than downs? That 
is, why has America, along with other 
advanced nations, become so much 
richer over time?
Let’s take a look at these questions 
and offer a brief preview of what you will 
learn in this book. 
Introduction: The Ordinary 
Business of Life
ANY GIVEN SUNDAY

2    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
The Invisible Hand
T
hat ordinary scene in central New Jersey would not have looked at all 
ordinary to an American from colonial times—say, one of the patriots who 
helped George Washington win the Battle of Trenton in 1776. At the time, 
Trenton was a small village, and farms lined the route of Washington’s epic night 
march from Trenton to Princeton—a march that took him right past the future 
site of the giant Quakerbridge shopping mall.
Imagine that you could transport an American from the colonial period for-
ward in time to our own era. (Isn’t that the plot of a movie? Several, actually.) 
What would this time-traveler find amazing?
Surely the most amazing thing would be the sheer prosperity of modern 
America—the range of goods and services that ordinary families can afford. 
Looking at all that wealth, our transplanted colonial would wonder, “How can 
I get some of that?” Or perhaps he would ask himself, “How can my society get 
some of that?”
The answer is that to get this kind of prosperity, you need a well-functioning 
system for coordinating productive activities—the activities that create the goods 
and services people want and get them to the people who want them. That kind 
of system is what we mean when we talk about the economy. And economics is 
the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of 
goods and services.
An economy succeeds to the extent that it, literally, delivers the goods. A time-
traveler from the eighteenth century—or even from 1950—would be amazed at 
how many goods and services the modern American economy delivers and at how 
many people can afford them. Compared with any past economy and with all but 
a few other countries today, America has an incredibly high standard of living.
So our economy must be doing something right, and the time-traveler might 
want to compliment the person in charge. But guess what? There isn’t anyone in 
charge. The United States has a market economy, in which production and con-
sumption are the result of decentralized decisions by many firms and individuals. 
There is no central authority telling people what to produce or where to ship it. 
Each individual producer makes what he or she thinks will be most profitable; 
each consumer buys what he or she chooses.
The alternative to a market economy is a command economy, in which there 
is a central authority making decisions about production and consumption. 
Command economies have been tried, most notably in the Soviet Union between 
1917 and 1991. But they didn’t work very well. Producers in the Soviet Union rou-
tinely found themselves unable to produce because they did not have crucial raw 
materials, or they succeeded in producing but then found that nobody wanted 
their products. Consumers were often unable to find necessary items—command 
economies are famous for long lines at shops.
Market economies, however, are able to coordinate even highly complex activi-
ties and to reliably provide consumers with the goods and services they want. 
Indeed, people quite casually trust their lives to the market system: residents of 
any major city would starve in days if the unplanned yet somehow orderly actions 
of thousands of businesses did not deliver a steady supply of food. Surprisingly, 
the unplanned “chaos” of a market economy turns out to be far more orderly than 
the “planning” of a command economy.
In 1776, in a famous passage in his book The Wealth of Nations, the pioneer-
ing Scottish economist Adam Smith wrote about how individuals, in pursuing 
their own interests, often end up serving the interests of society as a whole. Of 
a businessman whose pursuit of profit makes the nation wealthier, Smith wrote: 
“[H]e intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by 
an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.” Ever 
since, economists have used the term invisible hand to refer to the way a market 
An economy is a system for 
coordinating society’s productive 
activities.
Economics is the social science 
that studies the production, 
distribution, and consumption of 
goods and services.
A market economy is an economy 
in which decisions about production 
and consumption are made by 
individual producers and consumers.
The invisible hand refers to the way 
in which the individual pursuit of self-
interest can lead to good results for 
society as a whole.

I N T R O D U C T I O N    T H E  O R D I N A RY  B U S I N E S S  O F  L I F E    3
economy manages to harness the power of 
self-interest for the good of society.
The study of how individuals make deci-
sions and how these decisions interact is 
called microeconomics. One of the key 
themes in microeconomics is the validity of 
Adam Smith’s insight: individuals pursuing 
their own interests often do promote the 
interests of society as a whole.
So part of the answer to our time-traveler’s 
question—“How can my society achieve the 
kind of prosperity you take for granted?”—is 
that his society should learn to appreciate the 
virtues of a market economy and the power 
of the invisible hand.
But the invisible hand isn’t always our 
friend. It’s also important to understand when 
and why the individual pursuit of self-interest 
can lead to counterproductive behavior.
My Benefit, Your Cost
One thing that our time-traveler would not admire about modern Route 1 is the 
traffic. In fact, although most things have gotten better in America over time, 
traffic congestion has gotten a lot worse.
When traffic is congested, each driver is imposing a cost on all the other driv-
ers on the road—he is literally getting in their way (and they are getting in his 
way). This cost can be substantial: in major metropolitan areas, each time some-
one drives to work, instead of taking public transportation or working at home, 
he can easily impose $15 or more in hidden costs on other drivers. Yet when 
deciding whether or not to drive, commuters have no incentive to take the costs 
they impose on others into account.
Traffic congestion is a familiar example of a much broader problem: sometimes 
the individual pursuit of one’s own interest, instead of promoting the interests of soci-
ety as a whole, can actually make society worse off. When this happens, it is known 
as market failure. Other important examples of market failure involve air and water 
pollution as well as the overexploitation of natural resources such as fish and forests.
The good news, as you will learn as you use this book to study microeconom-
ics, is that economic analysis can be used to diagnose cases of market failure. 
And often, economic analysis can also be used to devise solutions for the problem.
Good Times, Bad Times
Route 1 was bustling on that day in 2011. But if you’d visited the malls in 2008, the 
scene wouldn’t have been quite as cheerful. That’s because New Jersey’s economy, 
along with that of the United States as a whole, was depressed in 2008: in early 
2007, businesses began laying off workers in large numbers, and employment 
didn’t start bouncing back until the summer of 2009.
Such troubled periods are a regular feature of modern economies. The fact 
is that the economy does not always run smoothly: it experiences fluctuations, 
a series of ups and downs. By middle age, a typical American will have experi-
enced three or four downs, known as recessions. (The U.S. economy experi-
enced serious recessions beginning in 1973, 1981, 1990, 2001, and 2007.) During 
a severe recession, millions of workers may be laid off.

Microeconomics is the branch of 
economics that studies how people 
make decisions and how these 
decisions interact.
When the individual pursuit of self-
interest leads to bad results for 
society as a whole, there is market 
failure.
A recession is a downturn in the 
economy.

4    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
Like market failure, recessions are a fact of life; but also like market failure, 
they are a problem for which economic analysis offers some solutions. Recessions 
are one of the main concerns of the branch of economics known as macroeco-
nomics, which is concerned with the overall ups and downs of the economy. If 
you study macroeconomics, you will learn how economists explain recessions 
and how government policies can be used to minimize the damage from eco-
nomic fluctuations.
Despite the occasional recession, however, over the long run the story of the 
U.S. economy contains many more ups than downs. And that long-run ascent is 
the subject of our final question.
Onward and Upward
At the beginning of the twentieth century, most Americans lived under conditions 
that we would now think of as extreme poverty. Only 10% of homes had flush 
toilets, only 8% had central heating, only 2% had electricity, and almost nobody 
had a car, let alone a washing machine or air conditioning.
Such comparisons are a stark reminder of how much our lives have been 
changed by economic growth, the growing ability of the economy to produce 
goods and services. Why does the economy grow over time? And why does eco-
nomic growth occur faster in some times and places than in others? These are 
key questions for economics because economic growth is a good thing, as those 
shoppers on Route 1 can attest, and most of us want more of it.
An Engine for Discovery
We hope we have convinced you that the “ordinary business of life” is really quite 
extraordinary, if you stop to think about it, and that it can lead us to ask some 
very interesting and important questions.
In this book, we will describe the answers economists have given to these 
questions. But this book, like economics as a whole, isn’t a list of answers: it’s an 
introduction to a discipline, a way to address questions like those we have just 
asked. Or as Alfred Marshall, who described economics as a study of the “ordi-
nary business of life,” put it: “Economics . . . is not a body of concrete truth, but 
an engine for the discovery of concrete truth.”
So let’s turn the key and start the ignition.

T
HE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE
American Economic Association 
draws 
thousands 
of 
economists, 
young and old, famous and obscure. 
There are booksellers, business meet-
ings, and quite a few job interviews. 
But mainly the economists gather to 
talk and listen. During the busiest 
times, 60 or more presentations may be 
taking place simultaneously, on ques-
tions that range from financial market 
crises to who does the cooking in two-
earner families.
What do these people have in com-
mon? An expert on financial markets 
probably knows very little about the 
economics of housework, and vice 
versa. Yet an economist who wanders 
into the wrong seminar and ends up 
listening to presentations on some unfa-
miliar topic is nonetheless likely to hear 
much that is familiar. The reason is 
that all economic analysis is based on a 
set of common principles that apply to 
many different issues.
Some of these principles involve indi-
vidual choice—for economics is, first of 
all, about the choices that individuals 
make. Do you save your money and take 
the bus or do you buy a car? Do you keep 
your old smart-phone or upgrade to a 
new one? These decisions involve mak-
ing a choice from among a limited num-
ber of alternatives—limited because no 
one can have everything that he or she 
wants. Every question in economics at 
its most basic level involves individuals 
making choices.
But to understand how an economy 
works, you need to understand more 
than how individuals make choices. 
None of us are Robinson Crusoe, alone 
on an island. We must make decisions 
in an environment that is shaped by the 
decisions of others. Indeed, in a modern 
economy even the simplest decisions you 
make—say, what to have for breakfast—
are shaped by the decisions of thousands 
of other people, from the banana grower 
in Costa Rica who decided to grow the 
fruit you eat to the farmer in Iowa who 
provided the corn in your cornflakes.
Because each of us in a market econ-
omy depends on so many others—and 
they, in turn, depend on us—our choices 
interact. So although all economics at a 
basic level is about individual choice, in 
order to understand how market econo-
mies behave we must also understand 
economic interaction—how my choices 
affect your choices, and vice versa.
Many important economic interac-
tions can be understood by looking 
at the markets for individual goods, like the 
market for corn. But an economy as a whole 
has ups and downs, and we therefore need 
to understand economy-wide interactions 
as well as the more limited interactions 
that occur in individual markets.
In this chapter, we will look at twelve 
basic principles of economics—four prin-
ciples involving individual choice, five 
involving the way individual choices inter-
act, and three more involving economy-
wide interactions.

Principles That Underlie Individual 
Choice: The Core of Economics
E
very economic issue involves, at its most basic level, individual choice—
decisions by an individual about what to do and what not to do. In fact, you 
might say that it isn’t economics if it isn’t about choice.
Step into a big store like a Walmart or Target. There are thousands of different 
products available, and it is extremely unlikely that you—or anyone else—could 
afford to buy everything you might want to have. And anyway, 
there’s only so much space in your dorm room or apartment. 
So will you buy another bookcase or a mini-refrigerator? Given 
limitations on your budget and your living space, you must 
choose which products to buy and which to leave on the shelf.
The fact that those products are on the shelf in the first 
place involves choice—the store manager chose to put them 
there, and the manufacturers of the products chose to produce 
them. All economic activities involve individual choice.
Four economic principles underlie the economics of indi-
vidual choice, as shown in Table 1-1. We’ll now examine each 
of these principles in more detail.
Principle #1: Choices Are Necessary 
Because Resources Are Scarce
You can’t always get what you want. Everyone would like to have a beautiful 
house in a great location (and have help with the housecleaning), a new car 
or two, and a nice vacation in a fancy hotel. But even in a rich country like 
the United States, not many families can afford all that. So they must make 
choices—whether to go to Disney World this year or buy a better car, whether 
to make do with a small backyard or accept a longer commute in order to live 
where land is cheaper.
Limited income isn’t the only thing that keeps people from having every-
thing they want. Time is also in limited supply: there are only 24 hours in a 
day. And because the time we have is limited, choosing to spend time on one 
activity also means choosing not to spend time on a different activity—spend-
ing time studying for an exam means forgoing a night spent watching a movie. 
Indeed, many people are so limited by the number of hours in the day that they 
are willing to trade money for time. For example, convenience stores normally 
charge higher prices than a regular supermarket. But they fulfill a valuable role 
by catering to time-pressured customers who would rather pay more than travel 
farther to the supermarket.
This leads us to our first principle of individual choice:
People must make choices because resources are scarce.
A resource is anything that can be used to produce something else. Lists 
of the economy’s resources usually begin with land, labor (the time of work-
ers), capital (machinery, buildings, and other man-made productive assets), and 
human capital (the educational achievements and skills of workers). A resource 
is scarce when there’s not enough of the resource available to satisfy all the 
ways a society wants to use it. There are many scarce resources. These include 
natural resources—resources that come from the physical environment, such 
as minerals, lumber, and petroleum. There is also a limited quantity of human 
resources—labor, skill, and intelligence. And in a growing world economy with 
a rapidly increasing human population, even clean air and water have become 
scarce resources.
TABLE   1-1    The Principles of Individual 
Choice
1. People must make choices because resources are scarce.
2. The opportunity cost of an item—what you must give up 
in order to get it—is its true cost.
3. “How much” decisions require making trade-offs at the 
margin: comparing the costs and benefits of doing a little 
bit more of an activity versus doing a little bit less.
4. People usually respond to incentives, exploiting 
opportunities to make themselves better off.
Individual choice is the decision 
by an individual of what to do, which 
necessarily involves a decision of 
what not to do.
A resource is anything that can be 
used to produce something else.
Resources are scarce—not enough 
of the resources are available to 
satisfy all the various ways a society 
wants to use them.

C H A P T E R  1    FI R S T  P R I N C I P L E S    7
Just as individuals must make choices, the scarcity of resources means that 
society as a whole must make choices. One way a society makes choices is by 
allowing them to emerge as the result of many individual choices, which is what 
usually happens in a market economy. For example, Americans as a group have 
only so many hours in a week: how many of those hours will they spend going to 
supermarkets to get lower prices, rather than saving time by shopping at conve-
nience stores? The answer is the sum of individual decisions: each of the millions 
of individuals in the economy makes his or her own choice about where to shop, 
and the overall choice is simply the sum of those individual decisions.
But for various reasons, there are some decisions that a society decides are 
best not left to individual choice. For example, the authors live in an area that 
until recently was mainly farmland but is now being rapidly built up. Most local 
residents feel that the community would be a more pleasant place to live if some 
of the land was left undeveloped. But no individual has an incentive to keep his or 
her land as open space, rather than sell it to a developer. So a trend has emerged 
in many communities across the United States of local governments purchasing 
undeveloped land and preserving it as open space. We’ll see in later chapters why 
decisions about how to use scarce resources are often best left to individuals but 
sometimes should be made at a higher, community-wide, level.
Principle #2: The True Cost of Something 
Is Its Opportunity Cost 
It is the last term before you graduate, and your class schedule allows you to take 
only one elective. There are two, however, that you would really like to take: Intro 
to Computer Graphics and History of Jazz.
Suppose you decide to take the History of Jazz course. What’s the cost of that 
decision? It is the fact that you can’t take the computer graphics class, your next 
best alternative choice. Economists call that kind of cost—what you must give up 
in order to get an item you want—the opportunity cost of that item. This leads 
us to our second principle of individual choice:
The opportunity cost of an item—what you must give up in order to 
get it—is its true cost. 
So the opportunity cost of taking the History of Jazz class is the benefit you 
would have derived from the Intro to Computer Graphics class.
The concept of opportunity cost is crucial to understanding individual choice 
because, in the end, all costs are opportunity costs. That’s because every choice 
you make means forgoing some other alternative. Sometimes critics claim that 
economists are concerned only with costs and benefits that can be measured in 
dollars and cents. But that is not true. Much economic analysis involves cases 
like our elective course example, where it costs no extra tuition to take one elec-
tive course—that is, there is no direct monetary cost. Nonetheless, the elective 
you choose has an opportunity cost—the other desirable elective course that you 
must forgo because your limited time permits taking only one. More specifi-
cally, the opportunity cost of a choice is what you forgo by not choosing your 
next best alternative.
You might think that opportunity cost is an add-on—that is, something 
additional to the monetary cost of an item. Suppose that an elective class costs 
additional tuition of $750; now there is a monetary cost to taking History of Jazz. 
Is the opportunity cost of taking that course something separate from that mon-
etary cost?
Well, consider two cases. First, suppose that taking Intro to Computer 
Graphics also costs $750. In this case, you would have to spend that $750 no mat-
ter which class you take. So what you give up to take the History of Jazz class 
is still the computer graphics class, period—you would have to spend that $750 
The real cost of an item is its 
opportunity cost: what you must 
give up in order to get it.

8    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
either way. But suppose there isn’t any fee for the computer graphics class. In 
that case, what you give up to take the jazz class is the benefit from the computer 
graphics class plus the benefit you could have gained from spending the $750 on 
other things.
Either way, the real cost of taking your preferred class is what you must give 
up to get it. As you expand the set of decisions that underlie each choice—whether 
to take an elective or not, whether to finish this term or not, whether to drop out 
or not—you’ll realize that all costs are ultimately opportunity costs.
Sometimes the money you have to pay for something is a good indication of 
its opportunity cost. But many times it is not. One very important example of 
how poorly monetary cost can indicate opportunity cost is the cost of attending 
college. Tuition and housing are major monetary expenses for most students; but 
even if these things were free, attending college would still be an expensive propo-
sition because most college students, if they were not in college, would have a job. 
That is, by going to college, students forgo the income they could have earned if 
they had worked instead. This means that the opportunity cost of attending col-
lege is what you pay for tuition and housing plus the forgone income you would 
have earned in a job.
It’s easy to see that the opportunity cost of going to college is especially high 
for people who could be earning a lot during what would otherwise have been 
their college years. That is why star athletes like LeBron James and entrepreneurs 
like Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, often skip or drop out of college.
Principle #3: “How Much” Is a Decision at the Margin
Some important decisions involve an “either–or” choice—for example, you decide 
either to go to college or to begin working; you decide either to take economics or to 
take something else. But other important decisions involve “how much” choices—
for example, if you are taking both economics and chemistry this semester, you 
must decide how much time to spend studying for each. When it comes to under-
standing “how much” decisions, economics has an important insight to offer: “how 
much” is a decision made at the margin.
Suppose you are taking both economics and chemistry. And suppose you are 
a pre-med student, so your grade in chemistry matters more to you than your 
grade in economics. Does that therefore imply that you should spend all your 
study time on chemistry and wing it on the economics exam? Probably not; even 
if you think your chemistry grade is more important, you should put some effort 
into studying economics.
Spending more time studying chemistry involves a benefit (a higher expected 
grade in that course) and a cost (you could have spent that time doing something 
else, such as studying to get a higher grade in economics). That is, your decision 
involves a trade-off—a comparison of costs and benefits.
How do you decide this kind of “how much” question? The typical answer is 
that you make the decision a bit at a time, by asking how you should spend the 
next hour. Say both exams are on the same day, and the night before you spend 
time reviewing your notes for both courses. At 6:00 P.M., you decide that it’s a good 
idea to spend at least an hour on each course. At 8:00 P.M., you decide you’d better 
spend another hour on each course. At 10:00 P.M., you are getting tired and figure 
you have one more hour to study before bed—chemistry or economics? If you are 
pre-med, it’s likely to be chemistry; if you are pre-MBA, it’s likely to be economics.
Note how you’ve made the decision to allocate your time: at each point the 
question is whether or not to spend one more hour on either course. And in decid-
ing whether to spend another hour studying for chemistry, you weigh the costs 
(an hour forgone of studying for economics or an hour forgone of sleeping) versus 
the benefits (a likely increase in your chemistry grade). As long as the benefit of 
studying chemistry for one more hour outweighs the cost, you should choose to 
study for that additional hour.

Decisions of this type—whether to do a bit more or a bit less of an activity, 
like what to do with your next hour, your next dollar, and so on—are marginal 
decisions. This brings us to our third principle of individual choice:
“How much” decisions require making trade-offs at the margin: com-
paring the costs and benefits of doing a little bit more of an activity 
versus doing a little bit less.
The study of such decisions is known as marginal analysis. Many of the 
questions that we face in economics—as well as in real life—involve marginal 
analysis: How many workers should I hire in my shop? At what mileage should I 
change the oil in my car? What is an acceptable rate of negative side effects from 
a new medicine? Marginal analysis plays a central role in economics because it is 
the key to deciding “how much” of an activity to do.
Principle #4: People Usually Respond to Incentives, 
Exploiting Opportunities to Make Themselves Better Off
One day, while listening to the morning financial news, the authors heard a great 
tip about how to park cheaply in Manhattan. Garages in the Wall Street area 
charge as much as $30 per day. But according to the newscaster, some people 
had found a better way: instead of parking in a garage, they had their oil changed 
at the Manhattan Jiffy Lube, where it costs $19.95 to change your oil—and they 
keep your car all day!
It’s a great story, but unfortunately it turned out not to be true—in fact, there 
is no Jiffy Lube in Manhattan. But if there were, you can be sure there would be 
a lot of oil changes there. Why? Because when people are offered opportunities 
to make themselves better off, they normally take them—and if they could find a 
way to park their car all day for $19.95 rather than $30, they would.
In this example economists say that people are responding to an incentive—
an opportunity to make themselves better off. We can now state our fourth prin-
ciple of individual choice:
People usually respond to incentives, exploiting opportunities to 
make themselves better off.
When you try to predict how individuals will behave in an economic situation, 
it is a very good bet that they will respond to incentives—that is, exploit oppor-
tunities to make themselves better off. Furthermore, individuals will continue to 
exploit these opportunities until they have been fully exhausted. If there really 
were a Manhattan Jiffy Lube and an oil change really were a cheap way to park 
your car, we can safely predict that before long the waiting list for oil changes 
would be weeks, if not months.
In fact, the principle that people will exploit opportunities to make themselves 
better off is the basis of all predictions by economists about individual behavior. 
If the earnings of those who get MBAs soar while the earnings of those who 
get law degrees decline, we can expect more students to go to business school 
and fewer to go to law school. If the price of gasoline rises and stays high for an 
extended period of time, we can expect people to buy smaller cars with higher 
gas mileage—making themselves better off in the presence of higher gas prices 
by driving more fuel-efficient cars.
One last point: economists tend to be skeptical of any attempt to change 
people’s behavior that doesn’t change their incentives. For example, a plan that 
calls on manufacturers to reduce pollution voluntarily probably won’t be effective 
because it hasn’t changed manufacturers’ incentives. In contrast, a plan that gives 
them a financial reward to reduce pollution is a lot more likely to work because 
it has changed their incentives.
Decisions about whether to do a 
bit more or a bit less of an activity 
are marginal decisions. The study 
of such decisions is known as 
marginal analysis.
An incentive is anything that offers 
rewards to people who change their 
behavior.

So are we ready to do economics? Not yet—because most of the interesting 
things that happen in the economy are the result not merely of individual choices 
but of the way in which individual choices interact.

ne fact about China is indisputable: it’s a big country with lots of people. As 
of 2009, the population of China was 1,331,460,000. That’s right: over one 
billion three hundred million.
In 1978, the government of China introduced the “one-child policy” to address 
the economic and demographic challenges presented by China’s large population. 
China was very, very poor in 1978, and its leaders worried that the country could 
not afford to adequately educate and care for its growing population. The average 
Chinese woman in the 1970s was giving birth to more than five children during 
her lifetime. So the government restricted most couples, particularly those in 
urban areas, to one child, imposing penalties on those who defied the mandate. As 
a result, by 2009 the average number of births for a woman in China was only 1.8.
But the one-child policy had an unfortunate unintended consequence. Because 
China is an overwhelmingly rural country and sons can perform the manual 
The true reward for learning is, of 
course, the learning itself. Many stu-
dents, however, struggle with their 
motivation to study and work hard. 
Teachers and policy makers have been 
particularly challenged to help students 
from disadvantaged backgrounds, who 
often have poor school attendance, high 
dropout rates, and low standardized test 
scores. In a 2007–2008 study, Harvard 
economist Roland Fryer Jr. found that 
monetary incentives—cash rewards—
could improve students’ academic 
performance in schools in economically 
disadvantaged areas. How cash incen-
tives work, however, is both surprising 
and predictable.
Fryer conducted his research in four 
different school districts, employing a 
different set of incentives and a differ-
ent measure of performance in each. In 
New York, students were paid according 
to their scores on standardized tests; in 
Chicago, they were paid according to 
their grades; in Washington, D.C., they 
were paid according to attendance and 
good behavior as well as their grades; 
in Dallas, second-graders were paid 
each time they read a book. Fryer evalu-
ated the results by comparing the per-
formance of students who were in the 
program to other students in the same 
school who were not.
In New York, the program had 
no perceptible effect on test 
scores. In Chicago, students in 
the program got better grades 
and attended class more. In 
Washington, the program boost-
ed the outcomes of the kids 
who are normally the hardest to 
reach, those with serious behav-
ioral problems, raising their test 
scores by an amount equivalent 
to attending five extra months of 
school. The most dramatic results 
occurred in Dallas, where students 
significantly boosted their reading-
comprehension test scores; results 
continued into the next year, after the 
cash rewards had ended.
So what explains the various results?
To motivate students with cash rewards, 
Fryer found that students had to believe 
that they could have a significant effect on 
the performance measure. So in Chicago, 
Washington, and Dallas—where students 
had a significant amount of control over 
outcomes such as grades, attendance, 
behavior, and the number of books read—
the program produced significant results. 
But because New York students had little 
idea how to affect their score on a stan-
dardized test, the prospect of a reward 
had little influence on their behavior. Also, 
the timing of the reward matters: a $1 
reward has more effect on behavior if per-
formance is measured at shorter intervals 
and the reward is delivered soon after.
Fryer’s experiment revealed some 
critical insights about how to motivate 
behavior with incentives. How incen-
tives are designed is very important: 
the relationship between effort and out-
come, as well as the speed of reward, 
matters a lot. Moreover, the design of 
incentives may depend quite a lot on 
the characteristics of the people you 
are trying to motivate: what motivates a 
student from an economically privileged 
background may not motivate a student 
from an economically disadvantaged 
one. Fryer’s insights give teachers and 
policy makers an important new tool for 
helping disadvantaged students suc-
ceed in school.

labor of farming, families had a strong preference for sons over daughters. 
In addition, tradition dictates that brides become part of their husbands’ 
families and that sons take care of their elderly parents. As a result of the 
one-child policy, China soon had too many “unwanted girls.” Some were 
given up for adoption abroad, but all too many simply “disappeared” during 
the first year of life, the victims of neglect and mistreatment.
India, another highly rural poor country with high demographic pres-
sures, also has a significant problem with “disappearing girls.” In 1990, 
Amartya Sen, an Indian-born British economist who would go on to win 
the Nobel Prize in 1998, estimated that there were up to 100 million “miss-
ing women” in Asia. (The exact figure is in dispute, but it is clear that Sen 
identified a real and pervasive problem.)
Demographers have recently noted a distinct turn of events in China, 
which is quickly urbanizing. In all but one of the provinces with urban cen-
ters, the gender imbalance between boys and girls peaked in 1995 and has 
steadily fallen toward the biologically natural ratio since then. Many believe 
that the source of the change is China’s strong economic growth and increas-
ing urbanization. As people move to cities to take advantage of job growth there, 
they don’t need sons to work the fields. Moreover, land prices in Chinese cities are 
skyrocketing, making the custom of parents buying an apartment for a son before 
he can marry unaffordable for many. To be sure, sons are still preferred in the 
rural areas. But as a sure mark of how times have changed, Internet websites have 
recently popped up that advise couples on how to have a girl rather than a boy.

Interaction: How Economies Work
A
s we learned in the Introduction, an economy is a system for coordinat-
ing the productive activities of many people. In a market economy like we 
live in, coordination takes place without any coordinator: each individual 
makes his or her own choices. Yet those choices are by no means independent 
of one another: each individual’s opportunities, and hence choices, depend to a 
large extent on the choices made by other people. So to understand how a mar-
ket economy behaves, we have to examine this interaction in which my choices 
affect your choices, and vice versa.
The cost of China’s “one-child policy” was a 
generation of “disappeared” daughters—a phe-
nomenon that has itself begun to disappear as 
economic conditions have changed.

• All economic activities involve indi-
vidual choice.
• People must make choices because 
resources are scarce.
• The real cost of something is its 
opportunity cost—what you must 
give up to get it. All costs are 
opportunity costs. Monetary costs 
are sometimes a good indicator of 
opportunity costs, but not always.
• Many choices involve not whether 
to do something but how much of it 
to do. “How much” choices call for 
making a trade-off at the margin. 
The study of marginal decisions is 
known as marginal analysis.
• Because people usually exploit 
opportunities to make themselves 
better off, incentives can change 
people’s behavior.
 Quick Review
Interaction of choices—my choices 
affect your choices, and vice 
versa—is a feature of most economic 
situations. The results of this 
interaction are often quite different 
from what the individuals intend.

12    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
When studying economic interaction, we quickly learn that the end result of 
individual choices may be quite different from what any one individual intends. 
For example, over the past century farmers in the United States have eagerly 
adopted new farming techniques and crop strains that have reduced their costs 
and increased their yields. Clearly, it’s in the interest of each farmer to keep up 
with the latest farming techniques.
But the end result of each farmer trying to increase his or her own income 
has actually been to drive many farmers out of business. Because American 
farmers have been so successful at producing larger yields, agricultural prices 
have steadily fallen. These falling prices have reduced the incomes of many 
farmers, and as a result fewer and fewer people find farming 
worth doing. That is, an individual farmer who plants a better 
variety of corn is better off; but when many farmers plant a 
better variety of corn, the result may be to make farmers as a 
group worse off.
A farmer who plants a new, more productive corn variety 
doesn’t just grow more corn. Such a farmer also affects the market 
for corn through the increased yields attained, with consequences 
that will be felt by other farmers, consumers, and beyond.
Just as there are four economic principles that underlie indi-
vidual choice, there are five principles that underlie the economics 
of interaction. These five principles are summarized in Table 1-2. 
We will now examine each of these principles more closely.
Principle #5: There Are Gains from Trade
Why do the choices I make interact with the choices you make? A family could try 
to take care of all its own needs—growing its own food, sewing its own clothing, 
providing itself with entertainment, writing its own economics textbooks. But 
trying to live that way would be very hard. The key to a much better standard of 
living for everyone is trade, in which people divide tasks among themselves and 
each person provides a good or service that other people want in return for dif-
ferent goods and services that he or she wants.
The reason we have an economy, not many self-sufficient individuals, is that 
there are gains from trade: by dividing tasks and trading, two people (or 6 bil-
lion people) can each get more of what they want than they could get by being 
self-sufficient. This leads us to our fifth principle:
There are gains from trade.
Gains from trade arise from this division of tasks, which economists call 
specialization—a situation in which different people each engage in a different 
task, specializing in those tasks that they are good at performing. The advantages of 
specialization, and the resulting gains from trade, were the starting point for Adam 
Smith’s 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, which many regard as the beginning of 
economics as a discipline. Smith’s book begins with a description of an eighteenth-
century pin factory where, rather than each of the 10 workers making a pin from 
start to finish, each worker specialized in one of the many steps in pin-making:
One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a 
fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three 
distinct operations; to put it on, is a particular business, to whiten the pins is another; 
it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of 
making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations. . . . 
Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thou-
sand pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and 
without any of them having been educated to this particular business, they certainly 
could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin a day. . . .
In a market economy, individuals 
engage in trade: they provide goods 
and services to others and receive 
goods and services in return.
There are gains from trade: 
people can get more of what they 
want through trade than they could 
if they tried to be self-sufficient. 
This increase in output is due 
to specialization: each person 
specializes in the task that he or she 
is good at performing.

Interaction of Individual Choices
5. There are gains from trade.
6. Because people respond to incentives, markets 
move toward equilibrium.
7. Resources should be used as efficiently as possible 
to achieve society’s goals.
8. Because people usually exploit gains from trade, 
markets usually lead to efficiency.
9. When markets don’t achieve efficiency, government 
intervention can improve society’s welfare.

C H A P T E R  1    FI R S T  P R I N C I P L E S    13
The same principle applies when we look at how people 
divide tasks among themselves and trade in an economy. The 
economy, as a whole, can produce more when each person spe-
cializes in a task and trades with others.
The benefits of specialization are the reason a person typi-
cally chooses only one career. It takes many years of study and 
experience to become a doctor; it also takes many years of study 
and experience to become a commercial airline pilot. Many 
doctors might well have had the potential to become excel-
lent pilots, and vice versa; but it is very unlikely that anyone 
who decided to pursue both careers would be as good a pilot 
or as good a doctor as someone who decided at the beginning 
to specialize in that field. So it is to everyone’s advantage that 
individuals specialize in their career choices.
Markets are what allow a doctor and a pilot to specialize in 
their own fields. Because markets for commercial flights and for doctors’ services 
exist, a doctor is assured that she can find a flight and a pilot is assured that he can 
find a doctor. As long as individuals know that they can find the goods and services 
they want in the market, they are willing to forgo self-sufficiency and to specialize. 
But what assures people that markets will deliver what they want? The answer to 
that question leads us to our second principle of how individual choices interact.
Principle #6: Markets Move Toward Equilibrium
It’s a busy afternoon at the supermarket; there are long lines at the checkout 
counters. Then one of the previously closed cash registers opens. What happens? 
The first thing, of course, is a rush to that register. After a couple of minutes, 
however, things will have settled down; shoppers will have rearranged themselves 
so that the line at the newly opened register is about the same length as the lines 
at all the other registers.
How do we know that? We know from our fourth principle that people will 
exploit opportunities to make themselves better off. This means that people 
will rush to the newly opened register in order to save time standing in line. And 
things will settle down when shoppers can no longer improve their position by 
switching lines—that is, when the opportunities to make themselves better off 
have all been exploited.
A story about supermarket checkout lines may seem to have little to do with 
how individual choices interact, but in fact it illustrates an important principle. 
A situation in which individuals cannot make themselves better off by doing 
something different—the situation in which all the checkout lines are the same 
length—is what economists call an equilibrium. An economic situation is in 
equilibrium when no individual would be better off doing something different.
Recall the story about the mythical Jiffy Lube, where it was supposedly cheap-
er to leave your car for an oil change than to pay for parking. If the opportunity 
had really existed and people were still paying $30 to park in garages, the situa-
tion would not have been an equilibrium. And that should have been a giveaway 
that the story couldn’t be true. In reality, people would have seized an opportunity 
to park cheaply, just as they seize opportunities to save time at the checkout line. 
And in so doing they would have eliminated the opportunity! Either it would have 
become very hard to get an appointment for an oil change or the price of a lube 
job would have increased to the point that it was no longer an attractive option 
(unless you really needed a lube job). This brings us to our sixth principle:
Because people respond to incentives, markets move toward equilibrium.
As we will see, markets usually reach equilibrium via changes in prices, which rise 
or fall until no opportunities for individuals to make themselves better off remain.

An economic situation is in 
equilibrium when no individual 
would be better off doing something 
different.

The concept of equilibrium is extremely helpful in understanding economic 
interactions because it provides a way of cutting through the sometimes complex 
details of those interactions. To understand what happens when a new line is 
opened at a supermarket, you don’t need to worry about exactly how shoppers 
rearrange themselves, who moves ahead of whom, which register just opened, 
and so on. What you need to know is that any time there is a change, the situation 
will move to an equilibrium.
The fact that markets move toward equilibrium is why we can depend on them 
to work in a predictable way. In fact, we can trust markets to supply us with the 
essentials of life. For example, people who live in big cities can be sure that the 
supermarket shelves will always be fully stocked. Why? Because if some mer-
chants who distribute food didn’t make deliveries, a big profit opportunity would 
be created for any merchant who did—and there would be a rush to supply food, 
just like the rush to a newly opened cash register. So the market ensures that food 
will always be available for city dwellers. And, returning to our fifth principle, 
this allows city dwellers to be city dwellers—to specialize in doing city jobs rather 
than living on farms and growing their own food.
A market economy, as we have seen, allows people to achieve gains from trade. 
But how do we know how well such an economy is doing? The next principle gives 
us a standard to use in evaluating an economy’s performance.
Principle #7: Resources Should Be Used Efficiently 
to Achieve Society’s Goals
Suppose you are taking a course in which the classroom is too small for the num-
ber of students—many people are forced to stand or sit on the floor—despite the 
fact that large, empty classrooms are available nearby. You would say, correctly, 
that this is no way to run a college. Economists would call this an inefficient use 
of resources. But if an inefficient use of resources is undesirable, just what does 
it mean to use resources efficiently? You might imagine that the efficient use of 
resources has something to do with money, maybe that it is measured in dollars-
and-cents terms. But in economics, as in life, money is only a means to other ends. 
The measure that economists really care about is not money but people’s happi-
ness or welfare. Economists say that an economy’s resources are used efficiently 
when they are used in a way that has fully exploited all opportunities to make every-
Why do people in America drive on the 
right side of the road? Of course, it’s 
the law. But long before it was the law, it 
was an equilibrium.
Before there were formal traffic laws, 
there were informal “rules of the road,” 
practices that everyone expected every-
one else to follow. These rules included 
an understanding that people would 
normally keep to one side of the road. In 
some places, such as England, the rule 
was to keep to the left; in others, such 
as France, it was to keep to the right.
Why would some places choose the 
right and others, the left? That’s not 
completely clear, although it may have 
depended on the dominant form of 
traffic. Men riding horses and carrying 
swords on their left hip preferred to ride 
on the left (think about getting on or off 
the horse, and you’ll see why). On the 
other hand, right-handed people walking 
but leading horses apparently preferred 
to walk on the right.
In any case, once a rule of the road 
was established, there were strong 
incentives for each individual to stay on 
the “usual” side of the road: those who 
didn’t would keep colliding with oncom-
ing traffic. So once established, the rule 
of the road would be self-enforcing—that 
is, it would be an equilibrium. Nowadays, 
of course, which side you drive on is 
determined by law; some countries have 
even changed sides (Sweden went from 
left to right in 1967).
But what about pedestrians? There 
are no laws—but there are informal rules. 
In the United States, urban pedestrians 
normally keep to the right. But if you 
should happen to visit a country where 
people drive on the left, watch out: peo-
ple who drive on the left also typically 
walk on the left. So when in a foreign 
country, do as the locals do. You won’t 
be arrested if you walk on the right, but 
you will be worse off than if you accept 
the equilibium and walk on the left.

one better off. To put it another way, an economy is efficient if it takes all oppor-
tunities to make some people better off without making other people worse off.
In our classroom example, there clearly was a way to make everyone better 
off—moving the class to a larger room would make people in the class better off 
without hurting anyone else in the college. Assigning the course to the smaller 
classroom was an inefficient use of the college’s resources, whereas assigning 
the course to the larger classroom would have been an efficient use of the col-
lege’s resources.
When an economy is efficient, it is producing the maximum gains from trade 
possible given the resources available. Why? Because there is no way to rear-
range how resources are used in a way that can make everyone better off. When 
an economy is efficient, one person can be made better off by rearranging how 
resources are used only by making someone else worse off. In our classroom 
example, if all larger classrooms were already occupied, the college would have 
been run in an efficient way: your class could be made better off by moving to 
a larger classroom only by making people in the larger classroom worse off by 
making them move to a smaller classroom.
We can now state our seventh principle:
Resources should be used as efficiently as possible to achieve soci-
ety’s goals. 
Should economic policy makers always strive to achieve economic efficiency? 
Well, not quite, because efficiency is only a means to achieving society’s goals. 
Sometimes efficiency may conflict with a goal that society has deemed worth-
while to achieve. For example, in most societies, people also care about issues 
of fairness, or equity. And there is typically a trade-off between equity and effi-
ciency: policies that promote equity often come at a cost of decreased efficiency 
in the economy, and vice versa.
To see this, consider the case of disabled-designated parking spaces in public 
parking lots. Many people have difficulty walking due to age or disability, so it 
seems only fair to assign closer parking spaces specifically for their use. You may 
have noticed, however, that a certain amount of inefficiency is involved. To make 
sure that there is always a parking space available should a disabled person want 
one, there are typically more such spaces available than there are disabled people 
who want one. As a result, desirable parking spaces are unused. (And the temp-
tation for nondisabled people to use them is so great that we must be dissuaded 
by fear of getting a ticket.) So, short of hiring parking valets to allocate spaces, 
there is a conflict between equity, making life “fairer” for disabled people, and 
efficiency, making sure that all opportunities to make people better off have been 
fully exploited by never letting close-in parking spaces go unused.
Exactly how far policy makers should go in promoting equity over efficiency 
is a difficult question that goes to the heart of the political process. As such, it 
is not a question that economists can answer. What is important for economists, 
however, is always to seek to use the economy’s resources as efficiently as possible 
in the pursuit of society’s goals, whatever those goals may be.
Principle #8: Markets Usually Lead to Efficiency
No branch of the U.S. government is entrusted with ensuring the general eco-
nomic efficiency of our market economy—we don’t have agents who go around 
making sure that brain surgeons aren’t plowing fields or that Minnesota farm-
ers aren’t trying to grow oranges. The government doesn’t need to enforce the 
efficient use of resources, because in most cases the invisible hand does the job.
The incentives built into a market economy ensure that resources are usu-
ally put to good use and that opportunities to make people better off are not 
wasted. If a college were known for its habit of crowding students into small 
An economy is efficient if it takes all 
opportunities to make some people 
better off without making other 
people worse off.
Equity means that everyone gets his 
or her fair share. Since people can 
disagree about what’s “fair,” equity 
isn’t as well defined a concept as 
efficiency.
Sometimes equity trumps efficiency.

classrooms while large classrooms went unused, it would soon find its enroll-
ment dropping, putting the jobs of its administrators at risk. The “market” for 
college students would respond in a way that induced administrators to run the 
college efficiently.
A detailed explanation of why markets are usually very good at making sure 
that resources are used well will have to wait until we have studied how markets 
actually work. But the most basic reason is that in a market economy, in which 
individuals are free to choose what to consume and what to produce, people nor-
mally take opportunities for mutual gain—that is, gains from trade. If there is a 
way in which some people can be made better off, people will usually be able to 
take advantage of that opportunity. And that is exactly what defines efficiency: 
all the opportunities to make some people better off without making other people 
worse off have been exploited. This gives rise to our eighth principle:
Because people usually exploit gains from trade, markets usually lead 
to efficiency. 
As we learned in the Introduction, however, there are exceptions to this principle 
that markets are generally efficient. In cases of market failure, the individual pursuit 
of self-interest found in markets makes society worse off—that is, the market out-
come is inefficient. And, as we will see in examining the next principle, when markets 
fail, government intervention can help. But short of instances of market failure, the 
general rule is that markets are a remarkably good way of organizing an economy.
Principle #9: When Markets Don’t Achieve Efficiency, 
Government Intervention Can Improve Society’s Welfare
Let’s recall from the Introduction the nature of the market failure caused by 
traffic congestion—a commuter driving to work has no incentive to take into 
account the cost that his or her action inflicts on other drivers in the form of 
increased traffic congestion. There are several possible remedies to this situa-
tion; examples include charging road tolls, subsidizing the cost of public trans-
portation, and taxing sales of gasoline to individual drivers. All these remedies 
work by changing the incentives of would-be drivers, motivating them to drive 
less and use alternative transportation. But they also share another feature: 
each relies on government intervention in the market. This brings us to our 
ninth principle:
When markets don’t achieve efficiency, government intervention can 
improve society’s welfare.
That is, when markets go wrong, an appropriately designed government policy 
can sometimes move society closer to an efficient outcome by changing how soci-
ety’s resources are used.
A very important branch of economics is devoted to studying why markets 
fail and what policies should be adopted to improve social welfare. We will study 
these problems and their remedies in depth in later chapters, but, briefly, there 
are three principal ways in which they fail:
 • Individual actions have side effects that are not properly taken into account by 
the market. An example is an action that causes pollution.
 • One party prevents mutually beneficial trades from occurring in an attempt to 
capture a greater share of resources for itself. An example is a drug company 
that prices a drug higher than the cost of producing it, making it unaffordable 
for some people who would benefit from it.
 • Some goods, by their very nature, are unsuited for efficient management by 
markets. An example of such a good is air traffic control.

just when markets work but also when they don’t work, and to judge what govern-
ment policies are appropriate in each situation.

RESTORING EQUILIBRIUM ON THE FREEWAYS
B
ack in 1994 a powerful earthquake struck the Los Angeles area, causing 
several freeway bridges to collapse and thereby disrupting the normal com-
muting routes of hundreds of thousands of drivers. The events that followed offer 
a particularly clear example of interdependent decision making—in this case, the 
decisions of commuters about how to get to work.
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, there 
was great concern about the impact on traffic, since 
motorists would now have to crowd onto alternative 
routes or detour around the blockages by using city 
streets. Public officials and news programs warned 
commuters to expect massive delays and urged them to 
avoid unnecessary travel, reschedule their work to com-
mute before or after the rush, or use mass transit. These 
warnings were unexpectedly effective. In fact, so many 
people heeded them that in the first few days following 
the quake, those who maintained their regular commut-
ing routine actually found the drive to and from work 
faster than before.
Of course, this situation could not last. As word spread 
that traffic was relatively light, people abandoned their 
less convenient new commuting methods and reverted to 
their cars—and traffic got steadily worse. Within a few weeks after the quake, 
serious traffic jams had appeared. After a few more weeks, however, the situa-
tion stabilized: the reality of worse-than-usual congestion discouraged enough 
drivers to prevent the nightmare of citywide gridlock from materializing. Los 
Angeles traffic, in short, had settled into a new equilibrium, in which each 
commuter was making the best choice he or she could, given what everyone 
else was doing.
This was not, by the way, the end of the story: fears that the city would strangle 
on traffic led local authorities to repair the roads with record speed. Within only 
18 months after the quake, all the freeways were back to normal, ready for the 
next one.

 Quick Review
• Most economic situations involve 
the interaction of choices, some-
times with unintended results. In a 
market economy, interaction occurs 
via trade between individuals.
• Individuals trade because there are 
gains from trade, which arise from 
specialization. Markets usually 
move toward equilibrium because 
people exploit gains from trade.
• To achieve society’s goals, the use 
of resources should be efficient. 
But equity, as well as efficiency, 
may be desirable in an economy. 
There is often a trade-off between 
equity and efficiency.
• Except for certain well-defined excep-
tions, markets are normally efficient. 
When markets fail to achieve effi-
ciency, government intervention can 
improve society’s welfare.

Economy-Wide Interactions
As we mentioned in the Introduction, the economy as a whole 
has its ups and downs. For example, business in America’s 
shopping malls was depressed in 2008, because the economy 
was in a recession. By 2011, the economy had somewhat recov-
ered. To understand recessions and recoveries, we need to 
understand economy-wide interactions, and understanding 
the big picture of the economy requires understanding three 
more important economic principles. Those three economy-
wide principles are summarized in Table 1-3.
Principle #10: One Person’s Spending Is Another 
Person’s Income
In 2006, home construction in America began a rapid decline because builders 
found it increasingly hard to make sales. At first the damage was mainly limited 
to the construction industry. But over time the slump spread into just about every 
part of the economy, with consumer spending falling across the board.
But why should a fall in home construction mean empty stores in the shop-
ping malls? After all, malls are places where families, not builders, do their shop-
ping. The answer is that lower spending on construction led to lower incomes 
throughout the economy; people who had been employed either directly in 
construction, producing goods and services builders need (like wallboard), or in 
producing goods and services new homeowners need (like new furniture), either 
lost their jobs or were forced to take pay cuts. And as incomes fell, so did spending 
by consumers. This example illustrates our tenth principle:
One person’s spending is another person’s income.
In a market economy, people make a living selling things—including their labor—
to other people. If some group in the economy decides, for whatever reason, to 
spend more, the income of other groups will rise. If some group decides to spend 
less, the income of other groups will fall.
Because one person’s spending is another person’s income, a chain reaction of 
changes in spending behavior tends to have repercussions that spread through the 
economy. For example, a cut in business investment spending, like the one that 
happened in 2008, leads to reduced family incomes; families respond by reducing con-
sumer spending; this leads to another round of income cuts; and so on. These reper-
cussions play an important role in our understanding of recessions and recoveries.
Principle #11: Overall Spending Sometimes Gets Out 
of Line with the Economy’s Productive Capacity
Macroeconomics emerged as a separate branch of economics in the 1930s, 
when a collapse of consumer and business spending, a crisis in the banking 
industry, and other factors led to a plunge in overall spending. This plunge in 
TABLE   1-3    The Principles of Economy-
Wide Interactions
10.  One person’s spending is another person’s income.
11.  Overall spending sometimes gets out of line with 
the economy’s productive capacity.
12. Government policies can change spending.

C H A P T E R  1    FI R S T  P R I N C I P L E S    19
spending, in turn, led to a period of very high unemployment known as the 
Great Depression.
The lesson economists learned from the troubles of the 1930s is that overall 
spending—the amount of goods and services that consumers and businesses 
want to buy—sometimes doesn’t match the amount of goods and services the 
economy is capable of producing. In the 1930s, spending fell far short of what 
was needed to keep American workers employed, and the result was a severe 
economic slump. In fact, shortfalls in spending are responsible for most, though 
not all, recessions.
It’s also possible for overall spending to be too high. In that case, the econ-
omy experiences inflation, a rise in prices throughout the economy. This rise in 
prices occurs because when the amount that people want to buy outstrips the 
supply, producers can raise their prices and still find willing customers. Taking 
account of both shortfalls in spending and excesses in spending brings us to our 
eleventh principle:
Overall spending sometimes gets out of line with the economy’s pro-
ductive capacity. 
Principle #12: Government Policies Can 
Change Spending
Overall spending sometimes gets out of line with the economy’s productive capac-
ity. But can anything be done about that? Yes—which leads to our twelfth and 
last principle:
Government policies can change spending.
In fact, government policies can dramatically affect spending.
For one thing, the government itself does a lot of spending on everything 
from military equipment to education—and it can choose to do more or less. 
The government can also vary how much it collects from the public in taxes, 
which in turn affects how much income consumers and businesses have left to 
spend. And the government’s control of the quantity of money in circulation, 
it turns out, gives it another powerful tool with which to affect total spending. 
Government spending, taxes, and control of money are the tools of macroeco-
nomic policy.
Modern governments deploy these macroeconomic policy tools in an effort to 
manage overall spending in the economy, trying to steer it between the perils of 
recession and inflation. These efforts aren’t always successful—recessions still 
happen, and so do periods of inflation. But it’s widely believed that aggressive 
efforts to sustain spending in 2008 and 2009 helped prevent the financial crisis 
of 2008 from turning into a full-blown depression.

ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING
T
he website, myarmyonesource.com, which offers advice to army families, 
suggests that parents join a babysitting cooperative—an arrangement that 
is common in many walks of life. In a babysitting cooperative, a number of 
parents exchange babysitting services rather than hire someone to babysit. But 
how do these organizations make sure that all members do their fair share of 
the work? As myarmyonesource.com explained, “Instead of money, most co-ops 
exchange tickets or points. When you need a sitter, you call a friend on the list, 
and you pay them with tickets. You earn tickets by babysitting other children 
within the co-op.”

20    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
In other words, a babysitting co-op is a miniature economy in which 
people buy and sell babysitting services. And it happens to be a type of 
economy that can have macroeconomic problems. A famous article titled 
“Monetary Theory and the Great Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-Op Crisis,” 
published in 1977, described the troubles of a babysitting cooperative that 
issued too few tickets. Bear in mind that, on average, people in a babysitting 
co-op want to have a reserve of tickets stashed away in case they need to go 
out several times before they can replenish their stash by doing some more 
babysitting.
In this case, because there weren’t that many tickets out there to begin with, 
most parents were anxious to add to their reserves by babysitting but reluctant 
to run them down by going out. But one parent’s decision to go out was another’s 
chance to babysit, so it became difficult to earn tickets. Knowing this, parents 
became even more reluctant to use their reserves except on special occasions.
In short, the co-op had fallen into a recession. Recessions in the larger, 
nonbabysitting economy are a bit more complicated than this, but the troubles 
of the Capitol Hill babysitting co-op demonstrate two of our three principles of 
economy-wide interactions. One person’s spending is another person’s income: 
opportunities to babysit arose only to the extent that other people went out. 
And an economy can suffer from too little spending: when not enough people 
were willing to go out, everyone was frustrated at the lack of babysitting 
opportunities.
And what about government policies to change spending? Actually, the 
Capitol Hill co-op did that, too. Eventually, it solved its problem by hand-
ing out more tickets, and with increased reserves, people were willing to 
go out more.

 Quick Review

In 2001 and 2002, the travel industry was in deep trouble. After the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001, many people simply stopped flying. As the econ-
omy went into a deep slump, airplanes sat empty on the tarmac and the airlines 
lost billions of dollars. When several major airlines spiraled toward bankruptcy 
and laid off 100,000 workers, Congress passed a $15 billion aid package that 
proved to be critical in stabilizing the airline industry.
This was also a particularly difficult time for Priceline.com, the online travel 
service. Just four years after its founding, Priceline.com was in danger of going 
under. The change in the company’s fortunes had been dramatic. In 1999, one 
year after Priceline.com was formed, investors were so impressed by its potential 
for revolutionizing the travel industry that they valued the company at $9 billion 
dollars. But by 2002 investors had taken a decidedly dimmer view of the com-
pany, reducing its valuation by 95% to only $425 million.
To make matters worse, Priceline.com was losing several million dollars a 
year. Yet the company managed to survive; as of the time of writing in 2010, it 
was valued by investors at $8.8 billion. Not only has it survived, it has thrived.
So exactly how did Priceline.com bring such dramatic change to the travel 
industry? And what has allowed it to survive and prosper as a company in the face 
of dire economic conditions?
Priceline.com’s success lies in its ability to spot exploitable opportunities for 
itself and its customers. The company understood that when a plane departs with 
empty seats or a hotel has empty beds, it bears a cost—the revenue that would 
have been earned if that seat or bed had been filled. And although some travelers 
like the security of booking their flights and hotels well in advance and are will-
ing to pay for that, others are quite happy to wait until the last minute, risking not 
getting the flight or hotel they want but enjoying a lower price.
Customers specify the price they are willing to pay for a given trip or hotel 
location, and then Priceline.com presents them with a list of options from airlines 
or hotels that are willing to accept that price, with the price typically declining 
as the date of the trip nears. By bringing airlines and hotels with unsold capacity 
together with travelers who are willing to sacrifice some of their preferences for 
a lower price, Priceline.com made everyone better off—including itself, since it 
charged a small commission for each trade it facilitated.
Priceline.com was also quick on its feet when it saw its market challenged 
by newcomers Expedia and Orbitz. In response, it began aggressively moving 
more of its business toward hotel bookings and into Europe, where the online 
travel industry was still quite small. Its network was particularly valuable in the 
European hotel market, which is comprised of many more small hotels in com-
parison to the U.S. market, which is dominated by nationwide chains. The efforts 
paid off, and by 2003 Priceline.com had turned its first profit.
Priceline.com now operates within a network of more than 100,000 hotels in 
over 90 countries. As of 2010, its revenues had grown at least 24% over each of the 
previous three years, even growing 34% during the 2008 recession.
Clearly, the travel industry will never be the same again.

 1. All economic analysis is based on a set of basic prin-
ciples that apply to three levels of economic activity. 
First, we study how individuals make choices; second, 
we study how these choices interact; and third, we 
study how the economy functions overall.
 2. Everyone has to make choices about what to do 
and what not to do. Individual choice is the basis 
of economics—if it doesn’t involve choice, it isn’t 
economics.
 3. The reason choices must be made is that resources—
anything that can be used to produce something 
else—are scarce. Individuals are limited in 
their choices by money and time; economies are 
limited by their supplies of human and natural 
resources.
 4. Because you must choose among limited alternatives, 
the true cost of anything is what you must give up to 
get it—all costs are opportunity costs.
 5. Many economic decisions involve questions not of 
“whether” but of “how much”—how much to spend 
on some good, how much to produce, and so on. 
Such decisions must be made by performing a 
trade-off at the margin—by comparing the costs and 
benefits of doing a bit more or a bit less. Decisions 
of this type are called marginal decisions, and the 
study of them, marginal analysis, plays a central 
role in economics.
 6. The study of how people should make decisions is also 
a good way to understand actual behavior. Individuals 
usually respond to incentives—exploiting opportuni-
ties to make themselves better off.
 7. The next level of economic analysis is the study 
of interaction—how my choices depend on your 
choices, and vice versa. When individuals interact, 
the end result may be different from what anyone 
intends.
 8. Individuals interact because there are gains from 
trade: by engaging in the trade of goods and services 
with one another, the members of an economy can all 
be made better off. Specialization—each person spe-
cializes in the task he or she is good at—is the source 
of gains from trade.
 9. Because individuals usually respond to incentives, 
markets normally move toward equilibrium—
a situation in which no individual can make 
himself or herself better off by taking a different 
action.
 10. An economy is efficient if all opportunities to 
make some people better off without making 
other people worse off are taken. Resources 
should be used as efficiently as possible to achieve 
society’s goals. But efficiency is not the sole way to 
evaluate an economy: equity, or fairness, is also 
desirable, and there is often a trade-off between 
equity and efficiency.
 11. Markets usually lead to efficiency, with some well-
defined exceptions.
 12. When markets fail and do not achieve efficiency, 
government intervention can improve society’s 
welfare.
 13. Because people in a market economy earn income 
by selling things, including their own labor, one per-
son’s spending is another person’s income. As a result, 
changes in spending behavior can spread throughout 
the economy.
 14. Overall spending in the economy can get out of line 
with the economy’s productive capacity. Spending 
below the economy’s productive capacity leads to a 
recession; spending in excess of the economy’s produc-
tive capacity leads to inflation.
 15. Governments have the ability to strongly affect 
overall spending, an ability they use in an effort 
to steer the economy between recession and 
inflation.

the McCoys specialize in raising chickens, the 
Hatfields specialize in growing corn, and the two 
families trade.
 8. Which of the following situations describes an equilib-
rium? Which does not? If the situation does not describe 
an equilibrium, what would an equilibrium look like?
 a. Many people regularly commute from the suburbs to 
downtown Pleasantville. Due to traffic congestion, 
the trip takes 30 minutes when you travel by high-
way but only 15 minutes when you go by side streets.
 b. At the intersection of Main and Broadway are two 
gas stations. One station charges $3.00 per gallon for 
regular gas and the other charges $2.85 per gallon. 
Customers can get service immediately at the first 
station but must wait in a long line at the second.
 c. Every student enrolled in Economics 101 must also 
attend a weekly tutorial. This year there are two sec-
tions offered: section A and section B, which meet at the 
same time in adjoining classrooms and are taught by 
equally competent instructors. Section A is overcrowd-
ed, with people sitting on the floor and often unable to 
see the chalkboard. Section B has many empty seats.
 9. In each of the following cases, explain whether you think 
the situation is efficient or not. If it is not efficient, why 
not? What actions would make the situation efficient?
 a. Electricity is included in the rent at your dorm. Some 
residents in your dorm leave lights, computers, and 
appliances on when they are not in their rooms.
 b. Although they cost the same amount to prepare, 
the cafeteria in your dorm consistently provides too 
many dishes that diners don’t like, such as tofu cas-
serole, and too few dishes that diners do like, such 
as roast turkey with dressing.
 c. The enrollment for a particular course exceeds the 
spaces available. Some students who need to take 
this course to complete their major are unable to get 
a space even though others who are taking it as an 
elective do get a space.
 10. Discuss the efficiency and equity implications of each 
of the following policies. How would you go about 
balancing the concerns of equity and efficiency in 
these areas?
 a. The government pays the full tuition for every college 
student to study whatever subject he or she wishes.
 b. When people lose their jobs, the government provides 
unemployment benefits until they find new ones.
 11. Governments often adopt certain policies in order to 
promote desired behavior among their citizens. For 
each of the following policies, determine what the 
incentive is and what behavior the government wishes 
to promote. In each case, why do you think that the 
government might wish to change people’s behavior, 
rather than allow their actions to be solely determined 
by individual choice?
 a. A tax of $5 per pack is imposed on cigarettes.
 b. The government pays parents $100 when their child 
is vaccinated for measles.
 c. The government pays college students to tutor chil-
dren from low-income families.
 d. The government imposes a tax on the amount of air 
pollution that a company discharges.
 12. In each of the following situations, explain how govern-
ment intervention could improve society’s welfare by 
changing people’s incentives. In what sense is the mar-
ket going wrong?
 a. Pollution from auto emissions has reached 
unhealthy levels.
 b. Everyone in Woodville would be better off if street-
lights were installed in the town. But no individual 
resident is willing to pay for installation of a street-
light in front of his or her house because it is impos-
sible to recoup the cost by charging other residents 
for the benefit they receive from it.
 13. On August 2, 2010, Tim Geithner, the Treasury secre-
tary, published an article defending the administra-
tion’s policies. In it he said, “The recession that began 
in late 2007 was extraordinarily severe. But the actions 
we took at its height to stimulate the economy helped 
arrest the free fall, preventing an even deeper collapse 
and putting the economy on the road to recovery.”
Which two of the three principles of economy-wide 
interaction are at work in this statement?
 14. In August 2007, a sharp downturn in the U.S. housing 
market reduced the income of many who worked in the 
home construction industry. A Wall Street Journal news 
article reported that Walmart’s wire-transfer business 
was likely to suffer because many construction workers 
are Hispanics who regularly send part of their wages back 
to relatives in their home countries via Walmart. With this 
information, use one of the principles of economy-wide 
interaction to trace a chain of links that explains how 
reduced spending for U.S. home purchases is likely to 
affect the performance of the Mexican economy.
 15. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused massive destruction 
to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Tens of thousands of people lost 
their homes and possessions. Even those who weren’t 
directly affected by the destruction were hurt because 
businesses failed or contracted and jobs dried up. Using 
one of the principles of economy-wide interaction, explain 
how government intervention can help in this situation.
 16. During the Great Depression, food was left to rot in the 
fields or fields that had once been actively cultivated were 
left fallow. Use one of the principles of economy-wide 
interaction to explain how this could have occurred.

newest jet, the 787 Dreamliner, 
took its first three-hour test flight. It 
was a historic moment: the Dreamliner 
was the result of an aerodynamic 
revolution—a superefficient airplane 
designed to cut airline operating costs 
and the first to use superlight composite 
materials. To ensure that the Dreamliner 
was sufficiently lightweight and aerody-
namic, it underwent over 15,000 hours of 
wind tunnel tests—tests that resulted in 
subtle design changes that improved its 
performance, making it 20% more fuel 
efficient and 20% less pollutant emitting 
than existing passenger jets. 
The first flight of the Dreamliner 
was a spectacular advance from the 
1903 maiden voyage of the Wright Flyer, 
the first successful powered airplane, 
in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Yet the 
Boeing engineers—and all aeronautic 
engineers—owe an enormous debt to 
the Wright Flyer’s inventors, Wilbur and 
Orville Wright. What made the Wrights 
truly visionary was their invention of the 
wind tunnel, an apparatus that let them 
experiment with many different designs 
for wings and control surfaces. Doing 
experiments with a miniature airplane, 
inside a wind tunnel the size of a ship-
ping crate, gave the Wright Brothers the 
knowledge that would make heavier-
than-air flight possible.
Neither a miniature airplane inside 
a packing crate nor a miniature model 
of the Dreamliner inside Boeing’s state-
of-the-art Transonic Wind Tunnel is the 
same thing as an actual aircraft in flight. 
But it is a very useful model of a fly-
ing plane—a simplified representation 
of the real thing that can be used to 
answer crucial questions, such as how 
much lift a given wing shape will gener-
ate at a given airspeed.
Needless to say, testing an airplane 
design in a wind tunnel is cheaper and 
safer than building a full-scale version 
and hoping it will fly. More generally, 
models play a crucial role in almost all 
scientific research—economics very 
much included.
In fact, you could say that economic 
theory consists mainly of a collection of 
models, a series of simplified representa-
tions of economic reality that allow us to 
understand a variety of economic issues. 
In this chapter, we’ll look at two eco-
nomic models that are crucially impor-
tant in their own right and also illustrate 
why such models are so useful. We’ll 
conclude with a look at how economists 
actually use models in their work. 
The Wright Brothers’ model made modern airplanes, including 
the Dreamliner, possible.

Models in Economics: Some 
Important Examples
A 
model is any simplified representation of reality that is used to better 
understand real-life situations. But how do we create a simplified represen-
tation of an economic situation?
One possibility—an economist’s equivalent of a wind tunnel—is to find or 
create a real but simplified economy. For example, economists interested in the 
economic role of money have studied the system of exchange that developed in 
World War II prison camps, in which cigarettes became a universally accepted 
form of payment even among prisoners who didn’t smoke.
Another possibility is to simulate the workings of the economy on a computer. 
For example, when changes in tax law are proposed, government officials use tax 
models—large mathematical computer programs—to assess how the proposed 
changes would affect different types of people.
Models are important because their simplicity allows economists to focus 
on the effects of only one change at a time. That is, they allow us to hold every-
thing else constant and study how one change affects the overall economic 
outcome. So an important assumption when building economic models is the 
other things equal assumption, which means that all other relevant factors 
remain unchanged.
But you can’t always find or create a small-scale version of the whole economy, 
and a computer program is only as good as the data it uses. (Programmers have 
a saying: “garbage in, garbage out.”) For many purposes, the most effective form 
of economic modeling is the construction of “thought experiments”: simplified, 
hypothetical versions of real-life situations.
In Chapter 1 we illustrated the concept of equilibrium with the example 
of how customers at a supermarket would rearrange themselves when a new 
cash register opens. Though we didn’t say it, this was an example of a simple 
model—an imaginary supermarket, in which many details were ignored.
(What were customers buying? Never mind.) This simple model can be used to 
answer a “what if” question: what if another cash register were opened?
As the cash register story showed, it is often possible to describe and analyze 
a useful economic model in plain English. However, because much of economics 
involves changes in quantities—in the price of a product, the number of units 
produced, or the number of workers employed in its production—economists 
often find that using some mathematics helps clarify an issue. In particular, a 
numerical example, a simple equation, or—especially—a graph can be key to 
understanding an economic concept.
Whatever form it takes, a good economic model can be a tremendous 
aid to understanding. The best way to grasp this point is to consider some 
simple but important economic models and what they tell us. First, we will 
look at the production possibility frontier, a model that helps economists 
think about the trade-offs every economy faces. Then we will turn to com-
parative advantage, a model that clarifies the principle of gains from trade—
trade both between individuals and between countries. In addition, we’ll 
examine the circular-flow diagram, a schematic representation that helps us 
understand how flows of money, goods, and services are channeled through 
the economy.
In discussing these models, we make considerable use of graphs to repre-
sent mathematical relationships. Graphs play an important role throughout 
this book. If you are already familiar with the use of graphs, you may feel 
free to skip the appendix to this chapter, which provides a brief introduction 
to the use of graphs in economics. If not, this would be a good time to turn 
to it.
A model is a simplified 
representation of a real situation 
that is used to better understand 
real-life situations.
The other things equal 
assumption means that all other 
relevant factors remain unchanged.

Trade-offs: The Production Possibility Frontier
The first principle of economics we introduced in Chapter 1 was that resources 
are scarce and that, as a result, any economy—whether it’s an isolated group 
of a few dozen hunter-gatherers or the 6 billion people making up the twenty-
first-century global economy—faces trade-offs. No matter how lightweight the 
Boeing Dreamliner is, no matter how efficient Boeing’s assembly line, produc-
ing Dreamliners means using resources that therefore can’t be used to produce 
something else.
A model is just a model, right? So how 
much damage can it do? Economists prob-
ably would have answered that question 
quite differently before the financial melt-
down of 2008–2009 than after it. The finan-
cial crisis continues to reverberate today—a 
testament to why economic models are so 
important. For an economic model—a bad 
economic model, it turned out—played a 
significant role in the origins of the crisis.
“The model that ate the economy” 
originated in finance theory, the branch of 
economics that seeks to understand what 
assets like stocks and bonds are worth. 
Financial theorists often get hired (at very 
high salaries, mind you) to devise complex 
mathematical models to help investment 
companies decide what assets to buy and 
sell and at what price. 
Finance theory has become increasingly 
important as Wall Street (a district in New 
York City where nearly all major invest-
ment companies have their headquarters) 
has shifted from trading simple assets like 
stocks and bonds to more complex assets—
notably, mortgage-backed securities (or 
MBS’s for short). An MBS is an asset that 
entitles its owner to a stream of earnings 
based on the payments made by thousands 
of people on their home loans. Investors 
wanted to know how risky these complex 
assets were. That is, how likely was it that 
an investor would lose money on an MBS?
Although we won’t go into the details, 
estimating the likelihood of losing money 
on an MBS is a complicated problem. It 
involves calculating the probability that 
a significant number of the thousands of 
homeowners backing your security will stop 
paying their mortgages. Until that probability 
could be calculated, investors didn’t want to 
buy MBS’s. In order to generate sales, Wall 
Street firms needed to provide potential 
MBS buyers with some estimate of their risk.
In 2000, a Wall Street financial theo-
rist announced that he had solved the 
problem by employing a huge statistical 
abstraction—assuming that current home-
owners were no more likely to stop paying 
their mortgages than in previous decades. 
With this assumption, he devised a simple 
model for estimating the risk of buying an 
MBS. Financial traders loved the model 
as it opened up a huge and extraordinarily 
profitable market for them. Using this 
simple model, Wall Street was able to cre-
ate and sell billions of MBS’s, generating 
billions in profits for itself. 
Or investors thought they had calculated 
the risk of losing money on an MBS. Some 
financial experts—particularly Darrell Duffie, 
a Stanford University finance professor—
warned from the sidelines that the estimates 
of risk calculated by this simple model were 
just plain wrong. He, and other critics, said 
that in the search for simplicity, the model 
seriously underestimated the likelihood that 
many homeowners would stop paying their 
mortgages at the same time, leaving MBS 
investors in danger of incurring huge losses.
The warnings fell on deaf ears—no doubt 
because Wall Street was making so much 
money. Billions of dollars worth of MBS’s were 
sold to investors both in the United States 
and abroad. In 2008–2009, the problems 
critics warned about exploded in catastrophic 
fashion. Over the previous decade, American 
home prices had risen too high, and mort-
gages had been extended to many who were 
unable to pay. As home prices fell to earth, 
millions of homeowners didn’t pay their mort-
gages. With losses mounting for MBS inves-
tors, it became all too clear that the model 
had indeed underestimated the risks. When 
investors and financial institutions around the 
world realized the extent of their losses, the 
worldwide economy ground to an abrupt halt. 
To this day, it has not fully recovered. 
FOR INQUIRING MINDS
THE MODEL THAT ATE THE ECONOMY
F

28    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
To think about the trade-offs that face any economy, economists often use 
the model known as the production possibility frontier. The idea behind this 
model is to improve our understanding of trade-offs by considering a simplified 
economy that produces only two goods. This simplification enables us to show 
the trade-off graphically.
Suppose, for a moment, that the United States was a one-company economy, 
with Boeing its sole employer and aircraft its only product. But there would still 
be a choice of what kinds of aircraft to produce—say, Dreamliners versus small 
commuter jets. Figure 2-1 shows a hypothetical production possibility frontier 
representing the trade-off this one-company economy would face. The frontier—
the line in the diagram—shows the maximum quantity of small jets that Boeing 
can produce per year given the quantity of Dreamliners it produces per year, and 
vice versa. That is, it answers questions of the form, “What is the maximum quan-
tity of small jets that Boeing can produce in a year if it also produces 9 (or 15, or 
30) Dreamliners that year?”
There is a crucial distinction between points inside or on the production possi-
bility frontier (the shaded area) and outside the frontier. If a production point lies 
inside or on the frontier—like point C, at which Boeing produces 20 small jets and 
9 Dreamliners in a year—it is feasible. After all, the frontier tells us that if Boeing 
produces 20 small jets, it could also produce a maximum of 15 Dreamliners that 
year, so it could certainly make 9 Dreamliners. However, a production point that 
lies outside the frontier—such as the hypothetical production point D, where 
Boeing produces 40 small jets and 30 Dreamliners—isn’t feasible. Boeing can 
produce 40 small jets and no Dreamliners, or it can produce 30 Dreamliners and 
no small jets, but it can’t do both.
In Figure 2-1 the production possibility frontier intersects the horizontal axis 
at 40 small jets. This means that if Boeing dedicated all its production capacity to 
making small jets, it could produce 40 small jets per year but could produce no 
Dreamliners. The production possibility frontier intersects the vertical axis at 30 
Dreamliners. This means that if Boeing dedicated all its production capacity to 
making Dreamliners, it could produce 30 Dreamliners per year but no small jets.
The figure also shows less extreme trade-offs. For example, if Boeing’s 
managers decide to make 20 small jets this year, they can produce at most 15 
Dreamliners; this production choice is illustrated by point A. And if Boeing’s 
The production possibility 
frontier illustrates the trade-offs 
facing an economy that produces 
only two goods. It shows the 
maximum quantity of one good 
that can be produced for any given 
quantity produced of the other.
The Production Possibility Frontier
2-1
The production possibility frontier illustrates the trade-
offs Boeing faces in producing Dreamliners and small 
jets. It shows the maximum quantity of one good that 
can be produced given the quantity of the other good 
produced. Here, the maximum quantity of Dreamliners 
manufactured per year depends on the quantity of 
small jets manufactured that year, and vice versa. 
Boeing’s feasible production is shown by the area 
inside or on the curve. Production at point C is fea-
sible but not efficient. Points A and B are feasible and 
efficient in production, but point D is not feasible.

managers decide to produce 28 small jets, they can make at most 9 Dreamliners, 
as shown by point B.
Thinking in terms of a production possibility frontier simplifies the com-
plexities of reality. The real-world U.S. economy produces millions of different 
goods. Even Boeing can produce more than two different types of planes. Yet it’s 
important to realize that even in its simplicity, this stripped-down model gives us 
important insights about the real world.
By simplifying reality, the production possibility frontier helps us understand 
some aspects of the real economy better than we could without the model: effi-
ciency, opportunity cost, and economic growth.
Efficiency First of all, the production possibility frontier is a good way to 
illustrate the general economic concept of efficiency. Recall from Chapter 1 that 
an economy is efficient if there are no missed opportunities—there is no way to 
make some people better off without making other people worse off.
One key element of efficiency is that there are no missed opportunities in 
production—there is no way to produce more of one good without producing less of 
other goods. As long as Boeing operates on its production possibility frontier, its pro-
duction is efficient. At point A, 15 Dreamliners are the maximum quantity feasible given 
that Boeing has also committed to producing 20 small jets; at point B, 9 Dreamliners 
are the maximum number that can be made given the choice to produce 28 small jets; 
and so on. But suppose for some reason that Boeing was operating at point C, making 
20 small jets and 9 Dreamliners. In this case, it would not be operating efficiently and 
would therefore be inefficient: it could be producing more of both planes.
Although we have used an example of the production choices of a one-firm, 
two-good economy to illustrate efficiency and inefficiency, these concepts also 
carry over to the real economy, which contains many firms and produces many 
goods. If the economy as a whole could not produce more of any one good with-
out producing less of something else—that is, if it is on its production possibility 
frontier—then we say that the economy is efficient in production. If, however, the 
economy could produce more of some things without producing less of others—
which typically means that it could produce more of everything—then it is ineffi-
cient in production. For example, an economy in which large numbers of workers 
are involuntarily unemployed is clearly inefficient in production. And that’s a bad 
thing, because the economy could be producing more useful goods and services.
Although the production possibility frontier helps clarify what it means for an 
economy to be efficient in production, it’s important to understand that efficiency 
in production is only part of what’s required for the economy as a whole to be 
efficient. Efficiency also requires that the economy allocate its resources so that 
consumers are as well off as possible. If an economy does this, we say that it is effi-
cient in allocation. To see why efficiency in allocation is as important as efficiency 
in production, notice that points A and B in Figure 2-1 both represent situations in 
which the economy is efficient in production, because in each case it can’t produce 
more of one good without producing less of the other. But these two situations may 
not be equally desirable from society’s point of view. Suppose that society prefers to 
have more small jets and fewer Dreamliners than at point A; say, it prefers to have 
28 small jets and 9 Dreamliners, corresponding to point B. In this case, point A is 
inefficient in allocation from the point of view of the economy as a whole because 
it would rather have Boeing produce at point B rather than at point A.
This example shows that efficiency for the economy as a whole requires both 
efficiency in production and efficiency in allocation: to be efficient, an economy 
must produce as much of each good as it can given the production of other goods, 
and it must also produce the mix of goods that people want to consume. (And it 
must also deliver those goods to the right people: an economy that gives small 
jets to international airlines and Dreamliners to commuter airlines serving small 
rural airports is inefficient, too.)

30    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
In the real world, command economies, such as the former Soviet Union, are 
notorious for inefficiency in allocation. For example, it was common for consum-
ers to find stores well stocked with items few people wanted but lacking such 
basics as soap and toilet paper.
Opportunity Cost The production possibility frontier is also useful as a reminder of 
the fundamental point that the true cost of any good isn’t the money it costs to buy, but 
what must be given up in order to get that good—the opportunity cost. If, for example, 
Boeing decides to change its production from point A to point B, it will produce 8 
more small jets but 6 fewer Dreamliners. So the opportunity cost of 8 small jets is 6 
Dreamliners—the 6 Dreamliners that must be forgone in order to produce 8 more small 
jets. This means that each small jet has an opportunity cost of 6/8 = 3/4 of a Dreamliner.
Is the opportunity cost of an extra small jet in terms of Dreamliners always the 
same, no matter how many small jets and Dreamliners are currently produced? 
In the example illustrated by Figure 2-1, the answer is yes. If Boeing increases its 
production of small jets from 28 to 40, the number of Dreamliners it produces falls 
from 9 to zero. So Boeing’s opportunity cost per additional small jet is 9/12 = 3/4 of 
a Dreamliner, the same as it was when Boeing went from 20 small jets produced 
to 28. However, the fact that in this example the opportunity cost of a small jet in 
terms of a Dreamliner is always the same is a result of an assumption we’ve made, 
an assumption that’s reflected in how Figure 2-1 is drawn. Specifically, whenever 
we assume that the opportunity cost of an additional unit of a good doesn’t change 
regardless of the output mix, the production possibility frontier is a straight line.
Moreover, as you might have already guessed, the slope of a straight-line 
production possibility frontier is equal to the opportunity cost—specifically, the 
opportunity cost for the good measured on the horizontal axis in terms of the 
good measured on the vertical axis. In Figure 2-1, the production possibility fron-
tier has a constant slope of −3/4, implying that Boeing faces a constant opportunity 
cost for 1 small jet equal to 3/4 of a Dreamliner. (A review of how to calculate the 
slope of a straight line is found in this chapter’s appendix.) This is the simplest 
case, but the production possibility frontier model can also be used to examine 
situations in which opportunity costs change as the mix of output changes.
Figure 2-2 illustrates a different assumption, a case in which Boeing faces 
increasing opportunity cost. Here, the more small jets it produces, the more 
costly it is to produce yet another small jet in terms of forgone production of a 
Increasing Opportunity Cost
2-2
The bowed-out shape of the production pos-
sibility frontier reflects increasing opportunity 
cost. In this example, to produce the first 20 
small jets, Boeing must forgo producing 5 
Dreamliners. But to produce an additional 20 
small jets, Boeing must forgo manufacturing 
25 more Dreamliners.

Dreamliner. And the same holds true in reverse: the more Dreamliners Boeing 
produces, the more costly it is to produce yet another Dreamliner in terms of for-
gone production of small jets. For example, to go from producing zero small jets 
to producing 20, Boeing has to forgo producing 5 Dreamliners. That is, the oppor-
tunity cost of those 20 small jets is 5 Dreamliners. But to increase its production 
of small jets to 40—that is, to produce an additional 20 small jets—it must forgo 
producing 25 more Dreamliners, a much higher opportunity cost. As you can see 
in Figure 2-2, when opportunity costs are increasing rather than constant, the 
production possibility frontier is a bowed-out curve rather than a straight line.
Although it’s often useful to work with the simple assumption that the pro-
duction possibility frontier is a straight line, economists believe that in reality 
opportunity costs are typically increasing. When only a small amount of a good 
is produced, the opportunity cost of producing that good is relatively low because 
the economy needs to use only those resources that are especially well suited for 
its production. For example, if an economy grows only a small amount of corn, 
that corn can be grown in places where the soil and climate are perfect for corn-
growing but less suitable for growing anything else, like wheat. So growing that 
corn involves giving up only a small amount of potential wheat output. Once the 
economy grows a lot of corn, however, land that is well suited for wheat but isn’t 
so great for corn must be used to produce corn anyway. As a result, the additional 
corn production involves sacrificing considerably more wheat production. In other 
words, as more of a good is produced, its opportunity cost typically rises because 
well-suited inputs are used up and less adaptable inputs must be used instead.
Economic Growth Finally, the production possibility frontier helps us under-
stand what it means to talk about economic growth. We introduced the concept 
of economic growth in the Introduction, defining it as the growing ability of the 
economy to produce goods and services. As we saw, economic growth is one of the 
fundamental features of the real economy. But are we really justified in saying that 
the economy has grown over time? After all, although the U.S. economy produces 
more of many things than it did a century ago, it produces less of other things—
for example, horse-drawn carriages. Production of many goods, in other words, is 
actually down. So how can we say for sure that the economy as a whole has grown?
The answer is illustrated in Figure 2-3, where we have drawn two hypothetical 
production possibility frontiers for the economy. In them we have assumed once

Economic growth results in an outward shift of the 
production possibility frontier because production 
possibilities are expanded. The economy can now 
produce more of everything. For example, if pro-
duction is initially at point A (25 Dreamliners and 
20 small jets), economic growth means that the 
economy could move to point E (30 Dreamliners 
and 25 small jets).

again that everyone in the economy works for Boeing and, consequently, the econo-
my produces only two goods, Dreamliners and small jets. Notice how the two curves 
are nested, with the one labeled “Original PPF” lying completely inside the one 
labeled “New PPF.” Now we can see graphically what we mean by economic growth 
of the economy: economic growth means an expansion of the economy’s production 
possibilities; that is, the economy can produce more of everything. For example, if 
the economy initially produces at point A (25 Dreamliners and 20 small jets), eco-
nomic growth means that the economy could move to point E (30 Dreamliners and 
25 small jets). E lies outside the original frontier; so in the production possibility 
frontier model, growth is shown as an outward shift of the frontier.
What can lead the production possibility frontier to shift outward? There are basi-
cally two sources of economic growth. One is an increase in the economy’s factors of 
production, the resources used to produce goods and services. Economists usually 
use the term factor of production to refer to a resource that is not used up in production. 
For example, in traditional airplane manufacture workers used riveting machines to 
connect metal sheets when constructing a plane’s fuselage; the workers and the riveters 
are factors of production, but the rivets and the sheet metal are not. Once a fuselage is 
made, a worker and riveter can be used to make another fuselage, but the sheet metal 
and rivets used to make one fuselage cannot be used to make another.
Broadly speaking, the main factors of production are the resources land, 
labor, physical capital, and human capital. Land is a resource supplied by nature; 
labor is the economy’s pool of workers; physical capital refers to created resources 
such as machines and buildings; and human capital refers to the educational 
achievements and skills of the labor force, which enhance its productivity. Of 
course, each of these is really a category rather than a single factor: land in North 
Dakota is quite different from land in Florida.
To see how adding to an economy’s factors of production leads to economic 
growth, suppose that Boeing builds another construction hangar that allows it to 
increase the number of planes—small jets or Dreamliners or both—it can pro-
duce in a year. The new construction hangar is a factor of production, a resource 
Boeing can use to increase its yearly output. We can’t say how many more planes 
of each type Boeing will produce; that’s a management decision that will depend 
on, among other things, customer demand. But we can say that Boeing’s produc-
tion possibility frontier has shifted outward because it can now produce more 
small jets without reducing the number of Dreamliners it makes, or it can make 
more Dreamliners without reducing the number of small jets produced.
The other source of economic growth is progress in technology, the technical 
means for the production of goods and services. Composite materials had been 
used in some parts of aircraft before the Boeing Dreamliner was developed. But 
Boeing engineers realized that there were large additional advantages to building 
a whole plane out of composites. The plane would be lighter, stronger, and have 
better aerodynamics than a plane built in the traditional way. It would therefore 
have longer range, be able to carry more people, and use less fuel, in addition 
to being able to maintain higher cabin pressure. So in a real sense Boeing’s 
innovation—a whole plane built out of composites—was a way to do more with 
any given amount of resources, pushing out the production possibility frontier.
Because improved jet technology has pushed out the production possibility 
frontier, it has made it possible for the economy to produce more of everything, 
not just jets and air travel. Over the past 30 years, the biggest technological 
advances have taken place in information technology, not in construction or food 
services. Yet Americans have chosen to buy bigger houses and eat out more than 
they used to because the economy’s growth has made it possible to do so.
The production possibility frontier is a very simplified model of an economy. 
Yet it teaches us important lessons about real-life economies. It gives us our first 
clear sense of what constitutes economic efficiency, it illustrates the concept of 
opportunity cost, and it makes clear what economic growth is all about.
Factors of production are 
resources used to produce goods 
and services.
Technology is the technical means 
for producing goods and services.

Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade
Among the twelve principles of economics described in Chapter 1 was the 
principle of gains from trade—the mutual gains that individuals can achieve by 
specializing in doing different things and trading with one another. Our second 
illustration of an economic model is a particularly useful model of gains from 
trade—trade based on comparative advantage.
One of the most important insights in all of economics is that there are gains 
from trade—that it makes sense to produce the things you’re especially good at 
producing and to buy from other people the things you aren’t as good at produc-
ing. This would be true even if you could produce everything for yourself: even 
if a brilliant brain surgeon could repair her own dripping faucet, it’s probably a 
better idea for her to call in a professional plumber.
How can we model the gains from trade? Let’s stay with our aircraft example 
and once again imagine that the United States is a one-company economy where 
everyone works for Boeing, producing airplanes. Let’s now assume, however, 
that the United States has the ability to trade with Brazil—another one-company 
economy where everyone works for the Brazilian aircraft company Embraer, 
which is, in the real world, a successful producer of small commuter jets. (If you 
fly from one major U.S. city to another, your plane is likely to be a Boeing, but if 
you fly into a small city, the odds are good that your plane will be an Embraer.)
In our example, the only two goods produced are large jets and small jets. Both 
countries could produce both kinds of jets. But as we’ll see in a moment, they can 
gain by producing different things and trading with each other. For the purposes of 
this example, let’s return to the simpler case of straight-line production possibility 
frontiers. America’s production possibilities are represented by the production possi-
bility frontier in panel (a) of Figure 2-4, which is similar to the production possibility 
frontier in Figure 2-1. According to this diagram, the United States can produce 
40 small jets if it makes no large jets and can manufacture 30 large jets if it produces 
no small jets. Recall that this means that the slope of the U.S. production possibility 
frontier is −3/4: its opportunity cost of 1 small jet is 3/4 of a large jet.

Here, both the United States and Brazil have a constant 
opportunity cost of small jets, illustrated by a straight-
line production possibility frontier. For the United States, 
each small jet has an opportunity cost of 3⁄4 of a large 
jet. Brazil has an opportunity cost of a small jet equal to 
1⁄3 of a large jet.

34    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
Panel (b) of Figure 2-4 shows Brazil’s production possibilities. Like the United 
States, Brazil’s production possibility frontier is a straight line, implying a con-
stant opportunity cost of a small jet in terms of large jets. Brazil’s production 
possibility frontier has a constant slope of – 1/3. Brazil can’t produce as much of 
anything as the United States can: at most it can produce 30 small jets or 10 large 
jets. But it is relatively better at manufacturing small jets than 
the United States; whereas the United States sacrifices 3/4 of a 
large jet per small jet produced, for Brazil the opportunity cost 
of a small jet is only 1/3 of a large jet. Table 2-1 summarizes the 
two countries’ opportunity costs of small jets and large jets.
Now, the United States and Brazil could each choose to 
make their own large and small jets, not trading any airplanes 
and consuming only what each produced within its own coun-
try. (A country “consumes” an airplane when it is owned by a 
domestic resident.) Let’s suppose that the two countries start out this way and make 
the consumption choices shown in Figure 2-4: in the absence of trade, the United 
States produces and consumes 16 small jets and 18 large jets per year, while Brazil 
produces and consumes 6 small jets and 8 large jets per year.
But is this the best the two countries can do? No, it isn’t. Given that the two 
producers—and therefore the two countries—have different opportunity costs, 
the United States and Brazil can strike a deal that makes both of them better off.
Table 2-2 shows how such a deal works: the United States specializes in 
the production of large jets, manufacturing 30 per year, and sells 10 to Brazil. 
Meanwhile, Brazil specializes in the production of small jets, producing 30 per 
year, and sells 20 to the United States. The result is shown in Figure 2-5. The 
United States now consumes more of both small jets and large jets than before: 
instead of 16 small jets and 18 large jets, it now consumes 20 small jets and 20 
large jets. Brazil also consumes more, going from 6 small jets and 8 large jets to 
10 small jets and 10 large jets. As Table 2-2 also shows, both the United States and 
Brazil reap gains from trade, consuming more of both types of plane than they 
would have without trade.

Both countries are better off when they each specialize in what they are 
good at and trade. It’s a good idea for the United States to specialize in the pro-
duction of large jets because its opportunity cost of a large jet is smaller than 
Brazil’s: 4/3 < 3. Correspondingly, Brazil should specialize in the production of 
small jets because its opportunity cost of a small jet is smaller than the United 
States: 1/3 < 3/4.
What we would say in this case is that the United States has a comparative 
advantage in the production of large jets and Brazil has a comparative advantage 
in the production of small jets. A country has a comparative advantage in 
producing something if the opportunity cost of that production is lower for that 
country than for other countries. The same concept applies to firms and people: a 
firm or an individual has a comparative advantage in producing something if its, 
his, or her opportunity cost of production is lower than for others.
A country has a comparative 
advantage in producing a good 
or service if its opportunity cost of 
producing the good or service is 
lower than other countries’. Likewise, 
an individual has a comparative 
advantage in producing a good or 
service if his or her opportunity cost 
of producing the good or service is 
lower than for other people.

One point of clarification before we proceed further. You may have wondered 
why the United States traded 10 large jets to Brazil in return for 20 small jets. Why 
not some other deal, like trading 10 large jets for 12 small jets? The answer to that 
question has two parts. First, there may indeed be other trades that the United States 
and Brazil might agree to. Second, there are some deals that we can safely rule out—
one like 10 large jets for 10 small jets. 
To understand why, reexamine Table 2-1 and consider the United States first. With-
out trading with Brazil, the U.S. opportunity cost of a small jet is 3/4 of a large jet. So 
it’s clear that the United States will not accept any trade that requires it to give up 
more than 3/4 of a large jet for a small jet. Trading 10 jets in return for 12 small jets 
would require the United States to pay an opportunity cost of 10/12 = 5/6 of a large jet 
for a small jet. Because 5/6 > than 3/4, this is a deal that the United States would reject. 
Similarly, Brazil won’t accept a trade that gives it less than 1/3 of a large jet for a small jet. 
The point to remember is that the United States and Brazil will be willing 
to trade only if the “price” of the good each country obtains in the trade is less 
than its own opportunity cost of producing the good domestically. Moreover, 
this is a general statement that is true whenever two parties—countries, firms, 
or individuals—trade voluntarily.
While our story clearly simplifies reality, it teaches us some very important 
lessons that apply to the real economy, too.
First, the model provides a clear illustration of the gains from trade: through 
specialization and trade, both countries produce more and consume more than 
if they were self-sufficient.
Second, the model demonstrates a very important point that is often overlooked 
in real-world arguments: each country has a comparative advantage in producing 
something. This applies to firms and people as well: everyone has a comparative 
advantage in something, and everyone has a comparative disadvantage in something.
Crucially, in our example it doesn’t matter if, as is probably the case in real 
life, U.S. workers are just as good as or even better than Brazilian workers at 
producing small jets. Suppose that the United States is actually better than 
Brazil at all kinds of aircraft production. In that case, we would say that the

By specializing and trading, the United States and Brazil 
can produce and consume more of both large jets and 
small jets. The United States specializes in manufacturing 
large jets, its comparative advantage, and Brazil—which 
has an absolute disadvantage in both goods but a com-
parative advantage in small jets—specializes in manufac-
turing small jets. With trade, both countries can consume 
more of both goods than either could without trade.

36    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
United States has an absolute advantage in both large-jet and small-jet pro-
duction: in an hour, an American worker can produce more of either a large 
jet or a small jet than a Brazilian worker. You might be tempted to think that 
in that case the United States has nothing to gain from trading with the less 
productive Brazil.
But we’ve just seen that the United States can indeed benefit from trading with 
Brazil because comparative, not absolute, advantage is the basis for mutual gain. It 
doesn’t matter whether it takes Brazil more resources than the United States to 
make a small jet; what matters for trade is that for Brazil the opportunity cost of 
a small jet is lower than the U.S. opportunity cost. So Brazil, despite its absolute 
disadvantage, even in small jets, has a comparative advantage in the manufac-
ture of small jets. Meanwhile the United States, which can use its resources most 
productively by manufacturing large jets, has a comparative disadvantage in 
manufacturing small jets.
Comparative Advantage and International Trade, 
in Reality
Look at the label on a manufactured good sold in the United States, and there’s a 
good chance you will find that it was produced in some other country—in China, 
or Japan, or even in Canada, eh? On the other side, many U.S. industries sell a 
large fraction of their output overseas. (This is particularly true of agriculture, 
high technology, and entertainment.)
Should all this international exchange of goods and services be celebrated, or 
is it cause for concern? Politicians and the public often question the desirability of 
international trade, arguing that the nation should produce goods for itself rather 
than buying them from foreigners. Industries around the world demand protec-
tion from foreign competition: Japanese farmers want to keep out American rice, 
American steelworkers want to keep out European steel. And these demands are 
often supported by public opinion.
Economists, however, have a very positive view of international trade. Why? 
Because they view it in terms of comparative advantage. As we learned from 
our example of U.S. large jets and Brazilian small jets, international trade ben-
efits both countries. Each country can consume more than if it didn’t trade and 
remained self-sufficient. Moreover, these mutual gains don’t depend on each 
country being better than other countries at producing one kind of good. Even if 
one country has, say, higher output per worker in both industries—that is, even 
if one country has an absolute advantage in both industries—there are still gains 
from trade. The upcoming Global Comparison, which explains the pattern of 
clothing production throughout the global economy, illustrates just this point.
PITFALLS
MISUNDERSTANDING COMPARATIVE 
ADVANTAGE
Students do it, pundits do it, and politicians 
do it all the time: they confuse comparative 
advantage with absolute advantage. For 
example, back in the 1980s, when the U.S. 
economy seemed to be lagging behind that 
of Japan, one often heard commentators 
warn that if we didn’t improve our produc-
tivity, we would soon have no comparative 
advantage in anything.
What those commentators meant was 
that we would have no absolute advantage 
in anything—that there might come a time 
when the Japanese were better at every-
thing than we were. (It didn’t turn out that 
way, but that’s another story.) And they 
had the idea that in that case we would no 
longer be able to benefit from trade with 
Japan.
But just as Brazil, in our example, was 
able to benefit from trade with the United 
States (and vice versa) despite the fact that 
the United States was better at manufac-
turing both large and small jets, in real life 
nations can still gain from trade even if they 
are less productive in all industries than the 
countries they trade with.
A country has an absolute 
advantage in producing a good or 
service if the country can produce 
more output per worker than other 
countries. Likewise, an individual 
has an absolute advantage in 
producing a good or service if he 
or she is better at producing it than 
other people. Having an absolute 
advantage is not the same thing as 
having a comparative advantage.

Transactions: The Circular-Flow Diagram
The model economies that we’ve studied so far—each containing only one firm—are 
a huge simplification. We’ve also greatly simplified trade between the United States 
and Brazil, assuming that they engage only in the simplest of economic transac-
tions, barter, in which one party directly trades a good or service for another good 
or service without using money. In a modern economy, simple barter is rare: usually 
people trade goods or services for money—pieces of colored paper with no inherent 
value—and then trade those pieces of colored paper for the goods or services they 
want. That is, they sell goods or services and buy other goods or services.
And they both sell and buy a lot of different things. The U.S. economy is a vastly 
complex entity, with more than a hundred million workers employed by millions of 
companies, producing millions of different goods and services. Yet you can learn 
some very important things about the economy by considering the simple graphic 
shown in Figure 2-6 on the next page, the circular-flow diagram. This diagram rep-
resents the transactions that take place in an economy by two kinds of flows around a 
circle: flows of physical things such as goods, services, labor, or raw materials in one 
direction, and flows of money that pay for these physical things in the opposite direc-
tion. In this case the physical flows are shown in yellow, the money flows in green.
The simplest circular-flow diagram illustrates an economy that contains only 
two kinds of inhabitants: households and firms. A household consists of either 
an individual or a group of people (usually, but not necessarily, a family) that 
share their income. A firm is an organization that produces goods and services 
for sale—and that employs members of households.
As you can see in Figure 2-6, there are two kinds of markets in this simple 
economy. On one side (here the left side) there are markets for goods and 
services in which households buy the goods and services they want from firms.

Trade takes the form of barter when 
people directly exchange goods or 
services that they have for goods or 
services that they want.
The circular-flow diagram 
represents the transactions in an 
economy by flows around a circle.
A household is a person or a group 
of people that share their income.
A firm is an organization that 
produces goods and services for sale.
Firms sell goods and services that 
they produce to households in 
markets for goods and services.
Poor countries tend to have low productivity in clothing 
manufacture, but even lower productivity in other industries 
(see the upcoming Economics in Action), giving them a 
comparative advantage in clothing manufacture. As a result, 
the clothing industry tends to dominate their economies. An 
official from one such country once joked, “We are not a 
banana republic—we are a pajama republic.”
The figure to the right plots per capita income (the total 
income of the country divided by the size of the population) 
against the share of manufacturing employment devoted to 
clothing production for several countries. The graph shows 
just how strongly negative the relationship is between a 
country’s per capita income level and the size of its clothing 
industry: poor countries have relatively large clothing indus-
tries, while rich countries have relatively small ones. 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Bangladesh’s clothing industry has “low productivity, 
largely low literacy levels, frequent labor unrest, and out-
dated technology.” Yet Bangladesh devotes most of its 
manufacturing workforce to clothing, the sector in which 
it nonetheless has a comparative advantage because its 
productivity in non-clothing industries is even lower. In 
contrast, Costa Rica has “relatively high productivity” in 
clothing. Yet, a much smaller and declining fraction of 
Costa Rica’s workforce is employed in clothing produc-
tion. That’s because productivity in non-clothing industries 
is somewhat higher in Costa Rica than in Bangladesh.

This produces a flow of goods and services to households and a return flow of 
money to firms.
On the other side, there are factor markets in which firms buy the resources 
they need to produce goods and services. Recall from earlier in the chapter that 
the main factors of production are land, labor, physical capital, and human capital.
The factor market most of us know best is the labor market, in which workers 
sell their services. In addition, we can think of households as owning and selling 
the other factors of production to firms. For example, when a firm buys physical 
capital in the form of machines, the payment ultimately goes to the households 
that own the machine-making firm. In this case, the transactions are occur-
ring in the capital market, the market in which capital is bought and sold. As 
we’ll examine in detail later, factor markets ultimately determine an economy’s 
income distribution, how the total income created in an economy is allocated 
between less skilled workers, highly skilled workers, and the owners of capital 
and land.
The circular-flow diagram ignores a number of real-world complications in 
the interests of simplicity. A few examples:
 • In the real world, the distinction between firms and households isn’t always 
that clear-cut. Consider a small, family-run business—a farm, a shop, a small 
hotel. Is this a firm or a household? A more complete picture would include a 
separate box for family businesses.
 • Many of the sales firms make are not to households but to other firms; for 
example, steel companies sell mainly to other companies such as auto manu-
facturers, not to households. A more complete picture would include these 
flows of goods, services, and money within the business sector.
 • The figure doesn’t show the government, which in the real world diverts quite 
a lot of money out of the circular flow in the form of taxes but also injects a 
lot of money back into the flow in the form of spending.

This diagram represents the

markets for goods and services, 
households purchase goods and 
services from firms, generating 
a flow of money to the firms and 
a flow of goods and services to 
the households. The money flows 
back to households as firms pur-
chase factors of production from 
the households in factor markets.
Firms buy the resources they need 
to produce goods and services in 
factor markets.
An economy’s income distribution 
is the way in which total income is 
divided among the owners of the 
various factors of production.

Figure 2-6, in other words, is by no means a complete picture either of all the 
types of inhabitants of the real economy or of all the flows of money and physical 
items that take place among these inhabitants.
Despite its simplicity, the circular-flow diagram is a very useful aid to think-
ing about the economy.

ry taking off your clothes—at a suitable time and in a suitable place, of 
course—and taking a look at the labels inside that say where they were 
made. It’s a very good bet that much, if not most, of your clothing was manu-
factured overseas, in a country that is much poorer than the United 
States—say, in El Salvador, Sri Lanka, or Bangladesh.
Why are these countries so much poorer than we are? The imme-
diate reason is that their economies are much less productive—firms 
in these countries are just not able to produce as much from a given 
quantity of resources as comparable firms in the United States or 
other wealthy countries. Why countries differ so much in productivity 
is a deep question—indeed, one of the main questions that preoccupy 
economists. But in any case, the difference in productivity is a fact.
But if the economies of these countries are so much less productive 
than ours, how is it that they make so much of our clothing? Why don’t 
we do it for ourselves?
The answer is “comparative advantage.” Just about every industry 
in Bangladesh is much less productive than the corresponding indus-
try in the United States. But the productivity difference between rich 
and poor countries varies across goods; it is very large in the pro-
duction of sophisticated goods like aircraft but not that large in the 
production of simpler goods like clothing. So Bangladesh’s position 
with regard to clothing production is like Embraer’s position with respect to 
producing small jets: it’s not as good at it as Boeing, but it’s the thing Embraer 
does comparatively well.
Bangladesh, though it is at an absolute disadvantage compared with the 
United States in almost everything, has a comparative advantage in clothing 
production. This means that both the United States and Bangladesh are able 
to consume more because they specialize in producing different things, with 
Bangladesh supplying our clothing and the United States supplying Bangladesh 
with more sophisticated goods.

a.  An increase in the amount of resources available to Boeing for use in producing 
Dreamliners and small jets does not change its production possibility frontier.

resources are being used efficiently.

markets for goods and services

factor markets determine the econo-
my’s income distribution.

Using Models
E
conomics, we have now learned, is mainly a matter of creating models that 
draw on a set of basic principles but add some more specific assumptions 
that allow the modeler to apply those principles to a particular situation. 
But what do economists actually do with their models?
Positive versus Normative Economics
Imagine that you are an economic adviser to the governor of your state. What 
kinds of questions might the governor ask you to answer?
Well, here are three possible questions:
 1. How much revenue will the tolls on the state turnpike yield next year?
 2. How much would that revenue increase if the toll were raised from $1 to $1.50?
 3. Should the toll be raised, bearing in mind that a toll increase will reduce traf-
fic and air pollution near the road but will impose some financial hardship on 
frequent commuters?
There is a big difference between the first two questions and the third one. The 
first two are questions about facts. Your forecast of next year’s toll collection will 
be proved right or wrong when the numbers actually come in. Your estimate of 
the impact of a change in the toll is a little harder to check—revenue depends on 
other factors besides the toll, and it may be hard to disentangle the causes of any 
change in revenue. Still, in principle there is only one right answer.
But the question of whether tolls should be raised may not have a “right” 
answer—two people who agree on the effects of a higher toll could still disagree 
about whether raising the toll is a good idea. For example, someone who lives 
near the turnpike but doesn’t commute on it will care a lot about noise and air 
pollution but not so much about commuting costs. A regular commuter who 
doesn’t live near the turnpike will have the opposite priorities.
This example highlights a key distinction between two roles of economic 
analysis. Analysis that tries to answer questions about the way the world works, 
which have definite right and wrong answers, is known as positive economics. 
In contrast, analysis that involves saying how the world should work is known 
as normative economics. To put it another way, positive economics is about 
description; normative economics is about prescription.
Positive economics occupies most of the time and effort of the economics 
profession. And models play a crucial role in almost all positive economics. As we 
mentioned earlier, the U.S. government uses a computer model to assess proposed 
changes in national tax policy, and many state governments have similar models 
to assess the effects of their own tax policy.
It’s worth noting that there is a subtle but important difference between the 
first and second questions we imagined the governor asking. Question 1 asked 
for a simple prediction about next year’s revenue—a forecast. Question 2 was a 
Positive economics is the branch 
of economic analysis that describes 
the way the economy actually works.
Normative economics makes 
prescriptions about the way the 
economy should work.
A forecast is a simple prediction of 
the future.

“what if” question, asking how revenue would change if the tax law were changed. 
Economists are often called upon to answer both types of questions, but models 
are especially useful for answering “what if” questions.
The answers to such questions often serve as a guide to policy, but they are still 
predictions, not prescriptions. That is, they tell you what will happen if a policy 
were changed; they don’t tell you whether or not that result is good. Suppose your 
economic model tells you that the governor’s proposed increase in highway tolls 
will raise property values in communities near the road but will hurt people who 
must use the turnpike to get to work. Does that make this proposed toll increase 
a good idea or a bad one? It depends on whom you ask. As we’ve just seen, some-
one who is very concerned with the communities near the road will support the 
increase, but someone who is very concerned with the welfare of drivers will feel 
differently. That’s a value judgment—it’s not a question of economic analysis.
Still, economists often do engage in normative economics and give policy 
advice. How can they do this when there may be no “right” answer?
One answer is that economists are also citizens, and we all have our opinions. 
But economic analysis can often be used to show that some policies are clearly 
better than others, regardless of anyone’s opinions.
Suppose that policies A and B achieve the same goal, but policy A makes every-
one better off than policy B—or at least makes some people better off without mak-
ing other people worse off. Then A is clearly more efficient than B. That’s not a value 
judgment: we’re talking about how best to achieve a goal, not about the goal itself.
For example, two different policies have been used to help low-income fami-
lies obtain housing: rent control, which limits the rents landlords are allowed to 
charge, and rent subsidies, which provide families with additional money to pay 
rent. Almost all economists agree that subsidies are the more efficient policy. 
And so the great majority of economists, whatever their personal politics, favor 
subsidies over rent control.
When policies can be clearly ranked in this way, then economists generally 
agree. But it is no secret that economists sometimes disagree.
When and Why Economists Disagree
Economists have a reputation for arguing with each other. Where does this repu-
tation come from, and is it justified?
One important answer is that media coverage tends to exaggerate the real differ-
ences in views among economists. If nearly all economists agree on an issue—for 
example, the proposition that rent controls lead to housing shortages—reporters 
and editors are likely to conclude that it’s not a story worth covering, leaving the 
professional consensus tends to go unreported. But an issue on which prominent 
economists take opposing sides—for example, whether cutting taxes right now 
would help the economy—makes a news story worth reporting. So you hear much 
more about the areas of disagreement within economics than you do 
about the large areas of agreement.
It is also worth remembering that economics is, unavoidably, often 
tied up in politics. On a number of issues powerful interest groups 
know what opinions they want to hear; they therefore have an incen-
tive to find and promote economists who profess those opinions, giv-
ing these economists a prominence and visibility out of proportion to 
their support among their colleagues.
While the appearance of disagreement among economists exceeds 
the reality, it remains true that economists often do disagree about 
important things. For example, some well respected economists argue 
vehemently that the U.S. government should replace the income tax 
with a value-added tax (a national sales tax, which is the main source 
of government revenue in many European countries). Other equally 
respected economists disagree. Why this difference of opinion?

One important source of differences lies in values: as in any diverse group of indi-
viduals, reasonable people can differ. In comparison to an income tax, a value-added 
tax typically falls more heavily on people of modest means. So an economist who val-
ues a society with more social and income equality for its own sake will tend to oppose 
a value-added tax. An economist with different values will be less likely to oppose it. 
A second important source of differences arises from economic modeling. 
Because economists base their conclusions on models, which are simplified 
representations of reality, two economists can legitimately disagree about which 
simplifications are appropriate—and therefore arrive at different conclusions.
Suppose that the U.S. government were considering introducing a value-
added tax. Economist A may rely on a model that focuses on the administrative 
costs of tax systems—that is, the costs of monitoring, processing papers, col-
lecting the tax, and so on. This economist might then point to the well-known 
high costs of administering a value-added tax and argue against the change. But 
economist B may think that the right way to approach the question is to ignore 
the administrative costs and focus on how the proposed law would change 
savings behavior. This economist might point to studies suggesting that value-
added taxes promote higher consumer saving, a desirable result.
Because the economists have used different models—that is, made different 
simplifying assumptions—they arrive at different conclusions. And so the two 
economists may find themselves on different sides of the issue.
In most cases such disputes are eventually resolved by the accumulation of 
evidence showing which of the various models proposed by economists does a 
better job of fitting the facts. However, in economics, as in any science, it can take 
a long time before research settles important disputes—decades, in some cases. 
And since the economy is always changing, in ways that make old models invalid 
or raise new policy questions, there are always new issues on which economists 
disagree. The policy maker must then decide which economist to believe.
The important point is that economic analysis is a method, not a set of conclusions.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
ECONOMISTS, BEYOND THE IVORY TOWER
M
any economists are mainly engaged in teaching and research. But quite a 
few economists have a more direct hand in events.
As described earlier in this chapter (For Inquiring Minds, “The Model That Ate 
the Economy”), one specific branch of economics, finance theory, plays an impor-
tant role on Wall Street—not always to good effect. But pricing assets is by no means 
the only useful function economists serve in the business world. Businesses need 
“If all the economists in the world were 
laid end to end, they still couldn’t reach 
a conclusion.” So goes one popular 
economist joke. But do economists 
really disagree that much?
Not according to a classic survey of 
members of the American Economic 
Association, reported in the May 1992 
issue of the American Economic Review. 
The authors asked respondents to agree 
or disagree with a number of statements 
about the economy; what they found 
was a high level of agreement among 
professional economists on many of the 
statements. At the top, with more than 
90 percent of the economists agreeing, 
were “Tariffs and import quotas usually 
reduce general economic welfare” and 
“A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity 
and quality of housing available.” What’s 
striking about these two statements 
is that many noneconomists disagree: 
tariffs and import quotas to keep out 
foreign-produced goods are favored 
by many voters, and proposals to do 
away with rent control in cities like New 
York and San Francisco have met fierce 
political opposition.
So is the stereotype of quarreling econ-
omists a myth? Not entirely: economists 
do disagree quite a lot on some issues, 
especially in macroeconomics. But there 
is a large area of common ground.

forecasts of the future demand for their products, predictions of future 
raw-material prices, assessments of their future financing needs, and 
more; for all of these purposes, economic analysis is essential.
Some of the economists employed in the business world work 
directly for the institutions that need their input. Top financial 
firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, in particular, 
maintain high-quality economics groups, which produce analyses 
of forces and events likely to affect financial markets. Other econo-
mists are employed by consulting firms like Macro Advisers, which 
sells analysis and advice to a wide range of other businesses.
Last but not least, economists participate extensively in govern-
ment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, government 
agencies employ about half of the professional economists in 
the United States. This shouldn’t be surprising: one of the most 
important functions of government is to make economic policy, 
and almost every government policy decision must take economic 
effects into consideration. So governments around the world employ economists 
in a variety of roles.
In the U.S. government, a key role is played by the Council of Economic 
Advisers, whose sole purpose is to advise the president on economic matters. 
Unlike most government employees, most economists at the Council aren’t long-
time civil servants; instead, they are mainly professors on leave for one or two 
years from their universities. Many of the nation’s best-known economists have 
served at the Council of Economic Advisers at some point in their careers.
Economists also play an important role in many other parts of the govern-
ment, from the Department of Commerce to the Labor Department. Economists 
dominate the staff of the Federal Reserve, a government agency that controls the 
economy’s money supply as well as overseeing banks. And economists play an 
especially important role in two international organizations headquartered in 
Washington, D.C.: the International Monetary Fund, which provides advice and 
loans to countries experiencing economic difficulties, and the World Bank, which 
provides advice and loans to promote long-term economic development.
In the past, it wasn’t that easy to track what all these economists working on 
practical affairs were up to. These days, however, there is a very lively online dis-
cussion of economic prospects and policy, on websites that range from the home 
page of the International Monetary Fund (www.imf.org), to business-oriented 
sites like economy.com, to the blogs of individual economists, like that of Mark 
Thoma (economistsview.typepad.com) or, yes, our own blog, which is among the 
Technorati top 100 blogs, at krugman.blogs.nytimes.com.

 Quick Review
• Positive economics—the focus 
of most economic research—is 
the analysis of the way the world 
works, in which there are definite 
right and wrong answers. If often 
involves making forecasts. But 
in normative economics, which 
makes prescriptions about how 
things ought to be, there are often 
no right answers and only value 
judgments.
• Economists do disagree—though 
not as much as legend has it—for 
two main reasons. One, they may 
disagree about which simplifica-
tions to make in a model. Two, 
economists may disagree—like 
everyone else—about values.

In the summer and fall of 2010, workers were rearranging the furniture in Boeing’s 
final assembly plant in Everett, Washington, in preparation for the production of 
the Boeing 767. It was a difficult and time-consuming process, however, because 
the items of “furniture”—Boeing’s assembly equipment—weighed on the order of 
200 tons each. It was a necessary part of setting up a production system based on 
“lean manufacturing,” also called “just-in-time” production. Lean manufactur-
ing, pioneered by Toyota Motors of Japan, is based on the practice of having parts 
arrive on the factory floor just as they are needed for production. This reduces the 
amount of parts Boeing holds in inventory as well as the amount of the factory 
floor needed for production—in this case, reducing the square footage required 
for manufacture of the 767 by 40%.
Boeing had adopted lean manufacturing in 1999 in the manufacture of the 
737, the most popular commercial airplane. By 2005, after constant refinement, 
Boeing had achieved a 50% reduction in the time it takes to produce a plane and 
a nearly 60% reduction in parts inventory. An important feature is a continuously 
moving assembly line, moving products from one assembly team to the next at 
a steady pace and eliminating the need for workers to wander across the factory 
floor from task to task or in search of tools and parts.
Toyota’s lean production techniques have been the most widely adopted of all 
manufacturing techniques and have revolutionized manufacturing worldwide. 
In simple terms, lean production is focused on organization and communica-
tion. Workers and parts are organized so as to ensure a smooth and consistent 
workflow that minimizes wasted effort and materials. Lean production is also 
designed to be highly responsive to changes in the desired mix of output—for 
example, quickly producing more sedans and fewer minivans according to 
changes in customers’ demands.
Toyota’s lean production methods were so successful that they transformed 
the global auto industry and severely threatened once-dominant American auto-
makers. Until the 1980s, the “Big Three”—Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors—
dominated the American auto industry, with virtually no foreign-made cars sold 
in the United States. In the 1980s, however, Toyotas became increasingly popular 
in the United States due to their high quality and relatively low price—so popular 
that the Big Three eventually prevailed upon the U.S. government to protect them 
by restricting the sale of Japanese autos in the U.S. Over time, Toyota responded 
by building assembly plants in the United States, bringing along its lean pro-
duction techniques, which then spread throughout American manufacturing. 
Toyota’s growth continued, and by 2008 it had eclipsed General Motors as the 
largest automaker in the world.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. What is the opportunity cost associated with having a worker wander across the factory 
floor from task to task or in search of tools and parts?
 2. Explain how lean manufacturing improves the economy’s efficiency in allocation.
 3. Before lean manufacturing innovations, Japan mostly sold consumer electronics to the 
United States. How did lean manufacturing innovations alter Japan’s comparative advan-
tage vis-à-vis the United States?
 4. Predict how the shift in the location of Toyota’s production from Japan to the United States 
is likely to alter the pattern of comparative advantage in automaking between the two 
countries.

SUMMARY
 1. Almost all economics is based on models, “thought 
experiments” or simplified versions of reality, many 
of which use mathematical tools such as graphs. An 
important assumption in economic models is the 
other things equal assumption, which allows analy-
sis of the effect of a change in one factor by holding all 
other relevant factors unchanged.
 2. One important economic model is the production 
possibility frontier. It illustrates opportunity cost 
(showing how much less of one good can be produced 
if more of the other good is produced); efficiency (an 
economy is efficient in production if it produces on the 
production possibility frontier and efficient in alloca-
tion if it produces the mix of goods and services that 
people want to consume); and economic growth (an 
outward shift of the production possibility frontier). 
There are two basic sources of growth: an increase in 
factors of production—resources such as land, labor, 
capital, and human capital, inputs that are not used up 
in production—and improved technology.
 3. Another important model is comparative advantage, 
which explains the source of gains from trade between 
individuals and countries. Everyone has a compara-
tive advantage in something—some good or service in 
which that person has a lower opportunity cost than 
everyone else. But it is often confused with absolute 
advantage, an ability to produce a particular good or 
service better than anyone else. This confusion leads 
some to erroneously conclude that there are no gains 
from trade between people or countries.
 4. In the simplest economies people barter—trade goods 
and services for one another—rather than trade them 
for money, as in a modern economy. The circular-
flow diagram represents transactions within the 
economy as flows of goods, services, and money 
between households and firms. These transactions 
occur in markets for goods and services and factor 
markets, markets for factors of production—land, 
labor, physical capital, and human capital. It is useful 
in understanding how spending, production, employ-
ment, income, and growth are related in the economy. 
Ultimately, factor markets determine the economy’s 
income distribution, how an economy’s total income 
is allocated to the owners of the factors of production.
 5. Economists use economic models for both positive 
economics, which describes how the economy works, 
and for normative economics, which prescribes how 
the economy should work. Positive economics often 
involves making forecasts. Economists can determine 
correct answers for positive questions but typically 
not for normative questions, which involve value judg-
ments. The exceptions are when policies designed to 
achieve a certain objective can be clearly ranked in 
terms of efficiency.
 6. There are two main reasons economists disagree. One, 
they may disagree about which simplifications to make 
in a model. Two, economists may disagree—like every-
one else—about values.
PROBLEMS
 1. Two important industries on the island of Bermuda are 
fishing and tourism. According to data from the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
and the Bermuda Department of Statistics, in the year 
2009 the 306 registered fishermen in Bermuda caught 
387 metric tons of marine fish. And the 2,719 people 
employed by hotels produced 554,400 hotel stays (mea-
sured by the number of visitor arrivals). Suppose that 
this production point is efficient in production. Assume 
also that the opportunity cost of 1 additional metric ton 
of fish is 2,000 hotel stays and that this opportunity cost 
is constant (the opportunity cost does not change).
a. If all 306 registered fishermen were to be employed 
by hotels (in addition to the 2,719 people already 
working in hotels), how many hotel stays could 
Bermuda produce?
b. If all 2,719 hotel employees were to become fish-
ermen (in addition to the 306 fishermen already 
working in the fishing industry), how many metric 
tons of fish could Bermuda produce?

The inhabitants grow potatoes and catch fish. The

put combinations of potatoes and fish that can be 
produced. Obviously, given their limited resources and

 3. According to data from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s 
National 
Agricultural 
Statistics 
Service, 124 million acres of land in the United 
States were used for wheat or corn farming in 2004. 
Of those 124 million acres, farmers used 50 million 
acres to grow 2.158 billion bushels of wheat and 74 
million acres of land to grow 11.807 billion bushels 
of corn. Suppose that U.S. wheat and corn farming 
is efficient in production. At that production point, 
the opportunity cost of producing 1 additional bush-
el of wheat is 1.7 fewer bushels of corn. However, 
because farmers have increasing opportunity costs, 
additional bushels of wheat have an opportunity 
cost greater than 1.7 bushels of corn. For each of 
the following production points, decide whether that 
production point is (i) feasible and efficient in pro-
duction, (ii) feasible but not efficient in production, 
(iii) not feasible, or (iv) unclear as to whether or not 
it is feasible.
a. Farmers use 40 million acres of land to produce 1.8 
billion bushels of wheat, and they use 60 million 
acres of land to produce 9 billion bushels of corn. 
The remaining 24 million acres are left unused.
b. From their original production point, farmers trans-
fer 40 million acres of land from corn to wheat pro-
duction. They now produce 3.158 billion bushels of 
wheat and 10.107 bushels of corn.
c. Farmers reduce their production of wheat to 2 bil-
lion bushels and increase their production of corn to 
12.044 billion bushels. Along the production possibil-
ity frontier, the opportunity cost of going from 11.807 
billion bushels of corn to 12.044 billion bushels of 
corn is 0.666 bushel of wheat per bushel of corn.
 4. In the ancient country of Roma, only two goods, spa-
ghetti and meatballs, are produced. There are two tribes 
in Roma, the Tivoli and the Frivoli. By themselves, the 
Tivoli each month can produce either 30 pounds of spa-
ghetti and no meatballs, or 50 pounds of meatballs and 
no spaghetti, or any combination in between. The Frivoli, 
by themselves, each month can produce 40 pounds of 
spaghetti and no meatballs, or 30 pounds of meatballs 
and no spaghetti, or any combination in between.
a. Assume that all production possibility frontiers 
are straight lines. Draw one diagram showing the 
monthly production possibility frontier for the Tivoli 
and another showing the monthly production pos-
sibility frontier for the Frivoli. Show how you calcu-
lated them.
b. Which tribe has the comparative advantage in spa-
ghetti production? In meatball production?
In A.D. 100 the Frivoli discover a new technique for 
making meatballs that doubles the quantity of meat-
balls they can produce each month.
c. Draw the new monthly production possibility fron-
tier for the Frivoli.
d. After the innovation, which tribe now has an abso-
lute advantage in producing meatballs? In producing 
spaghetti? Which has the comparative advantage in 
meatball production? In spaghetti production?
 5. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in July 2006 the 
United States sold aircraft worth $1 billion to China 
and bought aircraft worth only $19,000 from China. 
During the same month, however, the United States 
bought $83 million worth of men’s trousers, slacks, and 
jeans from China but sold only $8,000 worth of trou-
sers, slacks, and jeans to China. Using what you have 
learned about how trade is determined by comparative 
advantage, answer the following questions.
a. Which country has the comparative advantage in 
aircraft production? In production of trousers, 
slacks, and jeans?
b. Can you determine which country has the absolute 
advantage in aircraft production? In production of

 6. Peter Pundit, an economics reporter, states that the 
European Union (EU) is increasing its productivity very 
rapidly in all industries. He claims that this productiv-
ity advance is so rapid that output from the EU in these

industries will soon exceed that of the United States 
and, as a result, the United States will no longer benefit 
from trade with the EU.
a. Do you think Peter Pundit is correct or not? If not, 
what do you think is the source of his mistake?
b. If the EU and the United States continue to trade, 
what do you think will characterize the goods that 
the EU sells to the United States and the goods that 
the United States sells to the EU?
 7. You are in charge of allocating residents to your dor-
mitory’s baseball and basketball teams. You are down 
to the last four people, two of whom must be allocated 
to baseball and two to basketball. The accompanying 
table gives each person’s batting average and free-
throw average.

a. Explain how you would use the concept of com-
parative advantage to allocate the players. Begin by 
establishing each player’s opportunity cost of free 
throws in terms of batting average.
b. Why is it likely that the other basketball play-
ers will be unhappy about this arrangement 
but the other baseball players will be satisfied? 
Nonetheless, why would an economist say that this 
is an efficient way to allocate players for your dor-
mitory’s sports teams?
 8. The inhabitants of the fictional economy of Atlantis use 
money in the form of cowry shells. Draw a circular-flow 
diagram showing households and firms. Firms pro-
duce potatoes and fish, and households buy potatoes 
and fish. Households also provide the land and labor 
to firms. Identify where in the flows of cowry shells or 
physical things (goods and services, or resources) each 
of the following impacts would occur. Describe how 
this impact spreads around the circle.
a. A devastating hurricane floods many of the potato 
fields.
b. A very productive fishing season yields a very large 
number of fish caught.
c. The inhabitants of Atlantis discover Shakira and 
spend several days a month at dancing festivals.
 9. An economist might say that colleges and universi-
ties “produce” education, using faculty members and 
students as inputs. According to this line of reasoning, 
education is then “consumed” by households. Construct 
a circular-flow diagram to represent the sector of the 
economy devoted to college education: colleges and 
universities represent firms, and households both con-
sume education and provide faculty and students to 
universities. What are the relevant markets in this dia-
gram? What is being bought and sold in each direction? 
What would happen in the diagram if the government 
decided to subsidize 50% of all college students’ tuition?
10. Your dormitory roommate plays loud music most of the 
time; you, however, would prefer more peace and quiet. 
You suggest that she buy some earphones. She responds 
that although she would be happy to use earphones, she 
has many other things that she would prefer to spend 
her money on right now. You discuss this situation with 
a friend who is an economics major. The following 
exchange takes place:
 He: How much would it cost to buy earphones? 
You: $15. 
He: How much do you value having some peace and 
quiet for the rest of the semester? 
You: $30. 
He: It is efficient for you to buy the earphones and give 
them to your roommate. You gain more than you lose; 
the benefit exceeds the cost. You should do that. 
You: It just isn’t fair that I have to pay for the earphones 
when I’m not the one making the noise. 
a. Which parts of this conversation contain positive 
statements and which parts contain normative state-
ments?
b. Construct an argument supporting your viewpoint 
that your roommate should be the one to change 
her behavior. Similarly, construct an argument from 
the viewpoint of your roommate that you should be 
the one to buy the earphones. If your dormitory has 
a policy that gives residents the unlimited right to 
play music, whose argument is likely to win? If your 
dormitory has a rule that a person must stop play-
ing music whenever a roommate complains, whose 
argument is likely to win?
 11. A representative of the American clothing industry 
recently made the following statement: “Workers in 
Asia often work in sweatshop conditions earning only 
pennies an hour. American workers are more produc-
tive and as a result earn higher wages. In order to 
preserve the dignity of the American workplace, the 
government should enact legislation banning imports 
of low-wage Asian clothing.”
a. Which parts of this quote are positive statements? 
Which parts are normative statements?
b. Is the policy that is being advocated consistent with 
the preceding statements about the wages and pro-
ductivities of American and Asian workers?
c. Would such a policy make some Americans better 
off without making any other Americans worse off? 
That is, would this policy be efficient from the view-
point of all Americans?
d. Would low-wage Asian workers benefit from or be 
hurt by such a policy?
 12. Are the following statements true or false? Explain your 
answers.
a. “When people must pay higher taxes on their wage 
earnings, it reduces their incentive to work” is a 
positive statement.

48    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
b. “We should lower taxes to encourage more work” is 
a positive statement.
c. Economics cannot always be used to completely 
decide what society ought to do.
d. “The system of public education in this country 
generates greater benefits to society than the cost of 
running the system” is a normative statement.
e. All disagreements among economists are generated 
by the media.
 13. Evaluate the following statement: “It is easier to build 
an economic model that accurately reflects events that 
have already occurred than to build an economic model 
to forecast future events.” Do you think this is true or 
not? Why? What does this imply about the difficulties 
of building good economic models?
14. Economists who work for the government are often 
called on to make policy recommendations. Why do you 
think it is important for the public to be able to differ-
entiate normative statements from positive statements 
in these recommendations?
 15. The mayor of Gotham City, worried about a potential epi-
demic of deadly influenza this winter, asks an economic 
adviser the following series of questions. Determine 
whether a question requires the economic adviser to 
make a positive assessment or a normative assessment.
a. How much vaccine will be in stock in the city by the 
end of November?
b. If we offer to pay 10% more per dose to the pharma-
ceutical companies providing the vaccines, will they 
provide additional doses?
c. If there is a shortage of vaccine in the city, whom 
should we vaccinate first—the elderly or the very 
young? (Assume that a person from one group has 
an equal likelihood of dying from influenza as a per-
son from the other group.)
d. If the city charges $25 per shot, how many people 
will pay?
e. If the city charges $25 per shot, it will make a profit 
of $10 per shot, money that can go to pay for inocu-
lating poor people. Should the city engage in such a 
scheme?
16. Assess the following statement: “If economists just had 
enough data, they could solve all policy questions in a 
way that maximizes the social good. There would be no 
need for divisive political debates, such as whether the 
government should provide free medical care for all.”

Graphs in Economics
Getting the Picture
Whether you’re reading about economics in the Wall Street Journal or in your 
economics textbook, you will see many graphs. Visual images can make it much 
easier to understand verbal descriptions, numerical information, or ideas. In eco-
nomics, graphs are the type of visual image used to facilitate understanding. To 
fully understand the ideas and information being discussed, you need to be famil-
iar with how to interpret these visual aids. This appendix explains how graphs are 
constructed and interpreted and how they are used in economics.
Graphs, Variables, and Economic Models
One reason to attend college is that a bachelor’s degree provides access to higher -
paying jobs. Additional degrees, such as MBAs or law degrees, increase earnings 
even more. If you were to read an article about the relationship between educational 
attainment and income, you would probably see a graph showing the income levels 
for workers with different amounts of education. And this graph would depict the 
idea that, in general, more education increases income. This graph, like most of 
those in economics, would depict the relationship between two economic variables. 
A variable is a quantity that can take on more than one value, such as the number of 
years of education a person has, the price of a can of soda, or a household’s income.
As you learned in this chapter, economic analysis relies heavily on models, 
simplified descriptions of real situations. Most economic models describe the 
relationship between two variables, simplified by holding constant other vari-
ables that may affect the relationship. For example, an economic model might 
describe the relationship between the price of a can of soda and the number of 
cans of soda that consumers will buy, assuming that everything else that affects 
consumers’ purchases of soda stays constant. This type of model can be described 
mathematically or verbally, but illustrating the relationship in a graph makes it 
easier to understand. Next we show how graphs that depict economic models are 
constructed and interpreted.
How Graphs Work
Most graphs in economics are based on a grid built around two perpendicular 
lines that show the values of two variables, helping you visualize the relationship 
between them. So a first step in understanding the use of such graphs is to see 
how this system works.
Two - Variable Graphs
Figure 2A-1 shows a typical two - variable graph. It illustrates the data in the 
accompanying table on outside temperature and the number of sodas a typical 
vendor can expect to sell at a baseball stadium during one game. The first col-
umn shows the values of outside temperature (the first variable) and the second 
column shows the values of the number of sodas sold (the second variable). Five 
combinations or pairs of the two variables are shown, each denoted by A through 
E in the third column.
Now let’s turn to graphing the data in this table. In any two - variable graph, 
one variable is called the x-variable and the other is called the y-variable. Here

than one value is called a variable.

we have made outside temperature the x-variable and number of sodas sold the 
y-variable. The solid horizontal line in the graph is called the horizontal axis or 
x-axis, and values of the x-variable—outside temperature—are measured along 
it. Similarly, the solid vertical line in the graph is called the vertical axis or 
y-axis, and values of the y-variable—number of sodas sold—are measured along 
it. At the origin, the point where the two axes meet, each variable is equal to zero. 
As you move rightward from the origin along the x-axis, values of the x-variable 
are positive and increasing. As you move up from the origin along the y-axis, val-
ues of the y-variable are positive and increasing.
You can plot each of the five points A through E on this graph by using a pair 
of numbers—the values that the x-variable and the y-variable take on for a given 
point. In Figure 2A-1, at point C, the x-variable takes on the value 40 and the 
y-variable takes on the value 30. You plot point C by drawing a line straight up 
from 40 on the x-axis and a horizontal line across from 30 on the y-axis. We write 
point C as (40, 30). We write the origin as (0, 0).
Looking at point A and point B in Figure 2A-1, you can see that when one of the 
variables for a point has a value of zero, it will lie on one of the axes. If the value 
of the x-variable is zero, the point will lie on the vertical axis, like point A. If the 
value of the y-variable is zero, the point will lie on the horizontal axis, like point B.
Most graphs that depict relationships between two economic variables repre-
sent a causal relationship, a relationship in which the value taken by one variable 
directly influences or determines the value taken by the other variable. In a causal 
relationship, the determining variable is called the independent variable; the 
variable it determines is called the dependent variable. In our example of soda

The data from the table are plotted where out-
side temperature (the independent variable) is 
measured along the horizontal axis and number 
of sodas sold (the dependent variable) is mea-
sured along the vertical axis. Each of the five 
combinations of temperature and sodas sold is 
represented by a point: A, B, C, D, and E. Each 
point in the graph is identified by a pair of values. 
For example, point C corresponds to the pair 
(40, 30)—an outside temperature of 40°F (the value 
of the x-variable) and 30 sodas sold (the value of 
the y-variable).
The line along which values of the 
x - variable are measured is called the 
horizontal axis or x - axis. The line 
along which values of the y - variable 
are measured is called the vertical 
axis or y - axis. The point where the 
axes of a two - variable graph meet is 
the origin.
A causal relationship exists 
between two variables when the 
value taken by one variable directly 
influences or determines the value 
taken by the other variable. In a 
causal relationship, the determining 
variable is called the independent 
variable; the variable it determines 
is called the dependent variable.

sales, the outside temperature is the independent variable. It directly influences the 
number of sodas that are sold, the dependent variable in this case.
By convention, we put the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the 
dependent variable on the vertical axis. Figure 2A-1 is constructed consistent with 
this convention; the independent variable (outside temperature) is on the horizon-
tal axis and the dependent variable (number of sodas sold) is on the vertical axis. 
An important exception to this convention is in graphs showing the economic 
relationship between the price of a product and quantity of the product: although 
price is generally the independent variable that determines quantity, it is always 
measured on the vertical axis.
Curves on a Graph
Panel (a) of Figure 2A-2 contains some of the same information as Figure 2A-1, 
with a line drawn through the points B, C, D, and E. Such a line on a graph is 
called a curve, regardless of whether it is a straight line or a curved line. If the 
curve that shows the relationship between two variables is a straight line, or lin-
ear, the variables have a linear relationship. When the curve is not a straight 
line, or nonlinear, the variables have a nonlinear relationship.
A point on a curve indicates the value of the y-variable for a specific value of 
the x-variable. For example, point D indicates that at a temperature of 60°F, a 
vendor can expect to sell 50 sodas. The shape and orientation of a curve reveal

The curve in panel (a) illustrates the relationship 
between the two variables, outside temperature and 
number of sodas sold. The two variables have a posi-
tive linear relationship: positive because the curve has 
an upward tilt, and linear because it is a straight line. 
It implies that an increase in the x-variable (outside 
temperature) leads to an increase in the y-variable 
(number of sodas sold). The curve in panel (b) is also 
a straight line, but it tilts downward. The two variables 
here, outside temperature and number of hot drinks 
sold, have a negative linear relationship: an increase in 
the x-variable (outside temperature) leads to a decrease 
in the y-variable (number of hot drinks sold). The curve 
in panel (a) has a horizontal intercept at point B, where 
it hits the horizontal axis. The curve in panel (b) has a 
vertical intercept at point J, where it hits the vertical 
axis, and a horizontal intercept at point M, where it hits 
the horizontal axis.
A curve is a line on a graph that 
depicts a relationship between two 
variables. It may be either a straight 
line or a curved line. If the curve is 
a straight line, the variables have a 
linear relationship. If the curve is 
not a straight line, the variables have 
a nonlinear relationship.

the general nature of the relationship between the two variables. The upward tilt 
of the curve in panel (a) of Figure 2A-2 means that vendors can expect to sell more 
sodas at higher outside temperatures.
When variables are related this way—that is, when an increase in one variable 
is associated with an increase in the other variable—the variables are said to have 
a positive relationship. It is illustrated by a curve that slopes upward from left 
to right. Because this curve is also linear, the relationship between outside tem-
perature and number of sodas sold illustrated by the curve in panel (a) of Figure 
2A-2 is a positive linear relationship.
When an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other 
variable, the two variables are said to have a negative relationship. It is illus-
trated by a curve that slopes downward from left to right, like the curve in panel 
(b) of Figure 2A-2. Because this curve is also linear, the relationship it depicts is 
a negative linear relationship. Two variables that might have such a relationship 
are the outside temperature and the number of hot drinks a vendor can expect to 
sell at a baseball stadium.
Return for a moment to the curve in panel (a) of Figure 2A-2 and you can see 
that it hits the horizontal axis at point B. This point, known as the horizontal 
intercept, shows the value of the x-variable when the value of the y-variable is 
zero. In panel (b) of Figure 2A-2, the curve hits the vertical axis at point J. This 
point, called the vertical intercept, indicates the value of the y-variable when 
the value of the x-variable is zero.
A Key Concept: The Slope of a Curve
The slope of a curve is a measure of how steep it is and indicates how sensitive 
the y-variable is to a change in the x-variable. In our example of outside tempera-
ture and the number of cans of soda a vendor can expect to sell, the slope of the 
curve would indicate how many more cans of soda the vendor could expect to 
sell with each 1 degree increase in temperature. Interpreted this way, the slope 
gives meaningful information. Even without numbers for x and y, it is possible to 
arrive at important conclusions about the relationship between the two variables 
by examining the slope of a curve at various points.
The Slope of a Linear Curve
Along a linear curve the slope, or steepness, is measured by dividing the “rise” 
between two points on the curve by the “run” between those same two points. 
The rise is the amount that y changes, and the run is the amount that x changes. 
Here is the formula:
Change in y
Change in x = Δy
Δx = Slope
In the formula, the symbol Δ (the Greek uppercase delta) stands for “change 
in.” When a variable increases, the change in that variable is positive; when a vari-
able decreases, the change in that variable is negative.
The slope of a curve is positive when the rise (the change in the y-variable) has 
the same sign as the run (the change in the x-variable). That’s because when two 
numbers have the same sign, the ratio of those two numbers is positive. The curve 
in panel (a) of Figure 2A-2 has a positive slope: along the curve, both the y-variable 
and the x-variable increase. The slope of a curve is negative when the rise and the 
run have different signs. That’s because when two numbers have different signs, 
the ratio of those two numbers is negative. The curve in panel (b) of Figure 2A-2 
has a negative slope: along the curve, an increase in the x-variable is associated 
with a decrease in the y-variable.
Figure 2A-3 illustrates how to calculate the slope of a linear curve. Let’s focus 
first on panel (a). From point A to point B the value of the y-variable changes from 
Two variables have a positive 
relationship when an increase 
in the value of one variable is 
associated with an increase in the 
value of the other variable. It is 
illustrated by a curve that slopes 
upward from left to right.
Two variables have a negative 
relationship when an increase 
in the value of one variable is 
associated with a decrease in the 
value of the other variable. It is 
illustrated by a curve that slopes 
downward from left to right.
The horizontal intercept of a 
curve is the point at which it hits the 
horizontal axis; it indicates the value 
of the x - variable when the value of 
the y - variable is zero.
The vertical intercept of a curve 
is the point at which it hits the 
vertical axis; it shows the value of 
the y - variable when the value of the 
x - variable is zero.
The slope of a line or curve is a 
measure of how steep it is. The 
slope of a line is measured by 
“rise over run”—the change in the 
y - variable between two points on 
the line divided by the change in 
the x - variable between those same 
two points.

C H A P T E R  2  A P P E N D I X    G R A P H S I N EC O N O M I C S    53
25 to 20 and the value of the x-variable changes from 10 to 20. So the slope of the 
line between these two points is:
Change in y
Change in x = Δy
Δx = −5
10  = − 1
2  = −0.5
Because a straight line is equally steep at all points, the slope of a straight line 
is the same at all points. In other words, a straight line has a constant slope. You 
can check this by calculating the slope of the linear curve between points A and 
B and between points C and D in panel (b) of Figure 2A-3.
Between A and B: 
Δy
Δx = 10
2  = 5
Between C and D: 
Δy
Δx = 20
4  = 5
Horizontal and Vertical Curves and Their Slopes
When a curve is horizontal, the value of the y-variable along that curve never 
changes—it is constant. Everywhere along the curve, the change in y is zero. Now, 
zero divided by any number is zero. So, regardless of the value of the change in 
x, the slope of a horizontal curve is always zero.
If a curve is vertical, the value of the x-variable along the curve never changes—
it is constant. Everywhere along the curve, the change in x is zero. This means that 
the slope of a vertical curve is a ratio with zero in the denominator. A ratio with 
zero in the denominator is equal to infinity—that is, an infinitely large number. So 
the slope of a vertical curve is equal to infinity.

Panels (a) and (b) show two linear curves. Between points A 
and B on the curve in panel (a), the change in y (the rise) is 
−5 and the change in x (the run) is 10. So the slope from A to 
B is Δy
Δx = −5

that the curve is downward sloping. In panel (b), the curve 
has a slope from A to B of Δy

D is Δy

4  = 5. The slope is positive, indicating that the 
curve is upward sloping. Furthermore, the slope between 
A and B is the same as the slope between C and D, 
making this a linear curve. The slope of a linear curve is 
constant: it is the same regardless of where it is measured 
along the curve.

54    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
A vertical or a horizontal curve has a special implication: it means that the 
x-variable and the y-variable are unrelated. Two variables are unrelated when 
a change in one variable (the independent variable) has no effect on the other 
variable (the dependent variable). Or to put it a slightly different way, two vari-
ables are unrelated when the dependent variable is constant regardless of the 
value of the independent variable. If, as is usual, the y-variable is the dependent 
variable, the curve is horizontal. If the depen dent variable is the x-variable, the 
curve is vertical.
The Slope of a Nonlinear Curve
A nonlinear curve is one in which the slope changes as you move along 
it. Panels (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 2A-4 show various nonlinear curves. 
Panels (a) and (b) show nonlinear curves whose slopes change as you move 
along them, but the slopes always remain positive. Although both curves tilt 
upward, the curve in panel (a) gets steeper as you move from left to right in 
contrast to the curve in panel (b), which gets flatter. A curve that is upward 
sloping and gets steeper, as in panel (a), is said to have positive increasing 
slope. A curve that is upward sloping but gets flatter, as in panel (b), is said to 
have positive decreasing slope.
When we calculate the slope along these nonlinear curves, we obtain dif-
ferent values for the slope at different points. How the slope changes along the 
curve determines the curve’s shape. For example, in panel (a) of Figure 2A-4, 
the slope of the curve is a positive number that steadily increases as you move 
from left to right, whereas in panel (b), the slope is a positive number that 
steadily decreases.
The slopes of the curves in panels (c) and (d) are negative numbers. Economists 
often prefer to express a negative number as its absolute value, which is the 
value of the negative number without the minus sign. In general, we denote the 
absolute value of a number by two parallel bars around the number; for example, 
the absolute value of −4 is written as |−4| = 4. In panel (c), the absolute value of 
the slope steadily increases as you move from left to right. The curve therefore 
has negative increasing slope. And in panel (d), the absolute value of the slope of 
the curve steadily decreases along the curve. This curve therefore has negative 
decreasing slope.
Calculating the Slope Along a Nonlinear Curve
We’ve just seen that along a nonlinear curve, the value of the slope depends on 
where you are on that curve. So how do you calculate the slope of a nonlinear 
curve? We will focus on two methods: the arc method and the point method.
The Arc Method of Calculating the Slope An arc of a curve is some piece 
or segment of that curve. For example, panel (a) of Figure 2A-4 shows an arc con-
sisting of the segment of the curve between points A and B. To calculate the slope 
along a nonlinear curve using the arc method, you draw a straight line between 
the two end - points of the arc. The slope of that straight line is a measure of the 
average slope of the curve between those two end - points. You can see from panel 
(a) of Figure 2A-4 that the straight line drawn between points A and B increases 
along the x-axis from 6 to 10 (so that Δx = 4) as it increases along the y-axis from 
10 to 20 (so that Δy = 10). Therefore the slope of the straight line connecting points 
A and B is:
Δy
Δx = 10
4  = 2.5
This means that the average slope of the curve between points A and B is 2.5.
A nonlinear curve is one in which 
the slope is not the same between 
every pair of points.
The absolute value of a negative 
number is the value of the negative 
number without the minus sign.

Now consider the arc on the same curve between points C and D. A straight 
line drawn through these two points increases along the x-axis from 11 to 12 
(Δx = 1) as it increases along the y-axis from 25 to 40 (Δy = 15). So the average 
slope between points C and D is:
Δy
Δx = 15
1  = 15

3. The slope is negative and decreasing; the 
curve gets flatter as you move to the right. The slope in each 
case has been calculated by using the arc method—that is, by 
drawing a straight line connecting two points along a curve. 
The average slope between those two points is equal to the 
slope of the straight line between those two points.

56    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
Therefore the average slope between points C and D is larger than the average 
slope between points A and B. These calculations verify what we have already 
observed—that this upward - tilted curve gets steeper as you move from left to 
right and therefore has positive increasing slope.
The Point Method of Calculating the Slope The point method calculates 
the slope of a nonlinear curve at a specific point on that curve. Figure 2A-5 illus-
trates how to calculate the slope at point B on the curve. First, we draw a straight 
line that just touches the curve at point B. Such a line is called a tangent line: 
the fact that it just touches the curve at point B and does not touch the curve at 
any other point on the curve means that the straight line is tangent to the curve 
at point B. The slope of this tangent line is equal to the slope of the nonlinear 
curve at point B.
You can see from Figure 2A-5 how the slope of the tangent line is calculated: 
from point A to point C, the change in y is 15 and the change in x is 5, generating 
a slope of:
Δy
Δx = 15
5  = 3
By the point method, the slope of the curve at point B is equal to 3.
A natural question to ask at this point is how to determine which method 
to use—the arc method or the point method—in calculating the slope of a 
nonlinear curve. The answer depends on the curve itself and the data used to 
construct it. You use the arc method when you don’t have enough informa-
tion to be able to draw a smooth curve. For example, suppose that in panel 
(a) of Figure 2A-4 you have only the data represented by points A, C, and D 
and don’t have the data represented by point B or any of the rest of the curve. 
Clearly, then, you can’t use the point method to calculate the slope at point B; 
you would have to use the arc method to approximate the slope of the curve 
in this area by drawing a straight line between points A and C. But if you have 
sufficient data to draw the smooth curve shown in panel (a) of Figure 2A-4, 
then you could use the point method to calculate the slope at point B—and at 
every other point along the curve as well.

Here a tangent line has been drawn, a line that

Maximum and Minimum Points
The slope of a nonlinear curve can change from positive to negative or vice versa. 
When the slope of a curve changes from positive to negative, it creates what is 
called a maximum point of the curve. When the slope of a curve changes from 
negative to positive, it creates a minimum point.
Panel (a) of Figure 2A-6 illustrates a curve in which the slope changes from 
positive to negative as you move from left to right. When x is between 0 and 50, 
the slope of the curve is positive. At x equal to 50, the curve attains its highest 
point—the largest value of y along the curve. This point is called the maximum of 
the curve. When x exceeds 50, the slope becomes negative as the curve turns down-
ward. Many important curves in economics, such as the curve that represents how 
the profit of a firm changes as it produces more output, are hill - shaped like this.

Panel (b) shows a curve with a minimum point, the point

A nonlinear curve may have a 
maximum point, the highest point 
along the curve. At the maximum, 
the slope of the curve changes from 
positive to negative.
A nonlinear curve may have a 
minimum point, the lowest point 
along the curve. At the minimum, 
the slope of the curve changes from 
negative to positive.
In contrast, the curve shown in panel (b) of Figure 2A-6 is U-shaped: it has a slope 
that changes from negative to positive. At x equal to 50, the curve reaches its lowest 
point—the smallest value of y along the curve. This point is called the minimum of the 
curve. Various important curves in economics, such as the curve that represents how 
per-unit the costs of some firms change as output increases, are U–shaped like this.
Calculating the Area Below 
or Above a Curve
Sometimes it is useful to be able to measure the size of the area below or above a 
curve. We will encounter one such case in an upcoming chapter. To keep things 
simple, we’ll only calculate the area below or above a linear curve.
How large is the shaded area below the linear curve in panel (a) of Figure 
2A-7? First note that this area has the shape of a right triangle. A right triangle 
is a triangle that has two sides that make a right angle with each other. We will 
refer to one of these sides as the height of the triangle and the other side as the 
base of the triangle. For our purposes, it doesn’t matter which of these two sides 

58    P A R T  1    W H AT I S EC O N O M I C S ?
we refer to as the base and which as the height. Calculating the area of a right 
triangle is straightforward: multiply the height of the triangle by the base of 
the triangle, and divide the result by 2. The height of the triangle in panel (a) 
of Figure 2A-7 is 10 − 4 = 6. And the base of the triangle is 3 − 0 = 3. So the area of 
that triangle is
6 × 3
2
 = 9
How about the shaded area above the linear curve in panel (b) of Figure 2A-7? 
We can use the same formula to calculate the area of this right triangle. The 
height of the triangle is 8 − 2 = 6. And the base of the triangle is 4 − 0 = 4. So the 
area of that triangle is
6 × 4
2
 = 12
Graphs That Depict Numerical 
Information
Graphs can also be used as a convenient way to summarize and display data with-
out assuming some underlying causal relationship. Graphs that simply display 
numerical information are called numerical graphs. Here we will consider four 
types of numerical graphs: time - series graphs, scatter diagrams, pie charts, and bar 
graphs. These are widely used to display real, empirical data about different eco-
nomic variables because they often help economists and policy makers identify 
patterns or trends in the economy. But as we will also see, you must be careful not 
to misinterpret or draw unwarranted conclusions from numerical graphs. That is, 
you must be aware of both the usefulness and the limitations of numerical graphs.

Types of Numerical Graphs
You have probably seen graphs in newspapers that show what has happened over 
time to economic variables such as the unemployment rate or stock prices. A time - 
series graph has successive dates on the horizontal axis and the values of a variable 
that occurred on those dates on the vertical axis. For example, Figure 2A-8 shows 
real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—a rough measure of a country’s stan-
dard of living—in the United States from 1947 to late 2010. A line connecting the 
points that correspond to real GDP per capita for each calendar quarter during those 
years gives a clear idea of the overall trend in the standard of living over these years.
Figure 2A-9 is an example of a different kind of numerical graph. It rep-
resents information from a sample of 184 countries on the standard of living,

try for a sample of 184 countries. The

between the two variables.

again measured by GDP per capita, and the amount of carbon emissions 
per capita, a measure of environmental pollution. Each point here indi-
cates an average resident’s standard of living and his or her annual car-
bon emissions for a given country. The points lying in the upper right of 
the graph, which show combinations of a high standard of living and high 
carbon emissions, represent economically advanced countries such as the 
United States. (The country with the highest carbon emissions, at the top 
of the graph, is Qatar.) Points lying in the bottom left of the graph, which 
show combinations of a low standard of living and low carbon emissions, 
represent economically less advanced countries such as Afghanistan and 
Sierra Leone. The pattern of points indicates that there is a positive rela-
tionship between living standard and carbon emissions per capita: on the 
whole, people create more pollution in countries with a higher standard 
of living. This type of graph is called a scatter diagram, a diagram in 
which each point corresponds to an actual observation of the x-variable 
and the y-variable. In scatter diagrams, a curve is typically fitted to the 
scatter of points; that is, a curve is drawn that approximates as closely as 
possible the general relationship between the variables. As you can see, 
the fitted line in Figure 2A-9 is upward sloping, indicating the underly-
ing positive relationship between the two variables. Scatter diagrams are 
often used to show how a general relationship can be inferred from a set 
of data.
A pie chart shows the share of a total amount that is accounted for 
by various components, usually expressed in percentages. For example, 
Figure 2A-10 is a pie chart that depicts the education levels of workers who 
in 2009 were paid the federal minimum wage or less. As you can see, the 
majority of workers paid at or below the minimum wage had no college 
degree. Only 8% of workers who were paid at or below the minimum wage 
had a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Bar graphs use bars of various heights or lengths to indicate values 
of a variable. In the bar graph in Figure 2A-11, the bars show the percent 
change in the number of unemployed workers in the United States from 
2009 to 2010, separately for White, Black or 
African - American, and Asian workers. Exact 
values of the variable that is being mea-
sured may be written at the end of the bar, 
as in this figure. For instance, the number 
of unemployed Black or African-American 
workers in the United States increased by 
9.4% between 2009 and 2010. But even with-
out the precise values, comparing the heights 
or lengths of the bars can give useful insight 
into the relative magnitudes of the different 
values of the variable.
Problems in Interpreting 
Numerical Graphs
Although the beginning of this appendix 
emphasized that graphs are visual images that 
make ideas or information easier to under-
stand, graphs can be constructed (intentional-
ly or unintentionally) in ways that are mislead-
ing and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. 
This section raises some issues that you should 
be aware of when you interpret graphs.

Features of Construction Before drawing any conclusions about what a 
numerical graph implies, you should pay attention to the scale, or size of incre-
ments, shown on the axes. Small increments tend to visually exaggerate changes 
in the variables, whereas large increments tend to visually diminish them. So 
the scale used in construction of a graph can influence your interpretation of the 
significance of the changes it illustrates—perhaps in an unwarranted way.
Take, for example, Figure 2A-12, which shows real GDP per capita in the 
United States from 1981 to 1982 using increments of $500. You can see that real 
GDP per capita fell from $26,208 to $25,189. A decrease, sure, but is it as enor-
mous as the scale chosen for the vertical axis makes it seem? If you go back and 
reexamine Figure 2A-8, which shows real GDP per capita in the United States 
from 1947 to late 2010, you can see that this would be a misguided conclusion. 
Figure 2A-8 includes the same data shown in Figure 2A-12, but it is constructed 
with a scale having increments of $10,000 rather than $500. From it you can see 
that the fall in real GDP per capita from 1981 to 1982 was, in fact, relatively insig-
nificant. In fact, the story of real GDP per capita—a measure of the standard of 
living—in the United States is mostly a story of ups, not downs. This comparison 
shows that if you are not careful to factor in the choice of scale in interpreting a 
graph, you can arrive at very different, and possibly misguided, conclusions.
Related to the choice of scale is the use of truncation in constructing a graph. 
An axis is truncated when part of the range is omitted. This is indicated by two 
slashes (//) in the axis near the origin. You can see that the vertical axis of Figure 
2A-12 has been truncated—some of the range of values from 0 to $25,000 has been 
omitted and a // appears in the axis. Truncation saves space in the presentation of 
a graph and allows smaller increments to be used in constructing it. As a result, 
changes in the variable depicted on a graph that has been truncated appear larger 
compared to a graph that has not been truncated and that uses larger increments.
You must also pay close attention to exactly what a graph is illustrating. For 
example, in Figure 2A-11, you should recognize that what is being shown here 
are percentage changes in the number of unemployed, not numerical changes. 
The unemployment rate for Black or African-American workers increased by the 
highest percentage, 9.4% in this example. If you confused numerical changes 
with percentage changes, you would erroneously conclude that the greatest 
number of newly unemployed workers were Black or African-American. But, in 
fact, a correct interpretation of Figure 2A-11 shows that the greatest number of 
newly unemployed workers were White: the total number of unemployed White

Some of the same data for the years 1981 
and 1982 used in Figure 2A-8 are rep-
resented here, except that here they are 
shown using increments of $500 rather 
than increments of $10,000. As a result 
of this change in scale, changes in the 
standard of living look much larger in this 
figure compared to Figure 2A-8.

workers grew by 268,000 workers, which is greater than the increase in the 
number of unemployed Black or African-American workers, which is 246,000 in 
this example. Although there was a higher percentage increase in the number 
of unemployed Black or African-American workers, the number of unemployed 
Black or African-American workers in the United States in 2009 was smaller than 
the number of unemployed White workers, leading to a smaller number of newly 
unemployed Black or African-American workers than White workers.
Omitted Variables From a scatter diagram that shows two variables moving 
either positively or negatively in relation to each other, it is easy to conclude that 
there is a causal relationship. But relationships between two variables are not 
always due to direct cause and effect. Quite possibly an observed relationship 
between two variables is due to the unobserved effect of a third variable on each 
of the other two variables. An unobserved variable that, through its influence 
on other variables, creates the erroneous appearance of a direct causal relation-
ship among those variables is called an omitted variable. For example, in New 
England, a greater amount of snowfall during a given week will typically cause 
people to buy more snow shovels. It will also cause people to buy more de - icer 
fluid. But if you omitted the influence of the snowfall and simply plotted the 
number of snow shovels sold versus the number of bottles of de - icer fluid sold, 
you would produce a scatter diagram that showed an upward tilt in the pattern 
of points, indicating a positive relationship between snow shovels sold and de - 
icer fluid sold. To attribute a causal relationship between these two variables, 
however, is misguided; more snow shovels sold do not cause more de - icer fluid 
to be sold, or vice versa. They move together because they are both influenced 
by a third, determining, variable—the weekly snowfall, which is the omitted 
variable in this case. So before assuming that a pattern in a scatter diagram 
implies a cause - and - effect relationship, it is important to consider whether the 
pattern is instead the result of an omitted variable. Or to put it succinctly: cor-
relation is not causation.
Reverse Causality Even when you are confident that there is no omitted 
variable and that there is a causal relationship between two variables shown in 
a numerical graph, you must also be careful that you don’t make the mistake 
of reverse causality—coming to an erroneous conclusion about which is the 
dependent and which is the independent variable by reversing the true direction 
of causality between the two variables. For example, imagine a scatter diagram 
that depicts the grade point averages (GPAs) of 20 of your classmates on one axis 
and the number of hours that each of them spends studying on the other. A line 
fitted between the points will probably have a positive slope, showing a positive 
relationship between GPA and hours of studying. We could reasonably infer that 
hours spent studying is the independent variable and that GPA is the dependent 
variable. But you could make the error of reverse causality: you could infer that 
a high GPA causes a student to study more, whereas a low GPA causes a student 
to study less.
The significance of understanding how graphs can mislead or be incorrectly 
interpreted is not purely academic. Policy decisions, business decisions, and 
political arguments are often based on interpretation of the types of numerical 
graphs that we’ve just discussed. Problems of misleading features of construction, 
omitted variables, and reverse causality can lead to very important and undesir-
able consequences.
An omitted variable is an 
unobserved variable that, through its 
influence on other variables, creates 
the erroneous appearance of a direct 
causal relationship among those 
variables.
The error of reverse causality is 
committed when the true direction 
of causality between two variables 
is reversed.

PROBLEMS
 1. Study the four accompanying diagrams. Consider the fol-
lowing statements and indicate which diagram matches 
each statement. Which variable would appear on the 
horizontal and which on the vertical axis? In each of these 
statements, is the slope positive, negative, zero, or infinity?

Panel (d)
 a. If the price of movies increases, fewer consumers go 
to see movies.
 b. More experienced workers typically have higher 
incomes than less experienced workers.
 c. Whatever the temperature outside, Americans con-
sume the same number of hot dogs per day.
 d. Consumers buy more frozen yogurt when the price 
of ice cream goes up.
 e. Research finds no relationship between the number 
of diet books purchased and the number of pounds 
lost by the average dieter.
 f. Regardless of its price, Americans buy the same 
quantity of salt.
 2. During the Reagan administration, economist Arthur 
Laffer argued in favor of lowering income tax rates in 
order to increase tax revenues. Like most economists, 
he believed that at tax rates above a certain level, tax 
revenue would fall because high taxes would discour-
age some people from working and that people would 
refuse to work at all if they received no income after 
paying taxes. This relationship between tax rates and 
tax revenue is graphically summarized in what is wide-
ly known as the Laffer curve. Plot the Laffer curve rela-
tionship assuming that it has the shape of a nonlinear 
curve. The following questions will help you construct 
the graph.
 a. Which is the independent variable? Which is the 
dependent variable? On which axis do you therefore 
measure the income tax rate? On which axis do you 
measure income tax revenue?
 b. What would tax revenue be at a 0% income tax rate?
 c. The maximum possible income tax rate is 100%. 
What would tax revenue be at a 100% income tax 
rate?
 d. Estimates now show that the maximum point on the 
Laffer curve is (approximately) at a tax rate of 80%. 
For tax rates less than 80%, how would you describe 
the relationship between the tax rate and tax rev-
enue, and how is this relationship reflected in the 
slope? For tax rates higher than 80%, how would you 
describe the relationship between the tax rate and 
tax revenue, and how is this relationship reflected in 
the slope?
 3. In the accompanying figures, the numbers on the axes 
have been lost. All you know is that the units shown on 
the vertical axis are the same as the units on the hori-
zontal axis.

 4. Answer each of the following questions by drawing a 
schematic diagram.
 a. Taking measurements of the slope of a curve at 
three points farther and farther to the right along 
the horizontal axis, the slope of the curve changes 
from −0.3, to −0.8, to −2.5, measured by the point 
method. Draw a schematic diagram of this curve. 
How would you describe the relationship illustrated 
in your diagram?
 b. Taking measurements of the slope of a curve at five 
points farther and farther to the right along the hor-
izontal axis, the slope of the curve changes from 1.5, 
to 0.5, to 0, to −0.5, to −1.5, measured by the point 
method. Draw a schematic diagram of this curve. 
Does it have a maximum or a minimum?

 8. Studies have found a relationship between a country’s 
yearly rate of economic growth and the yearly rate of 
increase in airborne pollutants. It is believed that a higher 
rate of economic growth allows a country’s residents to 
have more cars and travel more, thereby releasing more 
air borne pollutants.
 a. Which variable is the independent variable? Which 
is the dependent variable?
 b. Suppose that in the country of Sudland, when the year-
ly rate of economic growth fell from 3.0% to 1.5%, the 
yearly rate of increase in air borne pollutants fell from 
6% to 5%. What is the average slope of a non linear 
curve between these points using the arc method?
 c. Now suppose that when the yearly rate of economic 
growth rose from 3.5% to 4.5%, the yearly rate of 
increase in air borne pollutants rose from 5.5% to 
7.5%. What is the average slope of a nonlinear curve 
between these two points using the arc method?
 d. How would you describe the relationship between 
the two variables here?
 9. An insurance company has found that the severity of 
property damage in a fire is positively related to the 
number of firefighters arriving at the scene.
 a. Draw a diagram that depicts this finding with num-
ber of firefighters on the horizontal axis and amount 
of property damage on the vertical axis. What is 
the argument made by this diagram? Suppose you 
reverse what is measured on the two axes. What is 
the argument made then?
 b. In order to reduce its payouts to policyholders, 
should the insurance company therefore ask the city 
to send fewer firefighters to any fire?
 10. The accompanying table illustrates annual salaries and 
income tax owed by five individuals. Apart from the 
fact that they receive different salaries and owe differ-
ent amounts of income tax, these five individuals are 
otherwise identical.

would be the average slope of the curve between the 
points for Eduardo’s and Camila’s salaries and taxes 
using the arc method? How would you interpret this 
value for slope?

F YOU BOUGHT A PAIR OF BLUE
jeans in 2011, you may have been 
shocked at the price. Or maybe not: fash-
ions change, and maybe you thought you 
were paying the price for being fashion-
able. But you weren’t—you were paying 
for cotton. Jeans are made of denim, 
which is a particular weave of cotton, 
and by late 2010, when jeans manufac-
turers were buying supplies for the com-
ing year, cotton prices were more than 
triple their level just two years earlier. 
By December 2010, the price of a pound 
of cotton had hit a 140-year high, the 
highest cotton price since records began 
in 1870.
And why were cotton prices so high?
On one side, demand for clothing of 
all kinds was surging. In 2008–2009, as 
the world struggled with the effects of a 
financial crisis, nervous consumers cut 
back on clothing purchases. But by 2010, 
with the worst apparently over, buyers 
were back in force. On the supply side, 
severe weather events hit world cotton 
production. Most notably, Pakistan, the 
world’s fourth-largest cotton producer, 
was hit by devastating floods that put 
one-fifth of the country underwater and 
virtually destroyed its cotton crop.
Fearing that consumers had limit-
ed tolerance for large increases in the 
price of cotton clothing, apparel mak-
ers began scrambling to find ways to 
reduce costs without offending con-
sumers’ fashion sense. They adopted 
changes like smaller buttons, cheaper 
linings, and—yes—polyester, doubting 
that consumers would be willing to pay 
more for cotton goods. In fact, some 
experts on the cotton market warned 
that the sky-high prices of cotton in 
2010–2011 might lead to a permanent 
shift in tastes, with consumers becom-
ing more willing to wear synthetics even 
when cotton prices came down.
At the same time, it was not all bad 
news for everyone connected with the 
cotton trade. In the United States, cot-
ton producers had not been hit by bad 
weather and were relishing the higher 
prices. American farmers responded to 
sky-high cotton prices by sharply increas-
ing the acreage devoted to the crop. None 
of this was enough, however, to produce 
immediate price relief.
Wait a minute: how, exactly, does 
flooding in Pakistan translate into high-
er jeans prices and more polyester in 
your T-shirts? It’s a matter of supply and 
demand—but what does that mean? 
Many people use “supply and demand” 
as a sort of catchphrase to mean “the 
laws of the marketplace at work.” To 
economists, however, the concept of 
supply and demand has a precise mean-
ing: it is a model of how a market behaves
that is extremely useful for understand-
ing many—but not all—markets.
In this chapter, we lay out the 
pieces that make up the supply and 
demand model, put them together, and 
show how this model can be used to 
understand how many—but not all—
markets behave.

Supply and Demand: A Model 
of a Competitive Market
C
otton sellers and cotton buyers constitute a market—a group of produc-
ers and consumers who exchange a good or service for payment. In this 
chapter, we’ll focus on a particular type of market known as a competitive 
market. Roughly, a competitive market is a market in which there are many 
buyers and sellers of the same good or service. More precisely, the key feature of 
a competitive market is that no individual’s actions have a noticeable effect on the 
price at which the good or service is sold. It’s important to understand, however, 
that this is not an accurate description of every market.
For example, it’s not an accurate description of the market for cola beverages. 
That’s because in the market for cola beverages, Coca-Cola and Pepsi account for 
such a large proportion of total sales that they are able to influence the price at 
which cola beverages are bought and sold. But it is an accurate description of the 
market for cotton. The global marketplace for cotton is so huge that even a jeans 
maker as large as Levi Strauss & Co. accounts for only a tiny fraction of transac-
tions, making it unable to influence the price at which cotton is bought and sold.
It’s a little hard to explain why competitive markets are different from other 
markets until we’ve seen how a competitive market works. So let’s take a rain 
check—we’ll return to that issue at the end of this chapter. For now, let’s just say 
that it’s easier to model competitive markets than other markets. When taking an 
exam, it’s always a good strategy to begin by answering the easier questions. In this 
book, we’re going to do the same thing. So we will start with competitive markets.
When a market is competitive, its behavior is well described by the supply 
and demand model. Because many markets are competitive, the supply and 
demand model is a very useful one indeed.
There are five key elements in this model:
 • The demand curve 
 • The supply curve 
 • The set of factors that cause the demand curve to shift and the set of factors 
that cause the supply curve to shift
 • The market equilibrium, which includes the equilibrium price and equilibrium 
quantity
 • The way the market equilibrium changes when the supply curve or demand 
curve shifts
To understand the supply and demand model, we will examine each of these elements.
The Demand Curve
H
ow many pounds of cotton, packaged in the form of blue jeans, do consumers 
around the world want to buy in a given year? You might at first think that we 
can answer this question by looking at the total number of pairs of blue jeans 
purchased around the world each day, multiply that number by the amount of cotton 
it takes to make a pair of jeans, and then multiply by 365. But that’s not enough to 
answer the question, because how many pairs of jeans—in other words, how many 
pounds of cotton—consumers want to buy depends on the price of a pound of cotton.
When the price of cotton rises, as it did in 2010, some people will respond to the 
higher price of cotton clothing by buying fewer cotton garments or, perhaps, by switch-
ing completely to garments made from other materials, such as synthetics or linen. In 
general, the quantity of cotton clothing, or of any good or service that people want to 
buy, depends on the price. The higher the price, the less of the good or service people 
want to purchase; alternatively, the lower the price, the more they want to purchase.
A competitive market is a market 
in which there are many buyers and 
sellers of the same good or service, 
none of whom can influence the 
price at which the good or service 
is sold.
The supply and demand model 
is a model of how a competitive 
market behaves.

C H A P T E R  3    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D    67
So the answer to the question “How many pounds of cotton do consumers 
want to buy?” depends on the price of a pound of cotton. If you don’t yet know 
what the price will be, you can start by making a table of how many pounds of 
cotton people would want to buy at a number of different prices. Such a table is 
known as a demand schedule. This, in turn, can be used to draw a demand curve, 
which is one of the key elements of the supply and demand model.
The Demand Schedule and the Demand Curve 
A demand schedule is a table showing how much of a good or service consumers 
will want to buy at different prices. At the right of Figure 3-1, we show a hypothetical 
demand schedule for cotton. It’s hypothetical in that it doesn’t use actual data on the 
world demand for cotton and it assumes that all cotton is of equal quality. 
According to the table, if a pound of cotton costs $1, consumers around the 
world will want to purchase 10 billion pounds of cotton over the course of a 
year. If the price is $1.25 a pound, they will want to buy only 8.9 billion pounds; 
if the price is only $0.75 a pound, they will want to buy 11.5 billion pounds; and 
so on. The higher the price, the fewer pounds of cotton consumers will want to 
purchase. So, as the price rises, the quantity demanded of cotton—the actual 
amount consumers are willing to buy at some specific price—falls.
The graph in Figure 3-1 is a visual representation of the information in the table. 
(You might want to review the discussion of graphs in economics in the appendix to 
Chapter 2.) The vertical axis shows the price of a pound of cotton and the horizontal 
axis shows the quantity of cotton in pounds. Each point on the graph corresponds

Demand Schedule for Cotton
As price rises, 
the quantity 
demanded falls.
The demand schedule for cotton yields the corre-
sponding demand curve, which shows how much 
of a good or service consumers want to buy at any 
given price. The demand curve and the demand 
schedule reflect the law of demand: As price 
rises, the quantity demanded falls. Similarly, a fall 
in price raises the quantity demanded. As a result, 
the demand curve is downward sloping.
A demand schedule shows 
how much of a good or service 
consumers will want to buy at 
different prices.
The quantity demanded is the 
actual amount of a good or service 
consumers are willing to buy at some 
specific price.

to one of the entries in the table. The curve that connects these points is a demand 
curve. A demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand schedule, 
another way of showing the relationship between the quantity demanded and price.
Note that the demand curve shown in Figure 3-1 slopes downward. This 
reflects the general proposition that a higher price reduces the quantity demand-
ed. For example, jeans-makers know that they will sell fewer pairs when the price 
of a pair of jeans is higher, reflecting a $2 price for a pound of cotton, compared 
to the number they will sell when the price of a pair is lower, reflecting a price of 
only $1 for a pound of cotton. Similarly, someone who buys a pair of cotton jeans 
when its price is relatively low will switch to synthetic or linen when the price of 
cotton jeans is relatively high. So in the real world, demand curves almost always 
do slope downward. (The exceptions are so rare that for practical purposes we 
can ignore them.) Generally, the proposition that a higher price for a good, other 
things equal, leads people to demand a smaller quantity of that good is so reliable 
that economists are willing to call it a “law”—the law of demand.
Shifts of the Demand Curve
Although cotton prices in 2010 were higher than they had been in 2007, total 
world consumption of cotton was higher in 2010. How can we reconcile this 
fact with the law of demand, which says that a higher price reduces the quantity 
demanded, other things equal?
The answer lies in the crucial phrase other things equal. In this case, other 
things weren’t equal: the world had changed between 2007 and 2010, in ways 
that increased the quantity of cotton demanded at any given price. For one 
thing, the world’s population, and therefore the number of potential cotton 
clothing wearers, increased. In addition, the growing popularity of cotton 
clothing, as well as higher incomes in countries like China that allowed people 
to buy more clothing than before, led to an increase in the quantity of cotton 
demanded at any given price. Figure 3-2 illustrates this phenomenon using the 
For a real-world illustration of the law of demand, 
consider how gasoline consumption varies according 
to the prices consumers pay at the pump. Because 
of high taxes, gasoline and diesel fuel are more than 
twice as expensive in most European countries as in 
the United States. According to the law of demand, 
this should lead Europeans to buy less gasoline than 
Americans—and they do. As you can see from the 
figure, per person, Europeans consume less than half 
as much fuel as Americans, mainly because they drive 
smaller cars with better mileage.
Prices aren’t the only factor affecting fuel consump-
tion, but they’re probably the main cause of the differ-
ence between European and American fuel consump-
tion per person.

A demand curve is a graphical 
representation of the demand 
schedule. It shows the relationship 
between quantity demanded and 
price.
The law of demand says that a 
higher price for a good or service, 
other things equal, leads people to 
demand a smaller quantity of that 
good or service.

demand schedule and demand curve for cotton. (As before, the numbers in 
Figure 3-2 are hypothetical.)
The table in Figure 3-2 shows two demand schedules. The first is the demand 
schedule for 2007, the same as shown in Figure 3-1. The second is the demand 
schedule for 2010. It differs from the 2007 demand schedule due to factors such 
as a larger population and the increased popularity of cotton clothing, factors 
that led to an increase in the quantity of cotton demanded at any given price. So 
at each price the 2010 schedule shows a larger quantity demanded than the 2007 
schedule. For example, the quantity of cotton consumers wanted to buy at a price of 
$1 per pound increased from 10 billion to 12 billion pounds per year, the quantity 
demanded at $1.25 per pound went from 8.9 billion to 10.7 billion, and so on.
What is clear from this example is that the changes that occurred between 
2007 and 2010 generated a new demand schedule, one in which the quantity 
demanded was greater at any given price than in the original demand schedule. 
The two curves in Figure 3-2 show the same information graphically. As you can 
see, the demand schedule for 2010 corresponds to a new demand curve, D2, that 
is to the right of the demand schedule for 2007, D1. This shift of the demand 
curve shows the change in the quantity demanded at any given price, represented 
by the change in position of the original demand curve D1 to its new location at D2.
It’s crucial to make the distinction between such shifts of the demand curve and 
movements along the demand curve, changes in the quantity demanded of a 
good arising from a change in that good’s price. Figure 3-3 on the next page illustrates 
the difference.
The movement from point A to point B is a movement along the demand curve: the 
quantity demanded rises due to a fall in price as you move down D1. Here, a fall in the 
price of cotton from $1.50 to $1 per pound generates a rise in the quantity demanded 
from 8.1 billion to 10 billion pounds per year. But the quantity demanded can also rise

An increase in the population is one factor that gen-
erates an increase in demand—a rise in the quantity 
demanded at any given price. This is represented by 
the two demand schedules—one showing demand in 
2007, before the rise in population, the other show-
ing demand in 2010, after the rise in population—and 
their corresponding demand curves. The increase in 
demand shifts the demand curve to the right.
A shift of the demand curve is a 
change in the quantity demanded at 
any given price, represented by the 
change of the original demand curve 
to a new position, denoted by a new 
demand curve.
A movement along the demand 
curve is a change in the quantity 
demanded of a good arising from a 
change in the good’s price.

70    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
when the price is unchanged if there is an increase in demand—a rightward shift of 
the demand curve. This is illustrated in Figure 3-3 by the shift of the demand curve 
from D1 to D2. Holding the price constant at $1.50 a pound, the quantity demanded 
rises from 8.1 billion pounds at point A on D1 to 9.7 billion pounds at point C on D2.
When economists say “the demand for X increased” or “the demand for Y 
decreased,” they mean that the demand curve for X or Y shifted—not that the 
quantity demanded rose or fell because of a change in the price.
Movement Along the Demand Curve versus Shift of the Demand Curve

The rise in quantity demanded when going from 
point A to point B reflects a movement along the

of the good. The rise in quantity demanded when 
going from point A to point C reflects a shift of the 
demand curve: it is the result of a rise in the quan-
tity demanded at any given price.

Understanding Shifts of the Demand Curve
Figure 3-4 illustrates the two basic ways in which demand curves can shift. When 
economists talk about an “increase in demand,” they mean a rightward shift of the 
demand curve: at any given price, consumers demand a larger quantity of the good 
or service than before. This is shown by the rightward shift of the original demand 
curve D1 to D2. And when economists talk about a “decrease in demand,” they mean 
a leftward shift of the demand curve: at any given price, consumers demand a smaller 
quantity of the good or service than before. This is shown by the leftward shift of the 
original demand curve D1 to D3.
PITFALLS
DEMAND VERSUS QUANTITY 
DEMANDED
When economists say “an increase in 
demand,” they mean a rightward shift of 
the demand curve, and when they say “a 
decrease in demand,” they mean a leftward 
shift of the demand curve—that is, when 
they’re being careful. In ordinary speech 
most people, including professional econo-
mists, use the word demand casually. For 
example, an economist might say “the 
demand for air travel has doubled over the 
past 15 years, partly because of falling air-
fares” when he or she really means that the 
quantity demanded has doubled.
It’s OK to be a bit sloppy in ordinary 
conversation. But when you’re doing 
economic analysis, it’s important to 
make the distinction between changes 
in the quantity demanded, which involve 
movements along a demand curve, 
and shifts of the demand curve (See 
Figure 3-3 for an illustration). Sometimes 
students end up writing something like 
this: “If demand increases, the price 
will go up, but that will lead to a fall 
in demand, which pushes the price 
down . . .” and then go around in circles. 
If you make a clear distinction between 
changes in demand, which mean shifts 
of the demand curve, and changes in 
quantity demanded, you can avoid a lot 
of confusion.

What caused the demand curve for cotton to shift? We have already men-
tioned two reasons: changes in population and a change in the popularity of cot-
ton clothing. If you think about it, you can come up with other things that would 
be likely to shift the demand curve for cotton. For example, suppose that the price 
of polyester rises. This will induce some people who previously bought polyester 
clothing to buy cotton clothing instead, increasing the demand for cotton.
Economists believe that there are five principal factors that shift the demand 
curve for a good or service:
 • Changes in the prices of related goods or services
 • Changes in income
 • Changes in tastes
 • Changes in expectations
 • Changes in the number of consumers
Although this is not an exhaustive list, it contains the five most important fac-
tors that can shift demand curves. So when we say that the quantity of a good or 
service demanded falls as its price rises, other things equal, we are in fact stating 
that the factors that shift demand are remaining unchanged. Let’s now explore, 
in more detail, how those factors shift the demand curve.
Changes in the Prices of Related Goods or Services Although there’s 
nothing quite like a comfortable pair of all-cotton blue jeans, for some purposes 
khakis—generally made from polyester blends—aren’t a bad alternative. Khakis 
are what economists call a substitute for jeans. A pair of goods are substitutes if a 
rise in the price of one good (jeans) makes consumers more willing to buy the other 
good (khakis). Substitutes are usually goods that in some way serve a similar func-
tion: coffee and tea, muffins and doughnuts, train rides and air flights. A rise in 
the price of the alternative good induces some consumers to purchase the original 
good instead of it, shifting demand for the original good to the right.
But sometimes a rise in the price of one good makes consumers less will-
ing to buy another good. Such pairs of goods are known as complements. 
Complements are usually goods that in some sense are consumed together: com-
puters and software, cappuccinos and cookies, cars and gasoline. Because con-
sumers like to consume a good and its complement together, a change in the price 
Two goods are substitutes if a 
rise in the price of one of the goods 
leads to an increase in the demand 
for the other good.
Two goods are complements if a 
rise in the price of one good leads 
to a decrease in the demand for the 
other good.

72    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
of one of the goods will affect the demand for its complement. In particular, when 
the price of one good rises, the demand for its complement decreases, shifting the 
demand curve for the complement to the left. So, for example, when the price of 
gasoline rose in 2007–2008, the demand for gas-guzzling cars fell.
Changes in Income When individuals have more income, they are normally 
more likely to purchase a good at any given price. For example, if a family’s 
income rises, it is more likely to take that long-anticipated summer trip to Disney 
World—and therefore also more likely to buy plane tickets. So a rise in consumer 
incomes will cause the demand curves for most goods to shift to the right.
Why do we say “most goods,” not “all goods”? Most goods are normal 
goods—the demand for them increases when consumer income rises. However, 
the demand for some products falls when income rises. Goods for which 
demand decreases when income rises are known as inferior goods. Usually an 
inferior good is one that is considered less desirable than more expensive alter-
natives—such as a bus ride versus a taxi ride. When they can afford to, people 
stop buying an inferior good and switch their consumption to the preferred, 
more expensive alternative. So when a good is inferior, a rise in income shifts 
the demand curve to the left. And, not surprisingly, a fall in income shifts the 
demand curve to the right.
One example of the distinction between normal and inferior goods that has 
drawn considerable attention in the business press is the difference between so-
called casual-dining restaurants such as Applebee’s or Olive Garden and fast-food 
chains such as McDonald’s and KFC. When Americans’ income rises, they tend 
to eat out more at casual-dining restaurants. However, some of this increased 
dining out comes at the expense of fast-food venues—to some extent, people visit 
McDonald’s less once they can afford to move upscale. So casual dining is a nor-
mal good, whereas fast-food consumption appears to be an inferior good.
Changes in Tastes Why do people want what they want? Fortunately, we don’t 
need to answer that question—we just need to acknowledge that people have certain 
preferences, or tastes, that determine what they choose to consume and that these 
tastes can change. Economists usually lump together changes in demand due to fads, 
beliefs, cultural shifts, and so on under the heading of changes in tastes or preferences.
For example, once upon a time men wore hats. Up until around World War II, 
a respectable man wasn’t fully dressed unless he wore a dignified hat along with 
his suit. But the returning GIs adopted a more informal style, perhaps due to the 
rigors of the war. And President Eisenhower, who had been supreme commander 
of Allied Forces before becoming president, often went hatless. After World War 
II, it was clear that the demand curve for hats had shifted leftward, reflecting a 
decrease in the demand for hats.
Economists have relatively little to say about the forces that influence con-
sumers’ tastes. (Although marketers and advertisers have plenty to say about 
them!) However, a change in tastes has a predictable impact on demand. When 
tastes change in favor of a good, more people want to buy it at any given price, so 
the demand curve shifts to the right. When tastes change against a good, fewer 
people want to buy it at any given price, so the demand curve shifts to the left.
Changes in Expectations When consumers have some choice about when 
to make a purchase, current demand for a good is often affected by expectations 
about its future price. For example, savvy shoppers often wait for seasonal sales—
say, buying next year’s holiday gifts during the post-holiday markdowns. In this 
case, expectations of a future drop in price lead to a decrease in demand today. 
Alternatively, expectations of a future rise in price are likely to cause an increase 
in demand today. For example, as cotton prices began to rise in 2010, many textile 
mills began purchasing more cotton and stockpiling it in anticipation of further 
price increases.
When a rise in income increases 
the demand for a good—the normal 
case—it is a normal good.
When a rise in income decreases 
the demand for a good, it is an 
inferior good.

C H A P T E R  3    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D    73
Expected changes in future income can also lead to changes in demand: if 
you expect your income to rise in the future, you will typically borrow today and 
increase your demand for certain goods; if you expect your income to fall in the 
future, you are likely to save today and reduce your demand for some goods.
Changes in the Number of Consumers As we’ve already noted, one of the rea-
sons for rising cotton demand between 2007 and 2010 was a growing world popula-
tion. Because of population growth, overall demand for cotton would have risen even 
if the demand of each individual wearer of cotton clothing had remained unchanged.
Let’s introduce a new concept: the individual demand curve, which shows 
the relationship between quantity demanded and price for an individual con-
sumer. For example, suppose that Darla is a consumer of cotton blue jeans; also 
suppose that all pairs of jeans are the same, so they sell for the same price. Panel 
(a) of Figure 3-5 shows how many pairs of jeans she will buy per year at any given 
price. Then DDarla is Darla’s individual demand curve.
The market demand curve shows how the combined quantity demanded by all 
consumers depends on the market price of that good. (Most of the time, when 
economists refer to the demand curve, they mean the market demand curve.) The 
market demand curve is the horizontal sum of the individual demand curves of 
all consumers in that market. To see what we mean by the term horizontal sum, 
assume for a moment that there are only two consumers of blue jeans, Darla and 
Dino. Dino’s individual demand curve, DDino, is shown in panel (b). Panel (c) shows 
the market demand curve. At any given price, the quantity demanded by the mar-
ket is the sum of the quantities demanded by Darla and Dino. For example, at a 
price of $30 per pair, Darla demands 3 pairs of jeans per year and Dino demands 
2 pairs per year. So the quantity demanded by the market is 5 pairs per year.
Clearly, the quantity demanded by the market at any given price is larger with Dino 
present than it would be if Darla were the only consumer. The quantity demanded at

Darla and Dino are the only two consumers of blue jeans 
in the market. Panel (a) shows Darla’s individual demand 
curve: the number of pairs of blue jeans she will buy per 
year at any given price. Panel (b) shows Dino’s individual 
demand curve. Given that Darla and Dino are the only 
two consumers, the market demand curve, which shows 
the quantity of blue jeans demanded by all consumers 
at any given price, is shown in panel (c). The market 
demand curve is the horizontal sum of the individual 
demand curves of all consumers. In this case, at any 
given price, the quantity demanded by the market is the 
sum of the quantities demanded by Darla and Dino.

any given price would be even larger if we added a third consumer, then a fourth, and 
so on. So an increase in the number of consumers leads to an increase in demand.
For a review of the factors that shift demand, see Table 3-1.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
BEATING THE TRAFFIC
A
ll big cities have traffic problems, and many local authorities try to discour-
age driving in the crowded city center. If we think of an auto trip to the city 
center as a good that people consume, we can use the economics of demand to 
analyze anti-traffic policies.
One common strategy is to reduce the demand for auto trips by lowering the 
prices of substitutes. Many metropolitan areas subsidize bus and rail service, 
hoping to lure commuters out of their cars. An alternative is to raise the price of 
complements: several major U.S. cities impose high taxes on commercial parking 
garages and impose short time limits on parking meters, both to raise revenue 
and to discourage people from driving into the city.
A few major cities—including Singapore, London, Oslo, Stockholm, and 
Milan—have been willing to adopt a direct and politically controversial 
approach: reducing congestion by raising the price of driving. Under “conges-
tion pricing” (or “congestion charging” in the United Kingdom), a charge is 
imposed on cars entering the city center during business hours. Drivers buy 
passes, which are then debited electronically as they drive by monitoring 
stations. Compliance is monitored with automatic cameras that photograph 
license plates. Moscow is currently contemplating a congestion charge scheme 
to tackle the worst traffic jams of all major cities, with 40% of drivers reporting 
traffic jams exceeding three hours.
The current daily cost of driving in London ranges from £9 to £12 (about $13 
to $19). And drivers who don’t pay and are caught pay a fine of £120 (about $192) 
for each transgression.
Not surprisingly, studies have shown that after the implementation of con-
gestion pricing, traffic does indeed decrease. In the 1990s, London had some of 
the worst traffic in Europe. The introduction of its congestion charge in 2003 
immediately reduced traffic in the London city center by about 15%, with overall 
traffic falling by 21% between 2002 and 2006. And there was increased use of 
substitutes, such as public transportation, bicycles, motorbikes, and ride-sharing. 
In the United States, the U.S. Department of Transportation has implemented 
pilot programs in five locations to study congestion pricing. Some transportation 
experts have even suggested using variable congestion prices, raising prices dur-
ing peak commuting hours. So although congestion pricing may be controversial, 
it appears to be slowly gaining acceptance.

• The supply and demand model is a 
model of a competitive market—one 
in which there are many buyers and 
sellers of the same good or service.
• The demand schedule shows how 
the quantity demanded changes as 
the price changes. A demand curve 
illustrates this relationship.
• The law of demand asserts that a 
higher price reduces the quantity 
demanded. Thus, demand curves 
normally slope downward.
• An increase in demand leads to a 
rightward shift of the demand curve: 
the quantity demanded rises for any 
given price. A decrease in demand 
leads to a leftward shift: the quantity 
demanded falls for any given price. A 
change in price results in a change in 
the quantity demanded and a move-
ment along the demand curve.
• The five main factors that can shift 
the demand curve are changes in (1) 
the price of a related good, such as 
a substitute or a complement, (2) 
income, (3) tastes, (4) expectations, 
and (5) the number of consumers.
• The market demand curve is the hori-
zontal sum of the individual demand 
curves of all consumers in the market.

The Supply Curve
S
ome parts of the world are especially well suited to growing cotton, and the 
United States is one of those. But even in the United States, some land is 
better suited to growing cotton than other land. Whether American farmers 
restrict their cotton-growing to only the most ideal locations or expand it to less 
suitable land depends on the price they expect to get for their cotton. Moreover, 
there are many other areas in the world where cotton could be grown—such as 
Pakistan, Brazil, Turkey, and China. Whether farmers there actually grow cotton 
depends, again, on the price.
So just as the quantity of cotton that consumers want to buy depends on the 
price they have to pay, the quantity that producers are willing to produce and 
sell—the quantity supplied—depends on the price they are offered.
The Supply Schedule and the Supply Curve
The table in Figure 3-6 shows how the quantity of cotton made available varies 
with the price—that is, it shows a hypothetical supply schedule for cotton.
A supply schedule works the same way as the demand schedule shown in 
Figure 3-1: in this case, the table shows the number of pounds of cotton farmers 
are willing to sell at different prices. At a price of $0.50 per pound, farmers are 
willing to sell only 8 billion pounds of cotton per year. At $0.75 per pound, they’re 
willing to sell 9.1 billion pounds. At $1, they’re willing to sell 10 billion pounds, 
and so on.

The supply schedule for cotton is plotted to yield 
the corresponding supply curve, which shows 
how much of a good producers are willing to sell 
at any given price. The supply curve and the sup-
ply schedule reflect the fact that supply curves 
are usually upward sloping: the quantity supplied 
rises when the price rises.
The quantity supplied is the actual 
amount of a good or service people 
are willing to sell at some specific 
price.
A supply schedule shows how 
much of a good or service would be 
supplied at different prices.

C H A P T E R  3    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D    77
In the same way that a demand schedule can be represented graphically by 
a demand curve, a supply schedule can be represented by a supply curve, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. Each point on the curve represents an entry from the table.
Suppose that the price of cotton rises from $1 to $1.25; we can see that the quan-
tity of cotton farmers are willing to sell rises from 10 billion to 10.7 billion pounds. 
This is the normal situation for a supply curve, that a higher price leads to a higher 
quantity supplied. So just as demand curves normally slope downward, supply 
curves normally slope upward: the higher the price being offered, the more of any 
good or service producers will be willing to sell.
Shifts of the Supply Curve
Until recently, cotton remained relatively cheap over the past several decades. One 
reason is that the amount of land cultivated for cotton expanded over 35% from 
1945 to 2007. However, the major factor accounting for cotton’s relative cheap-
ness was advances in the production technology, with output per acre more than 
quadrupling from 1945 to 2007. Figure 3-7 illustrates these events in terms of the 
supply schedule and the supply curve for cotton.
The table in Figure 3-7 shows two supply schedules. The schedule before improved 
cotton-growing technology was adopted is the same one as in Figure 3-6. The second 
schedule shows the supply of cotton after the improved technology was adopted.  Just 
as a change in demand schedules leads to a shift of the demand curve, a change in 
supply schedules leads to a shift of the supply curve—a change in the quantity 
supplied at any given price. This is shown in Figure 3-7 by the shift of the supply 
curve before the adoption of new cotton-growing technology, S1, to its new position 
after the adoption of new cotton-growing technology, S2. Notice that S2 lies to the 
right of S1, a reflection of the fact that quantity supplied rises at any given price.

The adoption of improved cotton-growing technol-
ogy generated an increase in supply—a rise in the 
quantity supplied at any given price. This event is rep-
resented by the two supply schedules—one showing 
supply before the new technology was adopted, the 
other showing supply after the new technology was 
adopted—and their corresponding supply curves. The 
increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right.
A supply curve shows the 
relationship between quantity 
supplied and price.
A shift of the supply curve is a 
change in the quantity supplied of a 
good or service at any given price. 
It is represented by the change of 
the original supply curve to a new 
position, denoted by a new supply 
curve.

78    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
As in the analysis of demand, it’s crucial to draw a distinction between such 
shifts of the supply curve and movements along the supply curve—changes in 
the quantity supplied arising from a change in price. We can see this difference 
in Figure 3-8. The movement from point A to point B is a movement along the 
supply curve: the quantity supplied rises along S1 due to a rise in price. Here, a 
rise in price from $1 to $1.50 leads to a rise in the quantity supplied from 10 bil-
lion to 11.2 billion pounds of cotton. But the quantity supplied can also rise when 
the price is unchanged if there is an increase in supply—a rightward shift of the 
supply curve. This is shown by the rightward shift of the supply curve from S1 to 
S2. Holding the price constant at $1, the quantity supplied rises from 10 billion 
pounds at point A on S1 to 12 billion pounds at point C on S2.
Movement Along the Supply Curve versus Shift of the Supply Curve 
3-8
The increase in quantity supplied when 
going from point A to point B reflects a 
movement along the supply curve: it is the 
result of a rise in the price of the good. 
The increase in quantity supplied when 
going from point A to point C reflects a 
shift of the supply curve: it is the result of 
an increase in the quantity supplied at any 
given price.

Understanding Shifts of the Supply Curve
Figure 3-9 illustrates the two basic ways in which supply curves can shift. When 
economists talk about an “increase in supply,” they mean a rightward shift of the 
supply curve: at any given price, producers supply a larger quantity of the good 
than before. This is shown in Figure 3-9 by the rightward shift of the original sup-
ply curve S1 to S2. And when economists talk about a “decrease in supply,” they 
mean a leftward shift of the supply curve: at any given price, producers supply a 
smaller quantity of the good than before. This is represented by the leftward shift 
of S1 to S3.
Economists believe that shifts of the supply curve for a good or service are 
mainly the result of five factors (though, as in the case of demand, there are other 
possible causes):
 • Changes in input prices
 • Changes in the prices of related goods or services
 • Changes in technology
 • Changes in expectations
 • Changes in the number of producers
A movement along the supply 
curve is a change in the quantity 
supplied of a good arising from a 
change in the good’s price.

Changes in Input Prices To produce output, you need inputs. For example, 
to make vanilla ice cream, you need vanilla beans, cream, sugar, and so on. An 
input is any good or service that is used to produce another good or service. 
Inputs, like outputs, have prices. And an increase in the price of an input makes 
the production of the final good more costly for those who produce and sell it. So 
producers are less willing to supply the final good at any given price, and the sup-
ply curve shifts to the left. For example, fuel is a major cost for airlines. When oil 
prices surged in 2007–2008, airlines began cutting back on their flight schedules 
and some went out of business. Similarly, a fall in the price of an input makes the 
production of the final good less costly for sellers. They are more willing to supply 
the good at any given price, and the supply curve shifts to the right.
Changes in the Prices of Related Goods or Services A single producer 
often produces a mix of goods rather than a single product. For example, an oil 
refinery produces gasoline from crude oil, but it also produces heating oil and 
other products from the same raw material. When a producer sells several prod-
ucts, the quantity of any one good it is willing to supply at any given price depends 
on the prices of its other co-produced goods.
This effect can run in either direction. An oil refiner will supply less gasoline at 
any given price when the price of heating oil rises, shifting the supply curve for gaso-
line to the left. But it will supply more gasoline at any given price when the price of 
heating oil falls, shifting the supply curve for gasoline to the right. This means that 
gasoline and other co-produced oil products are substitutes in production for refiners.
In contrast, due to the nature of the production process, other goods can be 
complements in production. For example, producers of crude oil—oil-well drillers—
often find that oil wells also produce natural gas as a by-product of oil extraction. 
The higher the price at which a driller can sell its natural gas, the more oil wells it 
will drill and the more oil it will supply at any given price for oil. As a result, natural 
gas is a complement in production for crude oil.
Changes in Technology When economists talk about “technology,” they don’t 
necessarily mean high technology—they mean all the methods people can use 
to turn inputs into useful goods and services. In that sense, the whole complex 
sequence of activities that turn cotton from Pakistan into the pair of jeans hang-
ing in your closet is technology.
Shifts of the Supply Curve
3-9
Any event that increases supply shifts the 
supply curve to the right, reflecting a rise 
in the quantity supplied at any given price. 
Any event that decreases supply shifts the 
supply curve to the left, reflecting a fall in 
the quantity supplied at any given price.

Improvements in technology enable producers to spend less on inputs yet still 
produce the same output. When a better technology becomes available, reducing 
the cost of production, supply increases, and the supply curve shifts to the right. 
As we have already mentioned, improved technology enabled farmers to more 
than quadruple cotton output per acre planted over the past several decades. 
Improved technology is the main reason that, until recently, cotton remained 
relatively cheap even as worldwide demand grew.
Changes in Expectations Just as changes in expectations can shift the 
demand curve, they can also shift the supply curve. When suppliers have some 
choice about when they put their good up for sale, changes in the expected future 
price of the good can lead a supplier to supply less or more of the good today.
For example, consider the fact that gasoline and other oil products are often 
stored for significant periods of time at oil refineries before being sold to consum-
ers. In fact, storage is normally part of producers’ business strategy. Knowing that 
the demand for gasoline peaks in the summer, oil refiners normally store some of 
their gasoline produced during the spring for summer sale. Similarly, knowing that 
the demand for heating oil peaks in the winter, they normally store some of their 
heating oil produced during the fall for winter sale. In each case, there’s a decision 
to be made between selling the product now versus storing it for later sale. Which 
choice a producer makes depends on a comparison of the current price versus the 
expected future price. This example illustrates how changes in expectations can 
alter supply: An increase in the anticipated future price of a good or service reduces 
supply today, a leftward shift of the supply curve. But a fall in the anticipated future 
price increases supply today, a rightward shift of the supply curve.
Changes in the Number of Producers Just as changes in the number 
of consumers affect the demand curve, changes in the number of produc-
ers affect the supply curve. Let’s examine the individual supply curve, 
by looking at panel (a) in Figure 3-10. The individual supply curve shows

price, is shown in panel (c). The market supply curve is 
the horizontal sum of the individual supply curves of all 
producers.

quantity supplied and price for an 
individual producer.

the relationship between quantity supplied and price for an individual 
producer. For example, suppose that Mr. Silva is a Brazilian cotton farmer 
and that panel (a) of Figure 3-10 shows how many pounds of cotton he will 
supply per year at any given price. Then SSilva is his individual supply curve.
The market supply curve shows how the combined total quantity supplied 
by all individual producers in the market depends on the market price of that 
good. Just as the market demand curve is the horizontal sum of the individual 
demand curves of all consumers, the market supply curve is the horizontal sum 
of the individual supply curves of all producers. Assume for a moment that 
there are only two producers of cotton, Mr. Silva and Mr. Liu, a Chinese cotton 
farmer. Mr. Liu’s individual supply curve is shown in panel (b). Panel (c) shows 
the market supply curve. At any given price, the quantity supplied to the market 
is the sum of the quantities supplied by Mr. Silva and Mr. Liu. For example, at 
a price of $2 per pound, Mr. Silva supplies 3,000 pounds of cotton per year and 
Mr. Liu supplies 2,000 pounds per year, making the quantity supplied to the 
market 5,000 pounds.
Clearly, the quantity supplied to the market at any given price is larger 
with Mr. Liu present than it would be if Mr. Silva were the only supplier. 
The quantity supplied at a given price would be even larger if we added 
a third producer, then a fourth, and so on. So an increase in the number 
of producers leads to an increase in supply and a rightward shift of the sup-
ply curve.
For a review of the factors that shift supply, see Table 3-2.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
ONLY CREATURES SMALL AND PAMPERED
D
uring the 1970s, British television featured a popular show titled All 
Creatures Great and Small. It chronicled the real life of James Herriot, a 
country veterinarian who tended to cows, pigs, sheep, horses, and the occa-
sional house pet, often under arduous conditions, in rural England during the 
1930s. The show made it clear that in those days the local vet was a critical 
member of farming communities, saving valuable farm animals and helping 
farmers survive financially. And it was also clear that Mr. Herriot considered 
his life’s work well spent.
But that was then and this is now. According to a recent article in 
the New York Times, the United States has experienced a severe decline in 
the number of farm veterinarians over the past two decades. The source of 
the problem is competition. As the number of household 
pets has increased and the incomes of pet owners have 
grown, the demand for pet veterinarians has increased 
sharply. As a result, vets are being drawn away from the 
business of caring for farm animals into the more lucra-
tive business of caring for pets. As one vet stated, she 
began her career caring for farm animals but changed 
her mind after “doing a C-section on a cow and it’s 50 
bucks. Do a C-section on a Chihuahua and you get $300. 
It’s the money. I hate to say that.”
How can we translate this into supply and demand 
curves? Farm veterinary services and pet veterinary ser-
vices are like gasoline and fuel oil: they’re related goods 
that are substitutes in production. A veterinarian typically 
specializes in one type of practice or the other, and that 
decision often depends on the going price for the service. 
America’s growing pet population, combined with the 
Higher spending on pets means fewer veterinarians are available to 
tend to farm animals.

increased willingness of doting owners to spend on their companions’ care, 
has driven up the price of pet veterinary services. As a result, fewer and fewer 
veterinarians have gone into farm animal practice. So the supply curve of farm 
veterinarians has shifted leftward—fewer farm veterinarians are offering their 
services at any given price.

In the end, farmers understand that it is all a matter of dollars and cents; 
they get fewer veterinarians because they are unwilling to pay more. As one 
farmer, who had recently lost an expensive cow due to the unavailability of a 
veterinarian, stated, “The fact that there’s nothing you can do, you accept it 
as a business expense now. You didn’t used to. If you have livestock, sooner 
or later you’re going to have deadstock.” (Although we should note that this 
farmer could have chosen to pay more for a vet who would have then saved 
his cow.)

Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium
W
e have now covered the first three key elements in the supply and 
demand model: the demand curve, the supply curve, and the set of 
factors that shift each curve. The next step is to put these elements 
together to show how they can be used to predict the actual price at which 
the good is bought and sold, as well as the actual quantity transacted.
What determines the price at which a good or service is bought and sold? 
What determines the quantity transacted of the good or service? In Chapter 
1 we learned the general principle that markets move toward equilibrium, 
a situation in which no individual would be better off taking a different 
action. In the case of a competitive market, we can be more specific: a 
competitive market is in equilibrium when the price has moved to a level 
 Quick Review
• The supply schedule shows how 
the quantity supplied depends on 
the price. The supply curve illus-
trates this relationship.
• Supply curves are normally upward 
sloping: at a higher price, produc-
ers are willing to supply more of a 
good or service.
• A change in price results in a move-
ment along the supply curve and a 
change in the quantity supplied.
• Increases or decreases in supply 
lead to shifts of the supply curve. 
An increase in supply is a rightward 
shift: the quantity supplied rises for 
any given price. A decrease in supply 
is a leftward shift: the quantity sup-
plied falls for any given price.
• The five main factors that can shift the 
supply curve are changes in (1) input 
prices, (2) prices of related goods or 
services, (3) technology, (4) expecta-
tions, and (5) number of producers.
• The market supply curve is the hori-
zontal sum of the individual supply 
curves of all producers in the market.
PITFALLS
BOUGHT AND SOLD?
We have been talking about the price 
at which a good or service is bought 
and sold, as if the two were the same. 
But shouldn’t we make a distinction 
between the price received by sell-
ers and the price paid by buyers? In 
principle, yes; but it is helpful at this 
point to sacrifice a bit of realism in 
the interest of simplicity—by assum-
ing away the difference between the 
prices received by sellers and those 
paid by buyers.
In reality, there is often a middleman—
someone who brings buyers and sell-
ers together. The middleman buys from 
suppliers, then sells to consumers at a 
markup—for example, cotton brokers 
who buy from cotton farmers and sell 
to textile mills—which turn the cot-
ton into clothing for you and me. The 
farmers generally receive less than the 
mills, who eventually buy their bales 
of cotton, pay. No mystery there: that 
difference is how cotton brokers or 
any other middlemen make a living. In 
many markets, however, the difference 
between the buying and selling price is 
quite small. So it’s not a bad approxi-
mation to think of the price paid by 
buyers as being the same as the price 
received by sellers. And that is what we 
assume in this chapter.

84    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
at which the quantity of a good demanded equals the quantity of that good 
supplied. At that price, no individual seller could make herself better off 
by offering to sell either more or less of the good and no individual buyer 
could make himself better off by offering to buy more or less of the good. 
In other words, at the market equilibrium, price has moved to a level that 
exactly matches the quantity demanded by consumers to the quantity sup-
plied by sellers.
The price that matches the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded is 
the equilibrium price; the quantity bought and sold at that price is the equi-
librium quantity. The equilibrium price is also known as the market-clearing 
price: it is the price that “clears the market” by ensuring that every buyer willing 
to pay that price finds a seller willing to sell at that price, and vice versa. So how 
do we find the equilibrium price and quantity?
Finding the Equilibrium Price and Quantity
The easiest way to determine the equilibrium price and quantity in a market is 
by putting the supply curve and the demand curve on the same diagram. Since 
the supply curve shows the quantity supplied at any given price and the demand 
curve shows the quantity demanded at any given price, the price at which the two 
curves cross is the equilibrium price: the price at which quantity supplied equals 
quantity demanded.
Figure 3-11 combines the demand curve from Figure 3-1 and the supply 
curve from Figure 3-6. They intersect at point E, which is the equilibrium of 
this market; $1 is the equilibrium price and 10 billion pounds is the equilib-
rium quantity.
Let’s confirm that point E fits our definition of equilibrium. At a price of 
$1 per pound, cotton farmers are willing to sell 10 billion pounds a year and 
cotton consumers want to buy 10 billion pounds a year. So at the price of $1 
A competitive market is in equilibrium 
when price has moved to a level 
at which the quantity of a good 
or service demanded equals the 
quantity of that good or service 
supplied. The price at which this 
takes place is the equilibrium 
price, also referred to as the 
market-clearing price. The 
quantity of the good or service 
bought and sold at that price is the 
equilibrium quantity.
Market Equilibrium
3-11
Market equilibrium occurs at point 
E, where the supply curve and the 
demand curve intersect. In equilibrium, 
the quantity demanded is equal to the 
quantity supplied. In this market, the 
equilibrium price is $1 per pound and 
the equilibrium quantity is 10 billion 
pounds per year.

a pound, the quantity of cotton supplied equals the quantity demanded. 
Notice that at any other price the market would not clear: every will-
ing buyer would not be able to find a willing seller, or vice versa. More 
specifically, if the price were more than $1, the quantity supplied would 
exceed the quantity demanded; if the price were less than $1, the quantity 
demanded would exceed the quantity supplied.
The model of supply and demand, then, predicts that given the 
demand and supply curves shown in Figure 3-11, 10 billion pounds of 
cotton would change hands at a price of $1 per pound. But how can we 
be sure that the market will arrive at the equilibrium price? We begin by 
answering three simple questions:
 1. Why do all sales and purchases in a market take place at the same price?
 2. Why does the market price fall if it is above the equilibrium price?
 3. Why does the market price rise if it is below the equilibrium price?
Why Do All Sales and Purchases in a Market Take Place 
at the Same Price?
There are some markets where the same good can sell for many different 
prices, depending on who is selling or who is buying. For example, have you 
ever bought a souvenir in a “tourist trap” and then seen the same item on 
sale somewhere else (perhaps even in the shop next door) for a lower price? 
Because tourists don’t know which shops offer the best deals and don’t have 
time for comparison shopping, sellers in tourist areas can charge different 
prices for the same good.
But in any market where the buyers and sellers have both been around for 
some time, sales and purchases tend to converge at a generally uniform price, 
so we can safely talk about the market price. It’s easy to see why. Suppose a 
seller offered a potential buyer a price noticeably above what the buyer knew 
other people to be paying. The buyer would clearly be better off shopping 
elsewhere—unless the seller were prepared to offer a better deal. Conversely, 
a seller would not be willing to sell for significantly less than the amount he 
knew most buyers were paying; he would be better off waiting to get a more 
reasonable customer. So in any well-established, ongoing market, all sellers 
receive and all buyers pay approximately the same price. This is what we call 
the market price.
Why Does the Market Price Fall if It Is Above the 
Equilibrium Price? 
Suppose the supply and demand curves are as shown in Figure 3-11 but the mar-
ket price is above the equilibrium level of $1—say, $1.50. This situation is illus-
trated in Figure 3-12. Why can’t the price stay there?
As the figure shows, at a price of $1.50 there would be more pounds of cotton 
available than consumers wanted to buy: 11.2 billion pounds versus 8.1 billion 
pounds. The difference of 3.1 billion pounds is the surplus—also known as the 
excess supply—of cotton at $1.50.
This surplus means that some cotton farmers are frustrated: at the current 
price, they cannot find consumers who want to buy their cotton. The surplus 
offers an incentive for those frustrated would-be sellers to offer a lower price 
in order to poach business from other producers and entice more consumers 
to buy. The result of this price cutting will be to push the prevailing price 
Dan Piraro, 1996 Dist. by Universal Press Syndicate
There is a surplus of a good or 
service when the quantity supplied 
exceeds the quantity demanded. 
Surpluses occur when the price is 
above its equilibrium level.

86    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
down until it reaches the equilibrium price. So the price of a good will fall 
whenever there is a surplus—that is, whenever the market price is above its 
equilibrium level.
Why Does the Market Price Rise if It Is Below the 
Equilibrium Price?
Now suppose the price is below its equilibrium level—say, at $0.75 per pound, as 
shown in Figure 3-13. In this case, the quantity demanded, 11.5 billion pounds, 
exceeds the quantity supplied, 9.1 billion pounds, implying that there are would-
be buyers who cannot find cotton: there is a shortage, also known as an excess 
demand, of 2.4 billion pounds.
When there is a shortage, there are frustrated would-be buyers—people 
who want to purchase cotton but cannot find willing sellers at the current 
price. In this situation, either buyers will offer more than the prevailing price 
or sellers will realize that they can charge higher prices. Either way, the result 
is to drive up the prevailing price. This bidding up of prices happens whenever 
there are shortages—and there will be shortages whenever the price is below 
its equilibrium level. So the market price will always rise if it is below the 
equilibrium level.
Using Equilibrium to Describe Markets
We have now seen that a market tends to have a single price, the equilibrium 
price. If the market price is above the equilibrium level, the ensuing surplus 
leads buyers and sellers to take actions that lower the price. And if the mar-
ket price is below the equilibrium level, the ensuing shortage leads buyers 
and sellers to take actions that raise the price. So the market price always 
moves toward the equilibrium price, the price at which there is neither sur-
plus nor shortage.
Price Above Its Equilibrium Level Creates a Surplus
3-12
The market price of $1.50 is above the 
equilibrium price of $1. This creates a 
surplus: at a price of $1.50, producers 
would like to sell 11.2 billion pounds 
but consumers want to buy only 8.1 
billion pounds, so there is a surplus 
of 3.1 billion pounds. This surplus will 
push the price down until it reaches 
the equilibrium price of $1.

T
he market equilibrium, so the theory goes, is pretty egalitarian because the 
equilibrium price applies to everyone. That is, all buyers pay the same price—
the equilibrium price—and all sellers receive that same price. But is this realistic?
The market for concert tickets is an example that seems to contradict the 
theory—there’s one price at the box office, and there’s another price (typically 
much higher) for the same event on Internet sites where people 
who already have tickets resell them, such as StubHub.com or 
eBay. For example, compare the box office price for a recent 
Drake concert in Miami, Florida, to the StubHub.com price for 
seats in the same location: $88.50 versus $155.
Puzzling as this may seem, there is no contradiction once we 
take opportunity costs and tastes into account. For major events, 
buying tickets from the box office means waiting in very long 
lines. Ticket buyers who use Internet resellers have decided that 
the opportunity cost of their time is too high to spend waiting in 
line. And tickets for major events being sold at face value by online 
box offices often sell out within minutes. In this case, some people 
who want to go to the concert badly but have missed out on the 
opportunity to buy cheaper tickets from the online box office are 
willing to pay the higher Internet reseller price.
Not only that—perusing the StubHub.com website, you can see 
that markets really do move to equilibrium. You’ll notice that the 
prices quoted by different sellers for seats close to one another are 
also very close: $184.99 versus $185 for seats on the main floor of 
the Drake concert. As the competitive market model predicts, units 
of the same good end up selling for the same price. And prices

The market price of $0.75 is below

buy 11.5 billion pounds, but only 9.1

a shortage of 2.4 billion pounds. This 
shortage will push the price up until it 
reaches the equilibrium price of $1.

Times, tickets on StubHub.com can sell for less than the face value for events with 
little appeal, but prices can skyrocket for events that are in high demand. (The 
article quotes a price of $3,530 for a Madonna concert.) Even StubHub.com’s chief 
executive says his site is “the embodiment of supply-and-demand economics.”
So the theory of competitive markets isn’t just speculation. If you want to

1. In the following three situations, the market is initially in equilibrium. Explain the changes 
in either supply or demand that result from each event. After each event described 
below, does a surplus or shortage exist at the original equilibrium price? What will hap-
pen to the equilibrium price as a result?
a.  2009 was a very good year for California wine-grape growers, who produced a bum-
per crop.
b.  After a hurricane, Florida hoteliers often find that many people cancel their upcoming 
vacations, leaving them with empty hotel rooms.
c.  After a heavy snowfall, many people want to buy second-hand snowblowers at the 
local tool shop.

Changes in Supply and Demand
T
he 2010 floods in Pakistan came as a surprise, but the subsequent increase 
in the price of cotton was no surprise at all. Suddenly there was a fall in 
supply: the quantity of cotton available at any given price fell. Predictably, 
a fall in supply raises the equilibrium price.
The flooding in Pakistan is an example of an event that shifted the supply 
curve for a good without having much effect on the demand curve. There are 
many such events. There are also events that shift the demand curve without 
shifting the supply curve. For example, a medical report that chocolate is good 
for you increases the demand for chocolate but does not affect the supply. Events 
often shift either the supply curve or the demand curve, but not both; it is there-
fore useful to ask what happens in each case.
We have seen that when a curve shifts, the equilibrium price and quantity 
change. We will now concentrate on exactly how the shift of a curve alters the 
equilibrium price and quantity.
What Happens When the Demand Curve Shifts
Cotton and polyester are substitutes: if the price of polyester rises, the demand 
for cotton will increase, and if the price of polyester falls, the demand for cotton 
will decrease. But how does the price of polyester affect the market equilibrium 
for cotton?
Figure 3-14 shows the effect of a rise in the price of polyester on the market for 
cotton. The rise in the price of polyester increases the demand for cotton. Point E1 
shows the equilibrium corresponding to the original demand curve, with P1 the 
equilibrium price and Q1 the equilibrium quantity bought and sold.
An increase in demand is indicated by a rightward shift of the demand 
curve from D1 to D2. At the original market price P1, this market is no longer 
in equilibrium: a shortage occurs because the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied. So the price of cotton rises and generates an increase 
in the quantity supplied, an upward movement along the supply curve. A new 
• Price in a competitive market moves 
to the equilibrium price, or market-
clearing price, where the quantity 
supplied is equal to the quantity 
demanded. This quantity is the 
equilibrium quantity.
• All sales and purchases in a market 
take place at the same price. If the 
price is above its equilibrium level, 
there is a surplus that drives the 
price down to the equilibrium level. 
If the price is below its equilibrium 
level, there is a shortage that 
drives the price up to the equilib-
rium level.

equilibrium is established at point E2, with a higher equilibrium price, P2, and 
higher equilibrium quantity, Q2. This sequence of events reflects a general 
principle: When demand for a good or service increases, the equilibrium price 
and the equilibrium quantity of the good or service both rise.
What would happen in the reverse case, a fall in the price of polyester? A fall 
in the price of polyester reduces the demand for cotton, shifting the demand curve 
to the left. At the original price, a surplus occurs as quantity supplied exceeds 
quantity demanded. The price falls and leads to a decrease in the quantity sup-
plied, resulting in a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity. This 
illustrates another general principle: When demand for a good or service decreases, 
the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of the good or service both fall.
To summarize how a market responds to a change in demand: An increase in 
demand leads to a rise in both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity. 
A decrease in demand leads to a fall in both the equilibrium price and the equilib-
rium quantity.
What Happens When the Supply Curve Shifts
In the real world, it is a bit easier to predict changes in supply than changes in 
demand. Physical factors that affect supply, like weather or the availability of 
inputs, are easier to get a handle on than the fickle tastes that affect demand. 
Still, with supply as with demand, what we can best predict are the effects of 
shifts of the supply curve.
As we mentioned in this chapter’s opening story, devastating floods in 
Pakistan sharply reduced the supply of cotton in 2010. Figure 3-15 shows 
how this shift affected the market equilibrium. The original equilibrium is at 
E1, the point of intersection of the original supply curve, S1, and the demand 
curve, with an equilibrium price P1 and equilibrium quantity Q1. As a result 
of the bad weather, supply falls and S1 shifts leftward to S2. At the original 
price P1, a shortage of cotton now exists and the market is no longer in equi-
librium. The shortage causes a rise in price and a fall in quantity demanded, 
an upward movement along the demand curve. The new equilibrium is at E2,

The original equilibrium in the market for 
cotton is at E1, at the intersection of the 
supply curve and the original demand 
curve, D1. A rise in the price of polyester, 
a substitute, shifts the demand curve 
rightward to D2. A shortage exists at the 
original price, P1, causing both the price 
and quantity supplied to rise, a movement 
along the supply curve. A new equilibrium 
is reached at E2, with a higher equilib-
rium price, P2, and a higher equilibrium 
quantity, Q2. When demand for a good or 
service increases, the equilibrium price 
and the equilibrium quantity of the good or 
service both rise.

with an equilibrium price P2 and an equilibrium quantity Q2. In the 
new equilibrium, E2, the price is higher and the equilibrium quan-
tity lower than before. This can be stated as a general principle: 
When supply of a good or service decreases, the equilibrium price of 
the good or service rises and the equilibrium quantity of the good or 
service falls.
What happens to the market when supply increases? An increase 
in supply leads to a rightward shift of the supply curve. At the original 
price, a surplus now exists; as a result, the equilibrium price falls and 
the quantity demanded rises. This describes what happened to the mar-
ket for cotton as new technology increased cotton yields. We can formu-
late a general principle: When supply of a good or service increases, the 
equilibrium price of the good or service falls and the equilibrium quantity 
of the good or service rises.
To summarize how a market responds to a change in supply: An 
increase in supply leads to a fall in the equilibrium price and a rise in the 
equilibrium quantity. A decrease in supply leads to a rise in the equilibrium price 
and a fall in the equilibrium quantity.
Simultaneous Shifts of Supply and Demand Curves
Finally, it sometimes happens that events shift both the demand and supply 
curves at the same time. This is not unusual; in real life, supply curves and 
demand curves for many goods and services shift quite often because the eco-
nomic environment continually changes. Figure 3-16 illustrates two examples of 
simultaneous shifts. In both panels there is an increase in demand—that is, a 
rightward shift of the demand curve, from D1 to D2—say, for example, represent-
ing an increase in the demand for cotton due to changing tastes. Notice that the 
rightward shift in panel (a) is larger than the one in panel (b): we can suppose 
that panel (a) represents a year in which many more people than usual choose to 
buy jeans and cotton T-shirts and panel (b) represents a normal year. Both panels 
also show a decrease in supply—that is, a leftward shift of the supply curve from

PITFALLS
WHICH CURVE IS IT, ANYWAY?
When the price of some good or service 
changes, in general, we can say that this 
reflects a change in either supply or demand. 
But it is easy to get confused about which 
one. A helpful clue is the direction of change 
in the quantity. If the quantity sold changes in 
the same direction as the price—for example, 
if both the price and the quantity rise—this 
suggests that the demand curve has shifted. 
If the price and the quantity move in opposite 
directions, the likely cause is a shift of the 
supply curve.

S1 to S2. Also notice that the leftward shift in panel (b) is relatively larger than the 
one in panel (a): we can suppose that panel (b) represents the effect of particularly 
bad weather in Pakistan and panel (a) represents the effect of a much less severe 
weather event.
In both cases, the equilibrium price rises from P1 to P2, as the equilibrium 
moves from E1 to E2. But what happens to the equilibrium quantity, the quantity 
of cotton bought and sold? In panel (a) the increase in demand is large relative 
to the decrease in supply, and the equilibrium quantity rises as a result. In panel 
(b), the decrease in supply is large relative to the increase in demand, and the 
equilibrium quantity falls as a result. That is, when demand increases and supply 
decreases, the actual quantity bought and sold can go either way, depending on 
how much the demand and supply curves have shifted.
In general, when supply and demand shift in opposite directions, we can’t 
predict what the ultimate effect will be on the quantity bought and sold. What we 
can say is that a curve that shifts a disproportionately greater distance than the 
other curve will have a disproportionately greater effect on the quantity bought 
and sold. That said, we can make the following prediction about the outcome 
when the supply and demand curves shift in opposite directions:
 • When demand increases and supply decreases, the equilibrium price rises but 
the change in the equilibrium quantity is ambiguous.
 • When demand decreases and supply increases, the equilibrium price falls but 
the change in the equilibrium quantity is ambiguous.
But suppose that the demand and supply curves shift in the same direction.  
Before 2010, this was the case in the global market for cotton, where both supply

In panel (a) there is a simultaneous rightward shift 
of the demand curve and leftward shift of the supply 
curve. Here the increase in demand is relatively larger 
than the decrease in supply, so the equilibrium price 
and equilibrium quantity both rise. In panel (b) there 
is also a simultaneous rightward shift of the demand 
curve and leftward shift of the supply curve. Here the 
decrease in supply is relatively larger than the increase 
in demand, so the equilibrium price rises and the equi-
librium quantity falls.

and demand had increased over the past decade. Can we safely make any predic-
tions about the changes in price and quantity? In this situation, the change in 
quantity bought and sold can be predicted, but the change in price is ambiguous. 
The two possible outcomes when the supply and demand curves shift in the same 
direction (which you should check for yourself) are as follows:
 • When both demand and supply increase, the equilibrium quantity rises but 
the change in equilibrium price is ambiguous.
 • When both demand and supply decrease, the equilibrium quantity falls but 
the change in equilibrium price is ambiguous.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE RICE RUN OF 2008
I
n April 2008, the price of rice exported from Thailand—a global benchmark 
for the price of rice traded in international markets—reached $950 per ton, 
up from $360 per ton at the beginning of 2008. Within hours, prices for rice 
at major rice-trading exchanges around the world were breaking record levels. 
The factors that lay behind the surge in rice prices were both demand-related 
and supply-related: growing incomes in China and India, traditionally large 
You probably don’t spend much time wor-
rying about the trials and tribulations of 
fashion models. Most of them don’t lead 
glamorous lives; in fact, except for a lucky 
few, life as a fashion model today can be 
very trying and not very lucrative. And it’s 
all because of supply and demand.
Consider the case of Bianca Gomez, 
a willowy 18-year-old from Los Angeles, 
with green eyes, honey-colored hair, and 
flawless skin, whose experience was 
detailed in a Wall Street Journal article. 
Bianca began modeling while still in high 
school, earning about $30,000 in mod-
eling fees during her senior year. Having 
attracted the interest of some top 
designers in New York, she moved there 
after graduation, hoping to land jobs 
in leading fashion houses and photo-
shoots for leading fashion magazines.
But once in New York, Bianca entered 
the global market for fashion models. 
And it wasn’t very pretty. Due to the 
ease of transmitting photos over the 
Internet and the relatively low cost of 
international travel, top fashion cen-
ters such as New York and Milan, Italy, 
are now deluged with beautiful young 
women from all over the world, eagerly 
trying to make it as models. Although 
Russians, other Eastern Europeans, 
and Brazilians are particularly numer-
ous, some hail from places such as 
Kazakhstan and Mozambique. As one 
designer said, “There are so many mod-
els now. . . . There are just thousands 
every year.”
Returning to our (less glamorous) 
economic model of supply and demand, 
the influx of aspiring fashion models from 
around the world can be represented 
by a rightward shift of the supply curve 
in the market for fashion models, which 
would by itself tend to lower the price 
paid to models. And that wasn’t the only 
change in the market. Unfortunately for 
Bianca and others like her, the tastes 
of many of those who hire models have 
changed as well. Over the past few 
years, fashion magazines have come to 
prefer using celebrities such as Angelina 
Jolie on their pages rather than anony-
mous models, believing that their read-
ers connect better with a familiar face. 
This amounts to a leftward shift of the 
demand curve for models—again reduc-
ing the equilibrium price paid to them.
This was borne out in Bianca’s 
experiences. After paying her rent, 
her transportation, all her modeling 
expenses, and 20% of her earnings to 
her modeling agency (which markets 
her to prospective clients and books her 
jobs), Bianca found that she was barely 
breaking even. Sometimes she even had 
to dip into savings from her high school 
years. To save money, she ate macaroni 
and hot dogs; she traveled to auditions, 
often four or five in one day, by subway. 
As the Wall Street Journal reported, 
Bianca was seriously considering quit-
ting modeling altogether.

consumers of rice; drought in Australia; and pest infestation in Vietnam. But 
it was hoarding by farmers, panic buying by consumers, and an export ban 
by India, one of the largest exporters of rice, that explained the breathtaking 
speed of the rise in price.
In much of Asia, governments are major buyers of rice. They buy rice from 
their rice farmers, who are paid a government-set price, and then sell it to the 
poor at subsidized prices (prices lower than the market equilibrium price). In 
the past, the government-set price was better than anything farmers could get 
in the private market.
Now, even farmers in rural areas of Asia have access to the Internet and 
can see the price quotes on global rice exchanges. And as rice prices rose in 
response to changes in demand and supply, farmers grew dissatisfied with 
the government price and instead hoarded their rice in the belief that they 
would eventually get higher prices. This was a self-fulfilling belief, as the 
hoarding shifted the supply curve leftward and raised the price of rice even 
further. 
At the same time, India, one of the largest growers of rice, banned Indian 
exports of rice in order to protect its domestic consumers, causing yet 
another leftward shift of the supply curve and pushing the price of rice even 
higher.
As shown in Figure 3-17, the effects even spilled over to the United 
States, which had not suffered any fall in its rice production. American 
rice consumers grew alarmed when large retailers limited some bulk 
rice purchases by consumers in response to the turmoil in the global rice 
market.
Fearful of paying even higher prices in the future, panic buying set in. 
As one woman who was in the process of buying 30 pounds of rice said, 
“We don’t even eat that much rice. But I read about it in the newspaper and 
decided to buy some.” In San Francisco, some Asian markets reported runs 
on rice. And, predictably, this led to even higher prices as panic buying 
shifted the demand curve rightward, further feeding the buying frenzy. As 
one market owner said, “People are afraid. We tell them, ‘There’s no shortage 
yet’ but it was crazy in here.”

Competitive Markets—And Others
E
arly in this chapter, we defined a competitive market and explained that the 
supply and demand framework is a model of competitive markets. But we 
took a rain check on the question of why it matters whether or not a market 
is competitive. Now that we’ve seen how the supply and demand model works, we 
can offer some explanation.
To understand why competitive markets are different from other markets, 
compare the problems facing two individuals: a wheat farmer who must decide 
whether to grow more wheat and the president of a giant aluminum company—
say, Alcoa—who must decide whether to produce more aluminum.
For the wheat farmer, the question is simply whether the extra wheat can be 
sold at a price high enough to justify the extra production cost. The farmer need 
not worry about whether producing more wheat will affect the price of the wheat 
he or she was already planning to grow. That’s because the wheat market is com-
petitive. There are thousands of wheat farmers, and no one farmer’s decision will 
have any impact on the market price.
For the Alcoa executive, things are not that simple because the aluminum mar-
ket is not competitive. There are only a few big producers, including Alcoa, and each 
of them is well aware that its actions do have a noticeable impact on the market 
price. This adds a whole new level of complexity to the decisions producers have to 
make. Alcoa can’t decide whether or not to produce more aluminum just by asking 
whether the additional product will sell for more than it costs to make. The com-
pany also has to ask whether producing more aluminum will drive down the mar-
ket price and reduce its profit, its net gain from producing and selling its output.
When a market is competitive, individuals can base decisions on less compli-
cated analyses than those used in a noncompetitive market. This in turn means 
that it’s easier for economists to build a model of a competitive market than of a 
noncompetitive market.
Don’t take this to mean that economic analysis has nothing to say about non-
competitive markets. On the contrary, economists can offer some very important 
insights into how other kinds of markets work. But those insights require other 
models, which we will learn about later in this text.
• Changes in the equilibrium price 
and quantity in a market result 
from shifts of the supply curve, the 
demand curve, or both.
• An increase in demand increases both 
the equilibrium price and the equilib-
rium quantity. A decrease in demand 
decreases both the equilibrium price 
and the equilibrium quantity.
• An increase in supply drives the 
equilibrium price down but increases 
the equilibrium quantity. A decrease 
in supply raises the equilibrium price 
but reduces the equilibrium quantity.
• Often fluctuations in markets 
involve shifts of both the supply and 
demand curves. When they shift in 
the same direction, the change in 
equilibrium quantity is predictable 
but the change in equilibrium price 
is not. When they shift in opposite 
directions, the change in equilibrium 
price is predictable but the change 
in equilibrium quantity is not. When 
there are simultaneous shifts of 
the demand and supply curves, the 
curve that shifts the greater distance 
has a greater effect on the change in 
equilibrium price and quantity.
 Quick Review

95
Around the world, commodities are bought and sold on “exchanges,” markets 
organized in a specific location, where buyers and sellers meet to trade. But it 
wasn’t always like this.
The first modern commodity exchange was the Chicago Board of Trade, 
founded in 1848. At the time, the United States was already a major wheat pro-
ducer. And St. Louis, not Chicago, was the leading city of the American West and 
the dominant location for wheat trading. But the St. Louis wheat market suffered 
from a major flaw: there was no central marketplace, no specific location where 
everyone met to buy and sell wheat. Instead, sellers would sell their grain from 
various warehouses or from stacked sacks of grain on the river levee. Buyers 
would wander around town, looking for the best price. 
In Chicago, however, sellers had a better idea. The Chicago Board of Trade, 
an association of the city’s leading grain dealers, created a much more efficient 
method for trading wheat. There, traders gathered in one place—the “pit”—where 
they called out offers to sell and accepted offers to buy. The Board guaranteed 
that these contracts would be fulfilled, removing the need for the wheat to be 
physically in place when a trade was agreed upon.
This system meant that buyers could very quickly find sellers and vice-versa, 
reducing the cost of doing business. It also ensured that everyone could see the 
latest price, leading the price to rise or fall quickly in response to market condi-
tions. For example, news of bad weather in a wheat-growing area hundreds of 
miles away would send the price in the Chicago pit soaring in a matter of minutes. 
The Chicago Board of Trade went on to become the world’s most important 
trading center for wheat and many other agricultural commodities, a distinction 
it retains to this day. And the Board’s rise helped the rise of Chicago, too. The city, 
as Carl Sandburg put it in his famous poem, “Chicago,” became: 
Hog Butcher for the World,
Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
Player with Railroads and the Nation’s Freight Handler;
Stormy, husky, brawling, 
City of the Big Shoulders
By 1890, Chicago had more than a million people, second only to New York and 
far out-pacing St. Louis. Making a better market, it turned out, was very good 
business indeed.

SUMMARY
 1. The supply and demand model illustrates how 
a competitive market, one with many buyers 
and sellers, none of whom can influence the market 
price, works.
 2. The demand schedule shows the quantity 
demanded at each price and is represented graphi-
cally by a demand curve. The law of demand says 
that demand curves slope downward; that is, a higher 
price for a good or service leads people to demand a 
smaller quantity, other things equal.
 3. A movement along the demand curve occurs 
when a price change leads to a change in the quantity 
demanded. When economists talk of increasing or 
decreasing demand, they mean shifts of the demand 
curve—a change in the quantity demanded at any 
given price. An increase in demand causes a right-
ward shift of the demand curve. A decrease in demand 
causes a leftward shift.
 4. There are five main factors that shift the demand 
curve:
•  A change in the prices of related goods or services, 
such as substitutes or complements
•  A change in income: when income rises, the demand 
for normal goods increases and the demand for 
inferior goods decreases.
• A change in tastes
• A change in expectations
• A change in the number of consumers
 5. The market demand curve for a good or service is the 
horizontal sum of the individual demand curves of 
all consumers in the market.
 6. The supply schedule shows the quantity supplied at 
each price and is represented graphically by a supply 
curve. Supply curves usually slope upward.
 7. A movement along the supply curve occurs when 
a price change leads to a change in the quantity sup-
plied. When economists talk of increasing or decreas-
ing supply, they mean shifts of the supply curve—a 
change in the quantity supplied at any given price. An 
increase in supply causes a rightward shift of the sup-
ply curve. A decrease in supply causes a leftward shift.
 8. There are five main factors that shift the supply curve:
• A change in input prices
• A change in the prices of related goods and services
• A change in technology
• A change in expectations
• A change in the number of producers
 9. The market supply curve for a good or service is the 
horizontal sum of the individual supply curves of all 
producers in the market.
 10. The supply and demand model is based on the prin-
ciple that the price in a market moves to its equilib-
rium price, or market-clearing price, the price at 
which the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity 
supplied. This quantity is the equilibrium quantity. 
When the price is above its market-clearing level, 
there is a surplus that pushes the price down. When 
the price is below its market-clearing level, there is a 
shortage that pushes the price up.
 11. An increase in demand increases both the equilib-
rium price and the equilibrium quantity; a decrease 
in demand has the opposite effect. An increase in 
supply reduces the equilibrium price and increases 
the equilibrium quantity; a decrease in supply has the 
opposite effect.
 12. Shifts of the demand curve and the supply curve can 
happen simultaneously. When they shift in opposite 
directions, the change in equilibrium price is predict-
able but the change in equilibrium quantity is not. 
When they shift in the same direction, the change in 
equilibrium quantity is predictable but the change 
in equilibrium price is not. In general, the curve that 
shifts the greater distance has a greater effect on the 
changes in equilibrium price and quantity.

PROBLEMS
 1. A survey indicated that chocolate is Americans’ favorite 
ice-cream flavor. For each of the following, indicate the 
possible effects on demand, supply, or both as well as 
equilibrium price and quantity of chocolate ice cream.
 a. A severe drought in the Midwest causes dairy farm-
ers to reduce the number of milk-producing cattle 
in their herds by a third. These dairy farmers sup-
ply cream that is used to manufacture chocolate 
ice cream.
 b. A new report by the American Medical Association 
reveals that chocolate does, in fact, have significant 
health benefits.
 c. The discovery of cheaper synthetic vanilla flavoring 
lowers the price of vanilla ice cream.
 d. New technology for mixing and freezing ice cream 
lowers manufacturers’ costs of producing chocolate 
ice cream.
 2. In a supply and demand diagram, draw the shift of the 
demand curve for hamburgers in your hometown due 
to the following events. In each case, show the effect on 
equilibrium price and quantity.
 a. The price of tacos increases.
 b. All hamburger sellers raise the price of their french 
fries.
 c. Income falls in town. Assume that hamburgers are a 
normal good for most people.
 d. Income falls in town. Assume that hamburgers are 
an inferior good for most people.
 e. Hot dog stands cut the price of hot dogs.
 3. The market for many goods changes in predictable ways 
according to the time of year, in response to events such 
as holidays, vacation times, seasonal changes in pro-
duction, and so on. Using supply and demand, explain 
the change in price in each of the following cases. Note 
that supply and demand may shift simultaneously.
 a. Lobster prices usually fall during the summer peak 
lobster harvest season, despite the fact that people 
like to eat lobster during the summer more than at 
any other time of year.
 b. The price of a Christmas tree is lower after 
Christmas than before but fewer trees are sold.
 c. The price of a round-trip ticket to Paris on Air 
France falls by more than $200 after the end of 
school vacation in September. This happens despite 
the fact that generally worsening weather increases 
the cost of operating flights to Paris, and Air France 
therefore reduces the number of flights to Paris at 
any given price.
 4. Show in a diagram the effect on the demand curve, the 
supply curve, the equilibrium price, and the equilib-
rium quantity of each of the following events.
 a. The market for newspapers in your town
 Case 1: The salaries of journalists go up.
  Case 2: There is a big news event in your town, 
which is reported in the newspapers.
b. The market for St. Louis Rams cotton T-shirts
 Case 1: The Rams win the Super Bowl.
 Case 2: The price of cotton increases.
c. The market for bagels
 Case 1: People realize how fattening bagels are.
  Case 2: People have less time to make themselves a 
cooked breakfast.
d. The market for the Krugman and Wells economics 
textbook
  Case 1: Your professor makes it required reading for 
all of his or her students.
  Case 2: Printing costs for textbooks are lowered by 
the use of synthetic paper.
 5. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that in 
2004 each person in the United States consumed an 
average of 37 gallons of soft drinks (nondiet) at an 
average price of $2 per gallon. Assume that, at a price 
of $1.50 per gallon, each individual consumer would 
demand 50 gallons of soft drinks. The U.S. population 
in 2004 was 294 million. From this information about 
the individual demand schedule, calculate the market 
demand schedule for soft drinks for the prices of $1.50 
and $2 per gallon.
 6. Suppose that the supply schedule of Maine lobsters is as 
follows:

Maine lobsters. What are the equilibrium price and 
quantity of lobsters?

 b. What is the demand schedule for Maine lobsters 
now that French consumers can also buy them? 
Draw a supply and demand diagram that illus-
trates the new equilibrium price and quantity 
of lobsters. What will happen to the price at 
which fishermen can sell lobster? What will 
happen to the price paid by U.S. consumers? 
What will happen to the quantity consumed by 
U.S. consumers?
 7. Find the flaws in reasoning in the following statements, 
paying particular attention to the distinction between 
shifts of and movements along the supply and demand 
curves. Draw a diagram to illustrate what actually hap-
pens in each situation.
 a. “A technological innovation that lowers the cost of 
producing a good might seem at first to result in a 
reduction in the price of the good to consumers. But 
a fall in price will increase demand for the good, 
and higher demand will send the price up again. 
It is not certain, therefore, that an innovation will 
really reduce price in the end.”
 b. “A study shows that eating a clove of garlic a 
day can help prevent heart disease, causing 
many consumers to demand more garlic. This 
increase in demand results in a rise in the price 
of garlic. Consumers, seeing that the price of 
garlic has gone up, reduce their demand for 
garlic. This causes the demand for garlic to 
decrease and the price of garlic to fall. Therefore, 
the ultimate effect of the study on the price of 
garlic is uncertain.”
 8. The following table shows a demand schedule for a nor-
mal good.

 a. Do you think that the increase in quantity demand-
ed (say, from 90 to 110 in the table) when price 
decreases (from $21 to $19) is due to a rise in con-
sumers’ income? Explain clearly (and briefly) why or 
why not.
 b. Now suppose that the good is an inferior good. 
Would the demand schedule still be valid for an 
inferior good?
 c. Lastly, assume you do not know whether the good is 
normal or inferior. Devise an experiment that would 
allow you to determine which one it was. Explain.
 9. According to the New York Times (November 18, 2006), 
the number of car producers in China is increasing rap-
idly. The newspaper reports that “China has more car 
brands now than the United States. . . . But while 
car sales have climbed 38 percent in the first three 
quarters of this year, automakers have increased their 
output even faster, causing fierce competition and 
a slow erosion in prices.” At the same time, Chinese 
consumers’ incomes have risen. Assume that cars are a 
normal good. Use a diagram of the supply and demand 
curves for cars in China to explain what has happened 
in the Chinese car market.
 10. Aaron Hank is a star hitter for the Bay City baseball 
team. He is close to breaking the major league record 
for home runs hit during one season, and it is widely 
anticipated that in the next game he will break that 
record. As a result, tickets for the team’s next game 
have been a hot commodity. But today it is announced 
that, due to a knee injury, he will not in fact play in the 
team’s next game. Assume that season ticket-holders are 
able to resell their tickets if they wish. Use supply and 
demand diagrams to explain the following.
 a. Show the case in which this announcement results 
in a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium 
quantity than before the announcement.
 b. Show the case in which this announcement results 
in a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilib-
rium quantity than before the announcement.
 c. What accounts for whether case a or case b occurs?
 d. Suppose that a scalper had secretly learned before 
the announcement that Aaron Hank would not play 
in the next game. What actions do you think he 
would take?
 11. In Rolling Stone magazine, several fans and rock stars, 
including Pearl Jam, were bemoaning the high price 
of concert tickets. One superstar argued, “It just isn’t 
worth $75 to see me play. No one should have to pay 
that much to go to a concert.” Assume this star sold 
out arenas around the country at an average ticket 
price of $75.
 a. How would you evaluate the argument that ticket 
prices are too high?
 b. Suppose that due to this star’s protests, ticket prices 
were lowered to $50. In what sense is this price too 
low? Draw a diagram using supply and demand 
curves to support your argument.
 c. Suppose Pearl Jam really wanted to bring down tick-
et prices. Since the band controls the supply of its 
services, what do you recommend they do? Explain 
using a supply and demand diagram.
 d. Suppose the band’s next CD was a total dud. Do 
you think they would still have to worry about

ticket prices being too high? Why or why not? 
Draw a supply and demand diagram to support 
your argument.
 e. Suppose the group announced their next tour 
was going to be their last. What effect would this 
likely have on the demand for and price of tickets?

imposes costly regulations on manufacturers that 
cause them to reduce supply by one-third at any

 13. After several years of decline, the market for handmade 
acoustic guitars is making a comeback. These guitars 
are usually made in small workshops employing rela-
tively few highly skilled luthiers. Assess the impact on 
the equilibrium price and quantity of handmade acous-
tic guitars as a result of each of the following events. 
In your answers indicate which curve(s) shift(s) and in 
which direction.
 a. Environmentalists succeed in having the use of 
Brazilian rosewood banned in the United States, 
forcing luthiers to seek out alternative, more costly 
woods.
 b. A foreign producer reengineers the guitar-making 
process and floods the market with identical 
guitars.
 c. Music featuring handmade acoustic guitars makes 
a comeback as audiences tire of heavy metal and 
alternative rock music.
 d. The country goes into a deep recession and the 
income of the average American falls sharply.
 14. Demand twisters: Sketch and explain the demand rela-
tionship in each of the following statements.
 a. I would never buy a Britney Spears CD! You couldn’t 
even give me one for nothing.
 b. I generally buy a bit more coffee as the price falls. 
But once the price falls to $2 per pound, I’ll buy out 
the entire stock of the supermarket.
 c. I spend more on orange juice even as the price rises. 
(Does this mean that I must be violating the law of 
demand?)
 d. Due to a tuition rise, most students at a college find 
themselves with less disposable income. Almost all 
of them eat more frequently at the school cafeteria 
and less often at restaurants, even though prices at 
the cafeteria have risen, too. (This one requires that 
you draw both the demand and the supply curves for 
school cafeteria meals.)
 15. Will Shakespeare is a struggling playwright in 
sixteenth-century London. As the price he receives 
for writing a play increases, he is willing to write 
more plays. For the following situations, use a 
diagram to illustrate how each event affects the 
equilibrium price and quantity in the market for 
Shakespeare’s plays.
 a. The playwright Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare’s 
chief rival, is killed in a bar brawl.
 b. The bubonic plague, a deadly infectious disease, 
breaks out in London.
 c. To celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada, 
Queen Elizabeth declares several weeks of 
festivities, which involves commissioning new 
plays.
 16. The small town of Middling experiences a sudden dou-
bling of the birth rate. After three years, the birth rate 
returns to normal. Use a diagram to illustrate the effect 
of these events on the following.
 a. The market for an hour of babysitting services in 
Middling today
 b. The market for an hour of babysitting services 
14 years into the future, after the birth rate has 
returned to normal, by which time children born 
today are old enough to work as babysitters
 c. The market for an hour of babysitting services 
30 years into the future, when children born today 
are likely to be having children of their own
 17. Use a diagram to illustrate how each of the following

rior good.
 e. Consumers expect the price of pizza to fall next 
week.
 18. Although he was a prolific artist, Pablo Picasso painted 
only 1,000 canvases during his “Blue Period.” Picasso is 
now dead, and all of his Blue Period works are currently

 a. Draw a supply curve for Picasso Blue Period works. 
Why is this supply curve different from ones you

HERE IS A LIVELY MARKET IN
second-hand college textbooks. At 
the end of each term, some students 
who took a course decide that the money 
they can make by selling their used 
books is worth more to them than keep-
ing the books. And some students who 
are taking the course next term prefer 
to buy a somewhat battered but less 
expensive used textbook rather than 
buy at full price.
Textbook publishers and authors 
are not happy about these transac-
tions because they cut into sales of new 
books. But both the students who sell 
used books and those who buy them 
clearly benefit from the existence of 
second-hand textbook markets. That is 
why many college bookstores create 
them, buying used textbooks and selling 
them alongside the new books. And it is 
why there are several websites devoted 
exclusively to the buying and selling of 
second-hand textbooks. 
But can we put a number on what 
used textbook buyers and sellers gain 
from these transactions? Can we answer 
the question, “How much do the buyers 
and sellers of textbooks gain from the 
existence of the used-book market?”
Yes, we can. In this chapter we will 
see how to measure benefits, such as 
those to buyers of used textbooks, from 
being able to purchase a good—known 
as consumer surplus. And we will see 
that there is a corresponding measure, 
producer surplus, of the benefits sellers 
receive from being able to sell a good.
The concepts of consumer surplus 
and producer surplus are extremely use-
ful for analyzing a wide variety of eco-
nomic issues. They let us calculate how 
much benefit producers and consumers 
receive from the existence of a market. 
They also allow us to calculate how the 
welfare of consumers and producers is 
affected by changes in market prices. 
Such calculations play a crucial role in 
evaluating many economic policies.
What information do we need to cal-
culate consumer and producer surplus? 
Surprisingly, all we need are the demand 
and supply curves for a good. That is, 
the supply and demand model isn’t just 
a model of how a competitive market 
works—it’s also a model of how much 
consumers and producers gain from par-
ticipating in that market. So our first 
step will be to learn how consumer and 
producer surplus can be derived from 
the demand and supply curves. We will 
then see how these concepts can be 
applied to actual economic issues.

Consumer Surplus and the 
Demand Curve
T
he market in used textbooks is a big business in terms of dollars and cents—
approximately $3 billion in 2009. More importantly for us, it is a convenient 
starting point for developing the concepts of consumer and producer sur-
plus. We’ll use the concepts of consumer and producer surplus to understand 
exactly how buyers and sellers benefit from a competitive market and how big 
those benefits are. In addition, these concepts play important roles in analyzing 
what happens when competitive markets don’t work well or there is interference 
in the market.
So let’s begin by looking at the market for used textbooks, starting with the 
buyers. The key point, as we’ll see in a minute, is that the demand curve is derived 
from their tastes or preferences—and that those same preferences also determine 
how much they gain from the opportunity to buy used books.
Willingness to Pay and the Demand Curve
A used book is not as good as a new book—it will be battered and coffee-stained, 
may include someone else’s highlighting, and may not be completely up to date. 
How much this bothers you depends on your preferences. Some potential buyers 
would prefer to buy the used book even if it is only slightly cheaper than a new 
one; others would buy the used book only if it is considerably cheaper. Let’s define 
a potential buyer’s willingness to pay as the maximum price at which he or she 
would buy a good, in this case a used textbook. An individual won’t buy the good 
if it costs more than this amount but is eager to do so if it costs less. If the price 
is just equal to an individual’s willingness to pay, he or she is indifferent between 
buying and not buying. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume that the individual 
buys the good in this case.
The table in Figure 4-1 shows five potential buyers of a used book that costs 
$100 new, listed in order of their willingness to pay. At one extreme is Aleisha, 
who will buy a second-hand book even if the price is as high as $59. Brad is 
less willing to have a used book and will buy one only if the price is $45 or 
less. Claudia is willing to pay only $35 and Darren, only $25. And Edwina, 
who really doesn’t like the idea of a used book, will buy one only if it costs no 
more than $10.
How many of these five students will actually buy a used book? It depends on 
the price. If the price of a used book is $55, only Aleisha buys one; if the price is 
$40, Aleisha and Brad both buy used books, and so on. So the information in the 
table can be used to construct the demand schedule for used textbooks.
As we saw in Chapter 3, we can use this demand schedule to derive the 
market demand curve shown in Figure 4-1. Because we are considering only a 
small number of consumers, this curve doesn’t look like the smooth demand 
curves of Chapter 3, where markets contained hundreds or thousands of con-
sumers. Instead, this demand curve is step-shaped, with alternating horizon-
tal and vertical segments. Each horizontal segment—each step—corresponds 
to one potential buyer’s willingness to pay. However, we’ll see shortly that for 
the analysis of consumer surplus it doesn’t matter whether the demand curve 
is step-shaped, as in this figure, or whether there are many consumers, mak-
ing the curve smooth.
Willingness to Pay and Consumer Surplus
Suppose that the campus bookstore makes used textbooks available at a price of 
$30. In that case Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia will buy books. Do they gain from 
their purchases, and if so, how much?
A consumer’s willingness to pay 
for a good is the maximum price 
at which he or she would buy that 
good.

C H A P T E R  4    C O N S U M E R  A N D  P RO D U C E R  S U R P LU S    103
The answer, shown in Table 4-1, is that each student who purchases a 
book does achieve a net gain but that the amount of the gain differs among 
students.
Aleisha would have been willing to pay $59, so her net gain is $59 − $30 = $29. 
Brad would have been willing to pay $45, so his net gain is $45 − $30 = $15. Claudia 
would have been willing to pay $35, so her net gain is $35 − $30 = $5. Darren and 
Edwina, however, won’t be willing to buy a used book at a price of $30, so they 
neither gain nor lose.
The net gain that a buyer achieves from the purchase of a good is called that 
buyer’s individual consumer surplus. What we learn from this example is that

With only five potential consumers in this market, 
the demand curve is step-shaped. Each step 
represents one consumer, and its height indi-
cates that consumer’s willingness to pay—the 
maximum price at which he or she will buy a 
used textbook—as indicated in the table. Aleisha 
has the highest willingness to pay at $59, Brad 
has the next highest at $45, and so on down 
to Edwina with the lowest willingness to pay at 
$10. At a price of $59, the quantity demanded 
is one (Aleisha); at a price of $45, the quantity 
demanded is two (Aleisha and Brad); and so on 
until you reach a price of $10, at which all five 
students are willing to purchase a used textbook.
Individual consumer surplus is 
the net gain to an individual buyer 
from the purchase of a good. It is 
equal to the difference between the 
buyer’s willingness to pay and the 
price paid.

104    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
whenever a buyer pays a price less than his or her willingness to pay, the buyer 
achieves some individual consumer surplus.
The sum of the individual consumer surpluses achieved by all the buyers of a 
good is known as the total consumer surplus achieved in the market. In Table 
4-1, the total consumer surplus is the sum of the individual consumer surpluses 
achieved by Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia: $29 + $15 + $5 = $49.
Economists often use the term consumer surplus to refer to both individual 
and total consumer surplus. We will follow this practice; it will always be clear 
in context whether we are referring to the consumer surplus achieved by an indi-
vidual or by all buyers.
Total consumer surplus can be represented graphically. Figure 4-2 reproduces 
the demand curve from Figure 4-1. Each step in that demand curve is one book 
wide and represents one consumer. For example, the height of Aleisha’s step is 
$59, her willingness to pay. This step forms the top of a rectangle, with $30—the 
price she actually pays for a book—forming the bottom. The area of Aleisha’s rect-
angle, ($59 − $30) × 1 = $29, is her consumer surplus from purchasing one book at 
$30. So the individual consumer surplus Aleisha gains is the area of the dark blue 
rectangle shown in Figure 4-2.
In addition to Aleisha, Brad and Claudia will also each buy a book when the 
price is $30. Like Aleisha, they benefit from their purchases, though not as much, 
because they each have a lower willingness to pay. Figure 4-2 also shows the con-
sumer surplus gained by Brad and Claudia; again, this can be measured by the 
areas of the appropriate rectangles. Darren and Edwina, because they do not buy 
books at a price of $30, receive no consumer surplus.
The total consumer surplus achieved in this market is just the sum 
of the individual consumer surpluses received by Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia. 
So total consumer surplus is equal to the combined area of the three rectangles—
the entire shaded area in Figure 4-2. Another way to say this is that total 
consumer surplus is equal to the area below the demand curve but above 
the price.
Consumer Surplus in the Used-Textbook Market
4-2
At a price of $30, Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia each 
buy a book but Darren and Edwina do not. Aleisha, 
Brad, and Claudia receive individual consumer sur-
pluses equal to the difference between their willing-
ness to pay and the price, illustrated by the areas 
of the shaded rectangles. Both Darren and Edwina 
have a willingness to pay less than $30, so they are 
unwilling to buy a book in this market; they receive 
zero consumer surplus. The total consumer surplus 
is given by the entire shaded area—the sum of the 
individual consumer surpluses of Aleisha, Brad, and 
Claudia—equal to $29 + $15 + $5 = $49.

Total consumer surplus is the sum 
of the individual consumer surpluses 
of all the buyers of a good in a 
market.
The term consumer surplus is 
often used to refer to both individual 
and to total consumer surplus.

Figure 4-2 illustrates the following general principle: The total consumer sur-
plus generated by purchases of a good at a given price is equal to the area below the 
demand curve but above that price. The same principle applies regardless of the 
number of consumers.
When we consider large markets, this graphical representation of consumer 
surplus becomes extremely helpful. Consider, for example, the sales of iPads to 
millions of potential buyers. Each potential buyer has a maximum price that he 
or she is willing to pay. With so many potential buyers, the demand curve will be 
smooth, like the one shown in Figure 4-3.
Suppose that at a price of $500, a total of 1 million iPads are purchased. 
How much do consumers gain from being able to buy those 1 million iPads? We 
could answer that question by calculating the individual consumer surplus of 
each buyer and then adding these numbers up to arrive at a total. But it is much 
easier just to look at Figure 4-3 and use the fact that total consumer surplus is 
equal to the shaded area. As in our original example, consumer surplus is equal 
to the area below the demand curve but above the price. (You can refresh your 
memory on how to calculate the area of a right triangle by reviewing the appendix 
to Chapter 2.)
How Changing Prices Affect Consumer Surplus
It is often important to know how much consumer surplus changes when the 
price changes. For example, we may want to know how much consumers are 
hurt if a flood in Pakistan drives up cotton prices or how much consumers gain 
if the introduction of fish farming makes salmon steaks less expensive. The same 
approach we have used to derive consumer surplus can be used to answer ques-
tions about how changes in prices affect consumers.
Let’s return to the example of the market for used textbooks. Suppose that the 
bookstore decided to sell used textbooks for $20 instead of $30. How much would 
this fall in price increase consumer surplus?
Consumer Surplus

The demand curve for iPads is smooth because 
there are many potential buyers. At a price of $500, 
1 million iPads are demanded. The consumer sur-
plus at this price is equal to the shaded area: the 
area below the demand curve but above the price. 
This is the total net gain to consumers generated 
from buying and consuming iPads when the price 
is $500.

The answer is illustrated in Figure 4-4. As shown in the figure, there are two 
parts to the increase in consumer surplus. The first part, shaded dark blue, is 
the gain of those who would have bought books even at the higher price of $30. 
Each of the students who would have bought books at $30—Aleisha, Brad, and 
Claudia—now pays $10 less, and therefore each gains $10 in consumer surplus 
from the fall in price to $20. So the dark blue area represents the $10 × 3 = $30 
increase in consumer surplus to those three buyers. 
The second part, shaded light blue, is the gain to those who would not have 
bought a book at $30 but are willing to pay more than $20. In this case that 
gain goes to Darren, who would not have bought a book at $30 but does buy 
one at $20. He gains $5—the difference between his willingness to pay of $25 
and the new price of $20. So the light blue area represents a further $5 gain in 
consumer surplus. 
The total increase in consumer surplus is the sum of the shaded areas, $35. 
Likewise, a rise in price from $20 to $30 would decrease consumer surplus by an 
amount equal to the sum of the shaded areas.
Figure 4-4 illustrates that when the price of a good falls, the area under the 
demand curve but above the price—which we have seen is equal to total consum-
er surplus—increases. Figure 4-5 shows the same result for the case of a smooth 
demand curve, the demand for iPads. Here we assume that the price of iPads 
falls from $2,000 to $500, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded from 
200,000 to 1 million units. 
As in the used-textbook example, we divide the gain in consumer surplus 
into two parts. The dark blue rectangle in Figure 4-5 corresponds to the 
dark blue area in Figure 4-4: it is the gain to the 200,000 people who would 
have bought iPads even at the higher price of $2,000. As a result of the price 
reduction, each receives additional surplus of $1,500. The light blue triangle 
in Figure 4-5 corresponds to the light blue area in Figure 4-4: it is the gain to 
people who would not have bought the good at the higher price but are willing

There are two parts to the increase in con-
sumer surplus generated by a fall in price 
from $30 to $20. The first is given by the 
dark blue rectangle: each person who would 
have bought at the original price of $30—
Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia—receives an 
increase in consumer surplus equal to the 
total reduction in price, $10. So the area of 
the dark blue rectangle corresponds to an 
amount equal to 3 × $10 = $30. The sec-
ond part is given by the light blue area: the 
increase in consumer surplus for those who 
would not have bought at the original price of 
$30 but who buy at the new price of $20—
namely, Darren. Darren’s willingness to pay is 
$25, so he now receives consumer surplus 
of $5. The total increase in consumer surplus 
is (3 × $10) + $5 = $35, represented by the 
sum of the shaded areas. Likewise, a rise 
in price from $20 to $30 would decrease 
consumer surplus by $35, the amount corre-
sponding to the sum of the shaded areas.

to do so at a price of $500. For example, the light blue triangle includes the 
gain to someone who would have been willing to pay $1,000 for an iPad and 
therefore gains $500 in consumer surplus when it is possible to buy an iPad 
for only $500. 
As before, the total gain in consumer surplus is the sum of the shaded areas: 
the increase in the area under the demand curve but above the price.
What would happen if the price of a good were to rise instead of fall? We 
would do the same analysis in reverse. Suppose, for example, that for some

A fall in the price of an iPad from $2,000 to $500 
leads to an increase in the quantity demanded and 
an increase in consumer surplus. The change in 
total consumer surplus is given by the sum of the 
shaded areas: the total area below the demand 
curve and between the old and new prices. Here, 
the dark blue area represents the increase in con-
sumer surplus for the 200,000 consumers who 
would have bought an iPad at the original price of 
$2,000; they each receive an increase in consumer 
surplus of $1,500. The light blue area represents 
the increase in consumer surplus for those willing 
to buy at a price equal to or greater than $500 but 
less than $2,000. Similarly, a rise in the price of an 
iPad from $500 to $2,000 generates a decrease 
in consumer surplus equal to the sum of the two 
shaded areas.

In 2010, over 3,900 people in the United 
States died while waiting for a kidney 
transplant. In early 2011, almost 90,000 
were wait-listed. Since the number of those 
in need of a kidney far exceeds availability, 
what is the best way to allocate available 
organs? A market isn’t feasible. For under-
standable reasons, the sale of human body 
parts is illegal in this country. So the task of 
establishing a protocol for these situations 
has fallen to the nonprofit group United 
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
Under current UNOS guidelines, a 
donated kidney goes to the person who 
has been waiting the longest. According 
to this system, an available kidney would 
go to a 75-year-old who has been wait-
ing for 2 years instead of to a 25-year-
old who has been waiting 6 months, 
even though the 25-year-old will likely 
live longer and benefit from the trans-
planted organ for a longer period of time.
To address this issue, UNOS is devis-
ing a new set of guidelines based on a 
concept it calls “net benefit.” According 
to these new guidelines, kidneys would 
be allocated on the basis of who will 
receive the greatest net benefit, where 
net benefit is measured as the expected 
increase in life span from the transplant. 
And age is by far the biggest predictor of 
how long someone will live after a trans-
plant. For example, a typical 25-year-old 
diabetic will gain an extra 8.7 years of life 
from a transplant, but a typical 55-year-
old diabetic will gain only 3.6 extra years. 
Under the current system, based 
on waiting times, transplants lead to 
about 44,000 extra years of life for 
recipients; under the new system, that 
number would jump to 55,000 extra 
years. The share of kidneys going to 
those in their 20s would triple; the 
share going to those 60 and older 
would be halved.
What does this have to do with con-
sumer surplus? As you may have guessed, 
the UNOS concept of “net benefit” is a lot 
like individual consumer surplus—the indi-
vidual consumer surplus generated from 
getting a new kidney. In essence, UNOS 
has devised a system that allocates 
donated kidneys according to who gets 
the greatest individual consumer surplus. 
In terms of results, then, its proposed “net 
benefit” system operates a lot like a com-
petitive market.

reason the price of iPads rises from $500 to $2,000. This would lead to a fall 
in consumer surplus, equal to the sum of the shaded areas in Figure 4-5. This 
loss consists of two parts. The dark blue rectangle represents the loss to con-
sumers who would still buy an iPad, even at a price of $2,000. The light blue 
triangle represents the loss to consumers who decide not to buy an iPad at the 
higher price.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
WHEN MONEY ISN’T ENOUGH
T
he key insight we get from the concept of consumer surplus is that pur-
chases yield a net benefit to the consumer because the consumer typically 
pays a price less than his or her willingness to pay for the good. Another way 
to say this is that the right to buy a good at the going price is a valuable thing 
in itself.
Most of the time we don’t think about the value associated 
with the right to buy a good. In a market economy, we take it for 
granted that we can buy whatever we want, as long as we are will-
ing to pay the market price. 
But that hasn’t always been true. For example, during World 
War II the demands of wartime production created shortages of 
consumer goods when these goods were sold at prewar prices. 
Rather than allow prices to rise, government officials in many 
countries created a system of rationing. To buy sugar, meat, cof-
fee, gasoline, and many other goods, you not only had to pay cash; 
you also had to present stamps or coupons from books issued to 
each family by the government. These pieces of paper, which rep-
resented the right to buy goods at the government-regulated price, 
quickly became valuable commodities in themselves. 
As a result, illegal markets in meat stamps and gasoline cou-
pons sprang into existence. Moreover, criminals began stealing 
coupons and even counterfeiting stamps.
The funny thing was that even if you had bought a gasoline coupon on the 
illegal market, you still had to pay to purchase gasoline. So what you were 
buying on the illegal market was not the good but the right to buy the good at 
the government-regulated price. That is, people who bought ration coupons on 
the illegal market were paying for the right to get some consumer surplus.

stuffed jalapeno peppers. There are 
two consumers, Casey and Josey, 
and their willingness to pay for each 
pepper is given in the accompanying 
table. (Neither is willing to consume 
more than 4 peppers at any price.) 
Use the table (i) to construct the 
demand schedule for peppers for 
prices of $0.00, $0.10, and so on, up to $0.90, and (ii) to calculate the total consumer 
surplus when the price of a pepper is $0.40.

• The demand curve for a good is 
determined by each potential con-
sumer’s willingness to pay.
• Individual consumer surplus is the 
net gain an individual consumer 
gets from buying a good.
• The total consumer surplus in a 
given market is equal to the area 
below the market demand curve 
but above the price.
• A fall in the price of a good increases 
consumer surplus through two chan-
nels: a gain to consumers who would 
have bought at the original price 
and a gain to consumers who are 
persuaded to buy by the lower price. 
A rise in the price of a good reduces 
consumer surplus in a similar fashion.

Producer Surplus and the Supply Curve
J
ust as some buyers of a good would have been willing to pay more for their 
purchase than the price they actually pay, some sellers of a good would have 
been willing to sell it for less than the price they actually receive. So just as 
there are consumers who receive consumer surplus from buying in a market, 
there are producers who receive producer surplus from selling in a market.
Cost and Producer Surplus
Consider a group of students who are potential sellers of used textbooks. Because 
they have different preferences, the various potential sellers differ in the price at 
which they are willing to sell their books. The table in Figure 4-6 shows the prices 
at which several different students would be willing to sell. Andrew is willing to 
sell the book as long as he can get at least $5; Betty won’t sell unless she can get at 
least $15; Carlos, unless he can get $25; Donna, unless she can get $35; Engelbert, 
unless he can get $45.
The lowest price at which a potential seller is willing to sell has a special name 
in economics: it is called the seller’s cost. So Andrew’s cost is $5, Betty’s is $15, 
and so on.
Using the term cost, which people normally associate with the monetary cost 
of producing a good, may sound a little strange when applied to sellers of used 
textbooks. The students don’t have to manufacture the books, so it doesn’t cost 
the student who sells a used textbook anything to make that book available for 
sale, does it?

The supply curve illustrates seller’s cost, the 
lowest price at which a potential seller is will-
ing to sell the good, and the quantity supplied 
at that price. Each of the five students has one 
book to sell and each has a different cost, as 
indicated in the accompanying table. At a price 
of $5 the quantity supplied is one (Andrew), 
at $15 it is two (Andrew and Betty), and so on 
until you reach $45, the price at which all five 
students are willing to sell.
A seller’s cost is the lowest price 
at which he or she is willing to sell 
a good.

Yes, it does. A student who sells a book won’t have it later, as part of his or 
her personal collection. So there is an opportunity cost to selling a textbook, even 
if the owner has completed the course for which it was required. And remember 
that one of the basic principles of economics is that the true measure of the cost 
of doing something is always its opportunity cost. That is, the real cost of some-
thing is what you must give up to get it.
So it is good economics to talk of the minimum price at which someone will 
sell a good as the “cost” of selling that good, even if he or she doesn’t spend any 
money to make the good available for sale. Of course, in most real-world markets 
the sellers are also those who produce the good and therefore do spend money 
to make it available for sale. In this case, the cost of making the good available 
for sale includes monetary costs, but it may also include other opportunity costs.
Getting back to the example, suppose that Andrew sells his book for $30. 
Clearly he has gained from the transaction: he would have been willing to sell 
for only $5, so he has gained $25. This net gain, the difference between the price 
he actually gets and his cost—the minimum price at which he would have been 
willing to sell—is known as his individual producer surplus.
Just as we derived the demand curve from the willingness to pay of different 
consumers, we can derive the supply curve from the cost of different producers. The 
step-shaped curve in Figure 4-6 shows the supply curve implied by the costs shown 
in the accompanying table. At a price less than $5, none of the students are willing 
to sell; at a price between $5 and $15, only Andrew is willing to sell, and so on.
As in the case of consumer surplus, we can add the individual producer sur-
pluses of sellers to calculate the total producer surplus, the total net gain to 
all sellers in the market. Economists use the term producer surplus to refer to 
either individual or total producer surplus. Table 4-2 shows the net gain to each 
of the students who would sell a used book at a price of $30: $25 for Andrew, $15 
for Betty, and $5 for Carlos. The total producer surplus is $25 + $15 + $5 = $45.

As with consumer surplus, the producer surplus gained by those who sell books 
can be represented graphically. Figure 4-7 reproduces the supply curve from Figure 
4-6. Each step in that supply curve is one book wide and represents one seller. The 
height of Andrew’s step is $5, his cost. This forms the bottom of a rectangle, with 
$30, the price he actually receives for his book, forming the top. The area of this rec-
tangle, ($30 − $5) × 1 = $25, is his producer surplus. So the producer surplus Andrew 
gains from selling his book is the area of the dark red rectangle shown in the figure.
Let’s assume that the campus bookstore is willing to buy all the used copies 
of this book that students are willing to sell at a price of $30. Then, in addition 
to Andrew, Betty and Carlos will also sell their books. They will also benefit 
from their sales, though not as much as Andrew, because they have higher costs. 
Andrew, as we have seen, gains $25. Betty gains a smaller amount: since her cost 
is $15, she gains only $15. Carlos gains even less, only $5.
Individual producer surplus is 
the net gain to an individual seller 
from selling a good. It is equal to 
the difference between the price 
received and the seller’s cost.
Total producer surplus in a 
market is the sum of the individual 
producer surpluses of all the sellers 
of a good in a market. 
Economists use the term producer 
surplus to refer both to individual 
and to total producer surplus.

C H A P T E R  4    C O N S U M E R  A N D  P RO D U C E R  S U R P LU S    111
Again, as with consumer surplus, we have a general rule for determining the 
total producer surplus from sales of a good: The total producer surplus from sales 
of a good at a given price is the area above the supply curve but below that price.
This rule applies both to examples like the one shown in Figure 4-7, where 
there are a small number of producers and a step-shaped supply curve, and to 
more realistic examples, where there are many producers and the supply curve 
is smooth.
Consider, for example, the supply of wheat. Figure 4-8 shows how producer 
surplus depends on the price per bushel. Suppose that, as shown in the figure, the 
Producer Surplus in the Used-Textbook Market

At a price of $30, Andrew, Betty, and Carlos 
each sell a book but Donna and Engelbert do not. 
Andrew, Betty, and Carlos get individual producer 
surpluses equal to the difference between the 
price and their cost, illustrated here by the shaded 
rectangles. Donna and Engelbert each have a 
cost that is greater than the price of $30, so they 
are unwilling to sell a book and so receive zero 
producer surplus. The total producer surplus is 
given by the entire shaded area, the sum of the 
individual producer surpluses of Andrew, Betty, 
and Carlos, equal to $25 + $15 + $5 = $45.

price is $5 per bushel and farmers supply 1 million bushels. What is the benefit 
to the farmers from selling their wheat at a price of $5? Their producer surplus is 
equal to the shaded area in the figure—the area above the supply curve but below 
the price of $5 per bushel.
How Changing Prices Affect Producer Surplus
As with the case of consumer surplus, a change in price alters producer surplus. 
But the effects are opposite. While a fall in price increases consumer surplus, 
it reduces producer surplus. And a rise in price reduces consumer surplus but 
increases producer surplus.
To see this, let’s first consider a rise in the price of the good. Producers of the 
good will experience an increase in producer surplus, though not all producers 
gain the same amount. Some producers would have produced the good even at 
the original price; they will gain the entire price increase on every unit they pro-
duce. Other producers will enter the market because of the higher price; they will 
gain only the difference between the new price and their cost.
Figure 4-9 is the supply counterpart of Figure 4-5. It shows the effect on pro-
ducer surplus of a rise in the price of wheat from $5 to $7 per bushel. The increase 
in producer surplus is the sum of the shaded areas, which consists of two parts. 
First, there is a dark red rectangle corresponding to the gains to those farmers 
who would have supplied wheat even at the original $5 price. Second, there is an 
additional light red triangle that corresponds to the gains to those farmers who 
would not have supplied wheat at the original price but are drawn into the market 
by the higher price.
If the price were to fall from $7 to $5 per bushel, the story would run in 
reverse. The sum of the shaded areas would now be the decline in producer sur-
plus, the decrease in the area above the supply curve but below the price. The 
loss would consist of two parts, the loss to farmers who would still grow wheat at 
a price of $5 (the dark red rectangle) and the loss to farmers who cease to grow 
wheat because of the lower price (the light red triangle).
A Rise in the Price Increases Producer Surplus
4-9
A rise in the price of wheat from $5 to $7 leads to 
an increase in the quantity supplied and an increase 
in producer surplus. The change in total producer 
surplus is given by the sum of the shaded areas: the 
total area above the supply curve but between the 
old and new prices. The dark red area represents 
the gain to the farmers who would have supplied 
1 million bushels at the original price of $5; they 
each receive an increase in producer surplus of $2 
for each of those bushels. The triangular light red 
area represents the increase in producer surplus 
achieved by the farmers who supply the additional 
500,000 bushels because of the higher price. 
Similarly, a fall in the price of wheat from $7 to $5 
generates a reduction in producer surplus equal to 
the sum of the shaded areas.

Iowa farmland from 2009 to 2010. And there was no mystery as to why: it was all 
about the high prices being paid for wheat, corn, and soybeans. In 2010, the price 
of corn jumped by 52%; soybeans, by 34%; and wheat, by 47%.
Why were Iowa farm products commanding such high prices? There are three 
main reasons: ethanol, rising incomes in countries like China, and poor weather 
in other foodstuff-producing countries like Australia and Ukraine. 
Ethanol—a product made from corn and the same kind of alcohol that’s 
in beer and other alcoholic drinks—can also fuel automobiles. And in recent 
years government policy, at both the federal and state levels, has encour-
aged the use of gasoline that contains a percentage of 
ethanol. There are a couple of reasons for this policy, 
including some benefits in fighting air pollution and 
the hope that using more ethanol will reduce U.S. 
dependence on imported oil. Since ethanol comes from 
corn, the shift to ethanol fuel has led to an increase in 
the demand for corn.
But Iowa farmers have also benefited greatly from 
events in the global economy. As in the case of cot-
ton, which we studied in Chapter 3, changes in the 
demand for and supply of foodstuffs in world markets 
have led to rising prices for American corn, soybeans, 
and wheat. Rising incomes in countries like China 
have led to increased food consumption and increased 
demand for foodstuffs. Simultaneously, very bad weath-
er in Australia and Ukraine has led to a fall in supply. 
Predictably, increased demand coupled with reduced 
supply has led to a surge in foodstuff prices and a wind-
fall for Iowa farmers. 
What does this have to do with the price of land? A person who buys a farm 
in Iowa buys the producer surplus generated by that farm. And higher prices for 
corn, soybeans, and wheat, which raise the producer surplus of Iowa farmers, 
make Iowa farmland more valuable. According to an Iowa State University sur-
vey, in late 2010 the average price of an acre of Iowa farmland was $5,064, a 172% 
increase in 10 years.

 Quick Review
• The supply curve for a good is 
determined by the cost of each 
seller.
• The difference between the price 
and cost is the seller’s individual 
producer surplus.
• The total producer surplus is equal 
to the area above the market sup-
ply curve but below the price.
• When the price of a good rises, 
producer surplus increases through 
two channels: the gains of those 
who would have supplied the good 
at the original price and the gains 
of those who are induced to sup-
ply the good by the higher price. A 
fall in the price of a good similarly 
leads to a fall in producer surplus.

Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, 
and the Gains from Trade
O
ne of the 12 core principles of economics we introduced in Chapter 1 is that 
markets are a remarkably effective way to organize economic activity: they 
generally make society as well off as possible given the available resources. 
The concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus can help us deepen our 
understanding of why this is so.
The Gains from Trade
Let’s return to the market in used textbooks but now consider a much bigger 
market—say, one at a large state university. There are many potential buyers 
and sellers, so the market is competitive. Let’s line up incoming students who 
are potential buyers of a book in order of their willingness to pay, so that the 
entering student with the highest willingness to pay is potential buyer number 
1, the student with the next highest willingness to pay is number 2, and so on. 
Then we can use their willingness to pay to derive a demand curve like the one 
in Figure 4-11.
Similarly, we can line up outgoing students, who are potential sellers of the 
book, in order of their cost—starting with the student with the lowest cost, then 
the student with the next lowest cost, and so on—to derive a supply curve like the 
one shown in the same figure.
As we have drawn the curves, the market reaches equilibrium at a price of 
$30 per book, and 1,000 books are bought and sold at that price. The two shaded 
triangles show the consumer surplus (blue) and the producer surplus (red) gener-
ated by this market. The sum of consumer and producer surplus is known as the 
total surplus generated in a market.
The striking thing about this picture is that both consumers and producers 
gain—that is, both consumers and producers are better off because there is a 
market in this good. But this should come as no surprise—it illustrates another 
Total Surplus
4-11
In the market for used textbooks, the equilib-
rium price is $30 and the equilibrium quantity 
is 1,000 books. Consumer surplus is given 
by the blue area, the area below the demand 
curve but above the price. Producer surplus 
is given by the red area, the area above the 
supply curve but below the price. The sum of 
the blue and the red areas is total surplus, the 
total benefit to society from the production 
and consumption of the good.

core principle of economics: There are gains from trade. These gains from trade 
are the reason everyone is better off participating in a market economy than they 
would be if each individual tried to be self-sufficient.
But are we as well off as we could be? This brings us to the question of the 
efficiency of markets.
The Efficiency of Markets
Markets produce gains from trade, but in Chapter 1 we made an even bigger claim: 
that markets are usually efficient. That is, we claimed that once the market has pro-
duced its gains from trade, there is no way to make some people better off without 
making other people worse off, except under some well-defined conditions.
The analysis of consumer and producer surplus helps us understand why mar-
kets are usually efficient. To gain more intuition into why this is so, consider the 
fact that market equilibrium is just one way of deciding who consumes the good 
and who sells the good. There are other possible ways of making that decision. 
Consider, for example, the case of kidney transplants, discussed earlier in 
For Inquiring Minds. There you learned that available kidneys currently go to 
the people who have been waiting the longest, rather than to those most likely 
to benefit from the organ for a longer time. To address this inefficiency, a new 
set of guidelines is being devised to determine eligibility for a kidney transplant 
based on “net benefit,” a concept an awful lot like consumer surplus: kidneys 
would be allocated largely on the basis of who will benefit from them the most.
To further our understanding of why markets usually work so well, imagine a 
committee charged with improving on the market equilibrium by deciding who 
gets and who gives up a used textbook. The committee’s ultimate goal: to bypass 
the market outcome and devise another arrangement, one that would produce 
higher total surplus.
Let’s consider the three ways in which the committee might try to increase 
the total surplus:
 1. Reallocate consumption among consumers
 2. Reallocate sales among sellers
 3. Change the quantity traded
Reallocate Consumption Among Consumers The committee might try 
to increase total surplus by selling books to different consumers. Figure 4-12 
shows why this will result in lower surplus compared to the market equilib-
rium outcome. Points A and B show the positions on the demand curve of two 
potential buyers of used books, Ana and Bob. As we can see from the figure, 
Ana is willing to pay $35 for a book, but Bob is willing to pay only $25. Since 
the market equilibrium price is $30, under the market outcome Ana buys a book 
and Bob does not.
Now suppose the committee reallocates consumption. This would mean tak-
ing the book away from Ana and giving it to Bob. Since the book is worth $35 to 
Ana but only $25 to Bob, this change reduces total consumer surplus by $35 − $25 
= $10. Moreover, this result doesn’t depend on which two students we pick. Every 
student who buys a book at the market equilibrium has a willingness to pay of 
$30 or more, and every student who doesn’t buy a book has a willingness to pay 
of less than $30. So reallocating the good among consumers always means taking 
a book away from a student who values it more and giving it to one who values it 
less. This necessarily reduces total consumer surplus.
Reallocate Sales Among Sellers The committee might try to increase total 
surplus by altering who sells their books, taking sales away from sellers who 
would have sold their books at the market equilibrium and instead compelling 
those who would not have sold their books at the market equilibrium to sell them.

Figure 4-13 shows why this will result in lower surplus. Here points X and 
Y show the positions on the supply curve of Xavier, who has a cost of $25, and 
Yvonne, who has a cost of $35. At the equilibrium market price of $30, Xavier 
would sell his book but Yvonne would not sell hers. If the committee reallocated 
sales, forcing Xavier to keep his book and Yvonne to sell hers, total producer sur-
plus would be reduced by $35 − $25 = $10. 
Again, it doesn’t matter which two students we choose. Any student who sells 
a book at the market equilibrium has a lower cost than any student who keeps 
a book. So reallocating sales among sellers necessarily increases total cost and 
reduces total producer surplus.
Reallocating Consumption Lowers Consumer Surplus

Ana (point A) has a willingness to pay of $35. 
Bob (point B) has a willingness to pay of only 
$25. At the market equilibrium price of $30, 
Ana purchases a book but Bob does not. If we 
rearrange consumption by taking a book from 
Ana and giving it to Bob, consumer surplus 
declines by $10 and, as a result, total surplus 
declines by $10.

range sales by preventing Xavier from selling 
his book and compelling Yvonne to sell hers,

result, total surplus declines by $10.

Change the Quantity Traded The committee might try to increase total sur-
plus by compelling students to trade either more books or fewer books than the 
market equilibrium quantity. 
Figure 4-14 shows why this will result in lower surplus. It shows all four stu-
dents: potential buyers Ana and Bob, and potential sellers Xavier and Yvonne. To 
reduce sales, the committee will have to prevent a transaction that would have 
occurred in the market equilibrium—that is, prevent Xavier from selling to Ana. 
Since Ana is willing to pay $35 and Xavier’s cost is $25, preventing this transac-
tion reduces total surplus by $35 − $25 = $10. 
Changing the Quantity Lowers Total Surplus
4-14
If Xavier (point X) were prevented from sell-
ing his book to someone like Ana (point A), 
total surplus would fall by $10, the difference 
between Ana’s willingness to pay ($35) and 
Xavier’s cost ($25). This means that total sur-
plus falls whenever fewer than 1,000 books—
the equilibrium quantity—are transacted. 
Likewise, if Yvonne (point Y) were compelled 
to sell her book to someone like Bob (point B), 
total surplus would also fall by $10, the differ-
ence between Yvonne’s cost ($35) and Bob’s 
willingness to pay ($25). This means that total 
surplus falls whenever more than 1,000 books 
are transacted. These two examples show that 
at market equilibrium, all mutually beneficial 
transactions—and only mutually beneficial 
transactions—occur.

Once again, this result doesn’t depend on which two students we pick: any 
student who would have sold the book at the market equilibrium has a cost of 
$30 or less, and any student who would have purchased the book at the market 
equilibrium has a willingness to pay of $30 or more. So preventing any sale that 
would have occurred in the market equilibrium necessarily reduces total surplus.
Finally, the committee might try to increase sales by forcing Yvonne, who 
would not have sold her book at the market equilibrium, to sell it to someone 
like Bob, who would not have bought a book at the market equilibrium. Because 
Yvonne’s cost is $35, but Bob is only willing to pay $25, this transaction reduces 
total surplus by $10. And once again it doesn’t matter which two students we 
pick—anyone who wouldn’t have bought the book has a willingness to pay of less 
than $30, and anyone who wouldn’t have sold has a cost of more than $30.
The key point to remember is that once this market is in equilibrium, there 
is no way to increase the gains from trade. Any other outcome reduces total 
surplus. (This is why the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, is try-
ing, with its new guidelines based on “net benefit,” to reproduce the allocation 
of donated kidneys that would occur if there were a market for the organs.) We 
can summarize our results by stating that an efficient market performs four 
important functions:
 1. It allocates consumption of the good to the potential buyers who most value 
it, as indicated by the fact that they have the highest willingness to pay.

118    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
 2. It allocates sales to the potential sellers who most value the right to sell the 
good, as indicated by the fact that they have the lowest cost.
 3. It ensures that every consumer who makes a purchase values the good more 
than every seller who makes a sale, so that all transactions are mutually 
beneficial.
 4. It ensures that every potential buyer who doesn’t make a purchase values the 
good less than every potential seller who doesn’t make a sale, so that no mutu-
ally beneficial transactions are missed.
As a result of these four functions, any way of allocating the good other than the 
market equilibrium outcome lowers total surplus.
There are three caveats, however. First, although a market may be efficient, it 
isn’t necessarily fair. In fact, fairness, or equity, is often in conflict with efficiency. 
We’ll discuss this next.
The second caveat is that markets sometimes fail. As we mentioned in Chapter 1, 
under some well-defined conditions, markets can fail to deliver efficiency. When this 
occurs, markets no longer maximize total surplus. We provide a brief overview of 
why markets fail at the end of this chapter, reserving a more detailed analysis for 
later chapters.
Third, even when the market equilibrium maximizes total surplus, this does 
not mean that it results in the best outcome for every individual consumer and 
producer. Other things equal, each buyer would like to pay a lower price and each 
seller would like to receive a higher price. So if the government were to intervene 
in the market—say, by lowering the price below the equilibrium price to make 
consumers happy or by raising the price above the equilibrium price to make pro-
ducers happy—the outcome would no longer be efficient. Although some people 
would be happier, total surplus would be lower.
Equity and Efficiency
For many patients who need kidney transplants, the proposed UNOS guide-
lines, covered earlier, will be unwelcome news. Those who have waited years 
for a transplant will no doubt find these guidelines, which give precedence 
to younger patients, . . . well . . . unfair. And the guidelines raise other ques-
tions about fairness: Why limit potential transplant recipients to Americans? 
Why include younger patients with other chronic diseases? Why not give 
precedence to those who have made recognized contributions to society? 
And so on.
The point is that efficiency is about how to achieve goals, not what those goals 
should be. For example, UNOS decided that its goal is to maximize the life span 
of kidney recipients. Some might have argued for a different goal, and efficiency 
does not address which goal is the best. What efficiency does address is the best 
way to achieve a goal once it has been determined—in this case, using the UNOS 
concept of “net benefit.”
It’s easy to get carried away with the idea that markets are always right and 
that economic policies that interfere with efficiency are bad. But that would be 
misguided because there is another factor to consider: society cares about equity, 
or what’s “fair.” 
As we discussed in Chapter 1, there is often a trade-off between equity and 
efficiency: policies that promote equity often come at the cost of decreased effi-
ciency, and policies that promote efficiency often result in decreased equity. So 
it’s important to realize that a society’s choice to sacrifice some efficiency for 
the sake of equity, however it defines equity, is a valid one. And it’s important to 
understand that fairness, unlike efficiency, can be very hard to define. Fairness 
is a concept about which well-intentioned people often disagree.

ithout doubt, history books (or digital readers) will one day 
cite eBay, the online auction service, as one of the great 
American innovations of the twentieth century. Founded in 1995, 
the company says that its mission is “to help practically anyone 
trade practically anything on earth.” It provides a way for would-be 
buyers and would-be sellers—sometimes of unique or used items—
to find one another. And the gains from trade accruing to eBay 
users were evidently large: in 2010, eBay reported $53.5 billion in 
goods bought and sold on its websites. 
And the online matching hasn’t stopped there. Websites are now 
popping up that allow people to rent out their personal possessions—
items like cars, power tools, personal electronics, and spare bedrooms. 
Similar to what eBay did for buyers and sellers, these new websites 
provide a platform for renters and owners to find one another. 
A recent Business Week article describes how one Boston couple 
used the website RelayRides to rent out a car that had been sitting around largely 
unused, earning enough to pay for its upkeep and insurance. And according to 
the founder of RelayRides, Shelby Clark, the average car renter on his website 
earns $250 per month. 
Judith Chevalier, a Yale School of Management economist says, “These com-
panies let you wring a little bit of value out of . . . goods that are just sitting there.” 
RelayRides and companies like it are hoping that they can earn a nice return 
by helping you generate a little bit more surplus from your possessions.

kidney recipients, is this new guideline likely to reduce, increase, or leave total surplus 
unchanged? How might you justify this new guideline?

A Market Economy
A
s we learned earlier in the book, in a market economy decisions about pro-
duction and consumption are made via markets. In fact, the economy as a 
whole is made up of many interrelated markets. Up until now, to learn how 
markets work, we’ve been examining a single market—the market for used text-
books. But in reality, consumers and producers do not make decisions in isolated 
 Quick Review
• Total surplus measures the gains 
from trade in a market.
• Markets are efficient except under 
some well-defined conditions. We 
can demonstrate the efficiency of 
a market by considering what hap-
pens to total surplus if we start 
from the equilibrium and reallocate 
consumption, reallocate sales, or 
change the quantity traded. Any 
outcome other than the market 
equilibrium reduces total surplus, 
which means that the market equi-
librium is efficient.
• Because society cares about equity, 
government intervention in a mar-
ket that reduces efficiency while 
increasing equity can be justified.

markets. For example, a student’s decision in the market for used textbooks might 
be affected by how much interest must be paid on a student loan; thus, the deci-
sion in the used textbook market would be influenced by what is going on in the 
market for money.
We know that an efficient market equilibrium maximizes total surplus—the 
gains to buyers and sellers in that market. Is there a comparable result for an 
economy as a whole, an economy composed of a vast number of individual mar-
kets? The answer is yes, but with qualifications. 
When each and every market in the economy maximizes total surplus, then 
the economy as a whole is efficient. This is a very important result: just as it is 
impossible to make someone better off without making other people worse off in 
a single market when it is efficient, the same is true when each and every market 
in that economy is efficient. However, it is important to realize that this is a theo-
retical result: it is virtually impossible to find an economy in which every market 
is efficient. 
For now, let’s examine why markets and market economies typically work so 
well. Once we understand why, we can then briefly address why markets some-
times get it wrong.
Why Markets Typically Work So Well
Economists have written volumes about why markets are an effective way to orga-
nize an economy. In the end, well-functioning markets owe their effectiveness to 
two powerful features: property rights and the role of prices as economic signals.
By property rights we mean a system in which valuable items in the economy 
have specific owners who can dispose of them as they choose. In a system of prop-
erty rights, by purchasing a good you receive “ownership rights”: the right to use 
and dispose of the good as you see fit. Property rights are what make the mutually 
beneficial transactions in the used-textbook market, or any market, possible.
To see why property rights are crucial, imagine that students do not have full 
property rights in their textbooks and are prohibited from reselling them when 
the semester ends. This restriction on property rights would prevent many mutu-
ally beneficial transactions. Some students would be stuck with textbooks they 
will never reread when they would be much happier receiving some cash instead. 
Other students would be forced to pay full price for brand-new books when they 
would be happier getting slightly battered copies at a lower price.
Once a system of well-defined property rights is in place, the second necessary 
feature of well-functioning markets—prices as economic signals—can operate. An 
economic signal is any piece of information that helps people make better eco-
nomic decisions. There are thousands of signals that businesses watch in the real 
world. For example, business forecasters say that sales of cardboard boxes are a good 
early indicator of changes in industrial production: if businesses are buying lots of 
cardboard boxes, you can be sure that they will soon increase their production.
But prices are far and away the most important signals in a market economy, 
because they convey essential information about other people’s costs and their 
willingness to pay. If the equilibrium price of used books is $30, this in effect tells 
everyone both that there are consumers willing to pay $30 and up and that there 
are potential sellers with a cost of $30 or less. The signal given by the market price 
ensures that total surplus is maximized by telling people whether to buy books, 
sell books, or do nothing at all. 
Each potential seller with a cost of $30 or less learns from the market price 
that it’s a good idea to sell her book; if she has a higher cost, it’s a good idea to 
keep it. Likewise, each consumer willing to pay $30 or more learns from the mar-
ket price that it’s a good idea to buy a book; if he is unwilling to pay $30, then it’s 
a good idea not to buy a book.
This example shows that the market price “signals” to consumers with a willing-
ness to pay equal to or more than the market price that they should buy the good, 
Property rights are the rights of 
owners of valuable items, whether 
resources or goods, to dispose of 
those items as they choose.
An economic signal is any piece of 
information that helps people make 
better economic decisions.

just as it signals to producers with a cost equal to or less than the market price that 
they should sell the good. And since, in equilibrium, the quantity demanded equals 
the quantity supplied, all willing consumers will find willing sellers.
Prices can sometimes fail as economic signals. Sometimes a price is not an 
accurate indicator of how desirable a good is. When there is uncertainty about 
the quality of a good, price alone may not be an accurate indicator of the value 
of the good. For example, you can’t infer from the price alone whether a used car 
is good or a “lemon.” In fact, a well-known problem in economics is “the market 
for lemons,” a market in which prices don’t work well as economic signals. (We’ll 
learn about the market for lemons in Chapter 20.)
A Few Words of Caution
As we’ve seen, markets are an amazingly effective way to organize economic 
activity. But as we’ve noted, markets can sometimes get it wrong. We first 
learned about this in Chapter 1 in our fifth principle of interaction: When 
markets don’t achieve efficiency, government intervention can improve society’s 
welfare. When markets are inefficient, there are missed opportunities—ways 
in which production or consumption can be rearranged that would make some 
people better off without making other people worse off. In other words, there 
are gains from trade that go unrealized: total surplus could be increased. 
And when a market or markets are inefficient, the economy in which they are 
embedded is also inefficient.
Markets can be rendered inefficient for a number of reasons. Two of the most 
important are a lack of property rights and inaccuracy of prices as economic 
signals. When a market is inefficient, we have what is known as market failure. 
We will examine various types of market failure in later chapters. For now, let’s 
review the three main ways in which markets sometimes fall short of efficiency.
First, markets can fail when, in an attempt to capture more surplus, one 
party prevents mutually beneficial trades from occurring. This situation arises, 
for instance, when a market contains only a single seller of a good, known as a 
monopolist. In this case, the assumption we have relied on in supply and demand 
analysis—that no individual buyer or seller can have a noticeable effect on the 
market price—is no longer valid; the monopolist can determine the market price. 
As we’ll see in Chapter 13, this gives rise to inefficiency as a monopolist manipu-
lates the market price in order to increase profits, thereby preventing mutually 
beneficial trades from occurring.
Second, actions of individuals sometimes have side effects on the welfare 
of others that markets don’t take into account. In economics, these side effects 
are known as externalities, and the best-known example is pollution. We can 
think of the problem of pollution as a problem of incomplete property rights; for 
example, existing property rights don’t guarantee a right to ownership of clean 
air. We’ll see in Chapter 16 that pollution and other externalities also give rise 
to inefficiency.
Third, markets for some goods fail because these goods, by their very nature, are 
unsuited for efficient management by markets. In Chapter 20, we will analyze goods 
that fall into this category because of problems of private information—information 
about a good that some people possess but others don’t. For example, the seller of a 
used car that is a “lemon” may have information that is unknown to potential buyers. 
In Chapter 17, we will encounter other types of goods that fall into the cat-
egory of being unsuited for efficient management by markets—public goods, com-
mon resources, and artificially scarce goods. Markets for these goods fail because 
of problems in limiting people’s access to and consumption of the good; examples 
are fish in the sea and trees in the Amazonian rain forest. In these instances, 
markets generally fail due to incomplete property rights.
But even with these caveats, it’s remarkable how well markets work at maxi-
mizing the gains from trade.
A market or an economy is 
inefficient if there are missed 
opportunities: some people could be 
made better off without making other 
people worse off.
Market failure occurs when a 
market fails to be efficient.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
A GREAT LEAP—BACKWARD
E
conomies in which a central planner, rather than markets, 
makes consumption and production decisions are known 
as planned economies. Russia (formerly part of the U.S.S.R.), 
many Eastern European countries, and several Southeast 
Asian countries once had planned economies, and countries 
such as India and Brazil once had significant parts of their 
economies under central planning. China still does today.
Planned economies are notorious for their inefficiency, 
and what is probably the most compelling example of that 
is the so-called Great Leap Forward, an ambitious economic 
plan instituted in China during the late 1950s by its leader 
Mao Zedong. Its intention was to speed up the country’s 
industrialization. Key to this plan was a shift from urban to 
rural manufacturing: farming villages were supposed to start 
producing heavy industrial goods such as steel.
Unfortunately, the plan backfired. Diverting farmers from 
their usual work led to a sharp fall in food production. Meanwhile, 
because raw materials for steel, such as coal and iron ore, were 
sent to ill-equipped and inexperienced rural producers rather 
than to urban factories, industrial output declined as well. The 
plan, in short, led to a fall in the production of everything in 
China.
Because China was a very poor country to start with, the 
results were catastrophic. The famine that followed is estimated 
to have reduced China’s population by as much as 30 million. 
China has recently moved closer to a free-market system, allowing for greater 
economic growth, increased wealth, and the emergence of a middle class. But 
some aspects of central planning remain, largely in the allocation of financial 
capital and other inputs to politically connected businesses. As a result, signifi-
cant inefficiencies persist. Many economists have commented that these ineffi-
ciencies must be addressed if China is to sustain its rapid growth and Chinese 
consumers are to enjoy the efficient level of consumer surplus.

1. In some states that are rich in natural resources, such as oil, the law separates the right 
to above-ground use of the land from the right to drill below ground (called “mineral 
rights”). Someone who owns both the above-ground rights and the mineral rights can 
sell the two rights separately. Explain how this division of the property rights enhances 
efficiency compared to a situation in which the two rights must always be sold together.
2. Suppose that in the market for used textbooks the equilibrium price is $30, but it is mis-
takenly announced that the equilibrium price is $300. How does this affect the efficiency 
of the market? Be specific.
3. What is wrong with the following statement? “Markets are always the best way to orga-
nize economic activity. Any policies that interfere with markets reduce society’s welfare.”
Solutions appear at back of book.
• In a market economy, markets are 
interrelated. When each and every 
market in an economy is efficient, 
the economy as a whole is efficient. 
But in the real world, some markets 
in a market economy will almost 
certainly fail to be efficient.
• A system of property rights and 
the operation of prices as economic 
signals are two key factors that 
enable a market to be efficient. But 
under conditions in which property 
rights are incomplete or prices give 
inaccurate economic signals, mar-
kets can fail.
• Under certain conditions, market 
failure occurs and the market is 
inefficient: gains from trade are 
unrealized. The three principal 
ways in which markets fail are the 
prevention of mutually beneficial 
transactions caused by one party’s 
attempt to capture more surplus, 
side effects that aren’t properly 
accounted for, and problems in the 
nature of the goods themselves.
 Quick Review
Although some aspects of central planning remain, China’s
economy has moved closer to a free-market system, allowing 
for higher economic growth, increased wealth, and the emer-
gence of a middle class.

Back in 1965, long before Ticketmaster, StubHub, and TicketsNow, legendary 
rock music promoter Bill Graham noticed that mass parties erupted wherever 
local rock groups played. Graham realized that fans would pay for the experience 
of the concert, in addition to paying for a recording of the music. He went on to 
create the business of rock concert promoting—booking and managing multicity 
tours for bands and selling lots of tickets. Those tickets were carefully rationed, a 
single purchaser allowed to buy only a limited number. Fans would line up at box 
offices, sometimes camping out the night before for popular bands. 
Wanting to maintain the aura of the 1960s that made rock concerts accessible 
to all their fans, many top bands choose to price their tickets below the market 
equilibrium level. For example, in 2009 Bruce Springsteen sold tickets at his 
concerts in New Jersey (his home state and home to his most ardent fans) for 
between $65 and $95. Tickets for Springsteen concerts could have sold for far 
more: economists Alan Krueger and Marie Connolly analyzed a 2002 Springsteen 
concert for which every ticket sold for $75 and concluded that The Boss forfeited 
about $4 million by not charging the market price, about $280.
So what was The Boss thinking? Cheap tickets can ensure that a concert sells 
out, making it a better experience for both band and audience. But it is believed 
that other factors are at work—that cheap tickets are a way for a band to reward 
fans’ loyalty as well as a means to seem more “authentic” and less commercial. As 
Bruce Springsteen has said, “In some fashion, I help people hold on to their own 
humanity—if I’m doing my job right.”
But the rise of the Internet has made things vastly more complicated. Now, 
rather than queue for tickets at the venue, fans buy tickets online, either from a 
direct seller like Ticketmaster (which obtains tickets directly from the concert 
producer) or a reseller like StubHub or TicketsNow. Resellers (otherwise known 
as scalpers) can—and do—make lots of money by scooping up large numbers of 
tickets at the box office price and reselling them at the market price. StubHub, for 
example, made $1 billion in the resale market for tickets in 2010.  
This practice has infuriated fans as well as the bands. But resellers have cast 
the issue as one of the freedom to dispose of one’s ticket as one chooses. In 2011, 
both sides—bands and their fans versus ticket resellers—are busily lobbying gov-
ernment officials to shape ticket-reselling laws to their advantage. 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Use the concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus to analyze the exchange 
between The Boss and his fans. Draw a diagram to illustrate.
 2. Explain how the rise of the Internet has disrupted this exchange.  
 3. Draw a diagram to show the effect of resellers on the allocation of consumer surplus and 
producer surplus in the market for concert tickets. What are the implications of the Internet 
for all such exchanges?

SUMMARY
 1. The willingness to pay of each individual consumer 
determines the demand curve. When price is less than 
or equal to the willingness to pay, the potential con-
sumer purchases the good. The difference between 
willingness to pay and price is the net gain to the con-
sumer, the individual consumer surplus.
 2. Total consumer surplus in a market, the sum of all 
individual consumer surpluses in a market, is equal to 
the area below the market demand curve but above the 
price. A rise in the price of a good reduces consumer 
surplus; a fall in the price increases consumer surplus. 
The term consumer surplus is often used to refer to 
both individual and total consumer surplus.
 3. The cost of each potential producer, the lowest price at 
which he or she is willing to supply a unit of a particu-
lar good, determines the supply curve. If the price of a 
good is above a producer’s cost, a sale generates a net 
gain to the producer, known as the individual pro-
ducer surplus.
 4. Total producer surplus in a market, the sum of the 
individual producer surpluses in a market, is equal to 
the area above the market supply curve but below the 
price. A rise in the price of a good increases producer 
surplus; a fall in the price reduces producer surplus. 
The term producer surplus is often used to refer to 
both individual and total producer surplus.
 5. Total surplus, the total gain to society from the pro-
duction and consumption of a good, is the sum of con-
sumer and producer surplus.
 6. Usually markets are efficient and achieve the maxi-
mum total surplus. Any possible reallocation of con-
sumption or sales, or a change in the quantity bought 
and sold, reduces total surplus. However, society also 
cares about equity. So government intervention in a 
market that reduces efficiency but increases equity can 
be a valid choice by society.
 7. An economy composed of efficient markets is also effi-
cient, although this is virtually impossible to achieve in 
reality. The keys to the efficiency of a market economy 
are property rights and the operation of prices as 
economic signals. Under certain conditions, market 
failure occurs, making a market inefficient. Three 
principal sources of market failure are attempts to cap-
ture more surplus that create inefficiencies, side effects 
of some transactions, and problems in the nature of 
the good.

PROBLEMS
 1. Determine the amount of consumer surplus generated 
in each of the following situations.
a. Leon goes to the clothing store to buy a new T-shirt, 
for which he is willing to pay up to $10. He picks out 
one he likes with a price tag of exactly $10. When he 
is paying for it, he learns that the T-shirt has been 
discounted by 50%.
b. Alberto goes to the CD store hoping to find a used 
copy of Nirvana’s Greatest Hits for up to $10. The store 
has one copy selling for $10, which he purchases.
c. After soccer practice, Stacey is willing to pay $2 for 
a bottle of mineral water. The 7-Eleven sells mineral 
water for $2.25 per bottle, so she declines to purchase it.
 2. Determine the amount of producer surplus generated in 
each of the following situations.
a. Gordon lists his old Lionel electric trains on eBay. 
He sets a minimum acceptable price, known as his 
reserve price, of $75. After five days of bidding, the 
final high bid is exactly $75. He accepts the bid.
b. So-Hee advertises her car for sale in the used-car 
section of the student newspaper for $2,000, but she 
is willing to sell the car for any price higher than 
$1,500. The best offer she gets is $1,200, which she 
declines.
c. Sanjay likes his job so much that he would be willing 
to do it for free. However, his annual salary is $80,000.
 3. There are six potential consumers of computer games, 
each willing to buy only one game. Consumer 1 is will-
ing to pay $40 for a computer game, consumer 2 is 
willing to pay $35, consumer 3 is willing to pay $30, 
consumer 4 is willing to pay $25, consumer 5 is willing 
to pay $20, and consumer 6 is willing to pay $15.
a. Suppose the market price is $29. What is the total 
consumer surplus?

C H A P T E R  4    C O N S U M E R  A N D  P RO D U C E R  S U R P LU S    125
b. The market price decreases to $19. What is the total 
consumer surplus now?
c. When the price falls from $29 to $19, how much 
does each consumer’s individual consumer surplus 
change? How does total consumer surplus change?
 4. a.  In an auction, potential buyers compete for a good by 
submitting bids. Adam Galinsky, a social psychologist 
at Northwestern University, compared eBay auctions 
in which the same good was sold. He found that, 
on average, the larger the number of bidders, the 
higher the sales price. For example, in two auctions 
of identical iPods, the one with the larger number of 
bidders brought a higher selling price. According to 
Galinsky, this explains why smart sellers on eBay set 
absurdly low opening prices (the lowest price that the 
seller will accept), such as 1 cent for a new iPod. Use 
the concepts of consumer and producer surplus to 
explain Galinsky’s reasoning.
b. You are considering selling your vintage 1969 con-
vertible Volkswagen Beetle. If the car is in good 
condition, it is worth a lot; if it is in poor condition, 
it is useful only as scrap. Assume that your car is in 
excellent condition but that it costs a potential buyer 
$500 for an inspection to learn the car’s condition. 
Use what you learned in part a to explain whether or 
not you should pay for an inspection and share the 
results with all interested buyers.
 5. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 
due to an increase in demand, the average domestic 
airline fare increased from $319.85 in the fourth quar-
ter of 2009 to $328.12 in the first quarter of 2010, an 
increase of $8.27. The number of passenger tickets sold 
in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 151.4 million. Over 
the same period, the airlines’ costs remained roughly 
the same: the price of jet fuel averaged around $2 per 
gallon in both quarters (Source: Energy Information 
Administration), and airline pilots’ salaries remained 
roughly the same (according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, they averaged $117,060 per year in 2009).
 Can you determine precisely by how much producer 
surplus has increased as a result of the $8.27 increase 
in the average fare? If you cannot be precise, can you 
determine whether it will be less than, or more than, a 
specific amount?
 6. Hollywood screenwriters negotiate a new agreement 
with movie producers stipulating that they will receive 
10% of the revenue from every video rental of a movie 
they authored. They have no such agreement for movies 
shown on on-demand television.
a. When the new writers’ agreement comes into effect, 
what will happen in the market for video rentals—
that is, will supply or demand shift, and how? As a 
result, how will consumer surplus in the market for 
video rentals change? Illustrate with a diagram. Do 
you think the writers’ agreement will be popular 
with consumers who rent videos?
b. Consumers consider video rentals and on-demand 
movies substitutable to some extent. When the new 
writers’ agreement comes into effect, what will hap-
pen in the market for on-demand movies—that 
is, will supply or demand shift, and how? As a 
result, how will producer surplus in the market for 
on-demand movies change? Illustrate with a dia-
gram. Do you think the writers’ agreement will be 
popular with cable television companies that show 
on-demand movies?

the city could extract from this taxi driver?
c. Suppose that the city allowed the price of taxi rides 
to increase to $8 per ride. Again assume that, at 
this price, the taxi driver sells as many rides as 
he is willing to offer. How much producer surplus

taxi driver?
 11. On May 10, 2010, a New York district judge ruled in a 
copyright infringement lawsuit against the popular file-
sharing website LimeWire and in favor of the 13 major 
record companies that had brought the lawsuit. The 
record companies, including Sony, Virgin, and Warner 
Brothers, had alleged that the file-sharing service 
encourages users to make illegal copies of copyrighted 
material. Allowing Internet users to obtain music for 
free limits the record companies’ right to dispose of the 
music as they choose; in particular, it limits their right 
to give access to their music only to those who have paid 
for it. In other words, it limits the record companies’ 
property rights. 
a. If everyone obtained music and video content for 
free from websites such as LimeWire, instead of 
paying the record companies, what would the record 
companies’ producer surplus be from music sales? 
What are the implications for record companies’ 
incentive to produce music content in the future?
b. If the record companies had lost the lawsuit and 
music could be freely downloaded from the Internet, 
what do you think would happen to mutually ben-
eficial transactions (the producing and buying of 
music) in the future?

N
EW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE 
you can find almost anything—
that is, almost anything, except a taxi-
cab when you need one or a decent 
apartment at a rent you can afford. You 
might think that New York’s notorious 
shortages of cabs and apartments are 
the inevitable price of big-city living. 
However, they are largely the product 
of government policies—specifically, of 
government policies that have, one way 
or another, tried to prevail over the mar-
ket forces of supply and demand.
In Chapter 3, we learned the principle 
that a market moves to equilibrium—
that the market price rises or falls to the 
level at which the quantity of a good that 
people are willing to supply is equal to 
the quantity that other people demand.
But sometimes governments try to 
defy that principle. Whenever a govern-
ment tries to dictate either a market 
price or a market quantity that’s differ-
ent from the equilibrium price or quanti-
ty, the market strikes back in predictable 
ways. Our ability to predict what will 
happen when governments try to defy 
supply and demand shows the power 
and usefulness of supply and demand 
analysis itself.
The shortages of apartments and 
taxicabs in New York are particular 
examples that illuminate what happens 
when the logic of the market is defied. 
New York’s housing shortage is the 
result of rent control, a law that prevents 
landlords from raising rents except when 
specifically given permission. Rent con-
trol was introduced during World War 
II to protect the interests of tenants, 
and it still remains in force. Many other 
American cities have had rent control 
at one time or another, but with the 
notable exceptions of New York and San 
Francisco, these controls have largely 
been done away with. 
Similarly, New York’s limited supply 
of taxis is the result of a licensing system 
introduced in the 1930s. New York taxi 
licenses are known as “medallions,” and 
only taxis with medallions are allowed to 
pick up passengers. Although this sys-
tem was originally intended to protect 
the interests of both drivers and custom-
ers, it has generated a shortage of taxis 
in the city. The number of medallions 
remained fixed for nearly 60 years, with 
no significant increase until 2004.
In this chapter, we begin by examin-
ing what happens when governments try 
to control prices in a competitive market, 
keeping the price in a market either 
below its equilibrium level—a price 
ceiling such as rent control—or above 
it—a price floor such as the minimum 
wage paid to workers in many countries. 
We then turn to schemes such as taxi 
medallions that attempt to dictate the 
quantity of a good bought and sold.

Why Governments Control Prices
Y
ou learned in Chapter 3 that a market moves to equilibrium—that is, 
the market price moves to the level at which the quantity supplied equals 
the quantity demanded. But this equilibrium price does not necessarily 
please either buyers or sellers.
After all, buyers would always like to pay less if they could, and sometimes 
they can make a strong moral or political case that they should pay lower prices. 
For example, what if the equilibrium between supply and demand for apartments 
in a major city leads to rental rates that an average working person can’t afford? 
In that case, a government might well be under pressure to impose limits on the 
rents landlords can charge.
Sellers, however, would always like to get more money for what they sell, and 
sometimes they can make a strong moral or political case that they should receive 
higher prices. For example, consider the labor market: the price for an hour of 
a worker’s time is the wage rate. What if the equilibrium between supply and 
demand for less skilled workers leads to wage rates that yield an income below 
the poverty level? In that case, a government might well be pressured to require 
employers to pay a rate no lower than some specified minimum wage.
In other words, there is often a strong political demand for governments to 
intervene in markets. And powerful interests can make a compelling case that a 
market intervention favoring them is “fair.” When a government intervenes to reg-
ulate prices, we say that it imposes price controls. These controls typically take 
the form either of an upper limit, a price ceiling, or a lower limit, a price floor.
Unfortunately, it’s not that easy to tell a market what to do. As we will now 
see, when a government tries to legislate prices—whether it legislates them down 
by imposing a price ceiling or up by imposing a price floor—there are certain 
predictable and unpleasant side effects.
We make an important assumption in this chapter: the markets in ques-
tion are efficient before price controls are imposed. As we noted in Chapter 4, 
markets can sometimes be inefficient—for example, a market dominated by a 
monopolist, a single seller that has the power to influence the market price. 
When markets are inefficient, price controls don’t necessarily cause problems 
and can potentially move the market closer to efficiency. In practice, however, 
price controls are often imposed on efficient markets—like the New York apart-
ment market. And so the analysis in this chapter applies to many important 
real-world situations.
Price Ceilings
A
side from rent control, there are not many price ceilings in the United 
States today. But at times they have been widespread. Price ceilings 
are typically imposed during crises—wars, harvest failures, natural 
disasters—because these events often lead to sudden price increases that 
hurt many people but produce big gains for a lucky few. The U.S. govern-
ment imposed ceilings on many prices during World War II: the war sharply 
increased demand for raw materials, such as aluminum and steel, and price 
controls prevented those with access to these raw materials from earning 
huge profits. Price controls on oil were imposed in 1973, when an embargo by 
Arab oil-exporting countries seemed likely to generate huge profits for U.S. oil 
companies. Price controls were imposed on California’s wholesale electricity 
market in 2001, when a shortage created big profits for a few power-generating 
companies but led to higher electricity bills for consumers.
Rent control in New York is, believe it or not, a legacy of World War II: it 
was imposed because wartime production produced an economic boom, which 
Price controls are legal restrictions 
on how high or low a market price 
may go. They can take two forms: 
a price ceiling, a maximum price 
sellers are allowed to charge for a 
good or service, or a price floor, a 
minimum price buyers are required to 
pay for a good or service.

increased demand for apartments at a time when the labor and raw materials 
that might have been used to build them were being used to win the war instead. 
Although most price controls were removed soon after the war ended, New York’s 
rent limits were retained and gradually extended to buildings not previously cov-
ered, leading to some very strange situations.
You can rent a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan on fairly short notice—
if you are able and willing to pay several thousand dollars a month and live in 
a less-than-desirable area. Yet some people pay only a small fraction of this for 
comparable apartments, and others pay hardly more for bigger apartments in 
better locations.
Aside from producing great deals for some renters, however, what are 
the broader consequences of New York’s rent-control system? To answer this 
question, we turn to the model we developed in Chapter 3: the supply and 
demand model.
Modeling a Price Ceiling
To see what can go wrong when a government imposes a price ceiling on an 
efficient market, consider Figure 5-1, which shows a simplified model of the 
market for apartments in New York. For the sake of simplicity, we imagine that 
all apartments are exactly the same and so would rent for the same price in 
an unregulated market. The table in the figure shows the demand and supply 
schedules; the demand and supply curves are shown on the left. We show the 
quantity of apartments on the horizontal axis and the monthly rent per apart-
ment on the vertical axis. You can see that in an unregulated market the equi-
librium would be at point E: 2 million apartments would be rented for $1,000 
each per month.
Now suppose that the government imposes a price ceiling, limiting rents to a 
price below the equilibrium price—say, no more than $800.

Figure 5-2 shows the effect of the price ceiling, represented by the line at $800. 
At the enforced rental rate of $800, landlords have less incentive to offer apart-
ments, so they won’t be willing to supply as many as they would at the equilibrium 
rate of $1,000. They will choose point A on the supply curve, offering only 1.8 mil-
lion apartments for rent, 200,000 fewer than in the unregulated market. At the 
same time, more people will want to rent apartments at a price of $800 than at the 
equilibrium price of $1,000; as shown at point B on the demand curve, at a month-
ly rent of $800 the quantity of apartments demanded rises to 2.2 million, 200,000 
more than in the unregulated market and 400,000 more than are actually avail-
able at the price of $800. So there is now a persistent shortage of rental housing: 
at that price, 400,000 more people want to rent than are able to find apartments.
Do price ceilings always cause shortages? No. If a price ceiling is set above the 
equilibrium price, it won’t have any effect. Suppose that the equilibrium rental 
rate on apartments is $1,000 per month and the city government sets a ceiling of 
$1,200. Who cares? In this case, the price ceiling won’t be binding—it won’t actu-
ally constrain market behavior—and it will have no effect.
How a Price Ceiling Causes Inefficiency
The housing shortage shown in Figure 5-2 is not merely annoying: like any short-
age induced by price controls, it can be seriously harmful because it leads to 
inefficiency. In other words, there are gains from trade that go unrealized. Rent 
control, like all price ceilings, creates inefficiency in at least four distinct ways. 
It reduces the quantity of apartments rented below the efficient level; it typically 
leads to misallocation of apartments among would-be renters; it leads to wasted 
time and effort as people search for apartments; and it leads landlords to main-
tain apartments in inefficiently low quality or condition. In addition to inefficien-
cy, price ceilings give rise to illegal behavior as people try to circumvent them.
Inefficiently Low Quantity In Chapter 4 we learned that the market 
equilibrium of an efficient market leads to the “right” quantity of a good 
or service being bought and sold—that is, the quantity that maximizes the

The black horizontal line repre-
sents the government-imposed 
price ceiling on rents of $800 per 
month. This price ceiling reduces 
the quantity of apartments sup-
plied to 1.8 million, point A, and 
increases the quantity demanded 
to 2.2 million, point B. This creates 
a persistent shortage of 400,000 
units: 400,000 people who want 
apartments at the legal rent of 
$800 but cannot get them.

sum of producer and consumer surplus. Because rent controls reduce the 
number of apartments supplied, they reduce the number of apartments 
rented, too. 
Figure 5-3 shows the implications for total surplus. Recall that total surplus 
is the sum of the area above the supply curve and below the demand curve. If 
the only effect of rent control was to reduce the number of apartments available, 
it would cause a loss of surplus equal to the area of the shaded triangle in the 
figure. The area represented by that triangle has a special name in economics, 
deadweight loss: the lost surplus associated with the transactions that no long-
er occur due to the market intervention. In this example, the deadweight loss is 
the lost surplus associated with the apartment rentals that no longer occur due 
to the price ceiling, a loss that is experienced by both disappointed renters and 
frustrated landlords. Economists often call triangles like the one in Figure 5-3 a 
deadweight-loss triangle.
Deadweight loss is a key concept in economics, one that we will encounter 
whenever an action or a policy leads to a reduction in the quantity transacted 
below the efficient market equilibrium quantity. It is important to realize 
that deadweight loss is a loss to society—it is a reduction in total surplus, a 
loss in surplus that accrues to no one as a gain. It is not the same as a loss 
in surplus to one person that then accrues as a gain to someone else, what 
an economist would call a transfer of surplus from one person to another. 
For an example of how a price ceiling can create deadweight loss as well as 
a transfer of surplus between renters and landlords, see the upcoming For 
Inquiring Minds.
Deadweight loss is not the only type of inefficiency that arises from a price 
ceiling. The types of inefficiency created by rent control go beyond reducing the 
quantity of apartments available. These additional inefficiencies—inefficient 
allocation to consumers, wasted resources, and inefficiently low quality—lead to 
a loss of surplus over and above the deadweight loss.
A Price Ceiling Causes Inefficiently Low Quantity
5-3
A price ceiling reduces the quan-
tity supplied below the market 
equilibrium quantity, leading to a 
deadweight loss. The area of the 
shaded triangle corresponds to 
the amount of total surplus lost 
due to the inefficiently low quantity 
transacted.

Price controls create winners and losers: 
some people benefit from the policy but 
others are made worse off.
In New York City, some of the biggest 
beneficiaries of rent control are affluent 
tenants who have lived for decades in 
choice apartments that would now com-
mand very high rents. These winners 
include celebrities like actor Al Pacino 
and the pop singer Cyndi Lauper; 
Lauper pays only $989 a month for an 
apartment that would be worth $3,750 
if unregulated. There is also the classic 
case of the actress Mia Farrow’s apart-
ment, which, when it lost its rent-control 
status, rose from the bargain rate of 
$2,900 per month to $8,000. Ironically, 
in cases like these, the losers are the 
working-class renters the system was 
intended to help.
We can use the concepts of con-
sumer and producer surplus, which you 
learned about in Chapter 4, to graphi-
cally evaluate the winners and the losers 
from rent control. Panel (a) of Figure 5-4 
shows the consumer surplus and pro-
ducer surplus in the equilibrium of the 
unregulated market for apartments—
before rent control. Recall that the con-
sumer surplus, represented by the area 
below the demand curve and above the 
price, is the total net gain to consumers 
in the market equilibrium. Likewise, pro-
ducer surplus, represented by the area 
above the supply curve and below the 
price, is the total net gain to producers 
in the market equilibrium.
Panel (b) of this figure shows the 
consumer and producer surplus in the 
market after the price ceiling of $800 
has been imposed. As you can see, for 
consumers who can still obtain apart-
ments under rent control, consumer 
surplus has increased. These renters are 
clearly winners: they obtain an apartment 
at $800, paying $200 less than the 
unregulated market price. These people 
receive a direct transfer of surplus from 
landlords in the form of lower rent. But 
not all renters win: there are fewer apart-
ments to rent now than if the market had 
remained unregulated, making it hard, if 
not impossible, for some to find a place 
to call home. 
Without direct calculation of the sur-
pluses gained and lost, it is generally 
unclear whether renters as a whole are 
made better or worse off by rent control. 
What we can say is that the greater 
the deadweight loss—the larger the 
reduction in the quantity of apartments 
rented—the more likely it is that renters 
as a whole lose.
However, we can say unambigu-
ously that landlords are worse off: pro-
ducer surplus has clearly decreased. 
Landlords who continue to rent out 
their apartments get $200 a month 
less in rent, and others withdraw their 
apartments from the market altogether. 
The deadweight-loss triangle, shaded 
yellow in panel (b), represents the value 
lost to both renters and landlords from 
rentals that essentially vanish thanks to 
rent control.

Inefficient Allocation to Consumers Rent control doesn’t just lead to too few 
apartments being available. It can also lead to misallocation of the apartments 
that are available: people who badly need a place to live may not be able to find 
an apartment, but some apartments may be occupied by people with much less 
urgent needs.
In the case shown in Figure 5-2, 2.2 million people would like to rent an apart-
ment at $800 per month, but only 1.8 million apartments are available. Of those 
2.2 million who are seeking an apartment, some want an apartment badly and 
are willing to pay a high price to get one. Others have a less urgent need and are 
only willing to pay a low price, perhaps because they have alternative housing. 
An efficient allocation of apartments would reflect these differences: people who 
really want an apartment will get one and people who aren’t all that anxious to 
find an apartment won’t. In an inefficient distribution of apartments, the opposite 
will happen: some people who are not especially anxious to find an apartment 
will get one and others who are very anxious to find an apartment won’t. 
Because people usually get apartments through luck or personal connections 
under rent control, it generally results in an inefficient allocation to consum-
ers of the few apartments available.
To see the inefficiency involved, consider the plight of the Lees, a family with 
young children who have no alternative housing and would be willing to pay up 
to $1,500 for an apartment—but are unable to find one. Also consider George, 
a retiree who lives most of the year in Florida but still has a lease on the New 
York apartment he moved into 40 years ago. George pays $800 per month for this 
apartment, but if the rent were even slightly more—say, $850—he would give it 
up and stay with his children when he is in New York.
This allocation of apartments—George has one and the Lees do not—is a 
missed opportunity: there is a way to make the Lees and George both better off 
at no additional cost. The Lees would be happy to pay George, say, $1,200 a month 
to sublease his apartment, which he would happily accept since the apartment is 
worth no more than $849 a month to him. George would prefer the money he gets 
from the Lees to keeping his apartment; the Lees would prefer to have the apart-
ment rather than the money. So both would be made better off by this transac-
tion—and nobody else would be made worse off.
Generally, if people who really want apartments could sublease them from 
people who are less eager to live there, both those who gain apartments and those 
who trade their occupancy for money would be better off. However, subletting is 
illegal under rent control because it would occur at prices above the price ceiling. 
The fact that subletting is illegal doesn’t mean it never happens. In fact, chas-
ing down illegal subletting is a major business for New York private investigators. 
An article in the New York Times described how private investigators use hidden 
cameras and other tricks to prove that the legal tenants in rent-controlled apart-
ments actually live in the suburbs, or even in other states, and have sublet their 
apartments at two or three times the controlled rent. This subletting is a kind of 
illegal activity, which we will discuss shortly. For now, just note that landlords 
and legal agencies actively discourage the practice of illegal subletting. As a 
result, the problem of inefficient allocation of apartments remains.
Wasted Resources Another reason a price ceiling causes inefficiency is that it 
leads to wasted resources: people expend money, effort, and time to cope with 
the shortages caused by the price ceiling. Back in 1979, U.S. price controls on 
gasoline led to shortages that forced millions of Americans to spend hours each 
week waiting in lines at gas stations. The opportunity cost of the time spent in gas 
lines—the wages not earned, the leisure time not enjoyed—constituted wasted 
resources from the point of view of consumers and of the economy as a whole. 
Because of rent control, the Lees will spend all their spare time for several 
months searching for an apartment, time they would rather have spent working 
Price ceilings often lead to 
inefficiency in the form of inefficient 
allocation to consumers: some 
people who want the good badly and 
are willing to pay a high price don’t 
get it, and some who care relatively 
little about the good and are only 
willing to pay a low price do get it.
Price ceilings typically lead to 
inefficiency in the form of wasted 
resources: people expend money, 
effort, and time to cope with the 
shortages caused by the price 
ceiling.

134    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
or in family activities. That is, there is an opportunity cost to the Lees’ pro-
longed search for an apartment—the leisure or income they had to forgo. If the 
market for apartments worked freely, the Lees would quickly find an apartment 
at the equilibrium rent of $1,000, leaving them time to earn more or to enjoy 
themselves—an outcome that would make them better off without making any-
one else worse off. Again, rent control creates missed opportunities.
Inefficiently Low Quality Yet another way a price ceiling creates ineffi-
ciency is by causing goods to be of inefficiently low quality. Inefficiently low 
quality means that sellers offer low-quality goods at a low price even though 
buyers would rather have higher quality and would be willing to pay a higher 
price for it.
Again, consider rent control. Landlords have no incentive to provide better 
conditions because they cannot raise rents to cover their repair costs but are able 
to find tenants easily. In many cases, tenants would be willing to pay much more 
for improved conditions than it would cost for the landlord to provide them—for 
example, the upgrade of an antiquated electrical system that cannot safely run 
air conditioners or computers. But any additional payment for such improve-
ments would be legally considered a rent increase, which is prohibited. Indeed, 
rent-controlled apartments are notoriously badly maintained, rarely painted, 
subject to frequent electrical and plumbing problems, sometimes even hazard-
ous to inhabit. As one former manager of Manhattan buildings described: “At 
unregulated apartments we’d do most things that the tenants requested. But on 
the rent-regulated units, we did absolutely only what the law required. . . . We had 
a perverse incentive to make those tenants unhappy.”
This whole situation is a missed opportunity—some tenants would be happy 
to pay for better conditions, and landlords would be happy to provide them for 
payment. But such an exchange would occur only if the market were allowed to 
operate freely.
Black Markets And that leads us to a last aspect of price ceilings: the incentive 
they provide for illegal activities, specifically the emergence of black markets. We 
have already described one kind of black market activity—illegal subletting by ten-
ants. But it does not stop there. Clearly, there is a temptation for a landlord to say 
How far would you go to keep a rent-
controlled apartment? Some tenants 
in the city of Mumbai, India, went very 
far indeed. According to a Wall Street 
Journal article, three people were killed 
when four floors in a rent-controlled 
apartment building in Mumbai col-
lapsed. Despite demands by the city 
government to vacate the deteriorated 
building, 58 other tenants refused to 
leave. They stayed put even after having 
their electricity and water shut off, being 
locked out of their apartments, and sur-
viving a police raid. Tenants camped out 
on the building’s veranda, vowing not to 
give up.
Not all of these tenants were desper-
ately poor and lacking other options. 
One rent-controlled tenant, the owner 
of a thriving textile business, paid a total 
of $8.50 a month for a spacious two-
bedroom apartment. (Luxury apartments 
in Mumbai can go for thousands of dol-
lars a month.)
Although it’s a world away, the dynam-
ics of rent control in Mumbai are a lot like 
those in New York (although Mumbai has 
clearly had a much more extreme experi-
ence). Rent control began in Mumbai in 
1947, to address a critical shortage of 
housing caused by a flood of refugees 
fleeing conflict between Hindus and 
Muslims. Clearly intended to be a tempo-
rary measure, it was so popular politically 
that it has been extended 20 times and 
now applies to about 60% of the build-
ings in the city’s center. Tenants pass 
apartments on to their heirs or sell the 
right to occupy to other tenants. 
Despite the fact that home prices 
in Mumbai surged more than 60% 
between 2007 and 2010, landlords of 
rent-controlled buildings have suffered 
financially, with the result that across the 
city prime buildings have been aban-
doned to decay, even though half of the 
city’s 12 million residents live in slums 
because of a lack of new housing.
FOR INQUIRING MINDS
RENT CONTROL, MUMBAI STYLE
F
Price ceilings often lead to 
inefficiency in that the goods being 
offered are of inefficiently low 
quality: sellers offer low-quality 
goods at a low price even though 
buyers would prefer a higher quality 
at a higher price.
A black market is a market in which 
goods or services are bought and 
sold illegally—either because it is 
illegal to sell them at all or because 
the prices charged are legally 
prohibited by a price ceiling.

C H A P T E R  5    PR I C E C O N T R O L S A N D  Q U OTA S: M E D D L I N G W I T H  M A R K E T S    135
to a potential tenant, “Look, you can have the place if you slip me an extra few hun-
dred in cash each month”—and for the tenant to agree if he or she is one of those 
people who would be willing to pay much more than the maximum legal rent.
What’s wrong with black markets? In general, it’s a bad thing if people break 
any law, because it encourages disrespect for the law in general. Worse yet, in 
this case illegal activity worsens the position of those who are honest. If the Lees 
are scrupulous about upholding the rent-control law but other people—who may 
need an apartment less than the Lees—are willing to bribe landlords, the Lees 
may never find an apartment.
So Why Are There Price Ceilings?
We have seen three common results of price ceilings:
 • A persistent shortage of the good
 • Inefficiency arising from this persistent shortage in the form of inefficiently 
low quantity (deadweight loss), inefficient allocation of the good to consumers, 
resources wasted in searching for the good, and the inefficiently low quality 
of the good offered for sale
 • The emergence of illegal, black market activity
Given these unpleasant consequences, why do governments still sometimes 
impose price ceilings? Why does rent control, in particular, persist in New York?
One answer is that although price ceilings may have adverse effects, they do 
benefit some people. In practice, New York’s rent-control rules—which are more 
complex than our simple model—hurt most residents but give a small minority 
of renters much cheaper housing than they would get in an unregulated market. 
And those who benefit from the controls are typically better organized and more 
vocal than those who are harmed by them.
Also, when price ceilings have been in effect for a long time, buyers may 
not have a realistic idea of what would happen without them. In our previous 
example, the rental rate in an unregulated market (Figure 5-1) would be only 
25% higher than in the regulated market (Figure 5-2): $1,000 instead of $800. But 
how would renters know that? Indeed, they might have heard about black market 
transactions at much higher prices—the Lees or some other family paying George 
$1,200 or more—and would not realize that these black market prices are much 
higher than the price that would prevail in a fully unregulated market.
A last answer is that government officials often do not understand supply and 
demand analysis! It is a great mistake to suppose that economic policies in the 
real world are always sensible or well informed.

HUNGER AND PRICE CONTROLS 
IN VENEZUELA
S
omething was rotten in the state of Venezuela—specifically, 30,000 tons 
of decomposing food in Puerto Cabello in June 2010. The discovery was 
particularly embarrassing for then President Hugo Chávez. He was elected 
in 1998 on a platform denouncing the country’s economic elite and promis-
ing policies favoring the poor and working classes. Among those policies 
were price controls on basic foodstuffs, which led to shortages that began 
in 2003 and had become severe by 2006.
Generous government policies led to higher spending by consumers 
and sharply rising prices for goods that weren’t subject to price controls or 
which were bought on the black market. The result was a big increase in 
the demand for price-controlled goods. But a sharp decline in the value of 
Venezuela’s food shortages offer a lesson in
why price ceilings, however well intentioned, are
usually never a good idea.

Venezuela’s currency led to a fall in imports of foreign food, and the result was 
empty shelves in the nation’s food stores. 
As the shortages persisted and inflation of food prices worsened (in the first 
five months of 2010, the prices of food and drink rose by 21%), Chávez declared 
“economic war” on the private sector, berating it for “hoarding and smuggling.” The 
government expropriated farms, food manufacturers and grocery stores, creating 
in their place government-owned ones, which were corrupt and inefficient—it was 
the government-owned food-distribution company, PDVAL, that left tens of thou-
sands of tons of food to rot in Venezuelan ports. Food production has also fallen, 
and Venezuela must now import 70% of its food. 
Not surprisingly, the shelves have been far more bare in government-run 
grocery stores than in those still in private hands. The food shortages have been 
so severe that they have greatly diminished Chávez’s popularity among working-
class Venezuelans and halted his expropriation plans. As an old Venezuelan say-
ing has it, “Love with hunger doesn’t last.”

• Price controls take the form of 
either legal maximum prices—
price ceilings—or legal minimum 
prices—price floors.
• A price ceiling below the equilibrium 
price benefits successful buyers but 
causes predictable adverse effects 
such as persistent shortages, which 
lead to four types of inefficiencies: 
deadweight loss, inefficient alloca-
tion to consumers, wasted resources, 
and inefficiently low quality.
• A deadweight loss is a loss of total 
surplus that occurs whenever a 
policy or action reduces the quan-
tity transacted below the efficient 
market equilibrium level.
• Price ceilings also lead to black 
markets, as buyers and sellers 
attempt to evade the price controls.

Price Floors
S
ometimes governments intervene to push market prices up instead of down. 
Price floors have been widely legislated for agricultural products, such as 
wheat and milk, as a way to support the incomes of farmers. Historically, 
there were also price floors on such services as trucking and air travel, although 
these were phased out by the U.S. government in the 1970s. If you have ever 
worked in a fast-food restaurant, you are likely to have encountered a price floor: 
governments in the United States and many other countries maintain a lower 
limit on the hourly wage rate of a worker’s labor; that is, a floor on the price of 
labor—called the minimum wage.
Just like price ceilings, price floors are intended to help some people but 
generate predictable and undesirable side effects. Figure 5-5 shows hypotheti-
cal supply and demand curves for butter. Left to itself, the market would move 
to equilibrium at point E, with 10 million pounds of butter bought and sold at a 
price of $1 per pound.
Now suppose that the government, in order to help dairy farmers, imposes 
a price floor on butter of $1.20 per pound. Its effects are shown in Figure 5-6, 
where the line at $1.20 represents the price floor. At a price of $1.20 per pound, 
producers would want to supply 12 million pounds (point B on the supply 
curve) but consumers would want to buy only 9 million pounds (point A on 
the demand curve). So the price floor leads to a persistent surplus of 3 million 
pounds of butter.
Does a price floor always lead to an unwanted surplus? No. Just as in the case 
of a price ceiling, the floor may not be binding—that is, it may be irrelevant. If 
the equilibrium price of butter is $1 per pound but the floor is set at only $0.80, 
the floor has no effect.

Without government intervention, the market for butter reaches equilibrium at a price of $1 per pound with

The minimum wage is a legal 
floor on the wage rate, which is the 
market price of labor.

But suppose that a price floor is binding: what happens to the unwanted 
surplus? The answer depends on government policy. In the case of agricul-
tural price floors, governments buy up unwanted surplus. As a result, the 
U.S. government has at times found itself warehousing thousands of tons of 
butter, cheese, and other farm products. (The European Commission, which 
administers price floors for a number of European countries, once found itself 
the owner of a so-called butter mountain, equal in weight to the entire popu-
lation of Austria.) The government then has to find a way to dispose of these 
unwanted goods.
Some countries pay exporters to sell products at a loss overseas; this is stan-
dard procedure for the European Union. The United States gives surplus food 
away to schools, which use the products in school lunches. In some cases, govern-
ments have actually destroyed the surplus production. To avoid the problem of 
dealing with the unwanted surplus, the U.S. government typically pays farmers 
not to produce the products at all.
When the government is not prepared to purchase the unwanted surplus, a 
price floor means that would-be sellers cannot find buyers. This is what happens 
when there is a price floor on the wage rate paid for an hour of labor, the mini-
mum wage: when the minimum wage is above the equilibrium wage rate, some 
people who are willing to work—that is, sell labor—cannot find buyers—that is, 
employers—willing to give them jobs.
How a Price Floor Causes Inefficiency
The persistent surplus that results from a price floor creates missed opportuni-
ties—inefficiencies—that resemble those created by the shortage that results 
from a price ceiling. These include deadweight loss from inefficiently low 
quantity, inefficient allocation of sales among sellers, wasted resources, inef-
ficiently high quality, and the temptation to break the law by selling below the 
legal price.
The Effects of a Price Floor

rises to 12 million pounds, gener-
ating a persistent surplus of 3 mil-
lion pounds of butter.

Inefficiently Low Quantity Because a price floor raises the price of a good to 
consumers, it reduces the quantity of that good demanded; because sellers can’t sell 
more units of a good than buyers are willing to buy, a price floor reduces the quan-
tity of a good bought and sold below the market equilibrium quantity and leads to a 
deadweight loss. Notice that this is the same effect as a price ceiling. You might be 
tempted to think that a price floor and a price ceiling have opposite effects, but both 
have the effect of reducing the quantity of a good bought and sold (see Pitfalls above).
Since the equilibrium of an efficient market maximizes the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus, a price floor that reduces the quantity below the equilib-
rium quantity reduces total surplus. Figure 5-7 shows the implications for total 
surplus of a price floor on the price of butter. Total surplus is the sum of the area 
above the supply curve and below the demand curve. By reducing the quantity of 
butter sold, a price floor causes a deadweight loss equal to the area of the shaded 
triangle in the figure. As in the case of a price ceiling, however, deadweight loss 
is only one of the forms of inefficiency that the price control creates.

PITFALLS
CEILINGS, FLOORS, AND 
QUANTITIES
A price ceiling pushes the price of a 
good down. A price floor pushes the 
price of a good up. So it’s easy to 
assume that the effects of a price floor 
are the opposite of the effects of a price 
ceiling. In particular, if a price ceiling 
reduces the quantity of a good bought 
and sold, doesn’t a price floor increase 
the quantity?
No, it doesn’t. In fact, both floors 
and ceilings reduce the quantity bought 
and sold. Why? When the quantity of a 
good supplied isn’t equal to the quantity 
demanded, the actual quantity sold is 
determined by the “short side” of the 
market—whichever quantity is less. If 
sellers don’t want to sell as much as 
buyers want to buy, it’s the sellers who 
determine the actual quantity sold, 
because buyers can’t force unwilling sell-
ers to sell. If buyers don’t want to buy as 
much as sellers want to sell, it’s the buy-
ers who determine the actual quantity 
sold, because sellers can’t force unwill-
ing buyers to buy.

Inefficient Allocation of Sales Among Sellers Like a price ceiling, a price 
floor can lead to inefficient allocation—but in this case inefficient allocation of 
sales among sellers rather than inefficient allocation to consumers.
An episode from the Belgian movie Rosetta, a realistic fictional story, illustrates 
the problem of inefficient allocation of selling opportunities quite well. Like many 
European countries, Belgium has a high minimum wage, and jobs for young people 
are scarce. At one point Rosetta, a young woman who is very anxious to work, loses 
her job at a fast-food stand because the owner of the stand replaces her with his son—a 
very reluctant worker. Rosetta would be willing to work for less money, and with the 
money he would save, the owner could give his son an allowance and let him do some-
thing else. But to hire Rosetta for less than the minimum wage would be illegal.
Wasted Resources Also like a price ceiling, a price floor generates inefficiency by 
wasting resources. The most graphic examples involve government purchases of the 
unwanted surpluses of agricultural products caused by price floors. The surplus pro-
duction is sometimes destroyed, which is pure waste; in other cases, the stored produce 
goes, as officials euphemistically put it, “out of condition” and must be thrown away.
Price floors also lead to wasted time and effort. Consider the minimum wage. 
Would-be workers who spend many hours searching for jobs, or waiting in line in 
the hope of getting jobs, play the same role in the case of price floors as hapless 
families searching for apartments in the case of price ceilings.
Inefficiently High Quality Again like price ceilings, price floors lead to inef-
ficiency in the quality of goods produced.
We saw that when there is a price ceiling, suppliers produce products that are 
of inefficiently low quality: buyers prefer higher-quality products and are willing to 
pay for them, but sellers refuse to improve the quality of their products because the 
price ceiling prevents their being compensated for doing so. This same logic applies 
to price floors, but in reverse: suppliers offer goods of inefficiently high quality.
How can this be? Isn’t high quality a good thing? Yes, but only if it is worth 
the cost. Suppose that suppliers spend a lot to make goods of very high quality 
but that this quality isn’t worth much to consumers, who would rather receive the 
money spent on that quality in the form of a lower price. This represents a missed 
opportunity: suppliers and buyers could make a mutually beneficial deal in which 
buyers got goods of lower quality for a much lower price.
A good example of the inefficiency of excessive quality comes from the days 
when transatlantic airfares were set artificially high by international treaty. 
Forbidden to compete for customers by offering lower ticket prices, airlines 
instead offered expensive services, like lavish in-flight meals that went largely 
uneaten. At one point the regulators tried to restrict this practice by defining 
maximum service standards—for example, that snack service should con-
sist of no more than a sandwich. One airline then introduced what it called a 
“Scandinavian Sandwich,” a towering affair that forced the convening of another 
conference to define sandwich. All of this was wasteful, especially considering 
that what passengers really wanted was less food and lower airfares.
Since the deregulation of U.S. airlines in the 1970s, American passengers have 
experienced a large decrease in ticket prices accompanied by a decrease in the 
quality of in-flight service—smaller seats, lower-quality food, and so on. Everyone 
complains about the service—but thanks to lower fares, the number of people fly-
ing on U.S. carriers has grown several hundred percent since airline deregulation.
Illegal Activity Finally, like price ceilings, price floors provide incentives for 
illegal activity. For example, in countries where the minimum wage is far above 
the equilibrium wage rate, workers desperate for jobs sometimes agree to work off 
the books for employers who conceal their employment from the government—or 
bribe the government inspectors. This practice, known in Europe as “black labor,” 
is especially common in Southern European countries such as Italy and Spain (see 
the upcoming Economics in Action).
Price floors lead to inefficient 
allocation of sales among 
sellers: those who would be willing 
to sell the good at the lowest price 
are not always those who actually 
manage to sell it.
Price floors often lead to inefficiency 
in that goods of inefficiently high 
quality are offered: sellers offer 
high-quality goods at a high price, 
even though buyers would prefer a 
lower quality at a lower price.

So Why Are There Price Floors?
To sum up, a price floor creates various negative side effects:
 • A persistent surplus of the good
 
• Inefficiency arising from the persistent surplus in the form of inefficient-
ly low quantity (deadweight loss), inefficient allocation of sales among 
sellers, wasted resources, and an inefficiently high level of quality offered 
by suppliers
 • The temptation to engage in illegal activity, particularly bribery and corrup-
tion of government officials
So why do governments impose price floors when they have so many nega-
tive side effects? The reasons are similar to those for imposing price ceilings. 
Government officials often disregard warnings about the consequences of price 
floors either because they believe that the relevant market is poorly described by 
the supply and demand model or, more often, because they do not understand 
the model. Above all, just as price ceilings are often imposed because they benefit 
some influential buyers of a good, price floors are often imposed because they 
benefit some influential sellers.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
“BLACK LABOR” IN SOUTHERN EUROPE
T
he best-known example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Most econo-
mists believe, however, that the minimum wage has relatively little effect on 
the job market in the United States, mainly because the floor is set so low. In 
1964, the U.S. minimum wage was 53% of the average wage of blue-collar produc-
tion workers; by 2010, despite several recent increases, it had fallen to about 44%.
The minimum wage rate in the United States, as you can 
see in this graph, is actually quite low compared with that 
in other rich countries. Since minimum wages are set in 
national currency—the British minimum wage is set in 
British pounds, the French minimum wage is set in euros, 
and so on—the comparison depends on the exchange 
rate on any given day. As of April 15, 2011, Australia had 
a minimum wage over twice as high as the U.S. rate, with 
France, Canada, and Ireland not far behind. You can see 
one effect of this difference in the supermarket checkout 
line. In the United States there is usually someone to bag 
your groceries—someone typically paid the minimum 
wage or at best slightly more. In Europe, where hiring 
a bagger is a lot more expensive, you’re almost always 
expected to do the bagging yourself.

The situation is different, however, in many European countries, where 
minimum wages have been set much higher than in the United States. This 
has happened despite the fact that workers in most European countries are 
somewhat less productive than their American counterparts, which means 
that the equilibrium wage in Europe—the wage that would clear the labor 
market—is probably lower in Europe than in the United States. Moreover, 
European countries often require employers to pay for health and retirement 
benefits, which are more extensive and so more costly than comparable 
American benefits. These mandated benefits make the actual cost of employ-
ing a European worker considerably more than the worker’s paycheck.
The result is that in Europe the price floor on labor is definitely bind-
ing: the minimum wage is well above the wage rate that would make 
the quantity of labor supplied by workers equal to the quantity of labor 
demanded by employers.
The persistent surplus that results from this price floor appears in 
the form of high unemployment—millions of workers, especially young 
workers, seek jobs but cannot find them. 
In countries where the enforcement of labor laws is lax, however, there 
is a second, entirely predictable result: widespread evasion of the law. In 
both Italy and Spain, officials believe there are hundreds of thousands, if 
not millions, of workers who are employed by companies that pay them 
less than the legal minimum, fail to provide the required health and retirement 
benefits, or both. In many cases the jobs are simply unreported: Spanish econo-
mists estimate that about a third of the country’s reported unemployed are in the 
black labor market—working at unreported jobs. In fact, Spaniards waiting to 
collect checks from the unemployment office have been known to complain about 
the long lines that keep them from getting back to work!
Employers in these countries have also found legal ways to evade the wage 
floor. For example, Italy’s labor regulations apply only to companies with 15 or 
more workers. This gives a big cost advantage to small Italian firms, many of 
which remain small in order to avoid paying higher wages and benefits. And sure 
enough, in some Italian industries there is an astonishing proliferation of tiny 
companies. For example, one of Italy’s most successful industries is the manufac-
ture of fine woolen cloth, centered in the Prato region. The average textile firm in 
that region employs only four workers!

Controlling Quantities
I
n the 1930s, New York City instituted a system of licensing for taxicabs: only 
taxis with a “medallion” were allowed to pick up passengers. Because this 
system was intended to assure quality, medallion owners were supposed to 
maintain certain standards, including safety and cleanliness. A total of 11,787 
medallions were issued, with taxi owners paying $10 for each medallion.
In 1995, there were still only 11,787 licensed taxicabs in New York, even 
though the city had meanwhile become the financial capital of the world, 
a place where hundreds of thousands of people in a hurry tried to hail a 
cab every day. (An additional 400 medallions were issued in 1995, and after 
several rounds of sales of additional medallions, today there are 13,128 
medallions.)
The result of this restriction on the number of taxis was that a New York City 
taxi medallion became very valuable: if you wanted to operate a taxi in New York, 
you had to lease a medallion from someone else or buy one for a going price of 
several hundred thousand dollars.
It turns out that this story is not unique; other cities introduced similar 
medallion systems in the 1930s and, like New York, have issued few new medal-
lions since. In San Francisco and Boston, as in New York, taxi medallions trade 
for six-figure prices.
A taxi medallion system is a form of quantity control, or quota, by which 
the government regulates the quantity of a good that can be bought and sold 
rather than the price at which it is transacted. The total amount of the good that 
can be transacted under the quantity control is called the quota limit. Typically, 
the government limits quantity in a market by issuing licenses; only people with 
a license can legally supply the good. 
A taxi medallion is just such a license. The government of New York City 
limits the number of taxi rides that can be sold by limiting the number of taxis 
to only those who hold medallions. There are many other cases of quantity con-
trols, ranging from limits on how much foreign currency (for instance, British 
pounds or Mexican pesos) people are allowed to buy to the quantity of clams 
New Jersey fishing boats are allowed to catch. Notice, by the way, that although 
there are price controls on both sides of the equilibrium price—price ceilings 
and price floors—in the real world, quantity controls always set an upper, not 
a lower, limit on quantities. After all, nobody can be forced to buy or sell more 
than they want to!
Some attempts to control quantities are undertaken for good economic 
reasons, some for bad ones. In many cases, as we will see, quantity con-
trols introduced to address a temporary problem become politically hard to 
remove later because the beneficiaries don’t want them abolished, even after 
the original reason for their existence is long gone. But whatever the reasons 
for such controls, they have certain predictable—and usually undesirable—
economic consequences.
The Anatomy of Quantity Controls
To understand why a New York taxi medallion is worth so much money, we con-
sider a simplified version of the market for taxi rides, shown in Figure 5-8. Just as 
we assumed in the analysis of rent control that all apartments are the same, we 
now suppose that all taxi rides are the same—ignoring the real-world complica-
tion that some taxi rides are longer, and so more expensive, than others. The table 
in the figure shows supply and demand schedules. The equilibrium—indicated by 
point E in the figure and by the shaded entries in the table—is a fare of $5 per 
ride, with 10 million rides taken per year. (You’ll see in a minute why we present 
the equilibrium this way.)
A quantity control, or quota, is 
an upper limit on the quantity of 
some good that can be bought or 
sold. The total amount of the good 
that can be legally transacted is the 
quota limit.
A license gives its owner the right 
to supply a good.

144    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
The New York medallion system limits the number of taxis, but each taxi 
driver can offer as many rides as he or she can manage. (Now you know why New 
York taxi drivers are so aggressive!) To simplify our analysis, however, we will 
assume that a medallion system limits the number of taxi rides that can legally 
be given to 8 million per year.
Until now, we have derived the demand curve by answering questions of the 
form: “How many taxi rides will passengers want to take if the price is $5 per 
ride?” But it is possible to reverse the question and ask instead: “At what price will 
consumers want to buy 10 million rides per year?” The price at which consumers 
want to buy a given quantity—in this case, 10 million rides at $5 per ride—is the 
demand price of that quantity. You can see from the demand schedule in Figure 
5-8 that the demand price of 6 million rides is $7 per ride, the demand price of 7 
million rides is $6.50 per ride, and so on.
Similarly, the supply curve represents the answer to questions of the form: 
“How many taxi rides would taxi drivers supply at a price of $5 each?” But we 
can also reverse this question to ask: “At what price will suppliers be willing to 
supply 10 million rides per year?” The price at which suppliers will supply a given 
quantity—in this case, 10 million rides at $5 per ride—is the supply price of 
that quantity. We can see from the supply schedule in Figure 5-8 that the supply 
price of 6 million rides is $3 per ride, the supply price of 7 million rides is $3.50 
per ride, and so on.
Now we are ready to analyze a quota. We have assumed that the city govern-
ment limits the quantity of taxi rides to 8 million per year. Medallions, each of 
which carries the right to provide a certain number of taxi rides per year, are 
made available to selected people in such a way that a total of 8 million rides will 
be provided. Medallion-holders may then either drive their own taxis or rent their 
medallions to others for a fee.
Figure 5-9 shows the resulting market for taxi rides, with the black verti-
cal line at 8 million rides per year representing the quota limit. Because the

quantity of rides is limited to 8 million, consumers must be at point A on 
the demand curve, corresponding to the shaded entry in the demand schedule: 
the demand price of 8 million rides is $6 per ride. Meanwhile, taxi drivers 
must be at point B on the supply curve, corresponding to the shaded entry in 
the supply schedule: the supply price of 8 million rides is $4 per ride.
But how can the price received by taxi drivers be $4 when the price paid by 
taxi riders is $6? The answer is that in addition to the market in taxi rides, there 
is also a market in medallions. Medallion-holders may not always want to drive 
their taxis: they may be ill or on vacation. Those who do not want to drive their 
own taxis will sell the right to use the medallion to someone else. So we need 
to consider two sets of transactions here, and so two prices: (1) the transactions 
in taxi rides and the price at which these will occur, and (2) the transactions in 
medallions and the price at which these will occur. It turns out that since we are 
looking at two markets, the $4 and $6 prices will both be right.
To see how this all works, consider two imaginary New York taxi drivers, 
Sunil and Harriet. Sunil has a medallion but can’t use it because he’s recover-
ing from a severely sprained wrist. So he’s looking to rent his medallion out 
to someone else. Harriet doesn’t have a medallion but would like to rent one. 
Furthermore, at any point in time there are many other people like Harriet who 
would like to rent a medallion. Suppose Sunil agrees to rent his medallion to 
Harriet. To make things simple, assume that any driver can give only one ride 
per day and that Sunil is renting his medallion to Harriet for one day. What 
rental price will they agree on?

The table shows the demand price and the supply 
price corresponding to each quantity: the price at 
which that quantity would be demanded and sup-
plied, respectively. The city government imposes a 
quota of 8 million rides by selling licenses for only 
8 million rides, represented by the black vertical 
line. The price paid by consumers rises to $6 per 
ride, the demand price of 8 million rides, shown by 
point A. The supply price of 8 million rides is only $4 
per ride, shown by point B. The difference between 
these two prices is the quota rent per ride, the earn-
ings that accrue to the owner of a license. The quota 
rent drives a wedge between the demand price and 
the supply price. And since the quota discourages 
mutually beneficial transactions, it creates a dead-
weight loss equal to the shaded triangle.

To answer this question, we need to look at the transactions from the 
viewpoints of both drivers. Once she has the medallion, Harriet knows she 
can make $6 per day—the demand price of a ride under the quota. And she is 
willing to rent the medallion only if she makes at least $4 per day—the sup-
ply price of a ride under the quota. So Sunil cannot demand a rent of more 
than $2—the difference between $6 and $4. And if Harriet offered Sunil less 
than $2—say, $1.50—there would be other eager drivers willing to offer him 
more, up to $2. So, in order to get the medallion, Harriet must offer Sunil at 
least $2. Since the rent can be no more than $2 and no less than $2, it must 
be exactly $2.
It is no coincidence that $2 is exactly the difference between $6, the 
demand price of 8 million rides, and $4, the supply price of 8 million rides. 
In every case in which the supply of a good is legally restricted, there is a 
wedge between the demand price of the quantity transacted and the supply 
price of the quantity transacted. This wedge, illustrated by the double-headed 
arrow in Figure 5-9, has a special name: the quota rent. It is the earnings 
that accrue to the license-holder from ownership of a valuable commodity, 
the license. In the case of Sunil and Harriet, the quota rent of $2 goes to Sunil 
because he owns the license, and the remaining $4 from the total fare of $6 
goes to Harriet.
So Figure 5-9 also illustrates the quota rent in the market for New York taxi 
rides. The quota limits the quantity of rides to 8 million per year, a quantity at 
which the demand price of $6 exceeds the supply price of $4. The wedge between 
these two prices, $2, is the quota rent that results from the restrictions placed on 
the quantity of taxi rides in this market.
But wait a second. What if Sunil doesn’t rent out his medallion? What if 
he uses it himself? Doesn’t this mean that he gets a price of $6? No, not really. 
Even if Sunil doesn’t rent out his medallion, he could have rented it out, which 
means that the medallion has an opportunity cost of $2: if Sunil decides to use 
his own medallion and drive his own taxi rather than renting his medallion to 
Harriet, the $2 represents his opportunity cost of not renting out his medal-
lion. That is, the $2 quota rent is now the rental income he forgoes by driving 
his own taxi. 
In effect, Sunil is in two businesses—the taxi-driving business and the 
medallion-renting business. He makes $4 per ride from driving his taxi 
and $2 per ride from renting out his medallion. It doesn’t make any differ-
ence that in this particular case he has rented his medallion to himself! So 
regardless of whether the medallion owner uses the medallion himself or 
herself, or rents it to others, it is a valuable asset. And this is represented 
in the going price for a New York City taxi medallion: in October 2011, it 
was $694,000. According to Simon Greenbaum, a broker of New York taxi 
medallions, an owner of a medallion who leases it to a driver can expect to 
earn about $2,500 per month, or a 3% return—an attractive rate of return 
compared to other investments. 
Notice, by the way, that quotas—like price ceilings and price floors—don’t 
always have a real effect. If the quota were set at 12 million rides—that is, above 
the equilibrium quantity in an unregulated market—it would have no effect 
because it would not be binding.
The Costs of Quantity Controls
Like price controls, quantity controls can have some predictable and unde-
sirable side effects. The first is the by-now-familiar problem of inefficiency 
due to missed opportunities: quantity controls create deadweight loss by 
preventing mutually beneficial transactions from occurring, transactions 
A quantity control, or quota, drives a 
wedge between the demand price 
and the supply price of a good; that 
is, the price paid by buyers ends up 
being higher than that received by 
sellers. 
The difference between the demand 
and supply price at the quota limit 
is the quota rent, the earnings that 
accrue to the license-holder from 
ownership of the right to sell the 
good. It is equal to the market price 
of the license when the licenses are 
traded.

C H A P T E R  5    PR I C E C O N T R O L S A N D  Q U OTA S: M E D D L I N G W I T H  M A R K E T S    147
that would benefit both buyers and sellers. Looking back at Figure 5-9, you 
can see that starting at the quota limit of 8 million rides, New Yorkers would 
be willing to pay at least $5.50 per ride for an additional 1 million rides and 
that taxi drivers would be willing to provide those rides as long as they got 
at least $4.50 per ride. These are rides that would have taken place if there 
were no quota limit. 
The same is true for the next 1 million rides: New Yorkers would be willing 
to pay at least $5 per ride when the quantity of rides is increased from 9 to 10 
million, and taxi drivers would be willing to provide those rides as long as they 
got at least $5 per ride. Again, these rides would have occurred without the 
quota limit. 
Only when the market has reached the unregulated market equilibrium 
quantity of 10 million rides are there no “missed-opportunity rides.” The quota 
limit of 8 million rides has caused 2 million “missed-opportunity rides.” 
Generally, as long as the demand price of a given quantity exceeds the supply 
price, there is a deadweight loss. A buyer would be willing to buy the good at a 
price that the seller would be willing to accept, but such a transaction does not 
occur because it is forbidden by the quota. The deadweight loss arising from the 
2 million in missed-opportunity rides is represented by the shaded triangle in 
Figure 5-9.
And because there are transactions that people would like to make but 
are not allowed to, quantity controls generate an incentive to evade them or 
even to break the law. New York’s taxi industry again provides clear examples. 
Taxi regulation applies only to those drivers who are hailed by passengers on 
the street. A car service that makes prearranged 
pickups does not need a medallion. As a result, 
such hired cars provide much of the service that 
might otherwise be provided by taxis, as in other 
cities. In addition, there are substantial num-
bers of unlicensed cabs that simply defy the law 
by picking up passengers without a medallion. 
Because these cabs are illegal, their drivers are 
completely unregulated, and they generate a dis-
proportionately large share of traffic accidents in 
New York City.
In fact, in 2004 the hardships caused by the 
limited number of New York taxis led city leaders 
to authorize an increase in the number of licensed 
taxis. In a series of sales, the city sold 900 new 
medallions, to bring the total number up to the 
current 13,128 medallions—a move that certainly 
cheered New York riders. 
But those who already owned medallions were less happy with the increase; 
they understood that the 900 new taxis would reduce or eliminate the short-
age of taxis. As a result, taxi drivers anticipated a decline in their revenues 
because they would no longer always be assured of finding willing customers. 
And, in turn, the value of a medallion would fall. So to placate the medallion 
owners, city officials also raised taxi fares: by 25% in 2004, and again—by a 
smaller percentage—in 2006. Although taxis are now easier to find, a ride now 
costs more—and that price increase slightly diminished the newfound cheer 
of New York taxi riders.
In sum, quantity controls typically create the following undesirable side 
effects:
 • Deadweight loss because some mutually beneficial transactions don’t occur
 • Incentives for illegal activities
Dangerous, unlicensed cabs are one cost of quantity controls.

THE CLAMS OF JERSEY SHORE

orget the refineries along the Jersey Turnpike or reality TV shows; one 
industry that New Jersey really dominates is clam fishing. In 2009 the 
Garden State supplied 39% of the country’s quahogs, which are used to make 
clam chowder, and 71% of the surf clams, whose tongues are used in fried-
clam dinners.
In the 1980s, however, excessive fish-
ing threatened to wipe out New Jersey’s 
clam beds. To save the resource, the U.S. 
government introduced a clam quota, 
which sets an overall limit on the num-
ber of bushels of clams that may be 
caught and allocates licenses to owners 
of fishing boats based on their historical 
catches.
Notice, by the way, that this is an 
example of a quota that is probably 
justified by broader economic and envi-
ronmental considerations—unlike the 
New York taxicab quota, which has long 
since lost any economic rationale. Still, 
whatever its rationale, the New Jersey 
clam quota works the same way as any 
other quota.
Once the quota system was estab-
lished, many boat owners stopped fish-
ing for clams. They realized that rather than operate a boat part time, it was 
more profitable to sell or rent their licenses to someone else, who could then 
assemble enough licenses to operate a boat full time. Today, there are about 50 
New Jersey boats fishing for clams; the license required to operate one is worth 
more than the boat itself.

• Quantity controls, or quotas, are 
government-imposed limits on how 
much of a good may be bought or 
sold. The quantity allowed for sale 
is the quota limit. The government 
then issues a license—the right 
to sell a given quantity of a good 
under the quota.
• When the quota limit is smaller 
than the equilibrium quantity in an 
unregulated market, the demand 
price is higher than the supply 
price—there is a wedge between 
them at the quota limit.
• This wedge is the quota rent, the 
earnings that accrue to the license-
holder from ownership of the right 
to sell the good—whether by actu-
ally supplying the good or by rent-
ing the license to someone else. 
The market price of a license equals 
the quota rent.
• Like price controls, quantity con-
trols create deadweight loss and 
encourage illegal activity.
 Quick Review

149
Back in 1937, before New York City froze its number of taxi medallions, Andrew 
Murstein’s immigrant grandfather bought his first one for $10. Over time, the 
grandfather accumulated 500 medallions, which he rented to other drivers. Those 
500 taxi medallions became the foundation for Medallion Financial: the company 
that would eventually pass to Andrew, its current president.
With a market value of over $200 million in late 2011, Medallion Financial has 
shifted its major line of business from renting out medallions to financing the 
purchase of new ones, lending money to those who want to buy a medallion but 
don’t have the sizable amount of cash required to do so. Murstein believes that he 
is helping people who, like his Polish immigrant grandfather, want to buy a piece 
of the American dream.
Andrew Murstein carefully watches the value of a New York City taxi medal-
lion: the more one costs, the more demand there is for loans from Medallion 
Financial, and the more interest the company makes on the loan. A loan from 
Medallion Financial is secured by the value of the medallion itself. If the bor-
rower is unable to repay the loan, Medallion Financial takes possession of his or 
her medallion and resells it to offset the cost of the loan default. As of 2011, the 
value of a medallion has risen faster than stocks, oil, and gold. Over the past two 
decades, from 1990 through fall 2011, the value of a medallion rose 440% com-
pared to only 255% for an index of stocks.
But medallion prices can fluctuate dramatically, threatening profits. During 
periods of a very strong economy, such as 1999 and 2001, the price of New York 
taxi medallions fell as drivers found jobs in other sectors. When the New York 
economy tanked in the aftermath of 9/11, the price of a medallion fell to $180,000, 
its lowest level in 12 years. In 2004, medallion owners were concerned about the 
impending sale by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission of an addi-
tional 900 medallions. As Peter Hernandez, a worried New York cabdriver who 
financed his medallion with a loan from Medallion Financial, said at the time: 
“If they pump new taxis into the industry, it devalues my medallion. It devalues 
my daily income, too.”
Yet Murstein has always been optimistic that medallions would hold their 
value. He believed that a 25% fare increase would offset potential losses in their 
value caused by the sale of new medallions. In addition, more medallions would 
mean more loans for his company. As of 2011, Murstein’s optimism had been 
justified. Because of the financial crisis of 2007–2009, many New York compa-
nies cut back the limousine services they ordinarily provided to their employees, 
forcing them to take taxis instead. As a result, the price of a medallion rose to 
an astonishing $694,000 in October 2011. And investors have noticed the value in 
Medallion Financial’s line of business: from November 2010 to November 2011, 
shares of Medallion Financial have risen 44%. 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. How does Medallion Financial benefit from the restriction on the number of New York taxi 
medallions?
 2. What will be the effect on Medallion Financial if New York companies resume widespread 
use of limousine services for their employees? What is the economic motivation that 
prompts companies to offer this perk to their employees? (Note that it is very difficult and 
expensive to own a personal car in New York City.)
 3. Predict the effect on Medallion Financial’s business if New York City eliminates restric-
tions on the number of taxis.

SUMMARY
 1. Even when a market is efficient, governments often 
intervene to pursue greater fairness or to please a pow-
erful interest group. Interventions can take the form of 
price controls or quantity controls, both of which gen-
erate predictable and undesirable side effects consisting 
of various forms of inefficiency and illegal activity.
 2. A price ceiling, a maximum market price below the 
equilibrium price, benefits successful buyers but creates 
persistent shortages. Because the price is maintained 
below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded is 
increased and the quantity supplied is decreased com-
pared to the equilibrium quantity. This leads to predict-
able problems: inefficiencies in the form of deadweight 
loss from inefficiently low quantity, inefficient allo-
cation to consumers, wasted resources, and inef-
ficiently low quality. It also encourages illegal activ-
ity as people turn to black markets to get the good. 
Because of these problems, price ceilings have generally 
lost favor as an economic policy tool. But some govern-
ments continue to impose them either because they 
don’t understand the effects or because the price ceil-
ings benefit some influential group.
 3. A price floor, a minimum market price above the 
equilibrium price, benefits successful sellers but cre-
ates persistent surplus. Because the price is main-
tained above the equilibrium price, the quantity 
demanded is decreased and the quantity supplied is 
increased compared to the equilibrium quantity. This 
leads to predictable problems: inefficiencies in the 
form of deadweight loss from inefficiently low quan-
tity, inefficient allocation of sales among sellers, 
wasted resources, and inefficiently high quality. It 
also encourages illegal activity and black markets. The 
most well known kind of price floor is the minimum 
wage, but price floors are also commonly applied to 
agricultural products.
 4. Quantity controls, or quotas, limit the quantity 
of a good that can be bought or sold. The quantity 
allowed for sale is the quota limit. The government 
issues licenses to individuals, the right to sell a given 
quantity of the good. The owner of a license earns a 
quota rent, earnings that accrue from ownership of 
the right to sell the good. It is equal to the difference 
between the demand price at the quota limit, what 
consumers are willing to pay for that quantity, and the 
supply price at the quota limit, what suppliers are 
willing to accept for that quantity. Economists say that 
a quota drives a wedge between the demand price and 
the supply price; this wedge is equal to the quota rent. 
Quantity controls lead to deadweight loss in addition to 
encouraging illegal activity.

PROBLEMS
 1. Suppose it is decided that rent control in New York 
City will be abolished and that market rents will now 
prevail. Assume that all rental units are identical and 
so are offered at the same rent. To address the plight 
of residents who may be unable to pay the market rent, 
an income supplement will be paid to all low - income 
households equal to the difference between the old con-
trolled rent and the new market rent.
 a. Use a diagram to show the effect on the rental mar-
ket of the elimination of rent control. What will 
happen to the quality and quantity of rental housing 
supplied?
 b. Use a second diagram to show the additional effect 
of the income - supplement policy on the market. 
What effect does it have on the market rent and 
quantity of rental housing supplied in comparison to 
your answers to part a?
 c. Are tenants better or worse off as a result of these 
policies? Are landlords better or worse off? Is soci-
ety as a whole better or worse off?
 d. From a political standpoint, why do you think cities 
have been more likely to resort to rent control rather 
than a policy of income supplements to help low - 
income people pay for housing?

 a. Assume that there are no restrictions on the num-

medallion system). Find the equilibrium price and 
quantity.
 b. Suppose that the mayor sets a price ceiling at 
$5.50. How large is the shortage of rides? Illustrate 
with a diagram. Who loses and who benefits from 
this policy?
 c. Suppose that the stock market crashes and, as 
a result, people in Gotham City are poorer. This 
reduces the quantity of taxi rides demanded by 6 
million rides per year at any given price. What effect 
will the mayor’s new policy have now? Illustrate with 
a diagram.
 d. Suppose that the stock market rises and the 
demand for taxi rides returns to normal (that 
is, returns to the demand schedule given in 
the table). The mayor now decides to ingratiate 
himself with taxi drivers. He announces a policy 
in which operating licenses are given to existing 
taxi drivers; the number of licenses is restricted 
such that only 10 million rides per year can be 
given. Illustrate the effect of this policy on the 
market, and indicate the resulting price and 
quantity transacted. What is the quota rent 
per ride?
 3. In the late eighteenth century, the price of bread in New 
York City was controlled, set at a predetermined price 
above the market price.
 a. Draw a diagram showing the effect of the policy. Did 
the policy act as a price ceiling or a price floor?
 b. What kinds of inefficiencies were likely to have aris-
en when the controlled price of bread was above the 
market price? Explain in detail.
One year during this period, a poor wheat harvest 
caused a leftward shift in the supply of bread and there-
fore an increase in its market price. New York bakers 
found that the controlled price of bread in New York 
was below the market price.
 c. Draw a diagram showing the effect of the price con-
trol on the market for bread during this one - year 
period. Did the policy act as a price ceiling or a 
price floor?
 d. What kinds of inefficiencies do you think occurred 
during this period? Explain in detail.
 4. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adminis-
ters the price floor for butter, which the 2008 Farm Bill 
set at $1.05 per pound. At that price, according to data 
from the USDA, the quantity of butter supplied in 2010 
was 1.7 billion pounds, and the quantity demanded was 
1.6 billion pounds. To support the price of butter at 
the price floor, the USDA therefore had to buy up 100 
million pounds of butter. The accompanying diagram

school. How much will the dairy program now cost 
the government?
 e. Explain how inefficiencies in the form of inefficient 
allocation to sellers and wasted resources arise from

 6. European governments tend to make greater use 
of price controls than does the U.S. government. 
For example, the French government sets minimum 
starting yearly wages for new hires who have com-
pleted le bac, certification roughly equivalent to a 
high school diploma. The demand schedule for new 
hires with le bac and the supply schedule for simi-
larly credentialed new job seekers are given in the 
accompanying table. The price here—given in euros, 
the currency used in France—is the same as the 
yearly wage.

 a. In the absence of government interference, what 
are the equilibrium wage and number of graduates 
hired per year? Illustrate with a diagram. Will there 
be anyone seeking a job at the equilibrium wage 
who is unable to find one—that is, will there be any-
one who is involuntarily unemployed?
 b. Suppose the French government sets a minimum 
yearly wage of €35,000. Is there any involuntary 
unemployment at this wage? If so, how much? 
Illustrate with a diagram. What if the minimum 
wage is set at €40,000? Also illustrate with a 
diagram.
 c. Given your answer to part b and the information 
in the table, what do you think is the relationship 
between the level of involuntary unemployment and 
the level of the minimum wage? Who benefits from 
such a policy? Who loses? What is the missed oppor-
tunity here?
 7. Until recently, the standard number of hours worked 
per week for a full - time job in France was 39 hours, 
just as in the United States. But in response to social 
unrest over high levels of involuntary unemployment, 
the French government instituted a 35-hour work-
week—a worker could not work more than 35 hours per 
week even if both the worker and employer wanted it. 
The motivation behind this policy was that if current 
employees worked fewer hours, employers would be 
forced to hire more new workers. Assume that it is cost-
ly for employers to train new workers. French employ-
ers were greatly opposed to this policy and threatened 
to move their operations to neighboring countries that 
did not have such employment restrictions. Can you 
explain their attitude? Give an example of both an inef-
ficiency and an illegal activity that are likely to arise 
from this policy.
 8. For the last 70 years the U.S. government has used 
price supports to provide income assistance to 
American farmers. To implement these price sup-
ports, at times the government has used price floors, 
which it maintains by buying up the surplus farm 
products. At other times, it has used target prices, 
a policy by which the government gives the farmer 
an amount equal to the difference between the 
market price and the target price for each unit sold.

 c. Which of these programs (in parts a and b) costs 
corn consumers more? Which program costs the 
government more? Explain.
 d. Is one of these policies less inefficient than the

 9. The waters off the North Atlantic coast were once 
teeming with fish. But because of over fishing by the 
commercial fishing industry, the stocks of fish became 
seriously depleted. In 1991, the National Marine 
Fishery Service of the U.S. government implemented a 
quota to allow fish stocks to recover. The quota limited 
the amount of swordfish caught per year by all U.S.-
licensed fishing boats to 7 million pounds. As soon 
as the U.S. fishing fleet had met the quota limit, the 
swordfish catch was closed down for the rest of the 
year. The accompanying table gives the hypothetical 
demand and supply schedules for swordfish caught in 
the United States per year.

ment has decided to place a yearly quota of 80,000 
pounds of lobsters harvested in all Maine waters. It 
has also decided to give licenses this year only to those 
fishermen who had licenses last year. The accompany-

goods over time). In 1978, the United States Airline 
Deregulation Act removed the price floor on airline 
fares, and it also allowed the airlines greater flex-
ibility to offer new routes.

P
ANIC WAS THE ONLY WORD TO 
describe the situation at hospi-
tals, clinics, and nursing homes across 
America in October 2004. Early that 
month, Chiron Corporation, one of only 
two suppliers of flu vaccine for the entire 
U.S. market, announced that contamina-
tion problems had forced the closure of its 
manufacturing plant. With that closure, 
the U.S. supply of vaccine for the 2004–
2005 flu season was suddenly cut in half, 
from 100 million to 50 million doses. 
Because making flu vaccine is a cost-
ly and time-consuming process, no more 
doses could be made to replace Chiron’s 
lost output. And since every country 
jealously guards its supply of flu vac-
cine for its own citizens, none could be 
obtained from other countries.
If you’ve ever had a real case of the 
flu, you know just how unpleasant an 
experience it is. And it can be worse than 
unpleasant: every year the flu kills around 
36,000 Americans and sends another 
200,000 to the hospital. Victims are most 
commonly children, seniors, or those with 
compromised immune systems.
In 2004, as news of the flu vaccine 
shortfall spread, there was a rush to get 
the shots. People lined up in the middle 
of the night at the few locations that 
had somehow obtained the vaccine and 
were offering it at a reasonable price: the 
crowds included seniors with oxygen 
tanks, parents with sleeping children, 
and others in wheelchairs. Meanwhile, 
some pharmaceutical distributors—the 
companies that obtain vaccine from 
manufacturers and then distribute it to 
hospitals and pharmacies—detected a 
profit - making opportunity in the frenzy. 
One company, Med- Stat, which normally 
charged $8.50 for a dose, began charging 
$90, more than 10 times the normal price. 
Although most people refused or were 
unable to pay such a high price for the vac-
cine, many others undoubtedly did. Med- 
Stat judged, correctly, that a significant 
number of consumers were unresponsive to 
price; that is, the large increase in the price 
of the vaccine left the quantity demanded 
by these con sumers relatively unchanged.
Clearly, the demand for flu vaccine 
is unusual in this respect because get-
ting vaccinated meant the difference 
between life and death. Let’s consider a 
very different and less urgent scenario. 
Suppose, for example, that the supply of 
a particular type of breakfast cereal was 
halved due to manufacturing problems. 
It would be extremely unlikely, if not 
impossible, to find a consumer willing 
to pay 10 times the original price for a 
box of this particular cereal. In other 
words, consumers of breakfast cereal 
are much more responsive to price than 
consumers of flu vaccine.
But how do we define responsive-
ness? Economists measure responsive-
ness of consumers to price with a par-
ticular number, called the price elasticity 
of demand. In this chapter we will show 
how the price elasticity of demand is cal-
culated and why it is the best measure of 
how the quantity demanded responds to 
changes in price. We will then see that 
the price elasticity of demand is only one 
of a family of related concepts, including 
the income elasticity of demand, cross-
price elasticity of demand, and the price 
elasticity of supply.

Defining and Measuring Elasticity
I
n order for Flunomics, a hypothetical flu vaccine distributor, to know whether 
it could raise its revenue by significantly raising the price of its flu vaccine 
during the 2004 flu vaccine panic, it would have to know the price elasticity of 
demand for flu vaccinations.
Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand
Figure 6-1 shows a hypothetical demand curve for flu vaccinations. At a price of 
$20 per vaccination, consumers would demand 10 million vaccinations per year 
(point A); at a price of $21, the quantity demanded would fall to 9.9 million vac-
cinations per year (point B).
Figure 6-1, then, tells us the change in the quantity demanded for a particular 
change in the price. But how can we turn this into a measure of price responsive-
ness? The answer is to calculate the price elasticity of demand.
The price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percent change in quantity 
demanded to the percent change in price as we move along the demand curve. As 
we’ll see later in this chapter, the reason economists use percent changes is to 
obtain a measure that doesn’t depend on the units in which a good is measured 
(say, a child - size dose versus an adult - size dose of vaccine). But before we get to 
that, let’s look at how elasticity is calculated.
To calculate the price elasticity of demand, we first calculate the percent 
change in the quantity demanded and the corresponding percent change in the price 
as we move along the demand curve. These are defined as follows:
(6-1) % change in quantity demanded = Change in quantity demanded
Initial quantity demanded  × 100
and
(6-2) % change in price = Change in price
Initial price
 × 100
In Figure 6-1, we see that when the price rises from $20 to $21, the quantity 
demanded falls from 10 million to 9.9 million vaccinations, yielding a change in 
the quantity demanded of 0.1 million vaccinations. So the percent change in the 
quantity demanded is
% change in quantity demanded = −0.1 million vaccinations
10 million vaccinations  × 100 = −1%
The initial price is $20 and the change in the price is $1, so the percent change 
in price is
% change in price = $1
$20 × 100 = 5%
To calculate the price elasticity of demand, we find the ratio of the percent 
change in the quantity demanded to the percent change in the price:
(6-3) Price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in price
In Figure 6-1, the price elasticity of demand is therefore
Price elasticity of demand = 1%
5% 
= 0.2
The law of demand says that demand curves are downward sloping, so price 
and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions. In other words, 
a positive percent change in price (a rise in price) leads to a negative percent 
The price elasticity of demand is 
the ratio of the percent change in the 
quantity demanded to the percent 
change in the price as we move 
along the demand curve (dropping 
the minus sign).

C H A P T E R  6    E L A S T I C I T Y    157
change in the quantity demanded; a negative percent change in price (a fall in 
price) leads to a positive percent change in the quantity demanded. This means 
that the price elasticity of demand is, in strictly mathematical terms, a negative 
number. However, it is inconvenient to repeatedly write a minus sign. So when 
economists talk about the price elasticity of demand, they usually drop the minus 
sign and report the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand. In this case, 
for example, economists would usually say “the price elasticity of demand is 0.2,” 
taking it for granted that you understand they mean minus 0.2. We follow this 
convention here.
The larger the price elasticity of demand, the more responsive the quan-
tity demanded is to the price. When the price elasticity of demand is large—
when consumers change their quantity demanded by a large percentage 
compared with the percent change in the price—economists say that demand 
is highly elastic.
As we’ll see shortly, a price elasticity of 0.2 indicates a small response of quan-
tity demanded to price. That is, the quantity demanded will fall by a relatively 
small amount when price rises. This is what economists call inelastic demand. 
And inelastic demand was exactly what Flunomics needed for its strategy to 
increase revenue by raising the price of its flu vaccines.
An Alternative Way to Calculate Elasticities: 
The Midpoint Method
Price elasticity of demand compares the percent change in quantity demanded 
with the percent change in price. When we look at some other elasticities, 
which we will do shortly, we’ll learn why it is important to focus on percent 
changes. But at this point we need to discuss a technical issue that arises 
when you calculate percent changes in variables.
The best way to understand the issue is with a real example. Suppose you 
were trying to estimate the price elasticity of demand for gasoline by comparing 
gasoline prices and consumption in different countries. Because of high taxes, 
gasoline usually costs about three times as much per gallon in Europe as it does 
The Demand for Vaccinations
6-1
At a price of $20 per vaccination, the quantity 
of vaccinations demanded is 10 million per year 
(point A). When price rises to $21 per vaccina-
tion, the quantity demanded falls to 9.9 million 
vaccinations per year (point B).

in the United States. So what is the percent difference between American and 
European gas prices?
Well, it depends on which way you measure it. Because the price of gasoline 
in Europe is approximately three times higher than in the United States, it is 200 
percent higher. Because the price of gasoline in the United States is one - third as 
high as in Europe, it is 66.7 percent lower.
This is a nuisance: we’d like to have a percent measure of the difference in 
prices that doesn’t depend on which way you measure it. To avoid computing dif-
ferent elasticities for rising and falling prices we use the midpoint method.
The midpoint method replaces the usual definition of the percent change in 
a variable, X, with a slightly different definition:
(6-4) % change in X = 
Change in X
Average value of X × 100
where the average value of X is defined as
Average value of X = Starting value of X + Final value of X
2
When calculating the price elasticity of demand using the midpoint method, 
both the percent change in the price and the percent change in the quantity 
demanded are found using this method. To see how this method works, suppose 
you have the following data for some good:
 
Price 
Quantity demanded
 Situation A 
$0.90 
1,100
 Situation B 
$1.10 
  900
To calculate the percent change in quantity going from situation A to 
situation B, we compare the change in the quantity demanded—a fall of 200 
units—with the average of the quantity demanded in the two situations. So we 
calculate
% change in quantity demanded = 
−200
(1,100 + 900)/2 × 100 = −200
1,000 × 100 = −20%
In the same way, we calculate
% change in price = 
$0.20
($0.90 + $1.10)/2 × 100 = $0.20
$1.00 × 100 = 20%
So in this case we would calculate the price elasticity of demand to be
Price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in price
 = 20% 
20% = 1
again dropping the minus sign.
The important point is that we would get the same result, a price elasticity of 
demand of 1, whether we go up the demand curve from situation A to situation B 
or down from situation B to situation A.
To arrive at a more general formula for price elasticity of demand, suppose 
that we have data for two points on a demand curve. At point 1 the quantity 
demanded and price are (Q1, P1); at point 2 they are (Q2, P2). Then the formula for 
calculating the price elasticity of demand is:
(6-5) Price elasticity of demand = 
Q2 − Q1
(Q1 + Q2)/2
P2 − P1
(P1 + P2)/2
As before, when finding a price elasticity of demand calculated by the mid-
point method, we drop the minus sign and use the absolute value.
The midpoint method is a 
technique for calculating the 
percent change. In this approach, 
we calculate changes in a variable 
compared with the average, or 
midpoint, of the starting and final 
values.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
ESTIMATING ELASTICITIES
Y
ou might think it’s easy to estimate price elasticities of demand 
from real-world data: just compare percent changes in prices 
with percent changes in quantities demanded. Unfortunately, it’s 
rarely that simple because changes in price aren’t the only thing 
affecting changes in the quantity demanded: other factors—such 
as changes in income, changes in tastes, and changes in the prices 
of other goods—shift the demand curve, thereby changing the 
quantity demanded at any given price. To estimate price elastici-
ties of demand, economists must use careful statistical analysis 
to separate the influence of these different factors, holding other 
things equal.
The most comprehensive effort to estimate price elasticities 
of demand was a mammoth study by the economists Hendrik S. 
Houthakker and Lester D. Taylor. Some of their results are summa-
rized in Table 6-1. These estimates show a wide range of price elas-
ticities. There are some goods, like eggs, for which demand hardly 
responds at all to changes in the price. There are other goods, most 
notably foreign travel, for which the quantity demanded is very sen-
sitive to the price.
Notice that Table 6-1 is divided into two parts: inelastic and elastic 
demand. We’ll explain in the next section the significance of that division.

1.  The price of strawberries falls from $1.50 to $1.00 per carton and the quantity demand-
ed goes from 100,000 to 200,000 cartons. Use the midpoint method to find the price 
elasticity of demand.
2.  At the present level of consumption, 4,000 movie tickets, and at the current price, $5 
per ticket, the price elasticity of demand for movie tickets is 1. Using the midpoint meth-
od, calculate the percentage by which the owners of movie theaters must reduce price in 
order to sell 5,000 tickets.
3.  The price elasticity of demand for ice - cream sandwiches is 1.2 at the current price 
of $0.50 per sandwich and the current consumption level of 100,000 sandwiches. 
Calculate the change in the quantity demanded when price rises by $0.05. Use 
Equations 6-1 and 6-2 to calculate percent changes and Equation 6-3 to relate price 
elasticity of demand to the percent changes.
Solutions appear at back of book.
Interpreting the Price Elasticity 
of Demand
M
ed-Stat and other pharmaceutical distributors believed they could sharp-
ly drive up flu vaccine prices in the face of a shortage because the price 
elasticity of vaccine demand was small. But what does that mean? How 
low does a price elasticity have to be for us to classify it as low? How big does 
it have to be for us to consider it high? And what determines whether the price 
elasticity of demand is high or low, anyway?
To answer these questions, we need to look more deeply at the price elasticity 
of demand.
 Quick Review
• The price elasticity of demand is 
equal to the percent change in the 
quantity demanded divided by the 
percent change in the price as you 
move along the demand curve, and 
dropping any minus sign.
• In practice, percent changes are 
best measured using the midpoint 
method, in which the percent 
change in each variable is calcu-
lated using the average of starting 
and final values.

How Elastic Is Elastic?
As a first step toward classifying price elasticities of demand, let’s look at the 
extreme cases.
First, consider the demand for a good when people pay no attention to the 
price—say, snake anti-venom. Suppose that consumers will buy 1,000 doses 
of anti-venom per year regardless of the price. In this case, the demand curve 
for anti-venom would look like the curve shown in panel (a) of Figure 6-2: it 
would be a vertical line at 1,000 doses of anti-venom. Since the percent change 
in the quantity demanded is zero for any change in the price, the price elasticity 
of demand in this case is zero. The case of a zero price elasticity of demand is 
known as perfectly inelastic demand.
The opposite extreme occurs when even a tiny rise in the price will cause the 
quantity demanded to drop to zero or even a tiny fall in the price will cause 
the quantity demanded to get extremely large. 
Panel (b) of Figure 6-2 shows the case of pink tennis balls; we suppose that tennis 
players really don’t care what color their balls are and that other colors, such as neon 
green and vivid yellow, are available at $5 per dozen balls. In this case, consumers will 
buy no pink balls if they cost more than $5 per dozen but will buy only pink balls if 
they cost less than $5. The demand curve will therefore be a horizontal line at a price 
of $5 per dozen balls. As you move back and forth along this line, there is a change 
in the quantity demanded but no change in the price. Roughly speaking, when you 
divide a number by zero, you get infinity, denoted by the symbol ∞. So a horizontal 
demand curve implies an infinite price elasticity of demand. When the price elasticity 
of demand is infinite, economists say that demand is perfectly elastic.
The price elasticity of demand for the vast majority of goods is somewhere 
between these two extreme cases. Economists use one main criterion for classifying 
these intermediate cases: they ask whether the price elasticity of demand is greater

Panel (a) shows a perfectly inelastic demand curve, 
which is a vertical line. The quantity of snake anti-venom 
demanded is always 1,000 doses, regardless of price. As 
a result, the price elasticity of demand is zero—the quanti-
ty demanded is unaffected by the price. Panel (b) shows a 
perfectly elastic demand curve, which is a horizontal line. 
At a price of $5, consumers will buy any quantity of pink 
tennis balls, but they will buy none at a price above $5. If 
the price falls below $5, they will buy an extremely large 
number of pink tennis balls and none of any other color. 
Demand is perfectly inelastic 
when the quantity demanded does 
not respond at all to changes in the 
price. When demand is perfectly 
inelastic, the demand curve is a 
vertical line.
Demand is perfectly elastic when 
any price increase will cause the 
quantity demanded to drop to zero. 
When demand is perfectly elastic, 
the demand curve is a horizontal line.

or less than 1. When the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, economists 
say that demand is elastic. When the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, 
they say that demand is inelastic. The borderline case is unit - elastic demand, 
where the price elasticity of demand is—surprise—exactly 1.
To see why a price elasticity of demand equal to 1 is a useful dividing line, 
let’s consider a hypothetical example: a toll bridge operated by the state high-
way department. Other things equal, the number of drivers who use the bridge 
depends on the toll, the price the highway department charges for crossing the 
bridge: the higher the toll, the fewer the drivers who use the bridge.
Figure 6-3 shows three hypothetical demand curves—one in which demand is 
unit - elastic, one in which it is inelastic, and one in which it is elastic. In each case, 
point A shows the quantity demanded if the toll is $0.90 and point B shows the 
quantity demanded if the toll is $1.10. An increase in the toll from $0.90 to $1.10 
is an increase of 20% if we use the midpoint method to calculate percent changes.
Panel (a) shows what happens when the toll is raised from $0.90 to $1.10 and the 
demand curve is unit - elastic. Here the 20% price rise leads to a fall in the quantity

Panel (a) shows a case of unit - elastic 
demand: a 20% increase in price generates 
a 20% decline in quantity demanded, imply-
ing a price elasticity of demand of 1. Panel 
(b) shows a case of inelastic demand: a 20% 
increase in price generates a 10% decline in 
quantity demanded, implying a price elasticity 
of demand of 0.5. A case of elastic demand 
is shown in panel (c): a 20% increase in price 
causes a 40% decline in quantity demanded, 
implying a price elasticity of demand of 2. All 
percentages are calculated using the mid-
point method.
Demand is elastic if the price 
elasticity of demand is greater than 
1, inelastic if the price elasticity 
of demand is less than 1, and unit -
elastic if the price elasticity of 
demand is exactly 1.

of cars using the bridge each day from 1,100 to 900, which is a 20% decline (again 
using the midpoint method). So the price elasticity of demand is 20%/20% = 1.
Panel (b) shows a case of inelastic demand when the toll is raised from $0.90 
to $1.10. The same 20% price rise reduces the quantity demanded from 1,050 to 
950. That’s only a 10% decline, so in this case the price elasticity of demand is 
10%/20% = 0.5.
Panel (c) shows a case of elastic demand when the toll is raised from 
$0.90 to $1.10. The 20% price increase causes the quantity demanded to fall 
from 1,200 to 800—a 40% decline, so the price elasticity of demand is 40%/20% = 2.
Why does it matter whether demand is unit - elastic, inelastic, or elastic? 
Because this classification predicts how changes in the price of a good will affect 
the total revenue earned by producers from the sale of that good. In many real - 
life situations, such as the one faced by Med-Stat, it is crucial to know how price 
changes affect total revenue. Total revenue is defined as the total value of sales 
of a good or service, equal to the price multiplied by the quantity sold.
(6-6) Total revenue = Price × Quantity sold
Total revenue has a useful graphical representation that can help us understand 
why knowing the price elasticity of demand is crucial when we ask whether a price 
rise will increase or reduce total revenue. Panel (a) of Figure 6-4 shows the same 
demand curve as panel (a) of Figure 6-3. We see that 1,100 drivers will use the 
bridge if the toll is $0.90. So the total revenue at a price of $0.90 is $0.90 × 1,100 = 
$990. This value is equal to the area of the green rectangle, which is drawn with 
the bottom left corner at the point (0, 0) and the top right corner at (1,100, 0.90). 
In general, the total revenue at any given price is equal to the area of a rectangle 
whose height is the price and whose width is the quantity demanded at that price.
To get an idea of why total revenue is important, consider the following scenario. 
Suppose that the toll on the bridge is currently $0.90 but that the highway depart-
ment must raise extra money for road repairs. One way to do this is to raise the toll

The green rectangle in panel (a) represents total rev-
enue generated from 1,100 drivers who each pay a toll 
of $0.90. Panel (b) shows how total revenue is affected 
when the price increases from $0.90 to $1.10. Due to 
the quantity effect, total revenue falls by area A. Due to 
the price effect, total revenue increases by the area C. In 
general, the overall effect can go either way, depending 
on the price elasticity of demand.
The total revenue is the total value 
of sales of a good or service. It is 
equal to the price multiplied by the 
quantity sold.

on the bridge. But this plan might backfire, since a higher toll will reduce the num-
ber of drivers who use the bridge. And if traffic on the bridge dropped a lot, a higher 
toll would actually reduce total revenue instead of increasing it. So it’s important 
for the highway department to know how drivers will respond to a toll increase.
We can see graphically how the toll increase affects total bridge revenue by 
examining panel (b) of Figure 6-4. At a toll of $0.90, total revenue is given by the 
sum of the areas A and B. After the toll is raised to $1.10, total revenue is given by 
the sum of areas B and C. So when the toll is raised, revenue represented by area 
A is lost but revenue represented by area C is gained. 
These two areas have important interpretations. Area C represents the revenue 
gain that comes from the additional $0.20 paid by drivers who continue to use the 
bridge. That is, the 900 who continue to use the bridge contribute an additional $0.20 
× 900 = $180 per day to total revenue, represented by area C. But 200 drivers who 
would have used the bridge at a price of $0.90 no longer do so, generating a loss to 
total revenue of $0.90 × 200 = $180 per day, represented by area A. (In this particular 
example, because demand is unit-elastic—the same as in panel (a) of Figure 6-3—the 
rise in the toll has no effect on total revenue; areas A and C are the same size.)
Except in the rare case of a good with perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic demand, 
when a seller raises the price of a good, two countervailing effects are present:
 • A price effect: After a price increase, each unit sold sells at a higher price, 
which tends to raise revenue.
 • A quantity effect: After a price increase, fewer units are sold, which tends to 
lower revenue.
But then, you may ask, what is the ultimate net effect on total revenue: does it 
go up or down? The answer is that, in general, the effect on total revenue can go 
either way—a price rise may either increase total revenue or lower it. If the price 
effect, which tends to raise total revenue, is the stronger of the two effects, then 
total revenue goes up. If the quantity effect, which tends to reduce total revenue, 
is the stronger, then total revenue goes down. And if the strengths of the two 
effects are exactly equal—as in our toll bridge example, where a $180 gain offsets 
a $180 loss—total revenue is unchanged by the price increase.
The price elasticity of demand tells us what happens to total revenue when 
price changes: its size determines which effect—the price effect or the quantity 
effect—is stronger. Specifically:
 • If demand for a good is unit-elastic (the price elasticity of demand is 1), an 
increase in price does not change total revenue. In this case, the quantity 
effect and the price effect exactly offset each other.
 • If demand for a good is inelastic (the price elasticity of demand is less than 1), 
a higher price increases total revenue. In this case, the price effect is stronger 
than the quantity effect.
 • If demand for a good is  elastic (the price elasticity of demand is greater than 
1), an increase in price reduces total revenue. In this case, the quantity effect 
is stronger than the price effect.
Table 6-2 shows how the effect of a price increase on total revenue depends on 
the price elasticity of demand, using the same data as in Figure 6-3. An increase in 
the price from $0.90 to $1.10 leaves total revenue unchanged at $990 when demand 
is unit - elastic. When demand is inelastic, the price effect dominates the quantity 
effect; the same price increase leads to an increase in total revenue from $945 to 
$1,045. And when demand is elastic, the quantity effect dominates the price effect; 
the price increase leads to a decline in total revenue from $1,080 to $880.
The price elasticity of demand also predicts the effect of a fall in price on total 
revenue. When the price falls, the same two countervailing effects are present, but 
they work in the opposite directions as compared to the case of a price rise. There 

164    P A R T  2    S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D
is the price effect of a lower price per unit sold, which tends to lower revenue. This 
is countered by the quantity effect of more units sold, which tends to raise revenue. 
Which effect dominates depends on the price elasticity. Here is a quick summary:
 • When demand is unit - elastic, the two effects exactly balance; so a fall in price 
has no effect on total revenue.
 • When demand is inelastic, the price effect dominates the quantity effect; so a 
fall in price reduces total revenue.
 • When demand is elastic, the quantity effect dominates the price effect; so a fall 
in price increases total revenue.
Price Elasticity Along the Demand Curve
Suppose an economist says that “the price elasticity of demand for coffee is 0.25.” 
What he or she means is that at the current price the elasticity is 0.25. In the pre-
vious discussion of the toll bridge, what we were really describing was the elas-
ticity at the price of $0.90. Why this qualification? Because for the vast majority 
of demand curves, the price elasticity of demand at one point along the curve is 
different from the price elasticity of demand at other points along the same curve.
To see this, consider the table in Figure 6-5, which shows a hypothetical demand 
schedule. It also shows in the last column the total revenue generated at each price 
and quantity combination in the demand schedule. The upper panel of the graph in 
Figure 6-5 shows the corresponding demand curve. The lower panel illustrates the 
same data on total revenue: the height of a bar at each quantity demanded—which 
corresponds to a particular price—measures the total revenue generated at that price.
In Figure 6-5, you can see that when the price is low, raising the price 
increases total revenue: starting at a price of $1, raising the price to $2 increases 
total revenue from $9 to $16. This means that when the price is low, demand is 
inelastic. Moreover, you can see that demand is inelastic on the entire section of 
the demand curve from a price of $0 to a price of $5.
When the price is high, however, raising it further reduces total revenue: starting 
at a price of $8, raising the price to $9 reduces total revenue, from $16 to $9. This 
means that when the price is high, demand is elastic. Furthermore, you can see that 
demand is elastic over the section of the demand curve from a price of $5 to $10.
For the vast majority of goods, the price elasticity of demand changes along 
the demand curve. So whenever you measure a good’s elasticity, you are really 
measuring it at a particular point or section of the good’s demand curve.

What Factors Determine the Price Elasticity of Demand?
The flu vaccine shortfall of 2004–2005 allowed vaccine distributors to signifi-
cantly raise their prices for two important reasons: substitutes were very difficult 
to obtain, and for many people the vaccine was a medical necessity. 
People responded in various ways. Some paid the high prices, and some trav-
eled to Canada and other countries to get vaccinated. Some simply did without 
(and over time often changed their habits to avoid catching the flu, such as eat-
ing out less often and avoiding mass transit). This experience illustrates the four 
main factors that determine elasticity: the availability of close substitutes, wheth-
er the good is a necessity or a luxury, the share of income a consumer spends on 
the good, and how much time has elapsed since the price change. We’ll briefly 
examine each of these factors.
The Availability of Close Substitutes The price elasticity of demand tends 
to be high if there are other readily available goods that consumers regard as 
similar and would be willing to consume instead. The price elasticity of demand 
tends to be low if there are no close substitutes or they are very difficult to obtain.

 Demand Schedule and Total Revenue 
for a Linear Demand Curve
Price
The upper panel shows a demand curve corre-
sponding to the demand schedule in the table. 
The lower panel shows how total revenue 
changes along that demand curve: at each 
price and quantity combination, the height of 
the bar represents the total revenue gener-
ated. You can see that at a low price, raising 
the price increases total revenue. So demand 
is inelastic at low prices. At a high price, how-
ever, a rise in price reduces total revenue. So 
demand is elastic at high prices.

Whether the Good Is a Necessity or a Luxury The 
price elasticity of demand tends to be low if a good is 
something you must have, like a life - saving medicine. The 
price elasticity of demand tends to be high if the good is a 
luxury—something you can easily live without.
Share of Income Spent on the Good The price 
elasticity of demand tends to be low when spending on a 
good accounts for a small share of a consumer’s income. 
In that case, a significant change in the price of the good 
has little impact on how much the consumer spends. In 
contrast, when a good accounts for a significant share of 
a consumer’s spending, the consumer is likely to be very 
responsive to a change in price. In this case, the price elas-
ticity of demand is high.
Time Elapsed Since Price Change In general, the 
price elasticity of demand tends to increase as consumers have more time to 
adjust to a price change. This means that the long - run price elasticity of demand 
is often higher than the short- run elasticity.
A good illustration of the effect of time on the elasticity of demand is drawn 
from the 1970s, the first time gasoline prices increased dramatically in the United 
States. Initially, consumption fell very little because there were no close substi-
tutes for gasoline and because driving their cars was necessary for people to 
carry out the ordinary tasks of life. Over time, however, Americans changed their 
habits in ways that enabled them to gradually reduce their gasoline consumption. 
The result was a steady decline in gasoline consumption over the next decade, 
even though the price of gasoline did not continue to rise, confirming that the 
long-run price elasticity of demand for gasoline was indeed much larger than the 
short - run elasticity.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
RESPONDING TO YOUR TUITION BILL
C
ollege costs more than ever—and not just because of inflation. Tuition 
has been rising faster than the overall cost of living for years. But does 
rising tuition keep people from going to college? Two studies found that the 
answer depends on the type of college. Both studies assessed 
how responsive the decision to go to college is to a change 
in tuition.
A 1988 study found that a 3% increase in tuition led to 
an approximately 2% fall in the number of students enrolled 
at four-year institutions, giving a price elasticity of demand 
of 0.67 (2%/3%). In the case of two-year institutions, the 
study found a significantly higher response: a 3% increase in 
tuition led to a 2.7% fall in enrollments, giving a price elas-
ticity of demand of 0.9. In other words, the enrollment deci-
sion for students at two-year colleges was significantly more 
responsive to price than for students at four-year colleges. 
The result: students at two-year colleges are more likely to 
forgo getting a degree because of tuition costs than students 
at four-year colleges.
A 1999 study confirmed this pattern. In comparison to four-
year colleges, it found that two-year college enrollment rates 
were significantly more responsive to changes in state financial

aid (a decline in aid leading to a decline in enrollments), a predictable effect given 
these students’ greater sensitivity to the cost of tuition. Another piece of evidence 
suggests that students at two-year colleges are more likely to be paying their own 
way and making a trade - off between attending college versus working: the study 
found that enrollments at two-year colleges are much more responsive to changes 
in the unemployment rate (an increase in the unemployment rate leading to an 
increase in enrollments) than enrollments at four-year colleges. So is the cost of 
tuition a barrier to getting a college degree in the United States? Yes, but more so 
at two-year colleges than for students at four-year colleges.
Interestingly, the 1999 study found that for both two-year and four-year col-
leges, price sensitivity of demand had fallen somewhat since the 1988 study. One 
possible explanation is that because the value of a college education has risen 
considerably over time, fewer people forgo college, even if tuition goes up. And the 
price elasticity of demand for education has remained low. A 2008 study estimates 
that the price elasticity of demand for education at four-year institutions may be 
as low as 0.11. (Source note on copyright page.)

Other Demand Elasticities
T
he quantity of a good demanded depends not only on the price of that good 
but also on other variables. In particular, demand curves shift because of 
changes in the prices of related goods and changes in consumers’ incomes. 
It is often important to have a measure of these other effects, and the best mea-
sures are—you guessed it—elasticities. Specifically, we can best measure how the 
demand for a good is affected by prices of other goods using a measure called the 
cross - price elasticity of demand, and we can best measure how demand is affected 
by changes in income using the income elasticity of demand.
The Cross - Price Elasticity of Demand
In Chapter 3 you learned that the demand for a good is often affected by the 
prices of other, related goods—goods that are substitutes or complements. 
There you saw that a change in the price of a related good shifts the demand 
curve of the original good, reflecting a change in the quantity demanded at any 
given price. The strength of such a “cross” effect on demand can be measured 
by the cross-price elasticity of demand, defined as the ratio of the percent 
change in the quantity demanded of one good to the percent change in the price 
of the other.
 Quick Review
• Demand is perfectly inelastic if it is 
completely unresponsive to price. It 
is perfectly elastic if it is infinitely 
responsive to price.
• Demand is elastic if the price elas-
ticity of demand is greater than 1. 
It is inelastic if the price elastic-
ity of demand is less than 1. It is 
unit- elastic if the price elasticity of 
demand is exactly 1.
• When demand is elastic, the 
quantity effect of a price increase 
dominates the price effect and total 
revenue falls. When demand is 
inelastic, the price effect of a price 
increase dominates the quantity 
effect and total revenue rises.
• Because the price elasticity of demand 
can change along the demand curve, 
economists refer to a particular point 
on the demand curve when speaking 
of “the” price elasticity of demand.
• Ready availability of close substi-
tutes makes demand for a good 
more elastic, as does the length 
of time elapsed since the price 
change. Demand for a necessity is 
less elastic, and demand for a lux-
ury good is more elastic. Demand 
tends to be inelastic for goods that 
absorb a small share of a consum-
er’s income and elastic for goods 
that absorb a large share of income.
The cross - price elasticity of 
demand between two goods 
measures the effect of the change 
in one good’s price on the quantity 
demanded of the other good. It is 
equal to the percent change in the 
quantity demanded of one good 
divided by the percent change in the 
other good’s price.

(6-7) Cross - price elasticity of demand between goods A and B 
= % change in quantity of A demanded
% change in price of B
When two goods are substitutes, like hot dogs and hamburgers, the cross - 
price elasticity of demand is positive: a rise in the price of hot dogs increases the 
demand for hamburgers—that is, it causes a rightward shift of the demand curve 
for hamburgers. If the goods are close substitutes, the cross - price elasticity will 
be positive and large; if they are not close substitutes, the cross - price elasticity 
will be positive and small. So when the cross - price elasticity of demand is posi-
tive, its size is a measure of how closely substitutable the two goods are.
When two goods are complements, like hot dogs and hot dog buns, the cross - 
price elasticity is negative: a rise in the price of hot dogs decreases the demand for 
hot dog buns—that is, it causes a leftward shift of the demand curve for hot dog 
buns. As with substitutes, the size of the cross - price elasticity of demand between 
two complements tells us how strongly complementary they are: if the cross - price 
elasticity is only slightly below zero, they are weak complements; if it is very nega-
tive, they are strong complements.
Note that in the case of the cross - price elasticity of demand, the sign (plus or 
minus) is very important: it tells us whether the two goods are complements or substi-
tutes. So we cannot drop the minus sign as we did for the price elasticity of demand.
Our discussion of the cross - price elasticity of demand is a useful place to 
return to a point we made earlier: elasticity is a unit - free measure—that is, it 
doesn’t depend on the units in which goods are measured.
To see the potential problem, suppose someone told you that “if the price of 
hot dog buns rises by $0.30, Americans will buy 10 million fewer hot dogs this 
year.” If you’ve ever bought hot dog buns, you’ll immediately wonder: is that 
a $0.30 increase in the price per bun, or is it a $0.30 increase in the price per 
package (buns are usually sold in packages of eight)? It makes a big difference 
what units we are talking about! However, if someone says that the cross - price 
elasticity of demand between buns and hot dogs is −0.3, it doesn’t matter whether 
buns are sold individually or by the package. So elasticity is defined as a ratio of 
percent changes, as a way of making sure that confusion over units doesn’t arise.
The Income Elasticity of Demand
The income elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the demand for 
a good is affected by changes in consumers’ incomes. It allows us to determine 
whether a good is a normal or inferior good as well as to measure how intensely 
the demand for the good responds to changes in income.
(6-8) Income elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in income
 
Just as the cross - price elasticity of demand between two goods can be either 
positive or negative, depending on whether the goods are substitutes or comple-
ments, the income elasticity of demand for a good can also be either positive 
or negative. Recall from Chapter 3 that goods can be either normal goods, for 
which demand increases when income rises, or inferior goods, for which demand 
decreases when income rises. These definitions relate directly to the sign of the 
income elasticity of demand:
 • When the income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is a normal good. 
In this case, the quantity demanded at any given price increases as income 
increases.
 • When the income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is an inferior 
good. In this case, the quantity demanded at any given price decreases as 
income increases.
The income elasticity of demand 
is the percent change in the 
quantity of a good demanded when 
a consumer’s income changes 
divided by the percent change in the 
consumer’s income.

Economists often use estimates of the income elasticity of demand to pre-
dict which industries will grow most rapidly as the incomes of consumers grow 
over time. In doing this, they often find it useful to make a further distinc-
tion among normal goods, identifying which are income - elastic and which are 
income- inelastic.
The demand for a good is income - elastic if the income elasticity of demand for 
that good is greater than 1. When income rises, the demand for income - elastic goods 
rises faster than income. Luxury goods such as second homes and international 
In the days of the Founding Fathers, the 
great majority of Americans lived on farms. 
As recently as the 1940s, one American in 
six—or approximately 17%—still did. But 
in 1991, the last year the U.S. government 
collected data on the population of farm-
ers, the official number was 1.9%. Why 
do so few people now live and work on 
farms in the United States? There are two 
main reasons, both involving elasticities.
First, the income elasticity of demand 
for food is much less than 1—it is 
income-inelastic. As consumers grow 
richer, other things equal, spending on 
food rises less than income. As a result, 
as the U.S. economy has grown, the 
share of income it spends on food—and 
therefore the share of total U.S. income 
earned by farmers—has fallen.
Second, the demand for food is price-
inelastic. This is important because 
technological advances in American 
agriculture have steadily raised yields 
over time and led to a long-term trend 
of lower U.S. food prices for most of the 
past century and a half. The combination 
of price inelasticity and falling prices led 
to falling total revenue for farmers. That’s 
right: progress in farming has been good 
for American consumers but bad for 
American farmers.
The combination of these effects 
explains the long-term relative decline 
of farming in the United States. The low 
income elasticity of demand for food 
ensures that the income of farmers 
grows more slowly than the economy as 
a whole. And the combination of rapid 
technological progress in farming with 
price-inelastic demand for foodstuffs 
reinforces this effect, further reducing 
the growth of farm income.
That is, up until now. Starting in the 
mid-2000s, increased demand for food-
stuffs from rapidly growing developing 
countries like China has pushed up the 
prices of agricultural products around 
the world. And American farmers have 
benefited, with U.S. farm income rising 
24% in 2010 alone. Eventually, as the 
growth in developing countries tapers 
off and agricultural innovation continues 
to progress, it’s likely that the agricultural 
sector will resume its downward trend. 
But for now and for the foreseeable 
future, American farmers are enjoying 
the sector’s revival. 
FOR INQUIRING MINDS
WILL CHINA SAVE THE U.S. FARMING SECTOR?
F
If the income elasticity of demand for food is less than 
1, we would expect to find that people in poor countries 
spend a larger share of their income on food than people 
in rich countries. And that’s exactly what the data show. 
In this graph, we compare per capita income—a country’s 
total income, divided by the population—with the share of 
income that is spent on food. (To make the graph a man-
ageable size, per capita income is measured as a percent-
age of U.S. per capita income.) In very poor countries, like 
Sri Lanka, people spend most of their income on food. In 
middle - income countries, like Israel, the share of spending 
that goes to food is much lower. And it’s even lower in rich 
countries, like the United States.

he U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics carries out extensive surveys of how families 
spend their incomes. This is not just a matter of intellectual curiosity. Quite a 
few government benefit programs involve some adjustment for changes in the cost 
of living; to estimate those changes, the government must know how people spend 
their money. But an additional payoff to these surveys is data 
on the income elasticity of demand for various goods.
What stands out from these studies? The classic result is 
that the income elasticity of demand for “food eaten at home” 
is considerably less than 1: as a family’s income rises, the 
share of its income spent on food consumed at home falls. 
Correspondingly, the lower a family’s income, the higher the 
share of income spent on food consumed at home. 
In poor countries, many families spend more than half 
their income on food consumed at home. Although the 
income elasticity of demand for “food eaten at home” is 
estimated at less than 0.5 in the United States, the income 
elasticity of demand for “food eaten away from home” (res-
taurant meals) is estimated to be much higher—close to 1. 
Families with higher incomes eat out more often and at 
fancier places. In 1950, about 19% of U.S. income was spent 
on food consumed at home, a number that has dropped to 
7% today. But over the same time period, the share of U.S. income spent on food 
consumed away from home has stayed constant at 5%. In fact, a sure sign of ris-
ing income levels in developing countries is the arrival of fast - food restaurants 
that cater to newly affluent customers. For example, McDonald’s can now be 
found in Jakarta, Shanghai, and Mumbai.
There is one clear example of an inferior good found in the surveys: rental hous-
ing. Families with higher income actually spend less on rent than families with 
lower income, because they are much more likely to own their own homes. And the 
category identified as “other housing”—which basically means second homes—is 
highly income - elastic. Only higher - income families can afford a luxury like a vaca-
tion home, so “other housing” has an income elasticity of demand greater than 1.

The Price Elasticity of Supply
I
n the wake of the flu vaccine shortfall of 2004, attempts by vaccine distribu-
tors to drive up the price of vaccines would have been much less effective if a 
higher price had induced a large increase in the output of flu vaccines by flu 
vaccine manufacturers other than Chiron. In fact, if the rise in price had precipi-
tated a significant increase in flu vaccine production, the price would have been 
pushed back down. But that didn’t happen because, as we mentioned earlier, it 
would have been far too costly and technically difficult to produce more vaccine 
for the 2004–2005 flu season. (In reality, the production of flu vaccine begins a 
year before distribution.) 
This was another critical element in the ability of some flu vaccine distribu-
tors, like Med-Stat, to get significantly higher prices by restricting supply of 
their product: a low responsiveness in the quantity of output supplied to the 
higher price of flu vaccine by flu vaccine producers. To measure the response of 
producers to price changes, we need a measure parallel to the price elasticity of 
demand—the price elasticity of supply.
Measuring the Price Elasticity of Supply
The price elasticity of supply is defined the same way as the price elasticity of 
demand (although there is no minus sign to be eliminated here):
(6-9) Price elasticity of supply = % change in quantity supplied
% change in price
The only difference is that here we consider movements along the supply curve 
rather than movements along the demand curve.
Suppose that the price of tomatoes rises by 10%. If the quantity of toma-
toes supplied also increases by 10% in response, the price elasticity of supply 
of tomatoes is 1 (10%/10%) and supply is unit - elastic. If the quantity supplied 
increases by 5%, the price elasticity of supply is 0.5 and supply is inelastic; 
if the quantity increases by 20%, th=ce elasticity of supply is 2 and supply is 
elastic.
As in the case of demand, the extreme values of the price elasticity of supply 
have a simple graphical representation. Panel (a) of Figure 6-6 shows the supply 
of cell phone frequencies, the portion of the radio spectrum that is suitable for 
sending and receiving cell phone signals. Governments own the right to sell the 
use of this part of the radio spectrum to cell phone operators inside their borders. 
But governments can’t increase or decrease the number of cell phone frequencies 
that they have to offer—for technical reasons, the quantity of frequencies suitable 
for cell phone operation is a fixed quantity. 
So the supply curve for cell phone frequencies is a vertical line, which 
we have assumed is set at the quantity of 100 frequencies. As you move 
up and down that curve, the change in the quantity supplied by the govern-
ment is zero, whatever the change in price. So panel (a) illustrates a case 
in which the price elasticity of supply is zero. This is a case of perfectly 
inelastic supply.
Panel (b) shows the supply curve for pizza. We suppose that it costs $12 to 
produce a pizza, including all opportunity costs. At any price below $12, it would 
be unprofitable to produce pizza and all the pizza parlors in America would go 
out of business. Alternatively, there are many producers who could operate pizza 
parlors if they were profitable. The ingredients—flour, tomatoes, cheese—are 
plentiful. And if necessary, more tomatoes could be grown, more milk could be 
produced to make mozzarella, and so on. So any price above $12 would elicit an 
extremely large quantity of pizzas supplied. The implied supply curve is therefore 
a horizontal line at $12. 
The price elasticity of supply is 
a mea sure of the responsiveness of 
the quantity of a good supplied to 
the price of that good. It is the ratio 
of the percent change in the quantity 
supplied to the percent change 
in the price as we move along the 
supply curve.
There is perfectly inelastic 
supply when the price elasticity 
of supply is zero, so that changes 
in the price of the good have no 
effect on the quantity supplied. A 
perfectly inelastic supply curve is a 
vertical line.

Since even a tiny increase in the price would lead to a huge increase in the 
quantity supplied, the price elasticity of supply would be more or less infinite. 
This is a case of perfectly elastic supply.
As our cell phone frequencies and pizza examples suggest, real - world instanc-
es of both perfectly inelastic and perfectly elastic supply are easy to find—much 
easier than their counterparts in demand.
What Factors Determine the Price Elasticity of Supply?
Our examples tell us the main determinant of the price elasticity of supply: the 
availability of inputs. In addition, as with the price elasticity of demand, time 
may also play a role in the price elasticity of supply. Here we briefly summarize 
the two factors.
The Availability of Inputs The price elasticity of supply tends to be large 
when inputs are readily available and can be shifted into and out of produc-
tion at a relatively low cost. It tends to be small when inputs are difficult to 
obtain—and can be shifted into and out of production only at a relatively 
high cost.
Time The price elasticity of supply tends to grow larger as producers have more 
time to respond to a price change. This means that the long - run price elasticity 
of supply is often higher than the short - run elasticity. (In the case of the flu vac-
cine shortfall, time was the crucial element because flu vaccine must be grown in 
cultures over many months.)
The price elasticity of pizza supply is very high because the inputs needed 
to expand the industry are readily available. The price elasticity of cell phone 
frequencies is zero because an essential input—the radio spectrum—cannot be 
increased at all.

zero: the quantity supplied is always the same, regard-

ply curve, which is a horizontal line. At a price of $12, 
producers will supply any quantity, but they will supply 
none at a price below $12. If price rises above $12, 
they will supply an extremely large quantity.
There is perfectly elastic supply 
when even a tiny increase or 
reduction in the price will lead to 
very large changes in the quantity 
supplied, so that the price elasticity 
of supply is infinite. A perfectly elastic 
supply curve is a horizontal line.

Many industries are like pizza production and have large price elasticities of 
supply: they can be readily expanded because they don’t require any special or 
unique resources. In contrast, the price elasticity of supply is usually substan-
tially less than perfectly elastic for goods that involve limited natural resources: 
minerals like gold or copper, agricultural products like coffee that flourish only 
on certain types of land, and renewable resources like ocean fish that can only 
be exploited up to a point without destroying the resource.
But given enough time, producers are often able to significantly change 
the amount they produce in response to a price change, even when production 
involves a limited natural resource. For example, consider again the effects of 
a surge in flu vaccine prices, but this time focus on the supply response. If the 
price were to rise to $90 per vaccination and stay there for a number of years, 
there would almost certainly be a substantial increase in flu vaccine production. 
Producers such as Chiron would eventually respond by increasing the size of their 
manufacturing plants, hiring more lab technicians, and so on. But significantly 
enlarging the capacity of a biotech manufacturing lab takes several years, not 
weeks or months or even a single year. 
For this reason, economists often make a distinction between the short - run 
elasticity of supply, usually referring to a few weeks or months, and the long - run 
elasticity of supply, usually referring to several years. In most industries, the 
long-run elasticity of supply is larger than the short - run elasticity.

EUROPEAN FARM SURPLUSES
O
ne of the policies we analyzed in Chapter 5 was the imposition of a price 
floor, a lower limit below which price of a good could not fall. We saw that 
price floors are often used by governments to support the incomes of farmers but 
create large unwanted surpluses of farm products. The most dramatic example 
of this is found in the European Union, where price floors have created a “butter 
mountain,” a “wine lake,” and so on.
Were European politicians unaware that their price floors would create huge 
surpluses? They probably knew that surpluses would arise but underestimated 
the price elasticity of agricultural supply. In fact, when the agricultural price sup-
ports were put in place, many analysts thought they were unlikely to lead to big 
increases in production. After all, European countries are densely populated and 
there is little new land available for cultivation.
What the analysts failed to realize, however, was how much farm production 
could expand by adding other resources, especially fertilizer and pesticides, which 
were readily available. So although European farm acreage didn’t increase much in 
response to the imposition of price floors, European farm production did!

• The price elasticity of supply is the 
percent change in the quantity sup-
plied divided by the percent change 
in the price.
• Under perfectly inelastic supply, 
the quantity supplied is completely 
unresponsive to price and the sup-
ply curve is a vertical line. Under 
perfectly elastic supply, the supply 
curve is horizontal at some specific 
price. If the price falls below that 
level, the quantity supplied is zero. If 
the price rises above that level, the 
quantity supplied is extremely large.
• The price elasticity of supply 
depends on the availability of 
inputs, the ease of shifting inputs 
into and out of alternative uses, 
and the period of time that has 
elapsed since the price change.

The recession that began in 2008 hit the airline industry very hard as both busi-
nesses and households cut back their travel plans. According to the International 
Air Transport Association, the industry lost $11 billion in 2008. However, by 2009, 
despite the fact that the economy was still extremely weak and airline traffic was 
still well below normal, the industry’s profitability began to rebound. And by 
2010, even in the midst of continued economic weakness, the airline industry’s 
prospects had definitely recovered, with the industry achieving an $8.9 billion 
profit that year. As Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines said, “The industry is 
in the best position—certainly in a decade—to post profitability.” 
How did the airline industry achieve such a dramatic turnaround? Simple: 
fly less and charge more. In 2011, fares were 14% higher than they had been the 
previous year, and flights were more crowded than they had been in decades, with 
fewer than one in five seats empty on domestic flights. 
In addition to cutting back on the number of flights—particularly money-
losing ones—airlines implemented more extreme variations in ticket prices based 
on when a flight departed and when the ticket was purchased. For example, the 
cheapest day to fly is Wednesday, with Friday and Saturday the most expensive 
days to travel. The first flight of the morning (the one that requires you to get up 
at 4 A.M.) is cheaper than flights departing the rest of the day. And the cheapest 
time to buy a ticket is Tuesday at 3 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, with tickets pur-
chased over the weekend carrying the highest prices. 
And it doesn’t stop there. As every beleaguered traveler knows, airlines have 
tacked on a wide variety of new fees and increased old ones—fees for food, for a 
blanket, for checked bags, for carry-on bags, for the right to board a flight first, 
for the right to choose your seat in advance, and so on. Airlines have also gotten 
more inventive in imposing fees that are hard for travelers to track in advance—
such as claiming that fares have not risen during the holidays while imposing a 
“holiday surcharge.” In 2010, airlines collected more than $4.3 billion from fees 
for checking baggage and changing tickets, up 13.5% from 2009. 
But the question in the minds of industry analysts is whether airlines can 
manage to maintain their currently high levels of profitability. In the past, as 
travel demand picked up, airlines increased capacity—added seats—too quickly, 
leading to falling airfares. “The wild card is always capacity discipline,” says 
William Swelbar, an airline industry researcher. “All it takes is one carrier to 
begin to add capacity aggressively, and then we follow and we undo all the good 
work that’s been done.” 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. How would you describe the price elasticity of demand for airline flights given the informa-
tion in this case? Explain. 
 2. Using the concept of elasticity, explain why airlines would create such great variations in 
the price of a ticket depending on when it is purchased and the day and time the flight 
departs. Assume that some people are willing to spend time shopping for deals as well as 
fly at inconvenient times, but others are not.
 3. Using the concept of elasticity, explain why airlines have imposed fees on things such as 
checked bags. Why might they try to hide or disguise fees?
 4. Use an elasticity concept to explain under what conditions the airline industry will be able 
to maintain its high profitability in the future. Explain.

SUMMARY
 1. Many economic questions depend on the size of con-
sumer or producer responses to changes in prices 
or other variables. Elasticity is a general measure 
of responsiveness that can be used to answer such 
questions.
 2. The price elasticity of demand—the percent change 
in the quantity demanded divided by the percent 
change in the price (dropping the minus sign)—is a 
measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demand-
ed to changes in the price. In practical calculations, it 
is usually best to use the midpoint method, which 
calculates percent changes in prices and quantities 
based on the average of starting and final values.
 3. The responsiveness of the quantity demanded to price 
can range from perfectly inelastic demand, where 
the quantity demanded is unaffected by the price, to 
perfectly elastic demand, where there is a unique 
price at which consumers will buy as much or as little 
as they are offered. When demand is perfectly inelastic, 
the demand curve is a vertical line; when it is perfectly 
elastic, the demand curve is a horizontal line.
 4. The price elasticity of demand is classified accord-
ing to whether it is more or less than 1. If it is greater 
than 1, demand is elastic; if it is less than 1, demand 
is inelastic; if it is exactly 1, demand is unit - elastic. 
This classification determines how total revenue, the 
total value of sales, changes when the price changes. 
If demand is elastic, total revenue falls when the 
price increases and rises when the price decreases. If 
demand is inelastic, total revenue rises when the price 
increases and falls when the price decreases.
 5. The price elasticity of demand depends on whether 
there are close substitutes for the good in question, 
whether the good is a necessity or a luxury, the share 
of income spent on the good, and the length of time 
that has elapsed since the price change.
 6. The cross - price elasticity of demand measures 
the effect of a change in one good’s price on the 
quantity of another good demanded. The cross - price 
elasticity of demand can be positive, in which case the 
goods are substitutes, or negative, in which case they 
are complements.
 7. The income elasticity of demand is the percent 
change in the quantity of a good demanded when a 
consumer’s income changes divided by the percent 
change in income. The income elasticity of demand 
indicates how intensely the demand for a good 
responds to changes in income. It can be negative; 
in that case the good is an inferior good. Goods with 
positive income elasticities of demand are normal 
goods. If the income elasticity is greater than 1, a good 
is income - elastic; if it is positive and less than 1, the 
good is income - inelastic.
 8. The price elasticity of supply is the percent change 
in the quantity of a good supplied divided by the per-
cent change in the price. If the quantity supplied does 
not change at all, we have an instance of perfectly 
inelastic supply; the supply curve is a vertical line. If 
the quantity supplied is zero below some price but infi-
nite above that price, we have an instance of perfectly 
elastic supply; the supply curve is a horizontal line.
 9. The price elasticity of supply depends on the availabil-
ity of resources to expand production and on time. It is 
higher when inputs are available at relatively low cost 
and the longer the time elapsed since the price change.

PROBLEMS
 1. Nile.com, the online bookseller, wants to increase its 
total revenue. One strategy is to offer a 10% discount 
on every book it sells. Nile.com knows that its custom-
ers can be divided into two distinct groups according 
to their likely responses to the discount. The accompa-
nying table shows how the two groups respond to the 
discount.
Group A 
(sales per week)
Group B 
(sales per week)
Volume of sales before 
the 10% discount
1.55 million
1.50 million
Volume of sales after 
the 10% discount
1.65 million
1.70 million

 a. Using the midpoint method, calculate the price elas-
ticities of demand for group A and group B.
 b. Explain how the discount will affect total revenue 
from each group.
 c. Suppose Nile.com knows which group each cus-
tomer belongs to when he or she logs on and can 
choose whether or not to offer the 10% discount. If 
Nile.com wants to increase its total revenue, should 
discounts be offered to group A or to group B, to 
neither group, or to both groups?
 2. Do you think the price elasticity of demand for Ford 
sport - utility vehicles (SUVs) will increase, decrease, 
or remain the same when each of the following events 
occurs? Explain your answer.
 a. Other car manufacturers, such as General Motors, 
decide to make and sell SUVs.
 b. SUVs produced in foreign countries are banned 
from the American market.
 c. Due to ad campaigns, Americans believe that SUVs 
are much safer than ordinary passenger cars.
 d. The time period over which you measure the 
elasticity lengthens. During that longer time, 
new models such as four - wheel - drive cargo 
vans appear.
 3. In the United States, 2007 was a bad year for growing 
wheat. And as wheat supply decreased, the price of 
wheat rose dramatically, leading to a lower quantity 
demanded (a movement along the demand curve). The 
accompanying table describes what happened to prices 
and the quantity of wheat demanded.

ticity of demand for winter wheat.
 b. What is the total revenue for U.S. wheat farmers in 
2006 and 2007?
 c. Did the bad harvest increase or decrease the total 
revenue of U.S. wheat farmers? How could you have 
predicted this from your answer to part a?
 4. The accompanying table gives part of the supply sched-
ule for personal computers in the United States.
Price of computer

 a. Calculate the price elasticity of supply when the 
price increases from $900 to $1,100 using the mid-
point method.
 b. Suppose firms produce 1,000 more computers at 
any given price due to improved technology. As price 
increases from $900 to $1,100, is the price elasticity 
of supply now greater than, less than, or the same as 
it was in part a?
 c. Suppose a longer time period under consideration 
means that the quantity supplied at any given price 
is 20% higher than the figures given in the table. As 
price increases from $900 to $1,100, is the price elas-
ticity of supply now greater than, less than, or the 
same as it was in part a?
 5. The accompanying table lists the cross - price elas-
ticities of demand for several goods, where the percent 
quantity change is measured for the first good of the

ticities. What does it imply about the relationship 
between the two goods in question?
 b. Compare the absolute values of the cross - price elas-
ticities and explain their magnitudes. For example,

 6. What can you conclude about the price elasticity of 
demand in each of the following statements?
 a. “The pizza delivery business in this town is very 
competitive. I’d lose half my customers if I raised 
the price by as little as 10%.”
 b. “I owned both of the two Jerry Garcia autographed 
lithographs in existence. I sold one on eBay for a 
high price. But when I sold the second one, the price 
dropped by 80%.”
 c. “My economics professor has chosen to use the 
Krugman/Wells textbook for this class. I have no 
choice but to buy this book.”
 d. “I always spend a total of exactly $10 per week on 
coffee.”
 7. Take a linear demand curve like that shown in Figure 
6-5, where the range of prices for which demand is 
elastic and inelastic is labeled. In each of the follow-
ing scenarios, the supply curve shifts. Show along 
which portion of the demand curve (that is, the elas-
tic or the inelastic portion) the supply curve must

have shifted in order to generate the event described. 
In each case, show on the diagram the quantity effect 
and the price effect.
 a. Recent attempts by the Colombian army to stop 
the flow of illegal drugs into the United States have 
actually benefited drug dealers.
 b. New construction increased the number of seats in 
the football stadium and resulted in greater total 
revenue from box - office ticket sales.
 c. A fall in input prices has led to higher output 
of Porsches. But total revenue for the Porsche 
Company has declined as a result.
 8. The accompanying table shows the price and yearly 
quantity sold of souvenir T-shirts in the town of 
Crystal Lake according to the average income of the 
tourists visiting.

ticity of demand when the price of a T-shirt rises 
from $5 to $6 and the average tourist income is 
$20,000. Also calculate it when the average tourist 
income is $30,000.
 b. Using the midpoint method, calculate the income 
elasticity of demand when the price of a T-shirt is 
$4 and the average tourist income increases from 
$20,000 to $30,000. Also calculate it when the price 
is $7.
 9. A recent study determined the following elasticities for 
Volkswagen Beetles:
Price elasticity of demand = 2
Income elasticity of demand = 1.5
The supply of Beetles is elastic. Based on this informa-
tion, are the following statements true or false? Explain 
your reasoning.
 a. A 10% increase in the price of a Beetle will reduce 
the quantity demanded by 20%.
 b. An increase in consumer income will increase the 
price and quantity of Beetles sold. Since price elas-
ticity of demand is greater than 1, total revenue will 
go down.
 10. In each of the following cases, do you think the price 
elasticity of supply is (i) perfectly elastic; (ii) perfectly 
inelastic; (iii) elastic, but not perfectly elastic; or (iv) 
inelastic, but not perfectly inelastic? Explain using a 
diagram.
 a. An increase in demand this summer for luxury 
cruises leads to a huge jump in the sales price of a 
cabin on the Queen Mary 2.
 b. The price of a kilowatt of electricity is the same dur-
ing periods of high electricity demand as during 
periods of low electricity demand.
 c. Fewer people want to fly during February than dur-
ing any other month. The airlines cancel about 10% 
of their flights as ticket prices fall about 20% during 
this month.
 d. Owners of vacation homes in Maine rent them 
out during the summer. Due to the soft economy 
this year, a 30% decline in the price of a vacation 
rental leads more than half of homeowners to 
occupy their vacation homes themselves during 
the summer.
 11. Use an elasticity concept to explain each of the follow-
ing observations.
 a. During economic booms, the number of new person-
al care businesses, such as gyms and tanning salons, 
is proportionately greater than the number of other 
new businesses, such as grocery stores.
 b. Cement is the primary building material in Mexico. 
After new technology makes cement cheaper to 
produce, the supply curve for the Mexican cement 
industry becomes relatively flatter.
 c. Some goods that were once considered luxuries, like 
a telephone, are now considered virtual necessities. 
As a result, the demand curve for telephone services 
has become steeper over time.
 d. Consumers in a less developed country like 
Guatemala spend proportionately more of their 
income on equipment for producing things at home, 
like sewing machines, than consumers in a more 
developed country like Canada.
 12. Taiwan is a major world supplier of semiconductor 
chips. A recent earthquake severely damaged the pro-
duction facilities of Taiwanese chip - producing compa-
nies, sharply reducing the amount of chips they could 
produce.
 a. Assume that the total revenue of a typical non - 
Taiwanese chip manufacturer rises due to these 
events. In terms of an elasticity, what must be true 
for this to happen? Illustrate the change in total rev-
enue with a diagram, indicating the price effect and 
the quantity effect of the Taiwan earthquake on this 
company’s total revenue.
 b. Now assume that the total revenue of a typical non- 
Taiwanese chip manufacturer falls due to these 
events. In terms of an elasticity, what must be true 
for this to happen? Illustrate the change in total rev-
enue with a diagram, indicating the price effect and 
the quantity effect of the Taiwan earthquake on this 
company’s total revenue.
 13. There is a debate about whether sterile hypodermic 
needles should be passed out free of charge in cities 
with high drug use. Proponents argue that doing so 
will reduce the incidence of diseases, such as HIV/
AIDS, that are often spread by needle sharing among 
drug users. Opponents believe that doing so will 
encourage more drug use by reducing the risks of this 

C H A P T E R  6    E L A S T I C I T Y    179

behavior. As an economist asked to assess the policy, 
you must know the following: (i) how responsive the 
spread of diseases like HIV/AIDS is to the price of 
sterile needles and (ii) how responsive drug use is to 
the price of sterile needles. Assuming that you know 
these two things, use the concepts of price elasticity of 
demand for sterile needles and the cross - price elastic-
ity between drugs and sterile needles to answer the 
following questions.
 a. In what circumstances do you believe this is a ben-
eficial policy?
 b. In what circumstances do you believe this is a bad 
policy?
 14. Worldwide, the average coffee grower has increased 
the amount of acreage under cultivation over the past 
few years. The result has been that the average coffee 
plantation produces significantly more coffee than it 
did 10 to 20 years ago. Unfortunately for the growers, 
however, this has also been a period in which their 
total revenues have plunged. In terms of an elasticity, 
what must be true for these events to have occurred? 
Illustrate these events with a diagram, indicating the 
quantity effect and the price effect that gave rise to 
these events.
 15. A recent report by the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), published in the 
CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, studied 
the effect of an increase in the price of beer on the 
incidence of new cases of sexually transmitted dis-
ease in young adults. In particular, the researchers 
analyzed the responsiveness of gonorrhea cases to a 
tax - induced increase in the price of beer. The report 
concluded that “the . . . analysis suggested that a 
beer tax increase of $0.20 per six - pack could reduce 
overall gonorrhea rates by 8.9%.” Assume that a six -
pack costs $5.90 before the price increase. Use the 
midpoint method to determine the percent increase 
in the price of a six - pack, and then calculate the 
cross - price elasticity of demand between beer and 
incidence of gonorrhea. According to your estimate 
of this cross - price elasticity of demand, are beer and 
gonorrhea complements or substitutes?
 16. The U.S. government is considering reducing the 
amount of carbon dioxide that firms are allowed to 
produce by issuing a limited number of tradable allow-
ances for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In an April 
25, 2007, report, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) argues that “most of the cost of meeting a cap 
on CO2 emissions would be borne by consumers, who 
would face persistently higher prices for products such 
as electricity and gasoline . . . poorer households would 
bear a larger burden relative to their income than 
wealthier households would.” What assumption about 
one of the elasticities you learned about in this chapter 
has to be true for poorer households to be dispropor-
tionately affected?
 17. According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, 
sales of the fuel-efficient Toyota Prius hybrid fell from 
158,574 vehicles sold in 2008 to 139,682 in 2009. Over 
the same period, according to data from the U.S. 
Energy Information Administration, the average price 
of regular gasoline fell from $3.27 to $2.35 per gallon. 
Using the midpoint method, calculate the cross-price 
elasticity of demand between Toyota Prii (the offi-
cial plural of “Prius” is “Prii”) and regular gasoline. 
According to your estimate of the cross-price elasticity, 
are the two goods complements or substitutes? Does 
your answer make sense?

I
n 1794, long-standing grievances boiled 
over, and outraged farmers banded 
together in widespread revolt. Officials 
responded with deadly force: shots were 
fired, and several people killed, before gov-
ernment forces finally prevailed.
It wouldn’t be surprising if you 
mistook this as an episode from the 
French Revolution. But, in fact, it 
occurred in western Pennsylvania—
an event that severely shook the early 
American nation, and its first presi-
dent, George Washington. Although 
the Whiskey Rebellion was eventually 
suppressed, it permanently reshaped 
American politics.
So what was the fighting about? 
Taxes. Facing a large debt after the War 
of Independence and unable to raise 
taxes any higher on imported goods, 
the Washington administration, at 
the suggestion of Treasury Secretary, 
Alexander Hamiton, enacted a tax on 
whiskey distillers in 1791. Whiskey 
was a popular drink at the time, so 
such a tax could raise a lot of revenue. 
Meantime, a tax would encourage more 
“upstanding behavior” on the part of the 
young country’s hard-drinking citizenry.
Yet the way the tax was applied was 
perceived as deeply unfair. Distillers 
could either pay a flat amount or pay 
by the gallon. Large distillers could 
afford the flat amount, but small distill-
ers could not and paid by the gallon. As 
a result, the small distillers—farmers 
who distilled whiskey to supplement 
their income—paid a higher proportion 
of their earnings in tax than large distill-
ers. Moreover, in the frontier of western 
Pennsylvania, cash was commonly hard 
to acquire and whiskey was often used 
as payment in transactions. By discour-
aging small distillers from producing 
whiskey, the tax left the local economy 
with less income and fewer means to 
buy and sell others goods.
Although the rebellion against the 
whiskey tax was eventually put down, 
the political party that supported the 
tax—the Federalist Party of Alexander 
Hamilton—never fully recovered its pop-
ularity. The Whiskey Rebellion paved the 
way for the emergence of a new politi-
cal party: Thomas Jefferson’s Republican 
Party, which repealed the tax in 1800.
There are two main morals to this 
story. One, taxes are necessary: all 
governments need money to function. 
Without taxes, governments could not 
provide the services we want, from 
national defense to public parks. But 
taxes have a cost that normally exceeds 
the money actually paid to the gov-
ernment. That’s because taxes distort 
incentives to engage in mutually benefi-
cial transactions. 
And that leads us to the second 
moral: making tax policy isn’t easy—in 
fact, if you are a politician, it can be 
dangerous to your professional health. 
But the story also illustrates some cru-
cial issues in tax policy—issues that 
economic models help clarify.
One principle used for guiding tax 
policy is efficiency: taxes should be 
designed to distort incentives as little 
as possible. But efficiency is not the only 
concern when designing tax rates. As 
the Washington administration learned 
from the Whiskey Rebellion, it’s also 
important that a tax be seen as fair. Tax 
policy always involves striking a bal-
ance between the pursuit of efficiency 
and the pursuit of perceived fairness.
In this chapter, we will look at how 
taxes affect efficiency and fairness as well 
as raise revenue for the government.

The Economics of Taxes: 
A Preliminary View
T
o understand the economics of taxes, it’s helpful to look at a simple type 
of tax known as an excise tax—a tax charged on each unit of a good or 
service that is sold. Most tax revenue in the United States comes from other 
kinds of taxes, which we’ll describe later in this chapter. But excise taxes are 
common. For example, there are excise taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, and foreign-
made trucks, and many local governments impose excise taxes on services such 
as hotel room rentals. The lessons we’ll learn from studying excise taxes apply to 
other, more complex taxes as well.
The Effect of an Excise Tax on Quantities and Prices
Suppose that the supply and demand for hotel rooms in the city of Potterville 
are as shown in Figure 7-1. We’ll make the simplifying assumption that all 
hotel rooms are the same. In the absence of taxes, the equilibrium price of a 
room is $80 per night and the equilibrium quantity of hotel rooms rented is 
10,000 per night.
Now suppose that Potterville’s government imposes an excise tax of $40 per 
night on hotel rooms—that is, every time a room is rented for the night, the owner 
of the hotel must pay the city $40. For example, if a customer pays $80, $40 is 
collected as a tax, leaving the hotel owner with only $40. As a result, hotel owners 
are less willing to supply rooms at any given price.
What does this imply about the supply curve for hotel rooms in Potterville? 
To answer this question, we must compare the incentives of hotel owners pre-tax 
(before the tax is levied) to their incentives post-tax (after the tax is levied). 
From Figure 7-1 we know that pre-tax, hotel owners are willing to supply 
5,000 rooms per night at a price of $60 per room. But after the $40 tax per room 
An excise tax is a tax on sales of a 
good or service.
The Supply and Demand for Hotel Rooms in Potterville
7-1
In the absence of taxes, the equilibrium 
price of hotel rooms is $80 a night, and 
the equilibrium number of rooms rented is 
10,000 per night, as shown by point E. The 
supply curve, S, shows the quantity sup-
plied at any given price, pre-tax. At a price 
of $60 a night, hotel owners are willing to 
supply 5,000 rooms, point B. But post-tax, 
hotel owners are willing to supply the same 
quantity only at a price of $100: $60 for 
themselves plus $40 paid to the city as tax.

is levied, they are willing to supply the same amount, 5,000 rooms, only if they 
receive $100 per room—$60 for themselves plus $40 paid to the city as tax. In 
other words, in order for hotel owners to be willing to supply the same quantity 
post-tax as they would have pre-tax, they must receive an additional $40 per 
room, the amount of the tax. This implies that the post-tax supply curve shifts up 
by the amount of the tax compared to the pre-tax supply curve. At every quantity 
supplied, the supply price—the price that producers must receive to produce a 
given quantity—has increased by $40.
The upward shift of the supply curve caused by the tax is shown in Figure 7-2, 
where S1 is the pre-tax supply curve and S2 is the post-tax supply curve. As you 
can see, the market equilibrium moves from E, at the equilibrium price of $80 
per room and 10,000 rooms rented each night, to A, at a market price of $100 per 
room and only 5,000 rooms rented each night. A is, of course, on both the demand 
curve D and the new supply curve S2. In this case, $100 is the demand price of 
5,000 rooms—but in effect hotel owners receive only $60, when you account for 
the fact that they have to pay the $40 tax. From the point of view of hotel owners, 
it is as if they were on their original supply curve at point B.
Let’s check this again. How do we know that 5,000 rooms will be supplied at 
a price of $100? Because the price net of tax is $60, and according to the original 
supply curve, 5,000 rooms will be supplied at a price of $60, as shown by point B 
in Figure 7-2.
Does this look familiar? It should. In Chapter 5 we described the effects of a 
quota on sales: a quota drives a wedge between the price paid by consumers and 
the price received by producers. An excise tax does the same thing. As a result of 
this wedge, consumers pay more and producers receive less. 
In our example, consumers—people who rent hotel rooms—end up pay-
ing $100 a night, $20 more than the pre-tax price of $80. At the same time, 
producers—the hotel owners—receive a price net of tax of $60 per room, $20 
less than the pre-tax price. In addition, the tax creates missed opportuni-
ties: 5,000 potential consumers who would have rented hotel rooms—those 
willing to pay $80 but not $100 per night—are discouraged from doing so. 
An Excise Tax Imposed on Hotel Owners
7-2
A $40 per room tax imposed on hotel 
owners shifts the supply curve from S1 
to S2, an upward shift of $40. The equi-
librium price of hotel rooms rises from 
$80 to $100 a night, and the equilib-
rium quantity of rooms rented falls from 
10,000 to 5,000. Although hotel own-
ers pay the tax, they actually bear only 
half the burden: the price they receive 
net of tax falls only $20, from $80 to 
$60. Guests who rent rooms bear the 
other half of the burden, because the 
price they pay rises by $20, from $80 
to $100.

Correspondingly, 5,000 rooms that would have been made available by hotel 
owners when they receive $80 are not offered when they receive only $60. Like 
a quota, this tax leads to inefficiency by distorting incentives and creating 
missed opportunities for mutually beneficial transactions.
It’s important to recognize that as we’ve described it, Potterville’s hotel tax is 
a tax on the hotel owners, not their guests—it’s a tax on the producers, not the 
consumers. Yet the price received by producers, net of tax, is down by only $20, 
half the amount of the tax, and the price paid by consumers is up by $20. In effect, 
half the tax is being paid by consumers.
What would happen if the city levied a tax on consumers instead of produc-
ers? That is, suppose that instead of requiring hotel owners to pay $40 a night for 
each room they rent, the city required hotel guests to pay $40 for each night they 
stayed in a hotel. The answer is shown in Figure 7-3. If a hotel guest must pay a 
tax of $40 per night, then the price for a room paid by that guest must be reduced 
by $40 in order for the quantity of hotel rooms demanded post-tax to be the same 
as that demanded pre-tax. So the demand curve shifts downward, from D1 to D2, 
by the amount of the tax. 
At every quantity demanded, the demand price—the price that consum-
ers must be offered to demand a given quantity—has fallen by $40. This shifts 
the equilibrium from E to B, where the market price of hotel rooms is $60 and 
5,000 hotel rooms are bought and sold. In effect, hotel guests pay $100 when you 
include the tax. So from the point of view of guests, it is as if they were on their 
original demand curve at point A.
If you compare Figures 7-2 and 7-3, you will immediately notice that they 
show the same price effect. In each case, consumers pay an effective price of $100, 
producers receive an effective price of $60, and 5,000 hotel rooms are bought and 
sold. In fact, it doesn’t matter who officially pays the tax—the equilibrium outcome 
is the same.
This insight illustrates a general principle of the economics of taxation: the 
incidence of a tax—who really bears the burden of the tax—is typically not a 
question you can answer by asking who writes the check to the government. In 
this particular case, a $40 tax on hotel rooms is reflected in a $20 increase in the

A $40 per room tax imposed on hotel 
guests shifts the demand curve from

The equilibrium price of hotel rooms 
falls from $80 to $60 a night, and the 
quantity of rooms rented falls from 
10,000 to 5,000. Although in this case 
the tax is officially paid by consumers, 
while in Figure 7-2 the tax was paid by 
producers, the outcome is the same: 
after taxes, hotel owners receive $60 
per room but guests pay $100. This 
illustrates a general principle: The inci-
dence of an excise tax doesn’t depend 
on whether consumers or producers 
officially pay the tax.

price paid by consumers and a $20 decrease in the price received by producers. 
Here, regardless of whether the tax is levied on consumers or producers, the inci-
dence of the tax is evenly split between them.
Price Elasticities and Tax Incidence
We’ve just learned that the incidence of an excise tax doesn’t depend on who 
officially pays it. In the example shown in Figures 7-1 through 7-3, a tax on hotel 
rooms falls equally on consumers and producers, no matter who the tax is levied 
on. But it’s important to note that this 50–50 split between consumers and pro-
ducers is a result of our assumptions in this example. In the real world, the inci-
dence of an excise tax usually falls unevenly between consumers and producers, 
as one group bears more of the burden than the other.
What determines how the burden of an excise tax is allocated between con-
sumers and producers? The answer depends on the shapes of the supply and the 
demand curves. More specifically, the incidence of an excise tax depends on the 
price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand. We can see this by look-
ing first at a case in which consumers pay most of an excise tax, then at a case in 
which producers pay most of the tax.
When an Excise Tax Is Paid Mainly by Consumers Figure 7-4 shows an 
excise tax that falls mainly on consumers: an excise tax on gasoline, which we set 
at $1 per gallon. (There really is a federal excise tax on gasoline, though it is actu-
ally only about $0.18 per gallon in the United States. In addition, states impose 
excise taxes between $0.04 and $0.38 per gallon.) According to Figure 7-4, in the 
absence of the tax, gasoline would sell for $2 per gallon.
Two key assumptions are reflected in the shapes of the supply and demand 
curves in Figure 7-4. First, the price elasticity of demand for gasoline is assumed 
to be very low, so the demand curve is relatively steep. Recall that a low price elas-
ticity of demand means that the quantity demanded changes little in response to 
a change in price—a feature of a steep demand curve. Second, the price elasticity 
of supply of gasoline is assumed to be very high, so the supply curve is relatively 
flat. A high price elasticity of supply means that the quantity supplied changes 
a lot in response to a change in price—a feature of a relatively flat supply curve.
We have just learned that an excise tax drives a wedge, equal to the size of the 
tax, between the price paid by consumers and the price received by producers. This

The relatively steep demand curve here reflects a low 
price elasticity of demand for gasoline. The relatively 
flat supply curve reflects a high price elasticity of sup-
ply. The pre-tax price of a gallon of gasoline is $2.00, 
and a tax of $1.00 per gallon is imposed. The price 
paid by consumers rises by $0.95 to $2.95, reflect-
ing the fact that most of the burden of the tax falls on 
consumers. Only a small portion of the tax is borne by 
producers: the price they receive falls by only $0.05 
to $1.95.

wedge drives the price paid by consumers up and the price received by producers 
down. But as we can see from Figure 7-4, in this case those two effects are very 
unequal in size. The price received by producers falls only slightly, from $2.00 to 
$1.95, but the price paid by consumers rises by a lot, from $2.00 to $2.95. In this 
case consumers bear the greater share of the tax burden.
This example illustrates another general principle of taxation: When the price 
elasticity of demand is low and the price elasticity of supply is high, the burden of an 
excise tax falls mainly on consumers. Why? A low price elasticity of demand means 
that consumers have few substitutes and so little alternative to buying higher-
priced gasoline. In contrast, a high price elasticity of supply results from the fact 
that producers have many production substitutes for their gasoline (that is, other 
uses for the crude oil from which gasoline is refined). This gives producers much 
greater flexibility in refusing to accept lower prices for their gasoline. And, not 
surprisingly, the party with the least flexibility—in this case, consumers—gets 
stuck paying most of the tax. This is a good description of how the burden of the 
main excise taxes actually collected in the United States today, such as those on 
cigarettes and alcoholic beverages, is allocated between consumers and producers.
When an Excise Tax Is Paid Mainly by Producers Figure 7-5 shows an 
example of an excise tax paid mainly by producers, a $5.00 per day tax on down-
town parking in a small city. In the absence of the tax, the market equilibrium 
price of parking is $6.00 per day.
We’ve assumed in this case that the price elasticity of supply is very low 
because the lots used for parking have very few alternative uses. This makes the 
supply curve for parking spaces relatively steep. The price elasticity of demand, 
however, is assumed to be high: consumers can easily switch from the downtown 
spaces to other parking spaces a few minutes’ walk from downtown, spaces that 
are not subject to the tax. This makes the demand curve relatively flat.
The tax drives a wedge between the price paid by consumers and the price 
received by producers. In this example, however, the tax causes the price paid 
by consumers to rise only slightly, from $6.00 to $6.50, but the price received by 
producers falls a lot, from $6.00 to $1.50. In the end, consumers bear only $0.50 
of the $5.00 tax burden, with producers bearing the remaining $4.50.
Again, this example illustrates a general principle: When the price elasticity of 
demand is high and the price elasticity of supply is low, the burden of an excise tax 
falls mainly on producers. A real-world example is a tax on purchases of existing 
An Excise Tax Paid Mainly by Producers
7-5
The relatively flat demand curve here reflects a 
high price elasticity of demand for downtown 
parking, and the relatively steep supply curve 
results from a low price elasticity of supply. The 
pre-tax price of a daily parking space is $6.00 and 
a tax of $5.00 is imposed. The price received by 
producers falls a lot, to $1.50, reflecting the fact 
that they bear most of the tax burden. The price 
paid by consumers rises a small amount, $0.50, to 
$6.50, so they bear very little of the burden.

houses. Before the collapse of the housing market that began in 2007, house 
prices in many American cities and towns had risen significantly, as well-off 
outsiders moved into desirable locations and purchased homes from the less-
well-off original occupants. Some of these towns have imposed taxes on house 
sales intended to extract money from the new arrivals. But this ignores the fact 
that the price elasticity of demand for houses in a particular town is often high, 
because potential buyers can choose to move to other towns. Furthermore, the 
price elasticity of supply is often low because most sellers must sell their houses 
due to job transfers or to provide funds for their retirement. So taxes on home 
purchases are actually paid mainly by the less well-off sellers—not, as town 
officials imagine, by wealthy buyers.
Putting It All Together We’ve just seen that when the price elasticity of sup-
ply is high and the price elasticity of demand is low, an excise tax falls mainly on 
consumers. And when the price elasticity of supply is low and the price elasticity 
of demand is high, an excise tax falls mainly on producers. This leads us to the 
general rule: When the price elasticity of demand is higher than the price elasticity 
of supply, an excise tax falls mainly on producers. When the price elasticity of supply 
is higher than the price elasticity of demand, an excise tax falls mainly on consum-
ers. So elasticity—not who officially pays the tax—determines the incidence of 
an excise tax.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
WHO PAYS THE FICA?
A
nyone who works for an employer receives a paycheck that itemizes not 
only the wages paid but also the money deducted from the paycheck 
for various taxes. For most people, one of the big deductions is FICA, also 
known as the payroll tax. FICA, which stands for the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act, pays for the Social Security and Medicare systems, federal 
social insurance programs that provide income and medical care to retired 
and disabled Americans.
In 2010, most American workers paid 7.65% of their earnings in FICA. (During 
2011, there was a temporary reduction in workers’ tax rate.) But this is literally 
only the half of it: each employer is required to pay an amount equal to the con-
tributions of its employees.
How should we think about FICA? Is it really shared equally by workers and 
employers? We can use our previous analysis to answer that question 
because FICA is like an excise tax—a tax on the sale and purchase of 
labor. Half of it is a tax levied on the sellers—that is, workers. The other 
half is a tax levied on the buyers—that is, employers.
But we already know that the incidence of a tax does not really 
depend on who actually makes out the check. Almost all economists 
agree that FICA is a tax actually paid by workers, not by their employ-
ers. The reason for this conclusion lies in a comparison of the price 
elasticities of the supply of labor by households and the demand for 
labor by firms. Evidence indicates that the price elasticity of demand 
for labor is quite high, at least 3. That is, an increase in average wages 
of 1% would lead to at least a 3% decline in the number of hours of 
work demanded by employers. Labor economists believe, however, that 
the price elasticity of supply of labor is very low. The reason is that 
although a fall in the wage rate reduces the incentive to work more 
hours, it also makes people poorer and less able to afford leisure time. 
The strength of this second effect is shown in the data: the number of 
hours people are willing to work falls very little—if at all—when the 
wage per hour goes down.
Contrary to widely held beliefs, for 70% of Americans it’s 
the FICA, not the income tax, that takes the biggest bite 
from their paychecks.

Our general rule of tax incidence says that when the price elasticity of demand 
is much higher than the price elasticity of supply, the burden of an excise tax falls 
mainly on the suppliers. So the FICA falls mainly on the suppliers of labor, that is, 
workers—even though on paper half the tax is paid by employers. In other words, 
the FICA is largely borne by workers in the form of lower wages, rather than by 
employers in the form of lower profits.
This conclusion tells us something important about the American tax system: 
the FICA, rather than the much-maligned income tax, is the main tax burden on 
most families. For most workers, FICA is 15.3% of all wages and salaries up to 
$106,800 per year (note that 7.65% + 7.65% = 15.3%). That is, the great majority of 
workers in the United States pay 15.3% of their wages in FICA. Only a minority 
of American families pay more than 15% of their income in income tax. In fact, 
according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, for more than 70% of 
families FICA is Uncle Sam’s main bite out of their income.

The Benefits and Costs of Taxation
W
hen a government is considering whether to impose a tax or how to 
design a tax system, it has to weigh the benefits of a tax against its costs. 
We don’t usually think of a tax as something that provides benefits, but 
governments need money to provide things people want, such as national defense 
and health care for those unable to afford it. The benefit of a tax is the revenue 
it raises for the government to pay for these services. Unfortunately, this benefit 
comes at a cost—a cost that is normally larger than the amount consumers and 
producers pay. Let’s look first at what determines how much money a tax raises, 
then at the costs a tax imposes.
The Revenue from an Excise Tax
How much revenue does the government collect from an excise tax? In our hotel 
tax example, the revenue is equal to the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 7-6.
To see why this area represents the revenue collected by a $40 tax on hotel 
rooms, notice that the height of the rectangle is $40, equal to the tax per room. It

between the price paid by consum-

missed opportunities.

supply and the lower the price elas-
ticity of demand, the heavier the 
burden of an excise tax on consum-
ers. The lower the price elasticity 
of supply and the higher the price 
elasticity of demand, the heavier 
the burden on producers.

is also, as we’ve seen, the size of the wedge that the tax drives between the supply 
price (the price received by producers) and the demand price (the price paid by 
consumers). Meanwhile, the width of the rectangle is 5,000 rooms, equal to the 
equilibrium quantity of rooms given the $40 tax. With that information, we can 
make the following calculations.
The tax revenue collected is:
Tax revenue = $40 per room × 5,000 rooms = $200,000
The area of the shaded rectangle is:
Area = Height × Width = $40 per room × 5,000 rooms = $200,000
or
Tax revenue = Area of shaded rectangle
This is a general principle: The revenue collected by an excise tax is equal to the 
area of the rectangle whose height is the tax wedge between the supply and demand 
curves and whose width is the quantity transacted under the tax.
Tax Rates and Revenue
In Figure 7-6, $40 per room is the tax rate on hotel rooms. A tax rate is the amount 
of tax levied per unit of whatever is being taxed. Sometimes tax rates are defined 
in terms of dollar amounts per unit of a good or service; for example, $2.46 per 
pack of cigarettes sold. In other cases, they are defined as a percentage of the 
price; for example, the payroll tax is 15.3% of a worker’s earnings up to $106,800.
There’s obviously a relationship between tax rates and revenue. That relation-
ship is not, however, one-for-one. In general, doubling the excise tax rate on a 
good or service won’t double the amount of revenue collected, because the tax 
increase will reduce the quantity of the good or service transacted. And the rela-
tionship between the level of the tax and the amount of revenue collected may not 
even be positive: in some cases raising the tax rate actually reduces the amount of 
revenue the government collects.
The Revenue from an Excise Tax

The revenue from a $40 excise tax on hotel 
rooms is $200,000, equal to the tax rate, 
$40—the size of the wedge that the tax 
drives between the supply price and the 
demand price—multiplied by the number of 
rooms rented, 5,000. This is equal to the 
area of the shaded rectangle.

We can illustrate these points using our hotel room example. Figure 7-6 
showed the revenue the government collects from a $40 tax on hotel rooms. 
Figure 7-7 shows the revenue the government would collect from two alternative 
tax rates—a lower tax of only $20 per room and a higher tax of $60 per room.
Panel (a) of Figure 7-7 shows the case of a $20 tax, equal to half the tax rate 
illustrated in Figure 7-6. At this lower tax rate, 7,500 rooms are rented, generating 
tax revenue of:
Tax revenue = $20 per room × 7,500 rooms = $150,000
Recall that the tax revenue collected from a $40 tax rate is $200,000. So the 
revenue collected from a $20 tax rate, $150,000, is only 75% of the amount col-
lected when the tax rate is twice as high ($150,000/$200,000 × 100 = 75%). To put 
it another way, a 100% increase in the tax rate from $20 to $40 per room leads 
to only a one-third, or 33.3%, increase in revenue, from $150,000 to $200,000 
(($200,000 – $150,000)/$150,000 × 100 = 33.3%).
Panel (b) depicts what happens if the tax rate is raised from $40 to $60 per 
room, leading to a fall in the number of rooms rented from 5,000 to 2,500. The 
revenue collected at a $60 per room tax rate is:
Tax revenue = $60 per room × 2,500 rooms = $150,000
This is also less than the revenue collected by a $40 per room tax. So rais-
ing the tax rate from $40 to $60 actually reduces revenue. More precisely, in 
this case raising the tax rate by 50% (($60 − $40)/$40 × 100 = 50%) lowers the

In general, doubling the excise tax rate on a good 
or service won’t double the amount of revenue col-
lected, because the tax increase will reduce the 
quantity of the good or service bought and sold. 
And the relationship between the level of the tax and 
the amount of revenue collected may not even be 
positive. Panel (a) shows the revenue raised by a tax 
rate of $20 per room, only half the tax rate in Figure 
7-6. The tax revenue raised, equal to the area of the 
shaded rectangle, is $150,000, three-quarters as 
much as the revenue raised by a $40 tax rate. Panel 
(b) shows that the revenue raised by a $60 tax rate 
is also $150,000. So raising the tax rate from $40 to 
$60 actually reduces tax revenue.

tax revenue by 25% (($150,000 − $200,000)/$200,000 × 100 = −25%). Why did 
this happen? It happened because the fall in tax revenue caused by the reduc-
tion in the number of rooms rented more than offset the increase in the tax 
revenue caused by the rise in the tax rate. In other words, setting a tax rate 
so high that it deters a significant number of transactions is likely to lead to 
a fall in tax revenue.
One way to think about the revenue effect of increasing an excise tax is 
that the tax increase affects tax revenue in two ways. On one side, the tax 
increase means that the government raises more revenue for each unit of the 
good sold, which other things equal would lead to a rise in tax revenue. On the 
other side, the tax increase reduces the quantity of sales, which other things 
equal would lead to a fall in tax revenue. The end result depends both on the 
price elasticities of supply and demand and on the initial level of the tax. If 
the price elasticities of both supply and demand are low, the tax increase won’t 
reduce the quantity of the good sold very much, so tax revenue will definitely 
rise. If the price elasticities are high, the result is less certain; if they are high 
enough, the tax reduces the quantity sold so much that tax revenue falls. Also, 
if the initial tax rate is low, the government doesn’t lose much revenue from 
the decline in the quantity of the good sold, so the tax increase will definitely 
increase tax revenue. If the initial tax rate is high, the result is again less cer-
tain. Tax revenue is likely to fall or rise very little from a tax increase only in 
cases where the price elasticities are high and there is already a high tax rate.
The possibility that a higher tax rate can reduce tax revenue, and the cor-
responding possibility that cutting taxes can increase tax revenue, is a basic 
principle of taxation that policy makers take into account when setting tax 
rates. That is, when considering a tax created for the purpose of raising rev-
enue (in contrast to taxes created to discourage undesirable behavior, known as 
“sin taxes”), a well-informed policy maker won’t impose a tax rate so high that 
cutting the tax would increase revenue. In the real world, policy makers aren’t 
always well informed, but they usually aren’t complete fools either. That’s why 
it’s very hard to find real-world examples in which raising a tax reduced revenue 
or cutting a tax increased revenue. Nonetheless, the theoretical possibility that a 
tax reduction increases tax revenue has played an important role in the folklore 
of American politics. As explained in For Inquiring Minds, an economist who, 
in the 1970s, sketched on a napkin the figure of a revenue-increasing income 
tax reduction had a significant impact on the economic policies adopted in the 
United States in the 1980s.
One afternoon in 1974, the economist 
Arthur Laffer got together in a cocktail 
lounge with Jude Wanniski, a writer 
for the Wall Street Journal, and Dick 
Cheney, who would later become vice 
president but at the time was the dep-
uty White House chief of staff. During 
the course of their conversation, Laffer 
drew a diagram on a napkin that was 
intended to explain how tax cuts could 
sometimes lead to higher tax revenue. 
According to Laffer’s diagram, raising 
tax rates initially increases tax revenue, 
but beyond a certain level revenue falls 
instead as tax rates continue to rise. 
That is, at some point tax rates are 
so high and reduce the number of 
transactions so greatly that tax rev-
enues fall.
There was nothing new about this 
idea, but in later years that napkin 
became the stuff of legend. The edi-
tors of the Wall Street Journal began 
promoting the “Laffer curve” as a 
justification for tax cuts. And when 
Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, 
he used the Laffer curve to argue that 
his proposed cuts in income tax rates 
would not reduce the federal govern-
ment’s revenue.
So is there a Laffer curve? Yes—as a 
theoretical proposition it’s definitely pos-
sible that tax rates could be so high that 
cutting taxes would increase tax revenue. 
But very few economists now believe that 
Reagan’s tax cuts actually increased rev-
enue, and real-world examples in which 
revenue and tax rates move in opposite 
directions are very hard to find. That’s 
because it’s rare to find an existing tax 
rate so high that reducing it leads to an 
increase in tax revenue.

The Costs of Taxation
What is the cost of a tax? You might be inclined to answer that it is the money 
taxpayers pay to the government. In other words, you might believe that the cost 
of a tax is the tax revenue collected. But suppose the government uses the tax 
revenue to provide services that taxpayers want. Or suppose that the government 
simply hands the tax revenue back to taxpayers. Would we say in those cases that 
the tax didn’t actually cost anything?
No—because a tax, like a quota, prevents mutually beneficial transactions 
from occurring. Consider Figure 7-6 once more. Here, with a $40 tax on hotel 
rooms, guests pay $100 per room but hotel owners receive only $60 per room. 
Because of the wedge created by the tax, we know that some transactions don’t 
occur that would have occurred without the tax. More specifically, we know from 
the supply and demand curves that there are some potential guests who would be 
willing to pay up to $90 per night and some hotel owners who would be willing 
to supply rooms if they received at least $70 per night. If these two sets of people 
were allowed to trade with each other without the tax, they would engage in mutu-
ally beneficial transactions—hotel rooms would be rented. But such deals would 
be illegal, because the $40 tax would not be paid. In our example, 5,000 potential 
hotel room rentals that would have occurred in the absence of the tax, to the 
mutual benefit of guests and hotel owners, do not take place because of the tax.
So an excise tax imposes costs over and above the tax revenue collected in the 
form of inefficiency, which occurs because the tax discourages mutually benefi-
cial transactions. As we learned in Chapter 5, the cost to society of this kind of 
inefficiency—the value of the forgone mutually beneficial transactions—is called 
the deadweight loss. While all real-world taxes impose some deadweight loss, a 
badly designed tax imposes a larger deadweight loss than a well-designed one.
To measure the deadweight loss from a tax, we turn to the concepts of pro-
ducer and consumer surplus. Figure 7-8 shows the effects of an excise tax on 
consumer and producer surplus. In the absence of the tax, the equilibrium is at 
E and the equilibrium price and quantity are PE and QE, respectively. An excise 
tax drives a wedge equal to the amount of the tax between the price received by 
producers and the price paid by consumers, reducing the quantity sold. In this 
A Tax Reduces Consumer and Producer Surplus
7-8
Before the tax, the equilibrium price 
and quantity are PE and QE, respec-
tively. After an excise tax of T per unit is 
imposed, the price to consumers rises 
to PC and consumer surplus falls by the 
sum of the dark blue rectangle, labeled 
A, and the light blue triangle, labeled B. 
The tax also causes the price to produc-
ers to fall to PP; producer surplus falls 
by the sum of the dark red rectangle, 
labeled C, and the light red triangle, 
labeled F. The government receives rev-
enue from the tax, QT × T, which is given 
by the sum of the areas A and C. Areas 
B and F represent the losses to con-
sumer and producer surplus that are not 
collected by the government as revenue; 
they are the deadweight loss to society 
of the tax.

case, where the tax is T dollars per unit, the quantity sold falls to QT. The price 
paid by consumers rises to PC, the demand price of the reduced quantity, QT, and 
the price received by producers falls to PP, the supply price of that quantity. The 
difference between these prices, PC − PP, is equal to the excise tax, T.
Using the concepts of producer and consumer surplus, we can show exactly 
how much surplus producers and consumers lose as a result of the tax. From 
Figure 4-5 we learned that a fall in the price of a good generates a gain in con-
sumer surplus that is equal to the sum of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle. 
Similarly, a price increase causes a loss to consumers that is represented by the 
sum of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle. So it’s not surprising that in the 
case of an excise tax, the rise in the price paid by consumers causes a loss equal to 
the sum of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle: the dark blue rectangle labeled 
A and the area of the light blue triangle labeled B in Figure 7-8.
Meanwhile, the fall in the price received by producers leads to a fall in produc-
er surplus. This, too, is equal to the sum of the areas of a rectangle and a triangle. 
The loss in producer surplus is the sum of the areas of the dark red rectangle 
labeled C and the light red triangle labeled F in Figure 7-8.
Of course, although consumers and producers are hurt by the tax, the gov-
ernment gains revenue. The revenue the government collects is equal to the tax 
per unit sold, T, multiplied by the quantity sold, QT. This revenue is equal to the 
area of a rectangle QT wide and T high. And we already have that rectangle in the 
figure: it is the sum of rectangles A and C. So the government gains part of what 
consumers and producers lose from an excise tax.
But a portion of the loss to producers and consumers from the tax is not 
offset by a gain to the government—specifically, the two triangles B and F. The 
deadweight loss caused by the tax is equal to the combined area of these two tri-
angles. It represents the total surplus lost to society because of the tax—that is, 
the amount of surplus that would have been generated by transactions that now 
do not take place because of the tax.
Figure 7-9 is a version of Figure 7-8 that leaves out rectangles A (the surplus shift-
ed from consumers to the government) and C (the surplus shifted from producers to 
the government) and shows only the deadweight loss, here drawn as a triangle shaded 
yellow. The base of that triangle is equal to the tax wedge, T; the height of the triangle 
The Deadweight Loss of a Tax

A tax leads to a deadweight loss because 
it creates inefficiency: some mutually 
beneficial transactions never take place 
because of the tax—namely, the transac-
tions QE − QT. The yellow area here rep-
resents the value of the deadweight loss: 
it is the total surplus that would have 
been gained from the QE − QT transac-
tions. If the tax had not discouraged 
transactions—had the number of transac-
tions remained at QE—no deadweight 
loss would have been incurred.

is equal to the reduction in the quantity transacted due to the tax, QE − QT. Clearly, the 
larger the tax wedge and the larger the reduction in the quantity transacted, the great-
er the inefficiency from the tax. But also note an important, contrasting point: if the 
excise tax somehow didn’t reduce the quantity bought and sold in this market—if QT 
remained equal to QE after the tax was levied—the yellow triangle would disappear 
and the deadweight loss from the tax would be zero. This observation is simply the 
flip-side of the principle found earlier in the chapter: a tax causes inefficiency because 
it discourages mutually beneficial transactions between buyers and sellers. So if a 
tax does not discourage transactions, it causes no deadweight loss. In this case, the 
tax simply shifts surplus straight from consumers and producers to the government.
Using a triangle to measure deadweight loss is a technique used in many economic 
applications. For example, triangles are used to measure the deadweight loss produced 
by types of taxes other than excise taxes. They are also used to measure the deadweight 
loss produced by monopoly, another kind of market distortion. And deadweight-loss 
triangles are often used to evaluate the benefits and costs of public policies besides 
taxation—such as whether to impose stricter safety standards on a product.
In considering the total amount of inefficiency caused by a tax, we must also 
take into account something not shown in Figure 7-9: the resources actually used 
by the government to collect the tax, and by taxpayers to pay it, over and above 
the amount of the tax. These lost resources are called the administrative costs 
of the tax. The most familiar administrative cost of the U.S. tax system is the time 
individuals spend filling out their income tax forms or the money they spend on 
accountants to prepare their tax forms for them. (The latter is considered an inef-
ficiency from the point of view of society because accountants could instead be 
performing other, non-tax-related services.) Included in the administrative costs 
that taxpayers incur are resources used to evade the tax, both legally and illegally. 
The costs of operating the Internal Revenue Service, the arm of the federal gov-
ernment tasked with collecting the federal income tax, are actually quite small in 
comparison to the administrative costs paid by taxpayers.
So the total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of its deadweight loss and its 
administrative costs. The general rule for economic policy is that, other things equal, 
a tax system should be designed to minimize the total inefficiency it imposes on soci-
ety. In practice, other considerations also apply (as the Washington administration 
learned during the Whiskey Rebellion), but this principle nonetheless gives valuable 
guidance. Administrative costs are usually well known, more or less determined by 
the current technology of collecting taxes (for example, filing paper returns versus 
filing electronically). But how can we predict the size of the deadweight loss associ-
ated with a given tax? Not surprisingly, as in our analysis of the incidence of a tax, the 
price elasticities of supply and demand play crucial roles in making such a prediction.
Elasticities and the Deadweight Loss of a Tax
We know that the deadweight loss from an excise tax arises because it prevents 
some mutually beneficial transactions from occurring. In particular, the produc-
er and consumer surplus that is forgone because of these missing transactions is 
equal to the size of the deadweight loss itself. This means that the larger the num-
ber of transactions that are prevented by the tax, the larger the deadweight loss.
This fact gives us an important clue in understanding the relationship between 
elasticity and the size of the deadweight loss from a tax. Recall that when demand 
or supply is elastic, the quantity demanded or the quantity supplied is relatively 
responsive to changes in the price. So a tax imposed on a good for which either 
demand or supply, or both, is elastic will cause a relatively large decrease in the 
quantity transacted and a relatively large deadweight loss. And when we say that 
demand or supply is inelastic, we mean that the quantity demanded or the quantity 
supplied is relatively unresponsive to changes in the price. As a result, a tax imposed 
when demand or supply, or both, is inelastic will cause a relatively small decrease 
in the quantity transacted and a relatively small deadweight loss.
The administrative costs of 
a tax are the resources used by 
government to collect the tax, and by 
taxpayers to pay it, over and above 
the amount of the tax, as well as to 
evade it.

The four panels of Figure 7-10 illustrate the positive relationship between a 
good’s price elasticity of either demand or supply and the deadweight loss from 
taxing that good. Each panel represents the same amount of tax imposed but on 
a different good; the size of the deadweight loss is given by the area of the shaded 
triangle. In panel (a), the deadweight-loss triangle is large because demand 
for this good is relatively elastic—a large number of transactions fail to occur 
because of the tax. In panel (b), the same supply curve is drawn as in panel (a),

Demand is elastic in panel (a) and inelastic in panel (b), 
but the supply curves are the same. Supply is elastic 
in panel (c) and inelastic in panel (d), but the demand 
curves are the same. The deadweight losses are larger 
in panels (a) and (c) than in panels (b) and (d) because 
the greater the price elasticity of demand or supply, the 
greater the tax-induced fall in the quantity transacted. 
In contrast, the lower the price elasticity of demand or 
supply, the smaller the tax-induced fall in the quantity 
transacted and the smaller the deadweight loss.

but demand for this good is relatively inelastic; as a result, the triangle is small 
because only a small number of transactions are forgone. Likewise, panels (c) and 
(d) contain the same demand curve but different supply curves. In panel (c), an 
elastic supply curve gives rise to a large deadweight-loss triangle, but in panel (d) 
an inelastic supply curve gives rise to a small deadweight-loss triangle.
The implication of this result is clear: if you want to minimize the efficiency 
costs of taxation, you should choose to tax only those goods for which demand 
or supply, or both, is relatively inelastic. For such goods, a tax has little effect 
on behavior because behavior is relatively unresponsive to changes in the price. 
In the extreme case in which demand is perfectly inelastic (a vertical demand 
curve), the quantity demanded is unchanged by the imposition of the tax. As 
a result, the tax imposes no deadweight loss. Similarly, if supply is perfectly 
inelastic (a vertical supply curve), the quantity supplied is unchanged by the tax 
and there is also no deadweight loss. So if the goal in choosing whom to tax is to 
minimize deadweight loss, then taxes should be imposed on goods and services 
that have the most inelastic response—that is, goods and services for which 
consumers or producers will change their behavior the least in response to the 
tax. (Unless they have a tendency to revolt, of course.) And this lesson carries 
a flip-side: using a tax to purposely decrease the amount of a harmful activity, 
such as underage drinking, will have the most impact when that activity is elas-
tically demanded or supplied.

TAXING THE MARLBORO MAN
O
ne of the most important excise taxes in the United States is the tax on 
cigarettes. The federal government imposes a tax of $1.01 a pack; state gov-
ernments impose taxes that range from $0.17 cents a pack in Missouri to $4.35 a 
pack in New York; and many cities impose further taxes. In general, tax rates on 
cigarettes have increased over time, because more and more governments have 
seen them not just as a source of revenue but as a way to discourage smoking. But 
the rise in cigarette taxes has not been gradual. Usually, once a state government 
decides to raise cigarette taxes, it raises them a lot—which provides economists 
with useful data on what happens when there is a big tax increase.

Table 7-1 shows the results of big increases in cigarette taxes. In each case, 
sales fell, just as our analysis predicts. Although it’s theoretically possible for tax 
revenue to fall after such a large tax increase, in reality tax revenue rose in each 
case. That’s because cigarettes have a low price elasticity of demand.
• An excise tax generates tax rev-
enue equal to the tax rate times 
the number of units of the good or 
service transacted but reduces con-
sumer and producer surplus.
• The government tax revenue col-
lected is less than the loss in total 
surplus because the tax creates 
inefficiency by discouraging some 
mutually beneficial transactions.
• The difference between the tax 
revenue from an excise tax and the 
reduction in total surplus is the 
deadweight loss from the tax. The 
total amount of inefficiency result-
ing from a tax is equal to the dead-
weight loss plus the administrative 
costs of the tax.
• The larger the number of transac-
tions prevented by a tax, the larger 
the deadweight loss. As a result, 
taxes on goods with a greater price 
elasticity of supply or demand, or 
both, generate higher deadweight 
losses. There is no deadweight loss 
when the number of transactions is 
unchanged by the tax.

Tax Fairness and Tax Efficiency
W
e’ve just seen how economic analysis can be used to determine the 
inefficiency caused by a tax. It’s clear that, other things equal, policy 
makers should choose a tax that creates less inefficiency over a tax that 
creates more. But that guideline still leaves policy makers with wide discretion 
in choosing what to tax and, consequently, who bears the burden of the tax. How 
should they exercise this discretion?
One answer is that policy makers should make the tax system fair. But 
what exactly does fairness mean? Moreover, however you define fairness, how 
should policy makers balance considerations of fairness versus considerations 
of efficiency?
Two Principles of Tax Fairness
Fairness, like beauty, is often in the eyes of the beholder. When it comes to taxes, 
however, most debates about fairness rely on one of two principles of tax fairness: 
the benefits principle and the ability-to-pay principle.
According to the benefits principle of tax fairness, those who benefit from 
public spending should bear the burden of the tax that pays for that spending. For 
example, those who benefit from a road should pay for that road’s upkeep, those 
who fly on airplanes should pay for air traffic control, and so on. The benefits 
principle is the basis for some parts of the U.S. tax system. For example, revenue 
from the federal tax on gasoline is specifically reserved for the maintenance and 
improvement of federal roads, including the Interstate Highway System. In this 
way motorists who benefit from the highway system also pay for it.
The benefits principle is attractive from an economic point of view because 
it matches well with one of the major justifications for public spending—the 
According to the benefits principle 
of tax fairness, those who benefit 
from public spending should bear 
the burden of the tax that pays for 
that spending.

theory of public goods, which will be covered in Chapter 17. This theory explains 
why government action is sometimes needed to provide people with goods that 
markets alone would not provide, goods like national defense. If that’s the role of 
government, it seems natural to charge each person in proportion to the benefits 
he or she gets from those goods.
Practical considerations, however, make it impossible to base the entire tax 
system on the benefits principle. It would be too cumbersome to have a specific 
tax for each of the many distinct programs that the government offers. Also, 
attempts to base taxes on the benefits principle often conflict with the other 
major principle of tax fairness: the ability-to-pay principle, according to which 
those with greater ability to pay a tax should pay more.
The ability-to-pay principle is usually interpreted to mean that high-income 
individuals should pay more in taxes than low-income individuals. Often the ability-
to-pay principle is used to argue not only that high-income individuals should pay 
more taxes but also that they should pay a higher percentage of their income in 
taxes. We’ll consider the issue of how taxes vary as a percentage of income later.
The Whiskey Rebellion described at the beginning of this chapter was basi-
cally a protest against the failure of the whiskey tax to take the ability-to-pay 
principle into account. In fact, the tax made small distillers—farmers of modest 
means—pay a higher proportion of their income than large, relatively well-off 
distillers. It’s not surprising that farmers were upset that the new tax completely 
disregarded the ability-to-pay principle.
Equity versus Efficiency
Under the whiskey tax, the flat amount of tax paid by large distillers (in contrast 
to the per-gallon tax paid by small distillers) was an example of a lump-sum 
tax, a tax that is the same regardless of any actions people take. In this case, 
the large distillers paid the same amount of tax regardless of how many gallons 
they produced. Lump-sum taxes are widely perceived to be much less fair than 
a tax that is proportional to the amount of the transaction. And this was true in 
the Whiskey Rebellion: although the small farmers were unhappy to pay a pro-
portional tax, it was still less than they would have owed with the lump-sum tax, 
which would have imposed an even more unfair burden on them.  
But the per-gallon whiskey tax definitely distorted incentives to engage in 
mutually beneficial transactions and created deadweight loss. Because of the tax, 
some farmers would have reduced how much whiskey they distilled, with some 
forgoing distilling altogether. The result, surely, was a lower production of whis-
key and less income earned by farmers because of the tax. 
In contrast, a lump-sum tax does not distort incentives. Because under a 
lump-sum tax people have to pay the same amount of tax regardless of their 
actions, it does not lead them to change their actions and therefore causes no 
deadweight loss. So lump-sum taxes, although unfair, are better than other taxes 
at promoting economic efficiency.
A tax system can be made fairer by moving it in the direction of the benefits 
principle or the ability-to-pay principle. But this will come at a cost because the 
tax system will now tax people more heavily based on their actions, increasing 
the amount of deadweight loss. This observation reflects a general principle that 
we learned in Chapter 1: there is often a trade-off between equity and efficiency. 
Here, unless a tax system is badly designed, it can be made fairer only by sac-
rificing efficiency. Conversely, it can be made more efficient only by making it 
less fair. This means that there is normally a trade-off between equity and 
efficiency in the design of a tax system.
It’s important to understand that economic analysis cannot say how much 
weight a tax system should give to equity and how much to efficiency. That choice 
is a value judgment, one we make through the political process.
According to the ability-to-pay 
principle of tax fairness, those with 
greater ability to pay a tax should pay 
more tax.
A lump-sum tax is the same for 
everyone, regardless of any actions 
people take.
In a well-designed tax system, there 
is a trade-off between equity and 
efficiency: the system can be made 
more efficient only by making it less 
fair, and vice versa.

FEDERAL TAX PHILOSOPHY
W
hat is the principle underlying the federal tax system? (By federal, we 
mean taxes collected by the federal government, as opposed to the taxes 
collected by state and local governments.) The answer is that it depends on 
the tax.
The best-known federal tax, accounting for about half 
of all federal revenue, is the income tax. The structure of 
the income tax reflects the ability-to-pay principle: fami-
lies with low incomes pay little or no income tax. In fact, 
some families pay negative income tax: a program known 
as the Earned Income Tax Credit “tops up,” or adds to, the 
earnings of low-wage workers. Meanwhile, those with high 
incomes not only pay a lot of income tax but also must pay 
a larger share of their income in income taxes than the 
average family.
The second most important federal tax, FICA, also 
known as the payroll tax, is set up very differently. 
It was originally introduced in 1935 to pay for Social 
Security, a program that guarantees retirement income 
to qualifying older Americans and also provides ben-
efits to workers who become disabled and to family 
members of workers who die. (Part of the payroll tax is 
now also used to pay for Medicare, a program that pays most medical bills 
of older Americans.) The Social Security system was set up to resemble a 
private insurance program: people pay into the system during their working 
years, then receive benefits based on their payments. And the tax more or 
less reflects the benefits principle: because the benefits of Social Security 
are mainly intended to assist lower- and middle-income people, and don’t 
increase substantially for the rich, the Social Security tax is levied only on 
incomes up to a maximum level—$106,800 in 2011. (The Medicare portion of 
the payroll tax continues to be levied on incomes over $106,800.) As a result, 
a high-income family doesn’t pay much more in payroll taxes than a middle-
income family.
Table 7-2 illustrates the difference in the two taxes, using data from 
a Congressional Budget Office study. The study divided American families 
into quintiles: the bottom quintile is the poorest 20% of families, the sec-
ond quintile is the next poorest 20%, and so on. The second column shows 
the share of total U.S. pre-tax income received by each quintile. The third 
column shows the share of total federal income tax collected that is paid by 
each quintile. 
As you can see, low-income fami-
lies actually paid negative income tax 
through the Earned Income Tax Credit 
program. Even middle-income families 
paid a substantially smaller share of 
total income tax collected than their 
share of total income. In contrast, the 
fifth or top quintile, the richest 20% 
of families, paid a much higher share 
of total federal income tax collected 
compared with their share of total 
income. The fourth column shows the 
share of total payroll tax collected that

Understanding the Tax System
A
n excise tax is the easiest tax to analyze, making it a good vehicle for under-
standing the general principles of tax analysis. However, in the United States 
today, excise taxes are actually a relatively minor source of government 
revenue. In this section, we develop a framework for understanding more general 
forms of taxation and look at some of the major taxes used in the United States.
Tax Bases and Tax Structure
Every tax consists of two pieces: a base and a structure. The tax base is the 
measure or value that determines how much tax an individual or firm pays. It is 
usually a monetary measure, like income or property value. The tax structure 
specifies how the tax depends on the tax base. It is usually expressed in percent-
age terms; for example, homeowners in some areas might pay yearly property 
taxes equal to 2% of the value of their homes.
Some important taxes and their tax bases are as follows:
 • Income tax: a tax that depends on the income of an individual or family from 
wages and investments
 • Payroll tax: a tax that depends on the earnings an employer pays to an 
employee
 • Sales tax: a tax that depends on the value of goods sold (also known as an 
excise tax)
 • Profits tax: a tax that depends on a firm’s profits
 • Property tax: a tax that depends on the value of property, such as the value 
of a home
 • Wealth tax: a tax that depends on an individual’s wealth
Once the tax base has been defined, the next question is how the tax depends 
on the base. The simplest tax structure is a proportional tax, also sometimes 
called a flat tax, which is the same percentage of the base regardless of the tax-
payer’s income or wealth. For example, a property tax that is set at 2% of the 
value of the property, whether the property is worth $10,000 or $10,000,000, is a 
proportional tax. Many taxes, however, are not proportional. Instead, different 
people pay different percentages, usually because the tax law tries to take account 
of either the benefits principle or the ability-to-pay principle.
• Other things equal, government tax 
policy aims for tax efficiency. But it 
also tries to achieve tax fairness, or 
tax equity.
• There are two important principles 
of tax fairness: the benefits princi-
ple and the ability-to-pay principle.
• A lump-sum tax is efficient because 
it does not distort incentives, but 
it is generally considered unfair. 
In any well-designed tax system, 
there is a trade-off between equity 
and efficiency. How the tax system 
should weight equity and efficiency 
is a value judgment to be decided 
by the political process.
 Quick Review
The tax base is the measure or 
value, such as income or property 
value, that determines how much tax 
an individual or firm pays.
The tax structure specifies how the 
tax depends on the tax base.
An income tax is a tax on an 
individual’s or family’s income.
A payroll tax is a tax on the 
earnings an employer pays to an 
employee.
A sales tax is a tax on the value of 
goods sold.
A profits tax is a tax on a firm’s 
profits.
A property tax is a tax on the value 
of property, such as the value of a 
home.
A wealth tax is a tax on an 
individual’s wealth.
A proportional tax is the same 
percentage of the tax base 
regardless of the taxpayer’s income 
or wealth.

C H A P T E R  7    TA X E S    201
Because taxes are ultimately paid out of income, economists classify taxes 
according to how they vary with the income of individuals. A tax that rises more 
than in proportion to income, so that high-income taxpayers pay a larger percent-
age of their income than low-income taxpayers, is a progressive tax. A tax that 
rises less than in proportion to income, so that higher-income taxpayers pay a 
smaller percentage of their income than low-income taxpayers, is a regressive 
tax. A proportional tax on income would be neither progressive nor regressive.
The U.S. tax system contains a mixture of progressive and regressive taxes, 
though it is somewhat progressive overall.
Equity, Efficiency, and Progressive Taxation
Most, though not all, people view a progressive tax system as fairer than a regres-
sive system. The reason is the ability-to-pay principle: a high-income family that 
pays 35% of its income in taxes is still left with a lot more money than a low-
income family that pays only 15% in taxes. But attempts to make taxes strongly 
progressive run up against the trade-off between equity and efficiency.
To see why, consider a hypothetical example, illustrated in Table 7-3. We 
assume that there are two kinds of people in the nation of Taxmania: half of the 
population earns $40,000 a year and half earns $80,000, so the aver-
age income is $60,000 a year. We also assume that the Taxmanian 
government needs to collect one-fourth of that income—$15,000 a 
year per person—in taxes.
One way to raise this revenue would be through a proportional tax 
that takes one-fourth of everyone’s income. The results of this propor-
tional tax are shown in the second column of Table 7-3: after taxes, 
lower-income Taxmanians would be left with an income of $30,000 a 
year and higher-income Taxmanians, $60,000.
Even this system might have some negative effects on incentives. 
Suppose, for example, that finishing college improves a Taxmanian’s chance 
of getting a higher-paying job. Some people who would invest time and effort 
in going to college in hopes of raising their income from $40,000 to $80,000, a 
$40,000 gain, might not bother if the potential gain is only $30,000, the after-tax 
difference in pay between a lower-paying and higher-paying job.
But a strongly progressive tax system could create a much bigger incentive 
problem. Suppose that the Taxmanian government decided to exempt the poorer 
half of the population from all taxes but still wanted to raise the same amount of 
revenue. To do this, it would have to collect $30,000 from each individual earning 
$80,000 a year. As the third column of Table 7-3 shows, people earning $80,000 
would then be left with income after taxes of $50,000—only $10,000 more than 
the after-tax income of people earning half as much. This would greatly reduce 
the incentive for people to invest time and effort to raise their earnings.
The point here is that any income tax system will tax away part of the gain 
an individual gets by moving up the income scale, reducing the incentive to earn 
more. But a progressive tax takes away a larger share of the gain than a propor-
tional tax, creating a more adverse effect on incentives. In comparing the incen-
tive effects of tax systems, economists often focus on the marginal tax rate: 
the percentage of an increase in income that is taxed away. In this example, the 
marginal tax rate on income above $40,000 is 25% with proportional taxation but 
75% with progressive taxation.
Our hypothetical example is much more extreme than the reality of progres-
sive taxation in the modern United States—although, as the Economics in Action 
explains, in previous years the marginal tax rates paid by high earners were very 
high indeed. However, these have moderated over time as concerns arose about 
the severe incentive effects of extremely progressive taxes. In short, the ability-
to-pay principle pushes governments toward a highly progressive tax system, but 
efficiency considerations push them the other way.

taxpayers than of low-income 
taxpayers.

Taxes in the United States
Table 7-4 shows the revenue raised by major taxes in the United States in 2010. 
Some of the taxes are collected by the federal government and the others by state 
and local governments.
There is a major tax corresponding to five of the six tax bases we 
identified earlier. There are income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, 
profits taxes, and property taxes, all of which play an important role 
in the overall tax system. The only item missing is a wealth tax. In 
fact, the United States does have a wealth tax, the estate tax, which 
depends on the value of someone’s estate after he or she dies. But at 
the time of writing, the current law phases out the estate tax over a 
few years, and in any case it raises much less money than the taxes 
shown in the table.
In addition to the taxes shown, state and local governments collect 
substantial revenue from other sources as varied as driver’s license 
fees and sewer charges. These fees and charges are an important part 
of the tax burden but very difficult to summarize or analyze.
Are the taxes in Table 7-4 progressive or regressive? It depends on the tax. The 
personal income tax is strongly progressive. The payroll tax, which, except for the 
Medicare portion, is paid only on earnings up to $106,800 is somewhat regressive. 
Sales taxes are generally regressive, because higher-income families save more 
of their income and thus spend a smaller share of it on taxable goods than do 
lower-income families. In addition, there are other taxes principally levied at the 
state and local level that are typically quite regressive: it costs the same amount 
to renew a driver’s license no matter what your income is.
Overall, the taxes collected by the federal government are quite progressive. The 
second column of Table 7-5 shows estimates of the average federal tax rate paid 
by families at different levels of income earned in 2004. 
These estimates don’t count just the money families pay 
directly. They also attempt to estimate the incidence of 
taxes directly paid by businesses, like the tax on corporate 
profits, which ultimately falls on individual sharehold-
ers. The table shows that the federal tax system is indeed 
progressive, with low-income families paying a relatively 
small share of their income in federal taxes and high-
income families paying a greater share of their income.
Since 2000, the federal government has cut income 
taxes for most families. The largest cuts, both as a share of 
income and as a share of federal taxes collected, have gone 
to families with high incomes. As a result, the federal sys-
tem is less progressive (at the time of writing) than it was 
in 2000 because the share of income paid by high-income 
families has fallen relative to the share paid by middle- 
and low-income families. And it will become even less progressive over the next 
few years, as some delayed pieces of the post-2000 tax cut legislation take effect. 
However, even after those changes, the federal tax system will remain progressive.
As the third column of Table 7-5 shows, however, taxes at the state and local 
levels are generally regressive. That’s because the sales tax, the largest source of 
revenue for most states, is somewhat regressive, and other items, such as vehicle 
licensing fees, are strongly regressive.
In sum, the U.S. tax system is somewhat progressive, with the richest fifth of 
the population paying a somewhat higher share of income in taxes than families 
in the middle and the poorest fifth paying considerably less.
Yet there are important differences within the American tax system: the fed-
eral income tax is more progressive than the payroll tax, which can be seen from 
Table 7-2. And federal taxation is more progressive than state and local taxation.

Different Taxes, Different Principles
Why are some taxes progressive but others regressive? Can’t the government 
make up its mind?
There are two main reasons for the mixture of regressive and progressive 
taxes in the U.S. system: the difference between levels of government and the fact 
that different taxes are based on different principles.
State and especially local governments generally do not make much effort 
to apply the ability-to-pay principle. This is largely because they are subject to 
tax competition: a state or local government that imposes high taxes on people 
with high incomes faces the prospect that those people may move to other loca-
tions where taxes are lower. This is much less of a concern at the national level, 
although a handful of very rich people have given up their U.S. citizenship to 
avoid paying U.S. taxes.
Although the federal government is in a better position than state or local 
governments to apply principles of fairness, it applies different principles to dif-
ferent taxes. We saw an example of this in the preceding Economics in Action. 
Everyone, everywhere complains about 
taxes. But citizens of the United States 
actually have less to complain about 
than citizens of most other wealthy 
countries.
To assess the overall level of taxes, 
economists usually calculate taxes as a 
share of gross domestic product—the 
total value of goods and services pro-
duced in a country. By this measure, as 
you can see in the accompanying figure, 
in 2009, U.S. taxes were near the bottom 
of the scale. Even our neighbor Canada 
has significantly higher taxes. Tax rates 
in Europe, where governments need a lot of revenue to pay for extensive benefits such as guaranteed health care and 
generous unemployment benefits, are 50% to 100% higher than in the United States.

The U.S. government taxes people 
mainly on the money they make, not on 
the money they spend on consumption. 
Yet most tax experts argue that this pol-
icy badly distorts incentives. Someone 
who earns income and then invests that 
income for the future gets taxed twice: 
once on the original sum and again on 
any earnings made from the investment. 
So a system that taxes income rather 
than consumption discourages people 
from saving and investing, instead 
providing an incentive to spend their 
income today. And encouraging sav-
ing and investing is an important policy 
goal, both because empirical data show 
that Americans tend to save too little 
for retirement and health expenses in 
their later years and because saving and 
investing contribute to economic growth.
Moving from a system that taxes 
income to one that taxes consump-
tion would solve this problem. In fact, 
the governments of many countries get 
much of their revenue from a value-
added tax, or VAT, which acts like a 
national sales tax. In some countries 
VAT rates are very high; in Sweden, for 
example, the rate is 25%.
The United States does not have 
a value-added tax for two main rea-
sons. One is that it is difficult, though 
not impossible, to make a consumption 
tax progressive. The other is that a 
VAT typically has very high administra-
tive costs.

The most important tax, the federal income tax, is strongly progressive, reflecting 
the ability-to-pay principle. But the second most important tax, the federal pay-
roll tax, or FICA, is somewhat regressive, because most of it is linked to specific 
programs—Social Security and Medicare—and, reflecting the benefits principle, 
is levied more or less in proportion to the benefits received from these programs.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE TOP MARGINAL INCOME TAX RATE
T
he amount of money an American owes in fed-
eral income taxes is found by applying marginal 
tax rates on successively higher “brackets” of income. 
For example, in 2010 a single person paid 10% on the 
first $8,375 of taxable income (that is, income after 
subtracting exemptions and deductions); 15% on the 
next $25,625; and so on up to a top rate of 35% on 
his or her income, if any, over $373,650. Relatively 
few people (less than 1% of taxpayers) have incomes 
high enough to pay the top marginal rate. In fact, 
72% of Americans pay no income tax or they fall into 
either the 10% or 15% bracket. But the top marginal 
income tax rate is often viewed as a useful indica-
tor of the progressivity of the tax system, because it 
shows just how high a tax rate the U.S. government 
is willing to impose on the very affluent.
Figure 7-11 shows the top marginal income tax rate from 1913, when the 
U.S. government first imposed an income tax, to 2010. The first big increase in 
the top marginal rate came during World War I (1914) and was reversed after 
the war ended (1918). After that, the figure is dominated by two big changes: a 
huge increase in the top marginal rate during the administration of Franklin 
Roosevelt (1933–1945) and a sharp reduction during the administration of 
Ronald Reagan (1981–1989). By comparison, recent changes have been relatively 
small potatoes.

 Quick Review

Comparison-shop for a book on Amazon versus BarnesandNoble.com, and it’s 
quite likely that the final price on Amazon is cheaper than on BarnesandNoble.
com. Why? Does BarnesandNoble.com like to gouge unwitting customers? Or is 
Amazon more efficient than its competitor?
The answer to both questions is no. It’s simply a matter of taxes—or, more spe-
cifically, who collects or doesn’t collect state sales tax on customer orders. Sales 
tax is levied on transactions of most nonessential goods and services in 45 states 
(the exceptions are Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), 
with the average sales tax bite about 8% of the purchase price. So, for example, if 
you compare the final price of Murder at the Margin by Marshall Jevons, shipped 
to New Jersey (the authors’ home state), the Amazon price is $25.98 versus the 
BarnesandNoble.com price of $27.52. As detailed in the accompanying table, the 
difference between the two prices is the $1.54 in New Jersey sales tax added to the 
final price by BarnesandNoble.com. (New Jersey has a 7% sales tax.) In contrast, 
Amazon doesn’t collect the tax on its orders to New Jersey. (See Table 7-6.)
This difference between Amazon and BarnesandNoble.com is the result of 
interstate tax law. According to the law, online retailers that don’t have a physical 
presence in a given state can sell products in that state without collecting sales 
tax. (The tax is still due, but residents are supposed to report the transaction and 
pay the tax themselves—a fact overlooked by online customers.) The advantage 
for Amazon is that it has a physical presence in very few 
states—only Kansas, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, and 
Washington. Amazon has also adopted a strategy of tax mini-
mization, often taking extreme measures, such as forbidding 
employees to work or even send e-mails while in certain states 
to avoid the possibility of triggering state tax levies. It collects 
sales tax only in states where it has a retail or corporate pres-
ence, such as Washington. In response to a tough new tax law 
in California, in June 2011 Amazon terminated its joint adver-
tising program with 25,000 California affiliates.
In contrast, the brick-and-mortar retailer Barnes and 
Noble, the parent company of BarnesandNoble.com, has bookstores in every 
state. (A brick-and-mortar retailer is one that has a physical store.) As a result, 
BarnesandNoble.com is compelled to collect sales tax on its online orders.
As reported in the Wall Street Journal, interviews and company documents 
have shown that Amazon believes that its tax policy is crucial to its success. It 
has been estimated that Amazon would have lost as much as $653 million in sales 
in 2011, or 1.4% of its annual revenue, if forced to collect sales tax. But its abil-
ity to avoid collecting sales tax is coming under assault by state tax authorities, 
hungry for new revenue during tough economic times. For example, Texas, where 
Amazon has a warehouse but no retail store, has tried to force it to begin col-
lecting state sales tax. And California authorities are claiming that Amazon must 
collect sales tax because it has affiliated vendors located in the state. In these and 
other cases, Amazon is fighting vigorously to retain its right not to collect sales 
tax. And it’s not hard to guess whose side BarnesandNoble.com is on.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. What effect do you think the difference in state sales tax collection has on Amazon’s sales 
versus BarnesandNoble.com’s sales? 
 2. Suppose sales tax is collected on all online books sales. From the evidence in this case, what do 
you think is the incidence of the tax between seller and buyer? What does this imply about the 
elasticity of supply of books by book retailers? (Hint: Compare the pre-tax prices of the book.)
 3. How do you think Amazon’s tax strategy has distorted its business behavior? What tax 
policy would eliminate those distortions?

SUMMARY
 1. Excise taxes—taxes on the purchase or sale of a 
good—raise the price paid by consumers and reduce the 
price received by producers, driving a wedge between 
the two. The incidence of the tax—how the burden of 
the tax is divided between consumers and producers—
does not depend on who officially pays the tax.
 2. The incidence of an excise tax depends on the price 
elasticities of supply and demand. If the price elasticity 
of demand is higher than the price elasticity of supply, 
the tax falls mainly on producers; if the price elasticity 
of supply is higher than the price elasticity of demand, 
the tax falls mainly on consumers.
 3. The tax revenue generated by a tax depends on the 
tax rate and on the number of taxed units transacted. 
Excise taxes cause inefficiency in the form of dead-
weight loss because they discourage some mutually 
beneficial transactions. Taxes also impose administra-
tive costs: resources used to collect the tax, to pay it 
(over and above the amount of the tax), and to evade it.
 4. An excise tax generates revenue for the government but 
lowers total surplus. The loss in total surplus exceeds 
the tax revenue, resulting in a deadweight loss to soci-
ety. This deadweight loss is represented by a triangle, 
the area of which equals the value of the transactions 
discouraged by the tax. The greater the elasticity of 
demand or supply, or both, the larger the deadweight 
loss from a tax. If either demand or supply is perfectly 
inelastic, there is no deadweight loss from a tax.
 5. An efficient tax minimizes both the sum of the dead-
weight loss due to distorted incentives and the admin-
istrative costs of the tax. However, tax fairness, or tax 
equity, is also a goal of tax policy.
 6. There are two major principles of tax fairness, the ben-
efits principle and the ability-to-pay principle. The 
most efficient tax, a lump-sum tax, does not distort 
incentives but performs badly in terms of fairness. The 
fairest taxes in terms of the ability-to-pay principle, 
however, distort incentives the most and perform badly 
on efficiency grounds. So in a well-designed tax system, 
there is a trade-off between equity and efficiency.
 7. Every tax consists of a tax base, which defines what 
is taxed, and a tax structure, which specifies how the 
tax depends on the tax base. Different tax bases give 
rise to different taxes—the income tax, payroll tax, 
sales tax, profits tax, property tax, and wealth 
tax. A proportional tax is the same percentage of the 
tax base for all taxpayers.
 8. A tax is progressive if higher-income people pay a 
higher percentage of their income in taxes than lower-
income people and regressive if they pay a lower 
percentage. Progressive taxes are often justified by the 
ability-to-pay principle. However, a highly progressive 
tax system significantly distorts incentives because it 
leads to a high marginal tax rate, the percentage of an 
increase in income that is taxed away, on high earners. 
The U.S. tax system is progressive overall, although it 
contains a mixture of progressive and regressive taxes.

PROBLEMS
 1. The United States imposes an excise tax on the sale of 
domestic airline tickets. Let’s assume that in 2010 the 
total excise tax was $6.10 per airline ticket (consisting of 
the $3.60 flight segment tax plus the $2.50 September 11 
fee). According to data from the Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics, in 2010, 630 million passengers traveled on 
domestic airline trips at an average price of $337 per trip. 
The accompanying table shows the supply and demand 
schedules for airline trips. The quantity demanded at the 
average price of $337 is actual data; the rest is hypothetical.

 2. The U.S. government would like to help the American 
auto industry compete against foreign automakers 
that sell trucks in the United States. It can do this by 
imposing an excise tax on each foreign truck sold in the 
United States. The hypothetical pre-tax demand and 
supply schedules for imported trucks are given in the 
accompanying table.

 3. In 1990, the United States began to levy a tax on sales 
of luxury cars. For simplicity, assume that the tax was 
an excise tax of $6,000 per car. The accompanying fig-

Over time, the tax on luxury automobiles was slow-
ly phased out (and completely eliminated in 2002). 
Suppose that the excise tax falls from $6,000 per car to 
$4,500 per car.
 b. After the reduction in the excise tax from $6,000 to 
$4,500 per car, what is the price paid by consumers? 
What is the price received by producers? What is tax 
revenue now?

revenue from the reduction in the excise tax?
 4. All states impose excise taxes on gasoline. According to 
data from the Federal Highway Administration, the state 
of California imposes an excise tax of $0.18 per gallon 
of gasoline. In 2009, gasoline sales in California totaled 
14.8 billion gallons. What was California’s tax revenue 
from the gasoline excise tax? If California doubled the 
excise tax, would tax revenue double? Why or why not?
 5. In the United States, each state government can 
impose its own excise tax on the sale of cigarettes. 
Suppose that in the state of North Texarkana, the 
state government imposes a tax of $2.00 per pack sold 
within the state. In contrast, the neighboring state of 
South Texarkana imposes no excise tax on cigarettes. 
Assume that in both states the pre-tax price of a pack 
of cigarettes is $1.00. Assume that the total cost to a 
resident of North Texarkana to smuggle a pack of ciga-
rettes from South Texarkana is $1.85 per pack. (This 
includes the cost of time, gasoline, and so on.) Assume 
that the supply curve for cigarettes is neither perfectly 
elastic nor perfectly inelastic.

 a. Draw a diagram of the supply and demand curves 
for cigarettes in North Texarkana showing a situa-
tion in which it makes economic sense for a North 
Texarkanan to smuggle a pack of cigarettes from 
South Texarkana to North Texarkana. Explain your 
diagram.
 b. Draw a corresponding diagram showing a situa-
tion in which it does not make economic sense for 
a North Texarkanan to smuggle a pack of cigarettes 
from South Texarkana to North Texarkana. Explain 
your diagram.
 c. Suppose the demand for cigarettes in North 
Texarkana is perfectly inelastic. How high could 
the cost of smuggling a pack of cigarettes go until a 
North Texarkanan no longer found it profitable to 
smuggle?
 d. Still assume that demand for cigarettes in North 
Texarkana is perfectly inelastic and that all smok-
ers in North Texarkana are smuggling their ciga-
rettes at a cost of $1.85 per pack, so no tax is paid. 
Is there any inefficiency in this situation? If so, 
how much per pack? Suppose chip-embedded cig-
arette packaging makes it impossible to smuggle 
cigarettes across the state border. Is there any 
inefficiency in this situation? If so, how much 
per pack?
 6. In each of the following cases involving taxes, explain: 
(i) whether the incidence of the tax falls more heavily on 
consumers or producers, (ii) why government revenue 
raised from the tax is not a good indicator of the true 
cost of the tax, and (iii) how deadweight loss arises as a 
result of the tax.
 a. The government imposes an excise tax on the sale of 
all college textbooks. Before the tax was imposed, 1 
million textbooks were sold every year at a price of 
$50. After the tax is imposed, 600,000 books are sold 
yearly; students pay $55 per book, $30 of which pub-
lishers receive.
 b. The government imposes an excise tax on the sale 
of all airline tickets. Before the tax was imposed, 3 
million airline tickets were sold every year at a price 
of $500. After the tax is imposed, 1.5 million tickets 
are sold yearly; travelers pay $550 per ticket, $450 of 
which the airlines receive.
 c. The government imposes an excise tax on the sale 
of all toothbrushes. Before the tax, 2 million tooth-
brushes were sold every year at a price of $1.50. 
After the tax is imposed, 800,000 toothbrushes are 
sold every year; consumers pay $2 per toothbrush, 
$1.25 of which producers receive.
 7. The accompanying diagram shows the market for 
cigarettes. The current equilibrium price per pack is 
$4, and every day 40 million packs of cigarettes are 
sold. In order to recover some of the health care costs 
associated with smoking, the government imposes a 
tax of $2 per pack. This will raise the equilibrium price 
to $5 per pack and reduce the equilibrium quantity to 
30 million packs.

The economist working for the tobacco lobby claims 
that this tax will reduce consumer surplus for smok-
ers by $40 million per day, since 40 million packs now 
cost $1 more per pack. The economist working for 
the lobby for sufferers of second-hand smoke argues 
that this is an enormous overestimate and that the 
reduction in consumer surplus will be only $30 mil-
lion per day, since after the imposition of the tax only 
30 million packs of cigarettes will be bought and each 
of these packs will now cost $1 more. They are both 
wrong. Why?
 8. Consider the original market for pizza in Collegetown, 
illustrated in the accompanying table. Collegetown offi-

 c. How much tax revenue does Collegetown earn from 
this tax?
 d. Calculate the deadweight loss from this tax.
 9. The state needs to raise money, and the governor has 
a choice of imposing an excise tax of the same amount 
on one of two previously untaxed goods: the state can 
tax sales of either restaurant meals or gasoline. Both 
the demand for and the supply of restaurant meals are 
more elastic than the demand for and the supply of 
gasoline. If the governor wants to minimize the dead-
weight loss caused by the tax, which good should be 
taxed? For each good, draw a diagram that illustrates 
the deadweight loss from taxation.
 10. Assume that the demand for gasoline is inelastic and 
supply is relatively elastic. The government imposes a 
sales tax on gasoline. The tax revenue is used to fund 
research into clean fuel alternatives to gasoline, which 
will improve the air we all breathe.
 a. Who bears more of the burden of this tax, consum-
ers or producers? Show in a diagram who bears how 
much of the excess burden.
 b. Is this tax based on the benefits principle or the 
ability-to-pay principle? Explain.
 11. Assess the following four tax policies in terms of the 
benefits principle versus the ability-to-pay principle.
 a. A tax on gasoline that finances maintenance of state 
roads
 b. An 8% tax on imported goods valued in excess of 
$800 per household brought in on passenger flights
 c. Airline-flight landing fees that pay for air traffic control
 d. A reduction in the amount of income tax paid based 
on the number of dependent children in the household.
12. You are advising the government on how to pay for 
national defense. There are two proposals for a tax sys-
tem to fund national defense. Under both proposals, the 
tax base is an individual’s income. Under proposal A, all 
citizens pay exactly the same lump-sum tax, regardless 
of income. Under proposal B, individuals with higher 
incomes pay a greater proportion of their income in 
taxes.
 a. Is the tax in proposal A progressive, proportional, or 
regressive? What about the tax in proposal B?
 b. Is the tax in proposal A based on the ability-to-pay 
principle or on the benefits principle? What about 
the tax in proposal B?
 c. In terms of efficiency, which tax is better? Explain.
 13. Each of the following tax proposals has income as the 
tax base. In each case, calculate the marginal tax rate 
for each level of income. Then calculate the percentage 
of income paid in taxes for an individual with a pre-tax 
income of $5,000 and for an individual with a pre-tax 
income of $40,000. Classify the tax as being proportion-
al, progressive, or regressive. (Hint: You can calculate 
the marginal tax rate as the percentage of an additional 
$1 in income that is taxed away.)
 a. All income is taxed at 20%.
 b. All income up to $10,000 is tax-free. All income 
above $10,000 is taxed at a constant rate of 20%.
 c. All income between $0 and $10,000 is taxed at 10%. 
All income between $10,000 and $20,000 is taxed at 
20%. All income higher than $20,000 is taxed at 30%.
 d. Each individual who earns more than $10,000 pays a 
lump-sum tax of $10,000. If the individual’s income 
is less than $10,000, that individual pays in taxes 
exactly what his or her income is.
 e. Of the four tax policies, which is likely to cause the 
worst incentive problems? Explain.
 14. In Transylvania the basic income tax system is fairly 
simple. The first 40,000 sylvers (the official currency of 
Transylvania) earned each year are free of income tax. 
Any additional income is taxed at a rate of 25%. In addi-
tion, every individual pays a social security tax, which 
is calculated as follows: all income up to 80,000 sylvers 
is taxed at an additional 20%, but there is no additional 
social security tax on income above 80,000 sylvers.
 a. Calculate the marginal tax rates (including income 
tax and social security tax) for Transylvanians with 
the following levels of income: 20,000 sylvers, 40,000 
sylvers, and 80,000 sylvers. (Hint: You can calculate 
the marginal tax rate as the percentage of an addi-
tional 1 sylver in income that is taxed away.)
 b. Is the income tax in Transylvania progressive, 
regressive, or proportional? Is the social security tax 
progressive, regressive, or proportional?
 c. Which income group’s incentives are most adversely 
affected by the combined income and social security 
tax systems?
 15. You work for the Council of Economic Advisers, provid-
ing economic advice to the White House. The president 
wants to overhaul the income tax system and asks your 
advice. Suppose that the current income tax system 
consists of a proportional tax of 10% on all income and 
that there is one person in the country who earns $110 
million; everyone else earns less than $100 million. The 
president proposes a tax cut targeted at the very rich 
so that the new tax system would consist of a propor-
tional tax of 10% on all income up to $100 million and a 
marginal tax rate of 0% (no tax) on income above $100 
million. You are asked to evaluate this tax proposal.
 a. For incomes of $100 million or less, is this tax sys-
tem progressive, regressive, or proportional? For 
incomes of more than $100 million? Explain.
 b. Would this tax system create more or less tax rev-
enue, other things equal? Is this tax system more or 
less efficient than the current tax system? Explain.

CHAPTER 8
S
TOP IN AN AUTO SHOWROOM, 
and odds are that the majority of 
cars on display were produced in the 
United States. Even if they’re Nissans, 
Hondas, or Volkswagens, most cars sold 
in this country were made here by the Big 
Three U.S. auto firms or by subsidiaries 
of foreign firms. The cars are assembled 
in “Auto Alley,” a north–south corridor 
roughly defined as the space between 
Interstate 65, which runs from Chicago to 
Mobile, and Interstate 75, which runs from 
Detroit to western Florida.
Although that car you’re looking at 
may have been made in America, a 
significant part of what’s inside was 
probably made elsewhere, very likely in 
Mexico. Since the 1980s, U.S. auto pro-
duction has increasingly relied on facto-
ries in Mexico to produce labor-intensive
auto parts, such as seat parts—products 
that use a relatively high amount of labor 
in their production.
Changes in economic policy over the 
years have contributed greatly to the 
emergence of large-scale U.S. imports 
of auto parts from Mexico. Until the 
1980s, Mexico had a system of trade 
protection—taxes and regulations lim-
iting imports—that both kept out U.S. 
manufactured goods and encouraged 
Mexican industry to focus on selling 
to Mexican consumers rather than to 
a wider market. In 1985, however, the 
Mexican government began dismantling 
much of its trade protection, boosting 
trade with the United States. A further 
boost came in 1993, when the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada signed the 
North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), which eliminated most taxes 
on trade among the three nations and pro-
vided guarantees that business invest-
ments in Mexico would be protected from 
arbitrary changes in government policy.
NAFTA was deeply controversial 
when it went into effect: Mexican work-
ers were paid only about 10% as much 
as their U.S. counterparts, and many 
expressed concern that U.S. jobs would 
be lost to low-wage competition. Most 
memorably, Ross Perot, a U.S. presiden-
tial candidate in 1992, warned that there 
would be a “giant sucking sound” as 
U.S. manufacturing moved south of the 
border. And although apocalyptic pre-
dictions about NAFTA’s impact haven’t 
come to pass, the agreement remains 
controversial even now.
Most economists disagreed with 
those who saw NAFTA as a threat to the 
U.S. economy. We saw in Chapter 2, how 
international trade can lead to mutual 
gains from trade. Economists, for the most 
part, believed that the same logic applied 
to NAFTA, that the treaty would make 
both the United States and Mexico richer. 
But making a nation as a whole richer 
isn’t the same thing as improving the 
welfare of everyone living in a country, 
and there were and are reasons to believe 
that NAFTA hurts some U.S. citizens.
Until now, we have analyzed the 
economy as if it were self-sufficient, as if 
the economy produces all the goods and 
services it consumes, and vice versa. 
This is, of course, true for the world 
economy as a whole. But it’s not true for 
any individual country. Assuming self-
sufficiency would have been far more 
accurate 50 years ago, when the United 
States exported only a small fraction of 
what it produced and imported only a 
small fraction of what it consumed.
Since then, however, both U.S. 
imports and exports have grown much 
faster than the U.S. economy as a whole. 
Moreover, compared to the United 
States, other countries engage in far 
more foreign trade relative to the size of 
their economies. To have a full picture of 
how national economies work, we must 
understand international trade.
This chapter examines the economics 
of international trade. We start from the 
model of comparative advantage, which, 
as we saw in Chapter 2, explains why 
there are gains from international trade. 
We will briefly recap that model here, and

Comparative Advantage and 
International Trade
T
he United States buys auto parts—and many other goods and services—
from other countries. At the same time, it sells many goods and services to 
other countries. Goods and services purchased from abroad are imports; 
goods and services sold abroad are exports.
As illustrated by the opening story, imports and exports have taken on 
an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy. Over the last 50 years, both 
imports into and exports from the United States have grown faster than the 
U.S. economy. Panel (a) of Figure 8-1 shows how the values of U.S. imports and 
exports have grown as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Panel (b) 
shows imports and exports as a percentage of GDP for a number of countries. It 
shows that foreign trade is significantly more important for many other countries 
than it is for the United States. (Japan is the exception.)
Foreign trade isn’t the only way countries interact economically. In the mod-
ern world, investors from one country often invest funds in another nation; many 
companies are multinational, with subsidiaries operating in several countries; 
and a growing number of individuals work in a country different from the one in 
which they were born. The growth of all these forms of economic linkages among 
countries is often called globalization.

then extend our study to address deeper 
questions about international trade, such 
as why some individuals can be hurt by 
international trade while the country, as a 
whole, gains. At the conclusion of the chap-
ter, we’ll examine the effects of policies that 
countries use to limit imports or promote 
exports as well as how governments work 
together to overcome barriers to trade.

In this chapter, however, we’ll focus mainly on international trade. To under-
stand why international trade occurs and why economists believe it is beneficial 
to the economy, we will first review the concept of comparative advantage.
Production Possibilities and Comparative 
Advantage, Revisited
To produce auto parts, any country must use resources—land, labor, capital, and 
so on—that could have been used to produce other things. The potential produc-
tion of other goods a country must forgo to produce an auto part is the opportu-
nity cost of that part.
In some cases, it’s easy to see why the opportunity cost of producing a good 
is especially low in a given country. Consider, for example, shrimp—much 
of which now comes from seafood farms in Vietnam and Thailand. It’s a lot 
easier to produce shrimp in Vietnam, where the climate is nearly ideal and 
there’s plenty of coastal land suitable for shellfish farming, than it is in the 
United States. Conversely, other goods are not produced as easily in Vietnam 
as in the United States. For example, Vietnam doesn’t have the base of skilled 
workers and technological know-how that makes the United States so good at 
producing high-technology goods. So the opportunity cost of a ton of shrimp, 
in terms of other goods such as aircraft, is much less in Vietnam than it is in 
the United States.
In other cases, matters are a bit less obvious. It’s as easy to produce auto parts 
in the United States as it is in Mexico, and Mexican auto parts workers are, if 
anything, less efficient than their U.S. counterparts. But Mexican workers are a 
lot less productive than U.S. workers in other areas, such as aircraft and chemical 
production. This means that diverting a Mexican worker into auto parts produc-
tion reduces output of other goods less than diverting a U.S. worker into auto 
parts production. That is, the opportunity cost of producing auto parts in Mexico 
is less than it is in the United States.
So we say that Mexico has a comparative advantage in producing auto 
parts. Let’s repeat the definition of comparative advantage from Chapter 2: 
A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good or service if the 
opportunity cost of producing the good or service is lower for that country than 
for other countries.
Figure 8-2 provides a hypothetical numerical example of comparative advan-
tage in international trade. We assume that only two goods are produced and 
consumed, auto parts and airplanes, and that there are only two countries in 
the world, the United States and Mexico. (In real life, auto parts aren’t worth 
much without auto bodies to put them in, but let’s set that issue aside). The 
figure shows hypothetical production possibility frontiers for the United States 
and Mexico.
As in Chapter 2, we simplify the model by assuming that the production 
possibility frontiers are straight lines, as shown in Figure 2-1, rather than the 
more realistic bowed-out shape shown in Figure 2-2. The straight-line shape 
implies that the opportunity cost of an auto part in terms of airplanes in each 
country is constant—it does not depend on how many units of each good 
the country produces. The analysis of international trade under the assump-
tion that opportunity costs are constant, which makes production possibility 
frontiers straight lines, is known as the Ricardian model of international 
trade, named after the English economist David Ricardo, who introduced this 
analysis in the early nineteenth century.
In Figure 8-2 we have grouped auto parts into bundles of 10,000, so, for 
example, a country that produces 500 bundles of auto parts is producing 5 mil-
lion individual auto parts. You can see in the figure that the United States can 
produce 2,000 airplanes if it produces no auto parts, or 1,000 bundles of auto

parts if it produces no airplanes. Thus, the slope of the U.S. production possibility 
frontier, or PPF, is −2,000/1,000 = −2. That is, to produce an additional bundle of 
auto parts, the United States must forgo the production of 2 airplanes. 
Similarly, Mexico can produce 1,000 airplanes if it produces no auto parts or 
2,000 bundles of auto parts if it produces no airplanes. Thus, the slope of Mexico’s 
PPF is −1,000/2,000 = −1/2. That is, to produce an additional bundle of auto parts, 
Mexico must forgo the production of 1/2 an airplane. 
Economists use the term autarky to refer to a situation in which a country 
does not trade with other countries. We assume that in autarky the United States 
chooses to produce and consume 500 bundles of auto parts and 1,000 airplanes. 
We also assume that in autarky Mexico produces 1,000 bundles of auto parts and 
500 airplanes.
The trade-offs facing the two countries when they don’t trade are summarized 
in Table 8-1. As you can see, the United States has a comparative advantage in 
the production of airplanes because it 
has a lower opportunity cost in terms of 
auto parts than Mexico has: producing an 
airplane costs the United States only ½ a 
bundle of auto parts, while it costs Mexico 
2 bundles of auto parts. Correspondingly, 
Mexico has a comparative advantage in 
auto parts production: 1 bundle costs it 
only ½ an airplane, while it costs the United States 2 airplanes. 
As we learned in Chapter 2, each country can do better by engaging in trade 
than it could by not trading. A country can accomplish this by specializing in the 
production of the good in which it has a comparative advantage and exporting 
that good, while importing the good in which it has a comparative disadvantage. 
Let’s see how this works. 
Autarky is a situation in which a 
country does not trade with other 
countries.

The U.S. opportunity cost of 1 bundle of auto parts in 
terms of airplanes is 2: for every additional bundle of 
auto parts, 2 airplanes must be forgone. The Mexican 
opportunity cost of 1 bundle of auto parts in terms of 
airplanes is ½: for every additional bundle of auto parts, 
only ½ of an airplane must be forgone. As a result, the 
United States has a comparative advantage in airplane 
production, and Mexico has a comparative advantage in 
auto parts production. In autarky, each country is forced 
to consume only what it produces: 1,000 airplanes and 
500 bundles of auto parts for the United States; 500 
airplanes and 1,000 bundles of auto parts for Mexico.

The Gains from International Trade
Figure 8-3 illustrates how both countries can gain from specialization and trade, 
by showing a hypothetical rearrangement of production and consumption that 
allows each country to consume more of both goods. Again, panel (a) represents 
the United States and panel (b) represents Mexico. In each panel we indicate 
again the autarky production and consumption assumed in Figure 8-2. Once 
trade becomes possible, however, everything changes. With trade, each country 
can move to producing only the good in which it has a comparative advantage—
airplanes for the United States and auto parts for Mexico. Because the world 
production of both goods is now higher than in autarky, trade makes it possible 
for each country to consume more of both goods.
Table 8-2 sums up the changes as a result of trade and shows why both 
countries can gain. The left part of the table shows the autarky situation, 
before trade, in which each country must produce the goods it consumes. The 
right part of the table shows what happens as a result of trade. After trade, the 
United States specializes in the production of airplanes, producing 2,000 air-
planes and no auto parts; Mexico specializes in the production of auto parts, 
producing 2,000 bundles of auto parts and no airplanes.

Trade increases world production of both goods, 
allowing both countries to consume more. Here, each 
country specializes its production as a result of trade: 
the United States concentrates on producing airplanes, 
and Mexico concentrates on producing auto parts. Total 
world production of both goods rises, which means that 
it is possible for both countries to consume more of 
both goods.

The result is a rise in total world production of both goods. As you can see 
in the Table 8-2 column at far right showing consumption with trade, the United 
States is able to consume both more airplanes and more auto parts than before, 
even though it no longer produces auto parts, because it can import parts from 
Mexico. Mexico can also consume more of both goods, even though it no longer 
produces airplanes, because it can import airplanes from the United States.
The key to this mutual gain is the fact that trade liberates both countries 
from self-sufficiency—from the need to produce the same mixes of goods they 
consume. Because each country can concentrate on producing the good in which 
it has a comparative advantage, total world production rises, making a higher 
standard of living possible in both nations.
Now, in this example we have simply assumed the post-trade consumption 
bundles of the two countries. In fact, the consumption choices of a country reflect 
both the preferences of its residents and the relative prices—the prices of one good 
in terms of another in international markets. Although we have not explicitly 
given the price of airplanes in terms of auto parts, that price is implicit in our 
example: Mexico sells the United States the 750 bundles of auto parts the U.S. 
consumes in return for the 750 airplanes Mexico consumes, so 1 bundle of parts 
is traded for 1 airplane. This tells us that the price of an airplane on world mar-
kets must be equal to the price of one bundle of 10,000 auto parts in our example.
One requirement that the relative price must satisfy is that no country pays a 
relative price greater than its opportunity cost of obtaining the good in autarky. 
That is, the United States won’t pay more than 2 airplanes for each 1 bundle of 
10,000 auto parts from Mexico, and Mexico won’t pay more than 2 bundles 
of 10,000 auto parts for each 1 airplane from the United States. Once this require-
ment is satisfied, the actual relative price in international trade is determined by 
supply and demand—and we’ll turn to supply and demand in international trade 
in the next section. However, first let’s look more deeply into the nature of the 
gains from trade.
Comparative Advantage versus Absolute Advantage
It’s easy to accept the idea that Vietnam and Thailand have a comparative 
advantage in shrimp production: they have a tropical climate that’s better suited 
to shrimp farming than that of the United States (even along the Gulf Coast), 
and they have a lot of usable coastal area. So the United States imports shrimp 
from Vietnam and Thailand. In other cases, however, it may be harder to under-
stand why we import certain goods from abroad.
U.S. imports of auto parts from Mexico is a case in point. There’s 
nothing about Mexico’s climate or resources that makes it especially 
good at manufacturing auto parts. In fact, it almost surely takes 
fewer hours of labor to produce an auto seat or wiring harness in 
the United States than in Mexico.
Why, then, do we buy Mexican auto parts? Because the gains 
from trade depend on comparative advantage, not absolute advan-
tage. Yes, it takes less labor to produce a wiring harness in the 
United States than in Mexico. That is, the productivity of Mexican 
auto parts workers is less than that of their U.S. counterparts. 
But what determines comparative advantage is not the amount of 
resources used to produce a good but the opportunity cost of that 
good—here, the quantity of other goods forgone in order to produce 
an auto seat. And the opportunity cost of auto parts is lower in 
Mexico than in the United States.
Here’s how it works: Mexican workers have low productivity com-
pared with U.S. workers in the auto parts industry. But Mexican work-
ers have even lower productivity compared with U.S. workers in other 
With their tropical climate, Vietnam and Thailand have a
comparative advantage in shrimp production.

industries. Because Mexican labor productivity in industries other than auto parts is 
relatively very low, producing a wiring harness in Mexico, even though it takes a lot 
of labor, does not require forgoing the production of large quantities of other goods.
In the United States, the opposite is true: very high productivity in other 
industries (such as high-technology goods) means that producing an auto seat in 
the United States, even though it doesn’t require much labor, requires sacrific-
ing lots of other goods. So the opportunity cost of producing auto parts is less 
in Mexico than in the United States. Despite its lower labor productivity, Mexico 
has a comparative advantage in the production of many auto parts, although the 
United States has an absolute advantage.
Mexico’s comparative advantage in auto parts is reflected in global markets 
by the wages Mexican workers are paid. That’s because a country’s wage rates, 
in general, reflect its labor productivity. In countries where labor is highly pro-
ductive in many industries, employers are willing to pay high wages to attract 
workers, so competition among employers leads to an overall high wage rate. In 
countries where labor is less productive, competition for workers is less intense 
and wage rates are correspondingly lower.
As the accompanying Global Comparison shows, there is indeed a strong rela-
tionship between overall levels of productivity and wage rates around the world. 
Because Mexico has generally low productivity, it has a relatively low wage rate. 
Low wages, in turn, give Mexico a cost advantage in producing goods where its 
productivity is only moderately low, like auto parts. As a result, it’s cheaper to 
produce these parts in Mexico than in the United States.
The kind of trade that takes place between low-wage, low-productivity econo-
mies like Mexico and high-wage, high-productivity economies like the United 
States gives rise to two common misperceptions. One, the pauper labor fallacy,
is the belief that when a country with high wages imports goods produced by 
workers who are paid low wages, this must hurt the standard of living of workers 
in the importing country. The other, the sweatshop labor fallacy, is the belief that 
Is it true that both the pauper labor argument and the 
sweatshop labor argument are fallacies? Yes, it is. The 
real explanation for low wages in poor countries is low 
overall productivity.
The graph shows estimates of labor productivity, mea-
sured by the value of output (GDP) per worker, and wages, 
measured by the monthly compensation of the average 
worker, for several countries in 2009. Both productivity and 
wages are expressed as percentages of U.S. productivity 
and wages; for example, productivity and wages in Japan 
were 79% and 91%, respectively, of their U.S. levels. You 
can see the strong positive relationship between productiv-
ity and wages. The relationship isn’t perfect. For example, 
Germany has higher wages than its productivity might lead 
you to expect. But simple comparisons of wages give a 
misleading sense of labor costs in poor countries: their low-
wage advantage is mostly offset by low productivity.

trade must be bad for workers in poor exporting countries because those workers 
are paid very low wages by our standards.
Both fallacies miss the nature of gains from trade: it’s to the advantage of 
both countries if the poorer, lower-wage country exports goods in which it has 
a comparative advantage, even if its cost advantage in these goods depends on 
low wages. That is, both countries are able to achieve a higher standard of living 
through trade.
It’s particularly important to understand that buying a good made by some-
one who is paid much lower wages than most U.S. workers doesn’t necessarily 
imply that you’re taking advantage of that person. It depends on the alternatives. 
Because workers in poor countries have low productivity across the board, they 
are offered low wages whether they produce goods exported to America or goods 
sold in local markets. A job that looks terrible by rich-country standards can be 
a step up for someone in a poor country.
International trade that depends on low-wage exports can nonetheless raise 
a country’s standard of living. This is especially true of very-low-wage nations. 
For example, Bangladesh and similar countries would be much poorer than they 
are—their citizens might even be starving—if they weren’t able to export goods 
such as clothing based on their low wage rates.
Sources of Comparative Advantage
International trade is driven by comparative advantage, but where does com-
parative advantage come from? Economists who study international trade have 
found three main sources of comparative advantage: international differences in 
climate, international differences in factor endowments, and international differ-
ences in technology.
Differences in Climate One key reason the opportunity cost of producing 
shrimp in Vietnam and Thailand is less than in the United States is that shrimp 
need warm water—Vietnam has plenty of that, but America doesn’t. In general, 
differences in climate play a significant role in international trade. Tropical coun-
tries export tropical products like coffee, sugar, bananas, and shrimp. Countries 
in the temperate zones export crops like wheat and corn. Some trade is even 
driven by the difference in seasons between the northern and southern hemi-
spheres: winter deliveries of Chilean grapes and New Zealand apples have become 
commonplace in U.S. and European supermarkets.
Differences in Factor Endowments Canada is a major exporter of forest 
products—lumber and products derived from lumber, like pulp and paper—to 
the United States. These exports don’t reflect the special skill of Canadian lum-
berjacks. Canada has a comparative advantage in forest products because its 
forested area is much greater compared to the size of its labor force than the ratio 
of forestland to the labor force in the United States.
Forestland, like labor and capital, is a factor of production: an input used to 
produce goods and services. (Recall from Chapter 2 that the factors of produc-
tion are land, labor, capital, and human capital.) Due to history and geography, 
the mix of available factors of production differs among countries, providing an 
important source of comparative advantage. The relationship between compara-
tive advantage and factor availability is found in an influential model of interna-
tional trade, the Heckscher–Ohlin model, developed by two Swedish economists 
in the first half of the twentieth century.
Two key concepts in the model are factor abundance and factor intensity. 
Factor abundance refers to how large a country’s supply of a factor is relative to 
its supply of other factors. Factor intensity refers to the fact that producers use 
different ratios of factors of production in the production of different goods. For 

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    219
example, oil refineries use much more capital per worker than clothing factories. 
Economists use the term factor intensity to describe this difference among 
goods: oil refining is capital-intensive, because it tends to use a high ratio of capi-
tal to labor, but auto seats production is labor-intensive, because it tends to use a 
high ratio of labor to capital.
According to the Heckscher–Ohlin model, a country that has an abun-
dant supply of a factor of production will have a comparative advantage in goods 
whose production is intensive in that factor. So a country that has a relative 
abundance of capital will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive 
industries such as oil refining, but a country that has a relative abundance of 
labor will have a comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries such as 
auto seats production.
The basic intuition behind this result is simple and based on opportunity cost. 
The opportunity cost of a given factor—the value that the factor would generate in 
alternative uses—is low for a country when it is relatively abundant in that factor. 
Relative to the United States, Mexico has an abundance of low-skilled labor. As a 
result, the opportunity cost of the production of low-skilled, labor-intensive goods 
is lower in Mexico than in the United States.
The most dramatic example of the validity of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is 
world trade in clothing. Clothing production is a labor-intensive activity: it doesn’t 
take much physical capital, nor does it require a lot of human capital in the form 
of highly educated workers. So you would expect labor-abundant countries such 
as China and Bangladesh to have a comparative advantage in clothing produc-
tion. And they do.
That much international trade is the result of differences in factor endow-
ments helps explain another fact: international specialization of production is 
often incomplete. That is, a country often maintains some domestic produc-
tion of a good that it imports. A good example of this is the United States and 
oil. Saudi Arabia exports oil to the United States because Saudi Arabia has an 
abundant supply of oil relative to its other factors of production; the United 
States exports medical devices to Saudi Arabia because it has an abundant 
supply of expertise in medical technology relative to its other factors of pro-
duction. But the United States also produces some oil domestically because 
the size of its domestic oil reserves in Texas and Alaska makes it economical 
to do so.
In our supply and demand analysis in the next section, we’ll consider incom-
plete specialization by a country to be the norm. We should emphasize, however, 
that the fact that countries often incompletely specialize does not in any way 
change the conclusion that there are gains from trade.
Differences in Technology In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan became by far 
the world’s largest exporter of automobiles, selling large numbers to the United 
States and the rest of the world. Japan’s comparative advantage in automobiles 
wasn’t the result of climate. Nor can it easily be attributed to differences in fac-
tor endowments: aside from a scarcity of land, Japan’s mix of available factors 
is quite similar to that in other advanced countries. Instead, as we discussed in 
the Chapter 2 Business Case on lean production at Toyota and Boeing, Japan’s 
comparative advantage in automobiles was based on the superior production 
techniques developed by its manufacturers, which allowed them to produce 
more cars with a given amount of labor and capital than their American or 
European counterparts.
Japan’s comparative advantage in automobiles was a case of compara-
tive advantage caused by differences in technology—the techniques used in 
production.
The causes of differences in technology are somewhat mysterious. Sometimes 
they seem to be based on knowledge accumulated through experience—for 
The factor intensity of production 
of a good is a measure of which 
factor is used in relatively greater 
quantities than other factors in 
production.
According to the Heckscher–
Ohlin model, a country has a 
comparative advantage in a good 
whose production is intensive in the 
factors that are abundantly available 
in that country.

220    P A R T  3    I N D I V I D UA L S  A N D  M A R K E T S
example, Switzerland’s comparative advantage in watches reflects a long tradi-
tion of watchmaking. Sometimes they are the result of a set of innovations that 
for some reason occur in one country but not in others. Technological advan-
tage, however, is often transitory. As we also discussed in the Chapter 2 Business 
Case, by adopting lean production, American auto manufacturers have now 
closed much of the gap in productivity with their Japanese competitors. In addi-
tion, Europe’s aircraft industry has closed a similar gap with the U.S. aircraft 
industry. At any given point in time, however, differences in technology are a 
major source of comparative advantage.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
SKILL AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
I
n 1953 U.S. workers were clearly better equipped with machinery than their 
counterparts in other countries. Most economists at the time thought that 
America’s comparative advantage lay in capital-intensive goods. But Wassily 
Leontief made a surprising discovery: America’s comparative advantage was 
in something other than capital-intensive goods. In fact, goods that the United 
States exported were slightly less capital-intensive than goods the country 
imported. This discovery came to be known as the Leontief paradox, and it led to 
a sustained effort to make sense of U.S. trade patterns.
The main resolution of this paradox, it turns out, depends on the definition of 
capital. U.S. exports aren’t intensive in physical capital—machines and buildings. 
Instead, they are skill-intensive—that is, they are intensive in human capital. U.S. 
exporting industries use a substantially higher ratio of highly educated workers 
to other workers than is found in U.S. industries that compete against imports. 
For example, one of America’s biggest export sectors is aircraft; the aircraft 
industry employs large numbers of engineers and other people with graduate 
degrees relative to the number of manual laborers. Conversely, we import a lot of 
clothing, which is often produced by workers with little formal education.
In general, countries with highly educated workforces tend to export skill-
intensive goods, while countries with less educated workforces tend to export 
goods whose production requires little skilled labor. Figure 8-4 illustrates this 
Most analysis of international trade 
focuses on how differences between 
countries—differences in climate, 
factor endowments, and technology—
create national comparative advantage. 
However, economists have also point-
ed out another reason for international 
trade: the role of increasing returns 
to scale.
Production of a good is character-
ized by increasing returns to scale 
if the productivity of labor and other 
resources used in production rise with 
the quantity of output. For example, in 
an industry characterized by increasing 
returns to scale, increasing output by 
10% might require only 8% more labor 
and 9% more raw materials. Examples 
of industries with increasing returns to 
scale include auto manufacturing, oil 
refining, and the production of jumbo 
jets, all of which require large outlays 
of capital. Increasing returns to scale 
(sometimes also called economies of 
scale) can give rise to monopoly, a 
situation in which an industry is com-
posed of only one producer, because it 
gives large firms a cost advantage over 
small ones.
But increasing returns to scale can 
also give rise to international trade. The 
logic runs as follows: If production of 
a good is characterized by increas-
ing returns to scale, it makes sense to 
concentrate production in only a few 
locations, so each location has a high 
level of output. But that also means pro-
duction occurs in only a few countries 
that export the good to other countries. 
A commonly cited example is the North 
American auto industry: although both 
the United States and Canada produce 
automobiles and their components, each 
particular model or component tends 
to be produced in only one of the two 
countries and exported to the other.
Increasing returns to scale probably 
play a large role in the trade in manufac-
tured goods between advanced coun-

States imports from Germany, a coun-
try with a highly educated labor force, 
with the goods the United States imports 
from Bangladesh, where about half of 
the adult population is still illiterate. In 
each country industries are ranked, first, 
according to how skill-intensive they are. 
Next, for each industry, we calculate its 
share of exports to the United States. 
This allows us to plot, for each country, 
various industries according to their skill 
intensity and their share of exports to the 
United States.
In Figure 8-4, the horizontal axis shows 
a measure of the skill intensity of dif-
ferent industries, and the vertical axes 
show the share of U.S. imports in each 
industry coming from Germany (on the left) and Bangladesh (on the right). As 
you can see, each country’s exports to the United States reflect its skill level. 
The curve representing Germany slopes upward: the more skill-intensive a 
German industry is, the higher its share of exports to the United States. In 
contrast, the curve representing Bangladesh slopes downward: the less skill-
intensive a Bangladeshi industry is, the higher its share of exports to the 
United States.

Supply, Demand, and International Trade
S
imple models of comparative advantage are helpful for understanding the 
fundamental causes of international trade. However, to analyze the effects 
of international trade at a more detailed level and to understand trade 
policy, it helps to return to the supply and demand model. We’ll start by looking 
at the effects of imports on domestic producers and consumers, then turn to the 
effects of exports.

 Quick Review
• Imports and exports account for a 
growing share of the U.S. economy 
and the economies of many other 
countries.
• The growth of international trade 
and other international linkages is 
known as globalization.
• International trade is driven by 
comparative advantage. The 
Ricardian model of international 
trade shows that trade between 
two countries makes both countries 
better off than they would be in 
autarky—that is, there are gains 
from international trade.
• The main sources of comparative 
advantage are international dif-
ferences in climate, factor endow-
ments, and technology.
• The Heckscher–Ohlin model shows 
how comparative advantage can 
arise from differences in factor 
endowments: goods differ in their 
factor intensity, and countries tend 
to export goods that are intensive in 
the factors they have in abundance.

The Effects of Imports
Figure 8-5 shows the U.S. market for auto seats, ignoring international trade for 
a moment. It introduces a few new concepts: the domestic demand curve, the 
domestic supply curve, and the domestic or autarky price.
The domestic demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demand-
ed by residents of a country depends on the price of that good. Why “domes-
tic”? Because people living in other countries may demand the good, too. Once 
we introduce international trade, we need to distinguish between purchases 
of a good by domestic consumers and purchases by foreign consumers. So 
the domestic demand curve reflects only the demand of residents of our own 
country. Similarly, the domestic supply curve shows how the quantity of 
a good supplied by producers inside our own country depends on the price 
of that good. Once we introduce international trade, we need to distinguish 
between the supply of domestic producers and foreign supply—supply brought 
in from abroad.
In autarky, with no international trade in auto seats, the equilibrium in this 
market would be determined by the intersection of the domestic demand and 
domestic supply curves, point A. The equilibrium price of auto seats would be 
PA, and the equilibrium quantity of auto seats produced and consumed would 
be QA. As always, both consumers and producers gain from the existence of 
the domestic market. In autarky, consumer surplus would be equal to the area 
of the blue-shaded triangle in Figure 8-5. Producer surplus would be equal to the 
area of the red-shaded triangle. And total surplus would be equal to the sum of 
these two shaded triangles.
Now let’s imagine opening up this market to imports. To do this, we must 
make an assumption about the supply of imports. The simplest assumption, 
which we will adopt here, is that unlimited quantities of auto seats can be pur-
chased from abroad at a fixed price, known as the world price of auto seats. 
Figure 8-6 shows a situation in which the world price of an auto seat, PW, is 
lower than the price of an auto seat that would prevail in the domestic market 
in autarky, PA.
Consumer and Producer Surplus in Autarky
8-5
In the absence of trade, the domestic price is PA, 
the autarky price at which the domestic supply 
curve and the domestic demand curve intersect. 
The quantity produced and consumed domestically 
is QA. Consumer surplus is represented by the blue-
shaded area, and producer surplus is represented 
by the red-shaded area.

The domestic demand curve 
shows how the quantity of a good

The domestic supply curve shows 
how the quantity of a good supplied 
by domestic producers depends on 
the price of that good.
The world price of a good is the 
price at which that good can be 
bought or sold abroad.

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    223
Given that the world price is below the domestic price of an auto seat, it 
is profitable for importers to buy auto seats abroad and resell them domes-
tically. The imported auto seats increase the supply of auto seats in the 
domestic market, driving down the domestic market price. Auto seats will 
continue to be imported until the domestic price falls to a level equal to the 
world price.
The result is shown in Figure 8-6. Because of imports, the domestic price 
of an auto seat falls from PA to PW. The quantity of auto seats demanded 
by domestic consumers rises from QA to QD, and the quantity supplied by 
domestic producers falls from QA to QS. The difference between the domes-
tic quantity demanded and the domestic quantity supplied, QD − QS, is filled 
by imports.
Now let’s turn to the effects of imports on consumer surplus and producer 
surplus. Because imports of auto seats lead to a fall in their domestic price, con-
sumer surplus rises and producer surplus falls. Figure 8-7 shows how this works. 
We label four areas: W, X, Y, and Z. The autarky consumer surplus we identified 
in Figure 8-5 corresponds to W, and the autarky producer surplus corresponds to 
the sum of X and Y. The fall in the domestic price to the world price leads to an 
increase in consumer surplus; it increases by X and Z, so consumer surplus now 
equals the sum of W, X, and Z. At the same time, producers lose X in surplus, so 
producer surplus now equals only Y.
The table in Figure 8-7 summarizes the changes in consumer and producer 
surplus when the auto seats market is opened to imports. Consumers gain sur-
plus equal to the areas X + Z. Producers lose surplus equal to X. So the sum of 
producer and consumer surplus—the total surplus generated in the auto seats 
market—increases by Z. As a result of trade, consumers gain and producers lose, 
but the gain to consumers exceeds the loss to producers.
This is an important result. We have just shown that opening up a market 
to imports leads to a net gain in total surplus, which is what we should have 
The Domestic Market with Imports
8-6
Here the world price of auto parts, PW, is below 
the autarky price, PA. When the economy is 
opened to international trade, imports enter the 
domestic market, and the domestic price falls 
from the autarky price, PA, to the world price, 
PW. As the price falls, the domestic quantity 
demanded rises from QA to QD and the domes-
tic quantity supplied falls from QA to QS. The 
difference between domestic quantity demand-
ed and domestic quantity supplied at PW, the 
quantity QD − QS, is filled by imports.

expected given the proposition that there are gains from international trade. 
However, we have also learned that although the country as a whole gains, 
some groups—in this case, domestic producers of auto parts—lose as a result 
of international trade. As we’ll see shortly, the fact that international trade 
typically creates losers as well as winners is crucial for understanding the 
politics of trade policy.
We turn next to the case in which a country exports a good.
The Effects of Exports
Figure 8-8 shows the effects on a country when it exports a good, in this case air-
planes. For this example, we assume that unlimited quantities of airplanes can be 
sold abroad at a given world price, PW, which is higher than the price that would 
prevail in the domestic market in autarky, PA.
The higher world price makes it profitable for exporters to buy airplanes 
domestically and sell them overseas. The purchases of domestic airplanes drive 
the domestic price up until it is equal to the world price. As a result, the quantity 
demanded by domestic consumers falls from QA to QD and the quantity supplied 
by domestic producers rises from QA to QS. This difference between domestic 
production and domestic consumption, QS – QD, is exported.
Like imports, exports lead to an overall gain in total surplus for the exporting 
country but also create losers as well as winners. Figure 8-9 shows the effects of 
airplane exports on producer and consumer surplus. In the absence of trade, the 
price of each airplane would be PA. Consumer surplus in the absence of trade is 
the sum of areas W and X, and producer surplus is area Y. As a result of trade, 
price rises from PA to PW, consumer surplus falls to W, and producer surplus rises 
to Y + X + Z. So producers gain X + Z, consumers lose X, and, as shown in the

When the domestic price falls to PW as a result of

(areas X + Z) and producers lose surplus (area X). 
Because the gains to consumers outweigh the losses 
to producers, there is an increase in the total surplus 
in the economy as a whole (area Z).

table accompanying the figure, the economy as a whole gains total surplus in the 
amount of Z.
We have learned, then, that imports of a particular good hurt domestic pro-
ducers of that good but help domestic consumers, whereas exports of a particular 
good hurt domestic consumers of that good but help domestic producers. In each 
case, the gains are larger than the losses.
The Domestic Market with Exports
8-8
Here the world price, PW, is greater than the 
autarky price, PA. When the economy is opened 
to international trade, some of the domestic 
supply is now exported. The domestic price 
rises from the autarky price, PA, to the world 
price, PW. As the price rises, the domestic 
quantity demanded falls from QA to QD and the 
domestic quantity supplied rises from QA to QS. 
The portion of domestic production that is not 
consumed domestically, QS − QD, is exported.

International Trade and Wages
So far we have focused on the effects of international trade on producers 
and consumers in a particular industry. For many purposes this is a very 
helpful approach. However, producers and consumers are not the only parts 
of society affected by trade—so are the owners of factors of production. In 
particular, the owners of labor, land, and capital employed in producing 
goods that are exported, or goods that compete with imported goods, can 
be deeply affected by trade. 
Moreover, the effects of trade aren’t limited to just those industries that export 
or compete with imports because factors of production can often move between 
industries. So now we turn our attention to the long-run effects of international 
trade on income distribution—how a country’s total income is allocated among 
its various factors of production.
To begin our analysis, consider the position of Maria, an accountant at 
Midwest Auto Parts, Inc. If the economy is opened up to imports of auto 
parts from Mexico, the domestic auto parts industry will contract, and it 
will hire fewer accountants. But accounting is a profession with employ-
ment opportunities in many industries, and Maria might well find a bet-
ter job in the aircraft industry, which expands as a result of international 
trade. So it may not be appropriate to think of her as a producer of auto 
parts who is hurt by competition from imported parts. Rather, we should 
think of her as an accountant who is affected by auto part imports only 
to the extent that these imports change the wages of accountants in the 
economy as a whole.
The wage rate of accountants is a factor price—the price employers have 
to pay for the services of a factor of production. One key question about 
international trade is how it affects factor prices—not just narrowly defined 
factors of production like accountants, but broadly defined factors such as 
capital, unskilled labor, and college-educated labor.
Earlier in this chapter we described the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, 
which states that comparative advantage is determined by a country’s fac-
tor endowment. This model also suggests how international trade affects factor 
prices in a country: compared to autarky, international trade tends to raise 
the prices of factors that are abundantly available and reduce the prices of 
factors that are scarce.
We won’t work this out in detail, but the idea is simple. The prices of fac-
tors of production, like the prices of goods and services, are determined by 
supply and demand. If international trade increases the demand for a factor 
of production, that factor’s price will rise; if international trade reduces the 
demand for a factor of production, that factor’s price will fall. 
Now think of a country’s industries as consisting of two kinds: export-
ing industries, which produce goods and services that are sold abroad, 
and import-competing industries, which produce goods and services that 
are also imported from abroad. Compared with autarky, international trade 
leads to higher production in exporting industries and lower production in 
import-competing industries. This indirectly increases the demand for the 
factors used by exporting industries and decreases the demand for factors 
used by import-competing industries.
In addition, the Heckscher–Ohlin model says that a country tends to export 
goods that are intensive in its abundant factors and to import goods that are 
intensive in its scarce factors. So international trade tends to increase the demand 
for factors that are abundant in our country compared with other countries, and to 
decrease the demand for factors that are scarce in our country compared with other 
countries. As a result, the prices of abundant factors tend to rise, and the prices of 
scarce factors tend to fall as international trade grows. In other words, international 
Exporting industries produce 
goods and services that are sold 
abroad.
Import-competing industries 
produce goods and services that are 
also imported.

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    227
trade tends to redistribute income toward a country’s abundant factors and away 
from its less abundant factors.
The Economics in Action at the end of the preceding section pointed out that 
U.S. exports tend to be human-capital-intensive and U.S. imports tend to be 
unskilled-labor-intensive. This suggests that the effect of international trade on 
U.S. factor markets is to raise the wage rate of highly educated American workers 
and reduce the wage rate of unskilled American workers.
This effect has been a source of much concern in recent years. Wage inequality—
the gap between the wages of high-paid and low-paid workers—has increased 
substantially over the last 30 years. Some economists believe that growing inter-
national trade is an important factor in that trend. If international trade has the 
effects predicted by the Heckscher–Ohlin model, its growth raises the wages of 
highly educated American workers, who already have relatively high wages, and 
lowers the wages of less educated American workers, who already have relatively 
low wages. But keep in mind another phenomenon: trade reduces the income 
inequality between countries as poor countries improve their standard of living 
by exporting to rich countries.
How important are these effects? In some historical episodes, the impacts 
of international trade on factor prices have been very large. As we explain in 
the following Economics in Action, the opening of transatlantic trade in the 
late nineteenth century had a large negative impact on land rents in Europe, 
hurting landowners but helping workers and owners of capital. 
The effects of trade on wages in the United States have generated considerable 
controversy in recent years. Most economists who have studied the issue agree 
that growing imports of labor-intensive products from newly industrializing 
economies, and the export of high-technology goods in return, have helped cause 
a widening wage gap between highly educated and less educated workers in this 
country. However, most economists believe that it is only one of several forces 
explaining the growth in American wage inequality.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
TRADE, WAGES, AND LAND PRICES 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
B
eginning around 1870, there was an explo-
sive growth of world trade in agricultural 
products, based largely on the steam engine. 
Steam-powered ships could cross the ocean 
much more quickly and reliably than sailing 
ships. Until about 1860, steamships had higher 
costs than sailing ships, but after that costs 
dropped sharply. At the same time, steam-
powered rail transport made it possible to 
bring grain and other bulk goods cheaply from 
the interior to ports. The result was that land-
abundant countries—the United States, Canada, 
Argentina, and Australia—began shipping large 
quantities of agricultural goods to the densely 
populated, land-scarce countries of Europe.
This opening up of international trade led 
to higher prices of agricultural products, such 
as wheat, in exporting countries and a decline 
in their prices in importing countries. Notably, 
International trade redistributes income toward a country’s abundant factors
y
and away from its less abundant factors.

the difference between wheat prices in the midwestern United States and 
England plunged.
The change in agricultural prices created winners and losers on both 
sides of the Atlantic as factor prices adjusted. In England, land prices fell 
by half compared with average wages; landowners found their purchasing 
power sharply reduced, but workers benefited from cheaper food. In the 
United States, the reverse happened: land prices doubled compared with 
wages. Landowners did very well, but workers found the purchasing power 
of their wages dented by rising food prices.

The Effects of Trade Protection
E
ver since David Ricardo laid out the principle of comparative advantage in 
the early nineteenth century, most economists have advocated free trade. 
That is, they have argued that government policy should not attempt either 
to reduce or to increase the levels of exports and imports that occur naturally as 
a result of supply and demand. Despite the free-trade arguments of economists, 
however, many governments use taxes and other restrictions to limit imports. 
Less frequently, governments offer subsidies to encourage exports. Policies that 
limit imports, usually with the goal of protecting domestic producers in import-
competing industries from foreign competition, are known as trade protection 
or simply as protection.
Let’s look at the two most common protectionist policies, tariffs and import 
quotas, then turn to the reasons governments follow these policies.
The Effects of a Tariff
A tariff is a form of excise tax, one that is levied only on sales of imported goods. 
For example, the U.S. government could declare that anyone bringing in auto 
seats must pay a tariff of $100 per unit. In the distant past, tariffs were an impor-
tant source of government revenue because they were relatively easy to collect. 
But in the modern world, tariffs are usually intended to discourage imports and 
protect import-competing domestic producers rather than as a source of govern-
ment revenue.
The tariff raises both the price received by domestic producers and the price 
paid by domestic consumers. Suppose, for example, that our country imports 
auto seats, and an auto seat costs $200 on the world market. As we saw earlier, 
under free trade the domestic price would also be $200. But if a tariff of $100 per 
• The intersection of the domestic 
demand curve and the domes-
tic supply curve determines the 
domestic price of a good. When a 
market is opened to international 
trade, the domestic price is driven 
to equal the world price.
• If the world price is lower than the 
autarky price, trade leads to imports 
and the domestic price falls to the 
world price. There are overall gains 
from international trade because the 
gain in consumer surplus exceeds 
the loss in producer surplus.
• If the world price is higher than the 
autarky price, trade leads to exports 
and the domestic price rises to the 
world price. There are overall gains 
from international trade because the 
gain in producer surplus exceeds 
the loss in consumer surplus.
• Trade leads to an expansion of export-
ing industries, which increases 
demand for a country’s abundant fac-
tors, and a contraction of import-
competing industries, which decreases 
demand for its scarce factors.
 Quick Review
An economy has free trade when 
the government does not attempt 
either to reduce or to increase the 
levels of exports and imports that 
occur naturally as a result of supply 
and demand.
Policies that limit imports are known 
as trade protection or simply as 
protection.
A tariff is a tax levied on imports.

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    229
unit is imposed, the domestic price will rise to $300, because it won’t be profit-
able to import auto seats unless the price in the domestic market is high enough 
to compensate importers for the cost of paying the tariff.
Figure 8-10 illustrates the effects of a tariff on imports of auto seats. As before, 
we assume that PW is the world price of an auto seat. Before the tariff is imposed, 
imports have driven the domestic price down to PW, so that pre-tariff domestic 
production is QS, pre-tariff domestic consumption is QD, and pre-tariff imports 
are QD − QS.
Now suppose that the government imposes a tariff on each auto seat import-
ed. As a consequence, it is no longer profitable to import auto seats unless the 
domestic price received by the importer is greater than or equal to the world 
price plus the tariff. So the domestic price rises to PT, which is equal to the 
world price, PW, plus the tariff. Domestic production rises to QST, domestic con-
sumption falls to QDT, and imports fall to QDT − QST.
A tariff, then, raises domestic prices, leading to increased domestic produc-
tion and reduced domestic consumption compared to the situation under free 
trade. Figure 8-11 shows the effects on surplus. There are three effects:
 1. The higher domestic price increases producer surplus, a gain equal to area A.
 2. The higher domestic price reduces consumer surplus, a reduction equal to 
the sum of areas A, B, C, and D.
 3. The tariff yields revenue to the government. How much revenue? The gov-
ernment collects the tariff—which, remember, is equal to the difference 
between PT and PW on each of the QDT − QST units imported. So total revenue 
is (PT − PW) × (QDT − QST). This is equal to area C.
The welfare effects of a tariff are summarized in the table in Figure 8-11. 
Producers gain, consumers lose, and the government gains. But consumer losses 
are greater than the sum of producer and government gains, leading to a net 
reduction in total surplus equal to areas B + D.
The Effect of a Tariff
8-10
A tariff raises the domestic price of the 
good from PW to PT. The domestic quantity 
demanded shrinks from QD to QDT, and the 
domestic quantity supplied increases from 
QS to QST. As a result, imports—which had 
been QD − QS before the tariff was imposed—
shrink to QDT − QST after the tariff is imposed.

An excise tax creates inefficiency, or deadweight loss, because it prevents 
mutually beneficial trades from occurring. The same is true of a tariff, where 
the deadweight loss imposed on society is equal to the loss in total surplus repre-
sented by areas B + D.
Tariffs generate deadweight losses because they create inefficiencies in 
two ways:
 1. Some mutually beneficial trades go unexploited: some consumers who are 
willing to pay more than the world price, PW, do not purchase the good, even 
though PW is the true cost of a unit of the good to the economy. The cost of 
this inefficiency is represented in Figure 8-11 by area D.
 2. The economy’s resources are wasted on inefficient production: some produc-
ers whose cost exceeds PW produce the good, even though an additional unit 
of the good can be purchased abroad for PW. The cost of this inefficiency is 
represented in Figure 8-11 by area B.
The Effects of an Import Quota
An import quota, another form of trade protection, is a legal limit on the 
quantity of a good that can be imported. For example, a U.S. import quota on 
Mexican auto seats might limit the quantity imported each year to 500,000 units. 
Import quotas are usually administered through licenses: a number of licenses 
are issued, each giving the license-holder the right to import a limited quantity 
of the good each year.

When the domestic price rises as a result of a tariff, pro-
ducers gain additional surplus (area A), the government 
gains revenue (area C), and consumers lose surplus 
(areas A + B + C + D). Because the losses to consumers 
outweigh the gains to producers and the government, 
the economy as a whole loses surplus (areas B + D).
An import quota is a legal limit on 
the quantity of a good that can be 
imported.

A quota on sales has the same effect as an excise tax, with one difference: 
the money that would otherwise have accrued to the government as tax rev-
enue under an excise tax becomes license-holders’ revenue under a quota—also 
known as quota rents. (“Quota rent” was defined in Chapter 5.) Similarly, an 
import quota has the same effect as a tariff, with one difference: the money 
that would otherwise have been government revenue becomes quota rents to 
license-holders. Look again at Figure 8-11. An import quota that limits imports 
to QDT − QST will raise the domestic price of auto parts by the same amount as 
the tariff we considered previously. That is, it will raise the domestic price from 
PW to PT. However, area C will now represent quota rents rather than govern-
ment revenue.
Who receives import licenses and so collects the quota rents? In the case 
of U.S. import protection, the answer may surprise you: the most important 
import licenses—mainly for clothing, to a lesser extent for sugar—are granted 
to foreign governments.
Because the quota rents for most U.S. import quotas go to foreigners, the cost 
to the nation of such quotas is larger than that of a comparable tariff (a tariff 
that leads to the same level of imports). In Figure 8-11 the net loss to the United 
States from such an import quota would be equal to areas B + C + D, the differ-
ence between consumer losses and producer gains.

TRADE PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES
T
he United States today generally follows a policy of free trade, both in com-
parison with other countries and in comparison with its own history. Most 
imports are subject to either no tariff or to a low tariff. So what are the major 
exceptions to this rule?
Most of the remaining protection involves agricultural products. Topping 
the list is ethanol, which in the United States is mainly produced from corn 
and used as an ingredient in motor fuel. Most imported ethanol is subject to 
a fairly high tariff, but some countries are allowed to sell a limited amount of 
ethanol in the United States, at high prices, without paying the tariff. Dairy 
products also receive substantial import pro-
tection, again through a combination of tar-
iffs and quotas.
Until a few years ago, clothing and textiles 
were also strongly protected from import 
competition, thanks to an elaborate system 
of import quotas. However, this system was 
phased out in 2005 as part of a trade agree-
ment reached a decade earlier. Some clothing 
imports are still subject to relatively high tar-
iffs, but protection in the clothing industry is a 
shadow of what it used to be.
The most important thing to know about 
current U.S. trade protection is how limited 
it really is, and how little cost it imposes 
on the economy. Every two years the U.S. 
International Trade Commission, a govern-
ment agency, produces estimates of the 
impact of “significant trade restrictions” on 
U.S. welfare. As Figure 8-12 shows, over the

The Political Economy 
of Trade Protection
W
e have seen that international trade produces mutual benefits to the 
countries that engage in it. We have also seen that tariffs and import 
quotas, although they produce winners as well as losers, reduce total 
surplus. Yet many countries continue to impose tariffs and import quotas as well 
as to enact other protectionist measures.
To understand why trade protection takes place, we will first look at some 
common justifications for protection. Then we will look at the politics of trade 
protection. Finally, we will look at an important feature of trade protection in 
today’s world: tariffs and import quotas are the subject of international negotia-
tion and are policed by international organizations.
Arguments for Trade Protection
Advocates for tariffs and import quotas offer a variety of arguments. Three 
common arguments are national security, job creation, and the infant indus-
try argument.
The national security argument is based on the proposition that overseas 
sources of goods are vulnerable to disruption in times of international conflict; 
therefore, a country should protect domestic suppliers of crucial goods with the 
aim to be self-sufficient in those goods. In the 1960s, the United States—which 
had begun to import oil as domestic oil reserves ran low—had an import quota 
on oil, justified on national security grounds. Some people have argued that 
we should again have policies to discourage imports of oil, especially from the 
Middle East.
The job creation argument points to the additional jobs created in import-
competing industries as a result of trade protection. Economists argue that these 
jobs are offset by the jobs lost elsewhere, such as industries that use imported 
inputs and now face higher input costs. But noneconomists don’t always find this 
argument persuasive.
• Most economists advocate free 
trade, although many governments 
engage in trade protection of 
import-competing industries. The 
two most common protectionist 
policies are tariffs and import quo-
tas. In rare instances, governments 
subsidize exporting industries.
• A tariff is a tax on imports. It raises 
the domestic price above the world 
price, leading to a fall in trade and 
domestic consumption and a rise 
in domestic production. Domestic 
producers and the government 
gain, but domestic consumer losses 
more than offset this gain, leading 
to deadweight loss.
• An import quota is a legal quantity 
limit on imports. Its effect is like that 
of a tariff, except that revenues—the 
quota rents—accrue to the license-
holder, not to the domestic government.

Finally, the infant industry argument, often raised in newly industrializing 
countries, holds that new industries require a temporary period of trade pro-
tection to get established. For example, in the 1950s many countries in Latin 
America imposed tariffs and import quotas on manufactured goods, in an effort 
to switch from their traditional role as exporters of raw materials to a new status 
as industrial countries.
In theory, the argument for infant industry protection can be compelling, 
particularly in high-tech industries that increase a country’s overall skill level. 
Reality, however, is more complicated: it is most often industries that are politi-
cally influential that gain protection. In addition, governments tend to be poor 
predictors of the best emerging technologies. Finally, it is often very difficult to 
wean an industry from protection when it should be mature enough to stand on 
its own.
The Politics of Trade Protection
In reality, much trade protection has little to do with the arguments just described. 
Instead, it reflects the political influence of import-competing producers.
We’ve seen that a tariff or import quota leads to gains for import-competing 
producers and losses for consumers. Producers, however, usually have much 
more influence over trade policy decisions. The producers who compete with 
imports of a particular good are usually a smaller, more cohesive group than the 
consumers of that good.
An example is trade protection for sugar: the United States has an import 
quota on sugar, which on average leads to a domestic price about twice the 
world price. This quota is difficult to rationalize in terms of any economic 
argument. However, consumers rarely complain about the quota because they 
are unaware that it exists: because no individual consumer buys large amounts 
of sugar, the cost of the quota is only a few dollars per family each year, not 
enough to attract notice. But there are only a few thousand sugar growers in the 
United States. They are very aware of the benefits they receive from the quota 
and make sure that their representatives in Congress are also aware of their 
interest in the matter.
Given these political realities, it may seem surprising that trade is as free as 
it is. For example, the United States has low tariffs, and its import quotas are 
mainly confined to clothing and a few agricultural products. It would be nice to 
say that the main reason trade protection is so limited is that economists have 
convinced governments of the virtues of free trade. A more important reason, 
however, is the role of international trade agreements.
International Trade Agreements and 
the World Trade Organization
When a country engages in trade protection, it hurts two groups. We’ve already 
emphasized the adverse effect on domestic consumers, but protection also hurts 
foreign export industries. This means that countries care about one anothers’ 
trade policies: the Canadian lumber industry, for example, has a strong interest 
in keeping U.S. tariffs on forest products low.
Because countries care about one anothers’ trade policies, they enter into 
international trade agreements: treaties in which a country promises to 
engage in less trade protection against the exports of another country in return 
for a promise by the other country to do the same for its own exports. Most world 
trade is now governed by such agreements.
Some international trade agreements involve just two countries or a small 
group of countries. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are joined together 
International trade agreements 
are treaties in which a country 
promises to engage in less trade 
protection against the exports 
of other countries in return for a 
promise by other countries to do the 
same for its own exports.

by the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. This agree-
ment, signed in 1993, will eventually remove all barriers to trade among the 
three nations. In Europe, 27 nations are part of an even more comprehensive 
agreement, the European Union, or EU. In NAFTA, the member countries 
set their own tariff rates against imports from other nonmember countries. 
The EU, however, is a customs union: tariffs are levied at the same rate on 
goods from outside the EU entering the union.
There are also global trade agreements covering most of the world. Such 
global agreements are overseen by the World Trade Organization, or WTO, 
an international organization composed of member countries, which plays 
two roles. First, it provides the framework for the massively complex negotia-
tions involved in a major international trade agreement (the full text of the 
last major agreement, approved in 1994, was 24,000 pages long). Second, the 
WTO resolves disputes between its members. These disputes typically arise 
when one country claims that another country’s policies violate its previous 
agreements. Currently, the WTO has 151 member countries, accounting for 
the bulk of world trade.
Here are two examples that illustrate the WTO’s role. First, in 1999 the 
WTO ruled that the European Union’s import restrictions on bananas, which 
discriminate in favor of banana producers in former European colonies and 
against Central American banana producers, are in violation of international 
trade rules. The United States took the side of the Central American countries, 
and the dispute threatened to become a major source of conflict between the 
European Union and the United States. Europe is currently in the process of 
revising its system. In 2009, the European Union agreed to reduce tariffs on 
Central American banana producers by 35% over seven years; in exchange, the 
United States and Central American countries dropped their case, ending the 
“banana wars.”
A more recent example is the dispute between the United States and Brazil 
over American subsidies to its cotton farmers. These subsidies, in the amount 
of $3 billion to $4 billion a year, are illegal under WTO rules. Brazil argues 
that they artificially reduce the price of American cotton on world markets and 
hurt Brazilian cotton farmers. In 2005 the WTO ruled against the United States 
and in favor of Brazil, and the United States responded by cutting some export 
subsidies on cotton. However, in 2007 the WTO ruled that the United States 
had not done enough to fully comply, such as eliminating government loans to 
cotton farmers. After Brazil threatened, in turn, to impose import tariffs on 
U.S.-manufactured goods, in 2010 the two sides agreed to a framework for the 
solution to the cotton dispute.
By the way, Vietnam and Thailand are both members of the WTO. Yet 
the United States has, on and off, imposed tariffs on shrimp imports from 
these countries. The reason this is possible is that WTO rules do allow 
trade protection under certain circumstances. One circumstance is where 
the foreign competition is “unfair” under certain technical criteria. Trade 
protection is also allowed as a temporary measure when a sudden surge of 
imports threatens to disrupt a domestic industry. The response to Chinese 
tire exports, described in the accompanying For Inquiring Minds, is an 
important recent example.
The WTO is sometimes, with great exaggeration, described as a world 
government. In fact, it has no army, no police, and no direct enforcement 
power. The grain of truth in that description is that when a country joins 
the WTO, it agrees to accept the organization’s judgments—and these judg-
ments apply not only to tariffs and import quotas but also to domestic 
policies that the organization considers trade protection disguised under 
another name. So in joining the WTO a country does give up some of 
its sovereignty.
The North American Free Trade 
Agreement, or NAFTA, is a trade 
agreement between the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico.
The European Union, or EU, is a 
customs union among 27 European 
nations.
The World Trade Organization, or 
WTO, oversees international trade 
agreements and rules on disputes 
between countries over those 
agreements.

New Challenges to Globalization
The forward march of globalization over the past century is generally con-
sidered a major political and economic success. Economists and policy mak-
ers alike have viewed growing world trade, in particular, as a good thing. 
We would be remiss, however, if we failed to acknowledge that many people 
are having second thoughts about globalization. To a large extent, these 
second thoughts reflect two concerns shared by many economists: worries 
about the effects of globalization on inequality and worries that new devel-
opments, in particular the growth in offshore outsourcing, are increasing 
economic insecurity.
Globalization and Inequality We’ve already mentioned the implications of 
international trade for factor prices, such as wages: when wealthy countries 
like the United States export skill-intensive products like aircraft while import-
ing labor-intensive products like clothing, they can expect to see the wage gap 
between more educated and less educated domestic workers widen. Thirty years 
ago, this wasn’t a significant concern, because most of the goods wealthy coun-
tries imported from poorer countries were raw materials or goods where com-
parative advantage depended on climate. Today, however, many manufactured 
goods are imported from relatively poor countries, with a potentially much larger 
effect on the distribution of income.
Trade with China, in particular, raises concerns among labor groups try-
ing to maintain wage levels in rich countries. Although China has experienced 
spectacular economic growth since the economic reforms that began in the late 
1970s, it remains a poor, low-wage country: wages in Chinese manufacturing are 
estimated to be only about 4% of U.S. wages. Meanwhile, imports from China 
have soared. In 1983 less than 1% of U.S. imports came from China; by 2010, the 
figure was more than 19%. There’s not much question that these surging imports 
from China put at least some downward pressure on the wages of less educated 
American workers.
Outsourcing Chinese exports to the United States overwhelmingly consist 
of labor-intensive manufactured goods. However, some U.S. workers have 
recently found themselves facing a new form of international competition. 
Outsourcing, in which a company hires another company to perform some 
In September 2009 the U.S. government 
imposed steep tariffs on imports of tires 
from China. The tariffs were imposed for 
three years: 35% in the first year, 30% 
in the second, and 25% in the third.
The tariffs were a response to union 
complaints about the effects of surging 
Chinese tire exports: between 2004 and 
2008, U.S. imports of automobile tires from 
China had gone from 15 million to 46 mil-
lion, and labor groups warned that this was 
costing American jobs. The unions wanted 
an import quota, but getting the tariff was 
still a political victory for organized labor.
But wasn’t the tariff a violation of 
WTO rules? No, said the Obama 
administration. When China joined 
the WTO in 2001, it agreed to what 
is known, in trade policy jargon, as 
a “safeguard mechanism”: importing 
countries were granted the right to 
impose temporary limits on Chinese 
exports in the event of an import surge. 
Despite this agreement, the government 
of China protested the U.S. action and 
appealed to the WTO to rule the tariff 
illegal. But in December 2010 the WTO 
came down on America’s side, ruling 
that the Obama administration had been 
within its rights.
You shouldn’t be too cynical about 
this failure to achieve complete free 
trade in tires. World trade negotiations 
have always been based on the principle 
that half a loaf is better than none, that 
it’s better to have an agreement that 
allows politically sensitive industries to 
retain some protection than to insist on 
free-trade purity. In spite of such actions 
as the tire tariff, world trade is, on the 
whole, remarkably free, and freer in many 
ways than it was just a few years ago.

task, such as running the corporate computer system, is a long-standing busi-
ness practice. Until recently, however, outsourcing was normally done locally, 
with a company hiring another company in the same city or country.
Now, modern telecommunications increasingly makes it possible to engage in off-
shore outsourcing, in which businesses hire people in another country to perform 
various tasks. The classic example is call centers: the person answering the phone 
when you call a company’s 1-800 help line may well be in India, which has taken 
the lead in attracting offshore outsourcing. Offshore outsourcing has also spread to 
fields such as software design and even health care: the radiologist examining your 
X-rays, like the person giving you computer help, may be on another continent.
Although offshore outsourcing has come as a shock to some U.S. workers, 
such as programmers whose jobs have been outsourced to India, it’s still relatively 
small compared with more traditional trade. Some economists have warned, 
however, that millions or even tens of millions of workers who have never thought 
they could face foreign competition for their jobs may face unpleasant surprises 
in the not-too-distant future.
Concerns about income distribution and outsourcing, as we’ve said, are shared 
by many economists. There is also, however, widespread opposition to globalization 
in general, particularly among college students. In 1999, an attempt to start a major 
round of trade negotiations failed in part because the WTO meeting, in Seattle, was 
disrupted by antiglobalization demonstrators. However, the more important reason 
for its failure was disagreement among the countries represented. 
Another round of negotiations that began in 2001 in Doha, Qatar, 
and is therefore referred to as the “Doha development round,” by 
2008 had stalled, mainly because of disagreements over agricul-
tural trade rules.
What motivates the antiglobalization movement? To some 
extent it’s the sweatshop labor fallacy: it’s easy to get outraged 
about the low wages paid to the person who made your shirt, 
and harder to appreciate how much worse off that person 
would be if denied the opportunity to sell goods in rich coun-
tries’ markets. It’s also true, however, that the movement repre-
sents a backlash against supporters of globalization who have 
oversold its benefits. Countries in Latin America, in particular, 
were promised that reducing their tariff rates would produce 
an economic takeoff; instead, they have experienced disap-
pointing results. Some groups, such as poor farmers facing new 
competition from imported food, ended up worse off.
Do these new challenges to globalization undermine the 
argument that international trade is a good thing? The great 
majority of economists would argue that the gains from reducing 
trade protection still exceed the losses. However, it has become 
more important than before to make sure that the gains from 
international trade are widely spread. And the politics of international trade is 
becoming increasingly difficult as the extent of trade has grown.

BEEFING UP EXPORTS
I 
n December 2010, negotiators from the United States and South Korea reached 
final agreement on a free-trade deal that would phase out many of the tariffs and 
other restrictions on trade between the two nations. The deal also involved changes 
in a variety of business regulations that were expected to make it easier for U.S. 
companies to operate in South Korea. This was, literally, a fairly big deal: South 
Korea’s economy is comparable in size to Mexico’s, so this was the most important 
free-trade agreement that the United States had been party to since NAFTA.
To some extent, the antiglobalization movement is motivated 
by the sweatshop labor fallacy.

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    237
What made this deal possible? Estimates by the U.S. 
International Trade Commission found that the deal would raise 
average American incomes, although modestly: the commission 
put the gains at around one-tenth of one percent. Not bad when 
you consider the fact that South Korea, despite its relatively 
large economy, is still only America’s seventh-most-important 
trading partner.
These overall gains played little role in the politics of the deal, 
however, which hinged on losses and gains for particular U.S. 
constituencies. Some opposition to the deal came from labor, espe-
cially from autoworkers, who feared that eliminating the 8% U.S. 
tariff on imports of Korean automobiles would lead to job losses. 
But there were also interest groups in America that badly wanted 
the deal, most notably the beef industry: Koreans are big beef-
eaters, yet American access to that market was limited by a 38% 
Korean tariff.
And the Obama administration definitely wanted a deal, 
in part for reasons unrelated to economics: South Korea is an 
important U.S. ally, and military tensions with North Korea were 
ratcheting up even as the final negotiations were taking place. So 
a trade deal was viewed in part as a symbol of U.S.–South Korean 
cooperation. Even labor unions weren’t as opposed as they might 
have been; the administration’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese tires, just 
described in For Inquiring Minds, was seen as a demonstration that it was 
prepared to defend labor interests.
It also helped that South Korea—unlike Mexico when NAFTA was signed—is 
both a fairly high-wage country and not right on the U.S. border, which meant 
less concern about massive shifts of manufacturing. In the end, the balance of 
interests was just favorable enough to make the deal politically possible. That 
said, at the time of writing, the U.S. Congress had yet to approve the deal.

 Quick Review
• The three major justifications for 
trade protection are national secu-
rity, job creation, and protection of 
infant industries.
• Despite the deadweight losses, 
import protections are often 
imposed because groups represent-
ing import-competing industries 
are more influential than groups 
of consumers.
• To further trade liberalization, coun-
tries engage in international trade 
agreements. Some agreements 
are among a small number of coun-
tries, such as the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
and the European Union (EU). The 
World Trade Organization (WTO) 
seeks to negotiate global trade 
agreements and referee trade dis-
putes between members.
• Resistance to globalization has 
emerged in response to a surge in 
imports from relatively poor coun-
tries and the offshore outsourcing 
of many jobs that had been consid-
ered safe from foreign competition.

It’s a very good bet that as you read this, you’re wearing something manufactured 
in Asia. And if you are, it’s also a good bet that the Hong Kong company Li & Fung 
was involved in getting your garment designed, produced, and shipped to your 
local store. From Levi’s to The Limited to Walmart, Li & Fung is a critical conduit 
from factories around the world to the shopping mall nearest you.
The company was founded in 1906 in Guangzhou, China. According to Victor 
Fung, the company’s chairman, his grandfather’s “value added” was that he 
spoke English, allowing him to serve as an interpreter in business deals between 
Chinese and foreigners. When Mao’s Communist Party seized control in main-
land China, the company moved to Hong Kong. There, as Hong Kong’s market 
economy took off during the 1960s and 1970s, Li & Fung grew as an export bro-
ker, bringing together Hong Kong manufacturers and foreign buyers.
The real transformation of the company came, however, as Asian economies 
grew and changed. Hong Kong’s rapid growth led to rising wages, making Li & 
Fung increasingly uncompetitive in garments, its main business. So the company 
reinvented itself: rather than being a simple broker, it became a “supply chain 
manager.” Not only would it allocate production of a good to a manufacturer, it 
would also break production down, allocate production of the inputs, and then 
allocate final assembly of the good among its 12,000+ suppliers around the globe. 
Sometimes production would be done in sophisticated economies like those of 
Hong Kong or even Japan, where wages are high but so is quality and productiv-
ity; sometimes it would be done in less advanced locations like mainland China 
or Thailand, where labor is less productive but cheaper.
For example, suppose you own a U.S. retail chain and want to sell garment-
washed blue jeans. Rather than simply arrange for production of the jeans, Li & 
Fung will work with you on their design, providing you with the latest production 
and style information, like what materials and colors are hot. After the design 
has been finalized, Li & Fung will arrange for the creation of a prototype, find 
the most cost-effective way to manufacture it, and then place an order on your 
behalf. Through Li & Fung, the yarn might be made in Korea and dyed in Taiwan, 
and the jeans sewn in Thailand or mainland China. And because production is 
taking place in so many locations, Li & Fung provides transport logistics as well 
as quality control.
Li & Fung has been enormously successful. In 2010 the company had a market 
value of approximately $23.3 billion and business turnover of over $15 billion, 
with offices and distribution centers in more than 40 countries. Year after year, 
it has regularly doubled or tripled its profits.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Why do you think it was profitable for Li & Fung to go beyond brokering exports to becom-
ing a supply chain manager, breaking down the production process and sourcing the 
inputs from various suppliers across many countries?
 2. What principle do you think underlies Li & Fung’s decisions on how to allocate production 
of a good’s inputs and its final assembly among various countries?
 3. Why do you think a retailer prefers to have Li & Fung arrange international production of 
its jeans rather than purchase them directly from a jeans manufacturer in mainland China?
 4. What is the source of Li & Fung’s success? Is it based on human capital, on ownership of 
a natural resource, or on ownership of capital?

SUMMARY
 1. International trade is of growing importance to the 
United States and of even greater importance to most 
other countries. International trade, like trade among 
individuals, arises from comparative advantage: the 
opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of a 
good is lower in some countries than in others. Goods 
and services purchased abroad are imports; those 
sold abroad are exports. Foreign trade, like other eco-
nomic linkages between countries, has been growing 
rapidly, a phenomenon called globalization.
 2. The Ricardian model of international trade 
assumes that opportunity costs are constant. It shows 
that there are gains from trade: two countries are bet-
ter off with trade than in autarky.
 3. In practice, comparative advantage reflects differences 
between countries in climate, factor endowments, and 
technology. The Heckscher–Ohlin model shows how 
differences in factor endowments determine compara-
tive advantage: goods differ in factor intensity, and 
countries tend to export goods that are intensive in the 
factors they have in abundance.
 4. The domestic demand curve and the domes-
tic supply curve determine the price of a good in 
autarky. When international trade occurs, the domestic 
price is driven to equality with the world price, the 
price at which the good is bought and sold abroad.
 5. If the world price is below the autarky price, a good 
is imported. This leads to an increase in consumer 
surplus, a fall in producer surplus, and a gain in total 
surplus. If the world price is above the autarky price, a 
good is exported. This leads to an increase in producer 
surplus, a fall in consumer surplus, and a gain in total 
surplus.
 6. International trade leads to expansion in exporting 
industries and contraction in import-competing 
industries. This raises the domestic demand for 
abundant factors of production, reduces the demand 
for scarce factors, and so affects factor prices, such as 
wages.
 7. Most economists advocate free trade, but in practice 
many governments engage in trade protection. The 
two most common forms of protection are tariffs 
and quotas. In rare occasions, export industries are 
subsidized.
 8. A tariff is a tax levied on imports. It raises the domes-
tic price above the world price, hurting consumers, 
benefiting domestic producers, and generating gov-
ernment revenue. As a result, total surplus falls. An 
import quota is a legal limit on the quantity of a 
good that can be imported. It has the same effects as 
a tariff, except that the revenue goes not to the govern-
ment but to those who receive import licenses.
 9. Although several popular arguments have been made 
in favor of trade protection, in practice the main 
reason for protection is probably political: import-
competing industries are well organized and well 
informed about how they gain from trade protection, 
while consumers are unaware of the costs they pay. 
Still, U.S. trade is fairly free, mainly because of the 
role of international trade agreements, in which 
countries agree to reduce trade protection against one 
anothers’ exports. The North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union 
(EU) cover a small number of countries. In contrast, 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) covers a 
much larger number of countries, accounting for the 
bulk of world trade. It oversees trade negotiations and 
adjudicates disputes among its members.
 10. In the past few years, many concerns have been 
raised about the effects of globalization. One issue is 
the increase in income inequality due to the surge in 
imports from relatively poor countries over the past 
20 years. Another concern is the increase in offshore 
outsourcing, as many jobs that were once consid-
ered safe from foreign competition have been moved 
abroad.

 a. What is the opportunity cost of producing a car 
in Saudi Arabia? In the United States? What is the 
opportunity cost of producing a barrel of oil in 
Saudi Arabia? In the United States?
 b. Which country has the comparative advantage in 
producing oil? In producing cars?
 c. Suppose that in autarky, Saudi Arabia produces 200 
million barrels of oil and 3 million cars; similarly, that 
the United States produces 300 million barrels of oil 
and 2.5 million cars. Without trade, can Saudi Arabia 
produce more oil and more cars? Without trade, can 
the United States produce more oil and more cars?
 2. The production possibilities for the United States and 
Saudi Arabia are given in Problem 1. Suppose now that 
each country specializes in the good in which it has the 
comparative advantage, and the two countries trade. 
Also assume that for each country the value of imports 
must equal the value of exports.
 a. What is the total quantity of oil produced? What is 
the total quantity of cars produced?
 b. Is it possible for Saudi Arabia to consume 400 mil-
lion barrels of oil and 5 million cars and for the 
United States to consume 400 million barrels of oil 
and 5 million cars?
 c. Suppose that, in fact, Saudi Arabia consumes 300 
million barrels of oil and 4 million cars and the 
United States consumes 500 million barrels of oil 
and 6 million cars. How many barrels of oil does 
the United States import? How many cars does the 
United States export? Suppose a car costs $10,000 
on the world market. How much, then, does a barrel 
of oil cost on the world market?
 3. Both Canada and the United States produce lumber and 
music CDs with constant opportunity costs. The United 
States can produce either 10 tons of lumber and no CDs, or 
1,000 CDs and no lumber, or any combination in between. 
Canada can produce either 8 tons of lumber and no CDs, 
or 400 CDs and no lumber, or any combination in between.
 a. Draw the U.S. and Canadian production possibility 
frontiers in two separate diagrams, with CDs on the 
horizontal axis and lumber on the vertical axis.
 b. In autarky, if the United States wants to consume 
500 CDs, how much lumber can it consume at most? 
Label this point A in your diagram. Similarly, if 
Canada wants to consume 1 ton of lumber, how 
many CDs can it consume in autarky? Label this 
point C in your diagram.
 c. Which country has the absolute advantage in lumber 
production?
 d. Which country has the comparative advantage in 
lumber production?
Suppose each country specializes in the good in which 
it has the comparative advantage, and there is trade.
 e. How many CDs does the United States produce? 
How much lumber does Canada produce?
 f. Is it possible for the United States to consume 500 
CDs and 7 tons of lumber? Label this point B in your 
diagram. Is it possible for Canada at the same time 
to consume 500 CDs and 1 ton of lumber? Label this 
point D in your diagram.
 4. For each of the following trade relationships, explain 
the likely source of the comparative advantage of each 
of the exporting countries.
 a. The United States exports software to Venezuela, 
and Venezuela exports oil to the United States.
 b. The United States exports airplanes to China, and 
China exports clothing to the United States.
 c. The United States exports wheat to Colombia, and 
Colombia exports coffee to the United States.
 5. The U.S. Census Bureau keeps statistics on U.S. imports 
and exports on its website. The following steps will take 
you to the foreign trade statistics. Use them to answer 
the questions below.
 
i.  Go to the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at www.
census.gov
 
ii.  Under the heading “Business & Industry,” select 
“Foreign Trade”
 
iii. At the top of the page, select “Data”
 
iv. Then select “Country/Product Trade”
 
v.  Under the heading “North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS)-Based,” select 
“NAICS web application”
 
vi.  In the drop-down menu “3-digit and 6-digit 
NAICS by country,” select the product category 
you are interested in, and hit “Go”
 
vii.  In the drop-down menu “Select 6-digit NAICS,” 
select the good or service you are interested in, 
and hit “Go”
 
viii.  In the drop-down menus that allow you to select 
a month and year, select “December” and “2010,” 
and hit “Go”
 
ix.  The right side of the table now shows the import 
and export statistics for the entire year 2010. 
For the questions below on U.S. imports, use 

C H A P T E R  8    I N T E R N AT I O N A L T R A D E    241
the column for “Consumption Imports, Customs 
Value Basis.”
 a. Look up data for U.S. imports of hats and caps: in 
step (vi), select “(315) Apparel & Accessories” and 
in step (vii), select “(315991) Hats and Caps.” From 
which country do we import the most hats and 
caps? Which of the three sources of comparative 
advantage (climate, factor endowments, and technol-
ogy) accounts for that country’s comparative advan-
tage in hat and cap production?
 b. Look up data for U.S. imports of grapes: in step 
(vi), select “(111) Agricultural Products” and in 
step (vii), select “(111332) Grapes.” From which 
country do we import the most grapes? Which 
of the three sources of comparative advantage 
(climate, factor endowments, and technology) 
accounts for that country’s comparative advantage 
in grape production?
 c. Look up data for U.S. imports of food product 
machinery: in step (vi), select “(333) Machinery, 
Except Electrical” and in step (vii), select “(333294) 
Food Product Machinery.” From which country do 
we import the most food product machinery? Which 
of the three sources of comparative advantage (cli-
mate, factor endowments, and technology) accounts 
for that country’s comparative advantage in food 
product machinery?
 6. Compare the data for U.S. imports of hats and caps 
from China in 2010 that you found in Problem 5 with 
the same data for the year 2000. Repeat the steps out-
lined in Problem 5, but in step (viii) select “December” 
and “2000.”
 a. What happened to the value of U.S. imports of hats 
and caps from China between 2000 and 2010?
 b. What prediction does the Heckscher–Ohlin model 
make about the wages received by labor in China?
 7. Shoes are labor-intensive and satellites are capital-
intensive to produce. The United States has abundant 
capital. China has abundant labor. According to the 
Heckscher–Ohlin model, which good will China export? 
Which good will the United States export? In the United 
States, what will happen to the price of labor (the wage) 
and to the price of capital?
 8. Before the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) gradually eliminated import tariffs on 
goods, the autarky price of tomatoes in Mexico was 
below the world price and in the United States was 
above the world price. Similarly, the autarky price of 
poultry in Mexico was above the world price and in 
the United States was below the world price. Draw 
diagrams with domestic supply and demand curves 
for each country and each of the two goods. As a 
result of NAFTA, the United States now imports toma-
toes from Mexico and the United States now exports 
poultry to Mexico. How would you expect the follow-
ing groups to be affected?
 a. Mexican and U.S. consumers of tomatoes. Illustrate 
the effect on consumer surplus in your diagram.
 b. Mexican and U.S. producers of tomatoes. Illustrate 
the effect on producer surplus in your diagram.
 c. Mexican and U.S. tomato workers.
 d. Mexican and U.S. consumers of poultry. Illustrate 
the effect on consumer surplus in your diagram.
 e. Mexican and U.S. producers of poultry. Illustrate the 
effect on producer surplus in your diagram.

omy as a whole from the introduction of this tariff.
 11. The U.S. domestic demand schedule and domestic 
supply schedule for oranges was given in Problem 10. 
Suppose that the world price of oranges is $0.30. The 
United States introduces an import quota of 3,000 
oranges and assigns the quota rents to foreign orange 
exporters.
 a. Draw the domestic demand and supply curves.
 b. What will the domestic price of oranges be after 
introduction of the quota?
 c. What is the value of the quota rents that foreign 
exporters of oranges receive?

The world price of beef is PW. The United States cur-
rently imposes an import tariff on beef, so the price of 
beef is PT. Congress decides to eliminate the tariff. In 
terms of the areas marked in the diagram, answer the 
following questions.
 a. What is the gain/loss in consumer surplus?
 b. What is the gain/loss in producer surplus?
 c. What is the gain/loss to the government?
 d. What is the gain/loss to the economy as a whole?
13. As the United States has opened up to trade, it has lost 
many of its low-skill manufacturing jobs, but it has 
gained jobs in high-skill industries, such as the soft-
ware industry. Explain whether the United States as a 
whole has been made better off by trade.
14. The United States is highly protective of its agricultural 
industry, imposing import tariffs, and sometimes quo-
tas, on imports of agricultural goods. This chapter pre-
sented three arguments for trade protection. For each 
argument, discuss whether it is a valid justification for 
trade protection of U.S. agricultural products.
15. In World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, if 
a country agrees to reduce trade barriers (tariffs or 
quotas), it usually refers to this as a concession to 
other countries. Do you think that this terminology 
is appropriate?
16. Producers in import-competing industries often 
make the following argument: “Other countries have 
an advantage in production of certain goods purely 
because workers abroad are paid lower wages. In 
fact, American workers are much more productive 
than foreign workers. So import-competing indus-
tries need to be protected.” Is this a valid argument? 
Explain your answer.

I
N THE SPRING OF 2010, ASHLEY
Hildreth, a class of 2008 journal-
ism major at the University of Oregon, 
was deeply frustrated. After working 
for 18 months in what she described 
as a “dead-end, part-time job” in the 
food industry, she decided to apply to 
a master’s degree program in teaching. 
In explaining her decision, she pointed 
to the many job applications she sub-
mitted without a single call back for 
an interview. What she hoped for was 
an entry-level opportunity in advertis-
ing and marketing or an administrative 
position with a non-profit. What she got 
instead was silence or gentle rejection 
e-mails. After considering her options, 
she decided to apply for graduate school.
Hildreth was far from alone in her 
decision. In the spring of 2010, col-
leges and universities across the coun-
try were reporting a record number of 
applications. Applications soared not 
just for bachelor and associate degree 
programs; as Hildreth’s story illustrates, 
they also soared for graduate and con-
tinuing education programs of all sorts. 
Why did so many people make a similar 
choice in the spring of 2010? We’ll answer 
that question shortly. Before we do, note 
that every year millions of people—just 
like you—face a choice about work versus 
continued schooling: should I continue 
another year (or semester, or quarter) in 
school, or should I get a job? That is, they 
are making a decision. 
This chapter is about the econom-
ics of making decisions: how to make a 
decision that results in the best possible 
economic outcome. Economists have 
formulated principles of decision mak-
ing that lead to the best possible—often 
called “optimal”—outcome, regardless 
of whether the decision maker is a con-
sumer or a producer. 
We’ll start by examining three dif-
ferent types of economic decisions. 
For each of these types, there is a 
corresponding principle, or method, of 
decision making that leads to the best 
possible economic outcome. In this 
chapter, we’ll see why economists con-
sider decision making to be the very 
essence of microeconomics.
Despite the fact that people should 
use the principles of economic decision 
making to achieve the best possible 
economic outcome, they sometimes fail 
to do so. In other words, people are not 
always rational when making decisions. 
For example, a shopper in pursuit of 
a bargain may knowingly spend more 
on gasoline than he or she saves. Yet 
economists have also discovered that 
people are frequently irrational in pre-
dictable ways. In this chapter, we’ll 
learn about these tendencies when 
we discuss behavioral economics, the 
branch of economics that studies pre-
dictably irrational economic behavior.

Costs, Benefits, and Profits
I
n making any type of decision, it’s critical to define the costs and benefits of 
that decision accurately. If you don’t know the costs and benefits, it is nearly 
impossible to make a good decision. So that is where we begin. 
An important first step is to recognize the role of opportunity cost, a concept 
we first encountered in Chapter 1, where we learned that opportunity costs arise 
because resources are scarce. Because resources are scarce, the true cost of any-
thing is what you must give up to get it—its opportunity cost. 
Whether you decide to continue in school for another year or leave to find 
a job, each choice has costs and benefits. Because your time—a resource—is 
scarce, you cannot be both a full-time student and a full-time worker. If you 
choose to be a full-time student, the opportunity cost of that choice is the income 
you would have earned at a full-time job. And there may be additional opportu-
nity costs, such as the value of the experience you would have gained by working. 
When making decisions, it is crucial to think in terms of opportunity cost, 
because the opportunity cost of an action is often considerably more than the cost 
of any outlays of money. Economists use the concepts of explicit costs and implicit 
costs to compare the relationship between opportunity costs and monetary out-
lays. We’ll discuss these two concepts first. Then we’ll define the concepts of 
accounting profit and economic profit, which are ways of measuring whether the 
benefit of an action is greater than the cost. Armed with these concepts for assess-
ing costs and benefits, we will be in a position to consider our first principle of 
economic decision making: how to make “either–or” decisions. 
Explicit versus Implicit Costs
Suppose that, after graduating from college, you have two options: to go to school 
for an additional year to get an advanced degree or to take a job immediately. You 
would like to enroll in the extra year in school but are concerned about the cost.
What exactly is the cost of that additional year of school? Here is where it is 
important to remember the concept of opportunity cost: the cost of the year spent 
getting an advanced degree includes what you forgo by not taking a job for that 
year. The opportunity cost of an additional year of school, like any cost, can be 
broken into two parts: the explicit cost of the year’s schooling and the implicit cost.
An explicit cost is a cost that requires an outlay of money. For example, the explic-
it cost of the additional year of schooling includes tuition. An implicit cost, though, 
does not involve an outlay of money; instead, it is measured by the value, in dollar 
terms, of the benefits that are forgone. For example, the implicit cost of the year spent 
in school includes the income you would have earned if you had taken a job instead.
A common mistake, both in economic analysis and in life—whether individu-
al or business—is to ignore implicit costs and focus exclusively on explicit costs. 
But often the implicit cost of an activity is quite substantial—indeed, sometimes 
it is much larger than the explicit cost.
Table 9-1 gives a breakdown of hypothetical explicit and implicit costs asso-
ciated with spending an additional year in school instead of taking a job. The 
explicit cost consists of tuition, books, 
supplies, and a computer for doing 
assignments—all of which require you 
to spend money. The implicit cost is the 
salary you would have earned if you had 
taken a job instead. As you can see, the 
total cost of attending an additional year 
of schooling is $44,500, the sum of the 
total implicit cost—$35,000 in forgone 
salary, and the total explicit cost—$9,500

An explicit cost is a cost that 
requires an outlay of money. 
An implicit cost does not require 
an outlay of money; it is measured by 
the value, in dollar terms, of benefits 
that are forgone.

in outlays on tuition, supplies, and computer. Because the implicit cost is more 
than three times as much as the explicit cost, ignoring the implicit cost would 
lead to a seriously misguided decision.
A slightly different way of looking at the implicit cost in this example can deep-
en our understanding of opportunity cost. The forgone salary is the cost of using 
your own resources—your time—in going to school rather than working. The use 
of your time for more schooling, despite the fact that you don’t have to spend any 
money on it, is still costly to you. This illustrates an important aspect of opportu-
nity cost: in considering the cost of an activity, you should include the cost of using 
any of your own resources for that activity. You can calculate the cost of using your 
own resources by determining what they would have earned in their next best use.
Understanding the role of opportunity costs makes clear the reason for the 
surge in school applications in 2010: a rotten job market. Starting in 2009, the 
U.S. job market deteriorated sharply as the economy entered a severe recession. 
By 2010, the job market was still quite weak; although job openings had begun 
to reappear, a relatively high proportion of those openings were for jobs with low 
wages and no benefits. As a result, the opportunity cost of another year of school-
ing had declined significantly, making spending another year at school a much 
more attractive choice than when the job market was strong. 
Accounting Profit versus Economic Profit
Let’s return to Ashley Hildreth. Assume, hypothetically, that Ashley faces the 
choice of either completing a two-year full-time graduate program in teaching or 
spending those two years working in her original field of advertising. We’ll also 
assume that in order to be certified as a teacher, she must complete the entire two 
years of the graduate program. Which choice should she make?
First, let’s consider what Ashley gains by getting the teaching degree—what 
we might call her revenue from the teaching degree. Once she has completed her 
teaching degree two years from now, she will receive earnings from her teaching 
degree valued at $600,000 over the rest of her lifetime. In contrast, if she doesn’t 
get the teaching degree and stays in advertising, two years from now her future 
lifetime earnings will be valued at $500,000. The cost of the tuition for her teach-
ing degree program is $40,000, which she pays for with a student loan that costs 
her $4,000 in interest. 
At this point, what she should do might seem obvious: if she chooses the teaching 
degree, she gets a lifetime increase in the value of her earnings of $600,000 − $500,000 = 
$100,000, and she pays $40,000 in tuition plus $4,000 in interest. Doesn’t that mean she 
makes a profit of $100,000 – $40,000 – $4,000 = $56,000 by getting her teaching degree? 
This $56,000 is Ashley’s accounting profit from obtaining her teaching degree: her 
revenue minus her explicit cost. In this example her explicit cost of getting the degree 
is $44,000, the amount of her tuition plus student loan interest.
Although accounting profit is a useful measure, it would be misleading 
for Ashley to use it alone in making her decision. To make the right decision, 
the one that leads to the best possible economic outcome for her, she needs 
to calculate her economic profit—the revenue she receives from the teach-
ing degree minus her opportunity cost of staying in school (which is equal to 
her explicit cost plus her implicit cost). In general, the economic profit of a 
given project will be less than the accounting profit because there are almost 
always implicit costs in addition to explicit costs. 
When economists use the term profit, they are referring to economic 
profit, not accounting profit. This will be our convention in the remainder 
of the book: when we use the term profit, we mean economic profit.
How does Ashley’s economic profit of staying in school differ from her 
accounting profit? We’ve already encountered one source of the difference: 
her two years of forgone job earnings. This is an implicit cost of going to 
“I’ve done the numbers, and I will marry you.”

Accounting profit is equal to 
revenue minus explicit cost.
Economic profit is equal to 
revenue minus the opportunity cost 
of resources used. It is usually less 
than the accounting profit.

school full time for two years. We assume that Ashley’s total forgone earnings for 
the two years is $57,000.
Once we factor in Ashley’s implicit costs and calculate her economic profit, 
we see that she is better off not getting a teaching degree. You can see this in 
Table 9-2: her economic profit from getting the teaching degree is −$1,000. In 
other words, she incurs an economic loss of $1,000 if she gets the degree. Clearly, 
she is better off sticking to adver-
tising and going to work now.
To make sure that the concepts 
of opportunity costs and economic 
profit are well understood, let’s 
consider a slightly different sce-
nario. Let’s suppose that Ashley 
does not have to take out $40,000 
in student loans to pay her tuition. 
Instead, she can pay for it with an 
inheritance from her grandmoth-
er. As a result, she doesn’t have to 
pay $4,000 in interest. In this case, 
her accounting profit is $60,000 rather than $56,000. Would the right decision now 
be for her to get the teaching degree? Wouldn’t the economic profit of the degree 
now be $60,000 − $57,000 = $3,000? 
The answer is no, because Ashley is using her own capital to finance her edu-
cation, and the use of that capital has an opportunity cost even when she owns 
it. Capital is the total value of the assets of an individual or a firm. An individ-
ual’s capital usually consists of cash in the bank, stocks, bonds, and the owner-
ship value of real estate such as a house. In the case of a business, capital also 
includes its equipment, its tools, and its inventory of unsold goods and used parts. 
(Economists like to distinguish between financial assets, such as cash, stocks, and 
bonds, and physical assets, such as buildings, equipment, tools, and inventory.)
The point is that even if Ashley owns the $40,000, using it to pay tuition incurs 
an opportunity cost—what she forgoes in the next best use of that $40,000. If she 
hadn’t used the money to pay her tuition, her next best use of the money would 
have been to deposit it in a bank to earn interest. To keep things simple, let’s 
assume that she earns $4,000 on that $40,000 once it is deposited in a bank. Now, 
rather than pay $4,000 in explicit costs in the form of student loan interest, Ashley 
pays $4,000 in implicit costs from the forgone interest she could have earned. 
This $4,000 in forgone interest earnings is what economists call the implicit 
cost of capital—the income the owner of the capital could have earned if the 
capital had been employed in its next best alternative use. The net effect is that it 
makes no difference whether Ashley finances her tuition with a student loan or 
by using her own funds. This comparison reinforces how carefully you must keep 
track of opportunity costs when making a decision.
Making “Either–Or” Decisions
An “either–or” decision is one in which you must choose between two activities. 
That’s in contrast to a “how much” decision, which requires you to choose how 
much of a given activity to undertake. For example, Ashley faced an “either–or” 
decision: to spend two years in graduate school to obtain a teaching degree, or 
to work. In contrast, a “how much” decision would be deciding how many hours 
to study or how many hours to work at a job. Table 9-3 contrasts a variety of 
“either–or” and “how much” decisions.
In making economic decisions, as we have already emphasized, it is vitally 
important to calculate opportunity costs correctly. The best way to make an 
“either–or” decision, the method that leads to the best possible economic outcome, 
is the straightforward principle of “either–or” decision making. According to 
Capital is the total value of assets 
owned by an individual or firm—
physical assets plus financial assets.
The implicit cost of capital is the 
opportunity cost of the use of one’s 
own capital—the income earned if 
the capital had been employed in its 
next best alternative use.
According to the principle of 
“either–or” decision making, 
when faced with an “either–or” 
choice between two activities, 
choose the one with the positive 
economic profit.

this principle, when making an “either–or” 
choice between two activities, choose the one 
with the positive economic profit.
Let’s examine Ashley’s dilemma from 
a different angle to understand how this 
principle works. If she continues with 
advertising and goes to work immediately, 
the total value of her lifetime earnings is 
$57,000 (her earnings over the next two 
years) + $500,000 (the value of her life-
time earnings thereafter) = $557,000. If 
she gets her teaching degree instead and 
works as a teacher, the total value of her 
lifetime earnings is $600,000 (value of her 
lifetime earnings after two years in school) − $40,000 (tuition) − $4,000 
(interest payments) = $556,000. The economic profit from continuing in 
advertising versus becoming a teacher is $557,000 − $556,000 = $1,000. 
So the right choice for Ashley is to begin work in advertising immedi-
ately, which gives her an economic profit of $1,000, rather than become 
a teacher, which would give her an economic profit of −$1,000. In other 
words, by becoming a teacher she loses the $1,000 economic profit she 
would have gained by working in advertising immediately.
In making “either–or” decisions, mistakes most commonly arise when 
people or businesses use their own assets in projects rather than rent or 
borrow assets. That’s because they fail to account for the implicit cost of 
using self-owned capital. In contrast, when they rent or borrow assets, these 
rental or borrowing costs show up as explicit costs. If, for example, a res-
taurant owns its equipment and tools, it would have to compute its implicit 
cost of capital by calculating how much the equipment could be sold for and 
how much could be earned by using those funds in the next best alternative 
project. In addition, businesses run by the owner (an entrepreneur) often fail 
to calculate the opportunity cost of the owner’s time in running the busi-
ness. In that way, small businesses often underestimate their opportunity 
costs and overestimate their economic profit of staying in business. 
Are we implying that the hundreds of thousands who have chosen to 
go back to school rather than find work in recent years are misguided? 
Not necessarily. As we mentioned before, the poor job market has greatly 
diminished the opportunity cost of forgone wages for many students, 
making continuing their education the optimal choice for them.
The following Economics in Action illustrates just how important it 
is in real life to understand the difference between accounting profit and 
economic profit.

FARMING IN THE SHADOW OF SUBURBIA

eyond the sprawling suburbs, most of New England is covered by dense for-
est. But this is not the forest primeval: if you hike through the woods, you 
encounter many stone walls, relics of the region’s agricultural past when stone 
walls enclosed fields and pastures. In 1880, more than half of New England’s land 
was farmed; by 2009, the amount was down to 10%.
The remaining farms of New England are mainly located close to large metro-
politan areas. There farmers get high prices for their produce from city dwellers who 
are willing to pay a premium for locally grown, extremely fresh fruits and vegetables.
But now even these farms are under economic pressure caused by a rise in the 
implicit cost of farming close to a metropolitan area. As metropolitan areas have

WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWO CHOICES?
In “either–or” decision making, we have 
assumed that there are only two activities to 
choose from. But, what if, instead of just two 
alternatives, there are three or more? Does 
the principle of “either–or” decision making 
still apply?
Yes, it does. That’s because any choice 
between three (or more) alternatives can 
always be boiled down to a series of choices 
between two alternatives. Here’s an illustration 
using three alternative activities: A, B, or C. 
(Remember that this is an “either–or” decision: 
you can choose only one of the three alterna-
tives.) Let’s say you begin by considering A 
versus B: in this comparison, A has a positive 
economic profit but B yields an economic loss. 
At this point, you should discard B as a viable 
choice because A will always be superior to B. 
The next step is to compare A to C: in this com-
parison, C has a positive economic profit but A 
yields an economic loss. You can now discard 
A because C will always be superior to A. You 
are now done: since A is better than B, and C is 
better than A, C is the correct choice.

expanded during the last two decades, farmers increasingly ask 
themselves whether they could do better by selling their land to prop-
erty developers.
In 2009, the average value of an acre of farmland in the United 
States as a whole was $2,100; in Rhode Island, the most densely 
populated of the New England states, the average was $15,300. The 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted that “high land prices 
put intense pressure on the region’s farms to generate incomes that 
are substantial enough to justify keeping the land in agriculture.” 
The important point is that the pressure is intense even if the 
farmer owns the land because the land is a form of capital used 
to run the business. So maintaining the land as a farm instead of 
selling it to a developer constitutes a large implicit cost of capital.
A fact provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
helps us put a dollar figure on the portion of the implicit cost of 
capital due to development pressure for some Rhode Island farms. 
In 2004, a USDA program designed to prevent development of Rhode Island farm-
land by paying owners for the “development rights” to their land paid an average 
of $4,949 per acre for those rights alone. By 2009, the amount had risen to $15,366.
About two-thirds of New England’s farms remaining in business earn very 
little money. They are maintained as “rural residences” by people with other 
sources of income—not because operating them is an optimal choice, but more 
out of a personal commitment and the satisfaction these people derive from farm 
life. Although many businesses have important implicit costs, they can also have 
important benefits to their owners that go beyond the revenue earned.

 Quick Review

C H A P T E R  9    D EC I S I O N  M A K I N G  BY  I N D I V I D UA L S  A N D  FI R M S    249
Recall from our principles of microeconomics that “how much” is a decision 
at the margin. So to understand “how much” decisions, we will use an approach 
known as marginal analysis. Marginal analysis involves comparing the benefit of 
doing a little bit more of some activity with the cost of doing a little bit more of 
that activity. The benefit of doing a little bit more of something is what econo-
mists call its marginal benefit, and the cost of doing a little bit more of something 
is what they call its marginal cost.
Why is this called “marginal” analysis? A margin is an edge; what you do in mar-
ginal analysis is push out the edge a bit and see whether that is a good move. We will 
study marginal analysis by considering a hypothetical decision of how many years of 
school to complete. We’ll consider the case of Alex, who studies computer program-
ming and design. Since there are many computer languages, app design methods, and 
graphics programs that can be learned one year at a time, each year Alex can decide 
whether to continue his studies or not. Unlike Ashley, who faced an “either–or” decision 
of whether to get a teaching degree, Alex faces a “how much” decision of how many 
years to study computer programming and design. For example, he could study one 
more year, or five more years, or any number of years in between. We’ll begin our anal-
ysis of Alex’s decision problem by defining Alex’s marginal cost of another year of study.
Marginal Cost
We’ll assume that each additional year of schooling costs Alex $10,000 in explicit 
costs—tuition, interest on a student loan, and so on. In addition to the explicit costs, 
he also has implicit costs—the income forgone by spending one more year in school. 
Unlike Alex’s explicit costs, which are constant (that is, the same each year), Alex’s 
implicit cost changes each year. That’s because each year he spends in school leaves 
him better trained than the year before; and the better trained he is, the higher the sal-
ary he can command. Consequently, the income he forgoes by not working rises each 
additional year he stays in school. In other words, the greater the number of years 
Alex has already spent in school, the higher his implicit cost of another year of school.
Table 9-4 contains the data on how Alex’s cost of an additional year of school-
ing changes as he completes more years. The second column shows how his total 
cost of schooling changes as the number of years he has 
completed increases. For example, Alex’s first year has a 
total cost of $30,000: $10,000 in explicit costs of tuition 
and the like as well as $20,000 in forgone salary. 
The second column also shows that the total cost of 
attending two years is $70,000: $30,000 for his first year 
plus $40,000 for his second year. During his second year in 
school, his explicit costs have stayed the same ($10,000) but 
his implicit cost of forgone salary has gone up to $30,000. 
That’s because he’s a more valuable worker with one year of 
schooling under his belt than with no schooling. Likewise, 
the total cost of three years of schooling is $130,000: $30,000 
in explicit cost for three years of tuition plus $100,000 in 
implicit cost of three years of forgone salary. The total cost of 
attending four years is $220,000, and $350,000 for five years. 
The change in Alex’s total cost of schooling when he goes to school an additional 
year is his marginal cost of the one-year increase in years of schooling. In general, 
the marginal cost of producing a good or service (in this case, producing one’s 
own education) is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of that 
good or service. The arrows, which zigzag between the total costs in the second 
column and the marginal costs in the third column, are there to help you to see 
how marginal cost is calculated from total cost, and vice versa. 
As already mentioned, the third column of Table 9-4 shows Alex’s marginal 
costs of more years of schooling, which have a clear pattern: they are increasing.

They go from $30,000, to $40,000, to $60,000, to $90,000, and finally to $130,000 
for the fifth year of schooling. That’s because each year of schooling would make 
Alex a more valuable and highly paid employee if he were to work. As a result, 
forgoing a job becomes more and more costly as he becomes more educated. 
This is an example of what economists call increasing marginal cost, which 
occurs when each unit of a good costs more to produce than the previous unit. 
Figure 9-1 shows a marginal cost curve, a graphic representation of Alex’s 
marginal costs. The height of each shaded bar corresponds to the marginal cost of 
a given year of schooling. The red line connecting the dots at the midpoint of the 
top of each bar is Alex’s marginal cost curve. Alex has an upward-sloping marginal 
cost curve because he has increasing marginal cost of additional years of schooling.
Although increasing marginal cost is a frequent phenomenon in real life, it’s not 
the only possibility. Constant marginal cost occurs when the cost of producing 
an additional unit is the same as the cost of producing the previous unit. Plant nurs-
eries, for example, typically have constant marginal cost—the cost of growing one 
more plant is the same, regardless of how many plants have already been produced. 
With constant marginal cost, the marginal cost curve is a horizontal line. 
There can also be decreasing marginal cost, which occurs when marginal 
cost falls as the number of units produced increases. With decreasing marginal cost, 
the marginal cost line is downward sloping. Decreasing marginal cost is often due to 
learning effects in production: for complicated tasks, such as assembling a new model 
of a car, workers are often slow and mistake-prone when assembling the earliest 
units, making for higher marginal cost on those units. But as workers gain experi-
ence, assembly time and the rate of mistakes fall, generating lower marginal cost for 
later units. As a result, overall production has decreasing marginal cost. 
Finally, for the production of some goods and services the shape of the marginal 
cost curve changes as the number of units produced increases. For example, auto 
production is likely to have decreasing marginal costs for the first batch of cars pro-
duced as workers iron out kinks and mistakes in production. Then production has 
constant marginal costs for the next batch of cars as workers settle into a predictable 
pace. But at some point, as workers produce more and more cars, marginal cost 
begins to increase as they run out of factory floor space and the auto company incurs 
costly overtime wages. This gives rise to what we call a “swoosh”-shaped marginal 
cost curve—a topic we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 11. For now, we’ll stick 
to the simpler example of an increasing marginal cost curve.

The height of each shaded bar corresponds to Alex’s 
marginal cost of an additional year of schooling. The 
height of each bar is higher than the preceding one 
because each year of schooling costs more than 
the previous years. As a result, Alex has increasing 
marginal cost and the marginal cost curve, the line 
connecting the midpoints at the top of each bar, is 
upward sloping.

Marginal Benefit
Alex benefits from higher lifetime earnings as he 
completes more years of school. Exactly how much he 
benefits is shown in Table 9-5. Column 2 shows Alex’s 
total benefit according to the number of years of school 
completed, expressed as the value of the increase in 
lifetime earnings. The third column shows Alex’s mar-
ginal benefit from an additional year of schooling. In 
general, the marginal benefit of producing a good or 
service is the additional benefit earned from producing 
one more unit. 
As in Table 9-4, the data in the third column of Table 
9-5 show a clear pattern. However, this time the numbers 
are decreasing rather than increasing. The first year of 
schooling gives Alex a $300,000 increase in the value 
of his lifetime earnings. The second year also gives him 
a positive return, but the size of that return has fallen to $150,000; the third 
year’s return is also positive, but its size has fallen yet again to $90,000; and so 
on. In other words, the more years of school that Alex has already completed, 
the smaller the increase in the value of his lifetime earnings from attending 
one more year. Alex’s schooling decision has what economists call decreasing 
marginal benefit: each additional year of school yields a smaller benefit than 
the previous year. Or, to put it slightly differently, with decreasing marginal ben-
efit, the benefit from producing one more unit of the good or service falls as the 
quantity already produced rises. 
Just as marginal cost can be represented by a marginal cost curve, mar-
ginal benefit can be represented by a marginal benefit curve, shown in blue 
in Figure 9-2. Alex’s marginal benefit curve slopes downward because he faces 
decreasing marginal benefit from additional years of schooling.
Not all goods or activities exhibit decreasing marginal benefit. In fact, there 
are many goods for which the marginal benefit of production is constant—that 
is, the additional benefit from producing one more unit is the same regardless of 
the number of units already produced. In later chapters where we study firms, we 
will see that the shape of a firm’s marginal benefit curve from producing output 
has important implications for how that firm behaves within its industry. We’ll

PITFALLS
TOTAL COST VERSUS 
MARGINAL COST
It can be easy to conclude that marginal 
cost and total cost must always move in 
the same direction. That is, if total cost 
is rising, then marginal cost must also be 
rising. Or if marginal cost is falling, then 
total cost must be falling as well. But the 
following example shows that this con-
clusion is wrong.
Let’s consider the example of auto 
production, which, as we mentioned ear-
lier, is likely to involve learning effects. 
Suppose that for the first batch of cars 
of a new model, each car costs $10,000 
to assemble. As workers gain experi-
ence with the new model, they become 
better at production. As a result, the 
per-car cost of assembly falls to $8,000 
for the second batch. For the third batch, 
the per-car assembly cost falls again 
to $6,500 as workers continue to gain 
expertise. For the fourth batch, the per-
car cost of assembly falls to $5,000 and 
remains constant for the rest of the pro-
duction run.
In this example, marginal cost is 
decreasing over batches one through four, 
falling from $10,000 to $5,000. However, 
it’s important to note that total cost is 
still increasing over the entire production 
run because marginal cost is greater than 
zero. To see this point, assume that each 
batch consists of 100 cars. Then the total 
cost of producing the first batch is 100 × 
$10,000 = $1,000,000. The total cost 
of producing the first and second batch 
of cars is $1,000,000 + (100 × $8,000) = 
$1,800,000. Likewise, the total cost of 
producing the first, second, and third 
batch is $1,800,000 + (100 × $6,500) = 
$2,450,000, and so on. As you can see, 
although marginal cost is decreasing over 
the first few batches of cars, total cost is 
increasing over the same batches. 
This shows us that totals and 
marginals can sometimes move in 
opposite directions. So it is wrong to 
assert that they always move in the 
same direction. What we can assert 
is that total cost increases whenever 
marginal cost is positive, regardless 
of whether marginal cost is increasing 
or decreasing.
The marginal benefit of a good 
or service is the additional benefit 
derived from producing one more 
unit of that good or service.
There is decreasing marginal 
benefit from an activity when each 
additional unit of the activity yields 
less benefit than the previous unit.
The marginal benefit curve shows 
how the benefit from producing one 
more unit depends on the quantity 
that has already been produced.

also see in Chapters 11 and 12 why constant marginal benefit is considered the 
norm for many important industries.
Now we are ready to see how the concepts of marginal benefit and marginal 
cost are brought together to answer the question of how many years of additional 
schooling Alex should undertake.
Marginal Analysis
Table 9-6 shows the marginal cost and marginal benefit numbers from Tables 9-4 
and 9-5. It also adds an additional column: the additional profit to Alex from staying 
in school one more year, equal to the difference between the marginal benefit and 
the marginal cost of that additional year in school. (Remember that it is Alex’s eco-
nomic profit that we care about, not his accounting profit.) We can now use Table 
9-6 to determine how many additional years of schooling Alex should undertake in 
order to maximize his total profit.
First, imagine that Alex chooses not to 
attend any additional years of school. We 
can see from column 4 that this is a mistake 
if Alex wants to achieve the highest total 
profit from his schooling—the sum of the 
additional profits generated by another year 
of schooling. If he attends one additional 
year of school, he increases the value of his 
lifetime earnings by $270,000, the profit 
from the first additional year attended.
Now, let’s consider whether Alex should 
attend the second year of school. The 
additional profit from the second year is 
$110,000, so Alex should attend the second year as well. What about the third year? 
The additional profit from that year is $30,000; so, yes, Alex should attend the 
third year as well. What about a fourth year? In this case, the additional profit is 
negative: it is –$30,000. Alex loses $30,000 of the value of his lifetime earnings if he 
attends the fourth year. Clearly, Alex is worse off by attending the fourth additional 
year rather than taking a job. And the same is true for the fifth year as well: it has 
a negative additional profit of –$80,000.

The height of each shaded bar corresponds to Alex’s

The height of each bar is lower than the one pre-
ceding it because an additional year of schooling 
has decreasing marginal benefit. As a result, Alex’s 
marginal benefit curve, the curve connecting the mid-
points at the top of each bar, is downward sloping.

What have we learned? That Alex should attend three additional years of 
school and stop at that point. Although the first, second, and third years of addi-
tional schooling increase the value of his lifetime earnings, the fourth and fifth 
years diminish it. So three years of additional schooling lead to the quantity that 
generates the maximum possible total profit. It is what economists call the opti-
mal quantity—the quantity that generates the maximum possible total profit. 
Figure 9-3 shows how the optimal quantity can be determined graphically. 
Alex’s marginal benefit and marginal cost curves are shown together. If Alex 
chooses fewer than three additional years (that is, years 0, 1, or 2), he will choose 
a level of schooling at which his marginal benefit curve lies above his marginal 
cost curve. He can make himself better off by staying in school. If instead he 
chooses more than three additional years (years 4 or 5), he will choose a level of 
schooling at which his marginal benefit curve lies below his marginal cost curve. 
He can make himself better off by not attending the additional year of school and 
taking a job instead. 
The table in Figure 9-3 confirms our result. The second column repeats infor-
mation from Table 9-6, showing Alex’s marginal benefit minus marginal cost—the 
additional profit per additional year of schooling. The third column shows Alex’s 
total profit for different years of schooling. The total profit, for each possible year 
of schooling is simply the sum of numbers in the second column up to and includ-
ing that year. For example, Alex’s profit from additional years of schooling is 
$270,000 for the first year and $110,000 for the second year. So the total profit for 
two additional years of schooling is $270,000 + $110,000 = $380,000. Similarly, the 
total profit for three additional years is $270,000 + $110,000 + $30,000 = $410,000. 
Our claim that three years is the optimal quantity for Alex is confirmed by the 
data in the table in Figure 9-3: at three years of additional schooling, Alex reaps 
the greatest total profit, $410,000.

Optimal quantity
The optimal quantity is the quantity that generates the 
highest possible total profit. It is the quantity at which 
marginal benefit is greater than or equal to marginal 
cost. Equivalently, it is the quantity at which the marginal 
benefit and marginal cost curves intersect. Here, they 
intersect at 3 additional years of schooling. The table 
confirms that 3 is indeed the optimal quantity: it leads to 
the maximum total profit of $410,000.
The optimal quantity is the 
quantity that generates the highest 
possible total profit.

Alex’s decision problem illustrates how you go about finding the optimal quantity 
when the choice involves a small number of quantities. (In this example, one through 
five years.) With small quantities, the rule for choosing the optimal quantity is: increase 
the quantity as long as the marginal benefit from one more unit is greater than the mar-
ginal cost, but stop before the marginal benefit becomes less than the marginal cost.
In contrast, when a “how much” decision involves relatively large quantities, 
the rule for choosing the optimal quantity simplifies to this: The optimal quan-
tity is the quantity at which marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost.
To see why this is so, consider the example of a farmer who finds that her optimal 
quantity of wheat produced is 5,000 bushels. Typically, she will find that in going 
from 4,999 to 5,000 bushels, her marginal benefit is only very slightly greater than 
her marginal cost—that is, the difference between marginal benefit and marginal 
cost is close to zero. Similarly, in going from 5,000 to 5,001 bushels, her marginal cost 
is only very slightly greater than her marginal benefit—again, the difference between 
marginal cost and marginal benefit is very close to zero. So a simple rule for her in 
choosing the optimal quantity of wheat is to produce the quantity at which the dif-
ference between marginal benefit and marginal cost is approximately zero—that is, 
the quantity at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost.
Now we are ready to state the general rule for choosing the optimal quantity—one 
that applies for decisions involving either small quantities or large quantities. This 
general rule is known as the profit-maximizing principle of marginal analysis: 
When making a profit-maximizing “how much” decision, the optimal quantity is the 
Health experts call it the “French Paradox.” If you 
think French food is fattening, you’re right: the 
French diet is, on average, higher in fat than the 
American diet. Yet the French themselves are con-
siderably thinner than we are: in 2011, between 
9 to 11% of French adults were classified as 
obese, compared with 33.8% of Americans.
What’s the secret? It seems that the French 
simply eat less, largely because they eat smaller 
portions. This chart compares average portion sizes 
at food establishments in Paris and Philadelphia. In 
four cases, researchers looked at portions served 
by the same chain; in the other cases, they looked 
at comparable establishments, such as local pizza 
parlors. In every case but one, U.S. portions were 
bigger, in most cases much bigger.
Why are American portions so big? Because 
food is cheaper in the United States. At the mar-
gin, it makes sense for restaurants to offer big 
portions, since the additional cost of enlarging a 
portion is relatively small. As a recent newspaper 
article states: “So while it may cost a restaurant a 
few pennies to offer 25% more French fries, it can 
raise its prices much more than a few cents. The 
result is that larger portions are a reliable way to bolster the average check at [American] restaurants.” So if you have ever 
wondered why dieting seems to be a uniquely American obsession, the principle of marginal analysis can help provide the 
answer: it’s to counteract the effects of our larger portion sizes.

According to the profit-maximizing 
principle of marginal analysis, 
when faced with a profit-maximizing 
“how much” decision, the optimal 
quantity is the largest quantity at 
which the marginal benefit is greater 
than or equal to marginal cost.

C H A P T E R  9    D EC I S I O N  M A K I N G  BY  I N D I V I D UA L S  A N D  FI R M S    255
largest quantity at which marginal benefit is greater than or equal to mar-
ginal cost.
Graphically, the optimal quantity is the quantity of an activity 
at which the marginal benefit curve intersects the marginal cost 
curve. For example, in Figure 9-3 the marginal benefit and mar-
ginal cost curves cross each other at three years—that is, marginal 
benefit equals marginal cost at the choice of three additional years 
of schooling, which we have already seen is Alex’s optimal quantity.
A straightforward application of marginal analysis explains why 
so many people went back to school in 2009 through 2011: in the 
depressed job market, the marginal cost of another year of school 
fell because the opportunity cost of forgone wages had fallen. 
A straightforward application of marginal analysis can also 
explain many facts, such as why restaurant portion sizes in the 
United States are typically larger than those in other countries (as 
was just discussed in the Global Comparison).
A Principle with Many Uses
The profit-maximizing principle of marginal analysis can be applied to 
just about any “how much” decision in which you want to maximize the 
total profit for an activity. It is equally applicable to production decisions, consump-
tion decisions, and policy decisions. Furthermore, decisions where the benefits and 
costs are not expressed in dollars and cents can also be made using marginal analysis 
(as long as benefits and costs can be measured in some type of common units). Here 
are a few examples of decisions that are suitable for marginal analysis:
 • A producer, the retailer PalMart, must decide on the size of the new store it 
is constructing in Beijing. It makes this decision by comparing the marginal 
benefit of enlarging the store by 1 square foot (the value of the additional sales 
it makes from that additional square foot of floor space) to the marginal cost 
(the cost of constructing and maintaining the additional square foot). The 
optimal store size for PalMart is the largest size at which marginal benefit is 
greater than or equal to marginal cost.
 • Many useful drugs have side effects that depend on the dosage. So a physician 
must consider the marginal cost, in terms of side effects, of increasing the dosage 
of a drug versus the marginal benefit of improving health by increasing the dos-
age. The optimal dosage level is the largest level at which the marginal benefit of 
disease amelioration is greater than or equal to the marginal cost of side effects.
 • A farmer must decide how much fertilizer to apply. More fertilizer increases 
crop yield but also costs more. The optimal amount of fertilizer is the largest 
quantity at which the marginal benefit of higher crop yield is greater than or 
equal to the marginal cost of purchasing and applying more fertilizer. 
A Preview: How Consumption Decisions Are Different We’ve established 
that marginal analysis is an extraordinarily useful tool. It is used in “how much” 
decisions that are applied to both consumption choices and to profit maximiza-
tion. Producers use it to make optimal production decisions at the margin and 
individuals use it to make optimal consumption decisions at the margin. But con-
sumption decisions differ in form from production decisions. Why the difference? 
Because when individuals make choices, they face a limited amount of income. 
As a result, when they choose more of one good to consume (say, new clothes), 
they must choose less of another good (say, restaurant dinners). In contrast, deci-
sions that involve maximizing profit by producing a good or service—such as 
years of education or tons of wheat—are not affected by income limitations.  For 
example, in Alex’s case, he is not limited by income because he can always borrow 
to pay for another year of school. In Chapter 10 we we will see how consumption 
decisions differ from production decisions—but also how they are similar. 
PITFALLS
MUDDLED AT THE MARGIN
The idea of setting marginal benefit equal to mar-
ginal cost sometimes confuses people. Aren’t we 
trying to maximize the difference between ben-
efits and costs? Yes. And don’t we wipe out our 
gains by setting benefits and costs equal to each 
other? Yes. But that is not what we are doing. 
Rather, what we are doing is setting marginal, 
not total, benefit and cost equal to each other.
Once again, the point is to maximize the total 
profit from an activity. If the marginal benefit from 
the activity is greater than the marginal cost, doing 
a bit more will increase that gain. If the marginal 
benefit is less than the marginal cost, doing a bit 
less will increase the total profit. So only when the 
marginal benefit and marginal cost are equal is 
the difference between total benefit and total cost 
at a maximum.

THE COST OF A LIFE
W
hat’s the marginal benefit to society of saving a human life? You might be 
tempted to answer that human life is infinitely precious. If in the real world, 
resources are scarce, so we must decide how much to spend on saving lives since we 
cannot spend infinite amounts. After all, we could surely reduce highway deaths by 
dropping the speed limit on interstates to 40 miles per hour, but the cost of such a 
lower speed limit—in time and money—is more than most people are willing to pay.
Generally, people are reluctant to talk in a straightforward way about com-
paring the marginal cost of a life saved with the marginal benefit—it sounds too 
callous. Sometimes, however, the question becomes unavoidable.
For example, the cost of saving a life became an object of intense discussion 
in the United Kingdom after a horrible train crash near London’s Paddington 
Station killed 31 people. There were accusations that the British government 
was spending too little on rail safety. However, the government estimated that 
improving rail safety would cost an additional $4.5 million per life saved. But 
if that amount was worth spending—that is, if the estimated marginal benefit 
of saving a life exceeded $4.5 million—then the implication was that the British 
government was spending far too little on traffic safety. In contrast, the estimated 
marginal cost per life saved through highway improvements was only $1.5 mil-
lion, making it a much better deal than saving lives through greater rail safety.

to take into account when making a decision, some costs should be

of costs that people should ignore when making decisions—what

To gain some intuition, consider the following scenario. You

 Quick Review
The $250 you already spent on brake pads
The $250 you already spent on brake pads
is irrelevant because it is a sunk cost.

the entire brake system is defective and also must be replaced. This will 
cost you an additional $1,500. Alternatively, you could sell the car and 
buy another of comparable quality, but with no brake defects, by spending 
an additional $1,600. What should you do: fix your old car, or sell it and 
buy another?
Some might say that you should take the latter option. After all, this line of 
reasoning goes, if you repair your car, you will end up having spent $1,750: $1,500 
for the brake system and $250 for the brake pads. If instead you sell your old car 
and buy another, you would spend only $1,600.
But this reasoning, although it sounds plausible, is wrong. It is wrong 
because it ignores the fact that you have already spent $250 on brake 
pads, and that $250 is nonrecoverable. That is, having already been spent, 
the $250 cannot be recouped. Therefore, it should be ignored and should 
have no effect on your decision whether or not to repair your car and keep it. 
From a rational viewpoint, the real cost at this time of repairing and keeping 
your car is $1,500, not $1,750. So the correct decision is to repair your car 
and keep it rather than spend $1,600 on a new car.
In this example, the $250 that has already been spent and cannot be recov-
ered is what economists call a sunk cost. Sunk costs should be ignored in 
making decisions about future actions because they have no influence on their 
actual costs and benefits. It’s like the old saying, “There’s no use crying over 
spilled milk”: once something can’t be recovered, it is irrelevant in making 
decisions about what to do in the future.
It is often psychologically hard to ignore sunk costs. And if, in fact, you 
haven’t yet incurred the costs, then you should take them into consideration. 
That is, if you had known at the beginning that it would cost $1,750 to repair 
your car, then the right choice at that time would have been to buy a new car 
for $1,600. But once you have already paid the $250 for brake pads, you should 
no longer include it in your decision making about your next actions. It may 
be hard to accept that “bygones are bygones,” but it is the right way to make 
a decision.

f there is any industry that exemplifies the principle that sunk costs don’t 
matter, it has to be the biotech industry. Biotech firms use cutting-
edge bioengineering techniques to combat disease. But according to 
Arthur Levinson, chief executive of Genentech, one of the largest and 
most successful biotech firms, biotechnology has been “one of the big-
gest money-losing industries in the history of mankind.” He estimates 
that the industry has lost nearly $100 billion since 1976 (yes, that’s 
“billion”). Of 225 publicly held American biotech firms, only 17 were 
profitable in 2009.
However, this is not a tale of incompetence because the problem lies in 
the nature of the science. It takes about seven to eight years, on average, 
to develop and bring a new drug to the market. Moreover, there is a huge 
failure rate along the way, as only one in five drugs tested on humans ever 
makes it to market.
The company Xoma is a case in point: it has suffered setbacks on 
several drugs addressing diseases as varied as acne and complications 
from organ transplants. Since 1981, it has never earned a profit on one of 
its own drugs and has burned through more than $780 million dollars. 
Why does Xoma keep going? And, more importantly, why are investors 
A sunk cost is a cost that has 
already been incurred and is

Behavioral Economics
M
ost economic models assume that people make choices based on achiev-
ing the best possible economic outcome for themselves. Human behav-
ior, however, is often not so simple. Rather than acting like economic 
computing machines, people often make choices that fall short—sometimes far 
short—of the greatest possible economic outcome, or payoff. Why people some-
times make less-than-perfect choices is the subject of behavioral economics, 
a branch of economics that combines economic modeling with insights from 
human psychology. Behavioral economics grew out of economists’ and psycholo-
gists’ attempts to understand how people actually make—instead of theoretically 
make—economic choices. 
It’s well documented that people consistently engage in irrational behavior, 
choosing an option that leaves them worse off than other available options. Yet, as 
we’ll soon learn, sometimes it’s entirely rational for people to make a choice that 
is different from the one that generates the highest possible profit for themselves. 
For example, Ashley may decide to earn a teaching degree because she enjoys 
teaching more than advertising, even though the profit from the teaching degree 
is less than that from continuing with advertising. 
The study of irrational economic behavior was largely pioneered by Daniel 
Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize in econom-
ics for his work integrating insights from the psychology of human judgment and 
decision making into economics. Their work and the insights of others into why 
people often behave irrationally are having a significant influence on how econo-
mists analyze financial markets, labor markets, and other economic concerns. 
Rational, but Human, Too
If you are rational, you will choose the available option that leads to the outcome 
you most prefer. But is the outcome you most prefer always the same as the one 
that gives you the best possible economic payoff? No. It can be entirely rational to 
choose an option that gives you a worse economic payoff because you care about 
• Sunk costs should be ignored in 
decisions regarding future actions. 
Because they have already been 
incurred and are nonrecoverable, 
they have no effect on future costs 
and benefits.

A rational decision maker chooses 
the available option that leads to the 
outcome he or she most prefers.

something other than the size of the economic payoff. There are three principal 
reasons why people might prefer a worse economic payoff: concerns about fair-
ness, bounded rationality, and risk aversion
Concerns About Fairness In social situations, people often care about fair-
ness as well as about the economic payoff to themselves. For example, no law 
requires you to tip a waiter or waitress. But concern for fairness leads most 
people to leave a tip (unless they’ve had outrageously bad service) because a 
tip is seen as fair compensation for good service according to society’s norms. 
Tippers are reducing their own economic payoff in order to be fair to waiters and 
waitresses. A related behavior is gift-giving: if you care about another person’s 
welfare, it’s rational for you to lower your own economic payoff in order to give 
that person a gift.
Bounded Rationality Being an economic computing machine—choosing 
the option that gives you the best economic payoff—can require a fair amount 
of work: sizing up the options, computing the opportunity costs, calculating 
the marginal amounts, and so on. The mental effort required has its own 
opportunity cost. This realization led economists to the concept of bounded 
rationality—making a choice that is close to but not exactly the one that leads 
to the highest possible profit because the effort of finding the best payoff is 
too costly. In other words, bounded rationality is the “good enough” method of 
decision making. 
Retailers are particularly good at exploiting their customers’ tendency to engage 
in bounded rationality. For example, pricing items in units ending in 99¢ takes 
advantage of shoppers’ tendency to interpret an item that costs, say, $2.99 as sig-
nificantly cheaper than one that costs $3.00. Bounded rationality leads them to give 
more weight to the $2 part of the price (the first number they see) than the 99¢ part. 
Risk Aversion Because life is uncertain and the future unknown, sometimes 
a choice comes with significant risk. Although you may receive a high payoff if 
things turn out well, the possibility also exists that things may turn out badly and 
leave you worse off. So even if you think a choice will give you the best payoff of 
all your available options, you may forgo it because you find the possibility that 
things could turn out badly too, well, risky. This is called risk aversion—the 
willingness to sacrifice some potential economic payoff in order to avoid a poten-
tial loss. (We’ll discuss risk aversion in more detail in Chapter 20.) Because risk 
makes most people uncomfortable, it’s rational for them to give up some potential 
economic gain in order to avoid it. In fact, if it weren’t for risk aversion, there 
would be no such thing as insurance. 
Irrationality: An Economist’s View
Sometimes, though, instead of being rational, people are irrational—they make 
choices that leave them worse off in terms of economic payoff and other consid-
erations like fairness than if they had chosen another available option. Is there 
anything systematic that economists and psychologists can say 
about economically irrational behavior? Yes, because most peo-
ple are irrational in predictable ways. People’s irrational behavior 
typically stems from six mistakes they make when thinking about 
economic decisions. The mistakes are listed in Table 9-7, and we 
will discuss each in turn.
Misperceptions of Opportunity Costs As we discussed at 
the beginning of this chapter, people tend to ignore nonmonetary 
opportunity costs—opportunity costs that don’t involve an outlay 
of cash. Likewise, a misperception of what exactly constitutes an 
A decision maker operating with 
bounded rationality makes a 
choice that is close to but not 
exactly the one that leads to the best 
possible economic outcome. 
Risk aversion is the willingness to 
sacrifice some economic payoff in 
order to avoid a potential loss.
An irrational decision maker 
chooses an option that leaves him or 
her worse off than choosing another 
available option.

opportunity cost (and what does not) is at the root of the tendency to count sunk 
costs in one’s decision making. In this case, someone takes an opportunity cost 
into account when none actually exists.
Overconfidence It’s a function of ego: we tend to think we know more 
than we actually do. And even if alerted to how widespread overconfidence 
is, people tend to think that it’s someone else’s problem, not theirs. (Certainly 
not yours or mine!) For example, a 1994 study asked students to estimate how 
long it would take them to complete their thesis “if everything went as well as 
it possibly could” and “if everything went as poorly as it possibly could.” The 
results: the typical student thought it would take him or her 33.9 days to finish, 
with an average estimate of 27.4 days if everything went well and 48.6 days if 
everything went poorly. In fact, the average time it took to complete a thesis 
was much longer, 55.5 days. Students were, on average, from 14% to 102% more 
confident than they should have been about the time it would take to complete 
their thesis. 
As you can see in the nearby For Inquiring Minds, overconfidence can cause 
probems with meeting deadlines. But it can cause far more trouble by having 
a strong adverse effect on people’s financial health. Overconfidence often per-
suades people that they are in better financial shape than they actually are. It can 
also lead to bad investment and spending decisions. For example, nonprofessional 
investors who engage in a lot of speculative investing—such as quickly buying and 
selling stocks—on average have significantly worse results than professional bro-
kers because of their misguided faith in their ability to spot a winner. Similarly, 
overconfidence can lead people to make a large spending decision, such as buying 
Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology 
and behavioral economics, likes to do 
experiments with his students that help 
him explore the nature of irrationality. In his 
book Predictably Irrational, Ariely describes 
an experiment that gets to the heart of pro-
crastination and ways to address it.
At the time, Ariely was teaching the 
same subject matter to three different 
classes, but he gave each class differ-
ent assignment schedules. The grade 
in all three classes was based on three 
equally weighted papers. 
Students in the first class were 
required to choose their own personal 
deadlines for submitting each paper. 
Once set, the deadlines could not be 
changed. Late papers would be penal-
ized at the rate of 1% of the grade for 
each day late. Papers could be turned in 
early without penalty but also without any 
advantage, since Ariely would not grade 
papers until the end of the semester.
Students in the second class could 
turn in the three papers whenever they 
wanted, with no preset deadlines, as 
long as it was before the end of the 
term. Again, there would be no benefit 
for early submission. 
Students in the third class faced what 
Ariely called the “dictatorial treatment.” He 
established three hard deadlines at the 
fourth, eighth, and twelfth weeks. 
So which classes do you think 
achieved the best and the worst grades? 
As it turned out, the class with the least 
flexible deadlines—the one that received 
the dictatorial treatment—got the best 
grades. The class with complete flex-
ibility got the worst grades. And the 
class that got to choose its deadlines 
performed in the middle. 
Ariely learned two simple things about 
overconfidence from these results. 
First—no surprise—students tend to 
procrastinate. Second, hard, equally 
spaced deadlines are the best cure for 
procrastination. 
But the biggest revelation came from 
the class that set its own deadlines. The 
majority of those students spaced their 
deadlines far apart and got grades as 
good as those of the students under the 
dictatorial treatment. Some, however, 
did not space their deadlines far enough 
apart, and a few did not space them out 
at all. These last two groups did less 
well, putting the average of the entire 
class below the average of the class 
with the least flexibility. As Ariely notes, 
without well-spaced deadlines, students 
procrastinate and the quality of their 
work suffers.
This experiment provides two impor-
tant insights:
 
1. People who acknowledge their 
tendency to procrastinate are more 
likely to use tools for committing to 
a path of action. 
 
2. Providing those tools allows peo-
ple to make themselves better off. 
If you have a problem with procrastination, 
hard deadlines, as irksome as they may 
be, are truly for your own good.

a car, without doing research on the pros and cons, relying instead on anecdotal 
evidence. Even worse, people tend to remain overconfident because they remem-
ber their successes, and explain away or forget their failures. 
Unrealistic Expectations About Future Behavior Another form of 
overconfidence is being overly optimistic about your future behavior: tomor-
row you’ll study, tomorrow you’ll give up ice cream, tomorrow you’ll spend 
less and save more, and so on. Of course, as we all know, when tomorrow 
arrives, it’s still just as hard to study or give up something that you like as it 
is right now. 
Strategies that keep a person on the straight-and-narrow over time are 
often, at their root, ways to deal with the problem of unrealistic expectations 
about one’s future behavior. Examples are automatic payroll deduction sav-
ings plans, diet plans with prepackaged foods, and mandatory attendance at 
study groups. By providing a way for someone to commit today to an action 
tomorrow, such plans counteract the habit of pushing difficult actions off into 
the future. 
Counting Dollars Unequally If you tend to spend more when you pay 
with a credit card than when you pay with cash, particularly if you tend to 
splurge, then you are very likely engaging in mental accounting. This is the 
habit of mentally assigning dollars to different accounts, making some dol-
lars worth more than others. By spending more with a credit card, you are 
in effect treating dollars in your wallet as more valuable than dollars on your 
credit card balance, although in reality they count equally in your budget. 
Credit card overuse is the most recognizable form of mental accounting. 
However, there are other forms as well, such as splurging after receiving a 
windfall, like an unexpected inheritance, or overspending at sales, buying 
something that seemed like a great bargain at the time whose purchase you 
later regretted. It’s the failure to understand that, regardless of the form it 
comes in, a dollar is a dollar.
Loss Aversion Loss aversion is an oversensitivity to loss, leading to an 
unwillingness to recognize a loss and move on. In fact, in the lingo of the 
financial markets, “selling discipline”—being able and willing to quickly 
acknowledge when a stock you’ve bought is a loser and sell it—is a highly desir-
able trait to have. Many investors, though, are reluctant to acknowledge that 
they’ve lost money on a stock and won’t make it back. Although it’s rational 
to sell the stock at that point and redeploy the remaining funds, most people 
find it so painful to admit a loss that they avoid selling for much longer than 
they should. According to Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, most people 
feel the misery of losing $100 about twice as keenly as they feel the pleasure 
of gaining $100. 
Loss aversion can help explain why sunk costs are so hard to ignore: ignor-
ing a sunk cost means recognizing that the money you spent is unrecoverable 
and therefore lost. 
Status Quo Bias Another irrational behavior is status quo bias, the tenden-
cy to avoid making a decision altogether. A well-known example is the way that 
employees make decisions about investing in their employer-directed retirement 
accounts, known as a 401(k)s. With a 401(k), employees can, through payroll 
deductions, set aside part of their salary tax-free, a practice that saves a sig-
nificant amount of money every year in taxes. Some companies operate on an 
opt-in basis: employees have to actively choose to participate in a 401(k). Other 
companies operate on an opt-out basis: employees are automatically enrolled in 
a 401(k) unless they choose to opt out. 
Mental accounting is the habit of 
mentally assigning dollars to different 
accounts so that some dollars are 
worth more than others. 
Loss aversion is an oversensitivity 
to loss, leading to unwillingness to 
recognize a loss and move on.
The status quo bias is the 
tendency to avoid making a decision 
and sticking with the status quo.

262    P A R T  4    EC O N O M I C S  A N D  D EC I S I O N  M A K I N G
If everyone behaved rationally, then the proportion of employees enrolled in 
401(k) accounts at opt-in companies would be roughly equal to the proportion 
enrolled at opt-out companies. In other words, your decision about whether to 
participate in a 401(k) should be independent of the default choice at your com-
pany. But, in reality, when companies switch to automatic enrollment and an 
opt-out system, employee enrollment rises dramatically. Clearly, people tend to 
just go with the status quo. 
Why do people exhibit status quo bias? Some claim it’s a form of “decision 
paralysis”: when given many options, people find it harder to make a decision. 
Others claim it’s due to loss aversion and the fear of regret, to thinking that “if I 
do nothing, then I won’t have to regret my choice.” Irrational, yes. But not alto-
gether surprising. However, rational people know that, in the end, the act of not 
making a choice is still a choice. 
Rational Models for Irrational People?
So why do economists still use models based on rational behavior when people 
are at times manifestly irrational? For one thing, models based on rational behav-
ior still provide robust predictions about how people behave in most markets. For 
example, the great majority of farmers will use less fertilizer when it becomes 
more expensive—a result consistent with rational behavior. 
Another explanation is that sometimes market forces can compel people to 
behave more rationally over time. For example, if you are a small-business owner 
who persistently exaggerates your abilities or refuses to acknowledge that your 
favorite line of items is a loser, then sooner or later you will be out of business 
unless you learn to correct your mistakes. As a result, it is reasonable to assume 
that when people are disciplined for their mistakes, as happens in most markets, 
rationality will win out over time. 
Finally, economists depend on the assumption of rationality for the simple 
but fundamental reason that it makes modeling so much simpler. Remember 
that models are built on generalizations, and it’s much harder to extrapolate from 
messy, irrational behavior. Even behavioral economists, in their research, search 
for predictably irrational behavior in an attempt to build better models of how 
people behave. Clearly, there is an ongoing dialogue between behavioral econo-
mists and the rest of the economics profession, and economics itself has been 
irrevocably changed by it. 
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
“THE JINGLE MAIL BLUES”
I
t’s called jingle mail—when a homeowner seals the keys to his or her house 
in an envelope and leaves them with the bank that holds the mortgage on 
the house. (A mortgage is a loan taken out to buy a house.) By leaving the keys 
with the bank, the homeowner is walking away not only from the house but 
also from the obligation to continue paying the mortgage. And to their great 
consternation, banks have lately been flooded with jingle mail.
To default on a mortgage—that is, to walk away from one’s obligation to 
repay the loan and lose the house to the bank in the process—used to be a 
fairly rare phenomenon. For decades, continually rising home values made 
homeownership a good investment for the typical household. In recent years, 
though, an entirely different phenomenon—called “strategic default”—has 
appeared. In a strategic default, a homeowner who is financially capable of 
paying the mortgage instead chooses not to, voluntarily walking away. Strategic 
defaults account for a significant proportion of jingle mail; in March 2010, they 
accounted for 31% of all foreclosures, up from 22% in 2009. And there is little

indication that number will change dramatically: in the 
spring of 2011, strategic defaults still accounted for 30% 
of all defaults.
What happened? The Great American Housing Bust 
happened. After decades of huge increases, house prices 
began a precipitous fall in 2008. Prices dropped so much 
that a significant proportion of homeowners found their 
homes “underwater”—they owed more on their homes 
than the homes were worth. And with house prices 
projected to stay depressed for several years, possibly a 
decade, there appeared to be little chance that an under-
water house would recover its value enough in the fore-
seeable future to move “abovewater.” 
Many homeowners suffered a major loss. They 
lost their down payment, money spent on repairs and 
renovation, moving expenses, and so on. And because 
they were paying a mortgage that was greater than the 
house was now worth, they found they could rent a 
comparable dwelling for less than their monthly mortgage payments. In the 
words of Benjamin Koellmann, who paid $215,000 for an apartment in Miami 
where similar units were now selling for $90,000, “There is no financial sense 
in staying.”
Realizing their losses were sunk costs, underwater homeowners walked away. 
Perhaps they hadn’t made the best economic decision when purchasing their 
houses, but in leaving them showed impeccable economic logic.

 Quick Review
• Behavioral economics combines 
economic modeling with insights 
from human psychology.
• Rational behavior leads to the 
outcome a person most prefers. 
Bounded rationality, risk aversion, 
and concerns about fairness are rea-
sons why people might prefer out-
comes with worse economic payoffs.
• Irrational behavior occurs because 
of misperceptions of opportunity 
costs, overconfidence, mental 
accounting, and unrealistic expec-
tations about the future. Loss aver-
sion and status quo bias can also 
lead to choices that leave people 
worse off than they would be if they 
chose another available option.

In late 2010, Citi, a global financial services company with 200 million customers 
in 160 countries, became the first American company to introduce MasterCards 
with a special set of features known as inControl. Previously introduced in the 
United Kingdom by Barclays Bank, inControl cards contain budgeting and alert 
features that help credit card holders stay within their spending limits and pre-
vent credit card fraud. With inControl, card holders can do the following:
 • Set up and manage spending limits 
 • Set up budgets for particular types of spending
 • Manage where, when, how, and for what types of purchases their credit cards 
can be used
 • Receive alerts, via text or e-mail, to safeguard against overspending and fraud
Users can customize their cards, choosing to receive alerts only when they are 
exceeding their limits or to have a card declined when a limit is breached. So, 
for example, if you choose the latter and have set a monthly limit on restaurant 
meals, your card will be rejected for restaurant bills above your pre-set cap. Card 
holders can also arrange to have their credit cards shut off once a limit is reached 
that corresponds to monthly disposable income. 
inControl is not the first product that alerts card holders when they have 
exceeded their limit. Mint.com offers such a service, but you have to log into 
your bank’s website to retrieve updates, and those sites are updated only every 
24 hours. In contrast, alerts from inControl happen in real time. Until inCon-
trol was introduced, no other product allowed you to completely cut off certain 
types of spending. “The personalization of consumer products has reached far 
deeper than it ever has before,” says Ed McLaughlin, chief payments officer of 
MasterCard. 
But what about the obvious question of whether credit card companies are 
hurting or helping themselves by introducing this product? After all, if consumers 
get serious about budgeting and place caps on their credit card spending, won’t 
that reduce the interest that credit card companies profit from? In answer to this 
question, McLaughlin replied, “I think anyone knows that having a superior offer-
ing wins out in the long run.” 
The service, though, is not iron-clad—having hit the self-imposed limit, a 
customer can turn the card back on with a phone call or text message. The think-
ing goes, however, that having your card rejected will make a significant enough 
impression to put a damper on your urge to splurge. 
In the end, how well inControl does, and whether something like it is adopted 
by competitors like VISA, depends on whether customers actually use the service 
and how much customers’ newfound discipline hurts credit card companies’ bot-
tom lines.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. What aspects of decision making does the inControl card address? Be specific.
 2. Consider credit scores, the scores assigned to individuals by credit-rating agencies, 
based on whether you pay your bills on time, how many credit cards you have (too many is 
a bad sign), whether you have ever declared bankruptcy, and so on. Now consider people 
who choose inControl cards and those who don’t. Which group do you think has better 
credit scores before they adopt the inControl cards? After adopting the inControl cards? 
Explain.
 3. What do you think explains Ed McLaughlin’s optimism that his company will profit from the 
introduction of inControl?

SUMMARY
 1. All economic decisions involve the allocation of scarce 
resources. Some decisions are “either–or” decisions, in 
which the question is whether or not to do something. 
Other decisions are “how much” decisions, in which 
the question is how much of a resource to put into a 
given activity.
 2. The cost of using a resource for a particular activity 
is the opportunity cost of that resource. Some oppor-
tunity costs are explicit costs; they involve a direct 
outlay of money. Other opportunity costs, however, are 
implicit costs; they involve no outlay of money but 
are measured by the dollar value of the benefits that 
are forgone. Both explicit and implicit costs should be 
taken into account in making decisions. Many deci-
sions involve the use of capital and time, for both 
individuals and firms. So they should base decisions 
on economic profit, which takes into account implicit 
costs such as the opportunity cost of time and the 
implicit cost of capital. Making decisions based on 
accounting profit can be misleading. It is often con-
siderably larger than the economic profit because it 
includes only explicit costs and not implicit costs.
 3. According to the principle of “either–or” deci-
sion making, when faced with an “either–or” choice 
between two activities, one should choose the activity 
with the positive economic profit.
 4. A “how much” decision is made using marginal analy-
sis, which involves comparing the benefit to the cost of 
doing an additional unit of an activity. The marginal 
cost of producing a good or service is the additional cost 
incurred by producing one more unit of that good or 
service. The marginal benefit of producing a good or 
service is the additional benefit earned by producing one 
more unit. The marginal cost curve is the graphical 
illustration of marginal cost, and the marginal benefit 
curve is the graphical illustration of marginal benefit.
 5. In the case of constant marginal cost, each addi-
tional unit costs the same amount to produce as the 
previous unit. However, marginal cost and marginal 
benefit typically depend on how much of the activity 
has already been done. With increasing marginal 
cost, each unit costs more to produce than the previ-
ous unit and is represented by an upward-sloping mar-
ginal cost curve. With decreasing marginal cost, 
each unit costs less to produce than the previous unit, 
leading to a downward-sloping marginal cost curve. 
In the case of decreasing marginal benefit, each 
additional unit produces a smaller benefit than the 
unit before.
 6. The optimal quantity is the quantity that gener-
ates the highest possible total profit. According to the 
profit-maximizing principle of marginal analysis, 
the optimal quantity is the quantity at which marginal 
benefit is greater than or equal to marginal cost. It is 
the quantity at which the marginal cost curve and the 
marginal benefit curve intersect.
 7. A cost that has already been incurred and that is 
nonrecoverable is a sunk cost. Sunk costs should be 
ignored in decisions about future actions because they 
have no effect on future benefits and costs.
 8. With rational behavior, individuals will choose 
the available option that leads to the outcome they 
most prefer. Bounded rationality occurs because the 
effort needed to find the best economic payoff is costly. 
Risk aversion causes individuals to sacrifice some 
economic payoff in order to avoid a potential loss. 
People might also prefer outcomes with worse econom-
ic payoffs because they are concerned about fairness.
 9. An irrational choice leaves someone worse off than if 
they had chosen another available option. It takes the 
form of misperceptions of opportunity cost; overcon-
fidence; unrealistic expectations about future behav-
ior; mental accounting, in which dollars are valued 
unequally; loss aversion, an oversensitivity to loss; 
and status quo bias, avoiding a decision by sticking 
with the status quo.

 a. What is Hiro’s accounting profit?
 b. What is Hiro’s economic profit?
 c. Should Hiro continue working as a consultant, or 
should he teach economics instead?
 2. Jackie owns and operates a web-design business. To 
keep up with new technology, she spends $5,000 per 
year upgrading her computer equipment. She runs the 
business out of a room in her home. If she didn’t use 
the room as her business office, she could rent it out 
for $2,000 per year. Jackie knows that if she didn’t run 
her own business, she could return to her previous job 
at a large software company that would pay her a sal-
ary of $60,000 per year. Jackie has no other expenses.
 a. How much total revenue does Jackie need to make 
in order to break even in the eyes of her accountant? 
That is, how much total revenue would give Jackie 
an accounting profit of just zero?
 b. How much total revenue does Jackie need to make 
in order for her to want to remain self-employed? 
That is, how much total revenue would give Jackie 
an economic profit of just zero?
 3. You own and operate a bike store. Each year, you 
receive revenue of $200,000 from your bike sales, and it 
costs you $100,000 to obtain the bikes. In addition, you 
pay $20,000 for electricity, taxes, and other expenses 
per year. Instead of running the bike store, you could 
become an accountant and receive a yearly salary of 
$40,000. A large clothing retail chain wants to expand 
and offers to rent the store from you for $50,000 per 
year. How do you explain to your friends that despite 
making a profit, it is too costly for you to continue run-
ning your store?
 4. Suppose you have just paid a nonrefundable fee of 
$1,000 for your meal plan for this academic term. This 
allows you to eat dinner in the cafeteria every evening.
 a. You are offered a part-time job in a restaurant 
where you can eat for free each evening. Your par-
ents say that you should eat dinner in the cafete-
ria anyway, since you have already paid for those 
meals. Are your parents right? Explain why or 
why not.
 b. You are offered a part-time job in a different 
restaurant where, rather than being able to eat 
for free, you receive only a large discount on 
your meals. Each meal there will cost you $2; 
if you eat there each evening this semester, it 
will add up to $200. Your roommate says that 
you should eat in the restaurant since it costs 
less than the $1,000 that you paid for the meal 
plan. Is your roommate right? Explain why or 
why not.
 5. You have bought a $10 ticket in advance for the col-
lege soccer game, a ticket that cannot be resold. You 
know that going to the soccer game will give you a 
benefit equal to $20. After you have bought the ticket, 
you hear that there will be a professional baseball 
post-season game at the same time. Tickets to the 
baseball game cost $20, and you know that going to 
the baseball game will give you a benefit equal to $35. 
You tell your friends the following: “If I had known 
about the baseball game before buying the ticket to 
the soccer game, I would have gone to the baseball 
game instead. But now that I already have the ticket 
to the soccer game, it’s better for me to just go to the 
soccer game.” Are you making the correct decision? 
Justify your answer by calculating the benefits and 
costs of your decision.

 7. You are the manager of a gym, and you have to decide 
how many customers to admit each hour. Assume 
that each customer stays exactly one hour. Customers 
are costly to admit because they inflict wear and tear 
on the exercise equipment. Moreover, each additional 
customer generates more wear and tear than the cus-
tomer before. As a result, the gym faces increasing 
marginal cost. The accompanying table shows the 
marginal costs associated with each number of cus-
tomers per hour.

 a. Kookie’s best friend likes to give her gift cards that 
Kookie can use at her favorite stores. Kookie, how-
ever, often forgets to use the cards before their expi-
ration date or loses them. Kookie, though, is careful 
with her own cash.
 b. In May 2010, the Panera Bread company opened 
a store in Clayton, Missouri, that allows custom-
ers to pay any amount they like for their orders; 
instead of prices, the store lists suggested dona-
tions based on the cost of the goods. All profits go 
to a charitable foundation set up by Panera. As of 
May 2011, the store was pleased with the success 
of the program. 
 c. Rick has just gotten his teaching degree and has 
two job offers. One job, replacing a teacher who 
has gone on leave, will last only two years. It is 
at a prestigious high school, and he will be paid 
$35,000 per year. He thinks he will probably be 
able to find another good job in the area after 
the two years are up but isn’t sure. The other job, 
also at a high school, pays $25,000 per year and 
is virtually guaranteed for five years; after those 
five years, he will be evaluated for a permanent 
teaching position at the school. About 75% of the 
teachers who start at the school are hired for per-
manent positions. Rick takes the five-year position 
at $25,000 per year. 
 d. Kimora has planned a trip to Florida during spring 
break in March. She has several school projects due 
after her return. Rather than do them in February, 
she figures she can take her books with her to 
Florida and complete her projects there.
 e. Sahir overpaid when buying a used car that has 
turned out to be a lemon. He could sell it for 
parts, but instead he lets it sit in his garage and 
deteriorate. 
 f. Barry considers himself an excellent investor in 
stocks. He selects new stocks by finding ones with 
characteristics similar to those of his previous win-
ning stocks. He chocks up losing trades to ups and 
downs in the macroeconomy.

ESTAURANTS OCCASIONALLY
offer “all - you - can - eat” specials to 
entice customers: all - you - can - eat salad 
bars, all - you - can - eat breakfast buffets, 
and all - you - can - eat fried - clam dinners.
But how can a restaurant owner who 
offers such a special be sure he won’t 
be eaten out of business? If he charges 
$12.99 for an all - you - can - eat clam din-
ner, what prevents his average customer 
from wolfing down $30 worth of clams?
The answer is that even though 
every once in a while you see someone 
really take advantage of the offer—
heaping a plate high with 30 or 40 fried 
clams—it’s a rare occurrence. And even 
those of us who like fried clams shud-
der a bit at the sight. Five or even 10 
fried clams can be a treat, but 30 clams 
is ridiculous. Anyone who pays for an 
all-you - can - eat meal wants to make the 
most of it, but a sensible person knows 
when one more clam would be one clam 
too many.
Notice that last sentence. We said 
that customers in a restaurant want 
to “make the most” of their meal; that 
sounds as if they are trying to maximize 
something. And we also said that they 
will stop when consuming one more 
clam would be a mistake; that sounds as 
if they are making a marginal decision.
The answer is yes, it is a matter 
of taste—and economists can’t say 
much about where tastes come from. 
But economists can say a lot about how 
a rational individual goes about sat-
isfying his or her tastes. And that is 
in fact the way that economists think 
about consumer choice. They work 
with a model of a rational consumer—a 
consumer who knows what he or she 
wants and makes the most of the avail-
able opportunities.
In this chapter, we will show how 
to analyze the decisions of a rational 
consumer. We will begin by showing 
how the concept of utility—a measure 
of consumer satisfaction—allows us 
to begin thinking about rational con-
sumer choice. We will then look at how 
budget constraints determine what a 
consumer can buy and how marginal 
analysis can be used to determine the 
consumption choice that maximizes 
utility. Finally, we will see how this 
analysis can be used to understand the 
law of demand and why the demand 
curve slopes downward.
For those interested in a more detailed 
treatment of consumer behavior and 
coverage of indifference curves, see the 
appendix that follows this chapter.

Utility: Getting Satisfaction
W
hen analyzing consumer behavior, we’re talking about people trying to 
get satisfaction—that is, about subjective feelings. Yet there is no simple 
way to measure subjective feelings. How much satisfaction do I get from 
my third fried clam? Is it less or more than yours? Does it even make sense to ask 
the question?
Luckily, we don’t need to make comparisons between your feelings and mine. 
All that is required to analyze consumer behavior is to suppose that each individ-
ual is trying to maximize some personal measure of the satisfaction gained from 
consumption of goods and services. That measure is known as the consumer’s 
utility, a concept we use to understand behavior but don’t expect to measure in 
practice. Nonetheless, we’ll see that the assumption that consumers maximize 
utility helps us think clearly about consumer choice.
Utility and Consumption
An individual’s utility depends on everything that individual consumes, from 
apples to Ziploc bags. The set of all the goods and services an individual con-
sumes is known as the individual’s consumption bundle. The relationship 
between an individual’s consumption bundle and the total amount of utility it 
generates for that individual is known as the utility function. The utility func-
tion is a personal matter; two people with different tastes will have different util-
ity functions. Someone who actually likes to consume 40 fried clams at a sitting 
must have a utility function that looks different from that of someone who would 
rather stop at 5 clams.
So we can think of consumers as using consumption to “produce” utility, 
much in the same way as in later chapters we will think of producers as using 
inputs to produce output. However, it’s obvious that people do not have a little 
computer in their heads that calculates the utility generated by their consumption 
choices. Nonetheless, people must make choices, and they usually base them on at 
least a rough attempt to decide which choice will give them greater satisfaction. 
I can have either soup or salad with my dinner. Which will I enjoy more? I can 
go to Disney World this year or save the money toward buying a new car. Which 
will make me happier?
The concept of a utility function is just a way of representing the fact that 
when people consume, they take into account their preferences and tastes in a 
more or less rational way.
How do we measure utility? For the sake of simplicity, it is useful to suppose 
that we can measure utility in hypothetical units called—what else?—utils.
Figure 10-1 illustrates a utility function. It shows the total utility that Cassie, 
who likes fried clams, gets from an all - you - can - eat clam dinner. We suppose that 
her consumption bundle consists of a side of coleslaw, which comes with the 
meal, plus a number of clams to be determined. The table that accompanies the 
figure shows how Cassie’s total utility depends on the number of clams; the curve 
in panel (a) of the figure shows that same information graphically.
Cassie’s utility function slopes upward over most of the range shown, but it 
gets flatter as the number of clams consumed increases. And in this example 
it eventually turns downward. According to the information in the table in 
Figure 10-1, nine clams is a clam too far. Adding that additional clam actually 
makes Cassie worse off: it would lower her total utility. If she’s rational, of 
course, Cassie will realize that and not consume the ninth clam.
So when Cassie chooses how many clams to consume, she will make this 
decision by considering the change in her total utility from consuming one more 
clam. This illustrates the general point: to maximize total utility, consumers must 
focus on marginal utility.
The utility of a consumer is a 
measure of the satisfaction the 
consumer derives from consumption 
of goods and services.
An individual’s consumption 
bundle is the collection of all the 
goods and services consumed by 
that individual.
An individual’s utility function 
gives the total utility generated by his 
or her consumption bundle.
A util is a unit of utility.

The Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility
In addition to showing how Cassie’s total utility depends on the number of clams 
she consumes, the table in Figure 10-1 also shows the marginal utility generated 
by consuming each additional clam—that is, the change in total utility from con-
suming one additional clam. Panel (b) shows the implied marginal utility curve. 
Following our practice in Chapter 9 with the marginal benefit curve, the marginal 
utility curve is constructed by plotting points at the midpoint of the unit intervals.
The marginal utility curve slopes downward: each successive clam adds less to 
total utility than the previous clam. This is reflected in the table: marginal utility 
falls from a high of 15 utils for the first clam consumed to −1 for the ninth clam 
consumed. The fact that the ninth clam has negative marginal utility means that 
consuming it actually reduces total utility. (Restaurants that offer all - you - can - eat 
meals depend on the proposition that you can have too much of a good thing.) 
Not all marginal utility curves eventually become negative. But it is generally 
Cassie’s Total Utility and Marginal Utility
10-1
Panel (a) shows how Cassie’s total 
utility depends on her consumption of 
fried clams. It increases until it reaches 
its maximum utility level of 64 utils at 8 
clams consumed and decreases after 
that. Marginal utility is calculated in the 
table. Panel (b) shows the marginal utility 
curve, which slopes downward due to 
diminishing marginal utility. That is, each 
additional clam gives Cassie less utility 
than the previous clam.

FIGURE
The marginal utility of a good 
or service is the change in total 
utility generated by consuming 
one additional unit of that good or 
service. The marginal utility curve 
shows how marginal utility depends 
on the quantity of a good or service 
consumed.

272    P A R T  5    T H E C O N S U M E R
accepted that marginal utility curves do slope downward—that consumption of 
most goods and services is subject to diminishing marginal utility.
The basic idea behind the principle of diminishing marginal utility is 
that the additional satisfaction a consumer gets from one more unit of a good or 
service declines as the amount of that good or service consumed rises. Or, to put 
it slightly differently, the more of a good or service you consume, the closer you 
are to being satiated—reaching a point at which an additional unit of the good 
adds nothing to your satisfaction. For someone who almost never gets to eat a 
banana, the occasional banana is a marvelous treat. (This was the case in Eastern 
Europe before the fall of communism, when bananas were very hard to find.) For 
someone who eats them all the time, a banana is just, well, a banana.
The principle of diminishing marginal utility isn’t always true. But it is true 
in the great majority of cases, enough to serve as a foundation for our analysis of 
consumer behavior.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
OYSTERS VERSUS CHICKEN
I
s a particular food a special treat, something you consume on special occa-
sions? Or is it an ordinary, take - it - or - leave - it dish? The answer depends a lot on 
how much of that food people normally consume, which determines how much 
utility they get at the margin from having a bit more.
Consider chicken. Modern Americans eat a lot of chicken, 
so much that they regard it as nothing special. Yet this was 
not always the case. Traditionally chicken was a luxury dish 
because chickens were expensive to raise. Restaurant menus 
from two centuries ago show chicken dishes as the most expen-
sive items listed. As recently as 1928, Herbert Hoover ran for 
president on the slogan “A chicken in every pot,” a promise to 
voters of great prosperity if he was elected.
What changed the status of chicken was the emergence of 
new, technologically advanced methods for raising and process-
ing the birds. (You don’t want to know.) These methods made 
chicken abundant, cheap, and also—thanks to the principle of 
diminishing marginal utility—nothing to get excited about.
Are all goods really subject to diminish-
ing marginal utility? Of course not; there 
are a number of goods for which, at 
least over some range, marginal utility is 
surely increasing.
For example, there are goods that 
require some experience to enjoy. The 
first time you do it, downhill skiing 
involves a lot more fear than enjoyment—
or so they say: the authors have never 
tried it! It only becomes a pleasurable 
activity if you do it enough to become 
reasonably competent. And even some 
less strenuous forms of consump-
tion take practice; people who are not 
accustomed to drinking coffee say it 
has a bitter taste and can’t understand 
its appeal. (The authors, on the other 
hand, regard coffee as one of the basic 
food groups.)
Another example would be goods 
that only deliver positive utility if you 
buy enough. The great Victorian econ-
omist Alfred Marshall, who more or 
less invented the supply and demand 
model, gave the example of wallpaper: 
buying only enough to do half a room 
is worse than useless. If you need two 
rolls of wallpaper to finish a room, the 
marginal utility of the second roll is 
larger than the marginal utility of the 
first roll.
So why does it make sense to 
assume diminishing marginal utility? 
For one thing, most goods don’t suf-
fer from these qualifications: nobody 
needs to learn to like ice cream. Also, 
although most people don’t ski and 
some people don’t drink coffee, those 
who do ski or drink coffee do enough 
of it that the marginal utility of one 
more ski run or one more cup is less 
than that of the last. So in the relevant 
range of consumption, marginal utility 
is still diminishing.

How much utility would you get from eating one more oyster?
Kim Steele/Getty Images
According to the principle of 
diminishing marginal utility, each 
successive unit of a good or service 
consumed adds less to total utility 
than the previous unit.

The reverse evolution took place for oysters. Not everyone likes oysters or, 
for that matter, has ever tried them—they are definitely not ordinary food. But 
they are regarded as a delicacy by some; at restaurants that serve them, an oyster 
appetizer often costs more than the main course.
Yet oysters were once very cheap and abundant—and were regarded as pov-
erty food. In The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, published in the 1830s, the 
author remarks that “poverty and oysters always seem to go together.”
What changed? Pollution, which destroyed many oyster beds, greatly reduced 
the supply, while human population growth greatly increased the demand. As 
a result, thanks to the principle of diminishing marginal utility, oysters went 
from being a common food, regarded as nothing special, to being a highly prized 
luxury good.
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
10-1
1. Explain why a rational consumer who has diminishing marginal utility for a good would 
not consume an additional unit when it generates negative marginal utility, even when 
that unit is free.
2.  Marta drinks three cups of coffee a day, for which she has diminishing marginal utility. 
Which of her three cups generates the greatest increase in total utility? Which gener-
ates the least?
3.  In each of the following cases, does the consumer have diminishing, constant, or 
increasing marginal utility? Explain your answers.
a.  The more Mabel exercises, the more she enjoys each additional visit to the gym.
b.  Although Mei’s classical CD collection is huge, her enjoyment from buying another 
CD has not changed as her collection has grown.
c.  When Dexter was a struggling student, his enjoyment from a good restaurant meal 
was greater than now, when he has them more frequently.
Solutions appear at back of book.
Budgets and Optimal Consumption
T
he principle of diminishing marginal utility explains why most people 
eventually reach a limit, even at an all - you - can - eat buffet where the cost 
of another clam is measured only in future indigestion. Under ordinary 
circumstances, however, it costs some additional resources to consume more of 
a good, and consumers must take that cost into account when making choices.
What do we mean by cost? As always, the fundamental measure of cost is 
opportunity cost. Because the amount of money a consumer can spend is limited, 
a decision to consume more of one good is also a decision to consume less of 
some other good.
Budget Constraints and Budget Lines
Consider Sammy, whose appetite is exclusively for clams and potatoes (there’s 
no accounting for tastes). He has a weekly income of $20 and since, given his 
appetite, more of either good is better than less, he spends all of it on clams and 
potatoes. We will assume that clams cost $4 per pound and potatoes cost $2 per 
pound. What are his possible choices?
Whatever Sammy chooses, we know that the cost of his consumption bundle 
cannot exceed his income, the amount of money he has to spend. That is,
(10-1) Expenditure on clams + Expenditure on potatoes ≤ Total income 
 Quick Review
• Utility is a measure of a con-
sumer’s satisfaction from consump-
tion, expressed in units of utils. 
Consumers try to maximize their 
utility. A consumer’s utility function 
shows the relationship between the 
consumption bundle and the total 
utility it generates.
• To maximize utility, a consumer 
considers the marginal utility from 
consuming one more unit of a good 
or service, illustrated by the mar-
ginal utility curve.
• In the consumption of most goods 
and services, and for most people, 
the principle of diminishing mar-
ginal utility holds: each successive 
unit consumed adds less to total 
utility than the previous unit.

Consumers always have limited income, which constrains how much they 
can consume. So the requirement illustrated by Equation 10-1—that a con-
sumer must choose a consumption bundle that costs no more than his or her 
income—is known as the consumer’s budget constraint. It’s a simple way 
of saying that a consumer can’t spend more than the total amount of income 
available to him or her. In other words, consumption bundles are afford-
able when they obey the budget constraint. We call the set of all of Sammy’s 
affordable consumption bundles his consumption possibilities. In general, 
whether or not a particular consumption bundle is included in a consumer’s 
consumption possibilities depends on the consumer’s income and the prices 
of goods and services.
Figure 10-2 shows Sammy’s consumption possibilities. The quantity of clams 
in his consumption bundle is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity 
of potatoes on the vertical axis. The downward - sloping line connecting points A 
through F shows which consumption bundles are affordable and which are not. 
Every bundle on or inside this line (the shaded area) is affordable; every bundle 
outside this line is unaffordable. 
As an example of one of the points, let’s look at point C, representing 2 pounds 
of clams and 6 pounds of potatoes, and check whether it satisfies Sammy’s budget 
constraint. The cost of bundle C is 6 pounds of potatoes × $2 per pound + 2 pounds 
of clams × $4 per pound = $12 + $8 = $20. So bundle C does indeed satisfy Sammy’s 
budget constraint: it costs no more than his weekly income of $20. In fact, bundle C 
costs exactly as much as Sammy’s income. By doing the arithmetic, you can check 
that all the other points lying on the downward - sloping line are also bundles at 
which Sammy spends all of his income.
A budget constraint requires 
that the cost of a consumer’s 
consumption bundle be no more 
than the consumer’s income.
A consumer’s consumption 
possibilities is the set of all 
consumption bundles that can be 
consumed given the consumer’s 
income and prevailing prices.

The budget line represents all the possible com-
binations of quantities of potatoes and clams 
that Sammy can purchase if he spends all of his 
income. Also, it is the boundary between the set 
of affordable consumption bundles (the consump-
tion possibilities) and unaffordable ones. Given 
that clams cost $4 per pound and potatoes cost 
$2 per pound, if Sammy spends all of his income 
on clams (bundle F ), he can purchase 5 pounds 
of clams; if he spends all of his income on pota-
toes (bundle A), he can purchase 10 pounds 
of potatoes.

The downward - sloping line has a special name, the budget line. It shows all 
the consumption bundles available to Sammy when he spends all of his income. 
It’s downward sloping because when Sammy is consuming all of his income, say 
consuming at point A on the budget line, then in order to consume more clams he 
must consume fewer potatoes—that is, he must move to a point like B. In other 
words, when Sammy chooses a consumption bundle that is on his budget line, 
the opportunity cost of consuming more clams is consuming fewer potatoes, and 
vice versa. As Figure 10-2 indicates, any consumption bundle that lies above the 
budget line is unaffordable.
Do we need to consider the other bundles in Sammy’s consumption pos-
sibilities, the ones that lie within the shaded region in Figure 10-2 bounded by 
the budget line? The answer is, for all practical situations, no: as long as Sammy 
continues to get positive marginal utility from consuming either good (in other 
words, Sammy doesn’t get satiated)—and he doesn’t get any utility from saving 
income rather than spending it, then he will always choose to consume a bundle 
that lies on his budget line and not within the shaded area.
Given his $20 per week budget, which point on his budget line will Sammy choose?
Optimal Consumption Choice
Because Sammy has a budget constraint, which means that he will consume a 
consumption bundle on the budget line, a choice to consume a given quantity of 
clams also determines his potato consumption, and vice versa. We want to find 
the consumption bundle—the point on the budget line—that maximizes Sammy’s 
total utility. This bundle is Sammy’s optimal consumption bundle, the con-
sumption bundle that maximizes his total utility given the budget constraint.
Table 10-1 shows how much utility Sammy gets from different levels of con-
sumption of clams and potatoes, respectively. According to the table, Sammy has 
a healthy appetite; the more of either good he consumes, the higher his utility.
But because he has a limited budget, he must make a trade - off: the more 
pounds of clams he consumes, the fewer pounds of potatoes, and vice versa. That 
is, he must choose a point on his budget line.
Table 10-2 shows how his total utility varies for the different consumption 
bundles along his budget line. Each of six possible consumption bundles, A through 
F from Figure 10-2, is given in the first column. The second column shows the level 
of clam consumption corresponding to each choice. The third column shows the

A consumer’s budget line shows 
the consumption bundles available to 
a consumer who spends all of his or 
her income.
A consumer’s optimal 
consumption bundle is the 
consumption bundle that maximizes 
the consumer’s total utility given his 
or her budget constraint.

utility Sammy gets from consuming those clams. The fourth column shows the 
quantity of potatoes Sammy can afford given the level of clam consumption; this 
quantity goes down as his clam consumption goes up, because he is sliding down 
the budget line. The fifth column shows the utility he gets from consuming those 
potatoes. And the final column shows his total utility. In this example, Sammy’s 
total utility is the sum of the utility he gets from clams and the utility he gets 
from potatoes.
Figure 10-3 gives a visual representation of the data shown in Table 10-2. Panel 
(a) shows Sammy’s budget line, to remind us that when he decides to consume 
more clams he is also deciding to consume fewer potatoes. Panel (b) then shows 
how his total utility depends on that choice. The horizontal axis in panel (b) has 
two sets of labels: it shows both the quantity of clams, increasing from left to 
right, and the quantity of potatoes, increasing from right to left. The reason we 
can use the same axis to represent consumption of both goods is, of course, the 
budget line: the more pounds of clams Sammy consumes, the fewer pounds of 
potatoes he can afford, and vice versa.
Clearly, the consumption bundle that makes the best of the trade - off between 
clam consumption and potato consumption, the optimal consumption bundle, is 
the one that maximizes Sammy’s total utility. That is, Sammy’s optimal consump-
tion bundle puts him at the highest point of the total utility curve.
As always, we can find the highest point of the curve by direct observa-
tion. We can see from Figure 10-3 that Sammy’s total utility is maximized at 
point C—that his optimal consumption bundle contains 2 pounds of clams 
and 6 pounds of potatoes. But we know that we usually gain more insight into 
“how much” problems when we use marginal analysis. So in the next section 
we turn to representing and solving the optimal consumption choice problem 
with marginal analysis.

Budget constraints aren’t just about 
money. In fact, there are many other 
bud get constraints affecting our lives. 
You face a budget constraint if you have 
a limited amount of closet space for your 
clothes. All of us face a budget con-
straint on time: there are only so many 
hours in the day.
And people trying to lose weight on 
the Weight Watchers plan face a budget 
constraint on the foods they eat.
The Weight Watchers plan assigns 
each food a certain number of “points 
plus.” A 4-ounce scoop of ice cream 
gets 8 points, a slice of pizza 5 points, 
a cup of grapes zero points. You are 
allowed a maximum number of points 
each day but are free to choose which 
foods you eat. In other words, a dieter 
on the Weight Watchers plan is just 
like a consumer choosing a consump-
tion bundle: points are the equivalent of 
prices, and the overall point limit is the 
equivalent of total income.

club sandwich? And sales of salsa in the United States have long since overtaken 
ketchup sales.
So what happened? Tastes changed and budgets changed. With budget-
conscious consumers more likely to eat at home, but having been exposed to 
gourmet cooking and ethnic cuisine, specialty condiments have become an 
affordable way of spicing up home cooking. In 2010, the U.S. condiment market 
was valued at $5.6 billion and projected to grow to $7 billion by 2015, driven by 
demand from mainly 18- to 34-year-olds.
The explosion of varieties stems from the fact that it’s fairly easy to make 
bottled condiments. This enables smaller companies to experiment with exotic 
flavors, finding the ones that appeal to consumers’ increasingly sophisticated 
tastes. Eventually, the flavors that attract a significant following are picked up by 
the larger companies such as Kraft. As one industry analyst put it, “People want 
cheaper, more specialized gourmet products. It’s like fashion.”
Although some analysts believe that the great condiment craze can continue 
indefinitely, others think that a limit will eventually be reached as food buyers’ 
zest for experimentation wanes.

budget line through them.
a.  The consumption bundle consists of movie tickets and buckets of popcorn. The price 
of each ticket is $10.00, the price of each bucket of popcorn is $5.00, and the con-
sumer’s income is $20.00. In your diagram, put movie tickets on the vertical axis and 
buckets of popcorn on the horizontal axis.
b.  The consumption bundle consists of underwear and socks. The price of each pair 
of underwear is $4.00, the price of each pair of socks is $2.00, and the consumer’s 
income is $12.00. In your diagram, put pairs of socks on the vertical axis and pairs of 
underwear on the horizontal axis.

Spending the Marginal Dollar
A
s we’ve just seen, we can find Sammy’s optimal consumption choice by 
finding the total utility he receives from each consumption bundle on his 
budget line and then choosing the bundle at which total utility is maxi-
mized. But we can use marginal analysis instead, turning Sammy’s problem of 
finding his optimal consumption choice into a “how much” problem. 
How do we do this? By thinking about choosing an optimal consumption bundle as 
a problem of how much to spend on each good. That is, to find the optimal consumption 
bundle with marginal analysis, we ask whether Sammy can make himself better off by 
spending a little bit more of his income on clams and less on potatoes, or by doing the 
opposite—spending a little bit more on potatoes and less on clams. In other words, the 
marginal decision is a question of how to spend the marginal dollar—how to allocate an 
additional dollar between clams and potatoes in a way that maximizes utility.
Our first step in applying marginal analysis is to ask if Sammy is made better 
off by spending an additional dollar on either good; and if so, by how much is he 
better off. To answer this question we must calculate the marginal utility per 
dollar spent on either clams or potatoes—how much additional utility Sammy 
gets from spending an additional dollar on either good.
• The budget constraint requires that 
a consumer’s total expenditure be 
no more than his or her income. The 
set of consumption bundles that sat-
isfy the budget constraint is the con-
sumer’s consumption possibilities.
• A consumer who spends all of his 
or her income chooses a point on 
his or her budget line. The budget 
line slopes downward  because on 
the budget line a consumer must 
consume less of one good in order 
to consume more of another.
• The consumption choice that maxi-
mizes total utility given the consum-
er’s budget constraint is the optimal 
consumption bundle. It must lie on 
the consumer’s budget line.

Marginal Utility per Dollar
We’ve already introduced the concept of marginal utility, the additional utility a 
consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good or service; now let’s see 
how this concept can be used to derive the related measure of marginal utility 
per dollar.
Table 10-3 shows how to calculate the marginal utility per dollar spent on 
clams and potatoes, respectively.
In panel (a) of the table, the first column shows different possible amounts 
of clam consumption. The second column shows the utility Sammy derives from 
each amount of clam consumption; the third column then shows the marginal 
utility, the increase in utility Sammy gets from consuming an additional pound 
of clams. Panel (b) provides the same information for potatoes. The next step is 
PITFALLS
THE RIGHT MARGINAL COMPARISON
Marginal analysis solves “how much” deci-
sions by weighing costs and benefits at 
the margin: the benefit of doing a little bit 
more versus the cost of doing a little bit 
more. However, as we noted in Chapter 9, 
the form of the marginal analysis can differ, 
depending upon whether you are making a 
production decision that maximizes profits 
or a consumption decision that maximizes 
utility. Let’s review that difference again to 
make sure that it’s clearly understood.
In Chapter 9, Alex’s decision was a 
production decision because the problem 
he faced was maximizing the profit from 
years of schooling. The optimal quantity 
of years that maximized his profit was 
found using marginal analysis: at the 
optimal quantity, the marginal benefit of 
another year of schooling was equal to its 
marginal cost. Alex did not face a budget 
constraint because he could always bor-
row to finance another year of school. 
But if you were to extend the way 
we solved Alex’s production problem to 
Sammy’s consumption problem without 
any change in form, you might be tempted 
to say that Sammy’s optimal consumption 
bundle is the one at which the marginal 
utility of clams is equal to the marginal util-
ity of potatoes, or that the marginal utility 
of clams was equal to the price of clams. 
But both those statements would be wrong 
because they don’t properly account for 
the budget constraint and the fact that 
consuming more of one good requires con-
suming less of another. 
In a consumption decision, your objec-
tive is to maximize the utility that your lim-
ited budget can deliver. And the right way 
for finding the optimal consumption bundle 
is to set the marginal utility per dollar equal 
for each good in the consumption bundle. 
When this condition is satisfied, the “bang 
per buck” is the same across all the goods 
and services you consume. Only then is 
there no way to re-arrange your consump-
tion and get more utility from your budget.

to derive marginal utility per dollar for each good. To do this, we must divide the 
marginal utility of the good by its price in dollars.
To see why we must divide by the price, compare the third and fourth 
columns of panel (a). Consider what happens if Sammy increases his clam 
consumption from 2 pounds to 3 pounds. As we can see, this increase in clam 
consumption raises his total utility by 6 utils. But he must spend $4 for that 
additional pound, so the increase in his utility per additional dollar spent on 
clams is 6 utils/$4 = 1.5 utils per dollar. Similarly, if he increases his clam 
consumption from 3 pounds to 4 pounds, his marginal utility is 3 utils but 
his marginal utility per dollar is 3 utils/$4 = 0.75 util per dollar. Notice that 
because of diminishing marginal utility, Sammy’s marginal utility per pound 
of clams falls as the quantity of clams he consumes rises. As a result, his mar-
ginal utility per dollar spent on clams also falls as the quantity of clams he 
consumes rises.
So the last column of panel (a) shows how Sammy’s marginal utility per dollar 
spent on clams depends on the quantity of clams he consumes. Similarly, the last 
column of panel (b) shows how his marginal utility per dollar spent on potatoes 
depends on the quantity of potatoes he consumes. Again, marginal utility per 
dollar spent on each good declines as the quantity of that good consumed rises, 
because of diminishing marginal utility.
We will use the symbols MUC and MUP to represent the marginal utility 
per pound of clams and potatoes, respectively. And we will use the sym-
bols PC and PP to represent the price of clams (per pound) and the price of 
potatoes (per pound). Then the marginal utility per dollar spent on clams is 
MUC /PC and the marginal utility per dollar spent on potatoes is MUP /PP. In 
general, the additional utility generated from an additional dollar spent on 
a good is equal to:
(10-2)  Marginal utility per dollar spent on a good 
= Marginal utility of one unit of the good/Price of one unit of the good 
= MUGood/PGood
Now let’s see how this concept helps us derive a consumer’s optimal consump-
tion using marginal analysis.
Optimal Consumption
Let’s consider Figure 10-4. As in Figure 10-3, we can measure both the quan-
tity of clams and the quantity of potatoes on the horizontal axis due to the 
budget constraint. Along the horizontal axis of Figure 10-4—also as in Figure 
10-3—the quantity of clams increases as you move from left to right, and 
the quantity of potatoes increases as you move from right to left. The curve 
labeled MUC /PC in Figure 10-4 shows Sammy’s marginal utility per dollar 
spent on clams as derived in Table 10-3. Likewise, the curve labeled MUP/PP shows 
his marginal utility per dollar spent on potatoes. Notice that the two curves, 
MUC /PC and MUP/PP, cross at the optimal consumption bundle, point C, con-
sisting of 2 pounds of clams and 6 pounds of potatoes. Moreover, Figure 10-4 
illustrates an important feature of Sammy’s optimal consumption bundle: 
when Sammy consumes 2 pounds of clams and 6 pounds of potatoes, his 
marginal utility per dollar spent is the same, 2, for both goods. That is, at the 
optimal consumption bundle MUC /PC = MUP/PP = 2.
This isn’t an accident. Consider another one of Sammy’s possible consump-
tion bundles—say, B in Figure 10-3, at which he consumes 1 pound of clams 
and 8 pounds of potatoes. The marginal utility per dollar spent on each good is 
shown by points BC and BP in Figure 10-4. At that consumption bundle, Sammy’s 
marginal utility per dollar spent on clams would be approximately 3, but his 

C H A P T E R  1 0    T H E R AT I O N A L C O N S U M E R   281
marginal utility per dollar spent on potatoes would be only approximately 1. 
This shows that he has made a mistake: he is consuming too many potatoes and 
not enough clams.
How do we know this? If Sammy’s marginal utility per dollar spent on clams 
is higher than his marginal utility per dollar spent on potatoes, he has a simple 
way to make himself better off while staying within his budget: spend $1 less on 
potatoes and $1 more on clams. By spending an additional dollar on clams, he 
adds about 3 utils to his total utility; meanwhile, by spending $1 less on potatoes, 
he subtracts only about 1 util from his total utility.
Because his marginal utility per dollar spent is higher for clams than 
for potatoes, reallocating his spending toward clams and away from potatoes 
would increase his total utility. But if his marginal utility per dollar spent 
on potatoes is higher, he can increase his utility by spending less on clams 
and more on potatoes. So if Sammy has in fact chosen his optimal consump-
tion bundle, his marginal utility per dollar spent on clams and potatoes must 
be equal.
This is a general principle, which we call the utility-maximizing principle 
of marginal analysis: when a consumer maximizes utility in the face of a bud-
get constraint, the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good or service in the 
consumption bundle is the same. That is, for any two goods C and P the optimal 
consumption rule says that at the optimal consumption bundle:
(10-3) MUC
PC  = MUP
PP
It’s easiest to understand this rule using examples in which the consump-
tion bundle contains only two goods, but it applies no matter how many 
goods or services a consumer buys: in the optimal consumption bundle, the 
marginal utilities per dollar spent for each and every good or service in that 
bundle are equal.
Marginal Utility per Dollar
10-4
Sammy’s optimal consumption bundle is at point C, 
where his marginal utility per dollar spent on clams, 
MUC/PC, is equal to his marginal utility per dol-
lar spent on potatoes, MUP/PP. This illustrates the 
utility-maximizing principle of marginal analysis: at 
the optimal consumption bundle, the marginal util-
ity per dollar spent on each good and service is the 
same. At any other consumption bundle on Sammy’s 
budget line, such as bundle B in Figure 10-3, repre-
sented here by points BC and BP, consumption is not 
optimal: Sammy can increase his utility at no addi-
tional cost by reallocating his spending.

BUYING YOUR WAY OUT OF TEMPTATION 
I
t might seem odd to pay more to get less. But snack food 
companies have discovered that consumers are indeed willing 
to pay more for smaller portions, and exploiting this trend is a 
recipe for success. Over the last few years, sales of 100-calorie 
packs of crackers, chips, cookies, and candy have passed the $20 
million - a - year mark, growing much more quickly than the rest 
of the snack industry. A company executive explained why small 
packages are popular—they help consumers eat less without having 
to count calories themselves. “The irony,” said David Adelman, a 
food industry analyst, “is if you take Wheat Thins or Goldfish, buy 
a large - size box, count out the items and put them in a Ziploc bag, 
you’d have essentially the same product.” He estimates that snack 
packs are about 20% more profitable for snack makers than larger 
packages.
It’s clear that in this case consumers are making a calculation: the 
extra utility gained from not having to worry about whether they’ve 
eaten too much is worth the extra cost. As one shopper said, “They’re pretty 
expensive, but they’re worth it. It’s individually packaged for the amount I need, 
so I don’t go overboard.” So it’s clear that consumers aren’t being irrational here. 
Rather, they’re being entirely rational: in addition to their snack, they’re buying a 
little hand - to - mouth restraint.
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
10-3
1. In Table 10-3 you can see that marginal utility per dollar spent on clams and marginal 
utility per dollar spent on potatoes are equal when Sammy increases his consumption 
of clams from 3 pounds to 4 pounds and his consumption of potatoes from 9 pounds to 
10 pounds. Explain why this is not Sammy’s optimal consumption bundle. Illustrate your 
answer using the budget line in Figure 10-3.
2. Explain what is faulty about the following statement, using data from Table 10-3: “In 
order to maximize utility, Sammy should consume the bundle that gives him the maximum 
marginal utility per dollar for each good.”

From Utility to the Demand Curve
W
e have now analyzed the optimal consumption choice of a consumer 
with a given amount of income who faces one particular set of prices—
in our Sammy example, $20 of income per week, $4 per pound of clams, 
and $2 per pound of potatoes.
But the main reason for studying consumer behavior is to go behind the market 
demand curve—to explain how the utility-maximizing behavior of individual con-
sumers leads to the downward slope of the market demand curve. 
Marginal Utility, the Substitution Effect, 
and the Law of Demand
Suppose that the price of fried clams, PC, rises. The price increase doesn’t change 
the marginal utility a consumer gets from an additional pound of clams, MUC, at 
any given level of clam consumption. However, it does reduce the marginal utility 
For many consumers, paying extra for portion control 
is worth it.
• According to the utility-maximizing 
principle of marginal analysis the 
marginal utility per dollar—the 
marginal utility of a good, divided 
by its price—is the same for all 
goods in the optimal consumption 
bundle.
• Whenever marginal utility per dol-
lar is higher for one good than for 
another good, the consumer should 
spend $1 more on the good with the 
higher marginal utility per dollar and 
$1 less on the other. By doing this 
the consumer will move closer to his 
or her optimal consumption bundle.

per dollar spent on fried clams, MUC/PC. And the decrease in marginal utility per 
dollar spent on clams gives the consumer an incentive to consume fewer clams 
when the price of clams rises.
To see why, recall the utility-maximizing principle of marginal analysis: a 
utility - maximizing consumer chooses a consumption bundle for which the mar-
ginal utility per dollar spent on all goods is the same. If the marginal utility per 
dollar spent on clams falls because the price of clams rises, the consumer can 
increase his or her utility by purchasing fewer clams and more of other goods.
The opposite happens if the price of clams falls. In that case the marginal 
utility per dollar spent on clams, MUC/PC, increases at any given level of clam 
consumption. As a result, a consumer can increase her utility by purchasing more 
clams and less of other goods when the price of clams falls.
So when the price of a good increases, an individual will normally consume 
less of that good and more of other goods. Correspondingly, when the price of a 
good decreases, an individual will normally consume more of that good and less 
of other goods. This explains why the individual demand curve, which relates 
an individual’s consumption of a good to the price of that good, normally slopes 
downward—that is, it obeys the law of demand. And since—as we learned in 
Chapter 3—the market demand curve is the horizontal sum of all the individual 
demand curves of consumers, it, too, will slope downward.
An alternative way to think about why demand curves slope downward is to 
focus on opportunity costs. When the price of clams decreases, an individual 
doesn’t have to give up as many units of other goods in order to buy one more 
unit of clams. So consuming clams becomes more attractive. Conversely, when 
the price of a good increases, consuming that good becomes a less attractive use 
of resources, and the consumer buys less.
This effect of a price change on the quantity consumed is always present. It 
is known as the substitution effect—the change in the quantity consumed as 
the consumer substitutes other goods that are now relatively cheaper in place of 
the good that has become relatively more expensive. When a good absorbs only 
a small share of the consumer’s spending, the substitution effect is essentially 
the complete explanation of why the individual demand curve of that consumer 
slopes downward. And, by implication, when a good absorbs only a small share 
of the typical consumer’s spending, the substitution effect is essentially the sole 
explanation of why the market demand curve slopes downward. However, some 
goods, such as housing, absorb a large share of a typical consumer’s spending. 
For such goods, the story behind the individual demand curve and the market 
demand curve becomes slightly more complicated.
The Income Effect
For the vast majority of goods, the substitution effect is pretty much the entire 
story behind the slopes of the individual and market demand curves. There are, 
however, some goods, like food or housing, that account for a substantial share of 
many consumers’ spending. In such cases another effect, called the income effect, 
also comes into play.
Consider the case of a family that spends half its income on rental housing. 
Now suppose that the price of housing increases everywhere. This will have a sub-
stitution effect on the family’s demand: other things equal, the family will have an 
incentive to consume less housing—say, by moving to a smaller apartment—and 
more of other goods. But the family will also, in a real sense, be made poorer 
by that higher housing price—its income will buy less housing than before. The 
amount of income adjusted to reflect its true purchasing power is often termed 
“real income,” in contrast to “money income” or “nominal income,” which has not 
been adjusted. And this reduction in a consumer’s real income will have an addi-
tional effect, beyond the substitution effect, on the family’s consumption bundle, 
including its consumption of housing.
The substitution effect of a 
change in the price of a good is 
the change in the quantity of that 
good consumed as the consumer 
substitutes other goods that are 
now relatively cheaper in place of 
the good that has become relatively 
more expensive.

284    P A R T  5    T H E C O N S U M E R
The change in the quantity of a good consumed that results from a change in 
the overall purchasing power of the consumer due to a change in the price of that 
good is known as the income effect of the price change. In this case, a change 
in the price of a good effectively changes a consumer’s income because it alters 
the consumer’s purchasing power. Along with the substitution effect, the income 
effect is another means by which changes in prices alter consumption choices.
It’s possible to give more precise definitions of the substitution effect and the 
income effect of a price change, and we do this in the appendix to this chapter. 
For most purposes, however, there are only two things you need to know about 
the distinction between these two effects.
First, for the great majority of goods and services, the income effect is not 
important and has no significant effect on individual consumption. So most mar-
ket demand curves slope downward solely because of the substitution effect—end 
of story.
Second, when it matters at all, the income effect usually reinforces the substi-
tution effect. That is, when the price of a good that absorbs a substantial share of 
income rises, consumers of that good become a bit poorer because their purchas-
ing power falls. As we learned in Chapter 3, the vast majority of goods are normal
goods, goods for which demand decreases when income falls. So this effective 
reduction in income leads to a reduction in the quantity demanded and reinforces 
the substitution effect.
However, in the case of an inferior good, a good for which demand increases 
when income falls, the income and substitution effects work in opposite direc-
tions. Although the substitution effect tends to produce a decrease in the quantity 
of any good demanded as its price increases, in the case of an inferior good the 
income effect of a price increase tends to produce an increase in the quantity 
demanded.
As a result, there are hypothetical cases involving inferior goods in which 
the distinction between income and substitution effects is important. The most 
extreme example of this distinction is a Giffen good, a good that has an upward-
sloping demand curve.
The classic story used to describe a Giffen good harks back to nineteenth-
century Ireland, when it was a desperately poor country and a large portion of 
a typical household’s diet consisted of potatoes. Other things equal, an increase 
in the price of potatoes would have led people to reduce their demand for pota-
toes. But other things were not equal: for the nineteenth-century Irish, a higher 
price of potatoes would have left them poorer and increased their demand for 
potatoes because potatoes were an inferior good. If the income effect of a price 
increase outweighs the substitution effect—as was conjectured for potatoes in 
nineteenth-century Ireland—a rise in price leads to an increase in the quantity 
demanded. As a result, the demand curve slopes upward and the law of demand 
does not hold. 
In theory, Giffen goods can exist; but they have never been validated in any 
real situation, nineteenth-century Ireland included. So as a practical matter, 
it’s not a subject we need to worry about when discussing the demand for most 
goods. Typically, income effects are important only for a very limited number 
of goods.

MORTGAGE RATES AND CONSUMER DEMAND
M
ost people buy houses with mortgages—loans backed by the value of the 
house. The interest rates on such mortgages change over time; for example, 
they fell quite a lot over the period from 2000 to 2003. And in 2011, mortgage 
interest rates fell to their lowest levels in more than 50 years. When mortgage 
rates fall, the cost of housing falls for millions of people—even people who have 
The income effect of a change in 
the price of a good is the change in 
the quantity of that good consumed 
that results from a change in the 
consumer’s purchasing power due to 
the change in the price of the good.
A Giffen good is a hypothetical 
inferior good for which the income 
effect outweighs the substitution 
effect and the demand curve 
slopes upward .

mortgages at high interest rates are often able to “refinance” 
them at lower rates. The percentage of American households 
who owned their home increased from 67.1% in 2000 to a 
historical high of 69.2% in 2004. (Since 2004 it has fallen 
back slightly, to 66.9% in early 2010, because of turmoil in 
the financial market for mortgages.) 
It’s not surprising that the demand for housing goes up 
when mortgage rates go down. Economists have noticed, 
however, that the demand for many other goods also rises 
when mortgage rates fall. Some of these goods are items 
connected with new or bigger houses, such as furniture. But 
people also buy new cars, eat more meals in restaurants, and 
take more vacations. Why?
The answer illustrates the distinction between sub-
stitution and income effects. When housing becomes 
cheaper, there is a substitution effect: people have an 
incentive to substitute housing in place of other goods 
in their consumption bundle. But housing also happens to be a good that 
absorbs a large part of consumer spending, with many families spending a 
quarter or more of their income on mortgage payments. So when the price of 
housing falls, people are in effect richer—there is a significant income effect.
The increase in the quantity of housing demanded when mortgage rates fall 
is the result of both effects: housing becomes a better buy compared with other 
consumer goods, and people also buy more and bigger houses because they feel 
richer. And because they feel richer, they also buy more of all other normal goods, 
such as cars, restaurant meals, and vacations.

1. In each of the following cases, state whether the income effect, the substitution effect, 
or both are significant. In which cases do they move in the same direction? In opposite 
directions? Why?
a.  Orange juice represents a small share of Clare’s spending. She buys more lemonade 
and less orange juice when the price of orange juice goes up. She does not change 
her spending on other goods.
b.  Apartment rents have risen dramatically this year. Since rent absorbs a major part of 
her income, Delia moves to a smaller apartment. Assume that rental housing is a nor-

c.  The cost of a semester - long meal ticket at the student cafeteria rises, representing a

 Quick Review
• Most goods absorb only a small 
fraction of a consumer’s spending. 
For such goods, the substitution 
effect of a price change is the only 
important effect of the price change 
on consumption. It causes individ-
ual demand curves and the market 
demand curve to slope downward.
• When a good absorbs a large frac-
tion of a consumer’s spending, the 
income effect of a price change is 
present in addition to the substitu-
tion effect.
• For normal goods, demand rises 
when a consumer is richer and 
falls when a consumer is poorer, so 
that the income effect reinforces 
the substitution effect. For infe-
rior goods, demand rises when a 
consumer is poorer and falls when 
a consumer is richer, so that the 
income and substitution effects 
move in opposite directions.

In July 2011, McDonald’s announced that it would begin making its standard 
child’s Happy Meal more healthful. To be sure, healthier options were always 
available: a parent could ask for fruit or milk instead of fries or a soda. But most 
people opted for the standard meal by default. 
McDonald’s new standard Happy Meal includes a quarter cup of apple slices 
and fewer french fries, thereby lowering the salt, sugar, fat, and calorie content. 
But it is still up to parents to choose the beverage: low-fat milk, apple juice, or a 
soda. According to restaurant analyst Peter Saleh, “This is good publicity, and if 
you sell more Happy Meals, you’re selling more Big Macs to the parents.” 
The changes are likely to help offset long-standing criticism of the company 
for the lack of nutrional balance in its menu and concerns over the growing 
epidemic of childhood obesity. In New York and San Francisco, food advocates 
had proposed banning Happy Meals if they didn’t meet certain nutritional 
standards. Critics say that the current changes are only a small first step in the 
right direction. 
Long-time observers say that more than just countering its critics, McDonald’s 
is trying to hold onto a loyal customer base: Happy Meals account for an esti-
mated 10% of its annual sales, or $3 billion. And the competition isn’t standing 
still: Burger King, IHOP, Denny’s, Cracker Barrel, and Sizzler have all signed onto 
a campaign for healthier kids’ meals. 
McDonald’s has, in fact, been amazingly successful at keeping its customers 
happy even in a tough environment. In 2009, at the lowest point of the recession 
that began in 2007, sales at full-service restaurants fell more than 6% but stayed 
about the same at fast-food outlets. These restaurants kept their sales up by 
offering discounts and promotions as well as $1 menus and cheap combination 
meals. Same-store sales at McDonald’s have stayed approximately level during 
the downturn. 
However, many fast-food chains, such as Burger King, Jack in the Box, and 
Carl Jr.’s, saw their sales fall during the recession. They cut back their adver-
tising spending as the much larger McDonald’s increased its spending by 7% 
and increased its market share. And McDonald’s has aggressively expanded its 
menus—from the healthier Happy Meals to the “McCafé” line of espresso drinks, 
smoothies, and exotically flavored wraps. 
Observers are divided as to whether McDonald’s is earnestly attempting to 
get its customers to eat healthier food or is just engaging in advertising spin. One 
unknown is how customers will react: as one commenter said, “Salt may be bad 
for you, but it tastes great. . . . You can’t demand that McDonald’s or Burger King 
stop selling hamburgers and fries.” In the same vein, one franchise owner noted, 
“Expect customers to try the apples and then revert to asking for fries.” 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Give an example of a normal good and an inferior good mentioned in this case. Cite 
examples of substitution effects and income effects from the case.
 2. To induce fast-food customers to eat more healthful meals, what alternatives are there to 
bans? Do you think these alternatives would work? Why or why not?
 3. What do you think accounts for McDonald’s success? Relate this to concepts discussed 
in the chapter.

 1. Consumers maximize a measure of satisfaction called 
utility. Each consumer has a utility function that 
determines the level of total utility generated by his 
or her consumption bundle, the goods and services 
that are consumed. We measure utility in hypothetical 
units called utils.
 2. A good’s or service’s marginal utility is the additional 
utility generated by consuming one more unit of the 
good or service. We usually assume that the principle 
of diminishing marginal utility holds: consumption 
of another unit of a good or service yields less addi-
tional utility than the previous unit. As a result, the 
marginal utility curve slopes downward.
 3. A budget constraint limits a consumer’s spend-
ing to no more than his or her income. It defines the 
consumer’s consumption possibilities, the set of 
all affordable consumption bundles. A consumer who 
spends all of his or her income will choose a consump-
tion bundle on the budget line. An individual chooses 
the consumption bundle that maximizes total utility, 
the optimal consumption bundle.
 4. We use marginal analysis to find the optimal con-
sumption bundle by analyzing how to allocate the 
marginal dollar. According to the utility-maximizing 
principle of marginal analysis, at the optimal 
consumption bundle the marginal utility per dol-
lar spent on each good and service—the marginal 
utility of a good divided by its price—is the same.
 5. Changes in the price of a good affect the quantity 
consumed in two possible ways: the substitution 
effect and the income effect. Most goods absorb 
only a small share of a consumer’s spending; for 
these goods, only the substitution effect—buying 
less of the good that has become relatively more 
expensive and more of goods that are now relatively 
cheaper—is significant. It causes the individual 
and the market demand curves to slope downward. 
When a good absorbs a large fraction of spending, 
the income effect is also significant: an increase 
in a good’s price makes a consumer poorer, but 
a decrease in price makes a consumer richer. 
This change in purchasing power makes consum-
ers demand more or less of a good, depending on 
whether the good is normal or inferior. For normal 
goods, the substitution and income effects reinforce 
each other. For inferior goods, however, they work in 
opposite directions. The demand curve of a Giffen 
good slopes upward because it is an inferior good in 
which the income effect outweighs the substitution 
effect. However, data have never confirmed the exis-
tence of a Giffen good.
PROBLEMS
 1. For each of the following situations, decide whether 
Al has increasing, constant, or diminishing marginal 
utility.
 a. The more economics classes Al takes, the more 
he enjoys the subject. And the more classes he 
takes, the easier each one gets, making him 
enjoy each additional class even more than the 
one before.
 b. Al likes loud music. In fact, according to him, “the 
louder, the better.” Each time he turns the volume 
up a notch, he adds 5 utils to his total utility.
 c. Al enjoys watching reruns of the old sitcom Friends. 
He claims that these episodes are always funny, but 
he does admit that the more he sees an episode, the 
less funny it gets.
 d. Al loves toasted marshmallows. The more he eats, 
however, the fuller he gets and the less he enjoys 
each additional marshmallow. And there is a point 
at which he becomes satiated: beyond that point, 
more marshmallows actually make him feel worse 
rather than better.
 2. Use the concept of marginal utility to explain the fol-
lowing: Newspaper vending machines are designed 
so that once you have paid for one paper, you could 
take more than one paper at a time. But soda vending 
machines, once you have paid for one soda, dispense 
only one soda at a time.

Suppose Brenda knows she will consume 2 cups of 
coffee for sure. However, she can choose to consume 
different quantities of bagels: she can choose either 0, 
1, 2, 3, or 4 bagels.
 a. Calculate Brenda’s marginal utility from bagels as 
she goes from consuming 0 bagel to 1 bagel, from 
1 bagel to 2 bagels, from 2 bagels to 3 bagels, and 
from 3 bagels to 4 bagels.
 b. Draw Brenda’s marginal utility curve of bagels. Does 
Brenda have increasing, diminishing, or constant 
marginal utility of bagels?
 4. Brenda, the consumer in Problem 3, now has to make a 
decision about how many bagels and how much coffee 
to have for breakfast. She has $8 of income to spend on 
bagels and coffee. Use the information given in the table 
in Problem 3 to answer the following questions.
 a. Bagels cost $2 each, and coffee costs $2 per cup. 
Which bundles are on Brenda’s budget line? For 
each of these bundles, calculate the level of utility 
(in utils) that Brenda enjoys. Which bundle is her 
optimal bundle?
 b. The price of bagels increases to $4, but the price 
of coffee remains at $2 per cup. Which bundles 
are now on Brenda’s budget line? For each bundle, 
calculate Brenda’s level of utility (in utils). Which 
bundle is her optimal bundle?
 c. What do your answers to parts a and b imply about 
the slope of Brenda’s demand curve for bagels? 
Describe the substitution effect and the income 
effect of this increase in the price of bagels, assum-
ing that bagels are a normal good.
 5. Bruno can spend his income on two different goods: 
Beyoncé CDs and notebooks for his class notes. For 
each of the following three situations, decide if the 
given consumption bundle is within Bruno’s consump-
tion possibilities. Then decide if it lies on the budget line 
or not.
 a. CDs cost $10 each, and notebooks cost $2 each. 
Bruno has income of $60. He is considering a con-
sumption bundle containing 3 CDs and 15 notebooks.
 b. CDs cost $10 each, and notebooks cost $5 each. 
Bruno has income of $110. He is considering a con-
sumption bundle containing 3 CDs and 10 notebooks.
 c. CDs cost $20 each, and notebooks cost $10 each. 
Bruno has income of $50. He is considering a con-
sumption bundle containing 2 CDs and 2 notebooks.
 6. Bruno, the consumer in Problem 5, is best friends with 
Bernie, who shares his love for notebooks and Beyoncé 
CDs. The accompanying table shows Bernie’s utilities

The price of a notebook is $5, the price of a CD is $10, 
and Bernie has $50 of income to spend.
 a. Which consumption bundles of notebooks and CDs 
can Bernie consume if he spends all his income? 
Illustrate Bernie’s budget line with a diagram, put-
ting notebooks on the horizontal axis and CDs on 
the vertical axis.
 b. Calculate the marginal utility of each notebook and 
the marginal utility of each CD. Then calculate the 
marginal utility per dollar spent on notebooks and 
the marginal utility per dollar spent on CDs.
 c. Draw a diagram like Figure 10-4 in which both 
the marginal utility per dollar spent on notebooks 
and the marginal utility per dollar spent on CDs 
are illustrated. Using this diagram and the utility-
maximizing principle of marginal analysis, predict 
which bundle—from all the bundles on his budget 
line—Bernie will choose.
 7. For each of the following situations, decide whether the 
bundle Lakshani is considering optimal or not. If it is not 
optimal, how could Lakshani improve her overall level of 
utility? That is, determine which good she should spend 
more on and which good should she spend less on.
 a. Lakshani has $200 to spend on sneakers and sweat-
ers. Sneakers cost $50 per pair, and sweaters cost 
$20 each. She is thinking about buying 2 pairs of 
sneakers and 5 sweaters. She tells her friend that the 
additional utility she would get from the second pair 
of sneakers is the same as the additional utility she 
would get from the fifth sweater.
 b. Lakshani has $5 to spend on pens and pencils. Each 
pen costs $0.50 and each pencil costs $0.10. She is 
thinking about buying 6 pens and 20 pencils. The 

C H A P T E R  1 0    T H E R AT I O N A L C O N S U M E R   289
last pen would add five times as much to her total 
utility as the last pencil.
 c. Lakshani has $50 per season to spend on tickets to 
football games and tickets to soccer games. Each 
football ticket costs $10 and each soccer ticket costs 
$5. She is thinking about buying 3 football tickets 
and 2 soccer tickets. Her marginal utility from the 
third football ticket is twice as much as her mar-
ginal utility from the second soccer ticket.
 8. Cal “Cool” Cooper has $200 to spend on cell phones and 
sunglasses. 
 a. Each cell phone costs $100 and each pair of sunglasses 
costs $50. Which bundles lie on Cal’s budget line? 
Draw a diagram like Figure 10-4 in which both the 
marginal utility per dollar spent on cell phones and 
the marginal utility per dollar spent on sunglasses 
are illustrated. Use this diagram and the optimal 
consumption rule to decide how Cal should allocate 
his money. That is, from all the bundles on his budget 
line, which bundle will Cal choose? The accompanying 
table gives his utility of cell phones and sunglasses.

Damien has 14 hours per week to spend on watching 
movies and going to the gym. Each movie takes 2 hours 
and each gym visit takes 2 hours. (Hint: Damien’s free 
time is analogous to income he can spend. The hours 
needed for each activity are analogous to the price of 
that activity.)
 a. Which bundles of gym visits and movies can Damien 
consume per week if he spends all his time either 
going to the gym or watching movies? Draw Damien’s 
budget line in a diagram with gym visits on the hori-
zontal axis and movies on the vertical axis.
 b. Calculate the marginal utility of each gym visit 
and the marginal utility of each movie. Then 
calculate the marginal utility per hour spent at 
the gym and the marginal utility per hour spent 
watching movies.
 c. Draw a diagram like Figure 10-4 in which both the 
marginal utility per hour spent at the gym and the 
marginal utility per hour spent watching movies 
are illustrated. Use this diagram and the utility-
maximizing principle of marginal analysis to decide 
how Damien should allocate his time.
10. Anna Jenniferson is an actress who currently spends 
several hours each week watching movies and going to 
the gym. On the set of a new movie she meets Damien, 
the consumer in Problem 9. She tells him that she likes 
watching movies much more than going to the gym. 
In fact, she says that if she had to give up seeing 1 
movie, she would need to go to the gym twice to make 
up for the loss in utility from not seeing the movie. A 
movie takes 2 hours, and a gym visit also lasts 2 hours. 
Damien tells Anna that she is not watching enough 
movies. Is he right?
11. Sven is a poor student who covers most of his dietary 
needs by eating cheap breakfast cereal, since it contains 
most of the important vitamins. As the price of cereal 
increases, he decides to buy even less of other foods 
and even more breakfast cereal to maintain his intake 
of important nutrients. This makes breakfast cereal a 
Giffen good for Sven. Describe in words the substitu-
tion effect and the income effect from this increase in 
the price of cereal. In which direction does each effect 

290    P A R T  5    T H E C O N S U M E R
move, and why? What does this imply for the slope of 
Sven’s demand curve for cereal?
12. In each of the following situations, describe the substitu-
tion effect and, if it is significant, the income effect. In 
which direction does each of these effects move? Why?
 a. Ed spends a large portion of his income on his chil-
dren’s education. Because tuition fees rise, one of his 
children has to withdraw from college.
 b. Homer spends much of his monthly income on home 
mortgage payments. The interest on his adjustable-
rate mortgage falls, lowering his mortgage pay-
ments, and Homer decides to move to a larger 
house.
 c. Pam thinks that Spam is an inferior good. Yet as the 
price of Spam rises, she decides to buy less of it.
13. Restaurant meals and housing (measured in the num-
ber of rooms) are the only two goods that Neha buys. 
She has income of $1,000. Initially, she buys a con-
sumption bundle such that she spends exactly half her 
income on restaurant meals and the other half of her 
income on housing. Then her income increases by 50%, 
but the price of restaurant meals increases by 100% (it 
doubles). The price of housing remains the same. After 
these changes, if she wanted to, could Neha still buy the 
same consumption bundle as before?
14. Scott finds that the higher the price of orange juice, the 
more money he spends on orange juice. Does that mean 
that Scott has discovered a Giffen good?
15. Margo’s marginal utility of one dance lesson is 100 utils 
per lesson. Her marginal utility of a new pair of dance 
shoes is 300 utils per pair. The price of a dance lesson 
is $50 per lesson. She currently spends all her income, 
and she buys her optimal consumption bundle. What is 
the price of a pair of dance shoes?
16. According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, 
the average retail price of regular gasoline rose from 
$1.16 in 1990 to $2.79 in 2010, a 140% increase.
 a. Other things equal, describe the effect of this price 
increase on the quantity of gasoline demanded. In 
your explanation, make use of the utility-maximizing 
principle of marginal analysis and describe income 
and substitution effects.
In fact, however, other things were not equal. Over the 
same time period, the prices of other goods and ser-
vices rose as well. According to data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the overall price of a bundle of goods 
and services consumed by an average consumer rose 
by 63%.
 b. Taking into account the rise in the price of gasoline 
and in overall prices, other things equal, describe 
the effect on the quantity of gasoline demanded.
However, this is not the end of the story. Between 1990 
and 2010, the typical consumer’s nominal income 
increased, too: the U.S. Census Bureau reports that U.S. 
median household nominal income rose from $29,943 
in 1990 to $49,445 in 2010, an increase of 65%.
 c. Taking into account the rise in the price of gaso-
line, in overall prices, and in consumers’ incomes, 
describe the effect on the quantity of gasoline 
demanded.

Consumer Preferences 
and Consumer Choice
Different people have different preferences. But even given an individual’s pref-
erences, there may be different consumption bundles—different combinations 
of the goods and services an individual consumes—that yield the same total 
utility. This insight leads to the concept of indifference curves, a useful way to 
represent individual preferences. In this appendix, we will look closely at indif-
ference curves.
In addition, an individual’s total utility depends not only on income but also 
on prices—and that both income and prices affect consumer choices. We will 
apply this more complete analysis of consumer choice to the important dis-
tinction between complements and substitutes. Finally, we will use this insight 
to examine further the income and substitution effects we covered briefly in 
Chapter 10.
But, let’s begin with indifference curves.
Mapping the Utility Function
In Chapter 10 we introduced the concept of a utility function, which determines 
a consumer’s total utility given his or her consumption bundle. In Figure 10-1 we 
saw how Cassie’s total utility changed as we changed the quantity of fried clams 
consumed, holding fixed the quantities of other items in her bundle. That is, in 
Figure 10-1 we showed how total utility changed as consumption of only one good 
changed. But we also learned in Chapter 10, from our example of Sammy, that 
finding the optimal consumption bundle involves the problem of how to allocate 
the last dollar spent between two goods, clams and potatoes. In this appendix we 
will extend the analysis by learning how to express total utility as a function of 
consumption of two goods. In this way we will deepen our understanding of the 
trade - off involved when choosing the optimal consumption bundle and of how 
the optimal consumption bundle itself changes in response to changes in the 
prices of goods. In order to do that, we now turn to a different way of representing 
a consumer’s utility function, based on the concept of indifference curves.
Indifference Curves
Ingrid is a consumer who buys only two goods: housing, measured in the number 
of rooms, and restaurant meals. How can we represent her utility function in a 
way that takes account of her consumption of both goods?
One way is to draw a three - dimensional picture. Figure 10A-1 shows a three- 
dimensional “utility hill.” The distance along the horizontal axis measures the 
quantity of housing Ingrid consumes in terms of numbers of rooms; the distance 
along the vertical axis measures the number of restaurant meals she consumes. 
The altitude or height of the hill at each point is indicated by a contour line, along 
which the height of the hill is constant. For example, point A, which corresponds 
to a consumption bundle of 3 rooms and 30 restaurant meals, lies on the contour 
line labeled 450. So the total utility Ingrid receives from consuming 3 rooms and 
30 restaurant meals is 450 utils.
A three - dimensional picture like Figure 10A-1 helps us think about the rela-
tionship between consumption bundles and total utility. But anyone who has ever

used a topographical map to plan a hiking trip knows that it is possible to repre-
sent a three- dimensional surface in only two dimensions. A topographical map 
doesn’t offer a three - dimensional view of the terrain; instead, it conveys informa-
tion about altitude solely through the use of contour lines.
The same principle can be applied to representing the utility function. In Figure 
10A-2, Ingrid’s consumption of rooms is measured on the horizontal axis and her 
consumption of restaurant meals on the vertical axis. The curve here corresponds 
to the contour line in Figure 10A-1, drawn at a total utility of 450 utils. This curve 
shows all the consumption bundles that yield a total utility of 450 utils. One point 
on that contour line is A, a consumption bundle consisting of 3 rooms and 30 
restaurant meals. Another point on that contour line is B, a consumption bundle 
Ingrid’s Utility Function
10A-1
The three - dimensional hill shows how 
Ingrid’s total utility depends on her con-
sumption of housing and restaurant meals. 
Point A corresponds to consumption of 3 
rooms and 30 restaurant meals. That con-
sumption bundle yields Ingrid 450 utils, 
corresponding to the height of the hill at 
point A. The lines running around the hill 
are contour lines, along which the height 
is constant. So every point on a given con-
tour line generates the same level of utility.

10A-2
An indifference curve is a contour line along 
which total utility is constant. In this case, we 
show all the consumption bundles that yield 
Ingrid 450 utils. Consumption bundle A, con-
sisting of 3 rooms and 30 restaurant meals, 
yields the same total utility as bundle B, con-
sisting of 6 rooms and 15 restaurant meals. 
That is, Ingrid is indifferent between bundle A 
and bundle B.

consisting of 6 rooms but only 15 restaurant meals. Because B lies on the same 
contour line, it yields Ingrid the same total utility—450 utils—as A. We say that 
Ingrid is indifferent between A and B: because bundles A and B yield the same total 
utility level, Ingrid is equally well off with either bundle.
A contour line that maps consumption bundles yielding the same amount of 
total utility is known as an indifference curve. An individual is always indiffer-
ent between any two bundles that lie on the same indifference curve. For a given 
consumer, there is an indifference curve corresponding to each possible level of 
total utility. For example, the indifference curve in Figure 10A-2 shows consump-
tion bundles that yield Ingrid 450 utils; different indifference curves would show 
consumption bundles that yield Ingrid 400 utils, 500 utils, and so on.
A collection of indifference curves that represents a given consumer’s entire 
utility function, with each indifference curve corresponding to a different level of 
total utility, is known as an indifference curve map. Figure 10A-3 shows three 
indifference curves—I1, I2, and I3—from Ingrid’s indifference curve map, as well 
as several consumption bundles, A, B, C, and D. The accompanying table lists each 
bundle, its composition of rooms and restaurant meals, and the total utility it 
yields. Because bundles A and B generate the same number of utils, 450, they lie on 
the same indifference curve, I2. Although Ingrid is indifferent between A and B, she 
is certainly not indifferent between A and C: as you can see from the table, C gener-
ates only 391 utils, a lower total utility than A or B. So Ingrid prefers consumption 
bundles A and B to bundle C. This is represented by the fact that C is on indiffer-
ence curve I1, and I1 lies below I2. Bundle D, though, generates 519 utils, a higher 
total utility than A and B. It is on I3, an indifference curve that lies above I2. Clearly, 
Ingrid prefers D to either A or B. And, even more strongly, she prefers D to C.

The utility function can be represented in greater 
detail by increasing the number of indifference 
curves drawn, each corresponding to a different level 
of total utility. In this figure bundle C lies on an indif-
ference curve corresponding to a total utility of 391 
utils. As in Figure 10A-2, bundles A and B lie on an 
indifference curve corresponding to a total utility of 
450 utils. Bundle D lies on an indifference curve cor-
responding to a total utility of 519 utils. Ingrid prefers 
any bundle on I2 to any bundle on I1, and she prefers 
any bundle on I3 to any bundle on I2.
An indifference curve is a line that 
shows all the consumption bundles 
that yield the same amount of total 
utility for an individual.
The entire utility function of an 
individual can be represented by 
an indifference curve map, a 
collection of indifference curves in 
which each curve corresponds to a 
different total utility level.

Properties of Indifference Curves
No two individuals have the same indifference curve map because no two indi-
viduals have the same preferences. But economists believe that, regardless of 
the person, every indifference curve map has two general properties. These are 
illustrated in panel (a) of Figure 10A-4:
 • Indifference curves never cross. Suppose that we tried to draw an indifference 
curve map like the one depicted in the left diagram in panel (a), in which two 
indifference curves cross at A. What is the total utility at A? Is it 100 utils or

Panel (a) represents two general properties that all 
indifference curve maps share. The left diagram 
shows why indifference curves cannot cross: if they 
did, a consumption bundle such as A would yield 
both 100 and 200 utils, a contradiction. The right dia-
gram of panel (a) shows that indifference curves that 
are farther out yield higher total utility: bundle B, 
which contains more of both goods than bundle A, 
yields higher total utility. Panel (b) depicts two addi-
tional properties of indifference curves for ordinary 
goods. The left diagram of panel (b) shows that indif-
ference curves slope downward: as you move down 
the curve from bundle W to bundle Z, consumption 
of rooms increases. To keep total utility constant, 
this must be offset by a reduction in quantity of res-
taurant meals. The right diagram of panel (b) shows 
a convex-shaped indifference curve. The slope of the 
indifference curve gets flatter as you move down the 
curve to the right, a feature arising from diminishing 
marginal utility.

C H A P T E R  1 0  A P P E N D I X    C O N S U M E R  P R E F E R E N C E S  A N D  C O N S U M E R  C H O I C E    295
200 utils? Indifference curves cannot cross because each consumption bundle 
must correspond to a unique total utility level—not, as shown at A, two differ-
ent total utility levels.
 • The farther out an indifference curve lies—the farther it is from the origin—the 
higher the level of total utility it indicates. The reason, illustrated in the right 
diagram in panel (a), is that we assume that more is better—we consider only 
the consumption bundles for which the consumer is not satiated. Bundle B, on 
the outer indifference curve, contains more of both goods than bundle A on 
the inner indifference curve. So B, because it generates a higher total utility 
level (200 utils), lies on a higher indifference curve than A.
Furthermore, economists believe that, for most goods, consumers’ indiffer-
ence curve maps also have two additional properties. They are illustrated in 
panel (b) of Figure 10A-4:
 
• Indifference curves slope downward. Here, too, the reason is that more is 
better. The left diagram in panel (b) shows four consumption bundles on 
the same indifference curve: W, X, Y, and Z. By definition, these consump-
tion bundles yield the same level of total utility. But as you move along 
the curve to the right, from W to Z, the quantity of rooms consumed 
increases. The only way a person can consume more rooms without gain-
ing utility is by giving up some restaurant meals. So the indifference curve 
must slope downward.
 • Indifference curves have a convex shape. The right diagram in panel (b) shows 
that the slope of each indifference curve changes as you move down the curve 
to the right: the curve gets flatter. If you move up an indifference curve to the 
left, the curve gets steeper. So the indifference curve is steeper at A than it is at 
B. When this occurs, we say that an indifference curve has a convex shape—it 
is bowed - in toward the origin. This feature arises from diminishing marginal 
utility, a principle we discussed in Chapter 10. Recall that when a consumer 
has diminishing marginal utility, consumption of another unit of a good gen-
erates a smaller increase in total utility than the previous unit consumed. In 
the next section, we will examine in detail how diminishing marginal utility 
gives rise to convex - shaped indifference curves.
Goods that satisfy all four properties of indifference curve maps are called 
ordinary goods. The vast majority of goods in any consumer’s utility function fall 
into this category. In the next section, we will define ordinary goods and see the 
key role that diminishing marginal utility plays for them.
Indifference Curves and 
Consumer Choice
At the beginning of the last section, we used indifference curves to represent the 
preferences of Ingrid, whose consumption bundles consist of rooms and restau-
rant meals. Our next step is to show how to use Ingrid’s indifference curve map 
to find her utility - maximizing consumption bundle given her budget constraint, 
the fact that she must choose a consumption bundle that costs no more than her 
total income.
It’s important to understand how our analysis here relates to what we did in 
Chapter 10. We are not offering a new theory of consumer behavior in this appen-
dix—just as in Chapter 10, consumers are assumed to maximize total utility. In 
particular, we know that consumers will follow the optimal consumption rule 
from Chapter 10: the optimal consumption bundle lies on the budget line, and the 
marginal utility per dollar is the same for every good in the bundle.
But as we’ll see shortly, we can derive this optimal consumer behavior in a 
somewhat different way—a way that yields deeper insights into consumer choice.

296    P A R T  5   T H E C O N S U M E R
The Marginal Rate of Substitution
The first element of our approach is a new concept, the marginal rate of substitu-
tion. The essence of this concept is illustrated in Figure 10A-5.
Recall from the last section that for most goods, consumers’ indifference 
curves are downward sloping and convex. Figure 10A-5 shows such an indif-
ference curve. The points labeled V, W, X, Y, and Z all lie on this indifference 
curve—that is, they represent consumption bundles that yield Ingrid the same 
level of total utility. The table accompanying the figure shows the components of 
each of the bundles. As we move along the indifference curve from V to Z, Ingrid’s 
consumption of housing steadily increases from 2 rooms to 6 rooms, her con-
sumption of restaurant meals steadily decreases from 30 meals to 10 meals, and 
her total utility is kept constant. As we move down the indifference curve, then, 
Ingrid is trading more of one good in place of less of the other, with the terms of 
that trade - off—the ratio of additional rooms consumed to restaurant meals sac-
rificed—chosen to keep her total utility constant.
Notice that the quantity of restaurant meals that Ingrid is willing to give up in 
return for an additional room changes along the indifference curve. As we move 
from V to W, housing consumption rises from 2 to 3 rooms and restaurant meal 
consumption falls from 30 to 20—a trade - off of 10 restaurant meals for 1 addi-
tional room. But as we move from Y to Z, housing consumption rises from 5 to 6 
rooms and restaurant meal consumption falls from 12 to 10, a trade - off of only 2 
restaurant meals for an additional room.
To put it in terms of slopes, the slope of the indifference curve between V and W is 
−10: the change in restaurant meal consumption, −10, divided by the change in housing 
consumption, 1. Similarly, the slope of the indifference curve between Y and Z is −2.

This indifference curve is downward sloping and convex, 
implying that restaurant meals and rooms are ordinary 
goods for Ingrid. As Ingrid moves down her indifference 
curve from V to Z, she trades reduced consumption of 
restaurant meals for increased consumption of housing. 
However, the terms of that trade - off change. As she moves 
from V to W, she is willing to give up 10 restaurant meals 
in return for 1 more room. As her consumption of rooms 
rises and her consumption of restaurant meals falls, she is 
willing to give up fewer restaurant meals in return for each 
additional room. The flattening of the slope as you move 
from left to right arises from diminishing marginal utility.

So the indifference curve gets flatter as we move down it to the right—that is, it has a 
convex shape, one of the four properties of an indifference curve for ordinary goods.
Why does the trade - off change in this way? Let’s think about it intuitively, then 
work through it more carefully. When Ingrid moves down her indifference curve, 
whether from V to W or from Y to Z, she gains utility from her additional con-
sumption of housing but loses an equal amount of utility from her reduced con-
sumption of restaurant meals. But at each step, the initial position from which 
Ingrid begins is different. At V, Ingrid consumes only a small quantity of rooms; 
because of diminishing marginal utility, her marginal utility per room at that 
point is high. At V, then, an additional room adds a lot to Ingrid’s total utility. But 
at V she already consumes a large quantity of restaurant meals, so her marginal 
utility of restaurant meals is low at that point. This means that it takes a large 
reduction in her quantity of restaurant meals consumed to offset the increased 
utility she gets from the extra room of housing.
At Y, in contrast, Ingrid consumes a much larger quantity of rooms and a 
much smaller quantity of restaurant meals than at V. This means that an addi-
tional room adds fewer utils, and a restaurant meal forgone costs more utils, than 
at V. So Ingrid is willing to give up fewer restaurant meals in return for another 
room of housing at Y (where she gives up 2 meals for 1 room) than she is at V 
(where she gives up 10 meals for 1 room).
Now let’s express the same idea—that the trade - off Ingrid is willing to make 
depends on where she is starting from—by using a little math. We do this by 
examining how the slope of the indifference curve changes as we move down it. 
Moving down the indifference curve—reducing restaurant meal consumption and 
increasing housing consumption—will produce two opposing effects on Ingrid’s 
total utility: lower restaurant meal consumption will reduce her total utility, but 
higher housing consumption will raise her total utility. And since we are moving 
down the indifference curve, these two effects must exactly cancel out:
Along the indifference curve:
(10A-1)  (Change in total utility due to lower restaurant meal consumption) + 
(Change in total utility due to higher housing consumption) = 0
or, rearranging terms,
Along the indifference curve:
(10A-2) − (Change in total utility due to lower restaurant meal consumption) = 
(Change in total utility due to higher housing consumption)
Let’s now focus on what happens as we move only a short distance down the 
indifference curve, trading off a small increase in housing consumption in place 
of a small decrease in restaurant meal consumption. Following our notation from 
Chapter 10, let’s use MUR and MUM to represent the marginal utility of rooms and 
restaurant meals, respectively, and ΔQR and ΔQM to represent the changes in room 
and meal consumption, respectively. In general, the change in total utility caused 
by a small change in consumption of a good is equal to the change in consump-
tion multiplied by the marginal utility of that good. This means that we can calcu-
late the change in Ingrid’s total utility generated by a change in her consumption 
bundle using the following equations:
(10A-3)  Change in total utility due to a change in restaurant meal consump-
tion = MUM × ΔQM
and
(10A-4)  Change in total utility due to a change in housing consumption 
= MUR × ΔQR

298    P A R T  5   T H E C O N S U M E R
So we can write Equation 10A-2 in symbols as:
(10A-5) Along the indifference curve: −MUM × ΔQM = MUR × ΔQR
Note that the left - hand side of Equation 10A-5 has a minus sign; it represents 
the loss in total utility from decreased restaurant meal consumption. This must 
equal the gain in total utility from increased room consumption, represented by 
the right - hand side of the equation.
What we want to know is how this translates into the slope of the indifference 
curve. To find the slope, we divide both sides of Equation 10A-5 by ΔQR, and again 
by −MUM, in order to get the ΔQM, ΔQR terms on one side and the MUR, MUM terms 
on the other. This results in:
(10A-6) Along the indifference curve: ΔQM
ΔQR 
 = − MUR
MUM
The left - hand side of Equation 10A-6 is the slope of the indifference curve; it 
is the rate at which Ingrid is willing to trade rooms (the good on the horizontal 
axis) in place of restaurant meals (the good on the vertical axis) without changing 
her total utility level. The right - hand side of Equation 10A-6 is minus the ratio of 
the marginal utility of rooms to the marginal utility of restaurant meals—that 
is, the ratio of what she gains from one more room to what she gains from one 
more meal.
Putting all this together, we see that Equation 10A-6 shows that, along the 
indifference curve, the quantity of restaurant meals Ingrid is willing to give up in 
return for a room, ΔQM/ΔQR, is exactly equal to minus the ratio of the marginal 
utility of a room to that of a meal, −MUR/MUM. Only when this condition is met 
will her total utility level remain constant as she consumes more rooms and fewer 
restaurant meals.
Economists have a special name for the ratio of the marginal utilities found in 
the right - hand side of Equation 10A-6: it is called the marginal rate of substitu-
tion, or MRS, of rooms (the good on the horizontal axis) in place of restaurant 
meals (the good on the vertical axis). That’s because as we slide down Ingrid’s 
indifference curve, we are substituting more rooms in place of fewer restaurant 
meals in her consumption bundle. As we’ll see shortly, the marginal rate of sub-
stitution plays an important role in finding the optimal consumption bundle.
Recall that indifference curves get flatter as you move down them to the right. 
The reason, as we’ve just discussed, is diminishing marginal utility: as Ingrid con-
sumes more housing and fewer restaurant meals, her marginal utility from hous-
ing falls and her marginal utility from restaurant meals rises. So her marginal 
rate of substitution, which is equal to minus the slope of her indifference curve, 
falls as she moves down the indifference curve.
The flattening of indifference curves as you slide down them to the right—
which reflects the same logic as the principle of diminishing marginal utility—is 
known as the principle of diminishing marginal rate of substitution. It says 
that an individual who consumes only a little bit of good A and a lot of good B will 
be willing to trade off a lot of B in return for one more unit of A; an individual 
who already consumes a lot of A and not much B will be less willing to make that 
trade - off.
We can illustrate this point by referring back to Figure 10A-5. At point V, a 
bundle with a high proportion of restaurant meals to rooms, Ingrid is willing to 
forgo 10 restaurant meals in return for 1 room. But at point Y, a bundle with a low 
proportion of restaurant meals to rooms, she is willing to forgo only 2 restaurant 
meals in return for 1 room.
From this example we can see that, in Ingrid’s utility function, rooms and 
restaurant meals possess the two additional properties that characterize ordinary 
The marginal rate of substitution, 
or MRS, of good R in place of good 
M is equal to MUR/MUM, the ratio 
of the marginal utility of R to the 
marginal utility of M.
The principle of diminishing 
marginal rate of substitution 
states that the more of good R a 
person consumes in proportion to 
good M, the less M he or she is 
willing to substitute for another unit 
of R.

goods. Ingrid requires additional rooms to compensate her for the loss of a meal, 
and vice versa; so her indifference curves for these two goods slope downward. 
And her indifference curves are convex: the slope of her indifference curve—
minus the marginal rate of substitution—becomes flatter as we move down it. In 
fact, an indifference curve is convex only when it has diminishing marginal rate 
of substitution—these two conditions are equivalent.
With this information, we can define ordinary goods, which account for the 
great majority of goods in any consumer’s utility function. A pair of goods are 
ordinary goods in a consumer’s utility function if they possess two properties: the 
consumer requires more of one good to compensate for less of the other, and the 
consumer experiences a diminishing marginal rate of substitution when substi-
tuting one good in place of the other.
Next we will see how to determine Ingrid’s optimal consumption bundle using 
indifference curves.
The Tangency Condition
Now let’s put some of Ingrid’s indifference curves on the same diagram as her 
bud get line, to illustrate an alternative way of representing her optimal con-
sumption choice. Figure 10A-6 shows Ingrid’s budget line, BL, when her income 
is $2,400 per month, housing costs $150 per room each month, and restaurant 
meals cost $30 each. What is her optimal consumption bundle?
To answer this question, we show several of Ingrid’s indifference curves: I1, 
I2, and I3. Ingrid would like to achieve the total utility level represented by I3, the 
highest of the three curves, but she cannot afford to because she is constrained 
by her income: no consumption bundle on her budget line yields that much total 
utility. But she shouldn’t settle for the level of total utility generated by B, which 
lies on I1: there are other bundles on her budget line, such as A, that clearly yield 
higher total utility than B.
In fact, A—a consumption bundle consisting of 8 rooms and 40 restaurant 
meals per month—is Ingrid’s optimal consumption choice. The reason is that A 
lies on the highest indifference curve Ingrid can reach given her income.
The Optimal Consumption Bundle
10A-6
The budget line, BL, shows Ingrid’s possible 
consumption bundles given an income of 
$2,400 per month, when rooms cost $150 
per month and restaurant meals cost $30 
each. I1, I2, and I3 are indifference curves. 
Consumption bundles such as B and C are 
not optimal because Ingrid can move to a 
higher indifference curve. The optimal con-
sumption bundle is A, where the budget line 
is just tangent to the highest possible indiffer-
ence curve.

Two goods, R and M, are ordinary 
goods in a consumer’s utility 
function when (1) the consumer 
requires additional units of R 
to compensate for less M, and 
vice versa; and (2) the consumer 
experiences a diminishing marginal 
rate of substitution when substituting 
one good in place of another.

300    P A R T  5   T H E C O N S U M E R
At the optimal consumption bundle A, Ingrid’s budget line just touches the 
relevant indifference curve—the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve. 
This tangency condition between the indifference curve and the budget line 
applies to the optimal consumption bundle when the indifference curves have 
the typical convex shape: at the optimal consumption bundle, the budget line just 
touches—is tangent to—the indifference curve.
To see why, let’s look more closely at how we know that a consumption bundle 
that doesn’t satisfy the tangency condition can’t be optimal. Re examining Figure 
10A-6, we can see that the consumption bundles B and C are both affordable 
because they lie on the budget line. However, neither is optimal. Both of them lie 
on the indifference curve I1, which cuts through the budget line at both points. 
But because I1 cuts through the budget line, Ingrid can do better: she can move 
down the budget line from B or up the budget line from C, as indicated by the 
arrows. In each case, this allows her to get onto a higher indifference curve, I2, 
which increases her total utility.
Ingrid cannot, however, do any better than I2: any other indifference curve 
either cuts through her budget line or doesn’t touch it at all. And the bundle that 
allows her to achieve I2 is, of course, her optimal consumption bundle.
The Slope of the Budget Line
Figure 10A-6 shows us how to use a graph of the budget line and the indiffer-
ence curves to find the optimal consumption bundle, the bundle at which the 
budget line and the indifference curve are tangent. But rather than rely on draw-
ing graphs, we can determine the optimal consumption bundle by using a bit of 
math. As you can see from Figure 10A-6, at A, the optimal consumption bundle, 
the budget line and the indifference curve have the same slope. Why? Because 
two curves can only touch each other if they have the same slope at their point of 
tangency. Otherwise, they would cross each other somewhere. And we know that 
if we are on an indifference curve that crosses the budget line (like I1 in Figure 
10A-6), we can’t be on the indifference curve that contains the optimal consump-
tion bundle (like I2).
So we can use information about the slopes of the budget line and the indif-
ference curve to find the optimal consumption bundle. To do that, we must first 
analyze the slope of the budget line, a fairly straightforward task. We know that 
Ingrid will get the highest possible utility by spending all of her income and con-
suming a bundle on her budget line. So we can represent Ingrid’s budget line, the 
consumption bundles available to her when she spends all of her income, with 
the equation:
(10A-7) (QR × PR) + (QM × PM) = N
where N stands for Ingrid’s income. To find the slope of the budget line, we divide 
its vertical intercept (where the budget line hits the vertical axis) by its horizontal 
intercept (where it hits the horizontal axis). The vertical intercept is the point at 
which Ingrid spends all her income on restaurant meals and none on housing 
(that is, QR = 0). In that case the number of restaurant meals she consumes is:
(10A-8)  QM = N/PM = $2,400/($30 per meal) = 80 meals 
= Vertical intercept of budget line
At the other extreme, Ingrid spends all her income on housing and none on 
restaurant meals (so that QM = 0). This means that at the horizontal intercept of 
the budget line, the number of rooms she consumes is:
(10A-9)  QR = N/PR = $2,400/($150 per room) = 16 rooms 
= Horizontal intercept of budget line
The tangency condition between 
the indifference curve and the 
budget line holds when the 
indifference curve and the budget 
line just touch. This condition 
determines the optimal consumption 
bundle when the indifference curves 
have the typical convex shape.

Now we have the information needed to find the slope of the budget line. It is:
(10A-10)  Slope of budget line = −(Vertical intercept)/(Horizontal intercept) 
 
= − 
N
PM
N
PR
 = − PR
PM
Notice the minus sign in Equation 10A-10; it’s there because the budget line 
slopes downward. The quantity PR/PM is known as the relative price of rooms 
in terms of restaurant meals, to distinguish it from an ordinary price in terms 
of dollars. Because buying one more room requires Ingrid to give up PR/PM 
quantity of restaurant meals, or 5 meals, we can interpret the relative price 
PR/PM as the rate at which a room trades for restaurant meals in the market; 
it is the price—in terms of restaurant meals—Ingrid has to “pay” to get one 
more room.
Looking at this another way, the slope of the budget line—minus the relative 
price—tells us the opportunity cost of each good in terms of the other. The rela-
tive price illustrates the opportunity cost to an individual of consuming one more 
unit of one good in terms of how much of the other good in his or her consump-
tion bundle must be forgone. This opportunity cost arises from the consumer’s 
limited resources—his or her limited budget. It’s useful to note that Equations 
10A-8, 10A-9, and 10A-10 give us all the information we need about what happens 
to the budget line when relative price or income changes. From Equations 10A-8 
and 10A-9 we can see that a change in income, N, leads to a parallel shift of the 
budget line: both the vertical and horizontal intercepts will shift. That is, how far 
out the budget line is from the origin depends on the consumer’s income. If a con-
sumer’s income rises, the budget line moves outward. If the consumer’s income 
shrinks, the budget line shifts inward. In each case, the slope of the budget line 
stays the same because the relative price of one good in terms of the other does 
not change.
In contrast, a change in the relative price PR/PM will lead to a change in the 
slope of the budget line. We’ll analyze these changes in the budget line and how 
the optimal consumption bundle changes when the relative price changes or 
when income changes in greater detail later in the appendix.
Prices and the Marginal Rate of Substitution
Now we’re ready to bring together the slope of the budget line and the slope of the 
indifference curve to find the optimal consumption bundle. From Equation 10A-
6, we know that the slope of the indifference curve at any point is equal to minus 
the marginal rate of substitution:
(10A-11) Slope of indifference curve = − MU R
MUM
As we’ve already noted, at the optimal consumption bundle the slope of the 
budget line and the slope of the indifference curve are equal. We can write this 
formally by putting Equations 10A-10 and 10A-11 together, which gives us the 
relative price rule for finding the optimal consumption bundle:
(10A-12) At the optimal consumption bundle: − MU R
MUM
 = − P R
PM
 
or MU R
MUM
 = P R
PM
The relative price of good R in 
terms of good M is equal to PR/PM, 
the rate at which R trades for M in 
the market.
The relative price rule says that 
at the optimal consumption bundle, 
the marginal rate of substitution 
between two goods is equal to their 
relative price.

302    P A R T  5   T H E C O N S U M E R
That is, at the optimal consumption bundle, the marginal rate of substitu-
tion between any two goods is equal to the ratio of their prices. Or to put it in 
a more intuitive way, at Ingrid’s optimal consumption bundle, the rate at which 
she would trade a room in exchange for having fewer restaurant meals along her 
indifference curve, MUR/MUM, is equal to the rate at which rooms are traded for 
restaurant meals in the market, PR/PM.
What would happen if this equality did not hold? We can see by examining 
Figure 10A-7. There, at point B, the slope of the indifference curve, −MUR/MUM, is 
greater in absolute value than the slope of the budget line, −PR/PM. This means that, 
at B, Ingrid values an additional room in place of meals more than it costs her to 
buy an additional room and forgo some meals. As a result, Ingrid would be bet-
ter off moving down her budget line toward A, consuming more rooms and fewer 
restaurant meals—and because of that, B could not have been her optimal bundle! 
Likewise, at C, the slope of Ingrid’s indifference curve is less than the slope of the 
budget line. The implication is that, at C, Ingrid values additional meals in place 
of a room more than it costs her to buy additional meals and forgo a room. Again, 
Ingrid would be better off moving along her budget line—consuming more restau-
rant meals and fewer rooms—until she reaches A, her optimal consumption bundle.
Understanding the Relative Price Rule
10A-7
The relative price of rooms in terms of restaurant 
meals is equal to minus the slope of the budget 
line. The marginal rate of substitution of rooms 
in place of restaurant meals is equal to minus 
the slope of the indifference curve. The relative 
price rule says that at the optimal consumption 
bundle, the marginal rate of substitution must 
equal the relative price. This point can be dem-
onstrated by considering what happens when 
the marginal rate of substitution is not equal to 
the relative price. At consumption bundle B, the 
marginal rate of substitution is larger than the 
relative price; Ingrid can increase her total utility 
by moving down her budget line, BL. At C, the 
marginal rate of substitution is smaller than the 
relative price, and Ingrid can increase her total 
utility by moving up the budget line. Only at A, 
where the relative price rule holds, is her total 
utility maximized given her budget constraint.

But suppose that we do the following transformation to the last term of

relative price rule becomes (from Chapter 10, Equation 10-3): 
(10A-13) Optimal consumption rule: MUR
PR  = MUM

So using either the optimal consumption rule (from Chapter 10) or the relative 
price rule (from this appendix), we find the same optimal consumption bundle.
Preferences and Choices
Now that we have seen how to represent optimal consumption choice in an indif-
ference curve diagram, we can turn briefly to the relationship between consumer 
preferences and consumer choices.

C H A P T E R  1 0  A P P E N D I X    C O N S U M E R  P R E F E R E N C E S  A N D  C O N S U M E R  C H O I C E    303
When we say that two consumers have different preferences, we mean that 
they have different utility functions. This in turn means that they will have indif-
ference curve maps with different shapes. And those different maps will trans-
late into different consumption choices, even among consumers with the same 
income and who face the same prices.
To see this, suppose that Ingrid’s friend Lars also consumes only housing and 
restaurant meals. However, Lars has a stronger preference for restaurant meals 
and a weaker preference for housing. This difference in preferences is shown 
in Figure 10A-8, which shows two sets of indifference curves: panel (a) shows 
Ingrid’s preferences and panel (b) shows Lars’s preferences. Note the difference 
in their shapes.
Suppose, as before, that rooms cost $150 per month and restaurant meals 
cost $30. Let’s also assume that both Ingrid and Lars have incomes of $2,400 
per month, giving them identical budget lines. Nonetheless, because they have 
different preferences, they will make different consumption choices, as shown 
in Figure 10A-8. Ingrid will choose 8 rooms and 40 restaurant meals; Lars will 
choose 4 rooms and 60 restaurant meals.
Differences in Preferences
10A-8
Ingrid and Lars have different preferences, 
reflected in the different shapes of their indiffer-
ence curve maps. So they will choose different 
consumption bundles even when they have the 
same possible choices. Both of them have an 
income of $2,400 per month and face prices 
of $30 per meal and $150 per room. Panel (a) 
shows Ingrid’s consumption choice: 8 rooms 
and 40 restaurant meals. Panel (b) shows Lars’s 
choice: even though he has the same budget 
line, he consumes fewer rooms and more res-
taurant meals.

Using Indifference Curves: Substitutes 
and Complements
Now that we’ve seen how to analyze consumer choice using indifference curves, 
we can get some payoffs from our new technique. First up is a new insight into 
the distinction between substitutes and complements.
Back in Chapter 3, we pointed out that the price of one good often affects the 
demand for another but that the direction of this effect can go either way: a rise 
in the price of tea increases the demand for coffee, but a rise in the price of cream 
reduces the demand for coffee. Tea and coffee are substitutes; cream and coffee 
are complements.
But what determines whether two goods are substitutes or complements? 
It depends on the shape of a consumer’s indifference curves. This relationship 
can be illustrated with two extreme cases: the cases of perfect substitutes and 
perfect complements.
Perfect Substitutes
Consider Cokie, who likes cookies. She isn’t particular: it doesn’t matter to her 
whether she has 3 peanut butter cookies and 7 chocolate chip cookies, or vice 
versa. What would her indifference curves between peanut butter and chocolate 
chip cookies look like?
The answer is that they would be straight lines like I1 and I2 in Figure 10A-9. 
For example, I1 shows that any combination of peanut butter cookies and choco-
late chip cookies that adds up to 10 cookies yields Cokie the same utility.
A consumer whose indifference curves are straight lines is always willing to 
substitute the same amount of one good in place of one unit of the other, regard-
less of how much of either good he or she consumes. Cokie, for example, is always 
willing to accept one less peanut butter cookie in exchange for one more choco-
late chip cookie, making her marginal rate of substitution constant.
When indifference curves are straight lines, we say that goods are perfect 
substitutes. When two goods are perfect substitutes, there is only one relative 
Perfect Substitutes
10A-9
Two goods are perfect substitutes when the 
marginal rate of substitution does not depend 
on the quantities consumed. In that case, the 
indifference curves are straight lines.

of each an individual consumes.

price at which consumers will be willing to purchase both goods; a slightly higher 
or lower relative price will cause consumers to buy only one of the two goods.
Figure 10A-10 illustrates this point. The indifference curves are the same 
as those in Figure 10A-9, but now we include Cokie’s budget line, BL. In each 
panel we assume that Cokie has $12 to spend. In panel (a) we assume that 
chocolate chip cookies cost $1.20 and peanut butter cookies cost $1.00. Cokie’s 
optimal consumption bundle is then at point A: she buys 12 peanut butter 
cookies and no chocolate chip cookies. In panel (b) the situation is reversed: 
chocolate chip cookies cost $1.00 and peanut butter cookies cost $1.20. In this 
case, her optimal consumption is at point B, where she consumes only choco-
late chip cookies.
Why does such a small change in the price cause Cokie to switch all her con-
sumption from one good to the other? Because her marginal rate of substitution 
is constant and therefore doesn’t depend on the composition of her consumption 
bundle. If the relative price of chocolate chip cookies is more than the marginal 
rate of substitution of chocolate chip cookies in place of peanut butter cookies, 
she buys only peanut butter cookies; if it is less, she buys only chocolate chip. 
And if the relative price of chocolate chip cookies is equal to the marginal rate of 
substitution, Cokie can maximize her utility by buying any bundle on her budget 
line. That is, she will be equally happy with any combination of chocolate chip 
cookies and peanut butter cookies that she can afford. As a result, in this case we 
cannot predict which particular bundle she will choose among all the bundles 
that lie on her budget line.

cookies is slightly higher than the marginal rate of sub-
stitution of chocolate chip cookies in place of peanut 
butter cookies; this is enough to induce Cokie to choose 
consumption bundle A, which consists entirely of peanut 
butter cookies. In panel (b), the relative price of choco-
late chip cookies is slightly lower than the marginal rate 
of substitution of chocolate chip cookies in place of 
peanut butter cookies; this induces Cokie to choose 
bundle B, consisting entirely of chocolate chip cookies.

Perfect Complements
The case of perfect substitutes represents one extreme form of consumer prefer-
ences; the case of perfect complements represents the other. Goods are perfect 
complements when a consumer wants to consume two goods in the same ratio, 
regardless of their relative price.
Suppose that Aaron likes cookies and milk—but only together. An extra cookie 
without an extra glass of milk yields no additional utility; neither does an extra 
glass of milk without another cookie. In this case, his indifference curves will 
form right angles, as shown in Figure 10A-11.
To see why, consider the three bundles labeled A, B, and C. At B, on I4, Aaron 
consumes 4 cookies and 4 glasses of milk. At A, he consumes 4 cookies and 5 
glasses of milk; but the extra glass of milk adds nothing to his utility. So A is on 
the same indifference curve as B, I4. Similarly, at C he consumes 5 cookies and 4 
glasses of milk, but this yields the same total utility as 4 cookies and 4 glasses of 
milk. So C is also on the same indifference curve, I4.
Also shown in Figure 10A-11 is a budget line that would allow Aaron to choose 
bundle B. The important point is that the slope of the budget line has no effect on 
his relative consumption of cookies and milk. This means that he will always con-
sume the two goods in the same proportions regardless of prices—which makes 
the goods perfect complements.
Perfect Complements
10A-11
When two goods are perfect comple-
ments, a consumer wants to consume the 
goods in the same ratio regardless of their 
relative price. Indifference curves take the 
form of right angles. In this case, Aaron 
will choose to consume 4 glasses of milk 
and 4 cookies (bundle B) regardless 
of the slope of the budget line passing 
through B. The reason is that neither an 
additional glass of milk without an addi-
tional cookie (bundle A) nor an additional 
cookie without an additional glass of milk 
(bundle C) adds to his total utility.

You may be wondering what happened to the marginal rate of substi-
tution in Figure 10A-11. That is, exactly what is Aaron’s marginal rate of 
substitution between cookies and milk, given that he is unwilling to make 
any substitutions between them? The answer is that in the case of perfect 
complements, the marginal rate of substitution is undefined because an indi-
vidual’s preferences don’t allow any substitution between goods.
Less Extreme Cases
There are real - world examples of pairs of goods that are very close to being perfect 
substitutes. For example, the list of ingredients on a package of Bisquick pancake mix 
says that it contains “soybean and/or cottonseed oil”: the producer uses whichever is 

C H A P T E R  1 0  A P P E N D I X    C O N S U M E R  P R E F E R E N C E S  A N D  C O N S U M E R  C H O I C E    307
cheaper, since consumers can’t tell the difference. There are other pairs of goods that 
are very close to being perfect complements—for example, cars and tires.
In most cases, however, the possibilities for substitution lie somewhere 
between these extremes. In some cases it isn’t easy to be sure whether goods are 
substitutes or complements.
Prices, Income, and Demand
Let’s return now to Ingrid’s consumption choices. In the situation we’ve consid-
ered, her income was $2,400 per month, housing cost $150 per room, and res-
taurant meals cost $30 each. Her optimal consumption bundle, as seen in Figure 
10A-7, contained 8 rooms and 40 restaurant meals.
Let’s now ask how her consumption choice would change if either the rent per 
room or her income changed. As we’ll see, we can put these pieces together to 
deepen our understanding of consumer demand.
The Effects of a Price Increase
Suppose that for some reason there is a sharp increase in housing prices. Ingrid 
must now pay $600 per room instead of $150. Meanwhile, the price of restaurant 
meals and her income remain unchanged. How does this change affect her con-
sumption choices?
When the price of rooms rises, the relative price of rooms in terms of restau-
rant meals rises; as a result, Ingrid’s budget line changes (for the worse—but we’ll 
get to that). She responds to that change by choosing a new consumption bundle.
Figure 10A-12 shows Ingrid’s original (BL1) and new (BL2) budget lines—
again, under the assumption that her income remains constant at $2,400 per 
month. With housing costing $150 per room and a restaurant meal costing $30, 
her budget line, BL1, intersected the horizontal axis at 16 rooms and the vertical 
axis at 80 restaurant meals. After the price of a room rises to $600 per room, the 
budget line, BL2, still hits the vertical axis at 80 restaurant meals, but it hits the 
horizontal axis at only 4 rooms. That’s because we know from Equation (10A-9) 
that the new horizontal intercept of the budget line is now $2,400/$600 = 4. Her 
Effects of a Price Increase on the Budget Line
10A-12
An increase in the price of rooms, holding the 
price of restaurant meals constant, increases 
the relative price of rooms in terms of restau-
rant meals. As a result, Ingrid’s original budget 
line, BL1, rotates inward to BL2. Her maximum 
possible purchase of restaurant meals is 
unchanged, but her maximum possible pur-
chase of rooms is reduced.

budget line has rotated inward and become steeper, reflecting the new, higher 
relative price of a room in terms of restaurant meals.
Figure 10A-13 shows how Ingrid responds to her new circumstances. Her 
original optimal consumption bundle consists of 8 rooms and 40 meals. After her 
budget line rotates in response to the change in relative price, she finds her new 
optimal consumption bundle by choosing the point on BL2 that brings her to as 
high an indifference curve as possible. At the new optimal consumption bundle, 
she consumes fewer rooms and more restaurant meals than before: 1 room and 
60 restaurant meals.
Why does Ingrid’s consumption of rooms fall? Part—but only part—of the 
reason is that the rise in the price of rooms reduces her purchasing power, mak-
ing her poorer. That is, the higher relative price of rooms rotates her budget line 
inward toward the origin, reducing her consumption possibilities and putting her 
on a lower indifference curve. In a sense, when she faces a higher price of hous-
ing, it’s as if her income declined.
To understand this effect, and to see why it isn’t the whole story, let’s consider 
a different change in Ingrid’s circumstances: a change in her income.
Income and Consumption
In Chapter 3 we learned about the individual demand curve, which shows how 
a consumer’s consumption choice will change as the price of one good changes, 
holding income and the prices of other goods constant. That is, movement along 
the individual demand curve primarily shows the substitution effect, as we 
learned in Chapter 10—how quantity consumed changes in response to changes 
in the relative price of the two goods. But we can also ask how the consumption 
choice will change if income changes, holding relative price constant.
Before we proceed, it’s important to understand how a change in income, hold-
ing relative price constant, affects the budget line. Suppose that Ingrid’s income 
fell from $2,400 to $1,200 and we hold prices constant at $150 per room and $30

per restaurant meal. As a result, the maximum number of rooms she can afford 
drops from 16 to 8, and the maximum number of restaurant meals drops from 80 
to 40. In other words, Ingrid’s consumption possibilities have shrunk, as shown by 
the parallel inward shift of the budget line in Figure 10A-14 from BL1 to BL2. It’s 
a parallel shift because the slope of the budget line—the relative price—remains 
unchanged when income changes. Alternatively, suppose Ingrid’s income rises 
from $2,400 to $3,000. She can now afford a maximum of 20 rooms or 100 meals, 
leading to a parallel outward shift of the budget line—the shift from BL1 to BL3 in 
Figure 10A-14. In this case, Ingrid’s consumption possibilities have expanded.
Effect of a Change in Income on the Budget Line
10A-14
When relative prices are held constant, the 
budget line shifts parallel in response to 
changes in income. For example, if Ingrid’s 
income falls from $2,400 to $1,200, she is 
clearly worse off: her budget line shifts inward 
from BL1 to its new position at BL2. In contrast, 
if Ingrid’s income rises from $2,400 to $3,000, 
she is clearly better off: her budget line shifts 
outward from BL1 to its new position at BL3.

FIGURE
Now we are ready to consider how Ingrid responds to a direct change in 
income—that is, a change in her income level holding relative price constant. Figure 
10A-15 compares Ingrid’s budget line and optimal consumption choice at an income 
of $2,400 per month (BL1) with her budget line and optimal consumption choice 
at an income of $1,200 per month (BL2), keeping prices constant at $150 per room 
and $30 per restaurant meal. Point A is Ingrid’s optimal consumption bundle at an 
income of $2,400, and point B is her optimal consumption bundle at an income of 
$1,200. In each case, her optimal consumption bundle is given by the point at which 
the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve. As you can see, at the lower 
income her budget line shifts inward compared to her budget line at the higher 
income but maintains the same slope because relative price has not changed. 
This means that she must reduce her consumption of either housing or restau-
rant meals, or both. As a result, she is at a lower level of total utility, represented 
by a lower indifference curve.
As it turns out, Ingrid chooses to consume less of both goods when her income 
falls: as her income goes from $2,400 to $1,200, her consumption of housing falls 
from 8 to 4 rooms and her consumption of restaurant meals falls from 40 to 20. 
This is because in her utility function both goods are normal goods, as defined in 
Chapter 3: goods for which demand increases when income rises and for which 
demand decreases when income falls.
Although most goods are normal goods, we also pointed out in Chapter 6 that 
some goods are inferior goods, goods for which demand moves in the opposite 

310    P A R T  5   T H E C O N S U M E R
direction to the change in income: demand decreases when income rises, and 
demand increases when income falls. An example might be second - hand furni-
ture. Whether a good is an inferior good depends on the consumer’s indifference 
curve map. Figure 10A-16 illustrates such a case, where second - hand furniture

At a monthly income of $2,400, Ingrid

relative price remains unchanged, a fall 
in income shifts her budget line inward 
to BL2. At a monthly income of $1,200, 
she chooses bundle B, consisting of 4 
rooms and 20 restaurant meals. Since 
Ingrid’s consumption of both restau-
rant meals and rooms falls when her 
income falls, both goods are normal 
goods.

(BL2), and her optimal consumption bundle goes from D to E, her consumption 
of second - hand furniture increases—implying that second - hand furniture is an 
inferior good. Simultaneously, her consumption of restaurant meals decreases—
implying that restaurant meals are a normal good.
Income and Substitution Effects
Now that we have examined the effects of a change in income, we can return to 
the issue of a change in price—and show in a more specific way that the effect of 
a higher price on demand has an income component.
Figure 10A-17 shows, once again, Ingrid’s original (BL1) and new (BL2) budget 
lines and consumption choices with a monthly income of $2,400. At a housing 
price of $150 per room, Ingrid chooses the consumption bundle at A; at a housing 
price of $600 per room, she chooses the consumption bundle at C.
Let’s notice again what happens to Ingrid’s budget line after the increase in 
the price of housing. It continues to hit the vertical axis at 80 restaurant meals; 
that is, if Ingrid were to spend all her income on restaurant meals, the increase 
in the price of housing would not affect her. But the new budget line hits the 
horizontal axis at only 4 rooms. So the budget line has rotated, shifting inward 
and becoming steeper, as a consequence of the rise in the relative price of rooms.
We already know what happens: Ingrid’s consumption of housing falls from 
8 rooms to 1 room. But the figure suggests that there are two reasons for the fall 
in Ingrid’s housing consumption. One reason she consumes fewer rooms is that, 
because of the higher relative price of rooms, the opportunity cost of a room mea-
sured in restaurant meals—the quantity of restaurant meals she must give up to 
consume an additional room—has increased. This change in opportunity cost, 
which is reflected in the steeper slope of the budget line, gives her an incentive to 
substitute restaurant meals in place of rooms in her consumption.
But the other reason Ingrid consumes fewer rooms after their price increases is 
that the rise in the price of rooms makes her poorer. True, her money income hasn’t 
Income and Substitution Effects
10A-17
The movement from Ingrid’s original optimal 
consumption bundle when the price of rooms is 
$150, A, to her new optimal consumption bundle 
when the price of rooms is $600, C, can be 
decomposed into two parts. The movement from 
A to B—the movement along the original indif-
ference curve, I2, as relative price changes—is 
the pure substitution effect. It captures how her 
consumption would change if she were given a 
hypothetical increase in income that just com-
pensates her for the increase in the price of 
rooms so that her total utility is unchanged. The 
movement from B to C, the change in consump-
tion when we remove that hypothetical income 
compensation, is the income effect of the price 
increase—how her consumption changes as a 
result of the fall in her purchasing power.

changed. But she must pay more for rooms, and as a result her budget line has rotat-
ed inward. So she cannot reach the same level of total utility as before, meaning that 
her real income has fallen. That is why she ends up on a lower indifference curve.
In the real world, these effects—an increase in the price of a good raises its 
opportunity cost and also makes consumers poorer—usually go together. But in 
our imagination we can separate them. In Chapter 10 we introduced the distinc-
tion between the substitution effect of a price change (the change in consumption 
that arises from the substitution of the good that is now relatively cheaper in 
place of the good that is now relatively more expensive) and the income effect (the 
change in consumption caused by the change in purchasing power arising from 
a price change). Now we can show these two effects more clearly.
To isolate the substitution effect, let’s temporarily change the story about why 
Ingrid faces an increase in rent: it’s not that housing has become more expensive, 
it’s the fact that she has moved from Cincinnati to San Jose, where rents are higher. 
But let’s consider a hypothetical scenario—let’s suppose momentarily that she 
earns more in San Jose and that the higher income is just enough to compensate her 
for the higher price of housing, so that her total utility is exactly the same as before.
Figure 10A-17 shows her situation before and after the move. The bundle 
labeled A represents Ingrid’s original consumption choice: 8 rooms and 40 res-
taurant meals. When she moves to San Jose, she faces a higher price of housing, 
so her budget line becomes steeper. But we have just assumed that her move 
increases her income by just enough to compensate for the higher price of hous-
ing—that is, just enough to let her reach the original indifference curve. So her 
new hypothetical optimal consumption bundle is at B, where the steeper dashed 
hypothetical budget line (BLS) is just tangent to the original indifference curve 
(I2). By assuming that we have compensated Ingrid for the loss in purchasing 
power due to the increase in the price of housing, we isolate the pure substitution 
effect of the change in relative price on her consumption.
At B, Ingrid’s consumption bundle contains 2 rooms and 120 restaurant 
meals. This costs $4,800 (2 rooms at $600 each, and 120 meals at $30 each). So if 
Ingrid faces an increase in the price of housing from $150 to $600 per room, but 
also experiences a rise in her income from $2,400 to $4,800 per month, she ends 
up with the same level of total utility.
The movement from A to B is the pure substitution effect of the price change. 
It is the effect on Ingrid’s consumption choice when we change the relative price 
of housing while keeping her total utility constant.
Now that we have isolated the substitution effect, we can bring back the 
income effect of the price change. That’s easy: we just go back to the original 
story, in which Ingrid faces an increase in the price of housing without any rise 
in income. We already know that this leads her to C in Figure 10A-17. But we can 
think of the move from A to C as taking place in two steps. First, Ingrid moves 
from A to B, the substitution effect of the change in relative price. Then we take 
away the extra income needed to keep her on the original indifference curve, 
causing her to move to C. The movement from B to C is the additional change 
in Ingrid’s demand that results because the increase in housing prices actually 
reduces her utility. So this is the income effect of the price change.
We can use Figure 10A-17 to confirm that rooms are a normal good in Ingrid’s 
preferences. For normal goods, the income effect and the substitution effect work 
in the same direction: a price increase induces a fall in quantity consumed by 
the substitution effect (the move from A to B) and a fall in quantity consumed by 
the income effect (the move from B to C). That’s why demand curves for normal 
goods always slope downward.
What would have happened as a result of the increase in the price of housing 
if, instead of being a normal good, rooms had been an inferior good for Ingrid? 
First, the movement from A to B depicted in Figure 10A-17, the substitution effect, 
would remain unchanged. But an income change causes quantity consumed to 

C H A P T E R  1 0  A P P E N D I X    C O N S U M E R  P R E F E R E N C E S  A N D  C O N S U M E R  C H O I C E    313
move in the opposite direction for an inferior good. So the movement from B to 
C shown in Figure 10A-17, the income effect for a normal good, would no longer 
hold. Instead, the income effect for an inferior good would cause Ingrid’s quantity 
of rooms consumed to increase from B—say, to a bundle consisting of 3 rooms 
and 20 restaurant meals.
In the end, the demand curves for inferior goods normally slope downward: 
if Ingrid consumes 3 rooms after the increase in the price of housing, it is still 5 
fewer rooms than she consumed before. So although the income effect moves in 
the opposite direction of the substitution effect in the case of an inferior good, in 
this example the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect.
But what if there existed a type of inferior good in which the income effect 
is so strong that it dominates the substitution effect? Would a demand curve for 
that good then slope upward—that is, would quantity demanded increase when 
price increases? The answer is yes: you have encountered such a good already—it 
is called a Giffen good, and it was described in For Inquiring Minds in Chapter 10. 
As we noted there, Giffen goods are rare creatures, but they cannot be ruled out.
Is the distinction between income and substitution effects important in practice? 
For analyzing the demand for goods, the answer is that it usually isn’t that important. 
However, in Chapter 19 we’ll discuss how individuals make decisions about how much 
of their labor to supply to employers. In that case income and substitution effects 
work in opposite directions, and the distinction between them becomes crucial.

 d.  Isabella can consume two goods: skis and bindings. 
For each ski she wants exactly one binding. Be sure 
to label and number the axes of your diagram. Place 
bindings on the horizontal axis and skis on the verti-
cal axis.
 e.  Isabella gets utility from consuming soda. But 
she gets no utility from consuming water: any 
more, or any less, water leaves her total utility level 
unchanged. Be sure to label the axes of your dia-
gram. Place water on the horizontal axis and soda 
on the vertical axis.
 2. Use the four properties of indifference curves for ordi-
nary goods illustrated in Figure 10A-4 to answer the 
following questions.
 a. Can you rank the following two bundles? If so, 
which property of indifference curves helps you 
rank them?
 Bundle A: 2 movie tickets and 3 cafeteria meals
 Bundle B: 4 movie tickets and 8 cafeteria meals
 b.  Can you rank the following two bundles? If so, 
which property of indifference curves helps you 
rank them?
 Bundle A: 2 movie tickets and 3 cafeteria meals
 Bundle B: 4 movie tickets and 3 cafeteria meals
 c.  Can you rank the following two bundles? If so, 
which property of indifference curves helps you 
rank them?
 Bundle A: 12 videos and 4 bags of chips
 Bundle B: 5 videos and 10 bags of chips
 d.  Suppose you are indifferent between the following 
two bundles:
 Bundle A: 10 breakfasts and 4 dinners
 Bundle B: 4 breakfasts and 10 dinners
 Now compare bundle A and the following bundle:
 Bundle C: 7 breakfasts and 7 dinners
  Can you rank bundle A and bundle C? If so, which 
property of indifference curves helps you rank them? 
(Hint: It may help if you draw this, placing dinners 
on the horizontal axis and breakfasts on the vertical 
axis. And remember that breakfasts and dinners are 
ordinary goods.)
 3. The four properties of indifference curves for ordi-
nary goods illustrated in Figure 10A-4 rule out certain 
indifference curves. Determine whether those general

 4. Restaurant meals and housing (measured by the num-
ber of rooms) are the only two goods that Neha can buy. 
She has income of $1,000, and the price of each room is 
$100. The relative price of 1 room in terms of restaurant 
meals is 5. How many restaurant meals can she buy if 
she spends all her money on them?
 5. Answer the following questions based on two assump-
tions: (1) Inflation increases the prices of all goods by 20%.
(2) Ina’s income increases from $50,000 to $55,000.
 a. Has Ina’s budget line become steeper, less steep, or 
equally as steep?
 b. Has Ina’s budget line shifted outward, inward, or 
not at all?
 6. Kory has an income of $50, which she can spend on two 
goods: CDs and cups of hot chocolate. Both are normal 
goods for her. Each CD costs $10, and each cup of hot 
chocolate costs $2. For each of the following situations, 
decide whether this is Kory’s optimal consumption bun-
dle. If not, what should Kory do to achieve her optimal 
consumption bundle?
 a. Kory is considering buying 4 CDs and 5 cups of hot 
chocolate. At that bundle, her marginal rate of sub-
stitution of CDs in place of hot chocolate is 1; that 
is, she would be willing to forgo only 1 cup of hot 
chocolate to acquire 1 CD.
 b. Kory is considering buying 2 CDs and 15 cups of hot 
chocolate. Kory’s marginal utility of the second CD 
is 25, and her marginal utility of the fifteenth cup of 
hot chocolate is 5.
 c. Kory is considering buying 1 CD and 10 cups of hot 
chocolate. At that bundle, her marginal rate of sub-
stitution of CDs in place of hot chocolate is 5; that is, 
she would be just willing to exchange 5 cups of hot 
chocolate for 1 CD.
 7. Raul has 4 Cal Ripken and 2 Nolan Ryan baseball 
cards. The prices of these baseball cards are $24 for Cal 
and $12 for Nolan. Raul, however, would be willing to 
exchange 1 Cal card for 1 Nolan card.
 a. What is Raul’s marginal rate of substitution of Cal 
Ripken in place of Nolan Ryan baseball cards?
 b. Can Raul buy and sell baseball cards to make him-
self better off? How?
 c. Suppose Raul has traded baseball cards and after 
trading still has some of each kind of card. Also, he 
now no longer wants to make any more trades. What 
is his marginal rate of substitution of Cal Ripken in 
place of Nolan Ryan cards now?
 8. Ralph and Lauren are talking about how much they 
like going to the gym and how much they like eating 
out at their favorite restaurant and they regularly do 
some of each. A session at the gym costs the same as a 
meal at the restaurant. Ralph says that, for his current 
consumption of gym sessions and restaurant meals, he 
values 1 more meal twice as much as he values 1 more 
session at the gym. Lauren is studying economics, and 
she tells him that his current consumption bundle can-
not be optimal.
 a. Is Lauren right? Why or why not? Draw a diagram 
of Ralph’s budget line and the indifference curve 
that he is on by making his current consumption

choice. Place restaurant meals on the horizontal axis 
and gym sessions on the vertical axis.
 b. How should Ralph adjust his consumption so that it is 
optimal? Illustrate an optimal choice in your diagram.
 9. Sabine can’t tell the difference between Coke and 
Pepsi—the two taste exactly the same to her.
 a. What is Sabine’s marginal rate of substitution of 
Coke in place of Pepsi?
 b. Draw a few of Sabine’s indifference curves for Coke 
and Pepsi. Place Coke on the horizontal axis and 
Pepsi on the vertical axis.
 c. Sabine has $6 to spend on cola this week. Coke costs 
$1.50 per six - pack and Pepsi costs $1.00. Draw Sabine’s 
budget line for Coke and Pepsi on the same diagram.
 d. What is Sabine’s optimal consumption bundle? 
Show this on your diagram.
 e. If the price of Coke and Pepsi is the same, what 
combination of Coke and Pepsi will Sabine buy?
 10. For Norma, both nachos and salsa are normal goods. 
They are also ordinary goods for Norma. The price of 
nachos rises, but the price of salsa remains unchanged.
 a. Can you determine definitively whether she con-
sumes more or fewer nachos? Explain with a dia-
gram, placing nachos on the horizontal axis and 
salsa on the vertical axis.
 b. Can you determine definitively whether she con-
sumes more or less salsa? Explain with a diagram, 
placing nachos on the horizontal axis and salsa on 
the vertical axis.
 11. Tyrone is a utility maximizer. His income is $100, which 
he can spend on cafeteria meals and on notepads. Each 
meal costs $5, and each notepad costs $2. At these prices 
Tyrone chooses to buy 16 cafeteria meals and 10 notepads.
 a. Draw a diagram that shows Tyrone’s choice using 
an indifference curve and his budget line, placing 
notepads on the vertical axis and cafeteria meals on 
the horizontal axis. Label the indifference curve I1 
and the budget line BL1.
 b. The price of notepads falls to $1; the price of cafete-
ria meals remains the same. On the same diagram, 
draw Tyrone’s budget line with the new prices and 
label it BLH.
 c. Lastly, Tyrone’s income falls to $90. On the same 
diagram, draw his budget line with this income and 
the new prices and label it BL2. Is he worse off, bet-
ter off, or equally as well off with these new prices 
and lower income than compared to the original 
prices and higher income? (Hint: Determine whether 
Tyrone can afford to buy his original consumption 
bundle of 16 meals and 10 notepads with the lower 
income and new prices.) Illustrate your answer 
using an indifference curve and label it I2.
 d. Give an intuitive explanation of your answer to part c.
 12. Gus spends his income on gas for his car and food. The 
government raises the tax on gas, thereby raising the 
price of gas. But the government also lowers the income 
tax, thereby increasing Gus’s income. And this rise in 
income is just enough to place Gus on the same indif-
ference curve as the one he was on before the price of 
gas rose. Will Gus buy more, less, or the same amount 
of gas as before these changes? Illustrate your answer 
with a diagram, placing gas on the horizontal axis and 
food on the vertical axis.
 13. Pam spends her money on bread and Spam, and her 
indifference curves obey the four properties of indiffer-
ence curves for ordinary goods. Suppose that, for Pam, 
Spam is an inferior, but not a Giffen, good; bread is a 
normal good. Bread costs $2 per loaf, and Spam costs 
$2 per can. Pam has $20 to spend.
 a. Draw a diagram of Pam’s budget line, placing Spam 
on the horizontal axis and bread on the vertical axis. 
Suppose her optimal consumption bundle is 4 cans 
of Spam and 6 loaves of bread. Illustrate that bundle 
and draw the indifference curve on which it lies.
 b. The price of Spam falls to $1; the price of bread 
remains the same. Pam now buys 7 loaves of bread 
and 6 cans of Spam. Illustrate her new budget line 
and new optimal consumption bundle in your dia-
gram. Also draw the indifference curve on which 
this bundle lies.
 c. In your diagram, show the income and substitu-
tion effects from this fall in the price of Spam. 
Remember that Spam is an inferior good for Pam.
 14. Katya commutes to work. She can either use public trans-
port or her own car. Her indifference curves obey the four 
properties of indifference curves for ordinary goods.
 a. Draw Katya’s budget line with car travel on the verti-
cal axis and public transport on the horizontal axis. 
Suppose that Katya consumes some of both goods. 
Draw an indifference curve that helps you illustrate 
her optimal consumption bundle.
 b. Now the price of public transport falls. Draw Katya’s 
new budget line.
 c. For Katya, public transport is an inferior, but not a 
Giffen, good. Draw an indifference curve that illus-
trates her optimal consumption bundle after the 
price of public transport has fallen. Is Katya con-
suming more or less public transport?
 d. Show the income and substitution effects from this 
fall in the price of public transport.
 15. For Crandall, cheese cubes and crackers are perfect 
complements: he wants to consume exactly 1 cheese 
cube with each cracker. He has $2.40 to spend on cheese 
and crackers. One cheese cube costs 20 cents, and 1 
cracker costs 10 cents. Draw a diagram, with crackers 
on the horizontal axis and cheese cubes on the vertical 
axis, to answer the following questions.
 a. Which bundle will Crandall consume?
 b. The price of crackers rises to 20 cents. How many 
cheese cubes and how many crackers will Crandall 
consume?
 c. Show the income and substitution effects from this 
price rise.

 16. Carmen consumes nothing but cafeteria meals and 
CDs. Her indifference curves exhibit the four general 
properties of indifference curves. Cafeteria meals cost 
$5 each, and CDs cost $10. Carmen has $50 to spend.
 a. Draw Carmen’s budget line and an indifference 
curve that illustrates her optimal consumption bun-
dle. Place cafeteria meals on the horizontal axis and 
CDs on the vertical axis. You do not have enough 
information to know the specific tangency point, so 
choose one arbitrarily.
 b. Now Carmen’s income rises to $100. Draw her new 
budget line on the same diagram, as well as an 
indifference curve that illustrates her optimal con-
sumption bundle. Assume that cafeteria meals are 
an inferior good.
 c. Can you draw an indifference curve showing that 
cafeteria meals and CDs are both inferior goods?
 17. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Com-
mu ni cations collects data on the prices of goods and 
services in the Ku - area of Tokyo, as well as data on 
the average Japanese household’s monthly income. The 
accompanying table shows some of this data. (¥ denotes 
the Japanese currency the yen.)

 a. For each of the two years for which you have data, 
what is the maximum number of packs of eggs that 
an average Japanese household could have consumed 
each month? The maximum number of 100-gram 
portions of tuna? In one diagram, draw the average 
Japanese household’s budget line in 2003 and in 2005.
 b. Calculate the relative price of eggs in terms of tuna 
for each year. Use the relative price rule to deter-

“O
BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS 
skies, for amber waves of 
grain.” So begins the song “America 
the Beautiful.” And those amber waves 
of grain are for real: though farmers are 
now only a small minority of America’s 
population, our agricultural industry is 
immensely productive and feeds much 
of the world.
If you look at agricultural statistics, 
however, something may seem a bit 
surprising: when it comes to yield per 
acre, U.S. farmers are often nowhere near 
the top. For example, farmers in Western 
European countries grow about three 
times as much wheat per acre as their 
U.S. counterparts. Are the Europeans 
better at growing wheat than we are?
No: European farmers are very skill-
ful, but no more so than Americans. They 
produce more wheat per acre because 
they employ more inputs—more fertilizer 
and, especially, more labor—per acre. 
Of course, this means that European 
farmers have higher costs than their 
American counterparts. But because of 
government policies, European farmers 
receive a much higher price for their 
wheat than American farmers. This gives 
them an incentive to use more inputs and 
to expend more effort at the margin to 
increase the crop yield per acre.
Notice our use of the phrase “at 
the margin.” Like most decisions that 
involve a comparison of benefits and 
costs, decisions about inputs and pro-
duction involve a comparison of margin-
al quantities—the marginal cost versus 
the marginal benefit of producing a bit 
more from each acre.
In Chapter 9 we considered the case 
of Alex, who had to choose the num ber 
of years of schooling that maximized his 
profit from schooling. There we used the 
profit-maximizing principle of marginal 
analysis to find the optimal quantity of 
years of schooling. In this chapter, we 
will encounter producers who have to 
make similar “how much” decisions: 
choosing the quantity of output pro-
duced to maximize profit.
In this chapter and in Chapter 12, 
we will show how marginal analy-
sis can be used to understand these 
output decisions—decisions that lie 
behind the supply curve. The first step 
in this analysis is to show how the rela-
tionship between a firm’s inputs and its 
output—its production function—deter-
mines its cost curves, the relationship 
between cost and quantity of output 
produced. That is what we do in this 
chapter. In Chapter 12, we will use our 
understanding of the firm’s cost curves 
to derive the individual and the market 
supply curves.

The Production Function
A 
firm is an organization that produces goods or services for sale. To do this, 
it must transform inputs into output. The quantity of output a firm pro-
duces depends on the quantity of inputs; this relationship is known as the 
firm’s production function. As we’ll see, a firm’s production function underlies 
its cost curves. As a first step, let’s look at the characteristics of a hypothetical 
production function.
Inputs and Output
To understand the concept of a production function, let’s consider a farm 
that we assume, for the sake of simplicity, produces only one output, wheat, 
and uses only two inputs, land and labor. This particular farm is owned by a 
couple named George and Martha. They hire workers to do the actual physical 
labor on the farm. Moreover, we will assume that all potential workers are of 
the same quality—they are all equally knowledgeable and capable of perform-
ing farmwork.
George and Martha’s farm sits on 10 acres of land; no more acres are avail-
able to them, and they are currently unable to either increase or decrease 
the size of their farm by selling, buying, or leasing acreage. Land here 
is what economists call a fixed input—an input whose quantity is fixed 
for a period of time and cannot be varied. George and Martha are, however, 
free to decide how many workers to hire. The labor provided by these work-
ers is called a variable input—an input whose quantity the firm can vary 
at any time.
In reality, whether or not the quantity of an input is really fixed depends on 
the time horizon. In the long run—that is, given that a long enough period of 
time has elapsed—firms can adjust the quantity of any input. For example, in the 
long run, George and Martha can vary the amount of land they farm by buying 
or selling land. So there are no fixed inputs in the long run. In contrast, the short 
run is defined as the time period during which at least one input is fixed. Later 
in this chapter, we’ll look more carefully at the distinction between the short run 
and the long run. But for now, we will restrict our attention to the short run and 
assume that at least one input is fixed.
George and Martha know that the quantity of wheat they produce depends 
on the number of workers they hire. Using modern farming techniques, one 
worker can cultivate the 10-acre farm, albeit not very intensively. When an 
additional worker is added, the land is divided equally among all the work-
ers: each worker has 5 acres to cultivate when 2 workers are employed, each 
cultivates 31⁄3 acres when 3 are employed, and so on. So as additional workers 
are employed, the 10 acres of land are cultivated more intensively and more 
bushels of wheat are produced. The relationship between the quantity of labor 
and the quantity of output, for a given amount of the fixed input, constitutes 
the farm’s production function. The production function for George and 
Martha’s farm, where land is the fixed input and labor is a variable input, is 
shown in the first two columns of the table in Figure 11-1; the diagram there 
shows the same information graphically. The curve in Figure 11-1 shows how 
the quantity of output depends on the quantity of the variable input, for a 
given quantity of the fixed input; it is called the farm’s total product curve. 
The physical quantity of output, bushels of wheat, is measured on the vertical 
axis; the quantity of the variable input, labor (that is, the number of workers 
employed), is measured on the horizontal axis. The total product curve here 
slopes upward, reflecting the fact that more bushels of wheat are produced as 
more workers are employed.
A production function is the 
relationship between the quantity of 
inputs a firm uses and the quantity of 
output it produces.
A fixed input is an input whose 
quantity is fixed for a period of time 
and cannot be varied.
A variable input is an input whose 
quantity the firm can vary at any time.
The long run is the time period in 
which all inputs can be varied.
The short run is the time period in 
which at least one input is fixed.
The total product curve shows 
how the quantity of output depends 
on the quantity of the variable input, 
for a given quantity of the fixed input.

Although the total product curve in Figure 11-1 slopes upward along its entire 
length, the slope isn’t constant: as you move up the curve to the right, it flattens 
out. To understand why the slope changes, look at the third column of the table in 
Figure 11-1, which shows the change in the quantity of output that is generated by 
adding one more worker. This is called the marginal product of labor, or MPL: the 
additional quantity of output from using one more unit of labor (where one unit of 
labor is equal to one worker). In general, the marginal product of an input is the 
additional quantity of output that is produced by using one more unit of that input.
In this example, we have data on changes in output at intervals of 1 worker. 
Sometimes data aren’t available in increments of 1 unit—for example, you might 
have information only on the quantity of output when there are 40 workers and 
when there are 50 workers. In this case, we use the following equation to calculate 
the marginal product of labor:
(11-1) 
Marginal 
product 
of labor
 = 
Change in quantity of 
output produced by one 
additional unit of labor
 = Change in quantity of output
Change in quantity of labor
or
MPL = ΔQ
ΔL 
In this equation, Δ, the Greek uppercase delta, represents the change in a variable.
Now we can explain the significance of the slope of the total product curve: 
it is equal to the marginal product of labor. The slope of a line is equal to “rise”

The table shows the production function, the relationship 
between the quantity of the variable input (labor, measured 
in number of workers) and the quantity of output (wheat, 
measured in bushels) for a given quantity of the fixed input. 
It also calculates the marginal product of labor on George 
and Martha’s farm. The total product curve shows the 
production function graphically. It slopes upward because 
more wheat is produced as more workers are employed. 
It also becomes flatter because the marginal product of 
labor declines as more and more workers are employed.
The marginal product of an input is 
the additional quantity of output that 
is produced by using one more unit 
of that input.

over “run” (see the appendix to Chapter 2). This implies that the slope of the total 
product curve is the change in the quantity of output (the “rise”, ΔQ) divided by 
the change in the quantity of labor (the “run”, ΔL). And this, as we can see from 
Equation 11-1, is simply the marginal product of labor. So in Figure 11-1, the 
fact that the marginal product of the first worker is 19 also means that the slope of 
the total product curve in going from 0 to 1 worker is 19. Similarly, the slope 
of the total product curve in going from 1 to 2 workers is the same as the mar-
ginal product of the second worker, 17, and so on.
In this example, the marginal product of labor steadily declines as more 
workers are hired—that is, each successive worker adds less to output than 
the previous worker. So as employment increases, the total product curve 
gets flatter.
Figure 11-2 shows how the marginal product of labor depends on the num-
ber of workers employed on the farm. The marginal product of labor, MPL, is 
measured on the vertical axis in units of physical output—bushels of wheat—
produced per additional worker, and the number of workers employed is mea-
sured on the horizontal axis. You can see from the table in Figure 11-1 that if 
5 workers are employed instead of 4, output rises from 64 to 75 bushels; in this 
case the marginal product of labor is 11 bushels—the same number found in 
Figure 11-2. To indicate that 11 bushels is the marginal product when employ-
ment rises from 4 to 5, we place the point corresponding to that information 
halfway between 4 and 5 workers.
In this example the marginal product of labor falls as the number of workers 
increases. That is, there are diminishing returns to labor on George and Martha’s 
farm. In general, there are diminishing returns to an input when an increase 
in the quantity of that input, holding the quantity of all other inputs fixed, reduces 
that input’s marginal product. Due to diminishing returns to labor, the MPL curve 
is negatively sloped.
Wheat yields differ substantially around the world. The 
disparity between France and the United States that 
you see in this graph is particularly striking, given that 
they are both wealthy countries with comparable agri-
cultural technology. Yet the reason for that disparity is 
straightforward: differing government policies. In the 
United States, farmers receive payments from the gov-
ernment to supplement their incomes, but European 
farmers benefit from price floors. Since European farm-
ers get higher prices for their output than American 
farmers, they employ more variable inputs and produce 
significantly higher yields. Interestingly, in poor coun-
tries like Uganda and Ethiopia, foreign aid can lead 
to significantly depressed yields. Foreign aid from 
wealthy countries has often taken the form of surplus 
food, which depresses local market prices, severely 
hurting the local agriculture that poor countries normally 
depend on. Charitable organizations like OXFAM have 
asked wealthy food-producing countries to modify their 
aid policies—principally, to give aid in cash rather 
than in food products except in the case of acute food 
shortages—to avoid this problem.

There are diminishing returns to 
an input when an increase in the 
quantity of that input, holding the 
levels of all other inputs fixed, leads 
to a decline in the marginal product 
of that input.

To grasp why diminishing returns can occur, think about what happens as 
George and Martha add more and more workers without increasing the number 
of acres of land. As the number of workers increases, the land is farmed more 
intensively and the number of bushels produced increases. But each additional 
worker is working with a smaller share of the 10 acres—the fixed input—than the 
previous worker. As a result, the additional worker cannot produce as much 
output as the previous worker. So it’s not surprising that the marginal product 
of the additional worker falls.
The crucial point to emphasize about diminishing returns is that, like many 
propositions in economics, it is an “other things equal” proposition: each succes-
sive unit of an input will raise production by less than the last if the quantity of 
all other inputs is held fixed.
What would happen if the levels of other inputs were allowed to change? 
You can see the answer illustrated in Figure 11-3. Panel (a) shows 
two total product curves, TP10 and TP20. TP10 is the farm’s total 
product curve when its total area is 10 acres (the same curve as 
in Figure 11-1). TP20 is the total product curve when the farm has 
increased to 20 acres. Except when 0 workers are employed, TP20 lies 
everywhere above TP10 because with more acres available, any given 
number of workers produces more output. Panel (b) shows the cor-
responding marginal product of labor curves. MPL10 is the marginal 
product of labor curve given 10 acres to cultivate (the same curve 
as in Figure 11-2), and MPL20 is the marginal product of labor curve given 
20 acres. Both curves slope downward because, in each case, the 
amount of land is fixed, albeit at different levels. But MPL20 lies 
everywhere above MPL10, reflecting the fact that the marginal prod-
uct of the same worker is higher when he or she has more of the fixed 
input to work with.
Figure 11-3 demonstrates a general result: the position of the total 
product curve of a given input depends on the quantities of other inputs. 
If you change the quantity of the other inputs, both the total product 
curve and the marginal product curve of the remaining input will shift. 
Marginal Product of Labor Curve for George and Martha’s Farm
11-2
The marginal product of labor curve 
plots each worker’s marginal product, 
the increase in the quantity of output 
generated by each additional worker. The 
change in the quantity of output is mea-
sured on the vertical axis and the number 
of workers employed on the horizontal 
axis. The first worker employed generates 
an increase in output of 19 bushels, the 
second worker generates an increase 
of 17 bushels, and so on. The curve 
slopes downward due to diminishing 
returns to labor.

PITFALLS
WHAT’S A UNIT?
The marginal product of labor (or any other 
input) is defined as the increase in the quan-
tity of output when you increase the quantity 
of that input by one unit. But what do we 
mean by a “unit” of labor? Is it an addi-
tional hour of labor, an additional week, or a 
person - year?
The answer is that it doesn’t matter, as 
long as you are consistent. One common 
source of error in economics is getting units 
confused—say, comparing the output added 
by an additional hour of labor with the cost 
of employing a worker for a week. Whatever 
units you use, always be careful that you use 
the same units throughout your analysis of 
any problem.

From the Production Function to Cost Curves
Once George and Martha know their production function, they know the relation-
ship between inputs of labor and land and output of wheat. But if they want to 
maximize their profits, they need to translate this knowledge into information 
about the relationship between the quantity of output and cost. Let’s see how they 
can do this.
To translate information about a firm’s production function into information 
about its costs, we need to know how much the firm must pay for its inputs. We 
will assume that George and Martha face either an explicit or an implicit cost 
of $400 for the use of the land. As we learned in Chapter 9, it is irrelevant wheth-
er George and Martha must rent the land for $400 from someone else or whether 
they own the land themselves and forgo earning $400 from renting it to someone 
else. Either way, they pay an opportunity cost of $400 by using the land to grow 
wheat. Moreover, since the land is a fixed input, the $400 George and Martha pay 
for it is a fixed cost, denoted by FC—a cost that does not depend on the quantity 
of output produced (in the short run). In business, fixed cost is often referred to 
as “overhead cost.”
We also assume that George and Martha must pay each worker $200. Using 
their production function, George and Martha know that the number of work-
ers they must hire depends on the amount of wheat they intend to produce. So 
the cost of labor, which is equal to the number of workers multiplied by $200, is 
a variable cost, denoted by VC—a cost that depends on the quantity of output 
produced. Adding the fixed cost and the variable cost of a given quantity of output 
gives the total cost, or TC, of that quantity of output. We can express the rela-
tionship among fixed cost, variable cost, and total cost as an equation:

(a) Total Product Curves
(b) Marginal Product Curves
This figure shows how the quantity of output and 
the marginal product of labor depend on the level 
of the fixed input. Panel (a) shows two total product 
curves for George and Martha’s farm, TP10 when 
their farm is 10 acres and TP20 when it is 20 acres. 
With more land, each worker can produce more 
wheat. So an increase in the fixed input shifts 
the total product curve up from TP10 to TP20. This 
implies that the marginal product of each worker 
is higher when the farm is 20 acres than when it is 
10 acres. Panel (b) shows the marginal product of 
labor curves. The increase in acreage also shifts 
the marginal product of labor curve up from MPL10 
to MPL20. Note that both marginal product of labor 
curves still slope downward due to diminishing 
returns to labor.
A fixed cost is a cost that does not 
depend on the quantity of output 
produced. It is the cost of the fixed 
input.
A variable cost is a cost that 
depends on the quantity of output 
produced. It is the cost of the 
variable input.
The total cost of producing a given 
quantity of output is the sum of the 
fixed cost and the variable cost of 
producing that quantity of output.

or
TC = FC + VC
The table in Figure 11-4 shows how total cost is calculated for George and 
Martha’s farm. The second column shows the number of workers employed, L. 
The third column shows the corresponding level of output, Q, taken from the 
table in Figure 11-1. The fourth column shows the variable cost, VC, equal to the 
number of workers multiplied by $200. The fifth column shows the fixed cost, FC, 
which is $400 regardless of how many workers are employed. The sixth column 
shows the total cost of output, TC, which is the variable cost plus the fixed cost.
The first column labels each row of the table with a letter, from A to I. These 
labels will be helpful in understanding our next step: drawing the total cost 
curve, a curve that shows how total cost depends on the quantity of output.
George and Martha’s total cost curve is shown in the diagram in Figure 11-4, 
where the horizontal axis measures the quantity of output in bushels of wheat 
and the vertical axis measures total cost in dollars. Each point on the curve 
corresponds to one row of the table in Figure 11-4. For example, point A shows 
The total cost curve shows how

Total Cost Curve for George and Martha’s Farm
11-4
The table shows the variable cost, fixed 
cost, and total cost for various output 
quantities on George and Martha’s 
10-acre farm. The total cost curve 
shows how total cost (measured on the 
vertical axis) depends on the quantity 
of output (measured on the horizontal 
axis). The labeled points on the curve 
correspond to the rows of the table. The 
total cost curve slopes upward because 
the number of workers employed, and 
hence total cost, increases as the 
quantity of output increases. The curve 
gets steeper as output increases due to 
diminishing returns to labor.

the situation when 0 workers are employed: output is 0, and total cost is equal 
to fixed cost, $400. Similarly, point B shows the situation when 1 worker is 
employed: output is 19 bushels, and total cost is $600, equal to the sum of $400 
in fixed cost and $200 in variable cost.
Like the total product curve, the total cost curve slopes upward: due to the 
variable cost, the more output produced, the higher the farm’s total cost. But 
unlike the total product curve, which gets flatter as employment rises, the total 
cost curve gets steeper. That is, the slope of the total cost curve is greater as the 
amount of output produced increases. As we will soon see, the steepening of the 
total cost curve is also due to diminishing returns to the variable input. Before we 
can understand this, we must first look at the relationships among several useful 
measures of cost.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE MYTHICAL MAN-MONTH
T
he concept of diminishing returns to an input was first formulated by econo-
mists during the late eighteenth century. These economists, notably including 
Thomas Malthus, drew their inspiration from agricultural examples. Although 
still valid, examples drawn from agriculture can seem somewhat musty and old - 
fashioned in our modern economy.
However, the idea of diminishing returns to an input applies with equal force 
to the most modern of economic activities—such as, say, the design of software. 
In 1975 Frederick P. Brooks Jr., a project manager at IBM during the days when 
it dominated the computer business, published a book titled The Mythical Man - 
Month that soon became a classic—so much so that a special anniversary edition 
was published 20 years later.
The chapter that gave its title to the book is basically about diminishing returns 
to labor in the writing of software. Brooks observed that multiplying the number 
of programmers assigned to a project did not produce a proportionate reduction in 
the time it took to get the program written. A project that could be done by 1 pro-
grammer in 12 months could not be done by 12 programmers in 1 month—hence 
the “mythical man - month,” the false notion that the number 
of lines of programming code produced was proportional 
to the number of code writers employed. In fact, above a 
certain number, adding another programmer on a project 
actually increased the time to completion.
The argument of The Mythical Man - Month is summa-
rized in Figure 11-5. The upper part of the figure shows 
how the quantity of the project’s output, as measured by 
the number of lines of code produced per month, varies 
with the number of programmers. Each additional pro-
grammer accomplishes less than the previous one, and 
beyond a certain point an additional programmer is actu-
ally counterproductive. The lower part of the figure shows 
the marginal product of each successive programmer, 
which falls as more programmers are employed and even-
tually becomes negative. In other words, programming 
is subject to diminishing returns so severe that at some 
point more programmers actually have negative marginal 
product. The source of the diminishing returns lies in 
the nature of the production function for a programming 
project: each programmer must coordinate his or her work 
with that of all the other programmers on the project, 
leading to each person spending more and more time com-
municating with others as the number of programmers

increases. In other words, other things equal, there are diminishing returns to 
labor. It is likely, however, that if fixed inputs devoted to programming projects 
are increased—say, installing a faster Wiki system—the problem of diminishing 
returns for additional programmers can be mitigated.
A reviewer of the reissued edition of The Mythical Man - Month summarized 
the reasons for these diminishing returns: “There is an inescapable overhead to 
yoking up programmers in parallel. The members of the team must ‘waste time’ 
attending meetings, drafting project plans, exchanging e - mail, negotiating inter-
faces, enduring performance reviews, and so on. . . . At Microsoft, there will be at 
least one team member that just designs T-shirts for the rest of the team to wear.”

Two Key Concepts: Marginal Cost 
and Average Cost
We’ve just learned how to derive a firm’s total cost curve from its production func-
tion. Our next step is to take a deeper look at total cost by deriving two extremely 
useful measures: marginal cost and average cost. As we’ll see, these two measures 
of the cost of production have a somewhat surprising relationship to each other. 
Moreover, they will prove to be vitally important in Chapter 12, where we will use 
them to analyze the firm’s output decision and the market supply curve.
Marginal Cost
We defined marginal cost in Chapter 9: it is the change in total cost generated by 
producing one more unit of output. We’ve already seen that the marginal product 
of an input is easiest to calculate if data on output are available in increments of 
one unit of that input. Similarly, marginal cost is easiest to calculate if data on 
total cost are available in increments of one unit of output. When the data come in 
less convenient increments, it’s still possible to calculate marginal cost. But for the 
sake of simplicity, let’s work with an example in which the data come in convenient 
one-unit increments.
Selena’s Gourmet Salsas produces bottled salsa and Table 11-1 shows how 
its costs per day depend on the number of cases of salsa it produces per day. 
The firm has fixed cost of $108 per day, shown in the second column, which 
represents the daily cost of its food-preparation equipment. The third column

• The firm’s production function is 
the relationship between quantity 
of inputs and output. The total 
product curve shows how the 
quantity of output depends on the 
quantity of the variable input for a 
given quantity of the fixed input, 
and its slope is equal to the mar-
ginal product of the variable input. 
In the short run, the fixed input 
cannot be varied; in the long run all 
inputs are variable.
• When the levels of all other inputs 
are fixed, diminishing returns 
to an input may arise, yielding a 
downward-sloping marginal product 
curve and a total product curve 
that becomes flatter as more 
output is produced.
• The total cost of a given quantity 
of output equals the fixed cost 
plus the variable cost of that out-
put. The total cost curve becomes 
steeper as more output is produced 
due to diminishing returns to the 
variable input.
 Quick Review

shows the variable cost, and the fourth column shows the total cost. Panel (a) of 
Figure 11-6 plots the total cost curve. Like the total cost curve for George and 
Martha’s farm in Figure 11-4, this curve slopes upward, getting steeper as you 
move up it to the right.
The significance of the slope of the total cost curve is shown by the fifth 
column of Table 11-1, which calculates marginal cost: the additional cost of each 
additional unit. The general formula for marginal cost is:
(11-3) Marginal cost = 
Change in total cost 
generated by one 
additional unit of 
output
 = 
Change in total cost
Change in quantity of output
or
MC = ΔTC
ΔQ  
As in the case of marginal product, marginal cost is equal to “rise” (the increase 
in total cost) divided by “run” (the increase in the quantity of output). So just as 
marginal product is equal to the slope of the total product curve, marginal cost 
is equal to the slope of the total cost curve.
Now we can understand why the total cost curve gets steeper as we move up it 
to the right: as you can see in Table 11-1, marginal cost at Selena’s Gourmet Salsas 
rises as output increases. Panel (b) of Figure 11-6 shows the marginal cost curve 
corresponding to the data in Table 11-1. Notice that, as in Figure 11-2, we plot the 
marginal cost for increasing output from 0 to 1 case of salsa halfway between 0 
and 1, the marginal cost for increasing output from 1 to 2 cases of salsa halfway 
between 1 and 2, and so on.
Why does the marginal cost curve slope upward? Because there are diminish-
ing returns to inputs in this example. As output increases, the marginal product 
of the variable input declines. This implies that more and more of the variable 
input must be used to produce each additional unit of output as the amount of 
output already produced rises. And since each unit of the variable input must be 
paid for, the additional cost per additional unit of output also rises.
In addition, recall that the flattening of the total product curve is also due to 
diminishing returns: the marginal product of an input falls as more of that input

is used if the quantities of other inputs are fixed. The flattening of the total prod-
uct curve as output increases and the steepening of the total cost curve as output 
increases are just flip - sides of the same phenomenon. That is, as output increases, 
the marginal cost of output also increases because the marginal product of the 
variable input decreases.
We will return to marginal cost in Chapter 12, when we consider the firm’s 
profit - maximizing output decision. Our next step is to introduce another measure 
of cost: average cost.
Average Total Cost
In addition to total cost and marginal cost, it’s useful to calculate another mea-
sure, average total cost, often simply called average cost. The average total 
cost is total cost divided by the quantity of output produced; that is, it is equal to 
total cost per unit of output. If we let ATC denote average total cost, the equation 
looks like this:
(11-4) ATC = 
Total cost
Quantity of output = TC
Q
Average total cost is important because it tells the producer how much the aver-
age or typical unit of output costs to produce. Marginal cost, meanwhile, tells 
the producer how much one more unit of output costs to produce. Although they 
may look very similar, these two measures of cost typically differ. And confusion 
between them is a major source of error in economics, both in the classroom and 
in real life, as illustrated by the upcoming Economics in Action.
Table 11-2 uses data from Selena’s Gourmet Salsas to calculate average total 
cost. For example, the total cost of producing 4 cases of salsa is $300, consisting 
of $108 in fixed cost and $192 in variable cost (from Table 11-1). So the average 
total cost of producing 4 cases of salsa is $300/4 = $75. You can see from Table 
11-2 that as quantity of output increases, average total cost first falls, then rises.

diminishing returns to the variable input.
Average total cost, often referred 
to simply as average cost, is total 
cost divided by quantity of output 
produced.

Figure 11-7 plots that data to yield the average total cost curve, which shows 
how average total cost depends on output. As before, cost in dollars is measured 
on the vertical axis and quantity of output is measured on the horizontal axis. 
The average total cost curve has a distinctive U shape that corresponds to how 
average total cost first falls and then rises as output increases. Economists believe 
that such U-shaped average total cost curves are the norm for producers in

To help our understanding of why the average total cost curve is U-shaped, 
Table 11-2 breaks average total cost into its two underlying components, average 
fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost, or AFC, is fixed cost 
divided by the quantity of output, also known as the fixed cost per unit of output. 
For example, if Selena’s Gourmet Salsas produces 4 cases of salsa, average fixed 
cost is $108/4 = $27 per case. Average variable cost, or AVC, is variable cost 
A U-shaped average total cost 
curve falls at low levels of output, 
then rises at higher levels.
Average fixed cost is the fixed cost 
per unit of output.
Average variable cost is the 
variable cost per unit of output.

Average Total Cost Curve for Selena’s Gourmet Salsas
11-7
The average total cost curve at Selena’s 
Gourmet Salsas is U-shaped. At low levels of 
output, average total cost falls because the 
“spreading effect” of falling average fixed cost 
dominates the “diminishing returns effect” of 
rising average variable cost. At higher levels of 
output, the opposite is true and average total 
cost rises. At point M, corresponding to an 
output of three cases of salsa per day, average 
total cost is at its minimum level, the minimum 
average total cost.

divided by the quantity of output, also known as variable cost per unit of output. 
At an output of 4 cases, average variable cost is $192/4 = $48 per case. Writing 
these in the form of equations:

Average total cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. 
It has a U shape because these components move in opposite directions as 
output rises.
Average fixed cost falls as more output is produced because the numerator 
(the fixed cost) is a fixed number but the denominator (the quantity of output) 
increases as more is produced. Another way to think about this relationship is 
that, as more output is produced, the fixed cost is spread over more units of 
output; the end result is that the fixed cost per unit of output—the average fixed 
cost—falls. You can see this effect in the fourth column of Table 11-2: average 
fixed cost drops continuously as output increases.
Average variable cost, however, rises as output increases. As we’ve seen, this 
reflects diminishing returns to the variable input: each additional unit of output 
incurs more variable cost to produce than the previous unit. So variable cost rises 
at a faster rate than the quantity of output increases.
So increasing output has two opposing effects on average total cost—the 
“spreading effect” and the “diminishing returns effect”:
 • The spreading effect. The larger the output, the greater the quantity of output 
over which fixed cost is spread, leading to lower average fixed cost.
 • The diminishing returns effect. The larger the output, the greater the amount of 
variable input required to produce additional units, leading to higher average 
variable cost.
At low levels of output, the spreading effect is very powerful because even small 
increases in output cause large reductions in average fixed cost. So at low lev-
els of output, the spreading effect dominates the diminishing returns effect 
and causes the average total cost curve to slope downward. But when output is 
large, average fixed cost is already quite small, so increasing output further has 
only a very small spreading effect. Diminishing returns, however, usually grow 
increasingly important as output rises. As a result, when output is large, the 
diminishing returns effect dominates the spreading effect, causing the average 
total cost curve to slope upward. At the bottom of the U-shaped average total 
cost curve, point M in Figure 11-7, the two effects exactly balance each other. 
At this point average total cost is at its minimum level, the minimum average 
total cost.
Figure 11-8 brings together in a single picture four members of the family of 
cost curves that we have derived from the total cost curve for Selena’s Gourmet 
Salsas: the marginal cost curve (MC), the average total cost curve (ATC), the 
average variable cost curve (AVC), and the average fixed cost curve (AFC). All are 
based on the information in Tables 11-1 and 11-2. As before, cost is measured on 
the vertical axis and the quantity of output is measured on the horizontal axis.
Let’s take a moment to note some features of the various cost curves. First of 
all, marginal cost slopes upward—the result of diminishing returns that make 
an additional unit of output more costly to produce than the one before. Average 
variable cost also slopes upward—again, due to diminishing returns—but is flat-
ter than the marginal cost curve. This is because the higher cost of an additional 
unit of output is averaged across all units, not just the additional units, in the 
average variable cost measure. Meanwhile, average fixed cost slopes downward 
because of the spreading effect.

Finally, notice that the marginal cost curve intersects the average total cost 
curve from below, crossing it at its lowest point, point M in Figure 11-8. This last 
feature is our next subject of study.
Minimum Average Total Cost
For a U-shaped average total cost curve, average total cost is at its minimum level 
at the bottom of the U. Economists call the quantity of output that corresponds 
to the minimum average total cost the minimum - cost output. In the case of 
Selena’s Gourmet Salsas, the minimum - cost output is three cases of salsa per day.
In Figure 11-8, the bottom of the U is at the level of output at which the 
marginal cost curve crosses the average total cost curve from below. Is this an 
accident? No—it reflects general principles that are always true about a firm’s 
marginal cost and average total cost curves:
 • At the minimum - cost output, average total cost is equal to marginal cost.
 • At output less than the minimum - cost output, marginal cost is less than aver-
age total cost and average total cost is falling.
 • At output greater than the minimum - cost output, marginal cost is greater than 
average total cost and average total cost is rising.
To understand these principles, think about how your grade in one course—
say, a 3.0 in physics—affects your overall grade point average. If your GPA before 
receiving that grade was more than 3.0, the new grade lowers your average.
Similarly, if marginal cost—the cost of producing one more unit—is less than 
average total cost, producing that extra unit lowers average total cost. This is 
shown in Figure 11-9 by the movement from A1 to A2. In this case, the marginal 
cost of producing an additional unit of output is low, as indicated by the point 
MCL on the marginal cost curve. When the cost of producing the next unit of 
output is less than average total cost, increasing production reduces average total 
cost. So any quantity of output at which marginal cost is less than average total 
cost must be on the downward - sloping segment of the U.

Here we have the family of cost curves for 
Selena’s Gourmet Salsas: the marginal cost 
curve (MC), the average total cost curve 
(ATC), the average variable cost curve (AVC), 
and the average fixed cost curve (AFC). 
Note that the average total cost curve is 
U-shaped and the marginal cost curve 
crosses the average total cost curve at the 
bottom of the U, point M, corresponding 
to the minimum average total cost from

But if your grade in physics is more than the average of your previous grades, 
this new grade raises your GPA. Similarly, if marginal cost is greater than average 
total cost, producing that extra unit raises average total cost. This is illustrated 
by the movement from B1 to B2 in Figure 11-9, where the marginal cost, MCH, is 
higher than average total cost. So any quantity of output at which marginal cost 
is greater than average total cost must be on the upward - sloping segment of the U.
Finally, if a new grade is exactly equal to your previous GPA, the additional 
grade neither raises nor lowers that average—it stays the same. This corresponds 
to point M in Figure 11-9: when marginal cost equals average total cost, we must 
be at the bottom of the U, because only at that point is average total cost neither 
falling nor rising.
Does the Marginal Cost Curve Always Slope Upward?
Up to this point, we have emphasized the importance of diminishing returns, 
which lead to a marginal product curve that always slopes downward and a 
marginal cost curve that always slopes upward. In practice, however, economists 
believe that marginal cost curves often slope downward as a firm increases its 
production from zero up to some low level, sloping upward only at higher levels 
of production: they look like the curve MC in Figure 11-10.
This initial downward slope occurs because a firm often finds that, when it 
starts with only a very small number of workers, employing more workers and 
expanding output allows its workers to specialize in various tasks. This, in turn, 
lowers the firm’s marginal cost as it expands output. For example, one individual 
producing salsa would have to perform all the tasks involved: selecting and pre-
paring the ingredients, mixing the salsa, bottling and labeling it, packing it into 
cases, and so on. As more workers are employed, they can divide the tasks, with 
each worker specializing in one or a few aspects of salsa - making. This specializa-
tion leads to increasing returns to the hiring of additional workers and results in 
a marginal cost curve that initially slopes downward. But once there are enough 
workers to have completely exhausted the benefits of further specialization, 
diminishing returns to labor set in and the marginal cost curve changes direction 
and slopes upward. So typical marginal cost curves actually have the “swoosh” 
shape shown by MC in Figure 11-10. For the same reason, average variable cost 
The Relationship Between the Average Total Cost and the Marginal Cost Curves
11-9
To see why the marginal cost curve (MC) must cut 
through the average total cost curve at the minimum 
average total cost (point M), corresponding to the 
minimum  -cost output, we look at what happens if 
marginal cost is different from average total cost. 
If marginal cost is less than average total cost, an 
increase in output must reduce average total cost, 
as in the movement from A1 to A2. If marginal cost 
is greater than average total cost, an increase in 
output must increase average total cost, as in the 
movement from B1 to B2.

curves typically look like AVC in Figure 11-10: they are U-shaped rather than 
strictly upward sloping.
However, as Figure 11-10 also shows, the key features we saw from the example of 
Selena’s Gourmet Salsas remain true: the average total cost curve is U-shaped, and 
the marginal cost curve passes through the point of minimum average total cost.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
DON’T PUT OUT THE WELCOME MAT
H
ousing developments have traditionally been considered as American 
as apple pie. With our abundant supply of undeveloped land, real estate 
developers have long found it profitable to buy big parcels of land, build a large 
number of homes, and create entire new communities. But what is profitable for 
developers is not necessarily good for the existing residents.
In the past few years, real estate developers have encountered increasingly 
stiff resistance from local residents because of the additional costs—the marginal 
costs —imposed on existing homeowners from new developments. Let’s look at why.
In the United States, a large percentage of the funding for local services comes 
from taxes paid by local homeowners. In a sense, the local 
township authority uses those taxes to “produce” municipal 
services for the town. The overall level of property taxes is 
set to reflect the costs of providing those services. The high-
est service cost by far, in most communities, is the cost of 
public education.
The local tax rate that new homeowners pay on their 
new homes is the same as what existing homeowners pay 
on their older homes. That tax rate reflects the current total 
cost of services, and the taxes that an average homeowner 
pays reflect the average total cost of providing services to 
a household. The average total cost of providing services 
is based on the town’s use of existing facilities, such as the 
existing school buildings, the existing number of teachers, 
the existing fleet of school buses, and so on.
More Realistic Cost Curves
11-10
A realistic marginal cost curve has a 
“swoosh” shape. Starting from a very low 
output level, marginal cost often falls as 
the firm increases output. That’s because 
hiring additional workers allows greater 
specialization of their tasks and leads to 
increasing returns. Once specialization is 
achieved, however, diminishing returns to 
additional workers set in and marginal cost 
rises. The corresponding average variable 
cost curve is now U-shaped, like the aver-
age total cost curve.

But when a large development of homes is constructed, those facilities are 
no longer adequate: new schools must be built, new teachers hired, and so on. 
The quantity of output increases. So the marginal cost of providing municipal 
services per household associated with a new, large - scale development turns out 
to be much higher than the average total cost per household of existing homes. As 
a result, new developments and facilities cause everyone’s local tax rate to go up, 
just as you would expect from Figure 11-9. A recent study in Massachusetts esti-
mated that a $250,000 new home with one school - age child imposed an additional 
cost to the community of $5,527 per year over and above the taxes paid by the new 
homeowners. As a result, in many towns across America, potential new housing 
developments and newcomers are now facing a distinctly chilly reception.

Short - Run versus Long - Run Costs
Up to this point, we have treated fixed cost as completely outside the control of a 
firm because we have focused on the short run. But as we noted earlier, all inputs 
are variable in the long run: this means that in the long run fixed cost may also be 
varied. In the long run, in other words, a firm’s fixed cost becomes a variable it can 
choose. For example, given time, Selena’s Gourmet Salsas can acquire additional 
food-preparation equipment or dispose of some of its existing equipment. In this 
section, we will examine how a firm’s costs behave in the short run and in the 
long run. We will also see that the firm will choose its fixed cost in the long run 
based on the level of output it expects to produce.
Let’s begin by supposing that Selena’s Gourmet Salsas is considering whether 
to acquire additional food-preparation equipment. Acquiring additional machin-
ery will affect its total cost in two ways. First, the firm will have to either rent or 
buy the additional equipment; either way, that will mean higher fixed cost in the 
short run. Second, if the workers have more equipment, they will be more produc-
tive: fewer workers will be needed to produce any given output, so variable cost 
for any given output level will be reduced.
The table in Figure 11-11 shows how acquiring an additional machine affects 
costs. In our original example, we assumed that Selena’s Gourmet Salsas had a 
fixed cost of $108. The left half of the table shows variable cost as well as total 
cost and average total cost assuming a fixed cost of $108. The average total cost 
curve for this level of fixed cost is given by ATC1 in Figure 11-11. Let’s compare 
that to a situation in which the firm buys additional food-preparation equipment, 
• Marginal cost is equal to the slope 
of the total cost curve. Diminishing 
returns cause the marginal cost 
curve to slope upward.
• Average total cost (or average cost) 
is equal to the sum of average fixed 
cost and average variable cost. 
When the U-shaped average total 
cost curve slopes downward, the 
spreading effect dominates: fixed 
cost is spread over more units of 
output. When it slopes upward, the 
diminishing returns effect domi-
nates: an additional unit of output 
requires more variable inputs.
• Marginal cost is equal to average 
total cost at the minimum - cost out-
put. At higher output levels, margin-
al cost is greater than average total 
cost and average total cost is rising. 
At lower output levels, marginal cost 
is lower than average total cost and 
average total cost is falling.
• At low levels of output there are 
often increasing returns to the 
variable input due to the benefits 
of specialization, making the mar-
ginal cost curve “swoosh”-shaped: 
initially sloping downward before 
sloping upward.

doubling its fixed cost to $216 but reducing its variable cost at any given level of 
output. The right half of the table shows the firm’s variable cost, total cost, and 
average total cost with this higher level of fixed cost. The average total cost curve 
corresponding to $216 in fixed cost is given by ATC2 in Figure 11-11.
From the figure you can see that when output is small, 4 cases of salsa per day 
or fewer, average total cost is smaller when Selena forgoes the additional equip-
ment and maintains the lower fixed cost of $108: ATC1 lies below ATC2. For exam-
ple, at 3 cases per day, average total cost is $72 without the additional machinery 
and $90 with the additional machinery. But as output increases beyond 4 cases 
per day, the firm’s average total cost is lower if it acquires the additional equip-
ment, raising its fixed cost to $216. For example, at 9 cases of salsa per day, aver-
age total cost is $120 when fixed cost is $108 but only $78 when fixed cost is $216.
Why does average total cost change like this when fixed cost increases? When 
output is low, the increase in fixed cost from the additional equipment outweighs 
the reduction in variable cost from higher worker productivity—that is, there are 
too few units of output over which to spread the additional fixed cost. So if Selena

There is a trade - off between higher 
fixed cost and lower variable cost 
for any given output level, and vice 
versa. ATC1 is the average total cost 
curve corresponding to a fixed cost 
of $108; it leads to lower fixed cost 
and higher variable cost. ATC2 is 
the average total cost curve cor-
responding to a higher fixed cost of 
$216 but lower variable cost. At low 
output levels, at 4 or fewer cases 
of salsa per day, ATC1 lies below 
ATC2: average total cost is lower 
with only $108 in fixed cost. But as 
output goes up, average total cost is 
lower with the higher amount of fixed 
cost, $216: at more than 4 cases of 
salsa per day, ATC2 lies below ATC1.

plans to produce 4 or fewer cases per day, she would be better off choosing the lower 
level of fixed cost, $108, to achieve a lower average total cost of production. When 
planned output is high, however, she should acquire the additional machinery.
In general, for each output level there is some choice of fixed cost that mini-
mizes the firm’s average total cost for that output level. So when the firm has a 
desired output level that it expects to maintain over time, it should choose the 
level of fixed cost optimal for that level—that is, the level of fixed cost that mini-
mizes its average total cost.
Now that we are studying a situation in which fixed cost can change, we need to 
take time into account when discussing average total cost. All of the average total 
cost curves we have considered until now are defined for a given level of fixed cost—
that is, they are defined for the short run, the period of time over which fixed cost 
doesn’t vary. To reinforce that distinction, for the rest of this chapter we will refer 
to these average total cost curves as “short - run average total cost curves.”
For most firms, it is realistic to assume that there are many possible choices 
of fixed cost, not just two. The implication: for such a firm, many possible short - 
run average total cost curves will exist, each corresponding to a different choice 
of fixed cost and so giving rise to what is called a firm’s “family” of short - run 
average total cost curves.
At any given point in time, a firm will find itself on one of its short - run cost 
curves, the one corresponding to its current level of fixed cost; a change in output 
will cause it to move along that curve. If the firm expects that change in output level 
to be long - standing, then it is likely that the firm’s current level of fixed cost is no 
longer optimal. Given sufficient time, it will want to adjust its fixed cost to a new 
level that minimizes average total cost for its new output level. For example, if Selena 
had been producing 2 cases of salsa per day with a fixed cost of $108 but found her-
self increasing her output to 8 cases per day for the foreseeable future, then in the 
long run she should purchase more equipment and increase her fixed cost to a level 
that minimizes average total cost at the 8-cases - per - day output level.
Suppose we do a thought experiment and calculate the lowest possible average 
total cost that can be achieved for each output level if the firm were to choose its 
fixed cost for each output level. Economists have given this thought experiment a 
name: the long - run average total cost curve. Specifically, the long - run average total 
cost curve, or LRATC, is the relationship between output and average total cost 
when fixed cost has been chosen to minimize average total cost for each level of out-
put. If there are many possible choices of fixed cost, the long - run average total cost 
curve will have the familiar, smooth U shape, as shown by LRATC in Figure 11-12.
We can now draw the distinction between the short run and the long run more 
fully. In the long run, when a producer has had time to choose the fixed cost appro-
priate for its desired level of output, that producer will be at some point on the 
long - run average total cost curve. But if the output level is altered, the firm will no 
longer be on its long - run average total cost curve and will instead be moving along 
its current short - run average total cost curve. It will not be on its long - run average 
total cost curve again until it readjusts its fixed cost for its new output level.
Figure 11-12 illustrates this point. The curve ATC3 shows short - run average 
total cost if Selena has chosen the level of fixed cost that minimizes average total 
cost at an output of 3 cases of salsa per day. This is confirmed by the fact that 
at 3 cases per day, ATC3 touches LRATC, the long - run average total cost curve. 
Similarly, ATC6 shows short - run average total cost if Selena has chosen the level 
of fixed cost that minimizes average total cost if her output is 6 cases per day. It 
touches LRATC at 6 cases per day. And ATC9 shows short - run average total cost if 
Selena has chosen the level of fixed cost that minimizes average total cost if her 
output is 9 cases per day. It touches LRATC at 9 cases per day.
Suppose that Selena initially chose to be on ATC6. If she actually produces 
6 cases of salsa per day, her firm will be at point C on both its short - run and long- 
run average total cost curves. Suppose, however, that Selena ends up producing

only 3 cases of salsa per day. In the short run, her average total cost is indicated 
by point B on ATC6; it is no longer on LRATC. If Selena had known that she 
would be producing only 3 cases per day, she would have been better off choos-
ing a lower level of fixed cost, the one corresponding to ATC3, thereby achieving 
a lower average total cost. Then her firm would have found itself at point A on 
the long - run average total cost curve, which lies below point B.
Suppose, conversely, that Selena ends up producing 9 cases per day even 
though she initially chose to be on ATC6. In the short run her average total cost 
is indicated by point Y on ATC6. But she would be better off purchasing more 
equipment and incurring a higher fixed cost in order to reduce her variable cost 
and move to ATC9. This would allow her to reach point X on the long - run average 
total cost curve, which lies below Y.
The distinction between short - run and long - run average total costs is extreme-
ly important in making sense of how real firms operate over time. A company that 
has to increase output suddenly to meet a surge in demand will typically find that 
in the short run its average total cost rises sharply because it is hard to get extra 
production out of existing facilities. But given time to build new factories or add 
machinery, short - run average total cost falls.
Returns to Scale
What determines the shape of the long - run average total cost curve? The answer 
is that scale, the size of a firm’s operations, is often an important determinant of 
its long - run average total cost of production. Firms that experience scale effects in 
production find that their long - run average total cost changes substantially depend-
ing on the quantity of output they produce. There are increasing returns to scale 
(also known as economies of scale) when long - run average total cost declines as 
output increases. As you can see in Figure 11-12, Selena’s Gourmet Salsas experi-
ences increasing returns to scale over output levels ranging from 0 up to 5 cases of 
salsa per day—the output levels over which the long - run average total cost curve is 
declining. In contrast, there are decreasing returns to scale (also known as dis-
economies of scale) when long - run average total cost increases as output increases. 
Short - Run and Long - Run Average Total Cost Curves
11-12
Short - run and long - run average total cost 
curves differ because a firm can choose 
its fixed cost in the long run. If Selena has 
chosen the level of fixed cost that minimizes 
short - run average total cost at an output of 
6 cases, and actually produces 6 cases, 
then she will be at point C on LRATC and 
ATC6. But if she produces only 3 cases, 
she will move to point B. If she expects to 
produce only 3 cases for a long time, in the 
long run she will reduce her fixed cost and 
move to point A on ATC3. Likewise, if she 
produces 9 cases (putting her at point Y) 
and expects to continue this for a long time, 
she will increase her fixed cost in the long 
run and move to point X.

For Selena’s Gourmet Salsas, decreasing returns to scale occur at output levels great-
er than 7 cases, the output levels over which its long - run average total cost curve is 
rising. There is also a third possible relationship between long - run average total cost 
and scale: firms experience constant returns to scale when long - run average total 
cost is constant as output increases. In this case, the firm’s long - run average 
total cost curve is horizontal over the output levels for which there are constant 
returns to scale. As you can see in Figure 11-12, Selena’s Gourmet Salsas has con-
stant returns to scale when it produces anywhere from 5 to 7 cases of salsa per day.
What explains these scale effects in production? The answer ultimately lies 
in the firm’s technology of production. Increasing returns often arise from the 
increased specialization that larger output levels allow—a larger scale of opera-
tion means that individual workers can limit themselves to more specialized 
tasks, becoming more skilled and efficient at doing them. Another source of 
increasing returns is very large initial set up cost; in some industries—such as 
auto manufacturing, electricity generating, or petroleum refining—incurring a 
high fixed cost in the form of plant and equipment is necessary to produce any 
output. A third source of increasing returns, found in certain hi gh- tech industries 
such as software development, is network externalities, a topic covered in Chapter 
16. As we’ll see in Chapter 13, where we study monopoly, increasing returns have 
very important implications for how firms and industries interact and behave. 
Decreasing returns—the opposite scenario—typically arise in large firms due 
to problems of coordination and communication: as the firm grows in size, it 
becomes ever more difficult and so more costly to communicate and to organize 
its activities. Although increasing returns induce firms to get larger, decreasing 
returns tend to limit their size. And when there are constant returns to scale, 
scale has no effect on a firm’s long - run average total cost: it is the same regardless 
of whether the firm produces 1 unit or 100,000 units.
Summing Up Costs: The Short and Long of It
If a firm is to make the best decisions about how much to produce, it has to 
understand how its costs relate to the quantity of output it chooses to produce.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THERE’S NO BUSINESS LIKE SNOW BUSINESS
A
nyone who has lived both in a snowy city, like Chicago, and in a city that 
only occasionally experiences significant snowfall, like Washington, D.C., 
is aware of the differences in total cost that arise from making different choices 
about fixed cost.
In Washington, even a minor snowfall—say, an inch or two overnight—is 
enough to create chaos during the next morning’s commute. The same snowfall 
in Chicago has hardly any effect at all. The reason is not that Washing tonians 
are wimps and Chicagoans are made of sterner stuff; it is that Washington, 
where it rarely snows, has only a fraction as many snowplows and other snow -
clearing equipment as cities where heavy snow is a fact of life.
In this sense Washington and Chicago are like two producers who expect 
to produce different levels of output, where the “output” is snow removal. 
Washington, which rarely has significant snow, has chosen a low level of fixed 
cost in the form of snow - clearing equipment. This makes sense under normal cir-
cumstances but leaves the city unprepared when major snow does fall. Chicago, 
which knows that it will face lots of snow, chooses to accept the higher fixed cost 
that leaves it in a position to respond effectively.
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

1. The accompanying table shows three possible combinations of fixed cost and average 
variable cost. Average variable cost is constant in this example (it does not vary with the 
quantity of output produced).
a.  For each of the three choices, calculate the average total cost of producing 12,000, 
22,000, and 30,000 units. For each of these quantities, which choice results in the 
lowest average total cost?
b.  Suppose that the firm, which 
has historically produced 
12,000 units, experiences a 
sharp, permanent increase in 
demand that leads it to pro-
duce 22,000 units. Explain 
how its average total cost will change in the short run and in the long run.
c.  Explain what the firm should do instead if it believes the change in demand is temporary.
2. In each of the following cases, explain what kind of scale effects you think the firm will 
experience and why.
a.  A telemarketing firm in which employees make sales calls using computers and 
telephones
b.  An interior design firm in which design projects are based on the expertise of the 
firm’s owner
c.  A diamond - mining company
3. Draw a graph like Figure 11-12 and insert a short - run average total cost curve corre-
sponding to a long - run output choice of 5 cases of salsa per day. Use the graph to show 
why Selena should change her fixed cost if she expects to produce only 4 cases per day 
for a long period of time.

• In the long run, firms choose fixed 
cost according to expected output. 
Higher fixed cost reduces average 
total cost when output is high. 
Lower fixed cost reduces average 
total cost when output is low.
• There are many possible short - run 
average total cost curves, each cor-
responding to a different level of 
fixed cost. The long - run average 
total cost curve, LRATC, shows 
average total cost over the long 
run, when the firm has chosen fixed 
cost to minimize average total cost 
for each level of output.
• A firm that has fully adjusted its 
fixed cost for its output level will 
operate at a point that lies on both 
its current short - run and long - run 
average total cost curves. A change 
in output moves the firm along its 
current short - run average total cost 
curve. Once it has readjusted its 
fixed cost, the firm will operate on 
a new short - run average total cost 
curve and on the long - run average 
total cost curve.
• Scale effects arise from the technolo-
gy of production. Increasing returns 
to scale tend to make firms larger. 
Decreasing returns to scale tend to 
limit their size. With constant returns 
to scale, scale has no effect.
 Quick Review

339
For those who like to procrastinate when it comes to holiday shopping, the rise of 
e-commerce has been a welcome phenomenon. Amazon.com boasts that in 2010, 
a customer was able to place an order as late as December 23rd and still receive 
the order before Christmas.  
E-commerce retailers like Amazon.com and Crate&Barrel.com can see their 
sales quadruple for the holidays. With advances in order fulfillment technology 
that get customers’ orders to them quickly, e-commerce sellers have been able to 
capture an ever-greater share of sales from brick-and-mortar retailers. Holiday 
sales at e-commerce sites grew by over 15% from 2009 to 2010.  
Behind these technological advances, however, lies an intense debate: people 
versus robots. Amazon.com relies on a large staff of temporary human workers 
to get it through the holiday season, often quadrupling its staff and operating 24 
hours a day. In contrast, Crate&Barrel.com only doubles its workforce, thanks 
to a cadre of orange robots that allows each worker to do the work of six people.
The leader in order fulfillment robotics is Kiva Systems. According to Kiva, it 
can install a robotic system for as little as a few million dollars, but some installa-
tions have cost as much as $20 million. Yet hiring workers has a cost, too: during 
the 2010 holiday season, Amazon hired some 12,500 temporary workers at its 20 
distribution centers around the United States.
But as one industry analyst noted, an obstacle to the adoption of a robotic 
system for many e-commerce retailers is that it doesn’t make economic sense: 
it’s too expensive to buy sufficient robots for the busiest time of the year because 
they would be idle at other times. Kiva is now testing a program to rent out its 
robots seasonally so that retailers can “hire” enough robots to handle their holi-
day orders just like Amazon.com hires more humans.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Assume that a firm can sell a robot, but that the sale takes time and the firm is likely to 
get less than what it paid. Other things equal, which system, human-based or robotic, will 
have a higher fixed cost? Which will have a higher variable cost? Explain.
 2. Predict the pattern of off-holiday sales versus holiday sales that would induce a retailer to 
keep a human-based system, like Amazon.com’s. Predict the pattern that would induce a 
retailer to move to a robotic system, like Crate&Barrel.com’s.
 3. How would the adoption of a “robot-for-hire” program by Kiva affect your answer to 
Question 2? Explain.

SUMMARY
 1. The relationship between inputs and output is a 
producer’s production function. In the short 
run, the quantity of a fixed input cannot be varied 
but the quantity of a variable input can. In the 
long run, the quantities of all inputs can be varied. 
For a given amount of the fixed input, the total 
product curve shows how the quantity of output 
changes as the quantity of the variable input changes. 
We may also calculate the marginal product of an 
input, the increase in output from using one more 
unit of that input.
 2. There are diminishing returns to an input when its 
marginal product declines as more of the input is used, 
holding the quantity of all other inputs fixed.
 3. Total cost, represented by the total cost curve, is 
equal to the sum of fixed cost, which does not depend 
on output, and variable cost, which does depend on 
output. Due to diminishing returns, marginal cost, the 
increase in total cost generated by producing one more 
unit of output, normally increases as output increases.
 4. Average total cost (also known as average cost), 
total cost divided by quantity of output, is the cost of 
the average unit of output, and marginal cost is the 
cost of one more unit produced. Economists believe 
that U-shaped average total cost curves are typical, 
because average total cost consists of two parts: aver-
age fixed cost, which falls when output increases (the 
spreading effect), and average variable cost, which 
rises with output (the diminishing returns effect).
 5. When average total cost is U-shaped, the bottom of 
the U is the level of output at which average total cost 
is minimized, the point of minimum - cost output. 
This is also the point at which the marginal cost curve 
crosses the average total cost curve from below. Due to 
gains from specialization, the marginal cost curve may 
slope downward initially before sloping upward, giving 
it a “swoosh” shape.
 6. In the long run, a producer can change its fixed input 
and its level of fixed cost. By accepting higher fixed 
cost, a firm can lower its variable cost for any given 
output level, and vice versa. The long - run average 
total cost curve shows the relationship between out-
put and average total cost when fixed cost has been 
chosen to minimize average total cost at each level of 
output. A firm moves along its short - run average total 
cost curve as it changes the quantity of output, and it 
returns to a point on both its short - run and long - run 
average total cost curves once it has adjusted fixed cost 
to its new output level.
 7. As output increases, there are increasing returns to 
scale if long - run average total cost declines; decreas-
ing returns to scale if it increases; and constant 
returns to scale if it remains constant. Scale effects 
depend on the technology of production.

PROBLEMS
 1. Changes in the prices of key commodities can have 
a significant impact on a company’s bottom line. 
According to a September 27, 2007, article in the Wall 
Street Journal, “Now, with oil, gas and electricity prices 
soaring, companies are beginning to realize that sav-
ing energy can translate into dramatically lower costs.” 
Another Wall Street Journal article, dated September 9, 
2007, states, “Higher grain prices are taking an increas-
ing financial toll.” Energy is an input into virtually all 
types of production; corn is an input into the produc-
tion of beef, chicken, high-fructose corn syrup, and 
ethanol (the gasoline substitute fuel).
 a. Explain how the cost of energy can be both a fixed 
cost and a variable cost for a company. 
 b. Suppose energy is a fixed cost and energy prices 
rise. What happens to the company’s average total 
cost curve? What happens to its marginal cost 
curve? Illustrate your answer with a diagram.
 c. Explain why the cost of corn is a variable cost but 
not a fixed cost for an ethanol producer.

for many firms. According to a July 29, 2011, Wall

2.6% between 2000 and 2010, and by 4.1% in 2010.

a. For each level of fixed cost, calculate Don’s total cost 
for producing 20, 40, and 60 orders per week.
b. If Don is producing 20 orders per week, how many 
trucks should he purchase and what will his average 
total cost be? Answer the same questions for 40 and 
60 orders per week.
 14. Consider Don’s concrete-mixing business described 
in Problem 13. Assume that Don purchased 3 trucks, 
expecting to produce 40 orders per week.
a. Suppose that, in the short run, business declines to 
20 orders per week. What is Don’s average total cost 
per order in the short run? What will his average 
total cost per order in the short run be if his busi-
ness booms to 60 orders per week?
b. What is Don’s long-run average total cost for 20 
orders per week? Explain why his short-run average 
total cost of producing 20 orders per week when the 
number of trucks is fixed at 3 is greater than his 
long-run average total cost of producing 20 orders 
per week.
c. Draw Don’s long-run average total cost curve. Draw 
his short-run average total cost curve if he owns 3 
trucks.

a. The short-run average total cost can never be less 
than the long-run average total cost.
b. The short-run average variable cost can never be less 
than the long-run average total cost.
c. In the long run, choosing a higher level of fixed cost 
shifts the long-run average total cost curve upward.

F
OOD CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED 
States are concerned about health 
issues. Demand for natural foods and 
beverages, such as bottled water and or-
ganically grown fruits and vegetables, 
increased rapidly over the past two 
decades, at an average growth rate 
of 20% per year. The small group of 
farmers who had pioneered organic 
farming techniques prospered thanks 
to higher prices.
But everyone knew that the high 
prices of organic produce were unlikely 
to persist even if the new, higher demand 
for naturally grown food continued: the 
supply of organic food, although rela-
tively price-inelastic in the short run, 
was surely price - elastic in the long 
run. Over time, farms already producing 
organically would increase their capac-
ity, and conventional farmers would enter 
the organic food business. So the increase 
in the quantity supplied in response to 
the increase in price would be much larg-
er in the long run than in the short run.
Where does the supply curve come 
from? Why is there a difference between 
the short - run and the long - run supply 
curve? In this chapter we will use our 
understanding of costs, developed in 
Chapter 11, as the basis for an analysis of 
the supply curve. As we’ll see, this will 
require that we understand the behavior 
both of individual firms and of an entire 
industry, composed of these many indi-
vidual firms.
Our analysis in this chapter assumes 
that the industry in question is char-
acterized by perfect competition. We 
begin by explaining the concept of 
perfect competition, providing a brief 
introduction to the conditions that give 
rise to a perfectly competitive industry. 
We then show how a producer under 
perfect competition decides how much 
to produce. Finally, we use the cost 
curves of the individual producers to 
derive the industry supply curve under 
perfect competition. By analyzing the 
way a competitive industry evolves over 
time, we will come to understand the 
distinction between the short - run and 
long - run effects of changes in demand 
on a competitive industry—such as, for 
example, the effect of America’s new 
taste for organic food on the organic 
farming industry. We will conclude with 
a deeper discussion of the conditions 
necessary for an industry to be perfectly 
competitive.

Perfect Competition
S
uppose that Yves and Zoe are neighboring farmers, both of whom grow 
organic tomatoes. Both sell their output to the same grocery store chains 
that carry organic foods; so, in a real sense, Yves and Zoe compete with 
each other.
Does this mean that Yves should try to stop Zoe from growing tomatoes or 
that Yves and Zoe should form an agreement to grow less? Almost certainly not: 
there are hundreds or thousands of organic tomato farmers, and Yves and Zoe 
are competing with all those other growers as well as with each other. Because 
so many farmers sell organic tomatoes, if any one of them produced more or less, 
there would be no mea surable effect on market prices.
When people talk about business competition, the image they often have in 
mind is a situation in which two or three rival firms are intensely struggling for 
advantage. But economists know that when an industry consists of a few main 
competitors, it’s actually a sign that competition is fairly limited. As the example 
of organic tomatoes suggests, when there is enough competition, it doesn’t even 
make sense to identify your rivals: there are so many competitors that you cannot 
single out any one of them as a rival.
We can put it another way: Yves and Zoe are price - taking producers. A 
producer is a price - taker when its actions cannot affect the market price of the 
good or service it sells. As a result, a price - taking producer considers the market 
price as given. When there is enough competition—when competition is what 
economists call “perfect”—then every producer is a price - taker. And there is a 
similar definition for consumers: a price - taking consumer is a consumer who 
cannot influence the market price of the good or service by his or her actions. 
That is, the market price is unaffected by how much or how little of the good the 
consumer buys.
Defining Perfect Competition
In a perfectly competitive market, all market participants, both consumers 
and producers, are price - takers. That is, neither consumption decisions by indi-
vidual consumers nor production decisions by individual producers affect the 
market price of the good.
The supply and demand model, which we introduced in Chapter 3 and have 
used repeatedly since then, is a model of a perfectly competitive market. It 
depends fundamentally on the assumption that no individual buyer or seller of 
a good, such as coffee beans or organic tomatoes, believes that it is possible to 
affect the price at which he or she can buy or sell the good.
As a general rule, consumers are indeed price - takers. Instances in which con-
sumers are able to affect the prices they pay are rare. It is, however, quite com-
mon for producers to have a significant ability to affect the prices they receive, 
a phenomenon we’ll address in Chapter 13. So the model of perfect competition 
is appropriate for some but not all markets. An industry in which producers are 
price - takers is called a perfectly competitive industry. Clearly, some indus-
tries aren’t perfectly competitive; in later chapters we’ll learn how to analyze 
industries that don’t fit the perfectly competitive model.
Under what circumstances will all producers be price - takers? In the next sec-
tion we will find that there are two necessary conditions for a perfectly competi-
tive industry and that a third condition is often present as well.
Two Necessary Conditions for Perfect Competition
The markets for major grains, like wheat and corn, are perfectly competitive: 
individual wheat and corn farmers, as well as individual buyers of wheat and 
corn, take market prices as given. In contrast, the markets for some of the food 
A price - taking producer is a 
producer whose actions have no 
effect on the market price of the 
good or service it sells.
A price - taking consumer is a 
consumer whose actions have no 
effect on the market price of the 
good or service he or she buys.
A perfectly competitive market 
is a market in which all market 
participants are price - takers.
A perfectly competitive industry 
is an industry in which producers 
are price -takers.

items made from these grains—in particular, breakfast cereals—are by no means 
perfectly competitive. There is intense competition among cereal brands, but not 
perfect competition. To understand the difference between the market for wheat 
and the market for shredded wheat cereal is to understand the importance of the 
two necessary conditions for perfect competition.
First, for an industry to be perfectly competitive, it must contain many produc-
ers, none of whom have a large market share. A producer’s market share is the 
fraction of the total industry output accounted for by that producer’s output. The 
distribution of market share constitutes a major difference between the grain 
industry and the breakfast cereal industry. There are thousands of wheat farm-
ers, none of whom account for more than a tiny fraction of total wheat sales.
The breakfast cereal industry, however, is dominated by four producers: 
Kellogg’s, General Mills, Post Foods, and the Quaker Oats Company. Kellogg’s 
alone accounts for about one - third of all cereal sales. Kellogg’s executives know 
that if they try to sell more cornflakes, they are likely to drive down the market 
price of cornflakes. That is, they know that their actions influence market prices, 
simply because they are so large a part of the market that changes in their pro-
duction will significantly affect the overall quantity supplied. It makes sense to 
assume that producers are price - takers only when an industry does not contain 
any large producers like Kellogg’s.
Second, an industry can be perfectly competitive only if consumers regard 
the products of all producers as equivalent. This clearly isn’t true in the break-
fast cereal market: consumers don’t consider Cap’n Crunch to be a good sub-
stitute for Wheaties. As a result, the maker of Wheaties has some ability to 
increase its price without fear that it will lose all its customers to the maker of 
Cap’n Crunch. 
Contrast this with the case of a standardized product, which is a product 
that consumers regard as the same good even when it comes from different 
producers, sometimes known as a commodity. Because wheat is a standard-
ized product, consumers regard the output of one wheat producer as a perfect 
substitute for that of another producer. Consequently, one farmer cannot 
increase the price for his or her wheat without losing all sales to other wheat 
farmers. So the second necessary condition for a competitive industry is that 
the industry output is a standardized product (see the upcoming For Inquiring 
Minds).
Free Entry and Exit
All perfectly competitive industries have many producers with small market 
shares, producing a standardized product. Most perfectly competitive industries 
are also characterized by one more feature: it is easy for new firms to enter 
the industry or for firms that are currently in the industry to leave. That is, no 
obstacles in the form of government regulations or limited access to key resources 
prevent new producers from entering the market. And no additional costs are 
associated with shutting down a company and leaving the industry. Economists 
refer to the arrival of new firms into an industry as entry; they refer to the depar-
ture of firms from an industry as exit. When there are no obstacles to entry into 
or exit from an industry, we say that the industry has free entry and exit.
Free entry and exit is not strictly necessary for perfect competition. In Chapter 
5 we described the case of New Jersey clam fishing, where regulations limit the 
number of fishing boats, so entry into the industry is limited. Despite this, there 
are enough boats operating that the fishermen are price - takers. But free entry and 
exit is a key factor in most competitive industries. It ensures that the number of 
producers in an industry can adjust to changing market conditions. And, in par-
ticular, it ensures that producers in an industry cannot act to keep new firms out.
To sum up, then, perfect competition depends on two necessary condi-
tions. First, the industry must contain many producers, each having a small 
A producer’s market share is 
the fraction of the total industry 
output accounted for by that 
producer’s output.
A good is a standardized 
product, also known as a 
commodity, when consumers 
regard the products of different 
producers as the same good.
An industry has free entry and 
exit when new producers can 
easily enter into an industry and 
existing producers can easily leave 
that industry.

market share. Second, the industry must produce a standardized product. In 
addition, perfectly competitive industries are normally characterized by free 
entry and exit.
How does an industry that meets these three criteria behave? As a first step 
toward answering that question, let’s look at how an individual producer in a 
perfectly competitive industry maximizes profit.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE PAIN OF COMPETITION
S
ometimes it is possible to see an industry become perfectly competitive. In 
fact, it happens frequently in the case of pharmaceuticals when the patent on 
a popular drug expires.
When a company develops a new drug, it is usually 
able to receive a patent, which gives it a legal monopoly—
the exclusive right to sell the drug—for 20 years from 
the date of filing. Legally, no one else can sell that drug 
without the patent owner’s permission. When the patent 
expires, the market is open for other companies to sell 
their own versions of the drug, known collectively as 
generics. Generics are standardized products, much like 
aspirin, and are often sold by many producers. 
The shift from a market with a single seller to perfect 
competition, not coincidentally, is accompanied by a sharp 
fall in the market price. For example, when the patent expired 
for the painkiller ibuprofen and generics were introduced, its 
price eventually fell by nearly 75%; the price of the painkiller 
A perfectly competitive industry 
must produce a standardized product. 
But is it enough for the products of 
different firms actually to be the same? 
No: people must also think that they 
are the same. And producers often 
go to great lengths to convince con-
sumers that they have a distinctive, 
or differentiated, product, even when 
they don’t.
Consider, for example, champagne—
not the superexpensive premium 
champagnes but the more ordinary 
stuff. Most people cannot tell the dif-
ference between champagne actually 
produced in the Champagne region of 
France, where the product originated, 
and similar products from Spain or 
California. But the French government 
has sought and obtained legal protec-
tion for the winemakers of Champagne, 
ensuring that around the world only 
bubbly wine from that region can be 
called champagne. If it’s from some-
place else, all the seller can do is say 
that it was produced using the méthode 
Champenoise. This creates a differ-
entiation in the minds of consumers 
and lets the champagne producers of 
Champagne charge higher prices.
Similarly, Korean producers of 
kimchi, the spicy fermented cabbage 
that is the Korean national side dish, 
are doing their best to convince con-
sumers that the same product pack-
aged by Japanese firms is just not 
the real thing. The purpose is, of 
course, to ensure higher prices for 
Korean kimchi.
So is an industry perfectly competitive 
if it sells products that are indistinguish-
able except in name but that consum-
ers, for whatever reason, don’t think are 
standardized? No. When it comes to 
defining the nature of competition, the 
consumer is always right.

In the end, only kimchi eaters can tell you if 
there is truly a difference between Korean - 
produced kimchi and the Japanese - produced 
variety.

naproxen fell by 90%. On average, drug prices are 40% lower after a generic 
enters the market. 
Not surprisingly, the makers of patent-protected drugs are eager to forestall 
the entry of generic competitors and have tried a variety of strategies. One 
especially successful tactic is for the original drug maker to make an agree-
ment with a potential generic competitor, essentially paying the competitor to 
delay its entry into the market. As a result, the original drug maker continues to 
charge high prices and reap high profits. These agreements have been fiercely 
contested by many government regulators, who view them as anti-competitive 
practices that hurt consumers. As of the time of writing, drug makers, consum-
ers, and government officials were awaiting a decision by the courts on the 
legality of these agreements.

Production and Profits
C
onsider Jennifer and Jason, who run an organic tomato farm. Suppose that 
the market price of organic tomatoes is $18 per bushel and that Jennifer 
and Jason are price - takers—they can sell as much as they like at that price. 
Then we can use the data in Table 12-1 to find their profit - 
maximizing level of output by direct calculation.
The first column shows the quantity of output in bushels, 
and the second column shows Jennifer and Jason’s total rev-
enue from their output: the market value of their output. Total 
revenue, TR, is equal to the market price multiplied by the 
quantity of output:
(12-1) TR = P × Q
In this example, total revenue is equal to $18 per bushel times 
the quantity of output in bushels.
The third column of Table 12-1 shows Jennifer and Jason’s 
total cost. The fourth column shows their profit, equal to total 
revenue minus total cost:
(12-2) Profit = TR − TC
As indicated by the numbers in the table, profit is maximized at an output of 5 
bushels, where profit is equal to $18. But we can gain more insight into the profit- 
maximizing choice of output by viewing it as a problem of marginal analysis, a 
task we’ll do next.
 Quick Review
• Neither the actions of a price - 
taking producer nor those of a 
price - taking consumer can influ-
ence the market price of a good.
• In a perfectly competitive market 
all producers and consumers are 
price - takers. Consumers are almost 
always price - takers, but this is 
often not true of producers. An 
industry in which producers are 
price - takers is a perfectly competi-
tive industry.
• A perfectly competitive industry 
contains many producers, each of 
which produces a standardized 
product (also known as a commod-
ity) but none of which has a large 
market share.
• Most perfectly competitive indus-
tries are also characterized by free 
entry and exit.

Using Marginal Analysis to Choose the Profit - Maximizing 
Quantity of Output
Recall from Chapter 9 the profit-maximizing principle of marginal analysis: the 
optimal amount of an activity is the level at which marginal benefit is equal to 
marginal cost. To apply this principle, consider the effect on a producer’s profit of 
increasing output by one unit. The marginal benefit of that unit is the additional 
revenue generated by selling it; this measure has a name—it is called the margin-
al revenue of that unit of output. The general formula for marginal revenue is:
(12-3) Marginal revenue = 
Change in total revenue 
generated by one 
additional unit of output
 = 
Change in total revenue
Change in quantity of output
or
 
MR = ΔTR/ΔQ
So Jennifer and Jason maximize their profit by producing bushels up to the point 
at which the marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. We can summarize this 
as the producer’s optimal output rule: profit is maximized by producing the 
quantity at which the marginal revenue of the last unit produced is equal to its 
marginal cost. That is, MR = MC at the optimal quantity of output.
We can learn how to apply the optimal output rule with the help of Table 12-2, 
which provides various short - run cost measures for Jennifer and Jason’s farm. The 
second column contains the farm’s variable cost, and the third column shows its 
total cost of output based on the 
assumption that the farm incurs a 
fixed cost of $14. The fourth column 
shows their marginal cost. Notice 
that, in this example, the marginal 
cost initially falls as output rises 
but then begins to increase. This 
gives the marginal cost curve has 
the “swoosh” shape described in the 
Selena’s Gourmet Salsas example in 
Chapter 11. (Shortly it will become 
clear that this shape has important 
implications for short - run produc-
tion decisions.)
The fifth column contains the 
farm’s marginal revenue, which has 
an important feature: Jennifer and 
Jason’s marginal revenue is con-
stant at $18 for every output level. The sixth and final column shows the calculation 
of the net gain per bushel of tomatoes, which is equal to marginal revenue minus 
marginal cost—or, equivalently in this case, market price minus marginal cost. As 
you can see, it is positive for the 1st through 5th bushels; producing each of these 
bushels raises Jennifer and Jason’s profit. For the 6th and 7th bushels, however, net 
gain is negative: producing them would decrease, not increase, profit. (You can verify 
this by examining Table 12-1.) So 5 bushels are Jennifer and Jason’s profit - maximizing 
output; it is the level of output at which marginal cost is equal to the market price, $18.
This example, in fact, illustrates another general rule derived from marginal 
analysis—the price - taking firm’s optimal output rule, which says that a 
price- taking firm’s profit is maximized by producing the quantity of output at 
which the market price is equal to the marginal cost of the last unit produced. 
That is, P = MC at the price - taking firm’s optimal quantity of output. In fact, the 
Marginal revenue is the change 
in total revenue generated by an 
additional unit of output.
According to the optimal output 
rule, profit is maximized by 
producing the quantity of output at 
which the marginal revenue of the 
last unit produced is equal to its 
marginal cost.
According to the price - taking 
firm’s optimal output rule, 
a price - taking firm’s profit is 
maximized by producing the quantity 
of output at which the market price 
is equal to the marginal cost of the 
last unit produced.

price - taking firm’s optimal output rule is just an application of the optimal output 
rule to the particular case of a price - taking firm. Why? Because in the case of a 
price - taking firm, marginal revenue is equal to the market price.
A price - taking firm cannot influence the market price by its actions. It always 
takes the market price as given because it cannot lower the market price by sell-
ing more or raise the market price by selling less. So, for a price - taking firm, the 
additional revenue generated by producing one more unit is always the market 
price. We will need to keep this fact in mind in future chapters, where we will 
learn that marginal revenue is not equal to the market price if the 
industry is not perfectly competitive. As a result, firms are not price - 
takers when an industry is not perfectly competitive.
For the remainder of this chapter, we will assume that the indus-
try in question is like organic tomato farming, perfectly competitive. 
Figure 12-1 shows that Jennifer and Jason’s profit - maximizing quan-
tity of output is, indeed, the number of bushels at which the marginal 
cost of production is equal to price. The figure shows the marginal 
cost curve, MC, drawn from the data in the fourth column of Table 
12-2. As in Chapter 9, we plot the marginal cost of increasing output 
from 1 to 2 bushels halfway between 1 and 2, and so on. The horizon-
tal line at $18 is Jennifer and Jason’s marginal revenue curve.
Note that whenever a firm is a price - taker, its marginal revenue 
curve is a horizontal line at the market price: it can sell as much as it 
likes at the market price. Regardless of whether it sells more or less, 
the market price is unaffected. In effect, the individual firm faces a 
horizontal, perfectly elastic demand curve for its output—an individual 
demand curve for its output that is equivalent to its marginal revenue 
curve. The marginal cost curve crosses the marginal revenue curve at 
point E. Sure enough, the quantity of output at E is 5 bushels.
Does this mean that the price-taking firm’s production decision can be 
entirely summed up as “produce up to the point where the marginal cost of production 
is equal to the price”? No, not quite. Before applying the profit-maximizing principle of 
marginal analysis to determine how much to produce, a potential producer must as a 
PITFALLS
WHAT IF MARGINAL REVENUE 
AND MARGINAL COST AREN’T 
EXACTLY EQUAL?
The optimal output rule says that to maximize 
profit, you should produce the quantity at 
which marginal revenue is equal to marginal 
cost. But what do you do if there is no out-
put level at which marginal revenue equals 
marginal cost? In that case, you produce the 
largest quantity for which marginal revenue 
exceeds marginal cost. This is the case in 
Table 12-2 at an output of 5 bushels. The 
simpler version of the optimal output rule 
applies when production involves large num-
bers, such as hundreds or thousands of units. 
In such cases marginal cost comes in small 
increments, and there is always a level of 
output at which marginal cost almost exactly 
equals marginal revenue.
The marginal revenue curve 
shows how marginal revenue varies 
as output varies.
The Price - Taking Firm’s Profit - Maximizing Quantity of Output
12-1
At the profit-maximizing quantity of output, 
the market price is equal to marginal cost. 
It is located at the point where the margin-
al cost curve crosses the marginal revenue 
curve, which is a horizontal line at the mar-
ket price. Here, the profit-maximizing point 
is at an output of 5 bushels of tomatoes, 
the output quantity at point E.

first step answer an “either–or” question: should it produce at all? If the answer to that 
question is yes, it then proceeds to the second step—a “how much” decision: maximiz-
ing profit by choosing the quantity of output at which marginal cost is equal to price.
To understand why the first step in the production decision involves an 
“either–or” question, we need to ask how we determine whether it is profitable or 
unprofitable to produce at all.
When Is Production Profitable?
Recall from Chapter 9 that a firm’s decision whether or not to stay in a given busi-
ness depends on its economic profit—the measure of profit based on the oppor-
tunity cost of resources used in the business. To put it a slightly different way: 
in the calculation of economic profit, a firm’s total cost incorporates the implicit 
cost—the benefits forgone in the next best use of the firm’s resources—as well as 
the explicit cost in the form of actual cash outlays.
In contrast, accounting profit is profit calculated using only the explicit costs 
incurred by the firm. This means that economic profit incorporates the oppor-
tunity cost of resources owned by the firm and used in the production of output, 
while accounting profit does not.
A firm may make positive accounting profit while making zero or even nega-
tive economic profit. It’s important to understand clearly that a firm’s decision to 
produce or not, to stay in business or to close down permanently, should be based 
on economic profit, not accounting profit. 
So we will assume, as we always do, that the cost numbers given in Tables 12-1 and 
12-2 include all costs, implicit as well as explicit, and that the profit numbers in Table 
12-1 are therefore economic profit. So what determines whether Jennifer and Jason’s 
farm earns a profit or generates a loss? The answer is that, given the farm’s cost curves, 
whether or not it is profitable depends on the market price of tomatoes—specifically, 
whether the market price is more or less than the farm’s minimum average total cost.
In Table 12-3 we calculate short - run average variable cost and short - run aver-
age total cost for Jennifer and Jason’s farm. These are short - run values because 
we take fixed cost as given. (We’ll 
turn to the effects of changing 
fixed cost shortly.) The short-run 
average total cost curve, ATC, is 
shown in Figure 12-2, along with 
the marginal cost curve, MC, from 
Figure 12-1. As you can see, aver-
age total cost is minimized at 
point C, corresponding to an out-
put of 4 bushels—the minimum - 
cost output—and an average total 
cost of $14 per bushel.
To see how these curves can be 
used to decide whether production 
is profitable or unprofitable, recall 
that profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost, TR − TC. This means:
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which TR > TC, the firm is profitable.
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which TR = TC, the firm breaks even.
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which TR < TC, the firm incurs a loss.
We can also express this idea in terms of revenue and cost per unit of output. 
If we divide profit by the number of units of output, Q, we obtain the following 
expression for profit per unit of output:
(12-4) Profit/Q = TR/Q − TC/Q

TR/Q is average revenue, which is the market price. TC/Q is average total cost. So 
a firm is profitable if the market price for its product is more than the average 
total cost of the quantity the firm produces; a firm loses money if the market 
price is less than average total cost of the quantity the firm produces. This means:
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which P > ATC, the firm is profitable.
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which P = ATC, the firm breaks even.
 • If the firm produces a quantity at which P < ATC, the firm incurs a loss.
Figure 12-3 illustrates this result, showing how the market price determines 
whether a firm is profitable. It also shows how profits are depicted graphically. 
Each panel shows the marginal cost curve, MC, and the short - run average total 
cost curve, ATC. Average total cost is minimized at point C. Panel (a) shows the 
case we have already analyzed, in which the market price of tomatoes is $18 per 
bushel. Panel (b) shows the case in which the market price of tomatoes is lower, 
$10 per bushel.
In panel (a), we see that at a price of $18 per bushel the profit - maximizing 
quantity of output is 5 bushels, indicated by point E, where the marginal cost 
curve, MC, intersects the marginal revenue curve—which for a price - taking firm 
is a horizontal line at the market price. At that quantity of output, average total 
cost is $14.40 per bushel, indicated by point Z. Since the price per bushel exceeds 
average total cost per bushel, Jennifer and Jason’s farm is profitable.
Jennifer and Jason’s total profit when the market price is $18 is represented by 
the area of the shaded rectangle in panel (a). To see why, notice that total profit 
can be expressed in terms of profit per unit:
(12-5) Profit = TR − TC = (TR/Q − TC/Q) × Q
or, equivalently,
 
Profit = (P − ATC) × Q

This figure shows the marginal cost curve, MC, 
and the short-run average total cost curve, ATC. 
When the market price is $14, output will be 4 
bushels of tomatoes (the minimum-cost output), 
represented by point C. The price of $14, equal 
to the firm’s minimum average total cost, is the 
firm’s break-even price.

since P is equal to TR/Q and ATC is equal to TC/Q. The height of the shaded rect-
angle in panel (a) corresponds to the vertical distance between points E and Z. It 
is equal to P − ATC = $18.00 − $14.40 = $3.60 per bushel. The shaded rectangle has 
a width equal to the output: Q = 5 bushels. So the area of that rectangle is equal 
to Jennifer and Jason’s profit: 5 bushels × $3.60 profit per bushel = $18—the same 
number we calculated in Table 12-1.
What about the situation illustrated in panel (b)? Here the market price of 
tomatoes is $10 per bushel. Setting price equal to marginal cost leads to a profit -
maximizing output of 3 bushels, indicated by point A. At this output, Jennifer 
and Jason have an average total cost of $14.67 per bushel, indicated by point Y. At 
Profitability and the Market Price
12-3
In panel (a) the market price is $18. The 
farm is profitable because price exceeds 
minimum average total cost, the break-
even price, $14. The farm’s optimal 
output choice is indicated by point E, 
corresponding to an output of 5 bushels. 
The average total cost of producing 5 
bushels is indicated by point Z on the 
ATC curve, corresponding to an amount 
of $14.40. The vertical distance between 
E and Z corresponds to the farm’s per-
unit profit, $18.00 − $14.40 = $3.60. 
Total profit is given by the area of the 
shaded rectangle, 5 × $3.60 = $18.00. 
In panel (b) the market price is $10; the 
farm is unprofitable because the price 
falls below the minimum average total 
cost, $14. The farm’s optimal output 
choice when producing is indicated by 
point A, corresponding to an output of 
3 bushels. The farm’s per-unit loss, 
$14.67 − $10.00 = $4.67, is represented 
by the vertical distance between A and 
Y. The farm’s total loss is represented 
by the shaded rectangle, 3 × $4.67 = 
$14.00 (adjusted for rounding error).

their profit - maximizing output quantity—3 bushels—average total cost exceeds 
the market price. This means that Jennifer and Jason’s farm generates a loss, not 
a profit.
How much do they lose by producing when the market price is $10? On each 
bushel they lose ATC − P = $14.67 − $10.00 = $4.67, an amount corresponding to 
the vertical distance between points A and Y. And they would produce 3 bushels, 
which corresponds to the width of the shaded rectangle. So the total value of the 
losses is $4.67 × 3 = $14.00 (adjusted for rounding error), an amount that corre-
sponds to the area of the shaded rectangle in panel (b).
But how does a producer know, in general, whether or not its business will 
be profitable? It turns out that the crucial test lies in a comparison of the market 
price to the producer’s minimum average total cost. On Jennifer and Jason’s farm, 
minimum average total cost, which is equal to $14, occurs at an output quantity 
of 4 bushels, indicated by point C. Whenever the market price exceeds minimum 
average total cost, the producer can find some output level for which the average 
total cost is less than the market price. In other words, the producer can find a 
level of output at which the firm makes a profit. So Jennifer and Jason’s farm will 
be profitable whenever the market price exceeds $14. And they will achieve the 
highest possible profit by producing the quantity at which marginal cost equals 
the market price.
Conversely, if the market price is less than minimum average total cost, there 
is no output level at which price exceeds average total cost. As a result, the firm 
will be unprofitable at any quantity of output. As we saw, at a price of $10—an 
amount less than minimum average total cost—Jennifer and Jason did indeed 
lose money. By producing the quantity at which marginal cost equals the market 
price, Jennifer and Jason did the best they could, but the best that they could do 
was a loss of $14. Any other quantity would have increased the size of their loss.
The minimum average total cost of a price - taking firm is called its break - 
even price, the price at which it earns zero profit. (Recall that’s economic profit.) 
A firm will earn positive profit when the market price is above the break - even 
price, and it will suffer losses when the market price is below the break - even 
price. Jennifer and Jason’s break - even price of $14 is the price at point C in 
Figures 12-2 and 12-3.
So the rule for determining whether a producer of a good is profitable 
depends on a comparison of the market price of the good to the producer’s break-
even price—its minimum average total cost:
 • Whenever the market price exceeds minimum average total cost, the producer 
is profitable.
 • Whenever the market price equals minimum average total cost, the producer 
breaks even.
 • Whenever the market price is less than minimum average total cost, the pro-
ducer is unprofitable.
The Short - Run Production Decision
You might be tempted to say that if a firm is unprofitable because the market 
price is below its minimum average total cost, it shouldn’t produce any output. 
In the short run, however, this conclusion isn’t right. In the short run, sometimes 
the firm should produce even if price falls below minimum average total cost. 
The reason is that total cost includes fixed cost—cost that does not depend on the 
amount of output produced and can only be altered in the long run. In the short 
run, fixed cost must still be paid, regardless of whether or not a firm produces. 
For example, if Jennifer and Jason have rented a tractor for the year, they have 
to pay the rent on the tractor regardless of whether they produce any tomatoes. 
Since it cannot be changed in the short run, their fixed cost is irrelevant to their 
decision about whether to produce or shut down in the short run.
The break - even price of a price -
taking firm is the market price at 
which it earns zero profit.

356    P A R T  6    T H E  P RO D U C T I O N  D EC I S I O N
Although fixed cost should play no role in the decision about whether to 
produce in the short run, other costs—variable costs—do matter. An example of 
variable costs is the wages of workers who must be hired to help with planting 
and harvesting. Variable costs can be saved by not producing; so they should play 
a role in determining whether or not to produce in the short run.
Let’s turn to Figure 12-4: it shows both the short - run average total cost 
curve, ATC, and the short - run average variable cost curve, AVC, drawn from the 
information in Table 12-3. Recall that the difference between the two curves—
the vertical distance between them—represents average fixed cost, the fixed 
cost per unit of output, FC/Q. Because the marginal cost curve has a “swoosh” 
shape—falling at first before rising—the short - run average variable cost curve 
is U-shaped: the initial fall in marginal cost causes average variable cost to fall 
as well, before rising marginal cost eventually pulls it up again. The short - run 
average variable cost curve reaches its minimum value of $10 at point A, at an 
output of 3 bushels.
We are now prepared to fully analyze the optimal production decision in the 
short run. We need to consider two cases:
 • When the market price is below minimum average variable cost
 • When the market price is greater than or equal to minimum average vari-
able cost
When the market price is below minimum average variable cost, the price the 
firm receives per unit is not covering its variable cost per unit. A firm in this 
situation should cease production immediately. Why? Because there is no level of 
output at which the firm’s total revenue covers its variable costs—the costs it can 
avoid by not operating. In this case the firm maximizes its profits by not produc-
ing at all—by, in effect, minimizing its losses. It will still incur a fixed cost in the 
short run, but it will no longer incur any variable cost. This means that the mini-
mum average variable cost is equal to the shut - down price, the price at which 
the firm ceases production in the short run.
When price is greater than minimum average variable cost, however, the 
firm should produce in the short run. In this case, the firm maximizes profit—
The Short - Run Individual Supply Curve
12-4
When the market price equals or 
exceeds Jennifer and Jason’s shut-
down price of $10, the minimum 
average variable cost indicated by 
point A, they will produce the output 
quantity at which marginal cost is 
equal to price. So at any price equal 
to or above the minimum average 
variable cost, the short-run individual 
supply curve is the firm’s marginal 
cost curve; this corresponds to the 
upward-sloping segment of the indi-
vidual supply curve. When market 
price falls below minimum aver-
age variable cost, the firm ceases 
operation in the short run. This cor-
responds to the vertical segment of 
the individual supply curve along the 
vertical axis.

or minimizes loss—by choosing the output quantity at which its marginal cost 
is equal to the market price. For example, if the market price of tomatoes is $18 
per bushel, Jennifer and Jason should produce at point E in Figure 12-4, corre-
sponding to an output of 5 bushels. Note that point C in Figure 12-4 corresponds 
to the farm’s break - even price of $14 per bushel. Since E lies above C, Jennifer 
and Jason’s farm will be profitable; they will generate a per - bushel profit of 
$18.00 − $14.40 = $3.60 when the market price is $18.
But what if the market price lies between the shut - down price and the break - 
even price—that is, between minimum average variable cost and minimum aver-
age total cost? In the case of Jennifer and Jason’s farm, this corresponds to prices 
anywhere between $10 and $14—say, a market price of $12. At $12, Jennifer and 
Jason’s farm is not profitable; since the market price is below minimum average 
total cost, the farm is losing the difference between price and average total cost 
per unit produced. Yet even if it isn’t covering its total cost per unit, it is covering 
its variable cost per unit and some—but not all—of the fixed cost per unit. If a 
firm in this situation shuts down, it would incur no variable cost but would incur 
the full fixed cost. As a result, shutting down generates an even greater loss than 
continuing to operate.
This means that whenever price lies between minimum average total cost 
and minimum average variable cost, the firm is better off producing some 
output in the short run. The reason is that by producing, it can cover its vari-
able cost per unit and at least some of its fixed cost, even though it is incurring 
a loss. In this case, the firm maximizes profit—that is, minimizes loss—by 
choosing the quantity of output at which its marginal cost is equal to the mar-
ket price. So if Jennifer and Jason face a market price of $12 per bushel, their 
profit - maximizing output is given by point B in Figure 12-4, corresponding to 
an output of 3.5 bushels.
It’s worth noting that the decision to produce when the firm is covering its 
variable costs but not all of its fixed cost is similar to the decision to ignore 
sunk costs, a concept we studied in Chapter 9. You may recall that a sunk cost 
is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recouped; and because 
it cannot be changed, it should have no effect on any current decision. In the 
short - run production decision, fixed cost is, in effect, like a sunk cost—it has 
been spent, and it can’t be recovered in the short run. This comparison also 
illustrates why variable cost does indeed matter in the short run: it can be 
avoided by not producing.
And what happens if market price is exactly equal to the shut - down price, 
minimum average variable cost? In this instance, the firm is indifferent between 
producing 3 units or 0 units. As we’ll see shortly, this is an important point when 
looking at the behavior of an industry as a whole. For the sake of clarity, we’ll 
assume that the firm, although indifferent, does indeed produce output when 
price is equal to the shut - down price.
Putting everything together, we can now draw the short - run individual 
supply curve of Jennifer and Jason’s farm, the red line in Figure 12-4; it shows 
how the profit- maximizing quantity of output in the short run depends on the 
price. As you can see, the curve is in two segments. The upward - sloping red seg-
ment starting at point A shows the short - run profit - maximizing output when mar-
ket price is equal to or above the shut- down price of $10 per bushel.
As long as the market price is equal to or above the shut- down price, 
Jennifer and Jason produce the quantity of output at which marginal cost is 
equal to the market price. That is, at market prices equal to or above the shut- 
down price, the firm’s short - run supply curve corresponds to its marginal cost 
curve. But at any market price below minimum average variable cost—in this 
case, $10 per bushel—the firm shuts down and output drops to zero in the 
short run. This corresponds to the vertical segment of the curve that lies on 
top of the vertical axis.
The short - run individual supply 
curve shows how an individual 
producer’s profit- maximizing output 
quantity depends on the market 
price, taking fixed cost as given.

Do firms really shut down temporarily without going out of business? Yes. In 
fact, in some businesses temporary shut - downs are routine. The most common 
examples are industries in which demand is highly seasonal, like outdoor amuse-
ment parks in climates with cold winters. Such parks would have to offer very 
low prices to entice customers during the colder months—prices so low that the 
owners would not cover their variable costs (principally wages and electricity). 
The wiser choice economically is to shut down until warm weather brings enough 
customers who are willing to pay a higher price.
Changing Fixed Cost
Although fixed cost cannot be altered in the short run, in the long run firms can 
acquire or get rid of machines, buildings, and so on. As we learned in Chapter 11, 
in the long run the level of fixed cost is a matter of choice. There we saw that a 
firm will choose the level of fixed cost that minimizes the average total cost for 
its desired output quantity. Now we will focus on an even bigger question fac-
ing a firm when choosing its fixed cost: whether to incur any fixed cost at all by 
remaining in its current business.
In the long run, a producer can always eliminate fixed cost by selling off its 
plant and equipment. If it does so, of course, it can’t ever produce—it has exited 
the industry. In contrast, a potential producer can take on some fixed cost by 
acquiring machines and other resources, which puts it in a position to produce—
it can enter the industry. In most perfectly competitive industries the set of pro-
ducers, although fixed in the short run, changes in the long run as firms enter or 
exit the industry.
Consider Jennifer and Jason’s farm once again. In order to simplify our analy-
sis, we will sidestep the problem of choosing among several possible levels of fixed 
cost. Instead, we will assume from now on that Jennifer and Jason have only one 
possible choice of fixed cost if they operate, the amount of $14 that was the basis 
for the calculations in Tables 12-1, 12-2, and 12-3. (With this assumption, Jennifer 
and Jason’s short - run average total cost curve and long - run average total cost 
curve are one and the same.) Alternatively, they can choose a fixed cost of zero if 
they exit the industry.
Suppose that the market price of organic tomatoes is consistently less than 
$14 over an extended period of time. In that case, Jennifer and Jason never 
fully cover their fixed cost: their business runs at a persistent loss. In the long 
run, then, they can do better by closing their business and leaving the indus-
try. In other words, in the long run firms will exit an industry if the market 
price is consistently less than their break - even price—their minimum average 
total cost.
Conversely, suppose that the price of organic tomatoes is consistently 
above the break - even price, $14, for an extended period of time. Because 
their farm is profitable, Jennifer and Jason will remain in the industry and 
continue producing.
But things won’t stop there. The organic tomato industry meets the criterion 
of free entry: there are many potential organic tomato producers because the nec-
essary inputs are easy to obtain. And the cost curves of those potential producers 
are likely to be similar to those of Jennifer and Jason, since the technology used 
by other producers is likely to be very similar to that used by Jennifer and Jason. 
If the price is high enough to generate profits for existing producers, it will also 
attract some of these potential producers into the industry. So in the long run 
a price in excess of $14 should lead to entry: new producers will come into the 
organic tomato industry.
As we will see in the next section, exit and entry lead to an important dis-
tinction between the short - run industry supply curve and the long - run industry 
supply curve.

been added to the American fuel supply by 2012 in order to reduce 
gasoline consumption. The unsurprising result of this mandate: the 
demand for corn skyrocketed, along with the price. In June 2011, a 
bushel of corn hit a high of $7.99, nearly quadruple the early January 
2005 price of $2.09. 
This sharp rise in the price of corn caught the eye of American 
farmers like Ronnie Gerik of Aquilla, Texas, who reduced the size 
of his cotton crop and increased his corn acreage by 40%. Overall, 
the U.S. corn acreage planted in 2011 was 9% more than the aver-
age planted over the previous decade. Like Gerik, other farmers 
substituted corn production for the production of other crops; for 
example, in 2011, soybean acreage was down around 3%. 
Although this sounds like a sure way to make a profit, Gerik 
and farmers like him were taking a gamble. Consider the cost 
of an important input, fertilizer. Corn requires more fertil-
izer than other crops, and with more farmers planting corn, 
the increased demand for fertilizer led to a price increase. In 
2006 and 2007, fertilizer prices surged to five times their 2005 
level; by 2011, they were still three times higher. Moreover, corn 
is more sensitive to the amount of rainfall than a crop like cotton. 
So farmers who plant corn in drought-prone places like Texas are

Although Gerik was taking a big gamble when he

decision made good economic sense.
Summing Up: The Perfectly Competitive Firm’s 
Profitability and Production Conditions
In this chapter, we’ve studied where the supply curve for a perfectly competi-
tive, price-taking firm comes from. Every perfectly competitive firm makes its 
production decisions by maximizing profit, and these decisions determine the 
supply curve. Table 12-4 summarizes the perfectly competitive firm’s profitabil-
ity and production conditions. It also relates them to entry into and exit from 
the industry.

increasing their risk of loss. Gerik had to incorporate into his calculations 
his best guess of what a dry spell would cost him. 
Despite all this, what Gerik and other farmers did made complete eco-
nomic sense. By planting more corn, each one moved up his or her individual 
short-run supply curve for corn production. And because the individual 
supply curve is the marginal cost curve, each farmer’s costs also went up 
because of the need to apply more inputs—inputs that are now more expen-
sive to obtain.
So the moral of the story is that farmers will increase their corn acreage until 
the marginal cost of producing corn is approximately equal to the market price 
of corn, which shouldn’t come as a surprise because corn production satisfies all 
the requirements of a perfectly competitive industry.

The Industry Supply Curve
W
hy will an increase in the demand for organic tomatoes lead to a large 
price increase at first but a much smaller increase in the long run? The 
answer lies in the behavior of the industry supply curve—the relation-
ship between the price and the total output of an industry as a whole. The industry 
supply curve is what we referred to in earlier chapters as the supply curve or the mar-
ket supply curve. But here we take some extra care to distinguish between the indi-
vidual supply curve of a single firm and the supply curve of the industry as a whole.
As you might guess from the previous section, the industry supply curve must 
be analyzed in somewhat different ways for the short run and the long run. Let’s 
start with the short run.
The Short - Run Industry Supply Curve
Recall that in the short run the number of producers in an industry is fixed—there 
is no entry or exit. And you may also remember from Chapter 3 that the industry 
supply curve is the horizontal sum of the individual supply curves of all producers—
you find it by summing the total output across all suppliers at every given price. We 
will do that exercise here under the assumption that all the producers are alike—an 
assumption that makes the derivation particularly simple. So let’s assume that there 
are 100 organic tomato farms, each with the same costs as Jennifer and Jason’s farm.
Each of these 100 farms will have an individual short - run supply curve like the 
one in Figure 12-4. At a price below $10, no farms will produce. At a price of more 
than $10, each farm will produce the quantity of output at which its marginal cost 
• A producer chooses output accord-
ing to the optimal output rule. For a 
price - taking firm, marginal revenue 
is equal to price and it chooses out-
put according to the price - taking 
firm’s optimal output rule.
• A firm is profitable whenever price 
exceeds its break - even price, equal 
to its minimum average total cost. 
Below that price it is unprofitable. It 
breaks even when price is equal to 
its break - even price.
• Fixed cost is irrelevant to the firm’s 
optimal short - run production 
decision. When price exceeds its 
shut- down price, minimum average 
variable cost, the price - taking firm 
produces the quantity of output at 
which marginal cost equals price. 
When price is lower than its shut- 
down price, it ceases production in 
the short run. This defines the firm’s 
short - run individual supply curve.
• Over time, fixed cost matters. If 
price consistently falls below mini-
mum average total cost, a firm will 
exit the industry. If price exceeds 
minimum average total cost, the 
firm is profitable and will remain in 
the industry; other firms will enter 
the industry in the long run.
 Quick Review
The industry supply curve shows 
the relationship between the price 
of a good and the total output of the 
industry as a whole.

is equal to the market price. As you can see from Figure 12-4, this will lead each 
farm to produce 4 bushels if the price is $14 per bushel, 5 bushels if the price is 
$18, and so on. So if there are 100 organic tomato farms and the price of organic 
tomatoes is $18 per bushel, the industry as a whole will produce 500 bushels, corre-
sponding to 100 farms × 5 bushels per farm, and so on. The result is the short - run 
industry supply curve, shown as S in Figure 12-5. This curve shows the quantity 
that producers will supply at each price, taking the number of producers as given.
The demand curve D in Figure 12-5 crosses the short - run industry supply curve 
at EMKT, corresponding to a price of $18 and a quantity of 500 bushels. Point EMKT 
is a short - run market equilibrium: the quantity supplied equals the quantity 
demanded, taking the number of producers as given. But the long run may look 
quite different, because in the long run farms may enter or exit the industry.
The Short - Run Market Equilibrium
12-5
The short-run industry supply curve, S, 
is the industry supply curve taking the 
number of producers—here, 100—as 
given. It is generated by adding together 
the individual supply curves of the 100 
producers. Below the shut-down price 
of $10, no producer wants to produce in 
the short run. Above $10, the short-run 
industry supply curve slopes upward, as 
each producer increases output as price 
increases. It intersects the demand curve, 
D, at point EMKT, the point of short-run 
market equilibrium, corresponding to a 
market price of $18 and a quantity of 500 
bushels.

The Long - Run Industry Supply Curve
Suppose that in addition to the 100 farms currently in the organic tomato busi-
ness, there are many other potential producers. Suppose also that each of these 
potential producers would have the same cost curves as existing producers like 
Jennifer and Jason if it entered the industry.
When will additional producers enter the industry? Whenever existing produc-
ers are making a profit—that is, whenever the market price is above the break - 
even price of $14 per bushel, the minimum average total cost of production. For 
example, at a price of $18 per bushel, new firms will enter the industry.
What will happen as additional producers enter the industry? Clearly, the 
quantity supplied at any given price will increase. The short - run industry supply 
curve will shift to the right. This will, in turn, alter the market equilibrium and 
result in a lower market price. Existing firms will respond to the lower market 
price by reducing their output, but the total industry output will increase because 
of the larger number of firms in the industry.
Figure 12-6 illustrates the effects of this chain of events on an existing firm 
and on the market; panel (a) shows how the market responds to entry, and panel 
(b) shows how an individual existing firm responds to entry. (Note that these 
two graphs have been rescaled in comparison to Figures 12-4 and 12-5 to better 
illustrate how profit changes in response to price.) In panel (a), S1 is the initial 
short - run industry supply curve, based on the existence of 100 producers. The 
The short - run industry supply 
curve shows how the quantity 
supplied by an industry depends 
on the market price given a fixed 
number of producers.
There is a short - run market 
equilibrium when the quantity 
supplied equals the quantity 
demanded, taking the number of 
producers as given.

initial short - run market equilibrium is at EMKT, with an equilibrium market 
price of $18 and a quantity of 500 bushels. At this price existing producers are 
profitable, which is reflected in panel (b): an existing firm makes a total profit 
represented by the green-shaded rectangle labeled A when market price is $18.
These profits will induce new producers to enter the industry, shifting the short - run 
industry supply curve to the right. For example, the short - run industry supply curve 
when the number of producers has increased to 167 is S2. Corresponding to this supply 
curve is a new short - run market equilibrium labeled DMKT, with a market price of $16 
and a quantity of 750 bushels. At $16, each firm produces 4.5 bushels, so that industry 
output is 167 × 4.5 = 750 bushels (rounded). From panel (b) you can see the effect of 
the entry of 67 new producers on an existing firm: the fall in price causes it to reduce 
its output, and its profit falls to the area represented by the striped rectangle labeled B.
Although diminished, the profit of existing firms at DMKT means that entry 
will continue and the number of firms will continue to rise. If the number of 
producers rises to 250, the short - run industry supply curve shifts out again to S3, 
and the market equilibrium is at CMKT, with a quantity supplied and demanded of 
1,000 bushels and a market price of $14 per bushel.
Like EMKT and DMKT, CMKT is a short - run equilibrium. But it is also something 
more. Because the price of $14 is each firm’s break - even price, an existing producer 
makes zero economic profit—neither a profit nor a loss, earning only the opportunity 
cost of the resources used in production—when producing its profit - maximizing 
output of 4 bushels. At this price there is no incentive either for potential producers

Point EMKT of panel (a) shows the initial short-run market 
equilibrium. Each of the 100 existing producers makes an 
economic profit, illustrated in panel (b) by the green rect-
angle labeled A, the profit of an existing firm. Profits induce 
entry by additional producers, shifting the short-run indus-
try supply curve outward from S1 to S2 in panel (a), result-
ing in a new short-run equilibrium at point DMKT, at a lower 
market price of $16 and higher industry output. Existing 
firms reduce output and profit falls to the area given by the 
striped rectangle labeled B in panel (b). Entry continues to 
shift out the short-run industry supply curve, as price falls 
and industry output increases yet again. Entry ceases at 
point CMKT on supply curve S3 in panel (a). Here market 
price is equal to the break-even price; existing producers 
make zero economic profits, and there is no incentive for 
entry or exit. So CMKT is also a long-run market equilibrium.

to enter or for existing producers to exit the industry. So CMKT corresponds to a long - 
run market equilibrium—a situation in which quantity supplied equals the quan-
tity demanded given that sufficient time has elapsed for producers to either enter or 
exit the industry. In a long - run market equilibrium, all existing and potential produc-
ers have fully adjusted to their optimal long - run choices; as a result, no producer has 
an incentive to either enter or exit the industry.
To explore further the significance of the difference between short - run and 
long- run equilibrium, consider the effect of an increase in demand on an industry 
with free entry that is initially in long - run equilibrium. Panel (b) in Figure 12-7 
shows the market adjustment; panels (a) and (c) show how an existing individual 
firm behaves during the process.
In panel (b) of Figure 12-7, D1 is the initial demand curve and S1 is the initial short - 
run industry supply curve. Their intersection at point XMKT is both a short - run and a long -
 run market equilibrium because the equilibrium price of $14 leads to zero economic 
profit—and therefore neither entry nor exit. It corresponds to point X in panel (a), where 
an individual existing firm is operating at the minimum of its average total cost curve.
Now suppose that the demand curve shifts out for some reason to D2. As shown 
in panel (b), in the short run, industry output moves along the short - run industry 
A market is in long - run market 
equilibrium when the quantity 
supplied equals the quantity 
demanded, given that sufficient time 
has elapsed for entry into and exit 
from the industry to occur.

Panel (b) shows how an industry adjusts in the short and 
long run to an increase in demand; panels (a) and (c) show 
the corresponding adjustments by an existing firm. Initially the 
market is at point XMKT in panel (b), a short-run and long-run 
equilibrium at a price of $14 and industry output of QX. An 
existing firm makes zero economic profit, operating at point X 
in panel (a) at minimum average total cost. Demand increases 
as D1 shifts rightward to D2 in panel (b), raising the market 
price to $18. Existing firms increase their output, and industry 
output moves along the short-run industry supply curve S1 to 
a short-run equilibrium at YMKT. Correspondingly, the existing 
firm in panel (a) moves from point X to point Y. But at a price 
of $18 existing firms are profitable. As shown in panel (b), in 
the long run new entrants arrive and the short-run industry 
supply curve shifts rightward, from S1 to S2. There is a new 
equilibrium at point ZMKT, at a lower price of $14 and higher 
industry output of QZ. An existing firm responds by moving 
from Y to Z in panel (c), returning to its initial output level and 
zero economic profit. Production by new entrants accounts 
for the total increase in industry output, QZ − QX. Like XMKT, 
ZMKT is also a short-run and long-run equilibrium: with exist-
ing firms earning zero economic profit, there is no incentive 
for any firms to enter or exit the industry. The horizontal line 
passing through XMKT and ZMKT, LRS, is the long-run industry 
supply curve: at the break-even price of $14, producers will 
produce any amount that consumers demand in the long run.

supply curve S1 to the new short - run market equilibrium at YMKT, the intersection of 
S1 and D2. The market price rises to $18 per bushel, and industry output increases 
from QX to QY. This corresponds to an existing firm’s movement from X to Y in 
panel (a) as the firm increases its output in response to the rise in the market price.
But we know that YMKT is not a long - run equilibrium, because $18 is higher 
than minimum average total cost, so existing producers are making economic 
profits. This will lead additional firms to enter the industry. Over time entry will 
cause the short - run industry supply curve to shift to the right. In the long run, the 
short - run industry supply curve will have shifted out to S2, and the equilibrium 
will be at ZMKT—with the price falling back to $14 per bushel and industry output 
increasing yet again, from QY to QZ. Like XMKT before the increase in demand, 
ZMKT is both a short - run and a long - run market equilibrium.
The effect of entry on an existing firm is illustrated in panel (c), in the move-
ment from Y to Z along the firm’s individual supply curve. The firm reduces its 
output in response to the fall in the market price, ultimately arriving back at its 
original output quantity, corresponding to the minimum of its average total cost 
curve. In fact, every firm that is now in the industry—the initial set of firms and 
the new entrants—will operate at the minimum of its average total cost curve, at 
point Z. This means that the entire increase in industry output, from QX to QZ, 
comes from production by new entrants.
The line LRS that passes through XMKT and ZMKT in panel (b) is the long - run 
industry supply curve. It shows how the quantity supplied by an industry responds 
to the price given that producers have had time to enter or exit the industry.
In this particular case, the long - run industry supply curve is horizontal at $14. 
In other words, in this industry supply is perfectly elastic in the long run: given 
time to enter or exit, producers will supply any quantity that consumers demand 
at a price of $14. Perfectly elastic long - run supply is actually a good assumption 
for many industries. In this case we speak of there being constant costs across the 
industry: each firm, regardless of whether it is an incumbent or a new entrant, faces 
the same cost structure (that is, they each have the same cost curves). Industries 
that satisfy this condition are industries in which there is a perfectly elastic supply 
of inputs—industries like agriculture or bakeries.
In other industries, however, even the long - run industry supply curve slopes 
upward. The usual reason for this is that producers must use some input that is in 
limited supply (that is, inelastically supplied). As the industry expands, the price of 
that input is driven up. Consequently, later entrants in the industry find that they 
have a higher cost structure than early entrants. An example is beach  front resort 
hotels, which must compete for a limited quantity of prime beachfront property. 
Industries that behave like this are said to have increasing costs across the industry.
It is possible for the long-run industry supply curve to slope downward. This can 
occur when an industry faces increasing returns to scale, in which average costs fall as 
output rises. Notice we said that the industry faces increasing returns. However, when 
increasing returns apply at the level of the individual firm, the industry usually ends 
up dominated by a small number of firms (an oligopoly) or a single firm (a monopoly). 
In some cases, the advantages of large scale for an entire industry accrue to all firms 
in that industry. For example, the costs of new technologies such as solar panels tend 
to fall as the industry grows because that growth leads to improved knowledge, a 
larger pool of workers with the right skills, and so on. Such benefits to industry size 
are known as external economies, which we’ll learn more about in Chapter 16. 
Regardless of whether the long - run industry supply curve is horizontal or upward 
sloping or even down  ward sloping, the long - run price elasticity of supply is higher 
than the short - run price elasticity whenever there is free entry and exit. As shown in 
Figure 12-8, the long - run industry supply curve is always flatter than the short - run 
industry supply curve. The reason is entry and exit: a high price caused by an increase 
in demand attracts entry by new producers, resulting in a rise in industry output and 
an eventual fall in price; a low price caused by a decrease in demand induces existing 
firms to exit, leading to a fall in industry output and an eventual increase in price.
The long - run industry supply 
curve shows how the quantity 
supplied responds to the price once 
producers have had time to enter or 
exit the industry.

The distinction between the short - run industry supply curve and the long - run 
industry supply curve is very important in practice. We often see a sequence of 
events like that shown in Figure 12-7: an increase in demand initially leads to a large 
price increase, but prices return to their initial level once new firms have entered 
the industry. Or we see the sequence in reverse: a fall in demand reduces prices in 
the short run, but they return to their initial level as producers exit the industry.
The Cost of Production and Efficiency in Long -Run 
Equilibrium
Our analysis leads us to three conclusions about the cost of production and efficiency 
in the long - run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry. These results will be 
important in our discussion in Chapter 13 of how monopoly gives rise to inefficiency.
First, in a perfectly competitive industry in equilibrium, the value of marginal 
cost is the same for all firms. That’s because all firms produce the quantity of 
output at which marginal cost equals the market price, and as price - takers they 
all face the same market price.
Second, in a perfectly competitive industry with free entry and exit, each firm 
will have zero economic profit in long - run equilibrium. Each firm produces the 
quantity of output that minimizes its average total cost—corresponding to point 
Z in panel (c) of Figure 12-7. So the total cost of production of the industry’s out-
put is minimized in a perfectly competitive industry. (The exception is an indus-
try with increasing costs across the industry. Given a sufficiently high market 
price, early entrants make positive economic profits, but the last entrants do not. 
Costs are minimized for later entrants, but not necessarily for the early ones.) 
The third and final conclusion is that the long - run market equilibrium of a 
perfectly competitive industry is efficient: no mutually beneficial transactions go 
unexploited. To understand this, we need to recall a fundamental requirement for 
efficiency from Chapter 4: all consumers who have a willingness to pay greater than 
or equal to sellers’ costs actually get the good. And we also learned that when a market 
is efficient (except under certain, well - defined conditions), the market price matches 
all consumers with a willingness to pay greater than or equal to the market price to all 
sellers who have a cost of producing the good less than or equal to the market price.
So in the long - run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry, production 
is efficient: costs are minimized and no resources are wasted. In addition, the 
Comparing the Short - Run and Long - Run Industry Supply Curves

The long-run industry supply curve may slope upward, but it is 
always flatter—more elastic—than the short-run industry supply 
curve. This is because of entry and exit: a higher price attracts 
new entrants in the long run, resulting in a rise in industry out-
put and a fall in price; a lower price induces existing producers 
to exit in the long run, generating a fall in industry output and 
an eventual rise in price.

PITFALLS
ECONOMIC PROFIT, AGAIN
Some readers may wonder why a 
firm would want to enter an indus-
try if the market price is only slight-
ly greater than the break-even 
price. Wouldn’t a firm prefer to go 
into another business that yields a 
higher profit?
The answer is that here, as 
always, when we calculate cost, 
we mean opportunity cost—that is, 
cost that includes the return a firm 
could get by using its resources 
elsewhere. And so the profit that 
we calculate is economic profit; if 
the market price is above the break- 
even level, no matter how slightly, 
the firm can earn more in this 
industry than they could elsewhere.

allocation of goods to consumers is efficient: every consumer willing to pay the 
cost of producing a unit of the good gets it. Indeed, no mutually beneficial trans-
action is left unexploited. Moreover, this condition tends to persist over time as 
the environment changes: the force of competition makes producers responsive 
to changes in consumers’ desires and to changes in technology.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
BALEING IN, BAILING OUT
“K
ing Cotton is back,” proclaimed a 2010 article in the 
Los Angeles Times, describing a cotton boom that 
had “turned great swaths of Central California a snowy white 
during harvest season.” Cotton prices were soaring: they more 
than tripled between early 2010 and early 2011. And farmers 
responded by planting more cotton.
What was behind the price rise? As we learned in Chapter 
3, it was partly caused by temporary factors, notably severe 
floods in Pakistan that destroyed much of that nation’s cot-
ton crop. But there was also a big rise in demand, especially 
from China, whose burgeoning textile and clothing industries 
demanded ever more raw cotton to weave into cloth. And all 
indications were that higher demand was here to stay.
So is cotton farming going to be a highly profitable busi-
ness from now on? The answer is no, because when an indus-
try becomes highly profitable, it draws in new producers, and that brings prices 
down. And the cotton industry was following the standard script.
For it wasn’t just the Central Valley of California that had turned “snowy 
white.” Farmers around the world were moving into cotton growing. “This sum-
mer, cotton will stretch from Queensland through northern NSW [New South 
Wales] all the way down to the Murrumbidgee valley in southern NSW,” declared 
an Australian report.
And by the summer of 2011 the entry of all these new producers was already 
having an effect. By the end of July, cotton prices were down 35% from their peak 
in early 2011. This still left prices high by historical standards, leaving plenty of 
incentive to expand production. But it was already clear that the cotton boom 
would eventually reach its limit—and that at some point in the not too distant 
future some of the farmers who had rushed into the industry would leave it again.

1. Which of the following events will induce firms to enter an industry? Which will induce 
firms to exit? When will entry or exit cease? Explain your answer.
a.  A technological advance lowers the fixed cost of production of every firm in the 
industry.
b.  The wages paid to workers in the industry go up for an extended period of time.
c.  A permanent change in consumer tastes increases demand for the good.
d.  The price of a key input rises due to a long-term shortage of that input.
2. Assume that the egg industry is perfectly competitive and is in long - run equilibrium with 
a perfectly elastic long - run industry supply curve. Health concerns about cholesterol 
then lead to a decrease in demand. Construct a figure similar to Figure 12-7, showing 
the short - run behavior of the industry and how long - run equilibrium is reestablished.
Solutions appear at back of book.

Expected Growth in Cell Phone 
Purchases in the United States, 2010–2016
Recently in Sunnyvale, California, Tri Trang walked into a Best Buy and found 
the perfect gift for his girlfriend, a $184.85 Garmin GPS system. A year earlier, he 
would have put the item in his cart and purchased it. Instead, he whipped out his 
Android phone; using an app that instantly compared Best Buy’s price to those 
of other retailers, he found the same item on Amazon.com for $106.75, with no 
shipping charges and no sales tax. Trang proceeded to buy it from Amazon, right 
there on the spot. 
It doesn’t stop there. TheFind, the most popular of the price-comparison sites, 
will also provide a map to the store with the best price, identify coupon codes and 
shipping deals, and supply other tools to help users organize their purchases. Terror
has been the word used to describe the reaction of brick-and-mortar retailers. 
Before the advent of apps like TheFind’s, a retailer could lure customers into 
its store with enticing specials, and reasonably expect them to buy other, more 
profitable things, too—with some prompting from salespeople. But those days 
are disappearing. A recent study by the consulting firm Accenture found that 73% 
of customers with mobile devices prefer to shop by phone rather than talk to a 
salesperson. Best Buy recently settled a lawsuit alleging that it posted web prices 
at in-store kiosks faster than the ones customers saw on their home computers, 
a maneuver that would have been quickly discovered by users of TheFind’s app.
Not surprisingly, use of TheFind’s app has increased at an extremely fast clip. 
From Black Friday 2009 (the day after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping day 
of the year) to Black Friday 2010, there was a 50-fold increase in the number of 
consumers visiting retail websites with their mobile devices. Indeed, retailers are 
expecting even more shoppers to use their phones to make purchases in the com-
ing years. Figure 12-9 illustrates their projections 
for dramatic growth in cell phone sales through 
2016. On TheFind, the most frequently searched 
items in stores are iPhones, iPads, video games, and 
other electronics. 
According to e-commerce experts, U.S. retailers 
have begun to alter their selling strategies in response. 
One strategy involves stocking products that manu-
facturers have slightly modified for the retailer, which 
allows the retailer to be their exclusive seller. In addi-
tion, some retailers, when confronted by an in-store 
customer wielding a lower price on a mobile device, 
will lower their price to avoid losing the sale.
Yet retailers are clearly frightened. As one ana-
lyst said, “Only a couple of retailers can play the 
lowest-price game. This is going to accelerate the 
demise of retailers who do not have either competi-
tive pricing or stand-out store experience.”
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. From the evidence in the case, what can you infer about whether or not the retail market for 
electronics satisfied the conditions for perfect competition before the advent of mobile-
device comparison shopping? What was the most important impediment to competition?
 2. What effect will the introduction of TheFind’s and similar apps have on competition in the 
retail market for electronics? On the profitability of brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy? 
What, on average, will be the effect on the consumer surplus of purchasers of these items?
 3. Why are some retailers responding by having manufacturers make exclusive versions of 
products for them? Is this trend likely to increase or diminish?

SUMMARY
 1. In a perfectly competitive market all producers 
are price - taking producers and all consumers are 
price - taking consumers—no one’s actions can 
influence the market price. Consumers are normally 
price- takers, but producers often are not. In a per-
fectly competitive industry, all producers are 
price- takers.
 2. There are two necessary conditions for a perfectly 
competitive industry: there are many producers, none 
of whom have a large market share, and the industry 
produces a standardized product or commodity—
goods that consumers regard as equivalent. A third 
condition is often satisfied as well: free entry and 
exit into and from the industry.
 3. A producer chooses output according to the optimal 
output rule: produce the quantity at which mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost. For a price - 
taking firm, marginal revenue is equal to price and 
its marginal revenue curve is a horizontal line at 
the market price. It chooses output according to the 
price - taking firm’s optimal output rule: produce 
the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. 
However, a firm that produces the optimal quantity 
may not be profitable.
 4. A firm is profitable if total revenue exceeds total cost 
or, equivalently, if the market price exceeds its break- 
even price—minimum average total cost. If market 
price exceeds the break - even price, the firm is profit-
able; if it is less, the firm is unprofitable; if it is equal, 
the firm breaks even. When profitable, the firm’s per - 
unit profit is P − ATC; when unprofitable, its per - unit 
loss is ATC − P.
 5. Fixed cost is irrelevant to the firm’s optimal short - run 
production decision, which depends on its shut - down 
price—its minimum average variable cost—and the 
market price. When the market price is equal to or 
exceeds the shut - down price, the firm produces the 
output quantity where marginal cost equals the 
market price. When the market price falls below the 
shut - down price, the firm ceases production in the 
short run. This generates the firm’s short - run indi-
vidual supply curve.
 6. Fixed cost matters over time. If the market price 
is below minimum average total cost for an extend-
ed period of time, firms will exit the industry in 
the long run. If above, existing firms are profitable 
and new firms will enter the industry in the 
long run.
 7. The industry supply curve depends on the time 
period. The short - run industry supply curve is the 
industry supply curve given that the number of firms is 
fixed. The short - run market equilibrium is given by 
the intersection of the short - run industry supply curve 
and the demand curve.
 8. The long - run industry supply curve is the indus-
try supply curve given sufficient time for entry into 
and exit from the industry. In the long - run market 
equilibrium—given by the intersection of the long- 
run industry supply curve and the demand curve—
no producer has an incentive to enter or exit. The 
long - run industry supply curve is often horizontal. 
It may slope upward if there is limited supply of 
an input, resulting in increasing costs across the 
industry. It may even slope downward, the case 
of decreasing costs across the industry. But it is 
always more elastic than the short - run industry 
supply curve.
 9. In the long - run market equilibrium of a competitive 
industry, profit maximization leads each firm to 
produce at the same marginal cost, which is equal 
to market price. Free entry and exit means that 
each firm earns zero economic profit—producing 
the output corresponding to its minimum aver
age total cost. So the total cost of production of 
an industry’s output is minimized. The outcome is 
efficient because every consumer with a willingness 
to pay greater than or equal to marginal cost gets 
the good.

and suggests that they increase their consumption of 
fish, especially raw fish. The sushi restaurant becomes 
very popular and its profit increases.

take and try to correct it.
 a. A profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive 
industry should select the output level at which the

 b. An increase in fixed cost lowers the profit-maximizing 
quantity of output produced in the short run.
 12. The production of agricultural products like wheat 
is one of the few examples of a perfectly competitive 
industry. In this question, we analyze results from a 
study released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
about wheat production in the United States in 1998.
 a. The average variable cost per acre planted with 
wheat was $107 per acre. Assuming a yield of 50 
bushels per acre, calculate the average variable cost 
per bushel of wheat.
 b. The average price of wheat received by a farmer 
in 1998 was $2.65 per bushel. Do you think the

average farm would have exited the industry in the 
short run? Explain.
c. With a yield of 50 bushels of wheat per acre, the 
average total cost per farm was $3.80 per bushel. 
The harvested acreage for rye (a type of wheat) in 
the United States fell from 418,000 acres in 1998 to 
274,000 in 2006. Using the information on prices 
and costs here and in parts a and b, explain why this 
might have happened. 
d. Using the above information, do you think the prices 
of wheat were higher or lower prior to 1998? Why?

A 
FEW YEARS AGO DE BEERS, THE 
world’s main supplier of diamonds, 
ran an ad urging men to buy their wives 
diamond jewelry. “She married you for 
richer, for poorer,” read the ad. “Let her 
know how it’s going.”
Crass? Yes. Effective? No question. 
For generations diamonds have been 
a symbol of luxury, valued not only for 
their appearance but also for their rarity.
But geologists will tell you that 
diamonds aren’t all that rare. In fact, 
according to the Dow Jones - Irwin Guide 
to Fine Gems and Jewelry, diamonds 
are “more common than any other gem- 
quality colored stone. They only seem 
rarer . . .”
Why do diamonds seem rarer than 
other gems? Part of the answer is a bril-
liant marketing campaign. (We’ll talk 
more about marketing and product dif-
ferentiation in Chapter 15.) But mainly 
diamonds seem rare because De Beers 
makes them rare: the company controls 
most of the world’s diamond mines and 
limits the quantity of diamonds supplied 
to the market.
Up to now we have concentrated 
exclusively on perfectly competitive 
markets—markets in which the produc-
ers are perfect competitors. But De Beers 
isn’t like the producers we’ve studied so 
far: it is a monopolist, the sole (or almost 
sole) producer of a good. Monopolists 
behave differently from producers in per-
fectly competitive industries: whereas 
perfect competitors take the price at 
which they can sell their output as given, 
monopolists know that their actions 
affect market prices and take that effect 
into account when deciding how much 
to produce. Before we begin our analysis, 
let’s step back and look at monopoly and 
perfect competition as parts of a broader 
system for classifying markets.
Perfect competition and monopoly 
are particular types of market structure. 
They are particular categories in a sys-
tem economists use to classify markets 
and industries according to two main 
dimensions. This chapter begins with 
a brief overview of types of market 
structure. It will help us here and in 
subsequent chapters to understand on 
a deeper level why markets differ and 
why producers in those markets behave 
quite differently.

Types of Market Structure
I
n the real world, there is a mind - boggling array of different markets. We 
observe widely different behavior patterns by producers across markets: in 
some markets producers are extremely competitive; in others, they seem 
somehow to coordinate their actions to avoid competing with one another; and, 
as we have just described, some markets are monopolies in which there is no 
competition at all. In order to develop principles and make predictions about 
markets and how producers will behave in them, economists have developed four 
principal models of market structure: perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, 
and monopolistic competition.
This system of market structures is based on two dimensions:
 • The number of producers in the market (one, few, or many)
 • Whether the goods offered are identical or differentiated
Differentiated goods are goods that are different but considered somewhat sub-
stitutable by consumers (think Coke versus Pepsi).
Figure 13-1 provides a simple visual summary of the types of market struc-
ture classified according to the two dimensions. In monopoly, a single producer 
sells a single, undifferentiated product. In oligopoly, a few producers—more than 
one but not a large number—sell products that may be either identical or differ-
entiated. In monopolistic competition, many producers each sell a differentiated 
product (think of producers of economics textbooks). And finally, as we know, in 
perfect competition many producers each sell an identical product.
You might wonder what determines the number of firms in a market: whether 
there is one (monopoly), a few (oligopoly), or many (perfect competition and 
monopolistic competition). We won’t answer that question here because it will 
be covered in detail later in this chapter and in Chapters 14 and 15, which ana-
lyze oligopoly and monopolistic competition. We will just briefly note that in the 
long run it depends on whether there are conditions that make it difficult for 
new firms to enter the market, such as control of necessary resources or inputs, 
increasing returns to scale in production, technological superiority, a network 
externality, or government regulations. When these conditions are present, indus-
tries tend to be monopolies or oligopolies; when they are not present, industries 
tend to be perfectly competitive or monopolistically competitive.
Types of Market Structure
13-1
The behavior of any given firm and the 
market it occupies are analyzed using 
one of four models of market structure—
monopoly, oligopoly, perfect competition, 
or monopolistic competition. This system 
for categorizing market structure is based 
on two dimensions: (1) whether products 
are differentiated or identical, and (2) the 
number of producers in the industry—one, 
a few, or many.

You might also wonder why some markets have differentiated products but oth-
ers have identical ones. The answer is that it depends on the nature of the good and 
consumers’ preferences. Some goods—soft drinks, economics textbooks, breakfast 
cereals—can readily be made into different varieties in the eyes and tastes of con-
sumers. Other goods—hammers, for example—are much less easy to differentiate.
Although this chapter is devoted to monopoly, important aspects of monopoly 
carry over to oligopoly and monopolistic competition. In the next section, we will 
define monopoly and review the conditions that make it possible. These same 
conditions, in less extreme form, also give rise to oligopoly. We then show how 
a monopolist can increase profit by limiting the quantity supplied to a market—
behavior that also occurs in oligopoly and monopolistic competition. As we’ll see, 
this kind of behavior is good for the producer but bad for consumers; it also causes 
inefficiency. An important topic of study will be the ways in which public policy 
tries to limit the damage. Finally, we turn to one of the surprising effects of monop-
oly—one that is very often present in oligopoly and monopolistic competition as 
well: the fact that different consumers often pay different prices for the same good.
The Meaning of Monopoly
T
he De Beers monopoly of South Africa was created in the 1880s by Cecil 
Rhodes, a British businessman. By 1880 mines in South Africa already 
dominated the world’s supply of diamonds. There were, however, many 
mining companies, all competing with each other. During the 1880s Rhodes 
bought the great majority of those mines and consolidated them into a single 
company, De Beers. By 1889 De Beers controlled almost all of the world’s dia-
mond production.
De Beers, in other words, became a monopolist. A producer is a monopolist 
if it is the sole supplier of a good that has no close substitutes. When a firm is a 
monopolist, the industry is a monopoly.
Monopoly: Our First Departure from Perfect Competition
As we saw in the Chapter 12 section “Defining Perfect Competition,” the supply 
and demand model of a market is not universally valid. Instead, it’s a model of 
perfect competition, which is only one of several different types of market struc-
ture. Back in Chapter 12 we learned that a market will be perfectly competitive 
only if there are many producers, all of whom produce the same good. Monopoly 
is the most extreme departure from perfect competition.
In practice, true monopolies are hard to find in the modern American econ-
omy, partly because of legal obstacles. A contemporary entrepreneur who tried 
to consolidate all the firms in an industry the way that Rhodes did would soon 
find himself in court, accused of breaking antitrust laws, which are intended to 
prevent monopolies from emerging. Oligopoly, a market structure in which there 
is a small number of large producers, is much more common. In fact, most of the 
goods you buy, from autos to airline tickets, are supplied by oligopolies, which we 
will examine in detail in Chapter 14.
Monopolies do, however, play an important role in some sectors of the 
economy, such as pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, our analysis of monopoly will 
provide a foundation for our later analysis of other departures from perfect com-
petition, such as oligopoly and monopolistic competition.
What Monopolists Do
Why did Rhodes want to consolidate South African diamond producers into a 
single company? What difference did it make to the world diamond market?
A monopolist is a firm that is the 
only producer of a good that has 
no close substitutes. An industry 
controlled by a monopolist is known 
as a monopoly.

Figure 13-2 offers a preliminary view of the effects of monopoly. It shows 
an industry in which the supply curve under perfect competition intersects the 
demand curve at C, leading to the price PC and the output QC.
Suppose that this industry is consolidated into a monopoly. The monopolist 
moves up the demand curve by reducing quantity supplied to a point like M, at 
which the quantity produced, QM, is lower and the price, PM, is higher than under 
perfect competition.
The ability of a monopolist to raise its price above the competitive level by 
reducing output is known as market power. And market power is what monopo-
ly is all about. A wheat farmer who is one of 100,000 wheat farmers has no market 
power: he or she must sell wheat at the going market price. Your local water utility 
company, though, does have market power: it can raise prices and still keep many 
(though not all) of its customers, because they have nowhere else to go. In short, 
it’s a monopolist.
The reason a monopolist reduces output and raises price compared to the 
perfectly competitive industry levels is to increase profit. Cecil Rhodes consoli-
dated the diamond producers into De Beers because he realized that the whole 
would be worth more than the sum of its parts—the monopoly would generate 
more profit than the sum of the profits of the individual competitive firms. As 
we saw in Chapter 12, under perfect competition economic profits normally 
vanish in the long run as competitors enter the market. Under monopoly the 
profits don’t go away—a monopolist is able to continue earning economic prof-
its in the long run.
In fact, monopolists are not the only types of firms that possess market power. 
In the next chapter we will study oligopolists, firms that can have market power 
as well. Under certain conditions, oligopolists can earn positive economic profits 
in the long run by restricting output like monopolists do.
But why don’t profits get competed away? What allows monopolists to be 
monopolists?
Market power is the ability of a 
firm to raise prices.
What a Monopolist Does
13-2
Under perfect competition, the price and quan-
tity are determined by supply and demand. 
Here, the competitive equilibrium is at C, 
where the price is PC and the quantity is QC. 
A monopolist reduces the quantity supplied to 
QM and moves up the demand curve from 
C to M, raising the price to PM.

Why Do Monopolies Exist?
A monopolist making profits will not go unnoticed by others. (Recall that this 
is “economic profit,” revenue over and above the opportunity costs of the firm’s 
resources.) But won’t other firms crash the party, grab a piece of the action, and 
drive down prices and profits in the long run? For a profitable monopoly to persist, 
something must keep others from going into the same business; that “something” 
is known as a barrier to entry. There are five principal types of barriers to entry: 
control of a scarce resource or input, increasing returns to scale, technological 
superiority, a network externality, and a government-created barrier to entry.
1. Control of a Scarce Resource or Input A monopolist that controls a 
resource or input crucial to an industry can prevent other firms from entering its 
market. Cecil Rhodes created the De Beers monopoly by establishing control over 
the mines that produced the great bulk of the world’s diamonds.
2. Increasing Returns to Scale Many Americans have natural gas piped 
into their homes, for cooking and heating. Invariably, the local gas company is a 
monopolist. But why don’t rival companies compete to provide gas?
In the early nineteenth century, when the gas industry was just starting up, 
companies did compete for local customers. But this competition didn’t last long; 
soon local gas supply became a monopoly in almost every town because of the 
large fixed costs involved in providing a town with gas lines. The cost of laying 
gas lines didn’t depend on how much gas a company sold, so a firm with a larger 
volume of sales had a cost advantage: because it was able to spread the fixed costs 
over a larger volume, it had lower average total costs than smaller firms. 
Local gas supply is an industry in which average total cost falls as output 
increases. As we learned in Chapter 11, this phenomenon is called increasing 
returns to scale. There we learned that when average total cost falls as output 
increases, firms tend to grow larger. In an industry characterized by increas-
ing returns to scale, larger companies are more profitable and drive out smaller 
ones. For the same reason, established companies have a cost advantage over any 
potential entrant—a potent barrier to entry. So increasing returns to scale can 
both give rise to and sustain monopoly.
A monopoly created and sustained by increasing returns to scale is called a 
natural monopoly. The defining characteristic of a natural monopoly is that it 
possesses increasing returns to scale over the range of output that is relevant for 
the industry. This is illustrated in Figure 13-3, showing the firm’s average total 
cost curve and the market demand curve, D. Here we can see that the natural 
monopolist’s ATC curve declines over the output levels at which price is greater 
than or equal to average total cost. So the natural monopolist has increasing 
returns to scale over the entire range of output for which any firm would want 
to remain in the industry—the range of output at which the firm would at least 
break even in the long run. The source of this condition is large fixed costs: when 
large fixed costs are required to operate, a given quantity of output is produced 
at lower average total cost by one large firm than by two or more smaller firms.
The most visible natural monopolies in the modern economy are local 
 utilities—water, gas, and sometimes electricity. As we’ll see later in this chapter, 
natural monopolies pose a special challenge to public policy.
3. Technological Superiority A firm that maintains a consistent technolog-
ical advantage over potential competitors can establish itself as a monopolist. 
For example, from the 1970s through the 1990s the chip manufacturer Intel was 
able to maintain a consistent advantage over potential competitors in both the 
design and production of microprocessors, the chips that run computers. But 
technological superiority is typically not a barrier to entry over the longer term: 
over time competitors will invest in upgrading their technology to match that 
To earn economic profits, a 
monopolist must be protected by a 
barrier to entry—something that 
prevents other firms from entering 
the industry.
A natural monopoly exists when 
increasing returns to scale provide a 
large cost advantage to a single firm 
that produces all of an industry’s 
output.

378    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
of the technology leader. In fact, in the last few years Intel found its technologi-
cal superiority eroded by a competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (also known 
as AMD), which now produces chips approximately as fast and as powerful as 
Intel chips.
We should note, however, that in certain high - tech industries, technological superi-
ority is not a guarantee of success against competitors because of network externalities.
4. Network Externality If you were the only person in the world with an 
Internet connection, what would that connection be worth to you? The answer, 
of course, is nothing. Your Internet connection is valuable only because other 
people are also connected. And, in general, the more people who are connected, 
the more valuable your connection is. This phenomenon, whereby the value of a 
good or service to an individual is greater when many others use the same good 
or service, is called a network externality—its value derives from enabling its 
users to participate in a network of other users.  
The earliest form of network externalities arose in transportation, where 
the value of a road or airport increased as the number of people who had 
access to it rose. But network externalities are especially prevalent in the 
technology and communications sectors of the economy. The classic case is 
computer operating systems. Worldwide, most personal computers run on 
Microsoft Windows. Although many believe that Apple has a superior operat-
ing system, the wider use of Windows in the early days of personal comput-
ers attracted more software development and technical support, giving it a 
lasting dominance.
When a network externality exists, the firm with the largest network of 
customers using its product has an advantage in attracting new customers, 
one that may allow it to become a monopolist. At a minimum, the dominant 
firm can charge a higher price and so earn higher profits than competitors. 
Moreover, a network externality gives an advantage to the firm with the 
“deepest pockets.” Companies with the most money on hand can sell the 
most goods at a loss with the expectation that doing so will give it the larg-
est customer base.
Increasing Returns to Scale Create Natural Monopoly
13-3
A natural monopoly can arise when fixed 
costs required to operate are very high. 
When this occurs, the firm’s ATC curve 
declines over the range of output at which 
price is greater than or equal to average total 
cost. This gives the firm increasing returns to 
scale over the entire range of output at which 
the firm would at least break even in the long 
run. As a result, a given quantity of output 
is produced more cheaply by one large firm 
than by two or more smaller firms.

5. Government - Created Barrier In 1998 the pharmaceutical company Merck 
introduced Propecia, a drug effective against baldness. Despite the fact that Propecia 
was very profitable and other drug companies had the know - how to produce it, no 
other firms challenged Merck’s monopoly. That’s because the U.S. government had 
given Merck the sole legal right to produce the drug in the United States. Propecia 
is an example of a monopoly protected by government - created barriers.
The most important legally created monopolies today arise from patents and 
copyrights. A patent gives an inventor the sole right to make, use, or sell that inven-
tion for a period that in most countries lasts between 16 and 20 years. Patents 
are given to the creators of new products, such as drugs or devices. Similarly, a 
copyright gives the creator of a literary or artistic work the sole rights to profit 
from that work, usually for a period equal to the creator’s lifetime plus 70 years.
The justification for patents and copyrights is a matter of incentives. If inventors 
are not protected by patents, they would gain little reward from their efforts: as 
soon as a valuable invention was made public, others would copy it and sell products 
based on it. And if inventors could not expect to profit from their inventions, then 
there would be no incentive to incur the costs of invention in the first place. Likewise 
for the creators of literary or artistic works. So the law gives a temporary monopoly 
that encourages invention and creation by imposing temporary property rights.
A patent gives an inventor a 
temporary monopoly in the use or 
sale of an invention.
A copyright gives the creator of a 
literary or artistic work sole rights to 
profit from that work.
Although providing cheap patent - protected drugs 
to patients in poor countries is a new phenomenon, 
charging different prices to consumers in different 
countries is not: it’s an example of price discrimination.
A monopolist will maximize profits by charging 
a higher price in the country with a lower price 
elasticity (the rich country) and a lower price in 
the country with a higher price elasticity (the poor 
country). Interestingly, however, drug prices can 
differ substantially even among countries with com-
parable income levels. How do we explain this? 
The answer is differences in regulation. 
This graph compares the prices paid by resi-
dents of various wealthy countries for a given bas-
ket of drugs. It shows that American consumers 
pay much more for their drugs than residents of 
other wealthy countries. For example, Spaniards 
and Australians pay approximately one-third of 
what Americans pay for drugs. The reason: gov-
ernments in these countries more actively regulate 
drug prices than the United States does, helping 
to keep drug prices affordable for their citizens.
To save money, it’s not surprising that 
Americans travel to Canada and Mexico to purchase their 
drugs, or buy them from abroad over the Internet.
Yet, American drug-makers contend that higher drug 
prices are necessary to cover the the high cost of research 
and development, which can run into the tens of millions of 
dollars over several years for successful drugs. Critics of 
the drug companies counter that American drug prices are 
in excess of what is needed for a socially desirable level of 
drug innovation. Instead, they say that drug companies are 
too often focused on developing drugs that generate high 
profits rather than those that improve health or save lives. 
What’s indisputable is that some level of profit is necessary 
to fund innovation.

Patents and copyrights are temporary because the law strikes a compromise. 
The higher price for the good that holds while the legal protection is in effect 
compensates inventors for the cost of invention; conversely, the lower price that 
results once the legal protection lapses and competition emerges benefits con-
sumers and increases economic efficiency.
Because the length of the temporary monopoly cannot be tailored to spe-
cific cases, this system is imperfect and leads to some missed opportunities. In 
some cases there can be significant welfare issues. For example, the violation of 
American drug patents by pharmaceutical companies in poor countries has been 
a major source of controversy, pitting the needs of poor patients who cannot 
afford retail drug prices against the interests of drug manufacturers that have 
incurred high research costs to discover these drugs. To solve this problem, some 
American drug companies and poor countries have negotiated deals in which 
the patents are honored but the American companies sell their drugs at deeply 
discounted prices. (This is an example of price discrimination, which we’ll learn 
more about later in this chapter.)
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
NEWLY EMERGING MARKETS: A DIAMOND 
 MONOPOLIST’S BEST FRIEND
W
hen Cecil Rhodes created the De Beers monopoly, it was a particularly 
opportune moment. The new diamond mines in South Africa dwarfed all 
previous sources, so almost all of the world’s diamond production was concen-
trated in a few square miles. 
Until recently, De Beers was able to extend its control 
of resources even as new mines opened. De Beers either 
bought out new producers or entered into agreements with 
local governments that controlled some of the new mines, 
effectively making them part of the De Beers monopoly. The 
most remarkable of these was an agreement with the former 
Soviet Union, which ensured that Russian diamonds would 
be marketed through De Beers, preserving its ability to con-
trol retail prices. De Beers also went so far as to stockpile 
a year’s supply of diamonds in its London vaults so that 
when demand dropped, newly mined stones would be stored 
rather than sold, restricting retail supply until demand and 
prices recovered.
However, over the past few years the De Beers monopoly 
has been under assault. Government regulators have forced 
De Beers to loosen its control of the market. For the first 
time, De Beers has competition: a number of independent 
companies have begun mining for diamonds in other African 
countries. In addition, high-quality, inexpensive synthetic dia-
monds have become an alternative to real gems, eating into De Beers’s profits. So 
does this mean an end to high diamond prices and De Beers’s high profits? 
Not really. Although today’s De Beers is more of a “near - monopolist” than a 
true monopolist, it still mines more of the world’s supply of diamonds than any 
other single producer. And it has been benefiting from newly emerging markets. 
Consumer demand for diamonds has soared in countries like China and India, 
leading to price increases.
Nevertheless, the economic crisis of 2009 put a serious dent in worldwide 
demand for diamonds. DeBeers responded by cutting 2011 production by 20% 
(compared to 2008). But affluent Chinese continue to be heavy buyers of diamonds, 
An increase in demand for diamonds in emerging markets has led 
to increased depletion of the world’s diamond mines and higher 
prices.

and DeBeers anticipates that Asian demand will accelerate the depletion of the 
world’s existing diamond mines. As a result, diamond analysts predict rough dia-
mond prices to rise by at least 5% per year for the next five years.
In the end, although a diamond monopoly may not be forever, a near-
monopoly with rising demand in newly emerging markets may be just as 
profitable.

How a Monopolist Maximizes Profit
A
s we’ve suggested, once Cecil Rhodes consolidated the competing diamond 
producers of South Africa into a single company, the industry’s behavior 
changed: the quantity supplied fell and the market price rose. In this sec-
tion, we will learn how a monopolist increases its profit by reducing output. And 
we will see the crucial role that market demand plays in leading a monopolist to 
behave differently from a perfectly competitive industry. (Remember that profit 
here is economic profit, not accounting profit.)
The Monopolist’s Demand Curve and Marginal Revenue
In Chapter 12 we derived the firm’s optimal output rule: a profit - maximizing 
firm produces the quantity of output at which the marginal cost of producing 
the last unit of output equals marginal revenue—the change in total revenue 
generated by that last unit of output. That is, MR = MC at the profit - maximizing 
quantity of output. Although the optimal output rule holds for all firms, we will 
see shortly that its application leads to different profit - maximizing output levels 
for a monopolist compared to a firm in a perfectly competitive industry—that is, 
a price - taking firm. The source of that difference lies in the comparison of the 
• In a monopoly, a single firm uses 
its market power to charge higher 
prices and produce less output than 
a competitive industry, generating 
profits in the short and long run.
• Profits will not persist in the long 
run unless there is a barrier to 
entry such as control of natural 
resources, increasing returns to 
scale, technological superiority, net-
work externalities, or legal restric-
tions imposed by governments.
• A natural monopoly arises when 
average total cost is declining over 
the output range relevant for the 
industry. This creates a barrier 
to entry because an established 
monopolist has lower average total 
cost than an entrant.
• In certain technology and commu-
nications sectors of the economy, a 
network externality enables a firm 
with the largest number of custom-
ers to become a monopolist.
• Patents and copyrights, government- 
created barriers, are a source of 
temporary monopoly that attempt to 
balance the need for higher prices as 
compensation to an inventor for the 
cost of invention against the increase 
in consumer surplus from lower 
prices and greater efficiency.

demand curve faced by a monopolist to the demand curve faced by an individual 
perfectly competitive firm.
In addition to the optimal output rule, we also learned in Chapter 12 that even 
though the market demand curve always slopes downward, each of the firms that 
make up a perfectly competitive industry faces a perfectly elastic demand curve 
that is horizontal at the market price, like DC in panel (a) of Figure 13-4. Any 
attempt by an individual firm in a perfectly competitive industry to charge more 
than the going market price will cause it to lose all its sales. It can, however, sell 
as much as it likes at the market price. As we saw in Chapter 12, the marginal 
revenue of a perfectly competitive producer is simply the market price. As a result, 
the price - taking firm’s optimal output rule is to produce the output level at which 
the marginal cost of the last unit produced is equal to the market price.
A monopolist, in contrast, is the sole supplier of its good. So its demand curve 
is simply the market demand curve, which slopes downward, like DM in panel (b) 
of Figure 13-4. This downward slope creates a “wedge” between the price of the 
good and the marginal revenue of the good—the change in revenue generated by 
producing one more unit.
Table 13-1 shows this wedge between price and marginal revenue for a 
monopolist, by calculating the monopolist’s total revenue and marginal revenue 
schedules from its demand schedule.
The first two columns of Table 13-1 show a hypothetical demand schedule for 
De Beers diamonds. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all diamonds are 
exactly alike. And to make the arithmetic easy, we suppose that the number of 
diamonds sold is far smaller than is actually the case. For instance, at a price of 
$500 per diamond, we assume that only 10 diamonds are sold. The demand curve 
implied by this schedule is shown in panel (a) of Figure 13-5.
The third column of Table 13-1 shows De Beers’s total revenue from selling 
each quantity of  diamonds—the price per diamond multiplied by the number

Because an individual perfectly competitive pro-

faces the horizontal demand curve DC, as shown

at the market price. A monopolist, though, can 
affect the price. Because it is the sole supplier 
in the industry, it faces the market demand curve

must lower the price; by reducing output, it raises 
the price.

of diamonds sold. The last column calculates marginal 
revenue, the change in total revenue from producing 
and selling another diamond.
Clearly, after the 1st diamond, the marginal revenue a 
monopolist receives from selling one more unit is less than 
the price at which that unit is sold. For example, if De Beers 
sells 10 diamonds, the price at which the 10th diamond is 
sold is $500. But the marginal revenue—the change in total 
revenue in going from 9 to 10 diamonds—is only $50.
Why is the marginal revenue from that 10th diamond 
less than the price? It is less than the price because an 
increase in production by a monopolist has two opposing 
effects on revenue:
 • A quantity effect. One more unit is sold, increasing 
total revenue by the price at which the unit is sold.
 • A price effect. In order to sell last unit, the mo nop olist 
must cut the market price on all units sold. This decreas-
es total revenue.
The quantity effect and the price effect when the 
monopolist goes from selling 9 diamonds to 10 diamonds 
are illustrated by the two shaded areas in panel (a) of 
Figure 13-5. Increasing diamond sales from 9 to 10 means 
moving down the demand curve from A to B, reducing the 
price per diamond from $550 to $500. The green - shaded 
area represents the quantity effect: De Beers sells the 10th 
diamond at a price of $500. This is offset, however, by the 
price effect, represented by the orange - shaded area. In 
order to sell that 10th diamond, De Beers must reduce the 
price on all its diamonds from $550 to $500. So it loses 
9 × $50 = $450 in revenue, the orange - shaded area. As 
point C indicates, the total effect on revenue of selling one 
more diamond—the marginal revenue—derived from an 
increase in diamond sales from 9 to 10 is only $50.
Point C lies on the monopolist’s marginal revenue 
curve, labeled MR in panel (a) of Figure 13-5 and taken 
from the last column of Table 13-1. The crucial point about 
the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve is that it is always 
below the demand curve. That’s because of the price effect: a monopolist’s marginal 
revenue from selling an additional unit is always less than the price the monopolist 
receives for the previous unit. It is the price effect that creates the wedge between 
the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve and the demand curve: in order to sell an 
additional diamond, De Beers must cut the market price on all units sold.
In fact, this wedge exists for any firm that possesses market power, such as 
an oligopolist as well as a monopolist. Having market power means that the firm 
faces a downward - sloping demand curve. As a result, there will always be a price 
effect from an increase in its output. So for a firm with market power, the mar-
ginal revenue curve always lies below its demand curve.
Take a moment to compare the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve with 
the marginal revenue curve for a perfectly competitive firm, one without market 
power. For such a firm there is no price effect from an increase in output: its 
marginal revenue curve is simply its horizontal demand curve. So for a perfectly 
competitive firm, market price and marginal revenue are always equal.
To emphasize how the quantity and price effects offset each other for a firm 
with market power, De Beers’s total revenue curve is shown in panel (b) of Figure 
13-5. Notice that it is hill - shaped: as output rises from 0 to 10  diamonds, total 

384    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
revenue increases. This reflects the fact that at low levels of output, the quantity 
effect is stronger than the price effect: as the monopolist sells more, it has to lower 
the price on only very few units, so the price effect is small. As output rises beyond 
10 diamonds, total revenue actually falls. This reflects the fact that at high levels 
of output, the price effect is stronger than the quantity effect: as the monopolist sells 
more, it now has to lower the price on many units of output, making the price effect 
very large. Correspondingly, the marginal revenue curve lies below zero at output 
levels above 10 diamonds. For example, an increase in diamond production from 11 
to 12 yields only $400 for the 12th diamond, simultaneously reducing the revenue 
from diamonds 1 through 11 by $550. As a result, the marginal revenue of the 12th 
diamond is −$150.
A Monopolist’s Demand, Total Revenue, and Marginal Revenue Curves
13-5
Panel (a) shows the monopolist’s 
demand and marginal revenue curves 
for diamonds from Table 13-1. The 
marginal revenue curve lies below the 
demand curve. To see why, consider 
point A on the demand curve, where 
9 diamonds are sold at $550 each, 
generating total revenue of $4,950. 
To sell a 10th diamond, the price on 
all 10 diamonds must be cut to $500, 
as shown by point B. As a result, 
total revenue increases by the green 
area (the quantity effect: +$500) but 
decreases by the orange area (the 
price effect: –$450). So the marginal 
revenue from the 10th diamond is $50 
(the difference between the green 
and orange areas), which is much 
lower than its price, $500. Panel (b) 
shows the monopolist’s total revenue 
curve for diamonds. As output goes 
from 0 to 10 diamonds, total revenue 
increases. It reaches its maximum 
at 10 diamonds—the level at which 
marginal revenue is equal to 0—and 
declines thereafter. The quantity effect 
dominates the price effect when total 
revenue is rising; the price effect domi-
nates the quantity effect when total 
revenue is falling.

The Monopolist’s Profit - Maximizing 
Output and Price
To complete the story of how a monopolist maximizes profit, we 
now bring in the monopolist’s marginal cost. Let’s assume that there 
is no fixed cost of production; we’ll also assume that the marginal 
cost of producing an additional diamond is constant at $200, no 
matter how many diamonds De Beers produces. Then marginal cost 
will always equal average total cost, and the marginal cost curve 
(and the average total cost curve) is a horizontal line at $200, as 
shown in Figure 13-6.
To maximize profit, the monopolist compares marginal cost 
with marginal revenue. If marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, 
De Beers increases profit by producing more; if marginal revenue 
is less than marginal cost, De Beers increases profit by producing 
less. So the monopolist maximizes its profit by using the optimal 
output rule:
(13-1) MR =  MC at the monopolist’s profit - maximizing 
quantity of output
The monopolist’s optimal point is shown in Figure 13-6. At A, the marginal 
cost curve, MC, crosses the marginal revenue curve, MR. The corresponding 
output level, 8 diamonds, is the monopolist’s profit - maximizing quantity of 
output, QM. The price at which consumers demand 8 diamonds is $600, so the 
monopolist’s price, PM, is $600—corresponding to point B. The average total 
cost of producing each diamond is $200, so the monopolist earns a profit of 
$600 − $200 = $400 per diamond, and total profit is 8 × $400 = $3,200, as indi-
cated by the shaded area.
The Monopolist’s Profit-Maximizing Output and Price
13-6
This figure shows the demand, marginal 
revenue, and marginal cost curves. 
Marginal cost per diamond is constant 
at $200, so the marginal cost curve 
is horizontal at $200. According to 
the optimal output rule, the profit- 
maximizing quantity of output for the 
monopolist is at MR = MC, shown by 
point A, where the marginal cost and 
marginal revenue curves cross at an 
output of 8 diamonds. The price De 
Beers can charge per diamond is found 
by going to the point on the demand 
curve directly above point A, which 
is point B here—a price of $600 per 
diamond. It makes a profit of $400 × 
8 = $3,200. A perfectly competitive 
industry produces the output level at 
which P = MC, given by point C, where 
the demand curve and marginal cost 
curves cross. So a competitive industry 
produces 16 diamonds, sells at a price 
of $200, and makes zero profit.

PITFALLS
FINDING THE MONOPOLY PRICE
In order to find the profit - maximizing quantity of 
output for a monopolist, you look for the point 
where the marginal revenue curve crosses the 
marginal cost curve. Point A in Figure 13-6 is an 
example.
However, it’s important not to fall into a com-
mon error: imagining that point A also shows the 
price at which the monopolist sells its output. It 
doesn’t: it shows the marginal revenue received 
by the monopolist, which we know is less than 
the price.
To find the monopoly price, you have to go 
up vertically from A to the demand curve. There 
you find the price at which consumers demand 
the profit - maximizing quantity. So the profit - 
maximizing price–quantity combination is always 
a point on the demand curve, like B in Figure 13-6.

Monopoly versus Perfect Competition
When Cecil Rhodes consolidated many independent diamond produc-
ers into De Beers, he converted a perfectly competitive industry into 
a monopoly. We can now use our analysis to see the effects of such a 
consolidation.
Let’s look again at Figure 13-6 and ask how this same market would 
work if, instead of being a monopoly, the industry were perfectly com-
petitive. We will continue to assume that there is no fixed cost and that 
marginal cost is constant, so average total cost and marginal cost are 
equal.
If the diamond industry consists of many perfectly competitive 
firms, each of those producers takes the market price as given. That 
is, each producer acts as if its marginal revenue is equal to the market 
price. So each firm within the industry uses the price - taking firm’s 
optimal output rule:
(13-2) P =  MC at the perfectly competitive firm’s profit - maximizing 
quantity of output
In Figure 13-6, this would correspond to producing at C, where the price 
per diamond, PC, is $200, equal to the marginal cost of production. So the 
profit - maximizing output of an industry under perfect competition, QC, is 16 
diamonds.
But does the perfectly competitive industry earn any profits at C? No: the 
price of $200 is equal to the average total cost per diamond. So there are no 
economic profits for this industry when it produces at the perfectly competitive 
output level.
We’ve already seen that once the industry is consolidated into a monopoly, 
the result is very different. The monopolist’s calculation of marginal revenue 
takes the price effect into account, so that marginal revenue is less than the 
price. That is,
(13-3) P > MR = MC at the monopolist’s profit - maximizing quantity of output
As we’ve already seen, the monopolist produces less than the competitive 
industry—8 diamonds rather than 16. The price under monopoly is $600, com-
pared with only $200 under perfect competition. The monopolist earns a positive 
profit, but the competitive industry does not.
So, just as we suggested earlier, we see that compared with a competitive 
industry, a monopolist does the following:
 • Produces a smaller quantity: QM < QC
 • Charges a higher price: PM > PC
 • Earns a profit
Monopoly: The General Picture
Figure 13-6 involved specific numbers and assumed that marginal cost was con-
stant, that there was no fixed cost, and, therefore, that the average total cost curve 
was a horizontal line. Figure 13-7 shows a more general picture of monopoly in 
action: D is the market demand curve; MR, the marginal revenue curve; MC, the 
marginal cost curve; and ATC, the average total cost curve. Here we return to 
the usual assumption that the marginal cost curve has a “swoosh” shape and the 
average total cost curve is U-shaped.
Applying the optimal output rule, we see that the profit - maximizing level of 
output is the output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, indicated by 
PITFALLS
IS THERE A MONOPOLY SUPPLY 
CURVE?
Given how a monopolist applies its optimal 
output rule, you might be tempted to ask 
what this implies for the supply curve of a 
monopolist. But this is a meaningless ques-
tion: monopolists don’t have supply curves.
Remember that a supply curve shows the 
quantity that producers are willing to sup-
ply for any given market price. A monopolist, 
however, does not take the price as given; it 
chooses a profit - maximizing quantity, taking 
into account its own ability to influence the 
price.

C H A P T E R  1 3    M O N O P O LY    387
point A. The profit - maximizing quantity of 
output is QM, and the price charged by the 
monopolist is PM. At the profit - maximizing 
level of output, the monopolist’s average 
total cost is ATCM, shown by point C.
Recalling how we calculated profit in 
Equation 12-5, profit is equal to the differ-
ence between total revenue and total cost. 
So we have:
(13-4) Profit  = TR − TC
= (PM × QM) − (ATCM × QM)
 = (PM − ATCM) × QM
Profit is equal to the area of the shaded 
rectangle in Figure 13-7, with a height of 
PM − ATCM and a width of QM.
In Chapter 12 we learned that a per-
fectly competitive industry can have prof-
its in the short run but not in the long run. 
In the short run, price can exceed average 
total cost, allowing a perfectly competitive 
firm to make a profit. But we also know 
that this cannot persist. In the long run, 
any profit in a perfectly competitive indus-
try will be competed away as new firms 
enter the market. In contrast, barriers to 
entry allow a monopolist to make profits 
in both the short run and the long run.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
SHOCKED BY THE HIGH PRICE OF ELECTRICITY
H
istorically, electric utilities were recognized as natural monopolies. A utility 
serviced a defined geographical area, owning the plants that generated  elec-
tricity as well as the transmission lines that delivered it to retail customers. The 
rates charged customers were regulated by the government, set at a level to cover 
the utility’s cost of operation plus a modest return on capital to its shareholders.
In the late 1990s, however, there was a move 
toward deregulation, based on the belief that compe-
tition would result in lower retail electricity prices. 
Competition was introduced at two junctures in the 
channel from power generation to retail customers: (1) 
distributors would compete to sell electricity to retail 
customers, and (2) power generators would compete to 
supply power to the distributors.
That was the theory, at least. According to one 
detailed report, 92% of households in states claiming 
to have retail choice actually cannot choose an alter-
native supplier of electricity because their wholesale 
market is still dominated by one power generator.  
What proponents of deregulation failed to realize 
is that the bulk of power generation still entails large 
up-front fixed costs. Although many small, gas-fired 
power generators have been built in the last decade,

In this case, the marginal cost curve has a “swoosh” shape and the aver-
age total cost curve is U-shaped. The monopolist maximizes profit by pro-
ducing the level of output at which MR = MC, given by point A, generating 
quantity QM. It finds its monopoly price, PM, from the point on the demand 
curve directly above point A, point B here. The average total cost of QM is 
shown by point C. Profit is given by the area of the shaded rectangle.

Although electric utilities were deregulated in the 1990s, currently there’s a 
trend toward reregulating them.

massive, coal-fired plants are still the cheapest and most plentiful form of elec-
tricity generation. 
In addition, deregulation and the lack of genuine competition enabled power 
generators to engage in market manipulation—intentionally reducing the amount 
of power they supplied to distributors in order to drive up prices. The most shock-
ing case occurred during the California energy crisis of 2000–2001 that brought 
blackouts and billions of dollars in electricity surcharges to homes and businesses. 
On audiotapes later acquired by regulators, workers could be heard discussing 
plans to shut down power plants during times of peak energy demand, joking 
about how they were “stealing” more than $1 million a day from California.
According to a Michigan State University study, from 2002 to 2006, average 
retail electricity prices rose 21% in regulated states versus 36% in fully deregu-
lated states. Another study found that from 1999 to 2007, the difference between 
prices charged to industrial retail customers in deregulated states and regulated 
states tripled.
Angry customers have prompted several states to shift into reverse, with 
Illinois, Montana, and Virginia moving to reregulate their industries. California 
has gone so far as to mandate that its electricity distributors reacquire their genera-
tion plants (and has plans to reregulate the industry). In addition, regulators have 
been on the prowl, fining utilities in Texas and New York for market manipulation.

Monopoly and Public Policy
I
t’s good to be a monopolist, but it’s not so good to be a monopolist’s customer. 
A monopolist, by reducing output and raising prices, benefits at the expense of 
consumers. But buyers and sellers always have conflicting interests. Is the con-
flict of interest under monopoly any different than it is under perfect competition?
The answer is yes, because monopoly is a source of inefficiency: the losses to 
consumers from monopoly behavior are larger than the gains to the monopolist. 
Because monopoly leads to net losses for the economy, governments often try 
either to prevent the emergence of monopolies or to limit their effects. In this 
section, we will see why monopoly leads to inefficiency and examine the policies 
governments adopt in an attempt to prevent this inefficiency.
• The crucial difference between a 
firm with market power, such as a 
monopolist, and a firm in a perfectly 
competitive industry is that perfect-
ly competitive firms are price- takers 
that face horizontal demand curves, 
but a firm with market power faces 
a downward - sloping demand curve.
• Due to the price effect of an 
increase in output, the marginal 
revenue curve of a firm with market 
power always lies below its demand 
curve. So a profit - maximizing 
monopolist chooses the output level 
at which marginal cost is equal to 
marginal revenue—not to price.
• As a result, the monopolist produces 
less and sells its output at a higher 
price than a perfectly competitive 
industry would. It earns profits in the 
short run and the long run.

Welfare Effects of Monopoly
By restricting output below the level at which marginal cost is equal to the market 
price, a monopolist increases its profit but hurts consumers. To assess whether this 
is a net benefit or loss to society, we must compare the monopolist’s gain in profit 
to the loss in consumer surplus. And what we learn is that the loss in consumer 
surplus is larger than the monopolist’s gain. Monopoly causes a net loss for society.
To see why, let’s return to the case where the marginal cost curve is horizontal, 
as shown in the two panels of Figure 13-8. Here the marginal cost curve is MC, 
the demand curve is D, and, in panel (b), the marginal revenue curve is MR.
Panel (a) shows what happens if this industry is perfectly competitive. 
Equilibrium output is QC; the price of the good, PC, is equal to marginal cost, and 
marginal cost is also equal to average total cost because there is no fixed cost and 
marginal cost is constant. Each firm is earning exactly its average total cost per 
unit of output, so there is no profit and no producer surplus in this equilibrium. 
The consumer surplus generated by the market is equal to the area of the blue - 
shaded triangle CSC shown in panel (a). Since there is no producer surplus when 
the industry is perfectly competitive, CSC also represents the total surplus.
Panel (b) shows the results for the same market, but this time assuming that 
the industry is a monopoly. The monopolist produces the level of output QM, at 
which marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue, and it charges the price PM. 
The industry now earns profit—which is also the producer surplus—equal to the 
area of the green rectangle, PSM. Note that this profit is surplus that has been 
captured from consumers as consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the blue 
triangle, CSM.
By comparing panels (a) and (b), we see that in addition to the redistribution 
of surplus from consumers to the monopolist, another important change has 
occurred: the sum of profit and consumer surplus—total surplus—is smaller 
under monopoly than under perfect competition. That is, the sum of CSM and

Panel (a) depicts a perfectly competitive industry: output 
is QC, and market price, PC, is equal to MC. Since price 
is exactly equal to each producer’s average total cost of 
production per unit, there is no profit and no producer 
surplus. So total surplus is equal to consumer surplus, the 
entire shaded area. Panel (b) depicts the industry under 
monopoly: the monopolist decreases output to QM and 
charges PM. Consumer surplus (blue area) has shrunk: a 
portion of it has been captured as profit (green area), and 
a portion of it has been lost to deadweight loss (yellow 
area), the value of mutually beneficial transactions that do 
not occur because of monopoly behavior. As a result, total 
surplus falls.

390    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
PSM in panel (b) is less than the area CSC in panel (a). In Chapter 7, we analyzed 
how taxes generated deadweight loss to society. Here we show that monopoly cre-
ates a deadweight loss to society equal to the area of the yellow triangle, DL. So 
monopoly produces a net loss for society.
This net loss arises because some mutually beneficial transactions do not 
occur. There are people for whom an additional unit of the good is worth more 
than the marginal cost of producing it but who don’t consume it because they are 
not willing to pay PM.
If you recall our discussion of the deadweight loss from taxes in Chapter 7 you 
will notice that the deadweight loss from monopoly looks quite similar. Indeed, 
by driving a wedge between price and marginal cost, monopoly acts much like a 
tax on consumers and produces the same kind of inefficiency.
So monopoly hurts the welfare of society as a whole and is a source of market 
failure. Is there anything government policy can do about it?
Preventing Monopoly
Policy toward monopoly depends crucially on whether or not the industry in 
question is a natural monopoly, one in which increasing returns to scale ensure 
that a bigger producer has lower average total cost. If the industry is not a natu-
ral monopoly, the best policy is to prevent monopoly from arising or break it up 
if it already exists. Let’s focus on that case first, then turn to the more difficult 
problem of dealing with natural monopoly.
The De Beers monopoly on diamonds didn’t have to happen. Diamond pro-
duction is not a natural monopoly: the industry’s costs would be no higher if it 
consisted of a number of independent, competing producers (as is the case, for 
example, in gold production).
So if the South African government had been worried about how a monopoly 
would have affected consumers, it could have blocked Cecil Rhodes in his drive 
to dominate the industry or broken up his monopoly after the fact. Today, govern-
ments often try to prevent monopolies from forming and break up existing ones.
De Beers is a rather unique case: for complicated historical reasons, it was 
allowed to remain a monopoly. But over the last century, most similar monopo-
lies have been broken up. The most celebrated example in the United States is 
Standard Oil, founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1870. By 1878 Standard Oil con-
trolled almost all U.S. oil refining; but in 1911 a court order broke the company 
into a number of smaller units, including the companies that later became Exxon 
and Mobil (and more recently merged to become ExxonMobil).
The government policies used to prevent or eliminate monopolies are known 
as antitrust policy, which we will discuss in the next chapter.
Dealing with Natural Monopoly
Breaking up a monopoly that isn’t natural is clearly a good idea: the gains to con-
sumers outweigh the loss to the producer. But it’s not so clear whether a natural 
monopoly, one in which a large producer has lower average total costs than small 
producers, should be broken up, because this would raise average total cost. For 
example, a town government that tried to prevent a single company from domi-
nating local gas supply—which, as we’ve discussed, is almost surely a natural 
monopoly—would raise the cost of providing gas to its residents.
Yet even in the case of a natural monopoly, a profit - maximizing monopo-
list acts in a way that causes inefficiency—it charges consumers a price that is 
higher than marginal cost and, by doing so, prevents some potentially beneficial 
transactions. Also, it can seem unfair that a firm that has managed to establish a 
monopoly position earns a large profit at the expense of consumers.
What can public policy do about this? There are two common answers.

C H A P T E R  1 3    M O N O P O LY    391
Public Ownership In many countries, the preferred answer to the problem 
of natural monopoly has been public ownership. Instead of allowing a private 
monopolist to control an industry, the government establishes a public agency to 
provide the good and protect consumers’ interests. In Britain, for example, tele-
phone service was provided by the state - owned British Telecom before 1984, and 
airline travel was provided by the state - owned British Airways before 1987. (These 
companies still exist, but they have been privatized, competing with other firms 
in their respective industries.)
There are some examples of public ownership in the United States. Passenger 
rail service is provided by the public company Amtrak; regular mail delivery is 
provided by the U.S. Postal Service; some cities, including Los Angeles, have pub-
licly owned electric power companies.
The advantage of public ownership, in principle, is that a publicly owned natural 
monopoly can set prices based on the criterion of efficiency rather than profit maxi-
mization. In a perfectly competitive industry, profit - maximizing behavior is efficient, 
because producers produce the quantity at which price is equal to marginal cost; 
that is why there is no economic argument for public ownership of, say, wheat farms.
Experience suggests, however, that public ownership as a solution to the prob-
lem of natural monopoly often works badly in practice. One reason is that pub-
licly owned firms are often less eager than private companies to keep costs down 
or offer high - quality products. Another is that publicly owned companies all too 
often end up serving political interests—providing contracts or jobs to people 
with the right connections. For example, Amtrak has notoriously provided train 
service at a loss to destinations that attract few passengers—but that are located 
in the districts of influential members of Congress.
Regulation In the United States, the more common answer has been to leave 
the industry in private hands but subject it to regulation. In particular, most local 
utilities like electricity, land line telephone service, natural gas, and so on are 
covered by price regulation that limits the prices they can charge.
We saw in Chapter 5 that imposing a price ceiling on a competitive industry is a 
recipe for shortages, black markets, and other nasty side effects. Doesn’t imposing 
a limit on the price that, say, a local gas company can charge have the same effects?
Not necessarily: a price ceiling on a monopolist need not create a shortage—in 
the absence of a price ceiling, a monopolist would charge a price that is higher 
than its marginal cost of production. So even if forced to charge a lower price—as 
long as that price is above MC and the monopolist at least breaks even on total 
output—the monopolist still has an incentive to produce the quantity demanded 
at that price.
Figure 13-9 shows an example of price regulation of a natural monopoly—a 
highly simplified version of a local gas company. The company faces a demand 
curve D, with an associated marginal revenue curve MR. For simplicity, we 
assume that the firm’s total costs consist of two parts: a fixed cost and variable 
costs that are incurred at a constant proportion to output. So marginal cost is 
constant in this case, and the marginal cost curve (which here is also the aver-
age variable cost curve) is the horizontal line MC. The average total cost curve 
is the downward - sloping curve ATC; it slopes downward because the higher the 
output, the lower the average fixed cost (the fixed cost per unit of output). Because 
average total cost slopes downward over the range of output relevant for market 
demand, this is a natural monopoly.
Panel (a) illustrates a case of natural monopoly without regulation. The 
unregulated natural monopolist chooses the monopoly output QM and charges 
the price PM. Since the monopolist receives a price greater than its average total 
cost, it earns a profit. This profit is exactly equal to the producer surplus in this 
market, represented by the green - shaded rectangle. Consumer surplus is given by 
the blue - shaded triangle.
In public ownership of a monopoly, 
the good is supplied by the 
government or by a firm owned by 
the government.
Price regulation limits the price 
that a monopolist is allowed to 
charge.

Now suppose that regulators impose a price ceiling on local gas deliveries—
one that falls below the monopoly price PM but above ATC, say, at PR in panel (a). 
At that price the quantity demanded is QR.
Does the company have an incentive to produce that quantity? Yes. If the price 
at which the monopolist can sell its product is fixed by regulators, the firm’s out-
put no longer affects the market price—so it ignores the MR curve and is willing 
to expand output to meet the quantity demanded as long as the price it receives 
for the next unit is greater than marginal cost and the monopolist at least breaks 
even on total output. So with price regulation, the monopolist produces more, at 
a lower price.
Of course, the monopolist will not be willing to produce at all if the imposed 
price means producing at a loss. That is, the price ceiling has to be set high 
enough to allow the firm to cover its average total cost. Panel (b) shows a situ-
ation in which regulators have pushed the price down as far as possible, at the 
level where the average total cost curve crosses the demand curve. At any lower 
price the firm loses money. The price here, P*
R , is the best regulated price: the 
monopolist is just willing to operate and produces Q*
R , the quantity demanded at 
that price. Consumers and society gain as a result.
The welfare effects of this regulation can be seen by comparing the shaded 
areas in the two panels of Figure 13-9. Consumer surplus is increased by the 
regulation, with the gains coming from two sources. First, profits are eliminated 
and added instead to consumer surplus. Second, the larger output and lower price 
lead to an overall welfare gain—an increase in total surplus. In fact, panel (b) 
illustrates the largest total surplus possible.
This all looks terrific: consumers are better off, profits are eliminated, and 
overall welfare increases. Unfortunately, things are rarely that easy in prac-
tice. The main problem is that regulators don’t have the information required 
to set the price exactly at the level at which the demand curve crosses the 
average total cost curve. Sometimes they set it too low, creating shortages;

at other times they set it too high. Also, regulated monopolies, like publicly 
owned firms, tend to exaggerate their costs to regulators and to provide infe-
rior quality to consumers.
Must Monopoly Be Controlled? Sometimes the cure is worse than the 
disease. Some economists have argued that the best solution, even in the case 
of natural monopoly, may be to live with it. The case for doing nothing is that 
attempts to control monopoly will, one way or another, do more harm than 
good—for example, by the politicization of pricing, which leads to shortages, or 
by the creation of opportunities for political corruption.
The following Economics in Action describes the case of cable television, a 
natural monopoly that has been alternately regulated and deregulated as politi-
cians change their minds about the appropriate policy.

T
he old saying “you can’t escape death and taxes” now 
has a modern twist: “you can’t escape death, taxes, 
and cable price increases.” For several years now, consum-
ers have seen their cable prices increase by around 5% 
every year, an amount far exceeding the rate of inflation.
Until 1984, cable prices were regulated locally. 
Because running a cable through a town entailed large 
fixed costs, cable TV was considered a natural monopoly. 
However, in 1984 Congress passed a law prohibiting most 
local governments from regulating cable prices. Prices 
increased sharply, and in 1992 the ensuing consumer 
backlash led to a new law that once again allowed local 
governments to set limits on cable prices. But cable 
operators found ways to circumvent the restrictions.
What went wrong?  One possible explanation is that 
the 1992 law applied only to “basic” packages, and those 
prices did indeed level off.  In response, cable operators 
began offering fewer channels in the basic package and 
charging more for premium channels like HBO.
Cable operators have defended their pricing policies. 
They claim that they have been forced to pay higher 
prices to content providers for popular shows. For exam-
ple, Time Warner Cable and the Fox network fought fiercely when their contract 
ended in late 2009, with Fox demanding to be paid $1 per subscriber to their 
content. When a deal was reached, it was reported that Time Warner had agreed 
to pay Fox more than 50 cents per subscriber. Yet critics counter that this defense 
is largely invalid because about 40% of the channels that command the highest 
prices are owned in whole or in part by the cable operators themselves. So in pay-
ing high prices for content, cable operators are actually profiting 
Cable operators also claim they need to raise prices to pay for system 
upgrades. Critics, however, once again dismiss the claim, asserting that upgrades 
pay for themselves through premium pricing and so should not have any effect on 
the price of non-upgraded services.
Critics also point to evidence that cable operators are exploiting their monop-
oly power. For example, a study by the Federal Communications Commission 
showed that cable operators have increased their take per subscriber by over 30% 
after factoring out all operating costs, including the cost of content. Similarly, the 
General Accounting Office found that prices are on average 17% lower in com-
munities with two cable operators compared to one. 
Cable prices have increase by around 5% every year, an amount far 
exceeding the rate of inflation.

TV-watchers should not give up hope just yet. Telephone companies Verizon 
and AT&T are now using their fiber-optic networks to compete with cable opera-
tors in many communities. And technological advances in Internet TV are begin-

Price Discrimination
U
p to this point, we have considered only the case of a single - price monop-
olist, one that charges all consumers the same price. As the term suggests, 
not all monopolists do this. In fact, many if not most monopolists find that 
they can increase their profits by charging different customers different prices 
for the same good: they engage in price discrimination.
The most striking example of price discrimination most of us encounter regularly 
involves airline tickets. Although there are a number of airlines, most routes in the 
United States are serviced by only one or two carriers, which, as a result, have market 
power and can set prices. So any regular airline passenger quickly becomes aware 
that the question “How much will it cost me to fly there?” rarely has a simple answer.
If you are willing to buy a nonrefundable ticket a month in advance and stay over 
a Saturday night, the round trip may cost only $150—or less if you are a senior citi-
zen or a student. But if you have to go on a business trip tomorrow, which happens 
to be Tuesday, and come back on Wednesday, the same round trip might cost $550. 
Yet the business traveler and the visiting grandparent receive the same  product—the 
same cramped seat, the same awful food (if indeed any food is served).
You might object that airlines are not usually monopolists—that in most flight 
markets the airline industry is an oligopoly. In fact, price discrimination takes 
place under oligopoly and monopolistic competition as well as monopoly. But it 
doesn’t happen under perfect competition. And once we’ve seen why monopolists 
sometimes price-discriminate, we’ll be in a good position to understand why it 
happens in other cases, too.
The Logic of Price Discrimination
To get a preliminary view of why price discrimination might be more profitable than 
charging all consumers the same price, imagine that Air Sunshine offers the only 
nonstop flights between Bismarck, North Dakota, and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Assume 
• By reducing output and rais-
ing price above marginal cost, a 
monopolist captures some of the 
consumer surplus as profit and 
causes deadweight loss. To avoid 
deadweight loss, government 
policy attempts to curtail monopoly 
behavior.
• When monopolies are “created” 
rather than natural, governments 
should act to prevent them from 
forming and break up existing ones.
• Natural monopoly poses a harder 
policy problem. One answer is public 
ownership, but publicly owned 
companies are often poorly run.
• A common response in the United 
States is price regulation. A price 
ceiling imposed on a monopolist 
does not create shortages as long 
as it is not set too low.
• There always remains the option of 
doing nothing; monopoly is a bad 
thing, but the cure may be worse 
than the disease.

its product to all consumers at the

that there are no capacity problems—the airline can fly as many planes as the number 
of passengers warrants. Also assume that there is no fixed cost. The marginal cost to 
the airline of providing a seat is $125, however many passengers it carries.
Further assume that the airline knows there are two kinds of potential pas-
sengers. First, there are business travelers, 2,000 of whom want to travel between 
the destinations each week. Second, there are students, 2,000 of whom also want 
to travel each week.
Will potential passengers take the flight? It depends on the price. The business 
travelers, it turns out, really need to fly; they will take the plane as long as the 
price is no more than $550. Since they are flying purely for business, we assume 
that cutting the price below $550 will not lead to any increase in business travel. 
The students, however, have less money and more time; if the price goes above 
$150, they will take the bus. The implied demand curve is shown in Figure 13-10.
So what should the airline do? If it has to charge everyone the same price, its 
options are limited. It could charge $550; that way it would get as much as pos-
sible out of the business travelers but lose the student market. Or it could charge 
only $150; that way it would get both types of travelers but would make signifi-
cantly less money from sales to business travelers.
We can quickly calculate the profits from each of these alternatives. If the 
airline charged $550, it would sell 2,000 tickets to the business travelers, earn-
ing total revenue of 2,000 × $550 = $1.1 million and incurring costs of 2,000 × 
$125 = $250,000; so its profit would be $850,000, illustrated by the shaded area 
B in Figure 13-10. If the airline charged only $150, it would sell 4,000 tickets, 
receiving revenue of 4,000 × $150 = $600,000 and incurring costs of 4,000 × $125 
= $500,000; so its profit would be $100,000. If the airline must charge everyone 
the same price, charging the higher price and forgoing sales to students is clearly 
more profitable.
What the airline would really like to do, however, is charge the business trav-
elers the full $550 but offer $150 tickets to the students. That’s a lot less than the 
price paid by business travelers, but it’s still above marginal cost; so if the air-
line could sell those extra 2,000 tickets to students, it would make an additional 
$50,000 in profit. That is, it would make a profit equal to the areas B plus S in 
Figure 13-10.
Two Types of Airline Customers
13-10
Air Sunshine has two types of customers, business 
travelers willing to pay at most $550 per ticket and 
students willing to pay at most $150 per ticket. There 
are 2,000 of each kind of customer. Air Sunshine 
has constant marginal cost of $125 per seat. If Air 
Sunshine could charge these two types of customers 
different prices, it would maximize its profit by charg-
ing business travelers $550 and students $150 per 
ticket. It would capture all of the consumer surplus 
as profit.

It would be more realistic to suppose that there is some “give” in the demand 
of each group: at a price below $550, there would be some increase in business 
travel; and at a price above $150, some students would still purchase tickets. But 
this, it turns out, does not do away with the argument for price discrimination. 
The important point is that the two groups of consumers differ in their sensitivity 
to price—that a high price has a larger effect in discouraging purchases by stu-
dents than by business travelers. As long as different groups of customers respond 
differently to the price, a monopolist will find that it can capture more consumer 
surplus and increase its profit by charging them different prices.
Price Discrimination and Elasticity
A more realistic description of the demand that airlines face would not specify 
particular prices at which different types of travelers would choose to fly. Instead, 
it would distinguish between the groups on the basis of their sensitivity to the 
price—their price elasticity of demand.
Suppose that a company sells its product to two easily identi-
fiable groups of people—business travelers and students. It just 
so happens that business travelers are very insensitive to the 
price: there is a certain amount of the product they just have 
to have whatever the price, but they cannot be persuaded to 
buy much more than that no matter how cheap it is. Students, 
though, are more flexible: offer a good enough price and they 
will buy quite a lot, but raise the price too high and they will 
switch to something else. What should the company do?
The answer is the one already suggested by our simpli-
fied example: the company should charge business travelers, 
with their low price elasticity of demand, a higher price than 
it charges students, with their high price elasticity of demand.
The actual situation of the airlines is very much like this 
hypothetical example. Business travelers typically place a high 
priority on being at the right place at the right time and are not 
very sensitive to the price. But nonbusiness travelers are fairly 
sensitive to the price: faced with a high price, they might take 
the bus, drive to another airport to get a lower fare, or skip the 
trip altogether.
So why doesn’t an airline simply announce different prices for business and 
nonbusiness customers? First, this would probably be illegal (U.S. law places 
some limits on the ability of companies to practice open price discrimination). 
Second, even if it were legal, it would be a hard policy to enforce: business travel-
ers might be willing to wear casual clothing and claim they were visiting family 
in Ft. Lauderdale in order to save $400.
So what the airlines do—quite successfully—is impose rules that indirectly 
have the effect of charging business and nonbusiness travelers different fares. 
Business travelers usually travel during the week and want to be home on the 
weekend; so the round - trip fare is much higher if you don’t stay over a Saturday 
night. The requirement of a weekend stay for a cheap ticket effectively separates 
business from nonbusiness travelers. Similarly, business travelers often visit sev-
eral cities in succession rather than make a simple round trip; so round - trip fares 
are much lower than twice the one - way fare. Many business trips are scheduled 
on short notice; so fares are much lower if you book far in advance. Fares are 
also lower if you purchase a last-minute ticket, taking your chances on whether 
you actually get a seat—business travelers have to make it to that meeting; people 
visiting their relatives don’t.
Because customers must show their ID at check - in, airlines make sure there 
are no resales of tickets between the two groups that would undermine their

ability to price - discriminate—students can’t buy cheap tickets and resell them to 
business travelers. Look at the rules that govern ticket - pricing, and you will see an 
ingenious implementation of profit - maximizing price discrimination.
Perfect Price Discrimination
Let’s return to the example of business travelers and students traveling between 
Bismarck and Ft. Lauderdale, illustrated in Figure 13-10, and ask what would 
happen if the airline could distinguish between the two groups of customers in 
order to charge each a different price.
Clearly, the airline would charge each group its willingness to pay—that is, as 
we learned in Chapter 4, the maximum that each group is willing to pay. For busi-
ness travelers, the willingness to pay is $550; for students, it is $150. As we have 
assumed, the marginal cost is $125 and does not depend on output, making the 
marginal cost curve a horizontal line. As we noted earlier, we can easily determine 
the airline’s profit: it is the sum of the areas of the rectangle B and the rectangle S.
In this case, the consumers do not get any consumer surplus! The entire sur-
plus is captured by the monopolist in the form of profit. When a monopolist is able 
to capture the entire surplus in this way, we say that it achieves perfect price 
discrimination.
In general, the greater the number of different prices a monopolist is able to 
charge, the closer it can get to perfect price discrimination. Figure 13-11 shows 
a monopolist facing a downward - sloping demand curve, a monopolist who we 
assume is able to charge different prices to different groups of consumers, with 
the consumers who are willing to pay the most being charged the most. In panel 
(a) the monopolist charges two different prices; in panel (b) the monopolist 
charges three different prices. Two things are apparent:
 • The greater the number of prices the monopolist charges, the lower the lowest 
price—that is, some consumers will pay prices that approach marginal cost.
 • The greater the number of prices the monopolist charges, the more money it 
extracts from consumers.
With a very large number of different prices, the picture would look like panel 
(c), a case of perfect price discrimination. Here, consumers least willing to buy 
the good pay marginal cost, and the entire consumer surplus is extracted as 
profit.
Both our airline example and the example in Figure 13-11 can be used to 
make another point: a monopolist that can engage in perfect price discrimina-
tion doesn’t cause any inefficiency! The reason is that the source of inefficiency 
is eliminated: all potential consumers who are willing to purchase the good at a 
price equal to or above marginal cost are able to do so. The perfectly price-dis-
criminating monopolist manages to “scoop up” all consumers by offering some 
of them lower prices than it charges others.
Perfect price discrimination is almost never possible in practice. At a 
fundamental level, the inability to achieve perfect price discrimination is a 
problem of prices as economic signals, a phenomenon we noted in Chapter 4. 
When prices work as economic signals, they convey the information needed to 
ensure that all mutually beneficial transactions will indeed occur: the market 
price signals the seller’s cost, and a consumer signals willingness to pay by 
purchasing the good whenever that willingness to pay is at least as high as the 
market price.
The problem in reality, however, is that prices are often not perfect sig-
nals: a consumer’s true willingness to pay can be disguised, as by a business 
traveler who claims to be a student when buying a ticket in order to obtain a 
lower fare. When such disguises work, a monopolist cannot achieve perfect 
price discrimination.
Perfect price discrimination takes 
place when a monopolist charges 
each consumer his or her willingness 
to pay—the maximum that the 
consumer is willing to pay.

However, monopolists do try to move in the direction of perfect price dis-
crimination through a variety of pricing strategies. Common techniques for price 
discrimination include the following:
 • Advance purchase restrictions. Prices are lower for those who purchase well 
in advance (or in some cases for those who purchase at the last minute). This 
separates those who are likely to shop for better prices from those who won’t.
 • Volume discounts. Often the price is lower if you buy a large quantity. For a 
consumer who plans to consume a lot of a good, the cost of the last unit—the 
marginal cost to the consumer—is considerably less than the average price. 
This separates those who plan to buy a lot and so are likely to be more sensi-
tive to price from those who don’t.
 • Two - part tariffs. With a two-part tariff, a customer plays a flat fee upfront and 
then a per-unit fee on each item purchased. So in a discount club like Sam’s 
Club (which is not a monopolist but a monopolistic competitor), you pay an

annual fee in addition to the cost of the items you purchase. So the cost of 
the first item you buy is in effect much higher than that of subsequent items, 
making the two - part tariff behave like a volume discount.
Our discussion also helps explain why government policies on monopoly typi-
cally focus on preventing deadweight losses, not preventing price discrimina-
tion—unless it causes serious issues of equity. Compared to a single - price 
monopolist, price discrimination—even when it is not perfect—can increase 
the efficiency of the market. If sales to consumers formerly priced out of the 
market but now able to purchase the good at a lower price generate enough 
surplus to offset the loss in surplus to those now facing a higher price and no 
longer buying the good, then total surplus increases when price discrimination 
is introduced.
An example of this might be a drug that is disproportionately prescribed 
to senior citizens, who are often on fixed incomes and so are very sensitive to 
price. A policy that allows a drug company to charge senior citizens a low price 
and everyone else a high price may indeed increase total surplus compared to 
a situation in which everyone is charged the same price. But price discrimina-
tion that creates serious concerns about equity is likely to be prohibited—for 
example, an ambulance service that charges patients based on the severity of 
their emergency.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
SALES, FACTORY OUTLETS, AND GHOST CITIES
H
ave you ever wondered why department stores occasionally hold sales, offer-
ing their merchandise for considerably less than the usual prices? Or why, 
driving along America’s highways, you sometimes encounter clusters of “factory 
outlet” stores, often a couple of hours’ drive from the nearest city?
These familiar features of the economic landscape are actually rather pecu-
liar if you think about them: why should sheets and towels be suddenly cheaper 
for a week each winter, or raincoats be offered for less in Freeport, Maine, 
than in Boston? In each case the answer is that the sellers—who are often oli-
gopolists or monopolistic competitors—are engaged in a subtle form of price 
discrimination.
Why hold regular sales of sheets and towels? Stores are aware that some 
consumers buy these goods only when they discover that they need them; they 
are not likely to put a lot of effort into searching for the best price and so have a 
relatively low price elasticity of demand. So the store wants to charge high prices 
for customers who come in on an ordinary day. But 
shoppers who plan ahead, looking for the lowest price, 
will wait until there is a sale. By scheduling such sales 
only now and then, the store is in effect able to price-
discriminate between high - elasticity and low - elasticity 
customers.
An outlet store serves the same purpose: by offering 
merchandise for low prices, but only at a considerable 
distance away, a seller is able to establish a separate 
market for those customers who are willing to make 
a significant effort to search out lower prices—and 
who therefore have a relatively high price elasticity of 
demand.
Finally, let’s return to airline tickets to mention 
one of the truly odd features of their prices. Often a 
flight from one major destination to another—say, 
from Chicago to Los Angeles—is cheaper than a much 
Periodic sales allow stores to price-discriminate between their high-
elasticity and low-elasticity customers.

shorter flight to a smaller city—say, from Chicago to Salt Lake City. Again, the 
reason is a difference in the price elasticity of demand: customers have a choice 
of many airlines between Chicago and Los Angeles, so the demand for any one 
flight is quite elastic; customers have very little choice in flights to a small city, so 
the demand is much less elastic.
But often there is a flight between two major destinations that makes a stop 
along the way—say, a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a stop in Salt Lake 
City. In these cases, it is sometimes cheaper to fly to the more distant city than to 
the city that is a stop along the way. For example, it may be cheaper to purchase 
a ticket to Los Angeles and get off in Salt Lake City than to purchase a ticket to 
Salt Lake City! It sounds ridiculous but makes perfect sense given the logic of 
monopoly pricing.
So why don’t passengers simply buy a ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles, 
but get off at Salt Lake City? Well, some do—but the airlines, understandably, 
make it difficult for customers to find out about such “ghost cities.” In addition, 
the airline will not allow you to check baggage only part of the way if you have 
a ticket for the final destination. And airlines refuse to honor tickets for return 
flights when a passenger has not completed all the legs of the outbound flight. 
All these restrictions are meant to enforce the separation of markets necessary to 
allow price discrimination.

1. True or false? Explain your answer.
a.  A single - price monopolist sells to some customers that a price - discriminating monop-
olist refuses to.
b.  A price - discriminating monopolist creates more inefficiency than a single - price 
monopolist because it captures more of the consumer surplus.
c.  Under price discrimination, a customer with highly elastic demand will pay a lower 
price than a customer with inelastic demand.
2. Which of the following are cases of price discrimination and which are not? In the cases 
of price discrimination, identify the consumers with high and those with low price elastic-
ity of demand.
a.  Damaged merchandise is marked down.
b.  Restaurants have senior citizen discounts.
c.  Food manufacturers place discount coupons for their merchandise in newspapers.
d.  Airline tickets cost more during the summer peak flying season.
Solutions appear at back of book.
• Not every monopolist is a single - 
price monopolist. Many monopo-
lists, as well as oligopolists and 
monopolistic competitors, engage 
in price discrimination.
• Price discrimination is profitable 
when consumers differ in their 
sensitivity to the price. A monopo-
list charging higher prices to low -
elasticity consumers and lower 
prices to high - elasticity ones.
• A monopolist able to charge each 
consumer his or her willingness to 
pay for the good achieves perfect 
price discrimination and does 
not cause inefficiency because all 
mutually beneficial transactions are 
exploited.
 Quick Review

401
The normally genteel world of book publishing was anything but in early 2010. 
War had broken out between Macmillan, a large book publisher, and Amazon.com, 
the giant Internet book retailer. As one industry insider commented, “. . . everyone 
thought they were witnessing a knife fight.” 
In early 2010, Amazon.com dominated the market for e-books because it 
owned the best technology platform for distribution at the time: the Kindle, 
which lets users download books directly from Amazon.com’s website. Although 
some publishers worried that readers’ switch from paper books to e-books would 
hurt sales, it seemed equally plausible that e-readers would actually increase 
them. Why? Because e-readers are so convenient to use and e-books can’t be 
turned into second-hand bargains. Yet book publishers were not at all happy with 
Amazon’s behavior in the e-book market.  
What had spoiled their relationship was Amazon’s policy of pricing every 
e-book at $9.99, a price at which it incurred a loss once it had paid the publisher 
for the book’s copyright. Amazon argued that publishers should welcome its pric-
ing because it would encourage more people to buy e-books. Publishers, though, 
worried that the $9.99 price would cut into their sales of printed books. Moreover, 
Amazon didn’t set a higher retail price for e-books by premium authors, thereby 
undermining their special status. Perhaps most worrying was the prospect that 
Amazon would come to permanently dominate the e-book market, becoming the 
gatekeeper between publishers and readers.
Despite publishers’ protests, Amazon refused to budge on its pricing. Matters 
came to a head in early February 2010, just as Apple was getting ready to launch 
its iPad, which has an e-book application. After John Sargent, the CEO of 
Macmillan, was unable to come to an agreement with Amazon, during a tense 
face-to-face meeting, the retailer removed all Macmillan books—paper and 
e-books, even best-sellers—from its website (except for those purchased through 
third-party sellers).
After a barrage of bad press, Amazon backed down and agreed to allow 
Macmillan to set the retail price for its books, with Amazon receiving a 30% com-
mission for each book sold, rather than the more common difference between 
the retail price and the wholesale price. Those terms closely replicated the terms 
agreed to by the largest publishers and Apple a week earlier.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. What accounts for Amazon.com’s willingness to incur a loss on its e-book sales? Relate 
its actions to a concept discussed in this chapter.
 2. Were publishers right to be fearful of Amazon.com’s pricing policy despite the fact that it 
probably generated higher book sales?
 3. How do you think the entry of the Apple iPad into the e-reader market affected the 
dynamics between publishers and Amazon.com? Why do you think a major publisher like 
Macmillan was able to force Amazon to retreat from its pricing policy?

KEY TERMS
SUMMARY
 1. There are four main types of market structure based 
on the number of firms in the industry and product 
differentiation: perfect competition, monopoly, oligopo-
ly, and monopolistic competition.
 2. A monopolist is a producer who is the sole supplier 
of a good without close substitutes. An industry con-
trolled by a monopolist is a monopoly.
 3. The key difference between a monopoly and a perfectly 
competitive industry is that a single perfectly com-
petitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve but a 
monopolist faces a downward - sloping demand curve. 
This gives the monopolist market power, the ability to 
raise the market price by reducing output compared to 
a perfectly competitive firm.
 4. To persist, a monopoly must be protected by a barrier 
to entry. This can take the form of control of a natural 
resource or input, increasing returns to scale that give 
rise to natural monopoly, technological superiority, a 
network externality, or government rules that prevent 
entry by other firms, such as patents or copyrights.
 5. The marginal revenue of a monopolist is composed of 
a quantity effect (the price received from the additional 
unit) and a price effect (the reduction in the price at 
which all units are sold). Because of the price effect, 
a monopolist’s marginal revenue is always less than 
the market price, and the marginal revenue curve lies 
below the demand curve.
 6. At the monopolist’s profit - maximizing output level, 
marginal cost equals marginal revenue, which is less 
than market price. At the perfectly competitive firm’s 
profit - maximizing output level, marginal cost equals 
the market price. So in comparison to perfectly com-
petitive industries, monopolies produce less, charge 
higher prices, and earn profits in both the short run 
and the long run.
 7. A monopoly creates deadweight losses by charging a 
price above marginal cost: the loss in consumer sur-
plus exceeds the monopolist’s profit. Thus monopo-
lies are a source of market failure and should be 
prevented or broken up, except in the case of natural 
monopolies.
 8. Natural monopolies can still cause deadweight 
losses. To limit these losses, governments sometimes 
impose public ownership and at other times impose 
price regulation. A price ceiling on a monopolist, as 
opposed to a perfectly competitive industry, need not 
cause shortages and can increase total surplus.
 9. Not all monopolists are single - price monopolists. 
Monopolists, as well as oligopolists and monopolistic 
competitors, often engage in price discrimination to 
make higher profits, using various techniques to dif-
ferentiate consumers based on their sensitivity to price 
and charging those with less elastic demand higher 
prices. A monopolist that achieves perfect price dis-
crimination charges each consumer a price equal to 
his or her willingness to pay and captures the total 
surplus in the market. Although perfect price discrimi-
nation creates no inefficiency, it is practically impos-
sible to implement.

PROBLEMS
 1. Each of the following firms possesses market power. 
Explain its source.
 a. Merck, the producer of the patented cholesterol-
lowering drug Zetia
 b. WaterWorks, a provider of piped water
 c. Chiquita, a supplier of bananas and owner of most 
banana plantations
 d. The Walt Disney Company, the creators of Mickey 
Mouse
 2. Skyscraper City has a subway system, for which a one-
way fare is $1.50. There is pressure on the mayor to 
reduce the fare by one-third, to $1.00. The mayor is 
dismayed, thinking that this will mean Skyscraper City 
is losing one-third of its revenue from sales of subway 
tickets. The mayor’s economic adviser reminds her that 
she is focusing only on the price effect and ignoring the 
quantity effect. Explain why the mayor’s estimate of a 
one-third loss of revenue is likely to be an overestimate. 
Illustrate with a diagram.
 3. Consider an industry with the demand curve (D) and 
marginal cost curve (MC) shown in the accompany-

 4. Bob, Bill, Ben, and Brad Baxter have just made a docu-
mentary movie about their basketball team. They are 
thinking about making the movie available for down-
load on the Internet, and they can act as a single-price 
monopolist if they choose to. Each time the movie is 
downloaded, their Internet service provider charges 
them a fee of $4. The Baxter brothers are arguing about 
which price to charge customers per download. The 
accompanying table shows the demand schedule for 
their film.

 5. Jimmy has a room that overlooks, from some distance, 
a major league baseball stadium. He decides to rent a 
telescope for $50.00 a week and charge his friends and 
classmates to use it to peep at the game for 30 seconds. 
He can act as a single-price monopolist for renting out 
“peeps.” For each person who takes a 30-second peep, it 
costs Jimmy $0.20 to clean the eyepiece. The accompa-
nying table shows the information Jimmy has gathered 
about the demand for the service in a given week.

he gives the landlady $0.20 for every peep he sells, 
she will stop complaining. What effect does the

the market for diamonds. De Beers has five potential 
customers: Raquel, Jackie, Joan, Mia, and Sophia. Each 
of these customers will buy at most one diamond—and 
only if the price is just equal to, or lower than, her 
willingness to pay. Raquel’s willingness to pay is $400; 
Jackie’s, $300; Joan’s, $200; Mia’s, $100; and Sophia’s, 
$0. De Beers’s marginal cost per diamond is $100. This

6. The marginal cost of producing diamonds is constant 
at $100. There is no fixed cost.
 a. If De Beers charges the monopoly price, how large 
is the individual consumer surplus that each buyer 
experiences? Calculate total consumer surplus by 
summing the individual consumer surpluses. How

Problem 6. De Beers is a monopolist, but it can now 
price-discriminate perfectly among all five of its poten-
tial customers. De Beers’s marginal cost is constant at

which customers will it sell diamonds and at what 
prices?
 b. How large is each individual consumer surplus? 
How large is total consumer surplus? Calculate 
producer surplus by summing the producer surplus 
generated by each sale.

group Mary and the Little Lamb. It produces the album 
with no fixed cost, but the total cost of downloading 
an album to a CD and paying Mary her royalty is $6

this creates by shading the deadweight loss from

b. If the government imposes a price ceiling equal to 
the marginal cost, $0.30, will the monopolist make 
profits or lose money? Shade the area of profit (or 
loss) for the monopolist. If the government does

continue to produce in the long run?
c. If the government imposes a price ceiling of $0.50, 
will the monopolist make a profit, lose money, or

 11. The movie theater in Collegetown serves two kinds 
of customers: students and professors. There are 900 
students and 100 professors in Collegetown. Each stu-
dent’s willingness to pay for a movie ticket is $5. Each 
professor’s willingness to pay for a movie ticket is $10. 
Each will buy at most one ticket. The movie theater’s 
marginal cost per ticket is constant at $3, and there is 
no fixed cost.
a. Suppose the movie theater cannot price-discrimi-
nate and needs to charge both students and profes-
sors the same price per ticket. If the movie theater 
charges $5, who will buy tickets and what will the 
movie theater’s profit be? How large is consumer 
surplus?
b. If the movie theater charges $10, who will buy movie 
tickets and what will the movie theater’s profit be? 
How large is consumer surplus?
c. Now suppose that, if it chooses to, the movie theater 
can price-discriminate between students and profes-
sors by requiring students to show their student ID. 
If the movie theater charges students $5 and profes-
sors $10, how much profit will the movie theater 
make? How large is consumer surplus?
12. A monopolist knows that in order to expand the quan-
tity of output it produces from 8 to 9 units it must 
lower the price of its output from $2 to $1. Calculate the 
quantity effect and the price effect. Use these results to 
calculate the monopolist’s marginal revenue of produc-
ing the 9th unit. The marginal cost of producing the 
9th unit is positive. Is it a good idea for the monopolist 
to produce the 9th unit?
13. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) is charged with promoting competition and chal-
lenging mergers that would likely lead to higher prices. 
Several years ago, Staples and Office Depot, two of 
the largest office supply superstores, announced their 
agreement to merge.
a. Some critics of the merger argued that, in many 
parts of the country, a merger between the two com-
panies would create a monopoly in the office supply 
superstore market. Based on the FTC’s argument 
and its mission to challenge mergers that would 
likely lead to higher prices, do you think it allowed 
the merger?
b. Staples and Office Depot argued that, while in 
some parts of the country they might create a 
monopoly in the office supply superstore market, 
the FTC should consider the larger market for all 
office supplies, which includes many smaller stores 
that sell office supplies (such as grocery stores and 
other retailers). In that market, Staples and Office 
Depot would face competition from many other, 
smaller stores. If the market for all office supplies 
is the relevant market that the FTC should con-
sider, would it make the FTC more or less likely to 
allow the merger?
14. Prior to the late 1990s, the same company that gener-
ated your electricity also distributed it to you over high-
voltage lines. Since then, 16 states and the District of 
Columbia have begun separating the generation from 
the distribution of electricity, allowing competition 
between electricity generators and between electricity 
distributors.
a. Assume that the market for electricity distribution 
was and remains a natural monopoly. Use a graph to 
illustrate the market for electricity distribution if the 
government sets price equal to average total cost.
b. Assume that deregulation of electricity generation cre-
ates a perfectly competitive market. Also assume that 
electricity generation does not exhibit the character-
istics of a natural monopoly. Use a graph to illustrate 
the cost curves in the long-run equilibrium for an 
individual firm in this industry.
15. Explain the following situations.
a. In Europe, many cell phone service providers give 
away for free what would otherwise be very expen-
sive cell phones when a service contract is pur-
chased. Why might a company want to do that?
b. In the United Kingdom, the country’s antitrust author-
ity banned the cell phone service provider Vodaphone 
from offering a plan that gave customers free calls to 
other Vodaphone customers. Why might Vodaphone 
have wanted to offer these calls for free? Why might 
a government want to step in and ban this practice? 
Why might it not be a good idea for a government to 
interfere in this way?

HE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS 
company Archer Daniels Midland 
(also known as ADM) has often 
described itself as “supermarket to the 
world.” Its name is familiar to many 
Americans not only because of its 
important role in the economy but also 
because of its advertising and sponsor-
ship of public television programs. But 
on October 25, 1993, ADM itself was 
on camera.
On that day executives from ADM 
and its Japanese competitor Ajinomoto 
met at the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, 
California, to discuss the market for 
lysine, an additive used in animal feed. 
(How is lysine produced? It’s excreted 
by genetically engineered bacteria.) 
In this and subsequent meetings, the 
two companies joined with several 
other competitors to set targets for the 
market price of lysine, behavior called 
price-fixing. Each company agreed to 
limit its production in order to achieve 
those targets. Agreeing on specific lim-
its would be their biggest challenge—
or so they thought.
What the participants in the meeting 
didn’t know was that they had a bigger 
problem: the FBI had bugged the room 
and was filming them with a camera 
hidden in a lamp.
What the companies were doing was 
illegal. To understand why it was illegal 
and why the companies were doing 
it anyway, we need to examine the 
issues posed by industries that are nei-
ther perfectly competitive nor purely 
monopolistic. In this chapter we focus 
on oligopoly, a type of market structure 
in which there are only a few producers. 
As we’ll see, oligopoly is a very impor-
tant reality—much more important, in 
fact, than monopoly and arguably more 
typical of modern economies than per-
fect competition.
Although much that we have 
learned about both perfect competition 
and monopoly is relevant to oligopoly, 
oligopoly also raises some entirely new 
issues. Among other things, firms in an 
oligopoly are often tempted to engage 
in the kind of behavior that got ADM, 
Ajinomoto, and other lysine producers 
into trouble with the law. Over the past 
few years, there have been numer-
ous investigations and some convic-
tions for price - fixing in a variety of 
industries, from insurance to elevators 
to computer chips. For example, in 
2010, the European Union, which has 
laws similar to those in the United 
States, fined 10 airlines $1.11 billion 
(yes, that’s billion) for price-fixing of air 
cargo prices.
We will begin by examining what 
oligopoly is and why it is so important. 
Then we’ll turn to the behavior of oli-
gopolistic industries. Finally, we’ll look 
at antitrust policy, which is primarily 
concerned with trying to keep oligopo-
lies “well behaved.”

The Prevalence of Oligopoly
A
t the time of that elaborately bugged meeting, no one company controlled 
the world lysine industry, but there were only a few major producers. An 
industry with only a few sellers is known as an oligopoly; a firm in such 
an industry is known as an oligopolist.
Oligopolists obviously compete with one another for sales. But neither ADM 
nor Ajinomoto were like a firm in a perfectly competitive industry, which takes 
the price at which it can sell its product as given. Each of these firms knew that 
its decision about how much to produce would affect the market price. That is, 
like monopolists, each of the firms had some market power. So the competition 
in this industry wasn’t “perfect.”
Economists refer to a situation in which firms compete but also possess 
market power—which enables them to affect market prices—as imperfect 
competition. As we saw in Chapter 13, there are actually two important forms 
of imperfect competition: oligopoly and monopolistic competition. Of these, oli-
gopoly is probably the more important in practice.
Although lysine is a multibillion - dollar business, it is not exactly a prod-
uct familiar to most consumers. However, many familiar goods and services 
are supplied by only a few competing sellers, which means the industries in 
question are oligopolies. For example, most air routes are served by only two 
or three airlines: in recent years, regularly scheduled shuttle service between 
New York and either Boston or Washington, D.C., has been provided only by 
Delta and US Airways. Three firms—Chiquita, Dole, and Del Monte, which 
own huge banana plantations in Central America—control 65% of world 
banana exports. Most cola beverages are sold by Coca - Cola and Pepsi. This list 
could go on for many pages.
It’s important to realize that an oligopoly isn’t necessarily made up of large 
firms. What matters isn’t size per se; the question is how many competitors 
there are. When a small town has only two grocery stores, grocery service 
there is just as much an oligopoly as air shuttle service between New York 
and Washington.
Why are oligopolies so prevalent? Essentially, oligopoly is the result 
of the same factors that sometimes produce monopoly, but in somewhat 
weaker form. Probably the most important source of oligopoly is the exis-
tence of increasing returns to scale, which give bigger producers a cost 
advantage over smaller ones. When these effects are very strong, they lead 
to monopoly; when they are not that strong, they lead to an industry with 
a small number of firms. For example, larger grocery stores typically have 
lower costs than smaller ones. But the advantages of large scale taper off 
once grocery stores are reasonably large, which is why two or three stores 
often survive in small towns.
If oligopoly is so common, why has most of this book focused on compe-
tition in industries where the number of sellers is very large? And why did 
we study monopoly, which is relatively uncommon, first? The answer has 
two parts.
First, much of what we learn from the study of perfectly competitive mar-
kets—about costs, entry and exit, and efficiency—remains valid despite the fact 
that many industries are not perfectly competitive. Second, the analysis of oli-
gopoly turns out to present some puzzles for which there is no easy solution. It is 
almost always a good idea—in exams and in life in general—first to deal with the 
questions you can answer, then to puzzle over the harder ones. We have simply 
followed the same strategy, developing the relatively clear - cut theories of perfect 
competition and monopoly first, and only then turning to the puzzles presented 
by oligopoly.
An oligopoly is an industry with 
only a small number of producers. 
A producer in such an industry is 
known as an oligopolist.
When no one firm has a monopoly, 
but producers nonetheless realize 
that they can affect market prices, 
an industry is characterized by 
imperfect competition.

IS IT AN OLIGOPOLY OR NOT?
I
n practice, it is not always easy to determine an industry’s market structure just 
by looking at the number of sellers. Many oligopolistic industries contain a num-
ber of small “niche” producers, which don’t really compete with the major play-
ers. For example, the U.S. airline industry includes a number of regional airlines 
like New Mexico Airlines, which flies propeller planes between Albuquerque and 
Carlsbad, New Mexico; if you count these carriers, the U.S. airline industry con-
tains nearly a hundred sellers, which doesn’t sound like competition among a small 
group. But there are only a handful of national competitors like American and 
United, and on many routes, as we’ve seen, there are only two or three competitors.
To get a better picture of market structure, economists often use a measure 
called the Herfindahl – Hirschman Index, or HHI. The HHI for an industry is the 
square of each firm’s market share summed over the firms in the industry. (In 
Chapter 12 you learned that market share is the percentage of sales in the market 
accounted for by that firm.) For example, if an industry contains only three firms 
and their market shares are 60%, 25%, and 15%, then the HHI for the industry is:
HHI = 602 + 252 + 152 = 4,450
By squaring each market share, the HHI calculation produces numbers that 
are much larger when a larger share of an industry output is dominated by fewer 
firms. So it’s a better measure of just how concentrated the industry is. This is 
confirmed by the data in Table 14-1. Here, the indexes for industries dominated by 
a small number of firms, like the personal computer operating systems industry 
or the wide-body aircraft industry, are many times larger than the index for the 
retail grocery industry, which has numerous firms of approximately equal size.

The HHI is used by the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade 
Commission, which have the job of enforcing antitrust policy, a topic we’ll investi-
gate in more detail later in this chapter. Their mission is to try to ensure that there 
is adequate competition in an industry by prosecuting price - fixing, breaking up 
economically inefficient monopolies, and disallowing mergers between firms 
when it’s believed that the merger will reduce competition. According to Justice 
Department guidelines, an HHI below 1,500 indicates a strongly competitive 
market, between 1,500 and 2,500 indicates a somewhat competitive market, and 
over 2,500 indicates an oligopoly. In an industry with an HHI over 1,500, a merger 
that results in a significant increase in the HHI will receive special scrutiny and 
is likely to be disallowed.

However, as recent events have shown, defining an industry can be tricky. In 
2007, Whole Foods and Wild Oats, two purveyors of high - end organic foods, pro-
posed a merger. The Justice Department disallowed it, claiming it would substan-
tially reduce competition and defining the industry as consisting of only natural 
food groceries. However, this ruling was appealed to a federal court, which found 
the merger allowable since regular supermarkets now carried organic foods as 
well, arguing that they would provide sufficient competition after the merger. Yet, 
in 2011, the Justice Department disallowed the merger between cell-phone carriers 
AT&T and T-Mobile, in a case in which the relevant industry was much clearer.

Understanding Oligopoly
H
ow much will a firm produce? Up to this point, we have always answered: 
the quantity that maximizes its profit. Together with its cost curves, the 
assumption that a firm maximizes profit is enough to determine its output 
when it is a perfect competitor or a monopolist.
When it comes to oligopoly, however, we run into some difficulties. Indeed, 
economists often describe the behavior of oligopolistic firms as a “puzzle.”
A Duopoly Example
Let’s begin looking at the puzzle of oligopoly with the simplest version, an indus-
try in which there are only two producing firms—a duopoly—and each is known 
as a duopolist.
Going back to our opening story, imagine that ADM and Ajinomoto are the 
only two producers of lysine. To make things even simpler, suppose that once a 
company has incurred the fixed cost needed to produce lysine, the marginal cost 
of producing another pound is zero. So the companies are concerned only with 
the revenue they receive from sales.
Table 14-2 shows a hypothetical demand schedule for lysine and the total rev-
enue of the industry at each price–quantity combination.
If this were a perfectly competitive industry, each firm would have an 
incentive to produce more as long as the market price was above marginal 
cost. Since the marginal cost is assumed to be zero, this would mean that at 
equilibrium lysine would be provided free. Firms would produce until price 
equals zero, yielding a total output of 120 million pounds and zero revenue 
for both firms.
 Quick Review
• In addition to perfect competition 
and monopoly, oligopoly and monop-
olistic competition are also important 
types of market structure. They are 
forms of imperfect competition.
• Oligopoly is a common market 
structure, one in which there 
are only a few firms, called oli-
gopolists, in the industry. It arises 
from the same forces that lead to 
monopoly, except in weaker form.
• The Herfindahl-Hirschman index, 
the sum of the squares of the 
market shares of each firm in the 
industry, is a widely used measure 
of industry concentration.

However, surely the firms would not be that stupid. With only two firms in the 
industry, each would realize that by producing more, it drives down the market 
price. So each firm would, like a monopolist, realize that profits would be higher 
if it and its rival limited their production.
So how much will the two firms produce?
One possibility is that the two companies will engage in collusion—they 
will cooperate to raise their joint profits. The strongest form of collusion is 
a cartel, an arrangement between producers that determines how much each 
is allowed to produce. The world’s most famous cartel is the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, described in Economics in Action later 
in the chapter. As its name indicates, it’s actually an agreement among 
governments rather than firms. There’s a reason this most famous of car-
tels is an agreement among governments: cartels among firms are illegal in 
the United States and many other jurisdictions. But 
let’s ignore the law for a moment (which is, of course, 
what ADM and Ajinomoto did in real life—to their own 
detriment).
So suppose that ADM and Ajinomoto were to form a 
cartel and that this cartel decided to act as if it were a 
monopolist, maximizing total industry profits. It’s obvi-
ous from Table 14-2 that in order to maximize the com-
bined profits of the firms, this cartel should set total 
industry output at 60 million pounds of lysine, which 
would sell at a price of $6 per pound, leading to revenue 
of $360 million, the maximum possible. Then the only 
question would be how much of that 60 million pounds 
each firm gets to produce. A “fair” solution might be for 
each firm to produce 30 million pounds with revenues 
for each firm of $180 million.
But even if the two firms agreed on such a deal, they 
might have a problem: each of the firms would have an 
incentive to break its word and produce more than the 
agreed - upon quantity.
Collusion and Competition
Suppose that the presidents of ADM and Ajinomoto were to agree that each would 
produce 30 million pounds of lysine over the next year. Both would understand 
that this plan maximizes their combined profits. And both would have an incen-
tive to cheat.
To see why, consider what would happen if Ajinomoto honored its agree-
ment, producing only 30 million pounds, but ADM ignored its promise and 
produced 40 million pounds. This increase in total output would drive the 
price down from $6 to $5 per pound, the price at which 70 million pounds 
are demanded. The industry’s total revenue would fall from $360 million 
($6 × 60 million pounds) to $350 million ($5 × 70 million pounds). However, 
ADM’s revenue would rise, from $180 million to $200 million. Since we are 
assuming a marginal cost of zero, this would mean a $20 million increase 
in ADM’s profits.
But Ajinomoto’s president might make exactly the same calculation. And if 
both firms were to produce 40 million pounds of lysine, the price would drop to 
$4 per pound. So each firm’s profits would fall, from $180 million to $160 million.
Why do individual firms have an incentive to produce more than the quantity 
that maximizes their joint profits? Because neither firm has as strong an incen-
tive to limit its output as a true monopolist would.
Let’s go back for a minute to the theory of monopoly. We know that a profit -
maximizing monopolist sets marginal cost (which in this case is zero) equal to

Sellers engage in collusion when 
they cooperate to raise their joint 
profits. A cartel is an agreement 
among several producers to obey 
output restrictions in order to 
increase their joint profits.

marginal revenue. But what is marginal revenue? Recall that producing an addi-
tional unit of a good has two effects:
 1. A positive quantity effect: one more unit is sold, increasing total revenue by the 
price at which that unit is sold.
 2. A negative price effect: in order to sell one more unit, the monopolist must cut 
the market price on all units sold.
The negative price effect is the reason marginal revenue for a monopolist is 
less than the market price. In the case of oligopoly, when considering the effect 
of increasing production, a firm is concerned only with the price effect on its 
own units of output, not those of its fellow oligopolists. Both ADM and Ajinomoto 
suffer a negative price effect if ADM decides to produce extra lysine and so drives 
down the price. But ADM cares only about the negative price effect on the units 
it produces, not about the loss to Ajinomoto.
This tells us that an individual firm in an oligopolistic industry faces a smaller 
price effect from an additional unit of output than does a monopolist; therefore, 
the marginal revenue that such a firm calculates is higher. So it will seem to be 
profitable for any one company in an oligopoly to increase production, even if 
that increase reduces the profits of the industry as a whole. But if everyone thinks 
that way, the result is that everyone earns a lower profit!
Until now, we have been able to analyze producer behavior by asking what 
a producer should do to maximize profits. But even if ADM and Ajinomoto are 
both trying to maximize profits, what does this predict about their behavior? Will 
they engage in collusion, reaching and holding to an agreement that maximizes 
their combined profits? Or will they engage in noncooperative behavior, with 
each firm acting in its own self - interest, even though this has the effect of driving 
down everyone’s profits? Both strategies sound like profit maximization. Which 
will actually describe their behavior?
Now you see why oligopoly presents a puzzle: there are only a small number 
of players, making collusion a real possibility. If there were dozens or hundreds of 
firms, it would be safe to assume they would behave noncooperatively. Yet when 
there are only a handful of firms in an industry, it’s hard to determine whether 
collusion will actually materialize.
Since collusion is ultimately more profitable than noncooperative behavior, firms 
have an incentive to collude if they can. One way to do so is to formalize it—sign an 
agreement (maybe even make a legal contract) or establish some financial incentives 
for the companies to set their prices high. But in the United States and many other 
nations, you can’t do that—at least not legally. Companies cannot make a legal con-
tract to keep prices high: not only is the contract unenforceable, but writing it is a one 
- way ticket to jail. Neither can they sign an informal “gentlemen’s agreement,” which 
lacks the force of law but perhaps rests on threats of retaliation—that’s illegal, too. 
In fact, executives from rival companies rarely meet without lawyers present, 
who make sure that the conversation does not stray into inappropriate territory. Even 
hinting at how nice it would be if prices were higher can bring you an unwelcome 
interview with the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission. For exam-
ple, in 2003 the Justice Department launched a price - fixing case against Monsanto 
and other large producers of genetically modified seed. The Justice Department 
was alerted by a series of meetings held between Monsanto and Pioneer Hi - Bred 
International, two companies that account for 60% of the U.S. market in maize and 
soybean seed. The two companies, parties to a licensing agreement involving geneti-
cally modified seed, claimed that no illegal discussions of price - fixing occurred in 
those meetings. But the fact that the two firms discussed prices as part of the licens-
ing agreement was enough to ensure action by the Justice Department.
Sometimes, as we’ve seen, oligopolistic firms just ignore the rules. But more 
often they find ways to achieve collusion without a formal agreement, as we’ll 
discuss later in the chapter.
When firms ignore the effects of 
their actions on each others’ profits, 
they engage in noncooperative 
behavior.

BITTER CHOCOLATE?
M
illions of chocolate lovers around the world 
have been spending more and more to satisfy 
their cravings, and regulators in Germany, Canada, 
and the United States have become suspicious. They 
are investigating whether the seven leading chocolate 
companies—including Mars, Kraft Foods, Nestle, 
Hershey, and Cadbury—have been colluding to raise 
prices. The amount of money involved could well run 
into the billions of dollars. 
Many of the nation’s largest grocery stores and 
snack retailers are convinced that they have been the 
victims of collusion. They claim that the chocolate 
industry has responded to stagnant consumer sales by 
price-fixing, an allegation the chocolate makers have 
vigorously denied.
In 2010, one of those stores, Supervalu, filed a law-
suit against Mars, Hershey, Nestle, and Cadbury, who 
together control about 76% of the U.S. chocolate market. Supervalu claimed that 
the confectioners had been fixing prices since 2002, regularly increasing prices 
by mid-single to double-digit amounts. Supervalu also claimed that grocers who 
resisted or refused to raise prices were systematically penalized with delayed or 
insufficient product deliveries.
What’s clear is that chocolate candy prices have been soaring, climbing by 17% 
from 2008 to 2010, while sales fell by about 7%. Chocolate makers defend their actions, 
contending that they were simply passing on increases in their costs. However, critics 
claim that the price of cocoa beans, the main ingredient in chocolate, was stable from 
2003 to 2007 and that sugar prices were similarly stable during that time, except for 
a brief spike in 2005, a time period in which chocolate prices were rising.
But, as antitrust experts point out, price collusion is often very difficult to prove 
because it is not illegal for businesses to increase their prices at the same time. To 
prove collusion, there must be some evidence of conversations or written agreements.
Such evidence has emerged in our chocolate case. According to the Canadian 
press, 13 Cadbury executives voluntarily provided information to the courts about 
contacts between the companies, including a 2005 episode in which a Nestle 
executive handed over a brown envelope containing details about a forthcoming 
price hike to a Cadbury employee. And, according to affidavits submitted to a 
Canadian court, top executives at Hershey, Mars, and Nestle met secretly in coffee 
shops, in restaurants, and at conventions to set prices.
Critics of the chocolate makers may soon get some sweet vindication.

 Quick Review
• Some of the key issues in oligopoly 
can be understood by looking at 
the simplest case, a duopoly—an 
industry containing only two firms, 
called duopolists.
• By acting as if they were a single 
monopolist, oligopolists can 
maximize their combined profits. So 
there is an incentive to form a cartel.
• However, each firm has an incentive to 
cheat—to produce more than it is sup-
posed to under the cartel agreement. 
So there are two principal outcomes: 
successful collusion or behaving non-
cooperatively by cheating.

Games Oligopolists Play
I
n our duopoly example and in real life, each oligopolistic firm realizes both 
that its profit depends on what its competitor does and that its competitor’s 
profit depends on what it does. That is, the two firms are in a situation of 
interdependence, where each firm’s decision significantly affects the profit of 
the other firm (or firms, in the case of more than two).
In effect, the two firms are playing a “game” in which the profit of each player 
depends not only on its own actions but on those of the other player (or players). 
In order to understand more fully how oligopolists behave, economists, along 
with mathematicians, developed the area of study of such games, known as game 
theory. It has many applications, not just to economics but also to military strat-
egy, politics, and other social sciences.
Let’s see how game theory helps us understand oligopoly.
The Prisoners’ Dilemma
Game theory deals with any situation in which the reward to any one player—the 
payoff—depends not only on his or her own actions but also on those of other 
players in the game. In the case of oligopolistic firms, the payoff is simply the 
firm’s profit.
When there are only two players, as in a duopoly, the interdependence 
between the players can be represented with a payoff matrix like that shown in 
Figure 14-1. Each row corresponds to an action by one player (in this case, ADM); 
each column corresponds to an action by the other (in this case, Ajinomoto). For 
simplicity, let’s assume that ADM can pick only one of two alternatives: produce 
30 million pounds of lysine or produce 40 million pounds. Ajinomoto has the 
same pair of choices.
The matrix contains four boxes, each divided by a diagonal line. Each box 
shows the payoff to the two firms that results from a pair of choices; the number 
When a firm’s decision significantly 
affects the profits of other firms 
in the industry, the firms are in a 
situation of interdependence.
The study of behavior in situations 
of interdependence is known as 
game theory.
The reward received by a player in a 
game, such as the profit earned by 
an oligopolist, is that player’s payoff.
A payoff matrix shows how the 
payoff to each of the participants 
in a two - player game depends on 
the actions of both. Such a matrix 
helps us analyze situations of 
interdependence.
A Payoff Matrix
14-1
Two firms, ADM and Ajinomoto, must decide how 
much lysine to produce. The profits of the two firms 
are interdependent: each firm’s profit depends not 
only on its own decision but also on the other’s deci-
sion. Each row represents an action by ADM, each 
column, one by Ajinomoto. Both firms will be better off 
if they both choose the lower output, but it is in each 
firm’s individual interest to choose the higher output.

below the diagonal shows ADM’s profits, the number above the diagonal shows 
Ajinomoto’s profits.
These payoffs show what we concluded from our earlier analysis: the combined 
profit of the two firms is maximized if they each produce 30 million pounds. Either 
firm can, however, increase its own profits by producing 40 million pounds while 
the other produces only 30 million pounds. But if both produce the larger quantity, 
both will have lower profits than if they had both held their output down.
The particular situation shown here is a version of a famous—and seemingly para-
doxical—case of interdependence that appears in many contexts. Known as the pris-
oners’ dilemma, it is a type of game in which the payoff matrix implies the following:
 • Each player has an incentive, regardless of what the other player does, to 
cheat—to take an action that benefits it at the other’s expense.
 • When both players cheat, both are worse off than they would have been if 
neither had cheated.
The original illustration of the prisoners’ dilemma occurred in a fictional 
story about two accomplices in crime—let’s call them Thelma and Louise—who 
have been caught by the police. The police have enough evidence to put them 
behind bars for 5 years. They also know that the pair have committed a more 
serious crime, one that carries a 20-year sentence; unfortunately, they don’t have 
enough evidence to convict the women on that charge. To do so, they would need 
each of the prisoners to implicate the other in the second crime.
So the police put the miscreants in separate cells and say the following to 
each: “Here’s the deal: if neither of you confesses, you know that we’ll send you to 
jail for 5 years. If you confess and implicate your partner, and she doesn’t do the 
same, we’ll reduce your sentence from 5 years to 2. But if your partner confesses 
and you don’t, you’ll get the maximum 20 years. And if both of you confess, we’ll 
give you both 15 years.”
Figure 14-2 shows the payoffs that face the prisoners, depending on the deci-
sion of each to remain silent or to confess. (Usually the payoff matrix reflects the 
players’ payoffs, and higher payoffs are better than lower payoffs. This case is

Each of two prisoners, held in separate cells, is offered

and implicates her accomplice but her accomplice does 
not do the same, a heavy sentence if she does not con-

interest of both prisoners not to confess; it is in each 
one’s individual interest to confess.

Prisoners’ dilemma is a game 
based on two premises: (1) Each 
player has an incentive to choose 
an action that benefits itself at the 
other player’s expense (2) When 
both players act in this way, both 
are worse off than if they had acted 
cooperatively.

an exception: a higher number of years in prison is bad, not good!) Let’s assume 
that the prisoners have no way to communicate and that they have not sworn an 
oath not to harm each other or anything of that sort. So each acts in her own 
self- interest. What will they do?
The answer is clear: both will confess. Look at it first from Thelma’s point 
of view: she is better off confessing, regardless of what Louise does. If Louise 
doesn’t confess, Thelma’s confession reduces her own sentence from 5 years to 
2. If Louise does confess, Thelma’s confession reduces her sentence from 20 to 
15 years. Either way, it’s clearly in Thelma’s interest to confess. And because she 
faces the same incentives, it’s clearly in Louise’s interest to confess, too. To con-
fess in this situation is a type of action that economists call a dominant strategy.
An action is a dominant strategy when it is the player’s best action regardless 
of the action taken by the other player.
It’s important to note that not all games have a dominant strategy—it depends 
on the structure of payoffs in the game. But in the case of Thelma and Louise, it 
is clearly in the interest of the police to structure the payoffs so that confessing is 
a dominant strategy for each person. So as long as the two prisoners have no way 
to make an enforceable agreement that neither will confess (something they can’t 
do if they can’t communicate, and the police certainly won’t allow them to do so 
because the police want to compel each one to confess), Thelma and Louise will 
each act in a way that hurts the other.
So if each prisoner acts rationally in her own interest, both will confess. Yet if 
neither of them had confessed, both would have received a much lighter sentence! 
In a prisoners’ dilemma, each player has a clear incentive to act in a way that hurts 
the other player—but when both make that choice, it leaves both of them worse off.
When Thelma and Louise both confess, they reach an equilibrium of the game. 
We have used the concept of equilibrium many times in this book; it is an outcome 
in which no individual or firm has any incentive to change his or her action. In game 
theory, this kind of equilibrium, in which each player takes the action that is best 
for her given the actions taken by other players, and vice versa, is known as a Nash 
equilibrium, after the mathematician and Nobel laureate John Nash. (Nash’s life 
was chronicled in the best - selling biography A Beautiful Mind, which was made into a 
movie.) Because the players in a Nash equilibrium do not take into account the effect 
of their actions on others, this is also known as a noncooperative equilibrium.
Now look back at Figure 14-1: ADM and Ajinomoto are in the same situation as 
Thelma and Louise. Each firm is better off producing the higher output, regardless 
of what the other firm does. Yet if both produce 40 million pounds, both are worse 
off than if they had followed their agreement and produced only 30 million pounds. 
In both cases, then, the pursuit of individual self - interest—the effort to maximize 
profits or to minimize jail time—has the perverse effect of hurting both players.
Prisoners’ dilemmas appear in many situations. The upcoming For Inquiring 
Minds describes an example from the days of the Cold War. Clearly, the players 
in any prisoners’ dilemma would be better off if they had some way of enforcing 
cooperative behavior—if Thelma and Louise had both sworn to a code of silence 
or if ADM and Ajinomoto had signed an enforceable agreement not to produce 
more than 30 million pounds of lysine.
But in the United States an agreement setting the output levels of two oli-
gopolists isn’t just unenforceable, it’s illegal. So it seems that a noncooperative 
equilibrium is the only possible outcome. Or is it?
Overcoming the Prisoners’ Dilemma: Repeated 
Interaction and Tacit Collusion
Thelma and Louise in their cells are playing what is known as a one - shot game—
that is, they play the game with each other only once. They get to choose once and 
for all whether to confess or hang tough, and that’s it. However, most of the games 
PITFALLS
PLAYING FAIR IN THE 
PRISONERS’ DILEMMA
One common reaction to the pris-
oners’ dilemma is to assert that it 
isn’t really rational for either pris-
oner to confess. Thelma wouldn’t 
confess because she’d be afraid 
Louise would beat her up, or 
Thelma would feel guilty because 
Louise wouldn’t do that to her.
But this kind of answer is, well, 
cheating—it amounts to changing 
the payoffs in the payoff matrix. 
To understand the dilemma, you 
have to play fair and imagine 
prisoners who care only about the 
length of their sentences.
Luckily, when it comes to 
oligopoly, it’s a lot easier to 
believe that the firms care only 
about their profits. There is no 
indication that anyone at ADM 
felt either fear of or affection for 
Ajinomoto, or vice versa; it was 
strictly about business.
An action is a dominant strategy 
when it is a player’s best action 
regardless of the action taken by the 
other player.
A Nash equilibrium, also known 
as a noncooperative equilibrium, 
results when each player in a game 
chooses the action that maximizes 
his or her payoff given the actions 
of other players, ignoring the effects 
of his or her action on the payoffs 
received by those other players.

that oligopolists play aren’t one - shot; instead, they expect to play the game repeat-
edly with the same rivals. An oligopolist usually expects to be in business for 
many years, and it knows that its decision today about whether to cheat is likely 
to affect the way other firms treat it in the future. So a smart oligopolist doesn’t 
just decide what to do based on the effect on profit in the short run. Instead, 
it engages in strategic behavior, taking account of the effects of the action it 
chooses today on the future actions of other players in the game. And under some 
conditions oligopolists that behave strategically can manage to behave as if they 
had a formal agreement to collude.
Suppose that ADM and Ajinomoto expect to be in the lysine business for 
many years and therefore expect to play the game of cheat versus collude shown 
in Figure 14-1 many times. Would they really betray each other time and again?
Probably not. Suppose that ADM considers two strategies. In one strategy it 
always cheats, producing 40 million pounds of lysine each year, regardless of what 
Ajinomoto does. In the other strategy, it starts with good behavior, producing 
only 30 million pounds in the first year, and watches to see what its rival does. If 
Ajinomoto also keeps its production down, ADM will stay cooperative, producing 
30 million pounds again for the next year. But if Ajinomoto produces 40 million 
pounds, ADM will take the gloves off and also produce 40 million pounds the next 
year. This latter strategy—start by behaving cooperatively, but thereafter do what-
ever the other player did in the previous period—is generally known as tit for tat.
Tit for tat is a form of strategic behavior, which we have just defined as behav-
ior intended to influence the future actions of other players. Tit for tat offers a 
reward to the other player for cooperative behavior—if you behave cooperatively, 
so will I. It also provides a punishment for cheating—if you cheat, don’t expect 
me to be nice in the future.
The payoff to ADM of each of these strategies would depend on which strategy 
Ajinomoto chooses. Consider the four possibilities, shown in Figure 14-3:
 1. If ADM plays tit for tat and so does Ajinomoto, both firms will make a profit 
of $180 million each year.
How Repeated Interaction Can Support Collusion

A strategy of tit for tat involves playing cooperatively at 
first, then following the other player’s move. This rewards 
good behavior and punishes bad behavior. If the other 
player cheats, playing tit for tat will lead to only a short-
term loss in comparison to playing always cheat. But if 
the other player plays tit for tat, also playing tit for tat 
leads to a long-term gain. So a firm that expects other 
firms to play tit for tat may well choose to do the same,
leading to successful tacit collusion.

2. If ADM plays always cheat but Ajinomoto plays tit for tat, ADM makes a profit 
of $200 million the first year but only $160 million per year thereafter.
3. If ADM plays tit for tat but Ajinomoto plays always cheat, ADM makes a profit 
of only $150 million in the first year but $160 million per year thereafter.
4. If ADM plays always cheat and Ajinomoto does the same, both firms will make 
a profit of $160 million each year.
Which strategy is better? In the first year, ADM does better playing always 
cheat, whatever its rival’s strategy: it assures itself that it will get either $200 million 
or $160 million (which of the two payoffs it actually receives depends on whether 
Ajinomoto plays tit for tat or always cheat). This is better than what it would get in 
the first year if it played tit for tat: either $180 million or $150 million. But by the 
second year, a strategy of always cheat gains ADM only $160 million per year for 
the second and all subsequent years, regardless of Ajinomoto’s actions.
Over time, the total amount gained by ADM by playing always cheat is less 
than the amount it would gain by playing tit for tat: for the second and all subse-
quent years, it would never get any less than $160 million and would get as much 
as $180 million if Ajinomoto played tit for tat as well. Which strategy, always cheat 
or tit for tat, is more profitable depends on two things: how many years ADM 
expects to play the game and what strategy its rival follows.
If ADM expects the lysine business to end in the near future, it is in effect 
playing a one - shot game. So it might as well cheat and grab what it can. Even if 
ADM expects to remain in the lysine business for many years (therefore to find 
itself repeatedly playing this game with Ajinomoto) and, for some reason, expects 
Ajinomoto always to cheat, it should also always cheat. That is, ADM should fol-
low the old rule “Do unto others before they do unto you.”
Between World War II and the late 
1980s, the United States and the 
Soviet Union were locked in a seem-
ingly endless struggle that never broke 
out into open war. During this Cold 
War, both countries spent huge sums 
on arms, sums that were a significant 
drain on the U.S. economy and eventu-
ally proved a crippling burden for the 
Soviet Union, whose underlying eco-
nomic base was much weaker. Yet nei-
ther country was ever able to achieve a 
decisive military advantage.
As many people pointed out, both 
nations would have been better off if 
they had both spent less on arms. Yet 
the arms race continued for 40 years.
Why? As political scientists were 
quick to notice, one way to explain the 
arms race was to suppose that the two 
countries were locked in a classic pris-
oners’ dilemma. Each government would 
have liked to achieve decisive military 
superiority, and each feared military infe-
riority. But both would have preferred a 
stalemate with low military spending to 
one with high spending. However, each 
government rationally chose to engage in 
high spending. If its rival did not spend 
heavily, its own high spending would lead 
to military superiority; not spending heav-
ily would lead to inferiority if the other 
government continued its arms buildup. 
So the countries were trapped.
The answer to this trap could have 
been an agreement not to spend as 
much; indeed, the two sides tried 
repeatedly to negotiate limits on some 
kinds of weapons. But these agree-
ments weren’t very effective. In the end 
the issue was resolved as heavy military 
spending hastened the collapse of the 
Soviet Union in 1991.
Unfortunately, the logic of an arms 
race has not disappeared. A nuclear 
arms race has developed between 
Pakistan and India, neighboring 
countries with a history of mutual 
antagonism. In 1998 the two countries 
confirmed the unrelenting logic of the 
prisoners’ dilemma: both publicly tested 
their nuclear weapons in a tit - for - tat 
sequence, each seeking to prove to the 
other that it could inflict just as much 
damage as its rival.

But if ADM expects to be in the business for a long time and thinks Ajinomoto 
is likely to play tit for tat, it will make more profits over the long run by playing 
tit for tat, too. It could have made some extra short - term profits by cheating at 
the beginning, but this would provoke Ajinomoto into cheating, too, and would, 
in the end, mean lower profits.
The lesson of this story is that when oligopolists expect to compete with one 
another over an extended period of time, each individual firm will often conclude 
that it is in its own best interest to be helpful to the other firms in the industry. So 
it will restrict its output in a way that raises the profits of the other firms, expect-
ing them to return the favor. Despite the fact that firms have no way of making an 
enforceable agreement to limit output and raise prices (and are in legal jeopardy if 
they even discuss prices), they manage to act “as if” they had such an agreement. 
When this happens, we say that firms engage in tacit collusion.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE RISE AND FALL AND RISE OF OPEC
C
all it the cartel that does not need to meet in secret. The 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, usu-
ally referred to as OPEC, includes 12 national governments 
(Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela), 
and it controls 40% of the world’s oil exports and 80% of its 
proven reserves. Two other oil - exporting countries, Norway 
and Mexico, are not formally part of the cartel but act as if 
they were. (Russia, also an important oil exporter, has not yet 
become part of the club.) Unlike corporations, which are often 
legally prohibited by governments from reaching agreements 
about production and prices, national governments can talk 
about whatever they feel like. OPEC members routinely meet 
to try to set targets for production.
These nations are not particularly friendly with one anoth-
er. Indeed, OPEC members Iraq and Iran fought a spectacular-
ly bloody war with each other in the 1980s. And, in 1990, Iraq 
invaded another member, Kuwait. (A mainly American force based in yet another 
OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait.)
Yet the members of OPEC, like one another or not, are effectively players in a 
game with repeated interactions. In any given year it is in their combined inter-
est to keep output low and prices high. But it is 
also in the interest of any one producer to cheat 
and produce more than the agreed - upon quota—
unless that producer believes that his actions will 
bring future retaliation.
So how successful is the cartel? Well, it’s had 
its ups and downs. Analysts have estimated that of 
12 announced quota reductions, OPEC was able to 
successfully defend its price floor 80% of the time.
Figure 14-4 shows the price of oil in constant 
dollars (that is, the value of a barrel of oil in terms of 
other goods) since 1949. OPEC first demonstrated 
its muscle in 1974: in the aftermath of a war in the 
Middle East, several OPEC producers limited their 
output—and they liked the results so much that 
they decided to continue the practice. Following a 
second wave of turmoil in the aftermath of Iran’s 
1979 revolution, prices shot still higher.
When firms limit production and 
raise prices in a way that raises one 
anothers’ profits, even though they 
have not made any formal agreement, 
they are engaged in tacit collusion.
It is in OPEC’s interest to keep oil prices high and output low.

By the mid - 1980s, however, there was a growing glut of oil on world markets, 
and cheating by cash - short OPEC members became widespread. The result, in 
1985, was that producers who had tried to play by the rules—especially Saudi 
Arabia, the largest producer—got fed up, and collusion collapsed.
The cartel began to act effectively again at the end of the 1990s, thanks largely 
to the efforts of Mexico’s oil minister to orchestrate output reductions. The car-
tel’s actions helped raise the price of oil from less than $10 a barrel in 1998 to a 
range of $20 to $30 a barrel in 2003.
Since 2008, OPEC has experienced the steepest roller-coaster ride of oil 
prices in its history. By 2008, prices had soared to over $145 a barrel. But at 
the end of 2008, one year into the Great Recession of 2007–2009, the price 
dropped sharply to $32 a barrel. In response, producers committed to reduce 
their output by about 5% of global output, with Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest 
exporter, leading with cuts of 20% of its output. By early 2009, prices had begun 
to rebound. Most recently, OPEC has struggled to contain its success. In 2011 
political turmoil in several Middle Eastern countries caused prices to skyrocket 
again. With other producers unwilling or unable to increase their production, 
in June 2011 Saudi Arabia increased its output in order to prevent shortages in 
the global oil market.

Oligopoly in Practice
I
n an Economics in Action earlier in the chapter, we described how the seven 
leading chocolate companies were allegedly colluding to raise prices for many 
years. Collusion is not, fortunately, the norm. But how do oligopolies usually 
work in practice? The answer depends both on the legal framework that limits 
what firms can do and on the underlying ability of firms in a given industry to 
cooperate without formal agreements.
• Economists use game theory to 
study firms’ behavior when there is 
interdependence between their pay-
offs. The game can be represented 
with a payoff matrix. Depending on 
the payoffs, a player may or may not 
have a dominant strategy.
• When each firm has an incentive to 
cheat, but both are worse off if both 
cheat, the situation is known as a 
prisoners’ dilemma.
• Players who don’t take their inter-
dependence into account arrive at a 
Nash, or noncooperative, equilib-
rium. But if a game is played repeat-
edly, players may engage in strategic 
behavior, sacrificing short - run profit 
to influence future behavior.
• In repeated prisoners’ dilemma 
games, tit for tat is often a good 
strategy, leading to successful tacit 
collusion.
 Quick Review

C H A P T E R  1 4    O L I G O P O LY    421
The Legal Framework
To understand oligopoly pricing in practice, we must be familiar with the legal 
constraints under which oligopolistic firms operate. In the United States, oli-
gopoly first became an issue during the second half of the nineteenth century, 
when the growth of railroads—themselves an oligopolistic industry—created a 
national market for many goods. Large firms producing oil, steel, and many other 
products soon emerged. The industrialists quickly realized that profits would be 
higher if they could limit price competition. So many industries formed cartels—
that is, they signed formal agreements to limit production and raise prices. Until 
1890, when the first federal legislation against such cartels was passed, this was 
perfectly legal.
However, although these cartels were legal, they weren’t legally enforceable—
members of a cartel couldn’t ask the courts to force a firm that was violating its 
agreement to reduce its production. And firms often did violate their agreements, 
for the reason already suggested by our duopoly example: there is always a temp-
tation for each firm in a cartel to produce more than it is supposed to.
In 1881 clever lawyers at John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company came 
up with a solution—the so - called trust. In a trust, shareholders of all the major 
companies in an industry placed their shares in the hands of a board of trustees 
who controlled the companies. This, in effect, merged the companies into a single 
firm that could then engage in monopoly pricing. In this way, the Standard Oil 
Trust established what was essentially a monopoly of the oil industry, and it was 
soon followed by trusts in sugar, whiskey, lead, cottonseed oil, and linseed oil.
Eventually there was a public backlash, driven partly by concern about the 
economic effects of the trust movement, partly by fear that the owners of the 
trusts were simply becoming too powerful. The result was the Sherman Antitrust 
Act of 1890, which was intended both to prevent the creation of more monopolies 
and to break up existing ones. At first this law went largely unenforced. But over 
the decades that followed, the federal government became increasingly commit-
ted to making it difficult for oligopolistic industries either to become monopolies 
or to behave like them. Such efforts are known to this day as antitrust policy.
One of the most striking early actions of antitrust policy was the breakup of 
Standard Oil in 1911. (Its components formed the nuclei of many of today’s large 
oil companies—Standard Oil of New Jersey became Exxon, Standard Oil 
of New York became Mobil, and so on.) In the 1980s a long - running case 
led to the breakup of Bell Telephone, which once had a monopoly of both 
local and long - distance phone service in the United States. As we men-
tioned earlier, the Justice Department reviews proposed mergers between 
companies in the same industry and will bar mergers that it believes will 
reduce competition. 
Among advanced countries, the United States is unique in its long tra-
dition of anti trust policy. Until recently, other advanced countries did not 
have policies against price- fixing, and some had even supported the cre-
ation of cartels, believing that it would help their own firms against foreign 
rivals. But the situation has changed radically over the past 25 years, as the 
European Union (EU)—a supra national body tasked with enforcing anti-
trust policy for its member countries—has converged toward U.S. practices. 
Today, EU and U.S. regulators often target the same firms because price - 
fixing has “gone global” as international trade has expanded.
During the early 1990s, the United States instituted an amnesty program 
in which a price - fixer receives a much-reduced penalty if it informs on its co - 
conspirators. In addition, Congress substantially increased maximum fines levied 
upon conviction. These two new policies clearly made informing on your cartel 
partners a dominant strategy, and it has paid off: in recent years, executives from 
Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, South 
Korea, and Switzerland, as well as from the United States, have been convicted

in U.S. courts of cartel crimes. As one lawyer commented, “you get a race to the 
courthouse” as each conspirator seeks to be the first to come clean.
Life has gotten much tougher over the past few years if you want to operate a 
cartel. So what’s an oligopolist to do?
Tacit Collusion and Price Wars
If a real industry were as simple as our lysine example, it probably wouldn’t 
be necessary for the company presidents to meet or do anything that could 
land them in jail. Both firms would realize that it was in their mutual interest 
to restrict output to 30 million pounds each and that any short - term gains to 
either firm from producing more would be much less than the later losses as the 
other firm retaliated. So even without any explicit agreement, the firms would 
probably achieve the tacit collusion needed to maximize their combined profits.
Real industries are nowhere near that simple. Nonetheless, in most oligopolis-
tic industries, most of the time, the sellers do appear to succeed in keeping prices 
above their noncooperative level. Tacit collusion, in other words, is the normal 
state of oligopoly.
Although tacit collusion is common, it rarely allows an industry to push prices all 
the way up to their monopoly level; collusion is usually far from perfect. As we discuss 
next, a variety of factors make it hard for an industry to coordinate on high prices.
In the European Union, a competition commission enforces 
competition and antitrust regulation for the 27 member nations. 
The commission has the authority to block mergers, force 
companies to sell subsidiaries, and impose heavy fines if it 
determines that companies have acted unfairly to inhibit com-
petition. Although companies are able to dispute charges at a 
hearing once a complaint has been issued, if the commission 
feels that its own case is convincing, it rules against the firm 
and levies a penalty. Companies that believe they have been 
unfairly treated have only limited recourse. Critics complain 
that the commission acts as prosecutor, judge, and jury.
In contrast, charges of unfair competi-
tion in the United States must be made in 
court, where lawyers for the Federal Trade 
Commission have to present their evidence 
to independent judges. Companies employ 
legions of highly trained and highly paid 
lawyers to counter the government’s case. 
For U.S. regulators, there is no guarantee of 
success. In fact, judges in many cases have 
found in favor of companies and against 
the regulators. Moreover, companies can 
appeal unfavorable decisions, so reaching a 
final verdict can take several years. 
Companies, not surprisingly, prefer the 
American system. The accompanying fig-
ure further clarifies why. In recent years, on 
average, fines for unfair competition have been higher in the 
European Union than in the United States.
Observers, however, criticize both systems for their inad-
equacies. In the slow-moving, litigious, and expensive American 
system, consumers and rival companies may wait a very long 
time to secure protection. And companies often prevail, raising 
questions about how well consumers are protected. But some 
charge that the EU system gives inadequate protection to com-
panies that are accused. This is a particular concern in high-tech 
industries, where network externalities are strong and rivals can 
use complaints of unfair competition to hobble their competitors.

Less Concentration In a less concentrated industry, the typical firm 
will have a smaller market share than in a more concentrated industry. This 
tilts firms toward noncooperative behavior because when a smaller firm 
cheats and increases its output, it gains for itself all of the profit from the 
higher output. And if its rivals should retaliate by increasing their output, 
the firm’s losses are limited because of its relatively modest market share. A 
less concentrated industry is often an indication that there are low barriers 
to entry.
Complex Products and Pricing Schemes In our lysine example the two 
firms produce only one product. In reality, however, oligopolists often sell thou-
sands or even tens of thousands of different products. Under these circumstances, 
keeping track of what other firms are producing and what prices they are charg-
ing is difficult. This makes it hard to determine whether a firm is cheating on the 
tacit agreement.
Differences in Interests In the lysine example, a tacit agreement for the firms 
to split the market equally is a natural outcome, probably acceptable to both 
firms. In real industries, however, firms often differ both in their perceptions 
about what is fair and in their real interests.
For example, suppose that Ajinomoto was a long - established lysine 
producer and ADM a more recent entrant to the industry. Ajinomoto might 
feel that it deserved to continue producing more than ADM, but ADM might 
feel that it was entitled to 50% of the business. (A disagreement along 
these lines was one of the contentious issues in those meetings the FBI 
was filming.)
Alternatively, suppose that ADM’s marginal costs were lower than Ajinomoto’s. 
Even if they could agree on market shares, they would then disagree about the 
profit-maximizing level of output.
Bargaining Power of Buyers Often oligopolists sell not to individual con-
sumers but to large buyers—other industrial enterprises, nationwide chains of 
stores, and so on. These large buyers are in a position to bargain for lower prices 
from the oligopolists: they can ask for a discount from an oligopolist and warn 
that they will go to a competitor if they don’t get it. An important reason large 
retailers like Walmart are able to offer lower prices to customers than small 
retailers is precisely their ability to use their size to extract lower prices from 
their suppliers.
These difficulties in enforcing tacit collusion have sometimes led com-
panies to defy the law and create illegal cartels. We’ve already examined 
the cases of the lysine industry and the chocolate industry. An older, classic 
example was the U.S. electrical equipment conspiracy of the 1950s, which led 
to the indictment of and jail sentences for some executives. The industry was 
one in which tacit collusion was especially difficult because of all the reasons 
just mentioned. There were many firms—40 companies were indicted. They 
produced a very complex array of products, often more or less custom - built 
for particular clients. They differed greatly in size, from giants like General 
Electric to family firms with only a few dozen employees. And the customers 
in many cases were large buyers like electrical utilities, which would normally 
try to force suppliers to compete for their business. Tacit collusion just didn’t 
seem practical—so executives met secretly and illegally to decide who would 
bid what price for which contract.
Because tacit collusion is often hard to achieve, most oligopolies charge 
prices that are well below what the same industry would charge if it were 
controlled by a monopolist—or what they would charge if they were able to 

424    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
collude explicitly. In addition, sometimes collusion breaks down and there is 
a price war. A price war sometimes involves simply a collapse of prices to 
their noncooperative level. Sometimes they even go below that level, as sell-
ers try to put each other out of business or at least punish what they regard 
as cheating.
Product Differentiation and Price Leadership
Lysine is lysine: there was no question in anyone’s mind that ADM and Ajinomoto 
were producing the same good and that consumers would make their decision 
about which company’s lysine to buy based on the price.
In many oligopolies, however, firms produce products that consumers regard 
as similar but not identical. A $10 difference in the price won’t make many cus-
tomers switch from a Ford to a Chrysler, or vice versa. Sometimes the differences 
between products are real, like differences between Froot Loops and Wheaties; 
sometimes, like differences between brands of vodka (which is supposed to be 
tasteless), they exist mainly in the minds of consumers. Either way, the effect is to 
reduce the intensity of competition among the firms: consumers will not all rush 
to buy whichever product is cheapest.
As you might imagine, oligopolists welcome the extra market power that 
comes when consumers think that their product is different from that of competi-
tors. So in many oligopolistic industries, firms make considerable efforts to cre-
ate the perception that their product is different—that is, they engage in product 
differentiation.
A firm that tries to differentiate its product may do so by altering what it 
actually produces, adding “extras,” or choosing a different design. It may also 
use advertising and marketing campaigns to create a differentiation in the 
minds of consumers, even though its product is more or less identical to the 
products of rivals.
A classic case of how products may be perceived as different even when they 
are really pretty much the same is over - the - counter medication. For many years 
there were only three widely sold pain relievers—aspirin, ibuprofen, and acet-
aminophen. Yet these generic pain relievers were marketed under a number of 
brand names, each brand using a marketing campaign implying some special 
superiority (one classic slogan was “contains the pain reliever doctors recom-
mend most”—that is, aspirin).
Whatever the nature of product differentiation, oligopolists producing dif-
ferentiated products often reach a tacit understanding not to compete on price. 
For example, during the years when the great majority of cars sold in the United 
States were produced by the Big Three auto companies (General Motors, Ford, 
and Chrysler), there was an unwritten rule that none of the three companies 
would try to gain market share by making its cars noticeably cheaper than those 
of the other two.
But then who would decide on the overall price of cars? The answer was nor-
mally General Motors: as the biggest of the three, it would announce its prices for 
the year first, and the other companies would match it. This pattern of behavior, 
in which one company tacitly sets prices for the industry as a whole, is known as 
price leadership.
Interestingly, firms that have a tacit agreement not to compete on price often 
engage in vigorous nonprice competition—adding new features to their prod-
ucts, spending large sums on ads that proclaim the inferiority of their rivals’ 
offerings, and so on.
Perhaps the best way to understand the mix of cooperation and compe-
tition in such industries is with a political analogy. During the long Cold 
War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the two countries 
engaged in intense rivalry for global influence. They not only provided 
A price war occurs when tacit 
collusion breaks down and prices 
collapse.
Product differentiation is an 
attempt by a firm to convince buyers 
that its product is different from 
the products of other firms in the 
industry.
In price leadership, one firm sets 
its price first, and other firms then 
follow.
Firms that have a tacit understanding 
not to compete on price often 
engage in intense nonprice 
competition, using advertising 
and other means to try to increase 
their sales.

financial and military aid to their allies; they sometimes supported forces 
trying to overthrow governments allied with their rival (as the Soviet Union 
did in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s, and as the United States did 
in Afghanistan from 1979 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991). 
They even sent their own soldiers to support allied governments against 
rebels (as the United States did in Vietnam and the Soviet Union did in 
Afghanistan). But they did not get into direct military confrontations with 
each other; open warfare between the two superpowers was regarded by both 
as too dangerous—and tacitly avoided.
Price wars aren’t as serious as shooting wars, but the principle is the same.
How Important Is Oligopoly?
We have seen that, across industries, oligopoly is far more common than either 
perfect competition or monopoly. When we try to analyze oligopoly, the econo-
mist’s usual way of thinking—asking how self - interested individuals would 
behave, then analyzing their interaction—does not work as well as we might 
hope because we do not know whether rival firms will engage in noncooperative 
behavior or manage to engage in some kind of collusion. Given the prevalence of 
oligopoly, then, is the analysis we developed in earlier chapters, which was based 
on perfect competition, still useful?
The conclusion of the great majority of economists is yes. For one thing, 
important parts of the economy are fairly well described by perfect competition. 
And even though many industries are oligopolistic, in many cases the limits 
to collusion keep prices relatively close to marginal costs—in other words, the 
industry behaves “almost” as if it were perfectly competitive.
It is also true that predictions from supply and demand analysis are often 
valid for oligopolies. For example, in Chapter 5 we saw that price controls will 
produce shortages. Strictly speaking, this conclusion is certain only for perfectly 
competitive industries. But in the 1970s, when the U.S. government imposed price 
controls on the definitely oligopolistic oil industry, the result was indeed to pro-
duce shortages and lines at the gas pumps.
So how important is it to take account of oligopoly? Most economists 
adopt a pragmatic approach. As we have seen in this chapter, the analysis of 
oligopoly is far more difficult and messy than that of perfect competition; 
so in situations where they do not expect the complications associated with 
oligopoly to be crucial, economists prefer to adopt the working assumption of 
perfectly competitive markets. They always keep in mind the possibility that 
oligopoly might be important; they recognize that there are important issues, 
from antitrust policies to price wars, where trying to understand oligopolistic 
behavior is crucial.
We will follow the same approach in the chapters that follow.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE PRICE WARS OF CHRISTMAS
D
uring the last several holiday seasons, the toy aisles of American retailers 
have been the scene of cut throat competition: During the 2011 Christmas 
shopping season, Target priced the latest Elmo doll at 89 cents less than Walmart 
(for those with a coupon), and $6 less than Toys “R” Us. So extreme is the price- 
cutting that since 2003 three toy retailers—KB Toys, FAO Schwartz, and Zany 
Brainy—have been forced into bankruptcy. Due to aggressive price- cutting by 
Walmart, the market share of Toys “R” Us has fallen from first to third.
What is happening? The turmoil can be traced back to trouble in the 
toy industry itself as well as to changes in toy retailing. Every year for 

426    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
several years, overall toy sales have fallen a few per-
centage points as children increasingly turn to video 
games and the Internet. There have also been new 
entrants into the toy business: Walmart and Target 
have expanded their number of stores and have been 
aggressive price - cutters. The result is much like a story 
of tacit collusion sustained by repeated interaction run 
in reverse: because the overall industry is in a state of 
decline and there are new entrants, the future payoff 
from collusion is shrinking. The predictable outcome 
is a price war.
Since retailers depend on holiday sales for nearly 
half of their annual sales, the holidays are a time of 
particularly intense price-cutting. Traditionally, the 
biggest shopping day of the year has been the day 
after Thanksgiving. But in an effort to expand sales 
and undercut rivals, retailers—particularly Walmart—have now begun 
their price - cutting earlier in the fall. Now it begins in early November, well 
before Thanksgiving. In fact, in 2010, Walmart slashed its toy prices in 
early November to within a few cents of Target’s prices. In response, Target 
placed about half of its 2,000 toys on sale, double the amount in the previ-
ous year. Toys “R” Us instead relied on a selection of exclusive toys to avoid 
direct price competition.
With other retailers feeling as if they have no choice but to follow this pat-
tern, we have the phenomenon known as “creeping Christmas”: the price wars of 
Christmas arrive earlier each year.
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
14-4
1. Which of the following factors are likely to support the conclusion that there is tacit col-
lusion in this industry? Which are not? Explain.
a.  For many years the price in the industry has changed infrequently, and all the 
firms in the industry charge the same price. The largest firm publishes a catalog 
containing a “suggested” retail price. Changes in price coincide with changes in 
the catalog.
b.  There has been considerable variation in the market shares of the firms in the industry 
over time.
c.  Firms in the industry build into their products unnecessary features that make it 
hard for consumers to switch from one company’s products to another company’s 
products.
d.  Firms meet yearly to discuss their annual sales forecasts.
e.  Firms tend to adjust their prices upward at the same times.
Solutions appear at back of book.
• Oligopolies operate under legal 
restrictions in the form of antitrust 
policy. But many succeed in achiev-
ing tacit collusion.
• Tacit collusion is limited by a 
number of factors, including large 
numbers of firms, complex products 
and pricing, differences in interests 
among firms, and bargaining power 
of buyers. When collusion breaks 
down, there is a price war.
• To limit competition, oligopolists 
often engage in product differen-
tiation. When products are differen-
tiated, it is sometimes possible for 
an industry to achieve tacit collu-
sion through price leadership.
• Oligopolists often avoid competing 
directly on price, engaging in non-
price competition through advertis-
ing and other means instead.
 Quick Review

The United Kingdom is home to two long-haul airline carriers (carriers that 
fly between continents): British Airways and its rival, Virgin Atlantic. Although 
British Airways is the dominant company, with a market share generally between 
50% and 100% on routes between London and various American cities, Virgin 
has been a tenacious competitor.  
The rivalry between the two has ranged from relatively peaceable to openly 
hostile over the years. In the 1990s, British Airways lost a court case alleging it 
had engaged in “dirty tricks” to drive Virgin out of business. In April 2010, how-
ever, British Airways may well have wondered if the tables had been turned.  
It all began in mid-July 2004, when oil prices were rising (long-haul airlines 
are especially vulnerable to oil price hikes). British prosecutors alleged that the 
two airlines had plotted to levy fuel surcharges on passengers. For the next two 
years, according to the prosecutors, the rivals had established a cartel through 
which they coordinated increases in surcharges. British Airways first introduced 
a £5 ($8.25) surcharge on long-haul flights when a barrel of oil traded at about 
$38. It increased the surcharge six times, so that by 2006, when oil was trading at 
about $69 a barrel, the surcharge was £70 ($115). At the same time, Virgin Atlantic 
also levied a £70 fee. These surcharges increased within days of each other. 
Eventually, three Virgin executives decided to blow the whistle in exchange 
for immunity from prosecution. British Airways immediately suspended its 
executives under suspicion and paid fines of nearly $500 million to U.S. and 
U.K. authorities. And in 2010 four British Airways executives were prosecuted by 
British authorities for their alleged role in the conspiracy.
The lawyers for the executives argued that although the two airlines had 
swapped information, this was not proof of a criminal conspiracy. In fact, they 
argued, Virgin was so fearful of American regulators that it had admitted to 
criminal behavior before confirming that it had indeed committed an offense. 
One of the defense lawyers, Clare Montgomery, argued that because U.S. laws 
against anti-competitive behavior are much tougher than those in the United 
Kingdom, companies may be compelled to blow the whistle to avoid investiga-
tion. “It’s a race,” she said. “If you don’t get to them and confess first, you can’t 
get immunity. The only way to protect yourself is to go to the authorities, even if 
you haven’t [done anything].” The result was that the Virgin executives were given 
immunity in both the United States and the United Kingdom, but the British 
Airways executives were subject to prosecution (and possible multiyear jail terms) 
in both countries.
In late 2011 the case came to a shocking end—shocking, that is, for Virgin 
Atlantic and U.K. authorities. Citing e-mails that Virgin had finally been forced 
by the court to turn over, the judge found insufficient evidence that there had ever 
been a conspiracy between the two airlines. The court was incensed enough to 
threaten to rescind the immunity granted to the three Virgin executives.  
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Explain why Virgin Atlantic and British Airlines might collude in response to increased oil 
prices. Was the market conducive to collusion or not? 
 2. How would you determine whether illegal behavior actually occurred? What might explain 
these events other than illegal behavior?  
 3. Explain the dilemma facing the two airlines as well as their individual executives.

SUMMARY
 1. Many industries are oligopolies: there are only a few 
sellers. In particular, a duopoly has only two sellers. 
Oligopolies exist for more or less the same reasons that 
monopolies exist, but in weaker form. They are charac-
terized by imperfect competition: firms compete but 
possess market power.
 2. Predicting the behavior of oligopolists poses some-
thing of a puzzle. The firms in an oligopoly could 
maximize their combined profits by acting as a car-
tel, setting output levels for each firm as if they were 
a single monopolist; to the extent that firms manage 
to do this, they engage in collusion. But each indi-
vidual firm has an incentive to produce more than 
it would in such an arrangement—to engage in non-
cooperative behavior.
 3. The situation of interdependence, in which each 
firm’s profit depends noticeably on what other firms 
do, is the subject of game theory. In the case of a 
game with two players, the payoff of each player 
depends both on its own actions and on the actions of 
the other; this interdependence can be represented as a 
payoff matrix. Depending on the structure of payoffs 
in the payoff matrix, a player may have a dominant 
strategy—an action that is always the best regardless 
of the other player’s actions.
 4. Duopolists face a particular type of game known 
as a prisoners’ dilemma; if each acts independently 
in its own interest, the resulting Nash equilibrium 
or noncooperative equilibrium will be bad for 
both. However, firms that expect to play a game 
repeatedly tend to engage in strategic behavior, 
trying to influence each other’s future actions. 
A particular strategy that seems to work well in 
maintaining tactic collusion is tit for tat.
 5. In order to limit the ability of oligopolists to collude 
and act like monopolists, most governments pur-
sue an antitrust policy designed to make collusion 
more difficult. In practice, however, tacit collusion 
is widespread.
 6. A variety of factors make tacit collusion difficult: 
large numbers of firms, complex products and 
pricing, differences in interests, and bargaining 
power of buyers. When tacit collusion breaks 
down, there is a price war. Oligopolists try to 
avoid price wars in various ways, such as through 
product differentiation and through price leader-
ship, in which one firm sets prices for the industry. 
Another is through nonprice competition, like 
advertising.

to produce 10 more tons, what would be the price 
effect for BASF? What would be the quantity effect?

vitamin D in total, 20 tons each. BASF cannot be 
punished for deviating from the agreement with 
Roche. If BASF, on its own, were to deviate from 
that agreement and produce 10 more tons, what 
would be the price effect for BASF? What would be 
the quantity effect for BASF? Would BASF have an

affect the price for olive oil and the profit earned by 
each family?

catch by 100 pounds per week. The U.S. fleet doesn’t 
change its catch. What is the revenue to the U.S. 
fleet? To the EU fleet?
d. In retaliation for the cheating by the EU fleet, the 
U.S. fleet also expands its catch by 100 pounds per 
week. What is the revenue to the U.S. fleet? To the 
EU fleet?
6. Suppose that the fisheries agreement in Problem 5 
breaks down, so that the fleets behave noncoopera-
tively. Assume that the United States and the EU each 
can send out either one or two fleets. The more fleets in 
the area, the more fish they catch in total but the lower 
the catch of each fleet. The accompanying matrix shows 
the profit (in dollars) per week earned by each side.

a. What is the noncooperative Nash equilibrium? Will 
each side choose to send out one or two fleets?
b. Suppose that the fish stocks are being depleted. 
Each region considers the future and comes to a tit-
for-tat agreement whereby each side will send only 
one fleet out as long as the other does the same. If 
either of them breaks the agreement and sends out 
a second fleet, the other will also send out two and 
will continue to do so until its competitor sends out 
only one fleet. If both play this tit-for-tat strategy, 
how much profit will each make every week?
7. Untied and Air “R” Us are the only two airlines oper-
ating flights between Collegeville and Bigtown. That 
is, they operate in a duopoly. Each airline can charge 
either a high price or a low price for a ticket. The 
accompanying matrix shows their payoffs, in profits 
per seat (in dollars), for any choice that the two airlines 
can make.

 a. Suppose the two airlines play a one-shot game—that 
is, they interact only once and never again. What 
will be the Nash (noncooperative) equilibrium in 
this one-shot game?
 b. Now suppose the two airlines play this game twice. 
And suppose each airline can play one of two strate-
gies: it can play either always charge the low price 
or tit for tat—that is, it starts off charging the high 
price in the first period, and then in the second 
period it does whatever the other airline did in the 
previous period. Write down the payoffs to Untied 
from the following four possibilities:
  i.  Untied plays always charge the low price when 
Air “R” Us also plays always charge the low price.
  ii.  Untied plays always charge the low price when 
Air “R” Us plays tit for tat.
 iii.  Untied plays tit for tat when Air “R” Us plays 
always charge the low price.
  iv.  Untied plays tit for tat when Air “R” Us also plays 
tit for tat.
 8. Suppose that Coke and Pepsi are the only two pro-
ducers of cola drinks, making them duopolists. Both 
companies have zero marginal cost and a fixed cost of 
$100,000.
 a. Assume first that consumers regard Coke and Pepsi 
as perfect substitutes. Currently both are sold for 
$0.20 per can, and at that price each company sells 4 
million cans per day.
  i. How large is Pepsi’s profit?
  ii.  If Pepsi were to raise its price to $0.30 per can, 
and Coke does not respond, what would happen 
to Pepsi’s profit?

C H A P T E R  1 4    O L I G O P O LY    431
b. Now suppose that each company advertises to dif-
ferentiate its product from the other company’s. As a 
result of advertising, Pepsi realizes that if it raises or 
lowers its price, it will sell less or more of its prod-
uct, as shown by the demand schedule in the accom-
panying table.

  If Pepsi now were to raise its price to $0.30 per can, 
what would happen to its profit?
c. Comparing your answer to part a(i) and to part b, 
what is the maximum amount Pepsi would be will-
ing to spend on advertising?
9. Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds spend huge sums of 
money each year to advertise their tobacco products in 
an attempt to steal customers from each other. Suppose 
each year Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds have to decide 
whether or not they want to spend money on advertising. 
If neither firm advertises, each will earn a profit of $2 
million. If they both advertise, each will earn a profit of 
$1.5 million. If one firm advertises and the other does 
not, the firm that advertises will earn a profit of $2.8 
million and the other firm will earn $1 million.
a. Use a payoff matrix to depict this problem.
b. Suppose Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds can write 
an enforceable contract about what they will do. 
What is the cooperative solution to this game?
c. What is the Nash equilibrium without an enforce-
able contract? Explain why this is the likely out-
come.
10. Over the last 40 years the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has had varied success 
in forming and maintaining its cartel agreements. 
Explain how the following factors may contribute to the 
difficulty of forming and/or maintaining its price and 
output agreements.
a. New oil fields are discovered and increased drilling 
is undertaken in the Gulf of Mexico and the North 
Sea by nonmembers of OPEC.
b. Crude oil is a product that is differentiated by sulfur 
content: it costs less to refine low-sulfur crude oil 
into gasoline. Different OPEC countries possess oil 
reserves of different sulfur content.
c. Cars powered by hydrogen are developed.
11. Suppose you are an economist working for the Antitrust 
Division of the Department of Justice. In each of the 
following cases you are given the task of determining 
whether the behavior warrants an antitrust investiga-
tion for possible illegal acts or is just an example of 
undesirable, but not illegal, tacit collusion. Explain 
your reasoning.
a. Two companies dominate the industry for industrial 
lasers. Several people sit on the boards of directors 
of both companies.
b. Three banks dominate the market for banking in a 
given state. Their profits have been going up recently 
as they add new fees for customer transactions. 
Advertising among the banks is fierce, and new 
branches are springing up in many locations.
c. The two oil companies that produce most of the 
petroleum for the western half of the United States 
have decided to forgo building their own pipelines 
and to share a common pipeline, the only means of 
transporting petroleum products to that market.
d. The two major companies that dominate the market 
for herbal supplements have each created a subsid-
iary that sells the same product as the parent com-
pany in large quantities but with a generic name.
e. The two largest credit card companies, Passport and 
OmniCard, have required all retailers who accept 
their cards to agree to limit their use of rival credit 
cards.

Monopolistic Competition and 
Product Differentiation
A
  BEST - SELLING BOOK TITLED
Fast Food Nation offered a fasci-
nating if rather negative report on the 
burgers, pizza, tacos, and fried chicken 
that make up so much of the modern 
American diet. According to the book, 
all fast - food chains produce and deliver 
their food in pretty much the same 
way. In particular, a lot of the taste of 
fast food—whatever kind of fast food it 
is—comes from food additives manufac-
tured in New Jersey.
But each fast - food provider goes to 
great lengths to convince you that it has 
something special to offer. As a sign of 
how well McDonald’s carefully culti-
vates its image, everyone recognizes the 
McDonald’s slogan—“I’m lovin’it!”—and 
knows what a Big Mac or a Quarter 
pounder is. Its rivals Burger King 
and Wendy’s emphasize their cooking 
techniques—Burger King with its “flame-
broiled patties” and Wendy’s with its “hot 
and juicy made-to-order old-fashioned 
hamburger”—to make consumers believe 
that their burgers are better tasting. A 
few years ago Wendy’s went so far as to 
mount an advertising claim with a little 
old lady yelling “Where’s the beef?” to 
highlight its somewhat bigger burgers 
(compared to those at McDonald’s).
So how would you describe the fast - 
food industry? On the one side, it clearly 
isn’t a monopoly. When you go to a fast- 
food court, you have a choice among 
vendors, and there is real competition 
between the different burger outlets 
and between the burgers and the fried 
chicken. On the other side, in a way 
each vendor does possess some aspects 
of a monopoly: at one point McDonald’s 
had the slogan “Nobody does it like 
McDonald’s.” That was literally true—
though McDonald’s competitors would 
claim that they did it better. In any case, 
the point is that each fast- food provider 
offers a product that is differentiated 
from its rivals’ products.
In the fast - food industry, many 
firms compete to satisfy more or less 
the same demand—the desire of con-
sumers for something tasty but quick. 
But each firm offers to satisfy that 
demand with a distinctive, differenti-
ated product—products that consum-
ers typically view as close but not 
perfect substitutes. When there are 
many firms offering competing, dif-
ferentiated products, as there are in 
the fast - food industry, economists say 
that the industry is characterized by 
monopolistic competition. This is the 
fourth and final market structure that 
we will discuss, after perfect competi-
tion, monopoly, and oligopoly.
We’ll start by defining monopo-
listic competition more carefully and 
explaining its characteristic features. 
Then we’ll explore how firms differenti-
ate their products; this will allow us to 
analyze how monopolistic competition 
works. The chapter concludes with a 
discussion of some ongoing controver-
sies about product differentiation—in 
particular, the question of why advertis-
ing is effective.

The Meaning of Monopolistic 
Competition
L
eo manages the Wonderful Wok stand in the food court of a big shopping 
mall. He offers the only Chinese food there, but there are more than a dozen 
alternatives, from Bodacious Burgers to Pizza Paradise. When deciding 
what to charge for a meal, Leo knows that he must take those alternatives into 
account: even people who normally prefer stir - fry won’t order a $15 lunch from 
Leo when they can get a burger, fries, and drink for $4.
But Leo also knows that he won’t lose all his business even if his lunches cost 
a bit more than the alternatives. Chinese food isn’t the same thing as burgers 
or pizza. Some people will really be in the mood for Chinese that day, and they 
will buy from Leo even if they could dine more cheaply on burgers. Of course, 
the reverse is also true: even if Chinese is a bit cheaper, some people will choose 
burgers instead. In other words, Leo does have some market power: he has some 
ability to set his own price.
So how would you describe Leo’s situation? He definitely isn’t a price - taker, 
so he isn’t in a situation of perfect competition. But you wouldn’t exactly call him 
a monopolist, either. Although he’s the only seller of Chinese food in that food 
court, he does face competition from other food vendors.
Yet it would also be wrong to call him an oligopolist. Oligopoly, remember, 
involves competition among a small number of interdependent firms in an indus-
try protected by some—albeit limited—barriers to entry and whose profits are 
highly interdependent. Because their profits are highly interdependent, oligopo-
lists have an incentive to collude, tacitly or explicitly. But in Leo’s case there are 
lots of vendors in the shopping mall, too many to make tacit collusion feasible.
Economists describe Leo’s situation as one of monopolistic competition. 
Monopolistic competition is particularly common in service industries like res-
taurants and gas stations, but it also exists in some manufacturing industries. It 
involves three conditions: large numbers of competing producers, differentiated 
products, and free entry into and exit from the industry in the long run. In a 
monopolistically competitive industry, each producer has some ability to set the 
price of her differentiated product. But exactly how high she can set it is limited 
by the competition she faces from other existing and potential producers that 
produce close, but not identical, products.
Large Numbers
In a monopolistically competitive industry, there are many producers. Such an 
industry does not look either like a monopoly, where the firm faces no competi-
tion, or an oligopoly, where each firm has only a few rivals. Instead, each seller 
has many competitors. For example, there are many vendors in a big food court, 
many gas stations along a major highway, and many hotels at a popular beach 
resort.
Differentiated Products
In a monopolistically competitive industry, each producer has a product that con-
sumers view as somewhat distinct from the products of competing firms; at the 
same time, though, consumers see these competing products as close substitutes. 
If Leo’s food court contained 15 vendors selling exactly the same kind and qual-
ity of food, there would be perfect competition: any seller who tried to charge a 
higher price would have no customers. But suppose that Wonderful Wok is the 
only Chinese food vendor, Bodacious Burgers is the only hamburger stand, and so 
on. The result of this differentiation is that each seller has some ability to set his 
own price: each producer has some—albeit limited—market power.
Monopolistic competition is 
a market structure in which there 
are many competing producers in 
an industry, each producer sells a 
differentiated product, and there 
is free entry into and exit from the 
industry in the long run.

Free Entry and Exit in the Long Run
In monopolistically competitive industries, new producers, with their own dis-
tinct products, can enter the industry freely in the long run. For example, other 
food vendors would open outlets in the food court if they thought it would be 
profitable to do so. In addition, firms will exit the industry if they find they are 
not covering their costs in the long run.
Monopolistic competition, then, differs from the three market structures we 
have examined so far. It’s not the same as perfect competition: firms have some 
power to set prices. It’s not pure monopoly: firms face some competition. And 
it’s not the same as oligopoly: because there are many firms and free entry, the 
potential for collusion so important in oligopoly no longer exists.
We’ll see in a moment how prices, output, and the number of products avail-
able are determined in monopolistically competitive industries. But first, let’s 
look a little more closely at what it means to have differentiated products.
Product Differentiation
W
e pointed out in Chapter 14 that product differentiation often plays an 
important role in oligopolistic industries. In such industries, product 
differentiation reduces the intensity of competition between firms 
when tacit collusion cannot be achieved. Product differentiation plays an even 
more crucial role in monopolistically competitive industries. Because tacit col-
lusion is virtually impossible when there are many producers, product differ-
entiation is the only way monopolistically competitive firms can acquire some 
market power.
How do firms in the same industry—such as fast - food vendors, gas stations, 
or chocolate makers—differentiate their products? Sometimes the difference is 
mainly in the minds of consumers rather than in the products themselves. We’ll 
discuss the role of advertising and the importance of brand names in achieving 
this kind of product differentiation later in the chapter. But, in general, firms dif-
ferentiate their products by—surprise!—actually making them different.
The key to product differentiation is that consumers have different pref-
erences and are willing to pay somewhat more to satisfy those preferences. 
Each producer can carve out a market niche by producing something that 
caters to the particular preferences of some group of consumers better than 
the products of other firms. There are three important forms of product dif-
ferentiation: differentiation by style or type, differentiation by location, and 
differentiation by quality.
Differentiation by Style or Type
The sellers in Leo’s food court offer different types of fast food: hamburgers, 
pizza, Chinese food, Mexican food, and so on. Each consumer arrives at the 
food court with some preference for one or another of these offerings. This 
preference may depend on the consumer’s mood, her diet, or what she has 
already eaten that day. These preferences will not make consumers indiffer-
ent to price: if Wonderful Wok were to charge $15 for an egg roll, everybody 
would go to Bodacious Burgers or Pizza Paradise instead. But some people 
will choose a more expensive meal if that type of food is closer to their prefer-
ence. So the products of the different vendors are substitutes, but they aren’t 
perfect substitutes—they are imperfect substitutes.
Vendors in a food court aren’t the only sellers that differentiate their offerings 
by type. Clothing stores concentrate on women’s or men’s clothes, on business 
attire or sportswear, on trendy or classic styles, and so on. Auto manufacturers 

436    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
offer sedans, minivans, sport - utility vehicles, and sports cars, each type aimed at 
drivers with different needs and tastes.
Books offer yet another example of differentiation by type and style. Mysteries 
are differentiated from romances; among mysteries, we can differentiate among 
hard - boiled detective stories, whodunits, and police procedurals. And no two 
writers of hard - boiled detective stories are exactly alike: Raymond Chandler and 
Sue Grafton each have their devoted fans.
In fact, product differentiation is characteristic of most consumer goods. As 
long as people differ in their tastes, producers find it possible and profitable to 
produce a range of varieties.
Differentiation by Location
Gas stations along a road offer differentiated products. True, the gas may be 
exactly the same. But the location of the stations is different, and location mat-
ters to consumers: it’s more convenient to stop for gas near your home, near your 
workplace, or near wherever you are when the gas gauge gets low.
In fact, many monopolistically competitive industries supply goods differen-
tiated by location. This is especially true in service industries, from dry cleaners 
to hairdressers, where customers often choose the seller who is closest rather 
than cheapest.
Differentiation by Quality
Do you have a craving for chocolate? How much are you willing to spend on 
it? You see, there’s chocolate and then there’s chocolate: although ordinary 
chocolate may not be very expensive, gourmet chocolate can cost several dol-
lars per bite.
With chocolate, as with many goods, there is a range of possible qualities. You 
can get a usable bicycle for less than $100; you can get a much fancier bicycle for 
10 times as much. It all depends on how much the additional quality matters to 
you and how much you will miss the other things you could have purchased with 
that money.
Because consumers vary in what they are willing to pay for higher qual-
ity, producers can differentiate their products by quality—some offering lower -
quality, inexpensive products and others offering higher - quality products at a 
higher price.
Product differentiation, then, can take several forms. Whatever form it takes, 
however, there are two important features of industries with differentiated prod-
ucts: competition among sellers and value in diversity.
Competition among sellers means that even though sellers of differentiated 
products are not offering identical goods, they are to some extent competing for 
a limited market. If more businesses enter the market, each will find that it sells 
less quantity at any given price. For example, if a new gas station opens along a 
road, each of the existing gas stations will sell a bit less.
Value in diversity refers to the gain to consumers from the proliferation of 
differentiated products. A food court with eight vendors makes consumers hap-
pier than one with only six vendors, even if the prices are the same, because some 
customers will get a meal that is closer to what they had in mind. A road on which 
there is a gas station every two miles is more convenient for motorists than a road 
where gas stations are five miles apart. When a product is available in many dif-
ferent qualities, fewer people are forced to pay for more quality than they need or 
to settle for lower quality than they want. There are, in other words, benefits to 
consumers from a greater diversity of available products.
As we’ll see next, competition among the sellers of differentiated products is 
the key to understanding how monopolistic competition works.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
ANY COLOR, SO LONG AS IT’S BLACK
T
he early history of the auto industry offers a classic illustra-
tion of the power of product differentiation.
The modern automobile industry was created by Henry 
Ford, who first introduced assembly - line production. This 
technique made it possible for him to offer the famous Model T 
at a far lower price than anyone else was charging for a car; by 
1920, Ford dominated the automobile business.
Ford’s strategy was to offer just one style of car, which 
maximized his economies of scale in production but made no 
concessions to differences in consumers’ tastes. He supposedly 
declared that customers could get the Model T in “any color, so 
long as it’s black.”
This strategy was challenged by Alfred P. Sloan, who 
had merged a number of smaller automobile companies into 
General Motors. Sloan’s strategy was to offer a range of car 
types, differentiated by quality and price. Chevrolets were 
basic cars that directly challenged the Model T, Buicks were bigger and more 
expensive, and so on up to Cadillacs. And you could get each model in several 
different colors.
By the 1930s the verdict was clear: customers preferred a range of styles, and 
General Motors, not Ford, became the dominant auto manufacturer for the rest 
of the twentieth century.

Understanding Monopolistic Competition
S
uppose an industry is monopolistically competitive: it consists of many pro-
ducers, all competing for the same consumers but offering differentiated 
products. How does such an industry behave?
As the term monopolistic competition suggests, this market structure com-
bines some features typical of monopoly with others typical of perfect com-
petition. Because each firm is offering a distinct product, it is in a way like a 
monopolist: it faces a downward - sloping demand curve and has some market 
power—the ability within limits to determine the price of its product. However, 
unlike a pure monopolist, a monopolistically competitive firm does face compe-
tition: the amount of its product it can sell depends on the prices and products 
offered by other firms in the industry.

 Quick Review
• In monopolistic competition there 
are many competing producers, each 
with a differentiated product, and 
free entry and exit in the long run.
• Product differentiation can occur in 
oligopolies that fail to achieve tacit 
collusion as well as in monopolistic 
competition. It takes three main 
forms: by style or type, by loca-
tion, or by quality. The products of 
competing sellers are considered 
imperfect substitutes.
• Producers compete for the same 
market, so entry by more producers 
reduces the quantity each existing 
producer sells at any given price. In 
addition, consumers gain from the 
increased diversity of products.

The same, of course, is true of an oligopoly. In a monopolistically com-
petitive industry, however, there are many producers, as opposed to the 
small number that defines an oligopoly. This means that the “puzzle” of 
oligopoly—will firms collude or will they behave noncooperatively?—does 
not arise in the case of monopolistically competitive industries. True, if all 
the gas stations or all the restaurants in a town could agree—explicitly or 
tacitly—to raise prices, it would be in their mutual interest to do so. But such 
collusion is virtually impossible when the number of firms is large and, by 
implication, there are no barriers to entry. So in situations of monopolistic 
competition, we can safely assume that firms behave noncooperatively and 
ignore the potential for collusion.
Monopolistic Competition in the Short Run
We introduced the distinction between short - run and long - run equilibrium back 
in Chapter 12. The short - run equilibrium of an industry takes the number of firms 
as given. The long - run equilibrium, by contrast, is reached only after enough time 
has elapsed for firms to enter or exit the industry. To analyze monopolistic com-
petition, we focus first on the short run and then on how an industry moves from 
the short run to the long run.
Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 15-1 show two possible situations that a typical 
firm in a monopolistically competitive industry might face in the short run. 
In each case, the firm looks like any monopolist: it faces a downward - sloping 
demand curve, which implies a downward - sloping marginal revenue curve.

The firm in panel (a) can be profitable for some output 
quantities: the quantities for which its average total cost 
curve, ATC, lies below its demand curve, DP. The profit- 
maximizing output quantity is QP, the output at which 
marginal revenue, MRP, is equal to marginal cost, MC. 
The firm charges price PP and earns a profit, represented 
by the area of the green-shaded rectangle. The firm in 
panel (b), however, can never be profitable because its 
average total cost curve lies above its demand curve, 
DU, for every output quantity. The best that it can do if 
it produces at all is to produce quantity QU and charge 
price PU. This generates a loss, indicated by the area of 
the yellow-shaded rectangle. Any other output quantity 
results in a greater loss.

We assume that every firm has an upward - sloping marginal cost curve but 
that it also faces some fixed costs, so that its average total cost curve is U-shaped. 
This assumption doesn’t matter in the short run, but, as we’ll see shortly, it is 
crucial to understanding the long - run equilibrium.
In each case the firm, in order to maximize profit, sets marginal revenue 
equal to marginal cost. So how do these two figures differ? In panel (a) the firm 
is profitable; in panel (b) it is unprofitable. (Recall that we are referring always to 
economic profit, not accounting profit—that is, a profit given that all factors of 
production are earning their opportunity costs.)
In panel (a) the firm faces the demand curve DP and the marginal revenue 
curve MRP. It produces the profit - maximizing output QP, the quantity at which 
marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, and sells it at the price PP. This price 
is above the average total cost at this output, ATCP. The firm’s profit is indicated 
by the area of the shaded rectangle.
In panel (b) the firm faces the demand curve DU and the marginal revenue 
curve MRU. It chooses the quantity QU at which marginal revenue is equal to mar-
ginal cost. However, in this case the price PU is below the average total cost ATCU; 
so at this quantity the firm loses money. Its loss is equal to the area of the shaded 
rectangle. Since QU is the profit - maximizing quantity—which means, in this case, 
the loss - minimizing quantity—there is no way for a firm in this situation to make 
a profit. We can confirm this by noting that at any quantity of output, the average 
total cost curve in panel (b) lies above the demand curve DU. Because ATC > P at 
all quantities of output, this firm always suffers a loss.
As this comparison suggests, the key to whether a firm with market power 
is profitable or unprofitable in the short run lies in the relationship between its 
demand curve and its average total cost curve. In panel (a) the demand curve DP 
crosses the average total cost curve, meaning that some of the demand curve lies 
above the average total cost curve. So there are some price–quantity combina-
tions available at which price is higher than average total cost, indicating that the 
firm can choose a quantity at which it makes positive profit.
In panel (b), by contrast, the demand curve DU does not cross the average total 
cost curve—it always lies below it. So the price corresponding to each quantity 
demanded is always less than the average total cost of producing that quantity. 
There is no quantity at which the firm can avoid losing money.
These figures, showing firms facing downward - sloping demand curves and 
their associated marginal revenue curves, look just like ordinary monopoly 
analysis. The “competition” aspect of monopolistic competition comes into play, 
however, when we move from the short run to the long run.
Monopolistic Competition in the Long Run
Obviously, an industry in which existing firms are losing money, like the one in 
panel (b) of Figure 15-1, is not in long - run equilibrium. When existing firms are 
losing money, some firms will exit the industry. The industry will not be in long- 
run equilibrium until the persistent losses have been eliminated by the exit of 
some firms.
It may be less obvious that an industry in which existing firms are earning 
profits, like the one in panel (a) of Figure 15-1, is also not in long - run equilibrium. 
Given that there is free entry into the industry, persistent profits earned by the 
existing firms will lead to the entry of additional producers. The industry will 
not be in long - run equilibrium until the persistent profits have been eliminated 
by the entry of new producers.
How will entry or exit by other firms affect the profits of a typical existing 
firm? Because the differentiated products offered by firms in a monopolistically 
competitive industry compete for the same set of customers, entry or exit by other 
firms will affect the demand curve facing every existing producer. If new gas 
stations open along a highway, each of the existing gas stations will no longer be 

440    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
able to sell as much gas as before at any given price. So, as illustrated in panel 
(a) of Figure 15-2, entry of additional producers into a monopolistically competi-
tive industry will lead to a leftward shift of the demand curve and the marginal 
revenue curve facing a typical existing producer.
Conversely, suppose that some of the gas stations along the highway close. 
Then each of the remaining stations will be able to sell more gasoline at any given 
price. So, as illustrated in panel (b), exit of firms from an industry will lead to a 
rightward shift of the demand curve and marginal revenue curve facing a typical 
remaining producer.
The industry will be in long - run equilibrium when there is neither entry nor exit. 
This will occur only when every firm earns zero profit. So in the long run, a monopo-
listically competitive industry will end up in zero - profit equilibrium, in which 
firms just manage to cover their costs at their profit - maximizing output quantities.
We have seen that a firm facing a downward - sloping demand curve will earn 
positive profits if any part of that demand curve lies above its average total cost 
curve; it will incur a loss if its demand curve lies everywhere below its average 
total cost curve. So in zero - profit equilibrium, the firm must be in a borderline 
position between these two cases; its demand curve must just touch its aver-
age total cost curve. That is, it must be just tangent to it at the firm’s profit - 
maximizing output quantity—the output quantity at which marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost.
If this is not the case, the firm operating at its profit - maximizing quantity 
will find itself making either a profit or loss, as illustrated in the panels of Figure 
15-1. But we also know that free entry and exit means that this cannot be a long- 
run equilibrium. Why? In the case of a profit, new firms will enter the industry, 
shifting the demand curve of every existing firm leftward until all profits are 
extinguished. In the case of a loss, some existing firms will exit and so shift the

Entry will occur in the long run when existing firms are 
profitable. In panel (a), entry causes each existing firm’s 
demand curve and marginal revenue curve to shift to the 
left. The firm receives a lower price for every unit it sells, 
and its profit falls. Entry will cease when firms make zero 
profit. Exit will occur in the long run when existing firms 
are unprofitable. In panel (b), exit from the industry shifts 
each remaining firm’s demand curve and marginal rev-
enue curve to the right. The firm receives a higher price 
for every unit it sells, and profit rises. Exit will cease when 
the remaining firms make zero profit.
In the long run, a monopolistically 
competitive industry ends up in 
zero-profit equilibrium: each 
firm makes zero profit at its profit - 
maximizing quantity.

demand curve of every remaining firm to the right until all losses are extin-
guished. All entry and exit ceases only when every existing firm makes zero profit 
at its profit - maximizing quantity of output.
Figure 15-3 shows a typical monopolistically competitive firm in such a zero - 
profit equilibrium. The firm produces QMC, the output at which MRMC = MC, and 
charges price PMC. At this price and quantity, represented by point Z, the demand 
curve is just tangent to its average total cost curve. The firm earns zero profit 
because price, PMC, is equal to average total cost, ATCMC.
The normal long - run condition of a monopolistically competitive industry, 
then, is that each producer is in the situation shown in Figure 15-3. Each pro-
ducer acts like a monopolist, facing a downward-sloping demand curve and set-
ting marginal cost equal to marginal revenue so as to maximize profits. But this 
is just enough to achieve zero economic profit. The producers in the industry are 
like monopolists without monopoly profits.
On the face of it, the movie business 
seems to meet the criteria for monopolis-
tic competition. Movies compete for the 
same consumers; each movie is different 
from the others; new companies can and 
do enter the business. But where’s the 
zero - profit equilibrium? After all, some 
movies are enormously profitable.
The key is to realize that for every suc-
cessful blockbuster, there are several 
flops—and that the movie studios don’t 
know in advance which will be which. 
(One observer of Hollywood summed 
up his conclusions as follows: “Nobody 
knows anything.”) And by the time it 
becomes clear that a movie will be a 
flop, it’s too late to cancel it.
The difference between movie - making 
and the type of monopolistic competition 
we model in this chapter is that the fixed 
costs of making a movie are also sunk 
costs—once they’ve been incurred, they 
can’t be recovered.
Yet there is still, in a way, a zero - profit 
equilibrium. If movies on average were 
highly profitable, more studios would 
enter the industry and more movies would 
be made. If movies on average lost money, 
fewer movies would be made. In fact, as 
you might expect, the movie industry on 
average earns just about enough to cover 
the cost of production—that is, it earns 
roughly zero economic profit.
This kind of situation—in which firms 
earn zero profit on average but have 
a mixture of highly profitable hits and 
money - losing flops—can be found in 
other industries characterized by high 
up - front sunk costs. A notable example 
is the pharmaceutical industry, where 
many research projects lead nowhere 
but a few lead to highly profitable drugs.

The Long-Run Zero-Profit Equilibrium
15-3
If existing firms are profitable, entry will occur and shift 
each existing firm’s demand curve leftward. If existing 
firms are unprofitable, each remaining firm’s demand 
curve shifts rightward as some firms exit the indus-
try. Entry and exit will cease when every existing firm 
makes zero profit at its profit-maximizing quantity. So, 
in long-run zero-profit equilibrium, the demand curve of 
each firm is tangent to its average total cost curve at its 
profit-maximizing quantity: at the profit-maximizing quan-
tity, QMC, price, PMC, equals average total cost, ATCMC. 
A monopolistically competitive firm is like a monopolist 
without monopoly profits.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE HOUSING BUST AND THE DEMISE 
OF THE 6% COMMISSION
T
he vast majority of home sales in the United States are transacted with the 
use of real estate agents. A home owner looking to sell hires an agent, who lists 
the house for sale and shows it to interested buyers. Correspondingly, prospec-
tive home buyers hire their own agent to arrange inspections of available houses. 
Traditionally, agents were paid by the seller: a commission equal to 6% of the 
sales price of the house, which the seller’s agent and the buyer’s agent would split 
equally. If a house sold for $300,000, for example, the seller’s agent and the buyer’s 
agent each received $9,000 (equal to 3% of $300,000). 
The real estate brokerage industry fits the model of monopolistic competition 
quite well: in any given local market, there are many real estate agents, all competing 
with one another, but the agents are differentiated by location and personality as well 
as by the type of home they sell (some focus on condominiums, others on very expen-
sive homes, and so on). And the industry has free entry: it’s relatively easy for someone 
to become a real estate agent (take a course and then pass a test to obtain a license). 
But for a long time there was one feature that didn’t fit the model of monopo-
listic competition: the fixed 6% commission that had not changed over time and 
was unaffected by the ups and downs of the housing market. For example, in 
southern California, where house prices tripled over a period of 15 years, agents 
received three times as much compensation as they had 15 years earlier even 
though the work was no harder. 
You may wonder how agents were able to maintain the 6% commission. Why 
didn’t new agents enter the market and drive the commission down to the zero-
profit level? One tactic used by agents was their control of the Multiple Listing 
Service, or MLS, which lists nearly all the homes for sale in a community. 
Traditionally, only sellers who agreed to the 6% commission were allowed to list 
their homes on the MLS.
But protecting the 6% commission was always an iffy endeavor because any 
action by the brokerage industry to fix the commission rate at a given percentage 
would run afoul of antitrust laws. And by the early to mid-2000s, as the housing 
boom intensified, discount brokers had appeared on the scene. But traditional 
agents refused to work with them. So in 2005, the Justice Department sued the 
National Association of Realtors, the powerful trade group of agents.
Oversight by regulators and the housing market bust which began in 2006 are 
hastening the demise of the non-negotiable 6% commission. With sellers forced 
to accept less for their houses than often anticipated, pressure has built for agents 
to accept less as well. By 2009, the average commission had fallen to 5.36%, and 
agents are now offering to list properties on broker databases for as little as a few 
hundred dollars. As Steve Murray, the editor of a trade publication, said in 2011, 
“The standard 6 percent went out the window a long time ago.”

average total cost curves, is in long - run equilibrium. Describe how the industry adjusts, 
in both the short and long run, in each of the following situations.
a.  A technological change that increases fixed cost for every firm in the industry
b.  A technological change that decreases marginal cost for every firm in the industry
2. Why, in the long run, is it impossible for firms in a monopolistically competitive industry 
to create a monopoly by joining together to form a single firm?
Solutions appear at back of book.
• Like a monopolist, each firm in 
a monopolistically competitive 
industry faces a downward - sloping 
demand curve and marginal rev-
enue curve. In the short run, it may 
earn a profit or incur a loss at its 
profit - maximizing quantity.
• If the typical firm earns positive 
profit, new firms will enter the 
industry in the long run, shifting 
each existing firm’s demand curve 
to the left. If the typical firm incurs 
a loss, some existing firms will exit 
the industry in the long run, shifting 
the demand curve of each remain-
ing firm to the right.
• The long - run equilibrium of a 
monopolistically competitive indus-
try is a zero - profit equilibrium in 
which firms just break even. The 
typical firm’s demand curve is tan-
gent to its average total cost curve 
at its profit - maximizing quantity.

Monopolistic Competition versus 
Perfect Competition
I
n a way, long - run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive industry looks 
a lot like long - run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive industry. In both 
cases, there are many firms; in both cases, profits have been competed away; 
in both cases, the price received by every firm is equal to the average total cost 
of production.
However, the two versions of long - run equilibrium are different—in ways that 
are economically significant.
Price, Marginal Cost, and Average Total Cost
Figure 15-4 compares the long - run equilibrium of a typical firm in a perfectly 
competitive industry with that of a typical firm in a monopolistically competitive 
industry. Panel (a) shows a perfectly competitive firm facing a market price equal 
to its minimum average total cost; panel (b) reproduces Figure 15-3. Comparing 
the panels, we see two important differences.
First, in the case of the perfectly competitive firm shown in panel (a), the 
price, PPC, received by the firm at the profit - maximizing quantity, QPC, is equal

Minimum-cost output
Panel (a) shows the situation of the typical firm 
in long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive 
industry. The firm operates at the minimum-cost 
output QPC, sells at the competitive market price 
PPC, and makes zero profit. It is indifferent to sell-
ing another unit of output because PPC is equal 
to its marginal cost, MCPC. Panel (b) shows the 
situation of the typical firm in long-run equilibrium 
in a monopolistically competitive industry. At QMC 
it makes zero profit because its price, PMC, just 
equals average total cost, ATCMC. At QMC the firm 
would like to sell another unit at price PMC since 
PMC exceeds marginal cost, MCMC. But it is unwill-
ing to lower price to make more sales. It therefore 
operates to the left of the minimum-cost output 
level and has excess capacity.

to the firm’s marginal cost of production, MCPC, at that quantity of output. By 
contrast, at the profit - maximizing quantity chosen by the monopolistically com-
petitive firm in panel (b), QMC, the price, PMC, is higher than the marginal cost of 
production, MCMC.
This difference translates into a difference in the attitude of firms toward 
consumers. A wheat farmer, who can sell as much wheat as he likes at the going 
market price, would not get particularly excited if you offered to buy some more 
wheat at the market price. Since he has no desire to produce more at that price 
and can sell the wheat to someone else, you are not doing him a favor.
But if you decide to fill up your tank at Jamil’s gas station rather than at 
Katy’s, you are doing Jamil a favor. He is not willing to cut his price to get more 
customers—he’s already made the best of that trade - off. But if he gets a few more 
customers than he expected at the posted price, that’s good news: an additional 
sale at the posted price increases his revenue more than it increases his costs 
because the posted price exceeds marginal cost.
The fact that monopolistic competitors, unlike perfect competitors, want to 
sell more at the going price is crucial to understanding why they engage in activi-
ties like advertising that help increase sales.
The other difference between monopolistic competition and perfect com-
petition that is visible in Figure 15-4 involves the position of each firm on 
its average total cost curve. In panel (a), the perfectly competitive firm pro-
duces at point QPC, at the bottom of the U-shaped ATC curve. That is, each 
firm produces the quantity at which average total cost is minimized—the 
minimum - cost output. As a consequence, the total cost of industry output is 
also minimized.
Under monopolistic competition, in panel (b), the firm produces at QMC, on 
the downward - sloping part of the U-shaped ATC curve: it produces less than the 
quantity that would minimize average total cost. This failure to produce enough 
to minimize average total cost is sometimes described as the excess capacity 
issue. The typical vendor in a food court or gas station along a road is not big 
enough to take maximum advantage of available cost savings. So the total cost 
of industry output is not minimized in the case of a monopolistically competi-
tive industry.
Some people have argued that, because every monopolistic competitor has 
excess capacity, monopolistically competitive industries are inefficient. But the 
issue of efficiency under monopolistic competition turns out to be a subtle one 
that does not have a clear answer.
Is Monopolistic Competition Inefficient?
A monopolistic competitor, like a monopolist, charges a price that is above 
marginal cost. As a result, some people who are willing to pay at least as much 
for an egg roll at Wonderful Wok as it costs to produce it are deterred from 
doing so. In monopolistic competition, some mutually beneficial transactions 
go unexploited.
Furthermore, it is often argued that monopolistic competition is subject to a 
further kind of inefficiency: that the excess capacity of every monopolistic com-
petitor implies wasteful duplication because monopolistically competitive indus-
tries offer too many varieties. According to this argument, it would be better if 
there were only two or three vendors in the food court, not six or seven. If there 
were fewer vendors, they would each have lower average total costs and so could 
offer food more cheaply.
Is this argument against monopolistic competition right—that it lowers 
total surplus by causing inefficiency? Not necessarily. It’s true that if there 
were fewer gas stations along a highway, each gas station would sell more 
gasoline and so would have lower costs per gallon. But there is a drawback: 
Firms in a monopolistically 
competitive industry have excess 
capacity: they produce less than 
the output at which average total 
cost is minimized.

motorists would be inconvenienced because gas stations would be farther 
apart. The point is that the diversity of products offered in a monopolistically 
competitive industry is beneficial to consumers. So the higher price consum-
ers pay because of excess capacity is offset to some extent by the value they 
receive from greater diversity.
There is, in other words, a trade - off: more producers means higher aver-
age total costs but also greater product diversity. Does a monopolistically 
competitive industry arrive at the socially optimal point on this trade - off? 
Probably not—but it is hard to say whether there are too many firms or 
too few! Most economists now believe that duplication of effort and excess 
capacity in monopolistically competitive industries are not important issues 
in practice.

Controversies About Product 
Differentiation
U
p to this point, we have assumed that products are differentiated in a way 
that corresponds to some real desire of consumers. There is real conve-
nience in having a gas station in your neighborhood; Chinese food and 
Mexican food are really different from each other.
In the real world, however, some instances of product differentiation can seem 
puzzling if you think about them. What is the real difference between Crest and 
Colgate toothpaste? Between Energizer and Duracell batteries? Or a Marriott and 
a Hilton hotel room? Most people would be hard - pressed to answer any of these 
questions. Yet the producers of these goods make considerable efforts to convince 
consumers that their products are different from and better than those of their 
competitors.
No discussion of product differentiation is complete without spending at 
least a bit of time on the two related issues—and puzzles—of advertising and 
brand names.
The Role of Advertising
Wheat farmers don’t advertise their wares on TV, but car dealers do. That’s 
not because farmers are shy and car dealers are outgoing; it’s because adver-
tising is worthwhile only in industries in which firms have at least some 
market power.
The purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy more of a 
seller’s product at the going price. A perfectly competitive firm, which can sell 
as much as it likes at the going market price, has no incentive to spend money 
 Quick Review
• In the long - run equilibrium of a 
monopolistically competitive indus-
try, there are many firms, each earn-
ing zero profit.
• Price exceeds marginal cost, so 
some mutually beneficial trades are 
unexploited.
• Monopolistically competitive firms 
have excess capacity because they 
do not minimize average total cost. 
But it is not clear that this is actually 
a source of inefficiency since con-
sumers gain from product diversity.

446    P A R T  7    M A R K E T  S T R U C T U R E :  B E YO N D P E R F EC T  C O M P E T I T I O N
convincing consumers to buy more. Only a firm 
that has some market power, and that therefore 
charges a price above marginal cost, can gain 
from advertising. (Industries that are more or 
less perfectly competitive, like the milk industry, 
do advertise—but these ads are sponsored by an 
association on behalf of the industry as a whole, 
not on behalf of the milk that comes from the 
cows on a particular farm.)
Given that advertising “works,” it’s not hard 
to see why firms with market power would spend 
money on it. But the big question about advertis-
ing is why it works. A related question is whether 
advertising is, from society’s point of view, a 
waste of resources.
Not all advertising poses a puzzle. Much 
of it is straightforward: it’s a way for sellers 
to inform potential buyers about what they 
have to offer (or, occasionally, for buyers to 
inform potential sellers about what they want). Nor is there much contro-
versy about the economic usefulness of ads that provide information: the 
real estate ad that declares “sunny, charming, 2 br, 1 ba, a/c” tells you things 
you need to know (even if a few euphemisms are involved—“charming,” of 
course, means “small”).
But what information is being conveyed when a TV actress proclaims the 
virtues of one or another toothpaste or a sports hero declares that some com-
pany’s batteries are better than those inside that pink mechanical rabbit? Surely 
nobody believes that the sports star is an expert on batteries—or that he chose 
the company that he personally believes makes the best batteries, as opposed to 
the company that offered to pay him the most. Yet companies believe, with good 
reason, that money spent on such promotions increases their sales—and that 
they would be in big trouble if they stopped advertising but their competitors 
continued to do so.
Why are consumers influenced by ads that do not really provide any infor-
mation about the product? One answer is that consumers are not as rational as 
economists typically assume. Perhaps consumers’ judgments, or even their tastes, 
can be influenced by things that economists think ought to be irrelevant, such as 
which company has hired the most charismatic celebrity to endorse its product. 
And there is surely some truth to this. As we learned in Chapter 9, consumer ratio-
nality is a useful working assumption; it is not an absolute truth.
However, another answer is that consumer response to advertising is not 
entirely irrational because ads can serve as indirect “signals” in a world 
where consumers don’t have good information about products. Suppose, to 
take a common example, that you need to avail yourself of some local service 
that you don’t use regularly—body work on your car, say, or furniture mov-
ing. You turn to the Yellow Pages or visit YellowPages.com, where you see 
a number of small listings and several large display, or featured, ads. You 
know that those display ads are large because the firms paid extra for them; 
still, it may be quite rational to call one of the firms with a big display ad. 
After all, the big ad probably means that it’s a relatively large, successful 
company—otherwise, the company wouldn’t have found it worth spending 
the money for the larger ad.
The same principle may partly explain why ads feature celebrities. You don’t 
really believe that the supermodel prefers that watch; but the fact that the watch 
manufacturer is willing and able to pay her fee tells you that it is a major com-
pany that is likely to stand behind its product. According to this reasoning, an

expensive advertisement serves to establish the quality of a firm’s products in the 
eyes of consumers.
The possibility that it is rational for consumers to respond to advertising also 
has some bearing on the question of whether advertising is a waste of resources. 
If ads only work by manipulating the weak - minded, the $149 billion U.S. busi-
nesses spent on advertising in 2007 would have been an economic waste—except 
to the extent that ads sometimes provide entertainment. To the extent that adver-
tising conveys important information, however, it is an economically productive 
activity after all.
Brand Names
You’ve been driving all day, and you decide that it’s time to find a place to sleep. 
On your right, you see a sign for the Bates Motel; on your left, you see a sign 
for a Motel 6, or a Best Western, or some other national chain. Which one do 
you choose?
Unless they were familiar with the area, most people would head for the 
chain. In fact, most motels in the United States are members of major chains; 
the same is true of most fast - food restaurants and many, if not most, stores in 
shopping malls.
Motel chains and fast - food restaurants are only one aspect of a broader phe-
nomenon: the role of brand names, names owned by particular companies that 
differentiate their products in the minds of consumers. In many cases, a com-
pany’s brand name is the most important asset it possesses: clearly, McDonald’s 
is worth far more than the sum of the deep - fat fryers and hamburger grills the 
company owns.
In fact, companies often go to considerable lengths to defend their brand 
names, suing anyone else who uses them without permission. You may talk about 
blowing your nose on a kleenex or xeroxing a document, but unless the product 
in question comes from Kleenex or Xerox, legally the seller must describe it as a 
facial tissue or a photocopier.
As with advertising, with which they are closely linked, the social usefulness 
of brand names is a source of dispute. Does the preference of consumers for 
known brands reflect consumer irrationality? Or do brand names convey real 
information? That is, do brand names create unnecessary market power, or do 
they serve a real purpose?
As in the case of advertising, the answer is probably some of both. On one 
side, brand names often do create unjustified market power. Many consumers 
will pay more for brand - name goods in the supermarket even though consumer 
experts assure us that the cheaper store brands are equally good. Similarly, many 
common medicines, like aspirin, are cheaper—with no loss of quality—in their 
generic form.
On the other side, for many products the brand name does convey infor-
mation. A traveler arriving in a strange town can be sure of what awaits in a 
Holiday Inn or a McDonald’s; a tired and hungry traveler may find this pref-
erable to trying an independent hotel or restaurant that might be better—but 
might be worse.
In addition, brand names offer some assurance that the seller is engaged 
in repeated interaction with its customers and so has a reputation to protect. 
If a traveler eats a bad meal at a restaurant in a tourist trap and vows never 
to eat there again, the restaurant owner may not care, since the chance is 
small that the traveler will be in the same area again in the future. But if that 
traveler eats a bad meal at McDonald’s and vows never to eat at a McDonald’s 
again, that matters to the company. This gives McDonald’s an incentive to 
provide consistent quality, thereby assuring travelers that quality controls are 
in place.
A brand name is a name owned by 
a particular firm that distinguishes its 
products from those of other firms.

    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
ABSOLUT IRRATIONALITY
A
dvertising often serves a useful function. Among other things, it can 
make consumers aware of a wider range of alternatives, which leads to 
increased competition and lower prices. Indeed, in some cases the courts have 
viewed industry agreements not to advertise as violations of antitrust law. 
For example, in 1995 the California Dental Association was convicted of con-
spiracy to prevent competition by discouraging its members from advertising. 
It had, according to the judge, “withheld from the public information about 
prices, quality, superiority of service, guarantees, and the use of procedures 
to allay patient anxiety.”
Conversely, advertising sometimes creates product differentiation and market 
power where there is no real difference in the product. Consider, in particular, the 
spectacularly successful advertising campaign of Absolut vodka.
In Twenty Ads That Shook the World, James B. Twitchell puts it this way: 
“The pull of Absolut’s magnetic advertising is curious because the product 
itself is so bland. Vodka is aquavit, and aquavit is the most unsophisticated of 
alcohols. . . . No taste, no smell. . . . In fact, the Swedes, who make the stuff, 
rarely drink Absolut. They prefer cheaper brands such as Explorer, Renat 
Brannwinn, or Skane. That’s because Absolut can’t advertise in Sweden, where 
alcohol advertising is against the law.”
But here’s a metaphysical question: if Absolut doesn’t really taste any different 
from other brands, but advertising convinces consumers that they are getting a 
distinctive product, who are we to say that they aren’t? Isn’t distinctiveness in the 
mind of the beholder?

Economically wasteful? Explain your answer.
a.  Advertisements on the benefits of aspirin
b.  Advertisements for Bayer aspirin

2. Some industry analysts have stated that a successful brand name is like a barrier to 
entry. Explain the reasoning behind this statement.
Solutions appear at back of book.
• In industries with product differ-
entiation, firms advertise in order 
to increase the demand for their 
products.
• Advertising is not a waste of 
resources when it gives consumers 
useful information about products.
• Advertising that simply touts a 
product is harder to explain. 
Either consumers are irrational, 
or expensive advertising communi-
cates that the firm’s products are 
of high quality.
• Some firms create brand names. 
As with advertising, the economic 
value of brand names can be 
ambiguous. They convey real infor-
mation when they assure consum-
ers of the quality of a product.
 Quick Review

449
In early 2010, Schick introduced the Hydro system, its latest and most advanced 
razor, two months before the introduction of Gillette’s Pro-Glide, the latest 
upgrade in its Fusion line. According to reports at the time, Schick and Gillette 
would jointly spend over $250 million in advertising for the two systems. It’s 
the latest round in a century-long rivalry between the two razor makers. Despite 
the rivalry, the razor business has been a profitable one; it has long been one of 
the priciest and highest profit margin sectors of nonfood packaged goods. 
Schick and Gillette clearly hoped that the sophistication and features of their 
new shavers would appeal to customers. Hydro came with a lubricating gel dis-
penser and blade guards for smoother shaving, and a five-blade version came 
with a trimming blade. Schick considered the two versions of Hydro to offer 
both an upgrade and a value play to its existing product, the four-blade Quattro 
introduced in 2003. (A value play is an item that appeals to customers who are 
shopping on the basis of price.) And both versions of Hydro were priced below 
comparable versions of Gillette’s five-bladed Fusion and three-bladed Mach 
razors, as well as the Pro-Glide, which Gillette planned to price at 10 to 15 percent 
above its existing Fusion line. 
This was not the first instance of a competitive razor launch. Back in 2003, 
Gillette and Schick went head-to-head when Gillette introduced its Mach 3 Turbo 
(an upgrade to its existing three-blade Mach 3), which delivered battery-powered 
pulses that Gillette said caused hair follicles to stand up, facilitating a closer 
shave. In 2003 Schick introduced the Quattro, the world’s first four-blade razor, 
which it called “unlike any other razor.” 
Gillette is by far the larger company of the two, capturing about 70% of the 
U.S. razor market in 2010. Although Schick has only about 12% of the market, 
many analysts believe it is the leader in innovation. “Schick appears to be grab-
bing the innovation lead and putting Gillette on the defensive,” says William 
Peoriello, an analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley. “The roster of new 
razors from Schick is forcing Gillette to change the pace of its new product 
launches and appears likely to give Gillette its strongest competition ever.” 
Some customers, though, are unimpressed with both companies’ offerings. 
In July 2010, the Wall Street Journal cited the example of Jeff Hagan, an invest-
ment banker, who searches out and stockpiles discontinued versions of Gillette’s 
Mach 3 razors and blades. It also profiled Steven Schimmel, the owner of an 
upscale pharmacy in Manhattan, who does a brisk business in old-fashioned, 
double-edge Gillette blades imported from a dealer in India. One disgruntled 
customer, Nick Meyers, gave up his four-blade Quattro because he got tired of 
trying to find drug store employees to unlock the blade case when he needed 
refills. “It’s easier to buy uranium,” said Meyers. “They’re so expensive, they have 
to keep them locked up, and that’s when I realized what a gimmick all of it is.” 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. What explains the complexity of today’s razors and the pace of innovation in their features? 
 2. Why is the razor business so profitable? What explains the size of the advertising budgets 
of Schick and Gillette?
 3. What explains the reaction of customers like Hagan and Meyers? What dilemma do 
Schick and Gillette face in their decisions about whether to maintain their older, simpler 
razor models? What does this indicate about the welfare value of the innovation in razors?

SUMMARY
 1. Monopolistic competition is a market structure 
in which there are many competing producers, each 
producing a differentiated product, and there is free 
entry and exit in the long run. Product differentiation 
takes three main forms: by style or type, by location, 
or by quality. Products of competing sellers are consid-
ered imperfect substitutes, and each firm has its own 
downward - sloping demand curve and marginal rev-
enue curve.
 2. Short - run profits will attract entry of new firms in 
the long run. This reduces the quantity each existing 
producer sells at any given price and shifts its demand 
curve to the left. Short - run losses will induce exit by 
some firms in the long run. This shifts the demand 
curve of each remaining firm to the right.
 3. In the long run, a monopolistically competitive 
industry is in zero - profit equilibrium: at its profit - 
maximizing quantity, the demand curve for each exist-
ing firm is tangent to its average total cost curve. There 
are zero profits in the industry and no entry or exit.
 4. In long - run equilibrium, firms in a monopolistically 
competitive industry sell at a price greater than 
marginal cost. They also have excess capacity 
because they produce less than the minimum - cost 
output; as a result, they have higher costs than firms 
in a perfectly competitive industry. Whether or not 
monopolistic competition is inefficient is ambiguous 
because consumers value the diversity of products 
that it creates.
 5. A monopolistically competitive firm will always 
prefer to make an additional sale at the going 
price, so it will engage in advertising to increase 
demand for its product and enhance its market 
power. Advertising and brand names that provide 
useful information to consumers are economically 
valuable. But they are economically wasteful when 
their only purpose is to create market power. In 
reality, advertising and brand names are likely to 
be some of both: economically valuable and economi-
cally wasteful.

PROBLEMS
 1. Use the three conditions for monopolistic competition 
discussed in the chapter to decide which of the follow-
ing firms are likely to be operating as monopolistic 
competitors. If they are not monopolistically competi-
tive firms, are they monopolists, oligopolists, or per-
fectly competitive firms?
 a. A local band that plays for weddings, parties, and 
so on
 b. Minute Maid, a producer of individual-serving juice 
boxes
 c. Your local dry cleaner
 d. A farmer who produces soybeans
 2. You are thinking of setting up a coffee shop. The mar-
ket structure for coffee shops is monopolistic com-
petition. There are three Starbucks shops and two 
other coffee shops very much like Starbucks in your 
town already. In order for you to have some degree 
of market power, you may want to differentiate your 
coffee shop. Thinking about the three different ways 
in which products can be differentiated, explain how 
you would decide whether you should copy Starbucks 
or whether you should sell coffee in a completely dif-
ferent way.
 3. The restaurant business in town is a monopolistically 
competitive industry in long-run equilibrium. One res-
taurant owner asks for your advice. She tells you that, 
each night, not all tables in her restaurant are full. She 
also tells you that she would attract more customers if 
she lowered the prices on her menu and that doing so 
would lower her average total cost. Should she lower 
her prices? Draw a diagram showing the demand curve, 
marginal revenue curve, marginal cost curve, and aver-
age total cost curve for this restaurant to explain your 
advice. Show in your diagram what would happen to 
the restaurant owner’s profit if she were to lower the 
price so that she sells the minimum-cost output.
 4. The market structure of the local gas station industry is 
monopolistic competition. Suppose that currently each 
gas station incurs a loss. Draw a diagram for a typical 
gas station to show this short-run situation. Then, in a 
separate diagram, show what will happen to the typical 
gas station in the long run. Explain your reasoning.
 5. The local hairdresser industry has the market struc-
ture of monopolistic competition. Your hairdresser 
boasts that he is making a profit and that if he con-
tinues to do so, he will be able to retire in five years. 
Use a diagram to illustrate your hairdresser’s current

situation. Do you expect this to last? In a separate dia-
gram, draw what you expect to happen in the long run. 
Explain your reasoning.
 6. Magnificent Blooms is a florist in a monopolistically 
competitive industry. It is a successful operation, pro-
ducing the quantity that minimizes its average total 
cost and making a profit. The owner also says that at 
its current level of output, its marginal cost is above 
marginal revenue. Illustrate the current situation of 
Magnificent Blooms in a diagram. Answer the follow-
ing questions by illustrating with a diagram.
a. In the short run, could Magnificent Blooms increase 
its profit?
b. In the long run, could Magnificent Blooms increase 
its profit?
7. “In the long run, there is no difference between monop-
olistic competition and perfect competition.” Discuss 
whether this statement is true, false, or ambiguous with 
respect to the following criteria.
a. The price charged to consumers
b. The average total cost of production
c. The efficiency of the market outcome
d. The typical firm’s profit in the long run
8. “In both the short run and in the long run, the typical 
firm in monopolistic competition and a monopolist 
each make a profit.” Do you agree with this statement? 
Explain your reasoning.
9. The market for clothes has the structure of monopolis-
tic competition. What impact will fewer firms in this 
industry have on you as a consumer? Address the fol-
lowing issues.
a. Variety of clothes
b. Differences in quality of service
c. Price
10. For each of the following situations, decide whether 
advertising is directly informative about the product 
or simply an indirect signal of its quality. Explain your 
reasoning.
a. Football great, Peyton Manning, drives a Buick in a 
TV commercial and claims that he prefers it to any 
other car.
b. A newspaper ad states, “For sale: 1999 Honda Civic, 
160,000 miles, new transmission.”
c. McDonald’s spends millions of dollars on an adver-
tising campaign that proclaims: “I’m lovin’ it.”
d. Subway advertises one of its sandwiches by claiming 
that it contains 6 grams of fat and fewer than 300 
calories.
11. In each of the following cases, explain how the adver-
tisement functions as a signal to a potential buyer. 
Explain what information the buyer lacks that is being 
supplied by the advertisement and how the informa-
tion supplied by the advertisement is likely to affect the 
buyer’s willingness to buy the good.
a. “Looking for work. Excellent references from previ-
ous employers available.”
b. “Electronic equipment for sale. All merchandise car-
ries a one-year, no-questions-asked warranty.”
c. “Car for sale by original owner. All repair and main-
tenance records available.”
12. The accompanying table shows the Herfindahl–
Hirschman Index (HHI) for the restaurant, cereal, 
movie, and laundry detergent industries as well as the 
advertising expenditures of the top 10 firms in each 
industry in 2006. Use the information in the table to

MANY 
PEOPLE 
IN 
THE 
northeastern United States, there 
is no better way to relax than to fish in 
one of the region’s thousands of lakes. 
But in the 1960s, avid fishermen noticed 
something alarming: lakes that had for-
merly teemed with fish were now almost 
empty. What had happened?
The answer was acid rain, caused 
mainly by coal - burning power plants. 
When coal is burned, it releases sulfur 
dioxide and nitric oxide into the atmo-
sphere; these gases react with water, pro-
ducing sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The 
result in the Northeast, downwind from 
the nation’s industrial heartland, was rain 
sometimes as acidic as lemon juice. Acid 
rain didn’t just kill fish; it also damaged 
trees and crops and in time even began 
to dissolve limestone buildings.
You’ll be glad to hear that the acid rain 
problem today is much less serious than 
it was in the 1960s. Power plants have 
reduced their emissions by switching to 
low - sulfur coal and installing scrubbers 
in their smokestacks. But they didn’t do 
this out of the goodness of their hearts; 
they did it in response to government 
policy. Without such government inter-
vention, power companies would have 
had no incentive to take the environmen-
tal effects of their actions into account.
When individuals impose costs on 
or provide benefits for others, but don’t 
have an economic incentive to take 
those costs or benefits into account, 
economists say that externalities are 
generated. You may recall that we briefly 
noted this phenomenon in Chapters 1 
and 4. There we stated that one of the 
principal sources of market failure is 
actions that create side effects that are 
not properly taken into account—that 
is, externalities. In this chapter, we’ll 
examine the economics of externalities, 
seeing how they can get in the way of 
economic efficiency and lead to mar-
ket failure, why they provide a reason 
for government inter ven tion in markets, 
and how economic analysis can be used 
to guide government policy.
Externalities arise from the side 
effects of actions. First, we’ll study the 
case of pollution, which generates a 
negative externality—a side effect that 
imposes costs on others. Whenever a 
side effect can be directly observed and 
quantified, it can be regulated: by impos-
ing direct controls on it, by taxing it, or 
by subsidizing it. As we will see, govern-
ment intervention in this case should be 
aimed directly at moving the market to 
the right quantity of the side effect.
Other activities generate positive exter-
nalities, a side effect that generates ben-
efits for others—for example, preserving 
farmland instead of developing it. In this 
case, government can use subsidies to 
move the market to the best quantity of 
the side effect from society’s point of view.
In the case of both positive and nega-
tive externalities, achieving the best 
solution takes place at the margin, set-
ting the benefit of doing a little bit more 
of something equal to the cost of doing 
that little bit more.
Lastly, we’ll return to the case of 
network externalities, a phenomenon we 
learned about in Chapter 13 that’s par-
ticularly common in high-tech indus-
tries. We’ll learn about what creates a 
network externality and why industries 
that have them are particularly difficult 
to regulate.

The Economics of Pollution
P
ollution is a bad thing. Yet most pollution is a side effect of activities that 
provide us with good things: our air is polluted by power plants generating 
the electricity that lights our cities, and our rivers are damaged by fertilizer 
runoff from farms that grow our food. Why shouldn’t we accept a certain amount 
of pollution as the cost of a good life?
Actually, we do. Even highly committed environmentalists don’t think 
that we can or should completely eliminate pollution—even an environmen-
tally conscious society would accept some pollution as the cost of producing 
useful goods and services. What environmentalists argue is that unless there 
is a strong and effective environmental policy, our society will generate too
much pollution—too much of a bad thing. And the great majority of econo-
mists agree.
To see why, we need a framework that lets us think about how much pollu-
tion a society should have. We’ll then be able to see why a market economy, left 
to itself, will produce more pollution than it should. We’ll start by adopting the 
simplest framework to study the problem—assuming that the amount of pollu-
tion emitted by a polluter is directly observable and controllable.
Costs and Benefits of Pollution
How much pollution should society allow? We learned in Chapter 9 that “how 
much” decisions always involve comparing the marginal benefit from an addi-
tional unit of something with the marginal cost of that additional unit. The same 
is true of pollution.
The marginal social cost of pollution is the 
additional cost imposed on society as a whole by an addi-
tional unit of pollution. For example, acid rain damages 
fisheries, crops, and forests, and each additional ton 
of sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere increases 
the damage.
The marginal social benefit of pollution—the 
additional benefit to society from an additional unit of 
pollution—may seem like a confusing concept. What’s 
good about pollution? However, avoiding pollution 
requires using scarce resources that could have been 
used to produce other goods and services. For example, 
to reduce the quantity of sulfur dioxide they emit, power 
companies must either buy expensive low - sulfur coal 
or install special scrubbers to remove sulfur from their 
emissions. The more sulfur dioxide they are allowed to 
emit, the lower these extra costs. Suppose we could cal-
culate how much money the power industry would save 
if it were allowed to emit an additional ton of sulfur 
dioxide. That savings would be the marginal benefit to society of emitting an 
extra ton of sulfur dioxide.
Using hypothetical numbers, Figure 16-1 shows how we can determine 
the socially optimal quantity of pollution—the quantity of pollution 
society would choose if all its costs and benefits were fully accounted for. 
The upward - sloping marginal social cost curve, MSC, shows how the margin-
al cost to society of an additional ton of pollution emissions varies with the 
quantity of emissions. (An upward slope is likely because nature can often 
safely handle low levels of pollution but is increasingly harmed as pollution 
reaches high levels.) The marginal social benefit curve, MSB, is downward 
The marginal social cost of 
pollution is the additional cost 
imposed on society as a whole by an 
additional unit of pollution.
The marginal social benefit of 
pollution is the additional gain to 
society as a whole from an additional 
unit of pollution.
The socially optimal quantity of 
pollution is the quantity of pollution 
that society would choose if all the 
costs and benefits of pollution were 
fully accounted for.
PITFALLS
SO HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE MARGINAL SOCIAL 
COST OF POLLUTION?
It might be confusing to think of marginal social cost—after 
all, we have up to this point always defined marginal cost 
as being incurred by an individual or a firm, not society as a 
whole. But it is easily understandable once we link it to the 
familiar concept of willingness to pay: the marginal social 
cost of a unit of pollution is equal to the sum of the willing-
ness to pay among all members of society to avoid that unit 
of pollution. It’s the sum because, in general, more than 
one person is affected by the pollution.
But calculating the true cost to society of pollution—
marginal or average—is a difficult matter, requiring 
a great deal of scientific knowledge, as the upcoming 
Economics in Action on smoking illustrates. As a result, 
society often underestimates the true marginal social 
cost of pollution.

C H A P T E R  1 6    E X T E R N A L I T I E S     455
sloping because it is progressively harder, and therefore 
more expensive, to achieve a further reduction in pollu-
tion as the total amount of pollution falls—increasingly 
more expensive technology must be used. As a result, 
as total pollution falls, the cost savings to a polluter of 
being allowed to emit one more ton rises.
The socially optimal quantity of pollution in this 
example isn’t zero. It’s QOPT, the quantity corresponding to 
point O, where MSB crosses MSC. At QOPT, the marginal 
social benefit from an additional ton of emissions and its 
marginal social cost are equalized at $200.
But will a market economy, left to itself, arrive at the 
socially optimal quantity of pollution? No, it won’t.
Pollution: An External Cost
Pollution yields both benefits and costs to society. But in a market economy 
without government intervention, those who benefit from pollution—like the 
owners of power companies—decide how much pollution occurs. They have no 
incentive to take into account the costs of pollution that they impose on others.
To see why, remember the nature of the benefits and costs from pollution. For 
polluters, the benefits take the form of monetary savings: by emitting an extra ton 
of sulfur dioxide, any given polluter saves the cost of buying expensive, low - sulfur 
coal or installing pollution - control equipment. So the benefits of pollution accrue 
directly to the polluters.
The costs of pollution, though, fall on people who have no say in the decision 
about how much pollution takes place: for example, people who fish in northeast-
ern lakes do not control the decisions of power plants.
The Socially Optimal Quantity of Pollution
16-1
Pollution yields both costs and benefits. Here the 
curve MSC shows how the marginal cost to society 
as a whole from emitting one more ton of pollution 
emissions depends on the quantity of emissions. 
The curve MSB shows how the marginal benefit 
to society as a whole of emitting an additional ton 
of pollution emissions depends on the quantity of 
pollution emissions. The socially optimal quantity 
of pollution is QOPT; at that quantity, the marginal 
social benefit of pollution is equal to the marginal 
social cost, corresponding to $200.

PITFALLS
SO HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE MARGINAL SOCIAL 
BENEFIT OF POLLUTION?
Similar to the problem of measuring the marginal social cost 
of pollution, the concept of willingness to pay helps us under-
stand the marginal social benefit of pollution in contrast to the 
marginal benefit to an individual or firm. The marginal social 
benefit of a unit of pollution is simply equal to the highest will-
ingness to pay for the right to emit that unit measured across 
all polluters. But unlike the marginal social cost of pollution, 
the value of the marginal social benefit of pollution is a num-
ber likely to be known—to polluters, that is.

456    P A R T  8    M I C RO EC O N O M I C S  A N D  P U B L I C  P O L I C Y
Figure 16-2 shows the result of this asymmetry between who reaps the 
benefits and who pays the costs. In a market economy without government 
intervention to protect the environment, only the benefits of pollution are taken 
into account in choosing the quantity of pollution. So the quantity of emissions 
won’t be the socially optimal quantity QOPT; it will be QMKT, the quantity at which 
the marginal social benefit of an additional ton of pollution is zero, but the mar-
ginal social cost of that additional ton is much larger—$400. The quantity of 
pollution in a market economy without government intervention will be higher 
than its socially optimal quantity. (The Pigouvian tax noted in Figure 16-2 will 
be explained shortly.)
The reason is that in the absence of government intervention, those who derive 
the benefits from pollution—in this case, the owners of power plants—don’t have 
to compensate those who bear the costs. So the marginal cost of pollution to any 
given polluter is zero: polluters have no incentive to limit the amount of emis-
sions. For example, before the Clean Air Act of 1970, midwestern power plants 
used the cheapest type of coal available, despite the fact that cheap coal generated 
more pollution, and they did nothing to scrub their emissions.
The environmental costs of pollution are the best - known and most important 
example of an external cost—an uncompensated cost that an individual or 
firm imposes on others. There are many other examples of external costs besides 
pollution. Another important, and certainly very familiar, external cost is traf-
fic congestion—an individual who chooses to drive during rush hour increases 
congestion and so increases the travel time of other drivers.
We’ll see later in this chapter that there are also important examples of exter-
nal benefits, benefits that individuals or firms confer on others without receiv-
ing compensation. External costs and benefits are jointly known as externalities, 
with external costs called negative externalities and external benefits called 
positive externalities.
As we’ve already suggested, externalities can lead to individual decisions that 
are not optimal for society as a whole. Let’s take a closer look at why.
Why a Market Economy Produces Too Much Pollution
16-2
In the absence of government inter-
vention, the quantity of pollution 
will be QMKT, the level at which the 
marginal social benefit of pollution 
is zero. This is an inefficiently high 
quantity of pollution: the marginal 
social cost, $400, greatly exceeds 
the marginal social benefit, $0. An 
optimal Pigouvian tax of $200, the 
value of the marginal social cost of 
pollution when it equals the marginal 
social benefit of pollution, can move 
the market to the socially optimal 
quantity of pollution, QOPT.

An external cost is an 
uncompensated cost that an 
individual or firm imposes on others.
An external benefit is a benefit 
that an individual or firm confers 
on others without receiving 
compensation.
External costs and benefits are 
known as externalities. External 
costs are negative externalities, 
and external benefits are positive 
externalities.

The Inefficiency of Excess Pollution
We have just shown that in the absence of government action, the quantity of 
pollution will be inefficient: polluters will pollute up to the point at which the 
marginal social benefit of pollution is zero, as shown by the pollution quantity, 
QMKT, in Figure 16-2. Recall that an outcome is efficient if no one could be made 
better off without making someone else worse off. In Chapter 4 we showed why 
the market equilibrium quantity in a perfectly competitive market is the efficient 
quantity of the good, the quantity that maximizes total surplus. Here, we can use 
a variation of that analysis to show how the presence of a negative externality 
upsets that result.
Because the marginal social benefit of pollution is zero at QMKT, reducing the quan-
tity of pollution by one ton would subtract very little from the total social benefit from 
pollution. In other words, the benefit to polluters from that last unit of pollution is very 
low—virtually zero. Meanwhile, the marginal social cost imposed on the rest of soci-
ety of that last ton of pollution at QMKT is quite high—$400. In other words, by reduc-
ing the quantity of pollution at QMKT by one ton, the total social cost of pollution falls 
by $400, but total social benefit falls by virtually zero. So total surplus rises 
by approximately $400 if the quantity of pollution at QMKT is reduced by 
one ton.
If the quantity of pollution is reduced further, there will be more gains in total 
surplus, though they will be smaller. For example, if the quantity of pollution is 
QH in Figure 16-2, the marginal social benefit of a ton of pollution is $100, but the 
marginal social cost is still $300. In other words, reducing the quantity of pollu-
tion by one ton leads to a net gain in total surplus of approximately $300 − $100 =
$200. This tells us that QH is still an inefficiently high quantity of pollution. Only 
if the quantity of pollution is reduced to QOPT, where the marginal social cost and 
the marginal social benefit of an additional ton of pollution are both $200, is the 
outcome efficient.
Why is that woman in the car in front 
of us driving so erratically? Is she 
drunk? No, she’s talking on her cell 
phone or texting.
Traffic safety experts take the risks 
posed by driving while using a cell 
phone very seriously: A recent study 
found a six-fold increase in accidents 
caused by driving while distracted. 
And in 2010, the National Safety 
Council estimated that 28% of traf-
fic accidents are attributable to cell-
phone use. Of the annual 1.4 million 
traffic accidents in the United States, 
200,000 are blamed on texting while 
driving. One estimate suggests that 
talking on cell phones while driving 
may be responsible for 3,000 or more 
traffic deaths each year. And using 
hands-free, voice-activated phones to 
make a call doesn’t seem to help much 
because the main danger is distraction. 
As one traffic consultant put it, “It’s not 
where your eyes are; it’s 
where your head is.”
The National Safety 
Council urges people not 
to use phones while driv-
ing. Most states have some 
restrictions on talking on a 
cell phone while driving. But 
in response to a growing 
number of accidents, sev-
eral states have banned cell 
phone use behind the wheel 
altogether. In 19 states and 
the District of Columbia, it 
is illegal to text and drive. Cell 
phone use while driving is 
illegal in many other countries as well, 
including Japan and Israel.
Why not leave the decision up to the 
driver? Because the risk posed by driv-
ing while using a cell phone isn’t just a 
risk to the driver; it’s also a safety risk 
to others—to a driver’s passengers, 
pedestrians, and people in other cars. 
Even if you decide that the benefit to 
you of using your cell phone while driv-
ing is worth the cost, you aren’t taking 
into account the cost to other people. 
Driving while using a cell phone, in other 
words, generates a serious—and some-
times fatal—negative externality.

Private Solutions to Externalities
Can the private sector solve the problem of externalities without government 
intervention? Bear in mind that when an outcome is inefficient, there is poten-
tially a deal that makes people better off. Why don’t individuals find a way to 
make that deal?
In an influential 1960 article, the economist and Nobel laureate Ronald Coase 
pointed out that in an ideal world the private sector could indeed deal with all 
externalities. According to the Coase theorem, even in the presence of externali-
ties an economy can always reach an efficient solution provided that the costs 
of making a deal are sufficiently low. The costs of making a deal are known as 
transaction costs.
To get a sense of Coase’s argument, imagine two neighbors, Mick and 
Christina, who both like to barbecue in their backyards on summer afternoons. 
Mick likes to play golden oldies on his boombox while barbecuing, but this 
annoys Christina, who can’t stand that kind of music.
Who prevails? You might think that it depends on the legal rights involved in 
the case: if the law says that Mick has the right to play whatever music he wants, 
Christina just has to suffer; if the law says that Mick needs Christina’s consent 
to play music in his backyard, Mick has to live without his favorite music while 
barbecuing.
But as Coase pointed out, the outcome need not be determined by legal rights, 
because Christina and Mick can make a private deal. Even if Mick has the right to 
play his music, Christina could pay him not to. Even if Mick can’t play the music 
without an OK from Christina, he can offer to pay her to give that OK. These pay-
ments allow them to reach an efficient solution, regardless of who has the legal 
upper hand. If the benefit of the music to Mick exceeds its cost to Christina, the 
music will go on; if the benefit to Mick is less than the cost to Christina, there 
will be silence.
The implication of Coase’s analysis is that externalities need not lead to 
inefficiency because individuals have an incentive to make mutually beneficial 
deals—deals that lead them to take externalities into account when making deci-
sions. When individuals do take externalities into account when making decisions, 
economists say that they internalize the externality. If externalities are fully 
internalized, the outcome is efficient even without government intervention.
Why can’t individuals always internalize externalities? Our barbecue example 
implicity assumes the transaction costs are low enough for Mick and Christina 
to be able to make a deal. In many situations involving externalities, however, 
transaction costs prevent individuals from making efficient deals. Examples of 
transaction costs include the following:
 • The costs of communication among the interested parties. Such costs may be 
very high if many people are involved.
 • The costs of making legally binding agreements. Such costs may be high if 
expensive legal services are required.
 • Costly delays involved in bargaining. Even if there is a potentially beneficial 
deal, both sides may hold out in an effort to extract more favorable terms, 
leading to increased effort and forgone benefit.
In some cases, people do find ways to reduce transaction costs, allowing them 
to internalize externalities. For example, a house with a junk-filled yard and peel-
ing paint imposes a negative externality on the neighboring houses, diminishing 
their value in the eyes of potential house buyers. So many people live in private 
communities that set rules for home maintenance and behavior, making bargain-
ing between neighbors unnecessary. But in many other cases, transaction costs 
are too high to make it possible to deal with externalities through private action. 
For example, tens of millions of people are adversely affected by acid rain. It 
According to the Coase theorem, 
even in the presence of externalities 
an economy can always reach 
an efficient solution as long as 
transaction costs—the costs to 
individuals of making a deal—are 
sufficiently low.
When individuals take external 
costs or benefits into account, they 
internalize the externality.

would be prohibitively expensive to try to make a deal among all those people and 
all those power companies.
When transaction costs prevent the private sector from dealing with externali-
ties, it is time to look for government solutions. We turn to public policy in the 
next section.

THANK YOU FOR NOT SMOKING
N
ew Yorkers call them the “shiver - and - puff people”—the smokers who 
stand outside their workplaces, even in the depths of winter, to take a cig-
arette break. Over the past couple of decades, rules against smoking in spaces 
shared by others have become ever stricter. This is partly a matter of personal 
dislike—nonsmokers really don’t like to smell other people’s cigarette smoke—
but it also reflects concerns over the health risks of second - hand smoke. As the 
Surgeon General’s warning on many packs says, “Smoking causes lung cancer, 
heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.” And there’s no 
question that being in the same room as someone who smokes exposes you to 
at least some health risk.
Second - hand smoke, then, is clearly an example of a negative externality. But 
how important is it? Putting a dollar - and - cents value on it—that is, measuring the 
marginal social cost of cigarette smoke—requires not only estimating the health 
effects but putting a value on these effects. Despite the difficulty, economists 
have tried. A paper published in 1993 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives 
surveyed the research on the external costs of both cigarette smoking and alco-
hol consumption.
According to this paper, valuing the health costs of cigarettes depends on 
whether you count the costs imposed on members of smokers’ families, includ-
ing unborn children, in addition to costs borne by smokers. If you don’t, the 
external costs of second - hand smoke have been estimated at about only $0.19 per 
pack smoked. (Using this method of calculation, $0.19 corresponds to the aver-
age social cost of smoking per pack at the current level of smoking in society.) A 
2005 study raised this estimate to $0.52 per pack smoked. If you include effects 
on smokers’ families, the number rises considerably—family members who live 
with smokers are exposed to a lot more smoke. (They are also exposed to the risk 
of fires, which alone is estimated at $0.09 per pack.) If you include the effects of 
smoking by pregnant women on their unborn children’s future health, the cost is 
immense—$4.80 per pack, which is more than twice the wholesale price charged 
by cigarette manufacturers.

 Quick Review
• There are costs as well as benefits 
to reducing pollution, so the opti-
mal quantity of pollution isn’t zero. 
Instead, the socially optimal quan-
tity of pollution is the quantity at 
which the marginal social cost of 
pollution is equal to the marginal 
social benefit of pollution.
• Left to itself, a market economy will 
typically generate an inefficiently high 
level of pollution because polluters 
have no incentive to take into account 
the costs they impose on others.
• External costs and benefits are known 
as externalities. Pollution is an 
example of an external cost, or neg-
ative externality; in contrast, some 
activities can give rise to external 
benefits, or positive externalities.
• According to the Coase theorem, the 
private sector can sometimes resolve 
externalities on its own: if transac-
tion costs aren’t too high, individu-
als can reach a deal to internalize 
the externality. When transaction 
costs are too high, government inter-
vention may be warranted.

Policies Toward Pollution
B
efore 1970, there were no rules governing the amount of sulfur dioxide 
power plants in the United States could emit—which is why acid rain got 
to be such a problem. After 1970, the Clean Air Act set rules about sulfur 
dioxide emissions—and the acidity of rainfall declined significantly. Economists 
argued, however, that a more flexible system of rules that exploited the effective-
ness of markets could achieve lower pollution at less cost. In 1990 this theory was 
put into effect with a modified version of the Clean Air Act. And guess what? The 
economists were right!
In this section we’ll look at the policies governments use to deal with pollution 
and at how economic analysis has been used to improve those policies.
Environmental Standards
The most serious external costs in the modern world are surely those associated 
with actions that damage the environment—air pollution, water pollution, habitat 
destruction, and so on. Protection of the environment has become a major role 
of government in all advanced nations. In the United States, the Environmental 
Protection Agency is the principal enforcer of environmental policies at the 
national level, supported by the actions of state and local governments.
How does a country protect its environment? At present the main policy tools 
are environmental standards, rules that protect the environment by specifying 
actions by producers and consumers. A familiar example is the law that requires 
almost all vehicles to have catalytic converters, which reduce the emission of 
chemicals that can cause smog and lead to health problems. Other rules require 
communities to treat their sewage or factories to avoid or limit certain kinds of 
pollution, and so on.
Environmental standards came into widespread use in the 1960s and 1970s, 
and they have had considerable success in reducing pollution. For example, since 
the United States passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, overall emission of pollut-
ants into the air has fallen by more than a third, even though the population has 
grown by a third and the size of the economy has more than doubled. Even in 
Los Angeles, still famous for its smog, the air has improved dramatically: in 1976 
ozone levels in the South Coast Air Basin exceeded federal standards on 194 days; 
in 2010, on only 7 days.
Despite these successes, economists believe that when regulators can control 
a polluter’s emissions directly, there are more efficient ways than environmen-
tal standards to deal with pollution. By using methods grounded in economic 
analysis, society can achieve a cleaner environment at lower cost. Most current 
environmental standards are inflexible and don’t allow reductions in pollution to 
be achieved at minimum cost. For example, two power plants—plant A and plant 
B—might be ordered to reduce pollution by the same percentage, even if their 
costs of achieving that objective are very different.
How does economic theory suggest that pollution should be directly con-
trolled? There are actually two approaches: taxes and tradable permits. As 
we’ll see, either approach can achieve the efficient outcome at the minimum 
feasible cost.
Emissions Taxes
One way to deal with pollution directly is to charge polluters an emissions 
tax. Emissions taxes are taxes that depend on the amount of pollution a firm 
produces. For example, power plants might be charged $200 for every ton of 
sulfur dioxide they emit.
Look again at Figure 16-2, which shows that the socially optimal quantity of 
pollution is QOPT. At that quantity of pollution, the marginal social benefit and 
Environmental standards are 
rules that protect the environment by 
specifying actions by producers and 
consumers.
An emissions tax is a tax that 
depends on the amount of pollution 
a firm produces.

marginal social cost of an additional ton of emissions are equal at $200. But in 
the absence of government intervention, power companies have no incentive to 
limit pollution to the socially optimal quantity, QOPT; instead, they will push pol-
lution up to the quantity QMKT, at which marginal social benefit is zero.
It’s now easy to see how an emissions tax can solve the problem. If power 
companies are required to pay a tax of $200 per ton of emissions, they now face 
a marginal cost of $200 per ton and have an incentive to reduce emissions to 
QOPT, the socially optimal quantity. This illustrates a general result: an emissions 
At first glance, a comparison of the per capita greenhouse 
gas emissions of various countries, shown in panel (a) of 
this graph, suggests that Australia, Canada, and the United 
States are the worst offenders. The average American is 
responsible for 23.4 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions 
(measured in CO2 equivalents)—the pollution that causes 
global warming—compared to only 6.9 tonnes for the aver-
age Uzbek, 5.5 tonnes for the average Chinese, and 1.7 
tonnes for the average Indian. (A tonne, also called a metric 
ton, equals 1.10 ton.) 
Such a conclusion, however, ignores an important factor 
in determining the level of a country’s greenhouse gas emis-
sions: its gross domestic product, or GDP—the total value 
of a country’s domestic output. Output typically cannot be 
produced without more energy, and more energy usage 
typically results in more pollution. In fact, some have argued 
that criticizing a country’s level of greenhouse gases without 
taking account of its level of economic development is mis-
guided. It would be equivalent to faulting a country for being 
at a more advanced stage of economic development. 
A more meaningful way to compare pollution across 
countries is to measure emissions per $1 million of a coun-
try’s GDP, as shown in panel (b). On this basis, the United 
States, Canada, India, and Australia are now “green” coun-
tries, but China and Uzbekistan are not. What explains the 
reversal once GDP is accounted for? The answer: both 
economics and government behavior. 
First, there is the issue of economics. Countries that 
are poor and have begun to industrialize, such as China 
and Uzbekistan, often view money spent to reduce pollu-
tion as better spent on other things. From their perspective, 
they are still too poor to afford as clean an environment as 
wealthy advanced countries. They claim that to impose a 
wealthy country’s environmental standards on them would 
jeopardize their economic growth.
Second, there is the issue of government behavior—or 
more precisely, whether or not a government possesses the 
tools necessary to effectively control pollution. China is a 
good illustration of this problem. The Chinese government 
lacks sufficient regulatory power to enforce its own environ-
mental rules, promote energy conservation, or encourage pol-
lution reduction. To produce $1 of GDP, China spends three 
times the world average on energy—far more than Indonesia, 
for example, which is also a poor country. The case of China 
illustrates just how important government intervention is in 
improving society’s welfare in the presence of externalities.

tax equal to the marginal social cost at the socially optimal quantity of pollution 
induces polluters to internalize the externality—to take into account the true 
costs to society of their actions.
Why is an emissions tax an efficient way (that is, a cost - minimizing way) 
to reduce pollution but environmental standards generally are not? Because 
an emissions tax ensures that the marginal benefit of pollution is equal for all 
sources of pollution, but an environmental standard does not. Figure 16-3 shows 
a hypothetical industry consisting of only two plants, plant A and plant B. We’ll 
assume that plant A uses newer technology than plant B and so has a lower cost of 
reducing pollution. Reflecting this difference in costs, plant A’s marginal benefit 
of pollution curve, MBA, lies below plant B’s marginal benefit of pollution curve, 
MBB. Because it is more costly for plant B to reduce its pollution at any output 
quantity, an additional ton of pollution is worth more to plant B than to plant A.
In the absence of government action, we know that polluters will pollute 
until the marginal social benefit of an additional unit of emissions is equal to 
zero. Recall that the marginal social benefit of pollution is the cost savings, at 
the margin, to polluters of an additional unit of pollution. As a result, without 
government intervention each plant will pollute until its own marginal benefit 
of pollution is equal to zero. This corresponds to an emissions quantity of 600 
tons each for plants A and B—the quantity of pollution at which MBA and MBB 
are each equal to zero. So although plant A and plant B value a ton of emissions 
differently, without government action they will each choose to emit the same 
amount of pollution.
Now suppose that the government decides that overall pollution from this 
industry should be cut in half, from 1,200 tons to 600 tons. Panel (a) of Figure 
16-3 shows how this might be achieved with an environmental standard that 
requires each plant to cut its emissions in half, from 600 to 300 tons. The 
standard has the desired effect of reducing overall emissions from 1,200 to 
600 tons but accomplishes it in an inefficient way. As you can see from panel 
(a), the environmental standard leads plant A to produce at point SA, where its 
marginal benefit of pollution is $150, but plant B produces at point SB, where 
its marginal benefit of pollution is twice as high, $300.
This difference in marginal benefits between the two plants tells us that the 
same quantity of pollution can be achieved at lower total cost by allowing plant 
B to pollute more than 300 tons but inducing plant A to pollute less. In fact, the 
efficient way to reduce pollution is to ensure that at the industry - wide outcome, 
the marginal benefit of pollution is the same for all plants. When each plant 
values a unit of pollution equally, there is no way to re arrange pollution reduc-
tion among the various plants that achieves the optimal quantity of pollution at 
a lower total cost.
We can see from panel (b) how an emissions tax achieves exactly that result. 
Suppose both plant A and plant B pay an emissions tax of $200 per ton, so that 
the marginal cost of an additional ton of emissions to each plant is now $200 
rather than zero. As a result, plant A produces at TA and plant B produces at TB. 
So plant A reduces its pollution more than it would under an inflexible environ-
mental standard, cutting its emissions from 600 to 200 tons; meanwhile, plant 
B reduces its pollution less, going from 600 to 400 tons. In the end, total pol-
lution—600 tons—is the same as under the environmental standard, but total 
surplus is higher. That’s because the reduction in pollution has been achieved 
efficiently, allocating most of the reduction to plant A, the plant that can reduce 
emissions at lower cost.
The term emissions tax may convey the misleading impression that taxes are 
a solution to only one kind of external cost, pollution. In fact, taxes can be used 
to discourage any activity that generates negative externalities, such as driving 
during rush hour or operating a noisy bar in a residential area. In general, taxes 
designed to reduce external costs are known as Pigouvian taxes, after the

costs are known as Pigouvian 
taxes.

economist A. C. Pigou, who emphasized their usefulness in his classic 1920 book, 
The Economics of Welfare. In our example, the optimal Pigouvian tax is $200; as 
you can see from Figure 16-2, this corresponds to the marginal social cost of pol-
lution at the optimal output quantity, QOPT.
Are there any problems with emissions taxes? The main concern is that in 
practice government officials usually aren’t sure how high the tax should be set. 
If they set the tax too low, there will be too little improvement in the environment; 
if they set it too high, emissions will be reduced by more than is efficient. This 
uncertainty cannot be eliminated, but the nature of the risks can be changed by 
using an alternative strategy, issuing tradable emissions permits.
Tradable Emissions Permits
Tradable emissions permits are licenses to emit limited quantities of pollut-
ants that can be bought and sold by polluters. They are usually issued to pollut-
ing firms according to some formula reflecting their history. For example, each 
power plant might be issued permits equal to 50% of its emissions before the 
system went into effect. The more important point, however, is that these permits

In both panels, MBA shows the marginal benefit of pol-

cost of reducing emissions is lower for plant A, as shown 
by the fact that MBA lies below MBB. Panel (a) shows the 
result of an environmental standard that requires both 
plants to cut emissions in half; this is inefficient, because 
it leaves the marginal benefit of pollution higher for plant 
B than for plant A. Panel (b) shows that an emissions tax 
achieves the same quantity of overall pollution efficiently: 
faced with an emissions tax of $200 per ton, each plant 
reduces pollution to the point where its marginal benefit

are tradable. Firms with differing costs of reducing pollution can now engage in 
mutually beneficial transactions: those that find it easier to reduce pollution will 
sell some of their permits to those that find it more difficult.
In other words, firms will use transactions in permits to re allocate pollution 
reduction among themselves, so that in the end those with the lowest cost will 
reduce their pollution the most, and those with the highest cost will reduce their 
pollution the least. Assume that the government issues 300 licenses each to plant 
A and plant B, where one license allows the emission of one ton of pollution. 
Under a system of tradable emissions permits, plant A will find it profitable to 
sell 100 of its 300 government - issued licenses to plant B. The effect of a tradable 
permit system is to create a market in rights to pollute.
Just like emissions taxes, tradable permits provide polluters with an incentive 
to take the marginal social cost of pollution into account. To see why, suppose 
that the market price of a permit to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide is $200. Then 
every plant has an incentive to limit its emissions of sulfur dioxide to the point 
where its marginal benefit of emitting another ton of pollution is $200. This is 
obvious for plants that buy rights to pollute: if a plant must pay $200 for the right 
to emit an additional ton of sulfur dioxide, it faces the same incentives as a plant 
facing an emissions tax of $200 per ton.
But it’s equally true for plants that have more permits than they plan to 
use: by not emitting a ton of sulfur dioxide, a plant frees up a permit that it 
can sell for $200, so the opportunity cost of a ton of emissions to the plant’s 
owner is $200.
In short, tradable emissions permits have the same cost - minimizing advan-
tage as emissions taxes over environmental standards: either system ensures that 
those who can reduce pollution most cheaply are the ones who do so. The socially 
optimal quantity of pollution shown in Figure 16-2 could be efficiently achieved 
either way: by imposing an emissions tax of $200 per ton of pollution or by issu-
ing tradable permits to emit QOPT tons of pollution. If regulators choose to issue 
QOPT permits, where one permit allows the release of one ton of emissions, then 
the equilibrium market price of a permit among polluters will indeed be $200. 
Why? You can see from Figure 16-2 that at QOPT, only polluters with a marginal 
benefit of pollution of $200 or more will buy a permit. And the last polluter who 
buys—who has a marginal benefit of exactly $200—sets the market price.
It’s important to realize that emissions taxes and tradable permits do more 
than induce polluting industries to reduce their output. Unlike rigid environmen-
tal standards, emissions taxes and tradable permits provide incentives to create 
and use technology that emits less pollution—new technology that lowers the 
socially optimal level of pollution. The main effect of the permit system for sul-
fur dioxide has been to change how electricity is produced rather than to reduce 
the nation’s electricity output. For example, power companies have shifted to the 
use of alternative fuels such as low - sulfur coal and natural gas; they have also 
installed scrubbers that take much of the sulfur dioxide out of a power plant’s 
emissions.
The main problem with tradable emissions permits is the flip - side of the prob-
lem with emissions taxes: because it is difficult to determine the optimal quantity 
of pollution, governments can find themselves either issuing too many permits 
(that is, they don’t reduce pollution enough) or issuing too few (that is, they reduce 
pollution too much).
After first relying on environmental standards, the U.S. government has 
turned to a system of tradable permits to control acid rain. Current proposals 
would extend the system to other major sources of pollution. And in 2005 the 
European Union created the largest emissions-trading scheme, with the purpose 
of controlling emissions of carbon dioxide, also known as greenhouse gases. The 
EU scheme is part of a larger global market for the trading of greenhouse gas 
permits. The Economics in Action that follows describes these two systems.

CAP AND TRADE
T
he tradable emissions permit systems for both acid rain in the United 
States and greenhouse gases in the European Union are examples of cap 
and trade systems: the government sets a cap (a maximum amount of pollutant 
that can be emitted), issues tradable emissions permits, and enforces a yearly 
rule that a polluter must hold a number of permits equal to the amount of pol-
lutant emitted. The goal is to set the cap low enough to generate environmental 
benefits, while giving polluters flexibility in meeting environmental standards 
and motivating them to adopt new technologies that will lower the cost of 
reducing pollution.
In 1994 the United States began a cap and 
trade system for the sulfur dioxide emissions 
that cause acid rain by issuing permits to 
power plants based on their historical con-
sumption of coal. Thanks to the system, air 
pollutants in the United States decreased by 
more than 40% from 1990 to 2008, and 2010 
acid rain levels dropped to approximately 50% 
of their 1980 levels. Economists who have ana-
lyzed the sulfur dioxide cap and trade system 
point to another reason for its success: it would 
have been a lot more expensive—80% more to 
be exact—to reduce emissions by this much 
using a non - market-based regulatory policy.
The EU cap and trade scheme, cover-
ing all 27 member nations of the European 
Union, is the world’s only mandatory trading 
scheme for greenhouse gases. It is scheduled 
to achieve a 21% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to 2005 levels.
Other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, have adopted less compre-
hensive trading schemes for greenhouse gases. According to the World Bank, the 
worldwide market for greenhouse gases—also called carbon trading—has grown 
rapidly, from $11 billion in permits traded in 2005 to $142 billion in 2010. In New 
Zealand, famous for its sheep and lamb industry, farmers are busy converting 
grazing land into forests so that they can sell permits beginning in 2015, when 
companies will be required to pay for their emissions.
Despite all this good news, however, cap and trade systems are not silver bul-
lets for the world’s pollution problems. Although they are appropriate for pollu-
tion that’s geographically dispersed, like sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases, 
they don’t work for pollution that’s localized, like mercury or lead contamina-
tion. In addition, the amount of overall reduction in pollution depends on the 
level of the cap. Under industry pressure, regulators run the risk of issuing too 
many permits, effectively eliminating the cap. Finally, there must be vigilant 
monitoring of compliance if the system is to work. Without oversight of how 
much a polluter is actually emitting, there is no way to know for sure that the 
rules are being followed.

 Quick Review
• Governments often limit pollution 
with environmental standards. 
Generally, such standards are an 
inefficient way to reduce pollution 
because they are inflexible.
• When the quantity of pollution emit-
ted can be directly observed and 
controlled, environmental goals can 
be achieved efficiently in two ways: 
emissions taxes and tradable emis-
sions permits. These methods are 
efficient because they are flexible, 
allocating more pollution reduction 
to those who can do it more cheaply. 
They also motivate polluters to adopt 
new pollution-reducing technology.
• An emissions tax is a form of 
Pigouvian tax. The optimal 
Pigouvian tax is equal to the mar-
ginal social cost of pollution at the 
socially optimal quantity of pollution.

Positive Externalities
N
ew Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country, lying along 
the northeastern corridor, an area of almost continuous development 
stretching from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Yet a drive through New 
Jersey reveals a surprising feature: acre upon acre of farmland, growing every-
thing from corn to pumpkins to the famous Jersey tomatoes. This situation is no 
accident: starting in 1961, New Jerseyans have voted in a series of measures that 
subsidize farmers to permanently preserve their farmland rather than sell it to 
developers. By 2011, the Green Acres Program, administered by the state, had 
preserved over 650,000 acres of open space.
Why have New Jersey citizens voted to raise their own taxes to subsidize the pres-
ervation of farmland? Because they believe that preserved farmland in an already 
heavily developed state provides external benefits, such as natural beauty, access to 
fresh food, and the conservation of wild bird populations. In addition, preservation 
alleviates the external costs that come with more development, such as pressure on 
roads, water supplies, and municipal services—and, inevitably, more pollution.
In this section we’ll explore the topics of external benefits and positive externalities. 
They are, in many ways, the mirror images of external costs and negative externalities. 
Left to its own, the market will produce too little of a good (in this case, preserved 
New Jersey farmland) that confers external benefits on others. But society as a whole 
is better off when policies are adopted that increase the supply of such a good.
Preserved Farmland: An External Benefit
Preserved farmland yields both benefits and costs to society. In the absence of gov-
ernment intervention, the farmer who wants to sell his land incurs all the costs of 
preservation—namely, the forgone profit to be made from selling the farmland to 
a developer. But the benefits of preserved farmland accrue not to the farmer but to 
neighboring residents, who have no right to influence how the farmland is disposed of. 
Figure 16-4 illustrates society’s problem. The marginal social cost of preserved 
farmland, shown by the MSC curve, is the additional cost imposed on society 
by an additional acre of such farmland. This represents the forgone profits that 
would have accrued to farmers if they had sold their land to developers. The line 
is upward-sloping because when very few acres are preserved and there is plenty 
of land available for development, the profit that could be made from selling an 
acre to a developer is small. But as the number of preserved acres increases and 
few are left for development, the amount a developer is willing to pay for them, 
and therefore the forgone profit, increases as well. 
The MSB curve represents the marginal social benefit of preserved farmland. 
It is the additional benefit that accrues to society—in this case, the farmer’s 
neighbors—when an additional acre of farmland is preserved. The curve is down-
ward sloping because as more farmland is preserved, the benefit to society of 
preserving another acre falls. As Figure 16-4 shows, the socially optimal point, O, 
occurs when the marginal social cost and the marginal social benefit are equal-
ized—here, at a price of $10,000 per acre. At the socially optimum point, QOPT 
acres of farmland are preserved. 

C H A P T E R  1 6    E X T E R N A L I T I E S     467
The market alone will not provide QOPT acres of preserved farmland. Instead, 
in the market outcome no acres will be preserved; the level of preserved farmland, 
QMKT, is equal to zero. That’s because farmers will set the marginal social cost of 
preservation—their forgone profits—at zero and sell all their acres to developers. 
Because farmers bear the entire cost of preservation but gain none of the benefits, 
an inefficiently low quantity of acres will be preserved in the market outcome. 
This is clearly inefficient because at zero acres preserved, the marginal social 
benefit of preserving an acre of farmland is $20,000. So how can the economy be 
induced to produce QOPT acres of preserved farmland, the socially optimal level? 
The answer is a Pigouvian subsidy: a payment designed to encourage activities 
that yield external benefits. The optimal Pigouvian subsidy, as shown in Figure 
16-4, is equal to the marginal social benefit of preserved farmland at the socially 
optimal level, QOPT—that is, $10,000 per acre.
So New Jersey voters are indeed implementing the right policy to raise their social 
welfare—taxing themselves in order to provide subsidies for farmland preservation.
Positive Externalities in the Modern Economy
In the overall U.S. economy, the most important single source of external benefits is 
the creation of knowledge. In high-tech industries such as semiconductors, software 
design, green technology, and bioengineering, innovations by one firm are quickly 
emulated and improved upon by rival firms. Such spreading of knowledge across indi-
viduals and firms is known as a technology spillover. In the modern economy, the 
greatest sources of technology spillovers are major universities and research institutes.
In technologically advanced countries such as the United States, Japan, the 
United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Israel, there is an ongoing exchange of peo-
ple and ideas among private industries, major universities, and research institutes 
located in close proximity. The dynamic interplay that occurs in these research clus-
ters spurs innovation and competition, theoretical advances, and practical applica-
tions. (See the Business Case at the end of the chapter for more on research clusters.)
Why a Market Economy Preserves Too Little Farmland
16-4
Without government interven-
tion, the quantity of preserved 
farmland will be zero, the level at 
which the marginal social cost 
of preservation is zero. This is 
an inefficiently low quantity of 
preserved farmland: the marginal 
social benefit is $20,000, but 
the marginal social cost is zero. 
An optimal Pigouvian subsidy of 
$10,000, the value of the mar-
ginal social benefit of preserva-
tion when it equals the marginal 
social cost, can move the market 
to the socially optimal level of 
preservation, QOPT.

One of the best known and most successful research clusters is the Research 
Triangle in North Carolina, anchored by Duke University and the University of 
North Carolina, several other universities and hospitals, and companies such 
as IBM, Pfizer, and Qualcomm. Ultimately, these areas of technology spillover 
increase the economy’s productivity and raise living standards. 
But research clusters don’t appear out of thin air. Except in a few instances 
in which firms have funded basic research on a long-term basis, research clus-
ters have grown up around major universities. And like farmland preservation 
in New Jersey, major universities and their research activities are subsidized by 
government. In fact, government policy makers in advanced countries have long 
understood that the external benefits generated by knowledge, stemming from 
basic education to high-tech research, are key to the economy’s growth over time.

THE IMPECCABLE ECONOMIC LOGIC OF 
EARLY-CHILDHOOD INTERVENTION PROGRAMS
O
ne of the most vexing problems facing any society is how to break what research-
ers call the “cycle of poverty”: children who grow up in disadvantaged socioeco-
nomic circumstances are far more likely to remain trapped in poverty as adults, even 
after we account for differences in ability. They are more likely to be unemployed or 
underemployed, to engage in crime, and to suffer chronic health problems.
Early-childhood intervention has offered some hope of breaking the cycle. A 2006 
study by the RAND Corporation found that high - quality 
early-childhood programs that focus on education and health 
care lead to significant social, intellectual, and financial 
advantages for kids who would otherwise be at risk of drop-
ping out of high school and of engaging in criminal behavior. 
Children in programs like Head Start were less likely to 
engage in such destructive behaviors and more likely to end 
up with a job and to earn a high salary later in life.
Another study by researchers at the University of 
Pittsburgh in 2003 looked at early-childhood interven-
tion programs from a dollars-and-cents perspective, 
finding from $4 to $7 in benefits for every $1 spent on 
early-childhood intervention programs, while a Rand 
study put the figure as high as $17 per $1 spent. The 
Pittsburgh study also pointed to one program whose 
participants, by age 20, were 26% more likely to have fin-
ished high school, 35% less likely to have been charged 
in juvenile court, and 40% less likely to have repeated a 
grade compared to individuals of similar socio  economic background who did 
not attend pre school. 
The observed external benefits to society of these programs are so large that 
the Brookings Institution predicts that providing high - quality pre school educa-
tion to every American child would result in an increase in GDP, the total value of 
a country’s domestic output, by almost 2%, representing over 3 million more jobs.

Network Externalities
I
n Chapter 13 we explained that a network externality exists when the value 
of a good or service to an individual is greater when a large number of other 
people also use the good or service. Although network externalities are com-
mon in technology-driven sectors of the economy, the phenomenon is consider-
ably more widespread than that.
Unlike positive and negative externalities, network externalities have no inher-
ently favorable or adverse effect on society. What they share, rather, is the exis-
tence of an external effect from one person’s actions.
Network externalities play a key role both in the modern economy and in a 
number of policy controversies. Here we will examine more closely where and how 
network externalities occur and then at some of the regulatory issues they raise.
Types of Network Externalities
For all network externalities, the value of the good or service is derived entirely 
from its ability to link many people possessing the same good or service. As a 
result, the marginal benefit of the good or service to any one individual depends 
on the number of other individuals who use it.
Although most network externalities involve methods of communication—the 
Internet, telephones, fax machines, and so on—they can exist when other users 
are not strictly necessary for the use of a good, as long as they enhance its use-
fulness. For example, in the early days of railroad development, a railroad from 
New York to Chicago would have had considerable value all by itself, as would 
have a railroad from Kansas City to Chicago. However, each line was worth more 
given the existence of the other, because once both were in place, goods could be 
shipped via Chicago between New York and Kansas City. In the modern world, a 
scheduled flight between two airports becomes more valuable if one or both of 
those airports is a hub with connections to other places.
Even this kind of direct link need not be necessary to create important net-
work externalities. Any way in which other people’s consumption of a good or 
service increases your own marginal benefit from consumption of that good or 
service can give rise to network effects.
Recall that the classic case of indirect network externalities is computer 
operating systems and that most personal computers around the world run 
on Windows by Microsoft.
Why does Windows dominate over other operating systems such as Apple’s 
OSX or Linux? Is a personal computer running Windows useful only to the extent 
that other people possess the same good? Not in a direct sense; there isn’t a literal 
network issue making Windows the preferred system.
The dominance of Windows is self - reinforcing for at least two indirect rea-
sons. First, it is easier for a Windows user to get help and advice from other 
computer users than for someone using a less popular system. Second, Windows 
attracts more attention from software developers, so more programs run on 
Windows than on any other operating system.
Network externalities in this broad sense occur for many goods and services. 
Even your choice of a car is influenced by a form of network externalities. Most 
people would be reluctant to switch to a car that runs on natural gas because 
fueling the car would be difficult: very few gas stations offer natural gas. And the 

470    P A R T  8    M I C RO EC O N O M I C S  A N D  P U B L I C  P O L I C Y
reason service stations do not offer natural gas is, of course, that few people drive 
anything other than gasoline-powered cars. Or to take a less drastic example, 
people who live in small towns are reluctant to drive an unusual imported vehicle: 
where would they find a mechanic who knows how to fix it? So the circularity 
that makes one person choose Windows because everyone else uses Windows also 
applies to non - high - tech goods like cars.
When a good or service is subject to a network externality, it exhibits positive 
feedback: if large numbers of people buy it, other people become more likely to 
buy it, too. If people don’t buy the good or service, others become less likely to buy 
it. So both success and failure tend to be self - reinforcing. This leads to a kind of 
“chicken - versus - egg problem”: if each person places a positive value on a product 
based on whether another person owns it, how do you get anyone to buy it in the 
first place? Producers of products that are subject to network externalities are 
aware of this problem, understanding that of two competing products, it’s the one 
with the largest network—not necessarily the one that’s the better product—that 
will win in the end. That is, the product with the largest network will eventually 
dominate the market, and competing products will eventually disappear. 
One way to gain an advantage at the early stages of this kind of market is to 
sell the product cheaply, perhaps at a loss, in order to increase the size of the net-
work. So we often see companies introducing new high - technology products at a 
price well below production costs. For example, during the 1990s, the two main 
competitors in the market for Internet browser software, Netscape Navigator and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, both offered their products for free. And even today, 
many cell phone companies offer free handsets to attract consumers to their 
wireless network.
Finally, network externalities present special challenges for antitrust regula-
tors because the antitrust laws do not, strictly speaking, forbid monopoly. Rather, 
they only prohibit “monopolization”—efforts to create a monopoly. If you just 
happen to end up ruling an industry, that’s OK, but if you take actions designed 
to drive out competition, that’s not OK. So we could argue that monopolies in 
goods with network externalities, because they occur naturally, should not pose 
legal problems.
Unfortunately, it isn’t that simple. Firms investing in new technologies are 
clearly trying to establish monopoly positions. Furthermore, in the face of posi-
tive feedback, firms have an incentive to engage in aggressive strategies to push 
their goods in order to increase their network size and tip the market in their 
direction. So what is the dividing line between legal and illegal actions?
At this point, the rules are somewhat in flux. In the Microsoft antitrust case, 
described in the following Economics in Action, reasonable economists and legal 
experts disagreed sharply both about whether the company had broken the law by 
pursuing a monopoly position and about whether the company should be broken 
up to diminish its ability to tip new markets in its favor.

THE MICROSOFT CASE
I
n 2000 the Justice Department took on Microsoft in one of the most watched 
antitrust cases in history. By that time, Microsoft had become the world’s most 
valuable corporation, and its founder, Bill Gates, was the world’s richest man. 
What the government sought was nothing less than the breakup of the company.
The case involved almost all of the issues raised by goods with network exter-
nalities. Microsoft was, by any reasonable definition, a monopoly: leaving aside 
the niches of Apple customers and Linux users, just about all personal computers 
ran the Windows operating system. The key fact sustaining the Windows sys-
tem was the force of a network externality: people used Windows because other 
people used Windows.
A good is subject to positive 
feedback when success breeds 
greater success and failure breeds 
further failure.

C H A P T E R  1 6    E X T E R N A L I T I E S     471
The government did not, however, challenge the Windows 
monopoly itself (although some economists urged it to). Most 
experts agreed that monopoly per se is a natural thing in such 
industries and should not be prevented. What the government 
claimed, however, was that Microsoft had used its monopoly 
position in operating systems to give its other products an 
advantage over competitors. For example, by including Internet 
Explorer as part of the Windows system, it was alleged, 
Microsoft was giving itself an unfair advantage over its rival 
Netscape in the browser software market.
Why was this considered harmful? The government argued 
both that monopolies were being created unnecessarily and 
that Microsoft was discouraging innovation. Potential innova-
tors in software, the government claimed, were unwilling to 
invest large sums out of fear that Microsoft would use its con-
trol of the operating system to take away any market competi-
tors might win: Microsoft would produce a competing product 
that would then be sold as a bundle with the Windows operat-
ing system. For its part, Microsoft argued that by setting the 
precedent that companies would be punished for success, the government was the 
real opponent of innovation—innovation that had benefited customers with lower 
prices and increasingly sophisticated products. 
At first the case went against Microsoft, when a judge ordered the company 
split in two—into an operating - system company and a company selling the firm’s 
other products. But this judgment was overturned on appeal. In November 2001, 
the government reached a settlement with Microsoft in which the company 
agreed to provide other companies with the technology to develop products that 
interacted seamlessly with Microsoft’s software, thus removing the company’s 
special advantage acquired through bundling its products.
Competitors complained bitterly that this settlement had far too many 
loopholes and that Microsoft’s ability to exploit its monopoly position would 
remain. And by early 2004, the government agreed: antitrust lawyers from 
the Justice Department reported to the judge who negotiated the original 
settlement that they were increasingly uneasy about the plan’s ability to spur 
competition. However, in mid - 2004 a federal appeals court upheld the 2001 
settlement, and in November 2007, Microsoft’s obligations under the original 
settlement expired.

 Quick Review
• Network externalities arise when 
the value of a good increases when 
a large number of other people also 
use the good. They are prevalent 
in communications, transportation, 
and high-technology industries. 
• Goods with network externalities 
exhibit positive feedback: success 
breeds further success, and failure 
breeds further failure. The good 
with the largest network eventually 
dominates the market, and rival 
goods disappear. As a result, in 
early stages of the market, firms 
have an incentive to take aggres-
sive actions, such as lowering price 
below production cost, to enlarge 
the size of their good’s network.
• Goods with network externalities 
pose special problems for anti trust 
regulators because they tend toward 
monopoly. It can be difficult to distin-
guish what is a natural growth of the 
network and what is an illegal monop-
olization effort by the producer.

Silicon Valley in California and Route 128 in Massachusetts are the preeminent 
high-tech clusters in the world. Silicon Valley dates back to the early 1930s, when 
Stanford University encouraged its electrical engineering graduates to stay in the 
area and start companies.
In the early 1950s Stanford created the Stanford Industrial Park, leasing 
university land to high-tech companies that worked closely with its engineering 
school. In the mid-1950s, defense contractors such as Lockheed brought dollars 
to the area. By the late 1960s, a critical mass of such talent had accumulated. 
For example, in 1968, eight young engineers left their employer over a disagree-
ment; over the next 20 years, they founded 65 new companies, including Intel 
Corporation, which later created the microprocessor chip, the brain of personal 
computers. 
This pattern repeated: one researcher estimated that in small and medium-
sized firms, 35% of the workforce would, on average, turn over in a year. Silicon 
Valley became a fertile location for startups, with dozens sprouting every year—
everything from firms specializing in hardware and software to network firms 
like eBay, Facebook, and Google. It also became home to investors who special-
ize in financing new high-tech companies. Silicon Valley’s compact geographical 
location allowed people to form close social and research bonds even while work-
ing for rival firms.
On the other side of the country, a high-tech cluster known as Route 128 lies 
on a 65-mile highway surrounding Boston and Cambridge. It owes its begin-
nings to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the top engineering 
university in the world, as well as funding from the U.S. military, NASA, and the 
National Science Foundation. In the 1950s Route 128 dominated Silicon Valley, 
with three times the employment.
But early on Route 128 differed from Silicon Valley in significant ways. 
Geographically, Route 128 was more spread out than Silicon Valley. Its firms 
were larger, reflecting the needs of defense contractors during the Cold War. And 
MIT extended little help to Route 128 firms. 
Another major difference between the two clusters lay in how firms were 
organized. Route 128 firms tended to be “vertically integrated,” combining the 
entire chain of production from research to design to production in the same 
firm. Silicon Valley firms focused exclusively on research and design, contracting 
production out to specialized firms that achieved economies of scale. In contrast 
to the fluidity of employees and ideas across companies in Silicon Valley, Route 
128 firms emphasized a commitment to lifetime employment and closely guarded 
their innovations to remain competitive.
The 1970s and 1980s were harsh for Route 128. Military spending dried up, 
and it lost its edge in minicomputers when Apollo Computers lost its preeminence 
to an aggressive Silicon Valley firm, Sun Microsystems. By 1980, electronics 
employment in Silicon Valley was three times that of Route 128. Over time, Route 
128 ceded the advantage to Silicon Valley in electronics and networking. Today its 
niche is in biotechnology, genetics, materials engineering, and finance.

CASE 

SUMMARY
 1. When pollution can be directly observed and con-
trolled, government policies should be geared directly 
to producing the socially optimal quantity of pollu-
tion, the quantity at which the marginal social cost 
of pollution is equal to the marginal social benefit 
of pollution. In the absence of government interven-
tion, a market produces too much pollution because 
polluters take only their benefit from polluting into 
account, not the costs imposed on others.
 2. The costs to society of pollution are an example of 
an external cost; in some cases, however, economic 
activities yield external benefits. External costs 
and benefits are jointly known as externalities, with 
external costs called negative externalities and 
external benefits called positive externalities.
 3. According to the Coase theorem, individuals can find 
a way to internalize the externality, making govern-
ment intervention unnecessary, as long as transaction 
costs—the costs of making a deal—are sufficiently 
low. However, in many cases transaction costs are too 
high to permit such deals.
 4. Governments often deal with pollution by imposing 
environmental standards, a method, economists 
argue, that is usually an inefficient way to reduce pol-
lution. Two efficient (cost - minimizing) methods for 
reducing pollution are emissions taxes, a form of 
Pigouvian tax, and tradable emissions permits. 
The optimal Pigouvian tax on pollution is equal to its 
marginal social cost at the socially optimal quantity 
of pollution. These methods also provide incentives for 
the creation and adoption of production technologies 
that cause less pollution.
 5. When a good or activity yields external benefits, or 
positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, 
then an optimal Pigouvian subsidy to producers 
moves the market to the socially optimal quantity of 
production. 
 6. Communications, transportation, and high-technology 
goods are frequently subject to network externalities, 
which arise when the value of the good to an indi-
vidual is greater when a large number of people use the 
good. Such goods are likely to be subject to positive 
feedback: if large numbers of people buy the good, 
other people are more likely to buy it, too. So success 
breeds greater success and failure breeds failure: the 
good with the larger network will eventually dominate, 
and rival goods will disappear. As a result, produc-
ers have an incentive to take aggressive action in the 
early stages of the market to increase the size of their 
network. Markets with network externalities tend to be 
monopolies. They are especially challenging for anti-
trust regulators because it can be hard to differentiate 
between the natural progression of the network exter-
nality and illegal monopolization efforts by producers.

PROBLEMS
 1. What type of externality (positive or negative) is 
present in each of the following examples? Is the 
marginal social benefit of the activity greater than 
or equal to the marginal benefit to the individual? 
Is the marginal social cost of the activity greater 
than or equal to the marginal cost to the individual? 
Without intervention, will there be too little or too 
much (relative to what would be socially optimal) of 
this activity?
 a. Mr. Chau plants lots of colorful flowers in his front 
yard.
 b. Your next-door neighbor likes to build bonfires 
in his backyard, and sparks often drift onto your 
house.
 c. Maija, who lives next to an apple orchard, decides to 
keep bees to produce honey.
 d. Justine buys a large SUV that consumes a lot of 
gasoline.

tified. The accompanying table shows the marginal

 a. Draw the marginal social benefit curve and the mar-
ginal social cost curve. Use your diagram to deter-
mine the socially optimal volume of music.
 b. Only the members of the sorority benefit from the 
music, and they bear none of the cost. Which vol-
ume of music will they choose?
 c. The college imposes a Pigouvian tax of $3 per deci-
bel of music played. From your diagram, determine 
the volume of music the sorority will now choose.
 3. Many dairy farmers in California are adopting a new 
technology that allows them to produce their own elec-
tricity from methane gas captured from animal wastes. 
(One cow can produce up to 2 kilowatts a day.) This 
practice reduces the amount of methane gas released 
into the atmosphere. In addition to reducing their own 
utility bills, the farmers are allowed to sell any electric-
ity they produce at favorable rates. 
 a. Explain how the ability to earn money from captur-
ing and transforming methane gas behaves like a 
Pigouvian tax on methane gas pollution and can 
lead dairy farmers to emit the efficient amount of 
methane gas pollution.
 b. Suppose some dairy farmers have lower costs of 
transforming methane into electricity than others. 
Explain how this system leads to an efficient alloca-
tion of emissions reduction among farmers.
 4. Voluntary environmental programs were extremely 
popular in the United States, Europe, and Japan in 
the 1990s. Part of their popularity stems from the fact 
that these programs do not require legislative author-
ity, which is often hard to obtain. The 33/50 program 
started by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
is an example of such a program. With this program, 
the EPA attempted to reduce industrial emissions of 17 
toxic chemicals by providing information on relatively 
inexpensive methods of pollution control. Companies 
were asked to voluntarily commit to reducing emis-
sions from their 1988 levels by 33% by 1992 and by 
50% by 1995. The program actually met its second 
target by 1994.
 a. As in Figure 16-3, draw marginal benefit curves for 
pollution generated by two plants, A and B, in 1988. 
Assume that without government intervention, each 
plant emits the same amount of pollution, but that 
at all levels of pollution less than this amount, plant 
A’s marginal benefit of polluting is less than that 
of plant B. Label the vertical axis “Marginal ben-
efit to individual polluter” and the horizontal axis 
“Quantity of pollution emissions.” Mark the quantity 
of pollution each plant produces without govern-
ment action. 
 b. Do you expect the total quantity of pollution before 
the program was put in place to have been less than 
or more than the optimal quantity of pollution? 
Why?
 c. Suppose the plants whose marginal benefit curves 
you depicted in part a were participants in the 33/50 
program. In a replica of your graph from part a, 
mark targeted levels of pollution in 1995 for the two 
plants. Which plant was required to reduce emis-
sions more? Was this solution necessarily efficient?
 d. What kind of environmental policy does the 33/50 
program most closely resemble? What is the main 
shortcoming of such a policy? Compare it to two 
other types of environmental policy discussed in 
this chapter.
 5. According to a report from the U.S. Census Bureau, 
“the average [lifetime] earnings of a full-time, year 
round worker with a high school education are about 
$1.2 million compared with $2.1 million for a college 
graduate.” This indicates that there is a considerable 
benefit to a graduate from investing in his or her own 
education. Tuition at most state universities covers only 
about two-thirds to three-quarters of the cost, so the 
state applies a Pigouvian subsidy to college education.
If a Pigouvian subsidy is appropriate, is the externali-
ty created by a college education a positive or a negative 
externality? What does this imply about the differences 
between the costs and benefits to students compared to 
social costs and benefits? What are some reasons for 
the differences?
 6. The city of Falls Church, Virginia, subsidizes trees 
planted in homeowners’ front yards when they are 
within 15 feet of the street.
 a. Using concepts in the chapter, explain why a munici-
pality would subsidize trees planted on private prop-
erty, but near the street.
 b. Draw a diagram similar to Figure 16-4 that shows 
the marginal social benefit, the marginal social cost, 
and the optimal Pigouvian subsidy on trees. 
 7. Fishing for sablefish has been so intensive that sablefish 
were threatened with extinction. After several years of 
banning such fishing, the government is now proposing 
to introduce tradable vouchers, each of which entitles 
its holder to a catch of a certain size. Explain how 
fishing generates a negative externality and how the 
voucher scheme may overcome the inefficiency created 
by this externality.

 8. The two dry-cleaning companies in Collegetown, 
College Cleaners and Big Green Cleaners, are a major 
source of air pollution. Together they currently produce 
350 units of air pollution, which the town wants to 
reduce to 200 units. The accompanying table shows the 
current pollution level produced by each company and 
each company’s marginal cost of reducing its pollution. 
The marginal cost is constant.

a. Suppose that Collegetown passes an environmental 
standards law that limits each company to 100 units 
of pollution. What would be the total cost to the two 
companies of each reducing its pollution emissions 
to 100 units?
Suppose instead that Collegetown issues 100 pollution 
vouchers to each company, each entitling the company 
to one unit of pollution, and that these vouchers can be 
traded.
b. How much is each pollution voucher worth to 
College Cleaners? To Big Green Cleaners? (That is, 
how much would each company, at most, be willing 
to pay for one more voucher?)
c. Who will sell vouchers and who will buy them? How 
many vouchers will be traded?
d. What is the total cost to the two companies of the 
pollution controls under this voucher system?
9. a.  EAuction and EMarketplace are two competing 
Internet auction sites, where buyers and sellers 
transact goods. Each auction site earns money by 
charging sellers for listing their goods. EAuction has 
decided to eliminate fees for the first transaction for 
sellers that are new to its site. Explain why this is 
likely to be a good strategy for EAuction in its com-
petition with EMarketplace.
b. EMarketplace complained to the Justice Department 
that EAuction’s practice of eliminating fees for 
new sellers was anti-competitive and would lead to 
monopolization of the Internet auction industry. 
Is EMarketplace correct? How should the Justice 
Department respond?
c. EAuction stopped its practice of eliminating fees 
for new sellers. But since it provided much better 
technical service than its rival, EMarketplace, buy-
ers and sellers came to prefer EAuction. Eventually, 
EMarketplace closed down, leaving EAuction 
as a monopolist. Should the Justice Department 
intervene to break EAuction into two companies? 
Explain.
d. EAuction is now a monopolist in the Internet auc-
tion industry. It also owns a site that handles 
payments over the Internet, called PayForIt. It is 
competing with another Internet payment site, 
called PayBuddy. EAuction has now stipulated 
that any transaction on its auction site must use 
PayForIt, rather than PayBuddy, for the payment. 
Should the Justice Department intervene? Explain.
10. Which of the following are characterized by network 
externalities? Which are not? Explain.
a. The choice between installing 110-volt electrical cur-
rent in structures rather than 220-volt
b. The choice between purchasing a Toyota versus a 
Ford
c. The choice of a printer, where each printer requires 
its own specific type of ink cartridge
d. The choice of whether to purchase an iPod Touch or 
an iPod Nano.

Y THE MIDDLE OF THE NINE-
teenth century, London had become 
the world’s largest city, with close to 
2.5 million inhabitants. Unfortunately, all 
those people produced a lot of waste—
and there was no place for it to go except 
into the Thames, the river flowing through 
the city. Nobody with a working nose 
could ignore the results. And the river 
didn’t just smell bad—it carried danger-
ous waterborne diseases like cholera and 
typhoid. London neighborhoods close to 
the Thames had death rates from cholera 
more than six times greater than the 
neighborhoods farthest away. And the 
great majority of Londoners drew their 
drinking water from the Thames.
What the city needed, said reformers, 
was a sewage system that would carry 
waste away from the river. Yet no private 
individual was willing to build such a sys-
tem, and influential people were opposed 
to the idea that the government should 
take responsibility for the problem. For 
example, the magazine The Economist
weighed in against proposals for a 
government - built sewage system, declar-
ing that “suffering and evil are nature’s 
admonitions—they cannot be got rid of.”
But the hot summer of 1858 brought 
what came to be known as the Great 
Stink, which was so bad that one health 
journal reported “men struck down with 
the stench.” Even the privileged and 
powerful suffered: Parliament met in a 
building next to the river. After unsuc-
cessful efforts to stop the smell by cover-
ing the windows with chemical - soaked 
curtains, Parliament finally approved a 
plan for an immense system of sewers 
and pumping stations to direct sewage 
away from the city.
The system, opened in 1865, brought 
dramatic improvement in the city’s qual-
ity of life; cholera and typhoid epidemics, 
which had been regular occurrences, 
completely disappeared. The Thames 
was turned from the filthiest to the 
cleanest metropolitan river in the world, 
and the sewage system’s principal engi-
neer, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, was lauded 
as having “saved more lives than any 
single Victorian public official.” It was 
estimated at the time that Bazalgette’s 
sewer system added 20 years to the life 
span of the average Londoner.
The story of the Great Stink and the 
policy response that followed illustrate 
two important reasons for government 
intervention in the economy. London’s 
new sewage system was a clear exam-
ple of a public good—a good that ben-
efits many people, whether or not they 
have paid for it, and whose benefits to 
any one individual do not depend on 
how many others also benefit. As we 
will see shortly, public goods differ in 
important ways from the private goods
we have studied so far—and these dif-
ferences mean that public goods cannot 
be efficiently supplied by the market.
In addition, clean water in the 
Thames is an example of a common 
resource, a good that many people can 
consume whether or not they have paid 
for it but whose consumption by each 
person reduces the amount available to 
others. Such goods tend to be overused 
by individuals in a market system unless 
the government takes action.
In earlier chapters, we saw that mar-
kets sometimes fail to deliver efficient 
levels of production and consumption of a 
good or activity. We saw how inefficiency 
can arise from market power, which allows 
monopolists and colluding oligopolists to 
charge prices that are higher than mar-
ginal cost, thereby preventing mutually

Private Goods—And Others
W
hat’s the difference between installing a new bathroom in a house and 
building a municipal sewage system? What’s the difference between 
growing wheat and fishing in the open ocean?
These aren’t trick questions. In each case there is a basic difference in the 
characteristics of the goods involved. Bathroom fixtures and wheat have the char-
acteristics necessary to allow markets to work efficiently. Public sewage systems 
and fish in the sea do not.
Let’s look at these crucial characteristics and why they matter.
Characteristics of Goods
Goods like bathroom fixtures or wheat have two characteristics that, as we’ll 
soon see, are essential if a good is to be efficiently provided by a market economy.
 • They are excludable: suppliers of the good can prevent people who don’t pay 
from consuming it.
 • They are rival in consumption: the same unit of the good cannot be con-
sumed by more than one person at the same time.
When a good is both excludable and rival in consumption, it is called a pri-
vate good. Wheat is an example of a private good. It is excludable: the farmer can 
sell a bushel to one consumer without having to provide wheat to everyone in the 
county. And it is rival in consumption: if I eat bread baked with a farmer’s wheat, 
that wheat cannot be consumed by someone else.
But not all goods possess these two characteristics. Some goods are nonex-
cludable—the supplier cannot prevent consumption of the good by people who do 
not pay for it. Fire protection is one example: a 
fire department that puts out fires before they 
spread protects the whole city, not just people 
who have made contributions to the Firemen’s 
Benevolent Association. An improved environ-
ment is another: the city of London couldn’t 
have ended the Great Stink for some residents 
while leaving the river Thames foul for others.
Nor are all goods rival in consumption. 
Goods are nonrival in consumption if more 
than one person can consume the same unit 
of the good at the same time. TV programs 
are nonrival in consumption: your decision to 
watch a show does not prevent other people 
from watching the same show.
Because goods can be either excludable or 
nonexcludable, rival or nonrival in consump-
tion, there are four types of goods, illustrated by 
the matrix in Figure 17-1:
A good is excludable if the supplier 
of that good can prevent people who 
do not pay from consuming it.
A good is rival in consumption if 
the same unit of the good cannot be 
consumed by more than one person 
at the same time.
A good that is both excludable and 
rival in consumption is a private 
good.
When a good is nonexcludable, 
the supplier cannot prevent 
consumption by people who do not 
pay for it.
A good is nonrival in 
consumption if more than one 
person can consume the same unit 
of the good at the same time.
beneficial transactions from occurring. We 
also saw how inefficiency can arise from 
positive and negative externalities, which 
cause a divergence between the costs and 
benefits of an individual’s or industry’s 
actions and the costs and benefits of those 
actions borne by society as a whole.
In this chapter, we will take a some-
what different approach to the question 
of why markets sometimes fail. Here we 
focus on how the characteristics of goods 
often determine whether markets can 
deliver them efficiently. When goods have 
the “wrong” characteristics, the resulting 
market failures resemble those associ-
ated with externalities or market power. 
This alternative way of looking at sources 
of inefficiency deepens our understand-
ing of why markets sometimes don’t 
work well and how government can take 
actions that increase society’s welfare. 
Four Types of Goods
17-1
There are four types of goods. The type of a good depends on 
(1) whether or not it is excludable—whether a producer can prevent 
someone from consuming it; and (2) whether or not it is rival in con-
sumption—whether it is impossible for the same unit of a good to be 
consumed by more than one person at the same time.

 • Private goods, which are excludable and rival in consumption, like wheat
 • Public goods, which are nonexcludable and nonrival in consumption, like a 
public sewer system
 • Common resources, which are nonexcludable but rival in consumption, like 
clean water in a river
 • Artificially scarce goods, which are excludable but nonrival in consumption, 
like on-demand movies on DirecTV
There are, of course, many other characteristics that distinguish between 
types of goods—necessities versus luxuries, normal versus inferior, and so on. 
Why focus on whether goods are excludable and rival in consumption?
Why Markets Can Supply Only Private Goods Efficiently
As we learned in earlier chapters, markets are typically the best means for a 
society to deliver goods and services to its members; that is, markets are efficient 
except in the case of the well - defined problems of market power, externalities, or 
other instances of market failure. But there is yet another condition that must 
be met, one rooted in the nature of the good itself: markets cannot supply goods 
and services efficiently unless they are private goods—excludable and rival in 
consumption.
To see why excludability is crucial, suppose that a farmer had only two choic-
es: either produce no wheat or provide a bushel of wheat to every resident of the 
county who wants it, whether or not that resident pays for it. It seems unlikely 
that anyone would grow wheat under those conditions.
Yet the operator of a municipal sewage system faces pretty much the 
same problem as our hypothetical farmer. A sewage system makes 
the whole city cleaner and healthier—but that benefit accrues to 
all the city’s residents, whether or not they pay the system operator. 
That’s why no private entrepreneur came forward with a plan to end 
London’s Great Stink.
The general point is that if a good is nonexcludable, self-interested 
consumers won’t be willing to pay for it—they will take a “free ride” 
on anyone who does pay. So there is a free - rider problem. Examples 
of the free - rider problem are familiar from daily life. One example 
you may have encountered happens when students are required to do 
a group project. There is often a tendency of some group members to 
shirk, relying on others in the group to get the work done. The shirkers 
free - ride on someone else’s effort.
Because of the free - rider problem, the forces of self - interest alone 
do not lead to an efficient level of production for a nonexcludable good. 
Even though consumers would benefit from increased production of the 
good, no one individual is willing to pay for more, and so no producer is 
willing to supply it. The result is that nonexcludable goods suffer from 
inefficiently low production in a market economy. In fact, in the face of 
the free - rider problem, self - interest may not ensure that any amount of 
the good—let alone the efficient quantity—is produced.
Goods that are excludable and nonrival in consumption, like on-
demand movies, suffer from a different kind of inefficiency. As long as 
a good is excludable, it is possible to earn a profit by making it available 
only to those who pay. Therefore, producers are willing to supply an 
excludable good. But the marginal cost of letting an additional viewer 
watch an on-demand movie is zero because it is nonrival in consump-
tion. So the efficient price to the consumer is also zero—or, to put it 
another way, individuals should watch movies up to the point where 
their marginal benefit is zero.
Goods that are nonexcludable suffer 
from the free - rider problem: many 
individuals are unwilling to pay for 
their own consumption and instead 
will take a “free ride” on anyone who 
does pay.
PITFALLS
MARGINAL COST OF WHAT EXACTLY?
In the case of a good that is nonrival in 
consumption, it’s easy to confuse the mar-
ginal cost of producing a unit of the good 
with the marginal cost of allowing a unit 
of the good to be consumed. For example, 
DirecTV incurs a marginal cost in making 
a movie available to its subscribers that 
is equal to the cost of the resources it 
uses to produce and broadcast that movie. 
However, once that movie is being broad-
cast, no marginal cost is incurred by let-
ting an additional family watch it. In other 
words, no costly resources are “used up” 
when one more family consumes a movie 
that has already been produced and is 
being broadcast.
This complication does not arise, how-
ever, when a good is rival in consumption. 
In that case, the resources used to pro-
duce a unit of the good are “used up” by 
a person’s consumption of it—they are no 
longer available to satisfy someone else’s 
consumption. So when a good is rival in 
consumption, the marginal cost to society 
of allowing an individual to consume a unit 
is equal to the resource cost of producing 
that unit—that is, equal to the marginal cost 
of producing it.

But if DirecTV actually charges viewers $4, viewers will consume the good 
only up to the point where their marginal benefit is $4. When consumers must 
pay a price greater than zero for a good that is nonrival in consumption, the 
price they pay is higher than the marginal cost of allowing them to consume 
that good, which is zero. So in a market economy goods that are nonrival in 
consumption suffer from inefficiently low consumption.
Now we can see why private goods are the only goods that can be effi-
ciently produced and consumed in a competitive market. (That is, a private 
good will be efficiently produced and consumed in a market free of market 
power, externalities, or other instances of market failure.) Because private 
goods are excludable, producers can charge for them and so have an incen-
tive to produce them. And because they are also rival in consumption, it is 
efficient for consumers to pay a positive price—a price equal to the mar-
ginal cost of production. If one or both of these characteristics are lacking, 
a market economy will not lead to efficient production and consumption of 
the good.
Fortunately for the market system, most goods are private goods. Food, cloth-
ing, shelter, and most other desirable things in life are excludable and rival in 
consumption, so markets can provide us with most things. Yet there are crucial 
goods that don’t meet these criteria—and in most cases, that means that the gov-
ernment must step in.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
FROM MAYHEM TO RENAISSANCE
L
ife during the European Middle Ages—from approximately 1100 to 1500—
was difficult and dangerous, with high rates of violent crime, banditry, and 
war casualties. According to researchers, murder rates in Europe in 1200 were 
30 to 40 per 100,000 people. But by 1500 the rate had been halved to around 
20 per 100,000; today, it is less than 1 per 100,000. What accounts for the sharp 
decrease in mayhem over the last 900 years? 
Think public goods, as the history of medieval Italian city-states 
illustrates.
Starting around the year 900 in Venice and 1100 in other 
city-states like Milan and Florence, citizens began to organize 
and create institutions for protection. In Venice, citizens built 
a defensive fleet to battle the pirates and other marauders who 
regularly attacked them. Other city-states built strong defensive 
walls to encircle their cities and also paid defensive militias. 
Institutions were created to maintain law and order: cadres of 
guards watchmen, and magistrates were hired; courthouses and 
jails were built. 
As a result, trade, commerce, and banking were able to flourish, as 
well as literacy, numeracy, and the arts. By 1300, the leading cities of 
Venice, Milan, and Florence had each grown to over 100,000 people. 
As resources and the standard of living increased, the rate of violent 
deaths diminished. 
For example, the Republic of Venice was known as La 
Serenissima—the most serene one—because of its enlightened 
governance, overseen by a council of leading citizens. Owing to its 
stability, diplomatic prowess, and prodigious fleet of vessels, Venice 
became enormously wealthy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
Also through stability, high literacy, and numeracy, Florence 
became the banking center of Italy. During the fifteenth century 
it was ruled by the Medici, an immensely wealthy banking family. 
The emergence of institutions to maintain law and
order—public goods—allowed for a move away from 
the war and brutality that marked the Middle Ages
and toward a new era.

And it was the patronage of the Medici to artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and 
Michelangelo that ushered in the Renaissance.
So Western Europe was able to move from mayhem to Renaissance 
through the creation of public goods like good governance and defense—
goods that benefited everyone and could not be diminished by any one per-
son’s use.

Public Goods
A 
public good is the exact opposite of a private good: it is a good that is both 
nonexcludable and nonrival in consumption. A public sewer system is an 
example of a public good: you can’t keep a river clean without making it 
clean for everyone who lives near its banks, and my protection from great stinks 
does not come at my neighbor’s expense.
Here are some other examples of public goods:
 • Disease prevention. When doctors act to stamp out the beginnings of an epi-
demic before it can spread, they protect people around the world.
 • National defense. A strong military protects all citizens.
 • Scientific research. More knowledge benefits everyone.
Because these goods are nonexcludable, they suffer from the free - rider 
problem, so no private firm would be willing to produce them. And because 
they are nonrival in consumption, it would be inefficient to charge people for 
consuming them. As a result, society must find nonmarket methods for provid-
ing these goods.
Providing Public Goods
Public goods are provided through a variety of means. The government doesn’t 
always get involved—in many cases a non governmental solution has been found 
for the free- rider problem. But these solutions are usually imperfect in some way.
Some public goods are supplied through voluntary contributions. For exam-
ple, private donations support a considerable amount of scientific research. But 
private donations are insufficient to finance huge, socially important projects like 
basic medical research.
Some public goods are supplied by self - interested individuals or firms 
because those who produce them are able to make money in an indirect way. 
The classic example is broadcast television, which in the United States is sup-
ported entirely by advertising. The downside of such indirect funding is that it 
skews the nature and quantity of the public goods that are supplied, as well as 
imposing additional costs on consumers. TV stations show the programs that 
 Quick Review
• Goods can be classified according 
to two attributes: whether they are 
excludable and whether they are 
rival in consumption.
• Goods that are both excludable and 
rival in consumption are private 
goods. Private goods can be effi-
ciently produced and consumed in 
a competitive market.
• When goods are nonexcludable, 
there is a free - rider problem: con-
sumers will not pay producers, lead-
ing to inefficiently low production.
• When goods are nonrival in con-
sumption, the efficient price for 
consumption is zero. But if a positive 
price is charged to compensate pro-
ducers for the cost of production, the 
result is inefficiently low consumption.
A public good is both 
nonexcludable and nonrival in 
consumption.

yield the most advertising revenue (that is, programs best suited 
for selling prescription drugs, hair - loss remedies, antihistamines, 
and the like to the segment of the population that buys them), 
which are not necessarily the programs people most want to see. 
And viewers must also endure many commercials.
Some potentially public goods are deliberately made excludable 
and therefore subject to charge, like on-demand movies. In the 
United Kingdom, where most television programming is paid for 
by a yearly license fee assessed on every television owner (£145.50, 
or about $233 in 2011), television viewing is made artificially 
excludable by the use of “television detection vans”: vans that roam 
neighborhoods in an attempt to detect televisions in nonlicensed 
households and fine them. However, as noted earlier, when suppli-
ers charge a price greater than zero for a nonrival good, consumers 
will consume an inefficiently low quantity of that good.
In small communities, a high level of social encouragement or 
pressure can be brought to bear on people to contribute money or time to provide 
the efficient level of a public good. Volunteer fire departments, which depend 
both on the volunteered services of the firefighters themselves and on contribu-
tions from local residents, are a good example. But as communities grow larger 
and more anonymous, social pressure is increasingly difficult to apply, compel-
ling larger towns and cities to tax residents to provide salaried firefighters for fire 
protection services.
As this last example suggests, when these other solutions fail, it is up to 
the government to provide public goods. Indeed, the most important public 
goods—national defense, the legal system, disease control, fire protection in 
large cities, and so on—are provided by government and paid for by taxes. 
Economic theory tells us that the provision of public goods is one of the cru-
cial roles of government.
How Much of a Public Good Should Be Provided?
In some cases, provision of a public good is an “either–or” decision: London 
would either have a sewage system—or not. But in most cases, governments 
must decide not only whether to provide a public good but also how much of 
that public good to provide. For example, street cleaning is a public good—but 
how often should the streets be cleaned? Once a month? Twice a month? Every 
other day?
Imagine a city in which there are only two residents, Ted and Alice. Assume 
that the public good in question is street cleaning and that Ted and Alice truth-
fully tell the government how much they value a unit of the public good, where 
a unit is equal to one street cleaning per month. Specifically, each of them tells 
the government his or her willingness to pay for another unit of the public good 
supplied—an amount that corresponds to that individual’s marginal benefit of 
another unit of the public good.
Using this information plus information on the cost of providing the good, 
the government can use marginal analysis to find the efficient level of providing 
the public good: the level at which the marginal social benefit of the public good 
is equal to the marginal cost of producing it. Recall from Chapter 16 that the 
marginal social benefit of a good is the benefit that accrues to society as a whole 
from the consumption of one additional unit of the good.
But what is the marginal social benefit of another unit of a public good—a 
unit that generates utility for all consumers, not just one consumer, because it is 
nonexcludable and nonrival in consumption? This question leads us to an impor-
tant principle: In the special case of a public good, the marginal social benefit of 
a unit of the good is equal to the sum of the individual marginal benefits that are

enjoyed by all consumers of that unit. Or to consider it from a slightly different 
angle, if a consumer could be compelled to pay for a unit before consuming it (the 
good is made excludable), then the marginal social benefit of a unit is equal to 
the sum of each consumer’s willingness to pay for that unit. Using this principle, 
the marginal social benefit of an additional street cleaning per month is equal 
to Ted’s individual marginal benefit from that additional cleaning plus Alice’s 
individual marginal benefit.
Why? Because a public good is nonrival in consumption—Ted’s benefit from a 
cleaner street does not diminish Alice’s benefit from that same clean street, and 
vice versa. Because people can all simultaneously consume the same unit of a 
public good, the marginal social benefit of an additional unit of that good is the 
sum of the individual marginal benefits of all who enjoy the public good. And the 
efficient quantity of a public good is the quantity at which the marginal social 
benefit is equal to the marginal cost of providing it.
Figure 17-2 illustrates the efficient provision of a public good, showing three 
marginal benefit curves. Panel (a) shows Ted’s individual marginal benefit curve 
from street cleaning, MBT: he would be willing to pay $25 for the city to clean 
its streets once a month, an additional $18 to have it done a second time, and so 
on. Panel (b) shows Alice’s individual marginal benefit curve from street clean-
ing, MBA. Panel (c) shows the marginal social benefit curve from street cleaning, 
MSB: it is the vertical sum of Ted’s and Alice’s individual marginal benefit curves, 
MBT and MBA.
To maximize society’s welfare, the government should clean the street up 
to the level at which the marginal social benefit of an additional cleaning is 
no longer greater than the marginal cost. Suppose that the marginal cost of 
street cleaning is $6 per cleaning. Then the city should clean its streets 5 times 
per month, because the marginal social benefit of going from 4 to 5 cleanings 
is $8, but going from 5 to 6 cleanings would yield a marginal social benefit of 
only $2.
Figure 17-2 can help reinforce our understanding of why we cannot rely on 
individual self - interest to yield provision of an efficient quantity of public goods. 
Suppose that the city did one fewer street cleaning than the efficient quantity and 
that either Ted or Alice was asked to pay for the last cleaning. Neither one would 
be willing to pay for it! Ted would personally gain only the equivalent of $3 in 
utility from adding one more street cleaning—so he wouldn’t be willing to pay the 
$6 marginal cost of another cleaning. Alice would personally gain the equivalent 
of $5 in utility—so she wouldn’t be willing to pay either. The point is that the 
marginal social benefit of one more unit of a public good is always greater than 
the individual marginal benefit to any one individual. That is why no individual 
is willing to pay for the efficient quantity of the good.
Does this description of the public-good problem, in which the marginal 
social benefit of an additional unit of the public good is greater than any indi-
vidual’s marginal benefit, sound a bit familiar? It should: we encountered a 
somewhat similar situation in our discussion of positive externalities. Remember 
that in the case of a positive externality, the marginal social benefit accruing 
to all consumers of another unit of the good is greater than the price that the 
producer receives for that unit; as a result, the market produces too little of 
the good. In the case of a public good, the individual marginal benefit of a 
consumer plays the same role as the price received by the producer in the case 
of positive externalities: both cases create insufficient incentive to provide an 
efficient amount of the good.
The problem of providing public goods is very similar to the problem of deal-
ing with positive externalities; in both cases there is a market failure that calls 
for government intervention. One basic rationale for the existence of government 
is that it provides a way for citizens to tax themselves in order to provide public 
goods—particularly a vital public good like national defense.

Of course, if society really consisted of only two individuals, they would prob-
ably manage to strike a deal to provide the good. But imagine a city with a mil-
lion residents, each of whose individual marginal benefit from provision of the 
good is only a tiny fraction of the marginal social benefit. It would be impossible 
for people to reach a voluntary agreement to pay for the efficient level of street 
cleaning—the potential for free - riding makes it too difficult to make and enforce 
an agreement among so many people. But they could and would vote to tax them-
selves to pay for a citywide sanitation department.

Despite the fact that it can be an entirely rational choice 
not to vote, many countries consistently achieve aston-
ishingly high turnout rates in their elections by adopting 
policies that encourage voting. In Belgium, Singapore, 
and Australia, voting is compulsory; eligible voters are 
penalized if they fail to do their civic duty by casting 
their ballots. These penalties are effective at getting 
out the vote. When Venezuela dropped its mandatory 
voting requirement, the turnout rate dropped 30%; 
when the Netherlands did the same, there was a 20% 
drop-off.
Other countries 
have policies that 
reduce the cost of 
voting; for example, 
declaring election 
day a work holiday 
(giving citizens ample 
time to cast their 
ballots), allowing 
voter registration on 
election day (elimi-
nating the need for 
advance planning), 
and permitting voting 
by mail (increasing 
convenience).
This figure shows turnout rates in several countries, 
measured as the percentage of eligible voters who cast 
ballots, averaged over elections held between 1945 and 
2008. As you can see, Singapore, Australia, and Belgium 
have the highest voter turnout rates. The United States, 
however, performs poorly: it has the lowest turnout rate 
among advanced countries. In general, the past four 
decades have seen a decline in voter turnout rates in the 
major democracies, most dramatically among the young-
est voters.

It’s a sad fact that many Americans who 
are eligible to vote don’t bother to. As a 
result, their interests tend to be ignored 
by politicians. But what’s even sadder is 
that this self - defeating behavior may be 
completely rational.
As the economist Mancur Olson 
pointed out in a famous book titled 
The Logic of Collective Action, voting 
is a public good, one that suffers from 
severe free - rider problems.
Imagine that you are one of a million 
people who would stand to gain the 
equivalent of $100 each if some plan 
is passed in a statewide referendum—
say, a plan to improve public schools. 
And suppose that the opportunity 
cost of the time it would take you to 
vote is $10. Will you be sure to go to 
the polls and vote for the referendum? 
If you are rational, the answer is no! 
The reason is that it is very unlikely 
that your vote will decide the issue, 
either way. If the measure passes, you 
benefit, even if you didn’t bother to 
vote—the benefits are nonexcludable. 
If the measure doesn’t pass, your 
vote would not have changed the out-
come. Either way, by not voting—by 
free - riding on those who do vote—you 
save $10.
Of course, many people do vote 
out of a sense of civic duty. But 
because political action is a public 
good, in general people devote too 
little effort to defending their own 
interests.
The result, Olson pointed out, is 
that when a large group of people 
share a common political interest, 
they are likely to exert too little effort 
promoting their cause and so will 
be ignored. Conversely, small, well - 
organized interest groups that act on 
issues narrowly targeted in their favor 
tend to have disproportionate power.
Is this a reason to distrust democ-
racy? Winston Churchill said it best: 
“Democracy is the worst form of govern-
ment, except for all the other forms that 
have been tried.”

Cost - Benefit Analysis
How do governments decide in practice how much of a public good to provide? 
Sometimes policy makers just guess—or do whatever they think will get them 
reelected. However, responsible governments try to estimate and compare both 
the social benefits and the social costs of providing a public good, a process 
known as cost - benefit analysis.
It’s straightforward to estimate the cost of supplying a public good. Estimating 
the benefit is harder. In fact, it is a very difficult problem.
Now you might wonder why governments can’t figure out the marginal social 
benefit of a public good just by asking people their willingness to pay for it (their 
individual marginal benefit). But it turns out that it’s hard to get an honest 
answer.
This is not a problem with private goods: we can determine how much an 
individual is willing to pay for one more unit of a private good by looking at his 
or her actual choices. But because people don’t actually pay for public goods, the 
question of willingness to pay is always hypothetical.
Worse yet, it’s a question that people have an incentive not to answer truthful-
ly. People naturally want more rather than less. Because they cannot be made to 
pay for whatever quantity of the public good they use, people are apt to overstate 
their true feelings when asked how much they desire a public good. For example, 
if street cleaning were scheduled according to the stated wishes of homeowners 
alone, the streets would be cleaned every day—an inefficient level of provision.
So governments must be aware that they cannot simply rely on the public’s 
statements when deciding how much of a public good to provide—if they do, they 
are likely to provide too much. In contrast, as For Inquiring Minds in the pre-
ceding section explains, relying on the public to indicate how much of the public 
good they want through voting has problems as well—and is likely to lead to too 
little of the public good being provided.

OLD MAN RIVER
I
t just keeps rolling along—but now and then it decides to roll in a different 
direction. In fact, the Mississippi River changes its course every few hundred 
years. Sediment carried downstream gradually clogs the river’s route to the sea, 
and eventually the river breaches its banks and opens a new channel. Over the 
millennia, the mouth of the Mississippi has swung back and forth along an arc 
some 200 miles wide.
So when is the Mississippi due to change course again? Oh, 
about 40 years ago.
The Mississippi currently runs to the sea past New Orleans; but 
by 1950 it was apparent that the river was about to shift course, 
taking a new route to the sea. If the Army Corps of Engineers 
hadn’t gotten involved, the shift would probably have happened 
by 1970.
A shift in the Mississippi would have severely damaged the 
Louisiana economy. A major industrial area would have lost good 
access to the ocean, and salt water would have contaminated much 
of its water supply. So the Army Corps of Engineers has kept the 
Mississippi in its place with a huge complex of dams, walls, and 
gates known as the Old River Control Structure. At times the 
amount of water released by this control structure is five times the 
flow at Niagara Falls.
The Old River Control Structure is a dramatic example of 
a public good. No individual would have had an incentive to 
Cost- benefit analysis is the 
estimation and comparison of the 
social costs and social benefits of 
providing a public good.
The Old River Control Structure helps to keep the 
Mississippi on course.

build it, yet it protects many billions of dollars’ worth of private property. 
The history of the Army Corps of Engineers, which handles water - control 
projects across the United States, illustrates a persistent problem associated 
with government provision of public goods. That is, everyone wants a proj-
ect that benefits his or her own property—if other people are going to pay 
for it. So there is a systematic tendency for potential beneficiaries of Corps 
projects to overstate the benefits. And the Corps has become notorious for 
undertaking expensive projects that cannot be justified with any reasonable 
cost - benefit analysis.
The flip-side of the problem of overfunding of public projects is chronic 
underfunding. A tragic illustration of this problem was the devastation of New 
Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Although it was well understood from the time of its founding that New 
Orleans was at risk for severe flooding because it sits below sea level, very little 
was done to shore up the crucial system of levees and pumps that protects the 
city. More than 50 years of inadequate funding for construction and mainte-
nance, coupled with inadequate supervision, left the system weakened and unable 
to cope with the onslaught from Katrina. The catastrophe was compounded by 
the failure of local and state government to develop an evacuation plan in the 
event of a hurricane. In the end, because of this neglect of a public good, 1,464 
people in and around New Orleans lost their lives and the city suffered economic 
losses totaling billions of dollars.

Common Resources
A 
common resource is a good that is nonexcludable but is rival in consump-
tion. An example is the stock of fish in a limited fishing area, like the fisher-
ies off the coast of New England. Traditionally, anyone who had a boat could 
go out to sea and catch fish—fish in the sea were a nonexcludable good. Yet because 
the total number of fish is limited, the fish that one person catches are no longer 
available to be caught by someone else. So fish in the sea are rival in consumption.
 Quick Review
• A public good is both nonexclud-
able and nonrival in consumption.
• Because most forms of public-good 
provision by the private sector have 
serious defects, they are typically 
provided by the government and 
paid for with taxes.
• The marginal social benefit of an 
additional unit of a public good is 
equal to the sum of each consumer’s 
individual marginal benefit from that 
unit. At the efficient quantity, the 
marginal social benefit equals the 
marginal cost of providing the good.
• No individual has an incentive to 
pay for providing the efficient quan-
tity of a public good because each 
individual’s marginal benefit is less 
than the marginal social benefit. 
This is a primary justification for the 
existence of government.
• Although governments should rely 
on cost - benefit analysis to deter-
mine how much of a public good 
to supply, doing so is problematic 
because individuals tend to over-
state the good’s value to them.

A common resource is 
nonexcludable and rival in 
consumption: you can’t stop me 
from consuming the good, and more 
consumption by me means less of 
the good available for you.

Other examples of common resources are clean air and water as well as the 
diversity of animal and plant species on the planet (biodiversity). In each of these 
cases the fact that the good, though rival in consumption, is nonexcludable poses 
a serious problem.
The Problem of Overuse
Because common resources are nonexcludable, individuals cannot be charged 
for their use. Yet because they are rival in consumption, an individual who 
uses a unit depletes the resource by making that unit unavailable to others. 
As a result, a common resource is subject to overuse: an individual will con-
tinue to use it until his or her marginal benefit of its use is equal to his or her 
own individual marginal cost, ignoring the cost that this action inflicts on 
society as a whole. As we will see shortly, the problem of overuse of a common 
resource is similar to a problem we studied in Chapter 16: the problem of a 
good that generates a negative externality, such as pollution - creating electric-
ity generation.
Fishing is a classic example of a common resource. In heavily fished waters, 
my fishing imposes a cost on others by reducing the fish population and mak-
ing it harder for others to catch fish. But I have no personal incentive to take 
this cost into account, since I cannot be charged for fishing. As a result, from 
society’s point of view, I catch too many fish. Traffic congestion is another 
example of overuse of a common resource. A major highway during rush hour 
can accommodate only a certain number of vehicles per hour. If I decide to 
drive to work alone rather than carpool or work at home, I make the commute 
of many other people a bit longer; but I have no incentive to take these conse-
quences into account.
In the case of a common resource, the marginal social cost of my use of that 
resource is higher than my individual marginal cost, the cost to me of using an 
additional unit of the good.
Figure 17-3 illustrates the point. It shows the demand curve for fish, 
which measures the marginal benefit of fish—the benefit to consumers when 
an additional unit of fish is caught and consumed. It also shows the supply 
A Common Resource
17-3
The supply curve S, which shows the marginal cost of pro-
duction of the fishing industry, is composed of the individual 
supply curves of the individual fishermen. But each fisher-
man’s individual marginal cost does not include the cost 
that his or her actions impose on others: the depletion of the 
common resource. As a result, the marginal social cost curve, 
MSC, lies above the supply curve; in an unregulated market, 
the quantity of the common resource used, QMKT, exceeds 
the efficient quantity of use, QOPT.

curve for fish, which measures the marginal cost of production of the fish-
ing industry. We know from Chapter 12 that the industry supply curve is the 
horizontal sum of each individual fisherman’s supply curve—equivalent to 
his or her individual marginal cost curve. The fishing industry supplies the 
quantity where its marginal cost is equal to the price, the quantity QMKT. But 
the efficient outcome is to catch the quantity QOPT, the quantity of output that 
equates the marginal benefit to the marginal social cost, not to the fishing 
industry’s marginal cost of production. The market outcome results in overuse 
of the common resource.
As we noted, there is a close parallel between the problem of managing a 
common resource and the problem posed by negative externalities. In the case of 
an activity that generates a negative externality, the marginal social cost of pro-
duction is greater than the industry’s marginal cost of production, the difference 
being the marginal external cost imposed on society. Here, the loss to society aris-
ing from a fisherman’s depletion of the common resource plays the same role as 
the external cost plays when there is a negative externality. In fact, many negative 
externalities (such as pollution) can be thought of as involving common resources 
(such as clean air).

What do water bottlers owe the citizens of Maine for 
extracting and selling a valuable common resource?
FOR INQUIRING MINDS
A WATER FIGHT IN MAINE 
F
In the eyes of many, Maine is a 
natural paradise at the forefront 
of environmentalism. The state 
has adopted strict guidelines 
to protect its beautiful ponds, 
forests, and wildlife. But since 
2004, Mainers have been 
engaged in a fierce battle over 
one of their natural resources: 
groundwater. 
Maine’s groundwater, or natu-
ral water, is a valuable commod-
ity as drinking water, long prized 
for its purity and taste. And 
bottled water is big business—
everyone has encountered 
Poland Spring Water of Maine, 
whose bottles can be found in 
stores across America. 
In Maine, the principle of 
“capture” defines the ownership 
of water: a property owner can pump 
any amount of groundwater without 
regard to the effect on the under-
ground aquifer, the naturally occurring 
underground reservoir of an area’s 
water. This situation presented no 
problem when water was drawn only 
to satisfy local demand because there 
was plenty of water available to satisfy 
Mainers’ needs. 
But with big companies like Poland 
Spring extracting groundwater to 
of Maine. Why shouldn’t they 
revoke the principle of capture 
and receive some compensa-
tion from bottlers for the sale of 
their water? They point to the 
example of Alaska, with its huge 
oil reserves, where the state gov-
ernment imposes a 22.5% tax on 
oil company profits. Tax revenues 
are distributed to Alaska resi-
dents in the form of greater ser-
vices and lower taxes (and even 
subsidies). The water bottlers 
counter that the property taxes 
and wages that they already pay 
bring millions of dollars into the 
Maine economy.
The debate over groundwater 
came to a head when a state wide 
referendum regulating ground-
water usage and imposing a $0.19 
per gallon tax on large water bottlers 
failed due to technicalities. But sup-
porters of the referendum have contin-
ued the fight on the local level, with 
several towns refusing to allow the 
expansion of water extraction and 
bottling in their water districts. 
Poland Spring and Nestlé, its parent 
company, have also recently run into 
opposition to their water-extraction 
plans in Michigan, Massachusetts, 
and Oregon.
satisfy the demands of millions of 
customers across the country, some 
Mainers fear that they can no longer 
afford this policy. 
The concerns expressed over com-
mercial water extraction are two fold. 
One is the problem of managing a 
common resource. Without over-
sight, what prevents water bottlers 
from overdrawing Maine’s aquifer, 
leaving too little water for its resi-
dents? Second, by law the under-
ground aquifer belongs to the people

The Efficient Use and Maintenance of a 
Common Resource
Because common resources pose problems similar to those created by negative exter-
nalities, the solutions are also similar. To ensure efficient use of a common resource, 
society must find a way of getting individual users of the resource to take into account 
the costs they impose on other users. This is basically the same principle as that of 
getting individuals to internalize a negative externality that arises from their actions.
There are three fundamental ways to induce people who use common resources 
to internalize the costs they impose on others.
 • Tax or otherwise regulate the use of the common resource
 • Create a system of tradable licenses for the right to use the common resource
 • Make the common resource excludable and assign property rights to some 
individuals
Like activities that generate negative externalities, use of a common resource 
can be reduced to the efficient quantity by imposing a Pigouvian tax. For exam-
ple, some countries have imposed “congestion charges” on those who drive during 
rush hour, in effect charging them for use of the common resource of highway 
space. Likewise, visitors to national parks must pay a fee, and the number of visi-
tors to any one park is restricted.
A second way to correct the problem of overuse is to create a system of trad-
able licenses for the use of the common resource much like the systems designed 
to address negative externalities. The policy maker issues the number of licenses 
that corresponds to the efficient level of use of the good. Making the licenses trad-
able ensures that the right to use the good is allocated efficiently—that is, those 
who end up using the good (those willing to pay the most for a license) are those 
who gain the most from its use.
But when it comes to common resources, often the most natural solution 
is simply to assign property rights. At a fundamental level, common resources 
are subject to overuse because nobody owns them. The essence of ownership 
of a good—the property right over the good—is that you can limit who can and 
cannot use the good as well as how much of it can be used. When a good is non-
excludable, in a very real sense no one owns it because a property right cannot 
be enforced—and consequently no one has an incentive to use it efficiently. So 
one way to correct the problem of overuse is to make the good excludable and 
assign property rights over it to someone. The good now has an owner who has 
an incentive to protect the value of the good—to use it efficiently rather than 
overuse it.
As the upcoming Economics in Action shows, a system of tradable licenses, 
called individual transferable quotas or ITQs, has been a successful strategy in 
some fisheries.

SAVING THE OCEANS WITH ITQS
T
he world’s oceans are in serious trouble. According to a 2011 study by the 
International Program on the State of the Oceans, there is an imminent risk 
of widespread extinctions of multiple species of fish. In Europe, 30% of the fish 
stocks are in danger of collapse. In the North Sea, 93% of cod are fished before 
they can breed. And bluefin tuna, a favorite in Japanese sushi, are in danger of 
imminent extinction. 
Not surprisingly, the principal culprit is overfishing. The decline of fishing 
stocks has worsened as fishermen trawl in deeper waters with their very large 

C H A P T E R  1 7    P U B L I C  G O O D S  A N D  C O M M O N  R E S O U RC E S    491
nets to catch the remaining fish, unintentionally killing 
many other marine animals in the process.
The fishing industry is in crisis, too, as fisher-
men’s incomes decline and they are compelled to fish 
for longer periods of time and in more dangerous 
waters in order to make a living.
But, individual transferable quotas, or ITQs, may 
provide a solution to both crises. Under an ITQ 
scheme, a fisherman receives a license entitling him to 
catch an annual quota within a given fishing ground. 
The ITQ is given for a long period of time, sometimes 
indefinitely. Because it is transferable, the owner can 
sell or lease it.
Researchers who analyzed 121 established ITQ 
schemes around the world concluded that ITQs can 
help reverse the collapse of fisheries because each ITQ holder now has a finan-
cial interest in the long-term maintenance of his particular fishery.
ITQ schemes (also called catch-share schemes) are common in New 
Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and increasingly in the United States and 
Canada. The Alaskan halibut fishery is one example of a successful ITQ 
scheme. When it was implemented, the annual fishing season had shrunk 
from four months to two or three days, resulting in dangerous races by the 
boats. Now the season lasts nearly eight months. Steve Gaines, Director of 
the Marine Science Institute at the University of California at Santa Barbara 
says, “Halibut fishermen were barely squeaking by—but now the fishery is 
insanely profitable.”

Artificially Scarce Goods
A
n artificially scarce good is a good that is excludable but nonrival in con-
sumption. As we’ve already seen, on-demand movies are a familiar exam-
ple. The marginal cost to society of allowing an individual to watch the 
movie is zero, because one person’s viewing doesn’t interfere with other people’s 
viewing. Yet DirecTV and companies like it prevent an individual from seeing a 
movie if he or she hasn’t paid. Goods like computer software or audio files, which 
are valued for the information they embody (and are sometimes called “informa-
tion goods”), are also artificially scarce.
As we’ve already seen, markets will supply artificially scarce goods: because 
they are excludable, the producers can charge people for consuming them.
But artificially scarce goods are nonrival in consumption, which means that 
the marginal cost of an individual’s consumption is zero. So the price that the

supplier of an artificially scarce good charges exceeds marginal cost. Because 
the efficient price is equal to the marginal cost of zero, the good is “artificially 
scarce,” and consumption of the good is inefficiently low. However, unless the 
producer can somehow earn revenue for producing and selling the good, he or 
she will be unwilling to produce at all—an outcome that leaves society even worse 
off than it would otherwise be with positive but inefficiently low consumption.
Figure 17-4 illustrates the loss in total surplus caused by artificial scarcity. 
The demand curve shows the quantity of on-demand movies watched at any given 
price. The marginal cost of allowing an additional person to watch the movie is 
zero, so the efficient quantity of movies viewed is QOPT. DirecTV charges a posi-
tive price, in this case $4, to unscramble the signal, and as a result only QMKT
on-demand movies will be watched. This leads to a deadweight loss equal to the 
area of the shaded triangle.
An Artificially Scarce Good

An artificially scarce good is excludable and nonrival 
in consumption. It is made artificially scarce because 
producers charge a positive price, but the marginal cost 
of allowing one more person to consume the good is 
zero. In this example, the market price of an on-demand 
movie is $4 and the quantity demanded at that price is 
QMKT. But the efficient level of consumption is QOPT, the 
quantity demanded when the price is zero. The efficient 
quantity, QOPT, exceeds the quantity demanded in an 
unregulated market, QMKT. The shaded area represents 
the loss in total surplus from charging a price of $4.

Does this look familiar? Like the problems that arise with public goods and 
common resources, the problem created by artificially scarce goods is similar to 
something we have already seen: in this case, it is the problem of natural monop-
oly. A natural monopoly, you will recall, is an industry in which average total cost 
is above marginal cost for the relevant output range. In order to be willing to 
produce output, the producer must charge a price at least as high as average total 
cost—that is, a price above marginal cost. But a price above marginal cost leads 
to inefficiently low consumption.

BLACKED - OUT GAMES
I
t’s the night of the big game for your local team—a game that is being 
nationally televised by one of the major networks. So you flip to the local 
channel that is an affiliate of that network—but the game isn’t on. Instead, 
you get some other show with a message scrolling across the bottom of the 
screen that this game has been blacked out in your area. What the message 
probably doesn’t say, though you understand quite well, is that this blackout is 

C H A P T E R  1 7    P U B L I C  G O O D S  A N D  C O M M O N  R E S O U RC E S    493
at the insistence of the team’s owners, who 
don’t want people who might have paid 
for tickets staying home and watching the 
game on TV instead. Often games that fail 
to sell out their stadium tickets are blacked 
out in local broadcast markets.
So the good in question—watching the 
game on TV—has been made artificially 
scarce. Because the game is being broad-
cast anyway, no scarce resources would be 
used to make it available in its immediate 
locality as well. But it isn’t available—
which means a loss in welfare to those 
who would have watched the game on TV 
but are not willing to pay the price, in time 
and money, to go to the stadium.
Sometimes, though, accommodations are 
made in specific situations. In 2009, for 
example, the NFL relaxed its policy and allowed blacked-out games to be rebroad-
cast on its website 72 hours after games end.

John Hume’s Mauricedale ranch occupies 16,000 square miles in the hot, scrubby 
grasslands of northeastern South Africa. There he raises endangered species, 
such as black and white rhinos, and nonendangered species, such as Cape buf-
falo, antelopes, hippos, giraffes, zebras, and ostriches. From revenues of around 
$2.5 million per year, the ranch earns a small profit, with about 20% of the rev-
enues coming from trophy hunting and 80% from selling live animals to farmers. 
Although he entered this business to earn a profit, Hume sees himself as a 
conservator of these animals and this land. And he is convinced that in order to 
protect the black and white rhinos, some amount of legalized hunting of them is 
necessary. According to Hume, “. . . rhinos are the most incredible animals on 
earth. I’m desperately sorry for them because they need our help.”
The story of one of Hume’s male rhinos, named “65,” illustrates his point. 
Hume and his staff knew that 65 was a problem: although too old to breed, he 
was belligerent enough to kill younger male rhinos. He was part of what wildlife 
conservationists call the “surplus male problem,” a male whose presence inhibits 
the growth of the herd.  
Eventually, Hume obtained permission for the hunting of 65 from CITES 
(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), the international body 
that regulates the trade and legalized hunting of endangered species. A wealthy 
hunter paid Hume $150,000, and the troublesome 65 was quickly dispatched.
Conservationist ranchers like Hume, who advocate regulated hunting of wild-
life, point to the experience of Kenya to buttress their case. In 1977, Kenya banned 
the trophy hunting or ranching of wildlife. Since then, Kenya has lost 60% to 70% 
of its large wildlife through poaching or conversion of habitat to agriculture. Its 
herd of black rhinos, once numbered at 20,000, now stands at 600, surviving only 
in protected areas. In contrast, since regulated hunting of the less endangered 
white buffalo began in South Africa in 1968, its numbers have risen from 1,800 
to 19,400.
Many conservationists now agree that the key to recovery for a number 
of endangered species is legalized hunting on well-regulated game ranches—
ranches that are actively engaged in breeding and maintaining the animals.  
However, legalized hunting is currently a very controversial policy, strong-
ly opposed by some wildlife advocates. Because establishing a ranch like 
Mauricedale requires a huge capital investment, many are concerned that 
smaller, fly-by-night ranches will engage in “canned hunts” with animals—often 
drugged or sick—obtained from elsewhere. And there is a fear that the high prices 
paid for trophy hunts will make ranchers too eager to cull animals from their 
herds. As of the time of writing, those advocating legalized hunting appear to be 
gaining ground.

SUMMARY
 1. Goods may be classified according to whether or not 
they are excludable and whether or not they are rival 
in consumption.
 2. Free markets can deliver efficient levels of produc-
tion and consumption for private goods, which 
are both excludable and rival in consumption. 
When goods are nonexcludable or nonrival in con-
sumption, or both, free markets cannot achieve effi-
cient outcomes.
 3. When goods are nonexcludable, there is a free - rider 
problem: some consumers will not pay for the good, 
consuming what others have paid for and leading to 
inefficiently low production. When goods are nonrival 
in consumption, they should be free, and any positive 
price leads to inefficiently low consumption.
 4. A public good is nonexcludable and nonrival in con-
sumption. In most cases a public good must be sup-
plied by the government. The marginal social benefit 
of a public good is equal to the sum of the individual 
marginal benefits to each consumer. The efficient 
quantity of a public good is the quantity at which 
marginal social benefit equals the marginal cost of 
providing the good. Like a positive externality, mar-
ginal social benefit is greater than any one individual’s 
marginal benefit, so no individual is willing to provide 
the efficient quantity.
 5. One rationale for the presence of government is that 
it allows citizens to tax themselves in order to provide 
public goods. Governments use cost - benefit analysis 
to determine the efficient provision of a public good. 
Such analysis is difficult, however, because individuals 
have an incentive to overstate the good’s value to them.
 6. A common resource is rival in consumption but nonex-
cludable. It is subject to overuse, because an individual 
does not take into account the fact that his or her use 
depletes the amount available for others. This is similar to 
the problem of a negative externality: the marginal social 
cost of an individual’s use of a common resource is always 
higher than his or her individual marginal cost. Pigouvian 
taxes, the creation of a system of tradable licenses, or the 
assignment of property rights are possible solutions.
 7. Artificially scarce goods are excludable but nonrival 
in consumption. Because no marginal cost arises from 
allowing another individual to consume the good, the 
efficient price is zero. A positive price compensates the 
producer for the cost of production but leads to ineffi-
ciently low consumption. The problem of an artificially 
scarce good is similar to that of a natural monopoly.

 a. When the museum is quiet, is it rival or nonrival 
in consumption? Is it excludable or nonexcludable? 
What type of good is the museum at those times? 
What would be the efficient price to charge visitors 
during that time, and why?
 b. When the museum is busy, is it rival or nonrival in

What type of good is the museum at those times? 
What would be the efficient price to charge visitors

how many street cleanings would there be?
 b. Calculate the marginal social benefit of street clean-
ing. What is the optimal number of street cleanings?
 c. Consider the optimal number of street cleanings. The 
last street cleaning of that number costs $9. Is Tanisha 
willing to pay for that last cleaning on her own? Is 
Ari willing to pay for that last cleaning on his own?
 6. Anyone with a radio receiver can listen to public radio, 
which is funded largely by donations.
 a. Is public radio excludable or nonexcludable? Is it rival 
in consumption or nonrival? What type of good is it?
 b. Should the government support public radio? 
Explain your reasoning.
 c. In order to finance itself, public radio decides to trans-
mit only to satellite radios, for which users have to pay 
a fee. What type of good is public radio then? Will the 
quantity of radio listening be efficient? Why or why not?
 7. Your economics professor assigns a group project for 
the course. Describe the free-rider problem that can 
lead to a suboptimal outcome for your group. To com-
bat this problem, the instructor asks you to evaluate the 
contribution of your peers in a confidential report. Will 
this evaluation have the desired effects? 
 8. The village of Upper Bigglesworth has a village “com-
mons,” a piece of land on which each villager, by law, is 
free to graze his or her cows. Use of the commons is mea-
sured in units of the number of cows grazing on it. Assume 
that the marginal private cost curve of cow-grazing on the 
commons is upward-sloping (say due to more time spent 
herding). There is also a marginal social cost curve of 
cow-grazing on the commons: each additional cow grazed 
means less grass available for others, and the damage done 
by overgrazing of the commons increases as the number 
of cows grazing increases. Finally, assume that the private 
benefit to the villagers of each additional cow grazing on 
the commons declines as more cows graze, since each 
additional cow has less grass to eat than the previous one.
 a. Is the commons excludable or nonexcludable? Is it 
rival in consumption or nonrival? What kind of good 
is the commons?
 b. Draw a diagram showing the marginal social cost, 
marginal private cost, and the marginal private bene-
fit of cow-grazing on the commons, with the quantity 
of cows that graze on the commons on the horizontal 
axis. How does the quantity of cows grazing in the 
absence of government intervention compare to the 
efficient quantity? Show both in your diagram.
 c. The villagers hire you to tell them how to achieve an 
efficient use of the commons. You tell them that there 
are three possibilities: a Pigouvian tax, the assign-
ment of property rights over the commons, and a sys-
tem of tradable licenses for the right to graze a cow. 
Explain how each one of these options would lead to 
an efficient use of the commons. In the assignment of 
property rights, assume that one person is assigned 
the rights to the commons and the rights to all the 
cows. Draw a diagram that shows the Pigouvian tax.
 9. Prior to 2003, the city of London was often one big 
parking lot. Traffic jams were common, and it could 
take hours to travel a couple of miles. Each additional 
commuter contributed to the congestion, which can be 
measured by the total number of cars on London roads. 
Although each commuter suffered by spending valuable 
time in traffic, none of them paid for the inconvenience 
they caused others. The total cost of travel includes the 
opportunity cost of time spent in traffic and any fees 
levied by London authorities.
 a. Draw a graph illustrating the overuse of London roads, 
assuming that there is no fee to enter London in a 

C H A P T E R  1 7    P U B L I C  G O O D S  A N D  C O M M O N  R E S O U RC E S    497
vehicle and that roads are a common resource. Put 
the cost of travel on the vertical axis and the quantity 
of cars on the horizontal axis. Draw typical demand, 
individual marginal cost (MC), and marginal social 
cost (MSC) curves and label the equilibrium point. 
(Hint: The marginal cost takes into account the oppor-
tunity cost of spending time on the road for individual 
drivers but not the inconvenience they cause to others.)
b. In February 2003, the city of London began charg-
ing a £5 congestion fee on all vehicles traveling in 
London. Illustrate the effects of this congestion 
charge on your graph and label the new equilibrium 
point. Assume the new equilibrium point is not opti-
mally set (that is, assume that the £5 charge is too 
low relative to what would be efficient). 
c. The congestion fee was raised to £9 in January 2011. 
Illustrate the new equilibrium point on your graph, 
assuming the new charge is now optimally set. 
10. The accompanying table shows six consumers’ willing-
ness to pay (his or her individual marginal benefit) for 
one MP3 file copy of a Jay-Z album. The marginal cost 
of making the file accessible to one additional consum-
er is constant, at zero.

a. What would be the efficient price to charge for a 
download of the file?
b. All six consumers are able to download the file for 
free from a file-sharing service, Pantster. Which 
consumers will download the file? What will be the 
total consumer surplus to those consumers?
c. Pantster is shut down for copyright law infringe-
ment. In order to download the file, consumers now 
have to pay $4.99 at a commercial music site. Which 
consumers will download the file? What will be the 
total consumer surplus to those consumers? How 
much producer surplus accrues to the commercial 
music site? What is the total surplus? What is the 
deadweight loss from the new pricing policy?
11. Butchart Gardens is a very large garden in Victoria, 
British Columbia, renowned for its beautiful plants. It 
is so large that it could hold many times more visitors 
than currently visit it. The garden charges an admission 
fee of approximately $30. At this price, 1,000 people 
visit the garden each day. If admission were free, 2,000 
people would visit each day.
a. Are visits to Butchart Gardens excludable or nonex-
cludable? Are they rival in consumption or nonrival? 
What type of good is it?
b. In a diagram, illustrate the demand curve for visits 
to Butchart Gardens. Indicate the situation when 
Butchart Gardens charges an admission fee of $30. 
Also indicate the situation when Butchart Gardens 
charges no admission fee.
c. Illustrate the deadweight loss from charging a $30 
admission fee. Explain why charging a $30 admis-
sion fee is inefficient.
12. Software has historically been an artificially scarce 
good—it is nonrival because the cost of replication 
is negligible once the investment to write the code is 
made, but software companies make it excludable by 
charging for user licenses. But then open-source soft-
ware emerged, most of which is free to download and 
can be modified and maintained by anyone. 
a. Discuss the free-rider problem that might exist in 
the development of open-source software. What 
effect might this have on quality? Why does this 
problem not exist for proprietary software, such as 
the products of a company like Microsoft or Adobe?
b. Some argue that open-source software serves an 
unsatisfied market demand that proprietary soft-
ware ignores. Draw a typical diagram that illustrates 
how proprietary software may be underproduced. 
Put the price and marginal cost of software on the 
vertical axis and the quantity of software on the 
horizontal axis. Draw a typical demand curve and 
a marginal cost curve (MC) that is always equal to 
zero. Assume that the software company charges a 
positive price, P, for the software. Label the equilib-
rium point and the efficient point.
 13. In developing a vaccine for the SARS virus, a pharma-
ceutical company incurs a very high fixed cost. The 
marginal cost of delivering the vaccine to patients, how-
ever, is negligible (consider it to be equal to zero). The 
pharmaceutical company holds the exclusive patent to 
the vaccine. You are a regulator who must decide what 
price the pharmaceutical company is allowed to charge.
a. Draw a diagram that shows the price for the vaccine 
that would arise if the company is unregulated, and 
label it PM. What is the efficient price for the vac-
cine? Show the deadweight loss that arises from the 
price PM.
b. On another diagram, show the lowest price that the 
regulator can enforce that would still induce the 
pharmaceutical company to develop the vaccine. 
Label it P*. Show the deadweight loss that arises 
from this price. How does it compare to the dead-
weight loss that arises from the price PM?
c. Suppose you have accurate information about the 
pharmaceutical company’s fixed cost. How could 
you use price regulation of the pharmaceutical com-
pany, combined with a subsidy to the company, to 
have the efficient quantity of the vaccine provided at 
the lowest cost to the government?

O
N MAY 29, 1961, MR. AND MRS.
Alderson Muncy of Paynesville, 
West Virginia, bought a can of pork 
and beans at Henderson’s Supermarket. 
Ordinarily, this transaction wouldn’t 
have been notable. What made it differ-
ent was that Mr. and Mrs. Muncy didn’t 
pay with cash: they paid with food 
stamps, which the federal government 
had just begun issuing to help low-
income Americans put food on the table.
Since then, the food stamp program—
officially known as SNAP, the Supplemen–
tal Nutrition Assistance Program—has 
become a major presence on the American 
scene. In 2011, more than 44 million 
Americans, one-seventh of the population, 
were receiving food stamps.
Opinions about the program, not 
surprisingly, are deeply divided. Some 
argue that the food stamp program is 
doing exactly what it is supposed to 
do: at a time of economic crisis and 
high unemployment, food stamps are 
mitigating the suffering of the needi-
est. Others argue that the program has 
grown too large and expensive, with too 
many people relying on the government 
to help put food on the table at a cost of 
$68 billion in 2010.
But no one on either side of the 
debate wants to eliminate the program. 
In contemporary America, politicians 
often disagree about how much help 
financially troubled families should 
receive to pay for health care, housing, 
food, and other necessities, but there is 
a broad political consensus that troubled 
families should receive some help. And 
they do.
It’s the same around the world. 
Modern governments, especially in 
wealthy countries, devote a large 
chunk of their budgets to health care, 
income support for the elderly, aid 
to the poor, and other programs that 
reduce economic insecurity and, to 
some degree, income inequality. The 
collection of government programs 
devoted to these tasks is known as the 
welfare state.
We start this chapter by discuss-
ing the underlying rationale for welfare 
state programs. Then we describe and 
analyze the two main kinds of programs 
operating in the United States: income 
support programs, of which Social 
Security is by far the largest, and health 
care programs, dominated by Medicare 
and Medicaid.

uring World War II, a British clergyman gave a speech in which he con-
trasted the “warfare state” of Nazi Germany, dedicated to conquest, with 
Britain’s “welfare state,” dedicated to serving the welfare of its people. 
Since then, the term welfare state has come to refer to the collection of govern-
ment programs that are designed to alleviate economic hardship. A large share 
of the government spending of all wealthy countries consists of government 
transfers—payments by the government to individuals and families—that pro-
vide financial aid to the poor, assistance to unemployed workers, guaranteed 
income for the elderly, and assistance in paying medical bills for those with large 
health care expenses.
The Logic of the Welfare State
There are three major economic rationales for the creation of the welfare state. 
We’ll turn now to a discussion of each.
1. Alleviating Income Inequality Suppose that the Taylor family, which 
has an income of only $15,000 a year, were to receive a government check for 
$1,500. This check might allow the Taylors to afford a better place to live, eat 
a more nutritious diet, or in other ways significantly improve their quality of 
life. Also suppose that the Fisher family, which has an income of $300,000 a 
year, were to face an extra tax of $1,500. This probably wouldn’t make much 
difference to their quality of life: at worst, they might have to give up a few 
minor luxuries.
This hypothetical exchange illustrates the first major rationale for the welfare 
state: alleviating income inequality. Because a marginal dollar is worth more to a 
poor person than a rich one, modest transfers from the rich to the poor will do 
the rich little harm but benefit the poor a lot. So, according to this argument, a 
government that plays Robin Hood, taking from the rich to give to the poor, does 
more good than harm. Programs that are designed to aid the poor are known as 
poverty programs.
2. Alleviating Economic Insecurity The second major rationale for the 
welfare state is alleviating economic insecurity. Imagine ten families, each of 
which can expect an income next year of $50,000 if nothing goes wrong. But 
suppose the odds are that something will go wrong for one of the families, 
although nobody knows which one. For example, suppose each of the fami-
lies has a one in ten chance of experiencing a sharp drop in income because 
one family member is laid off or incurs large medical bills. And assume that 
this event will produce severe hardship for the family—a family member 
will have to drop out of school or the family will lose its home. Now sup-
pose there’s a government program that provides aid to families in distress, 
paying for that aid by taxing families that are having a good year. Arguably, 
this program will make all the families better off, because even families that 
don’t currently receive aid from the program might need it at some point in 
the future. Each family will therefore feel safer knowing that the government 
stands ready to help when disaster strikes. Programs designed to provide 
protection against unpredictable financial distress are known as social 
insurance programs.
These two rationales for the welfare state, alleviating income inequality and 
alleviating economic insecurity, are closely related to the ability-to-pay principle 
we learned about in Chapter 7. Recall how the ability-to-pay principle is used to 
justify progressive taxation: it says that people with low incomes, for whom an 
The welfare state is the collection 
of government programs designed to 
alleviate economic hardship.
A government transfer is a 
government payment to an individual 
or a family.
A poverty program is a government 
program designed to aid the poor.
A social insurance program is 
a government program designed 
to provide protection against 
unpredictable financial distress.

additional dollar makes a big difference to economic well-being, should pay a 
smaller fraction of their income in taxes than people with higher incomes, for 
whom an additional dollar makes much less difference. The same principle sug-
gests that those with very low incomes should actually get money back from the 
tax system.
3. Reducing Poverty and Providing Access to Health Care The third 
and final major rationale for the welfare state involves the social benefits of 
poverty reduction and access to health care, especially when applied to children 
of poor households. Researchers have documented that such children, on aver-
age, suffer life-long disadvantages. As we saw in the Economics in Action in 
Chapter 16, “The Impeccable Economic Logic of Early-Childhood Intervention 
Programs,” children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, even 
after adjusting for ability, are more likely to be underemployed or unemployed, 
engage in crime, and to suffer chronic health problems—all of which impose 
significant social costs. So, according to the evidence, programs that help to 
alleviate poverty and provide access to health care generate external benefits 
to society.
More broadly, as the following For Inquiring Minds explains, some political 
philosophers argue that principles of social justice demand that society take care 
of the poor and unlucky. Others disagree, arguing that welfare state programs 
go beyond the proper role of government. To an important extent, the difference 
between those two philosophical positions defines what we mean in politics by 
“liberalism” and “conservatism.”
But before we get carried away, it’s important to realize that things aren’t 
quite that cut and dried. Even conservatives who believe in limited govern-
ment typically support some welfare state programs. And even economists 
who support the goals of the welfare state are concerned about the effects 
of large-scale aid to the poor and unlucky on their incentives to work and 
save. Like taxes, welfare state programs can create substantial deadweight 
losses, so their true economic costs can be considerably larger than the direct 
monetary cost. We’ll turn to the costs and benefits of the welfare state later 
in this chapter. First, however, let’s examine the problems the welfare state is 
supposed to address.
In 1971 the philosopher John Rawls 
published A Theory of Justice, the most 
famous attempt to date to develop a 
theory of economic fairness. He asked 
readers to imagine deciding economic 
and social policies behind a “veil of 
ignorance” about their own identity. That 
is, suppose you knew you would be a 
human being but did not know whether 
you would be rich or poor, healthy or 
sick, and so on. Rawls argued that the 
policies that would emerge if people 
had to make decisions behind the veil of 
ignorance define what we mean by eco-
nomic justice. It’s sort of a generalized 
version of the Golden Rule: do unto oth-
ers as you would have them do unto you 
if you were in their place.
Rawls further argued that people 
behind the veil of ignorance would 
choose policies that placed a high value 
on the well-being of the worst-off mem-
bers of society: after all, each of us might 
be one of those unlucky individuals. As a 
result, Rawlsian theory is often used as 
an argument for a generous welfare state.
Three years after Rawls published 
his book, another philosopher, Robert 
Nozick, published Anarchy, State, and 
Utopia, which is often considered the 
libertarian response. Nozick argued that 
justice is a matter of rights, not results, 
and that the government has no right 
to force people with high incomes to 
support others with lower incomes. He 
argued for a minimal government that 
enforces the law and provides security—
the “night watchman state”—and against 
the welfare state programs that account 
for so much government spending.
Philosophers, of course, don’t run the 
world. But real-world political debate 
often contains arguments that are clearly 
based upon reflect either a Rawls-type 
or a Nozick-type position.

The Problem of Poverty
For at least the past 75 years, every U.S. president has promised to do his best to 
reduce poverty. In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson went so far as to declare a “war 
on poverty,” creating a number of new programs to aid the poor. Anti-poverty 
programs account for a significant part of the U.S. welfare state, although social 
insurance programs are an even larger part.
But what, exactly, do we mean by poverty? Any definition is somewhat arbi-
trary. Since 1965, however, the U.S. government has maintained an official defi-
nition of the poverty threshold, a minimum annual income that is considered 
adequate to purchase the necessities of life. Families whose incomes fall below 
the poverty threshold are considered poor.
The official poverty threshold depends on the size and composition of a fam-
ily. In 2010 the poverty threshold for an adult living alone was $11,344; for a 
household consisting of two adults and two children, it was $22,113.
Trends in Poverty Contrary to popular misconceptions, although the official 
poverty threshold is adjusted each year to reflect changes in the cost of living, 
it has not been adjusted upward over time to reflect the long-term rise in the 
standard of living of the average American family. As a result, as the economy 
grows and becomes more prosperous, and as average incomes rise, you might 
expect the percentage of the population living below the poverty threshold to 
steadily decline.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, this hasn’t happened. Figure 18-1 shows the 
U.S. poverty rate—the percentage of the population living below the poverty 
threshold—from 1960 to 2010. As you can see, the poverty rate fell steeply during 
the 1960s and early 1970s. Since then, however, it has fluctuated up and down, with 
no clear trend. In fact, in 2010 the poverty rate was higher than it was in 1967.
The poverty threshold is the 
annual income below which a family 
is officially considered poor.
The poverty rate is the percentage 
of the population with incomes 
below the poverty threshold.

FIGURE
Who Are the Poor? Many Americans probably hold a stereotyped image of 
poverty: an African-American or Hispanic family with no husband present and 
the female head of the household unemployed at least part of the time. This pic-
ture isn’t completely off-base: poverty is disproportionately high among African-
Americans and Hispanics as well as among female-headed households. But a 
majority of the poor don’t fit the stereotype.

C H A P T E R  1 8    T H E EC O N O M I C S O F T H E W E L FA R E S TAT E    503
In 2009, about 43.6 million Americans were in poverty—14.3% of the popula-
tion, or about one in seven persons. About one-quarter of the poor were African-
American, substantially exceeding their share of the overall population (only 
about 13% of the population is African-American). The average poverty rate 
among the group was 27.4%. Hispanics were also more likely than the average 
American to be poor, with a poverty rate of 26.6%. But there was also widespread 
poverty among non-Hispanic Whites, who made up more than half the ranks of 
the poor.
There is also a correlation between family makeup and poverty. Female-
headed families with no husband present had a very high poverty rate: 
31.6%. Married couples were much less likely to be poor, with a poverty rate 
of only 6.2%; still, about 39% of the poor were in married families with both 
spouses present.
What really stands out in the data, however, is the association between pov-
erty and inadequate employment. Adults who work full time are very unlikely 
to be poor: only 2.6% of full-time workers were poor in 2010. Many industries, 
particularly in the retail and service sectors, now rely primarily on part-time 
workers. Part-time work typically lacks benefits such as health plans, paid vaca-
tion days, and retirement benefits, and it also usually pays a lower hourly wage 
than comparable full-time work. As a result, many of the poor are members of 
what analysts call the working poor: workers whose income falls at or below the 
poverty threshold.
What Causes Poverty? Poverty is often blamed on lack of education, and 
educational attainment clearly has a strong positive effect on income level—
those with more education earn, on average, higher incomes than those with 
How does America’s poverty problem compare with 
the situation in other wealthy countries? The answer 
depends, in part, on the definition of poverty—although 
the United States performs relatively poorly regardless 
of the definition.
The figure shows poverty rates in 2000 in five rich 
countries, under two definitions. One definition, 
which is widely used in international compari-
sons, defines someone as poor if they live in 
a household with less than half their country’s 
median income, which we define in an upcom-
ing section. This is a relative definition of 
poverty: you’re poor if you have a low income 
compared with other people in your country. 
As the orange bars in the figure show, by this 
measure the United States has high poverty 
compared with other rich nations.
One objection to this comparison is that 
America is even richer than other rich countries 
and has a somewhat higher median income 
than the other countries shown. Does the 
United States still have high poverty when this 
is taken into account? The purple bars use a measure 
of absolute poverty, similar to the official U.S. poverty 
threshold. The United States is no longer the country with 
the highest poverty rate by this measure—it is in second 
place. By either measure, the United States has a high 
poverty rate compared to other rich countries.

less education. For example, in 1979 the average hourly wage 
of men with a college degree was 38% higher than that of 
men with only a high school diploma; by 2011, the “college 
premium” had increased to 82%.
Lack of proficiency in English is also a barrier to higher 
income. For example, Mexican-born male workers in the 
United States—two-thirds of whom have not graduated from 
high school and many of whom have poor English skills—
earn less than half of what native-born men earn.
And it’s important not to overlook the role of racial and 
gender discrimination; although less pervasive today than 
50 years ago, discrimination still erects formidable barri-
ers to advancement for many Americans. Non-Whites earn 
less and are less likely to be employed than Whites with 
comparable levels of education. Studies find that African-
American males suffer persistent discrimination by employers in favor of 
Whites, African-American women, and Hispanic immigrants. Women earn 
lower incomes than men with similar qualifications.
In addition, one important source of poverty that should not be overlooked is 
bad luck. Many families find themselves impoverished when a wage-earner loses 
a job or a family member falls seriously ill.
Consequences of Poverty The consequences of poverty are often severe, 
particularly for children. In 2010, 22% of children in the United States lived in 
poverty. Poverty is often associated with lack of access to health care, which can 
lead to further health problems that erode the ability to attend school and work 
later in life. Affordable housing is also frequently a problem, leading poor fami-
lies to move often, disrupting school and work schedules. Recent medical studies 
have shown that children raised in severe poverty tend to suffer from lifelong 
learning disabilities. As a result, American children growing up in or near pov-
erty don’t have an equal chance at the starting line: they tend to be at a disadvan-
tage throughout their lives. For example, even talented children who come from 
poor families are unlikely to finish college.
Table 18-1 shows the results of a long-term survey conducted by the U.S. 
Department of Education, which tracked a group of students who were in eighth 
grade in 1988. That year, the students took 
a mathematics test that the study used as 
an indicator of their innate ability; the 
study also identified students by the socio-
economic status of their families, a mea-
sure that took into account their parents’ 
income and employment.
As you can see, the results were dis-
turbing: only 29% of students who were in 
the highest-scoring 25% on the test but whose parents were of low status finished 
college. By contrast, the equally talented children of high-status parents had a 
74% chance of finishing college—and children of high-status parents had a 30% 
chance of finishing college even if they had low test scores. What this tells us is 
that poverty is, to an important degree, self-perpetuating: the children of the poor 
start at such a disadvantage relative to other Americans that it’s very hard for 
them to achieve a better life.
Economic Inequality
The United States is a rich country. In 2007, before the recession hit, the average 
U.S. household had an income of $67,609, far exceeding the poverty threshold. 
Even after a devastating recession, average household income in 2010 was still 
The United States has a high poverty rate compared to other 
rich countries.

$67,530. How is it possible, then, that so many Americans still live in poverty? The 
answer is that income is unequally distributed, with many households earning 
much less than the average and others earning much more.
Table 18-2 shows the distribution of pre-tax income—income before fed-
eral income taxes are paid—among U.S. families in 2010, as estimated by 
the Census Bureau. Households are 
grouped into quintiles, each contain-
ing 20%, or one-fifth, of the popula-
tion. The first, or bottom, quintile 
contains households whose income 
put them below the 20th percentile in 
income, the second quintile contains 
households whose income put them 
between the 20th and 40th percen-
tiles, and so on.
For each group, Table 18-2 shows 
three numbers. The second column 
shows the income ranges that define 
the group. For example, in 2010, the 
bottom quintile consisted of house-
holds with annual incomes of less than $20,000, the next quintile of house-
holds had incomes between $20,000 and $38,043, and so on. The third column 
shows the average income in each group, ranging from $11,034 for the bottom 
fifth to $287,686 for the top 5%. The fourth column shows the percentage of 
total U.S. income received by each group.
Mean versus Median Household Income At the bottom of Table 18-2 are 
two useful numbers for thinking about the incomes of American households. 
Mean household income, also called average household income, is the total 
income of all U.S. households divided by the number of households. Median 
household income is the income of a household in the exact middle of the 
income distribution—the level of income at which half of all households have 
lower income and half have higher income. It’s very important to realize that 
these two numbers do not measure the same thing.
Economists often illustrate the difference by asking people first to imagine 
a room containing several dozen more or less ordinary wage-earners, then to 
think about what happens to the mean and median incomes of the people in the 
room if a Wall Street tycoon, some of whom earn more than a billion dollars a 
year, walks in. The mean income soars, because the tycoon’s income pulls up 
the average, but median income hardly rises at all. This example helps explain 
why economists generally regard median income as a better guide to the eco-
nomic status of typical American families than mean income: mean income 
is strongly affected by the incomes of a relatively small number of very-high-
income Americans, who are not representative of the population as a whole; 
median income is not.
What we learn from Table 18-2 is that income in the United States is quite 
unequally distributed. The average income of the poorest fifth of families is less 
than a quarter of the average income of families in the middle, and the rich-
est fifth have an average income more than three times that of families in the 
middle. The incomes of the richest fifth of the population are, on average, about 
15 times as high as those of the poorest fifth. In fact, the distribution of income 
in America has become more unequal since 1980, rising to a level that has made 
it a significant political issue. The Economics in Action at the end of this section 
discusses long-term trends in U.S. income inequality, which declined in the 1930s 
and 1940s, was stable for more than 30 years after World War II, but began rising 
again in the late 1970s.

The Gini Coefficient It’s often convenient to have a single number that sum-
marizes a country’s level of income inequality. The Gini coefficient, the most 
widely used measure of inequality, is based on how disparately income is dis-
tributed across the quintiles. A country with a perfectly equal distribution of 
income—that is, one in which the bottom 20% of the population received 20% of 
the income, the bottom 40% of the population received 40% of the income, and 
so on—would have a Gini coefficient of 0. At the other extreme, the highest pos-
sible value for the Gini coefficient is 1—the level it would attain if all a country’s 
income went to just one person.
One way to get a sense of what Gini coefficients mean in practice is 
to look at international comparisons. Figure 18-2 shows the most recent esti-
mates of the Gini coefficient for many of the world’s countries. Aside from 
a few countries in Africa, the highest levels of income inequality are found 
in Latin America, especially Colombia; countries with a high degree of 
inequality have Gini coefficients close to 0.6. The most equal distributions of 
income are in Europe, especially in Scandinavia; countries with very equal 
income distributions, such as Sweden, have Gini coefficients around 0.25. 
Compared to other wealthy countries, the United States, with a Gini coef-
ficient of 0.41, has unusually high inequality, though it isn’t as unequal as in 
Latin America.
How serious an issue is income inequality? In a direct sense, high income 
inequality means that some people don’t share in a nation’s overall prosperity. As 
we’ve seen, rising inequality explains how it’s possible that the U.S. poverty rate 
has failed to fall for the past 40 years even though the country as a whole has 
become considerably richer. Also, extreme inequality, as found in Latin America, 
is often associated with political instability because of tension between a wealthy 
minority and the rest of the population.
It’s important to realize, however, that the data shown in Table 18-2 
overstate the true degree of inequality in America, for several reasons. One 
is that the data represent a snapshot for a single year, whereas the incomes

of many individual families fluctuate over time. That is, many of those near 
the bottom in any given year are having an unusually bad year and many 
of those at the top are having an unusually good one. Over time, their 
incomes will revert to a more normal level. So a table showing average 
incomes within quintiles over a longer period, such as a decade, would not 
show as much inequality.
Furthermore, a family’s income tends to vary over its life cycle: most people 
earn considerably less in their early working years than they will later in life, 
then experience a considerable drop in income when they retire. Consequently, 
the numbers in Table 18-2, which combine young workers, mature workers, and 
retirees, show more inequality than would a table that compares families of 
similar ages.
Despite these qualifications, there is a considerable amount of genuine 
inequality in the United States. In fact, inequality not only persists for long 
periods of time for individuals, it extends across generations. The children 
of poor parents are much more likely to be poor than the children of afflu-
ent parents, and vice versa—a situation that is unique to the United States 
when compared to other rich countries. Moreover, the fact that families’ 
incomes fluctuate from year to year isn’t entirely good news. Measures of 
inequality in a given year do overstate true inequality. But those year-to-
year fluctuations are part of a problem that worries even affluent families—
economic insecurity.
Economic Insecurity
As we stated earlier, although the rationale for the welfare state rests in part 
on the social benefits of reducing poverty and inequality, it also rests in part 
on the benefits of reducing economic insecurity, which afflicts even relatively 
well-off families.
One form economic insecurity takes is the risk of a sudden loss of income, 
which usually happens when a family member loses a job and either spends 
an extended period without work or is forced to take a new job that pays con-
siderably less. In a given year, according to recent estimates, about one in six 
American families will see their income cut in half from the previous year. 
Related estimates show that the percentage of people who find themselves below 
the poverty threshold for at least one year over the course of a decade is several 
times higher than the percentage of people below the poverty threshold in any 
given year.
Even if a family doesn’t face a loss in income, it can face a surge in expenses. 
The most common reason for such surges is a medical problem that requires 
expensive treatment, such as heart disease or cancer. Many Americans have 
health insurance that covers a large share of their expenses in such cases, but 
a substantial number either do not have health insurance or rely on insurance 
provided by the government.

LONG-TERM TRENDS IN INCOME INEQUALITY 
IN THE UNITED STATES
D
oes inequality tend to rise, fall, or stay the same over time? The answer 
is yes—all three. Over the course of the past century, the United States 
has gone through periods characterized by all three trends: an era of falling 
inequality during the 1930s and 1940s, an era of stable inequality for about 
35 years after World War II, and an era of rising inequality over the past 
30 years.

Detailed U.S. data on income by quin-
tiles, as shown in Table 18-2, are only avail-
able starting in 1947. Panel (a) of Figure 
18-3 shows the annual rate of growth of 
income, adjusted for inflation, for each quin-
tile over two periods: from 1947 to 1980, and 
from 1980 to 2010. There’s a clear difference 
between the two periods. In the first period, 
income within each group grew at about the 
same rate—that is, there wasn’t much change 
in the inequality of income, just growing 
incomes across the board. After 1980, how-
ever, incomes grew much more quickly at the 
top than in the middle, and more quickly in 
the middle than at the bottom. So inequal-
ity has increased substantially since 1980. 
Overall, inflation-adjusted income for fami-
lies in the top quintile rose 51% between 1980 
and 2010, while actually falling slightly for 
families in the bottom quintile.
Although detailed data on income distri-
bution aren’t available before 1947, econo-
mists have instead used other information 
like income tax data to estimate the share of 
income going to the top 10% of the popula-
tion all the way back to 1917. Panel (b) of 
Figure 18-3 shows this measure from 1917 
to 2008. These data, like the more detailed 
data available since 1947, show that American 
inequality was more or less stable between 
1947 and the late 1970s but has risen substan-
tially since. The longer-term data also show, 
however, that the relatively equal distribution 
of 1947 was something new. In the late nine-
teenth century, often referred to as the Gilded 
Age, American income was very unequally 
distributed. This high level of inequality per-
sisted into the 1930s. But inequality declined 
sharply between the late 1930s and the end of World War II. In a famous 
paper, Claudia Goldin and Robert Margo, two economic historians, dubbed 
this narrowing of income inequality “the Great Compression.”
The Great Compression roughly coincided with World War II, a period 
during which the U.S. government imposed special controls on wages 
and prices. Evidence indicates that these controls were applied in ways 
that reduced inequality—for example, it was much easier for employers 
to get approval to increase the wages of their lowest-paid employees than 
to increase executive salaries. What remains puzzling is that the equality 
imposed by wartime controls lasted for decades after those controls were 
lifted in 1946.
Since the 1970s, as we’ve already seen, inequality has increased sub-
stantially. In fact, pre-tax income appears to be as unequally distributed 
in America today as it was in the 1920s, prompting many commentators to 
describe the current state of the nation as a new Gilded Age—albeit one in 
which the effects of inequality are moderated by taxes and the existence of 
the welfare state.

There is intense debate among economists about the causes of this widen-
ing inequality. The most popular explanation is rapid technological change, 
which has increased the demand for highly skilled or talented workers more 
rapidly than the demand for other workers, leading to a rise in the wage 
gap between the highly skilled and other workers. Growing international 
trade may also have contributed by allowing the United States to import 
labor-intensive products from low-wage countries rather than making 
them domestically, reducing the demand for less skilled American workers 
and depressing their wages. Rising immigration may be yet another source. 
On average, immigrants have lower education levels than native-born 
workers and increase the supply of low-skilled labor while depressing low-
skilled wages.
All these explanations, however, fail to account for one key feature: much 
of the rise in inequality doesn’t reflect a rising gap between highly educated 
workers and those with less education but rather growing differences among 
highly educated workers themselves. For example, schoolteachers and top busi-
ness executives have similarly high levels of education, but executive paychecks 
have risen dramatically and teachers’ salaries have not. For some reason, a few 
“superstars”—a group that includes literal superstars in the entertainment world 
but also such groups as Wall Street traders and top corporate executives—now 
earn much higher incomes than was the case a generation ago. It’s still unclear 
what caused the change.

 Quick Review
• Welfare state programs, which 
include government transfers, 
absorb a large share of government 
spending in wealthy countries.
• The ability-to-pay principle explains 
one rationale for the welfare state: 
alleviating income inequality. 
Poverty programs do this by aiding 
the poor. Social insurance pro-
grams address the second rationale: 
alleviating economic insecurity. The 
external benefits to society of pov-
erty reduction and access to health 
care, especially for children, is a 
third rationale for the welfare state.
• The official U.S. poverty threshold 
is adjusted yearly to reflect changes 
in the cost of living but not in the 
average standard of living. But even 
though average income has risen 
significantly, the U.S. poverty rate is 
no lower than it was 30 years ago.
• The causes of poverty can include 
lack of education, the legacy of 
racial and gender discrimination, 
and bad luck. The consequences of 
poverty are dire for children.
• Median household income is a bet-
ter indicator of typical household 
income than mean household 
income. Comparing of Gini coeffi-
cients across countries shows that 
the United States has less income 
inequality than poor countries but 
more than all other rich countries.
• The United States has seen declin-
ing and increasing income inequal-
ity. Since 1980, income inequality 
has increased substantially, largely 
due to increased inequality among 
highly educated workers.

The U.S. Welfare State
T
he U.S. welfare state consists of three huge programs (Social Security, 
Medicare, and Medicaid); several other fairly big programs, includ-
ing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, and 
the Earned Income Tax Credit; and a number of smaller programs. 
Table 18-3 shows one useful way to categorize these programs, along with 
the amount spent on each listed pro-
gram in 2010.
First, the table distinguishes between 
programs that are means-tested and 
those that are not. In means-tested pro-
grams, benefits are available only to fam-
ilies or individuals whose income and/
or wealth falls below some minimum. 
Basically, means-tested programs are 
poverty programs designed to help only 
those with low incomes. By contrast, 
non-means-tested 
programs 
provide 
their benefits to everyone, although, as 
we’ll see, they tend in practice to reduce 
income inequality.
Second, the table distinguishes between programs that provide mon-
etary transfers that beneficiaries can spend as they choose and those that 
provide in-kind benefits, which are given in the form of goods or services 
rather than money. As the numbers suggest, in-kind benefits are dominated 
by Medicare and Medicaid, which pay for health care. We’ll discuss health 
care in the next section of this chapter. For now, let’s examine the other 
major programs.
Means-Tested Programs
When people use the term welfare, they’re often referring to monetary aid to poor 
families. The main source of such monetary aid in the United States is Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This program does not aid everyone who 
is poor; it is available only to poor families with children and only for a limited 
period of time.
TANF was introduced in the 1990s to replace a highly controversial program 
known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC. The older program 
was widely accused of creating perverse incentives for the poor, including encour-
aging family breakup. Partly as a result of the change in programs, the benefits 
of modern “welfare” are considerably less generous than those available a gen-
eration ago, once the data are adjusted for inflation. Also, TANF contains time 
limits, so welfare recipients—even single parents—must eventually seek work. As 
you can see from Table 18-3, TANF is a relatively small part of the modern U.S. 
welfare state.
Other means-tested programs, though more expensive, are less controver-
sial. The Supplemental Security Income program aids disabled Americans 
who are unable to work and have no other source of income. The food stamp 
program or SNAP, which we discussed in the opening story, helps low-income 
families and individuals, who can use food stamps to buy food staples but not 
other items.
Finally, economists use the term negative income tax for a program 
that supplements the earnings of low-income working families. The United 
States has a program known as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which 
provides additional income to millions of workers. It has become more 
A means-tested program is a 
program available only to individuals 
or families whose incomes fall below 
a certain level.
An in-kind benefit is a benefit 
given in the form of goods or 
services.
A negative income tax is a 
program that supplements the 
income of low-income working 
families.

generous as traditional welfare has become less generous. Only workers who 
earn income are eligible for the EITC; over a certain range of incomes, the 
more a worker earns, the higher the amount of EITC received. That is, the 
EITC acts as a negative income tax for low-wage workers. In 2010, married 
couples with two children earning less than $12,550 per year received EITC 
payments equal to 40% of their earnings. (Payments were slightly lower for 
single-parent families or workers without children.) The EITC is phased out 
at higher incomes, disappearing at an income of $45,373 for married couples 
with two children in 2010.
Social Security and Unemployment Insurance
Social Security, the largest program in the U.S. welfare state, is a non-
means-tested program that guarantees retirement income to qualifying 
older Americans. It also provides benefits to workers who become disabled 
and “survivor benefits” to family members of workers who die. 
Social Security is supported by a dedicated tax on wages: the Social 
Security portion of the payroll tax, which was described in Chapter 
7, pays for Social Security benefits. The benefits workers receive 
on retirement depend on their taxable earnings during their work-
ing years: the more you earn up to the maximum amount subject 
to Social Security taxes ($106,800 in 2011), the more you receive 
in retirement. Benefits are not, however, strictly proportional to 
earnings. Instead, they’re determined by a formula that gives high 
earners more than low earners, but with a sliding scale that makes 
the program relatively more generous for low earners.
Because most seniors don’t receive pensions from their former 
employers and most don’t own enough assets to provide them with a 
living, Social Security benefits are an enormously important source of 
income for them. Fully 60% of Americans 65 and older rely on Social 
Security for more than half their income, and 20% have no income at 
all except for Social Security.
Unemployment insurance, although normally a much smaller 
amount of government transfers than Social Security, is another key 
social insurance program. It provides workers who lose their jobs with about 35% 
of their previous salary until they find a new job or until 26 weeks have passed. 
Although in response to the severe recession of 2007–2009, some unemployed 
workers received benefits for as long as 99 weeks. Unemployment insurance is 
financed by a tax on employers; outlays for unemployment insurance were unusu-
ally high in 2010, due to a high national unemployment rate. Like Social Security, 
unemployment insurance is not means-tested.
The Effects of the Welfare State on Poverty and Inequality
Because the people who receive government transfers tend to be differ-
ent from those who are taxed to pay for those transfers, the U.S. welfare 
state has the effect of redistributing income from some people to others. 
Each year the Census Bureau estimates the effect of this redistribution in 
a report titled “The Effects of Government Taxes and Transfers on Income 
and Poverty.” The report calculates only the direct effect of taxes and trans-
fers, without taking into account changes in behavior that the taxes and 
transfers might cause. For example, the report doesn’t try to estimate how 
many older Americans who are now retired would still be working if they 
weren’t receiving Social Security checks. As a result, the estimates are only 
a partial indicator of the true effects of the welfare state. Nonetheless, the 
results are striking.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social 
Security Act in 1935, creating the modern welfare state.

shows 
how 
taxes and government trans-
fers affected the poverty rate 
for the population as a whole 
and for different age groups 
in 2009. It shows two numbers 
for each group: the percentage 
of the group that would have 
had incomes below the poverty 
threshold if the government 
neither collected taxes nor made transfers, and the percentage that actually fell 
below the poverty threshold once taxes and transfers were taken into account. 
(For technical reasons, the second number is somewhat lower than the standard 
measure of the poverty rate.) Overall, the combined effect of taxes and transfers 
is to cut the U.S. poverty rate nearly in half. The elderly derived the greatest ben-
efits from redistribution, which reduced their potential poverty rate of 48.0% to 
an actual poverty rate of 9.8%.
Table 18-5 shows the effect 
of taxes and transfers on the 
share of aggregate income 
going to each quintile of the 
income distribution in 2009. 
Like Table 18-4, it shows both 
what the distribution of in-
come would have been if there 
were no taxes or government 
transfers, and the actual dis-
tribution of income taking into 
account both taxes and trans-
fers. The effect of government programs was to increase the share of income going 
to the poorest 80% of the population, especially the share going to the poorest 20%, 
while reducing the share of income going to the richest 20%.

LULA LESSENS INEQUALITY

razil was one of the world’s most 
unequal societies in 2002, the year 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, universally 
known simply as Lula, was elected presi-
dent. It was still one of the world’s most 
unequal societies in 2010, when he hand-
ed the reins over to Dilma Roussef, his 
successor. But by 2010 Brazil was less 
unequal, and poverty was sharply lower. 
And Brazil’s fight against poverty and 
inequality has become an international 
role model.
The numbers are striking. Figure 
18-4 shows percentage changes in real 
income for different deciles (tenths) of 
the Brazilian population from 2001 to 
2008. As you can see, there were huge 
gains for the poorest 10%, and the 
overall movement was clearly toward 
greater equality.

How did the Brazilians do it? One key factor was a new program known as 
Bolsa Familia (family grant). This program—modeled on a similar program in 
Mexico, but carried out on an even larger scale—offers what are known as “condi-
tional cash transfers”: payments that are available to poor families provided they 
meet certain requirements designed to help break the cycle of poverty. In particu-
lar, to get their allowances, families must keep their children in school and go for 
regular medical checkups, and mothers must attend workshops on subjects such 
as nutrition and disease prevention. The payments go to women rather than men 
because they are the most likely to spend the money on their families.
As of 2010, Bolsa Familia covered 50 million Brazilians, a quarter of the 
population. The payments don’t sound like much by U.S. standards: a monthly 
stipend of about $13 to poor families for each child age 15 or younger attend-
ing school, slightly higher payments for older children still in school, and a 
basic benefit of about $40 for families in extreme poverty. But Brazil’s poor 
are very poor indeed, and these sums were enough to make a huge difference 
in their incomes.
The success of Bolsa Familia has led to the establishment of similar programs 
in many countries, including the United States: a small pilot program along simi-
lar lines has been established in New York City.

The Economics of Health Care
A 
large part of the welfare state, in both the United States 
and other wealthy countries, is devoted to paying for 
health care. In most wealthy countries, the government 
pays between 70% and 80% of all medical costs. The private 
sector plays a larger role in the U.S. health care system. Yet 
even in America the government pays almost half of all health 
care costs; furthermore, it indirectly subsidizes private health 
insurance through the federal tax code.
Figure 18-5 shows who paid for U.S. health care in 2009. 
Only 13% of health care consumption spending (that is, all 
spending on health care except investment in health care 
buildings and facilities) was expenses “out of pocket”—that 
is, paid directly by individuals. Most health care spending, 
72%, was paid for by some kind of insurance. Of this 72%, 
considerably less than half was private insurance; the rest was 
some kind of government insurance, mainly Medicare and 
Medicaid. To understand why, we need to examine the special 
economics of health care.
The Need for Health Insurance
In 2009, U.S. personal health care expenses were $8,086 per 
person—17.6% of gross domestic product. This did not, how-
ever, mean that the typical American spent more than $8,000 
 Quick Review
• Means-tested programs are 
designed to reduce poverty, but 
non-means-tested programs do 
so as well. Programs are classified 
according to whether they provide 
monetary or in-kind benefits.
• “Welfare,” now known as TANF, is 
far less generous today than a gen-
eration ago due to concerns about 
its effect on incentives to work 
and family breakup. The negative 
income tax addresses these con-
cerns: it supplements the incomes 
of only low-income working families.
• Social Security, the largest pro-
gram in the U.S. welfare state, is 
a non-means-tested program that 
provides retirement income for the 
elderly. It provides a significant 
share of the income of most elderly 
Americans. Unemployment insur-
ance is also a key social insurance 
program that is not means-tested.
• Overall, the American welfare state 
is redistributive. It increases the 
share of income going to the poor-
est 80% while reducing the share 
going to the richest 20%.

In the United States in 2009, insurance paid for 
72% of health care consumption costs: the sum 
of 34% (private insurance), 22% (Medicare), and 
16% (Medicaid). The percentage paid for by private 
insurance, 34%, was a uniquely high number among 
advanced countries. Even so, substantially more U.S. 
health care was paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, and 
other government programs than by other means.

on medical treatment. In fact, in any given year half the population incurs only 
minor medical expenses. But a small percentage of the population faces huge 
medical bills, with 10% of the population typically accounting for almost two-
thirds of medical costs.
Is it possible to predict who will have high medical costs? To a limited extent, 
yes: there are broad patterns to illness. For example, the elderly are more likely to 
need expensive surgery and/or drugs than the young. But the fact is that anyone 
can suddenly find himself or herself needing very expensive medical treatment, 
costing many thousands of dollars in a very short time—far beyond what most 
families can easily afford. Yet nobody wants to be unable to afford such treatment 
if it becomes necessary.
Private Health Insurance Market economies have an answer to this problem: 
health insurance. Under private health insurance, each member of a large 
pool of individuals agrees to pay a fixed amount annually (called a premium) into 
a common fund that is managed by a private company, which then pays most of 
the medical expenses of the pool’s members. Although members must pay fees 
even in years in which they don’t have large medical expenses, they benefit from 
the reduction in risk: if they do turn out to have high medical costs, the pool will 
take care of those expenses.
There are, however, inherent problems with the market for private health 
insurance. These problems arise from the fact that medical expenses, 
although basically unpredictable, aren’t completely unpredictable. That is, 
people often have some idea whether or not they are likely to face large medi-
cal bills over the next few years. This creates a serious problem for private 
health insurance companies.
Suppose that an insurance company offers a “one-size-fits-all” health care 
policy, under which customers pay an annual premium equal to the average 
American’s annual medical expenses, plus a bit more to cover the company’s oper-
ating expenses and a normal rate of profit. In return, the insurance company pays 
the policyholder’s medical bills, whatever they are.
If all potential customers had an equal risk of incurring high medical expenses 
for the year, this might be a workable business proposition. In reality, however, 
people often have very different risks of facing high medical expenses—and, cru-
cially, they often know this ahead of time. This reality would quickly undermine any 
attempt by an insurance company to offer one-size-fits-all health insurance. The 
policy would be a bad deal for healthy people, who don’t face a significant risk of 
high medical bills: on average, they would pay much more in insurance premiums 
than the cost of their actual medical bills. But it would be a very good deal for people 
with chronic, costly conditions, who would on average pay less in premiums than 
the cost of their care.
As a result, some healthy people are likely to take their chances and go with-
out insurance. This would make the insurance company’s average customer less 
healthy than the average American. This raises the medical bills the company will 
have to pay and raises the company’s costs per customer. That is, the insurance 
company would face a problem called adverse selection, which is discussed in 
detail in Chapter 20. Because of adverse selection, a company that offers health 
insurance to everyone at a price reflecting average medical costs of the general 
population, and that gives people the freedom to decline coverage, would find 
itself losing a lot of money.
The insurance company could respond by charging more—raising its premium 
to reflect the higher-than-average medical bills of its customers. But this would 
drive off even more healthy people, leaving the company with an even sicker, higher-
cost clientele, forcing it to raise the premium even more, driving off even more 
healthy people, and so on. This phenomenon is known as the adverse selection death 
spiral, which ultimately leads the health insurance company to fail.
Under private health insurance, 
each member of a large pool of 
individuals pays a fixed amount 
annually to a private company that 
agrees to pay most of the medical 
expenses of the pool’s members.

This description of the problems with health insurance might lead you 
to believe that private health insurance can’t work. In fact, however, most 
Americans do have private health insurance. Insurance companies are able, to 
some extent, to overcome the problem of adverse selection two ways: by care-
fully screening people who apply for coverage and through employment-based 
health insurance. With screening (which we’ll learn more about in Chapter 19), 
people who are likely to have high medical expenses are charged higher-than-
average premiums—or in many cases, refusing to cover them at all. The next 
section explains how employment-based health insurance, a unique feature of 
the American workplace, also allows private health insurance to work.
Employment-Based Health Insurance For the most part, however, insur-
ance companies overcome adverse selection by selling insurance indirectly, to 
peoples’ employers rather than to individuals. The big advantage of employment-
based health insurance—insurance that a company provides to its employees—is 
that these employees are likely to contain a representative mix of healthy and 
less healthy people, rather than a selected group of people who want insur-
ance because they expect to pay high medical bills. This is especially true if the 
employer is a large company with thousands or tens of thousands of workers. 
Employers require their employees to participate in the company health insur-
ance plan because allowing employees to opt out (which healthier ones will be 
tempted to do) raises the cost of providing insurance for everyone else.
There’s another reason employment-based insurance is widespread in the 
United States: it gets special, favorable tax treatment. Workers pay taxes on their 
paychecks, but workers who receive health insurance from their employers don’t 
pay taxes on the value of the benefit. So employment-based health insurance is, 
in effect, subsidized by the U.S. tax system. Economists estimate the value of this 
subsidy at about $150 billion each year.
In spite of this subsidy, however, many working Americans don’t receive 
employment-based health insurance. Those who aren’t covered include most older 
Americans, because relatively few employers offer workers insurance that continues 
after they retire; the many workers whose employers don’t offer coverage (especially 
part-time workers); and the unemployed.
Government Health Insurance
Table 18-6 shows the breakdown of health insurance coverage across the U.S. 
population in 2010. A majority of Americans, almost 170 million people, received 
health insurance through their employers. The majority of those who didn’t have 
At the beginning of 2006, 116,000 work-
ers at more than 6,000 California small 
businesses received health coverage 
from PacAdvantage, a “purchasing pool” 
that offered employees at member busi-
nesses a choice of insurance plans. The 
idea behind PacAdvantage, which was 
founded in 1992, was that by banding 
together, small businesses could get bet-
ter deals on employee health insurance.
But only a few months later, in August 
2006, PacAdvantage announced that 
it was closing up shop because it 
could no longer find insurance 
companies willing to offer plans to 
its members.
What happened? It was the adverse 
selection death spiral. PacAdvantage 
offered the same policies to everyone, 
regardless of their prior health his-
tory. But employees didn’t have to get 
insurance from PacAdvantage—they 
were free, if they chose, to opt out 
and buy insurance on their own. And 
sure enough, healthy workers started 
to find that they could get lower rates 
by buying insurance directly for them-
selves, even though that meant giving 
up the advantages of bulk purchasing. 
As a result, PacAdvantage began to 
lose healthy clients, leaving behind an 
increasingly sick—and expensive—pool 
of customers. Premiums had to go up, 
driving out even more healthy workers, 
and eventually the whole plan had to 
shut down.

private insurance were covered by two government programs, 
Medicare and Medicaid. (The numbers don’t add up because 
some people have more than one form of coverage. For exam-
ple, many recipients of Medicare also have supplemental cover-
age either through Medicaid or private policies.)
Medicare, financed by payroll taxes, is available to all 
Americans 65 and older, regardless of their income and wealth. 
It began in 1966 as a program to cover the cost of hospitaliza-
tion but has since been expanded to cover a number of other 
medical expenses. You can get an idea of how much difference 
Medicare makes to the finances of elderly Americans by com-
paring the median income per person of Americans 65 and 
older—$18,819—with average annual Medicare payments per 
recipient, which were more than $11,000 in 2010. As with health 
care spending in general, however, the average can be misleading: in a given year, 
about 7% of Medicare recipients account for 50% of the costs.
At the beginning of 2006, there was a major expansion of 
Medicare, this time to cover the cost of prescription drugs. 
At the time Medicare was created, drugs played a relatively 
minor role in medicine and were rarely a major expense for 
patients. Today, however, many health problems, especially 
among the elderly, are treated with expensive drugs that must 
be taken for years on end, placing severe strains on some peo-
ple’s finances. As a result, a new Medicare program, known as 
Part D, was created to help pay these expenses.
Unlike Medicare, Medicaid is a means-tested program, 
paid for with federal and state government revenues. There’s 
no simple way to summarize the criteria for eligibility 
because it is partly paid for by state governments and each 
state sets its own rules. Of the 48 million Americans covered 
by Medicaid in 2009, 25 million were children under 18 and 
many of the rest were parents of children under 18. Most 
of the cost of Medicaid, however, is accounted for by a small number of older 
Americans, especially those needing long-term care.
More than 12 million Americans receive health insurance as a con-
sequence of military service. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, which pay 
medical bills but don’t deliver health care directly, the Veterans Health 
Administration, which has more than 8 million clients, runs hospitals and 
clinics around the country.
The U.S. health care system, then, offers a mix of private insurance, mainly 
from employers, and public insurance of various forms. Most Americans have 
health insurance either from private insurance companies or through various 
forms of government insurance. However, in 2010 almost 50 million people in 
America, 16.3% of the population, had no health insurance at all. What accounts 
for the uninsured, and how much does the problem of the uninsured matter?
The Problem of the Uninsured
The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent nonpartisan group that studies 
health care issues, offers a succinct summary of who is uninsured in America: 
“The uninsured are largely low-income adult workers for whom coverage is unaf-
fordable or unavailable.” The reason the uninsured are primarily adults is that 
Medicaid, supplemented by SCHIP (which provides health care for children in 
families that are above the poverty threshold but still have relatively low income), 
covers many, though not all, low-income children but is much less likely to pro-
vide coverage to adults, especially if they do not have children.

Low-income workers tend to be uninsured for two reasons: they are less 
likely than workers with higher income to have jobs that provide health insur-
ance benefits, and they are less likely to be able to afford to directly purchase 
health insurance themselves. Finally, insurance companies frequently refuse 
to cover people, regardless of their income, if they have a preexisting medical 
condition or something in their medical history suggesting that they are likely 
to need expensive medical treatment at some future date. As a result, a signifi-
cant number of Americans with incomes that most would consider middle class 
cannot get insurance.
It’s important to realize that lack of insurance is not synonymous with pov-
erty. Most people in America without health insurance have incomes above the 
poverty threshold, and 35% of the uninsured have incomes more than twice 
the poverty threshold. We should also note that some of the uninsured are 
relatively healthy people who could afford insurance but prefer to save money 
and take their chances, although there is dispute about how large the group 
of voluntarily uninsured is.
Like poverty, lack of health insurance has serious consequences, both medical 
and financial. On the medical side, the uninsured frequently have limited access 
to health care. Panel (a) of Figure 18-6 shows one summary of common problems 
associated with access to care, all of which are much worse for the uninsured 
than for the insured. On the monetary side, those who are uninsured often face 
serious financial problems when illness strikes. Panel (b) shows a summary of 
the main financial problems associated with medical care, all of which are much 
worse for those without health insurance.

Health Care in Other Countries
Health care is one area in which the United States is very different from other 
wealthy countries, including both European nations and Canada. In fact, we’re 
distinctive in three ways. First, we rely much more on private health insurance 
than any other wealthy country. Second, we spend much more on health care per 
person. Third, we’re the only wealthy nation in which large numbers of people 
lack health insurance.
Table 18-7 compares the United States with three other wealthy countries: 
Canada, France, and Britain. The United States is the only one of the four 
countries that relies on private 
health insurance to cover most 
people; as a result, it’s the only 
one in which private spend-
ing on health care is (slightly) 
larger than public spending on 
health care.
Canada has a single-payer 
system: a health care system 
in which the government acts 
as the principal payer of medi-
cal bills funded through taxes. 
For comparison, Medicare is 
essentially a single-payer sys-
tem for older Americans—and 
the Canadian system is, in fact, called Medicare. The British system is like the 
American Veterans Health Administration, extended to everyone: a government 
agency, the British National Health Service, employs health care workers and 
runs hospitals and clinics that are available free of charge to the public. France is 
somewhere in between the Canadian and British systems. In France, the govern-
ment acts as a single-payer, providing health insurance to everyone, and French 
citizens can receive treatment from private doctors and hospitals; but they also 
have the choice of receiving care from a sizable health care system run directly 
by the French government.
All three non-U.S. systems provide health insurance to all their citizens; the 
United States does not. Yet all three spend much less on health care per person 
than we do. Many Americans assume this must mean that foreign health care 
is inferior in quality. But many health care experts disagree with the claim that 
the health care systems of other wealthy countries deliver poor-quality care. As 
they point out, Britain, Canada, and France generally match or exceed the United 
States in terms of many measures of health care provision, such as the number of 
doctors, nurses, and hospital beds per 100,000 people. It’s true that U.S. medical 
care includes more advanced technology in some areas and many more expensive 
surgical procedures. U.S. patients also have shorter waiting times for elective 
surgery than patients in Canada or Britain. France, however, also has very short 
waiting times.
Surveys of patients seem to suggest that there are no significant differences 
in the quality of care received by patients in Canada, Europe, and the United 
States. And as Table 18-7 shows, the United States does considerably worse than 
other advanced countries in terms of basic measures such as life expectancy and 
infant mortality, although our poor performance on these measures may have 
causes other than the quality of medical care—notably our relatively high levels 
of poverty and income inequality.
So why does the United States spend so much more on health care than 
other wealthy countries? Some of the disparity is the result of higher doctors’ 
salaries, but most studies suggest that this is a secondary factor. One possibility 
is that Americans are getting better care than their counterparts abroad, but in

ways that don’t show up in either surveys of patient experiences or statistics on 
health performance.
However, the most likely explanation is that the U.S. system suffers from seri-
ous inefficiencies that other countries manage to avoid. Critics of the U.S. system 
emphasize the fact that our system’s reliance on private insurance companies, which 
expend resources on such activities as marketing and trying to identify and weed out 
high-risk patients, leads to high operating costs. On average, the operating costs of 
private health insurers eat up 14% of the premiums clients pay, leaving only 86% to 
spend on providing health care. By contrast, Medicare spends only 3% of its funds 
on operating costs, leaving 97% to spend on health care. A study by the McKinsey 
Global Institute found that the United States spends almost six times as much per 
person on health care administration as other wealthy countries. Americans also 
pay higher prices for prescription drugs because in other countries government 
agencies bargain with pharmaceutical companies to get lower drug prices.
The 2010 Health Care Reform
However one rates the past performance of the U.S. health care system, by 2009 
it was clearly in trouble. The root of the problem was the rising cost of health 
insurance, both private and public.
An immediate problem is that the cost of private insurance has been ris-
ing much faster than incomes. From 1999 to 2009 the average premiums for 
employment-based health insurance more than doubled, but the wages of the 
average worker rose only 35%. By 2009, the average cost of insurance for a fam-
ily of four was almost $14,000.
As a result of these rising costs, employment-based health insurance, the cen-
terpiece of the system for Americans under 65, is in decline. Figure 18-7 shows 
selected changes in the insurance status of Americans between 2000 and 2009. 
Over that period, while the total population rose by 25 million, the number of 
people with employment-based health insurance declined by almost 10 million. 
Despite the expansion of Medicaid by 18 million people, by 2009 12 million people 
joined the ranks of the uninsured.
At the same time, as private health insurance is faltering and the ranks of 
the uninsured increase, public health insurance is coming under increasing 
financial strain. Partly this is because Medicaid and other government programs 
now cover more people than in the past. Mainly, however, it is because the cost 
per beneficiary of government health insurance, like the cost per beneficiary of 
private insurance, has been rising rapidly.
Changes in Health Insurance Status, 2000–2009
18-7
Since 2000, the U.S. population has grown substantially, 
but the number of people with employment-based health 
insurance has actually declined. Growth in public health 
insurance, mainly Medicaid, made up part of the differ-
ence. There has also, however, been an increase in the 
number of uninsured.

What’s behind these rising costs? Figure 18-8 shows overall U.S. spending on 
health care as a percentage of GDP, a measure of the nation’s total income, since the 
1960s. As you can see, health spending has tripled as a share of income since 1965; 
this increase in spending explains why health insurance has become more expensive. 
Similar trends can be observed in other countries.
Why is health spending rising? The consensus of health experts is that it’s a 
result of medical progress. As medical science progresses, conditions that could 
not be treated in the past become treatable—but often only at great expense. Both 
private insurers and government programs feel compelled to cover the new proce-
dures—but this means higher costs, which either have to be passed on in the form 
of higher insurance premiums or require larger commitments of taxpayer funds.
The combination of a rising number of uninsured and rising costs has led 
to many calls for health care reform in the United States. And in 2010 Congress 
passed comprehensive health care reform legislation, officially known as the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), or ACA for short.
ACA, which won’t take full effect until 2014, is the largest expansion of the American 
welfare state since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. It has two major 
objectives: covering the uninsured and cost control. Let’s look at each in turn.
Covering the Uninsured On the coverage side, the ACA closely follows a model 
that has already been tested in Massachusetts, which introduced a very similar 
plan—under Republican then-governor and subsequent presidential hopeful Mitt 
Romney—in 2006. To understand the logic of both the Massachusetts plan and 
ACA, consider the problem facing one major category of uninsured Americans: 
the many people who seek coverage in the individual insurance market but are 
turned down because they have preexisting medical conditions, which insurance 
companies fear could lead to large future expenses. (Insurance companies have 
been known to deny coverage for even minor ailments, like allergies or a rash you 
had in college.) How can insurance be made available to such people?
One answer would be regulations requiring that insurance companies offer 
the same policies to everyone, regardless of medical history—a rule known as 
“community rating.” In fact, a number of states have such a rule. But community 
rating tends to lead to an adverse selection death spiral: Healthy individuals don’t 
buy insurance until or unless they get sick, and because only people with health 
problems are getting coverage, insurance becomes very expensive.
To make community rating work, it’s necessary to supplement it with other 
policies. Both the Massachusetts reform and ACA add two key features. First is 
Rising Health Care Costs

U.S. health care spending as a percentage of GDP, a mea-
sure of total income, has tripled since 1965. Similar trends 
can be seen in other countries. Most analysts believe that 
the main force behind this trend is medical progress: we 
spend more on health care because more medical problems 
are treatable.

the requirement that everyone purchase health insurance—known as the individ-
ual mandate. This prevents an adverse selection death spiral. Second, government 
subsidies make the required insurance affordable for lower- and lower-middle 
income families.
It’s important to realize that this system is like a three-legged stool: all three 
components must be present in order for it to work. Take away community rating, 
and those with preexisting conditions won’t get coverage. Take away the individu-
al mandate, and community rating will produce an adverse selection death spiral. 
And you can’t require that people buy insurance without providing subsidies to 
those with lower incomes.
Will this arrangement, once fully implemented, succeed in covering more 
or less everyone? The Massachusetts precedent is encouraging on that front: by 
2010, more than 98% of the state’s residents had health insurance and virtually 
all children were covered. Since the ACA is very similar in structure, it ought to 
produce similar results.
Cost Control But will ACA control costs? In itself, the expansion of coverage 
will raise health care spending, although not by as much as you might think. 
The uninsured are by and large relatively young, and the young have relatively 
low health care costs. (The elderly are already covered by Medicare.) The ques-
tion is whether the reform can succeed in “bending the curve”: reducing the 
rate of growth of health costs over time.
ACA’s promise to control costs starts from the premise that the U.S. medical 
system, as currently constituted, has skewed incentives that waste resources. 
Because most care is paid for by insurance, neither doctors nor patients have an 
incentive to worry about costs. In fact, because health care providers are gener-
ally paid for each procedure they perform, there’s a financial incentive to provide 
additional care—do more tests and, in some cases, perform more operations—
even when there are little or no medical benefits.
The bill attempts to correct these skewed incentives in a variety of ways, 
from stricter oversight of reimbursements, to linking payments to a proce-
dure’s medical value, to paying health care providers for improved health 
outcomes rather than the number of procedures, and by limiting the tax 
deductibility of employment-based plans. Even supporters of the reform 
admit that nobody knows how well any one of these measures will work, but 
they point out that ACA incorporates virtually every idea for cost control that 
has been proposed by health care economists and that some of these ideas 
are likely to be highly successful. Or they will be successful if the reform 
ever goes fully into effect.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
WHAT MEDICAID DOES
D
o social insurance programs actually help their beneficiaries? 
The answer isn’t always as obvious as you might think. Take 
the example of Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-
income Americans. Some skeptics about the program’s effectiveness 
have argued that in the absence of Medicaid, the poor would still find 
ways to get essential health care, and that there is no clear evidence 
that receiving Medicaid actually leads to better health.
Testing such assertions is tricky. You can’t just compare people 
who are on Medicaid with people who aren’t, since the program’s 
beneficiaries differ in many ways from those who aren’t on the 
program. And we don’t normally get to do controlled experiments 
in which otherwise comparable groups receive different govern-
ment benefits.
Medicaid has been shown to make a big difference in the 
g
p
well-being of recipients.

Once in a while, however, events provide the equivalent of a con-
trolled experiment—and that’s what happened with Medicaid. In 2008, the 
state of Oregon—which had sharply curtailed its Medicaid program because 
it lacked sufficient funds—found itself with enough money to put some 
but not all deserving recipients back on the program. To allocate the limited 
number of slots, the state used a lottery. And there you had it: in effect, a 
controlled experiment, in which researchers could compare a random 
sample of people receiving Medicaid with similar people who didn’t win the 
lottery.
So what were the results? It turned out that Medicaid made a big difference. 
Those on Medicaid received
 • 60% more mammograms
 • 35% more outpatient care
 • 30% more hospital care
 • 20% more cholesterol checks
Medicaid recipients were also
 • 70% more likely to have a consistent source of care
 • 55% more likely to see the same doctor over time
 • 45% more likely to have had a pap test within the last year (for women)
 • 40% less likely to need to borrow money or skip payment on other bills 
because of medical expenses
 • 25% percent more likely to report themselves in “good” or “excellent” health
 • 15% more likely to use prescription drugs
 • 15% more likely to have had a blood test for high blood sugar or diabetes
 • 10% percent less likely to screen positive for depression
In short, Medicaid led to major improvements in access to medical care and 
the well-being of those receiving it. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the pro-
gram is a good thing, since it does, after all, cost taxpayers a significant amount 
of money. But the Oregon results showed that one criticism of Medicaid—the 
claim that it doesn’t work at all—isn’t valid.

The Debate over the Welfare State
T
he goals of the welfare state seem laudable: to help the poor, to protect 
against severe economic hardship and to ensure access to essential health 
care. But good intentions don’t always make for good policy. There is an 
intense debate about how large the welfare state should be, a debate that partly 
• Health insurance satisfies an impor-
tant need because expensive medical 
treatment is unaffordable for most 
families. Private health insurance 
has an inherent problem: the adverse 
selection death spiral. Screening by 
insurance companies reduces the 
problem, and employment-based 
health insurance, the way most 
Americans are covered, avoids it 
altogether.
• The majority of Americans not 
covered by private insurance are 
covered by Medicare, which is non-
means-tested single-payer system 
for those over 65, and Medicaid, 
which is available based on income.
• Compared to other wealthy coun-
tries, the United States depends 
more heavily on private health insur-
ance, has higher health care spend-
ing per person, higher administrative 
costs, and higher drug prices, but 
without clear evidence of better 
health outcomes. 
• Health care costs everywhere are 
increasing rapidly due to scientific 
progress. The 2010 ACA legislation 
was designed to address the large 
and growing share of American 
uninsured and to reduce the rate of 
growth of health care spending.

reflects differences in philosophy but also reflects concern about the possibly 
counterproductive effects on incentives of welfare state programs. Disputes 
about the size of the welfare state are also one of the defining issues of modern 
American politics.
Problems with the Welfare State
There are two different arguments against the welfare state. One, which we 
described earlier in this chapter, is based on philosophical concerns about the 
proper role of government. As we learned, some political theorists believe that 
redistributing income is not a legitimate role of government. Rather, they believe 
that government’s role should be limited to maintaining the rule of law, providing 
public goods, and managing externalities.
The more conventional argument against the welfare state involves the 
trade-off between efficiency and equity, an issue that we first encountered in 
Chapter 7. As we explained there, the ability-to-pay-principle—the argument 
that an extra dollar of income matters more to a less well-off individual than 
to a more well-off individual—implies that the tax system should be progres-
sive, with high-income taxpayers paying a higher fraction of their income in 
taxes than those with lower incomes.
But this must be balanced against the efficiency costs of high marginal tax 
rates. Consider an extremely progressive tax system that imposes a marginal 
rate of 90% on very high incomes. The problem is that such a high marginal rate 
reduces the incentive to increase a family’s income by working hard or mak-
ing risky investments. As a result, an extremely progressive tax system tends 
to make society as a whole poorer, which could hurt even those the system was 
intended to benefit. That’s why even economists who strongly favor progres-
sive taxation don’t support a return to the extremely progressive system that 
prevailed in the 1950s, when the top U.S. marginal income tax rate was more 
than 90%. So, the design of the tax system involves a trade-off between equity 
and efficiency.
A similar trade-off between equity and efficiency implies that there 
should be a limit to the size of the welfare state. A government that oper-
ates a large welfare state requires more revenue than one that restricts itself 
mainly to provision of public goods such as national defense. A large wel-
fare state requires higher tax revenue and higher marginal tax rates than a 
smaller welfare state.
Table 18-8 shows “social expenditure,” a measure that roughly corresponds 
to total welfare state spending, as a percentage of GDP in the United States, 
Britain, and France. It also compares this with an esti-
mate of the marginal tax rate faced by an average single 
wage-earner, including payroll taxes paid by employers 
and state and local taxes. As you can see, France’s large 
welfare state goes along with a high marginal rate of 
taxation. As the upcoming Economics in Action explains, 
some but not all economists believe that this high rate of 
taxation is a major reason the French work substantially 
fewer hours per year than Americans.
One way to hold down the costs of the welfare state 
is to means-test benefits: make them available only to 
those who need them. But means-testing benefits creates a different kind 
of trade-off between equity and efficiency. Consider the following example: 
Suppose there is some means-tested benefit, worth $2,000 per year, that 
is available only to families with incomes of less than $20,000 per year. 
Now suppose that a family currently has an income of $19,500 but that one

family member is deciding whether to take a new job that will raise the 
family’s income to $20,500. Well, taking that job will actually make the family 
worse off, because it will gain $1,000 in earnings but lose the $2,000 govern-
ment benefit.
This feature of means-tested benefits, which makes a family worse off if 
it earns more is known as a notch. It is a well-known problem with programs 
that aid the poor and behaves much like a high marginal tax rate on income. 
Most welfare state programs are designed to avoid a notch by setting a slid-
ing scale for benefits. With a sliding scale, benefits diminish gradually as the 
recipient’s income rises rather than come to an abrupt end.
Even so, the combined effects of the major means-tested programs shown 
in Table 18-3, plus additional means-tested programs such as housing aid that 
are offered by some state and local governments, is to create very high effec-
tive marginal tax rates. For example, one 2005 study found that a family con-
sisting of two adults and two children that raised its income from $20,000 a 
year—just above the poverty threshold in 2005—to $35,000 would find almost 
all its increase in after-tax income offset by loss of benefits such as food 
stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and Medicaid.
The Politics of the Welfare State
In 1791, in the early phase of the French Revolution, French citizens con-
vened a congress, the Legislative Assembly, in which representatives were 
seated according to social class: the upper classes, who pretty much liked 
the way things were, sat on the right; commoners, who wanted big changes, 
sat on the left. Ever since, political commentators refer to politicians as 
being on the “right” (more conservative) or on the “left” (more liberal).
But what do modern politicians on the left and right disagree about? 
In the modern United States, they mainly disagree about the appropriate 
size of the welfare state. The debate over the Affordable Care Act was a 
case in point, with the vote on the bill breaking down entirely according to 
party lines—Democrats (on the left) in favor of ACA and Republicans (on the 
right) opposed.
You might think that saying that political debate is really about 
just one thing—how big to make the welfare state—is a huge oversimplifica-
tion. But political scientists have found that once you carefully rank mem-
bers of Congress from right to left on past legislation, a congressperson’s 
position in that ranking does a very good job of predicting his or her votes 
on future legislation.
The same studies that show a strong left–right spectrum in U.S. politics 
also show strong polarization between the major parties on this spectrum. 
Forty years ago, there was a substantial overlap between the parties: some 
Democrats were to the right of some Republicans, or, if you prefer, some 
Republicans were to the left of some Democrats. Today, however, the right-
most Democrats appear to be to the left of the leftmost Republicans. There’s 
nothing necessarily wrong with this. Although it’s common to decry “partisan-
ship,” it’s hard to see why members of different political parties shouldn’t have 
different views about policy.
Can economic analysis help resolve this political conflict? Only up to 
a point.
Some of the political controversy over the welfare state involves differ-
ences in opinion about the trade-offs we have just discussed: if you believe 
that the disincentive effects of generous benefits and high taxes are very 
large, you’re likely to look less favorably on welfare state programs than if 
you believe they’re fairly small. Economic analysis, by improving our knowl-
edge of the facts, can help resolve some of these differences.

C H A P T E R  1 8    T H E EC O N O M I C S O F T H E W E L FA R E S TAT E    525
To an important extent, however, differences of opinion on the welfare state 
reflect differences in values and philosophy. And those are differences economics 
can’t resolve.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
FRENCH FAMILY VALUES
T
he United States has the smallest welfare state of any major advanced 
economy. France has one of the largest. As we’ve already described, 
France has much higher social spending than America as a percentage 
of total national income, and French citizens face much higher tax rates than 
Americans. One argument against a large welfare state is that it has negative 
effects on efficiency. Does French experience support this argument?
On the face of it, the answer would seem to be a clear yes. French GDP 
per capita—the total value of the economy’s output, divided by the total 
population—is only about 80% of the U.S. level. This reflects the fact that 
the French work less: French workers and U.S. workers have almost exactly 
the same productivity per hour, but a smaller fraction of the French popula-
tion is employed, and the average French employee works substantially fewer 
hours over the course of a year than his or her American counterpart. Some 
economists have argued that high tax rates in France explain this differ-
ence: the incentives to work are weaker in France than in the United States 
because the government takes away so much of what you earn from an addi-
tional hour of work.
In the fall of 2011, Zuccotti Park, a small 
open space in Manhattan’s financial dis-
trict, was taken over by protestors, part 
of a movement known as “Occupy Wall 
Street.” The protestors had a number of 
grievances, but the most pressing were 
their complaints about Wall Street and 
its perceived contribution to growing 
inequality in the United States. “We are 
the 99 percent!” became the move-
ment’s favorite slogan, a reference to the 
large increase in share of income going 
to the top 1 percent of the American 
population. Wall Street, they charged, 
contributed to growing inequality by 
paying its bankers huge salaries and 
bonuses, while engaging in overly risky 
behavior that led to the housing boom 
and bust of 2007–2009 that decimated 
the economy. Was this a reasonable 
charge?
Those who found it unreasonable 
pointed to the contributions that Wall 
Street, and the American finance indus-
try in general, have made to the U.S. 
economy. Compared to other countries, 
the United States is a lead-
er in financial services and 
innovation, generating bil-
lions annually in revenues, 
and attracting trillions of 
dollars of investment from 
abroad. High salaries on 
Wall Street, they contend, 
are simply the rewards to 
skill and hard work in the 
competitive market for tal-
ent on Wall Street.
What is incontrovert-
ible, however, are the data 
that show that incomes in 
the finance industry have 
contributed to growing 
inequality in the United 
States. This is especially clear when 
you look not at the top percentile of 
the income distribution, but an even 
smaller group, the top 0.1 percent—
those with a median annual income of 
$5.6 million.
Although financial industry people 
are a minority (18%), within this income 
elite—consisting also of executives, 
managers, lawyers, and others—they 
are greatly overrepresented since only 
about 6 percent of American workers 
are employed in finance. So, the pro-
testers were making a valid point: Wall 
Street salaries are indeed one of the 
sources of the rapid rise in incomes at 
the top.

A closer examination, however, 
reveals that the story is more com-
plicated than that. The low level of 
employment in France is entirely 
the result of low rates of employ-
ment among the young and the old; 
80% of French residents of prime 
working age, 25–54, are employed, 
exactly the same percentage as 
in the United States. So high tax 
rates don’t seem to discourage 
the French from working in the 
prime of their lives. But only about 
30% of 15- to 24-year-olds are 
employed in France, compared 
with more than half of 15- to 
24-year-olds in the United States. 
And young people in France don’t 
work in part because they don’t 
have to: college education is gen-
erally free, and students receive 
financial support, so French stu-
dents, unlike their American counterparts, rarely work while attending 
school. The French will tell you that that’s a virtue of their system, not 
a problem.
Shorter working hours also reflect factors besides tax rates. French law 
requires employers to offer at least a month of vacation, but most U.S. work-
ers get less than two weeks off. Here, too, the French will tell you that their 
policy is better than ours because it helps families spend time together.
The aspect of French policy even the French agree is a big problem is 
that their retirement system allows workers to collect generous pensions 
even if they retire very early. As a result, only 40% of French residents 
between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed, compared with more than 
60% of Americans. The cost of supporting all those early retirees is a major 
burden on the French welfare state—and getting worse as the French popu-
lation ages.

• Intense debate on the size of the 
welfare state centers on philosophy 
and on equity-versus-efficiency 
concerns. The high marginal tax 
rates needed to finance an exten-
sive welfare state can reduce the 
incentive to work. Holding down the 
cost of the welfare state by means-
testing can also cause inefficiency 
through notches that create high 
effective marginal tax rates for ben-
efit recipients.
• Politics is often depicted as an 
opposition between left and right; 
in the modern United States, that 
division mainly involves disagree-
ment over the appropriate size of 
the welfare state.

“Wiggo Dalmo is a classic entrepreneurial type: the Working Class Kid Made 
Good.” So began a profile in the January 2011 issue of Inc. magazine. Dalmo 
began as an industrial mechanic who worked for a large company, repairing 
mining equipment. Eventually, however, he decided to strike out on his own and 
start his own business. Momek, the company he founded, eventually grew into a 
$44 million, 150-employee operation that does a variety of contract work on oil 
rigs and in mines. 
You can read stories like this all the time in U.S. business magazines. What 
was unusual about this particular article is that Dalmo and his company aren’t 
American, they’re Norwegian—and Norway, like other Scandinavian countries, 
has a very generous welfare state, supported by high levels of taxation. So what 
does Dalmo think of that system? He approves, saying that Norway’s tax system 
is “good and fair,” and he thinks the system is good for business. In fact, the Inc.
article was titled, “In Norway, Start-Ups Say Ja to Socialism.”
Why? After all, the financial rewards for being a successful entrepreneur 
are more limited in a country like Norway, with its high taxes, than they are in 
the United States, with its lower taxes. But there are other considerations. For 
example, an American thinking of leaving a large company to start a new busi-
ness needs to worry about whether he or she will be able to get health insurance, 
whereas a Norwegian in the same position is assured of health care regardless of 
employment. And the downside of failure is larger in the U.S. system, which offers 
minimal aid to the unemployed.
Still, is Wiggo Dalmo an exceptional 
case? Table 18-9 shows the nations with the 
highest level of entrepreneurial activity, 
according to a study financed by the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, which 
tried to quantify the level of entrepre-
neurial activity in different nations. The 
United States made it into the top 10, but 
so did Norway. And the list also includes 
Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, Canada, 
and Australia—all nations with higher 
taxes and more extensive social insurance 
than the United States.
The moral is that when comparing how 
business friendly different welfare state 
systems really are, you have to think a bit 
past the obvious question of the level of 
taxes.
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Why does Norway have to have higher taxes overall than the United States?
 2. This case suggests that government-paid health care helps entrepreneurs. How does this 
relate to the arguments we made for social insurance in the text?
 3. How would the incentives of people like Wiggo Dalmo be affected if Norwegian health 
care was means-tested instead of available to all?

SUMMARY
 1. The welfare state absorbs a large share of govern-
ment spending in all wealthy countries. Government 
transfers are the payments made by the government 
to individuals and families. Poverty programs alle-
viate income inequality by helping the poor; social 
insurance programs alleviate economic insecurity. 
Welfare state programs also deliver external benefits to 
society through poverty reduction and improved access 
to health care, particularly for children.
 2. Despite the fact that the poverty threshold is adjust-
ed according to the cost of living but not according to 
the standard of living, and that the average American 
income has risen substantially over the last 30 years, 
the poverty rate, the percentage of the population 
with an income below the poverty threshold, is no 
lower than it was 30 years ago. There are various 
causes of poverty: lack of education, the legacy of dis-
crimination, and bad luck. The consequences of pov-
erty are particularly harmful for children, resulting 
in more chronic disease, lower lifetime earnings, and 
higher rates of criminality.
 3. Median household income, the income of a fam-
ily at the center of the income distribution, is a better 
indicator of the income of the typical household than 
mean household income because it is not distorted 
by the inclusion of a small number of very wealthy 
households. The Gini coefficient, a number that sum-
marizes a country’s level of income inequality based on 
how unequally income is distributed across quintiles, 
is used to compare income inequality across countries.
 4. Both means-tested and non-means-tested programs 
reduce poverty. The major in-kind benefits programs 
are Medicare and Medicaid, which pay for medical care. 
Due to concerns about the effects on incentives to work 
and on family cohesion, aid to poor families has become 
significantly less generous even as the negative income 
tax has become more generous. Social Security, the 
largest U.S. welfare state program, has significantly 
reduced poverty among the elderly. Unemployment 
insurance is also a key social insurance program.
 5. Health insurance satisfies an important need because 
most families cannot afford expensive medical 
treatment. Private health insurance, unless it is 
employment-based or carefully screens applicants, has 
the potential to fall into an adverse selection death spi-
ral. Most Americans are covered by employment-based 
private health insurance; the majority of the remaining 
are covered by Medicare (a single-payer system for 
those over 65 in which the government pays for most 
medical bills from tax revenue) or Medicaid (for those 
with low incomes). The percentage of Americans who 
are uninsured has been rising.
 6. Compared to other countries, the United States relies 
more heavily on private health insurance and has sub-
stantially higher health care costs per person without 
clearly providing better care. Health care costs are ris-
ing, largely due to advances in technology. The Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed 
in 2010 with the objectives of reducing the number of 
uninsured and reducing the rate of growth of health 
care costs.
 7. Debates over the size of the welfare state are based 
on philosophical and equity-versus-efficiency consid-
erations. Although high marginal tax rates to finance 
an extensive welfare state can reduce the incentive to 
work, means-testing of programs in order to reduce the 
cost of the welfare state can also reduce the incentive 
to work unless carefully designed to avoid notches.
 8. Politicians on the left tend to favor a bigger welfare 
state and those on the right to oppose it. This left–right 
distinction is central to today’s politics. America’s two 
major political parties have become more polarized in 
recent decades, with a much clearer distinction than in 
the past about where their members stand on the left–
right spectrum.

 a. By what factor has the poverty threshold increased 
from 1983 to 2010? That is, has it doubled, tripled, 
and so on?
 b. By what factor has the CPI (a measure of the overall 
price level) increased from 1983 to 2010? That is, has 
it doubled, tripled, and so on?

 2. In the city of Metropolis, there are 100 residents, each 
of whom lives until age 75. Residents of Metropolis have 
the following incomes over their lifetime: Through age 
14, they earn nothing. From age 15 until age 29, they 
earn 200 metros (the currency of Metropolis) per year. 
From age 30 to age 49, they earn 400 metros. From age 
50 to age 64, they earn 300 metros. Finally, at age 65 
they retire and are paid a pension of 100 metros per 
year until they die at age 75. Each year, everyone con-
sumes whatever their income is that year (that is, there 
is no saving and no borrowing). Currently, 20 residents 
are 10 years old, 20 residents are 20 years old, 20 resi-
dents are 40 years old, 20 residents are 60 years old, and 
20 residents are 70 years old.
 a. Study the income distribution among all residents 
of Metropolis. Split the population into quintiles 
according to their income. How much income does 
a resident in the lowest quintile have? In the sec-
ond, third, fourth, and top quintiles? What share of 
total income of all residents goes to the residents in 
each quintile? Construct a table showing the share 
of total income that goes to each quintile. Does this 
income distribution show inequality?
 b. Now look only at the 20 residents of Metropolis who 
are currently 40 years old, and study the income 
distribution among only those residents. Split those 
20 residents into quintiles according to their income. 
How much income does a resident in the lowest 
quintile have? In the second, third, fourth, and top 
quintiles? What share of total income of all 40-year-
olds goes to the residents in each quintile? Does this 
income distribution show inequality?
 c. What is the relevance of these examples for assess-
ing data on the distribution of income in any 
country?
 3. The accompanying table presents data from the U.S. 
Census Bureau on median and mean income of male 
workers for the years 1972 and 2009. The income fig-
ures are adjusted to eliminate the effect of inflation.

 a. By what percentage has median income changed 
over this period? By what percentage has mean 
income changed over this period?
 b. Between 1972 and 2009, has the income distribution 
become less or more unequal? Explain.
 4. There are 100 households in the economy of Equalor. 
Initially, 99 of them have an income of $10,000 each, 
and one household has an income of $1,010,000.
 a. What is the median income in this economy? What 
is the mean income?
Through its poverty programs, the government of 
Equalor now redistributes income: it takes $990,000 
away from the richest household and distributes it 
equally among the remaining 99 households.
 b. What is the median income in this economy now? 
What is the mean income? Has the median income 
changed? Has the mean income changed? Which 
indicator (mean or median household income) is 
a better indicator of the typical Equalorian house-
hold’s income? Explain.
 5. The country of Marxland has the following income tax 
and social insurance system. Each citizen’s income is 
taxed at an average tax rate of 100%. A social insurance 
system then provides transfers to each citizen such that 
each citizen’s after-tax income is exactly equal. That is, 
each citizen gets (through a government transfer pay-
ment) an equal share of the income tax revenue. What is 
the incentive for one individual citizen to work and earn 
income? What will the total tax revenue in Marxland 
be? What will be the after-tax income (including the 
transfer payment) for each citizen? Do you think such a 
tax system that creates perfect equality will work?
 6. The tax system in Taxilvania includes a negative income 
tax. For all incomes below $10,000, individuals pay an 
income tax of –40% (that is, they receive a payment of 

530    P A R T  8    M I C RO EC O N O M I C S  A N D  P U B L I C  P O L I C Y
40% of their income). For any income above the $10,000 
threshold, the tax rate on that additional income is 
10%. For the first three scenarios below, calculate the 
amount of income tax to be paid and after-tax income.
 a. Lowani earns income of $8,000.
 b. Midram earns income of $40,000.
 c. Hi-Wan earns income of $100,000.
 d. Can you find a notch in this tax system? That is, 
can you find a situation where earning more pre-tax 
income actually results in less after-tax income?
 7. In the city of Notchingham, each worker is paid a 
wage rate of $10 per hour. Notchingham administers 
its own unemployment benefit, which is structured as 
follows: If you are unemployed (that is, if you do not 
work at all), you get unemployment benefits (a transfer 
from the government) of $50 per day. As soon as you 
work for only one hour, the unemployment benefit is 
completely withdrawn. That is, there is a notch in the 
benefit system.
 a. How much income does an unemployed person have 
per day? How much daily income does an individual 
who works four hours per day have? How many 
hours do you need to work to earn just the same as 
if you were unemployed?
 b. Will anyone ever accept a part-time job that requires 
working four hours per day, rather than being 
unemployed?
 c. Suppose that Notchingham now changes the way in 
which the unemployment benefit is withdrawn. For 
each additional dollar an individual earns, $0.50 
of the unemployment benefit is withdrawn. How 
much daily income does an individual who works 
four hours per day now have? Is there an incentive 
now to work four hours per day rather than being 
unemployed?
8. In a private insurance market, there are two different 
kinds of people: some who are more likely to require 
expensive medical treatment and some who are less 
likely to require medical treatment and who, if they do, 
require less expensive treatment. One health insurance 
policy is offered, tailored to the average person’s health 
care needs: the premium is equal to the average per-
son’s medical expenses (plus the insurer’s expenses and 
normal profit).
 a. Explain why such an insurance policy is unlikely to 
be feasible.
In an effort to avoid the adverse selection death spiral, a 
private health insurer offers two health insurance poli-
cies: one that is intended for those who are more likely 
to require expensive treatment (and therefore charges 
a higher premium) and one that is intended for those 
who are less likely to require treatment (and therefore 
charges a lower premium).
 b. Could this system overcome the problem created by 
adverse selection?
 c. How does the British National Health Service (NHS) 
avoid these problems?
 9. The accompanying table shows data on the total num-
ber of people in the United States and the number of 
all people who were uninsured, for selected years from 
1999 to 2009. It also shows data on the total number of 
poor children in the United States—those under 18 and 
below the poverty threshold—and the number of poor 
children who were uninsured.

For each year, calculate the percentage of all people 
who were uninsured and the percentage of poor chil-
dren who were uninsured. How have these percentag-
es changed over time? What is a possible explanation 
for the change in the percentage of uninsured poor 
children?

WHAT YOU

IN THIS 
CHAPTER
531
D
OES HIGHER EDUCATION PAY?
Yes, it does: in the modern econ-
omy, employers are willing to pay a 
premium for workers with more edu-
cation. And the size of that premi-
um has increased a lot over the last 
few decades. Back in 1973 workers 
with advanced degrees, such as law 
degrees or MBAs, earned only 76% 
more than those who had only gradu-
ated from high school. By 2011, the 
premium for an advanced degree had 
risen to over 225%.
Who decided that the wages of work-
ers with advanced degrees would rise 
so much compared with those of high 
school grads? The answer, of course, is 
that nobody decided it. Wage rates are 
prices, the prices of different kinds of 
labor; and they are decided, like other 
prices, by supply and demand.
Still, there is a qualitative difference 
between the wage rate of high school 
grads and the price of used textbooks: 
the wage rate isn’t the price of a good, it’s 
the price of a factor of production. And 
although markets for factors of produc-
tion are in many ways similar to those 
for goods, there are also some important 
differences.
In this chapter, we examine factor 
markets, the markets in which the fac-
tors of production such as labor, land, 
and capital are traded. Factor markets, 
like markets for goods and services, 
play a crucial role in the economy: 
they allocate productive resources to 
producers and help ensure that those 
resources are used efficiently.
This chapter begins by describing 
the major factors of production. Then 
we consider the demand for factors 
of production, which leads us to a 
crucial insight: the marginal productiv-
ity theory of income distribution. We 
then consider some challenges to the 
marginal productivity theory. Next, we 
examine the markets for capital and 
for land. The chapter concludes with 
a discussion of the supply of the most 
important factor, labor.

The Economy’s Factors of Production
Y
ou may recall that we defined a factor of production in Chapter 2 in the 
context of the circular - flow diagram: it is any resource that is used by firms 
to produce goods and services for consumption by households. Factors of 
production are bought and sold in factor markets, and the prices in factor markets 
are known as factor prices.
What are these factors of production, and why do factor prices matter?
The Factors of Production
As we learned in Chapter 2, economists divide factors of production into four 
principal classes: land, labor, physical capital, and human capital. Land is a 
resource provided by nature; labor is the work done by human beings.
In Chapter 9 we defined capital: it is the value of the assets that are used by 
a firm in producing its output. There are two broad types of capital. Physical 
capital—often referred to simply as “capital”—consists of manufactured 
resources such as equipment, buildings, tools, and machines.
In the modern economy, human capital, the improvement in labor created 
by education and knowledge, and embodied in the workforce, is at least equally 
significant. The importance of human capital has been greatly increased by the 
progress of technology, which has made a high level of technical sophistication 
essential to many jobs—one cause of the increased premium paid for workers 
with advanced degrees.
Why Factor Prices Matter: The Allocation of Resources
Factor markets and factor prices play a key role in one of the most important 
processes that must take place in any economy: the allocation of resources 
among producers.
Consider the example of Mississippi and Louisiana in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Katrina, which was the costliest hurricane to hit the U.S. main-
land to date. The states had an urgent need for workers in the building 
trades—carpenters, plumbers, and so on—to repair or replace 
damaged homes and businesses. 
What ensured that those needed workers actually came? 
The factor market: the high demand for workers drove up 
wages. During 2005, the average U.S. weekly wage grew at a 
rate of around 6%. But in areas heavily affected by Katrina, 
the average wage during the fall of 2005 grew by 30% more 
than the national rate, and some areas saw a rate of increase 
twice as high. Over time, these higher wages led large numbers 
of workers with the right skills to move temporarily to these 
states to do the work. In other words, the market for a factor 
of production—construction workers—allocated that factor of 
production to where it was needed.
In this sense factor markets are similar to goods markets, 
which allocate goods among consumers. But there are two 
features that make factor markets special. Unlike in a goods 
market, demand in a factor market is what we call derived 
demand. That is, demand for the factor is derived from the 
firm’s output choice. The second feature is that factor markets 
are where most of us get the largest shares of our income (gov-
ernment transfers being the next largest source of income in 
the economy).
Physical capital—often referred 
to simply as “capital”—consists of 
manufactured productive resources 
such as equipment, buildings, tools, 
and machines.
Human capital is the improvement 
in labor created by education and 
knowledge that is embodied in the 
workforce.
PITFALLS
WHAT IS A FACTOR, ANYWAY?
Imagine a business that produces shirts. The busi-
ness will make use of workers and machines—that 
is, of labor and capital. But it will also use other 
inputs, such as electricity and cloth. Are all of 
these inputs factors of production? No: labor and 
capital are factors of production, but cloth and 
electricity are not.
The key distinction is that a factor of production 
earns income from the selling of its services over 
and over again but an input cannot. For example, a 
worker earns income over time from repeatedly sell-
ing his or her efforts; the owner of a machine earns 
income over time from repeatedly selling the use of 
that machine.
So a factor of production, such as labor and capi-
tal, represents an enduring source of income. An 
input like electricity or cloth, however, is used up in 
the production process. Once exhausted, it cannot 
be a source of future income for its owner.

Factor Incomes and the Distribution of Income
Most American families get most of their income in the form of wages and sala-
ries—that is, they get their income by selling labor. Some people, however, get 
most of their income from physical capital: when you own stock in a company, 
what you really own is a share of that company’s physical capital. And some 
people get much of their income from rents earned on land they own.
Obviously, then, the prices of factors of production have a major impact on 
how the economic “pie” is sliced among different groups. For example, a higher 
wage rate, other things equal, means that a larger proportion of the total income 
in the economy goes to people who derive their income from labor, and less goes 
to those who derive their income from capital or land. Economists refer to how 
the economic pie is sliced as the “distribution of income.” Specifically, factor 
prices determine the factor distribution of income—how the total income of 
the economy is divided among labor, land, and capital.
As the following Economics in Action explains, the factor distribution of income in 
the United States has been quite stable over the past few decades. In other times and 
places, however, large changes have taken place in the factor distribution. One notable 
example: during the Industrial Revolution, the share of total income earned by land-
owners fell sharply, while the share earned by capital owners rose. As explained in the 
following For Inquiring Minds, this shift had a profound effect on society.
The factor distribution of income 
is the division of total income among 
labor, land, and capital.
    ECONOMICS ➤IN ACTION
THE FACTOR DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME 
IN THE UNITED STATES
W
hen we talk about the factor distribution of income, what are we talking 
about in practice?
In the United States, as in all advanced economies, payments to labor 
account for most of the economy’s total income. Figure 19-1 shows the factor 
distribution of income in the United States in 2010: in that year, 68% of total 
income in the economy took the form of “compensation of employees”—a 
Have you read any novels by Jane 
Austen? How about Charles 
Dickens? If you’ve read both, you 
probably noticed that they seem to 
be describing quite different societ-
ies. Austen’s novels, set in England 
around 1800, describe a world in 
which the leaders of society are land -
owning aristocrats. Dickens, writing 
about 50 years later, describes an 
England in which businessmen, espe-
cially factory owners, are in control.
This literary shift reflects a dra-
matic transformation in the fac-
tor distribution of income. The 
Industrial Revolution, which took 
place between the late eighteenth 
century and the middle of the nine-
teenth century, changed England 
from a mainly agricultural country, in 
which land earned a fairly substantial 
share of income, to an urbanized and 
industrial one, in which land rents 
were dwarfed by capital income. 
Recent estimates by the economist 
Nancy Stokey show that between 
1780 and 1850 the share of national 
income represented by land fell from 
20% to 9%, but the share repre-
sented by capital rose from 35% 
to 44%. That shift changed every-
thing—even literature.

By altering how people lived and worked, the 
Industrial Revolution led to huge economic and 
social changes.

number that includes both wages and benefits such as health insur-
ance. This number is somewhat low by historical standards (it was 
72.2% in 1972 and 70.4% in 2007). It reflects the depressed state 
of the economy in 2010, which resulted in high unemployment and 
reduced wages for many American employees.
However, measured wages and benefits don’t capture the full 
income of “labor” because a significant fraction of total income in 
the United States (usually 7 to 10%) is “proprietors’ income”—the 
earnings of people who own their own businesses. Part of that 
income should be considered wages these business owners pay 
themselves. So the true share of labor in the economy is probably 
a few percentage points higher than the reported “compensation of 
employees” share.
But much of what we call compensation of employees is really 
a return on human capital. A surgeon isn’t just supplying the 
services of a pair of ordinary hands (at least the patient hopes 
not!): that individual is also supplying the result of many years 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in training and 
experience. We can’t directly measure what fraction of wages is really a 
payment for education and training, but many economists believe that 
human capital has become the most important factor of production in 
modern economies.

Marginal Productivity and 
Factor Demand
A
ll economic decisions are about comparing costs and benefits—and usually 
about comparing marginal costs and marginal benefits. This goes both for 
a consumer, deciding whether to buy another pound of fried clams, and for 
a producer, deciding whether to hire an additional worker.
Although there are some important exceptions, most factor markets in the 
modern American economy are perfectly competitive, meaning that buyers and 
sellers of a given factor are price - takers. And in a competitive labor market, it’s 
clear how to define an employer’s marginal cost of a worker: it is simply the work-
er’s wage rate. But what is the marginal benefit of that worker? To answer that 
question, we return to a concept first introduced in Chapter 11: the production 
function, which relates inputs to output. And as in Chapter 12, we will assume 
throughout this chapter that all producers are price - takers in their output mar-
kets—that is, they operate in a perfectly competitive industry.

• Economists usually divide the 
economy’s factors of production into 
four principal categories: labor, land, 
physical capital, and human capital.
• The demand for a factor is a derived 
demand. Factor prices, which are 
set in factor markets, determine the 
factor distribution of income. Labor 
receives the bulk—68% in 2010—of 
the income in the modern U.S. econ-
omy. Although the exact share is not 
directly measurable, much of what 
is called compensation of employ-
ees is a return to human capital.

employed on the farm; panel (b) shows how the marginal 
product of labor, the increase in output from employing one 
more worker, depends on the number of workers employed. 
Table 19-1, which reproduces the table in Figure 11-1, shows 
the numbers behind the figure.
Assume that George and Martha want to maximize their 
profit, that workers must be paid $200 each, and that wheat 
sells for $20 per bushel. What is their optimal number of 
workers? That is, how many workers should they employ to 
maximize profit?
In Chapters 11 and 12 we showed how to answer this 
question in several steps. In Chapter 11 we used informa-
tion from the producer’s production function to derive the 
firm’s total cost and its marginal cost. And in Chapter 12 we 
derived the price - taking firm’s optimal output rule: a price - 
taking firm’s profit is maximized by producing the quantity 
of output at which the marginal cost of the last unit pro-
duced is equal to the market price. Having determined the 
optimal quantity of output, we can go back to the produc-
tion function and find the optimal number of workers—it is 
simply the number of workers needed to produce the optimal quantity of output.
There is, however, another way to use marginal analysis to find the number of 
workers that maximizes a producer’s profit. We can go directly to the question of 
what level of employment maximizes profit. This alternative approach is equiva-
lent to the approach we outlined in the preceding paragraph—it’s just a different 
way of looking at the same thing. But it gives us more insight into the demand for 
factors as opposed to the supply of goods.
To see how this alternative approach works, let’s suppose that George and 
Martha are considering whether or not to employ an additional worker. The 
increase in cost from employing that additional worker is the wage rate, W. The 
benefit to George and Martha from employing that extra worker is the value of the

extra output that worker can produce. What is this value? It is the marginal prod-
uct of labor, MPL, multiplied by the price per unit of output, P. This amount—the 
extra value of output that is generated by employing one more unit of labor—is 
known as the value of the marginal product of labor, or VMPL:
(19-1)  Value of the marginal product of labor = VMPL = P × MPL
So should George and Martha hire that extra worker? The answer is yes if the 
value of the extra output is more than the cost of the worker—that is, if VMPL > 
W. Otherwise they shouldn’t hire that worker.
So the decision to hire labor is a marginal decision, in which the marginal 
benefit to the producer from hiring an additional worker (VMPL) should be 
compared with the marginal cost to the producer (W). And as with any marginal 
decision, the optimal choice is where marginal benefit is just equal to marginal 
cost. That is, to maximize profit George and Martha will employ workers up to 
the point at which, for the last worker employed:
(19-2)  VMPL = W at the profit-maximizing level of employment
This rule doesn’t apply only to labor; it applies to any factor of production. The 
value of the marginal product of any factor is its marginal product times the price 
of the good it produces. The general rule is that a profit - maximizing price - taking 
producer employs each factor of production up to the point at which the value of the 
marginal product of the last unit of the factor employed is equal to that factor’s price.
It’s important to realize that this rule doesn’t conflict with our analysis in 
Chapters 11 and 12. There we saw that a profit - maximizing producer of a good 
chooses the level of output at which the price of that good is equal to the mar-
ginal cost of production. It’s just a different way of looking at the same rule. If 
the level of output is chosen so that price equals marginal cost, then it is also 
true that at that output level the value of the marginal product of labor will 
equal the wage rate.
Now let’s look more closely at why choosing the level of employment at which 
the value of the marginal product of the last worker employed is equal to the wage 
rate works—and at how it helps us understand factor demand.
Value of the Marginal Product and Factor Demand
Table 19-2 calculates the value of the marginal product 
of labor on George and Martha’s farm, on the assump-
tion that the price of wheat is $20 per bushel. In Figure 
19-3 the horizontal axis shows the number of work-
ers employed; the vertical axis measures the value of 
the marginal product of labor and the wage rate. The 
curve shown is the value of the marginal product 
curve of labor. This curve, like the marginal product 
of labor curve, slopes downward because of diminish-
ing returns to labor in production. That is, the value 
of the marginal product of each worker is less than 
that of the preceding worker, because the marginal 
product of each worker is less than that of the preced-
ing worker.
We have just seen that to maximize profit, 
George and Martha must hire workers up to the 
point at which the wage rate is equal to the value of 
the marginal product of the last worker employed. 
Let’s use the example to see how this principle 
really works.

The value of the marginal 
product of a factor is the value of 
the additional output generated by 
employing one more unit of that 
factor.
The value of the marginal 
product curve of a factor shows 
how the value of the marginal 
product of that factor depends on 
the quantity of the factor employed.

Assume that George and Martha currently employ 3 workers and that work-
ers must be paid the market wage rate of $200. Should they employ an addi-
tional worker?
Looking at Table 19-2, we see that if George and Martha currently employ 3 
workers, the value of the marginal product of an additional worker is $260. So if 
they employ an additional worker, they will increase the value of their production 
by $260 but increase their cost by only $200, yielding an increased profit of $60. 
In fact, a producer can always increase total profit by employing one more unit 
of a factor of production as long as the value of the marginal product produced 
by that unit exceeds its factor price.
Alternatively, suppose that George and Martha employ 8 workers. By reducing 
the number of workers to 7, they can save $200 in wages. In addition, the value of 
the marginal product of the last one, the 8th worker, was only $100. So, by reduc-
ing employment by one worker, they can increase profit by $200 − $100 = $100. In 
other words, a producer can always increase total profit by employing one less unit 
of a factor of production as long as the value of the marginal product produced by 
that unit is less than the factor price.
Using this method, we can see from Table 19-2 that the profit - maximizing 
employment level is 5 workers given a wage rate of $200. The value of the mar-
ginal product of the 5th worker is $220, so adding the 5th worker results in $20 of 
additional profit. But George and Martha should not hire more than 5 workers: 
the value of the marginal product of the 6th worker is only $180, $20 less than 
the cost of that worker. So, to maximize total profit, George and Martha should 
employ workers up to but not beyond the point at which the value of the marginal 
product of the last worker employed is equal to the wage rate.
Now look again at the value of the marginal product curve in Figure 19-3. 
To determine the profit - maximizing level of employment, we set the value of the 
marginal product of labor equal to the price of labor—a wage rate of $200 per 
worker. This means that the profit - maximizing level of employment is at point A, 
corresponding to an employment level of 5 workers. If the wage rate were higher 
The Value of the Marginal Product Curve
19-3
This curve shows how the value 
of the marginal product of labor 
depends on the number of work-
ers employed. It slopes downward 
because of diminishing returns to 
labor in production. To maximize 
profit, George and Martha choose 
the level of employment at which 
the value of the marginal product 
of labor is equal to the market 
wage rate. For example, at a wage 
rate of $200 the profit-maximizing 
level of employment is 5 workers, 
shown by point A. The value of 
the marginal product curve of a 
factor is the producer’s individual 
demand curve for that factor.

than $200, we would simply move up the curve and reduce the number of workers 
employed; if the wage rate were lower than $200, we would move down the curve 
and increase the number of workers employed.
In this example, George and Martha have a small farm in which the potential 
employment level varies from 0 to 8 workers, and they hire workers up to the point at 
which the value of the marginal product of the last worker is greater than or equal to 
the wage rate. (To go beyond this point and hire workers for which the wage exceeds 
the value of the marginal product would cause George and Martha to lose money.) 
Suppose, however, that the firm in question is large and has the potential of hiring 
many workers. When there are many employees, the value of the marginal product of 
labor falls only slightly when an additional worker is employed. As a result, there will 
be some worker whose value of the marginal product almost exactly equals the wage 
rate. (In keeping with the George and Martha example, this means that some worker 
generates a value of the marginal product of approximately $200.) In this case, the firm 
maximizes profit by choosing a level of employment at which the value of the marginal 
product of the last worker hired equals (to a very good approximation) the wage rate.
In the interest of simplicity, we will assume from now on that firms use this rule 
to determine the profit - maximizing level of employment. This means that the value 
of the marginal product of labor curve is the individual producer’s labor demand curve. 
And, in general, a producer’s value of the marginal product curve for any factor of 
production is that producer’s individual demand curve for that factor of production.
Shifts of the Factor Demand Curve
As in the case of ordinary demand curves, it is important to distinguish between 
movements along the factor demand curve and shifts of the factor demand curve. 
What causes factor demand curves to shift? There are three main causes:
 1. Changes in prices of goods
 2. Changes in supply of other factors
 3. Changes in technology
1. Changes in Prices of Goods Remember that factor demand is derived 
demand: if the price of the good that is produced with a factor changes, so will the 
value of the marginal product of the factor. That is, in the case of labor demand, 
if P changes, VMPL = P × MPL will change at any given level of employment.
Figure 19-4 illustrates the effects of changes in the price of wheat, assuming 
that $200 is the current wage rate. Panel (a) shows the effect of an increase in 
the price of wheat. This shifts the value of the marginal product of labor curve 
upward, because VMPL rises at any given level of employment. If the wage rate 
remains unchanged at $200, the optimal point moves from point A to point B: the 
profit - maximizing level of employment rises.
Panel (b) shows the effect of a decrease in the price of wheat. This shifts the 
value of the marginal product of labor curve downward. If the wage rate remains 
unchanged at $200, the optimal point moves from point A to point C: the profit - 
maximizing level of employment falls.
2. Changes in Supply of Other Factors Suppose that George and Martha 
acquire more land to cultivate—say, by clearing a woodland on their property. 
Each worker now produces more wheat because each one has more land to work 
with. As a result, the marginal product of labor on the farm rises at any given 
level of employment. This has the same effect as an increase in the price of wheat, 
which is illustrated in panel (a) of Figure 19-4: the value of the marginal product 
of labor curve shifts upward, and at any given wage rate the profit - maximizing 
level of employment rises. In contrast, suppose George and Martha cultivate less 
land. This leads to a fall in the marginal product of labor at any given employment 

C H A P T E R  1 9    FAC TO R  M A R K E T S  A N D  T H E  D I S T R I B U T I O N  O F  I N C O M E    539
level. Each worker produces less wheat because each has less land to work with. 
As a result, the value of the marginal product of labor curve shifts downward—as 
in panel (b) of Figure 19-4—and the profit - maximizing level of employment falls.
3. Changes in Technology In general, the effect of technological progress 
on the demand for any given factor can go either way: improved technology can 
either increase or reduce the demand for a given factor of production.
How can technological progress reduce factor demand? Consider horses, 
which were once an important factor of production. The development of sub-
stitutes for horse power, such as automobiles and tractors, greatly reduced the 
demand for horses.
The usual effect of technological progress, however, is to increase the demand 
for a given factor by raising its productivity. So despite persistent fears that 
machinery would reduce the demand for labor, over the long run the U.S. econo-
my has seen both large wage increases and large increases in employment. That’s 
because technological progress has raised labor productivity, and as a result 
increased the demand for labor.
The Marginal Productivity Theory of Income Distribution
We’ve now seen that each perfectly competitive producer in a perfectly competitive 
factor market maximizes profit by hiring labor up to the point at which its value of 
the marginal product is equal to its price—in the case of labor, to the point where 
VMPL = W. What does this tell us about labor’s share in the factor distribution of 
income? To answer that question, we need to examine equilibrium in the labor 
market. From that vantage point we will go on to learn about the markets for land 
and capital and about how they also influence the factor distribution of income.

$200, profit-maximizing employment rises from 5 workers 
to 8 workers, shown by the movement from point A to 
point B. Panel (b) shows the effect of a decrease in the 
price of wheat. The value of the marginal product of labor 
curve shifts downward, from VMPL1 to VMPL3. At the

falls from 5 workers to 2 workers, shown by the move-
ment from point A to point C.

540    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
Let’s start by assuming that the labor market is in equilibrium: at the current 
market wage rate, the number of workers that producers want to employ is equal 
to the number of workers willing to work. Thus, all employers pay the same wage 
rate, and each employer, whatever he or she is producing, employs labor up to the 
point at which the value of the marginal product of the last worker hired is equal 
to the market wage rate.
This situation is illustrated in Figure 19-5, which shows the value of the mar-
ginal product curves of two producers—Farmer Jones, who produces wheat, and 
Farmer Smith, who produces corn. Despite the fact that they produce different 
products, they compete for the same workers and so must pay the same wage 
rate, $200. When both farmers maximize profit, both hire labor up to the point 
at which its value of the marginal product is equal to the wage rate. In the figure, 
this corresponds to employment of 5 workers by Jones and 7 by Smith.
Figure 19-6 illustrates the labor market as a whole. The market labor demand 
curve, like the market demand curve for a good (shown in Figure 3-5), is the hori-
zontal sum of all the individual labor demand curves of all the producers who 
hire labor. And recall that each producer’s individual labor demand curve is the 
same as his or her value of the marginal product of labor curve. For now, let’s 
simply assume an upward- sloping labor supply curve; we’ll discuss labor supply 
later in this chapter. Then the equilibrium wage rate is the wage rate at which the 
quantity of labor supplied is equal to the quantity of labor demanded. In Figure 
19-6, this leads to an equilibrium wage rate of W* and the corresponding equi-
librium employment level of L*. (The equilibrium wage rate is also known as the 
market wage rate.)
And as we showed in the examples of the farms of George and Martha and of 
Farmer Jones and Farmer Smith (where the equilibrium wage rate is $200), each 
farm hires labor up to the point at which the value of the marginal product of 
labor is equal to the equilibrium wage rate. Therefore, in equilibrium, the value 
of the marginal product of labor is the same for all employers. So the equilibrium

(or market) wage rate is equal to the equilibrium value of the marginal prod-
uct of labor—the additional value produced by the last unit of labor employed 
in the labor market as a whole. It doesn’t matter where that additional unit is 
employed, since equilibrium VMPL is the same for all producers.
What we have just learned, then, is that the market wage rate is equal to the 
equilibrium value of the marginal product of labor. And the same is true of each 
factor of production: in a perfectly competitive market economy, the market price 
of each factor is equal to its equilibrium value of the marginal product. Let’s 
examine the markets for land and (physical) capital now. (From this point on, 
we’ll refer to physical capital as simply “capital.”)
The Markets for Land and Capital
If we maintain the assumption that the markets for goods and services are perfect-
ly competitive, the result that we derived for the labor market also applies to other 
factors of production. Suppose, for example, that a farmer is considering whether 
to rent an additional acre of land for the next year. He or she will compare the cost 
of renting that acre with the value of the additional output generated by employing 
an additional acre—the value of the marginal product of an acre of land. To maxi-
mize profit, the farmer must employ land up to the point at which the value of the 
marginal product of an acre of land is equal to the rental rate per acre.
What if the farmer already owns the land? We already saw the answer in 
Chapter 9, which dealt with economic decisions: even if you own land, there is 
an implicit cost—the opportunity cost—of using it for a given activity, because 
it could be used for something else, such as renting it out to other farmers at the 
market rental rate. So a profit - maximizing producer employs additional acres 
of land up to the point at which the cost of the last acre employed, explicit or 
implicit, is equal to the value of the marginal product of that acre.
The same is true for capital. The explicit or implicit cost of using a unit of land 
or capital for a set period of time is called its rental rate. In general, a unit of land 
or capital is employed up to the point at which that unit’s value of the marginal 
Equilibrium in the Labor Market

The market labor demand curve is the horizontal 
sum of the individual labor demand curves of all 
producers. Here the equilibrium wage rate is W*, 
the equilibrium employment level is L*, and every 
producer hires labor up to the point at which 
VMPL = W *. So labor is paid its equilibrium 
value of the marginal product, the value of the 
marginal product of the last worker hired in the 
labor market as a whole.

The equilibrium value of the

The rental rate of either land 
or capital is the cost, explicit or

product is equal to its rental rate over that time period. How are the rental rates for 
land and capital determined? By the equilibria in the land market and the capital 
market, of course. Figure 19-7 illustrates those outcomes.
Panel (a) shows the equilibrium in the market for land. Summing over the 
individual demand curves for land of all producers gives us the market demand 
curve for land. Due to diminishing returns, the demand curve slopes downward, 
like the demand curve for labor. As we have drawn it, the supply curve of land is 
relatively steep and therefore relatively inelastic. This reflects the fact that find-
ing new supplies of land for production is typically difficult and expensive—for 
example, creating new farmland through expensive irrigation. The equilibrium 
rental rate for land, R*Land, and the equilibrium quantity of land employed in pro-
duction, Q*Land, are given by the intersection of the two curves.
Panel (b) shows the equilibrium in the market for capital. In contrast to the 
supply curve for land, the supply curve for capital is relatively elastic. That’s 
because the supply of capital is relatively responsive to price: capital comes from 
the savings of investors, and the amount of savings that investors make available 
is relatively responsive to the rental rate for capital. The equilibrium rental rate 
for capital, R*Capital, and the equilibrium quantity of capital employed in produc-
tion, Q*Capital, are given by the intersection of the two curves.

So we have learned that when the markets for goods and services and the fac-
tor markets are perfectly competitive, a factor of production will be employed 
up to the point at which its value of the marginal product is equal to its market

Panel (a) illustrates equilibrium in the market 
for land; panel (b) illustrates equilibrium in the 
market for capital. The supply curve for land 
is relatively steep, reflecting the high cost of 
increasing the quantity of productive land. 
The supply curve for capital, in contrast, is rela-
tively flat, due to the relatively high responsive-
ness of savings to changes in the rental rate 
for capital. The equilibrium rental rates for 
land and capital, as well as the equilibrium quan-
tities transacted, are given by the intersections 
of the demand and supply curves. In a competi-
tive land market, each unit of land will be paid 
the equilibrium value of the marginal product of 
land, R*Land. Likewise, in a competitive capital 
market, each unit of capital will be paid the 
equilibrium value of the marginal product of 
capital, R*Capital.

equilibrium price. That is, it will be paid its equilibrium value of the marginal 
product. What does this say about the factor distribution of income? It leads us 
to the marginal productivity theory of income distribution, which says that 
each factor is paid the value of the output generated by the last unit of that factor 
employed in the factor market as a whole—its equilibrium value of the marginal 
product.
To understand why the marginal productivity theory of income distribution 
is important, look back at Figure 19-1, which shows the factor distribution of 
income in the United States, and ask yourself this question: who or 
what decided that labor would get 68% of total U.S. income? Why not 
90% or 50%?
The answer, according to the marginal productivity theory of 
income distribution, is that the division of income among the econ-
omy’s factors of production isn’t arbitrary: it is determined by each 
factor’s marginal productivity at the economy’s equilibrium. The wage 
rate earned by all workers in the economy is equal to the increase 
in the value of output generated by the last worker employed in the 
economy - wide labor market.
Here we have assumed that all workers are of the same ability. 
(Similarly, we’ve assumed that all units of land and capital are equally 
productive.) But in reality workers differ considerably in ability.
Rather than thinking of one labor market for all workers in the 
economy, we can instead think of different markets for different types 
of workers, where workers are of equivalent ability within each market. 
For example, the market for computer programmers is different from 
the market for pastry chefs. And in the market for computer program-
mers, all participants are assumed to have equal ability; likewise for 
the market for pastry chefs. In this scenario, the marginal productivity 
theory of income distribution still holds. That is, when the labor market 
for computer programmers is in equilibrium, the wage rate earned by 
all computer programmers is equal to the market’s equilibrium value of the mar-
ginal product—the value of the marginal product of the last computer program-
mer hired in that market.

amill Manufacturing of Pennsylvania makes precision com-
ponents for military helicopters and nuclear submarines. 
Their highly skilled senior machinists are well paid compared to 
other workers in manufacturing, earning nearly $70,000 in 2011, 
excluding benefits. Like most skilled machinists in the United 
States, Hamill’s machinists are very productive: according to 
the U.S. Census Annual Survey of Manufacturers, in 2010 the 
average skilled machinist generated approximately $137,000 in 
value added.
But there is a $67,000 difference between the salary paid 
to Hamill machinists and the value added they generate. Does 
this mean that the marginal productivity theory of income 
distribution doesn’t hold? Doesn’t the theory imply that 
machinists should be paid $137,000, the average value added 
that each one generates?
The answer is no, for two reasons. First, the $137,000 figure is 
averaged over all machinists currently employed. The theory says 
that machinists will be paid the value of the marginal product of 
the last machinist hired, and due to diminishing returns to labor, 
According to the marginal 
productivity theory of income 
distribution, every factor of 
production is paid its equilibrium 
value of the marginal product.
PITFALLS
GETTING MARGINAL 
PRODUCTIVITY THEORY RIGHT
It’s important to be careful about what the 
marginal productivity theory of income dis-
tribution says: it says that all units of a factor 
get paid the factor’s equilibrium value of the 
marginal product—the additional value pro-
duced by the last unit of the factor employed.
The most common source of error is to 
forget that the relevant value of the marginal 
product is the equilibrium value, not the value 
of the marginal products you calculate on the 
way to equilibrium. In looking at Table 19-2, 
you might be tempted to think that because 
the first worker has a value of the marginal 
product of $380, that worker is paid $380 in 
equilibrium. Not so: if the equilibrium value 
of the marginal product in the labor market is 
equal to $200, then all workers receive $200.

that value will be lower than the average over all machinists currently employed. 
Second, a worker’s equilibrium wage rate includes other costs, such as employee 
benefits, that have to be added to the $70,000 salary. The marginal productivity 
theory of income distribution says that workers are paid a wage rate, including all 
benefits, equal to the value of the marginal product.
You can see all these costs are present at Hamill. There the machinists have 
good benefits and job security, which add to their salary. Including these benefits, 
machinists’ total compensation will be equal to the value of the marginal product 
of the last machinist employed. 
In Hamill’s case, there is yet another factor that explains the $67,000 gap: 
there are not enough machinists at the current wage rate. Although the company 
increased the number of employees from 85 in 2004 to 125 in 2011, they would 
like to hire more. Why doesn’t Hamill raise its wages in order to attract more 
skilled machinists? The problem is that the work they do is so specialized that 
it is hard to hire from the outside, even when the company raises wages as an 
inducement. To address this problem, Hamill has spent a significant amount of 
money training each new hire, approximately $125,000 plus the cost of benefits 
per trainee. In the end, it does appear that the marginal productivity theory of 
income distribution holds.

Is the Marginal Productivity Theory of 
Income Distribution Really True?
A
lthough the marginal productivity theory of income distribution is a 
well- established part of economic theory, closely linked to the analysis of 
markets in general, it is a source of some controversy. There are two main 
objections to it.
First, in the real world we see large disparities in income between factors of 
production that, in the eyes of some observers, should receive the same payment. 
Perhaps the most conspicuous examples in the United States are the large differ-
ences in the average wages between women and men and among various racial 
and ethnic groups. Do these wage differences really reflect differences in mar-
ginal productivity, or is something else going on?
Second, many people wrongly believe that the marginal productivity theory 
of income distribution gives a moral justification for the distribution of income, 
implying that the existing distribution is fair and appropriate. This misconcep-
tion sometimes leads other people, who believe that the current distribution of 
income is unfair, to reject marginal productivity theory.
• In a perfectly competitive market 
economy, the price of the good 
multiplied by the marginal product 
of labor is equal to the value of the 
marginal product of labor: VMPL = 
P × MPL. A profit - maximizing pro-
ducer hires labor up to the point 
at which the value of the marginal 
product of labor is equal to the 
wage rate: VMPL = W. The value of 
the marginal product curve of labor 
slopes downward due to diminish-
ing returns to labor in production.
• The market demand curve for labor 
is the horizontal sum of all the indi-
vidual demand curves of producers 
in that market. It shifts for three 
reasons: changes in output price, 
changes in the supply of other fac-
tors, and technological progress.
• As in the case of labor, producers will 
employ land or capital until the point 
at which its value of the marginal 
product is equal to its rental rate. 
According to the marginal productiv-
ity theory of income distribution, in 
a perfectly competitive economy each 
factor of production is paid its equilib-
rium value of the marginal product.

To address these controversies, we’ll start by looking at income disparities 
across gender and ethnic groups. Then we’ll ask what factors might account for 
these disparities and whether these explanations are consistent with the marginal 
productivity theory of income distribution.
Wage Disparities in Practice
Wage rates in the United States cover a very wide range. In 2011, hundreds of 
thousands of workers received the legal federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. At 
the other extreme, the chief executives of several companies were paid more than 
$100 million, which works out to $20,000 per hour even if they worked 100-hour 
weeks. Even leaving out these extremes, there is a huge range of wage rates. Are 
people really that different in their marginal productivities?
A particular source of concern is the existence of systematic wage differences 
across gender and ethnicity. Figure 19-8 compares annual median earnings in 
2010 of workers age 25 or older classified by gender and ethnicity. As a group, 
White males had the highest earnings. Other data show that women (averaging 
across all ethnicities) earned only about 65% as much; African - American workers 
(male and female combined), only 65% as much; Hispanic workers (again, male 
and female combined), only 54% as much.

The U.S. labor market continues to show large dif-
ferences across workers according to gender and 
ethnicity. Women are paid substantially less than 
men; African-American and Hispanic workers are 
paid substantially less than White male workers.

We are a nation founded on the belief that all men are created equal—and if 
the Constitution were rewritten today, we would say that all people are created 
equal. So why do they receive such unequal pay? Let’s start with the marginal 
productivity explanations, then look at other influences.
Marginal Productivity and Wage Inequality
A large part of the observed inequality in wages can be explained by consider-
ations that are consistent with the marginal productivity theory of income distri-
bution. In particular, there are three well - understood sources of wage differences 
across occupations and individuals.

546    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
First is the existence of compensating differentials: across different types 
of jobs, wages are often higher or lower depending on how attractive or unattrac-
tive the job is. Workers with unpleasant or dangerous jobs demand a higher wage 
in comparison to workers with jobs that require the same skill and effort but lack 
the unpleasant or dangerous qualities. For example, truckers who haul hazard-
ous loads are paid more than truckers who haul non-hazardous loads. But for 
any given job, the marginal productivity theory of income distribution generally 
holds true. For example, hazardous - load truckers are paid a wage equal to the 
equilibrium value of the marginal product of the last person employed in the 
labor market for hazardous- load truckers.
A second reason for wage inequality that is clearly consistent with marginal 
productivity theory is differences in talent. People differ in their abilities: a 
higher- ability person, by producing a better product that commands a higher 
price compared to a lower - ability person, generates a higher value of the marginal 
product. And these differences in the value of the marginal product translate into 
differences in earning potential. We all know that this is true in sports: practice is 
important, but 99.99% (at least) of the population just doesn’t have what it takes 
to throw passes like Tom Brady or hit tennis balls like Roger Federer. The same 
is true, though less obvious, in other fields of endeavor.
A third and very important reason for wage differences is differences in the 
quantity of human capital. Recall that human capital—education and training—
is at least as important in the modern economy as physical capital in the form of 
buildings and machines. Different people “embody” quite different quantities of 
human capital, and a person with a higher quantity of human capital typically 
generates a higher value of the marginal product by producing a product that 
commands a higher price. So differences in human capital account for substan-
tial differences in wages. People with high levels of human capital, such as skilled 
surgeons or engineers, generally receive high wages.
The most direct way to see the effect of human capital on wages is to look 
at the relationship between educational levels and earnings. Figure 19-9 shows 
earnings differentials by gender, ethnicity, and three educational levels for people 
age 25 or older in 2010. As you can see, regardless of gender or ethnicity, higher 
Compensating differentials are 
wage differences across jobs that 
reflect the fact that some jobs are 
less pleasant than others.
Earnings Differentials by Education, Gender, and Ethnicity, 2010
19-9
It is clear that, regardless of gender or 
ethnicity, education pays: those with 
a high school diploma earn more than 
those without one, and those with a 
college degree earn substantially more 
than those with only a high school 
diploma. Other patterns are evident 
as well: for any given education level, 
White males earn more than every 
other group, and males earn more than 
females for any given ethnic group.

education is associated with higher median earnings. For example, in 2010 White 
females with 9 to 12 years of schooling but without a high school diploma had 
median earnings 32% less than those with a high school diploma and 65% less 
than those with a college degree—and similar patterns exist for the other five 
groups. Additional data show that surgeons—an occupation that requires steady 
hands and many years of formal training—earned an average of $225,390 in 2010.
Because even now men typically have had more years of education than 
women and Whites more years than non-Whites, differences in level of education 
are part of the explanation for the earnings differences shown in Figure 19-8.
It’s also important to realize that formal education is not the only source 
of human capital; on - the - job training and experience are also very important. 
This point was highlighted by a 2006 National Science Foundation report on 
earnings differences between male and female scientists and engineers. The 
study was motivated by concerns over the male–female earnings gap: the 
median salary for women in science and engineering is about 24% less than 
the median salary for men. The study found that women in these occupations 
are, on average, younger than men and have considerably less experience than 
their male counterparts. This difference in age and experience, according to 
the study, explained most of the earnings differential. Differences in job tenure 
and experience can partly explain one notable aspect of Figure 19-9: across all 
ethnicities, women’s median earnings are less than men’s median earnings for 
any given education level.
But it’s also important to emphasize that earnings differences arising from 
differences in human capital are not necessarily “fair.” A society in which 
non-White children typically receive a poor education because they live in 
underfunded school districts, then go on to earn low wages because they are 
poorly educated, may have labor markets that are well described by marginal 
productivity theory (and would be consistent with the earnings differentials 
across ethnic groups shown in Figure 19-8). Yet many people would still con-
sider the resulting distribution of income unfair.
Still, many observers think that actual wage differentials cannot be entirely 
explained by compensating differentials, differences in talent, and differences in 
human capital. They believe that market power, efficiency wages, and discrimina-
tion also play an important role. We will examine these forces next.
Market Power
The marginal productivity theory of income distribution is based on the assump-
tion that factor markets are perfectly competitive. In such markets we can expect 
workers to be paid the equilibrium value of their marginal product, regardless of 
who they are. But how valid is this assumption?
We studied markets that are not perfectly competitive in Chapters 13, 14, and 
15; now let’s touch briefly on the ways in which labor markets may deviate from 
the competitive assumption.
One undoubted source of differences in wages between otherwise similar 
workers is the role of unions—organizations that try to raise wages and improve 
working conditions for their members. Labor unions, when they are successful, 
replace one- on - one wage deals between workers and employers with collective 
bargaining, in which the employer must negotiate wages with union representa-
tives. Without question, this leads to higher wages for those workers who are 
represented by unions. In 2010 the median weekly earnings of union members in 
the United States were $917, compared with $717 for workers not represented by 
unions—a nearly 30% difference.
Just as workers can sometimes organize to extract higher wages than they 
would otherwise receive, employers can sometimes organize to pay lower wages 
than would result from competition. For example, health care workers—doctors, 
Unions are organizations of workers 
that try to raise wages and improve 
working conditions for their members 
by bargaining collectively with 
employers.

548    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
nurses, and so on—sometimes argue that health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) are engaged in a collective effort to hold down their wages.
How much does collective action, either by workers or by employers, affect 
wages in the modern United States? Several decades ago, when around 30% 
of American workers were union members, unions probably had a significant 
upward effect on wages. Today, however, most economists think unions exert a 
fairly minor influence. Union membership in the United States is relatively lim-
ited: in 2010, less than 7% of the employees of private businesses were represented 
by unions. And although there are fields like health care in which a few large 
firms account for a sizable share of employment in certain geographical areas, 
the sheer size of the U.S. labor market is enormous and the ease with which most 
workers can move in search of higher - paying jobs probably means that concerted 
efforts to hold wages below the unrestrained market equilibrium level rarely 
occur and even more rarely succeed.
Efficiency Wages
A second source of wage inequality is the phenomenon of efficiency wages—a 
type of incentive scheme used by employers to motivate workers to work hard 
and to reduce worker turnover. Suppose a worker performs a job that is extremely 
important but that the employer can observe how well the job is being performed 
only at infrequent intervals—say, serving as a caregiver for the employer’s child. 
Then it often makes sense for the employer to pay more than the worker could 
earn in an alternative job—that is, more than the equilibrium wage. Why? 
Because earning a premium makes losing this job and having to take the alterna-
tive job quite costly for the worker.
So a worker who happens to be observed performing poorly and is therefore 
fired is now worse off for having to accept a lower - paying job. The threat of losing 
a job that pays a premium motivates the worker to perform well and avoid being 
fired. Likewise, paying a premium also reduces worker turnover—the frequency 
with which an employee leaves a job voluntarily. Despite the fact that it may take 
no more effort and skill to be a child’s caregiver than to be an office worker, 
efficiency wages show why it often makes economic sense for a parent to pay a 
caregiver more than the equilibrium wage of an office worker.
The efficiency - wage model explains why we might observe wages offered 
above their equilibrium level. Like the price floors we studied in Chapter 5—
and, in particular, much like the minimum wage—this phenomenon leads to a 
surplus of labor in labor markets that are characterized by the efficiency-wage 
model. This surplus of labor translates into unemployment—some workers 
are actively searching for a high- paying efficiency - wage job but are unable to 
get one, and other more fortunate but no more deserving workers are able to 
acquire one.
As a result, two workers with exactly the same profile—the same skills and 
same job history—may earn unequal wages: the worker who is lucky enough to 
get an efficiency - wage job earns more than the worker who gets a standard job 
(or who remains unemployed while searching for a higher - paying job). Efficiency 
wages are a response to a type of market failure that arises from the fact that 
some employees don’t always perform as well as they should and are able to hide 
that fact. As a result, employers use nonequilibrium wages in order to motivate 
their employees, leading to an inefficient outcome.
Discrimination
It is a real and ugly fact that throughout history there has been discrimination 
against workers who are considered to be of the wrong race, ethnicity, gender, or 
other characteristics. How does this fit into our economic models?
According to the efficiency - wage 
model, some employers pay an 
above - equilibrium wage as an 
incentive for better performance.

C H A P T E R  1 9    FAC TO R  M A R K E T S  A N D  T H E  D I S T R I B U T I O N  O F  I N C O M E    549
The main insight economic analysis offers is that discrimination is not a 
natural consequence of market competition. On the contrary, market forces 
tend to work against discrimination. To see why, consider the incentives that 
would exist if social convention dictated that women be paid, say, 30% less 
than men with equivalent qualifications and experience. A company whose 
management was itself unbiased would then be able to reduce its costs by hir-
ing women rather than men—and such companies would have an advantage 
over other companies that hired men despite their higher cost. The result 
would be to create an excess demand for female workers, which would tend to 
drive up their wages.
But if market competition works against discrimination, how is it that 
so much discrimination has taken place? The answer is twofold. First, when 
labor markets don’t work well, employers may have the ability to discriminate 
without hurting their profits. For example, market interferences (such as 
unions or minimum - wage laws) or market failures (such as efficiency wages) 
can lead to wages that are above their equilibrium levels. In these cases, there 
are more job applicants than there are jobs, leaving employers free to dis-
criminate among applicants. In 2011, with unemployment over 9%, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency tasked with inves-
tigating employment discrimination charges, reported that the complaints 
from workers and job-seekers had hit an all-time high, the most logged in the 
agency’s 46-year history.
In research published in the American Economic Review, two economists, 
Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, documented discrimina-
tion in hiring by sending fictitious résumés to prospective employers on 
The Republic of South Africa is the 
richest nation in Africa, but it also 
has a harsh political history. Until the 
peaceful transition to majority rule in 
1994, the country was controlled by its 
White minority, Afrikaners, who are the 
descendants of European (mainly Dutch) 
immigrants. This minority imposed an 
economic system known as apartheid, 
which overwhelmingly favored White 
interests over those of native Africans 
and other groups considered “non-
White,” such as Asians.
The origins of apartheid go back to 
the early years of the twentieth century, 
when large numbers of White farmers 
began moving into South Africa’s grow-
ing cities. There they discovered, to their 
horror, that they did not automatically 
earn higher wages than other races. 
But they had the right to vote—and 
non-Whites did not. And so the South 
African government instituted “job - 
reservation” laws designed to ensure 
that only Whites got jobs that paid well. 
The government also set 
about creating jobs for 
Whites in government -
owned industries. As 
Allister Sparks notes in 
The Mind of South Africa 
(1990), in its efforts to pro-
vide high - paying jobs for 
Whites, the country “even-
tually acquired the largest 
amount of nationalized 
industry of any country out-
side the Communist bloc.”
In other words, racial 
discrimination was possi-
ble because it was backed 
by the power of the gov-
ernment, which prevented 
markets from following their 
natural course.
A postscript: In 1994, in 
one of the political miracles of modern 
times, the White regime ceded power 
and South Africa became a full - fledged 
democracy. Apartheid was abolished. 
Unfortunately, large racial differences 
in earnings remain. The main reason is 
that apartheid created huge disparities 
in human capital, which will persist for 
many years to come.

Although abolished, apartheid has left behind a legacy of 
large racial differences in earnings that will likely persist for 
many years.

a random basis. Applicants with “White - sounding” names such as Emily 
Walsh were 50% more likely to be contacted than applicants with “African- 
American - sounding” names such as Lakisha Washington. Also, applicants 
with White - sounding names and good credentials were much more likely 
to be contacted than those without such credentials. By contrast, potential 
employers seemed to ignore the credentials of applicants with African - 
American - sounding names.
Second, discrimination has sometimes been institutionalized in government 
policy. This institutionalization of discrimination has made it easier to maintain 
it against market pressure, and historically it is the form that discrimination has 
typically taken. For example, at one time in the United States, African - Americans 
were barred from attending “Whites - only” public schools and universities in 
many parts of the country and forced to attend inferior schools. Although mar-
ket competition tends to work against current discrimination, it is not a remedy 
for past discrimination, which typically has had an impact on the education 
and experience of its victims and thereby reduces their income. The following 
Economics in Action illustrates the way in which government policy enforced 
discrimination in the world’s most famous racist regime, that of the former gov-
ernment of South Africa.
So Does Marginal Productivity Theory Work?
The main conclusion you should draw from this discussion is that the marginal 
productivity theory of income distribution is not a perfect description of how 
factor incomes are determined but that it works pretty well. The deviations are 
important. But, by and large, in a modern economy with well - functioning labor 
markets, factors of production are paid the equilibrium value of the marginal 
product—the value of the marginal product of the last unit employed in the mar-
ket as a whole.
It’s important to emphasize, once again, that this does not mean that the fac-
tor distribution of income is morally justified.

MARGINAL PRODUCTIVITY AND THE “1%”
I
n the fall of 2011, there were widespread public dem-
onstrations in the United States and in a number of 
other countries against the growing inequality of personal 
income. U.S. protestors, known as the Occupy Wall Street 
movement, adopted the slogan “We are the 99%” to empha-
size the fact that the incomes of the top 1% of the population 
had grown much faster than those of most Americans. 
Indeed, just as the protest movement was gathering 
strength, the Congressional Budget Office released a study 
on income inequality. The CBO found that, between 1979 
and 2007, the income of the average household headed by 
a worker with a high school degree fell by 7.8%, while the 
income of the average household headed by a worker with 
an advanced degree rose by 24.3%. But the average income 
of the top 1% of households had risen 277.5%.
Why have the richest Americans been pulling away from 
the rest? The short answer is that the causes are a source 
of considerable dispute and continuing research. One thing 
is clear, however: this aspect of growing inequality can’t be 
explained simply in terms of the growing demand for highly

educated labor. In this chapter’s opening story, we pointed out that there has 
been a growing wage premium for workers with advanced degrees. Yet despite 
this growing premium, as the Figure 19-10 shows, such workers have seen only 
a fraction of the gains going to the top 1%.
This does not prove that the top 1% aren’t “earning” their incomes. It does show, 
however, that whatever the explanation for their huge gains, it’s not education.

The Supply of Labor
U
p to this point we have focused on the demand for factors, which deter-
mines the quantities demanded of labor, capital, or land by producers as a 
function of their factor prices. What about the supply of factors?
In this section we focus exclusively on the supply of labor. We do this for two 
reasons. First, in the modern U.S. economy, labor is the most important factor 
of production, accounting for most of factor income. Second, as we’ll see, labor 
supply is the area in which factor markets look most different from markets for 
goods and services.
Work versus Leisure
In the labor market, the roles of firms and households are the reverse of what they 
are in markets for goods and services. A good such as wheat is supplied by firms 
and demanded by households; labor, though, is demanded by firms and supplied 
by households. How do people decide how much labor to supply?
As a practical matter, most people have limited control over their work hours: 
either you take a job that involves working a set number of hours per week, or you 
don’t get the job at all. To understand the logic of labor supply, however, it helps 
to put realism to one side for a bit and imagine an individual who can choose to 
work as many or as few hours as he or she likes.
Why wouldn’t such an individual work as many hours as possible? Because 
workers are human beings, too, and have other uses for their time. An hour spent 
on the job is an hour not spent on other, presumably more pleasant, activities. So 
the decision about how much labor to supply involves making a decision about 
time allocation—how many hours to spend on different activities.
By working, people earn income that they can use to buy goods. The more 
hours an individual works, the more goods he or she can afford to buy. But this 
increased purchasing power comes at the expense of a reduction in leisure, the 
time spent not working. (Leisure doesn’t necessarily mean time spent goofing off. 
It could mean time spent with one’s family, pursuing hobbies, exercising, and so 
on.) And though purchased goods yield utility, so does leisure. Indeed, we can 
think of leisure itself as a normal good, which most people would like to consume 
more of as their incomes increase.
 Quick Review
• Existing large disparities in wages 
both among individuals and across 
groups lead some to question the 
marginal productivity theory of 
income distribution.
• Compensating differentials, as 
well as differences in the values of 
the marginal products of workers 
that arise from differences in talent, 
job experience, and human capital, 
account for some wage disparities.
• Market power, in the form of unions 
or collective action by employers, 
as well as the efficiency- wage 
model, in which employers pay an 
above-equilibrium wage to induce 
better performance, also explain 
how some wage disparities arise.
• Discrimination has historically been 
a major factor in wage disparities. 
Market competition tends to work 
against discrimination. But discrimina-
tion can leave a long-lasting legacy of 
diminished human capital acquisition.
Decisions about labor supply 
result from decisions about time 
allocation: how many hours to 
spend on different activities.
Leisure is time available for 
purposes other than earning money 
to buy marketed goods.

How does a rational individual decide how much leisure to consume? By mak-
ing a marginal comparison, of course. In analyzing consumer choice, we asked 
how a utility - maximizing consumer uses a marginal dollar. In analyzing labor 
supply, we ask how an individual uses a marginal hour.
Consider Clive, an individual who likes both leisure and the goods money can 
buy. Suppose that his wage rate is $10 per hour. In deciding how many hours he 
wants to work, he must compare the marginal utility of an additional hour of 
leisure with the additional utility he gets from $10 worth of goods. If $10 worth 
of goods adds more to his total utility than an additional hour of leisure, he 
can increase his total utility by giving up an hour of leisure in order to work an 
additional hour. If an extra hour of leisure adds more to his total utility than $10 
worth of goods, he can increase his total utility by working one fewer hour in 
order to gain an hour of leisure.
At Clive’s optimal labor supply choice, then, his marginal utility of one hour of 
leisure is equal to the marginal utility he gets from the goods that his hourly wage 
can purchase. This is very similar to the optimal consumption rule we encoun-
tered in Chapter 10, except that it is a rule about time rather than money.
Our next step is to ask how Clive’s decision about time allocation is affected 
when his wage rate changes.
Wages and Labor Supply
Suppose that Clive’s wage rate doubles, from $10 to $20 per hour. How will he 
change his time allocation?
You could argue that Clive will work longer hours, because his incentive to 
work has increased: by giving up an hour of leisure, he can now gain twice as 
much money as before. But you could equally well argue that he will work less, 
because he doesn’t need to work as many hours to generate the income to pay for 
the goods he wants.
As these opposing arguments suggest, the quantity of labor Clive supplies 
can either rise or fall when his wage rate rises. To understand why, let’s recall 
the distinction between substitution effects and income effects that we learned in 
Chapter 10 and its appendix. We saw there that a price change affects consumer 
choice in two ways: by changing the opportunity cost of a good in terms of other 
goods (the substitution effect) and by making the consumer richer or poorer (the 
income effect).
Now think about how a rise in Clive’s wage rate affects his demand for lei-
sure. The opportunity cost of leisure—the amount of money he gives up by tak-
ing an hour off instead of working—rises. That substitution effect gives him an 
incentive, other things equal, to consume less leisure and work longer hours. 
Conversely, a higher wage rate makes Clive richer—and this income effect leads 
him, other things equal, to want to consume more leisure and work fewer hours, 
because leisure is a normal good.
So in the case of labor supply, the substitution effect and the income effect 
work in opposite directions. If the substitution effect is so powerful that it 
dominates the income effect, an increase in Clive’s wage rate leads him to sup-
ply more hours of labor. If the income effect is so powerful that it dominates 
the substitution effect, an increase in the wage rate leads him to supply fewer 
hours of labor.
We see, then, that the individual labor supply curve—the relationship 
between the wage rate and the number of hours of labor supplied by an individual 
worker—does not necessarily slope upward. If the income effect dominates, a 
higher wage rate will reduce the quantity of labor supplied.
Figure 19-11 illustrates the two possibilities for labor supply. If the substitu-
tion effect dominates the income effect, the individual labor supply curve slopes 
upward; panel (a) shows an increase in the wage rate from $10 to $20 per hour 
The individual labor supply curve 
shows how the quantity of labor 
supplied by an individual depends on 
that individual’s wage rate.

leading to a rise in the number of hours worked from 40 to 50. However, if the 
income effect dominates, the quantity of labor supplied goes down when the wage 
rate increases. Panel (b) shows the same rise in the wage rate leading to a fall in 
the number of hours worked from 40 to 30. (Economists refer to an individual 
labor supply curve that contains both upward - sloping and downward - sloping seg-
ments as a “backward - bending labor supply curve”—a concept that we analyze in 
detail in this chapter’s appendix.)
Is a negative response of the quantity of labor supplied to the wage rate a real 
possibility? Yes: many labor economists believe that income effects on the supply

When the substitution effect of a wage increase domi-
nates the income effect, the individual labor supply curve 
slopes upward, as in panel (a). Here a rise in the wage 
rate from $10 to $20 per hour increases the number of 
hours worked from 40 to 50. But when the income effect 
of a wage increase dominates the substitution effect, 
the individual labor supply curve slopes downward, as in 
panel (b). Here the same rise in the wage rate reduces 
the number of hours worked from 40 to 30. The individ-
ual labor supply curve shows how the quantity of labor 
supplied by an individual depends on that individual’s 
wage rate.
Everyone says that you can’t find a taxi 
in New York when you really need one—
say, when it’s raining. That could be 
because everyone else is trying to get 
a taxi at the same time. But according 
to a study published in the Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, it’s more than 
that: cab drivers actually go home early 
when it’s raining.
The reason is that the hourly wage 
rate of a taxi driver depends on the 
weather: when it’s raining, drivers get 
more fares and therefore earn more per 
hour. But it seems that the income effect 
of this higher wage rate outweighs the 
substitution effect.
This behavior leads the authors of 
the study to question drivers’ rationality. 
They point out that if taxi drivers thought 
in terms of the long run, they would real-
ize that rainy days and nice days tend to 
average out and that their high earnings 
on a rainy day don’t really affect their 
long - run income very much. Indeed, 
experienced drivers (who have probably 
figured this out) are less likely than inex-
perienced drivers to go home early on a 
rainy day. But leaving such issues to one 
side, the study does seem to show clear 
evidence of a labor supply curve that 
slopes downward instead of upward, 
thanks to income effects.

of labor may be somewhat stronger than substitution effects. The most compel-
ling piece of evidence for this belief comes from Americans’ increasing consump-
tion of leisure over the past century. At the end of the nineteenth century, wages 
adjusted for inflation were only about one - eighth what they are today; the typical 
workweek was 70 hours, and very few workers retired at age 65. Today the typical 
workweek is less than 40 hours, and most people retire at age 65 or earlier. So it 
seems that Americans have chosen to take advantage of higher wages in part by 
consuming more leisure.
Shifts of the Labor Supply Curve
Now that we have examined how income and substitution effects shape the indi-
vidual labor supply curve, we can turn to the market labor supply curve. In any 
labor market, the market supply curve is the horizontal sum of the individual 
labor supply curves of all workers in that market. A change in any factor other 
than the wage that alters workers’ willingness to supply labor causes a shift of the 
labor supply curve. A variety of factors can lead to such shifts, including changes 
in preferences and social norms, changes in population, changes in opportuni-
ties, and changes in wealth.
Changes in Preferences and Social Norms Changes in preferences 
and social norms can lead workers to increase or decrease their willing-
ness to work at any given wage. A striking example of this phenomenon is 
the large increase in the number of employed women—particularly married 
employed women—that has occurred in the United States since the 1960s. 
Until that time, women who could afford to largely avoided working outside 
the home. Changes in preferences and norms in post–World War II America 
(helped along by the invention of labor - saving home appliances such as wash-
ing machines, increasing urbanization of the population, and higher female 
education levels) have induced large numbers of American women to join the 
workforce—a phenomenon often repeated in other countries that experience 
similar social and technological forces.
Changes in Population Changes in the population size generally lead 
to shifts of the labor supply curve. A larger population tends to shift the labor sup-
ply curve rightward as more workers are available at any given wage; a smaller 
population tends to shift the labor supply curve leftward. From 1990 to 2008, the 
U.S. labor force has grown approximately 1% per year, generated by immigration 
and a relatively high birth rate. As a result, from 1990 to a 2008 the U.S. labor mar-
ket had a rightward-shifting labor supply curve. However, while the population 
continued to grow after 2008, the size of the labor force began to shrink beginning 
in 2009 as workers, disillusioned by bad job prospects, left the labor force. As a 
result, since 2009 the U.S. labor supply curve has been shifting leftward.
Changes in Opportunities At one time, teaching was the only occupation 
considered suitable for well - educated women. However, as opportunities in other 
professions opened up to women starting in the 1960s, many women left teach-
ing and potential female teachers chose other careers. This generated a leftward 
shift of the supply curve for teachers, reflecting a fall in the willingness to work at 
any given wage and forcing school districts to pay more to maintain an adequate 
teaching staff. These events illustrate a general result: when superior alternatives 
arise for workers in another labor market, the supply curve in the original labor 
market shifts leftward as workers move to the new opportunities. Similarly, when 
opportunities diminish in one labor market—say, layoffs in the manufacturing 
industry due to increased foreign competition—the supply in alternative labor 
markets increases as workers move to these other markets.

Changes in Wealth A person whose wealth increases will buy more normal 
goods, including leisure. So when a class of workers experiences a general rise in 
their wealth levels—say, due to a stock market boom—the income effect from the 
wealth increase will shift the labor supply curve associated with those workers 
leftward as workers consume more leisure and work less. Note that the income 
effect caused by a change in wealth shifts the labor supply curve, but the income 
effect from a wage rate increase—as we discussed in the case of the individual 
labor supply curve—is a movement along the labor supply curve. The following 
Economics in Action illustrates how such a change in the wealth levels of many 
families during the late 1990s led to a shift of the market labor supply curve asso-
ciated with their employable children.

THE DECLINE OF THE SUMMER JOB
C
ome summertime, resort towns along the New Jersey shore find them-
selves facing a recurring annual problem: a serious shortage of life-
guards. Traditionally, lifeguard positions, together with many other seasonal 
jobs, had been filled mainly by high school and college students. But in 
recent years a combination of adverse shifts in supply and demand have 
severely diminished summer employment for young workers. In 1979, 71% 
of Americans between the ages of 16 and 19 were in the summer workforce. 
By 2007, that number was 42%, and by 2011 it had taken another sharp fall 
to around 25%.
Americans today may work less than they did a hundred 
years ago, but they still work more than workers in any other 
industrialized country.
This figure compares average annual hours worked in 
the United States with those worked in other industrial-
ized countries. The differences result from a combination 
of Americans’ longer workweeks and shorter vacations. For 
example, the great majority of full-time American workers put 
in at least 40 hours per week. Until recently, however, a gov-
ernment mandate limited most French workers to a 35-hour 
workweek; collective bargaining has achieved a similar 
reduction in the workweek for many German workers.
In 2011, American workers got, on average, eight paid 
vacation days, but 23% of American workers got none at 
all. In contrast, German workers are guaranteed six weeks 
of paid vacation a year. Also, American workers use fewer 
of the vacation days they are entitled to than do workers in 
other industrialized countries. A 2011 survey found that only 
57% of American workers use all the vacation days they are 
entitled to, compared to 89% in France. 
Why do Americans work so much more than others? 
Unlike their counterparts in other industrialized countries, 
Americans are not legally entitled to paid vacation days; 
as a result, the average American worker gets fewer of 
them. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that during 
the recent recession, with its high rates of unemployment, 
American workers became more reluctant to use the vaca-
tion days they were entitled to.

A fall in supply is one explanation for the 
change. More students now feel that they should 
devote their summer to additional study rather 
than to work. An increase in household afflu-
ence over the past 20 years has also contributed 
to fewer teens taking jobs because they no longer 
feel pressured to contribute to household financ-
es. In other words, the income effect has led to a 
reduced labor supply.
Another explanation is the substitution effect: 
increased competition from immigrants, who are 
now doing the jobs typically done by teens (like 
mowing lawns and delivering pizzas), has led to a 
decline in wages. So many teenagers have forgone 
summer work to consume leisure instead.
But it was the deep recession of 2007–2009 that 
contributed most to the severe fall in youth summer 
employment in the ensuing years. By 2010 and 2011, 
cutbacks in employment by private employers, as well as in local and state govern-
ment programs that hired teens during the summer, had led to the lowest number 
of teens employed during the summer in decades. Thus a steep fall in demand, 
along with a long-run trend of falling supply, has led to the decline of what was 
once a summer tradition.

• The choice of how much labor to sup-
ply is a problem of time allocation: a 
choice between work and leisure.
• A rise in the wage rate causes both 
an income and a substitution effect 
on an individual’s labor supply. The 
substitution effect of a higher wage 
rate induces more hours of work 
supplied, other things equal. This 
is countered by the income effect: 
higher income leads to a higher 
demand for leisure, a normal good. 
If the income effect dominates, a rise 
in the wage rate can actually cause 
the individual labor supply curve to 
slope the “wrong” way: downward.
• The market labor supply curve is 
the horizontal sum of the individual 
labor supply curves of all workers in 
that market. It shifts for four main 
reasons: changes in preferences 
and social norms, changes in popu-
lation, changes in opportunities, 
and changes in wealth.
 Quick Review

Check out a T-shirt or sweatshirt emblazoned with your school’s logo at your 
campus bookstore, and the odds are very good that it was made by Alta Gracia, 
the leading supplier of college-logo apparel to American universities. Alta 
Gracia is owned by Knights Apparel, a company based in Spartanburg, South 
Carolina, that manufactures apparel in 30 factories around the world. The Alta 
Gracia factory is located in the Dominican Republic, where 120 employees turn 
out T-shirts and sweats.
Workers at Alta Gracia consider themselves lucky because the company pays 
what it considers a “living wage”—suf ficient to feed and shelter a family of four—
and allows workers to join a union. Seamstress Santa Castillo, for example, earns 
$500 a month, three times the average monthly pay of $147 earned by apparel 
workers in the Dominican Republic, where a loaf of bread costs $1. 
Workers at the factory have not always been so fortunate. When the factory 
was owned by another company, BJ&B, which made baseball caps for Nike and 
Reebok, workers were paid the prevailing wage and were fired if they complained 
about working conditions or tried to form a union. Eventually, BJ&B moved its 
operations to lower-wage Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is 15 cents an 
hour, compared to 85 cents an hour in the Dominican Republic. In contrast, Alta 
Gracia pays $2.83 an hour. 
Joe Bozich started Knights Apparel in 2000; through scores of deals he has 
made with universities, his company has surpassed Nike as the number-one 
college supplier. He works closely with the Worker Rights Consortium, a group 
of 186 universities that press college-logo apparel manufacturers to improve 
workers’ welfare. The consortium is part of the “Fair Trade Movement,” an orga-
nization dedicated to improving the welfare of workers in developing countries, 
principally by raising wages. In 2010, $6 billion of Fair Trade–approved goods 
were sold globally, up 27% from 2009. 
Alta Gracia was conceived by Bozich as a model factory to show that an appar-
el manufacturer could pay its workers a living wage and still succeed when com-
petitors are paying their workers much less. Its production cost for a T-shirt is 
$4.80—80 cents, or 20%, higher than if it paid minimum wage. Knights Apparel 
accepts a lower profit margin so it doesn’t have to ask retailers to pay a higher 
wholesale price for its merchandise. 
Some observers, though, are skeptical because Alta Gracia merchandise is 
sold alongside products made by Nike and Adidas, at approximately the same 
premium price these well-known brands command. “It’s a noble effort, but it is 
an experiment,” says Andrew Jassin, an industry analyst. “There are consumers 
who really care and will buy this apparel at a premium price, and there are those 
who say they care, but just want value.” 
Kellie McElhaney, a professor of corporate social responsibility at the 
University of California at Berkeley, is less skeptical: “A lot of college students 
would much rather pay for a brand that shows workers are treated well.”
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Use the marginal productivity theory of income distribution to explain how the prevailing 
wage for apparel workers can fall below a living wage in the Dominican Republic.
 2. From the point of view of Knights Apparel, what are the pros and cons of paying the Alta 
Gracia workers a living wage? What are the pros and cons from the point of view of work-
ers generally?
 3. What factors does the success or failure of Alta Gracia depend on? What should Knights 
Apparel do to improve its chances of success?

SUMMARY
 1. Just as there are markets for goods and services, 
there are markets for factors of production, includ-
ing labor, land, and both physical capital and 
human capital. These markets determine the factor 
distribution of income.
 2. Profit - maximizing price - taking producers will 
employ a factor up to the point at which its price 
is equal to its value of the marginal product—
the marginal product of the factor multiplied by 
the price of the output it produces. The value of 
the marginal product curve is therefore the indi-
vidual price - taking producer’s demand curve for 
a factor.
 3. The market demand curve for labor is the horizontal 
sum of the individual demand curves of producers in 
that market. It shifts for three main reasons: changes 
in output price, changes in the supply of other factors, 
and technological changes.
 4. When a competitive labor market is in equilibrium, 
the market wage is equal to the equilibrium value of 
the marginal product of labor, the additional value 
produced by the last worker hired in the labor market 
as a whole. The same principle applies to other factors 
of production: the rental rate of land or capital is 
equal to the equilibrium value of the marginal prod-
ucts. This insight leads to the marginal productivity 
theory of income distribution, according to which 
each factor is paid the value of the marginal product 
of the last unit of that factor employed in the factor 
market as a whole.
 5. Large disparities in wages raise questions about 
the validity of the marginal productivity theory 
of income distribution. Many disparities can be 
explained by compensating differentials and by 
differences in talent, job experience, and human 
capital across workers. Market interference in 
the forms of unions and collective action by employ-
ers also creates wage disparities. The efficiency - 
wage model, which arises from a type of market 
failure, shows how wage disparities can result 
from employers’ attempts to increase worker per-
formance. Free markets tend to diminish discrimi-
nation, but discrimination remains a real source 
of wage disparity, especially through its effects on 
human captial acquisition. Discrimination is typi-
cally maintained either through problems in labor 
markets or (historically) through institutionalization 
in government policies.
 6. Labor supply is the result of decisions about time 
allocation, where each worker faces a trade - off 
between leisure and work. An increase in the 
hourly wage rate tends to increase work hours via 
the substitution effect but to reduce work hours via 
the income effect. If the net result is that a worker 
increases the quantity of labor supplied in response 
to a higher wage, the individual labor supply 
curve slopes upward. If the net result is that a 
worker reduces work hours, the individual labor 
supply curve—unlike supply curves for goods and 
services—slopes downward.
 7. The market labor supply curve is the horizontal 
sum of the individual labor supply curves of all 
workers in that market. It shifts for four main rea-
sons: changes in preferences and social norms, 
changes in population, changes in opportunities, 
and changes in wealth.

quantity of output she can use more labor and less 
land; similarly, to produce the same quantity of out-
put she can use less labor and more land. However, 
if she uses more land, she must use more of both 
labor and capital; if she uses less land, she can use 
less of both labor and capital. Let w* represent the

Indifference Curve 
Analysis of Labor Supply
In the body of this chapter, we explained why the labor supply curve can slope 
downward instead of upward: the substitution effect of a higher wage rate, which 
provides an incentive to work longer hours, can be outweighed by the income 
effect of a higher wage rate, which may lead individuals to consume more leisure. 
In this appendix we show how this analysis can be carried out using the indiffer-
ence curves introduced in the appendix to Chapter 10.
The Time Allocation Budget Line
L
et’s return to the example of Clive, who likes leisure but also likes having 
money to spend. We now assume that Clive has a total of 80 hours per week 
that he could spend either working or enjoying as leisure time. (The remain-
ing hours in his week, we assume, are taken up with necessary activities, mainly 
sleeping.) Let’s also assume, initially, that his hourly wage rate  is $10.
His consumption possibilities are defined by the time allocation budget 
line in Figure 19A-1, a budget line that shows Clive’s trade-offs between con-
sumption of leisure and income. Hours of leisure per week are measured on the 
horizontal axis, and the money he earns from working is measured on the verti-
cal axis.
The horizontal intercept, point X, is at 80 hours: if Clive didn’t work at all, 
he would have 80 hours of leisure per week but would not earn any money. The 
vertical intercept, point Y, is at $800: if Clive worked all the time, he would earn 
$800  per week.
Why can we use a budget line to describe Clive’s time allocation choice? The 
budget lines found in Chapter 10 and its appendix represent the trade-offs facing

CHAPTER
APPENDIX
563
A time allocation budget line 
shows an individual’s trade-off 
between consumption of leisure and 
the income that allows consumption 
of marketed goods.
The Time Allocation Budget Line
19A-1
Clive’s time allocation budget line shows his trade-
off between work, which pays a wage rate of $10 per 
hour, and leisure. At point X he allocates all his time, 
80 hours, to leisure but has no income. At point Y he 
allocates all his time to work, earning $800, but con-
sumes no leisure. His hourly wage rate of $10, the 
opportunity cost of an hour of leisure, is equal to minus 
the slope of the time allocation budget line. We have 
assumed that point A, at 40 hours of leisure and $400 
in income, is Clive’s optimal time allocation choice. It 
obeys the optimal time allocation rule: the additional 
utility Clive gets from one more hour of leisure must 
equal the additional utility he gets from the goods he 
can purchase with one hour’s wages.

consumers deciding how to allocate their income among different goods. Here, 
instead of asking how Clive allocates his income, we ask how he allocates his 
time. But the principles underlying the allocation of income and the allocation 
of time are the same: each involves allocating a fixed amount of a resource (80 
hours of time in this case) with a constant trade-off (Clive must forgo $10 for each 
additional hour of leisure). So using a budget line is just as appropriate for time 
allocation as it is for income allocation.
As in the case of ordinary budget lines, opportunity cost plays a key role. The 
opportunity cost of an hour of leisure is what Clive must forgo by working one 
less hour—$10 in income. This opportunity cost is, of course, Clive’s hourly wage 
rate and is equal to minus the slope of his time allocation budget line. You can 
verify this by noting that the slope is equal to minus the vertical intercept, point 
Y, divided by the horizontal intercept, point X—that is, −$800/(80 hours) = −$10 
per hour.
To maximize his utility, Clive must choose the optimal point on the time allo-
cation budget line in Figure 19A-1. In Chapter 10 we saw that a consumer who 
allocates spending to maximize utility finds the point on the budget line that 
satisfies the utility-maximizing principle of marginal analysis: the marginal util-
ity per dollar spent on two goods must be equal. Although Clive’s choice involves 
allocating time rather than money, the same principles apply.
Since Clive “spends” time rather than money, the counterpart of the utility-
maximizing principle of marginal analysis is the optimal time allocation rule: 
the marginal utility Clive gets from the extra money earned from an additional hour 
spent working must equal the marginal utility of an additional hour of  leisure.
The Effect of a Higher Wage Rate 
D
epending on his tastes, Clive’s utility - maximizing choice of hours of leisure 
and income could lie anywhere on the time allocation budget line in Figure 
19A-1. Let’s assume that his optimal choice is point A, at which he con-
sumes 40 hours of leisure and earns $400. Now we are ready to link the analysis 
of time allocation to labor  supply.
When Clive chooses a point like A on his time allocation budget line, he is also 
choosing the quantity of labor he supplies to the labor market. By choosing to 
consume 40 of his 80 available hours as leisure, he has also chosen to supply the 
other 40 hours  as labor.
Now suppose that Clive’s wage rate doubles, from $10 to $20 per hour. The 
effect of this increase in his wage rate is shown in Figure 19A-2. His time allo-
cation budget line rotates outward: the vertical intercept, which represents the 
amount he could earn if he devoted all 80 hours to work, shifts upward from 
point Y to point Z. As a result of the doubling of his wage, Clive would earn $1,600 
instead of $800 if he devoted all 80 hours to  working.
But how will Clive’s time allocation actually change? As we saw in the chapter, 
this depends on the income effect and substitution effect that we learned about in 
Chapter 10 and its appendix.
The substitution effect of an increase in the wage rate works as follows. When 
the wage rate increases, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure increases; this 
induces Clive to consume less leisure and work more hours—that is, to substitute 
hours of work in place of hours of leisure as the wage rate rises. If the substitution 
effect were the whole story, the individual labor supply curve would look like any 
ordinary supply curve and would always slope upward—a higher wage rate leads 
to a greater quantity of labor  supplied.
What we learned in our analysis of demand was that for most consumer goods, 
the income effect isn’t very important because most goods account for only a very 
small share of a consumer’s spending. In addition, in the few cases of goods where 
The optimal time allocation 
rule says that an individual should 
allocate time so that the marginal 
utility gained from the income earned 
from an additional hour worked is 
equal to the marginal utility of an 
additional hour of leisure.

the income effect is significant—for example, major purchases like housing—it 
usually reinforces the substitution effect: most goods are normal goods, so when 
a price increase makes a consumer poorer, he or she buys less of that good.
In the labor/leisure choice, however, the income effect takes on a new signifi-
cance, for two reasons. First, most people get the great majority of their income 
from wages. This means that the income effect of a change in the wage rate is not 
small: an increase in the wage rate will generate a significant increase in income. 
Second, leisure is a normal good: when income rises, other things equal, people 
tend to consume more leisure and work fewer hours. 
So the income effect of a higher wage rate tends to reduce the quantity of labor 
supplied, working in opposition to the substitution effect, which tends to increase the 
quantity of labor supplied. So the net effect of a higher wage rate on the quantity of 
labor Clive supplies could go either way—depending on his preferences, he might 
choose to supply more labor, or he might choose to supply less labor. The two panels 
of Figure 19A-2 illustrate these two outcomes. In each panel, point A represents Clive’s 
initial consumption choice. Panel (a) shows the case in which Clive works more hours 
An Increase in the Wage Rate
19A-2
The two panels show Clive’s initial optimal choice, point 
A on BL1, the time allocation budget line corresponding 
to a wage rate of $10. After his wage rate rises to $20, 
his budget line rotates out to the new budget line, BL2: if 
he spends all his time working, the amount of money he 
earns rises from $800 to $1,600, reflected in the move-
ment from point Y to point Z. This generates two oppos-
ing effects: the substitution effect pushes him to con-
sume less leisure and to work more hours; the income 
effect pushes him to consume more leisure and to work 
fewer hours. Panel (a) shows the change in time alloca-
tion when the substitution effect is stronger: Clive’s new 
optimal choice is point B, representing a decrease in 
hours of leisure to 30 hours and an increase in hours of 
labor to 50 hours. In this case the individual labor sup-
ply curve slopes upward. Panel (b) shows the change in 
time allocation when the income effect is stronger: point 
C is the new optimal choice, representing an increase in 
hours of leisure to 50 hours and a decrease in hours of 
labor to 30 hours. Now the individual labor supply curve 
slopes downward.

in response to a higher wage rate. An increase in the wage rate induces him to move 
from point A to point B, where he consumes less leisure than at A and therefore works 
more hours. Here the substitution effect prevails over the income effect. Panel (b) 
shows the case in which Clive works fewer hours in response to a higher wage rate. 
Here, he moves from point A to point C, where he consumes more leisure and works 
fewer hours than at A. Here the income effect prevails over the substitution  effect.
When the income effect of a higher wage rate is stronger than the substitu-
tion effect, the individual labor supply curve, which shows how much labor an 
individual will supply at any given wage rate will have a segment that slopes the 
“wrong” way—downward: a higher wage rate leads to a smaller quantity of labor 
 supplied. An example is the segment connecting points B and C in Figure 19A-3.
Economists believe that the substitution effect usually dominates the income 
effect in the labor supply decision when an individual’s wage rate is low. An indi-
vidual labor supply curve typically slopes upward  for lower wage rates as people 
work more in response to rising wage rates. But they also believe that many 
individuals have stronger preferences for leisure and will choose to cut back the 
number of hours worked as their wage rate continues to rise. For these individu-
als, the income effect eventually dominates the substitution effect as the wage 
rate rises, leading their individual labor supply curves to change slope and to 
“bend backward” at high wage rates. An individual labor supply curve with this 
feature, called a backward - bending individual labor supply curve, is shown 
in Figure 19A-3. Although an individual labor supply curve may bend backward, 
market labor supply curves almost always slope upward  over their entire range as 
higher wage rates draw more new workers into the labor market. 
Indifference Curve Analysis
I
n the appendix to Chapter 10, we showed that consumer choice can be rep-
resented using the concept of indifference curves, which provide a “map” of 
consumer preferences. If you have covered the appendix, you may find it inter-
esting to learn that indifference curves are also useful for addressing the issue of 
labor supply. In fact, this is one place where they are particularly  helpful.
A Backward-Bending Individual Labor Supply Curve
19A-3
At lower wage rates, the substitution effect dominates the 
income effect for this individual. This is illustrated by the move-
ment along the individual labor supply curve from point A to 
point B: a rise in the wage rate from W1 to W2 leads the quan-
tity of labor supplied to increase from L1 to L2. But at higher 
wage rates, the income effect dominates the substitution effect, 
shown by the movement from point B to point C: here, a rise in 
the wage rate from W2 to W3 leads the quantity of labor sup-
plied to decrease from L2 to L3.

PROBLEMS
 1. Leandro has 16 hours per day that he can allocate to work 
or leisure. His job pays a wage rate of $20. Leandro decides 
to consume 8 hours of leisure. His indifference curves 
have the usual shape: they slope downward, they do not 
cross, and they have the characteristic convex shape.
 a. Draw Leandro’s time allocation budget line for a 
typical day. Then illustrate the indifference curve at 
his optimal  choice.
Now Leandro’s wage rate falls to $10.
 b. Draw Leandro’s new budget line.
 c. Suppose that Leandro now works only 4 hours as a 
result of his reduced wage rate. Illustrate the indif-
ference curve at his new optimal  choice.
 d. Leandro’s decision to work less as the wage rate falls 
is the result of a substitution effect and an income 
effect. In your diagram, show the income effect and 
the substitution effect from this reduced wage rate. 
Which effect is stronger?
Using indifference curves, Figure 19A-4 shows how an increase in the wage 
rate can lead to a fall in the quantity of labor supplied. Point A is Clive’s initial 
optimal choice, given an hourly wage rate of $10. It is the same as point A in 
Figure 19A-2; this time, however, we include an indifference curve to show that it 
is a point at which the budget line is tangent to the highest possible indifference 
curve.
Now consider the effect of a rise in the wage rate to $20. Imagine, for a 
moment, that at the same time Clive was offered a higher wage, he was told that 
he had to start repaying his student loan and that the good-news / bad - news com-
bination left his utility unchanged. Then he would find himself at point S: on the 
same indifference curve as at A, but tangent to a steeper budget line, the dashed 
line BLS in Figure 19A-4, which is parallel to BL2. The move from point A to point 
S is the substitution effect of his wage increase: it leads him to consume less lei-
sure and therefore supply more labor.
But now cancel the repayment on the student loan, and Clive is able to move 
to a higher indifference curve. His new optimum is at point C, which corresponds 
to C in panel (b) of Figure 19A-2. The move from point S to point C is the income 
effect of his wage increase. And we see that this income effect can outweigh the 
substitution effect: at C he consumes more leisure, and therefore supplies less 
labor, than he did at A.
Labor Supply Choice: The Indifference Curve Approach
19A-4
Point A, on BL1, is Clive’s initial optimal choice. 
After a wage rate increase, his income and utility 
level increase: his new time allocation budget line 
is BL2 and his new optimal choice is point C. This 
change can be decomposed into the substitution 
effect, the fall in the hours of leisure from point A 
to point S, and the income effect, the increase in 
the number of hours of leisure from point S to point 
C. As shown here, the income effect dominates 
the substitution effect: the net result of an increase 
in the wage rate is an increase in the hours of 
leisure consumed and a decrease in the hours of 
labor supplied.

in the following way. On the first $400 that Tamara 
makes, she pays no tax. That is, for the first 20 hours 
she works, her net wage—what she takes home after 
taxes—is $20 per hour. On all income above $400, 
Tamara pays a 75% tax. That is, for all hours above the 
first 20 hours, her net wage rate is only $5 per hour. 
Tamara decides to work 30 hours. Her indifference 
curves have the usual shape.
 a. Draw Tamara’s time allocation budget line for a typi-
cal week. Also illustrate the indifference curve at her 
optimal  choice.
The government changes the tax scheme. Now only 
the first $100 of income is tax - exempt. That is, for 
the first 5 hours she works, Tamara’s net wage rate 
is $20 per hour. But the government reduces the tax 
rate on all other income to 50%. That is, for all hours 
above the first 5 hours, Tamara’s net wage rate is now 
$10. After these changes, Tamara finds herself exactly 
equally as well off as before. That is, her new optimal 
choice is on the same indifference curve as her initial

Uncertainty, Risk, and Private 
Information
T
HE DECADE 2001–2011 WAS AN
especially tough one for insurers. It 
started with the September 11, 2001, terror-
ist attacks, which led to losses of about $23 
billion. It ended with a punishing year in 
2011—one of the industry’s worst ever—with 
$70 billion in losses accumulated before the 
hurricane season even started. There was 
Hurricane Irene, which hit New York and 
New Jersey hard, along with the Japanese 
earthquake and tsunami, severe tornadoes 
in the Southeast, and massive flooding along 
the Mississippi River. And this came on the 
heels of another difficult year in 2010, when 
the industry was faced with losses caused 
by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Yet, according to the Insurance Informa-
tion Institute, the industry’s worst year on 
record by far was 2005. That year three 
major hurricanes struck the United States. 
Hurricane Katrina, ranked a Category 5 on 
the National Weather Service’s hurricane 
intensity scale of 1 to 5, slammed into 
Mississippi and Louisiana in August. It 
was the single worst natural disaster ever 
to hit the United States: over 1,400 dead 
and entire communities wiped out. The 
monetary losses were also huge: up to $50 
billion in losses to private insurers and 
$23 billion in losses to the government’s 
National Flood Insurance Program. Then, 
in September, Rita blew into Texas and 
southwestern Louisiana, causing over $11 
billion in losses, followed in October by 
Wilma, which inflicted over $29 billion in 
losses on Florida. Moreover, these figures 
significantly understate the true level of 
loss because many people were uninsured 
or underinsured. 
Anyone who lives in an area threatened 
by hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods—or 
even terrorist attacks—knows that uncer-
tainty is a feature of the real world. Up to 
this point, we have assumed that people 
make decisions with knowledge of exactly 
how the future will unfold. (The exception 
being health insurance decisions which we 
discussed in Chapter 19.) In reality, people 
often make economic decisions, such as 
whether to build a house in a coastal area, 
without full knowledge of future events. As 
the victims of the decade’s catastrophes 
learned, making decisions when the future 
is uncertain carries with it the risk of loss.
It is often possible for individuals to use 
markets to reduce their risk. For example, 
hurricane victims who had insurance were 
able to receive some, if not complete, com-
pensation for their losses. In fact, through 
insurance and other devices, the modern 
economy offers many ways for individuals 
to reduce their exposure to risk. 
However, a market economy cannot 
always solve the problems created by 
uncertainty. Markets do very well at coping 
with risk when two conditions hold: when 
risk can be reasonably well diversified and 
when the probability of loss is equally well 
known by everyone. Over the past several 
years, the significant increase in extreme 
weather events has led many insurers to 
sharply reduce coverage of weather-related 
loss: they no longer believe that profits 
from areas with good weather will offset 
losses from hurricane- and tornado-prone 
areas. But in practice, the second condi-
tion is often the more limiting one. Markets 
run into trouble when some people know 
things that others do not—a situation that 
involves what is called private informa-
tion. We’ll see that private information can 
cause inefficiency by preventing mutually 
beneficial transactions from occurring—
especially in insurance markets.
In this chapter we’ll examine why 
most people dislike risk. Then we’ll 
explore how a market economy allows 
people to reduce risk at a price. Finally, 
we’ll turn to the special problems creat-
ed for markets by private information.

The Economics of Risk Aversion
I
n general, people don’t like risk and are willing to pay a price to avoid it. Just 
ask the U.S. insurance industry, which collects more than $1 trillion in premi-
ums every year. But what exactly is risk? And why don’t most people like it? To 
answer these questions, we need to look briefly at the concept of expected value 
and the meaning of uncertainty. Then we can turn to why people dislike risk.
Expectations and Uncertainty
The Lee family doesn’t know how big its medical bills will be next year. If all 
goes well, it won’t have any medical expenses at all. Let’s assume that there’s a 
50% chance of that happening. But if family members require hospitalization or 
expensive drugs, they will face medical expenses of $10,000. Let’s assume that 
there’s also a 50% chance that these high medical expenses will materialize.
In this example—which is designed to illustrate a point, rather than to be real-
istic—the Lees’ medical expenses for the coming year are a random variable, 
a variable that has an uncertain future value. No one can predict which of its 
possible values, or outcomes, a random variable will take. But that doesn’t mean 
we can say nothing about the Lees’ future medical expenses. On the contrary, an 
actuary (a person trained in evaluating uncertain future events) could calculate 
the expected value of expenses next year—the weighted average of all possible 
values, where the weights on each possible value correspond to the probability 
of that value occurring. In this example, the expected value of the Lees’ medical 
expenses is (0.5 × $0) + (0.5 × $10,000) = $5,000.
To derive the general formula for the expected value of a random variable, 
we imagine that there are a number of different states of the world, possible 
future events. Each state is associated with a different realized value—the value 
that actually occurs—of the random variable. You don’t know which state of the 
world will actually occur, but you can assign probabilities, one for each state of the 
world. Let’s assume that P1 is the probability of state 1, P2 the probability of state 
2, and so on. And you know the realized value of the random value in each state of 
the world: S1 in state 1, S2 in state 2, and so on. Let’s also assume that there are N 
possible states. Then the expected value of a random variable is:
(20-1)  Expected value of a random variable
EV = (P1 × S1) + (P2 × S2) + . . . + (PN × SN)
In the case of the Lee family, there are only two possible states of the world, each 
with a probability of 0.5.
Notice, however, that the Lee family doesn’t actually expect to pay $5,000 in 
medical bills next year. That’s because in this example there is no state of the 
world in which the family pays exactly $5,000. Either the family pays nothing, 
or it pays $10,000. So the Lees face considerable uncertainty about their future 
medical expenses.
But what if the Lee family can buy health insurance that will cover its 
medical expenses, whatever they turn out to be? Suppose, in particular, that 
the family can pay $5,000 up front in return for full coverage of whatever 
medical expenses actually arise during the coming year. Then the Lees’ future 
medical expenses are no longer uncertain for them: in return for $5,000—an 
amount equal to the expected value of the medical expenses—the insurance 
company assumes all responsibility for paying those medical expenses. Would 
this be a good deal from the Lees’ point of view?
Yes, it would—or at least most families would think so. Most people prefer, 
other things equal, to reduce risk—uncertainty about future outcomes. (We’ll 
focus here on financial risk, in which the uncertainty is about monetary 
outcomes, as opposed to uncertainty about outcomes that can’t be assigned a 
A random variable is a variable 
with an uncertain future value.
The expected value of a random 
variable is the weighted average 
of all possible values, where the 
weights on each possible value 
correspond to the probability of that 
value occurring.
A state of the world is a possible 
future event.
Risk is uncertainty about future 
outcomes. When the uncertainty 
is about monetary outcomes, it 
becomes financial risk.

monetary value.) In fact, most people are willing to pay a substantial price to 
reduce their risk; that’s why we have an insurance industry. But before we study 
the market for insurance, we need to understand why people feel that risk is a 
bad thing, an attitude that economists call risk aversion. The source of risk aver-
sion lies in a concept we first encountered in our analysis of consumer demand, 
back in Chapter 10: diminishing marginal utility.
The Logic of Risk Aversion
To understand how diminishing marginal utility gives rise to risk aversion, we 
need to look not only at the Lees’ medical costs but also at how those costs affect 
the income the family has left after medical expenses. Let’s assume the family 
knows that it will have an income of $30,000 next year. If the family has no medi-
cal expenses, it will be left with all of that income. If its medical expenses are 
$10,000, its income after medical expenses will be only $20,000. Since we have 
assumed that there is an equal chance of these two outcomes, the expected value 
of the Lees’ income after medical expenses is (0.5 × $30,000) + (0.5 × $20,000) = 
$25,000. At times we will simply refer to this as expected income.
But as we’ll now see, if the family’s utility function has the shape typical of 
most families’, its expected utility—the expected value of its total utility given 
uncertainty about future outcomes—is less than it would be if the family didn’t 
face any risk and knew with certainty that its income after medical expenses 
would be $25,000.
To see why, we need to look at how total utility depends on income. Panel (a) 
of Figure 20-1 shows a hypothetical utility function for the Lee family, where total 
utility depends on income—the amount of money the Lees have available for con-
sumption of goods and services (after they have paid any medical bills). The table 
within the figure shows how the family’s total utility varies over the income range 
of $20,000 to $30,000. As usual, the utility function slopes upward, because more 
income leads to higher total utility. Notice as well that the curve gets flatter as we 
move up and to the right, which reflects diminishing marginal utility.
In Chapter 10 we applied the principle of diminishing marginal utility to indi-
vidual goods and services: each successive unit of a good or service that a con-
sumer purchases adds less to his or her total utility. The same principle applies 
to income used for consumption: each successive dollar of income adds less to 
total utility than the previous dollar. Panel (b) shows how marginal utility varies 
with income, confirming that marginal utility of income falls as income rises. As 
we’ll see in a moment, diminishing marginal utility is the key to understanding 
the desire of individuals to reduce risk.
To analyze how a person’s utility is affected by risk, economists start from the 
assumption that individuals facing uncertainty maximize their expected utility. We 
can use the data in Figure 20-1 to calculate the Lee family’s expected utility. 
We’ll first do the calculation assuming that the Lees have no insurance, and then 
we’ll recalculate it assuming that they have purchased insurance.
Without insurance, if the Lees are lucky and don’t incur any medical expenses, 
they will have an income of $30,000, generating total utility of 1,080 utils. But if 
they have no insurance and are unlucky, incurring $10,000 in medical expenses, 
they will have just $20,000 of their income to spend on consumption and total 
utility of only 920 utils. So without insurance, the family’s expected utility is (0.5 
× 1,080) + (0.5 × 920) = 1,000 utils.
Now let’s suppose that an insurance company offers to pay whatever medical 
expenses the family incurs during the next year in return for a premium—a pay-
ment to the insurance company—of $5,000. Note that the amount of the premium 
in this case is equal to the expected value of the Lees’ medical expenses—the 
expected value of their future claim against the policy. An insurance policy with 
this feature, for which the premium is equal to the expected value of the claim, 
has a special name—a fair insurance policy.
Expected utility is the expected 
value of an individual’s total utility 
given uncertainty about future 
outcomes.
A premium is a payment to an 
insurance company in return for the 
insurance company’s promise to pay 
a claim in certain states of the world.
A fair insurance policy is an 
insurance policy for which the 
premium is equal to the expected 
value of the claim.

572    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
If the family purchases this fair insurance policy, the expected value of its 
income available for consumption is the same as it would be without insurance: 
$25,000—that is, $30,000 minus the $5,000 premium. But the family’s risk has 
been eliminated: the family has an income available for consumption of $25,000 
for sure, which means that it receives the utility level associated with an income 
of $25,000. Reading from the table in Figure 20-1, we see that this utility level is 
1,025 utils. Or to put it a slightly different way, their expected utility with insur-
ance is 1 × 1,025 = 1,025 utils, because with insurance they will receive a utility 
of 1,025 utils with a probability of 1. And this is higher than the level of expected 
utility without insurance—only 1,000 utils. So by eliminating risk through the 
purchase of a fair insurance policy, the family increases its expected utility even 
though its expected income hasn’t changed.
The calculations for this example are summarized in Table 20-1. This example 
shows that the Lees, like most people in real life, are risk - averse: they will choose 
to reduce the risk they face when the cost of that reduction leaves the expected

Income
Panel (a) shows how the total utility of the 
Lee family depends on its income avail-
able for consumption (that is, its income 
after medical expenses). The curve slopes 
upward: more income leads to higher total 
utility. But it gets flatter as we move up it 
and to the right, reflecting diminishing mar-
ginal utility. Panel (b) reflects the negative 
relationship between income and marginal 
utility when there is risk aversion: the mar-
ginal utility from each additional $1,000 of 
income is lower the higher your income. So 
the marginal utility of income is higher when 
the family has high medical expenses (point 
S) than when it has low medical expenses 
(point H).
Risk - averse individuals will choose 
to reduce the risk they face when 
that reduction leaves the expected 
value of their income or wealth 
unchanged.

C H A P T E R  2 0    U N C E RTA I N T Y, R I S K ,  A N D  P R I VAT E  I N F O R M AT I O N    573
value of their income or wealth unchanged. So the Lees, like most people, will be 
willing to buy fair insurance.
You might think that this result depends on the specific numbers we have 
chosen. In fact, however, the proposition that purchase of a fair insurance policy 
increases expected utility depends on only one assumption: diminishing mar-
ginal utility. The reason is that with diminishing marginal utility, a dollar gained 
when income is low adds more to utility than a dollar gained when income is high. 
That is, having an additional dollar matters more when you are facing hard times 
than when you are facing good times. And as we will shortly see, a fair insurance 
policy is desirable because it transfers a dollar from high - income states (where it 
is valued less) to low - income states (where it is valued more).
But first, let’s see how diminishing marginal utility leads to risk aversion by 
examining expected utility more closely. In the case of the Lee family, there are 
two states of the world; let’s call them H and S, for healthy and sick. In state H 
the family has no medical expenses; in state S it has $10,000 in medical expenses. 
Let’s use the symbols UH and US to represent the Lee family’s total utility in each 
state. Then the family’s expected utility is:
(20-2)  Expected utility =  (Probability of state H × Total utility in state H) +
(Probability of state S × Total utility in state S)
 
= (0.5 × UH) + (0.5 × US)
The fair insurance policy reduces the family’s income available for consump-
tion in state H by $5,000, but it increases it in state S by the same amount. As we’ve 
just seen, we can use the utility function to directly calculate the effects of these 
changes on expected utility. But as we have also seen in many other contexts, we 
gain more insight into individual choice by focusing on marginal utility.
To use marginal utility to analyze the effects of fair insurance, let’s imagine 
introducing the insurance a bit at a time, say in 5,000 small steps. At each of these 
steps, we reduce income in state H by $1 and simultaneously increase income in 
state S by $1. At each of these steps, total utility in state H falls by the marginal 
utility of income in that state but total utility in state S rises by the marginal util-
ity of income in that state.
Now look again at panel (b) of Figure 20-1, which shows how marginal utility 
varies with income. Point S shows marginal utility when the Lee family’s income 
is $20,000; point H shows marginal utility when income is $30,000. Clearly, mar-
ginal utility is higher when income after medical expenses is low. Because of 
diminishing marginal utility, an additional dollar of income adds more to total 
utility when the family has low income (point S) than when it has high income 
(point H).
This tells us that the gain in expected utility from increasing income in state S is 
larger than the loss in expected utility from reducing income in state H by the same 
amount. So at each step of the process of reducing risk, by transferring $1 of income

from state H to state S, expected utility increases. This is the same as saying that the 
family is risk - averse; that is, risk aversion is a result of diminishing marginal utility.
Almost everyone is risk - averse, because almost everyone has diminishing mar-
ginal utility. But the degree of risk aversion varies among individuals—some people 
are more risk - averse than others. To illustrate this point, Figure 20-2 compares two 
individuals, Danny and Mel. We suppose that each of them earns the same income 
now but is confronted with the possibility of earning either $1,000 more or $1,000 less. 
Panel (a) of Figure 20-2 shows how each individual’s total utility would be 
affected by the change in income. Danny would gain very few utils from a rise in 
income, which moves him from N to HD, but lose a large number of utils from a 
fall in income, which moves him from N to LD. That is, he is highly risk - averse. 
This is reflected in panel (b) by his steeply declining marginal utility curve. Mel, 
though, as shown in panel (a), would gain almost as many utils from higher 
income, which moves him from N to HM, as he would lose from lower income, 
Differences in Risk Aversion
20-2
Danny and Mel have different utility functions. 
Danny is highly risk-averse: a gain of $1,000 
in income, which moves him from N to HD, 
adds only a few utils to his total utility, but a 
$1,000 fall in income, which moves him from N 
to LD, reduces his total utility by a large num-
ber of utils. By contrast, Mel gains almost as 
many utils from a $1,000 rise in income (the 
movement from N to HM) as he loses from a 
$1,000 fall in income (the movement from N 
to LM). This difference—reflected in the dif-
fering slopes of the two men’s marginal utility 
curves—means that Danny would be willing to 
pay much more than Mel for insurance.

which moves him from N to LM. He is barely risk - averse at all. This is reflected in 
his marginal utility curve in panel (b), which is almost horizontal. So other things 
equal, Danny will gain a lot more utility from insurance than Mel will. Someone 
who is completely insensitive to risk is called risk-neutral. 
Individuals differ in risk aversion for two main reasons: differences in prefer-
ences and differences in initial income or wealth.
 • Differences in preferences. Other things equal, people simply 
differ in how much their marginal utility is affected by their 
level of income. Someone whose marginal utility is relatively 
unresponsive to changes in income will be much less sensitive 
to risk. In contrast, someone whose marginal utility depends 
greatly on changes in income will be much more risk-averse.
 • Differences in initial income or wealth. The possible loss of 
$1,000 makes a big difference to a family living below the 
poverty threshold; it makes very little difference to someone 
who earns $1 million a year. In general, people with high 
incomes or high wealth will be less risk - averse.
Differences in risk aversion have an important consequence: 
they affect how much an individual is willing to pay to avoid risk.
Paying to Avoid Risk
The risk - averse Lee family is clearly better off taking out a fair 
insurance policy—a policy that leaves their expected income 
unchanged but eliminates their risk. Unfortunately, real insur-
ance policies are rarely fair: because insurance companies have 
to cover other costs, such as salaries for salespeople and actuar-
ies, they charge more than they expect to pay in claims. Will the 
Lee family still want to purchase an “unfair” insurance policy—
one for which the premium is larger than the expected claim?
It depends on the size of the premium. Look again at Table 
20-1. We know that without insurance expected utility is 1,000 
utils and that insurance costing $5,000 raises expected utility to 
1,025 utils. If the premium were $6,000, the Lees would be left 
A risk-neutral person is completely 
insensitive to risk.
If most people are risk - averse and 
risk- averse individuals won’t take a fair 
gamble, how come Las Vegas, Atlantic 
City, and other places where gambling is 
legal do so much business?
After all, a casino doesn’t even offer 
gamblers a fair gamble: all the games in 
any gambling facility are designed so that, 
on average, the casino makes money. So 
why would anyone play their games?
You might argue that the gambling 
industry caters to the minority of people 
who are actually the opposite of risk - 
averse: risk - loving. But a glance at the cus-
tomers of Las Vegas hotels quickly refutes 
that hypothesis: most of them aren’t dare-
devils who also sky  dive and hang - glide. 
Instead, most of them are ordinary people 
who have health and life insurance and 
who wear seat belts. In other words, they 
are risk - averse like the rest of us.
So why do people gamble? Presumably 
because they enjoy the experience.
Also, gambling may be one of those 
areas where the assumption of ration-
al behavior goes awry. Psychologists 
have concluded that gambling can be 
addictive in ways that are not that differ-
ent from the addictive effects of drugs. 
Taking dangerous drugs is irrational; so

FOR INQUIRING MINDS
THE PARADOX OF GAMBLING
F
PITFALLS
BEFORE THE FACT VERSUS AFTER THE FACT
Why is an insurance policy different from a doughnut?
No, it’s not a riddle. Although the supply and 
demand for insurance behave like the supply and 
demand for any good or service, the payoff is very 
different. When you buy a doughnut, you know what 
you’re going to get; when you buy insurance, by defi-
nition you don’t know what you’re going to get. If you 
bought car insurance and then didn’t have an acci-
dent, you got nothing from the policy, except peace of 
mind, and might wish that you hadn’t bothered. But if 
you did have an accident, you probably would be glad 
that you bought insurance that covered the cost.
This means we have to be careful in assessing the 
rationality of insurance purchases (or, for that matter, 
any decision made in the face of uncertainty). After 
the fact—after the uncertainty has been resolved—
such decisions are almost always subject to second- 
guessing. But that doesn’t mean that the decision 
was wrong before the fact, given the information 
available at the time.
One highly successful Wall Street investor told us 
that he never looks back—that as long as he believes 
he made the right decision given what he knew when 
he made it, he never reproaches himself if things 
turn out badly. That’s the right attitude, and it almost 
surely contributes to his success.

with an income of $24,000, which, as you can see from Figure 20-1, would give 
them a total utility of 1,008 utils—which is still higher than their expected utility 
if they had no insurance at all. So the Lees would be willing to buy insurance 
with a $6,000 premium. But they wouldn’t be willing to pay $7,000, which would 
reduce their income to $23,000 and their total utility to 989 utils.
This example shows that risk - averse individuals are willing to make deals that 
reduce their expected income but also reduce their risk: they are willing to pay 
a premium that exceeds their expected claim. The more risk - averse they are, the 
higher the premium they are willing to pay. That willingness to pay is what makes 
the insurance industry possible. In contrast, a risk-neutral person is unwilling to 
pay at all to reduce his or her risk.

WARRANTIES
M
any 
expensive 
consumer 
goods—electronic 
devices, 
major appliances, cars—come with 
some form of warranty. Typically, the 
manufacturer guarantees to repair 
or replace the item if something goes 
wrong with it during some specified 
period after purchase—usually six 
months or one year.
Why do manufacturers offer 
warranties? Part of the answer is 
that warranties signal to consum-
ers that the goods are of high qual-
ity. But mainly warranties are a form of consumer insurance. For many people, 
the cost of repairing or replacing an expensive item like a refrigerator—or, worse 
yet, a car—would be a serious burden. If they were obliged to come up with the 
cash, their consumption of other goods would be restricted; as a result, their mar-
ginal utility of income would be higher than if they didn’t have to pay for repairs.
So a warranty that covers the cost of repair or replacement increases the 
consumer’s expected utility, even if the cost of the warranty is greater than the 
expected future claim paid by the manufacturer.

Buying, Selling, and Reducing Risk
L
loyd’s of London is the oldest existing commercial insurance company, and 
it is an institution with an illustrious past. Originally formed in the eigh-
teenth century to help merchants cope with the risks of commerce, it grew 
in the heyday of the British Empire into a mainstay of imperial trade.
The basic idea of Lloyd’s was simple. In the eighteenth century, shipping goods 
via sailing vessels was risky: the chance that a ship would sink in a storm or be 
captured by pirates was fairly high. The merchant who owned the ship and its 
cargo could easily be ruined financially by such an event. Lloyd’s matched ship-
owners seeking insurance with wealthy investors who promised to compensate 
a merchant if his ship was lost. In return, the merchant paid the investor a fee 
in advance; if his ship didn’t sink, the investor still kept the fee. In effect, the 
merchant paid a price to relieve himself of risk. By matching people who wanted 
to purchase insurance with people who wanted to provide it, Lloyd’s performed 
the functions of a market. The fact that British merchants could use Lloyd’s to 
reduce their risk made many more people in Britain willing to undertake mer-
chant trade.
Insurance companies have changed quite a lot from the early days of Lloyd’s. 
They no longer consist of wealthy individuals deciding on insurance deals over 
port and boiled mutton. But asking why Lloyd’s worked to the mutual benefit of 
merchants and investors is a good way to understand how the market economy 
as a whole “trades” and thereby transforms risk.
The insurance industry rests on two principles. The first is that trade in risk, 
like trade in any good or service, can produce mutual gains. In this case, the 
gains come when people who are less willing to bear risk transfer it to people who 
are more willing to bear it. The second is that some risk can be made to disappear 
through diversification. Let’s consider each principle in turn.
Trading Risk
It may seem a bit strange to talk about “trading” risk. After all, risk is a bad 
thing—and aren’t we supposed to be trading goods and services?
But people often trade away things they don’t like to other people who dislike 
them less. Suppose you have just bought a house for $100,000, the average price 
for a house in your community. But you have now learned, to your horror, that 
the building next door is being turned into a nightclub and bar. You want to sell 
the house immediately and are willing to accept $95,000 for it. But who will now 
be willing to buy it? The answer: a person who doesn’t really mind late - night 
noise. Such a person might be willing to pay up to $100,000. So there is an oppor-
tunity here for a mutually beneficial deal—you are willing to sell for as little as 
$95,000, and the other person is willing to pay as much as $100,000, so any price 
in between will benefit both of you.
The key point is that the two parties have different sensitivities to noise, which 
enables those who most dislike noise, in effect, to pay other people to make their 
lives quieter. Trading risk works exactly the same way: people who want to reduce 
the risk they face can pay other people who are less sensitive to risk to take some 
of their risk away.
As we saw in the previous section, individual preferences account for some 
of the variations in people’s attitudes toward risk, but differences in income 
and wealth are probably the principal reason behind different risk sensitivities. 
Lloyd’s made money by matching wealthy investors who were more risk - tolerant 
with less wealthy and therefore more risk - averse shipowners.
Suppose, staying with our Lloyd’s of London story, that a merchant whose 
ship went down would lose £1,000 and that there was a 10% chance of such a 
disaster. The expected loss in this case would be 0.10 × £1,000 = £100. But the 

578    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
merchant, whose whole livelihood was at stake, might have been willing to pay 
£150 to be compensated in the amount of £1,000 if the ship sank. Meanwhile, a 
wealthy investor for whom the loss of £1,000 was no big deal would have been 
willing to take this risk for a return only slightly better than the expected loss—
say, £110. Clearly, there is room for a mutually beneficial deal here: the merchant 
pays something less than £150 and more than £110—say, £130—in return for 
compensation if the ship goes down. In effect, he has paid a less risk - averse indi-
vidual to bear the burden of his risk. Everyone has been made better off by this 
transaction.
The funds that an insurer places at risk when providing insurance are called 
the insurer’s capital at risk. In our example, the wealthy Lloyd’s investor places 
capital of £1,000 at risk in return for a premium of £130. In general, the amount 
of capital that potential insurers are willing to place at risk depends, other things 
equal, on the premium offered. If every ship is worth £1,000 and has a 10% chance 
of going down, nobody would offer insurance for less than a £100 premium, equal 
to the expected claim. In fact, only an investor who isn’t risk - averse at all—that 
is, who is risk-neutral—would be willing to offer a policy at that price, because 
accepting a £100 premium would leave the insurer’s expected income unchanged 
while increasing his or her risk.
Suppose there is one investor who is risk -neutral; but the next most willing 
investor is slightly risk - averse and insists on a £105 premium. The next investor, 
being somewhat more risk - averse, demands a premium of £110, and so on. By 
varying the premium and asking how many insurers would be willing to provide 
insurance at that premium, we can trace out a supply curve for insurance, as 
shown in Figure 20-3. As the premium increases as we move up the supply curve, 
more risk - averse investors are induced to provide coverage.
Meanwhile, potential buyers will consider their willingness to pay a given 
premium, defining the demand curve for insurance. In Figure 20-4, the highest 
premium that any shipowner is willing to pay is £200. Who’s willing to pay this? 
The most risk - averse shipowner, of course. A slightly less risk - averse shipowner 
might be willing to pay £190, an even slightly less risk - averse shipowner is willing 
to pay £180, and so on.
Now imagine a market in which there are thousands of shipowners and poten-
tial insurers, so that the supply and demand curves for insurance are smooth 
The Supply of Insurance
20-3
This is the supply of insurance policies to provide £1,000 
in coverage to a merchant ship that has a 10% chance of 
being lost. Each investor has £1,000 of capital at risk. The 
lowest possible premium at which a policy is offered is 
£100, equal to the expected claim, and only a risk-neutral 
investor is willing to supply this policy. As the premium 
increases, investors who are more risk-averse are induced 
to supply policies to the market, increasing the quantity of 
policies supplied.

lines. In this market, as in markets for ordinary goods and services, there will 
be an equilibrium price and quantity. Figure 20-5 illustrates such a market equi-
librium at a premium of £130, with a total quantity of 5,000 policies bought and 
sold, representing a total capital at risk of £5,000,000.
Notice that in this market risk is transferred from the people who most 
want to get rid of it (the most risk - averse shipowners) to the people least 
bothered by risk (the least risk - averse investors). So just as markets for goods 
and services typically produce an efficient allocation of resources, markets 
for risk also typically lead to an efficient allocation of risk—an allocation 
of risk in which those who are most willing to bear risk are those who end 
up bearing it. But as in the case of the markets for goods and services, there 
The Demand for Insurance

This is the demand for insurance policies for £1,000 in cov-
erage of a merchant ship that has a 10% chance of being 
lost. In this example, the highest premium at which anyone 
demands a policy is £200, which only the most risk-averse 
shipowner will desire. As the premium falls, shipowners 
who are less risk-averse are induced to demand policies, 
increasing the quantity of policies demanded.

The Insurance Market
20-5
Here we represent the hypothetical market for insuring a 
merchant ship, where each ship requires £1,000 in cover-
age. The demand curve is made up of shipowners who 
wish to buy insurance, and the supply curve is made up 
of wealthy investors who wish to supply insurance. In this 
example, at a premium of £200, only the most risk-averse 
shipowners will purchase insurance; at a premium of £100, 
only risk-neutral investors are willing to supply insurance. 
The equilibrium is at a premium of £130 with 5,000 policies 
bought and sold. In the absence of private information, the 
insurance market leads to an efficient allocation of risk.

is an important qualification to this result: there are well - defined cases in 
which the market for risk fails to achieve efficiency. These arise from the 
presence of private information, an important topic that we will cover in the 
next section.
The trading of risk between individuals who differ in their degree of risk aver-
sion plays an extremely important role in the economy, but it is not the only way 
that markets can help people cope with risk. Under some circumstances, markets 
can perform a sort of magic trick: they can make some (though rarely all) of the 
risk that individuals face simply disappear.
Making Risk Disappear: The Power of Diversification
In the early days of Lloyd’s, British merchant ships traversed the world, trading 
spices and silk from Asia, tobacco and rum from the New World, and textiles 
and wool from Britain, among many other goods. Each of the many routes that 
British ships took had its own unique risks—pirates in the Caribbean, gales in the 
North Atlantic, typhoons in the Indian Ocean.
In the face of all these risks, how were merchants 
able to survive? One important way was by reducing their 
risks by not putting all their eggs in one basket: by send-
ing different ships to different destinations, they could 
reduce the probability that all their ships would be lost. 
A strategy of investing in such a way as to reduce the 
probability of severe losses is known as diversification. As 
we’ll now see, diversification can often make some of the 
economy’s risk disappear.
Let’s stay with our shipping example. It was all too likely 
that a pirate might seize a merchant ship in the Caribbean 
or that a typhoon might sink another ship in the Indian 
Ocean. But the key point here is that the various threats to 
shipping didn’t have much to do with each other. So it was 
considerably less likely that a merchant who had one ship 
in the Caribbean and another ship in the Indian Ocean in 
a given year would lose them both, one to a pirate and the 
other to a typhoon. After all, there was no connection: the actions of cutthroats in 
the Caribbean had no influence on weather in the Indian Ocean, or vice versa.
Statisticians refer to such events—events that have no connection, so that one 
is no more likely to happen if the other does than if it does not—as independent 
events. Many unpredictable events are independent of each other. If you toss a coin 
twice, the probability that it will come up heads on the second toss is the same wheth-
er it came up heads or tails on the first toss. If your house burns down today, it does 
not affect the probability that my house will burn down the same day (unless we live 
next door to each other or employ the services of the same incompetent electrician).
There is a simple rule for calculating the probability that two independent 
events will both happen: multiply the probability that one event would happen on 
its own by the probability that the other event would happen on its own. If you 
toss a coin once, the probability that it will come up heads is 0.5; if you toss the 
coin twice, the probability that it will come up heads both times is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25.
But what did it matter to shipowners or Lloyd’s investors that ship losses in 
the Caribbean and ship losses in the Indian Ocean were independent events? The 
answer is that by spreading their investments across different parts of the world, 
shipowners or Lloyd’s investors could make some of the riskiness of the shipping 
business simply disappear.
Let’s suppose that Joseph Moneypenny, Esq., is wealthy enough to outfit two 
ships—and let’s ignore for a moment the possibility of insuring his ships. Should 
Mr. Moneypenny equip two ships for the Caribbean trade and send them off 
together? Or should he send one ship to Barbados and one to Calcutta?
Two possible events are 
independent events if each of 
them is neither more nor less likely to 
happen if the other one happens.
Lloyd’s enables its investors to trade risks and diversify.

Assume that both voyages will be equally profitable if successful, yielding 
£1,000 if the voyage is completed. Also assume that there is a 10% chance both 
that a ship sent to Barbados will run into a pirate and that a ship sent to Calcutta 
will be sunk by a typhoon. And if two ships travel to the same destination, we 
will assume that they share the same fate. So if Mr. Moneypenny were to send 
both his ships to either destination, he would face a probability of 10% of losing 
all his investment.
But if Mr. Moneypenny were instead to send one ship to Barbados and one 
to Calcutta, the probability that he would lose both of them would be only 0.1 
× 0.1 = 0.01, or just 1%. As we will see shortly, his expected payoff would be the 
same—but the chance of losing it all would be much less. So by engaging in 
diversification—investing in several different things, where the possible losses 
are independent events—he could make some of his risk disappear.
Table 20-2 summarizes Mr. Moneypenny’s options and their possible conse-
quences. If he sends both ships to the same destination, he runs a 10% chance of 
losing them both. If he sends them to different destinations, there are three pos-
sible outcomes. Both ships could arrive safely: because there is a 0.9 probability 
of either one making it, the probability that both will make it is 0.9 × 0.9 = 81%. 
Both could be lost—but the probability of that happening is only 0.1 × 0.1 = 1%. 
Finally, there are two ways that only one ship can arrive. The probability that the 
first ship arrives and the second ship is lost is 0.9 × 0.1 = 9%. The probability that 
the first ship is lost but the second ship arrives is 0.1 × 0.9 = 9%. So the probability 
that only one ship makes it is 9% + 9% = 18%.
You might think that diversification is a strategy available only to those with 
a lot of money to begin with. Can Mr. Moneypenny diversify if he is able to afford 
only one ship? There are ways for even small investors to diversify. Even if Mr. 
Moneypenny is only wealthy enough to equip one ship, he can enter a partnership 
with another merchant. They can jointly outfit two ships, agreeing to share the 
profits equally, and then send those ships to different destinations. That way each 
faces less risk than if he equips one ship alone.
In the modern economy, diversification is made much easier for investors by 
the fact that they can easily buy shares in many companies by using the stock 
market. The owner of a share in a company is the owner of part of that com-
pany—typically a very small part, one - millionth or less. An individual who put all 
of his or her wealth in shares of a single company would lose all of that wealth if 
the company went bankrupt. But most investors hold shares in many companies, 
which makes the chance of losing all their investment very small.
In fact, Lloyd’s of London wasn’t just a way to trade risks; it was also a way 
for investors to diversify. To see how this worked, let’s introduce Lady Penelope 
Smedley - Smythe, a wealthy aristocrat, who decides to increase her income by 
placing £1,000 of her capital at risk via Lloyd’s. She could use that capital to 
insure just one ship. But more typically she would enter a “syndicate,” a group of

An individual can engage in 
diversification by investing in 
several different things, so that the 
possible losses are independent 
events.
A share in a company is a partial 
ownership of that company.

investors, who would jointly insure a number of ships going to different destina-
tions, agreeing to share the cost if any one of those ships went down. Because it 
would be much less likely for all the ships insured by the syndicate to sink than 
for any one of them to go down, Lady Penelope would be at much less risk of los-
ing her entire capital.
In some cases, an investor can make risk almost entirely disappear by taking a 
small share of the risk in many independent events. This strategy is known as pooling.
Consider the case of a health insurance company, which has millions of policyhold-
ers, with thousands of them requiring expensive treatment each year. The insurance 
company can’t know whether any given individual will, say, require a heart bypass 
operation. But heart problems for two different individuals are pretty much indepen-
dent events. And when there are many possible independent events, it is possible, using 
statistical analysis, to predict with great accuracy how many events of a given type will 
happen. For example, if you toss a coin 1,000 times, it will come up heads about 500 
times—and it is very unlikely to be more than a percent or two off that figure.
So a company offering fire insurance can predict very accurately how many 
of its clients’ homes will burn down in a given year; a company offering health 
insurance can predict very accurately how many of its clients will need heart sur-
gery in a given year; a life insurance company can predict how many of its clients 
will . . . Well, you get the idea.
When an insurance company is able to take advantage of the predictability 
that comes from aggregating a large number of independent events, it is said 
to engage in pooling of risks. And this pooling often means that even though 
For a small investor (someone 
investing less than several hun-
dred thousand dollars), financial 
economists agree that the best 
strategy for investing in stocks is 
to buy an index fund.
Why index funds? Because 
they contain a wide range of 
stocks that reflect the overall mar-
ket, they achieve diversification; 
and they have very low manage-
ment fees. In addition, financial 
economists agree that it’s a losing 
strategy to try to “time” the mar-
ket: to buy when the stock market 
is low and sell when it’s high. 
Instead, small investors should 
buy a fixed dollar amount of stocks and 
other financial assets every year, regard-
less of the state of the market. 
Yet many, if not most, small inves-
tors don’t follow this advice. Instead, 
they buy individual stocks or funds that 
charge high fees. They spend endless 
hours in Internet chat rooms chasing 
the latest hot tip or sifting through data 
trying to discern patterns in stocks’ 
behavior. They try to time the market but 
invariably buy when stocks are high and 
refuse to sell losers before they lose 
even more. And they fail to diversify, 
instead concentrating too much money 
in a few stocks they think are “winners.”
So why are human beings so dense 
when it comes to investing? According 
to many experts, the culprit is emotion. 
In his recent book Your Money and Your 
Brain, Jason Zweig states, “the brain is 
not an optimal tool for making financial 
decisions.” As he explains it, the prob-
lem is that the human brain evolved to 
detect and interpret simple patterns. 
(Is there a lion lurking in that 
bush?) As a consequence, 
“when it comes to investing, our 
incorrigible search for patterns 
leads us to assume that order 
exists where it often doesn’t.” 
In other words, investors fool 
themselves into believing that 
they’ve discovered a lucrative 
stock market pattern when, in 
fact, stock market behavior is 
largely random.
Not surprisingly, how people 
make financial decisions is 
a major topic of study in the 
area of behavioral economics, 
a branch of economics that 
studies why human beings often fail 
to behave rationally (see Chapter 9 for 
more on behavioral economics).
So, what’s the typical twenty-first-
century investor to do? According to Mr. 
Zweig, there’s hope: if you recognize the 
influence of your emotions, then you can 
tame them. One test of how well you’ve 
evolved from a Cro-Magnon state of 
mind: are you diversified?

ing on some of the risks of less wealthy merchants. It was also a vehicle for pool-
ing some of those risks. The effect of that pooling was to shift the supply curve in 
Figure 20-5 rightward: to make investors willing to accept more risk, at a lower 
price, than would otherwise have been possible.
The Limits of Diversification
Diversification can reduce risk. In some cases it can eliminate it. But these cases 
are not typical, because there are important limits to diversification. We can see 
the most important reason for these limits by returning to Lloyd’s one more time.
During the period when Lloyd’s was creating its legend, there was one impor-
tant hazard facing British shipping other than pirates or storms: war. Between 
1690 and 1815, Britain fought a series of wars, mainly with France (which, among 
other things, went to war with Britain in support of the American Revolution). 
Each time, France would sponsor “privateers”—basically pirates with official 
backing—to raid British shipping and thus indirectly damage Britain’s war effort.
Whenever war broke out between Britain and France, losses of British mer-
chant ships would suddenly increase. Unfortunately, merchants could not pro-
tect themselves against this eventuality by sending ships to different ports: the 
privateers would prey on British ships anywhere in the world. So the loss of a 
ship to French privateers in the Caribbean and the loss of another ship to French 
privateers in the Indian Ocean would not be independent events. It would be quite 
likely that they would happen in the same year.
When an event is more likely to occur if some other event occurs, these two 
events are said to be positively correlated. And like the risk of having a ship 
seized by French privateers, many financial risks are, alas, positively correlated.
Here are some of the positively correlated financial risks that investors in the 
modern world face:
 • Severe weather. Within any given region of the United States, losses due to 
weather are definitely not independent events. When a hurricane hits Florida, 
a lot of Florida homes will suffer hurricane damage. To some extent, insur-
ance companies can diversify away this risk by insuring homes in many states. 
But events like El Niño (a recurrent temperature anomaly in the Pacific Ocean 
that disrupts weather around the world) can cause simultaneous flooding 
across the United States. And as we mentioned in our opening story, over the 
past several years, there has been a significant increase in extreme weather. 
 • Political events. Modern governments do not, thankfully, license privateers—
although submarines served much the same function during World War II. 
Even today, however, some kinds of political events—say, a war or revolution 
in a key raw - material - producing area—can damage business around the globe.
 • Business cycles. The causes of business cycles, fluctuations in the output of the 
economy as a whole, are a subject for macroeconomics. What we can say here 
is that if one company suffers a decline in business because of a nationwide 
economic slump, many other companies will also suffer such declines. So 
these events will be positively correlated.
When events are positively correlated, the risks they pose cannot be diversified 
away. An investor can protect herself from the risk that any one company will 
do badly by investing in many companies; she cannot use the same technique to 
protect against an economic slump in which all companies do badly.
An insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses from local 
flooding by insuring houses in many different places; but a global weather pattern 
that produces floods in many places will defeat this strategy. Not surprisingly, and 
Two events are positively 
correlated if each event is more 
likely to occur if the other event also 
occurs.

as we explained in the opening story, insurers pulled back from writing policies 
when it became clear that extreme weather patterns had become worse. They could 
no longer be confident that profits from policies written in good weather areas 
would be sufficient to compensate for losses incurred on policies in hurricane  and 
tornado  prone areas.
So institutions like insurance companies and stock markets cannot make 
risk go away completely. There is always an irreducible core of risk that cannot 
be diversified. Markets for risk, however, do accomplish two things: First, they 
enable the economy to eliminate the risk that can be diversified. Second, they 
allocate the risk that remains to the people most willing to bear it.

WHEN LLOYD’S ALMOST LLOST IT
A 
t the end of the 1980s, the venerable institution of Lloyd’s found itself 
in severe trouble. Investors who had placed their capital at risk, believ-
ing that the risks were small and the return on their investments more or 
less assured, found themselves required to make large payments to satisfy 
enormous claims. A number of investors, including members of some very 
old aristocratic families, found themselves pushed into bankruptcy.
What happened? Part of the answer is that ambitious managers at 
Lloyd’s had persuaded investors to take on risks that were much larger 
than the investors realized. (Or to put it a different way, the premiums 
the investors accepted were too small for the true level of risk contained 
in the policies.)
But the biggest single problem was that many of the events against 
which Lloyd’s had become a major insurer were not independent. In the 
1970s and 1980s, Lloyd’s had become a major provider of corporate liabil-
ity insurance in the United States: it protected American corporations 
against the possibility that they might be sued for selling defective or 
harmful products. Everyone expected such suits to be more or less inde-
pendent events. Why should one company’s legal problems have much to 
do with another’s?
The answer turned out to lie in one word: asbestos. For decades, this fire-
proofing material had been used in many products, which meant that many 
companies were responsible for its use. Then it turned out that asbestos can 
cause severe damage to the lungs, especially in children. The result was a 
torrent of lawsuits by people who believed they were injured by asbestos 
and billions of dollars in damage awards—many of them ultimately paid by 
Lloyd’s investors.

• Insurance markets exist because 
there are gains from trade in risk. 
Except in the case of private informa-
tion, they lead to an efficient allo-
cation of risk: those who are most 
willing to bear risk place their capital 
at risk to cover the financial losses 
of those least willing to bear risk.
• When independent events are 
involved, a strategy of diversifica-
tion can substantially reduce risk. 
Diversification is made easier by 
the existence of institutions like the 
stock market, in which people trade 
shares of companies. A form of 
diversification, relevant especially 
to insurance companies, is pooling.

related, there is a core of risk that 
cannot be eliminated, no matter 
how much individuals diversify.

Private Information: What You Don’t 
Know Can Hurt You
M
arkets do very well at dealing with diversifiable risk and with risk due 
to uncertainty: situations in which nobody knows what is going to 
happen, whose house will be flooded, or who will get sick. However, 
markets have much more trouble with situations in which some people know 
things that other people don’t know—situations of private information. As we 
will see, private information can distort economic decisions and sometimes pre-
vent mutually beneficial economic transactions from taking place. (Sometimes 
economists use the term asymmetric information rather than private informa-
tion, but they are equivalent.)
Why is some information private? The most important reason is that people 
generally know more about themselves than other people do. For example, you 
know whether or not you are a careful driver; but unless you have already been 
in several accidents, your auto insurance company does not. You are more likely 
to have a better estimate than your insurance company of whether or not you will 
need an expensive medical procedure. And if you are selling me your used car, 
you are more likely to be aware of any problems with it than I am.
But why should such differences in who knows what be a problem? It turns 
out that there are two distinct sources of trouble: adverse selection, which arises 
from having private information about the way things are, and moral hazard, 
which arises from having private information about what people do.
Adverse Selection: The Economics of Lemons
Suppose that someone offers to sell you an almost brand - new car—purchased 
just three months ago, with only 2,000 miles on the odometer and no dents or 
scratches. Will you be willing to pay almost the same for it as for a car direct 
from the dealer?
Probably not, for one main reason: you cannot help but wonder why this car 
is being sold. Is it because the owner has discovered that something is wrong 
with it—that it is a “lemon”? Having driven the car for a while, the owner knows 
more about it than you do—and people are more likely to sell cars that give 
them trouble.
You might think that the fact that sellers of used cars know more about them 
than the buyers do represents an advantage to the sellers. But potential buyers 
know that potential sellers are likely to offer them lemons—they just don’t know 
exactly which car is a lemon. Because potential buyers of a used car know that 
potential sellers are more likely to sell lemons than good cars, buyers will offer 
a lower price than they would if they had a guarantee of the car’s quality. Worse 
yet, this poor opinion of used cars tends to be self - reinforcing, precisely because 
it depresses the prices that buyers offer. Used cars sell at a significant discount 
because buyers expect a disproportionate share of those cars to be lemons.
Even a used car that is not a lemon would sell only at a large discount because 
buyers don’t know whether it’s a lemon or not. But potential sellers who have good 
cars are unwilling to sell them at a deep discount, except under exceptional cir-
cumstances. So good used cars are rarely offered for sale, and used cars that are 
offered for sale have a strong tendency to be lemons. (This is why people who have 
a compelling reason to sell a car, such as moving overseas, make a point of reveal-
ing that information to potential buyers—as if to say “This car is not a lemon!”)
The end result, then, is not only that used cars sell for low prices and that 
there are a large number of used cars with hidden problems. Equally important, 
many potentially beneficial transactions—sales of good cars by people who 
would like to get rid of them to people who would like to buy them—end up 
being frustrated by the inability of potential sellers to convince potential buyers 
Private information is information 
that some people have but others 
do not.

586    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
that their cars are actually worth the higher price being asked. So some mutu-
ally beneficial trades between those who want to sell used cars and those who 
want to buy them go unexploited.
Although economists sometimes refer to situations like this as the “lemons 
problem” (the issue was introduced in a famous 1970 paper by economist and 
Nobel laureate George Akerlof entitled “The Market for Lemons”), the more 
formal name of the problem is adverse selection. The reason for the name is 
obvious: because the potential sellers know more about the quality of what they 
are selling than the potential buyers, they have an incentive to select the worst 
things to sell.
Adverse selection does not apply only to used cars. It is a problem for many 
parts of the economy—notably for insurance companies, and most notably for 
health insurance companies.
Suppose that a health insurance company were to offer a standard policy 
to everyone with the same premium. The premium would reflect the average 
risk of incurring a medical expense. But that would make the policy look 
very expensive to healthy people, who know that they are less likely than the 
average person to incur medical expenses. So healthy people would be less 
likely than less  healthy people to buy the policy, leaving the health insurance 
company with exactly the customers it doesn’t want: people with a higher - 
than- average risk of needing medical care, who would find the premium to 
be a good deal.
In order to cover its expected losses from this sicker customer pool, the health 
insurance company is compelled to raise premiums, driving away more of the 
remaining healthier customers, and so on. Because the insurance company can’t 
determine who is healthy and who is not, it must charge everyone the same pre-
mium, thereby discouraging healthy people from purchasing policies and encour-
aging unhealthy people to buy policies.
As we discussed in Chapter 18, adverse selection can lead to a phenomenon 
called an adverse selection death spiral as the market for health insurance col-
lapses: insurance companies refuse to offer policies because there is no pre-
mium at which the company can cover its losses. Because of the severe adverse 
selection problems, governments in many advanced countries assume the role 
of providing health insurance to their citizens. As we saw in Chapter 18, the U.S. 
government, through its various health insurance programs like Medicare and 
Medicaid, now disburses almost half the total payments for medical care in the 
United States.
In general, people or firms faced with the problem of adverse selection fol-
low one of several well - established strategies for dealing with it. One strategy 
is screening: using observable information to make inferences about private 
information. As we discussed in Chapter 19, if you apply to purchase health 
insurance, you’ll find that the insurance company will demand documentation 
of your health status in an attempt to “screen out” sicker applicants—people 
they will refuse to insure or will insure only at very high premiums. Auto insur-
ance companies also provide a very good example of the use of screening to 
reduce adverse selection. They may not know whether you are a careful driver, 
but they have statistical data on the accident rates of people who resemble 
your profile—and use those data in setting premiums. A 19-year - old male who 
drives a sports car and has already had a fender - bender is likely to pay a very 
high premium. A 40-year- old female who drives a minivan and has never had 
an accident is likely to pay much less. In some cases, this may be unfair: some 
adolescent males are very careful drivers, and some mature women drive mini-
vans as if they were F-16’s. But nobody can deny that the insurance companies 
are right on average.
Another strategy to counter the problems caused by adverse selection is 
for people who are good prospects to do something signaling their private 
Adverse selection occurs when 
an individual knows more about the 
way things are than other people 
do. Private information leads buyers 
to expect hidden problems in items 
offered for sale, leading to low prices 
and the best items being kept off 
the market.
Adverse selection can be reduced 
through screening: using 
observable information about people 
to make inferences about their 
private information.
Adverse selection can be diminished 
by people signaling their private 
information through actions that 
credibly reveal what they know.

information—taking some action that wouldn’t be worth taking unless they 
were indeed good prospects. For example, reputable used - car dealers often 
offer warranties—promises to repair any problems with the cars they sell 
that arise within a given amount of time. This isn’t just a way of insuring 
their customers against possible expenses; it’s a way of credibly showing that 
they are not selling lemons. As a result, more sales occur and dealers can 
command higher prices for their used cars when they offer warranties.
Finally, in the face of adverse selection, it can be very valuable to establish 
a good reputation: a used - car dealership will often advertise how long it has 
been in business to show that it has continued to satisfy its customers. As a 
result, new customers will be willing to purchase cars and to pay more for that 
dealer’s cars.
Moral Hazard
In the late 1970s, New York and other major cities experienced an epidemic of 
suspicious fires that appeared to be deliberately set. Some of the fires were prob-
ably started by teenagers on a lark, others by gang members struggling over turf. 
But investigators eventually became aware of patterns in a number of the fires. 
Particular landlords who owned several buildings seemed to have an unusually 
large number of their buildings burn down. Although it was difficult to prove, 
police had few doubts that most of these fire - prone landlords were hiring profes-
sional arsonists to torch their own properties.
Why burn your own building? These buildings were typically in declining 
neighborhoods, where rising crime and middle - class flight had led to a decline 
in property values. But the insurance policies on the buildings were written to 
compensate owners based on historical property values, and so would pay the 
owner of a destroyed building more than the building was worth in the current 
market. For an unscrupulous landlord who knew the right people, this presented 
a profitable opportunity.
The arson epidemic became less severe during the 1980s, partly because insur-
ance companies began making it difficult to overinsure properties, and partly 
because a boom in real estate values made many previously arson - threatened 
buildings worth more unburned.
The arson episodes make it clear that it is a bad idea for insurance companies 
to let customers insure buildings for more than their value—it gives the custom-
ers some destructive incentives. You might think, however, that the incentive 
problem would go away as long as the insurance is no more than 100% of the 
value of what is being insured.
But, unfortunately, anything close to 100% insurance still distorts incentives—
it induces policyholders to behave differently than they would in the absence 
of insurance. The reason is that preventing fires requires effort and cost on 
the part of a building’s owner. Fire alarms and sprinkler systems have to be 
kept in good repair, fire safety rules have to be strictly enforced, and so on. All 
of this takes time and money—time and money that the owner may not find 
worth spending if the insurance policy will provide close to full compensation 
for any losses.
Of course, the insurance company could specify in the policy that it won’t pay 
if basic safety precautions have not been taken. But it isn’t always easy to tell how 
careful a building’s owner has been—the owner knows, but the insurance com-
pany does not.
The point is that the building’s owner has private information about his or her 
own actions, about whether he or she has really taken all appropriate precautions. 
As a result, the insurance company is likely to face greater claims than if it were 
able to determine exactly how much effort a building owner exerts to prevent a 
loss. The problem of distorted incentives arises when an individual has private 
A long - term reputation allows an 
individual to reassure others that 
he or she isn’t concealing adverse 
private information.

588    P A R T  9    FAC TO R M A R K E T S A N D R I S K 
information about his or her own actions but someone else bears the costs of a 
lack of care or effort. This is known as moral hazard.
To deal with moral hazard, it is necessary to give individuals with private 
information some personal stake in what happens so they have a reason to 
exert effort even if others cannot verify that they have done so. Moral hazard 
is the reason salespeople in many stores receive a commission on sales: it’s 
hard for managers to be sure how hard the salespeople are really working, 
and if they were paid only a straight salary, they would not have an incentive 
to exert effort to make those sales. As described in the following Economics 
in Action, similar logic explains why many stores and restaurants, even if they 
are part of national chains, are actually franchises, licensed outlets owned by 
the people who run them.
Insurance companies deal with moral hazard by requiring a deductible:
they compensate for losses only above a certain amount, so that coverage is 
always less than 100%. The insurance on your car, for example, may pay for 
repairs only after the first $500 in loss. This means that a careless driver 
who gets into a fender - bender will end up paying $500 for repairs even if he 
is insured, which provides at least some incentive to be careful and reduces 
moral hazard.
In addition to reducing moral hazard, deductibles provide a partial solu-
tion to the problem of adverse selection. Your insurance premium often 
drops substantially if you are willing to accept a large deductible. This is an 
attractive option to people who know they are low - risk customers; it is less 
attractive to people who know they are high - risk—and so are likely to have 
an accident and end up paying the deductible. By offering a menu of policies 
with different premiums and deductibles, insurance companies can screen 
their customers, inducing them to sort themselves out on the basis of their 
private information.
As the example of deductibles suggests, moral hazard limits the ability of the 
economy to allocate risks efficiently. You generally can’t get full (100%) insurance 
on your home or car, even though you would like to buy it, and you bear the risk of 
large deductibles, even though you would prefer not to. The following Economics 
in Action illustrates how in some cases moral hazard limits the ability of investors 
to diversify their investments.

FRANCHISE OWNERS TRY HARDER
W
hen Americans go out for a quick meal, they often end up at one of 
the fast - food chains—McDonald’s, Burger King, and so on. Because 
these are large corporations, most customers probably imagine that the 
people who serve them are themselves employees of large corporations. 
But usually they aren’t. Most fast - food restaurants—for example, 85% of 
McDonald’s outlets—are franchises. That is, some individual has paid the 
parent company for the right to operate a restaurant selling its product; 
he or she may look like an arm of a giant company but is in fact a small - 
business owner.
Becoming a franchisee is not a guarantee of success. You must put up a 
large amount of money, both to buy the license and to set up the restaurant 
itself (to open a Taco Bell, for example, cost $1.1 million to $1.7 million, exclud-
ing land or lease costs, in 2010). And although McDonald’s takes care that its 
franchises are not too close to each other, they often face stiff competition from 
rival chains and even from a few truly independent restaurants. Becoming a 
franchise owner, in other words, involves taking on quite a lot of risk.
But why should people be willing to take these risks? Didn’t we just 
learn that it is better to diversify, to spread your wealth among many 
Franchise owners face risk, which motivates 
g
them to work harder than salaried managers.

Moral hazard occurs when an 
individual knows more about his or 
her own actions than other people 
do. This leads to a distortion of 
incentives to take care or to exert 
effort when someone else bears the 
costs of the lack of care or effort.
A deductible in an insurance policy 
is a sum that the insured individual 
must pay before being compensated 
for a claim.

investments? The logic of diversification would seem to say that it’s better 
for someone with $1.7 million to invest in a wide range of stocks rather than 
put it all into one Taco Bell. This implies that Taco Bell would find it hard to 
attract franchisees: nobody would be willing to be a franchisee unless they 
expected to earn considerably more than they would as a simple hired manag-
er with their wealth invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks. So wouldn’t 
it be more profitable for McDonald’s or Taco Bell simply to hire managers to 
run their restaurants?
It turns out that it isn’t, because the success of a restaurant depends a lot 
on how hard the manager works, on the effort he or she puts into choosing the 
right employees, on keeping the place clean and attractive to customers, and 
so on. Could McDonald’s get the right level of effort from a salaried manager? 
Probably not. The problem is moral hazard: the manager knows whether he or 
she is really putting 100% into the job; but company headquarters, which bears 
the costs of a poorly run restaurant, does not. So a salaried manager, who gets 
a salary even without doing everything possible to make the restaurant a suc-
cess, does not have the incentive to do that extra bit—an incentive the owner 
does have because he or she has a substantial personal stake in the success of 
the restaurant.
In other words, there is a moral hazard problem when a salaried manager 
runs a McDonald’s, where the private information is how hard the manager 
works. Franchising solves this problem. A franchisee, whose wealth is tied up 
in the business and who stands to profit personally from its success, has every 
incentive to work extremely hard.
The result is that fast - food chains rely mainly on franchisees to operate their 
restaurants, even though the contracts with these owner - managers allow the 
franchisees on average to make much more than it would have cost the compa-
nies to employ store managers. The higher earnings of franchisees compensate 
them for the risk they accept, and the companies are compensated by higher 
sales that lead to higher license fees. In addition, franchisees are forbidden by the 
licensing agreement with the company from reducing their risk by taking actions 
such as selling shares of the franchise to outside investors and using the proceeds 
to diversify. It’s an illustration of the fact that moral hazard prevents the elimina-
tion of risk through diversification.

AIG (American International Group) was once the largest insurance company 
in the United States, known for insuring millions of homes and businesses and 
managing the pension plans of millions of workers.
But in September 2008, AIG acquired a much more notorious reputation. It was 
at the epicenter of the crisis sweeping global financial markets because major com-
mercial and investment banks were faced with potentially devastating losses through 
their transactions with AIG. Fearful that a chaotic bankruptcy of AIG would panic the 
already distressed financial markets, the Federal Reserve stepped in and orchestrated 
the largest corporate bailout in U.S. history, paying a total of $182 billion to satisfy 
claims against AIG. In return, American taxpayers became owners of nearly 80% of 
AIG. How did things go so wrong?
AIG’s problems originated not in its main lines of business—property insurance 
and pension management—but in its much smaller Financial Products Division, 
which sold credit-default swaps, or CDS. A CDS is like an insurance policy for an 
investor who buys a bond. A bond is simply an IOU—a promise to repay on the part 
of the borrower (the person or company that issued the bond). But any IOU carries 
with it the possibility that the borrower will default and not pay back the loan. So 
bond investors who wish to protect themselves against the risk of default purchase 
a CDS from a company like AIG. Later, if the borrower defaults, bond investors col-
lect an amount equal to their losses from the company that issued the CDS. 
During the mid-2000s, Joseph Cassano, the head of AIG’s Financial Products 
Division, sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CDSs. They were bought by 
investors in mortgage-backed securities—bonds created by combining thousands of 
American home mortgages. As homeowners paid their monthly mortgages, the own-
ers of the mortgage-backed securities received the interest earned on those mortgages. 
For several years AIG earned billions in premiums from selling CDSs, making 
the Financial Products Division its most profitable department. And there were 
virtually no costs involved because mortgage defaults were low and the Financial 
Products Division was based in London. Its location meant that AIG was not 
required to abide by U.S. insurance regulations to set aside capital to cover poten-
tial losses—despite the fact that AIG, the parent company, was headquartered in 
the United States. As Cassano stated in 2007, “It is hard for us . . . to even see a 
scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing $1 in any of 
those transactions.” Cassano was so confident in his strategy and fearful of outside 
meddling that he prevented AIG’s American auditors from inspecting his books, 
leaving AIG’s management and shareholders in the dark about the risks they faced. 
Yet the hard-to-see scenario appeared in 2008 in cataclysmic form when the 
U.S. housing market crashed. As mortgage defaults surged, investors in mortgage-
backed securities incurred huge losses and turned to AIG to collect. But with no 
capital to cover claims, AIG faced bankruptcy until the U.S. government stepped in. 
Banks such as Goldman Sachs, had made huge profits by putting together low-
quality mortgage-backed securities with high likelihoods of default and then insur-
ing them with AIG. Despite an outcry, Goldman’s claims were paid in full by the 
government because their transaction with AIG was entirely legal. 
QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHT
 1. Did AIG accurately assess the default risk that it insured? Why or why not? 
 2. What did AIG assume about the probabilities of defaults by different homeowners in the

SUMMARY
 1. The expected value of a random variable is the 
weighted average of all possible values, where the 
weight corresponds to the probability of a given 
value occurring.
 2. Risk is uncertainty about future events or states of 
the world. It is financial risk when the uncertainty 
is about monetary outcomes.
 3. Under uncertainty, people maximize expected 
utility. A risk - averse person will choose to 
reduce risk when that reduction leaves the expected 
value of his or her income or wealth unchanged. 
A fair insurance policy has that feature: the 
premium is equal to the expected value of the 
claim. A risk-neutral person is completely insensi-
tive to risk and therefore unwilling to pay any pre-
mium to avoid it.
 4. Risk aversion arises from diminishing marginal 
utility: an additional dollar of income generates 
higher marginal utility in low - income states than 
in high - income states. A fair insurance policy 
increases a risk - averse person’s utility because 
it transfers a dollar from a high - income state (a 
state when no loss occurs) to a low - income state 
(a state when a loss occurs).
 5. Differences in preferences and income or wealth lead 
to differences in risk aversion. Depending on the size 
of the premium, a risk - averse person is willing to 
purchase “unfair” insurance, a policy for which the 
premium exceeds the expected value of the claim. The 
greater your risk aversion, the higher the premium you 
are willing to pay.
 6. There are gains from trade in risk, leading to an effi-
cient allocation of risk: those who are most will-
ing to bear risk put their capital at risk to cover the 
losses of those least willing to bear risk.
 7. Risk can also be reduced through diversification, 
investing in several different things that correspond 
to independent events. The stock market, where 
shares in companies are traded, offers one way to 
diversify. Insurance companies can engage in pool-
ing, insuring many independent events so as to elimi-
nate almost all risk. But when the underlying events 
are positively correlated, all risk cannot be diversi-
fied away.
 8. Private information can cause inefficiency in 
the allocation of risk. One problem is adverse 
selection, private information about the way things 
are. It creates the “lemons problem” in used-car 
markets, where sellers of high - quality cars drop out 
of the market. Adverse selection can be limited in 
several ways—through screening of individuals, 
through the signaling that people use to reveal 
their private information, and through the building 
of a reputation.
 9. A related problem is moral hazard: individuals 
have private information about their actions, which 
distorts their incentives to exert effort or care when 
someone else bears the costs of that lack of effort or 
care. It limits the ability of markets to allocate risk 
efficiently. Insurance companies try to limit moral 
hazard by imposing deductibles, placing more risk on 
the insured.

PROBLEMS
 1. For each of the following situations, calculate the 
expected value.
 a. Tanisha owns one share of IBM stock, which is cur-
rently trading at $80. There is a 50% chance that the 
share price will rise to $100 and a 50% chance that 
it will fall to $70. What is the expected value of the 
future share price?
 b. Sharon buys a ticket in a small lottery. There is 
a probability of 0.7 that she will win nothing, of 
0.2 that she will win $10, and of 0.1 that she will 
win $50. What is the expected value of Sharon’s 
winnings?
 c. Aaron is a farmer whose rice crop depends on the 
weather. If the weather is favorable, he will make a 
profit of $100. If the weather is unfavorable, he will 
make a profit of −$20 (that is, he will lose money). 
The weather forecast reports that the probability of 
weather being favorable is 0.9 and the probability of 
weather being unfavorable is 0.1. What is the expect-
ed value of Aaron’s profit?
 2. Vicky N. Vestor is considering investing some of her 
money in a startup company. She currently has income 
of $4,000, and she is considering investing $2,000 of 
that in the company. There is a 0.5 probability that the 
company will succeed and will pay out $8,000 to Vicky 
(her original investment of $2,000 plus $6,000 of the 
company’s profits). And there is a 0.5 probability that 
the company will fail and Vicky will get nothing (and 
lose her investment). The accompanying table illus-
trates Vicky’s utility function.

 a. Calculate Vicky’s marginal utility of income for each 
income level. Is Vicky risk-averse?
 b. Calculate the expected value of Vicky’s income if she 
makes this investment.
 c. Calculate Vicky’s expected utility from making the 
investment.
 d. What is Vicky’s utility from not making the invest-
ment? Will Vicky therefore invest in the company?
 3. Vicky N. Vestor’s utility function was given in Problem 2. 
As in Problem 2, Vicky currently has income of $4,000. 
She is considering investing in a startup company, 
but the investment now costs $4,000 to make. If 
the company fails, Vicky will get nothing from the 
company. But if the company succeeds, she will get 
$10,000 from the company (her original investment 
of $4,000 plus $6,000 of the company’s profits). Each 
event has a 0.5 probability of occurring. Will Vicky 
invest in the company?
 4. You have $1,000 that you can invest. If you buy Ford 
stock, you face the following returns and probabilities 
from holding the stock for one year: with a probability 
of 0.2 you will get $1,500; with a probability of 0.4 you 
will get $1,100; and with a probability of 0.4 you will get 
$900. If you put the money into the bank, in one year’s 
time you will get $1,100 for certain.
 a. What is the expected value of your earnings from 
investing in Ford stock?
 b. Suppose you are risk-averse. Can we say for sure 
whether you will invest in Ford stock or put your 
money into the bank?
 5. You have $1,000 that you can invest. If you buy General 
Motors stock, then, in one year’s time: with a probabil-
ity of 0.4 you will get $1,600; with a probability of 0.4 
you will get $1,100; and with a probability of 0.2 you 
will get $800. If you put the money into the bank, in one 
year’s time you will get $1,100 for certain.
 a. What is the expected value of your earnings from 
investing in General Motors stock?
 b. Suppose you prefer putting your money into the 
bank to investing it in General Motors stock. What 
does that tell us about your attitude to risk?
 6. Wilbur is an airline pilot who currently has income of 
$60,000. If he gets sick and loses his flight medical cer-
tificate, he loses his job and has only $10,000 income. 
His probability of staying healthy is 0.6, and his prob-
ability of getting sick is 0.4. Wilbur’s utility function is

Wilbur thinks about buying “loss-of-license” insurance 
that will compensate him if he loses his flight medical 
certificate.
 c. One insurance company offers Wilbur full com-
pensation for his income loss (that is, the insurance 
company pays Wilbur $50,000 if he loses his flight 
medical certificate), and it charges a premium of 
$40,000. That is, regardless of whether he loses his 
flight medical certificate, Wilbur’s income after 
insurance will be $20,000. What is Wilbur’s utility? 
Will he buy the insurance?
 d. What is the highest premium Wilbur would just 
be willing to pay for full insurance (insurance that 
completely compensates him for the income loss)?
 7. In 2008, 1 in approximately every 270 cars in the United 
States was stolen. Beth owns a car worth $20,000 and 
is considering purchasing an insurance policy to pro-
tect herself from car theft. For the following questions, 
assume that the chance of car theft is the same in all 
regions and across all car models.
 a. What should the premium for a fair insurance policy 
have been in 2008 for a policy that replaces Beth’s 
car if it is stolen? 
 b. Suppose an insurance company charges 0.6% 
of the car’s value for a policy that pays for 
replacing a stolen car. How much will the policy 
cost Beth?
 c. Will Beth purchase the insurance in part b if she is 
risk-neutral?
 d. Discuss a possible moral hazard problem facing 
Beth’s insurance company if she purchases the 
insurance.

 a. Calculate Hugh’s marginal utility of income. What is 
his attitude toward risk?
 b. Hugh is thinking about gambling in a casino. 
With a probability of 0.5 he will lose $3,000, and 
with a probability of 0.5 he will win $5,000. What 
is the expected value of Hugh’s income? What is 
Hugh’s expected utility? Will he decide to gamble? 
(Suppose that he gets no extra utility from going to 
the casino.)
 c. Suppose that the “spread” (how much he can 
win versus how much he can lose) of the gamble 
narrows, so that with a probability of 0.5 Hugh 
will lose $1,000, and with a probability of 0.5 
he will win $3,000. What is the expected value of 
Hugh’s income? What is his expected utility? Is this 
gamble better for him than the gamble in part b? 
Will he decide to gamble?
 9. Eva is risk-averse. Currently she has $50,000 to invest. 
She faces the following choice: she can invest in the 
stock of a dot-com company, or she can invest in IBM 
stock. If she invests in the dot-com company, then 
with probability 0.5 she will lose $30,000, but with 
probability 0.5 she will gain $50,000. If she invests in 
IBM stock, then with probability 0.5 she will lose only 
$10,000, but with probability 0.5 she will gain only 
$30,000. Can you tell which investment she will prefer 
to make?
 10. Suppose you have $1,000 that you can invest in Ted and 
Larry’s Ice Cream Parlor and/or Ethel’s House of Cocoa. 
The price of a share of stock in either company is $100. 
The fortunes of each company are closely linked to the 
weather. When it is warm, the value of Ted and Larry’s 
stock rises to $150 but the value of Ethel’s stock falls to 
$60. When it is cold, the value of Ethel’s stock rises to 
$150 but the value of Ted and Larry’s stock falls to $60. 
There is an equal chance of the weather being warm or 
cold.
 a. If you invest all your money in Ted and Larry’s, what 
is your expected stock value? What if you invest all 
your money in Ethel’s?
 b. Suppose you diversify and invest half of your $1,000 
in each company. How much will your total stock be 
worth if the weather is warm? What if it is cold?
 c. Suppose you are risk-averse. Would you prefer to put 
all your money in Ted and Larry’s, as in part a? Or 
would you prefer to diversify, as in part b? Explain 
your reasoning.
 11. MidCap Growth and Energy are two portfolios con-
structed and managed by the Vanguard Group of 
mutual funds, comprised of stocks of middle-sized 
U.S. companies and stocks of U.S. energy companies. 
The accompanying table shows historical annualized 
return from the period 2001 to 2011, which suggest the 
expected value of the annual percentage returns associ-
ated with these portfolios.

 b. Juan, a risk-averse investor, chooses to invest in the 
MidCap Growth portfolio. What can be inferred 
about the risk of the two portfolios from Juan’s 
choice of investment? Based on historical perfor-
mance, would a risk-neutral investor ever choose 
MidCap Growth?
 c. Juan is aware that diversification can reduce risk. 
He considers a portfolio in which half his invest-
ment is in MidCap companies and the other half in 
Energy companies. What is the expected value of 
the return for this combined portfolio? Would you 
expect this combined portfolio to be more risky or 
less risky than the MidCap Growth portfolio? Why 
or why not? 
 12. You are considering buying a second-hand Volkswagen. 
From reading car magazines, you know that half of all 
Volkswagens have problems of some kind (they are 
“lemons”) and the other half run just fine (they are 
“plums”). If you knew that you were getting a plum, 
you would be willing to pay $10,000 for it: this is how 
much a plum is worth to you. You would also be will-
ing to buy a lemon, but only if its price was no more 
than $4,000: this is how much a lemon is worth to 
you. And someone who owns a plum would be will-
ing to sell it at any price above $8,000. Someone who 
owns a lemon would be willing to sell it for any price 
above $2,000.
 a. For now, suppose that you can immediately tell 
whether the car that you are being offered is a 
lemon or a plum. Suppose someone offers you a 
plum. Will there be trade?
Now suppose that the seller has private information 
about the car she is selling: the seller knows whether 
she has a lemon or a plum. But when the seller offers 
you a Volkswagen, you do not know whether it is a 
lemon or a plum. So this is a situation of adverse 
selection.
 b. Since you do not know whether you are being 
offered a plum or a lemon, you base your deci-
sion on the expected value to you of a Volkswagen, 
assuming you are just as likely to buy a lemon as a 
plum. Calculate this expected value.
 c. Suppose, from driving the car, the seller knows she 
has a plum. However, you don’t know whether this 
particular car is a lemon or a plum, so the most you 
are willing to pay is your expected value. Will there 
be trade?
 13. You own a company that produces chairs, and you 
are thinking about hiring one more employee. Each 
chair produced gives you revenue of $10. There are 
two potential employees, Fred Ast and Sylvia Low. 
Fred is a fast worker who produces ten chairs per 
day, creating revenue for you of $100. Fred knows 
that he is fast and so will work for you only if you 
pay him more than $80 per day. Sylvia is a slow 
worker who produces only five chairs per day, creat-
ing revenue for you of $50. Sylvia knows that she is 
slow and so will work for you if you pay her more 
than $40 per day. Although Sylvia knows she is slow 
and Fred knows he is fast, you do not know who is 
fast and who is slow. So this is a situation of adverse 
selection.
 a. Since you do not know which type of worker you 
will get, you think about what the expected value of 
your revenue will be if you hire one of the two. What 
is that expected value?
 b. Suppose you offered to pay a daily wage equal to the 
expected revenue you calculated in part a. Whom 
would you be able to hire: Fred, or Sylvia, or both, 
or neither?
 c. If you know whether a worker is fast or slow, which 
one would you prefer to hire and why? Can you 
devise a compensation scheme to guarantee that you 
employ only the type of worker you prefer?
 14. For each of the following situations, do the fol-
lowing: first describe whether it is a situation of 
moral hazard or of adverse selection. Then explain 
what inefficiency can arise from this situation and 
explain how the proposed solution reduces the 
inefficiency.
 a. When you buy a second-hand car, you do not know 
whether it is a lemon (low quality) or a plum (high 
quality), but the seller knows. A solution is for sellers 
to offer a warranty with the car that pays for repair 
costs.
 b. Some people are prone to see doctors unneces-
sarily for minor complaints like headaches, and 
health maintenance organizations do not know 
how urgently you need a doctor. A solution is for 
insurees to have to make a co-payment of a cer-
tain dollar amount (for example, $10) each time 
they visit a health care provider. All insurees are 
risk-averse.
 c. When airlines sell tickets, they do not know 
whether a buyer is a business traveler (who is 
willing to pay a lot for a seat) or a leisure traveler 
(who has a low willingness to pay). A solution for 
a profit-maximizing airline is to offer an expen-
sive ticket that is very flexible (it allows date and 
route changes) and a cheap ticket that is very 
inflexible (it has to be booked in advance and 
cannot be changed).
 d. A company does not know whether workers on an 
assembly line work hard or whether they slack off. 
A solution is to pay the workers “piece rates,” that 
is, pay them according to how much they have pro-
duced each day. All workers are risk-averse, but the 
company is not risk-neutral.
 e. When making a decision about hiring you, pro-
spective employers do not know whether you 
are a productive or unproductive worker. A 
solution is for productive workers to provide 
potential employers with references from previ-
ous employers.

  b.  This illustrates the concept that there are gains from 
trade. Students trade tutoring services based on their 
different abilities in academic subjects.
  c.  This illustrates the concept that when markets don’t 
achieve efficiency, government intervention can improve 
society’s welfare. In this case the market, left alone, will 
permit bars and nightclubs to impose costs on their 
neighbors in the form of loud music, costs that the bars 
and nightclubs have no incentive to take into account. 
This is an inefficient outcome because society as a 
whole can be made better off if bars and nightclubs are 
induced to reduce their noise.
  d. This illustrates the concept that resources should be used 
as efficiently as possible to achieve society’s goals. By clos-
ing neighborhood clinics and shifting funds to the main 
hospital, better health care can be provided at a lower cost.
  e.  This illustrates the concept that markets move toward 
equilibrium. Here, because books with the same amount 
of wear and tear sell for about the same price, no buyer 
or seller can be made better off by engaging in a differ-
ent trade than he or she undertook. This means that the 
market for used textbooks has moved to an equilibrium.
 2. a.  This does not describe an equilibrium situation. Many 
students should want to change their behavior and 
switch to eating at the restaurants. Therefore, the situ-
ation described is not an equilibrium. An equilibrium 
will be established when students are equally as well off 
eating at the restaurants as eating at the dining hall—
which would happen if, say, prices at the restaurants 
were higher than at the dining hall.
  b.  This does describe an equilibrium situation. By chang-
ing your behavior and riding the bus, you would not 
be made better off. Therefore, you have no incentive to 
change your behavior.
1-3 CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
 1. a.  This illustrates the principle that government policies 
can change spending. The tax cut would increase people’s 
after - tax incomes, leading to higher consumer spending.
  b.  This illustrates the principle that one person’s spending 
is another person’s income. As oil companies increase 
their spending on labor by hiring more workers, or pay 
existing workers higher wages, those workers’ incomes 
rise. In turn, these workers increase their consumer 
spending, which becomes income to restaurants and 
other consumer businesses.
  c.  This illustrates the principle that overall spending some-
times gets out of line with the economy’s productive 
capacity. In this case, spending on housing was too high 
relative to the economy’s capacity to create new housing. 
This first led to a rise in house prices, and then—as a 
result—to a rise in overall prices, or inflation.
Solutions to 
Check Your Understanding Questions
This section offers suggested answers to the “Check Your Understanding” questions found 
within chapters.
Chapter One
1-1 CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
 1. a.  This illustrates the concept of opportunity cost. Given 
that a person can only eat so much at one sitting, having 
a slice of chocolate cake requires that you forgo eating 
something else, such as a slice of coconut cream pie.
  b.  This illustrates the concept that resources are scarce. 
Even if there were more resources in the world, the total 
amount of those resources would be limited. As a result, 
scarcity would still arise. For there to be no scarcity, 
there would have to be unlimited amounts of everything 
(including unlimited time in a human life), which is 
clearly impossible.
  c. This illustrates the concept that people usually exploit 
opportunities to make themselves better off. Students 
will seek to make themselves better off by signing up 
for the tutorials of teaching assistants with good repu-
tations and avoiding those teaching assistants with 
poor reputations. It also illustrates the concept that 
resources are scarce. If there were unlimited spaces in 
tutorials with good teaching assistants, they would not 
fill up.
  d. This illustrates the concept of marginal analysis. Your 
decision about allocating your time is a “how much” 
decision: how much time spent exercising versus how 
much time spent studying. You make your decision by 
comparing the benefit of an additional hour of exercis-
ing to its cost, the effect on your grades of one fewer 
hour spent studying. 
 2. a.  Yes. The increased time spent commuting is a cost you 
will incur if you accept the new job. That additional 
time spent commuting—or equivalently, the benefit you 
would get from spending that time doing something 
else—is an opportunity cost of the new job.
  b.  Yes. One of the benefits of the new job is that you will 
be making $50,000. But if you take the new job, you 
will have to give up your current job; that is, you have 
to give up your current salary of $45,000. So $45,000 is 
one of the opportunity costs of taking the new job.
  c.  No. A more spacious office is an additional benefit of 
your new job and does not involve forgoing something 
else. So it is not an opportunity cost.
1-2 CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
 1. a.  This illustrates the concept that markets usually lead 
to efficiency. Any seller who wants to sell a book for at 
least $30 does indeed sell to someone who is willing 
to buy a book for $30. As a result, there is no way to 
change how used textbooks are distributed among buy-
ers and sellers in a way that would make one person 
better off without making someone else worse off.

  c.  False. The production possibility frontier illustrates 
how much of one good an economy must give up to 
get more of another good only when resources are 
used efficiently in production. If an economy is pro-
ducing inefficiently—that is, inside the frontier—then 
it does not have to give up a unit of one good in order 
to get another unit of the other good. Instead, by 
becoming more efficient in production, this economy 
can have more of both goods.
 2. a.  The United States has an absolute advantage in auto-
mobile production because it takes fewer Americans 
(6) to produce a car in one day than Italians (8). The 
United States also has an absolute advantage in washing 
machine production because it takes fewer Americans 
(2) to produce a washing machine in one day than 
Italians (3). 
  b.  In Italy the opportunity cost of a washing machine in 
terms of an automobile is 3∕8: 3∕8 of a car can be pro-
duced with the same number of workers and in the 
same time it takes to produce 1 washing machine. In 
the United States the opportunity cost of a washing 
machine in terms of an automobile is 2∕6 = 1∕3: 1∕3 of a 
car can be produced with the same number of work-
ers and in the same time it takes to produce 1 wash-
ing machine. Since 1∕3 < 3∕8, the United States has a 
comparative advantage in the production of washing 
machines: to produce a washing machine, only 1∕3 of 
a car must be given up in the United States but 3∕8 of a 
car must be given up in Italy. This means that Italy has 
a comparative advantage in automobiles. This can be 
checked as follows. The opportunity cost of an automo-
bile in terms of a washing machine in Italy is 8∕3, equal 
to 22∕3: 22∕3 washing machines can be produced with 
the same number of workers and in the time it takes 
to produce 1 car in Italy. And the opportunity cost of 
an automobile in terms of a washing machine in the 
United States is 6∕2, equal to 3: 3 washing machines 
can be produced with the same number of workers 
and in the time it takes to produce 1 car in the United 
States. Since 22∕3 < 3, Italy has a comparative advan-
tage in producing automobiles.
  c.  The greatest gains are realized when each country 
specializes in producing the good for which it has a 
comparative advantage. Therefore, the United States 
should specialize in washing machines and Italy should 
specialize in automobiles.
 3.   At a trade of 10 U.S. large jets for 15 Brazilian small 
jets, Brazil gives up less for a large jet than it would if 
it were building large jets itself. Without trade, Brazil 
gives up 3 small jets for each large jet it produces. With 
trade, Brazil gives up only 1.5 small jets for each large 
jet from the United States. Likewise, the United States 
gives up less for a small jet than it would if it were pro-
ducing small jets itself. Without trade, the United States 
gives up 3∕4 of a large jet for each small jet. With trade, 
the United States gives up only 2∕3 of a large jet for each 
small jet from Brazil.

for use in producing Dreamliners and small jets chang-

  b.  True. A technological change that allows Boeing to build

results in a change in its production possibility frontier. 
This is illustrated in the accompanying figure: the new 
production possibility frontier is represented by the line 
labeled “Boeing’s new PPF,” and the original production 
frontier is represented by the line labeled “Boeing’s orig-
inal PPF.” Since the maximum quantity of Dreamliners 
that Boeing can build is the same as before, the new 
production possibility frontier intersects the vertical 
axis at the same point as the original frontier. But since 
the maximum possible quantity of small jets is now 
greater than before, the new frontier intersects the hori-
zontal axis to the right of the original frontier.

 1.   A producer supplies each pepper if the price is greater 
than (or just equal to) the producer’s cost of producing 
that pepper. The supply schedule is constructed by ask-
ing how many peppers will be supplied at any price. The 
table at top right illustrates the supply schedule.
    When the price is $0.70, Cara’s producer surplus 
from the first pepper is $0.60, from her second pepper 
$0.60, from her third pepper $0.30, from her fourth 
pepper $0.10, and she does not supply any more pep-
pers. Cara’s individual producer surplus is therefore 
$1.60. Jamie’s producer surplus from his first pepper 
is $0.40, from his second pepper $0.20, from his third 
pepper $0.00 (since the price is exactly equal to his cost, 
he sells the third pepper but receives no producer sur-
plus from it), and he does not supply any more peppers. 
Jamie’s individual producer surplus is therefore $0.60. 
Total producer surplus at a price of $0.70 is therefore 
$1.60 + $0.60 = $2.20.

 1.   The quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied 
at a price of $0.50, the equilibrium price. At that 
price, a total quantity of five peppers will be bought 
and sold. Casey will buy three peppers and receive 
consumer surplus of $0.40 on his first, $0.20 on his 
second, and $0.00 on his third pepper. Josey will buy 
two peppers and receive consumer surplus of $0.30 
on her first and $0.10 on her second pepper. Total 
consumer surplus is therefore $1.00. Cara will sup-
ply three peppers and receive producer surplus of 
$0.40 on her first, $0.40 on her second, and $0.10 on 
her third pepper. Jamie will supply two peppers and 
receive producer surplus of $0.20 on his first and 
$0.00 on his second pepper. Total producer surplus is 
therefore $1.10. Total surplus in this market is there-
fore $1.00 + $1.10 = $2.10.
 2. a.  If Josey consumes one fewer pepper, she loses $0.60 (her 
willingness to pay for her second pepper); if Casey con-
sumes one more pepper, he gains $0.30 (his willingness 
to pay for his fourth pepper). This results in an overall 
loss of consumer surplus of $0.60 − $0.30 = $0.30.

  When the price is $0.40, Casey’s consumer surplus 
from the first pepper is $0.50, from his second pepper 
$0.30, from his third pepper $0.10, and he does not 
buy any more peppers. Casey’s individual consumer 
surplus is therefore $0.90. Josey’s consumer surplus 
from her first pepper is $0.40, from her second pepper 
$0.20, from her third pepper $0.00 (since the price 
is exactly equal to her willingness to pay, she buys 
the third pepper but receives no consumer surplus 
from it), and she does not buy any more peppers. 
Josey’s individual consumer surplus is therefore 
$0.60. Total consumer surplus at a price of $0.40 is 
therefore $0.90 + $0.60 = $1.50.

diagram by the movement from point E to point B along 
the demand curve.
  c.  Under a price ceiling, the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied; as a result, shortages arise. In 
this case, there will be a shortage of 800 parking spaces. 
It is shown by the horizontal distance between points A 
and B.
  d. Price ceilings result in wasted resources. The additional 
time fans spend to guarantee a parking space is wasted 
time.
  e.  Price ceilings lead to inefficient allocation of a good—
here, the parking spaces—to consumers.
  f.  Price ceilings lead to black markets.
 2. a.  False. By lowering the price that producers receive, 
a price ceiling leads to a decrease in the quantity 
supplied.
  b.  True. A price ceiling leads to a lower quantity supplied 
than in an efficient, unregulated market. As a result, 
some people who would have been willing to pay the 
market price, and so would have gotten the good in 
an unregulated market, are unable to obtain it when a 
price ceiling is  imposed.
  c.  True. Those producers who still sell the product now 
receive less for it and are therefore worse off. Other 
producers will no longer find it worthwhile to sell the 
product at all and so will also be made worse  off.
 3. a.  Since the apartment is rented quickly at the same price, 
there is no change (either gain or loss) in producer 
surplus. So any change in total surplus comes from 
changes in consumer surplus. When you are evicted, 
the amount of consumer surplus you lose is equal to 
the difference between your willingness to pay for the 
  b.  Cara’s cost of the last pepper she supplied (the third 
pepper) is $0.40, and Jamie’s cost of producing one more 
(his third pepper) is $0.70. Total producer surplus there-
fore falls by $0.70 − $0.40 = $0.30.
  c.  Josey’s willingness to pay for her second pepper is $0.60; 
this is what she would lose if she were to consume one 
fewer pepper. Cara’s cost of producing her third pepper 
is $0.40; this is what she would save if she were to pro-
duce one fewer pepper. If we therefore reduced quantity 
by one pepper, we would lose $0.60 − $0.40 = $0.20 of 
total surplus.
 3.  The new guideline is likely to reduce the total life span 
of kidney recipients because older recipients (those with 
small children) are more likely to get a kidney com-
pared to the original guideline. As a result, total surplus 
is likely to fall. However, this new policy can be justi-
fied as an acceptable sacrifice of efficiency for fairness 
because it’s a desirable goal to reduce the chance of a 
small child losing a parent.

 1.   When these rights are separated, someone who owns 
both the above - ground and the mineral rights can sell 
each of these separately in the market for above - ground 
rights and the market for mineral rights. And each of 
these markets will achieve efficiency: If the market price 
for above - ground rights is higher than the seller’s cost, 
the seller will sell that right and total surplus increases. 
If the market price for mineral rights is higher than 
the seller’s cost, the seller will sell that right and total 
surplus increases. If the two rights, however, cannot 
be sold separately, a seller can only sell both rights or 
none at all. Imagine a situation in which the seller val-
ues the mineral right highly (that is, has a high cost of 
selling it) but values the above - ground right much less. 
If the two rights are separate, the owner may sell the 
above - ground right (increasing total surplus) but not the 
mineral right. If, however, the two rights cannot be sold 
separately, and the owner values the mineral right suf-
ficiently highly, she may not sell either of the two rights. 
In this case, surplus could have been created through 
the sale of the above - ground right but goes unrealized 
because the two rights could not be sold separately.
 2.   There will be many sellers willing to sell their books but 
only a few buyers who want to buy books at that price. As 
a result, only a few transactions will actually occur, and 
many transactions that would have been mutually benefi-
cial will not take place. This, of course, is inefficient.
 3.   Markets, alas, do not always lead to efficiency. When 
there is market failure, the market outcome may be 
inefficient. This can occur for three main reasons. 
Markets can fail when, in an attempt to capture 
more surplus, one party—a monopolist, for instance—
prevents mutually beneficial trades from occurring. 
Markets can also fail when one individual’s actions have 
side  effects—externalities—on the welfare of others. 
Finally, markets can fail when the goods themselves—
such as goods about which some relevant information is 
private—are unsuited for efficient management by mar-
kets. And when markets don’t achieve efficiency, govern-
ment intervention can improve society’s welfare.

  b.  Those who buy gas at the higher price of PF will probably 
receive better service; this is an example of inefficiently 
high quality caused by a price floor as gas station own-
ers compete on quality rather than price. But opponents 
are correct to claim that consumers are generally worse 
off—those who buy at PF would have been happy to 
buy at PE, and many who were willing to buy at a price 
between PE and PF are now unwilling to buy. This is indi-
cated on the graph by the fall in the quantity demanded 
along the demand curve, from point E to point A.
  c.  Proponents are wrong because consumers and some gas 
station owners are hurt by the price floor, which creates 
“missed opportunities”—desirable transactions between 
consumers and station owners that never take place. The 
deadweight loss, the amount of total surplus lost because 
of missed opportunities, is indicated by the shaded area 
in the accompanying figure. Moreover, the inefficiency 
of wasted resources arises as consumers spend time 
and money driving to other states. The price floor also 
tempts people to engage in black market activity. With 
the price floor, only QF units are sold. But at prices 
between PE and PF, there are drivers who cumulatively 
want to buy more than QF and owners who are willing to 
sell to them, a situation likely to lead to illegal  activity.

apartment and the rent - controlled price. When the 
apartment is rented to someone else at the same price, 
the amount of consumer surplus the new renter gains is 
equal to the difference between his or her willingness to 
pay and the rent - controlled price. So this will be a pure 
transfer of surplus from one person to another only if 
both your willingness to pay and the new renter’s will-
ingness to pay are the same. Since under rent  control 
apartments are not always allocated to those who have 
the highest willingness to pay, the new renter’s willing-
ness to pay may be either equal to, lower than, or higher 
than your willingness to pay. If the new renter’s willing-
ness to pay is lower than yours, this will create addition-
al deadweight loss: there is some additional consumer 
surplus that is lost. However, if the new renter’s will-
ingness to pay is higher than yours, this will create an 
increase in total surplus, as the new renter gains more 
consumer surplus than you lost.
  b.  This creates deadweight loss: if you were able to give the 
ticket away, someone else would be able to obtain con-
sumer surplus, equal to his or her willingness to pay for 
the ticket. You neither gain nor lose any surplus, since 
you cannot go to the concert whether or not you give the 
ticket away. If you were able to sell the ticket, the buyer 
would obtain consumer surplus equal to the differ-
ence between his or her willingness to pay for the ticket 
and the price at which you sell the ticket. In addition, 
you would obtain producer surplus equal to the differ-
ence between the price at which you sell the ticket and 
your cost of selling the ticket (which, since you won the 
ticket, is presumably zero). Since the restriction to nei-
ther sell nor give away the ticket means that this surplus 
cannot be obtained by anybody, it creates deadweight 
loss. If you could give the ticket away, as described 
above, there would be consumer surplus that accrues 
to the recipient of the ticket; and if you give the ticket 
to the person with the highest willingness to pay, there 
would be no deadweight loss.
  c.  This creates deadweight loss. If students buy ice cream 
on campus, they obtain consumer surplus: their willing-
ness to pay must be higher than the price of the ice cream. 
Your college obtains producer surplus: the price is 
higher than your college’s cost of selling the ice cream. 
Prohibiting the sale of ice cream on campus means that 
these two sources of total surplus are lost: there is dead-
weight loss.
  d. Given that your dog values ice cream equally as much 
as you do, this is a pure transfer of surplus. As you lose 
consumer surplus, your dog gains equally as much con-
sumer surplus.

 1.   By the midpoint method, the percent change in the 
price of strawberries is
$1.00 − $1.50
($1.50 + $1.00)/2  × 100 = $0.50
$1.25  × 100 = −40%
  
  Similarly, the percent change in the quantity of straw-
berries demanded is
200,000 − 100,000
(100,000 + 200,000)/2 × 100 = 100,000
150,000 × 100 = 67%
  
  Dropping the minus sign, the price elasticity of demand 
using the midpoint method is 67%/40% = 1.7. 
 2.   By the midpoint method, the percent change in the 
quantity of movie tickets demanded in going from 4,000 
tickets to 5,000 tickets is
5,000 − 4,000
(4,000 + 5,000)/2 × 100 = 1,000
4,500 × 100 = 22%
  
  Since the price elasticity of demand is 1 at the current 
consumption level, it will take a 22% reduction in the 
price of movie tickets to generate a 22% increase in 
quantity  demanded.
 3.   Since price rises, we know that quantity demanded 
must fall. Given the current price of $0.50, a $0.05 
increase in price represents a 10% change, using the 
method in Equation 6-2. So the price elasticity of 
demand is
change in quantity demanded
10%
 = 1.2 
  
  so that the percent change in quantity demanded is 
12%. A 12% decrease in quantity demanded represents 
100,000 × 0.12, or 12,000 sandwiches.

 1. a.  Elastic demand. Consumers are highly responsive to 
changes in price. For a rise in price, the quantity effect 
(which tends to reduce total revenue) outweighs the 
price effect (which tends to increase total revenue). 
Overall, this leads to a fall in total  revenue.
  b.  Unit - elastic demand. Here the revenue lost to the fall 
in price is exactly equal to the revenue gained from 
higher sales. The quantity effect exactly offsets the 
price  effect.
  c.  Inelastic demand. Consumers are relatively unrespon-
sive to changes in price. For consumers to purchase 
a given percent increase in output, the price must fall 
by an even greater percent. The price effect of a fall in 
price (which tends to reduce total revenue) outweighs 
the quantity effect (which tends to increase total rev-
enue). As a result, total revenue decreases.
  d. Inelastic demand. Consumers are relatively unrespon-
sive to price, so a given percent fall in output is accom-
panied by an even greater percent rise in price. The 
price effect of a rise in price (which tends to increase 
total revenue) outweighs the quantity effect (which 
tends to reduce total revenue). As a result, total revenue 
increases. 
  b.  At 6 million rides, the supply price is $3 per ride, repre-

points A and B.
  c.  The quota discourages 4 million mutually beneficial

  d. At 9 million rides, the demand price is $5.50 per ride, 
indicated by point C in the accompanying figure, and 
the supply price is $4.50 per ride, indicated by point D. 
The quota rent is the difference between the demand 
price and the supply price: $1. The deadweight loss is 
represented by the shaded triangle in the figure. As 
you can see, the deadweight loss is smaller when the 
quota is set at 9 million rides than when it is set at 
6 million rides.

 2.  The accompanying figure shows a decrease in demand 
by 4 million rides, represented by a leftward shift of 
the demand curve from D1 to D2: at any given price, the 
quantity demanded falls by 4 million rides. (For example, 
at a price of $5, the quantity demanded falls from 10 mil-
lion to 6 million rides per year.) This eliminates the effect 
of a quota limit of 8 million rides. At point E2, the new 
market equilibrium, the equilibrium quantity is equal 
to the quota limit; as a result, the quota has no effect on 
the market.

 1.   The following figure shows that, after introduction of 
the excise tax, the price paid by consumers rises to 
$1.20; the price received by producers falls to $0.90. 
Consumers bear $0.20 of the $0.30 tax per pound of 
butter; producers bear $0.10 of the $0.30 tax per pound 
of butter. The tax drives a wedge of $0.30 between the 
price paid by consumers and the price received by pro-
ducers. As a result, the quantity of butter bought and 
sold is now 9 million pounds.

 2.   The fact that demand is very inelastic means that 
consumers will reduce their demand for textbooks 
very little in response to an increase in the price 
caused by the tax. The fact that supply is somewhat 
elastic means that suppliers will respond to the fall in 
the price by reducing supply. As a result, the incidence 
of the tax will fall heavily on consumers of economics 
textbooks and very little on publishers, as shown in the 
accompanying figure.

 3.   True. When a substitute is readily available, demand is 
elastic. This implies that producers cannot easily pass 
on the cost of the tax to consumers because consumers 
will respond to an increased price by switching to the 
substitute. Furthermore, when producers have difficulty 
adjusting the amount of the good produced, supply is 
inelastic. That is, producers cannot easily reduce output 
in response to a lower price net of tax. So the tax bur-
den will fall more heavily on producers than consumers.
 2. a.  The demand of an accident victim for a blood transfu-
sion is very likely to be perfectly inelastic because there 
is no substitute and it is necessary for survival. The 
demand curve will be vertical, at a quantity equal to the 
needed transfusion quantity. 
  b.  Students’ demand for green erasers is likely to be perfect-
ly elastic because there are easily available substitutes: 
nongreen erasers. The demand curve will be horizontal, 
at a price equal to that of non-green  erasers.

 1.   By the midpoint method, the percent increase in 
Chelsea’s income is
$18,000 − $12,000
($12,000 + $18,000)/2 × 100 = $6,000
$15,000 × 100 = 40%
  
  Similarly, the percent increase in her consumption of 
CDs is
40  10
(10  40)/2  × 100 = 30
25 × 100 = 120%
  
  So Chelsea’s income elasticity of demand for CDs is 
120%/40% = 3.
 2.   Sanjay’s consumption of expensive restaurant meals 
will fall more than 10% because a given percent change 
in income (a fall of 10% here) induces a larger percent 
change in consumption of an income-elastic good.
 3.   The cross - price elasticity of demand is 5%/20% = 0.25. 
Since the cross - price elasticity of demand is positive, the 
two goods are substitutes.

number of hours of web - design services contracted is
500,000 − 300,000
(300,000 + 500,000)/2 × 100 = 200,000
400,000 × 100 = 50%
  
  Similarly, the percent change in the price of web - design 
services is:
$150 − $100
($100 + $150)/2 × 100 = $50
$125 × 100 = 40%
  
  The price elasticity of supply is 50%/40% = 1.25. So sup-
ply is elastic.
 2.   True. An increase in demand raises price. If the price 
elasticity of supply of milk is low, then relatively little 
additional supply will be forthcoming as the price rises. 
As a result, the price of milk will rise substantially to 
satisfy the increased demand for milk. If the price elas-
ticity of supply is high, then a relatively large amount of 
additional supply will be produced as the price rises. As 
a result, the price of milk will rise only by a little to sat-
isfy the higher demand for milk.
 3.   False. It is true that long - run price elasticities of supply 
are generally larger than short - run elasticities of sup-
ply. But this means that the short - run supply curves are 
generally steeper, not flatter, than the long - run supply 
curves.
 4.   True. When supply is perfectly elastic, the supply curve 
is a horizontal line. So a change in demand has no effect 
on price; it affects only the quantity bought  and sold.

loss from this excise tax is $1.20 − ($0.20 + $0.80) =

 2. a.  The demand for gasoline is inelastic because there is no

 1. a.  Since drivers are the beneficiaries of highway safety 
programs, this tax performs well according to the ben-
efits principle. But since the level of the tax does not 
depend on ability to pay the tax, it does not perform 
well according to the ability - to - pay principle. Since 
higher-income car purchasers are likely to spend more 
on a new car, a tax assessed as a percentage of the 
purchase price of the car would perform better on the 
ability - to - pay principle. A $500-per-car tax will cause 
people to buy fewer new cars, but a percentage-based 
tax will cause people to buy fewer cars and less expen-
sive cars.

 4.   The fact that supply is very inelastic means that produc-

response to the fall in price caused by the tax. Demand, 
on the other hand, will fall in response to an increase in

the incidence of the tax will fall heavily on producers

 1. a.  Without the excise tax, Zhang, Yves, Xavier, and Walter 
sell, and Ana, Bernice, Chizuko, and Dagmar buy one 
can of soda each, at $0.40 per can. So the quantity 
bought and sold is 4.
  b.  With the excise tax, Zhang and Yves sell, and Ana and 
Bernice buy one can of soda each. So the quantity 
bought and sold is 2.
  c.  Without the excise tax, Ana’s individual consumer 
surplus is $0.70 − $0.40 = $0.30, Bernice’s is $0.60 − 
$0.40 = $0.20, Chizuko’s is $0.50 − $0.40 = $0.10, and 
Dagmar’s is $0.40 − $0.40 = $0.00. Total consumer 
surplus is $0.30 + $0.20 + $0.10 + $0.00 = $0.60. With 
the tax, Ana’s individual consumer surplus is $0.70 − 
$0.60 = $0.10 and Bernice’s is $0.60 − $0.60 = $0.00. 
Total consumer surplus post - tax is $0.10 + $0.00 = 
$0.10. So the total consumer surplus lost because of 
the tax is $0.60 − $0.10 = $0.50.

individual producer surplus is $0.20 − $0.10 = $0.10 and 
Yves’s is $0.20 − $0.20 = $0.00. Total producer surplus

 1. a.  To determine comparative advantage, we must com-
pare the two countries’ opportunity costs for a given 
good. Take the opportunity cost of 1 ton of corn in 
terms of bicycles. In China, the opportunity cost of 
1 bicycle is 0.01 ton of corn; so the opportunity cost 
of 1 ton of corn is 1/0.01 bicycles = 100 bicycles. The 
United States has the comparative advantage in corn 
since its opportunity cost in terms of bicycles is 50, a 
smaller number. Similarly, the opportunity cost in the 
United States of 1 bicycle in terms of corn is 1/50 ton 
of corn = 0.02 ton of corn. This is greater than 0.01, 
the Chinese opportunity cost of 1 bicycle in terms of 
corn, implying that China has a comparative advantage 
in bicycles.
  b.  Given that the United States can produce 200,000 
bicycles if no corn is produced, it can produce 200,000 
bicycles × 0.02 ton of corn/bicycle = 4,000 tons of corn 
when no bicycles are produced. Likewise, if China can 
produce 3,000 tons of corn if no bicycles are produced, 
it can produce 3,000 tons of corn × 100 bicycles/ton of 
corn = 300,000 bicycles if no corn is produced. These 
points determine the vertical and horizontal intercepts 
of the U.S. and Chinese production possibility frontiers,

that people who stay in hotels have higher   income com-
pared to those who don’t, the tax performs well accord-
ing to the ability - to - pay principle. It will distort the 
action of staying in a hotel room in this area, resulting 
in fewer nights of hotel room stays. 
  c.  This tax performs well according to the benefits prin-
ciple because local homeowners are the users of local 
schools. It also performs well according to the ability -
to- pay principle because it is assessed as a percent-
age of home value: higher-income residents, who own 
more expensive homes, will pay higher taxes. It will 
distort the action of buying a house in this area ver-
sus another area with a lower property tax rate or the 
action of making changes to a house that increase its 
assessed value.
  d. This tax performs well according to the benefits prin-
ciple because food consumers are the beneficiaries of 
government food safety programs. It does not perform 
well according to the ability - to - pay principle because 
food is a necessity, and lower - income people will pay 
approximately as much as higher - income people. This 
tax will distort the action of buying food, leading people 
to purchase cheaper varieties of food.

 1. a.  The marginal tax rate for someone with income of 
$5,000 is 1%: for each additional $1 in income, $0.01 
or 1%, is taxed away. This person pays total tax of 
$5,000 × 1% = $50, which is ($50/$5,000) × 100 = 1% of 
his or her income.
  b.  The marginal tax rate for someone with income of 
$20,000 is 2%: for each additional $1 in income, $0.02 
or 2%, is taxed away. This person pays total tax 
of $10,000 × 1% + $10,000 × 2% = $300, which is 
($300/$20,000) × 100 = 1.5% of his or her income.
  c.  Since the high - income taxpayer pays a larger percentage 
of his or her income than the low - income taxpayer, this 
tax is progressive.
 2.   A 1% tax on consumption spending means that a fam-
ily earning $15,000 and spending $10,000 will pay a 
tax of 1% × $10,000 = $100, equivalent to 0.67% of its 
income; ($100/$15,000) × 100 = 0.67%. But a family 
earning $10,000 and spending $8,000 will pay a tax 
of 1% × $8,000 = $80, equivalent to 0.80% of its 
income; ($80/$10,000) × 100 = 0.80%. So the tax is 
regressive, since the lower-income family pays a 
higher percentage of its income in tax than the higher-
income family.
 3. a.  False. Recall that a seller always bears some burden of 
a tax as long as his or her supply of the good is not per-
fectly elastic. Since the supply of labor a worker offers 
is not perfectly elastic, some of the payroll tax will be 
borne by the worker, and therefore the tax will affect 
the person’s incentive to take a job.
  b.  False. Under a proportional tax, the percentage of the 
tax base is the same for everyone. Under a lump-sum 
tax, the total tax paid is the same for everyone, regard-
less of their income. A lump-sum tax is regressive.

advantage over domestic butter, imports will cease, 
and domestic producers will capture all the feasible 
sales to domestic consumers, selling amount QA in 
the accompanying figure. But if the tariff is less than 
$0.50—say, only $0.25—the price paid by domestic 
consumers for a pound of imported butter is $0.50 + 
$0.25 = $0.75, $0.25 cheaper than a pound of domestic 
butter. American butter producers will gain sales in 
the amount of Q2 − Q1 as a result of the $0.25 tariff. 
But this is smaller than the amount they would have 
gained under the $0.50 tariff, the amount QA − Q1.

 1.   There are many fewer businesses that use steel as an 
input than there are consumers who buy sugar or cloth-
ing. So it will be easier for such businesses to communi-
cate and coordinate among themselves to lobby against 
tariffs than it will be for consumers. In addition, each 
business will perceive that the cost of a steel tariff is 
quite costly to its profits, but an individual consumer is 
either unaware of or perceives little loss from tariffs on 
sugar or  clothing. The tariffs were indeed lifted at the 
end of 2003.
 2.   Countries are often tempted to protect domestic 
industries by claiming that an import poses a quality, 
health, or environmental danger to domestic consum-
ers. A WTO official should examine whether domestic 
producers are subject to the same stringency in the 
application of quality, health, or environmental regula-
tions as foreign producers. If they are, then it is more 
likely that the regulations are for legitimate, non– trade 
protection purposes; if they are not, then it is more 
likely that the regulations are intended as trade protec-
tion measures.

an accounting profit of $125,000 by choosing to be a 
machinist. Summing, her economic profit from choos-
ing a career as a machinist over a career in advertising 
is $125,000 − $27,000 = $98,000. In contrast, her eco-
nomic profit from choosing the alternative, a career in 
advertising over a career as a machinist, is −$125,000 + 
$27,000 = −$98,000. By the principle of “either–or” deci-
sion making, Ashley should choose to be a machinist 
because that career has a positive economic profit.

superior to it. But you must now compare B versus C. 
You should then choose the alternative—B or C—that

 1.   From Table 10-3 you can see that Sammy’s marginal util-
ity per dollar from increasing his consumption of clams 
from 3 pounds to 4 pounds and his marginal utility 
per dollar from increasing his consumption of potatoes 
from 9 to 10 pounds are the same, 0.75 utils. But a con-
sumption bundle consisting of 4 pounds of clams and 
10 pounds of potatoes is not Sammy’s optimal consump-
tion bundle because it is not affordable given his income 
of $20; 4 pounds of clams and 10 pounds of potatoes costs 
$4 × 4 + $2 × 10 = $36, $16 more than Sammy’s income. 
This can be illustrated with Sammy’s budget line from 
Figure 10-3: a bundle of 4 pounds of clams and 10 pounds 
of potatoes is represented by point X in the accompanying

must accurately measure all opportunity costs. Then 
calculate the economic payoff of the decision relative

same choice after this comparison, then you have made 
a rational choice. If not, then the choice was irrational.

 1.   Consuming a unit that generates negative marginal utility 
leaves the consumer with lower total utility than not con-
suming that unit at all. A rational consumer, a consumer 
who maximizes utility, would not do that. For example, 
from Figure 10-1 you can see that Cassie receives 64 utils 
if she consumes 8 clams; but if she consumes the 9th 
clam, she loses a util, netting her a total utility of only 63 
utils. So whenever consuming a unit generates negative 
marginal utility, the consumer is made better off by not 
consuming that unit, even when that unit is free.
 2.   Since Marta has diminishing marginal utility of coffee, 
her first cup of coffee of the day generates the greatest 
increase in total utility. Her third and last cup of the day 
generates the least.
 3. a.  Mabel has increasing marginal utility of exercising

 2.   Sammy’s maximum utility per dollar is generated when 
he goes from consuming 0 to 1 pound of clams (3.75

utils). But this bundle consisting of 1 pound of clams 
and 1 pound of potatoes generates only 26.5 utils for 
him. Instead, Sammy should choose the consumption 
bundle that satisfies his budget constraint and for which 
the marginal utility per dollar for both goods  is equal.

 1. a.  Since spending on orange juice is a small share of 
Clare’s spending, the income effect from a rise in the 
price of orange juice is insignificant. Only the substitu-
tion effect, represented by the substitution of lemonade 
in place of orange juice, is significant.
  b.  Since rent is a large share of Delia’s expenditures, the 
increase in rent generates a significant income effect, 
making Delia feel poorer. Since housing is a normal 
good for Delia, the income and substitution effects move 
in the same direction, leading her to reduce her con-
sumption of housing by moving to a smaller apartment.
  c.  Since a meal ticket is a significant share of the students’ 
living costs, an increase in its price will generate a 
significant income effect. Because cafeteria meals are 
an inferior good, the substitution effect (which would 
induce students to substitute restaurant meals in place 
of cafeteria meals) and the income effect (which would 
induce them to eat in the cafeteria more often because 
they are poorer) move in opposite directions.
 2.   In order to determine whether any good is a Giffen 
good, you must first establish whether it is an inferior 
good. In other words, if students’ incomes decrease, 
other things equal, does the quantity of cafeteria meals 
demanded increase? Once you have established that the 
good is an inferior good, you must then establish that 
the income effect outweighs the substitution effect. That 
is, as the price of cafeteria meals rises, other things 
equal, does the quantity of cafeteria meals demanded 
increase? Be careful that, in fact, all other things 
remain equal. But if the quantity of cafeteria meals 
demanded truly increases in response to a price rise, 
you really have found a Giffen good.

firm makes choice 1, the total cost of producing 12,000 
units of output is $8,000 + 12,000 × $1.00 = $20,000. The 
average total cost of producing 12,000 units of output is 
therefore $20,000/12,000 = $1.67. The other average total 
costs are calculated similarly.

  So if the firm wanted to produce 12,000 units, it would 
make choice 1 because this gives it the lowest average 
total cost. If it wanted to produce 22,000 units, it would 
make choice 2. If it wanted to produce 30,000 units, it 
would make choice 3.
  b.  Having historically produced 12,000 units, the 
firm would have adopted choice 1. When produc-
ing 12,000 units, the firm would have had an aver-
age total cost of $1.67. When output jumps to 22,000 
units, the firm cannot alter its choice of fixed cost 
in the short run, so its average total cost in the short 
run will be $1.36. In the long run, however, it will 
adopt choice 2, making its average total cost fall 
to $1.30.
  c.  If the firm believes that the increase in demand is tem-
porary, it should not alter its fixed cost from choice 1 
because choice 2 generates higher average total cost 
as soon as output falls back to its original quantity of 
12,000 units: $1.75 versus $1.67.
 2. a.  This firm is likely to experience constant returns to 
scale. To increase output, the firm must hire more 
workers, purchase more computers, and pay additional 
telephone charges. Because these inputs are easily avail-
able, their long - run average total cost is unlikely to 
change as output increases.
  b.  This firm is likely to experience decreasing returns 
to scale. As the firm takes on more projects, the 
costs of communication and coordination required 
to implement the expertise of the firm’s owner are 
likely to increase. 
  c.  This firm is likely to experience increasing returns to 
scale. Because diamond   mining requires a large initial 
set-  up cost for excavation equipment, long - run average 
total cost will fall as output increases.
 3.   The accompanying diagram shows the long - run average 
total cost curve (LRATC) and the short - run average total 
cost curve corresponding to a long - run output choice 
of 5 cases of salsa (ATC5). The curve ATC5 shows the 
short-run average total cost for which the level of fixed 
cost minimizes average total cost at an output of 5 cases 
of salsa. This is confirmed by the fact that at 5 cases 
per day, ATC5 touches LRATC, the long - run average total 
cost curve.
for each output level is found by summing the mar-
ginal cost for all the pies produced to reach that 
output level. So, for example, the variable cost of 
three pies is $1.00 + $1.50 + $2.25 = $4.75. Average 
fixed cost for Q pies is calculated as $9.00/Q since 
fixed cost is $9.00. Average variable cost for Q pies 
is equal to variable cost for the Q pies divided by Q; 
for example, the average variable cost of five pies 
is $13.19/5, or approximately $2.64. Finally, average 
total cost can be calculated in two equivalent ways: 
as TC/Q or as AVC + AFC.

  b.  The spreading effect dominates the diminishing returns 
effect when average total cost is falling: the fall in AFC 
dominates the rise in AVC for pies 1 to 4. The diminish-
ing returns effect dominates when average total cost is 
rising: the rise in AVC dominates the fall in AFC for pies 
5 and 6.
  c.  Alicia’s minimum - cost output is 4 pies; this generates 
the lowest average total cost, $4.28. When output is 
less than 4, the marginal cost of a pie is less than the 
average total cost of the pies already produced. So 
making an additional pie lowers average total cost. For 
example, the marginal cost of pie 3 is $2.25, whereas 
the average total cost of pies 1 and 2 is $5.75. So mak-
ing pie 3 lowers average total cost to $4.58, equal to 
(2 × $5.75 + $2.25)/3. When output is more than 4, 
the marginal cost of a pie is greater than the average 
total cost of the pies already produced. Consequently, 
making an additional pie raises average total cost. 
So, although the marginal cost of pie 6 is $7.59, the 
average total cost of pies 1 through 5 is $4.44. Making 
pie 6 raises average total cost to $4.96, equal to 
(5 × $4.44 + $7.59)/6.

  b.  When price is greater than minimum average variable 
cost (the shut - down price) but less than minimum aver-
age total cost (the break - even price), the firm should 
continue to operate in the short   run even though it is 
making a loss. This is optimal for prices in the range P1 
to P2 and for quantities Q1 to Q2.
  c.  When price exceeds minimum average total cost (the 
break - even price), the firm makes a profit. This hap-
pens for prices in excess of P2 and results in quantities 
greater than Q2.
 2.   This is an example of a temporary shut - down by a 
firm when the market price lies below the shut - down 
price, the minimum average variable cost. In this 
case, the market price is the price of a lobster meal 
and variable cost is the variable cost of serving such 
a meal, such as the cost of the lobster, employee 
wages, and so on. In this example, however, it is the 
average variable cost curve rather than the market 
price that shifts over time, due to seasonal changes in 
the cost of lobsters. Maine lobster shacks have rela-
tively low average variable cost during the summer, 
when cheap Maine lobsters are available. During the 
rest of the year, their average variable cost is rela-
tively high due to the high cost of imported lobsters. 
So the lobster shacks are open for business during the 
summer, when their minimum average variable cost 
lies below price. But they close during the rest of the 
year, when price lies below their minimum average 
variable cost.

 1. a.  A fall in the fixed cost of production generates a fall in 
the average total cost of production and, in the short 
run, an increase in each firm’s profit at the current 
output level. So in the long run new firms will enter 
the industry. The increase in supply drives down price 
and profits. Once profits are driven back to zero, entry 
will cease.
  b.  An increase in wages generates an increase in the aver-
age variable and the average total cost of production at 
every output level. In the short run, firms incur losses 
at the current output level, and so in the long run some 
firms will exit the industry. (If the average variable cost 
rises sufficiently, some firms may even shut down in 
the short run.) As firms exit, supply decreases, price 
rises, and losses are reduced. Exit will cease once losses 
return to zero.
  c.  Price will rise as a result of the increased demand, 
leading to a short-run increase in profits at the current 
output level. In the long run, firms will enter the indus-
try, generating an increase in supply, a fall in price, and 
a fall in profits. Once profits are driven back to zero, 
entry will cease.
  d.  The shortage of a key input causes that input’s price 
to increase, resulting in an increase in average vari-
able and average total costs for producers. Firms incur 
losses in the short run, and some firms will exit the 
industry in the long run. The fall in supply generates 
an increase in price and decreased losses. Exit will 
cease when losses have returned to zero.

 2. a.  Extending the length of a patent increases the length of 
time during which the inventor can reduce the quan-

es the incentive to invent new products.
  b.  Extending the length of a patent also increases the period 
of time during which consumers have to pay higher prices. 
So determining the appropriate length of a patent involves 
making a trade-off between the desirable incentive for 
invention and the undesirable high price to consumers.

 1. a.  The price at each output level is found by dividing the 
total revenue by the number of emeralds produced; 
for example, the price when 3 emeralds are produced 
is $252/3 = $84. The price at the various output levels 
is then used to construct the demand schedule in the 
accompanying table.
  b.  The marginal revenue schedule is found by calculating 
the change in total revenue as output increases by one 
unit. For example, the marginal revenue generated 
by increasing output from 2 to 3 emeralds is ($252 − 
$186) = $66.
 2.   In the above diagram, point XMKT in panel (b), the 
intersection of S1 and D1, represents the long-run 
industry equilibrium before the change in consumer 
tastes. When tastes change, demand falls and the 
industry moves in the short run to point YMKT in panel 
(b), at the intersection of the new demand curve D2 
and S1, the short - run supply curve representing the 
same number of egg producers as in the original equi-
librium at point XMKT. As the market price falls, an 
individual firm reacts by producing less—as shown in 
panel (a)—as long as the market price remains above 
the minimum average variable cost. If market price 
falls below minimum average variable cost, the firm 
would shut down immediately. At point YMKT the price 
of eggs is below minimum average total cost, creating 
losses for producers. This leads some firms to exit, 
which shifts the short - run industry supply curve left-
ward to S2. A new long - run equilibrium is established 
at point ZMKT. As this occurs, the market price rises 
again, and, as shown in panel (c), each remaining pro-
ducer reacts by increasing output (here, from point Y 
to point Z). All remaining producers again make zero 
profits. The decrease in the quantity of eggs supplied 
in the industry comes entirely from the exit of some 
producers from the industry. The long - run industry 
supply curve is the curve labeled LRS in panel (b).

Otherwise, it should do  nothing.
  b.  The government should approve the merger only if it 
fosters competition by transferring some of the com-

 2. a.  False. As can be seen from Figure 13-8, panel (b), the 
inefficiency arises from the fact that some of the con-
sumer surplus is transformed into deadweight loss 
(the yellow area), not that it is transformed into profit 
(the green area). 
  b.  True. If a monopolist sold to all customers who have 
a valuation greater than or equal to marginal cost, all 
mutually beneficial transactions would occur and there 
would be no deadweight loss.
 3.   As shown in the accompanying diagram, a profit–
maximizing monopolist produces QM, the output 
level at which MR = MC. A monopolist who mistak-
enly believes that P = MR produces the output level at 
which P = MC (when, in fact, P > MR, and at the true 
profit - maximizing level of output, P > MR = MC). This 
misguided monopolist will produce the output level 
QC, where the demand curve crosses the marginal cost 
curve—the same output level produced if the industry 
were perfectly competitive. It will charge the price PC, 
which is equal to marginal cost, and make zero profit. 
The entire shaded area is equal to the consumer sur-
plus, which is also equal to total surplus in this case 
(since the monopolist receives zero producer surplus). 
There is no deadweight loss since every consumer who

 1. a.  False. A price - discriminating monopolist will sell to 
some customers that a single - price monopolist will 
refuse to—namely, customers with a high price elastic-
ity of demand who are willing to pay only a relatively 
low price for  the good.
  b.  False. Although a price - discriminating monopolist does 
indeed capture more of the consumer surplus, ineffi-
ciency is lower: more mutually beneficial transactions 
occur because the monopolist makes more sales to cus-
tomers with a low willingness to pay for  the good.
  c.  The quantity effect component of marginal revenue is 
the additional revenue generated by selling one more 
unit of the good at the market price. For example, as 
shown in the accompanying table, at 3 emeralds, the 
market price is $84; so when going from 2 to 3 emer-
alds, the quantity effect is equal  to $84.
  d.  The price effect component of marginal revenue is the 
decline in total revenue caused by the fall in price when 
one more unit is sold. For example, as shown in the 
table, when only 2 emeralds are sold, each emerald sells 
at a price of $93. However, when Emerald, Inc. sells an 
additional emerald, the price must fall by $9 to $84. So 
the price effect component in going from 2 to 3 emer-
alds is (−$9) × 2 = −$18. That’s because 2 emeralds can 
only be sold at a price of $84 when 3 emeralds in total 
are sold, although they could have been sold at a price 
of $93 when only 2 in total were sold.

 1.   When Margaret builds a missile, Nikita’s payoff from 
building a missile as well is −10; it is −20 if he does not. 
The same set of payoffs holds for Margaret when Nikita 
builds a missile: her payoff is −10 if she builds one as 
well, −20 if she does not. So it is a Nash (or noncoopera-
tive) equilibrium for both Margaret and Nikita to build 
missiles, and their total payoff is (−10) + (−10) = −20. But 
their total payoff is greatest when neither builds a mis-
sile: their total payoff is 0 + 0 = 0. But this outcome—the 
cooperative outcome—is unlikely. If Margaret builds a 
missile but Nikita does not, Margaret gets a payoff of 
+8, rather than the 0 she gets if she doesn’t build a mis-
sile. So Margaret is better off if she builds a missile but 
Nikita doesn’t. Similarly, Nikita is better off if he builds 
a missile but Margaret doesn’t: he gets a payoff of +8, 
rather than the 0 he gets if he doesn’t build a missile. So 
both players have an incentive to build a missile. Both 
will build a missile, and each gets a payoff of −10. So 
unless Nikita and Margaret are able to communicate in 
some way to enforce cooperation, they will act in their 
own individual interests and each will build a  missile.
 2. a.  Future entry by several new firms will increase competi-
tion and drive down industry profits. As a result, there 
is less future profit to protect by behaving cooperatively 
today. So each oligopolist is more likely to behave non-
cooperatively today.
  b.  When it is very difficult for a firm to detect if another 
firm has raised output, then it is very difficult to 
enforce cooperation by playing tit   for   tat. So it is more 
likely that a firm will behave non cooperatively.
  c.  When firms have co existed while maintaining high pric-
es for a long time, each expects cooperation to continue. 
So the value of behaving cooperatively today is high, 
and it is likely that firms will engage in tacit collusion.

 1. a.  This is likely to be interpreted as evidence of tacit col-
lusion. Firms in the industry are able to tacitly collude 
by setting their prices according to the published “sug-
gested” price of the largest firm in the industry. This is 
a form of price leadership.
  b.  This is not likely to be interpreted as evidence of tacit 
collusion. Considerable variation in market shares indi-
cates that firms have been competing to capture one 
anothers’  business.
  c.  This is not likely to be interpreted as evidence of tacit 
collusion. These features make it more unlikely that 
consumers will switch products in response to lower 
prices. So this is a way for firms to avoid any tempta-
tion to gain market share by lowering price. This is a 
form of product differentiation used to avoid direct 
competition.
  c.  True. Under price discrimination consumers are 
charged prices that depend on their price elasticity 
of demand. A consumer with highly elastic demand 
will pay a lower price than a consumer with inelastic 
demand.
 2. a.  This is not a case of price discrimination because all 
consumers, regardless of their price elasticities of 
demand, value the damaged merchandise less than 
undamaged merchandise. So the price must be lowered 
to sell the merchandise.
  b.  This is a case of price discrimination. Senior citizens 
have a higher price elasticity of demand for restau-
rant meals (their demand for restaurant meals is 
more responsive to price changes) than other patrons. 
Restaurants lower the price to high-elasticity consumers 
(senior citizens). Consumers with low price elasticity of 
demand will pay the full price.
  c.  This is a case of price discrimination. Consumers with a 
high price elasticity of demand will pay a lower price by 
collecting and using discount coupons. Consumers with 
a low price elasticity of demand will not use  coupons.
  d.  This is not a case of price discrimination; it is simply a

 1. a.  The firm is likely to act non cooperatively and raise 
output, which will generate a negative price effect. But 
because the firm’s current market share is small, the 
negative price effect will fall much more heavily on its 
rivals’ revenues than on its own. At the same time, the 
firm will benefit from a positive quantity effect. 
  b.  The firm is likely to act non cooperatively and raise 
output, which will generate a fall in price. Because its 
rivals have higher costs, they will lose money at the 
lower price while the firm continues to make profits. So 
the firm may be able to drive its rivals out of business 
by increasing its  output.
  c.  The firm is likely to collude. Because it is costly for con-
sumers to switch products, the firm would have to lower 
its price quite substantially (by increasing quantity a 
lot) to induce consumers to switch to its product. So

  b.  A decrease in marginal cost lowers average total cost and 
shifts the average total cost curve and the marginal cost 
curve downward. Because existing firms now make prof-
its, in the long run new entrants are attracted into the 
industry. In the long run, this results in a leftward shift 
of each existing firm’s demand curve since each firm 
now has a smaller share of the market. Long - run equi-
librium is re established when each firm’s demand curve 
has shifted leftward to the point where it is tangent to 
the new, lower average total cost curve. At this point each 
firm’s price just equals average total cost, and each firm 
makes zero  profit.
 2.   If all the existing firms in the industry joined together 
to create a monopoly, they would achieve monopoly 
profits. But this would induce new firms to create new, 
differentiated products and then enter the industry and 
capture some of the monopoly profits. So in the long 
run it would be impossible to maintain a monopoly. The 
problem arises from the fact that because new firms 
can create new products, there is no barrier to entry 
that can maintain a monopoly.

 1. a.  False. As can be seen from panel (b) of Figure 15-4, a 
monopolistically competitive firm produces at a point 
where price exceeds marginal cost—unlike a perfectly 
competitive firm, which produces where price equals 
marginal cost (at the point of minimum average total 
cost). A monopolistically competitive firm will refuse to 
sell at marginal cost. This would be below average total 
cost and the firm would incur  a loss.
  b.  True. Firms in a monopolistically competitive industry 
could achieve higher profits (monopoly profits) if they 
all joined together and produced a single product. In 
addition, since the industry possesses excess capacity, 
producing a larger quantity of output would lower the 
firm’s average total cost. The effect on consumers, how-
ever, is ambiguous. They would experience less choice. 
But if consolidation substantially reduces industry - wide 
average total cost and therefore substantially increases 
industry - wide output, consumers may experience lower 
prices under monopoly.

 1. a.  Ladders are not differentiated as a result of monopo-
listic competition. A ladder producer makes different 
ladders (tall ladders versus short ladders) to satisfy dif-

ers will be indistinguishable by consumers. 
  b.  Soft drinks are an example of product differentiation 
as a result of monopolistic competition. For example, 
several producers make cola s; each is differentiated in 
terms of taste, which fast - food chains sell  it, and so on.
  c.  Department stores are an example of product differenti-

  d.  Steel is not differentiated as a result of monopolistic 
competition. Different types of steel (beams versus

competitive industries both have many sellers. So it may 
be hard to distinguish between them solely in terms of

run. But in a perfectly competitive industry, one stan-
dardized product is sold; in a monopolistically competi-

ask whether products are differentiated in the industry.

 1.   This is a misguided argument. Allowing polluters to sell 
emissions permits makes polluters face a cost of pol-
luting: the opportunity cost of the permit. If a polluter 
chooses not to reduce its emissions, it cannot sell its 
emissions permits. As a result, it forgoes the opportu-
nity of making money from the sale of the permits. So 
despite the fact that the polluter receives a monetary 
benefit from selling the permits, the scheme has the 
desired effect: to make polluters internalize the exter-
nality of their  actions.
 2. a.  If the emissions tax is smaller than the marginal social 
cost at QOPT, a polluter will face a marginal cost of pol-
luting (equal to the amount of the tax) that is less than 
the marginal social cost at the socially optimal quantity 
of pollution. Since a polluter will produce emissions up 
to the point where the marginal social benefit is equal 
to its marginal cost, the resulting amount of pollution 
will be larger than the socially optimal quantity. As a 
result, there is inefficiency: if the amount of pollution is 
larger than the socially optimal quantity, the marginal 
social cost exceeds the marginal social benefit, and soci-
ety could gain from a reduction in emissions levels. 
  
  If the emissions tax is greater than the marginal 
social cost at QOPT, a polluter will face a marginal 
cost of polluting (equal to the amount of the tax) that 
is greater than the marginal social cost at the socially 
optimal quantity of pollution. This will lead the polluter 
to reduce emissions below the socially optimal quantity. 
This also is inefficient: whenever the marginal social 
benefit is greater than the marginal social cost, society 
could benefit from an increase in emissions  levels.
  b.  If the total amount of allowable pollution is set too high, 
the supply of emissions permits will be high and so the 
equilibrium price at which permits trade will be low. 
That is, polluters will face a marginal cost of polluting 
(the price of a permit) that is “too low”—lower than the 
marginal social cost at the socially optimal quantity of 
pollution. As a result, pollution will be greater than the 
socially optimal quantity. This is inefficient. 
  
  
If the total level of allowable pollution is set too low, 
the supply of emissions permits will be low and so the

 2. a.  Planting trees imposes an external benefit: the mar-

many people (not just those who plant the trees) can

orange juice versus a rival’s product. The two are likely 
to be indistinguishable by consumers.
  e.   This is economically useful because the longevity of a

 2.   A successful brand name indicates a desirable attri-
bute, such as quality, to a potential buyer. So, other 
things equal—such as price—a firm with a successful

name. This is likely to deter new firms from entering 
an industry in which an existing firm has a successful

 1. a.  The external cost is the pollution caused by the waste -
water runoff, an uncompensated cost imposed by the 
poultry farms on their neighbors.
  b.  Since poultry farmers do not take the external cost 
of their actions into account when making decisions 
about how much waste water to generate, they will 
create more runoff than is socially optimal in the 
absence of government intervention or a private deal. 
They will produce runoff up to the point at which the 
marginal social benefit of an additional unit of runoff 
is zero; however, their neighbors experience a high, 
positive level of marginal social cost of runoff from 
this output level. So the quantity of wastewater run-
off is inefficient: reducing runoff by one unit would 
reduce total social benefit by less than it would reduce 
total social cost.
  c.  At the socially optimal quantity of waste water 
runoff, the marginal social benefit is equal to the 
marginal social cost. This quantity is lower than the 
quantity of wastewater runoff that would be created 
in the absence of government intervention or a pri-
vate deal.
 2.   Yasmin’s reasoning is not correct: allowing some 
late returns of books is likely to be socially optimal. 
Although you impose a marginal social cost on others 
every day that you are late in returning a book, there is 
some positive marginal social benefit to you of return-
ing a book late—for example, you get a longer period to 
use it in working on a term paper. 
  
  The socially optimal number of days that a book 
is returned late is the number at which the marginal 
social benefit equals the marginal social cost. A 
fine so stiff that it prevents any late returns is likely 
to result in a situation in which people return books 
although the marginal social benefit of keeping 
them another day is greater than the marginal 
social cost—an inefficient outcome. In that case, 
allowing an overdue patron another day would 
increase total social benefit more than it would 
increase total social cost. So charging a moderate 
fine that reduces the number of days that books are 
returned late to the socially optimal number of days 
is appropriate.

In this case the public park is a public good. But use

  b.  Water - saving toilets impose an external benefit: the 
marginal benefit to individual homeowners from replac-
ing a traditional toilet with a water - saving toilet is zero, 
since water is virtually costless. But the marginal social 
benefit is large, since fewer rivers and aquifers need to 
be pumped. The difference between the marginal social

owners is the marginal external benefit. A Pigouvian 
subsidy on installing water - saving toilets could bring 
the marginal benefit to individual homeowners in line 
with the marginal social  benefit.
  c.  Disposing of old computer monitors imposes an external 
cost: the marginal cost to those disposing of old com-

ence between the marginal social cost and the marginal 
cost to those disposing of old computer monitors is the

computer monitors, or a system of tradable permits for 
their disposal, could raise the marginal cost to those dis-
posing of old computer monitors sufficiently to make it

the voltage of the electrical outlet it is plugged into. 
Consumers will want to have 110-volt appliances when 
houses are wired for 110-volt outlets, and builders will 
want to install 110-volt outlets when most prospective 
homeowners use 110-volt appliances. So a network 
externality arises because a consumer will want to use 
appliances that operate with the same voltage as the 
appliances used by most other consumers.
  b.  Printers, copy machines, fax machines, and so on are 
designed for specific paper sizes. Consumers will want 
to purchase paper of a size that can be used in these 
machines, and machine manufacturers will want to 
manufacture their machines for the size of paper that 
most consumers use. So a network externality arises 
because a consumer will want to use the size of paper 
used by most other consumers—namely, 81⁄2-by - 11-inch 
paper rather than 8-by - 121⁄2-inch paper.
 2.   Of the two competing companies, the company able

 1.   When individuals are allowed to harvest freely, the 
government-owned forest becomes a common resource, 
and individuals will overuse it—they will harvest more 
trees than is efficient. In economic terms, the marginal 
social cost of harvesting a tree is greater than a private 
logger’s individual marginal cost. 
 2.   The three methods consistent with economic theory are 
(i) Pigouvian taxes, (ii) a system of tradable licenses, and 
(iii) allocation of property rights. 
  i.  Pigouvian taxes. You would enforce a tax on loggers 
that equals the difference between the marginal 
social cost and the individual marginal cost of log-
ging a tree at the socially efficient harvest amount. 
In order to do this, you must know the marginal 
social cost schedule and the individual marginal cost 
schedule.
  ii.  System of tradable licenses. You would issue tradable 
licenses, setting the total number of trees harvested 
equal to the socially efficient harvest number. The 
market that arises in these licenses will allocate 
the right to log efficiently when loggers differ in 
their costs of logging: licenses will be purchased 
by those who have a relatively lower cost of log-
ging. The market price of a license will be equal to 
the difference between the marginal social cost and 
the individual marginal cost of logging a tree at the 
socially efficient harvest amount. In order to imple-
ment this level, you need to know the socially effi-
cient harvest  amount.
  iii.  Allocation of property rights. Here you would sell

have the right to exclude others from harvesting 
trees. Harvesting is now a private good—it is exclud-
able and rival in consumption. As a result, there is 
no longer any divergence between social and private 
costs, and the private party will harvest the efficient 
level of trees. You need no additional information to

  The efficient spending level is now $3, the highest level 
for which the marginal social benefit is greater than the 
marginal cost ($1). The efficient level of spending has 
increased from that in part a because with relatively 
more Revelers than Homebodies, an additional dol-
lar spent on the party generates a higher level of social 
benefit compared to when there are relatively more 
Homebodies than Revelers. 
  c.  When the numbers of Homebodies and Revelers are 
unknown but residents are asked their preferences, 
Homebodies will pretend to be Revelers to induce a 
higher level of spending on the public party. That’s 
because a Homebody still receives a positive individual 
marginal benefit from an additional $1 spent, despite 
the fact that his or her individual marginal benefit is 
lower than that of a Reveler for every additional $1. In 
this case the “reported” marginal social benefit sched-
ule of money spent on the party will be as shown in the 
accompanying table.

  As a result, $4 will be spent on the party, the highest 
level for which the “reported” marginal social benefit 
is greater than the marginal cost ($1). Regardless of 
whether there are 10 Homebodies and 6 Revelers 
(part a) or 6 Homebodies and 10 Revelers (part b), 
spending $4 in total on the party is clearly inefficient 
because marginal cost exceeds marginal social benefit 
at this spending level.
  
  
As a further exercise, consider how much Homebodies 
gain by this misrepresentation. In part a, the efficient 
level of spending is $2. So by misrepresenting their pref-
erences, the 10 Homebodies gain, in total, 10 × ($0.03 + 
$0.02) = $0.50—that is, they gain the marginal individual 
benefit in going from a spending level of $2 to $4. The 
6 Revelers also gain from the misrepresentations of the 
Homebodies; they gain 6 × ($0.09 + $0.07) = $0.96 in 
total. This outcome is clearly inefficient—when $4 in 
total is spent, the marginal cost is $1 but the marginal

  The median income is the income of the individual in 
the exact middle of the income distribution: Oskar, with 
an income of $28,000. So the median income is $28,000.
Median income is more representative of the income 
of individuals in this economy: almost everyone earns 
income between $15,000 and $39,000, close to the 
median income of $28,000. Only Raul is the exception: it 
is his income that raises the mean income to $199,900, 
which is not representative of most incomes in this 
economy.
  b.  The first quintile is made up of the 20% (or one - fifth)

Vijay makes up the 20% of individuals with the lowest

income of the first quintile. Oskar makes up the 20% 
of individuals with the third - lowest incomes. His 
income is $28,000, so that is the average income of 
the third quintile.
 4.  As the Economics in Action pointed out, much of the 
rise in inequality reflects growing differences among 
highly educated workers. That is, workers with similar 
levels of education earn very dissimilar incomes. As a 
result, the principal source of rising inequality in the 
United States today is reflected by statement b: the rise 
in the bank CEO’s salary relative to that of the branch

 1.   The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a negative 
income tax, applies only to those workers who earn 
income; over a certain range of incomes, the more a 
worker earns, the higher the amount of EITC received. 
A person who earns no income receives no income tax 
credit. By contrast, poverty programs that pay indi-
viduals based solely on low income still make those 
payments even if the individual does not work at all; 
once the individual earns a certain amount of income, 
these programs discontinue payments. As a result, such 
programs contain an incentive not to work and earn 
income, since earning more than a certain amount 
makes individuals ineligible for their benefits. The nega-
tive income tax, however, provides an incentive to work 
and earn income because its payments increase the 
more an individual works.
 2.   According to the data in Table 18-4, the U.S. welfare 
state reduces the poverty rate for every age group. It 
does so particularly dramatically for those aged 65 and

 1. a.  A pension guarantee program is a social insurance 
program. The possibility of an employer declaring bank-
ruptcy and defaulting on its obligation to pay employee 
pensions creates insecurity. By providing pension 
income to those employees, such a program alleviates 
this source of economic insecurity.
  b.  The SCHIP program is a poverty program. By providing 
health care to children in low - income households, it tar-
gets its spending specifically to the poor.
  c.  The Section 8 housing program is a poverty program. 
By targeting its support to low - income households, it 
specifically helps the poor.
  d. The federal flood program is a social insurance pro-
gram. For many people, the majority of their wealth is 
tied up in the home they own. The potential for a loss of 
that wealth creates economic insecurity. By providing 
assistance to those hit by a major flood, the program 
alleviates this source of insecurity.
 2.  The poverty threshold is an absolute measure of 
poverty. It defines individuals as poor if their incomes 
fall below a level that is considered adequate to pur-
chase the necessities of life, irrespective of how well 
other people are doing. And that measure is fixed: in 
2010, for instance, it took $11,139 for an individual 
living alone to purchase the necessities of life, regard-
less of how well- off other Americans were. In par-
ticular, the poverty threshold is not adjusted for an 
increase in living standards: even if other Americans 
are becoming increasingly well - off over time, in real 
terms (that is, how many goods an individual at the 
poverty threshold can buy) the poverty threshold 
remains the same.
 3. a.  To determine mean (or average) income, we take the 
total income of all individuals in this economy and 
divide it by the number of individuals. Mean income is

$999,500/5 = $199,900. To determine median income, 
look at the accompanying table, which lines up the five 
individuals in order of their income.

 1.   Many college professors will depart for other lines of 
work if the government imposes a wage that is lower 
than the market wage. Fewer professors will result in 
fewer courses taught and therefore fewer college degrees 
produced. It will adversely affect sectors of the economy 
that depend directly on colleges, such as the local shop-
keepers who sell goods and services to students and fac-
ulty, college textbook publishers, and so on. It will also 
adversely affect firms that use the “output” produced by 
colleges: new college graduates. Firms that need to hire 
new employees with college degrees will be hurt as a 
smaller supply results in a higher market wage for col-
lege graduates. Ultimately, the reduced supply of college -
educated workers will result in a lower level of human 
capital in the entire economy relative to what it would 
have been without the policy. And this will hurt all sec-
tors of the economy that depend on human capital. The 
sectors of the economy that might benefit are firms 
that compete with colleges in the hiring of would - be 
college professors. For example, accounting firms will 
find it easier to hire people who would otherwise have 
been professors of accounting, and publishers will find 
it easier to hire people who would otherwise have been 
professors of English (easier in the sense that the firms 
can recruit would - be professors with a lower wage than 
before). In addition, workers who already have college 
degrees will benefit; they will command higher wages 
as the supply of college - educated workers falls.

 1. a.  As the demand for services increases, the price of ser-
vices will rise. And as the price of the output produced 
by the industries increases, this shifts the VMPL curve 
upward—that is, the demand for labor rises. This results 
in an increase in both the equilibrium wage rate and the 
quantity of labor  employed.
  b.  The fall in the catch per day means that the marginal 
product of labor in the industry declines. The VMPL 
curve shifts downward, generating a fall in the equilib-
rium wage rate and the equilibrium quantity of labor 
employed.
 2.   When firms from different industries compete for the 
same workers, then each worker in the various indus-
tries will be paid the same equilibrium wage rate, 
W. And since, by the marginal productivity theory of 
income distribution, VMPL = P × MPL = W for the last 
worker hired in equilibrium, the last worker hired in 
each of these different industries will have the same 
value of the marginal  product of labor.

 1. a.  False. Income disparities associated with gender, race, 
or ethnicity can be explained by the marginal pro-
ductivity theory of income distribution provided that 
differences in marginal productivity across people are 
correlated with gender, race, or ethnicity. One possible 
source for such correlation is past discrimination. 
Such discrimination can lower individuals’ marginal 
a representative mix of healthy and less healthy 
people, rather than a selected group of people who 
want insurance because they expect to pay high 
medical bills. In that respect, this insurance is like 
employment - based health insurance. Because no stu-
dent can opt out, the school can offer health insur-
ance based on the health care costs of its average stu-
dent. If each student had to buy his or her own health 
insurance, some students would not be able to obtain 
any insurance and many would pay more than they 
do to the school’s insurance program.
  b.  Since all students are required to enroll in its health 
insurance program, even the healthiest students 
cannot leave the program in an effort to obtain 
cheaper insurance tailored specifically to healthy 
people. If this were to happen, the school’s insur-
ance program would be left with an adverse selection 
of less   healthy students and so would have to raise 
premiums, beginning the adverse selection death 
spiral. But since no student can leave the insurance 
program, the school’s program can continue to base 
its premiums on the average student’s probability of 
requiring health care, avoiding the adverse selection 
death spiral.
 2.   According to critics, part of the reason the U.S. health 
care system is so much more expensive than those of 
other countries is its fragmented nature. Since each of 
the many insurance companies has significant adminis-
trative (overhead) costs—in part because each insurance 
company incurs marketing costs and exerts significant 
effort in weeding out high - risk insureds—the system 
tends to be more expensive than one in which there is 
only a single medical insurer. Another part of the expla-
nation is that U.S. medical care includes many more 
expensive treatments than found in other wealthy coun-
tries, pays higher physician salaries, and has higher 
drug prices.

 1. a. Recall one of the principles from Chapter 1: one 
person’s spending is another person’s income. A 
high sales tax on consumer items is the same as a 
high marginal tax rate on income. As a result, the 
incentive to earn income by working or by investing 
in risky projects is reduced, since the payoff, after 
taxes, is lower.
  b.  If you lose a housing subsidy as soon as your income 
rises above $25,000, your incentive to earn more 
than $25,000 is reduced. If you earn exactly $25,000, 
you obtain the housing subsidy; however, as soon as 
you earn $25,001, you lose the entire subsidy, making 
you worse off than if you had not earned the addi-
tional dollar. The complete withdrawal of the hous-
ing subsidy as income rises above $25,000 is what 
economists refer to as a notch.
 2.  Over the past 40 years, polarization in Congress has

are “unfair” in that the expected claim is less than the 
premium. The degree to which a family is willing to pay 
more than an expected claim for insurance depends on 
the family’s degree of risk aversion.
 2. a.  Karma’s expected income is the weighted average of all 
possible values of her income, weighted by the prob-
abilities with which she earns each possible value of her 
income. Since she makes $22,000 with a probability of 
0.6 and $35,000 with a probability of 0.4, her expected 
income is (0.6 × $22,000) + (0.4 × $35,000) = $13,200 + 
$14,000 = $27,200. Her expected utility is simply the 
expected value of the total utilities she will experience. 
Since with a probability of 0.6 she will experience a 
total utility of 850 utils (the utility to her from making 
$22,000), and with a probability of 0.4 she will experi-
ence a total utility of 1,260 utils (the utility to her from 
making $35,000), her expected utility is (0.6 × 850 utils) + 
(0.4 × 1,260 utils) = 510 utils + 504 utils = 1,014 utils.
  b.  If Karma makes $25,000 for certain, she experiences a 
utility level of 1,014 utils. From the answer to part a, we 
know that this leaves her equally as well off as when she 
has a risky expected income of $27,200. Since Karma is 
indifferent between a risky expected income of $27,200 
and a certain income of $25,000, you can conclude that 
she would prefer a certain income of $27,200 to a risky 
expected income of $27,200. That is, she would defi-
nitely be willing to reduce the risk she faces when this 
reduction in risk leaves her expected income unchanged. 
In other words, Karma is risk- averse.
  c.  Yes. Karma experiences a utility level of 1,056 utils 
when she has a certain income of $26,000. This is high-
er than the expected utility level of 1,014 utils generated 
by a risky expected income of $27,200. So Karma is 
willing to pay a premium to guarantee a certain income 
of $26,000.

 1. a.  An increase in the number of ships implies an increase 
in the quantity of insurance demanded at any given 
premium. This is a rightward shift of the demand curve, 
resulting in a rise in both the equilibrium premium and 
the equilibrium quantity of insurance bought  and sold.
  b.  An increase in the number of trading routes means that 
investors can diversify more. In other words, they can 
reduce risk further. At any given premium, there are 
now more investors willing to supply insurance. This 
is a rightward shift of the supply curve for insurance, 
leading to a fall in the equilibrium premium and a rise 
in the equilibrium quantity of insurance bought  and 
sold.
  c.  If shipowners in the market become even more risk - 
averse, they will be willing to pay even higher premiums 
for insurance. That is, at any given premium, there are 
now more people willing to buy insurance. This is a 
rightward shift of the demand curve for insurance, lead-
ing to a rise in both the equilibrium premium and the 
equilibrium quantity of insurance bought  and sold.
  d.  If investors in the market become more risk - averse, 
they will be less willing to accept risk at any given pre-
mium. This is a leftward shift of the supply curve for 
productivity by, for example, preventing them from 
acquiring the human capital that would raise their 
productivity. Another possible source of the correla-
tion is differences in work experience that are asso-
ciated with gender, race, or ethnicity. For example, 
in jobs where work experience or length of tenure is 
important, women may earn lower wages because on 
average more women than men take child - care-related 
absences from work.
  b.  True. Companies that discriminate when their competi-
tors do not are likely to hire less able workers because 
they discriminate against more able workers who are 
considered to be of the wrong gender, race, ethnicity, or 
other characteristic. And with less able workers, such 
companies are likely to earn lower profits than their 
competitors that don’t discriminate.
  c.  Ambiguous. In general, workers who are paid less 
because they have less experience may or may not be 
the victims of discrimination. The answer depends on 
the reason for the lack of experience. If workers have 
less experience because they are young or have chosen 
to do something else rather than gain experience, then 
they are not victims of discrimination if they are paid 
less. But if workers lack experience because previous job 
discrimination prevented them from gaining experience, 
then they are indeed victims of discrimination when 
they are paid less.

a fall in Clive’s income. The income effect of this is to 
induce Clive to consume less leisure and therefore 
work more hours, since he is now poorer and leisure is 
a normal good. If the income effect dominates the sub-
stitution effect, Clive will in the end work more hours

construction or allows costs to increase. The home-
owner cannot, or can only imperfectly, observe the 
cost - reduction effort of the contractor. If the con-
tractor were fully reimbursed for all costs incurred 
during construction, she would have no incentive 
to reduce costs. Making the contractor responsible 
for any additional costs above the original estimate 
means that she now has an incentive to keep costs 
low. However, this imposes risk on the contractor. For 
instance, if the weather is bad, home construction 
will take longer, and will be more costly, than if the 
weather had been good. Since the contractor pays for 
any additional costs (such as weather - induced delays) 
above the original estimate, she now faces risk that 
she cannot  control.
 3. a.  True. Drivers with higher deductibles have more incen-

  b.  True. Suppose you know that you are a safe driver. 
You have a choice of a policy with a high premium 
but a low deduct ible or one with a lower premium 
but a higher deductible. In this case, you would 
be more likely to choose the cheap policy with the 
high deductible because you know that you will be 
unlikely to have to pay the deductible. When there is 
adverse selection, insurance companies use screen-
ing devices such as this to make inferences about 
people’s private information about how skillful they 
are as  drivers.
  c.  True. The wealthier you are, the less risk - averse you are. 
If you are less risk - averse, you are more willing to bear 
risk yourself. Having an insurance policy with a high

have to pay more of any insurance claim yourself. This 
is an implication of how risk aversion changes with a

and a fall in the equilibrium quantity of insurance 
bought  and sold.
  e.  As the overall level of risk increases, those willing to buy 
insurance will be more willing to buy insurance at any 
given premium; the demand curve for insurance shifts 
to the right. But since overall risk cannot be diversified 
away, those ordinarily willing to take on risk will be less 
willing to do so, leading to a leftward shift in the supply 
curve for insurance. As a result, the equilibrium premium 
will rise; the effect on the equilibrium quantity of insur-
ance is uncertain.
  f.  If the wealth levels of investors fall, investors will 
become more risk-averse and so less willing to supply 
insurance at any given premium. This is a leftward shift 
of the supply curve for insurance, leading to a rise in

 1.   The inefficiency caused by adverse selection is that an 
insurance policy with a premium based on the average 
risk of all drivers will attract only an adverse selection 
of bad drivers. Good (that is, safe) drivers will find this 
insurance premium too expensive and so will remain 
uninsured. This is inefficient. However, safe drivers are 
also those drivers who have had fewer moving viola-
tions for several years. Lowering premiums for only 
those drivers allows the insurance company to screen 
its customers and sell insurance to safe drivers, too. 
This means that at least some of the good drivers now 
are also insured, which decreases the inefficiency that 
arises from adverse selection. In a way, having no mov-
ing violations for several years is building a reputation 
for being a safe  driver.
