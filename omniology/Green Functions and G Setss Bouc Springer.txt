Introduction 
The theory of Mackey functors has been developed during the last 25 years in a series 
of papers by various authors (J.a. Green [8], a. Dress [5], T. Yoshida [17], J. Th~venaz 
and P. Webb [13],[15],[14], G. Lewis [6]). It is an attempt to give a single framework 
for the different theories of representations of a finite group and its subgroups. 
The notion of Mackey functor for a group G can be essentially approached from 
three points of view: the first one ([8]), which I call "naive", relics on the poset 
of subgroups of G. The second one ([5],[17]) is more "categoric", and relies on the 
category of G-sets. The third one ([15]) is "algebraic", and defines Mackey functors 
as modules over the Mackey algebra. 
Each of these points of view induces its own natural definitions, and the reason 
why this subject is so rich is probably the possibility of translation between them. 
For instance, the notion of minimal subgroup for a Mackey functor comes from the 
first definition, the notion of induction of Mackey functors is quite natural with the 
second, and the notion of projective Mackey functor is closely related to the third 
one. 
The various rings of representations of a group (linear, pernmtation, p-permuta- 
tion...), and cohomology rings, are important examples of Mackey functors, having 
moreover a product (tensor product or cup product). This situation has been axiom- 
atized, and those functors have been generally called C-functors in the literature, or 
Green functors. 
This definition of a Green functor tora group G is a complement to the "naive" 
definition of a Mackey fnnctor: to each subgroup of G corresponds a ring, and the vari- 
ous rings are connected by operations of transfer and restriction, which are compatible 
with the product through Frobenius relations. 
The object of this work is to give a definition of Green functors in terms of G- 
sets, and to study various questions raised by this new definition. From that point 
of view, a Green fimctor is a generalized ring, in the sense that the theory of Green 
functors for the trivial group is the theory of ordinary rings. Now ring theory gives a 
series of directions for possible generalizations, and I will treat some cases here (tensor 
product, bimodnles, Morita theory, commutants, simple modules, centres). 
The first chapter deals only with Mackey functors: my purpose was not to give a 
full exposition of the theory, and I just recall the possible equivalent definitions, as 
one can find for instance in the article of Thevenaz and Webb ([15]). 
I show next 
how to build Mackey functors "with values in the Mackey functors", leading to the 
functors 7-{(M, N) and M@N, which will be an essential tool: they are analogous 
to the homomorphisms modules and tensor products for ordinary modules. Those 
constructions already appear in Sasaki ([12]) and Lewis ([6]). Thc notion of r~dinear 
map can be generalized in the form of r~-linear morphism of Mackey functors. The 

2 
INTROD UCTION 
reader may find that this part is a bit long: this is because I have tried here to give 
complete proofs, and as the subject is rather technical, this requires many details. 
Chapter 2 is devoted to the definition of Green functors in terms of G-sets, and to 
the proof of the equivalence between this definition and the classical one. It is then 
possible to define a module over a Green functor in terms of (-;-sets. I treat next the 
fundamental case of the Bm-nside functor, which plays for Green functors the role of 
the ring Z of integers. 
In chapter 3, I build a category CA associated to a Green functor ,4, and show that 
the category of A-modules is equivalent to the category of representations of CA. This 
category is a generalization of a construction of Lindner ([9]) for Mackey functors, and 
of the category of permutation modules studied by Yoshida ([17]) for cohomological 
Mackey functors. 
Chapter 4 describes the algebra associated to a Green functor: this algebra enters 
the scene if one looks %r G-sets ~ suct~ that the evaluation functor at ft is an equiva- 
lence of categories between the category of representations of Cn and the category of 
Endc~(f~)-modules. This algebra generalizes the Mackev algebra defined by Theve- 
naz and Webb ([1.5]) and the Hecke algebra, of Yoshida ([17]). It is possible to give a 
definition of this algebra by generators and relations. 
This algebra depends on the set f/, but only up to Morita equivalence. Chapter 5 
is devoted to the relation between those Morita equivalences and the classical notion 
of relative projectivity of a Green functor with respect to a G-set (see for instance 
the article of Webb [16]). More generaliy, I will deduce some progenerators for the 
category of A-modules. 
Chapter 6 introduces some tools giving new Green functors from known ones: after 
a neat description of the Green functors ~(/11,/1I), I define the opposite functor of 
a Green flmctor, which leads to the notion of right module over a Green functor. A 
natural example is the dual of a left module. The notion of tensor product of Green 
functors leads naturally to the definition of bimodule, and the notion of comnmtant 
to a definition of the Mackey functors 7t.4(M, N) and M(~,4N. 
Those constructions are the natural framework for Morita contexts, in chapter 7. 
The usual Morita theory can be generalized without difficulty to the case of Green 
functors for a given group G. 
The chapters S,9, and 10 examine the relations between Green functors and bisets: 
this notion provides a single framework for induction, restriction, inflation, and coin- 
flation of Mackey functors (see [2]). 
In chapter 8, I show how the composition with U, if U is a G-set-H, gives a 
Green functor A o U for the group H starting with a Green functor A for the group 
G. This construction passes down to the associated categories, so there is a corre- 
sponding functor from CAoU to Ca. This gives a functor between the categories of 
representations, which can also be obtained by composition with U. I study next 
the functoriality of these constructions with respect to U, and give the example of 
induction and restriction. 
Chapter 9 is devoted to the construction of the associated adjoint functors: I build 
a left and a right adjoint to the functors of composition with a biset /14 ~ 114 o U 
for Mackey fnnctors, and I give the classical examples of induction, restriction and 
inflation, and also the less well-known example of coinfiation. 
Chapter 10 is the most technical of this work: I show how the previous left adjoint 

INTROD UCTION 
3 
functors give rise to Green functors, and I study the associated functors and their 
adjoints between the corresponding categories of modules. An important consequence 
of this is the compatibility of left adjoints of composition with tensor products, which 
proves that if there is a surjective Morita context for two Green functors A and B 
for the group G, then there is one for all the residual rings A(H) and B(H), for any 
subgroup H of G. 
In chapter 11, I classify the simple modules over a Green functor, and describe 
their structure. Applying those results to the Green functor A@A ~ I obtain a new 
proof of the theorem of Th4venaz classifying the simple Green functors. Finally, I 
study how the simple modules (or similarly defined modules) behave with respect to 
the constructions ~(-,-) 
and -Q-. 
Chapter 12 gives two possible generalizations of the notion of centre of a ring, one 
in terms of commutants, the other in terms of natural transformations of functors. 
The first one gives a decomposition of any Green functor using the idempotents of 
the Burnside ring, and shows that up to (usual) Morita equivalence, it is possible to 
consider only the case of Green functors which are projective relative to certain sets 
of solvable rr-subgroups. The second one keeps track of the blocks of the associated 
algebras. Then I give the example of the fixed points functors, and recover the iso- 
morphism between the center of Yoshida algebra and the center of the group algebra. 
Next, the example of the Burnside ring leads to the natural bijection between the 
p-blocks of the group algebra and the blocks of the p-part of the Mackey algebra.

1.1 
Equivalent definitions 
Throughout this section, I denote by G a (finite) group and R a ring, that may be 
non-commutative. First I will recall briefly the three possible definitions of Mackey 
functors: the first one is due to Green ([8]), the second to Dress ([5]), and the third 
to Th6venaz and Webb ([15]). 
1.1.1 
Definition in terms of subgroups 
One of the possible definitions of Mackey functors is the following: 
A Mackey functor for the group G, with values in the category R-Mod of R-modules, 
consists of a collection of R-modules M(H), indexed by the subgroups H of G, to- 
ll 
M(H) --+ M(K) whenever Ir is a 
gerber with maps t H : M(K) --+ M(H) and r K : 
subgroup of H, and maps Cc,H : M(H) 
, M(~H) for x 6 G, such that: 
HK 
A'H 
9 If L C_ t( C_ H, then th-t L : t H and r L r K = r H. 
9 If x, y E G and H G G, then CyjHCx, H : Cyx, H. 
XH 
H 
= 
7,~H 
Moreover 
9 If x E G and H C_ G, then Cx,H tH = t.KCx, K and cx,icr K 
xKceG H. 
e~,H = Id if x E H. 
9 (Mackey axiom) If L C H _D K, then 
H H 
L 
K 
FL tA" 
E 
= 
~LnxKCx,LXAA-FLxnA. 
xEL\H/K 
H 
The maps tK 
H are called transfers or traces, and the maps r K are called restrictions. 
A morphism 6 from a Mackey functor M to a Mackey functor N consists of a 
collection of morphisms of R-modules OH : M(H) --+ N(H), for H C_ G, such that if

1.1.2 
Definition in terms of G-sets 
If K and H are subgroups of G, then the morphisms of G-sets from G/K to G/H are 
in one to one correspondence with the classes xH, where x E G is such that K ~ C H. 
This observation provides a way to extend a Mackey functor M to any G-set X, by 
choosing a system of representatives of orbits G\X, and defining 
M(X) = 
0 
M(G~) 
x6G\X 
There is a way to make this equality functori~l in X, and this leads to the following 
definition: 
Definition: Let R be a ring. If G is a (finite) group, let G-set be the category of 
finite sets with a left G action. A Mackey flmctor for the group G, with values in 
R-Mod, is a bifunctor from G-set to R-Mod, i.e. a couple of flmctors (M*, M.) , 
with M* contravariant and M. covariant, which coincide on objects (i.e. M*(X) = 
M.(X) = M(X) for any G-set X). 
This biflmctor is supposed to have the two 
following properties: 
9 (M1) If X and Y are G-sets, let ix and iv be the respective injections from X 
and Y into X [I Y, then the maps M*(ix) | M*(iv) and M.(ix) | M.(iv) are 
mutual inverse R-module isomorphisms between M ( X LI Y) and M ( X ) | M (Y).

A morphism 0 from the Mackey functor M to the Mackey functor N is a natural 
transformation of bifunctors, consisting of a morphism Ox : M(X) ~ N(X) for any 
G-set X, such that for any morphism of G-sets f : X --+ Y, the squares

are commutative. 
I will denote by MackR(G) or Mack(G) the category of Mackey functors for G over 
R. 
Conversely, if M is a Mackey functor in the sense of this second definition, then one 
can build a Mackey functor M, in the first sense by setting 
MI(H) 
= M(G/H) 
t H = M.(p~) 
r~ = ~vJ 
.... (pK)H' 
C~,H = M.(7~,H) 
where pH : G/K ~ G/H is the natural projection, and 7~,H : G/H ~ GffH is the 
map gH ~-* gx-I.~H = gHx -1 
1.1.3 
Definition as modules over the Mackey algebra 
There is a third definition of a Mackey fnnctor, using the Mackey algebra #n(G): 
consider first the algebra #(G) over Z: it is the algebra generated by the elements t~, 
H and cx,u, where H and K are subgroups of G such that K C H, and x 6 G, with 
r K  ~ 
the following relations:

A Mackey functor M for the first definition gives a module M for the "algebra" 
#R(G) = R | 
It(G) (which is not really an algebra if R is not commutative) defined 
by 
M = | 
M(H) 
HCG 
and a morphism f : M --~ N of Mackey functors gives a morphism of #n(G)-modules 
It it then possible to define a Mackey functor as a ItR(G)-module, and a morphism 
of Mackey functors as a morphism of Itn(G)-modules: if M is a #R(G)-module, then 
M corresponds to a Mackey functor Mi in the first sense, defined by MI(H) = t~M, 
H and C,.H being defined as the multiplications by the corresponding 
the maps t~, r K 
elements of the Mackey algebra.

CHAPTER 1. MACKEYFUNCTORS

The 
Mackey 
functors 
M ~ 
My 
If Y is a G-set, and M is a Mackey functor for G, then let My be the Mackey functor 
defined by 
My(X) = M(X • Y) 
and for a map of G-sets f : X --~ X', by 
(My)*(f) = M'(f • Id) 
(My).(f) = M~(f • Id) 
This construction is functorial in Y: if Y' is another G-set, and if g is a morphism of 
G-sets from Y to Y', then there is a morphism of Mackey functors Mg : My --~ My,, 
defined over the G-set X by 
M~,x = M,(Id • ~): My(X) --~ My,(• 
To see this, let f : X --* X' be a map of G-sets. Then the square 
Mg,x 
My(X) 
, 
My,(X) 
(Mv).(f) I 
I (Mz').(f)

Mv(X') 
Mg,x, 
Mz,(X') 
is commutative, since M,(f • Id) o M.(]d • g) =/14. (f • g) =/14. (Id • g) o M.(f x ]d). 
The square 
Mg,x 
My(X) 
, 
My,(X) 
(MY)*(f) I 
l (Mv')*(f) 
My (X') 
Mz,(X')

is also commutative, because the square 
Xxg

Idx 9 
is cartesian. 
There is also a morphism Mg from My, to Mz defined over X by 
M} = M*(Id • g): My,(• 
~ My(X) 
In other words, I have defined a bifunctor from G-set to the category MackR(G) 
of Mackey functors for G over R, which is equivalent to #R(G)-Mod. I will check 
the conditions (M1) and (M2) for this bifunctor, proving that Y ~ Mr is a Mackey 
functor with values in the category of Mackey functors. 

1.3. CONSTRUCTION OF H(M, N) AND M@N

For the condition (M1), let Y and Y' be G-sets, and i and i' be the respective injections 
from Y and Y' into Y II Y'. If X is a G-set, then

For the condition (M2), let

and so 
M~x o M~,x = M~,x o M} 
So I have defined a Mackey functor with values in the Mackey functors. 
If now A is a ring, and F is a functor from MackR(G) to A-Mod, then I will get 
a Mackey functor _F with values in A-Mod, defined for G-sets X and Y, and for a 
map f of G-sets from X to Y, by 
F(X) = F(Mx) 
F*(f) = F(MJx) 
F.(f) = F(Mj,x) 
1.3 
Construction 
of 7~(M,N) 
and 
M@N 
From now on, the ring R will be commutative. There are two important examples of 
the previous construction: in both cases, let ]14 and N be Mackey functors for G with 
values in R-Mod. For the first construction, I consider the functor 
F = HomM~ck(C)(N,-) 
and I can define the Mackey %nctor ~(N, M), with values in R-Mod, by the following 
formulae 
7-{(N, M)(X) = nomM~ck(a)(X, Mx) 

10 
CHAPTER i. MACKEY FUNCTORS 
"}-{(N, M)*(f) = HomMack(G)(N , MIx) 
7-{(N, M).(f) = HomMack(G)(N, MLx ) 
It is a kind of "internal homomorphisms" in the category of Mackey functors. 
For the second construction, I need to observe that the Mackey algebra admits a 
natural anti-automorphism rn ~ ~, defined by 
This allows to view any left #R(G)-module as a right #R(G)-module. Now being given 
a Mackey functor N, I can consider the functor 
F:MHM~,R(a) 
N 
The functor _P is then denoted by M@N: it is a Mackey functor with values in 
R-Mod, such that for any G-set X 
(M+N)(X) = M @,R(G) 
I will call it the tensor product of the Mackey functors M and N. 
1.4 
Identification of 7/(M,N) 
If H is a subgroup of G, then there is a restriction functor from Mack(G) to Mack(H), 
and an induction functor from Mack(H) to Mack(G), defined over a G-set X by 
(ResaM)(X) = M(Ind•X) 
(Ind~N)(Y) = N(ResgY) 
As functors between categories of Mackey functors, they are mutual left and right 
adjoints (see [14]). Moreover, the isomorphism of G-sets 
X x (G/H) ~_ Ind~Res~X 
gives the following isomorphism of Mackey functors 
Mc/H ~-- Ind~Res~M 
Those remarks prove that 
~(M, N)(H) = HomM~k(a)(M, Na/H) "~ HomM,~k(H)(ResaHM, aes~4N) 
I will translate the operations of transfer and restriction for 7-/(M, N) using the pre- 
vious identification. 
I must first state precisely the adjunction 
HomM~r 
Na/H) ~ Homu~ck(H)(ResaM, ResiN) 
i morphism r E Homu~k(H)(Res~i, ResiN) gives in particular for any subgroup 
K of G, a morphism r 
from M(K) to N(K). The adjunction now gives a morphism 
~* from M to Ind~ReSaH N defined on the subgroup L of G by the morphism ~ from 
i(t) to Ind, Res /(t) 
n 
given by 
* 
z 
L 
rr~ 
= 

1,4. IDENTIFICATION OF H(M, N) 
11 
Conversely, if r E HomM~k(a)(M, Ind~Res~N), then r gives morphisms 
r : M(L) ---* (~eH\a/LN(H (1 ~L) 
so I get a morphism from M(L) to N(H Cl ~L). 
The adjunction gives a morphism ~. from ResaM to ResiN: if K C_ H, the morphism 
r 
from M(K) to N(K) is the component on the double class H.1.K = H in the 
above map. 
Now if H D_ H' D_ K, and if m E M(K), I have 
K 
Restricting to NG/H,(K), I get 
H 
* 
t 
rH, d)K(m ) E (~yeH,\a/h-g(H N Yti) 
The component associated to y is obtained as follows: if x is the representative of 
H\G/K, then there exists h E H and/c E K such that y = hxk. The y component is 
HnYK 
K 
then equal to 
In particular, the component y = 1 comes fi'om the component x = 1, and the 
morphism from Res~,M to Res~,N associated to rH,r is defined by 
= 
= 
If now H C H' __D It', and if m E M(K), then (tH'r 
is an element of 
Na/H,(K) = | 
M ~K), and the component y = 1 comes from the dou- 
bles classes x E H\H'/K. The homomorphism from Resg, M to Resg, N associated 
to tH'r is then defined by 
H t 
x tHn~KCun~i~.XrH~nK(m ) 
xEH\H'/K 
that is 
H' 
= 
tH~nKX 
CHn~KxrH~nK(m) 
xEH\H'/K 
Finally, it is clear that if x E G, then the morphism xr from Resau M to ReSfHN is 
defined for K C_ ~H and m E M(K) by 
= 
The next proposition is a summary of the previous remarks: 
Proposition 1.4.1: Let M and N be Mackey functors for the group G. Then 
for any subgroup H of G, 
7-{(M, N)(H) ~_ HomM~ck(H)(Res~M, ResiN) 
An element r in 7-I(M,N)(H) is defined by a sequence of morphisms eL E 
Homn(M(L),N(L)), for L C H. Then:

1.5 
Identification of M@N 
Let M and N be Mackey functors for G. 
a) The definition of M@N shows that 
M@N(H) = M | 
NG/H 
But NC/H ~-- Ind/~ResTzN, and the restriction functor from MackR(G) to Mackn(H) 
comes from the natural morphism i,~ from the algebra #R(H) to #R(G). In other 
words, if M is a Mackey functor for G, then 
Res~M = i/~(l,Mg))./h r 
The induction functor from MackR(H) to Mackn(G) is left adjoint to it. Then for 
any Maekey functor L for H, I ha.re 
Ind~L = #R(G) |

This proves that 
M@N(H) = /~ |

since i~(1,,(H)) is invariant under the antiautomorphism of #n(G). 
b) I also claim that

m ,~n n C M(H) | N(H) to m.~,RtG)~ E MQ,~(c,)N, since M(H) C_ M and

d) In order to obtain formulae for transfer and restriction in M@N, I must first 
describe precisely the isomorphism 0 of a) giving M@N(H) as 
| Ind~,Resi N -~ Resell M | 
If K is a subgroup of H, then M(K) (resp. N(K)) maps into ResIM (resp. into 
ResiN), so there is a morphism 7r from | 
| 
N(K) to the right hand side. 
This morphism is surjective, because__if m 6 M(K) and m' 6 M(K') for If 7 ~ K', 
then m | m' = 0 in Res~M | 
ResiN- 
Now M(K) maps into/~, and N(K) maps into IndIResiN(I(), so into Ind',ResiN. 
So there is a morphism 7r' from |162174 
to the left hand side. The above 
isomorphism is the given (from right to left) by 
If now K is any subgroup of G, then 
Na/H(K) = IndIResIN(K ) ~- @=eH\a/KN(H N =K) 
If n E N(H N =K) C NC/H(K), let n' be the element x-b~ E N(H = N K), viewed

Those predsions give explicit formulae of transfer and restriction for M@N: let H c 
H' be subgroups of G, and K be a subgroup of H. If [m | n]A denotes the image in 
M@N(H) of m | n E M(K) | 
N(K), then 0-~([m | n]K) is the image of m | n in

Another identification of M@N 
The first identification of M@N gives M'.~)N(H) as a quotient of @Kc_HM(I() @R 
N(K). This expression is not very useful to evalnate M@N(X) for an arbitrary G-set 
X. 
If K is a subgroup of H, there is a corresponding "G-set over G/H", defined as the 
natural projection p~ : G/K --+ G/H. More generally, a G-set Y over the G-set X is 
a couple (Y, 6), where Y is a G-set and ~ a map of G-sets from Y to X. A morphism 
from (Y, r to (Y', ~') is a morphism of G sets f from Y to Y' such that r 
= r 
The next idea is then to consider for any (;-set X 
T(X) = ( 
,\(Y))/j 
Y ~ X 
where J is the R-submodule generated by tim elements 
M+(f)(m ') | n - m' Q N.(f)(r+), M.(f)(m) @ n' - m @ X*(f)(n') 
V f: (Y, r --+ (Y', r 
Vm E M(Y), m' E M(Y'), n E N(Y), n' E N(Y') 
(Note that there is no serious set theoretical problem in this definition, since the 
category of finite G-sets over X admits a small equivalent subcategory). 
If rn ~ n r M(Y) | 
N(Y), I will denote by [rn | n]ir,+/ its image in T(X). 
Lemma 1.6.1: With those definitions 
T(G/H) 
Mr 
W C_ G 
Proof: There is indeed a natural map 0 from M@N(H) to T(G/H), which sends 
[m| 
n]K to [m @ n](a/,Q,~): this map is well defined, because M,(pI~ 1~.) = t,~ and 
M*(p~) 
H whereas M,(x)is conjugation by x, and M*(x)is conjugaison by x-' 
= 
rA- ~ 
Conversely, let (Y,r 
be a G-set over G/II. 
As G is transitive on G/m there is 
a system of representatives S of G\Y contained in r 
In particular G, c_ H 
for all s E S. I denote by i+ the injection g.G+ ~ g.s from G/G~ to Y, and for 
m E M(Y) (resp. n C N(Y)), I write m, = M*(i~)(rn) (resp. n, = N*(ij(n)). The 
map m ~ %~esrn~ is an isomorphism from M(Y) to ~esM(G+). I define a map 0' 
from T(X) to MQN(H) by 
e, 
= Z["+ e n+]< 
sES 
The map 0' does not depend on the choice of .5' inside q5-1 (H): if S' is another system, 
then for any s' E S', there exists s r .5'and h+ E H such that s' = h~.s. In those 
conditions, I have ms, = hsrr+~, and fins, | n+,]a+, = [hsm~ | hsns]a+, = [m~ | n~]a, in 
M(~N(H). 
The map 0' is also well defined: if f : (Y, r 
--+ (Y', r 
is a morphism of sets over 
G/H, I have to check that 
O'(M.(f)(m) (9 n' - rn 0 N*(f)(n')) = 0 

1.6. ANOTHER fDENTIFICATION OF M<~N 
17 
and that 
O'(M*(f)(rn') @ n- m' Q N,(.f)(n)) 
= 
0 
Let S' C_ ~'-~(H) be the system of representatives of G\Y' chosen for Y'. Then [o1" 
any s E S, there exists a unique t~ E S' and an element h, E H such that f(s) = b.~.G. 
In those conditions 
O'([M.(f)(rn) | n'](v, r 
= G~,e.s,[M'(i~,)M.(f)(rn,) ~, N*(i~,)(n)]G/ 
Let P be the pull-back of Y and G/G~,, such that the square 
P 
~ Y 
tic<, 
, 
Y' 
is cartesian. 
Then P ~_ {(g.G~,,g) E G/G~ x Y I f(Y) : g.s'}. In particular, ifs' gt f(Y), then P 
is empty and M*(i~,)M,(f) = 0 in this case. 
And if f(9) = g.s', let s E ,5' C? (G..s). Then there exists gl such that y = g~.'s, so 
f(s) = 9~lg.s ', and this proves in particular that s' = G. Conversely, if t~ = s' and 
y = g.s, then f(y) = gh~.G and (gh~G,,, y) E P. So P may be identified as the union 
of the orbits G.s such that t~ = s ~. I have the following cartesian square

CHAPTER 1. MACKEY FUNCTORS 
A similar argument shows that 
O'(M*(f)(m') (4 ,z - m' ~% N.(f)(n)) 
0 
and so O' is well defined. 
It is cleat" that 0'0 is equal to identity of M<~;N(H). Conversely, 
O0'([rn | n](y,r 
= ~[M'(i~)(m) G, N'(ij(n)](ClC,,e)i,) 
.s6S 
But Y is isomorphic to the disjoint union of the GIGs, so 
m = ~ M.(i.)M*(i~)(m) 
sES 
so in T(X), I have 
[me n](y,r = ~ [V*(i~)(m) r M*(i.)M.(it)M*(it)(n)](a/a.,r 
s,t6S 
and as M is a Mackey functor, the product M*(i~)M.(it) is zero if s # t, and equal 
to the identity if s -- t. So 00' is equal to the identity, and this proves the lemma. .. 
I can now give T a structure of bifunctor: let X and X' be G-sets, and f be a 
morphism from X to X'. Then any set (Y, r over X defines a set (Y,.fr over X': I 
can define 
T.(f) ([m (9 n]O.-,r 
: [m | nJ(z, ye~) 
The map T.(f) is well defined, because if g : (}; r 
+ (Y', #), if m E M(Y) and 
n' E N(Y'), then 
T.(I) ([M.(g)(m) | n'](y,,r 
= [M.(g)(rn) | n'](z,,fr 
.... 
.... 
[-~ o N*(g)(~')J(y,:~) : ~.(f) ([.~ o N*(g)(~')](y,r 
A similar argument shows that 
| 
: r.(s)(w | 
so T.(f) is well defined. It is clear moreover that this turns T into a covariant functor. 
Conversely, (Y', r 
is a set over X', then let. (Y, r be the pull-back of X and Y', giving 
a cartesian square

The set (Y, O) is by definition the inverse image of (Y', r 
under f. 
Now let 
T*(f) (Ira | n](y,,r 
= [M*(a)(m) | N*(a)(n)](z,r 

1.6. ANOTHER IDENTIFICATION OF M@N

The map T* is well defined: if g is a morphism from (Y', r

There is a map h because the squares (Y, Y', X, X') and (Y~, Y/, X, X') are cartesian 
by construction. Moreover 
Then as (Y~, Y/, X, X') is cartesian, there exists a unique morphism h from Y to I/1 
such that r = r 
and ga = alh. The square (Y, Y', Y1, ]/1') is then cartesian, for 
its composition with the cartesian square (Y1, Y(, X,X') gives the cartesian square 
(Y,Y',X,X'). 
In those conditions, if m' E M(Y') and n'l C N(Y/), I have 
T*([M~(g)(m') | nl](gl, r 
= [M*(al)M.(g)(m') | N*(al)(nl)](y~,r

[M*(a)(rn') | N*(a)N*(g)(n'l)](r,r

A similar argument proves that 
T*([M*(g)(rrt'l) @ n'](y, r 
= T*([m' 1 @ N.(g)(~'~,/)](y1, r 
so the map T*(f) is well defined. It is also clear that T becomes a contravariant 
functor. 
In order to prove that the bifunctor T is a Mackey functor, I must check the con- 
ditions (M1) and (M2). Let X = Y [I Z be the disjoint union of Y and Z. I denote 
by iF and iz the respective injections from Y and Z to X. If (U, r 
is a G-set over 
X, let Uy = r 
(resp. Uz = r 
let eg (resp. Ca) be the restriction of r to 
Uy (resp. to Uz), and let uy (resp. uz) be the injection from Uy into U. Then U is 
the disjoint union of Uy and Uz. 
Let [rn | n](v,r 
E T(X). 
Since M and N are Mackey functors, I know that rn = 
(M.(nv)M*(uy)+M.(uz)M*(uz))(m) 
and n = (N.(uy)N*(uy)+N.(uz)N*(uz))(n). 
Moreover 
.... 
[M*(uv)(m) | N*(uy)N,(uv)N*(uy)(n)](uv,r

] don't need to check that T'(iz)T.(iy) is the identity of T(Y), if I know that. (M2) 
is true for T: in that case indeed, this follows from the fact that since iy is injective, 
then the square

[M'(~')(.~) | N'(a')(~)](w,~,) 
and this proves (M2) for the functor T. So T is a Mackey functor. 
To prove that T = M@N, all I have to do is to check that when f is the natural 
projection p~ from.G/K to G/H, for K C H, then T,(f) is equal up to the isomor- 
phisms of lemma 1.6.1, to the transfer t~- of M@N, and that T*(f) is equal to the 
restriction

Let (Y, r 
be a G-set over G/K, and let S C 05-1(/s be a system of

representatives of the orbits of Y. Then if [m | n](y,r E T(G/K), I have

I still have to check the compatibility of the isomorphisms 0 and 0 ~ with G-conjugations. 
Let H C_ G and x E G. If (Kr

be a system 
of representatives of G\Y. Let m~ be the conjugation gH ~ (gx-~)~H from G/H to 
GffH. Then if s E S, I have 
m~r

so xS = {xs I s E S} is such that m~r 
C_ ~H, and then 
s' 6xS 
But if s' = xs, then G~, = ~Gs, and m~, = M*(i~,)(m), where z~, is the injection

CHAPTER 1. MACKEY FUNCTORS

Functoriality 
The previous constructions have obvious functorial properties: the correspondence 
(M,N) ~ 7~(M,N) 
is a functor in two variables, contravariant in M and covariant in N, and the corre- 
spondence 
(M, N) ~ M~N 
is a covariant functor in M and N: if f (resp. g) is a morphism of Mackey functors 
from M' to M (resp. from N to N'), and if Y is a G-set, I can define a morphism 
7-~(f,g)y from ~(M,N)(Y) to 7-((M',N')(Y) by 
7-((f,g)z(h ) = g(y) o h o f 
for h C ~(M,N)(Y) = HOmMack(a)(M, Ny) 
where g(y) is the morphism from Ny to N~ defined by 
(~(r))~ 
= g~r 
: N~(X) = N(XY) ~ x~(x) = X'(XY) 
It is easy to check that if u : Y ~ Y' is a map of G-sets, then the square 
?-t(M, N).(u) 
7-t(M,N)(Y) 
, 
N(M,N)(Y') 
~(f,g)g[ 
[ 7-t(f, g)z, 
) 
~(M',N')(Y) ~(M',N').(u) ~(M',N')(Y') 
is commutative, as well as the square 
N(M, N)*(u) 
7t(M, N)(Y') 
~ 7-t(M, N)(Y) 
7-t(f,g)Y, I 
l T-t(f,g)Y 
, 7{(M', N')(Y) 
n(M',N')(g') 
n(M',X')*(u) 
So I have a morphism of Mackey functors 7-((f, g) from 7-t(M, N) to ~(M', N'). 
Now if f (resp. g) is a morphism from M to M' (resp. from N to N'), then I can 
define a morphism (f@9)y from M@N(Y) to M'QN'(Y): if (Z, r is a G-set over Y, 
let 
(f~g)z ([m | n](z,r 
= [fz(m) | gz(n)](z,r 
If f and g are morphisms of Mackey functors, then these maps are well defined, and 
if u : Y -~ Y' is a morphism of G-sets, then the squares 
(M+N).(u) 
M+N(Z) 
, 
M+N(Y')

The second identification of the tensor products can be extended to the case of the

the 
image of m~ @... @ mn in (MI@...@M,O(X). Then: 
Proposition 1.8.1: Let Mi, i C {1,...,n} be Mackey functors for G. 
Let 
L1 = M~, and for i C {2,...,n}, let Li = Li-I@Mi. Then for any G-set X, 
there is an isomorphism 
L~(X) ~_ (MI@...@M,O(X) 
which turns MI@... @M~ into a Mackey functor, in the following way: 
9 If f : X ~ X' is a morphism of G-sets, if (]I,r 
is a G-set over X, and 
ifmi C Mi(Y), for i E {1,...,n}, then 
(MI@... @M~).(f)([m, |

26 
CHAPTER 1. MACKEY FUNCTORS 
Proof: By induction on n, the case n = 2 being a consequence of the identification 
of M@N. By definition of L~ = Ln-I@M~, I have 
Ln(X) = ( (~ Ln-l(r) @ in(Y))/J 
YZX 
where J is the submodule generated by 
in-l..(f)([) @ rn' - l | M~(f)(Tn') 
i*~_~(f)(l') @ m - l' | M,~,,(f)(m) 
for f: (Y, 05) --+ (Y', 05'), m E M(Y), m'r M(Y"), 1E Ln_~(Y), 1' E L~-I(Y'). 
By induction hypothesis, I know that L~-I(Y) is generated by the elements 
[ml @ ... | 7"rtn-1](Z4b) 
where (Z, ~b) is a G-set over Y. I define a map 0 : L,~(X) --+ (M~@... @MrO(X) in 
the following way: if (Y, 05) is a G-set over X, if m E M(Y), if (Z, ~b) is a G-set over 
Y, and if I -- [ml @... | m~-l](z,v,), let 
0([I @ ~Ttl(y,~)) = [/rt 1 @... @ 7T/n_ 1 @ Mn(//))(fr/)](ZKbg, ) 
I must check that this map is well defined: let f : (Y, 05) -~ (Y', qS') be a morphism of 
G-sets over X. Then, by induction hypothesis, 
Ln_l,.(f)(1) 
= 
Ira, | 
| m,~-l](z,i~) 
So for m' E M,~(Y') 
O(L,~_l,.(f)(l) @ m') = [ma @... @ rn,~_l @ M*(f~)(m')](z,r 
whereas

M*

It follows that 
O((in_l).(f)(l) @ m t) : O(l @ M*(f)(gt'lt)) 
since 05'f = 05 and M*(f~b) = M~(~)M~(f). 
Similarly, if g : (Y', 05') --+ (Y, aS), let Z', a and ~b' such that the square 
a

y'

g 
is cartesian. Then by induction hypothesis, I have 
L;_l(g)(1 ) = [M;(a)(rnl) | 
| M~_l(a)(m~_l)](z,,p, ) 

1.8. N-FOLD TENSOR PRODUCT 
27 
and so 
O(L*_i(g)([ ) @ m') = [Ml(a)(mi) @... @ Mn_l(a)(mn_i) @ M,~(r162162 
But in (Mlc~... @Mn)(X), the right hand side is equal to 
[rnl | 
@ m=-i | M~,.(a)M:( ~')(rn')](z,e~) 
On the other hand 
O(1 @ M,~,.(g)(m')) = [m~ @... @ rnn_~ @ M:( @ )(M,O.(g)(m')](z,r 
and I have 
o(~:_i(g)(,) | 
= 0(~ | M.(g)(<) 
since M~,,(a)M~(r 
= M:(r 
in the above cartesian square. Thus 0 is well 
defined. 
I can now define a map O' in the other direction: if 
[m~ | 
| "~=](r,r e M,@... @M=(X) 
let l = ml | ... | ran-l, so I can consider the element [l](y,r E L,~-I(Y), and let 
o'(i~ |174 ~,>.,) = [c,l~..~)| 
~ L~(.O 
This map is well defined: if i is an integer lower or equal to n - 1, and if u E Ji, then 
u is a linear combination of elements of the form v - w, with

o'(Ewl<,,,,~,} = [~:_,(s)(Cn<Y,,,~))| 
In Ln(X), this element is equal to 
[[l'](Y',ld) @ Mn,.(f)(TT~n)l(y,,dy , = 0/([V](y,,qS,,) 
So the map 0' is well defined. 
Now let (Y, 05) he a a-set over x, and (Z, q$) be a a-set over Y. If mi E Mi(Z) for 
i _< n - 1 and mn E M,~(Y), let l = rnl @ ...-@ rn,~_l. I have 
0,0([i,1(,,+, | ~o](y,+,) = 0,(E, | M:(+)(mo)l(,,++,) = [I'l<z,,d, | M:(+)(~n)] <z,~ 
and in L,~(X), this is equal to 
[in-I,*(~))([l](z,Id)) @ ~n] (y,r 
Finally, as L~_l,.(~b)([l](z, la)) = [/](z,~), I have 0'0 = Id. 
Conversely, if mi C Mi(Y) for i _< n, and if l = rnl | ... | rnn_l, then 
and this proves that 0 and 0' are mutual inverse isomorphisms, which completes the 
proof of the proposition.

Universal property 
The analogy between the tensor product of Mackey functors and the usual tensor 
product will become clear with the notion of n-linear morphism, defined as follows: 
Definition: Let M1, . . . , M~ and P be Mackey functors for the group G. An n-linear 
morphism L from M1,..., M,~ to P is by definition a correspondence which to any 
n-tuple of G sets X1,..., X~ associates an n-linear map 
L~ ...... xo : M,(X~) •

I denote by s 
M~; P) the set of n-linear morphisms from M1,..., M~ to 
P, with its natural structure of R-module. This construction is clearly functorial, 
contravariant in/141,... M~, and covariant in P. 
If X1,... ,X~ are G-sets, I define a map

where for all i, the map pi is the i-th projection from X1 x ... x X~ onto 3//. Then 
Proposition 1.8.2" The previous equalities define an element 
7r E s 
which has moreover the following universal property: if P is a Mackey 
functor for the group G, and if f 6 s 
then there exists a

CHAPTER i. 
MACKEY FUNCTORS 
Conversely, if f is a morphism of Mackey functors from MIQ... @M~ to P, 
then this formula defines an n-linear morphism from M1,..., M~ to P, and 
this correspondence induces an isomorphism of/?-modules 
HomM~ckR(a)(Ml@... @M,~, P) ~_ s 
]~I~; P) 
which is natural with respect to M1 ..... k'L~, P. 
Proof." 1) First I have to check that 7r is an n-linear morphism from M1,..., M.~ to 
Ml@... QM.,~. I suppose given for an integer i a morphism fi : X~ --+ X~. Let then 
f = (Idx~•

I have

On the other hand, if p'~ is the projection from X1 • ... • X[ x ... • X'~ onto its i-th

Finally as pjf = pj for j r i, and a.s pif = fiPi, it follows that ~r is contravariant with 
respect to the i-th factor, and hence it is an n-linear morphism. 
2) I must now prove the universal property: let P be aMackey functor, and f E 
s 
M,,; P). If X is a G-set, I define a morphism fx from (MI@... @M~)(X) 
to P(X) in the following way: if (Y, r is a G-set over X, and if mi E Mi(Y) for all 
i, let 
fx ([rnt @... @ rn~](y,4,)) : P,(r 
,ran) 
where 5,,~,y denotes the diagonal injection y ~ (y,..., y) from Y into Y~. 
First I have to check that f is well defined. I suppose that g : (Y, r --+ (Y', r 
is a 
morphism of G-sets over X, that rn} E Mj(Y') for j r i, and that mi 9 M~(Y). Then

Setting 1 = f-~ x Id x g,~-i-1 I

which proves that f is well defined. 
3) I must now check that j 7 is u morphism of Mackey functors. Let g be a morphism 
of G-sets from X to X'. If (Y, r is a G-set over X, and if mi E M~(Y) for 1 < i < n, 
then 
(MI+... + Mn ).(g ) ( [ml @... @ rnn](y,r ) = [77ll (~... | 7D, n](Y,9r

If now 9 is a morphism from X' to X, let Y', r and a such as the square

The image under 27x, of this element is then 
P.(r163

and as f is n-linear, I have 
fY,,...,z, (M;(a)(ml),..., M,~(a)(m,O) = P*(a'~)fv,...,v(ml,..., m, 0 
Moreover a~6n,z, = 6,~,va, and P.(C')P*(a) = P*(g)P.(r

4) Finally, let X1,...,X,~ be G sets, and m~ E M~(X~) for 1 < i < n. Then, setting 
X=X1 
x...xX~,Ihave 
.... 
P*(5,~,x)fx,...,x (M;(p,)(m,),..., Mg(pn)(m~,)) 
The n-linearity of f gives then

and as (Pl x ... x P,~)5,~,x = Idx, I have 
fx1x...xXn 71"x ...... Xn = fXl,...,X, 
5) Conversely, if f is an n-linear morphism from M~)... QM~ to P, and if I define 
fx~,...,x~ by the above formulae, I get an element f of s 
M~; P): to see this, 
let i E {1,... ,n}, let gi : Xi ~ X~ be a morphism of a-sets, and let m 5 r Mj(Xj) for 
1 _< j _< ~. Setting then X~ = X 9 and gj = Id for j r i, and denoting by X (resp. 
X') the product X~ x... x X~ (resp. X[ • 
x X;), and pj (resp. p~) the projection 
from X (resp. X') onto Xi (resp. onto X[), I have

?x,([Ml(Pll)ml,.(gl)(ml)|

Since p} = pj and gj = Id for j r i, this is also equal to 
k,([Mr(p,)(m,)

Denoting by g the product gl x ... x g,~, the square

6) To complete the proof, it remains to see that the above correspondences between 
s

respect to M1,..., M~, P, are bijective. 
Let f

Conversely, if f is an element in HonaM~k(G)(ma(~... @M~, P), it corresponds to f E

f~( ([ml |

Using again the fact that f is a morphism of Mackey functors, I get 
k(In,|

which proves that f' = f, and completes the proof of the proposition. 
,. 
Let f E s 
,M.,~; P) be an n-linear morphism, associated by the previous 
proposition to a unique morphism of Mackey functors ffrom MI~... ~M~ to P. The 
formula 
.fx ([grZl @... @ WtnJ(Y,~)) z P.(~)P*(5~,y)fy,...,y(ml,..., rn,~) 
shows that f is entirely determined by the knowledge, for any G-set Y, of the s-linear 
map fz : M~(Y) x...x M,~(Y) ~ P(Y) defined by 
/r(-~,...,-~,) 
= P'(<,Y)s 
,-~,) 
Indeed, knowing f, I can recover a 7 by 
This formula will give the conditions on the maps fy so that the map f is well defined 
and is a morphism of Mackey functors. 
In order f to be well defined, if g: (Y', qS') --+ (Y, qS) is a morphism of G-sets over X, 
if ro, j E Mj(Y) for j # i and m{ C Mi(Y'), the elements

[M~(g)(rnl)@...@M$_l(g)(rrZi_l)@rrz'i@M*+l(g)(rr~i+l)@...@M~(g)(rnr~)](y,,~, ) 
must have the same image under f, and since P.(qS') = P*(~)P*(g), this gives 
P*( O ) fY (~'Ttl,.-., 17Zi-1, Mi,*(g)(wt:), rill+l,..., ~ln) .... 
= P.(~)P.(g)fy, (M;(g)(rnl),..., M;l(g)(mi_,) , ""i, M;+l(g)(rrzi+l),'", Mn(g)(r~

1.8. N-FOLD TENSOR PRODUCT 
37 
If equality (Ai) is true for all i E {1,..., n}, then 2 7 is well defined. 
In those conditions, it is clear moreover that f is covariant: if g : X --+ X' is a 
morphism of G-sets, then for any a-set (Y, r over x and for any rnj C Mj(Y), I have 
(]~/i1@''" @Mn).(g)(['rr/1 @''' @ rr/n](Y,&)) = [7"721 @''' @ ?Ttn](Y,gr

I still have to express the fact that 27 must be contravariant. Let g : X' --+ X be a 
morphism of G-sets, and suppose the square 
a 
y'

X'

is cartesian. If rni E Mi(Y) for 1 < i < n, then 
Taking the image under fx, gives 
P.(~gt)fy,(Ml (a)(?T~l),. . . ,i,~(a)(~l,n)) 
that must be equal'to 
P*(g)P.(r

Since moreover P*(g)P.(r 
= P.(r 
this equality will result from the case 
X=Y,X'=Y~,r162 
This gives 
(B) 
]y,(M;(g)(ml),. . . ,Mn(g)(mn)) = P*(g)fy(rn, l,. . . ,mn) 
for any g : Y' ~ Y. The next proposition is a summary of conditions (A~) and (B) 
in the case n = 2

The following data are equivalent:

CtfAPTER 1. MACKEY FUNCTORS 
1.9 
Commutativity and associativity 
It should be clear from the previous sections that the tensor product is commutative 
and associative: 
Proposition 1.9.1: Let M, N, and P be Mackey functors for the group G. 
Then there are isomorphisms of Mackey functors 
M~N ~_ N(~M 
(M+N)_~P ~ M(~(N+P) 
which are natural in M, N and P. 
Proof: Let X be a G-set, and (Y, r be a G-set over X. It is clear that the map 
[m | n](z,r e M+N(X) ~ In | m](v,,) E N+M(X) 
is well defined, and induces the desired isomorphism between M~N and N~M. 
The second assertion can be proved by observing that, for any Mackey fnnctor Q, 
morphisms from each of its sides to Q are in one to one correspondence with trilinear 
morphisms from M, N, P to Q. The desired isomorphism is then a consequence of 
this universal correspondence. 
Another (less canonical) way to see this isomorphism, is to use commutativity: 
M+(N+P) ~_ (N4P)~M = NQP+M 
and to observe that the n-fold tensor product is clearly independent, up to isomor- 
phism, of the order of its factors. 
" 
1.10 
Adjunction 
I have moreover the following adjunction properties: 
Proposition 1.10.1: Let M, N, and P be Mackey functors for the group G. 
Then there exists an isomorphism 
~(M+N,P) ~_ It(N,~(M,P)) 
natural in M, N, and P. 
Proofi Let X be a G-set. Then 
?-t(N,?'t(M,P))(X) = HomM~ck(G)(N,~(M,P)x) 
On the other hand 
whereas 
/'f(M, P)x(Y) = 7-t(M, P)(YX) = HomM~k(a)(M, Pzx) 
~(M, Px)(Y) = HomM.~k(G)(M, (Px)z) 

1.i0. ADJUNCTION 
39 
But (Px)y(Z) = Px(ZY) = P(ZYX), and those isomorphisms are easily seen to 
induce a natural isomorphism of Mackey functors (Px)~" -~ PYx. Those isomorphisms 
of Mackey functors induce in turn an isomorphism 
It follows that 
But since 
7-{(M,P)x ~- 7-t(M, Px) 
7-t(N,~(M,P))(X) ~_ HomM~k(G)(N,~(M, Px)) 
~-~(M@N, P)(X) = Hon'lMack(O )(M~N, PX ) 
it is enough to have a natural isomorphism 
HomMar 
P) ~- HomM~k(a)(N, n(M, P)) 
This is equivalent to say that the functor N H M~N is left adjoint to the functor 
P ~-+ 7if(M, P). But a morphism from M~N to P corresponds naturally to a bilinear 
morphism from M, N to P. To prove the proposition, it is enough to build a natural 
bijection between HomMack(a)(N, 7-t(M, P)) and s 
N; P)I 
But a morphism a from N to 7-t(M, P) is determined by a collection ay, indexed 
by G-sets, of morphisms from N(Y) to 
n(M, P)(Y) = Hom~a~k(c.)(M, Py) 
The morphism ay is determined by morphisms (ay(n))x from M(X) to Py(X) = 
P(XY), for any G-sets X, and any n C N(Y). I have then a morphism 6~x,y from 
M(X) OR N(Y) to P(XY), defined by 
ax,Y(-~ | ~) = (~(~))~(m) 
and it is easy to see that a is a morphism of Mackey functors from N to ~(M, P) if 
and only if the element 5 defined that way is a bilinear morphism from M, N to P. 
Conversely, if I have u bilinear morphism 5 from M, N to P, reading from right 
to left the above formula, I can define a morphism 
which induces a morphism of Mackey flmctors from N to ~(M, P). 
Those constructions are clearly inverse to each other, and natural in M, N, and 
P. This completes the proof of the proposition.

Chapter 2 
Green functors 
2.1 
Definitions 
The classical definition of a Green functor is "a Mackey functor with a compatible ring 
structure": a Green functor A for the group G over the ground ring R is a Mackey 
functor, such that for any subgroup H of G, the R-module A(H) has a structure of 
R-algebra (associative, with unit), which is compatible with the Mackey structure, in 
the following sense: 
9 If z E G, and K is a subgroup of G, then the conjugation by x is a morphism 
of rings (with unit) from A(/s to A(~K). 
9 If H C_ K are subgroups of G, then r~ is a morphism of rings (with unit) from 
A(K) to AtH). 
9 In the same conditions, if a E A(K) and b E A(H), then 
a.t~(b) 
= tI" ~ K a 
.(~H( 
)" ) 
t~(b).a = t~(b.rK(a)) 
There is an evident notion of morphism of Green functors: a morphism ~b from the 
Green functor A to the Green functor B is a morphism of Mackey functors such that, 
for any subgroup H of G, the morphism CH is a morphism of rings. The morphism 
r is said to be unitary if the morphism •H preserves unit for ~11 H. It is actually 
enough that the morphism r 
preserves unit, since

G 
G . 
G 
rHOG(1A(G)) =

= Cs(rslA(o)) = 
rH1B(C )

A module over the Green functor A, or A-module, is defined similarly as a Mackey 
functor M for the group G, such that for any subgroup H of G, the module M(H) 
has a structure of A(H)-module (with unit). This structure must be compatible with 
the Mackey structure, in the following sense: 
9 If x E G and K C G, let m ~ ~'m be the conjugation by x from M(K) to 
M(~K). If a 9 A(K) and m 9 M(K), then ~(a.m) = ~(a).~(m) 
9 If H C If are subgroups of G, if a 9 A(K) and m 9 M(K), then r~(a.rn) = 
"f,( a 
) .

CHAPTER 2. GREEN FUNCTORS 
A morphism r from the A-module M to the A-module N is a morphism of Mackey 
functors from M to N such that fox" any subgroup H of G, the morphism Cs is a 
morphism of A(H)-modules. 
An important example of Green functor is obtained for any Mackey functor from the 
isomorphism 
"H( M, M)( H) ~_ HOmM~k(H)( Res~ M, ReSaH M) 
In particular, the composition of morphisms turns TI(M, M)(H) into a ring with unit, 
and "H(M, M) is actually a Green functor. 
Proposition 2.1.1: If M is a Mackey functor for the group G, then/-t(M, M) 
has a natural structure of Green functor. 
Proof: Let r be an endomorphism of the Mackey functor Res~M. Then r is deter- 
mined by morphisms eL : M(L) -~ M(L), for s C_ H. The product of r and ~b is 
defined by 
(r 
: CL~L 
If K is a subgroup of H, and if L is a subgroup of K, then 
It is then clear that r H is a morphism of rings (with unit) from EndM~ck(u)(Res~M) 
G 
to EndM~ck(h-)(ResKM ). 
Moreover, if x 6 G, and if L C_ XH, then denoting by c~ the conjugation by x, I have 
(=r 
: ~xr162 
and it is also clear that the conjugation by x is also a morphism of rings with unit 
from EndMa~k(H)(aes~M) to EndMack(.H)(ReSa~HM). 
If now H c_ It', if a e EndM~ck(~.-)(Res~-M) and if b ~ EndM.~k(u)(Res~M), then for

and this proves the proposition. 
,, 
When G is a group and k a ring, a kG-module is a k-module with a morphism 
of rings kG ~ Endk(M). Reformulating this assertion in the case of Green functors, 
replacing "ring" by "Green fnnctor" and Endk(M) by ~(M, M), I get the following 
proposition 
Proposition 2.1.2: Let M be a Mackey functor, and A a Green functor for 
the group G. Then it is equivalent to give M a structure of A-module, or 
to give a unitary morphism of Green functors from A to ~(M, M). 
Proof:l) Let M be an A-module. If L C_ H are subgroups of G, and if a E A(H), I 
define an endomorphism CH(a)L of M(L) by setting 
= 
and I claim that I obtain that way an endomorphism CH(a) of Res~M. Indeed, if 
L C K _C H, and if m E M(K), I have 
and this shows that CH(a) commutes with restrictions. Similarly, if x E H, if L C H, 
and if m E M(L), then 
H 
a 
x 
since if x E H and a E A(H), then ~a = a. 
Hence CH(a) also commutes with 
conjugations by elements of H. 
Finally, if L C_ K C H, and if m E M(L), then 
and this shows that CH(a) is an endomorphism of Res~M. 
It is clear that CH(1A(H)) is the identity endomorphism of ResaM, since rLH(1A(H)) = 
1A(L), and that CH is a morphism of rings with unit from A(H) to EndM~k(H)(Res~M), 
since moreover for a, a' E A(H) 
(r162 
: Cg(a)L(r~(a').m) .... 
.... rH(a)rH(a').rn = rH(aa').m = CH(aa')L(m) 
I also claim that the maps CH define a morphism of Mackey functors from A to 
~(M, M): indeed, let L C H' C H be subgroups of G, let a E A(H), and m E M(L). 
Then 
H 
r 
= r~L rH,(a).m = rLH(a).m = CH(a)L(rn) 

44

and this shows that r

for any subgroup L of H', or that eH,(r~,a) =

so 4) is a morphism of Mackey functors. So to any A-module M, I know how to 
associate a morphism of Green functors from A to Tt(M, M). 
2) Conversely, let M be a Mackey functor, and %b be a morphism of Green functors 
from A to ~(M, M). Then for any subgroup H of G, I have a morphism of rings 
with unit ~)H from A(H) to EndM~k(H)(Res~M). Then, for any a E A(H) and any 
subgroup K of H, I have an endomorphism OH(a)r," of the R-module M(K). Then 
for m E M(H) and a E A(H), I set 
I obtain a structure of A(H)-module (with unit) on M(H): indeed 
1A(H).m = ~H(1A(H))H(rn) = m 
because ~p preserves the unit. Moreover, the product (a, rn) ~ a.m is distributive 
with respect to addition in M(H), because ~H(a) is an endomorphism of M(H). 
The product is also distributive with respect to addition in A(H), because eH is 
a morphism of R-modules from A(H) to EndM~ck(H)(ResaHM). 
Finally, as ~pH is 
multiplicative, it follows that for a,a' E A(H) and m E M(H), I have (aa').m = 
a.(a'm). 
Those structures of A(H)-module on M(H) are compatible with the Mackey functor 
structures of A and M: indeed, if x E G, if K C_ G, if a E A(K) and if rn E M(K), 
then 

'2.1. DEFINITIONS

But ~,~K(~'a) = a:(r

and this proves that M is an A-module. 
3) The last observation is that the above correspondences are mutually inverse: if M 
is an A-module, I associate to M the morphism 6 defined by 
and starting kom 6, I define an A-module structure by 
and I recover the initial A-module structure. 
Conversely. if g, is a. morphism of Green fimctors from A to ~(M, M), I associate to 
4' the A-module structure defined by 
and this in tm'n corresponds to the morphism b of Green functors defined by 
and this completes the proof.

CHAPTER 2. GREEN FUNCTORS 
2.2 
Definition in terms of G-sets 
The previous section leads to a definition of Green functors and their modules in terms 
of G-sets. Indeed, if A is a Green functor and M an A-module, then by the previous 
proposition there is a morphism of Green flmctors 
Using adjunction, and commutativity of the tensor product, I get a morphism 
A+M -~ M 
which in turn corresponds to a bilinear morphism AM E s 
M; M), determined by 
maps 
Ax,v : A(X) x M(Y) ~ M(X • Y) 
for any G-sets X and Y. I will use intensively the following multiplicative notation, 
for a E A(X) and m E M(Y) 
a • m = L~y(a,m) 
Those remarks and notations lead to the following definition, akin to the classical 
definition of an algebra: 
Definition: 
Let R be a commutative ring. A Green functor A (over R) for the 
group G is a Mackey functor (over R) endowed for any G-sets X and Y with bilinear 
maps 
A(X) x A(Y) ~ A(X

denoted by (a,b) ~-+ a x b which are bifunctorial, associative, and unitary, in tile

If A and B are Green functors for the group G, a morphism f (of Green functors) 
from A to B is a morphism of Mackey functors such that for any G-sets X and Y, 
the square

that f is unitary. 
I will denote by GreenR(G) or Green(G) the category of Green [unctors for G over 
R, and unitary morphisms between them. 
Remarks: 1) The expression "up to identifications (X • Y) • Z _~ X • Y • Z ~_ 
X x (Y x Z)" means more precisely that the diagrams

Here c~xy, z is the canonical bijection ((z,y), z) ~ (x,y,z) from (X x Y) x Z to 
X x Y x Z, and flxy, z is the bijection (x,(y,z)) ~ 
(z,y,z) from X x (Y x Z) to 
X x Y x Z. From now on, I will always forget those isomorphisms, and I will write 
directly the commutative square of the definition. 
2) Similarly, I will always write a x e = a = e x a, identifying (X x .) and (. x X) 
with X. 
There is an analogous definition for a module over the Green functor A: 
Definition: Let A be a Green functor over l~ for the group G. A module M over A 
is a Mackey functor M (over It), endowed for any G-sets X and Y with R-bilinear 
maps 
A(X) x M(Y) --, M(X x Y) 
denoted by a x m ~ 
a x m, which are bifimctorial, associative and unitary in the 
fol]owing sense:

2.3 
Equivalence 
of the two 
definitions 
Let A be a Green functor in the classical sense. It is clear that A is also an A-module 
in the classical sense, since the module A(H) has a natural structure of A(H)-module. 
Then proposition 2.1.2 proves that there exists a morphism from A to "If(A, A), hence

by adjunction a morphism from A~A to A, and also then a bilinear morphism from 
A, A to A: to be concrete, if H and K are subgroups of G, the maps

This follows easily from the proofs of propositions 1.10.1 and 2.1.2: proposition 2.1.2 
shows that A is a "H(A, A) module. If H is a subgroup of G, and if a E A(H), then a 
defines an endomorphism of the Mackey functor Res~A by 
VL c_ H, b E A(L) ~ rH(a).b E A(L)

By proposition 1.8.3, I know that such a bilinear morphism is determined by R-bilinear 
maps A(Y) • M(Y) -* M(Y), that I will denote by (a,m) ~ a.m, defined by 
a.7~ = M*(~2,y)(a • m) 
This notation is coherent, for in the case Y = G/H, the map 
A*(5~,v/,) : A(G/H • G/H) ~-

A(H N ~H) + A(H) 
z6HkG/H 
is precisely the projection on the component associated to the double class H.1.H = 
H. Formula (2.1) now gives 
M*(f2,y)(a x m) = H 
H 
The ring structures of the A(H), and the A(H) rnodule structures of the M(H), admit 
a unique extension to maps A(Y) x M(Y) --* M(Y) defined for any G-sets Y, a.nd 
having properties i), ii), and iii) of proposition 1.8.3: indeed, if Y is a G-set, let 
[G\Y] be a system of representatives of orbits of G on Y. For x E [G\Y], let i~ be 
the injection from G/G~ into Y defined by 
i~(.qG~) = .qx 
Then as Y is the disjoint union of its orbits, for any a E A(Y) and any m E M(Y), I 
have 
a=

and it is easy to deduce from this equation that bifunctoriality and associativity of 
the product x imply associativity of the product ".", since for instance 
whereas by a similar computation 
And now ife is the unit for the product x, then gr is a unit for the product ".", since

CHAPTER 2. GREEN FUNCTORS 
A similar argument proves that sy is also a right unit for the product "." of A(Y). 9 
So the definitions of a Green functor and of a module over a Green functor in 
terms of G-sets are equivalent to the classical ones. It also follows from equalities 
(2.3) and (2.4) that the definitions of morphisms of Green fnnctors and of morphisms 
of modules over a Green functor coincide: for example, if f is a morphism in the 
classical sense from the Green functor A to the Green functor B, then fH is a ring 
rnorphism from A(H) to B(H), for any subgroup H of G. It follows easily that for 
any G-set X, the morphism fx : A(X) -, B(X) is compatible with the product ".". 
Then formula (2.3) gives for M = A, a E A(X) and a' E A(Y) 
Taking image under fXxY of this equality gives 
fxxy(a• 
(A* x~Y)(a).A*(;Y)(a')) .... 
But as f is a morphism of Mackey functors, I have 
and 
Thus 
]~- • y A* 
" 
= B* 
.fy 
and f is a morphism in the sense of the new definition. Equality (2.4) proves similarly 
that a morphism in the sense of the new definition is also a morphism in the classical 
sense. 
2.4 
The Burnside functor 
In this section, I suppose for simplicity that R = Z. All the results can be extended 
to the case of an arbitrary commutative ring by "tensoring everything with R ~', and 
replacing tensor products over Z by tensor products over R. 
2.4.1 
The Burnside functor as Mackey functor 
The classical definition of the Burnside functor b (over Z) is the following: for a 
subgroup H of G, the module b(H) is the Grothendieck group of the category of 
H-sets, for relations given by decomposition into disjoint union. 
Restriction and 
induction of H-sets give a Mackey functor structure on b. The direct product of sets 

2.4. THE BURNSIDE FUNCTOR 
53 
turns b(H) into a (commutative) ring, and it is easy to check that b is actually a 
Green functor. 
But this definition does not give the structure of b(X), when X is an arbitrary G- 
set. The next proposition answers this question. If X is a G-set, I denote by G-setJ.x 
the category with G-sets over X as objects, and maps of G-sets over X as morphisms. 
Lemma 2.4.1: Let H be a subgroup of G. The functor mapping a G-set 
(I/,r 
over G/H to the H-set r 
is an equivalence of categories from 
G-set~a/H to H-set.The inverse equivalence is the induction functor from 
H-set to G-set~G/H. 
Proof: Let (Y, qS) be a G-set over G/H. 
Then it is clear that the inverse image 
r 
of the element H < G/H is an H-set. If f: (Y,r 
--+ (Y',r 
is a morphism 
of G-sets over G/H, then r = r 
so 
f(r 
C_ r 
and so I do have a functor F from Gset$c/H to H-set. 
Conversely, if X is an H-set, then there exists a unique morphism of H-sets (~) : 
X --+ .. The image of this morphism under the induction functor from H to G gives 
a G-set 
r 
r'(x) = Ind~,X -+ IndT. ~_ G/H 
over G/H, and it is clear that F' is a functor from H-set to G-set~a/H. I will now 
check that F and F' are mutual inverse equivalences of categories. 
Let me first recall that Ind~/X is the quotient set of G • X by the equivalence relation 
identifying (gh, x) and (g, hx) for any h E H. 
The group G acts on the left by 
g'.(g, x) = (9'9, x), where I denote by (g, x) the equivalence class of (g, x). The above 
map r is then given by r 
= gH. If f is a morphism of H-sets from X to X', 
then F'(f) is given by 
: 
(g,s(x)) 
But then r 
= H if and only if g E H. It it then clear that the map from 
rr'(x) 
= {(h,x) I h e H, x 9 x} to x which sends (h,x) to hx is an isomorphism 
from the fnnctor FF' onto the identity functor of H-set. 
Conversely, if (I/, r is a G-set over G/H, then the map from Ind~r 
to Y sending 
(g, y) to gy is surjective, because any orbit of G on Y meets r 
It is also injective, 
for if gY = g'Y' with r 
= r 
= H, then gH = g'H, and there exists h 9 H such 
that g' = gh, and gy : ghy', i.e. y = hy'. Then (g',y') = (g, hy') = (g,Y). It is 
easy to see that this is an isomorphism of functors from F'F to the identity functor 
of G-set~a/H, and this completes the proof of the lemma. 
" 
As a consequence, if H is a subgroup of G, then b(H) is isomorphic to the 
Grothendieck group of G-setIG/H, for relations given by decomposition into disjoint 
union of G-sets over G/H. This is actually true for any G-set: 
Proposition 2.4.2: Let X be a G-set. Then b(X) is isomorphic to the Gro- 
thendieek group of G-set.Lx, for relations given by decomposition into dis- 
joint union. Moreover, if (Y, r 
is a G-set over X,

Remark: In this proposition, I identify (Y, r 
with its image in the Grothendieck 
group. 
Proofi I can consider for a while this proposition as a definition of b. It is clear that 
the definitions of b. and b* can be extended by linearity to group homomorphisms 
between b(X) and b(X'), turning b into a bifunctor defined on G-set, with values in 
abelian groups (i.e. Z-modules). If I can prove that b is a Mackey functor, and that it 
coincides as a Mackey functor with the Burnside functor defined on transitive G-sets, 
the proposition will follow. 
First it is clear that the Grothendieck group of G-setSx is additive with respect 
to X: if (U,r 
is a G-set over XLIY, then U is the disjoint union of r 
and 
r 
which are G-sets respectively over X and }'. Conversely, the disjoint union 
of a G-set over X and a G-set over Y is a G-set over X [I Y. Additivity of b foIlows. 
Now let 
7 
T 
, X

Y 
, 
Z

be a cartesian square, and (U, r 
be a G-set over X. Let V, a and b such that the 
square 
V 
, 
U 
T 
, X 
"7 
is cartesian. Then b*(7)((U, r 
= (V, b), so 
b.(~)b'(~)((U, ~)) = (V,~b) 
On the other hand, I have ~.(.)((U, r 
= (U, ~), and as the square

is cartesian, because it is composed of the two above squares, I have 
((U, 
= (V, 
which proves that b*(t3)b.(a') = b.(~)b*(@, and so b is a Mackey functor. 
Now let H C__ K be subgroups of G, and L be a subgroup of H. I denote by FH 
and F~, the equivalences between the categories associated to H in lemma 2.4.1. Then 
the image of the H-set H/L under the functor F~ is the G-set 
G/L 
, G/H 
over G/H, denoting by ~rL 
H the natural projection from G/L onto G/H. The image 
of that set under b.(Tr~) is the set 
7rKTr H 
H 
L 
GIL 
, GIK 
that is the set (G/L, 7r)) over G/K. The image of that set under the functor F~,- is 
the set K/L, which is the induced set of H/L from H to K. 
If now L is a subgroup of K, then the image of K/L under F[,- is the G-set (G/L, Trf), 
which is mapped under b*(~r~) to the set (P, r filling the cartesian square

Finally, if x E G and if L is a subgroup of K, then the image of K/L under F[~- is 
the set (G/L, rrI[). Let cx be the conjugation by x, from G/K to G/'~K. The image 
of the previous set under b.(cx) is (G/L, cxTr~L ~) = (G/L, ~r~Kcx), which is mapped by 
F~K to XK/~:L, and this completes the proof of the proposition. 
9 
2.4.2 
The 
Burnside 
functor 
as Green 
functor 
The Green functor structure of the Burnside functor is also very natural: 
Proposition 2.4.3: Let X and Y be G-sets. If E -- (U, r 
(resp. F = (V,~b)) 
is a G-set over X (resp. over Y), I denote by E x F the G-set (U x V,r x r 
over X x Y. Then the product x can be extended by linearity to a product 
from b(X) | b(Y) to b(X x Y), and this turns b into a Green functor, with 
the set (.,Id) over 9 as unit c E b(*) . 

56 
CHAPTER 2. GREEN FUNCTORS 
Proof: It is clear that the product ((U, 6), (V~ ~)) is left distributive with respect to 
disjoint union of G-sets over X, and right distributive with respect to disjoint union 
of G-sets over Y. It follows that the product x can be extended by bilinearity to a 
product b(X) | b(Y) --+ b(X x Y). 
This extended product is cleariy associative, and admits as a unit the trivial G-set 
over itself. 
The product x is also clearly bifunctorial: if f : X --+ X' and g : Y --+ Y' are 
morphisms of G-sets, then 
b.(:) ((v, ,)) • b.(g)((v, v:)) = (v, :~) ~< (v, g,:) : (u • v, :,~ • gv:) .... 
.... 
(u • v,(: • ~)(+ • ~:,)) : ~.(f • .)((v, r215 (v, v:)) 
Now if f : X' ~ X and g : Y' ~ Y are morphisms of G-sets, and if the squares

is also cartesian, and then 
b*(f • g)((V, ~) • (<~)) 
This shows that the product x is bifunctorial, and proves the proposition. 
This product • gives in turn a product "." from b(X) @ b(X) to b(X), defined for 
two G-sets (U, r and (V, g)) over X by

This equality proves that the product "." coincides for X = G/H with the product of 
H-sets, up to identifications of ]emma 2.4.1: indeed, if K and L are subgroups of H, 
then Fb(H/K) = (G/L, 7r H) and F~,(H/L) = (G/L, ~rH), and the pull-back of those 
two sets is

2.4.3 
The Burnside 
functor as initial object 
The Burnside functor plays the same role for Green functors as the ring Z does for 
rings with unit: it is an initial object of the category of Green functors: 
Proposition 2.4.4: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. Then there 
exists a unique (unitary) morphism of Green functors from b to A. 
Proof: Let f be a unitary morphism from bto A, and X bea G-set. If (U,r 
is a 
G-set over X, then denoting by eb the unit of b, I have

is cartesian, and its right column is equal to e. Hence b* (:)(e) = (U, Id), which 
proves the above formula. 
Now if f is a unitary morphism of Green functors, I must have 
and this proves that f is unique. 
Conversely, this formula defines a unitary morphism of Green functors: first it is a 
morphism of Mackey functors, for if g : X ~ X ~ is a morphism of G-sets, then 
Thus 
b,((u,,)) = (u,g~) 
Similarly, if g: X' ~ X is a morphism of G-sets, then b* ((U, r

9 
In particular, any Mackey functor M is a b-module, since there is a unitary mor- 
phism from b to ~(M, M). So Mackey functors can be identified to modules over the 
Burnside functor. This structure of b-module for a Mackey functor M is quite easy 
to describe: if X and Y are G-sets, and if (U, r is a G-sets over X, I have seen that

2.4.4 
The Burnside functor as unit 
The next proposition confirms the analogy between the Burnside functor and the ring 
Z: 
Proposition 2.4.5: Let M be a Mackey functor for the group G. Then there 
exists isomorphisms of Mackey functors 
bQM ~- M~b ~- M 
7{(b, M) _~ M 
which are natural in M. 
Proof: The first isomorphism is a consequence of the second one and of proposition 
1.10.1: indeed, if 7-{(b, M) _~ M, then for any Mackey functor N, I have 
"H(N,M) ~_ "H(N,'H(b,M)) ~_ n(b~N,M) 
and those isomorphisms are natural in M and N. Evaluating this isomorphism at the 
trivial G-set gives the functorial isomorphism 
HomMa&(~)( N, - ) ~- HomMa&(c)( b~ N, - ) 
and Yoneda's lemma now proves the first isomorphism. 
To prove the second one, I observe first that 
HomMa~k(G)(b, M) ~_ M(.) 
Indeed, I saw in the previous proof that if (U, r is a G-set over X, then in b(X), I 
have 
So if 8 is a morphism of Mackey functors from b to M, I have 
(:)0.(< 

60 
CHAPTER 2. GREEN FUNCTORS 
and 0 is then determined by the element 0.(gb) of M(.). Conversely, if m E M(.), 
then it is easy to cheek that the equality 
defines a morphism 0 from b to M. 
This remark shows that for any G-set X 
?t(b, M)(X) = HOmMack(a)(b, Mx) ~- Mx(') ~- M(X) 
and it is easy to see that this isomorphism is actually bifunctorial in X, and so it is 
an isomorphism of Mackey functors from 7-g(b, M) to M. 
9 
Remark: The previous argument shows also that the isomorphism 0 : b@M ~ M is 
obtained in the following way: if X is a G-set, if (1/r 
is a G-set over X, if (Z, ~b) is 
a G-set over Y, viewed as an element of b(Y), and if m C M(Y), then 
Ox ([(Z, r | m](y,r

Chapter 3 
The category associated to a Green 
functor 
3.1 
Examples of modules over a Green functor 
Let A be a Green functor for the group G, and X be a G-set. If M is an A-module, then 
M is in particular a Mackey functor. I know then how to build the Mackey functor 
Mx, and I can try to turn it into a module over A: if Y and Z are G-sets, if a E A(Y) 
and rr, E Mx(Z) = M(ZX), then the product a • m is in M(YZX) ~_ Mx(YZ). I 
can view that product as a definition of an A-module structure for Mx: 
Lemma 3.1.1: Let A be a Green functor, let M be an A-module, and X be 
a G-set. If Y and Z are G-sets, the product 
A(Y) • Mx(Z) --+ Mx(Y • Z): 
(a,rn) ~-+ a • m 
turns Mx into an A-module. The construction M ~ Mx is an endofunctor 
from the category A-Mod of A-modules, which is its own left and right 
adjoint. 
Proof: The first assertion comes fi'om the f~ct that M is a module over the Green 
functor A. Moreover, the construction M ~+ Mx is clearly functorial in M. For the 
adjunction property, let N be an A-module, and 0 be a morphism of A-modules from 
Mx to N. Then for any G-set Y, I have a morphism 0r from Mx(Y) = M(YX) to 
N(Y). So I have a morphism 0yx from M(YX 2) to N(YX). I deduce a morphism 
0~ from M(Y) to N(YX) by setting for rn E M(Y) 
O'v(m) = Oyx M. \yzz 
Those definitions turn 0 ~ into a morphism of Mackey functors fi'om M to Nx: if 
f : Y --+ Z is a morphism of G-sets, then

A(Z x Y) = HomcA(Y, Z), then the composite morphism a' o a E HomcA(X, Z) 
is defined by 
a'oa = a'oy a 
This definition is made on purpose so that the following proposition holds: 
9 The objects of CA are the finite G-sets. 
Definition: 
Let A be a Green functor for the group G. I denote by CA the category 
defined as follows: 

68 
CHAPTER 3. THE CATEGORY ASS'OCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
Proposition 3.2.2: The category CA is an R-additive category, and the cor- 
respondence which maps a G-set X to the A-module Ax is a fully faithful 
contravariant functor from CA to A-Mod. 
Proof: First the category CA is a pre-additive category (or "Ab-category" in the sense 
of Mac Lane [10]), in that for any objects X and Y of CA, the set HomcA(X,Y) = 
A(Y • X) has a natural structure of abelian group, for which the composition product 
is biadditive, and even R-bilinear. Moreover, the category CA has a zero object, namely 
the empty set: for any G-set X, the product X • ~ is empty, and as A(0) = {0}, I 
have 
HomcA(r X) = HomcA(X, ~) = {0} 
The existence of biproducts in CA (in the sense of Mac Lane [10] VIII.2) will then 
follow from the axioms of Mackey functors, and from the following lemma: 
Lemma 3.2.3: Let f : X ~ Y be a morphism of G-sets. I set 
f.= A. 
f(x)x 
(c) E A(Y • X) 
( x )A I:I 
f*=A. 
xf(x) 
(r 
• 
I denote by L (resp. [*) the correspondence which maps a G-set X to the 
object X of CA, and the morphism f : X ~ Y in G-set to f. E HomcA(X, Y) 
(resp. to f* E HomcA(Y,X)). Then I. (resp. I*) is a covariant (resp. con- 
travariant) functor from G-set to CA. 
Admitting this lemma for a while, I see indeed that if ix and ir are the respective 
injections from X and Y to Z = XL[Y, then in CA, I have

from X to Y, and let 9 be a morphism from Y to Z. By definition of f., g. and their

morphism of Ax is mapped to the morphism h = c~(Id) from A to Ax 2 defined by 
hu = IduxA* ( UX ) A* (UXu ) = A* ( UX ) A* 
uxz 
And the rnorphism h corresponds in turn to the element h.(e) of A(X2). But 
proving that 1A(X2 ) is the identity morphism of X in CA.

3.3 
A-modules and representations of CA 
Definition: If R is a commutative ring, and C is an R-additive category, a represen- 
tation of C over R is an R-additive functor from C to R-Mod. If F and F' are two 
representations of C, a morphism from F to F' is a morphism of functors from F to 
F'. I denote by Functn(C) the category of representations of C over R. 
Let M be an A-module. By composition of the contravariant functor Homn-Mod(--, M) 
with the additive contravariant functor X ~-* Ax from CA to A-Mod, I obtain a rep- 
resentation FM of C,; over R, defined for a G set X by 
FM(X) = HOmcA(AX, M) 
But I have seen (see prop 3.1.3) that if M is an A-module, then HomA(Ax, M) 
identifies with M(X): a morphism f from Ax to M is determined by the element 
of M(X): if U is a G-set, and ifa E Ax(U) = A(UX), then 
fg(a)=M. (7)M*(uz) 
m) 
(3.1) 
Then if X and Y are G-sets, and if r C A(Y x X) is a morphism in CA from X to 
Y, it is associated by proposition 3.t.3 to a morphism ~b from Ar to Ax defined for 
a r A(U x Y) = Ay(U) by 
eu(a) = Ax,. 
Ax 
uyy 
\ ux / 
kuyyx/ 

72 
CHAPTER 3. THE CATEGORY ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
Let m 6 M(X). 
It is associated to a morphism from Ax to M defined by equa 
tion (3.1). By composition with r 
I get a morphism fr from Ar to M, which is 
determined by the element 
and m' is also by definition the image of m under FM(~)). As ~bzA. (;) A* (.Y)(e)is 
the element determining the morphism r equation (3.1) gives 
This is the expression of the morphism FM(r 
: M(X) ~ M(Y), image of r under 
FM. 
The analogy of those formulae with the definition of the composition product ox 
in CA explains the following notation: 
Notation: Let A be a Green functor, and M be an A-module. lf X and Y are G-sets, 
if a G A(Y • X) and m E M(X), I set 
With this notation, I see that 
Fu(r 
: o ox 
and now say that FM is an R-additive functor is equivalent to say that this product 
ox is bilinear, associative and unitary (in an obvious sense). 
Remark: The previous notation is coherent with the initial one: if M is the functor 
Az, for a G-set Z, then for a E A(YX) and b E M(X) = A(XZ) I find 
aoxb=Az,. 
Az 
yxx 
<yz ) 
\yxxz/ 
and this coincides with the initial definition of the product a ex b 
Now to any A-module M, I have associated a representation FM of CA. This clearly 
defines a functor from A-Mod to Functn(CA): if f : M --~ N is a morphism of A- 
modules, composition with f induces a natural transformation from Homm-Mod(--, M) 
to HomA-Mog(--,N), and so a natural transformation from FM to FN. Conversely, 
let F be a representation of CA over R. If X is a G-set, I set 
ME(X) = F(X) 
It is an R-module. If f : X ~ Y is a morphism of G-sets, I set 
MF,.(f) = F(f.) 
M[:(f) = F(f.) 
Those definitions turn MF into a bifunctor over G-set, with values in R-Mod. More- 
over as F is additive, it follows that MF has property (Mt) of Mackey functors, i.e. 
that MF transforms disjoint unions into direct sums. The following lemma shows that 
My has also property (M2), hence that it is a Mackey functor:

Finally, I can turn MF into an A-module: is X and Y are G-sets, if a 6 A(X) 
and m E MF(Y) = F(Y), then the element A.(~)A*(~)(a) 
is in A(XY 2) = 
HorncA(Y, XY), and I can consider its image under F, which is a morphism from 
F(Y) to F(XY). Then I set

Lemma 3.3.2: Those definitions turn Mr into an A-module.

simplify the proofs, I will first check that in the case F = FN for an A-module N, 
then MF is equal to the A-module N. 
It is clear indeed that for any G-set X, I have

Lemma 3.3.3: Let A be a Green functor, and N be an A-module. If X and 
Y are G-sets, if a C A(X) and n C N(Y), then 
a x n = A. xyy 
I must now prove that the product I have defined on ME is bifunctoriah Let f : X ---* 
X' and g : Y ~ Y'bemorphismsofG-sets. 
Ira C A(X) andre E M(Y), then by 
definition of ME

So I have to show that if I set

= (f x g). oxy A. xyy 
then F(C)(m) = F(g?)(m) for any R-additive functor f on CA and any m E F(Y). 
This is equivalent to say that for any F, I have F(r 
= F(r 
and the following lemma 
proves that this is equivalent to say that r = r 
Lemma 3.3.4: Let X and Y be G-sets. Let r r ~ be distinct elements of 
A(YX) = Hornca(X,Y). Let F be the functor FAx. Then F(r 
r F(r 
Proof: Let F be the functor FAx. Let IA(X 2) C F(X). Then 
F(r 
= r 
1Ar 
= r r r = F(r 
and so F(r 
r F(~b). 
.. 
Now to prove that ME is covariant, I must prove that

(xY)A*(X:)(a)

\ x' ]A.(f)(a)oy, g.=r

but this equation is the case F = FAy,. And in that case, I have seen that ME = Ay,, 
and the product x on this functor is eovariant. It follows that the product x on ME 
is eovariant for any F. 

78 
CHAPTER 3. THE CATEGORY ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
Similarly, to prove that the product on MF is contravariant, I consider in the same 
conditions elements a' E A(Y') and m' E MF(Y') = F(Y'). I have to show that 
A*(f)(a') • MT~(g)(m') = M~(f • g)(a' • m') 
(3.2) 
The left hand side is equal to 
whereas the right hand side is 
(

.... F 
(f x g)* ox,y, d. \x'y'y']

The previous lemma now proves that equality (3.2) is a consequence of the following 
one 
A. 
zyy 
f(x) 
(a') oz, g* = (f • g)* ox,y, A. \x'y'y'] 
\ x' ] (a') 
which is the case F = FAy. As MFAy = Az, and as the product on Ay is bifunctorial, 
this equality holds, and the product on My is contravariant. 
Similarly, to check the associativity of the product on My, I consider three G-sets 
N, Y, Z, and elements a E A(X), b e A(Y), and m 9 ME(Z) = F(Z). Then 
.... F(A.(\xyzyz/XYZ I (xYZ)(a))F(A*(yYzZz)A*(Y;)(b)) (m) .... 
On the other hand

from equality

3.3. A-MODULES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF CA 
79 
which expresses associativity of the product on MFaz = Az. So the product on ME 
is associative. 
Now concerning unit, if X is a G-set, and if m E MF(X) = F(X), then 
and this completes the proof of lemma 3.3.2. 
The previous lemmas lead to the following theorem: 
Theorem 3.3.5: The constructions which to an A-module M associate the 
representation FM of CA, and to the representation F of CA associate the 
A-module ME are mutual inverse equivalences of categories from A-Mod to 
F~nctR(CA ). 
Proof: I have already proved that for any A-module N, the A-module MFN identifies 
with N. I need to prove that the construction E ~ ME is functorial in E, and that 
for any representation E of CA, the representation FME is naturally isomorphic to E. 
If 0 : E --+ E' is a morphism of representations of CA, i.e. a natural transformation 
of functors, then 0 is determined by giving, for any G-set X, a morphism of R-modules 
Ox from E(X) to E'(X). If Y is a G-set, and if a E A(YX) = HomcA(X,Y), then 
the square 
E(~) 
E(X) 
, E(Y) 
o,:[ 
l oy 
E'(X) 
E'(a) 
E'(Y) 
must be commutative. 
By definition, I have Mu(X) = E(X), and to prove that E ~ ME is functorial in 
E, I must check that the morphisms Ox define a morphisra of A-modules from ME to 
ME,. If f : X --+ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then the square 
Mg,.(f) = E(f.) 
ME(X) 
, 
ME(Y) 
i 
) 
ME,(X) Mz,,.(f) : E'(f.) ME,(Y) 
is the above square for a = f.. Similarly, if f' : Y --+ X is a morphism of G-sets, then 
M~(f') = E(f'*)

the square

CHAPTER 3. THE CATEGORY ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
is the same square for a = f'*. Hence the maps Ox induce a morphism of Mackey 
functors from ME to ME,. 
Moreover, for any G-set Y, for all a ~ A(Y) and all m E ME(X), I have 
so 0 is a morphism of A-modules. 
Finally, by definition, for any E and any X I have 
F.~(X) : M~(X): E(x)

4.1 
The evaluation functors 
Theorem 3.3.5 states an equivalence between A-modules and representations of CA, 
so it is possible to use the general results on representations of categories (see [3]). In 
particular 
Proposition 4.1.1: Let A be a Green functor. IfX is a G-set, the functor Ex 
of evaluation at X (defined by Ex(F) = F(X)) from FunctR(CA) to EndcA(X)- 
Mod has a left adjoint Lx,- : V H Lx,v defined by 
Lx,v(Y) = HomcA(X, Y) | 
= A(YX) | 
V 
If f E HomcA(Y, Z) = A(ZY), then the image under Lx,y(f) of the element 
a | v of Lx,v(Y) is equal to 
Lx,y(f)(a + v) : (f oy a) | v C Lx,v(Z) 
It follows that ExoLx,_ is the identity functor on A(X2)-Mod, which thereby 
may be identified to a full subcategory of A-Mod. 
Remark: There are two different products on A(X2): one is the product ".", the other 
is the product ox. The algebra structure on A(X 2) in the proposition corresponds of 
course to the second one. 
This adjunction provides in particular a co-unit r/x, which for any functor F on 
CA induces a morphism ~X,F : Lx,p(x) ~ F defined for a G-set Y by 
a | v E LX,F(x)(Y) ~ 7]X,Fy(a @ v) = F(a)(v) E F(Y) 
This defiIfition makes sense because if a C A(YX) = HorncA(X,Y), then F(a) is a 
morphism of R-modules from F(X) to F(Y), and so F(a)(v) E F(Y).

CHAPTER 4. THE ALGEBRA ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
4.2 
Evaluation and equivalence 
Now a natural question is to know if there are G-sets f~ such that Eo is an equivalence 
of categories between Functn(CA) and A(f~2)-Mod. To answer that question, I need 
the following definitions: 
Definitions: 
1) Let f~ be a G-set. If n is a non-negative integer, I denote by n~2 the 
G-set obtained by taking the disjoint union of n copies of f~, and I say that nf~ is a 
multiple of fL 
2) If X and Y are objects of CA, I say that X is a direct summand of Y in CA (or 
that X divides Y in CA) if there exists a split monomorphism from X to Y in CA, 
that is if there exists an element a E A(YX) and an element fl E A(XY) such that 
fl Oy Oe = 1A(X2 ). 
In particular, if i is an injective morphism from the G-set X into the G-set Y, then 
lemmas 3.2.3 and 3.3.1 show that i* or i. = IA(X2). Indeed the square 
Id 
X 
, X 
X 
, 
Y 
i 
is cartesian, and it follows that 
i* oy i. = Id. ox Id* = 1A(XZ ) o X 1A(X2 ) = 1A(X2 ) 
Thus injections in G-set are mapped by the functor I. to split monomorphisms. 
Proposition 4.2.1: Let A be a Green functor over R for the group G, and 
f~ be a G-set. The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The evaluation functor Ea from FunctR(CA) to A(g~e)-Mod is an equiv- 
alence of categories. 
2. For any G-set X, there exists an integer n such that X is a direct 
summand of nf~ in CA. 
Proof." If Ea is an equivalence of categories, then the inverse equivalence is equal 
to its adjoint La,-. 
I already know that E~ o La- is the identity functor. 
Now 
say that Ea is an equivalence of categories is equivalent to say that the co-unit qa 
is an isomorphism. This means that for any functor F, the morphism rTa,F is an 
isomorphism. In particular, if X is a G-set, and if F is the functor Fax associated by 
theorem 3.3.5 to the A-module Ax, then the morphism 
is an isomorphism. But Ax(X) = A(X 2) and 

4.2. EVALUATION AND EQUIVALENCE 
83 
so the morphism r/a,n x,x is deduced from the composition 
A(Xa) | A(f~X) ~ A(X 2) 
In particular, this morphism must be surjective, so there exists an integer n, and 
elements c~i r A(f~X) and/3i r A(Xf~), for 1 < i < n, such that 
}~'/3/oa c~ = 1A(X~) 
(4.1) 
i=1 
Now the sum of c~i's (resp. the sum of/3i's) is an element a of A((na)X) (resp. an 
element/? of A (X(na))), and equality (4.1) may be written 
/5 ona cz = 1A(X2 ) 
Thus X is a direct summand of nPt in CA. 
Conversely, if hypothesis 2 of the proposition holds, and if X is a G-set, then 
there exists an integer n and elements c, r A((nf~)X), and /5 E A(X(nft)) such 
that ~ ona a = 1A(X~). So there exists elements a/ E A(•X) and /~i E A(XF~), for 
1 < i < n, such that equality (4.1) holds. Then if F is a functor on CA, let 9 = r/n,F,X. 
I denote by O the morphism from F(X) to A(Xf~) | 
F(X) defined by 
n 
O(u) = ~/3/| 
F(cc;)(u) 
With those notations, I have 
Oe)(a | v) = 
/3/| F(ai)F(a)(v) = ~/3/| F(c~i o x a)(v) 
i=1 
i=1 
But v e f(a), and the action of element A 9 A(ft 2) on F(ft) is defined by ),.v = 
F()~)(v). As a/ox a is in A(a2), I have also 
r~ 
Oe#(a @ v) = E fl' @ (c~i ox a).v .... 
i=1 
.... 
/3ioa(oqoxa) 
| 
/3ioact/)oxa

i=1 
and this proves that @~ is the identity. 
Conversely

r 
= 
F(gdF(~d(~) 
= 
r(9/o~ ~/)(~) = r 
~, o~ ~/ 
(~) = 
/=1 
i=1 
Thus O and ~ are mutual inverse isomorphisms. 
As the G-set X was arbitrary, 
this proves that r/a is an isomorphism, and Ea is an equivalence of categories. This 
completes the proof of the proposition. 

84 
CHAPTER 4. THE ALGEBRA ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
4.3 
The algebra A(f  2) 
Condition 2 of proposition 4.2.1 holds in particular if I take for ft the disjoint union 
of G/H, for all subgroups H of G: indeed, if X is a G-set, let E a system of represen 
tatives of orbits G\X, viewed as a G-set with trivial C-action. Let i be the map from 
X to f~ x E defined as follows: if x E X, then there exists a unique xo in G.x N E, 
and an element g E G such that z = 9.zo. Then denoting by G~0 the stabilizer of x0, 
the class gG~.o Eft does not depend on the choice of g, and I set i(z) = (gG~:o, xo). 
The map i is injective: if i(x) = i(x'), then x0 = x; and gGxo = g'G,:' o, so {x} = 
gGxo.Xo = g'G~,o.x' o = {x'}. Moreover, it is a morphism of G-sets: it is clear that 
i(h.x) = (hgO~o, zo) = h.i(x). 
As G acts trivially on E, I see that ft • E _~ IElfl, and then any G-set is a subset of 
a disjoint union of copies of fL Hence, in CA, any G-set X is a direct summand of a 
multiple of ft. 
Those remarks show that the evaluation functor Ea is an equivalence of categories 
from Fune*R(CA) to A(fl2)-Mod. If M is an A-module, theorem 3.3.5 gives M(ft) 
an A(fl2)-module structure, defined for a E A(f~ 2) and m r M(fl) by 
\ 
Ca) 1 
J 
\O.)la,12~ 2 J 
Finally, I have proved the first assertion of the following theorem: 
Theorem 4.3.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. Let 
ft = 
II G/H 
HCG 
Then the functor which maps the A-module M to the A(ft2)-module M(ft) 
is an equivalence of categories from A-Mod to A(ft2)-Mod. 
The inverse equivalence maps the A(fl2)-module V to the A-module Lv 
defined by 
Lv(X) = A(Xft) | 
V 
If f : X ---* Y is a morphism of G-sets, if a C A(Xft), b ff A(Yf~), then 
Lv,.(f)(a@v)=(f. oxa)@v=A, f(x)w (a)| 
| 
(S" ox b/| 
v : A" 
Finally, if Z is a G-set, and if c r A(Z), then 
Proof: To complete the proof, is suffices to keep track of identifications of theorem 
3.3.5, which prove that 
Lv,.(f)(a • v) = (f, ox a) | v 
L~(f)(b • v) = (f* ox b) | v 

4.4. PRESENTATION BY GENERATORS AND RELATIONS 
85 
But I have seen that for any A-module M and any m E M(X) I have 
f. ox m = M.(f)(m) 
It suffices now to take M = Aa to conclude that 
f. ox a = Aa,.(f)(a) = A. 
f(z)w 
and a similar argument proves the corresponding equality for f*. 
Finally, theorem 3.3.5 shows that

Presentation by generators and relations 
Theorem 4.3.1 shows that the category A-Mod of modules over the Green functor 
A is equivalent to the category of modules over the algebra A(f~2). The following 
proposition, where et,- = A* (g[~) (e) denotes the unit of A(K) = A(G/K), gives the 
structure of this algebra: 
Proposition 4.4.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G, and let #(A)

9 The generators of #(A) are: 
The elementst H and

The elements Cx,H for x E G and H C_ G.

Vz E G, Va E A(H), VH C_ G 
(t2) 
Then the algebra A(f~ 2) is isomorphic to fz(A). 
Proof." First it is clear that any non-zero product of generators of #(A) involving 
U 
W 
only the generators r H, t H, and C~,H can be put in the form tv%,vrvg , for suitable 
subgroups U, V and W of G and an element g E G: relations (4) and (6) allow to 
H 
put the generators t H on the left and the generators r~,- on the right, and relation (1) 
allows to reduce the products of tH's and the products of rH's. On the other hand, 
H 
, 
H' 
the product rK/~H ,a is zero if 
# H: indeed r H = rKrHH 
H by relation (1) and 
g t 
AH,,a = lH,,etfjAU,,a = tu, AH,,a 
by relations (7) and (8), and H§ 
H'. 
rH~ H, = 0 if H ~ 
Then 
H 
H H~Hr~ 
rKAH,,a : rKrH~H,AH, a = 0 
Now relation (9) allows to put the H, 
r K s on the right of the AH,='s. Similarly, the 
product C,,HAU,,~ is zero if H' # H, since Cx,H = C~,HCl,H = C~,Ht H by relations 
(2) and (3). Now relation (12) allows to put the Cx,H'S on the right of the AHffS. 
Hence any non-zero product of generators of #(A) obtained by multiplying a product 
of generators r H, t~, and C~,H on the right by a generator AH,= can be put in the 
following form 
for suitable subgroups U, V, W and an element g of G, and an element a of A(V). 
Now I claim that those elements generate #(A) as an R-module: to see this, 
it suffices to check that the R-submodule M of #(A) they generate contains the 
generators of #(A), and is closed 2or the product. But

So it remains to check that M closed for the product. First I observe that setting 
V 
relations (2) and (3) show that g ~ % is a morphism from G to the group of invertible 
elements of #(A), i.e. that #(A) is an interior a-algebra (in Puig's sense [11]). With 
this notation, I have the following relations: 
cg~H

cgr K = rgKcg 
CgAH,a = "kgH,gaCg

~3U, W,g,b 
U

where U and W are subgroups of G and g is an element of G, and b an element of 
A(U N gW). 
Now let P be the product 
P

fiS,T,x,a~U,V,y,b 
for subgroups S, T, U, V and elements x and y of G, and elements a E A(S N ~T) 
and b E A(U N VT). 
This product can also be written as

In order to build a morphism from #(A) to A(Ft~), and to prove that it is a 
morphism of algebras, I must state precisely the above isomorphism (I). If H and K

~/S,T .... = Cs,x,T(a) = A.(is,~,T)(a) 
It is an element of A(Ct2). Let Q be the product

(7) and (8) show that the map b E A(U N gW) H /3u, w,g,b e #(A) is R-linear, and 
induces a surjective morphism of R-modules

But equality gzT = hU implies T = U. Hence if T # U, the set Z is empty, and Q

induces ~ surjective algebra homomorphism from A(f~ 2) to #(A). Moreover, it is easy 
to see that the identification relations

analogous to relations (N) hold: indeed, if a~ denotes the map

So is,~=t,TC~ = iS,~,T, and taking image under A. gives relation (N').

CHAPTER 4. THE ALGEBRA ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
4.5 
Examples 
4.5.1 
The Mackey algebra 
In the case when A is the Burnside functor b. then the algebra b(f~ 2) is isomorphic 
to the Mackey algebra #(G): the relations of Mackey algebra hold in b(f~2), so there 
is a natural morphism ~5 from #(G) to b(f~2), mapping the generators of the Mackey 
algebra to the generators of b(f~ 2) having the same name. 
Conversely, there is a 
morphism O from b(f~ e) to #(G) defined by 
G 
o(t~) = t?, o(~f) = ~,, Otc~,) = c~, 
The image of -~u,~ for a E b(H) is defined by linearity from 
O(Ai~,u/r~) 
. H 
= tKr K 
This definition is made in order to satisfy relation (12): indeed, as H/K = tH(K/K) 
in b(H), I have the following equality in b(~ 2) 
H 
H 
.H-K 
H 
H H 
~H,H/K = ~H,tH(el() = th'AK,s~crK = ~h'~KFK = tKrK 
It is not difficult then to check relations (7) to (12). So it is clear that ~ and O are 
mutual inverse algebra isomorphisms. 
Proposition 4.5.1: The algebra b(fi 2) is isomorphic to the Maekey algebra. 
Remarks: 1) The identification of b(X) given in propositions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 is a 
way to recover the construction of Lindner ([9]) (see also the article of Th~venaz and 
Webb [15]): if X and Y are G-sets, then an element of b(XY) is the difference of 
two G-sets over XY. Now a G-set V over XY is determined by a morphism f from 
V toX and amorphismg from V toY. 
IfWis the G-set over YZassociated to 
the morphism h : W + Y and to the morphism k : W + Z, then by definition of 
composition in Cb, I have 
,, xz / 
\xyyz/ 
where V • W is the product V and W, viewed as a G-set over XY2Z by the mor- 
phism l(v,w) = (f(v),g(v),h(w),k(w)). 
Proposition 2.4.2 says how to compute 
~Y~ 
W): I must fill the cartesian square 
b* (~yyz) (V • 
F 
U 
, 
VxW 
) 
I 
\ xyyz / 
Now U clearly identifies with the pull-back 
u = {(v,w) c v • w t9(,) = h(w)} 

4.5. EXAMPLES

with moreover r(v, w) = (f(v), g(v), h(w)) and s(v, w) = (v, w) E V x W. With those 
identifications 
/ 
\ 
b" ( 
)(v x w)--(u,r) 
\xyyz/ 
and proposition 2.4.2 now gives 
\ xz / 
\xyyz/ 
\ yz / 
In other words, the product V or W is obtained from the diagram 
X 
Y 
Z 
where the top square is cartesian. 
2) An easy counting argument on the ranks over R in the isomorphism 
#(G) ~- b(fl 2) ~- 
@ 
b(H N XK) 
H,KCG 
~:eH\5/K 
shows that the elements tilL CxrL~K, for H and K subgroups of G, for x E H\G/K, and 
L subgroup of H fl XK up to conjugation by H N XK (i.e. for a well defined element 
(H N xK)/L of b(H N ~L)), are a basis over R of the Mackey algebra: it is proposition 
(3.2) of Th~venaz and Webb ([15]). 
4.5.2 
The Yoshida algebra 
The second example of an algebra A(Ft 2) is the case when A is the fixed points functor 
FPn (see [14]), defined as follows: for any subgroup H of G, the module FPn(H) 
H 
is equal to R. The restriction maps r K are all identity, and the transfers t~ are 
multiplication by [H : K]. It follows that denoting by [X] the permutation R-module 
associated to the G-set X, I have for any G-set X 
FPR(X) = ItomG([X], R) 
If f: X ~ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then If] is a morphism fi'om IX] in [Y], giving 
by composition the map 
FP~(f) : FPn(Y) ~ FPn(X) 
The map FPR,.(f) is defined by identifying X to a basis of IX] and Y to a basis of 
[Y], and setting for r E FPn(X) = Homa([X], R) and y E Y 
FPn,,(f)(r 
~_, 
r 
~e./-~(~) 

96 
CHAPTER 4. THE ALGEBRA ASSOCIATED TO A GREEN FUNCTOR 
The Green functor structure of FPR is obvious: if ~ E FPR(X) -- Home(IX], R) and 
if ~ E FPa(Y) = Homa([Y],R), then r x ,~ is the element of Homa([X • Y],R) 
defined by 
If X and Y are G-sets, the module FPp(YX) identifies with the G-homomorphisms 
from IX] to [Y] by the map sending r E Homa([YX], R) to the map 
yE}" 
In other words, the element r is determined by its matrix @(y,.r))~ez.~ex, which 
must be G-invariant (i.e. such that r 
= r 
for all 9 E G, y E Y and 
xcX). 
If Z is another G-set, and if 15 E FPR(ZY), then the composite 15 OF r is defined 
by 
(?5 
t 
\zyyx/ 
Here r x r is the morphism from [ZY2X] to R defined by 
so A* ( ~Y~ "} (15 x 6) is the morphism from [ZYX] to R defined bv 
\ zyyx ] 
A" zyyx (15 •162 
~(z,y)r 
Finally, the element 15 OF r of FPR(ZX) is defined by 
(z,~,,~-)e( 72)-' (~,~) 
~,eY 
so the product OF corresponds to the matrix product. It. follows that for any X, the 
algebra A(X 2) is the algebra of endomorphisms of the RG-module [X]. In particular 
Proposition 4.5.2: If A = FPm then the algebra A(~ 2) is the Heeke algebra 
This algebra was defined by Yoshida in [17]. The modules over FPR are the cohomo- 
logical Mackey functors (see [15] prop. 16.3), i.e. the Mackey functors such that 
H H 
t(]m 
tA-rr~.(m) = [H: 
for any K C_ H and any m E M(H). 
It is also clear that the functor X ~ IX] is an equivalence of categories from CFpR 
on the full subcategory of the category of RG-modules formed by finitely generated 
permutation modules: this functor is indeed fully faithful by definition of CFpp, and 

4.5. EXAMPLES 
97 
essentially surjective, since any finitely generated permutation module is the module 
associated to a (finite) G-set. Theorem 3.3.5 now says that cohomologicM Mackey 
functors are exactly the additive functors on that category: this is a theorem of 
Yoshida ([17]). 
The functor FPR is also the functor H~ -, R) = Extra(R, R). It is also ~ subfunc 
tot of the Green functor He( -, R) = | 
-, R) (the standard notation is g*(-, R), 
but I prefer not to use it here). A similar argument proves the 
Proposition 4.5.3: If A is the funetor He(-,R) 
= ~iH~(-,R), then 

Chapter 5 
Morita equivalence 
projectivity 
and relative 
By its very definition, the algebra A(fF) is only defined up to Morita equivalence: it 
has indeed been chosen so that the category A(f~2)-Mod is equivalent to A-Mod. A 
natural question is then to know if it is possible to replace f~ by another G-set. 
5.1 
Morita equivalence of algebras A(X 2) 
The next proposition gives a way to know if the algebras A(X 2) and A(Y 2) are 
Morita-equivalent: 
Proposition 5.1.1: Let A be a Green functor for G, and let X and Y be 
G-sets. Then A(YX)= HomcA(X,Y) is an A(Y2)-module-A(X2), and A(XY) 
is an A(X2)-module-A(Y2). The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The bimodules A(YX) and A(XY) induce mutual inverse Morita 
equivalences between A(X 2) and A(Y2). 
2. There exists integers n and m such that X divides nY and Y divides 
mX in CA. 
Proof: First it is clear that composition induces bimodule morphisms 
~: A(XY) | 
A(YX) ~ A(X2): a | 
~ a oy/~ 
and 
@ : A(YX) | 
A(XY) ~ A(Y2): fl| a ~/3ox a 
Those morpbisms are balanced in the sense of Curtis-Reiner ([4]): as composition is 
associative, I have 
and similarly 
0(9 | ~) oy 9' = 9 ox ~(a | 9') = ~ ox ~ or ~' 

100 CHAPTER 5. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
They form a Morita context (see [4] (3..54)). As the image of ~ (resp. O) is a sub- 
bimodule of the corresponding algebra, i.e. a two sided ideal, the map ~ (resp. O) is 
surjective if and only if its image contains the unit. Thus 9 and O are surjective if 
and only if there exists elements c~i E A(XY) and /3i E A(YX), for 1 < i < n such 
that 
~c~ oz/3~ = 1A(X 2) 
i=1 
and elements/~} C A(YX) and c~} E A(XY) for 1 _< j _< m such that 
,rt~ 
! 
j=l 
The first equality means precisely that X divides nY in CA, and the second that Y 
divides rnX, and the proposition follows. 
9 
Definition: Let X and Y be G-sets. I will say that X and Y have the same stabilizers 
if 
VHC_G, 3xEX, G~=H 
~ 
ByEK Gy=H 
This is equivalent to say that if 
X ~_ II nH(G/H) 
V ~_ II mH(G/H) 
HCG 
HCG 
thennH ~ Oifand only ifmH ~ O. Now ifmis an integer greater or equal to all 
quotients mH/nu (for nH ~ 0), I have ranH >_ rail, and Y is isomorphic to a sub-G- 
set of reX. Now by lemma 3.2.3, the set Y divides mX in CA. Similarly, if n is an 
integer greater or equal to all nH/mH (for mH :fi 0), then X divides nY in CA. Thus 
Proposition 5.1.2: If X and Y are G-sets having the same stabilizers, then 
A(X 2) and A(Y 2) are Morita-equivalent. 
5.2 
Relative projectivity 
Let X be a candidate G-set to replace ~. Then in particular, there must exist an 
integer n such that 9 divides nX in CA. The next proposition describes this situation: 
Proposition 5.2.1: Let A be a Green functor for G, and let X be a G-set. 
The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. There exists an integer n such that 9 divides nX in CA. 
2. The set 9 divides X in CA. 
3. The map A, (:) is surjective. 
4. The image of the map A, (~) contains C. 
Poof: The proof of this proposition uses the next lemma: 

5.2. RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
101 
Lemma 5.2.2: Let A be a Green functor for G, and let f : X -~ Y be a 
morphism of G-sets. Then A*(f) is a morphism of rings (with unit) from 
(A(Y), .) to (A(X), .), and the image of A(X) under A.(f) is a two-sided ideal 
] 
% 
of (A(Y), .). 
Proof: The product "." can be recovered from the product x by the formula 
a'b= A* ( X ) (a • 
for a, b E A(X). Now for a, b E A(Y), I have 
xx 
f(x) 
(a)• 
f(x)

xlx2 
~(axb)=A'( 
x 
) (a• 
.... 
xx 
\f(zl)f(x2)] 
f(x)f(x) 
and the first assertion follows, since moreover 
Remark: It is actually a reformulation of assertion iii) of proposition 1.8.3. 
For the second assertion, if a C A(X) and b E A(Y), then 
(x)

As the square

b.A.(f)(a) = A.(f)d* 
f(x)x 
A similar argument shows that 
A*(f)(a)'b= A*(f)A* ( 
xxf(x)) (a x b) 

102 CHAPTER 5. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
so the image of A.(f) is a two-sided ideal of A(Y). 
Proof of proposition 5.2.1: It is clear that 2) implies 1). Now if 1) holds, then 
there exists elements c~i E A(X.) = A(X) and fli E A(.X) = A(X), for 1 < i < n, 
such that 
n 
Y~ Bi ox c~i = 1~(.2)

But A(. 2) = A(.) and

p~ ox c~i = A.

(Bi • c~) = A.

This proves that 
e = A. 
Bi.c~i 
so 1) implies 4). 
By the previous lemma, the image of A. (~) is a two-sided ideal. So 4) implies 3). 
~inally if 3) holds, let ~ e A(X) such that A. (:) (.) = ~ I can view ~ as an element 
of A(X.) and ex as an element of A(.X). Then by the previous computation 
and this proves that 9 divides X in CA. 
9 
Definition: 
Let A be a Green functor for the group G. If X is a G-set having 
the equivMent properties of proposition 5.21, the functor A is said to be projective 
relative to X. 
This definition coincides with the usual one (see for example Webb [16]). In the 
case X = G/H, the map A. (~) is the transfer t~: A(H) --* A(G) = A(.), and this 
is the classical notion of relative H-projectivity. 
Proposition 5.2.3: Let A be a Green functor for G, and let X and Y be 
G-sets. 
1. If A is projective relative to X, and if HomG-set(X, Y) 7 L O, then A is 
projective relative to Y. 
2. The functor A is projective relative to X x Y if and only if it is 
projective relative to X and relative to Y. 
3. If A(.) has a unique maximal two-sided ideal (for instance if it is a 
local ring), then A is projective relative to X LI Y if and only if it is 
projective relative to X or relative to Y. 
In this case, if H is a minimal subgroup of G such that A is projective 
relative to G/H, then A is projective relative to X if and only if X H r O. 
In particular, the subgroup H is unique up to G-conjugation. 

5.3. CARTESIAN PRODUCT IN CA 
103 
Proof." 1) Let .f : X --+ Y be a morphism of G-sets. Assertion 1) follows from the 
equality 
2) If A is projective relative to X x Y, as there exists morphisms of G-sets fi'om X • Y 
to X and Y, assertion 1) implies that A is projective relative to X and relative to Y. 
Conversely, if A is projective relative to X and relative to Y, let c~ C A(X) and 
/3 E A(Y) such that 
Then 
A. 
and this proves that A is projective relative to X x Y. 
3) Let Z = X I_[ Y, and ix and iy the injections from X and Y into Z. It follows fi'om 
assertion 1) that if A is projective relative to X or relative to Y, then A is projective 
Conversely, as A(Z) = A.(ix)(A(X)) 9 A.(iy)(A(Y)), and as 
relative to Z. 
I see that if A is projective relative to Z, then 
Now A(Z) is the sum of two of its two-sided ideals. If A(e) has a unique maximal 
two-sided ideal, this forces one of them to be the whole of A(Z), thus A is projective 
relative to X or relative to Y. 
Let H be a minimal subgroup such that A is projective relative to G/H: such a 
subgroup certainly exists, since A is trivially projective relative to G/G = o. Since 
X g identifies with Homa_s~(G/H, X), it follows from assertion 1) that if X u ~ O, 
then A is projective relative to X. 
Conversely, if A is projective relative to X, it follows from assertion 2) that A is 
projective relative to (G/H) x X. Now the first part of assertion 3) shows that there 
exists x E X such that A is projective relative to (G/H) • (G/Gx). This product 
is isomorphic to the disjoint union of sets G/(H n eG,:) = G/(H N Gg,~), for suitable 
elements g E G. Then there exists g such that A is projective relative to G/(H N Gg,:), 
and now the minimality of H implies that H C_ Gg~, i.e. gx E X 14.

Cartesian product in CA 
5.3.1 
Definition 
Let A be a Green functor, and U be a G-set. On the category A-Mod, I have the 
functor M H Mu (see lemma 3.1.1). As 
(Ax)u(Z) = Ax(ZU) = A(ZUX) = Aux(Z) 

104 CHAPTER 5. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
it follows that (Ax)u ~- Aux, and that the above functor preserves the subcategory 
of A-Mod formed by the modules Ax. This subcategory is isomorphic to CA, so it 
is possible to define the functor X H UX on CA: 
Lemma 
5.3.1: The correspondence 
XHUX 
E HomcA(X, Y) ~ 1A((Uy)2) Ov ct = A. \uyux] 
\ yx 
is a functor 
U x - 
from CA to CA. 
Proof: It suffices to make the isomorphisms of proposition 3.1.3 explicit: an element 
c~ of A(YX) defines a morphism from Ay to Ax, the evaluation of which at a G-set 
Z is given by 
/3 E Ay(Z) = A(ZY) ~ /3 oy c~ 9 A(ZX) = Ax(Z) 
This morphism from Ay to Ax defines in turn a morphism from Auy = (Ay)u to 
Aux = (Ax)u, evaluating at Z as 
/3 C Auy(Z) = A(ZUY) ~ /3 oy c~ E A(ZUX) = Aux(Z) 
Now this morphism is determined by the image of the element 1A((Uy)2) E Auy(UY), 
i.e. by the dement 
1A((UyF ) Oy Ct 
of A(UYUX). Now it suffices to write 
1A((Uy)2)OyO~:A,(ttlYl"tt2Y2XlA.( ?.l, lYltl2y2x / [A, ( uy ) A.(7)(g) xoL 1

In other words, this lemma means that if X, Y and Z are G-sets, if a E A(YX) 
and fl E A( ZY), then 
This equality can he "proved" by the following argument: let 
As the product o is associative, I also have 
Observing now that 1A((Uy)2 ) is a unit for the product ovg, it follows that 
P = [1,4((UZ)2 ) o z ,8] Oy o~ 
and using again associativity of the product o, l get 
P = 1A((UZ) 2) ~ (80z c~) 
The only trouble with that argument is that I never proved that the product o is 
associative in those conditions. It is the reason for the following lemma 
Lemma 5.3.2: Let X, Y, Z, T and U be G-sets. Let a E A(XY), b r A(YUZ),

5.3.2 
Adjunction 
The previous lemma leads to a product on the right - • U: 
Proposition 5.3.3: Let A be a Green functor for G, and U be a G-set. The 
correspondence 
X~XU 
a r A(YX) H ce Ox 1A((XV)~) r A(YUXU) 
is a functor - x U from CA to CA, which is right adjoint to the functor U • -. 
Proofi Say that - x U is a functor is equivalent to say that if X, Y, and Z are 
G-sets, if a E A(YX) and/3 E A(ZY), then 
This follows from lemma 5.a.2 and from the fact that 1A((y~):) is a unit for the product 
oyu. It is clear moreover that 
1A(x=) • U = 1a(x:) Ox 1A((X~7)~) = 1A((XU)2) 
SO -- • U is a functor. 
To prove that this functor is right adjoint to the functor U x -, I observe that 
Homc,(X, YU) = A(YUX) = Homc,(UX, Y) 
and it suffices to check the functoriality of this equality with respect to X and Y. 
So let Z and T be G-sets, and f C A(XZ) and g E A(TY). I must check that the 
squares 
Hornca(X, YU) = A(YUX) 
1 
HomcA(Z, TU) = A(TUZ) 
Id 
Id 
A(YUX) = nom .(UX, Y) 
A(TUZ) = ttornc.(UZ, T) 
are commutative. That is for h E A(YUX), check that 
(g x U) oyu h ox f = g oy h oux (U x f) 
But 
(g x U)oyu hox f = (goy 1A((YU)2))Oyu ho X f = gog (1A((YU)2)Oyu hox f) = goy ( hox f) 
whereas 
goyhoux (U x f) = goy houx (1A((UX)=)Ox f) = (gOy houx la((ux):)) oxf) = (goy h)oxf 
Now equality follows from lemma 5.3.2. 
Remark: By a similar computation as in lemma 5.a.1, it is possible to show that if 
a C A(YX), then 
a • U = A. \yuxul

5.3.3 
Cartesian 
product 
in CA • CA 
In view of the previous paragraphs, one may try to define a cartesian product functor 
on CA • CA, mapping two G-sets X and Y to X • Y, and morphisms f C A(X'X) 
and g C A(Y'Y) to the morphism (denoted by ,f • g to avoid confusion) defined by 
f | 
= (f • Y') oxv, (X • g) E A(X'Y'XY) 
However, this definition is generally not functorial in X and Y: 
Proposition 5.3.5: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. The following 
conditions are equivalent: 

110 CHAPTER 5. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
1. The above definitions turn the cartesian product into a functor from 
CA X C A to CA. 
2. For any G-sets X and Y, and any c~ E A(X) and /3 E A(Y), 
/Txc~=A'('~:Y) 
(~ 
Remark: I will see later that this is equivalent to say that A is commutative (i.e. 
that for any G-set X, the ring (A(X), .) is commutative). 
Proof: Say that the cartesian product is functorial is equivalent to say that if f E 
A(X'X), if g E A(Y'Y), if f' E A(X"X') and g' E A(Y"Y') are morphisms in CA, 
then 
(f' | g') ox,y, (f | g) = (f' ox, f) Q (g' oy, g) 
The case f' = 1A(X a) and g = 1A(y2 ) now gives 
(X' • g') ox,y, (f x Y) = f @ g' = (f • Y') ~ 
(X • g') 
In other words, for any X, Y, X', Y', and any f E A(X'X), g C A(Y'Y), I must have

112 CHAPTEt~ 5. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
5.4 
Morita equivalence and relative projectivity 
The existence of a cartesian product functor in CA has the following consequence: 
Proposition 5.4.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G, and Y be 
G-set. Let 
: 
II G/H 
HCG 
The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The evaluation functor M ~ 
34(f~y) is an equivalence of categories 
from A-Mod to A(ft~,)-Mod. 
2. The functor A is projective relative to }'. 
Proof: If 2) holds, I know that 9 divides Y in CA. Taking images by the functor 
f~ • -, I see that f~ divides f~ • Y in CA. I also know that any G-set divides a multiple 
of f~ in CA. So any G-set divides a multiple of fl • Y in CA.. 
But if (w, ~1) C ft • Y, then its stabilizer G'(~,y) in G is contained in Gy, so yGt~,y) r 
0, and then G(~,y) is the stabilizer in G of the element G(~,y I of f~r-. Conversely, if H 
is a subgroup of G such that yH r ~, and if ~2 E yH, then H is the stabilizer of the 
element (H, y) of f~ • Y. It follows that [~ • Y and fir have the same stabilizers, so 
f~ • Y is a subset of a multiple of f~r, hence it divides a multiple of f~v in CA. 
Now any G-set divides a multiple of [Iv in CA, and proposition 4.2.1 shows that 
the evaluation functor M ~ M(f~r) is an equivalence of categories from A-Mod to 
A(f~})-Mod. 
Conversely, if this functor is an equivalence of categories, then any G-set divides a 
multiple of f~y in Ca. As Ftv and f~ • Y have the same stabilizers, any G-set divides a 
multiple of f~ • Y. In particular 9 divides such a multiple, and A is projective relative 
to Ft • Y. 
But as 9 ~_ G/G is a snbse~ of ft, it divides ft in CA, so A is projective relative to 
fL Now proposition 5.2.3.2) shows that A is projective relative to ft • Y if and only 
if it is projective relative to Y, and this completes the proof of the proposition. 
.. 
Remark: There is a natural inclusion i from f~v into ft, so an inclusion f = A.(i x i) 
from A(~) 
to A(fF). If x E G, then x defines an endomorphism as of the G-set ft 
by 
a~(g.H) = gHx --1 = gx-l.XH 
and this endomorphism stabilizes ftr (as a set). Now the map x ~ 
(ax). turn the 
algebras A(f~ 2) and A(ft}) into interior G-algebras, and f is compatible with those 
structures. The following lemma shows that f is actually an embedding of interior 
algebras (see Puig [11]): 
Lemma 5,4.2: Let i be an injective morphism of G-sets from X to Y. Then 
A.(i • i) is an embedding from A(X 2) into A(Y2). 

5.4. MORITA EQUIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
113 
Proof: If i is an injective morphism from X to Y, then i. is a split monomorphism 
from X to Y in CA, since i s o i. = 1A(X2). Then it is clear that the map 
f E A(X 2) = Endc~(X) H i. o f o i* E A(Y 2) = EndcA(Y) 
is an embedding of algebras. So to prove the lemma, it suffices to prove that for any 
f E A(X 2)

so the algebra d(ft~.) is a kind of "source algebra" of d(fF) (cf [11]). The next 
section is a refinement of this analogy. 
5.5 
Progenerators 
5.5.1 
Finitely generated modules 
Proposition 4.2.1 provides a way to define the notion of a finitely generated module 
over a Green functor A: an A-module M is t~nitely generated (oi" of/inite type) if 
M(Y~) is a finitely generated A(fi2)-module. This notion depends only on the category 
A-Mod, by the following argument (Benson): a module M is finitely generated if and 
only for any set I, the map 
(~i)iEI e O HomA(M, M) ~ | 
9 Homa(M, (~ M) 
I 
I 
is an isomorphism. 
The following lemma shows that this definition actually does not depend on f~: 
Lemma 5.5.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G, and M be an 
A-module. The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The module M(f~) is a finitely generated A(fF)-module. 

5.5. PROGENERATORS 
115 
2. There exist a (finite) G-set X such that M is a quotient of Ax. 
Remark: The word "finite" is unnecessary, since the module Ax is not defined for 
an infinite X. 
Proof: Suppose 1) holds. It means that M(f~) is a quotient of a direct sum of a 
finite number of copies of A(fl2). Taking inverse images under the equivalence of 
proposition 4.2.1 shows that M is a quotient of a direct sum of a finite number, say 
n, of copies of Aa. As nAa ~- Ann, condition 2) holds for X = nfk 
Conversely, if 2) holds, then as X divides a multiple nf~ of fl in CA, the module Ax 
is a direct summand of A~a -~ nAa. Now M(f~) is a quotient of nAa(f~) = nA(f~2), 
so 1) holds. 
9 
5.5.2 
Idempotents 
and progenerators 
Let A be a Green functor for the group G. By definition, an A-module P will be called 
a progenerator (of A-Mod) if it is projective, of finite type, and if any A-module M 
is a quotient of a direct sum of copies of P. Proposition 4.3.1 shows that this is 
equivalent to say that P(f~) is a progenerator of A(Ft2)-Mod. 
Since Aa(fl) = A(ft 2) is a free module over A(fF), it follows that Aa is a pro- 
generator. More generally, proposition 3.1.3 shows that if Y is a G-set, then Av is 
a projective A-module, and proposition 4.2.1 shows that Av is a progenerator if and 
only if any G-set X divides a multiple of Y in CA. A natural question is now to know 
if any direct summands of Av are also progenerators. 
As the algebra of endomorphisms of Av is A(Y2), it is equivalent to consider 
idempotents of this algebra. I will use the following notation: 
Notation: 
If j is an idempotent of A(Y2), I will denote by Av.j the associated 
direct summand of Av. 
By definition, if X is a G-set, then 
(Ay j)(x) = A(XY) o~ j 
This is the set of morphisms (in CA) from Y to X which factor through j. The module 
Av.j is projective, and for any A-module M, I have 
HomcA(dv.j, M) ~- jov M(Y) 
The question is now to find couples (Y,j) such that Av.j is a progenerator. 
Proposition 5.5.2: Let A be a Green functor for G. Let Y be a G-set, and 
j be an idempotent of A(Y~). The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The module Ay.j is a progenerator. 
2. Any G-set X divides a multiple of Y in CA, and the two-sided ideal 
of A(Y 2) generated by j is equal to A(Y~). 

116 CHAPTER 5. MORITA EQ UIVALENCE AND RELATIVE PROJECTIVITY 
Proof: If Ay.j is a progenerator, as it is a direct summand of Ay, the module A},- 
is also a progenerator. 
Now by proposition 4.2.1, any X divides a multiple of Y. 
Moreover, the module Ay is a quotient of a direct sum of copies of Ay.j, so it is a 
direct summand, which means that the composition morphism 
is surjective. As the image of this morphism is A(Y:) oy j OF A(Y:), it follows that 
the two-sided ideal of A(Y:) generated by j is the whole of A(Y;). 
Conversely, if 2) holds, then Ay is a progenerator (proposition 4.2.1), and equality 
A(Y 2) oz j oz A(Y 2) = A(Y ~) 
proves that Ay is a direct summand of a sum of copies of Ay.j. So Az.j is a progen- 
erator, and this completes the proof of the proposition.

Notation: If X is a G-set, and ira E A(X), I will set

If Y is a G-set, and if j is an idempotent of (A(Y),.), then j is an idempotent of

idempotent of A(H), I denote by J = A*(~r)(j) the associated idempotent of 
A(ft}). Then: 
1. If e C t~(A(H).j.A(H)), then Aau.J is a progenerator. 
2. If A(.) has a unique maximal two-sided ideal, if H is minimal such 
that A is projective relative to G/H, and if Aau.J is a progenerator, 
then e 6 tau(A(H).j.A(H)).

But the images t~(A(U).r~(j).A(U)) are two-sided ideals of A(G) = A(.). If A(.)

If Rosenberg's lemma holds in A(H) (for instance if R is a complete local noctherian 
ring, and if A(H) is of finite type over R), and ifj is primitive, then this condition en- 
tirely determines j up to conjugation by an invertible element of A(H) (the argument 
of Puig in [11] can be applied here without change). 

Chapter 6 
Construction of Green functors 
6.1 
The functors 
:H(M,M) 
If M is a Mackey functor, I know that ?f(M,M) is a Green functor. To describe 
its product x, I observe that the identity morphism from H(M,M) to itself must 
turn M into an ~(M, M)-module. Let X and Y be a-sets. If f E 7-i(M,M)(X) = 
HomM~k(a)(M, Mx), and if m E M(Y), I must find an element f • m of M(X x Y). 
But f is determined by morphisms 
fz : M(Z) ~ Mx(Z) = M(ZX) 
In particular, I have the element fz(m)in M(Y • X), so the clemcnt M. (~) (fz(rn)) 
in M(XY). This is the elcment I am looking for: 
Proposition 6.1.1: Let M be a Mackey functor, and let X and Y be G- 
sets. 
The Green functor structure of ~(M,M) and the ?/(M,M)-module 
structure of M are given by the following products: 
9 If f E H(M,M)(X) and g E 7-/(M,M)(Y), then f • g is the morphism 
from M to Mzz defined for a G-set Z and rn E M(Z) by 
(f • g)~(.~) = M. ~xy 
9 If f E %I(M,M)(X) = HomMa~k(G)(M, Mx) and m E M(Y), then f • m is 
the element of M(XY) defined by 
= 
o fy(~) 
f• 
M. 
xy 
In particular, if moreover M is an A-module for the Green functor A, then 
the image of the element a E A(X) under the morphism from A to 7/(M, M) 
is the morphism from M to Mx defined by 
yx) (a • m) 
m E M(Y) H M. 
xy 

124 
CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
Proof: Let A be a Green functor, and let M be an A-module. In the case when 
X = G/H and Y = G/K for subgroups H and K of G, I know that the product of 
a E A(X) and m E M(Y) is the element of M(G/H • G/K) defined by 
/.H 
?~K 
x 
a x ~

.o.,.(a)..n~,-('~) 
xEH\G/K 
up to identification of G/H x G/K with I-[zEH\G/K G/(H N ::K) by the inverse of the 
map g.(H M ::K) H (gH, gxK). 
On the other hand, the element a defines an endomorphism r of ReSaH M by 
mE M(L) Hr 
for 
L_CH 
By adjunction, this element defines a morphism from M to MG/H = Ind~Res~M 
given by

xEH\G/K 
up to identification of G/K x G/H with LIxEH\~/K G/(H N ~K) by the inverse of the 
map g.(H M = K) ~ (gxK, gH). 
It follows that a does map to the morphism from M to Mx defined by 
mEM(Y) HM*(xY)

In the case d = ~(M, M), this formula gives for f E ~(M, M)(X) and m E M(Y)

6.1.1 
The product 5 
The previous proposition leads to the following definition: 
Definition: Let M, N and P be Mackey fimctors. If X and Y are G-sets, if a C 
7-I( M, N ) ( X ) and b r 7-L( N, P ) ( Y ), I denote by b 5 a the element of ~( M, P ) ( Y x X) 
defined on a G-set U by 
(b ha)u : P. (uxy I obuxoau : M(U) ~ M(UYX): 
Mzx(U) 
\uyx/ 
Actually, I will only know that b 5 a is in ~(M, P)(YX) after proving the next 
proposition: 
Proposition 6.1.2: The product 5 defines a bilinear morphism from ~(N, P), 
?/(M, N) to 7{(M, P), which is moreover associative. 
Proof: First it is clear that b 6 a is a morphism of Mackey functors from M to 
Pzx: indeed, if f : U --+ V is a morphism of G-sets, then the following diagram is 
commutative: 
au 
bv x

The two squares on the left are commutative because a and b are morphisms of 
Mackey functors. The right square is commutative because its the image by P. of a 
commutative square. It follows that the products along the edges are equal, so 
Pzx,.(f) o (b 5 a)u = (b 5 a)v o M.(f)

The squares (1) and (5) are commutative by definition of ?-t,(a) and of K~,(/3). The 
square (2) is commutative because b is a morphism of Mackey functors from N to PY. 
The squares (3) and (6) are commutative because they are the image under P. of a 
commutative square. Finally the square (4) is trivially commutative. 
The two possible products from M(U) to P(UY'X') along the edges of that dia- 
gram give the equality 
~(N, P),(9)(b) 5 ~(M, N).(~)(a) = ~(M, P),(/3 • ~)(b 5 a)

shows that the product 5 is contravariant, hence that if defines a bilinear morphism 
from ~(N, P), 7-{(M, N) to 7-t(M, P). 
I must still show that the product 5 is associative: so let Q be a Mackey functor, 
let Z be a G-set, and let c be an element of 7-(.(P, Q)(Z). Then

The opposite functor of a Green functor 
Definition: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. I calI opposite [unctor of A, 
and I denote by A ~ the Green functor equal to A as Mackey functor, and endowed

Remark: It follows that condition 2) of proposition 5.3.5 is equivalent to the com- 
mutativity of all the rings (A(X), .), or to the commutativity of all the rings A(H), 
for H a_ G. 
6.2.1 
Right modules 
Definition: Let A be a Green functor for G. A right module M for A, or module-A, 
is a Mackey functor for G, together with bilinear maps 
M(X) x A(Y) -4 M(X x Y) 
denoted by (m, a) ,-~ ra x a for any G-sets X and Y, which are bifunctorial, associative, 
and unitary (in the obvious sense). 
A morphism 0 of modnles-A from M to N is a morphism of Mackey functors from M 
to N, such that for any G-sets X and Y, and any m E M(X) and a E A(X) 
O~x~(,~ • a) = 0~(,~) x a 
I can now speak of the category of modules-A, that I will denote by Mod-A. As in 
the case of ordinary rings: 
Proposition 6.2.2: The category Mod-A is equivalent to the category A ~ 
Mod.

by setting, for a C A(X) 
and m E M(Y)

x~j 
Now the proof of proposition 6.2.1 can be carried word for word here, to prove that 
this product is bifunctorial, associative and mfitary. 
Conversely, if M is art A~ 
I can turn it into a module-A by setting in the 
same conditions 
mxa=M*(xY) (ax~ 
It is clear that those correspondences are functorial, and inverse to each other. The 
proposition follows. 
6.2.2 
The dual of an A-module 
Definition: If M is an A-module, the dual of M is the Mackey functor M ~ defined 
on the G-set X by 
M~ 
= Hom,~ (M(X), R) 
If f : X ~ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then 
(M~ 
= tM*(f) 
(M~ 
= tM.(f) 
where tl is the transpose map of I. 
I define a right product on M ~ by setting, for G-sets X and }", for r C M~ 
for a e A(Y), and rn E M(X x Y) 
(r x a)(,~) = r

CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
6.3 
Tensor product of Green functors 
If A and B are Green functors for the group G, then their tensor product A@B can 
be given a structure of Green functor: 
Definition: 
If X and Y are G-sets, if ( U,r ) is a G-set over X and (V,r ) is a G-set 
over Y, ira E A(U), b E B(U), c E A(V) and d E B(V), I define the product of the 
dement [a @ b](u,r of A@B(X) by the dement [c | d](v,r of A@B(Y) by setting 
[a | b](u.r x [c | d](v.r = [(a x c) | (b x d)](vxv,r215162 
E (A+B)(X x Y) 
If CA and r 
are the units A and B, I set 
Proposition 6.3.1: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. Then 
the product x turns A@B into a Green functor, with unit e. 
Proof: First I must check that this product is well defined. So let f : (U, r ~ (U', r 
be a morphism of G-sets over X, let a E A(U) and b' E B(U'). Then 
. . . .  [(A.U x '<O/o x el)| Irx 
. . . .  
.... 
[(a x ~) | B'(f 
x id)(b' • ~)]~•162 
.... 
.... 
[(ax c)| 
(B'(f)(b') x d)](Uxy,r162 , 
which does coincide with the definition of 
[a | B*(f)(b')](u,<9 
x [c | d](v,r 
Similar arguments show that the product x on A@B is well defined. 
This product is moreover bifunctorial: if f : X --~ X' and g : Y --+ Y' are 
morphisms of G-sets, if u = [a | b](u,r is an element of A@B(X) and v = [c| d](v,r 
an element of A@B(Y), then 
( A@B ).(f)(u) x ( A@B).(g)(v) = [a|162 
[c| 
= [(a x c)| 
d)]wxV, lr 
) 
On the other hand 
(A@B).(f x g)(u x v) = [(a x c) @ (b X d)](uxv,(fxg)(r162 ) 
and equality fr x gr = (f x g)(r x ~) proves that the product is covariant. 
If now f is a morphism from X' to X and g is a morphism from Y' to Y, then to 
compute (A@B)*(f)(u) and (A@B)*(g)(v), I fill the cartesian squares 
c~

so that 
(A@B)*(f)(u) = [A*(c~)(a)@B*(c~)(b)](p,;) (A~B)*(g)(v) = [A*('7)(c)@B*(7)(d)](Q,~) 
The product (A@B)*(I)(u) x (A@B)*(g)(v)is then equal to 
which can also be written as 
[(A*(c~ x @(ax c))| 
(B*(a • 7)(bx d))J(pxQ,Zx5 ) 
As the square

• g)( x 
 )(ax c))| 
 )(bx 
) 
which proves that the product x on A@B is contravariant, hence bifunctoriah 
It is clear from the definitions that the product x is associative. Finally, the 
element c is a unit, since 
[a @ b](g,r • [CA | eB](o,Id) = [(a • CA) @ (b x eB)l(uxo,r 
= [a | b](g,r 
[CA @ eB](o,za) x [a | b](v,r = [(EA • a) | (eB • b)](.•162 
= [a | b](u,r 
and this completes the proof of the proposition. 
" 
The tensor product of Green functors is functoriah 
Lemma6.3.2: 
: If f : A ~ 
A' and g : B ~ 
B' are morphisms 
of Green 
funetors for the group G, then f@g : A@B ~ A@B ~ is a morphism of Green 
functors. If f and g are unitary, so is f@g. 
Proof: The morphism f (resp. the morphism g) is determined by morphisms fu (resp. 
gu) from A(U) to At(U) (resp. from B(U) to B'(U)), for any G-set U. Moreover, the 
image of the element [a | b](a,r of (A4B)(X) under (f@9)x is given by 
(f@g)x ([a | bl(u,r 
= [f~(a) | gu(b)l(u,r 
The lemma follows easily, since if f and g are morphisms of Green functors, then 
fu• 
• c) = fu(a) x fv(c) 
gu• 
• d) = gv(b) • gv(d) 

136 
CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
A special case of this lemma is the case when f is the identity morphism of A, and 
g is the unique (unitary) morphism of Green functors from b to B. since A@b ~- A, 
what I get is a unitary morphism ~A of Green functors from A to A@B, and it is easy 
to see that this morphism is given by 
a 9 A(X) ~ "TA,X(a) = In @ r 
a @ B* 
(r 
(X,Id) 
Similarly, there is a morphism ?B from B to A@B defined by 
bE 
A@B(X) 
(Xdd) 
The notion of opposite functor of a Green functor leads to the following definition: 
Definition: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. If X and Y are G-sets, I will 
say that the element a 9 A(X) commutes with/3 9 A(Y) ira x fl = a x ~ /3, i.e. 
a x/3=A, 
xy 
Similarly, I will say that a subset P C A(X) commutes with a subset Q c_ A(Y) if 
any element of Y commutes with any element of Q. If M is a sub-Mackey functor of 
A, and N a sub-Mackey functor of B, I will say that M commutes with N if M(X) 
commutes with N(Y) for any G-sets X and Y. 
It is clear that if a commutes with fl, then fl commutes with a, since taking the image 
of the above equality under A. (~) exchanges the roles of X and Y and of a and/3. 
I will also say that in a more symmetric way that a and/3 commute. 
Lemma 6.3.3: The image of 7A in A~B commutes with the image of "~B. 
Proofi Let X and Y be G-sets. If a 9 A(X) and b 9 B(Y), then 
7A,X(a) • 7B,g( b) = [a @ r 
x [C A,y @ 5](Y, Id) = [(a X ~ A,Y ) @ (CB,X X b)](XxY, id) 
Moreover 
aXCA,y=axA*(Y)(r 
I have eB,X x b= B* (~Y)(b). Then 
Similarly, 
~/A,X(a) X'TB,Y(b)= [A*(X;J)(a)|215

On the other hand 
"/By(b) • ~/A,X(a) ---- [gAy @ b](Y, Id) • [a @ gB,X](X,ld) = [(CA,y • a) | (b | s

The image under (A~B). (~;) of this element is

9 
This temma leads naturMIy to the universal property of the tensor product of 
Green functors: 
Proposition 6.3.4: Let A, B and C be Green functors for the group G. If 
f (resp. g) is a morphism of Green functors from A to C (resp. from B to 
C), and if the image of f commutes with the image of g, then there exists 
a unique morphism of Green functors h from AQB to C such that f = ho"/A 
andg=hoTB. 
Conversely, if h is a morphism of Green functors from A@B to C, then 
f = hOTA (resp. g= ho~B) is a morphism of Green functor from A to C 
(resp. from B to C), and the images of f and g commute. 
Moreover h is unitary if and only if f and g are. 
Proof: If (U,r 
is a G-set over X, if a E A(U) and b E B(U), then 
Moreover 
k Ul / 
\ 71"2 / 
(UxU, Id) 
The image of this element under (A@B)* (~\), which is the product 7A(a)."/B(b)in 
A@B(U), is obtained using the cartesian square 
U 
~ UxU 
U 
, UxU 

138 
CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
So it is equal to 
vA(a)."/B(b) = [A*( u)A* (ulu2~ (a)~) B* ( u ) B* (ulu~ (b)] 
= [a| 
zd) 
UU 
\ 
~t 1 / 
UU 
\ 
U2 
/ 
(U, Id) 
Now if h is a morphism of A~B to C, I have 
hx([a * b](u,r 
: C.(r 
* b](u, id)) = C.(r 
(uL ) hu• 
• VB(b)) 
Whence 
hx([a | b](u,r 
= C.(r 
(uL) "hu'TA(a) • huvB(b)) 
and h is determined by h o 7A and h o "~B. 
Then if f is a morphism from A to C and g is a morphism from B to C, there is 
at most one morphism h from A~B to C such that f = h o ~'A and g = h o 7B: the 
morphism h is given by 
hx([a|162 
= C.(r 
(uL) (fv(a) • gu(b)) 
Now proposition 1.8.3 shows that a morphism h from A~B to C is determined by the 
bilinear morphisms ]~u from A(U) • B(U) to C(U), defined for any G set U by 
(a,b) E A(U) x B(U) H C* ( uuu) hU([a| 
and h is a morphism of Mackey functors if and only if the morphisms ]~u satisfy 
conditions i), ii) and iii) of proposition 1.8.3. But here 
hu(a, b) = fu(a).gu(b) 
So let k : U' ---+ U be a morphism of G-sets, and let a E A(Y), b E B(Y), a' C A(U') 
and b' C B(U'). Condition i) can be written as 
]~u(A.(k)(a'),b) = C.(k)fu,(a',B*(k)(b)) 
or 
fvA.(k)(a').gu(b) 
= C.(k)(fu,(a').gu, B*(k)(b)) 
Since f is a morphism of Mackey functors, the left hand side is also equal to 
C.(k)fu,(a').gu(b) 
But the product "." on C is the map associated by the proposition 1.8.3 to the bilinear 
morphism from C, C to C defined by the product of C. So relation i) holds for this 
product, which gives 
C.(k)fv,(a').gu(b) 
= C.(k)(fv,(a').B*(k)gv(b)) 
and this proves that i) holds for h. A similar argument proves relation ii). Now 
relation iii) can be written as 
]~u, (A*(k)(a), B*(k)(b)) = C*(k)]tu(a, b) 

6.3. TENSOR PRODUCT OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
139 
which gives here 
fu, A*(k)(a).gu,B*(k)(b) = C*(k)(fu(a).gu(b)) 
The left hand side is also 
C*(k)fu(a).C*(k)gu(b) 
and since relation iii) holds for the product ".', I have 
C*(k)fv(a).V*(k)gu(b) = C*(k)(fu(a).gu(b)) 
(in other words, the maps C*(k) are ring homomorphisms for the product ".", which 
is also a consequence of lemma 5.2.2). Thus the maps ] satisfy i), ii), and iii), and 
it follows that h is a morphism of Mackey functors. 
To prove that h is a morphism of Green functors, I must check that 
The left hand side is 
hx• 
• c)| (bx d)](uxv,r162 = C.(r

x c).gu• 
x d)) 
(6.1) 
and the right hand side is 
C.(r 
x C.(r 
= C.(r x r 
x fy(c).gy(d)) 
(6.2) 
Equality of (6.1) and (6.2) for all r and r is equivalent to equality 
fv• 
• e)mv• 
• d) = fv(a)mv(b) • fv(c)mv(d) 
The left hand side is

.... C*(uuvvUV ) (fv(a)• gu(b)• fv(c)• gv(d)) 
(6.4) 
If the images of g and f commute, I have 
Then 
fu(a) x gu(b) • fv(c) • gv(d) -- C. (u,v~u2v2~ (fu(a) x fy(c) • gu(b) x gv(d))

But since 
C, (UlVlU2V2~ = C. (UlU2VlV2~

140 
CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
the right hand side of (6.4) is equal to 
C*( uv )~y,(?~lU,2ylv2~ (fu(a) • fv(c) xgu(D)).(gv(d) ) .... 
~ ?//O V 
\ ?~1 Vlt/21)2 / 
which is the right hand side of (6.3). Thus h is a morphism of Green functors. 
Conversely, if h is a morphism of Green functors from A@B to C, the images of 
f = h o 7A and 9 = h o 7B must commute: indeed, the images of 7A and 7B commute, 
and moreover, I have the following lemma 
Lemma 6.3.5: Let X and Y be G-sets, and 0 be a morphism of Green func- 
tors from D to C. 
If a E D(X) commutes with ~ C D(Y), then Ox(a) 
commutes with 0y(fl). 
Proof: It suffices to write 
yx) (~ • 9) .... 
0r(Z) x 0x(~) = 0yxx(Z x ~) = 0y• 
xy 
.... C, xy 
xy 
The lemma follows. 
9 
To complete the proof of the proposition, I must still observe that if f and g are 
unitary, then so is h: indeed, the unit of A~B is leA | eB](oJd), and its image under 
h is 
(') 
.. 
which is equal to the unit of C if f and g are unitary. Conversely, if h is unitary, then 
f = h o "/A and 9 = h o 7B are composition products of unitary morphisms, so they 
are unitary. 
9 
Proposition 6.3.6: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. Let M 
be an A-module and N be a B-module. Then M~N has a natural structure 
of AQB-module, defined as follows: if X and Y are G-sets, if (U, r is a G-set 
over X, and (V,r 
is a G-set over Y, if a E A(U), if b ~ B(U), if rn C M(V) 
and n C N(V), then 
[a | b](~,~) • [~ e ~](.,r 
= [(a x ~) | (b • ")](~xv,+• 
Proof: To prove that this product is well defined, associative, and unitary, one just 
has to mimic the proof of proposition 6.3.1, replacing A by M and B by N in suitable 
places.

6.4. BIMODULES 
141 
6.4 
Bimodules 
The notion of right-moduie over a Green functor leads naturally to the notion of 
bimodule: 
Definition: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. If M is an A-module, 
which is also a module-B, [ will say that M is an A-module-B if for any G-sets X, 
Y, and Z, and any elements a 9 A(X), m 9 M(Y) and b r B(Z), I have 
(a• 
xb=ax(m• 
in M(XxYxZ) 
A morphism of A-modules-B from M to N is a morphism of Mackey functors from 
M to N, which is also a morphism of A-modules and a morphism of modules-B. 
With those definitions, I can speak of the category of A-modules-B, that I will denote 
by A-Mod-B. 
Proposition 6.4.1: The category A-Mod-B is equivalent to the category 
A@B~ 
Proof: To give M a structure of AQB~ 
is equivalent (see proposition 2.1.2) to 
give ~ unitary morphism of Green functors fl'om AQB ~ to ~(M, M). By proposition 
6.3.4, this is equivalent to give unitary morphisms from A and B ~ to 7~(M,M), 
the images of which commute. In particular, the module M is an A-module, and a 
B~ 
i.e. a module-B. 
If X is a G-set, and if a E A(X), then a defines an element 
by 
Aa ~ HomM~k(G)(M, Mx)

If Z is a (;-set, and if b r B(Z), then b determines an element Pb of ~(M, M)(Z) = 
HomM~ck(a)(M, Mz), by 
mcM(Y)~-~Pb(m)=M*(zY) 
(b•176 
.... 
Now Aa and Pb commute if and only if 
Pb X Aa = ~(M'M)* (xz) (A~ • 
where the products x are in C = ~(M, M). But if a is an element of C(X), deter- 
mined by morphisms 
av : M(Y) ~ M(YX) = Mx(Y) 
and if/3 is an element of C(Z), determined by morphisms 
5y : M(Y) ~ M(YZ) = Mz(Y)

Proposition 6.4.2: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. If M is 
an A-module, and N a B-module, then the product 5 and the morphisms 
from A to H(M, M) and from B to H(N,N) induce a natural structure of 
B-module-A on ~(M, N). 
Proof." By proposition 2.1.2, to say that M is an A-module (resp. that N is a 
B-module) is equivalent to give a unitary morphism of Green functors from A to 
7-/(M, M) (resp. from B to ~(M, M)). So it suffices to give ~(M, N) a structure of 
7-/(N, N)-module-7"/(M, M). 
So let X, Y, and Z be G-sets. If a C "H(M,M)(X), if f E 7t(M,N)(Y), and 
b E 7~(N,N)(Z), I have seen that if U is a G-set, then b 5 f 5 a is the element of

Notation: 
If M and N are modules for the Green functor A, I denote by 
~A(M, N) 
the commutant of A in the bimodule H( M, N).

HA(M,N)(X) = {f e H(X) I c~ x f = H. (xu~ (mx ~)

Let r~ (resp. l~) be the element of H(M, M)(U) (resp. of H(N, N)(U)) associated to

(~ x f)z(m) 
(I~ 5 f)z(m) = N. (zxu~

Thus HA(M, N)(X) is just the set of A-module homomorphisms from M to Nx. 
Proposition 6.5.4: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. If M and N 
are A-modules, and X is a G-set, then 
HA(M, N)(X) = Homa-Mod(M, Nx) 
If moreover M = N, then the product 
5 
turns ~A(M, M) into a Green 
functor.

CHAPTER 6. CONSTRUCTION OF GREEN FUNCTORS 
6.6 
The functors M| 
Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. If M is an A-module-B, and N an A- 
module, I have built 7~A(M, N), which is a priori a Mackey functor, Actually, in that 
case, it is a B-module: ifX and Y are G-sets, ifb E B(X) and f E HomA(M, Nz), I 
denote by fib the element of HomMack(a)(M, Mz) deduced from the action of B on the 
right on M. Then f 5 Pb C ~(M, N)(YX). It is the morphism of Mackey functors 
from M to Nzx defined on the G-set U by 
(f S Pb)u(m) = N. kuyx/ o fux o Pb,u(rn) = N. kUyX/ o fux(m x b) 
It follows easily that if I set 
\uxy/ 
I obtain a morphism from M to Nxy. Moreover, it is clear that this turns St(M, N) 
into a B-module. Finally, if f is a morphism of A-modules, so is b • f, since if 
a r A(Z), then 
.... a x fux(m x b) = a x (b • f)u(m) 
Now I have defined a B-module structure on ~A(M, N). The correspondence N 
"HA(M, N) is moreover functorial in N: if 0 is a morphism of A-modules from N to 
N', determined by morphisms 0z from N(Y) to N'(Y) for any G-set Y, then I define 
the morphism ~A(M, O) from ~HA(M, N) to ~A(M, N') in the following way: if Y is a 
G-set, if f is an element of HA(M, N)(Y) = I-IomA(M, Nz), and if U is a G-set, then 
It is then clear that 7-~A(M, 0)z(f) is a morphism of Mackey functors from M to N{., 
and since f and 0 are morphisms of A-modules, it is actually a morphism of A-modules. 
So there is a map 7-LA(M, O)y from 7-~A(M, N)(Y) to (HA(M, N')(Y), which defines a 
morphism of Mackey functors from 7{A(M , N) to 7-~A(M, N'). In other words, the 
Mackey functor 7-LA(M, N) is a sub-functor of ~(M, N), which is moreover invariant 
under 7-t(M, 0) if 0 is a morphism of A-modules. 
So the bimodnle M defines a functor from A-Mod to B-Mod. A natural question 
is then to look for a left adjoint, as in proposition proposition 1.10.1. This question 
leads to the following definition: 
Definition: Let A and B be Green [unctors for the group G, and M be an A-module- 
B. If N is a B-module, and X is a G-set, I set

Lemma 6.6.1: The projection M~)N(X) --+ M@BN(X) turns M@BN into a 
Mackey functor, and the morphism A -+ A~)B turns it into an A-module, 
quotient of M@N. Moreover, the correspondence N ~-~ M@sN is a functor 
from B-Mod to A-Mod. 
Proof: To say" that the structure of Mackey functor of M@N is compatible with the 
projection is equivalent to say that the elements 
generate a sub-Mackey functor of M@N. But if f : X ~ X' is a morphism of G-sets, 
then 
(m~N).(f)([m.b| hi(Y#) - [m | b.n](y,~)) = [rn.b| n](y,f~) - [m @ b.n](y,/~) 
Similarly, if now f is a morphism fl'om X' to X, and if the square

m*(a)(m.b) = m*(a)(,n).B*(a)(b) 
X*(a)(b.,~) = B*(a)(b).N*(a)(n) 
which proves that MQsN is a quotient Mackey functor of M~N. 
To prove that MQBN is a quotient A-module of M~N, I must check similarly 
that the elements (E) generate an A-submodule of MQN. But the product of the 
element a E A(Z) by the element [m| hi(y,,) of M~N(X) is given by

M@BN. 
It remains to observe that the construction N ~ M~)BN is functorial in N: if 
f : N --+ N' is a morphism of B-modules, I can set for a G-set (Y, r over X

The lemma follows.

Proposition 6.6.2: Let A and 13 Green functors for the group G. If M is 
an A-module-/3, if N is a /3-module and P an A-module, then there are 
isomorphisms of Mackey functors 
~A(M+,,N, P) ~_ n,, (N, ~A(M, P)) 
which are moreover natural in M,N and P. 
In particular, the functor N ~-+ M@BN is left adjoint to the functor P ~-+ 
n (M, P). 
Proof: I have the following diagram of Mackey functors:

where the bottom isomorphism ~r comes from proposition 1.10.1. I need to show that 
this isomorphism maps the left column to the right one. Let X be a G-set, and f be 
a morphism of Mackey functors from MQN to Px. It follows from proposition 1.8.3 
that f is determined by bilinear maps 
]y : M(Y) • N(Y) + P,:(Y) = P(YX) 
More precisely, the image under f of the element [m | n](u,~) of MQN(Y) is given by 
To say that f passes down to the quotient Mc~BN(Y) is equivalent to say that 
for any G-set (U, r over Y and b E/3(U). This is also equivo,lent to the special case 
(U, r = (Is, Id), i.e. 
= j (m, b.n) 
(6.5) 
On the other hand, the element corresponding to f under (7 in 
~(N, 7-t(M,P))(X) = HomM=&(a)(N, 7-t(M,P)x) = HomM~&(a)(N,'H(M, Px)) 
can also be defined using f: if Y is a G-set, and if n E N(Y), then (r(f)(n) is the 
morphism from M to (Px)z = Prx defined for a G-set Z and m E M(Z) by

the formula

Construction of bimodules 
Let A, B and C be Green flmctors for the group G. If M is an A-module-B and N is a 
B-module-C, then M is in particular an A-module, and N is a C~ 
so MQN 
is an A~C~ 
that is an A-module-C. It is easy to check that this structure 
passes down to the quotient and turns M~BN into an A-module-C. Moreover 
Proposition 7.1.1: Let A, B, C be Green functors for the group G. 
1. If M is an A-module-B, if N is a B-module-C, and if P is a C-module- 
D, then there are isomorphisms of A-modules-D 
(M~BN)~cP ~- M~B(N~cP) 
which are moreover natural in M, N and P. 
2. If M is an A-module-B, then there are isomorphisms of A-modules-B 
AdAM ~-- M 
MQBB ~ M 
which are natural in M. 
Proof: The first assertion follows from proposition 5.3.2 and from the fact that the 
isomorphisms 
(M6N)~P ~_ M~(N~P) 
are compatible with taking quotient, and are natural in M, N, and P. 
The second assertion follows easily by adjunction fl'om the fact that 
HomA(A, Mx) = Mx(.) = M(X) 
which clearly implies 7-~A( A , M) ~_ M. 
9 
Similarly, if P is an A-module-C, then ~A(M, P) is a B-module-C: if X, Y and 
Z are G-sets, if b E B(X), iff E ~A(M, Pz), and c ~ C(Z), I can define b • f • c on 
the G-set U by 
(b • f • c)u(m) = fux(m • b) • c E P(UXYZ) = Pxyz(U)

CHAPTER 7. A MORITA THEORY 
7.2 
Morita 
contexts 
Those constructions of bimodules over Green functors lead to try to generalize the 
notion of a Morita context(see Curtis-Reiner [4] 3.53), in the following way: 
Definition: 
Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. A Morita context 
(M, N, O, @) for A and B consists of an A-module-B M and a B-module-A N, and 
morphisms of bimodules ~ : M@sN ~ A and r : N@AM ~ B, which are balanced 
in the sense that the bilinear morphisms ~P and o2 associated to them are such that 
for any G-sets X, Y and Z 
m • (gv, z(n,m') = ~x,y(m,n) x m' Vm C M(X), n E N(Y), m'E M(Z) 
n • ~y,z(m,n') = ~x,y(n,m) x n' Vn E N(X), m c M(Y), n' E N(Z) 
I will say that (M, N, ~, q2) is a surjective Morita context if ~ and 9 are surjective. 
Lemma 7.2.1: Let (M, N, O, ~) be a Morita context for A and B. Let (U, r 
be a G-set over X, and (V, ~b) be a G-set over Y. Then if m C M(U), n C N(U), 
p e M(V) and q e N(V) 
[m@n](v,r 
~Y([p@q](v,r

CHAPTER 7. A MORITA THEORY 
Proposition 7.2.2: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G, and let 
(M, N, ~, qJ) be a Morita context for A and B. 
9 If ~o is surjective, then ~ is an isomorphism. 
9 If ~P. and ~o are surjective, then 9 and q2 are isomorphisms. Moreover 
in that case 
1. The module Ma is a progenerator for A-Mod and for Mod-B, and 
the module Na is a progenerator for B-Mod and for Mod-A. 
2. There are isomorphisms of bimodules 
N ~" 7-(A(M,A) ~_ ~Bop(M,B)

A ~- ~Bo,(M,M) ~- (']-{B(N,N)) ~ 
B ~-- 7-{Aop(N,N) "~ (7-~A(M,M)) ~ 
4. The functors P ~ N | 
P and Q ~ 
M~BQ are mutual inverse 
equivalences of categories between A-Mod and B-Mod. 
Proof: As q5 is a morphism of A-modules-A, and as A is generated as a bimodule by 
cA, if ~, is surjective, then eA is in its image, and then ap is surjective. To prove the 
first assertion, it suffices then to prove that q~ is injective. 
Let X be a G-set. Let moreover [rei @ ni](u,,r 
for 1 < i < re be elements of 
MQsN(X) 
such that 
) 
~X 
rei @ ni](U,r 
= 0 
By hypothesis, the map ~. is surjective: let [pj | qJ](5,r 
for 1 < j <_ p be elements 
of M@N(e) such that 
(the map r 
is then the unique map from Vj to *). Setting

which proves that r is injective, hence that it is an isomorphism. 
Now if ~o and q*o are surjective, then ~ and 9 are isomorphisms (indeed the 
4-tuple (N, M, ~, (I)) is a Morita context for B and A, and ~ and 9 play symmetric 
roles). Assertion 4) follows then fi'om proposition 7.1.1, since 
N@A(M@BP) ~-- (N@aM)~BP ~- B@BP ~- P 
Lemma 7.2.3: Let M and N be Mackey functors. If X and Y are G-sets, 
then there are isomorphisms of Mackey functors 
(M+N)xy ~- M.v+Ny 
which are natural in M, N, X and Y. 
Proof: This follows from the fact that

naturally in M, N, and X. Then

Moreover, for any G-set Z

.... 
HomM~k(a)(M, PzYx) = HomM~ck(a)(M, (PYx)z) = "H(M, Pyx)(Z)

Remarks: 
1) The isomorphisms of the lemma can be stated precisely. If Z is a 
( 
o 
) 
G-set, then a G-set over ZXY is determined by a map ~(~)~(~)~(~) from U to ZXY. 
I define then a map from (M@N)xr(Z) = M@N(ZXY) to (Mx@Ny)(Z) by 
(u,-~) 
which makes sense because M, ~(,~) (m) r M(UX) = Mx(U), and N, ~(~) (n) E 
N(UY) = Xv(U). 
The inverse isomorphism is defined by 

158 
CHAPTER 7. A MORITA THEORY 
2) The case X = 9 gives in particular the isomorphism 
(M(~N)x ~- M+(Xx) ~- (Mx)+N 
and the naturality of this isomorphism shows that if M is an A-module-B, then for 
any B-module N 
(M+BN)x ~- M+B(Nx) ~- (Mx)+~X 
Proof of proposition 7".2.2 (part 2): Assertion 1)follows from the previous lemma, 
because an equivalence of categories preserves modules of finite type, and because Ma 
is the image of Be under the functor P ~ M@sP, since 
m~ ~- (M@BB)a ~- M@B(Ba) 
Concerning assertion 2), I observe first that evaluating at the set 9 the isomorphism 
~, (N, 7~A(M, A)) ~- 7%(M@uN, A) 
gives 
HomB (N, 7-ta(M, A)) ~- HomA(M@BN, A) 
Then the morphism (I) gives by adjunction a morphism 0 from N to 7-{a(m, A), very 
easy to describe: if n E N(X), then the image of n in ttomA(M, Ax) is the morphism 
defined by 
m E M(Y) ~ 3Pv, x(m,n) E A(YX) = Ax(Y) 
The morphism O is injective: the element n E N(X) is in the kernel of Ox if and 
only if for any G-set Y and any element m E M(Y), I have 
~v,x('~,~) = 0 
But as 9 is surjective, there exists G-sets ~ and elements p~ E N(Y~) and q~ E M(YQ, 
for 1 < i < n, such that 
i 
YlYl 
Then 
The expression inside hooks is also 
Pi • ~.y,,x(qi, r~) 
So it is zero for all i, which proves that n = 0 and that O is injective. 
To prove that O is also surjective, I must prove that if f E HomA(M, Ax), then 
there exists an element n E N(X) such that for any G-set Y and any m E M(Y), I 
have 
fy(m) -= ~y,x(rn, n) 
If such an element exists, keeping the previous notations, I have

which proves that O is an isomorphism. It is easy to see that it is an isomorphism of 
bimodules. The other isomorphisms of assertion 2) now follow, by switching the roles 
of A and B, or replacing them by their opposite. 
Assertion 3) is proved by observing that

CHAPTER 7. A MORITA THEORY 
Moreover, if I denote by F the fimctor N~A-- from A-Mod to B-Mod, the isomor- 
phisms 
(N+aP)x 
show that F(Px) ~- F(P)x. As F is an equivalence of categories, then 
HomB (F(P), F(Q) = HomA(P, Q) 
for any P and Q. It follows that 
.... 
HomA(P, Qx) = HA(P, Q)(X) 
and it is easy to see that those isomorphisms induce isomorphisms of Mackey functors 
"HB (F(P), F(Q)) "Ha(P, Q) 
which are moreover compatible with the product 
5 . Thus for any A-module, the 
Green functors "HB(F(P), iv(P)) and "HA(P, P) are isomorphic. Now for P : A, this 
gives 
"HB(N, N) ~_ A ~ 
and assertion 3) follows. This completes the proof of the proposition. 
9 
7.3 
Converse 
The previous proposition has a converse: 
Proposition 7.3.1: Let A be a Green funetor for the group G, and M be 
an A-module such that Mu is a progenerator of A-Mod. Let N = "HA(M, A) 
and B = ('HA(M,M)) ~ 
Then there exists a surjective Morita context 
(M, N, ~, ~) for A and B. 
Proof: Let X and Y be G-sets. If rn r M(X) and f E B(Y) = Homa(M, Mr), let 
m • f = fx(m) E My(X) = M(XY) 
It is easy to see that this definition turns M into an A-module-B. 
Then N = 
"HA(M, A) is a B-module-A. As moreover 
"HA(M+sN, A) ~_ ~s (N, "HA(M, A)) = "HB(N, N) 
the identity map of N gives a morphism of A-modules from M~BN to A, which can 
be described as follows: if X and Y are G-sets, let ~x,Y be the bilinear map from 
M(X) • N(Y) to A(XY) defined by 
m E M(X), r E N(Y) = HomA(M, Av) ~ ex(m) E At(X) = A(XY) 
It is easy to check that those maps define a bilinear morphism from M, N to A, 
associated to a morphism ~ from M+BN to A, which is a morphism of A-modules-A. 

7.3. CONVERSE 
161 
Conversely, there is a bilinear morphism t) from N, M to B defined as follows: if 
X and Y are G-sets, if f E N(X) = HomA(M, Ax) and m r M(Y), then ~x,y(f,m) 
is the morphism from M to Mxv defined for a G-set Z and m E M(Z) by 
~x.v(f,m) : 7Y~l ~ M(Z) ~ fz(m,) • ro E M(ZXY) = Mxv(Z) 
The morphism from N@M to B associated to it passes down to the quotient, and 
defines a morphism from N@AM to B, which is a morphism of B-modules-B. 
Before proving the proposition, I will give an equivalent formulation of the hy- 
pothesis on M, independent of fh 
Lemma 7.3.2: Let A be a Green functor for G, and M be an A-module. 
The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The module Mn is a progenerator. 
2. The module M is a finitely generated projective module, and there 
exists a G-set X such that A is a direct summand of Mx. 
3. There exists G-sets X and Y such that A is a direct summand of Mix 
and M is a direct summand of Az. 
Proofi First I observe that if X and Y are G-sets such that X divides Y in CA, then 
Mx is a direct summand of Mr: indeed, say that X divides Y in dA is equivalent to 
say that Ax is a direct summand of Av. But Mx is isomorphic to "HA(Ax, M), which 
is a direct summand of "HA(Ay, M) ~- Mz. 
So if Ma is a progenerator, as 9 divides f~ in CA, it follows that M is a direct 
summand of Ma, so M is a finitely generated projective module. Moreover, there 
exists a set I and a surjective morphism 
p: @ M# ) ~ A 
iE1 
from a sum of copies of Ma to A. In particular, there is a finite subset ,1 C_ I and 
/I/t(J) ' o" 
elements rnj E --a (), for j E J, such that. 
~A = P.(~'~ mj) 
j~_J 
Then the image B of the restriction of p to | 
j) is an A-submodule of A, and 
B(*) contains CA. This proves that there exists an integer n such that A is a quotient, 
hence a direct summand, of nMfl ~- M,~fl. Thus 1) implies 2). 
If now hypothesis 2) holds, then as An is a progenerator, and as M is a finitely gen- 
erated projective module, there exists an integer n such that M is a direct summand 
of nAG ~- A,~a. So 2) implies 3). 
Finally if 3) holds, then M is a finitely generated projective module, because it 
is a direct summand of the projective module Az. Then Mn is a direct summand 
of (Az)a ~- Aay, and Ma is a finitely generated projective module. Moreover, the 
module An is a direct summand of (Mx)a ~- Max. As f/X divides a multiple of f~ in 
CA, it follows that Aa is a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of Ma. As Aa is 
a progenerator, so is Ma, and this proves the lemma. 
9 

162 
CHAPTER 7. A MORITA THEORY 
Proof of proposition 7.3.1: I must prove that if Mn is a progenerator, then 02 and 
q~ are surjective. It is equivalent to say that CA lies in the image of 4p,, and eB in the 
image of ~o. 
I will show that if there exists X such that A is a direct summand of Mx, then 02 
is surjective, and that if there exists Y such that M is a direct summand of Ar (which 
is equivalent to say that M is projective and of finite type), then 9 is surjective. 
So let X be such that A is a direct summand of Mx. Then there exists an element 
ct E HomA(A, Mx) and an element fl E HomA(Mx,A) such that 
flo a = IdA 
But I have seen that HomA(A, Mx) ~- M(X). Let m E M(X) be the image of c~ 
under that isomorphism. Then c~ is defined on the G set Z by 
a E A(Z) ~ a x m E M(ZX) = Mx(Z) 
On the other hand 
HomA(Mx, A) ~_ HomA(M, Ax) 
Under this isomorphism, the element fl maps to 5 E Homm(M, Ax) = N(X), and I 
know that for any G-set Z and any m' E Mx(Z) = M(ZX), I have 
Now say that fl o c~ = IdA is equivalent to say that for any Z and any a E A(Z) 
which can be written as 
This is equivalent to 
a=a• 
X ) 
Then let 
= [m | ?](x,(:))E M~cBN(.) 
The image of ~- under 02~ is precisely 
= 
= 
7x(m) 
= cA 
XX 
X32 
and this proves that 02~ is surjeetive. 
Similarly, if M is a direct summand of My, then there exists a E HomA(Ay, M) and 
fl E HomA(M, Ay) such that c~ o/~ : IdM. But 
HomA(Ay, M) "~ M(Y) 

7.4. A REMARK ON BIMODULES 
163 
and c~ is determined by an element m E M(Y), such that for a ff Ay(Z) = A(ZY) 
Now say that c~ o ~ = IdM means that for any G-set Z and any m' E M(Z), I have 
Let 
r'= [3 | m](v,(~)) E N+AM(.) 
The image of r' under q2 is the element of HA(M, M)(.) = EndA(M) defined by 
which can be evaluated at a G-set Z by 
It follows that ~(r')(m') = m', so q2(r') is the identity of M, that is the unit e~a(M,M). 
This proves that ffJ is surjective, and completes the proof of the proposition.

A remark on bimodules 
If A is a Green functor for G, theorem 4.3.1 states that evaluation at fl is an equiva- 
lence of categories from A-Mod to A(g/2)-Mod. If B is another Green functor, and 
M is an A-module-B, then M(a) is an A(a2)-module, and a B~

There is no obvious reason for which this expression should be equal to (E), so M(9) 
is not a bimodule in general. This is because (AQB~

A(fF) and B(fF) ~ over the non-commutative algebra b(92) (i.e. Mackey algebra) as 
shown in the next proposition: 
Proposition 7.4.1: Let A and B be Green functors for the group G. If fl is 
a G-set, then the morphism from b to A (resp. from b to B) turns A(f~ 2)

Composition 
8.1 
Bisets 
In [2], I have studied the following problem: if G and H are groups, what kind of 
functors F from G-set to H-set induce by composition a functor from Mack(H) to 
Mack(G)? It seems natural to ask that the functor F transforms a disjoint union 
into a disjoint union, and a cartesian square into a cartesian square. The functors 
from G-set to H-set having those two properties can be completely classified up to 
isomorphism by the (isomorphism classes of) H-sets-G: 
Definitions: Let G and H be groups. An H-set-G is a set X with a left H-action 
and a right G-action, which commute, i.e. such that if g E G, h C H and x E X 
h (x g) -- (h.x) g 
fiG, H, and K are groups, if X is an H-set-G, and Y a K-set-H, I denote by Y OH X 
the K-set-G de/~ned by 
YOHX={(y,x) 
EYxXIVhEH, 
yh=y~ 
3gE G, h.x=x.g}/H 
where the action of H is given by (y, x).h = (y.h, h-ix). 
The action of K and G on Y OH X is given 
k.(y, x)g = (k.y,x4) 
If X is an H-set-G, and if G and H are clear from context, I will also say that X is 
a set with a double action, or biset for short. 
With those notations, if U is an H-set-G, and X is a G-set, or G-set-(l), then 
UoaX is an H-set-(i), that is an H-set. This construction gives a functor from G-set 
to H-set, that I denote by U oG -. The precise statement proved in [2] is then 
Theorem 8.1.1: Let G and H be finite groups. 
* If F is a functor from G-set to H-set which transforms disjoint unions 
into disjoint unions and cartesian squares into cartesian squares, then 
there exists an H-set-G U, unique up to isomorphism of H-sets-G, 
such that F is isomorphic to the functor U oa -. 

168 
CHAPTER 8. COMPOSITION 
9 Conversely, if U is an H-set-G, then the functor Uoa- transforms dis- 
joint unions into disjoint unions and cartesian squares into cartesian 
squares. 
I also proved that in these conditions, the set U induces a functor from Mack(H) to 
Mack(G), defined by composition, and denoted by 
M~MoU 
If M is a Mackey functor for H, the Mackey functor M o U is defined over the G-set 
X by 
(M o U)(X) = M(U o~ x) 
If f : X --+ Y is a morphism of H-sets, then U oG f : U oa X --+ U oa Y is defined by 
x): 
s(x)) 
and then 
(mo U),(f) = M.(U oa f) 
(M o U)*(f) = M*(U oa f) 
Examples: 1) If H is a subgroup of G, and if U is the set G, viewed as an H-set-G 
by multiplication, then the functor U oa - is tile restriction functor [rom G-set to 
H-set. If V is the set G viewed as a G-set-H, then V OH -- is the induction functor 
from H-set to G-set. The functor M H M o U is then the induction functor for 
Mackey functors, and the functor N ~ N o V is the restriction functor for Mackey 
functors. 
2) If N is a normal subgroup of the group G, if H = G/N, let U be the set H, viewed 
as an H-set-G, the group G acting by the projection G ~ G/N, and let V be the 
same set viewed as a G-set-H. Then the functor U oa - is the "fixed points by N" 
functor. It is easy to identify the functor M H M o U as the inflation functor from 
Mack(H) to Mack(G), defined by Th6venaz and Webb (see [14], [15]). The functor 
V oa - is the inflation functor from H-set to G-set. The functor N ~ N o V is the 
"coinflation" functor for Mackey functors (that Th6venaz and Webb denote by/3 ! in 
[15] Lemma 5.4, and I denote by Pg/N in [2]). 
3) If U is an H-set-G, then U oa * ~- U/G. 
4) If U is a G-set-G, and X a G-set, then 
UoaX=

Composition and tensor product 
Definition: Let G and H be groups, and U be an H-set-G. If M and N are Mackey 
functors for H, and if X and Y are G-sets, I denote by r U 
the map 
X,Y 
YxY : M(U o~ X) • W(U oG Y) -+ (M+N)(U o~ (X • Y))

Composition and Green functors 
When A is a Green functor for the group H, the product on A gives a morphism from 
A~A to A, hence a morphism from (A+A) o U to A o U. Composing this morphism 
with the morphism 
(A o U)~(A o U) ~ (AQA) o U 
deduced from T gives a morphism 
(A o U)6(A o U) -+ A o U

I view it as a product on A o U, that I denote by • 
It is natural to ask if A o U is 
a Green functor. To see this, I will first describe precisely the product: if X and Y 
are a-sets, if a C (A o U)(X) and b C (A o U)(Y), the product a x v b is equal to 
where the product "." on the right hand side is the product of A. Then

Composition 
and associated 
categories 
Let G and H be finite groups. If U is an H-set-G, and A is a Green functor for H, 
then A o U is a Green functor for G. Each of these Green functors has an associated 
category, and the functor U oc, - defines actually a functor from Caou to CA: 
Proposition 8.4.1: Let G and H be finite groups, let U be an H-set-G, and 
A be a Green functor for H. 
Then the correspondence 
which maps the 
G-set X to the H-set U[X] = U oa X, and the morphism c~ E (A o U)(Y • X) 
to U[a] = A.(5~,x)(C~ ) + A((U oc X) x (U oa Y)) is an R-additive functor from 
CAoU to C. 
Proof: I must check that if X, Y, and Z are G-sets, if a C A(YX) and t3 E A(ZY), 
then 
where o};7 is the product o for tile category CAo U, Tills equality can also be written as 
A.( ~,~. )(~) O~ooy A.(~,~)(~) = A.( e~,x )(~ o~ <~)

8.5. COMPOSITION AND MODULES 
175 
8.5 
Composition and modules 
Let G and H be finite groups, let U be an H-set-G, and A be a Green fnnctor for 
H. The above functor from CAoU to CA induces by composition a functor between 
the associated categories of representations: if F is an R-additive functor on CA, 
then the functor F o U is an R-additive fimctor on CAoU: if X is a G-set, then 
(F o U)(X) = F(U oa X). As the category of R-additive functors on CA is equivalent 
to the category of A-modules, the functor t" corresponds to an A-module N, and then 
the functor F o U corresponds of course to the module N o U: 
Proposition 8.5.1: Let G and H be finite groups, let U be an H-set-G, and 
A be a Green funetor for H. If N is an A-module, then N o U is an A o U- 
module, for the product x u defined by 
(a,n) E (A e U)(X) • (N o U)(Y) ~ c~ xUn = N*(5~,z)(a • n) E (X o U)(X x Y) 
The correspondence N ~ N o U is a functor from A-Mod to A o U-Mod. 
Proof: With the notations of theorem 3.3.5, I have to find the A o U-module N ~ = 
MFNoU, and to prove that it coincides with N o U as Mackey functor. 
If X is a G-set, I have 
X'(X) = (FN o U)(X) = rN((: oa X) = N(U o~ X) 
If f : X --+ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then by definition 
N'.(f) = ( FN o U)( f~. r) = FN( U[ff.']) 
where f.u is the element of (A o U)(YX) associated to f by lemma 3.2.3, i.e. 
(x)

'o 
(E) = (U oc f). 
(~, f(x))(~, x) 
SO 
N'(f) = FN((U oG f).) = N.(U oa f) = (N o U).(f) 
A similar argument shows that if fu,. is the element of (A o U)(XY) corresponding 
to f by lemma 3.2.3, then fu,. = (U oG f)*, and then 
N'*(f) = FN(f u'*) = FN((U oa f)*) = N*(U oa f) = (N o U)*(f)

which proves that N' coincides as Mackey functor with N o U. 
The structure of A o U-module of N o U is then defined as follows: if X and Y

8.6 
Functoriality 
If G and H are finite groups, and U is an H-set-G, then I have a functorial construction 
X ~ U oa X from G-set to H-set. This construction is not quite functorial in U: 
if f : U --+ V is a morphism of H-sets-G, there is in general no associated morphism 
U oa X --+ V oa X: this is because if (u, x) E U oa X, i.e. if the right stabilizer of u 
is contained in the left stabilizer of x, generally, the right stabilizer of f(u) is not. 
I have studied this question in [2], and showed that it is natural to ask moreover 
that f is injective when restricted to each orbit of G (or equivalently to ask that the 
right stabilizer of f(u) is equal to the right stabilizer of u, for any u C U). Then, 
there is a morphism of functors f oa - from U oa - to V oa - defined on the G-set 
X by 
In those conditions (see [2] prop. 10 and 11), if M is a Mackey functor for H, then 
M o U and M o V are Mackey functors for G, and the morphism f induces two 
morphisms of Mackey functors (denoted by jr. and f* in [2], but differently here to 
avoid confusion): a morphism Mf from M o U to M o V, and a morphism M / from 
M o V to M o U. Those morphisms are defined for a G-set X by 
Mf,x = M.(f oa X) : (M o U)(X) ~ (M o V)(X) 
M~ = M*(f oc X): (M o V)(X) ~ (M o U)(X) 
With those notations: 
Proposition 8.6.1: Let G and H be finite groups, and let A be a Green 
functor for H. 
Let moreover U and V be H-sets-G, and f : U --* V be a 
morphism of H-sets-G, which is injective on each right orbit. 
9 If A is a Green functor for H, then A f is a unitary morphism of Green 
functors from A o V to A o U. 
9 If M is an A-module, then restriction along A f gives M o V and M o 
U structures of A o V-modules, and the morphisms M i and M f are 
morphisms of A o V-modules. 
Proof: 
For the first assertion, I must show that if X and Y are G-sets, if a E 
(A o V)(X) and b E (A o V)(Y), then

and the right hand side to 
A*(f oc~ (X x Y))A*(6~y)(a x b) 
Now equality follows from 
since for (u,x,y) 6 U oG (X x Y) 
((lo~x) x (,focy))o4,y(~,x,~)= ((,-ocx) xisoc,,-)) ((~,=), (~,~)) . . . .

Moreover 
A{@AoV) = A*(f oc ")A*(py/a)(Cm) = A*(pu/c)@A) = CAoU 
since PU/G = Pv/c; o (f o G .). So the morphism A I is a unitary morphism of Green 
funetors. 
For the second assertion, I must show that if a e (A o V)(X) and m 6 (M o U)(Y), 
then 
a x v M!y(m ) = My,xy(Af(a) x U m)

In those conditions, the element (u,tx',y) is in U oa (XY): indeed, if r E G is such 
that ur = u, then as (u,y) E U oa Y, I have ry = y. Moreover 
v't-lrt = f(u)rt = f(urt) -- f(ut) = f(u)t - v'

Conversely, if (Ul, Xl, Yl) E U oa (XY) is such that

then the last equality proves that replacing (Ul, Xl, Yl) by (uls -1 , SXl, syl) for a suit-

So there exists r E G such that 
f(u)r = f(u) 
r-ix1 = tx' 
As f is injective on the right orbits, the first equality shows that ur = u, and since 
(u, Xl, y) E U oa (XY), I have rxl = Xl = tx', and 
(u,, x,, y, ) : (u, tx', y)

Example: 
induction 
and 
restriction 
Let O be a finite group, and H be a subgroup of G. Let U be the set G, viewed as a 
G-set-H, and V be the set G, viewed as ai1 H-set-G. If X is an H-set, then U oa X 
identifies with IndeX, functorially in X. It follows that if M is a Mackey functor for 
G, then M o U is isomorphic to Res~M. 
If Y is a G-set, then V oG Y identifies with Res~Y, functorially in Y, by the map 
(g, Y) ~ gY. Thus if N is a Mackey functor for H, then N o V identifies with Ind~N. 
So if A is a Green functor for G, then Res~A is a Green functor for H, and this is 
not surprising. The case of induction is less clear, but corresponds to what Th6venaz 
calls coinduction (see [13]): 
Proposition 8.7.1: Let H be a subgroup of the group G, and B be a Green 
functor for H. then: 
9 The functor Ind~B is a Green functor for G. If K is a subgroup of 
G, then there is an isomorphism of rings (with unit)

9 The functor B H IndCH B, from the category Green(H) of Green fune- 
tors for H, to Green(G), is right adjoint to the functor A ~ Res~A 
from Green(G) to Green(H). 
Proof: The formula giving (Ind~B)(K) is well known for Mackey functors. 
point is that is is still true for Green functors.

F = G/K, and denoting by ,v,, the product "." on A, I have 
~ 
, 
\(~,~)(~,~)/ 
But I know that the ring (B(V oa F), .) is isomorphic to the direct product of rings 
(B(a3), .) for the various orbits w of H on V oG P. The first assertion follows. 
Similarly, the second assertion is clear for Mackey functors. I must show that the 
adjunction passes down to Green functors. If A is a Green functor for G, if B is a 
Green functor for H, and (I) is a morphism from A to Ind/~B, then for any subgroup 
K of G, I have a morphism 
~,~-: A(K)

Say that r is a morphism of Green functors means exactly by the previous remarks 
that qSK,x is a morphism of rings (with unit) fi'om (A(K), .v) to (B(H n xK), .), for 
any x. But if L is a subgroup of H, the morphism q~L from A(L) = Rest(L) to B(L) 
associated to (I) by adjunction is (I)L,1. So q? is a unitary morphism of Green functors. 
Conversely, if 9 is a unitary morphism of Green functors from ResgA to B, then 
for any subgroup L of G, I have a morphism q'L of rings (with unit) from A(L) to 
B(L). The morphism ~ associated to 9 by adjunction is then defined on the subgroup 
K of G by 
x 
K 
a 
~K,::(a) = q~Hn~h'( rH,~nK( )) 
It is the product of three morphisms of rings (with unit). So it is a morphism of 
rings with unit, and gP is a unitary morphism of Green functors. 
This proves the 
proposition. 
9 
The adjunction property shows in particular that if A is a Green functor for G, 
then there is a unitary morphism ~a of Green functors, adjoint to the identity of 
Res~A 
r/A :A --+ IndGHReSaHA 
But 
a 
G 
U) o 
IndHReSHA = (A o 
V = A o (U O H V) 
It is easy to see that U OH V ~_ (G XH G), which is the quotient of G x G by the 
right action of H given by (gx,g2)h = (gxh, h-~g2). On the other hand, if I denote by 
I the set G, viewed as a "identity " G-set-G, the functor A is equal to A o I, and the 
morphism rlA comes from the morphism 
f : U OH V ~ I 
(gl,g2)H ~-~ 9t-92 E I 
This morphism is injective on the right orbits: indeed, if 
f((gl,g2)g.g),

= gig2

then 
91.92.9 = 91 .g2 
which proves that g = 1. 
Now if M is an A-module, I know that Res~M is a Res~A module. Conversely, if 
N is a Res~A-module, then Ind~N is a Ind~Res~A-module, so an A-module by the 
morphism flA. The proposition 8.6.1 shows that those correspondences are functorial. 
Moreover 
Proposition 8.7.2: Let A be a Green functor for the group G, and H be a 
subgroup of G. The functor M H ReSaH M from A-Mod to ResaHA-Mod is left 
and right adjoint to the functor N H Ind~N from Res~A-Mod to A-Mod. 
Proof: Here again, this property is well known for Mackey functors. All I have to do 
is to keep track of the adjunction procedure: if M is an A-module, if N is a Res~A- 
module, and f is a morphism of nes A modules from Res~M to N, then Ind~f is 
a morphism of Ind~Res/~A-modules from Ind~Res~M to Ind~N. Thus it is also a 
morphism of A modules from Ind~Res~M to Ind~N. The adjoint of f is obtained 
by composing this morphism with the morphism from M to IndGHResaM, which is 
a morphism of A-modules. So the adjunction at the level of Mackey functors maps 
morphisms of Res~A modules to morphisms of A-modules. 
Conversely, if g is a morphism of A-modules from M to Ind~N, then ResaHg is 
a morphism of Res~A-modules fi'om Res~M to Res~Ind~N. 
The adjoint of g is 
obtained by composing this morphism with the morphism p from Res/~IndaH N to 
N, which is a morphism of ResaHA-modules: it follows indeed from the morphism of 
H-sets-H 
@:hEHH(h,1) 
EVoGU 
which is injective: indeed, if hi and h2 in H are such that (hi, 1) = (h2, 1) in V oa U, 
then there exists g r G such that h2 = h~g and 1 = g.1. Sog = 1 and hi = h~. 
If B = Res~A, the morphism p is then a morphism of Res~Ind~B-modules from 
Res~Ind~N to N. As 
Res~Ind~B = Res~Ind~/Res~A 
I have the morphism ResaT1/from Res~A to Resalnd~Res~A, and the composite 
aes,~A aes~qA Res~Ind~Res~A 
Be)Res~A 
is the identity of B, because it expresses the adjunction of Res~ and Ind~ at the level 
of Mackey functors. 
So through Res~rlA I recover the same Res~A-module structure on N, and this proves 
that p is a morphism of Res~A-modules. Now the adjunction at the level of Mackey 
functors maps morphisms of A-modules to morphisms of Res~A-modules, and this 
proves that the functor Rest/is left adjoint to the functor Ind,. A similar argument. 
shows that it is also right adjoint. This completes the proof of the proposition.

Adjoint constructions 
Notations: 
If G and H are groups, and L is a subgroup of H • G, I denote by 
p~(L) the projection from L to H, and p2(L) its projection onto G. I denote by kl(L) 
(resp. k2( L ) ) the normal subgroup of p~ ( L ) (resp. of p2( L ) ) formed of elements h E H 
(11esp. elements9 E G) such that (h, 1) E L (resp, such that (1,9) C L). The groups 
pl(L)/kl (L) and p2(L)/I~2(L) are canonically isomorphic, and 1 denote by q(L) this 
quotient. 
I denote by (H x G)/L the set of left classes of L in H • G~ viewed as an H-set-G 
by 
h.(~,v)L.g : (h~,g-~v)L 
With those notations, I have shown ([2] Lemme 2) that if U : (H x G)/L, and if X 
is a G-set, then

denoting by TL the transport by the canonical isomorphismp~(L)/kl(L) ~_ p~(L)/k2(L) 
of a p~(L)/k~(L)-set. 
It follows (see [2] 4.I.2) that if M is a Mackey functor for H, then 
M o U = Ind~(L)Inf~:(L{ ka L OLj: (L) k. rL, ResH,L' M

where OL denotes the transport by isomorphism of Mackey %nctors for p~(L)/kl(L) 
to Mackey functors for p2(L)/k2(L). 
As any H-set-G U is a disjoint union of transitive H-sets-G, i.e. of the form 
(H • G)/L, it follows that the functor M o U is a direct sum of fnnctors composed of 
restriction, inflation, coinflation, and induction. 
I already know that the functors of restriction and inflation are mutual left and 
right adjoints. Thhvenaz and Webb (see [14] 5.1, [15] 2.) have built left and right 
adjoints for inflation, and they also mention ([15] 5.4 and 5.6) that coinflation has a 
left adjoint (and a right one if the ground ring is a field). It follows that the functors 
M ~-~ M o U always have a left adjoint. I will show that they always have a left and 
right adjoint, and describe their structure in terms of G-sets. 
9.1 
A left adjoint to the functor Z ~-~ U OH Z 
Notation: 
Let U be a fixed G-set-H. [ denote by u ~ uH the projection from U to 
U/ H. If (Y, f) is a G-set over U/ H, I denote by U.Y the pull-back product of U and 

184 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
Y over U/H, defined by 
U.Y = {(u,y) E U • Y If(Y) = uH} 
I view U.Y as a G-set-H: ifg 6 G and h 6 H, then 
g.(u,y).h = (guh,gy) 
If (u, y) E U.Y, I denote by G(u, y) its orbit under G. I denote by G\U.Y the set of 
orbits of G on U.Y, viewed as an H-set by 
h.a(u, y) = G(uh-', y) 
This construction is functorial in Y: if a : (Y, f) ---, (Y', f') is a morphism of G-sets 
over U/H, then the map 
a\U.~ : Giu.Y -~ G\U.Y' 
defined by 
is a morphism of H-sets. 
Conversely, if Z is an H-set, and Pz is the unique morphism from Z to *, then 
UoHpz is a morphism from UOHZ to UOH. = U/H. Thus Z ~ UoHZ is a functor 
from H-set to G-set~u/H. Actually: 
Proposition 9.1.1: The functor (Y,f) ~ G\U.Y from G-setlu/H to H-set is 
left adjoint to the funetor Z ~-~ U OH Z. 
Proof: Let (Y, f) be a G-set over U/H, and Z be an H-set. If r is a morphism of G- 
sets over U/H from (Y, f) to (U OH Z, U OH PZ), and if (u, y) E U.Y, then f(y) = uY. 
Moreover, as 
(U o g Pz)r 
= f(Y) = ug 
there exists h E H and z E Z such that r 
= (uh, z). If h' E H and z' C Z are such 
that r 
= (uh', z'), then there exists h" E H such that 
uh = uh'h" 
z' = h" z 
In those conditions uh = 4h.h-lh'h '', and as (4h, z) E U OH Z, it follows that 
h-lh'h'z = z, hence that hz = h'h"z = h'z'. 
In particular the element hz C Z 
is well defined by the condition r 
= (uh, z) = (u, hz). 
I can then define O(u, y) C Z by the condition 
r 
= (u,0(u,y)) 
Then as g(u, y) = (gu, gy) for g E G, if z = O(u, y), I have 
r 
= gr 
= g(4, z) = (g4, z) 
which proves that O(gu, gy) = O(u,y). So 0 is a map from G\U.Y to Z. As moreover 
h.G(~, y) = (~h-~, y), and as 
r 
= (~,z) = (4h-l,~z) 

9.1. A LEFT ADJOINT TO THE FUNCTOR Z ~ U OH Z 
185 
I have O(h.G(u,y)) = hz = hO(u,y). So 0 is a morphism of H-sets from G\U.Y to Z. 
Conversely, if 0 is a morphism of H-sets from G\U.Y to Z, and if y C Y, let u E U 
such that f(y) = uH. Then (u,y) E U.Y. In those conditions, if z = O(G(u,y)), the 
element (u, z) is in U OH Z: indeed if h C H is such that uh = u, then 
h -1.u(u, y) = G(m~, y) = G(u, y) 
thus z = O(G(u,y)) = hO(G(u,y)) = hz. The element (u,z)does not depend on the 
choice of u such that f(y) = uH: if I change u to uh, for h E H, then 
O(a(uh, y)) -- h-10(G(~,y)) 
: h-lz 
and (u, z) = (uh, h-lz). I can then set r 
= (4, z). As f(gy) = gI(Y) = gull, and 
as O(G(gu,gy)) : OiG(u,y)) : z, I have 
r 
= (r 
z) = .q(u, z) = gr 
Thus r is a morphism of G-sets from Y to U OH Z. 
The correspondences r ~ 0 and 0 ~ r are inverse to each other: indeed, the 
equality 
defines 0 from r and r from 0. The proposition will then follow, if I know that the 
unit and co-unit of this adjunction are functorial: 
Notation: 
If (Y, f) is a G-set over U/H, I will denote by ~(y,S) (or ~,y if f is clear 
from context) the unit of the previous adjunction: it is the morphism 
t,(yd) : Y ~ U OH (G\U.Y) 
defined by ~(~,S)(Y)= (~, U(~, y)), if /(y)= ~H. 
If Z is an H-set, I will denote by 71z the co-unit of this adjunction: it is the 
morphism 
rlz : G\U.(U oH Z) ~ Z 
defined by 7jz(G(u',(u,z))) = h-lz ifh 9 H is such that u'= uh. 
Then, is functorial: if c~: (Y, f) ~ (Z, g) is a morphism of G-sets over U/H, and 
if (u, y) 9 U.Y, then "(yd)(Y) = (u, G(u, y)). Thus 
But gc~(y) = f(y) = uH, so t,(zm)c~(y) = (u, G(u, c~(y))), which shows that 
.(~,.)~ : (u o. (GXU..))~(~,j) 
Similarly, is functorial: if f: Z ~ T is a morphism of H-sets, and if (u', (u, z)) E 
U.(UoHZ),thenthereexistsh 9 Hsuchthatu'=uh. 
Then,z(G(u',(u,z))) 
=h-lz.

9.2 
The categories ~Du(X) 
Definition: If X is a G-set, let 39u(X) be the following category: 
9 The objects of Du(X) are the G-sets over X • (U/H). If (Y,I) is an object 
of 2)u(X), I denote by fu the map from Y to U/H obtained by composing f 
with the projection from X • (U/H) on U/H, and fx the composition product 
of f with the projection on X. Then (Y, fu) is a G-set over U/H, to which I 
associate the pull-back product U.Y. 
9 A morphism ce from (Y,f) to (Z,g) is a mol'phism of G-sets from Y to Z such 
that g o c~ = f, and such that the morphism U.o from U.Y to U.Z associated to 
a is injective on each left orbit under G, i.e. such that 
(u, y) ~ u.Y, g ~ G, v~ = ~, ~(gy) = ~(y) ~ 
gy = y 
Remark: In particular, if a is injective, then U.c~ is injective on each left orbit. 
It is clear that ~Du(X) is a category: the product of two morphisms which are 
injective on the left orbits is injective on the left orbits, and the identity morphism is 
injective on the left orbits. 
If r : X --+ X' is a morphism of G-sets, let r be the morphism r x Idu/H fi'om 
X • (U/H) to X' • (U/H). There is an obvious functor from 7)u(X) to D u(X'), which 
maps (Y, f) to (Y, el), and the morphism o~: (II, f) + (Z,g) to a: (Y, C f) -+ (Z, q~g). 
I will denote this functor by 7)u,,(r 
Similarly, there is a functor from Z)u(X') to 
:Du(X), defined by inverse image along r if (Y', f') is a G-set over X' • (U/H), let 
Y, f and a be such that the square

is cartesian. Indeed, if z E Z and y' E Y' are such that b(z) = ~'(y'), then 
g'b(z)= Cg(z) =g'a'(y') =f'(y') 
Then by definition of Y, there exists a unique y E Y such that 
g(z) = f(y) 
y'= a(y) 
Moreover 
ha(y) = c/a(y) = ce'(y') = b(z) 
gc~(y) = f(y) = g(z) 
Then z and a(y) have the same image under b and g, so z = c~(y). And if another 
element yl E Y is such that c~(yl) = a(y) and a(yl) = a(y), then 
goe(yl) = gc~(y) = f(yl) = f(y) 
and unicity of y implies yl = 
Y. 
Moreover, the morphism U.a is injective on the left orbits:

188 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
Proofi Indeed, if (u,y) r U.Y and (gu,gy) have the same image under U.a, then 
gu = u and a(gy) = a(y). Taking the image under b of this relation gives 
ba(gy) = a'a(gy) = ba(y) = a'a(y) 
so a'(ga(y)) = a'(a(y)). As U.a' is injective on the left orbits, it follows that ga(y) = 
a(gy) = a(y). As moreover a(gy) = a(y), and as the square Y, Y', Z, Z' is cartesian, 
I have gy = y. 
.. 
It follows that if I set D~(r 
f') = (Y, f) and D~(r 
= a, I get a functor 
from 7)u(X') to Du(X). 
9.3

for short) if the square

(U oH a)(U OH Z) n uv(Y) = 
If M is a Mackey functor for H, and (Y, f) is a G-set over U/H, I set 
Qu(M)(Y, f) = M(G\U.Y)/ 
~ 
M.(a)M(Z) 
(z,~) 
where the sum runs on the H-sets ( Z, a) over GkU.Y which are v-disjoint. 
Remark: Say that (Z, a) is not v-disjoint means that there exists z C Z and y' ff Y, 
such that if u'H = fu(y') and a(z) = G(u,y), then there exists v C U such that 
(v,z) GUoHZand 
(v, 
This means that there exists h E H such that v = u~h and 
G(u, y) = h-lG(~ ', v') = G(u'h, y') 
So there exists g E G such that 
uth = gu 
y' = gy 
Finally, there exists g E G and h E H such that 
v = gu 
u' = guh -1 
y~ = gy 

9.3. THE FUNCTORS Qu(M) 
189 
Now (v, z) : (g u, z) belongs to U OH Z if and only if (u, z) E U OH Z does. 
Conversely, if a(z) = G(u, y), and if (u, z) E U OH Z, then (u, y) E U.Y, and 
vy(y) = (u, G(u,y)) = (U OH a)(u,z) 
Thus (Z, a) is v-disjoint if and only if 
gee Z, a(z) = G(u,y) ~ (u,z) ~ U oH Z 
If X is a G-set, and Y is an object of Du(X), I set 
Qu(M)(k] f) = Qu(M)(fu) 
Lemma 
9.3.1: Let X be a G-set. The correspondence 
(Y, f) H Qu(M)(Y, f) 
a: (Y,f) + (Z,g) 
~ 
M.(G\U.a): M(G\U.Y) ~ M(G\U.Z) 
induces a functor from ~u(X) to R-Mod. 
Proof: I must prove that if a is a morphism in ?)u(X) from (Y,f) to (g,g), if 
(T,a) is a v-disjoint H-set over G\U.Y, and if m E M(T), then the image of 
M.(G\g.cOM.(a)(m ) in Qu(M)(Z, gu) is zero. This will be the case in particular 
if, denoting by /3 the morphism G\U.e, the H-set (T,/3a) is v-disjoint over G\U.Z. 
This is equivalent to say that the square

CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
Proof: Let ('u,, G(u2, y)) E U OH (G\U.Y) and z E Z such that 
If v 9 U is such that vH = gu(z), then uz(z) = (v,G(v,z)l. 
The above equality 
means that there exists h 9 H such that 
k 
/ 
ulh = v 
h-lG(u2, e(y)) = c(,, ~) = c(~h,~(y)) 
So there exists x 9 G such that 
v = xu~h 
z = xa(y) = a(xy) 
The image of the second equality under gu gives 
ge(Z) 
= vH = guo~(xg) = fu(xy) 
Then 
Conversely, let yl and Y2 be elements of Y having the same image under a and uy. 
Then if u C U is such that fu(Yx) = uH, I have also 
fu(Y2) = guc~(y2) = gua(y,) = fu(Y,) = uH 
Then uy(yl)= (u,G(U, yl)) and ur(y2)= (u,G(u, ye)). These elements are equal if 
there exists h E H such that 
tt ~-- tth 
h-lG(tt, yl) = G(tt, y2) = G(tth, yl) = G(tt, yl) 
Then there exists x E G such that u = my and Y2 = my1. As moreover 
c~(y2) = c~(yl) , 
and as U.c~ is injective on the left orbits of G on U.Y, it follows that Y2 = Yl, which 
proves the lemma.

Let r : X --+ X' be a morphism of G-sets. If (K f) is an object of 19u(X), I denote 
by (Y', f') = 2)u,.(r 
f) = (Y, Cf) its image in Du(X'). As (r 
= fu, the sets 
U.Y and U.Y' are equal, and M(G\U.Y) identifies with M(G\U.Y'). Similarly, the 
u-disjoint H-sets over G\U.Y identify with u-disjoint H-sets over G\U.Y'. It follows 
that Qu(M)(Y,I) is naturally isomorphic to Qu(M)(Y',I'), i.e. 
Qu(M) ~ Qu(M) o Du,.(r

and to show that (C) is commutative, it suffices to show that 
M.(G\U.o~)M*(G\U.a) = M*(G\U.b)M.(G\U.c~') 
which will follow from the fact that, the square 
g.a

is cartesian, as the pull-back of a cartesian square. I will apply to this square the

Proof: Let Gz r G\Z and Gy' E G\Y' be such that 
(G\b)(Cz) : (C\~')(Oy') : Cb(z) : C~'(y') 
Then there exists an element g E G such that 9b(z) = b(gz) = c?(y'). So there exists 
a unique element y E Y such that

The previous lemma leads to the following definition: 
Definition: If X is a G-set, and M is a Mackey functor for H, I set 
s 
= 
lira 
Qu(M)(M, f) 
(v,f)Ov(x) 
If ~ : X ~

(Y',f')~u( x') 
Now if Gyl and Gy2 are elements of G\Y having the same image under G\a and G\a, 
I have 
Ga(yl) -- Ga(y2) 
Ga(yl) = Ga(y2) 
So there exists elements g and g' of G such that 
ga(yl) = a(y2) 
g'a(yl) = a(y2) 
The image under b of this relation gives 
a(yl)) 
Then as ~(y~) = a-~(y2), I have 
As a' is injective on the left orbits, I have g'g-la(y2) = a(y2), or 
g-la(y2) = a(g-ly2) = a(yl) = 9'-la(y2) 
As c~(y~) = a(g'-ly2), it follows that YI = g'-iY2, and then Gy~ = Gy2, completing 
the proof of the lemma.

I have finally built a natural transformation T e from Qu(M) to Qu(M) o D~(r 
so I have proved the following lemma: 
Lemma 9.3.4: If ~p : X

Proposition 9.4.1: The previous definitions turn s 
into a Maekey func- 
tot. 
Proof: It is clear that if 4) : X --+ X' and 0' : X' --+ X" are morphisms of G-sets, 
then 
s162 
= s163 
s162162 
= 12u(M)*(r163 
It is also clear that s 
and s 
are the identity morphisms. 
It suffices then to check axioms (M1) and (M2) for s 
I will start with (M2): 
let 
a 
Z 
---, 
T 
d 
be a cartesian square of G-sets. 
Notations: Let (E,e) be a G-set over Y • (U/H), and m E M(G\U.E). I denote 
by m.(E,~) the image of rn under the composite morphism 
M(G\U.~) --+ Qv(M)(E, ~) --+ &~(M)(Y) 
Furthermore, I denote by X ~ X the fimctor X ~-~ X • (U/H) from G-set to G-set. 
To compute Eu(M)*(a)(rn(z,~)), I fill the cartesian square 
C~ 
F 
, 
E 
X 
------+ 
Y 
The image of m(E,~) by s 
is then 
C~(M)*(a)(.~(~,~)) 
: M*(a\U.~)(,.)(Fj) 
The image of this element under s 
is 
s163 
= M*(G\U.a)irn)(FSf) 
On the other hand, the image of m(E,e) under ]~u(M).(c) is 
Z;v(M)~(c)(-~(u,~)) = m(u,~)

As the square

is cartesian, because it is composed of the previous one and of the cartesian square

l 
Z 
, 
T 
g 
the image under s 
of m(E,Te) is then 
s163 
= M*(G\U.~)(~)(F,;s) 
which proves that 
s163 
= s 
So s 
satisfies (M2). 
To check axiom (M1),I consider two G-sets X and Y, and their disjoint union 
Z = X LI Y. As 2 = X H,Y, it is clear that a G-set (E, e) over 2 is the disjoint union 
of a G-set (El, el) over X and a G-set (E2, ~2) over r. Then G\U.E is the disjoint 
union of G\U.E1 and G\U.E2. Let il and i2 be the respective injections from E1 and 
E2 into E. If rrz E M(G\U.E), let m~ = M*(G\g.il)(rn) and m2 
= M*(O\U.i2)(m). 
Then 
m = M.(G\U.i,)(ml) + M.(G\U.i2)(m2) 
I can view this equality in s 
as 
m(u,r : M.(G\U.it)(rnj(u,~) + M.(a\u.ij(m~)(u,~) 
But as i1 is injective, it is a morphism in 2)u(Z) from (E,, eh) to (E, e), and in 
s 
I have 
a,(G\U, il)(rrq)(E,e ) : (TI%I)(EI,eil) 
Now if ix is the injection from X to Z, I have 
(rftl)(El,eh) 
: s 
The same argument for is shows then that, denoting by iv the injection from Y to Z, 
I have 
/ 
% 
s 
M).(iy )((mj(E~,~)) 
In particular, the map (s 
Cu(M).(,r)) from Cu(M)(X) * C~(M)(Y) to 
s 
is surjective. The following lemma now shows that axiom (M1) holds for 
s 
and this completes the proof of the proposition.

CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
Lemma 9.4.2: Let L be a biflmctor on G-set, satisfying axiom (M2), and 
such that L({3) = {0}. If for any G-sets X and Y, the map 
(L.(ix), L.(iy)) : L(X) 9 L(Y) ---+ L(X I_I Y) 
is surjective, or the map 
L*(ix) | L*(iy) : L(X H Y) ~ L(X) | L(Y) 
injective, then L is a Mackey functor for G. 
Proof: Let 0 be the map (L.(ix),n.(iy)). As L satisfies (M2), as L(0) = {0}, and 
as the square 
1 
1 
Y 
, XHY 
iy 
is cartesian, the products L*(ix)L.(Q) and L*(ir)L.(ix) are zero. As ix is injective, 
the square 
Id 
X 
, 
X 
x 
, XLIY 
ix 
is cartesian. It follows that L*(ix)L.(ix) is the identity of L(X), and that L*(iz)L.(iv) 
is the identity of L(Y). 
Now the map r = L*(ix) | L*(iy) is such that r 
= 
IdL(x)eL(Y). Then 0r 
= 0, and r162 = 0- If 0 is surjective (resp. if r is injec- 
tive), the first (resp. the second) of these equalities implies 0r = IdL(xHz), so (M1) 
holds. This proves the lemma.

Lemma 9.5.1: This definition turns s

s 
(M.(G\U.a)(m)(z,f)) = OG,\uyM.(a)(m)(zd) = (M.(a)Oz(m))(v,/) = 0 
Moreover, if a: (Y,f) ~ (Z,g) is a morphism in Du(X), then

Theorem 9.5.2: Let G and H he finite groups, and U be a G-set-H. The 
correspondence 
V ~ Cu(M) 
0 E Homu~,ck(u)(M, M') ~ s 
C Homuack(a)(s 
s 
is a functor from Mack(H) to Mack(G), which is left adjoint to the functor 
NHNoU. 
Proofi It is clear that the correspondence M ~-~ 12u(M) is functorial in M. The main 
point is the adjunction property. 
So let M be a Mackeyfunctor for H, and N be a Mackeyfunctor for G. If0is 
a morphism of Mackey functors from M to N o U, then for any H-set Z, I have a 
morphism 
Oz : M(Z) --, (W o U)(Z) = N(U OH Z) 
In particular, if (Y, f) is a G-set over x • (U/H), I have a morphism 
o~\~.y : M(a\U.V) ~ N(u o,~ (G\U.V)) 
Composing this morphism with N*(ug) gives 
N*(uy)Oa\v.v : M(G\U.Y) ~ N(U cu (G\U.Y)) ~ N(Y)

CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
If (Z, a) is a u-disjoint H-set over G\U.Y, I have the diagram

N(U OH Z) 
, 
N(O) 
) 
M(a\U.Y) 
N(U oH (G\U.Y)) 
N(Y) 
This diagram is commutative: the left square is because 0 is a morphism of Mackey 
functors, and the right square is because (Z, a) is r-disjoint. It follows a morphism 
from Qu(M)(Y,f) to N(Y). Now I can compose this morphism with the morphism 
N.(fx) : N(Y) ---, N(X) deduced from f. 
If c~: (Y,f) ~ (Z,g) is a morphism in 7?u(X), I have the following diagram 
oG\v.y

Oa\u.z' N(UoH(G\U.Z)) 
N*(uz) N(Z) X.(gx)' 
N(X) 
The left square is commutative because 0 is a morphism of Mackey functors. The 
middle square is commutative by lemma 9.3.2 because N is a Mackey functor. The 
right square is commutative because gc~ = f. 
It follows a morphism ~bx from s 
to N(X). Now if r : X ~ X' is a 
morphism of G-sets, if (I/, f) is a G-set over X • (U/H), and if m E M(G\U.Y), then 
by definition of ~bx 
On the other hand 
Cx(m(y,j)) = N.(fx )N*(~'r )Oa\v.y(m)

SO 
Cx,s162

and then r163162

Conversely, if (Y', f') is a G-set over X' x (U/H), and if m' C M(G\U.Y'), then 
the image of mlg,,], ) under L:u(M)*(r is obtained by filling the cartesian square

More precisely, I have then

The image under ~bx of this element is by definition 
Cx Cu( M)*( r )(m{y,,f,)) = N.( f x )N*( uy )Oa\u.z M*( G\ U.a )(rn') 
As 0 is a morphism of Mackey functors, I have 
Oa\u.zV*(G\U.a) = X* (U OH (G\U.a))Oa\u.z, 
Moreover, as the square

N*(uy)N*(U OH (G\U.a)) = N*(a)N*(uz,) 
Furthermore, it is easy to see that the square 
a 
Y

X 
~ X' 
(9.1) 
is cartesian, and then N.(fx)N*(a) = N*(r 
). Finally, I can write equation 
(9.1) as 
N (d~)N.(f'x,)N (uy,)Oa\u.z,(m) 
~xs162

On the other hand 
Cx,(m(y,j,)) = W.(,f'~,)N'(~y,)Oawy,(,~') 
It follows that Oxf-.u(M)*(r 
= N*(r 
and this shows that the morphisms Cx 
define a morphism r of Mackey functors from Eu(M) to N. 
Conversely, let ~b be a morphism of Mackey functors from s 
to N. Then 
for any G-set X, I have a morphism ~bx from f-.u(M)(X) to N(X). In particular, 
if Z is an H-set, I have a morphism ~uoHz from f-.u(M)(U OH Z) to N(U OH Z) = 
(N o U)(Z). But if m c M(Z), then M*(vz)(m) e M(G\U.(U on Z)). Moreover, 
setting rrz(u,z) = ((u,z),uH), I define a morphism of G-sets fez from U OH Z to 
(U OH Z) • (U/H), and then U OH Z is an object of Du(U OH Z). In particular, I can 
consider the element 
Az(m) = M*(~z)(m)(vo.z,,~z) E f-.u(M)(U OH Z) 
Finally, I have the composite morphism

OzM*( r )(m') = ( N o U)*( r

Then U oH r is a morphism of G-sets over U oH Z' from (U OH Z,(U oH r

indeed, if (u,(u',z)) has the same image than g.(u,(u',z)) = (gu,(gu',z)), then 
gu = u and there exists h E H such that gu' = u'h and hS(z) = r

M.(b) (1 - M.(i)M*(i))M'(a) = M.(bj)i*(aj) 
But (II',bj) is a v-disjoint G-set over G\U.(U OH Z'). 
The image of M.(bj) in

Mac-Lane [10] chp. IV): if 0 is the identity of N o U, I must check that B o A(O) = O. 
Similarly, if ~b is the identity of s

A(O)x is defined by 
m(v,S) C s

Then B o A(O) is the endomorphism of N o U defined on an H-set Z by 
,~ 9 (N o U)(Z) H A(O)uo,,Z~z(,j 
Moreover I have here 
Az(n) = (N o U)*(~lz)(n)(uo,z.,z) = N*(U OH •z)(n)(Uo,Z.,z) 
So 
A(O)UogAz(n) : N.((~Z)Uonz) N*(uUo,z)N*(U OH ,z)(n) 
But (lrZ)UonZ is the identity of U OH Z. And as u and ~ are the unit and co-unit of 
the adjunction of Z ~-~ U OH Z and Y H G\U.Y, I have 
(U O H TIz)IIUoHZ = IduoHz 
So B o A(O) is the identity of N o U. 
Conversely, if ~b is the identity of s 
then B(~b) is the morphism from M to 
s 
o U defined on the H-set Z by 
m 9 M(Z) ~ Iz(m) 
The endomorphism A o B(~b) of s 
is then defined for a G set X, a set (Y, f) 
over X, and an element ra 9 M(G\U.Y) by 
re(v,]) C s

Aa\v.v(ra) = M*(Tlc\v.y)(m)(uon(a\u.z).,aw.r)

The 
functors 
Su(M) 
To build right adjoints, I need the following dual definition: 
Definition: If M is a Mackey functor for H, and (Y, f) is a G-set over Y/H, I set 
Su(M)(Y,f) = ~ 
KerM*(a) 
(Z,a) 
where the intersection runs over u-disjoint H-sets ( Z, a) over G\ U.Y . 
Lemma 9.6.1: The correspondence 
(Y, f) ~ Su(M)(Y, fu) 
c~ : (Y,f) ~ (Z,g) H M*(G\U.a): M(G\U.Z) ~ M(G\U.Y) 
induces a contravariant functor from Du(X) to R-Mod.

CHAPTER 9, ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
Proofi [ have seen that if a is a morphism in /Pu(X) from (K.f) to (Z,g), and if 
(T, a) is a u-disjoint //-set over C\U.Y, then setting/3 = G\U.c~, the H-set (T,/3a) 
is a u-disjoint set over G\UZ. Thus if m. E $u(M)(Z,g), then M'(fla)(rn.) = 0 = 
M*(a)M*(/3)(m), and this proves that M*(~3)(n~)is in 8u(M)(Y, f).

Lemma 9.6.2: If 4) : X ~ 
X ~ is a morphism of G-sets, then b induces an 
isomorphism 
S~ : 8u( M) o ~u,.( iJ) --+ 8u( M) 
and a natural transformation 
s ~ : &,(M) o z~.(+) -+ $~,(~.v~) 
Proof: The first assertion is clear: let (}, f) be an object of ID0-(X), and let (Y', f') = 
Du,.(4)(Y,f) = (Y, 4f). 
As (~f)u = fu, the sets U.Y and U.Y' coincide, and 
the u-disjoint sets over G\U.Y and G\U.Y' are the same. 
Thus Su(M)(Y, f) = 
S~,(M)(Y',y). 
For the second assertion, let (Y', ]") be an object of lPu(X'). I fill the cartesian 
square

M'(~')M.(C;\U.~)(,~) : M.(#)M'(~)(~.) = o 
and M.( G\ U.a ) induces a morphism S~,d, ) from 8u( M)(}s f) =$u( lVl)oD~r( ~ )( Y', f') 
to Su(M)(Y', f'). It remains to see that this construction is functorial in (Y', J"): but

and this equality follows from lemma 9.3.3. This proves the second assertion.

The functors

The previous section leads to the following definition, which is dual to the definition

i.e. a morphism ~u(M).(c~) from 7r 
to 7r 
Proposition 9.7.1: The above definitions turn T@(M) 
into a Mackey func- 
tor. 
Proof: It is clear that T~u(M) is a bifunctor on G-set. It suffices then to check 
axioms (M1) and (M2) of Mackey funetors. For (M2), let 
a 
X 
, 
Y

Z

T

be a cartesian square of G-sets. The module T@(M)(Z) identifies with the set of 
sequences rn(s,~/, indexed by the objects of Du(Z), such that m(E,~l E M(G\U.E), 
and such that 
:0 
whenever (T, a) is a u-disjoint H-set over G\U.E, and such that 
* 
? 
M (G\C.~)('~(F,~/) = m(E,~) 
if a is a morphism from (E, e) to (F, f) in the category Dr(X). 
The image under gv(M)*(b) of the sequence m(u,~) is the sequence m}F,i ) indexed 
by the objects of De(X), and defined by 
! 
~(F,f) = m(F,~i) 

208 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
The image under "R.u(M).(a) of this sequence is then the sequence ra{~,,y,) indexed 
by the objects of 2)u(Y), and defined by filling the cartesian square 
and setting

I! 
~(~,,:,) = M.(a\U.~)(.<.,:)) = M.(G\U.~)(m(F,~:)) 
On the other hand, the image under T@(M).(d) of the sequence m(E,~) is the sequence 
nlE,,r ) indexed by the objects of Z)u(T), defined by filling the cartesian square 
and setting 
E 
, E'

objects of ~Du(Y), defined by 
l]

n(F,,f,

r~(F,,cf,

As the squares 
C%

T

are cartesian, because they are composed of two cartesian squares, I have 
/ 
f 
'~(F,,~s,) = M*( O\ U~ )(~(F,~:)) 
so I have 7r 
= T@(M).(a)TCu(M)*(b), and (M2) holds. 
To check (M1), I observe as before that an object (E,e) in 7)u(XIjY) is the 
disjoint union of an object (El, el) of Igu(X) and an object (E2, e2) of/)u(Y). Let i~ 
and i2 be the respective injections from E1 and E2 into E. If m E gu(X L[ Y), and 
if (E, e) is a.n object of Du(X II Y), let r~ = m(Ed), and 
Tt 1 = M*(G\U.il)(n) 
7~2 = M*(G\U.i2)(n) 
so that n = M.(G\U.il)(n~) + M.(G\U.i2)(n2). 

9.8. 
RIGttT ADJUNCTION 
209 
As il is injective, it is a morphism in ~)u(XI_[Y) from (E~,fil) to (E,f). Thus 
rt 1 = m(Ex,fil). 
But I have a cartesian square 
il

which proves that fil = ix fl, and that 
Rv( M)*( ix )(m )(El,f,) = m(e,,i~ fl ) = m(E~,:i~) = n~ 
Similarly, for a suitable map f2, I have 
TCu(M)*(iy)(m)(E2,:~) = n2 
Then if 7r 
= 0 and 7r 
= O, I have nl = n2 = O, and then 
n = 0 for any (E,e), so m = 0. Then the map 
nu( M)*( ix ) | 7r 
M)*( iz ) 
is injective, and lemma 9.4.2 shows that ~u(M) is a Mackey functor.

Right adjunction 
Notation: If 0 : M ~ M ~ is a morphism of Mackey functors for the group H, and if 
X is a G-set, [ de/ine a map T~u(O)x from ~u(M)(X) 
to "Fgu(M')(X) by setting, for 
m C T@(M)(X), and fox" an object (Y,f) of~?u(X) 
~v(O)x (m)(r,s) = Oa\v.r (m(r,s)) 
Lemma 9.8.1: This definition turns T~v(O) into a morphism of Mackey func- 
tors from ~v(M) to 7~u(M'). 
Proof: First, the map Tgu(O) is well defined: if a : Z ~ G\U.Y is u-disjoint, then 
M*(a) T@(O)x(rrz)(rd) 
= M*(a)Oa\uy(m(rd)) = Oa\u.vM (a)( 
(rd)) = 0 
Moreover, if c~ : (Y,I) ~ (Z,g) is a morphism in Du(X), and if m E M(G\U.Z), 
then 
M*(~) (~(0)~(.~)(~,~)) : M*(~)O~\~.~(.~(~,~)) 
. . . .  
.... 
Oa\v.r M*( ~ )( m(z,~) ) = Oa\v.r(m(Y,S)) = ~r O)x(m)(yj) 
Now let ~ : X ~ X' be a morphism of G-sets. Then, if m' E Tgu(M)(X') 
~u(M)*(g))~u(O)x,(~')(r,f) 
= 7r

Theorem 9.8.2: Let G and H be finite groups, and U be a G-set-H. 
The 
funetor M ~ Tgu(M) is right adjoint to the funetor N ~ N o U. 
Proof: The proof is dual of the proof of theorem 9.5.2. Let 0 be a morphism of 
Mackey functors from M o U to N. Then for any H-set Z, I have a morphism 
Oz : (M o U)(Z) = M(U o. Z) ~ X(Z) 
In particular, if (Y, f) is a G-set over X • (U/H), I have a morphism 
Oc\u.y : M(U oH G\U.Y) --+ N(G\U.Y) 
Composing this morphism with M.(vy), I have a morphism 
Oa\u.yM.(vv) : M(Y) + M(U oH G\U.Y) + N(G\U.Y) 
If (Z, a) is a u-disjoint H-set over G\U.Y, I have the diagram

This diagram is commutative: the left square is because (Z, a) is u-disjoint, and the 
right square is because 0 is a morphism of Mackey functors. So this gives a morphism 
from M(Y) to Su(N)(Y,f), that can be composed with the morphism M*(fx) from 
re(x) to M(Y). 

9.8. RIGHT ADJUNCTION 
211 
If oe: (Y, f) -+ (Z,g) is a morphism in ~9~(X), I have the diagram

M(X) 
M*(fx) 
M.(uy) 
Oa\u.y 
The left square is commutative because gc~ = f. The middle square is commutative 
by lemma 9.3.2. The right square is commutative because 0 is a morphism of Mackey 
fimctors. 
So I have a morphism ex from M(X) to Tgu(N)(X). If 4) : X + X' is a morphism 
of G-sets, and if rn C M(X), then ~x(rn) is the sequence indexed by the objects (Y, f) 
of/?u(X) defined by 
~bx(m)(y,f) = Oa\urM.(ur)M*(fx)(m) 
Then 7~v(a).(4))Ox(m) is the sequence rn{r,,y, ) indexed by the objects of Du(X'), 
and defined by filling the cartesian square

More precisely 
m}y,,f,) = M.(G\U.a)(~bx (re)if, i)) = N.(G\U.a)OG\uyM.(py)M*(fx)(m) 
On the other hand, the element r 
is the sequence n(y,],) defined by 
As the square 
is cartesian, I have

Moreover as ~, o a ; (U o~ (GW.~))o ~Y, Ihave 
M.(~,)M.(a) = M.(U o. (C\U.a))M.(~) 
Finally as 0 is a morphism of Mackey functors, I have 
Oa\v.y,M. (U OH (G\U.a)) = N.(G\U.a)Oa\u.y 

212 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
and finally 
n(v,,l,) = N.(G\U.a)Oa\u.vM.(uv)M*(fx)(m) = m}v,4, ) 
This equality proves that 
7~v(M).(r 
= ~,x,M.(r 
Now if rn' E M(X'), then ~'x,(m') is the sequence indexed by the objects (Y', f') of 
Du(X'), defined by 
~x,(rn')(v, f,) = Oa\v.y,M.(uy,)M*(f~x,)(rrz ') 
Its image under 7r162 
is the sequence indexed by the objects (Y, f) of Du(X), 
defined by 
, 
= 
But (~f)x, = efx, and then 
(T@( M)*( r 
(y,f) = Oaxu.y M.(uy )M*(fx )M'( r 
= ~x (V*(r 
which proves that 
7r162 
= $xM*(r 
Thus ~b is a morphism of Mackey functors from M to ~u(M). 
Conversely, if ~b is a morphism of Mackey functors from M to 7~u(N), I have for 
any G-set X a morphism %bx from M(X) to "fCu(N)(X). In particular, if Z is an 
H-set, I hame a morphism 
~vo.z : M(U o. Z) -+ Tau(N)(U o. Z) 
An element of TQs(N)(U OH Z) is a sequence n(r,f) indexed by the objects of 7)u(U OH 
Z), with n(v,f) E N(G\U.Y). I can then consider the element 
and its image under N.OTz), which is an element of N(Z). I get a morphism Oz from 
M(U oH Z) = (M o U)(Z) to N(Z), defined by 
To prove that 0 is a morphism of Mackey functors, it suffices to observe that 0 is 
composed of the morphism ~/J o U from M o U to ~u(M) o U deduced from ~b, and of 
the morphism O from 7r 
o U to N, defined on the set Z by 
,~ ~ (T~u(X) o V)(Z) = 7r 
o. Z) ~ Oz(~) = X.(~z)(n(uo.a.~) ) 
It suffices then to prove that this is a morphism of Mackey functors. So let r : Z --* Z ~ 
be a morphism of H-sets. The element 
( ~( N) o u).( r )( ,, )(Vo,<Z,,~,~)

As rlz, (G\U.(U OH r

thus Oz, (7~u(N) o U),(r

Conversely, if n' E Tgu(N)(U OH Z'), then

N*(r

On the other hand (TZu(N) o U)*(r

It follows that

But I have already observed in the proof of theorem 9.5.2 that the morphism U OH r 
is a morphism in 7?u(U OH Z') from (U OH Z, ((U OH r

in Tgu(N)(U OH zr), I have

and lemma 9.5.3 shows that i is injective, and that if II = Ira(i) [I 11', denoting by j 
the injection from 11' into II, the set (II', bj) is v-disjoint. I have then 
N*(r 
Sz,) = N.(a)N*(b)(nluouz,,r 
.... 
....

As n' E Tgu(N)(U oH Z'), and as (II',bj) is v-disjoint, the second term is zero, and 
this gives 
N*(r 
= N.(ai)N*(bi)(nluo,Z,fz)) .... 
.... 
N.(..)N'(GW 
(Vo. 
Finally, I have proved that 
and O is a morphism of Mackey functors. 
To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to state that the correspondences 
A : 0 F-+ ~b and B : ~b ~-+ 0, which are clearly functorial in M and N, are inverse to 
each other. It suffices to check that if 0 is the identity, then so is (B o A)(O), and that 
if ~b is the identity, so is (A o B)(r 
Let 0 be the identity endomorphism of M o U, and ~b = A(O). If X is a G-set, the 
morphism ~bx from M(X) to 7r 
o U)(X) maps the element m C M(X) to the 
sequence '~bx (rn)(rj) defined by 
~x(rn)(r,]) = M.(vy)M*(fx)(m) e M(U OH (G\U.Y)) = (M o U)(GkU.Y) 
\ 
Then if O' = B(r 
I have for any H-set Z and any m E M(U oH Z) 
O'z(m ) = ( M o U).(7?z ) (ZbUo.z(m )(yo.z,,~z) ) 
which gives 
e'z(m) : M.(U oH 7lz)M.(vUouz)M* ((~rz)x)(m) 
But I have seen that (U OH rlz)VUo.Z is the identity map, as well as (Trz)x. Thus O} 
is the identity, and so is 0'. 
Now if ~b is the identity endomorphism of TCu(M), and if 0 = B(~b), then for any 
H-set Z and any 
m' C (Tiu(M) o U)(Z) = ~u(M)(U OH Z) 
I have 
If r = A(O), if m E Ru(M)(X), then r 
is the sequence indexed by the objects 
(I/, f) of Du(X) defined by 
r 
= Oa\u.yT~u(M).(vy)TCu(M)*(fx)(m) 

9.9. EXAMPLES

Setting m'= T~u(M).(uz)Tiu(M)*(fx)(m), I have then 
But nu(M)*(fx)(m) is the sequence n(E,e)indexed by the objects of T)u(Y), defined 
by 
n(E,e ) = m(E,~xe ) 
Moreover rn' is the image of n under Tiu(M).(uy). The component m}uo~(a\u.z),,~a\uy ) 
is then obtained by observing that if e is the morphism from Y to Y defined by 
e(y) = ((y, fu(Y)), then the square

As moreover fxe = f, I have then

As finally rla\u.z(G\U.uz ) is the identity map, I have r 
= re(y j). Thus ~' 
is the identity, which completes the proof of the theorem.

Remark: Let X be a G-set. The expression of the limit over :Du(X) shows that if 
M is a Mackey functor for G, then Tiu(M)(X) is the set of sequences m(gj), indexed 
by G-sets (Y, f) over X x (U/H), such that rn(y,f) E M(G\U.Y), and 
M*(a)(-~(y,s)) = 0 
whenever (Z, a) is a r-disjoint H-set over G\U.Y, and moreover 
m(zj) = M*(G\U.a)(m(y,j,)) 
whenever a : (Y, f) --+ (Y', f') is a rnorphism of G-sets over X • (U/H) which is 
injective on each G-orbit.

Examples 
9.9,1 
Induction and restriction 
Let G be a group, and H be a subgroup of G. If U is the set G, viewed as a G-set-H, 
then the fimctor N ~ N o U is the restriction functor for Mackey functors from G to 
H. 

216 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
As U/H = G/H, an object (Y,f) over U/H is of the form Ind~Z, with Z = 
f-l(H) (see lemma 2.4.1). An object of 7?u(X) is then an H-set Z, with a morphism 
from Ind/~Z to X, i.e. a morphism from Z to Res/~X. Moreover, the group G acts 
freely on U, so on U.Y. Thus if c~ is a morphism of G-sets over X x (U/H), then 
U.c~ is injective on each left orbit. In other words, the category 7?u(X) identifies with 
H-set~aes~X. 
Moreover, the set G\U.Y identifies with Z, by the map 
G(u,y) E G\U.Y H u-ly E g 
This map is indeed surjective, because if z E Z, then z is the image of G(1,z). 
Conversely, if u-ly = u'-ly ', then 
G(u, y) = G(u,uu'-ly ') = G(1, u'-~y ') = G(u', y') 
It follows that 
U OH (G\U.Y) ~- Ind~(G\U.Y) ~_ Ind/~Z ~_ Y 
and that vg is an isomorphism. Then if the H-set (T, a) over G\U.Y is v-disjoint, the 
image of U OH a is disjoint of the image of yr. As vy is surjective, I have U OH T ---- 0. 
But U OH T = Ind~rT, and then T = 0. 
In particular, I see that 
Qu(M)(Y, f) = M(G\U.Y) = M(Z) = Sv(M)(Y, f) 
As ReSaH X is a final object of 7?u(X), I see that 
Cu(M)(X) = 
lim 
M(Z) = M(Res~X) 
ze~u(x) 
As ReSaH X is an initial object of :Du(X) ~ I have also 
T@(M)(X) = M(ReSUH X) 
and the following isomorphisms follow easily: 
s 
~- Ind,(M) _~ Tiu(M) 
I recover that way the adjunction properties of induction and restriction. 
Now switching the roles of H and G, I consider V = G as an H-set-G. The functor 
N o V is then the induction functor for Mackey functors from H to G. As V/G =., 
an H-set (]I, f) over V/G is just an H-set, and V.Y = V • Y. The group H acts freely 
on V, so if a is a morphism of H-sets from Y to Z, then V.c~ is injective on each left 
orbit of H on U.Y (because h.u = u implies h = 1). The category :Dv(X) identifies 
then with H-setJ, x, and has a final object X. 
If Y is an H-set, then H\V.Y identifies with Ind~Y. Let (T,a) be a v-disjoint 
G-set over H\V.Y. If t E T and a(t) = H(v, y), then as G acts freely on V, I have 
(v, t) C V oG T, which contradicts the hypothesis on (T, a). So T = 13. 
In those conditions, it is clear that 
Lv(M) ~ Res~,(M) _~ 7~v(M) 
and I recover once again the adjunction properties of induction and restriction. 

9.9. EXAMPLES

9.9.2 
Inflation 
Let N be a normal subgroup of the group G, and H be the quotient G/N. If U is the 
set H, viewed as an H-set-G, then the functor M ~ M o U is the inflation functor 
for Mackey functors: indeed, if X is a G-set, then U oa X = X N. 
As U/G = *, an object of 7?u(X) is just an H-set over X. If (!/, f) is such a set, 
then U.Y = U • Y, and H\U.Y identifies with InkY. As H acts regularly on U, if 
~: (Y, f) ~ (Z,g) is a morphism of sets over X, then U.a is injective on each orbit 
of H on U.Y. So X is a final object in 7Pu(X), and then for any X, I have 
s 
= Qu(M)(X) 
~u(M)(X) = Su(M)(X) 
Furthermore as U oc (G\U.Y) = (In~Y) N _~ Y, the morphism uy is an isomorphism 
for any Y. 
So an object (T,a) over H\U.Y = In~HY is ,-disjoint if and only if 
U oa T = T N = O. Finally: 
Proposition 9.9.1: Let N be a normal subgroup of the group G, and H = 
GIN. If M is a Mackey functor for G, and X is an H-set, I set 
MN(x) = M(In~HX)/ ~ M.(a)M(T) 
(T,a) 
Mar(X) = ~ 
KerM*(a) 
(T.~) 
where the sum and intersection run over the G-sets (T,a) over InfaH X such 
that T N = O. 
If ~ : X --~ X' is a morphism 
of H-sets, then the maps M.(In~r 
and 
M*(In~r 
induce morphisms 
between MN(X) and MN(x'), and between 
Mar(X) and Mar(X'), which turn M N and MN into Mackey functors for H. 
The functor M ~-* M N is left adjoint to the functor L ~-~ In, L, and the 
functor M ~ MN is right adjoint to it. 
Remark: 
With the notations of Th~venaz and Webb (see [14], [15]), it is easy to 
identify M x with M +, and MN with M-: any set T such that Tar = 0 is indeed 
isomorphic to a disjoint union of sets of the form G/K, for N g K, and it follows 
easily that if L/N is a subgroup of H = G/N 
MN(L/N) = M(L)/~ tL-M(I() 
MN(L/N) = A Ker ri 
K 
where the sum and intersection run on the subgroups K of L (which give morphisms 
from G/K to G/L) not containing N. 
9.9.3 
Coinflation 
Let N be a normal subgroup of G, and H = G/N. Let V be the set H, viewed as a 
G-set-H. Then if Z is an H-set, the set V on Z identifies with In, Z, and the functor 
M H M o V is the functor that I have denoted by p~ (and denoted by fl! by Th6venaz 
and Webb see[15].5). 
Here again, the set V/H is trivial, so if X is a G-set, an object (Y,f) of Dr(X) is 
just a G-set over X. The set V.Y is the product 1/ x Y. Let c~ : (Y,f) ---, (Z,g) be a 

218 
CHAPTER 9. ADJOINT CONSTRUCTIONS 
morphism of sets over X. Then V.a is injective on the left orbits of G on V.Y if and 
only if the hypothesis 
imply gy = y. But the stabilizer in G of any point v of V is equal to N. Thus V.a is 
injective on the left orbits of G on V.Y if and only if c~ is injective on the orbits of N 
on Y. a morphism in l)v(X) from (Y,f) to (Z,g) is then a morphism a of sets over 
X, which is moreover injective on each orbit of N. 
Now the set G\V.Y identifies with N\Y. 
Then V OH (G\V.Y) identifies with 
InfaH(N\Y). The morphism uy maps y to its orbit Ny by N. 
In particular, it is 
surjective. So an object (T,a) over G\V.Y is ~,-disjoint if and only if V OH T = 
In~HT = ~, i.e. if T = ~. It follows that 
Qv(M)(Y, f) = M(N\Y) = Sv(M)(Y, f) 
Finally: 
Proposition 9.9.2: Let N be a normal subgroup of G, and H = G/N. 
If 
V is the set H, viewed as a G-set-H, and if X is a G-set, then :Dv(X) is 
isomorphic to the category which objects are the G-sets over X, and the 
morphisms are the morphisms of sets over X which are moreover injective 
on each orbit of N.

This map passes down to the quotient s 
if a: (Y,f) ~ (Z,g)is a

Conversely, to the element ,rz~ E ~C~(M)(K) I associate the image A'(rn) of rn 
in s 
corresponding to the G-set G/L --+ G'/K over G/K. This map is welt 
defined, because if L ~ L' then the projection G/L --+ G/L' is injective on N-orbits: 
indeed, if gL' = ngL' for n E N, then n g E L' N N = L Cl N, so gL = ngL. Similarly~ 
if k E K, then the conjugation G/L ~ G/kL is bijective, so it is injective on the 
N-orbits. 
If L C K, I can take {L} as a system of representatives of G\(G/L) for the 
computation of Ac/c, and then it is clear that AA' is the identity. 
Conversely, the isomorphism #y : I]l~es G/G~ --+ Y is an isomorphism of sets over

Remarks: 1) The set aaN(K) is seldom connected: indeed if L and L' are in the same 
connected component, then L N N = L' N N. For a subgroup J of K FI N, if I denote 
by co~,(J, K) the set of subgroups L of K such that L f3 N = J, then coN(J, K) is the 
connected component of coN(K) containing J, and I have the isomorphism

The left hand side of (10.2) can be written as

Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. If M and N are Mackey functors for 
H, proposition 10.1.2 shows that there are natural morphisms 
I will describe those morphisms explicit]y. Let P be a Mackey functor for G. I have

it is the image under @ of the 
identity map of s 
By adjunction, I have the morphism 
~M6N : M[~N ~ s 
o U 
that I already used in the proof of theorem theorem 9.5.2. It is defined for an H-set 
V by 
(M| 
(rlv)(t)(vouV,~v) 
The associated bilinear morphism is then defined for H-sets V and W by 
m E M(V), n E N(W)~ (M+N)*(,lv• 
w(m,n))(Uo.(V•215

where I set 
\ W /

Now this gives through q) a morphism fl'om N to ~(s

to the element 
p E [7-{(f~u(M),P) o U] (W)= HOmM~k(c)(s 
obtained by adjunction from the element 
which maps the element m E M(V) to the element rv, w(m, n) of s 
OH

U 
Now the definition of P*(@,w) for P = f~u(M@N) shows that 
Then if X is a G-set, and (S, f) is an object of 7?u(X), the morphism p maps the 
element m E M(G\U.S) to 
P.(fx x Iduo.w)P*(v(s,]) • Iduo.w)ra\u.s,w(m,n) E PUo.w(X) 
This morphism fl'om N to 7-g(f-.u(M),P) oU gives by adjunction a morphism from 
s

as follows: if Y is a G-set, if (T,g) is an object of Du(Y), and if n E N(G\U.T), then

u, u' E U such that fu(s) = uH and gu(t) = u'H. Then 
(.(s,s)-~(~,.))(~, t, u"H) = ((~, a(~,.)), (~', a(~', t)) 
Furthermore, let (u,, G(u2, so), a(u3,to)) e g oH [(G\U.S) x (G\U.T)]. Its image

It is equal to (u(Sj)~'U(r,g))(s, t, u"H) if and only if

a(u2, So) = a(~h, ~)

a(~3,to) = a(~'h,t) 
u"H = ~H 
In those conditions, I have 
uH = ulH = u'H = u"H 
and then fu(s) = gu(t). Thus (s, t) is in the pull-back of S and T over U/H. 
Notations: If (S, f) and (T,g) are G-sets over U/H, I denote by S.T their pull- 
back over U/H. If s E S and t E T are such that (s,t) ~ S.T, I denote by s.t the 
couple (s,t), and G.s.t its orbit by G. Is X and Y are G-sets, if ( S, f) is a G-set over

Z = X x (U/H), and (T, g) is a G-set over ? = Y x (U/H), I denote by f.g the map 
from S.T to X x Y x (U/H) defined by 
With these notations, I can define a map 
~_ : S.T --* U OH [(GkU.S) • (G\U.T)] 
by setting 
a(~.t) = (u, Cm.s,G.u.t) 
if fu(s) = gu(t) = uH 
Indeed, if h 6 H is such that uh = u, then 
h( a.~,.s, a.u. 0 = (a.~,h -~.s, 6'.~,h -~.t) = (a.u.s, G.u. 0 
Thus a(s.t) 6 U OH [(G\U.S) x (G\U.T)]. And if I replace u by uh, then 
(uh, G.uh.s, C.uh.t) = (uh, h-lC.u.s, h-lG.u.t) = (tt, O.tt.8, C.tl.t) 
I have also a map/3 from S.T to S'~T, defined by 
It is clear that the square

is commutative. The previous argument shows that the associated map i from S.T to 
F is surjective. As/3 is injective, and factors through i, it follows that i is injective. 
Thus F is isomorphic to S.T, and the above square is cartesian. 
In those conditions, I have

(U/H).Y with Y, and G\U.((U/H).Y) with G\U.Y, and U.(U/H) with U, the map 
U 
~U/H,Z is the map

The previous arguments, in the case M = A, show that Z;u(A) is a Green functor (it

If 0 : A ~ B is a unitary morphism of Green functors from A to B, then 0 induces

Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. Let moreover A be a Green functor for 
the group H. In the proof of theorem 9.5.2, I have considered the morphism deduced 
by adjunction from the identity morphism of s 
It is the morphism 
AA : A ~ s

defined as follows: if Z is an H-set, then (U OH Z, ~rz) is an object of 7)u(U OH Z). If 
a 6 A(Z), then 
A*(qz)(a) e A(G\U.(U OH Z)) 
and I set 
,~A,Z(a) = A*(rlz)(a)(vo~z,~z) 
Similarly, if M is an A-module, I denote by /~M the morphism of Mackey funct-or-s- 
M ~ s 
o V. The module s 
is an s 
so the module s 
o U 
is an s 
o U-module. In those conditions:

It follows in particular that the morphism AA is a morphism of Green functors 
from A to s 
o A, non unitary in general: indeed, by definition 
AA,.(CA) = A*(rl.)(cA)(uo, .... ) 
Identifying U OH 9 with U/H, the map ~r. is the diagonal injection from U/H into 
U/H • U/H, and r/. is the (unique) morphism from G\U.(U/H) "~ G\U to., that I 
denote by pa\u. Thus 
AA,.(eA) = A*(pa\u)(U/H,~.) 
On the other hand, the unit of s 
o U is by definition 
f--u(A)*(PU/H)(eCv(A) = f~u(A)*(PU/H)(A*(pa\u)(CA)(U/H,H))

which is not equal to )~A,.(CA) in general. 
Notation: If N is an s 
the module N o U is an s 
o U module, 
which gives an A-module by restriction along AA, that I will denote by xoglA , defined 
on the H-set Z by 
(N o UtA)(Z ) = ~..(eA) • (N o U)(Z) C_ (N o U)(Z) 
where the product in the right hand side is the product of N o U as an s 
o U- 
module. 
Proposition 10.4.2: Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. Let A be 
a Green functor for H. Then the correspondence 
N ~ NOUIA 
is a functor from s 
to A-Mod, which is right adjoint to the funetor 
M ~ Co-(M). 
Proof: It is clear that the correspondence N ~ N o UIA is a functor, because it is 
composed of the functor N ~ N o U and of the functor of restriction to A along tA- 
I must then prove the adjunction property. 
Let ~ be a morphism of s 
modules from s 
to N. Then ~ o U is a morphism of s 
o U-modules from 
s 
o U to N o U. Restricting along I, I obtain a morphism ~b o UIA of A-modules 
from s 
o UiA to N o UIA. But lemma 10.4.1 shows that the morphism from M 
to s 
o UIA is a morphism of A-modules. Composing with ga o UIA , I obtain a 
morphism 0 of A-modules from M to N o UIA. 
The square

HomA(M, N o U]A)

HomM~&(a)( s 
M ), N) 
HomMack(H)(M, N o U) 
is commutative: indeed, any homomorphism 0 from M to N o U which is compatible 
with the product of A is a morphism of A-modules from M to N o UIA , since if Z is 
an H-set, and if m 6 M(Z), then 
OZ(~Tt ) = OZ( s A X TrZ) = /~A,.(gA) xU OZ(fO') C7_ ( N o UIA)( Z ) 
It follows that the correspondence ~ H 0 defined above is injective. 
Conversely, if 6 is a morphism of A-modules from M to NOUIA , then I can compose 
0 with the inclusion N o UIA ~ N o U, and obtain by duality a morphism of Mackey 
functors ~b from s 
to N. If I know that ~b is a morphism of s 
the 
proposition will follow. 
Let X be a G-set. If (I/, f) is an object of 2)u(X), and if m 6 M(G\U.Y), then 
by construction of ~b, I have 
~x(rn(y,f)) = N,(fx )N*(y(gj))Oa\u.y(m)

N*(u(y,f))OG\u.y(a.m) = ay, dy.N*(u(yj))OGku.y(m) 
where the product in the right hand side is the product "." for the s

Proof: I denote by Z the set G\U.Y. If 0 E HomA(M,N o UjA), then

Let then X' be a G-set. If (Y', f') is an object of Du(X'), and if a E A(G\U.Y'),

a(z,j,) x ~bx(rn(z,f)) = a(z,,s,) x N.(fx)N*(utz,]))Oa\u.z(m) 
(10.5) 
Moreover, setting dz, =

a(g,j,) = s 
As N is an s 
equality (10.5) becomes

Let e be the unit of the ring (A(G\U.Y),.), equal to 
e ---- A*(pG\u.y)(eA) 
denoting by PG\u.Y the unique morphism from G\U.Y to .. Then by lemma 10.4.3

Right adjoints and tensor product 
Let G and H be groups, and U be an H-set G. If M is a Mackey functor for H, and 
P is a Mackey functor for G, I have built morphisms 
(s 
M)&2P) o U ~ M~( P o U) 
In the case P = Tiu(N), for a Mackey functor N for the group H, I have in particular 
a morphism 
Composing this morphism with the morphism 
M+(Ru(N) o U) ---+ M~N 
deduced from the co-unit gu(N) o U --* N, I obtain a morphism 
o u 
M~N 
By adjunction, I have a morphism 
A tedious computation shows that this morphism can be described as follows: 
Notation: Let G and H be groups, and U be an H-set G. If X is a G-set, if (Z,f) 
and (T, g) are objects of Du(X), [ denote by Z~T their pullback over X 
Z~T= {(z,t) 9 a • T If(z) = g(t)} 
I denote by z~t the couple (z, t) of Z~T. I denote by f~g the map from Z~T to X 
defined by 
(f~g)(z~t) = f(z) = g(t) 
Definition: [[ M and N are Maekey functors for H, if X is a G-set, if (Z, f) is 
an object of Du(X), if m 9 M(G\U.Z), and if n E TCu(N)(X), I define a sequence 
Ox(a(y,f),n)(w,g ) indexed by the objects (T,g) of Du(X), such that Ox(a(y,l),n)(r,g) C 
(M~N)(G\U.T), by setting 
Ox(a(rd),n)(r,g) = [M* ( G'u'(z~t) ~ (m) | n(zbrd~g)] 
"~ ( ~,).

J(G\U.(ZbT),( ~:~, )) 
Lemma 10.5.1: The previous equality defines a bilinear map 
Ox :

u(N)(X) --, 
Proof: First I must check that Ox is well defined. So let (S, a) be a u-disjoint H-set 
over G\U.Z, and let m 9 M(S). Then

Lemma 10.5.2: The maps Ox define a bilinear morphism from s

Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. If A is a Green functor for H, then 
s

Lemma 10.6.1: Let X be a G-set, let (Z, f) be an object of Du(X), and 
a C A(G\U.Z). 
If m E Tgu(M)(X), the above product is such that for any 
object (T, g) of 7?u(X) 
(a(zj).m)(r,g) = M* {G.u.(z~')] 
{G.u.(z~t)] 
where the product in the right hand side is the product "." for the A- 
module M.

is a functor from 
A-Mod to s 
which is right adjoint to the functor N ~ N o UIA. 
Proof: I already know that the correspondence M ~ gu(M) is a functor between the 
categories of Mackey functors. Moreover, if r : M --+ M' is a morphism of A-modules, 
then the morphism Ru(r 
is given for a G-set X, an element m E 7r

an object (T,g) of Du(X) by

Let 0 be amorphismof A-modules from NOUIA to M. As NOUIA is a direct 
summand of N o U as Mackey fnnctor, I have a morphism O' of Mackey functors from 
N o U to M, defined on the H-set Z by 
0 (m) =

By adjunction, it correspond to 0' a morphism r of Mackey functors from N to 
Tiu(M), defined as follows: if X is a C-set and (r,g) an object of 7)u(X), and if 
n E N(X), then

Thus 
~(n)(T,~) = 0a\U.T(AA,.(CA) •

CHAPTER I0. ADJUNCTION AND GREEN FUNCTORS 
10.8 
Examples and applications 
10.8.1 
Induction 
and 
restriction 
Let G be a group, and H be a subgroup of G. Let U be the set G, viewed as a 
G-set-H, and V be the set G, viewed as an H-set-G. Then I know that if A is a 
Green functor for G, the functors A o U and s 
are both equal to the restriction 
of A to H. It is not clear a priori that the products defined on A o U and s 
are 
the same. 
But they are: the isomorphism 
s 
~- Res~A(X) 
comes from the fact that the category Dr(X) identifies with H-setSx, which has a 
final object (X, Id). Moreover, the set H\V.X identifies with IndeX. If a and a' are 
elements of A(Ind~X), then 
But obviously X~X = X, so 
a(X,ld).a~X,ld) 
= a,a{x,id) 
and the product of L;v(A) ~s the product of Res~A. 
A similar argument shows that if B is a Green functor for H, then the products 
defined on 
s 
~- Ind~B ~- B o V 
are the same. 
10.8.2 
The 
case U/H =. 
Proposition 10.8.1: Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. 
following conditions are equivalent: 
The 
1. The group H is transitive on U, i.e. U/H = .. 
2. For any Green functor A for H, the morphism 
/~A : A ~ s 
o U 
is unitary. 
3. The functor A H Cu(A) from Green(H) to Green(G) is left adjoint to 
the functor B H B o U. 
Proof: I recall the formulae 
AA,.(r 
= A*(Pa\u)(r 
r 
= A*(pa\u.(U/H)2)(eA)((U/H)2,H) 

10.8. EXAMPLES AND APPLICATIONS 
265 
Moreover, as 7to is the diagonal injection from U/H to (U/H) 2, it is a morphism from 
(U/H, rr.) to ((U/H) 2, Id) in the category Z)u(U/H). So in s 
I have also 
AA,.(~A) = A.(rc~ 
If 1) holds, then U/H ~_ (U/H) ~ _~., and in this case 
~A,.(e A) = ec~(a)o~ 
so 2) holds. Conversely if 2) holds, then for any Green functor A for H and any 
s 
N, I have 
NoUIA = NoU 
Then 
HomA(A, N o UFA ) ~_ (N o U)(.) = N(U/H) "z_ ttomLv(A)(s 
N) ~ N(.) 
Taking for A the Burnside functor b, and for N the module f~g(b) ~- bv/u, this gives 
b(U/H) ~_ b((V/H) ~) 
But (U/H) 2 is the disjoint union of its diagonal, isomorphic to U/H, and of its 
complement C in (U/H) 2. Then the above isomorphism shows that b(C) = 0. But 
the only set X such that b(X) = 0 is the empty set. Then U/H ~- (U/H) 2, and 
U/H ~., so 1) holds. 
Now if 3) holds, then as s 
is the unit of the adjunction, it is a unitary morphism 
of Green functors. So 2) holds. 
And if 2) holds, then to prove 3), I must prove that the unitary morphisms of 
Green functors from s 
to B are sent by adjunction to unitary morphisms of 
Green flmctors from A to B o U, and conversely. But if g5 is a unitary morphism of 
Green functors from s 
to B, then 05 o U is a unitary morphism of Green functors 
from s 
o U to B o U. Composing this morphism with hA, which is a unitary 
morphism of Green functors by hypothesis, I obtain the morphism from A to B o U 
which is associated to r hence this is a unitary morphism of Green functors. 
To prove the inverse correspondence, it suffices similarly to prove that the co-unit 
of the adjunction 
0 : s 
o U) -, B 
is a unitary morphism of Green functors. But if X is a G-set, as U/H =., the objects 
of 9 
are just the G-sets over X. Let (Z, f) be such a set, and b e (BoU)(G\U.Z) 
(furthermore the set U.Z is equal to U x Z in this case). Then 
Ox(b(z,f)) = B.(f)B*(l,z)(b) 
The unit of s 
o U) is by definition 
scv(BoU) = (BoU)*(pa\u)(S,oC~)(u/udd) = B*(UoHpa\u)B*(p~s/H)(SB)(.,Id) .... 
.... B*(PUoMa\U))(SB)(.,Id) 
So 
o.(c~(sov)) 
= B.(Id)B*(,.)B*(pVo,(G\v))(~,) 
= B'(p.)(c,) 
= ~ 

266 
CHAPTER 10. ADJUNCTION AND GREEN FUNCTORS 
Thus O is unitary. It remains to see that it is a morphism of Green functors. So let 
Y be a G-set, let (T, g) be a set over Y, and let b' E B(G\U.T). Then 
i 
: 
B. 
[

Ox•

Let moreover u be any element of H. Then 
SO 
Finally 
Ox• 
• b~T,g)) = B.(f x g)B'(v'z x .T)(b x b') .... 
.... 
B.(f)B*(v'z)(b) x B.(g)B*(V'T)(b') = @x(b(z,y)) x Oy(b(T,g)) 
Thus O is a unitary morphism of Green functors. The proposition follows. 
10.8.3 
Adjunction and Morita contexts 
Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. Let A be a Green functor for H, and 
M be a module-A. If N is a Mackey functor for H, then /-/(M, N) has a natural 
structure of A-module (see proposition 6.4.2), defined as follows: if X and Y are 
H-sets, if a E A(X) and 
r E TI(M, N)(Y) = HomM~k(H)(M, Ny) 
then a x r is the morphism from M to Nx• 
defined for an H-set Z and m E M(Z) 
by 
(a • r 
= Czxx(m x a) e N(Z • X • Y) = Nx• 
The Mackey functor s 
has also a structure of module-/:v(A). Then if P is 
a Mackey functor for G, the functor ~(s 
is an s 
So the 
module "H(s 
is an s 
By restriction along the morphism 
AA : A ~ s 
o U, I obtain an A-module 7Y(s 
P) o UIA. 
On the other hand, the functor 7-t(M, P o U) is also an A-module. I have built 
morphisms of Mackey functors from ~(M, P o U) to 7-l(s 
P) o U. It is natural 
to ask if these morphisms are compatible with the product of A. 
Proposition 10.8.2: Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. Let A be 
a Green functor for H, and M be a module-A. If P is a Mackey functor, 
then the morphisms 1-t(M,P o U) ~ "H(s 
o U induce isomorphisms 
of A-modules 
TI( M, P o U)

Proof." Let O be the morphism from "H(M, P o U) to ~(s 
P) o U. If I prove 
that O is compatible with the product of A, then as the module in the left hand side 
is unitary, the image of O will be contained in ~(s 
P) o UIA. 
So let X and Y be H-sets. Let a E A(X) and 
r E I~(M, P o U)(Y) = gomMack(H)(M, (P o U)y) 
Then let 
= O(c~)E [~(s 
(Y)= HomM=ck(a)(s 
If S is a G-set, and (T,g) is an object of Du(S), and if rn E M(G\U.T), then the 
image |162 
is given by the following diagram 
. 
.~+,~> • M~o< P(r • (Cro. Y)) '~ • ~~ 
P((x • (Vo. Y)) 
In other words, denoting by 7 the functor from H-set to G-set$u/H defined by -y(X) = 
U OH X, and co its left adjoint, defined by co(T) = G\U.T, I have 
U 
~s(rn(T,g)) = P.(gs • Id~(z))P*(u(r.g) x Id.~(y))P.(5~(r),y)r 
) 
To simplify this expression, I filI the cartesian square 
C~ 
r 
, 
~(co(r) • r) 
r • 7(Z) 
, ~co(r) • ~(Y) 
U(r,g) • Ida(y) 
Let (t, u, y) E T x 3'(Y). If u' E U is such that gu(t) = u'H, then 
Let (ul,G.u2.t,,y,) e 7(w(T) x Y). Then 
6wU(T),y(ttl, a'U2"tl, ~]1) = ((?/1, a'tt2"tl), (~1, Yl)) 
Those images are equal if and only if 
(~t', ~.~".t): (Ul, a.tt2.tl) 
(tt, y) : (ttl,Yl) 
This is equivalent to say that there exists h, h ~ C H such that 
ul = u~h 
G.u~.tl = G.u~h.t 
uh ~ = Ul 
htyl = y 
It follows in particular that u~H = ulH = uH. Moreover uh' = u'h, thus 
(ul, ~.t~2.tl, Yl) : 
(uh', G.ulh.t, yl) = 
(tth', G.uhl.t, yl) = (u, G.u.t, h'yl) = 
(tt, G.u.t, y) 

268 
CHAPTER 10. ADJUNCTION AND GREEN FUNCTORS 
Then the element (t, u, y) is in T.7(Y). If C~T,y is the map from T."/(Y) to 3' (w(T) x Y) 
defined by 
~r,r(t,~,y) 
= (~, a.~.t,y) 
I have C~T,y(t, u, y) = (ul, G.u>tl, yt). If moreover/~r,y is the inclusion from T.~/(Y) 
into T x "~(Y), then the square 
sT,y 
• Y) 
T x "~(Z)

l/(T,g ) X Id~(z) 
is commutative. The above argument shows that the associated morphism s from 
T."/(Y) to F is surjective. As 13z,y factors through s, the morphism s is also injective. 
Thus F is isomorphic to T."/(Y). 
In those conditions, I can write 
~Ss(m(T,g)) = P.(gs • Id-r(Y))P.(•T,Y)P*(aT,Y)r 
As the composite map 
(gs x Id,(y)) o/3T,y 
is nothing but (g.rry)sx~(y), I have finally 
On the other hand, if Z is an H-set, and if m' C M(Z), then

It follows that 
O(a x r

The image of a under An is the element

Now the map r is

In this form, It is easy to check that this equality defines a morphism of Mackey

Thus if M is a Mackey functor for G, I have

Proposition 10.8.6: Let G and H be groups. If A and B are Green functors 
for G, if (P,(2,~, tit) is a surjective Morita context for A and B, then for

context for A(H) and B(H). 

Chapter 11 
The simple modules 
11.1 
Generalities 
Let A be a Green functor for the group G. Theorem 3.3.5 states the equivalence 
between the category of A-modules and the category of representations of C.4. I can 
in particular apply to A-Mod the generalities on representations of categories proved 
in [3]. In particular, the simple A-modules can be described as follows: 
Proposition 11.1.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. 
1. If X is a G-set, and V is a simple module for the algebra EndeA(X) = 
A(X2), then the module Lx,v defined by 
Lx,v(Y) = A(YX) •A(x2) V 
has a unique maximal submodule Jx,v, defined by 
Jx,v(Y) = {~i ai| 
'Vr 
A(XY), ~-~.(r 
a,).vi =O } 
i 
The quotient Sx,y = Lx,y/Jx,v is then a simple module. 
2. Conversely, if S is a simple A-module, and if X is a G-set such that 
S(X) r O, then the module V = ,q'(X) is a simple A(X2)-module, and S 
is isomorphic to Sx,v. 
Proof: The first assertion follows from [3]. The second is not stated there explicitly, 
but it is a consequence of the following argument: if W is a non-zero A(X2)-submodule 
of S(X), then by adjunction there is a non-zero morphism from Lx,w to S, which 
is onto since S is simple. Then as Lx,w(X) = W, it follows that l/V = S(X), thus 
S(X) is a simple A(X2)-module. Then ,5" is a simple quotient of Lx,s(x), which has a 
unique simple quotient Sx,s(x). Thus S _~ ,5'x,s(x).

11.2 
Classification of the simple modules 
In the special case of a functor on CA, I have moreover the notion of minimal subgroup: 
a subgroup H of G is called minhna/for the functor F on CA if F(G/H) r O, but 

276 
CItAPTER 11. THE SIMPLE MODULES 
if F(G/K) = 0 for any subgroup K of C of strictly smaller order. Such a subgroup 
always exists if F is non-zero, since F is additive. 
Let S be a simple A-module, and II be a minimal subgroup for S. 
Let K a 
subgroup of G such that 1Is < iH[, and ~) be an element of A((G/H) 2) which factors 
through G/K in Ca, i.e. such that. 
: 
oG/K/7 
for 
C A(r 
x (r 
/9 
• IC,/H)) 
Then setting P = G/H, and V = S(F), I have the following equality in Lr,v(F) = V 
for v E V 
1A(r~) | r 
= r | v = (c~ %./~,- ~3) q) v = Sr.v(a)(/7 @ v) 
But as H is minimal for S, the element/7 @ v of S(K) is zero. So the element 4.v is 
zero. 
Thus the module V is annihilated by any endomorphism of F which factors by a 
set G/Is such that IKI < IHI. 
Notation: Let A be a Green [unctor, and H be a subg~'oup of G. I denote by ]~(H) 
the quotient of A((G/H) 2) by the two-,sided ideal generated by the elements of the 
fo~m ~ oa/s, 17, fo~ IKI < IHI. 
With this definition, I have the following classification 
Proposition 11.2.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. 
1. If S is a simple A-module, and H is a minimal subgroup for S, then 
V = S(H) is a simple A(H)-module, and S is isomorphic to Sc./Hy. 
2. Conversely, if H is a subgroup of G, and V is a simple/i(H)-module, 
then Sa/~,v is a simple A-module, the group H is minimal for Sc,,/u,v, 
and moreover Sa/H,v(H) ~- V. 
3. Let H be a subgroup of G, and V be a simple /i(H)-module. 
If X 
is a G-set such that Sa/H,v(X) r 0, then X u r ~. In particular, the 
minimal subgroups of Sc,/H.v are the conjugates of H in G. 
4. Let H and K be subgroups of G. If V is a simple A(H)-module, and 
if W is a simple /t(K)-module, then the modules Sc,/s,v and ,5'c,/r,,w 
are isomorphic if and only if there exists x E G such that K = XH and 
W ~V. 
Remarks: a) I have identified a A(H)-module V with the associated .4((g/H)2) - 
module. 
b) The notation W _~ ~V means that V maps to W by the isomorphism c:~,. fi'om 
G/H to G/K in CA, deduced from the conjugation c~: : G/H --+ G/K defined by 
c~(g.H ) = 9z-I.K. 
Proof: I have already proved assertion 1). For assertion 2), I already know that 
if V is a simple /t(H)-modnle, viewed as an A((G/H)2)-module, then ScUH,v is a 

i1.2. CLASSIFICATION OF THE SIMPLE MODULES 
277 
simple A-module such that SH,v(H) "z_ V. It remains to show that H is minimal 
for Sa/u.v. So let K be a subgroup of G such that IKI < Igl. 
Let a | v be an 
element of La/n,v(K). Then a | v E Ja/n,v(K): indeed, if r C A((G/H) x (G/K)), 
then r oa/K a factors through G/K, so annihilates V. Thus a | v E Ja/H,v(K), and 
Sc/I~,V(K) = O. 
Under the hypothesis of assertion 3), there exists a G A(X x (G/H)) and v C V 
such that a | v is non-zero in Sa/n,v(X). 
In particular, there exists an element 
E A((G/H) x X) such that 6 ox a has non-zero action on V, so does not factor 
through sets G/K such that IK[ < IH[. But 
Lemma 11.2.2: Let X and Y be G-sets, and a C A(XY). Let 
b = A. 
xy 
(a) C A(YXY) = Hornc~(Y, YX) 
c = 
E Hornc~(YX, X) 
yxy 
x 
. 
Then a = c ovx b in Ca. 
Admitting this lemma for a while, I see in particular that a factors in CA through 
(G/H) x X, and so does r 
a. As 
(a/H) • x 
II 
n 
xEG\X 
g~H\G/Gx 
I see that there exists x and g E G such that [H N G~I = Igl, and then gx C X H, 
which proves that X H r O. Then if K is another minimal subgroup of Sa/H,v, and 
if W = Sc/~,v(K), I know that Sa/H,V ~-- Sc/K,w. The group K has fixed points on 
G/H, and H has fixed points on G/K, so K is conjugate to H. This proves assertion 
3). 
Under the hypothesis of assertion 4), the group K is minimal for SC/H,V, so it is 
conjugate to H. I can then suppose H = K, and the proposition follows then from 
the fact that V ~ Sa/H,v(H) ~- SG/H,w(H) ~ W.

11.3 
The structure of algebras A(H) 
Having classified the simple A-modules, 1 have still to describe the structure of the 
algebras /i(H): 
Notations: Let K be a group acting by automorphisms on ~n R-algebra A. I denote 
by A | K the tensor product A | 
RK, with the following multiplication 
(a | k).(a' | k') = ak(a') Q kk' 
If H is a subgroup of G, [ denote by NG(H) the quotient No(H)/H. 
Proposition 11.3.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. If H is a 
subgroup of G, then A(H) identifies with 5.(H) | No(H), by the map 
c~ E A((G/H) 2) ~ 
~ 
A*(iH,~,.)(c 0 | n 
~(H) 
where iH,n,H : G/H -'~ (G/H) 2 maps gH to (gH, gnH). 
Proof: By definition, I have 
A((G/HT)) ~-

A(H n'H)

xEH\G/H 
iH,x,H : G/(H ~ ~H) ~ (G/H) 2 
defined by 
ig,~,H(g(H M ~H)) = (gH, gxg) 
The inverse isomorphism maps the element fl E A(H N ~H) to A.(ig,.,g)(fl). But if 
x • No(H), then m.(iH,x,u)(fl) factors through G/(H N ~H): 
where ill,z, H is the map

If K is a proper subgroup of H, and if ~ = tH(y), for 7 ~ A(I(), then denoting by 
7r H the projection from G/K to G/H, I have 
A.(iH,~,H)(/~) z A.(iH,,~,H o ~rH)(?) 
Lemma 11.2.2 shows that this element factors through G/K, and its image under ~r

It follows that 0 is a morphism of algebras from A.(H) | Na(H) to /~(H). 
This 
morphism is moreover unitary, since the unit of A(H) | Na(H) is e~-]-ff N 1, which is 
mapped to 
Conversely, if a E A((G/H)e), 
and if n e -No(H) I can consider the element

If a factors through Y = G/I<, then setting X = G/H, 
there exists b E A(XY) and c E A(YX) such that a = boy c. Then for n E No(H), I

then for any c~ r A(XY), the element A. (7)(c~)is a linear combination of elements 
of the form tHHn~Kag. If the order of K is strictly smaller than the order of H, the 
groups YNgI( are proper subgroups of H, and it follows that the image of A. (7) (c0 
in J.(H) is zero. 
So I have a morphism r from/~(H) to A(H) | -Na(H), defined by

The only non-zero product A*(iH,n,H)A.(iH,~.H) corresponds to n' = n, and it is equal 
to the identity of A(H). It follows that r 
is the identity, so that 0 is injective, hence 
an isomorphism. Then r is the inverse isomorphism, which proves the proposition. 9

CHAPTER 11. THE SIMPLE MODULES 
11.4 
The structure of simple modules 
I know that the isomorphism classes of simple modules can be indexed by the con- 
jugacy classes of couples (H,V), where H is a subgroup of G, and V is a simple 
ft.(H) | Na(H) module. 
G 
Notation: I will denote by SHy or SHy (instead of SO/H,V) the module associated 
to the couple (H, V). 
The module V can be viewed as 7VG(H)-module, by the homomorphism n 
eC/H | n from No(H) to A(H) | NG(H). Then denoting by [Y] the permutation 
module associated to a set Y, with the set Y as a basis, I have the 
Proposition 11.4.1: Let H be a subgroup of G, and V be a simple A(H) @ 
~Tg(H)-module. If X is a G-set, then IX H] is a JVG(H)-module, and 
S~,v(X) ~- Horn(IX'], V)~ G<m 
It is the set of morphisms of Nu(H)-modules from [X H] to V which factor 
through a projective module. 
If f : X -+ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then for c~ r SH,v(X) and y E yS, I 
have 
SH,v,(f)(cO(y ) = ~ 
c~(x) 
zEX H 
](x)=y 
If g : Y --+ X is a morphism of G-sets, then for a E SH,v(X) and y E yH, I 
have 
= 
Finally if a C A(X) and f E SHy(Y), then a • f is the morphism from 
[(X • y)H] = IX u • yH] to V defined by 
(a x f)(x,y)= (A*(m~)(a)| l).f(y) 
where mr is the morphism of G-sets from G/H to X defined by m~(uH) = ux. 
Proof: I will first prove the isomorphism 
&,v(x) 
Horn(IX'l, 
~ 
and the other formulae will follow. 
m 
11.4.1 
The isomorphism SHy(X) ~ Hom([XH],v)~ ~(H) 
First I observe that X H identifies with the set of morphisms of G-sets from G/H 
to X, by the map sending z to m~. Let a | v be an element of LG/H,v(X). Then 
a 6 A(X • (G/H)). If x 6 X H, then m• C A((G/H) • X), and I can consider the 
-o 
( 
) 
product m r x a, which is an element of A (G/H) 2 
Its image rr(m* ox a) is then in

the map

Proposition 11.3.1 shows that this is also 
7r(rn*~ ox a).v =

But 1 can view a as an element of AG/H(X), and then

[A*(iH,.,H)A*(m~ x Id)(a) | n] .v ....

. . . .  
neNG(H) 
Now let g~,~ be the linear map from IX H] to V defined by 
ux uH (a) | l .v E V 
TrN~ ~(H)(g.,.)(z) = 
Then 
This can also be written as 
or

TrNla(H)(g~,.)(x) =-

ne~Va(H) 
whence finally 
TrNl C(H)(ga,.)(x) = 
~ 
A* (ux unH) (a)| 
.v 
This formula proves that A~,v = Tr~C(H)(ga,v), hence that A~,. is a morphism of 
JVa(H)-modules from [X H] to V, which factors by a projective module. I obtain that 
way a morphism 
~: A(x • (G/H)) |

Indeed, for x E X H

The morphism ~ is then a morphism from LG/H,v(X) to Hom([XH], v)N1 G(H), which 
passes down to the quotient SH,v(X): indeed, if ~ a~ | v~ is an element of Ja/H,v(X), 
then for any ~b E A((G/H) x X), I have 
~(r 
ox ai).vi = ~ 7r(r o x ai).vi = 0 
i 
i 
It follows that for any x E X H 
E 7r(m*z ~ ai).vi = 0 
i 
so that ~i ~a,,~, = 0. Thus I have a morphism, that I still denote by ~, from SHy(X) 
to Hom([XH], V)~ c(H). 
Conversely, let f E Hom([XH], V)~ a(u), expressed as 
f = TrNIG(H)(g) 
(11.1) 
where g E Hom([XH], V). If x E X H, then m~,. E A(X • (G/H)), and I set 
#(f) = ~ 
m~,. | g(x) E SHy(X) 
(11.2) 
x6X n 
Then #(f) does not depend on the choice of the element g in (11.1): this is equivalent 
to say that if TrNa(H)(g) = 0, then the expression (11.2) is zero. In SH,v(X), this 
means that for any r E A((G/H) • X), I have 
(r ox ,,,~..).g(x) = 0

Let g be any element of Homn([XH], V). Then

11.5 
The simple Green functors 
The previous results give a new proof of a theorem of Th6venaz (see[13]) on simple 
Green functors. The notion of simple Green functor relies on the notion of functorial 
ideal, that Th~venaz defines as follows (see [13] 1.8): a functorial ideal I of the Green 
functor A for the group G is a sub-Mackey functor such that for any subgroup H, the 
module I(H) is moreover a two-sided ideal of A(H). It is equivalent to say that the 
Green functor structure of A passes down to the quotient A/I. 
Translating this definition in terms of the product x, I see that for any G-sets X 
and Y, I must have 
I(X) • A(Y) C_ I(X x Y) 
a(x) • I(Y) g I(X • Y) 
Conversely, if I is a sub-Mackey functor of A such that this condition holds for any 
X and Y, then the product • of A passes down to the quotient A/I. 
In other words, a functorial ideal is nothing but an A-submodule-A of A. Thus a 
Green functor A is a simple Green functor if and only if A is simple as an A-module-A. 
But the A-modules-A are also the A@A~ 
Thus if A is a simple Green 
functor, then there exists a subgroup H of G and an AQA~ 
| JVa(H)-module V 
such that 
~,A~A ~ 
A "~ ~H,V 

292 
CHAPTER 11. THE SIMPLE MODULES 
as AQA~ 
(the exponent A(~A ~ recalls that the simple module SHy is a 
simple module for this Green functor). Then H is the unique minimal subgroup of A 
up to conjugation, and V = A(H) = ~.(H) is a simple A~A~ 
| Na(H)-module. 
Now 
(A~A~ g ~ AH~(A~ H ~ AH~)(AH) ~ 
This follows from lemma 10.8.5, since moreover for U = H\G as a .Nc(H)-set-G, I 
have U/G =., and so 
(Res~va(H)b) H = s 
= bu/G = b 
This isomorphism is now clearly an isomorphism of Green functors, and it follows 
from evaluation at H the isomorphism of algebras 
A@A~ 
~_ A(H) | A(H) ~ = A(H) | A(H) ~ 
Now say that A(H) is a simple A(H) | A(H) ~ | JVa(H)-module, is equivalent to say 
that d(Y) is a _Na(H)-algebra, o1" an algebra with an action of -Na(g), having no 
proper two-sided ideal invariant by Na(H). Moreover, if A is non-zero, then A(*) # 0. 
As 
SH@g4~ 
~ Hom({.l, v)N1 o(H) 
I see that Tr~(H)(A(H)) has to be non-zero. As it is a two-sided invariant ideal of 
% 
/ 
A(H), I must then have 
A(H) : 
which proves that A(H) is moreover a projective/Va(H)-algebra. 
Conversely, if B is a Nc(H)-algebra, then I have a Green functor FPB, such that 
for any subgroup K of NG(H), the ring FPB(H) is equal to B H, the restrictions 
being inclusions, and the transfers being relative traces. In those conditions, for any 
/Va(H)-set Z, I have FPB(Z) ~-- Hom~(H)([Z ], B). 
If B is a projective _NG(H)-algebra, having no proper two-sided invariant ideal, 
then let 
G 
NG(H) 
A = IndNG(H)InfK%(H)FPB 
Then for any G-set X, I have 
A(X) = Hom~G(HI([X"], B) 
and as B is projective, it is also 
A(X) = Hom([XH], B)~ c(H) 
In those conditions, the group H is a minimal subgroup for A, and A(H) = A(H) = B 
is a simple A(H) | A(H) ~ | Na(H)-module, so that 
A ~- S A~gA~ 
H,B 
as A-modules-A. Thus A is a simple Green functor. 
So I must find, for a group K, which are the algebras B with a K-action which 
are projective and have no proper two-sided invariant ideal. Let ] be any maximal 

11.5. THE SIMPLE GREEN FUNCTORS 
293 
(proper) two-sided ideal of B as an algebra.. Such an ideal exists by Zorn's lemma. 
Let L be the stabilizer of [ in K. Then for any k 5 K, the image k(I) of I by k is 
also a maximal two sided ideal of B. In particular 
f-) k(tl = 0 
kEK 
since it is a two-sided invariant ideal. Let P be a subset of K of maximal cardinality 
such that 
J = (~ k(i) # o 
kEP 
Then P :~ K, and there exists ko C K - P. Replacing P by kolP, I can suppose 
k0 = 1 ~ P, and then 
INJ =O 
Moreover, the maximality of I implies I + J =/3, thus 
B=I| 
Then J identifies with B/I, which is a simple B-module-B. Thus J is a minimal 
two-sided ideal of B. Then JI is contained in J V/I = 0. So I is contained in the 
right annihilator of J, which is a two-sided ideal. As J # 0, the annihilator of J is 
equal to I. 
On the other hand the sum 
keKIL 
is a non-zero two-sided invariant ideal of B, so it is equal to B. As J.k(J) is contained 
in g A k(J), which is a sub-two-sided ideal of J, I have J.k(g) = 0 if k ~ L. Thus if 
(jk)keK/n is a family of elements of J such that 
Z 
k(jk) = 0 
kEK/L 
then for any kl 6 K, I have 
o = kl(J) E 
k, ( E 
=  1(J.5 1) 
keK/L 
\keK/L 
] 
Then Jkl is in the annihilator of J, hence in I, hence in I C~ J. Thus Jkl = 0, and 
B = 
(9 k(J) 
keK/L 
In particular, the unit of B decomposes as 
IB : 
E 
ek 
ke1,/L 
for some ek E k(J). If kl E K/L, I have 
keh'lL 

294 
CHAPTER 11. THE SIMPLE MOD ULES 
and unicity of the decomposition implies ek = k(el). Moreover 
el ~--- el Z 
k(el) z e~ 
kEK/L 
and for any b E B, I have 
elb = elb 
el= 
Y~ 
kl EK 
kEK/L 
klk6L 
E 
k(Cl): 
Z 
elbk(el)=elbel 
kEK/L 
kEK/L 
because elbk(el) G J.k(J) = 0 if k ~ L. 
The same argument shows then that 
be1 = etbel, so that el is central in B. Then J = elB is a simple algebra with an 
action of L, and B is isomorphic to the induced K-algebra 
B _~ Ind2J = RK | 
J 
with product defined by 
(k|174 
0 if k-lk'~L 
k @ j.(k-lk')(j ') otherwise 
Now say that B is projective means that there exists elements jk, for k E K/L, such 
that 
/ 
\ 
kl ( ~ 
k(jk)) =1t3= ~_, k(el) 
kl EK 
\kEK/L 
/ 
kEK/L 
The product by el gives 
~l]C(Jk) z 
E 
l(jk): Zrf ( E 
jk) 
kEh'/L 
\keK/L I 
IEL 
It follows that J is projective as L-algebra. Conversely, if 
el = TrL(j) = ~ l(j) 
IEL 
then 
T@'(j) = TrI~-TrL(j) = Tr~L'(el) = 1B 
and B is projective. 
Similarly, if J is a simple algebra on which L acts, then IndLKJ is a K-algebra 
without proper two-sided invariant ideals: if U is such an ideal, and if el is the unit 
of J, then V is the direct sum of k(el)V, for k E h'/L, and k(el)U is isomorphic to 
elU, which is a two-sided ideal of J. If elU = 0, then U = 0, and if elU = J, then 
U=B. 
Thus the algebra B is isomorphic to Ind,J, where L is a subgroup of K, and J 
is a simple algebra with an action of L, the algebra J being moreover projective as 
L-Mgebra. 
Finally, I observe that the group L and the L-algebra J are entirely determined if 
B is known as K-algebra: indeed, if/1 is a maximal two-sided ideal of B, then k(el)I1 

11.6. SIMPLE FUNCTORS AND ENDOMORPHISMS 
295 
is isomorphic to elk-l(/1), which is a two-sided ideal of J, hence equal to zero or J, 
and 
I,= 
@ 
k(el)J 
kEK/L 
k(e~ )11 r 
As I1 is maximal, there exists a unique ko C K/L such that 
h = 
@ 
k( 
l)J 
keK/L-{ko} 
The maximal two-sided ideals of B are then conjugate by K. The group L is the 
stabilizer of a maximal two-sided ideal of B, and the algebra J is the unique simple 
quotient of B: the couple (L, J) is then unique up to conjugation by K. 
Going back to the case of a simple Green functor A, and observing that induction 
and inflation of algebras commute with the functor FP_, it follows that there exists 
a subgroup M of Na(H), containing H (such that M/H is the above group n), and 
a simple algebra S (equal to J) on which M/H acts projectively, such that 
a 
M 
p 
A ~- IndMInfM/HF S 
So the previous discussion gives a new proof, under slightly weaker hypothesis, of the 
following theorem: 
Proposition 11.5.1: 'Th6venaz [13] Theorem 12.11) 
1. Let A be a simple Green functor for G. Then there exists a subgroup 
M of G, a normal subgroup H of M, and a simple algebra S on which 
M/H acts projectively, such that 
A 
G 
M 
~_ IndMInfM/HFPs 
The triple (M,H,S) is unique up to conjugation by G (and up to 
isomorphism of M/H-algebras for S). 
2. Conversely, if H_~ M are subgroups of G, if S is a simple algebra on 
which M/H acts projectively, then IndaMInfM/HFPs is a simple Green 
functor. 
11.6 
Simple functors and endomorphisms 
Let G be a group and A be a Green functor for G. In this section I will study the 
G 
relations between the simple A-modules SH, v and the functors -8- 
and 7-/(-,-). 
First I observe that proposition 11.4.1 gives a definition of S c 
for any J.(H) | 
H,V 
Na(H)-module V (non-necessarily simple). Moreover, the structure of Mackey functor 
G 
of SH, y depends only on the restriction of V to NG(H) ~- b(H) | Na(H): in other 
words 
aesbS ,v 
a 
= SH,Res~rO(H)V 
Similarly, I can define: 

296 
CHAPTER 11. THE SIMPLE MODULES 
Definition: Let H be a subgroup of G, and V be an A(H)| 
[denote 
by FP~, V = FPH,v the A-module defined like SHy, but with any homomorphisms, 
and not only those which factor through a projective module: if X is a G-set, then 
FPg, v(X ) = HomK~G(H)([xH], V) 
ff f : X ~ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then for a 6 FPI~,v(X) and y 6 yH, [have 
FP~,v.(f)(cO(y ) = 
~ 
a(x) 
x6X H 
f(~)=y 
If g : Y ~ X is a morphism of G-sets, then for c~ E FpGH,v(X) and y E yH, I have 
FP~,~*(g)(9)(y) = ~g(y) 
Finally, ira E A(X) and f E FP~,v(Y ), then a x f is the morphism from [(X • y)H] = 
[X H x yH] to V defined by 
(a x m)(x, y) = (A*(m~)(a) | 1).f(y) 
where mx is the morphism of G-sets from G/H to X defined by m~(uH) = ux. 
I define duMly FQaH,V for a G-set X by 
F a 
QH,v(X) = [x'] | 
v 
If f : X ---+ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then 
FQ~,v.(f)(x | v) = f(x) | v 
If g : Y --+ X is a morphism of G-sets, then 
G 
* 
FQ~,v (f)(x | vl = 
E 
Y | v 
y6Y H 
g(y)=x 
Finally, ira E A(X), and y | v C FQ~,v(Y ), then 
a x (y| 
= ~ 
(x,y)| 
xEX H 
It is easy to see that these definitions turn FPI~,V and FQ~,v into A-modules. The 
notation comes from the fact that if A is the Burnside functor, then FP~,v and FQH, 
VG 
identify respectively with the functors denoted by 
Ind~%(H)InfN:((HH))F Pv 
IndGxc(H)Inf~7:((SH))FQv 
by Th6venaz and Webb. The following lemma is a way to recover this isomorphism: 
Lemma 11.6.1: Let M be an A-module. Then, for any subgroup H of G, 
the modules _~r(H) and M__(H) are A(H) | 
Moreover 
HomA(FQGH,v, M) = Hom~(H)| 
) (V, M(H)) 
HomA(M, FPg, v) = Hom~(H)| 
) (M(H), V) 

11.6. SIMPLE FUNCTORS AND ENDOMORPHISMS 
297 
Proof: It is clear that the action of A(H) | Nc(H) on M(H) induces an action of 
A(H) | No(H) on M(H), since 
H 
H 
(tH(a) | n).m = tH(a).n.rn = th-(a.rK(n.m)) 
Similarly, if m E M(H), and if K C H, then 
H 
/-/ 
| 
= tK (a 
= 0 
because 
= n. /,.~(m) : O. So M(H) is also an J,(H) | .Nc(H)-module. 
Moreover if r is a morphism from 
a 
FQH,V to M, then r 
is a morphism of 
A(H) | Nc(H)-modules from FQ~,v(H ) to M(H). But it is clear that FQH,v(H) 
is isomorphic to V, and that FQ~,v(K ) = 0 if K is a proper subgroup of H. Then 
the image of r 
is contained in M(H), and r 
is a morphism of A(H) | Na(H)- 
modules from V to M_M_(H). 
Conversely, if ~b is a morphism of A(H) | NG(H)-modules from V to M(H), and 
if X is a a-set, I define a morphism ~bx from FQ~,v(X ) to M(X) by setting 
Cx(x o 
= 
It is easy to see that this defines a morphism of A-modules from 
a 
FQH,v to M. The 
first adjunction of the lemma follows. 
The second one follows from a dual proof.

Lemma 11.6.2: Let H be a subgroup of G, and V be a ATc(H)-module. If 
K is a subgroup of G, then

S~4,v(G/H) = Hom([(G/H)"], V)~ a(H) = Horn(R-No(H), V)i ~G(H) -~ V 
Then v E V is associated to the morphism 
from RNc(H) to V. Moreover, if X is a G-set, if x0 E X, and if 5~0,v is the morphism

If one of the modules ~r(H) or iV(H) is zero for any H, then M@N(H) = 0 for any 
H. If M@N # 0, there is a minimal subgroup H for MQN. Then 
0 # (M~N)(H) ~- (M~N)(H) = 0 
This contradiction proves the first assertion of the proposition. The second one follows 
similarly from the equality 
nun(M, N) = n(s 
~u(N)) 
for U = H\G, viewed as a IVa(H)-set-G (see proposition 10.1.2), which proves that 
7{(i, N)(H) =Hom. (_~(H), N(H)) 
Then if 7{(M, N) ~ 0, for any minimal subgroup H of 7-/(M, N), I have 
0 r 7{(i, N)(H) = 7t(M, N)(H) = Hom.(-~r(H), N__(H)) 
so the two modules M(H) and _N(H) are non-zero.

moreover the module S~,v(K ) is zero for any proper subgroup of H, it is clear that 
the same is true for

It is clear indeed that if ~ factors through a projective module, so does bb~.

I will say then that S~, v is endosimple. The number of endosimple modules is related 
to Alperin's conjecture in the following way: let .4 = b~ be tile in-part of the Burnside

of G, and V is a simple NG(Q) module (hence finite dimensional over k), the bp- 
,G

Alperin's conjecture (in its global form) can be expressed by saying that the number

commutative. 
Definitions: 
If A and B are Green flmctors fox" the group G, then the direct sum

for a G-set X by 
(~ • M)(X) = ~ • M(X)

O-set X by

Then e x A is a sub-Green functor of A (the inclusion being not unitary in general), 
with e = e x CA C (e X A)(.) as unit. Moreover, if M is an A-module, then ( x M is 
a e x A-module 
The module z • M is an A-module, because if X and Y are G-sets, if c~ E A(X)

M ~ fN~(U) • ReSNa(H) M 
and 
L 
are mutual inverse equivalences of categories between B-Mod and C-Mod. 
Proofi If C is an R-additive category, define the category C in the following way: the 
objects of C are the couples (X,i), where X is an object of C, and i ~nd idempotent 
endoinorphism of X in C. A morphism in C fi'om (X,i) to (Y,j) is a morphism f from 
X to Y in C, such that f o i = f = j o f. In other words 
Homd((X, i), (Y,j)) = j o Homc(X, Y) o i 
The composition of morphisms is the composition in C. The category C is obtained 
by "adding direct summands" of objects of C. It is also an /~-additive category (the 
direct sum of (X,i) and (Y,j) is of course (X @ Y,i @j)). 

12.1. THE CENTRE OF A GREEN FUNCTOR 
311 
There is a canonical functor X ~ (X, ldx) from C to C. So if/~ is an additive 
functor from d to R-Mod, it gives by composition an additive functor fi'om C to 
R-Mod. Conversely, if F is an additive functor fi'om C to R-Mod, then F admits a 
unique extension/~ to C, defined by 
i) = F(,)(F(x)) 
This is because if (X, i) is an object of C, then i : X --+ X defines two morphisms in d 
i+: (X,i) ~ (X, Idx) 
i- : (X, Idx) ---, (X,i) 
Moreover i- o i + is equal to i, which is the identity morphism of (X, i) in C. So (X, i) 
is a direct summand of (X, Idx) in C. 
This shows that the categories of representations of C and d are equivalent. Now 
if 9 : C -4/) is a functor between additive categories, it induces a functor ~ : d -~ 75. 
It is clear moreover that if ~ is fully faithfld, then ~5 is fully faithfuh indeed, the 
bijection 
F: Homc(X, Y) --* Horny (F(X), F(Y)) 
restricts to a bijection/" from I-Iornd ((X, i), (IG j)) = j o Home(X, Y)o ito 
,om  
F(Y,j)) : F(j)o Homo(F(X), F(Y)) o 
If moreover any object Y of/9 is a direct summand of an object F(X) in the image 
of F, therl there are morphisms 
~: P(X) ~ Z 
fl: Z ~ F(X) 
such that c~ofl = Idv. 
Ifi is any idempotent in Endv(Y), then /3oioc~ is an 
idempotent endomorphism of F(X). So it is equal to F(7), for a unique 3' E Endc(X). 
This implies that "y is an idempotent. Now the morphisms 
are mutual inverse isomorphisms in D. So /~' is essentially surjective, hence it is an 
equivalence of categories. 
Thus in the situation of the lemma, the functor ~ is an equivalence of categories: 
this implies in particular that 7-4 induces an equivalence of categories between the 
categories of representations of CB and Ct). It remains to check that this equivalence 
is as stated in the corollary, which is clear since if L is a C-module, then for any G-set 
X 
fH c x (Indaa(~jL)(X) = f~' x L(Res~a(H)X ) .... 
.... f~ x fN~(H) • L(ResGva(H)X ) = fNG(H) X L(Res~%(H)X ) = L(Res~va(H)X) 
which proves that f,~ x Ind~G(H)L = IndNc;(H)L. 
9 
Lemma 12.1.5: Let H be a normal subgroup of G. If A is a Green functor 
for G such that f~/ x A = A, then fl c'/h' • A H = AH~ and the correspondence 
X ~ 
X H induces an equivalence of categories from Ca to CAH. 

312 
CHAPTER 12. CENTRES 
Proof: Let Y be a (G/H)-set. Then 
AM(y) = A(In~/,~')/ ~ 
A.(f)(A(Z)) 
(z,:) 
where (Z, f) runs through the G-sets over In~/HY such that Z H = O. Now since f~ 
G 
G 
is the unit of A, and as ResKf ~, = 0 if H Z K, it follows that A(K) = 0 if H ~ K, 
so A(Z) = 0 if Z H = O. Thus AH(y) = A(In~/HY ). 
Let ix denote the injection from In~/H(X H) into X. Then 
AH(x") = A(In~/HX n) 
The unit A(X) --* (In~/HAH)(x) 
= AH(x")is tlae map A'(ix). 
Now as 
X = (In~/HX H) ~l Z 
with Z H = 0, it follows thai, A(Z) = 0, and the map A*(ix) induces an isomorphism 
A(X) ---+ AH(X~). 
Now it is clear that the correspondence 
X H X g 
f C A(YX) ~ A*(iyx)(f) r AH(yHx H) 
is a fully faithful functor from CA to CAH. As any (G/H)-set Y is isomorphic to 
(Inf~a/HY) H, this functor is essentially surjective, hence it is an equivalence of cate- 
gories. Finally, the unit of A H is f~/H because .f~ - In~/Hf]/H is a linear combi- 
nation of G/If, for H ~ K, so it acts by zero on A. 
9 
Corollary 12.1.6: Let H be a normal subgroup of G. If A is a Green functor 
for G such that fH a X A = A, then the functors 
M ~ M H 
and 
L ~ In~/NL 
are mutual inverse equivalences of categories between A-Mod and AH-Mod. 
Proof: This follows from lemma 12.1.5, and from the definition 
(In~/HL)(X) = L(X H) 
So In~/g is an equivalence of categories, and its inverse is the left adjoint functor 
M~M 
H.

{ ,cG~H (G/H 
Proof: Let /7 = K/H be a ~r-perfect subgroup of G/H. If va~s~ "a/</H is non-zero,

Thus L/H is conjugate of ~7 in G/H. Then L is conjugate to L' in G, and then 
O'(L) = H is conjugate in G to O"(L ') = K. Thus H = K, and the lemma follows.9

Finally, corollary 12.1.4, 12.1.6 and 12.1.9 show that if A is a Green functor for G, 
and H is a rr-perfect subgroup of G, then the functor 
G 
NG(H) 
L ~ IndNc(H)Inf~c,(H)L 
is an equivalence of categories from ,fl ~G(H) • (Resg-a(H)A)H-Mod to fH c' x A Mod. 
The inverse equivalence is the adjoint functor 
(Res,%.(H)M)" 
In particular, the unit morphism 
a 
N~(H) 
f~ • A ~ IndNa(H)In~a(H)(f~ 
X (Res~vc(H)A) H) 
is an isomorphism of A-modules. As it is a morphism of Green functors, it is an 
isomorphism of Green functors. 
The following lemma gives a characterization of the Green functors .f~ • A as the 
functors which are projective relative to the set E~(G) of solvable rr-subgroups of G 
(i.e. relative to the set I]H G/H, where H runs through E~(G)): 

314 
CHAPTER 12. CENTRES 
Proposition 12.1.10: Let G be a group, and A be a Green functor for G 
over R. Let Ir the set of prime factors of IGI which are not invertible in R. 
The following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The functor A is projective relative to the set of solvable re-subgroups. 
2. The idempotent fl a acts as the identity on A, i.e. A = ,f~ x A. 
Proofi It is clear that 2) implies 1), because if A = fa • A, then <4 is the image in 
A(.) of fla. This element is a sum of el, for L E E,(G), hence a linear combination 
of G/K, for K C_ L, thus t( E E~(G). Then the identity map of A(.) = A(G) is a 
a 
E.(G) 
Thus A is projective relative to the set 
linear combination of tic-rio for K E 
of solvable rr-subgroups. 
Conversely, if A is projective relative to the set of solvable ~r-suhgroups of G, then 
eA can be written as 
~A

Then

G a=f[

and that f#" = K/K if I( is re-solvable. Thus .f~ = r 
and 2) holds.

Finally, I have proved the following proposition: 
Proposition 12.1.11: Let G be a group, and A be a Green functor for G 
over R. Let rr the set of prime factors of I01 which are not invertible in /2. 
Then there is an isomorphism of Green functors

Remarks: 1) In the case of Mackey functors (i.e. the case A = b), this is essentially 
theorem 10.1 of Th4venaz and Webb ([15]). 
2) In the case 7r = 0, i.e. when the order of G is invertible in R, the solvable ~r- 
subgroups are trivial. In those conditions, I have fa c = ~a[G/1. Thus if f~ • A -- A, 
then the maps 
a 6 A(H) ~ rlHa 6 A(1) H

The functors (A 
12.2.1 
Another analogue of the centre 
The definition of the centre of a Green functor given in the previous section is certainly 
natural, and mimics the definition of the centre of a ring. However, one can also define 
the centre of a ring from its category of modules, as the endomorphism ring of the 
identity functor ([1] prop. 2.2.7). 
If A is a Green functor for the group G, then the endomorphisms ring of the 
identity functor of A-Mod is just a ring, isomorphic to the centre of A(ft2). I would 
like to have a similar construction, using the category A-Mod, and producing a 
Green functor (A- The idea is then to mimic the construction of the Green functors 
7-/(M, M), setting for a subgroup H of G 
CA(H) = Endf~nct(Res~) 
where EndFu~,(Res~) denotes the endomorphisms of the restriction functor from 
A-Mod to Res~A-Mod: such an endomorphism is determined by giving, for any 
A-module M, a morphism OM of Res~A-modules from Res~M to itself, such that if 
~b : M --+ N is a morphism of A-modules, the square 
OM 
Resr~M 
, Res~M 
t

, 
Res/~N

is commutative. With this definition, it is clear that if A is a Green functor on R, 
then (A(H) has a natural R-algebra structure. It is natural to try to turn (A into a 
Green functor. 
First I observe that if 2- denotes the identity functor of A-Mod, and 2-G/H the 
functor M H MO/H from A-Mod to A-Mod, then 
~A(H) ~-- Homf~n~t(Z, Za/H) 

316 
CHAPTER 12. CENTRES 
Indeed, I know that 2-a/H(M) ~- Ind~Res~M, flmctorially in M, and that Ind/~ is 
right adjoint to Rest. The above isomorphism follows then from the next lemma: 
Lemma 12.2.1: Let C and D be categories, and F be a functor from C to 7) 
having a right adjoint F'. Then if g is a category, if A is a functor from $ 
to C, and B is a functor from g to 19, I have 
HomF~n~t(F o A, B) _~ HomElier(A, F'o B) 
Proofi Indeed, a morphism of functors from F o A to B is determined by giving, 
for any object X of g, a morphism Ox from F o A(X) to B(X), such that if q~ is a 
morphism in 5" from X to Y, the square 
OX

Hom•(F(Z),T) 
~ Homc(Z,F'(T)) 
deduced of the adjunction, I obtain for any X a morphism 0) from A(X) to FoB(X). 
Moreover the square

Ox) ~ and to (0y o(Fo A)(f)) ~ 
Thus the maps 0~c define a morphism of functors from A to F' o B. There is an 
obvious inverse construction, which gives the isomorphism of the lemma. 
9 
Now for any G-set X, I can define the endofunctor Zx of A-Mod by Ix(M) = Mx. 
Then, for any G-set X, I define 
(A(x) : Hom~.~,(Z, Zx) 
If f : X ~ Y is a morphism of G-sets, then f determines a natural transformation 
from Ix to 2-z: if M is an A-module, and Z is a G-set, then the maps 
M,(Idz • 
Mx(Z) --~ My(Z) 
define a natural transformation from Mx to Mz, which is itself natural in M. 
Similarly, the maps 
M*(Idz x f) : My(Z) --+ Mx(Z)

Finally, if c~ r CA(X) and /9 r r

(o, x ,3)M = <,,,1 x aM

Lemma 12.2.2: The above definitions turn CA into a Green functor, such 
that 
(A(*) = EndF,~,~o~(Z) ~- Z(A(fl2)) 
Proof: The verifications to make are not difficult, and similar to those made for the 
functors "H(M,M). The equality CA(e) ~-- Z(A(fi2)) foIlows from the fact that the 
category A-Mod is equivalent to A(fF)-Mod. Thus r 
identifies to the endomor- 
phisms of the identity functor in this category, hence to the centre of the algebra 
A(W). 
Let X be a G-set, and ~ E r 
Then for any A-module A'/, I have a morphism

In particular, if Y is a G-set, I can take M = Ay. Then HomA(A},-, M) ~_ M(Y)

Conversely, if this equality is used to define any for any N and any Y, then the

In particular, if M = Az and Z = Y, the image of 1A(Z2) in Ar(YX') = A(YX'Y) is

In other words, if s is the sequence (ar), | have

It is clear similarly that if s' = (@) is a sequence defining an element of (A(X'), then

If s = (ar) defines the element a C (A (X), and t = (br) defines the element/3 E G(Y),

Let X and Y be G-sets, such that X divides a multiple of Y in CA. This is equivalent

that

CHAPTER 12. CENTRES 
Lemma 12.2.5: Let H be a subgroup of G. Then the inclusion i from Ind~fY 2 
into f~2 induces an injective morphism of algebras 
A,(i) = 
(Res~)(A)(fY 2) ~-~ A(f~ ~) 
Remark: This is the only point on which I disagree with Th6venaz and Webb (see 
[15] 5.3 to 5.4): this lemma shows in particular that the morphism b.(i) from the 
Mackey algebra, of H to the Mackey algebra of G is injective. 
If M is an A-module, then

In other words, the restriction functor can be translated in terms of the algebras 
B = A(Q 2) and C = (Res~A)(fY 23 as 
(Res~M)(W) = A,(i)(lc) oa M(f~) 
Let e be the idempotent A.(i)(1c) of B. Then e oa B is a C-module-B, and 
aes~M(a') ~_ (~ o~ B) O~ M(n) 
The restriction functor is then given by tensoring with a bimodule, and then I can 
apply the following lemma: 
Lemma 12.2.6: Let A and B be R-algebras, and M be an A-module-B. Then 
EndF~t(M @B -) ~-- EndA| 
In particular, if f : A --~ B is a morphism of algebras, if e = .f(1A), and

of M. Moreover HomB(B, L) _~ L for any L, the element/E L defining the morphism 
#l : b ~-+ bl from B to L. The commutativity of the square

forces then 
eL(re| 
= (M|174 
(M| 
(M@pz)((I)(m)@l)= O(m)| 
Thus ~ determines r Moreover, if a E A and b E B, I mnst have 
The case L = B now implies that ~ is an endomorphism of M as A-module-B. 
Conversely, being given r 
I can define (I)L by qSc(rn| 
= (I)(m)| 
This definition 
makes sense, because for b C B 
Cc(,~b | l) = ~(mb) | Z = ~(m)b O l = ~(m) O bl = CL(-~ | bl) 
If moreover 9 is a morphism of A-modules, then for any a E A, I have 
CL(a,~ | l) = ~(am) | 1 = a~(n~) | l = aCL(,~ | l) 
Thus qSc is a morphism of A-modules from M to Mx. With this definition of eL, it 
is clear that all squares (C) are commutative. This proves the first assertion of the 
]emma. 
For the second assertion, I must find the endomorphisms of eB as an A-module-B. 
Such an endomorphism r is entirely determined by the image of e E eB, since 
r 
= r 
Then I must have r 
~) = ~5(e) = r 
and also 
So r 
E eBe. Moreover, if a C A, then 
f(a)e = f(a)f(1A) = f(a) = f(1A)f(a) = ef(a) 
Conversely, if p E | 
commutes with any element in the image of f, then setting 
r 
= pb 
I obtain an endomorphism of eB as A-module-B, since 
r 
= f3(f(a)ebb') = r 
= pf(a)bb' = f(a)pbb' = a.(pb).b' 
This proves the lemma. 
" 
This lemma applies to the morphism A.(i) from (tles~/A)(ft a) to A(f~2), and this 
gives the 
Proposition 12.2.7: Let A be a Green functor for G, and H be a subgroup 
of G. Then s

Let G and H be groups, and U be a G-set-H. If A is a Green functor for G, and X is

such that ay E A(Y • (U OH X) • Y). Then if T is an H-set, I set

Lemma 12.2.9: If U/H = i, the above construction is a unitary morphism

Proof: First, if U/H = o, and if X and Y are G-sets, then 
U o. (X • Y) ~_ (u o. x)(u o. Y) = (U o. x) • (U oH Y)

In some cases, the morphism from (A o U to (Aog is an isomorphism:

With the notations of lemma 12.2.9, if br = 0 for any T, then ay = 0 for any Y: the 
hypothesis implies indeed that ay = 0 if Y is of the form U ou T, since A.(SU, x,T) is 
an isomorphism. But if Y is a G-set, I have the morphism 
uy : Y --* g oH (G\U.Y) 
defined in this case by 
.y(y) = 
for an arbitrary element u C U (indeed U.Y = U x Y if U/H = .). If moreover G 
acts freely on U, then vy is injective: indeed, if

then there exists h E H and g ff G such that 
Whence gy = y' and gu = uh = u. Then g = 1 and y~ = y. 
Thus any G-set is a subset of a set of the form U OH T. Then in CA, any object 
divides an object of this type. But I know that if Y divides Y' in CA, and if a E (A(X), 
then ay, determines ay. In those conditions, I have then ag = 0 for any Y, and the 
morphism from (A o U to (AoU is injective. 
It is also surjective: if b C (Aou(X), and if T is an H-set, I have an element 
br E ( A o U)(TXT) 
I have thus an element 
b~ : A.(~T,X,T)(bT) r A((U OH T) • (U oH X) • (U oH T)) 
and it is easy to see by proposition 8.4.1 that if a E A((U OH T) x (U OH T')), then

12.3 
Examples 
Let A be a Green functor for G. If M is an A module, if Y is a G-set, and if z C CA(Y), 
then z induces by definition a morphism zM of A-modules from M to My. It is clear 
that I obtain that way a morphism of Mackey functors from (A to ~(M, My). The 
construction of the product on (A, by the formulae 
(~ • 
= o:M • Z. 
where the product of the right hand side is the product of 7~(M, M), shows that this 
morphism is compatible with the product. It is moreover clearly unitary. Thus M is 
a (A-module, and the image of ~A in 7-{(M, M) is contained in 7~A(M , M) (since z M 
is a morphism of A-modules). Thus M is an A(~(a-module. 
Proposition 12.3.1: Let A be a Green functor for the group G. If M is an 
A-module, and if X, Y and Z are G-sets, then the product 
aEA(X), b~(A(Y)'rnEM(Z)Haxbxm=axM*(zY) (bz~ 
turns M into an A~(A-module. 
In particular, the primitive idempotents of CA (') = Z (A(gt 2)) lead to a decomposition 
of A-modules in blocks: the block j is formed of the A-modules M such that j x M = 
M. 
12.3.1 
The 
functors 
FPB 
Let B be a G-algebra, and A = FPB be the fixed points functor on B, defined for a 
G-set X by 
FP~(X) = nom~([X], B) 
Then if X and Y are G-sets, the module FPB(XY) identifies with the set of matrices 
re(x, y) indexed by X x Y, with coefficients in B, which are invariant by G, i.e. such 
that for any g C G 
A similar computation as in proposition 4.5.2 shows that if Z is a G-set, if" p(y,z) is 
a matrix in FPB(YZ), then the product m oy p is obtained as a product of matrices, 
i.e. 
(.~ oy p)(~, ~) : X~ "~(~, y)p(y, ~) 
yEY 
where the expression in the right hand side is computed in the algebra B. 
Let X be a G-set, and rn E (A(X). Then for any G-set Y, I have an element 
my C A(YXY), that is a "matrix" my(y,x, y') indexed by YXY, and invariant by 
G, i.e. such that for any g E G, I have 
-~y(gy, g~, gy') = g.~y (y,., y') 

12.3. EXAMPLES 
333 
Say that rn E ~A(X) iS equivalent to say that for any G-sets Y and Z, for any 
a E A(YZ), and for any (a:,y,z) E XYZ, I have 
y'ffY 
#EZ 
First I will t~ke Z = G/1. I set 
m(:r,z) = ma/l(1,x,z) 
tor 
x E X, z E G = (;/1 
so that mo/l(z', x, z) = ~'rn(zt-lx, z'-lz). Similarly, if & is a map from Y to B, and if 
I set 
I obtain an element of A(Y • (G/l)), and any element of A(Y • (G/l))is 
of this 
form. 
In particular, if r 
= 1 for y = y0 and r 
= 0 otherwise, equality (12.2) 
becomes 
?Tty(Y'X'ZyO) = 
E 
zt'TL(zI-lx'~ZI-Iz) 
z'EG 
z t-1Y=YO 
or for y' = zyo

E 
z'~lYt(zt--lx;zt--lz) 
(12.3) 
z'E(; 
zt--1 ~I=Z-- I 9 t 
Then taking Y = G/1, this equality forces 
,~G/, (> ,~, v') = ~-~(v -1., y-l,/) = y~,-, ~.~(z-lv,v-lx, z-,v,y-lz) 
which can also be written as 
m(y -1 x, y-iv,) = ~'-' =.m(z-~v,y-lz, z-~y,y-lz) 
This relation must hold for any x C X, and any y, S, z and z' in G. Changing x to 
yx and z to y'z, this gives 
g,z( x, y- ly,) = z?,,.(z-lx, z- l y- , ytz ) 
or changing furthermore y' to yy' 
.~.(.~, ~') = -'re(z-l., ~-lv'~ ) 
which gives finally, changing z to z -1 and y' to y 
In those conditions, equation (12.3) becomes 
zJEG

Let again Y = Z = G/1. Let b E /3, and r be the function from Y to /~' which is 
equal to b in Y0 and to 0 elsewhere. If a(y, z) = ~r 
equation (12.4) gives 
TYt(X, zyoy-1).Zb = gy~ b.fft(x, zy0y -1 ) 
This equation gives for Y = Yo = 1 
Conversely, it is clear that this relation implies equation (12.4). Thus CA(X) is iso- 
morphic to the set of matrices re(z, z), indexed by X x G, and satisfying the following 
conditions 
Zm(x, y) = ~(~z, ~y) V:~ ~ X, W, y ~ G 
Then let r'n(z) = ~ea re(z, z) | z 9 B | G. The second condition is equivalent to 
the fact that r'n(x) commutes with all the elements of B, I have then a map 
7~ : X ---, CBoc(B) 
The first condition shows that for z E G

In other words, if C = CB| 
with its natural structure of G-Mgebra (induced

RG-modules from IX] to C.

Then (A(X) ~-- Hom~([X], C), and it is clear that this isomorphism induces an iso- 
morphism of Green functors from (a to FIX:. 
Now let b C Z(B)(X). Then b is a morphism of RG-modnles from IX] to B, such 
that for any Y, and any morphism c of RG-modules from Y to B 
The case Y = G/1 shows then that b(x) E Z(B), and it follows an isomorphism of 
Green functors Z(FPB) ~-- FPz(B). Finally, I have the following proposition: 
Proposition 12.3.2: Let B be a G-algebra, and C = CB| 
Then 
Z(FPs) ~- FPz(B) 
@e. ~-- FPc 
as Green functors. In particular @p.(*) ~- Z(B | G) and 
Thus the centre of Yoshida algebra (see proposition 4.5.2) is isomorphic to 
the centre of J~G. 
Remark: If the algebra B is an interior algebra (see [11]), then the algebra C is 
isomorphic to Z(B)G: indeed, if 9 ~ P(g) is a morphism from G to the group of 
invertible elements of/5', and if g acts on B by conjugation by 0(9), then say that 
~g % ~ g is in C is equivalent to say that for any g, the element %p(g) -~ is in Z(B), 
hence that Eg(%p(9)-l)g E Z(B)G. This correspondence is moreover an isomorphism 
of algebras C ~- Z( B)G. 
12.3.2 
The blocks of Mackey algebra 
Let R = k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and A = bp the p-part of the Burnside 
functor, with coefficients in k. Then A(1) ~ k, and (A(1) ~-- kG. On the other hand, 
(A(G) is the centre of the p-part #e(G) of the Mackey algebra (i.e. the piece of the 
Mackey algebra corresponding to the central idempotent fl a, or the subalgebra of the 
Mackey algebra formed of elements ~px'1t rKp~, for any subgroups H and K of G, any

element z of G, and any p-subgroup P of 1t N ~K). The lq(G)-modules are exactly 
the Mackey functors which are pr@ective relative to p-subgroups. 
Then I have the map rl a : Z(#I((-/)) --4 (k.(;) c" = Z~:G. 
It is a morphism of 
algebras, it is unitary, and surjective: indeed, Za'(; is generated as ~'-module by the 
elements of the form 
for x E G. Let for K C_ Ca(x) 
It is easy to see that this defines an eleme,tt of (.a (Cc;(.~')). Moreover 
G G  
- 
,,r 
111 rd>.(~.)( r 
Thus r~ induces a surjection from Z(/ll((")) to Z~'(;. The kernel of this surjection 
is moreover nilpotent, because if e is an idempotent of the kernel, then 7'~;(e') = 0. 
The module e#l(G) is then a projective Mackey functor, which is projective relative 
to p-subgroups, and equal to zero at {1}. Hence it is zero (see [15[ corollary 12.2) and 
It follows that rl a induces a bijection between the blocks of kG and those of #~(G) 
(see [15] Theorem 17.1).
