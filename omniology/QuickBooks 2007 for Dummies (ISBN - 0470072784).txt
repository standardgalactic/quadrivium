About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson, CPA, MBA (finance), MS (taxation), has a simple purpose
in life: He wants to help you (and people like you) manage your business
finances by using computers. Oh, sure, this personal mandate won’t win him
a Nobel Prize or anything, but it’s his own little contribution to the world.
Steve’s experiences mesh nicely with his special purpose. He’s a CPA in
Redmond, Washington. He’s an adjunct professor of taxation (S corporations
and limited liability companies) at Golden Gate University’s graduate tax
school. And, heck, he even used to work as a senior consultant and CPA with
Arthur Andersen & Co. (er, yeah, that Arthur Andersen –– but, hey, it was 20
years ago). Steve, whose books have sold more than 4 million copies in
English and have been translated into 11 other languages, is also the best-
selling author of Quicken 2007 For Dummies (Wiley).
Dedication
To the entrepreneurs and small-business people of the world. You folks
create most of the new jobs.

QuickBooks 2007 For Dummies 

Introduction
R
unning or working in a small business is one of the coolest things a
person can do. Really. I mean it. Sure, sometimes the environment is
dangerous — kind of like the Old West — but it’s also an environment in
which you have the opportunity to make tons of money. And it’s also an envi-
ronment in which you can build a company or a job that fits you. In compari-
son, many brothers and sisters working in big-company corporate America
are furiously trying to fit their round pegs into painfully square holes. Yuck.
You’re wondering, of course, what any of this has to do with this book or with
QuickBooks. Quite a lot, actually. The whole purpose of this book is to make
it easier for you to run or work in a small business by using QuickBooks.
About QuickBooks
Let me start off with a minor but useful point: QuickBooks comes in several
different flavors including QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks
Premier, QuickBooks Premier: Accountants Edition, QuickBooks Enterprise,
and so on.
This book, however, talks about QuickBooks Premier.
Does this mean that I’ve somehow left you adrift if you have one of these
other flavors? No way. I wouldn’t do that to you. QuickBooks Premier is a
superset of QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro, and is identical in areas
to QuickBooks Enterprise, so by describing how you use QuickBooks
Premier, I also tell you how to use the other flavors of QuickBooks.
What’s more, for the readers of this book, there’s no discernible difference
between QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Pro. You aren’t reading this
book to prepare for the CPA exam, right? Right. The extra whistles and bells
that make QuickBooks Premier, well, premier are all things that only accoun-
tants care about: remote access to QuickBooks and your QuickBooks data,
reversing general entries, extra security for general ledger closings, and so
on. So I don’t really talk about those things.

The bottom line? Yes, there are several flavors of QuickBooks, but if you’re
just trying to get started and want to use QuickBooks, this book works for
QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks
Enterprise.
About This Book
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover like some Harry Potter
page-turner. Instead, it’s organized into tiny, no-sweat descriptions of how you
do the things you need to do. If you’re the sort of person who just doesn’t feel
right not reading a book from cover to cover, you can, of course, go ahead and
read this thing from front to back. You can start reading Chapter 1 and continue
all the way to the end (which means through Chapter 21 and the appendixes).
I actually don’t think this from-start-to-finish approach is bad, because I tell
you a bunch of stuff (tips and tricks, for example) along the way. I tried to
write the book in such a way that the experience isn’t as rough as you might
think, and I really do think you get good value from your reading.
But you also can use this book like you would use an encyclopedia. If you
want to know about a subject, you can look it up in the table of contents or
the index; then you can flip to the correct chapter or page and read as much
as you need or enjoy. No muss, no fuss.
I should, however, mention one thing: Accounting software programs require
you to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use them to get
real work done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks yet, I recommend
that you read through the first few chapters of this book to find out what you
need to do first.
Hey. There’s something else I should tell you. I have fiddled a bit with the
Windows display settings. For example, I’ve noodled around with the font set-
tings and most of the colors. The benefit is that the pictures in this book are
easy to read. And that’s good. But the cost of all this is that my pictures look
a little bit different from what you see on your screen. And that’s not good. In
the end, however, what the publisher found is that people are really happier
with increased readability. Anyway, I just thought I should mention this here,
up front, in case you have any questions about it.
Oh, yeah, another thing I did was remove what QuickBooks calls its Open
Window list from the left edge of the QuickBooks program window. I did this to
enlarge the windows that you work with and into which you enter data. (You
turn the Open Window list off and on by choosing View➪Open Window List.)

What You Can Safely Ignore
Sometimes I provide step-by-step descriptions of tasks. I feel very bad about
having to do this. So to make things easier for you, I describe the tasks by
using bold text. That way, you know exactly what you’re supposed to do. I
also provide a more detailed explanation in the text that follows the step. You
can skip the text that accompanies the step-by-step boldface directions if you
already understand the process.
Here’s an example that shows what I mean:
1. Press Enter.
Find the key that’s labeled Enter. Extend your index finger so that it rests
ever so gently on the Enter key. In one sure, fluid motion, press the Enter
key with your index finger. Then remove your finger from the key.
Okay, that example is kind of extreme. I never actually go into that much
detail, but you get the idea. If you know how to press Enter, you can just do
that and not read further. If you need help — maybe with the finger part or
something — just read the nitty-gritty details.
Can you skip anything else? Let me see now. . . . You can skip the Technical
Stuff icons, too. The information next to these icons is really only for those of
you who like that kind of technical stuff.
For that matter, I guess that you can safely ignore the stuff next to the Tip
icons, too — even if the accumulated wisdom, gleaned from long hours slav-
ing over a hot keyboard, can save you much weeping and gnashing of teeth. If
you’re someone who enjoys trying to do something another way, go ahead
and read the tips.
Sometimes, I use made-up examples (along with examples from my own experi-
ence) to help you understand how some topic or area of QuickBooks helps you
and your business, and I mark these examples with the Case Study icon. This is
just my way of continuing the giving. But sure, you can skip these.

Introduction

What You Should Not Ignore (Unless
You’re a Masochist)
Don’t skip the Warning icons. They’re the ones flagged with the picture of the
19th-century bomb. They describe some things that you really shouldn’t do.
Out of respect for you, I’m not going to put stuff like Don’t smoke! next to
these icons. I figure that you’re an adult, and you can make your own lifestyle
decisions. So I reserve the Warning icons for more urgent and immediate 
dangers — things akin to Don’t smoke while you’re filling your car with gasoline.
This icon is a friendly reminder to do something. Not to be too pushy, but it’s
probably not a good idea to ignore these babies.
Three Foolish Assumptions
I make three assumptions about you:
 You have a PC running Microsoft Windows. (I took pictures of the
QuickBooks windows and dialog boxes while using Windows XP, in case
you’re interested.)
 You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
 You have or will buy a copy of QuickBooks, QuickBooks Pro, or
QuickBooks Premier for each computer on which you want to run the
program.
Personally, I use QuickBooks Premier, so this book includes some features
unique to the Premier version of QuickBooks. If you’re trying to decide which
version to buy, I should tell you that QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks
Premier include networking capabilities (which I describe in Appendix C) and
the ability to create estimates (which I describe in Chapter 16). The standard
version of QuickBooks doesn’t include these features.
This book works for QuickBooks 2007, although in a pinch, you can probably
also use it for QuickBooks 2006 or 2008. (I have to say, however, that if you
have QuickBooks 2006, you may instead want to return this book and trade it
in for QuickBooks 2006 For Dummies by yours truly, published by Wiley.)

QuickBooks 2007 For Dummies

By the way, if you haven’t already installed QuickBooks and need help, jump
to Appendix A, which tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy steps.
And if you’re just starting out with Microsoft Windows, peruse Chapter 1 of
the Windows User’s Guide or one of these books on your flavor of Windows:
Windows 2000 Professional For Dummies, Microsoft Windows Me For Dummies,
or Windows XP For Dummies, 2nd Edition, all by Andy Rathbone (and all pub-
lished by Wiley).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six mostly coherent parts.
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks
Part I covers some up-front tasks that you need to take care of before you can
start using QuickBooks. I promise I don’t waste your time here. I just want to
make sure that you get off on the right foot.
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks
The second part of this book explains how you use QuickBooks for your daily
financial record keeping: preparing customer invoices, recording sales, and
paying bills — that kind of stuff.
Just so you know, you’ll be amazed at how much easier QuickBooks will make
your life. QuickBooks is a really cool program.
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Part III talks about the kinds of things that you should do at the end of the
week, the end of the month, or the end of the year. This part explains, for
example, how you print checks, explore QuickBooks online resources, do
payroll, and create a business budget.
While I’m on the subject, I also want to categorically deny that Part III con-
tains any secret messages that you can decipher by reading backward. Yllaer.

Introduction

Part IV: Housekeeping Chores
Part IV talks about some of the maintenance that you need (or someone
needs) to perform to keep your accounting system shipshape: account 
reconciliations, financial report generation, job-costing mechanics, file 
management — and oh, yes, fixed assets accounting.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Gravity isn’t just a good idea; it’s a law.
By tradition, the same is true for this part of a For Dummies book. The Part of
Tens provides a collection of lists: ten things you should do if you own a busi-
ness, ten things to do when you next visit Acapulco — oops, sorry, wrong
book.
Also by tradition, these ten-item lists don’t need to have exactly ten items.
You know the concept of a baker’s dozen, right? You order a dozen dough-
nuts but get 13 for the same price. Well, For Dummies ten-item lists have
roughly ten items. (If the Dummies Man — the bug-eyed, pale-faced guy suffer-
ing from triangle-shape-head syndrome who appears on the cover of this
book and on icons throughout these pages — were running the bakery, a 10-
doughnut order might mean that you get anywhere from 8 to 13 doughnuts.)
Do you believe that I’m an accountant? So exacting that it’s scary.
Part VI: Appendixes
An unwritten rule says that computer books have appendixes, so I include
three. Appendix A tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy steps.
Appendix B explains small business accounting, provides a short biography
of an Italian monk, and explains double-entry bookkeeping. Appendix C
describes how to set up QuickBooks for use by multiple users — and for mul-
tiple users on a network. Yikes!
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the
conventions that I use in this book.
6
QuickBooks 2007 For Dummies

When I want you to type something, such as With a stupid grin, Martin
watched the tall blonde strut into the bar and order grappa, it’s in bold let-
ters. When I want you to type something that’s short and uncomplicated,
such as Jennifer, it still appears in boldface type.
Except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of the stuff
you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type
JENNIFER, or you can follow poet e. e. cummings’ lead and type jennifer.
Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like
Choose Lists➪Items, which simply means to first choose the Lists menu and
then choose Items. The ➪separates one part of the command from the next
part.
You can choose menus and commands and select dialog-box elements with
the mouse. Just click the thing you want to select.
While we’re on the subject of conventions, let me also mention something
about QuickBooks conventions, because it turns out that there’s not really
any good place to point this out. QuickBooks doesn’t use document windows
the same way that other Windows programs do. Instead, it locks the active
window into place and then displays a list of windows in its Navigator pane,
which is like another little window. To move to a listed window, you click it in
the Navigator pane.
You can tell QuickBooks to use windows the way that every other program
does, however, by choosing View➪Multiple Windows. (I did this throughout
the book to make the figures bigger and, therefore, easier for you to read.)
You can even remove the Navigator pane by choosing View➪Open Window
List. (You can also remove the other locked pane, which lists windows and is
called the Shortcuts list, by choosing View➪Shortcut List.)

Part I
Quickly into
QuickBooks

In this part . . .
A
ll accounting programs –– including QuickBooks ––
make you do a bunch of preliminary stuff. Sure, this
is sort of a bummer, but getting depressed about it won’t
make things go any faster. So if you want to quickly get up
and go with QuickBooks, peruse the chapters in this first
part. I promise that I get you through this stuff as quickly
as possible.

Chapter 1
QuickBooks: The Heart of 
Your Business
In This Chapter
 Why you truly need a tool like QuickBooks
 What QuickBooks actually does
 Why QuickBooks is a popular choice
 What you need to do (in general) to get started
 How to succeed in setting up and using QuickBooks
I
want to start our conversation by quickly covering some basic questions
concerning QuickBooks — questions like “Why even use QuickBooks?”,
“Where and how does a guy or gal start?”, and most important, “What should
you not do?”
This little orientation shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Really. And the
orientation should let you understand the really, really big picture concerning
QuickBooks.
Why QuickBooks?
Okay, I know you know that you need an accounting system. Somebody,
maybe your accountant or spouse, has convinced you of this. And you, being
the team player that you are, have just accepted this conventional viewpoint
as the truth.
But just between you and me, why do you really need QuickBooks? And what
does QuickBooks do that you really, truly need done? And heck, just to be
truly cynical, let’s also ask the question “Why QuickBooks?” Why not, for
example, use some other accounting software program?

Why you need an accounting system
Start with the most basic question first: Why do you even need an accounting
system like QuickBooks? It’s a fair question. So let me supply you the two-
part answer.
The first reason is that federal law requires your business to maintain an
accounting system. More specifically, Section 446 (General Rule for Methods
of Accounting) of Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code) of the United States Code
requires that you have the ability to compute taxable income by using some
sort of common-sense accounting system that clearly reflects income.
If you decide just to blow off this requirement — after all, you got into busi-
ness so you could throw off the shackles of bureaucracy — you might get
away with your omission. But if the Internal Revenue Service examines your
return, and you’ve ignored Section 446, the IRS gets to do your accounting
the way it wants. And the IRS way means that you pay more in taxes and that
you also pay taxes earlier than you would have otherwise.
A second reason exists for maintaining an accounting system, too. And here, I
sort of go out on an editorial limb, but I’m going to do it anyway. My strong
belief — backed by a couple of decades of business experience and close-
hand observations of several hundred business clients — is that you can’t
successfully manage your business without a decent accounting system.
Success requires the ability to accurately measure profits or losses and the
ability to reasonably estimate your financial condition.
This second reason makes sense, right? If your friend Kenneth doesn’t know
when he’s making money, which products or services are profitable, and
which customers are worth keeping (and which aren’t), does he really have a
chance?
I don’t think he does.
So to summarize, your business must have a decent accounting system, no
matter how you feel about accounting and even no matter how time-consuming
and expensive such a system is or becomes. The law requires you to have such
an accounting system. And successful business management depends on such
an accounting system.
12
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

What QuickBooks does
Go on to the next question that you and I should discuss: What does
QuickBooks do to help you maintain an accounting system that measures
profits and losses and other stuff like that?
QuickBooks truly makes business accounting easy by providing windows that
you use to record common business transactions. For example, it has a
window (you know, a Windows window that appears on your monitor’s
screen) that looks like a check. To record a check you write, you fill in the
blanks of the window with bits of information like the date, the amount, and
the person or business you’re paying.
QuickBooks also has a handful of other windows that you use in a similar
fashion. For example, QuickBooks supplies an invoice window that looks like
an invoice you might use to bill some customer or client. You fill in the
invoice window’s blanks by recording invoice information such as the name
of the client or customer, the invoice amount, and the date by which you
want to be paid.
And here’s the really neat thing about these check and invoice windows:
When you record business transactions by filling in the blanks shown on-
screen, you collect the information that QuickBooks needs in order to pre-
pare the reports that summarize your profits or losses and your financial
situation.
For example, if you record two invoices (for $10,000 each) to show amounts
that you’ve billed your customers, and then you record three checks (for
$4,000 each) to record your advertising, rent, and supplies expenses,
QuickBooks can (with two or three mouse clicks from you) prepare a report
that shows your profit, as shown in Table 1-1.
Table 1-1
A Profit and Loss Report
Amount
Revenue
$20,000
Advertising
($4,000)
Rent
($4,000)
Supplies
($4,000)
Total Expenses
($12,000)
Profit
$8,000
13
Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business

The parentheses, by the way, indicate negative amounts. That’s an accounting
thing . . . but back to the real point of my little narrative. Your accounting with
QuickBooks can be just as simple as I describe in the preceding paragraphs. In
other words, if you record just a handful of business transactions by using the
right QuickBooks windows, you can begin to prepare reports like the one shown
in Table 1-1. Such reports can be used to calculate profits or (ugh) losses for last
week, last month, or last year. Such reports can also be used to calculate profits
and losses for particular customers and products.
I know I was kind of harsh in the first part of this chapter — bringing up that
stuff about the IRS and business failure — but this accounting stuff is really
neat! (For the record, that’s the only exclamation point I’ll use in this chap-
ter.) Good accounting gives you a way to manage your business for profitabil-
ity. And obviously, all sorts of really good and wonderful things stem from
operating your business profitably: a materially comfortable life for you and
your employees; financial cushioning to get you through the tough patches;
and profits that can be reinvested in your business, in other businesses, and
in community charities.
Let me also mention a couple of other darn handy things that QuickBooks
(and other accounting systems, too) do for you, the overworked business
owner or bookkeeper:
 Forms: QuickBooks produces, or prints, forms such as checks or
invoices by using the information that you enter into those check win-
dows and invoice windows that I mention earlier. So that’s really neat.
And a true timesaver. (See Chapter 4.)
 Electronic banking and billing: QuickBooks transmits and retrieves
some financial transaction information electronically. For example,
QuickBooks can e-mail your invoices to customers and clients. (That can
save you both time and money.) And QuickBooks can share bank
accounting information with most major banks, making it easy to make
payments and transfer funds electronically. (See Chapter 13.)
What Explains QuickBooks’ Popularity?
No question about it — you need a good accounting system if you’re in busi-
ness. But you know what? That fact doesn’t explain why QuickBooks is so
popular or why you should use QuickBooks. (Let’s ignore for one moment
that you’ve probably already purchased QuickBooks.) Therefore, let me sug-
gest to you three reasons why QuickBooks is an excellent choice to use as
the foundation of your accounting system:
14
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

 Ease of use: QuickBooks historically has been the easiest or one of the
easiest accounting software programs to use. Why? The whole “just-
enter-transaction-information-into-windows-that-resemble-forms” thing
(which I talk about earlier) makes the data entry a breeze. Most busi-
nesspeople already know how to fill in the blanks on these forms. That
means that most people — that probably includes you, too — know
almost everything they need to know in order to collect the information
that they need to do their books with QuickBooks. Over time, other soft-
ware programs have tended to become more QuickBooks–like in their
ease of use. The folks at Intuit have really figured out how to make and
keep accounting easy.
I should tell you, because I’m an accountant, that the ease-of-use quality
of QuickBooks is not all good. Part of the reason why QuickBooks is easy
to use is because it doesn’t possess all the built-in internal control mech-
anisms that some more traditional accounting systems have. Those
internal control mechanisms, of course, make your financial data more
secure, but they also make the accounting software more complicated to
use.
 Cheap: QuickBooks, especially compared with the hardcore accounting
packages that accountants love, is pretty darn cheap. Different versions
have different prices, but as a ballpark figure, you can get an excellent
accounting software solution for a few hundred bucks. Not to go all
grandfatherly on you or anything, but when I was a young CPA, the
cheap accounting software packages often cost several thousand dol-
lars. And it was almost easy to spend tens of thousands of dollars.
 Ubiquity: The ubiquity thing relates to the ease of use of QuickBooks
and the cheap price that Intuit charges for QuickBooks. But oddly
enough, the ubiquity of QuickBooks becomes its own benefit, too. For
example, you’ll find it very easy to find a bookkeeper who knows
QuickBooks. And if you can’t, you can hire someone who doesn’t know
QuickBooks and then send them to a QuickBooks class at the local com-
munity college (because that class will be easy to find). You’ll also find it
very easy to find a CPA who knows QuickBooks. Now, you might choose
to use some other, very good piece of accounting software. However,
almost assuredly, what you’ll discover is that it’s tougher to find people
who know the software, tougher to find classes for the software, tougher
to find CPAs who know the software, and even tougher to find books on
the software.
15
Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business

What’s Next, Dude?
At this point, presumably, you know why you need accounting software and
why QuickBooks is probably a really reasonable and maybe even an excellent
choice. In other words, you’ve swallowed my line about QuickBooks hook,
line, and sinker. That decision on your part leaves the question as to what
you should do next. Let me say this: In a nutshell, before you can begin really
working with QuickBooks, you need to do the following:
1. Install the QuickBooks software, as I describe in Appendix A.
2. Run through the EasyStep Interview I describe in Chapter 2.
3. Load the master files, as I describe in Chapter 3.
If you’re thinking, “Whoa, cowboy, that seems like a bit more work than
what’s involved in installing spreadsheet software or a new word processor,”
you’re right. You might as well hear from me the ugly truth about accounting
software: Accounting software — all of it — requires quite a bit of setup work
in order to get things running smoothly. For example, you’ll want to build a
list of expense categories, or accounts, to use for tracking expenses. You’ll
also want to set up a list of the customers that you invoice.
Rest assured, however, that none of the setup work is overly complex; it’s
just time consuming. Also, know from the very start that QuickBooks pro-
vides a tremendous amount of hand-holding in order to help you step
through the setup process. And remember, too, that you have your new
friend — that would be me — to help you whenever the setup process gets a
little gnarly.
How to Succeed with QuickBooks
Before you and I wrap up the little why, what, and how discussion of this
chapter, I ought to provide a handful of ideas about how to make your experi-
ence with QuickBooks a successful one.
Budget wisely, Grasshopper
Here’s my first suggestion: Please plan on spending at least a few hours to get
the QuickBooks software installed, set up, and running. I know you don’t
really want to do that. You have a business to run, a family to take care of, a
dog to walk, and so on.
16
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

But here’s the reality sandwich you probably need to take a big bite of: It’ll
take half an hour just to get the software installed on your computer. (This
installation isn’t complicated, of course. You’ll mostly just sit there, sipping
coffee or whatever.)
But after the QuickBooks software is installed, unfortunately, you still have
the work of running through the EasyStep Interview. Again, this work isn’t dif-
ficult, but it does take time. For example, a very simple service business
probably takes at least an hour. If your business owns inventory, or if you’re a
contractor with some serious job-costing requirements, the process can take
several hours.
Therefore, do yourself a favor: Give yourself adequate time for the job at
hand.
Don’t focus on features
Now let me share another little snidbit about getting going with QuickBooks.
At the point that you’ve installed the QuickBooks software and started the
program, you’re going to be in shock about the number of commands, whis-
tles, bells, and buttons that the QuickBooks window provides. But you know
what? You can’t focus on the QuickBooks features.
Your job is simply to figure out how to record a handful — probably a small
handful — of transactions with QuickBooks. Therefore, what you want to do
is focus on the transactions that need to be recorded in order for you to keep
your books.
For example, say you’re a one-person consulting business. In that case, you
might need to figure out how to record only the following three transactions:
 Invoices
 Payments from customers (because you’ve invoiced them)
 Payments to vendors (because they’ve sent you bills)
So all you need to do is discover how to record invoices (see Chapter 4), how
to record customer payments (see Chapter 5), and how to record checks (see
Chapter 6). You really don’t need to worry about much else except maybe
how to print reports, but that’s easy (see Chapter 15 for the click-by-click).
“Oh, Steve,” you’re saying, “you just intentionally picked an easy business.
I’m a retailer with a much more complicated situation.”
17
Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business

Okay, well, you’re right that I picked an easy business for my first example,
but I stand by the same advice for retailers. If you’re a retailer, you probably
need to figure out how to record only four transactions. Here they are:
 Sales receipts
 Bills from your suppliers
 Payments to your vendors
 Employee payroll checks
In this example, then, all you need to do is find out how to record sales
receipts — probably a separate sales receipt for each bank deposit you make
(see Chapter 5) — how to record bills from vendors, how to record checks to
pay your bills (see Chapter 6), and how to handle employee payroll (see
Chapter 11).
I don’t want to be cranky or careless here, but one really good trick for get-
ting up to speed with QuickBooks is to focus on the transactions that you
need to record. If you identify those transactions and then figure out how to
record them, you’ve done the hard part. Really.
Outsource payroll
Here’s another suggestion for you: Go ahead and outsource your payroll.
That’ll probably cost you between $1,000 and $2,000 a year. I know, that’s
roughly the total cost of four tickets to Hawaii, but outsourcing payroll de-
livers three big benefits, even after considering the stiff price:
 Simplicity: Payroll is one of the most complicated areas in small busi-
ness accounting and in QuickBooks. Accordingly, you will greatly sim-
plify your bookkeeping by moving this headache off your desk and onto
the desk of your accountant (he or she may love doing your payroll) or
onto the desk of the payroll service (you can use a national firm like ADP
or Paychex, or a local firm).
 Penalties: Did I mention that payroll is one of the most complicated
areas in small business accounting and in QuickBooks? I did? Good,
because you really need to know that payroll preparation and accounting
mistakes are easy to make. And payroll mistakes often subject you to
seriously annoying fines and penalties from the Internal Revenue Service
and from state revenue and employment agencies. While I grant you that
paying $1,500 a year for payroll processing seems like it’s way too much
money, you need to save only a couple of painful fines or penalties a year
in order to drastically cut the costs of using an outside payroll service.
18
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

 Mrs. Peabody’s annual raise: One final reason for outsourcing payroll
also exists. Let me explain. You’re not going to want to do payroll your-
self. Really, you’re not. As a result, you’re eventually going to assign the
task to that nice woman who works in your office, Mrs. Peabody. Here’s
what’s going to happen when you do that: Late one afternoon during 
the week following Mrs. Peabody’s first payroll, she’ll ask to meet with 
you — to talk about why Mrs. Raleigh makes $15,000 more a year than she
(Mrs. Peabody) does, and also to ask why she (Mrs. Peabody) makes only
$2 per hour more than Wayne, the idiot who works in the warehouse.
Because you’re a nice person, Mrs. Peabody will leave a few minutes
later with a $1.50-an-hour raise. And at that point, you’ll remember,
vaguely, my earlier caution about the problem of saving maybe $2,000 a
year in payroll service fees but then having to give Mrs. Peabody an
extra $3,000 raise. Ouch.
Get professional help
A quick point: You can probably get a CPA to sit down with you for an hour or
so and show you how to enter a handful of transactions in QuickBooks. In
other words, for a cost that’s probably somewhere between $100 and $200,
you can have somebody hold your hand for the first three invoices you create,
the first two bills you record, the first four checks you write, and so on.
You should try to do this if you can. You’ll save yourself untold hours of
headache by having someone who knows what she or he is doing provide an
itty-bit of personalized training.
Use both the profit and loss statement 
and the balance sheet
And now, my final point: You want to really use your profit and loss statement
(which measures your profits) and your balance sheet (which lists your
assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity) as part of managing your business. In
other words, get used to producing a QuickBooks profit and loss statement
each week or month or whatever. Then use that statement to determine your
profitability. In a similar fashion, regularly produce a balance sheet to check
your cash balances, the amounts customers or clients owe, and so on.
19
Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business

Maybe this seems like obvious advice, but there’s a semihidden reason for
my suggestion. If you or you and the bookkeeper are doing the accounting
right, both the QuickBooks profit and loss statement and the balance sheet
will show numbers that make sense. In other words, the cash balance
number on the balance sheet — remember that a balance sheet lists your
assets, including cash — will resemble what the bank says you hold in cash.
If the QuickBooks balance sheet says instead that you’re holding $34 million
in cash, well, then you’ll know something is rotten in Denmark.

I
know that you’re eager to get started. After all, you have a business to
run. But before you can start using QuickBooks, you need to do some up-
front work. Specifically, you need to prepare for the QuickBooks EasyStep
Interview, and then you need to walk through the EasyStep Interview. (The
EasyStep Interview is just a thorough question-and-answer session that
QuickBooks uses to set itself up for you.) In this chapter, I describe how you
do all this stuff.
I assume that you know how Windows works. If you don’t, take the time to
read Chapter 1 of your Windows User’s Guide, or try the appropriate edition
of Windows For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (Wiley).
Getting Ready for the Big Interview
You need to complete three tasks to get ready for the EasyStep Interview:
 Make an important decision about your conversion date (the date you
convert from your old accounting system to QuickBooks).
 Prepare a trial balance as of the conversion date.
 Go on a scavenger hunt to collect a bunch of stuff that you’ll need or
find handy for the interview.

The big decision
Before you start fiddling with your computer or the QuickBooks software,
you need to choose the date — the so-called conversion date — on which you
want to begin using QuickBooks for your financial record keeping.
This decision is hugely important, because the conversion date that you
choose dramatically affects both the work you have to do to get QuickBooks
running smoothly and the initial usefulness of the financial information that
you collect and record by using QuickBooks.
You’ve got three basic choices:
 The right way: You can convert at the beginning of your accounting year
(which is, in most cases, the same as the beginning of the calendar
year). This way is the right way for two reasons. First, converting at the
beginning of the year requires the least amount of work from you.
Second, it means that you have all the current year’s financial informa-
tion in one system.
 The slightly awkward way: You can convert at the beginning of some
interim accounting period (probably the beginning of some month or
quarter). This approach works, but it’s slightly awkward because you
have to plug your year-to-date income and expenses numbers from the
old system into the new system. (If you don’t know what an interim
accounting period is, see Appendix B.)
 The my-way-or-the-highway way: You can convert at some time other
than what I call the right way and the slightly awkward way. Specifically,
you can choose to convert whenever you jolly well feel like it. You create
a bunch of unnecessary work for yourself if you take this approach, and
you pull out a bunch of your hair in the process. But you also have the
satisfaction of knowing that through it all, you did it your way — without
any help from me.
I recommend choosing the right way. What this choice means is that if it’s
late in the year — say, October — you just wait until January 1 of the next
year to convert. If it’s still early in the year, you can also retroactively convert
as of the beginning of the year. (If you do this, you need to go back and do
your financial record keeping for the first part of the current year by using
QuickBooks: entering sales, recording purchases, and so on.)
If it’s sometime in the middle of the year — say, Memorial Day or later — you
probably want to use the slightly awkward way. (I’m actually going to use the
slightly awkward way in this chapter because if you see how to convert to
QuickBooks by using the slightly awkward way, you know how to use both
the right way and the slightly awkward way.)
22
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

The trial balance of the century
After you decide when you want to convert, you need a trial balance.
“Yikes,” you say. “What’s a trial balance?” A trial balance simply lists all your
assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity account balances, as well as the year-to-
date income and expense numbers on a specified date (which, not coinciden-
tally, happens to be the conversion date). You need this data for the EasyStep
Interview and for some fiddling around that you need to do after you com-
plete the EasyStep Interview.
Creating a trial balance doesn’t have to be as hard as it sounds. If you’ve
been using another small business accounting system, such as the simpler
Quicken product from Intuit or the Simply Accounting program from
Computer Associates, you may be able to have your old system produce a
trial balance on the conversion date. In that case, you can get the balances
from your old system. (Consider yourself lucky if this is the case.)
Just to split hairs, the trial balance should show account balances at the very
start of the first day that you’ll begin using QuickBooks for actual accounting.
For example, if the conversion date is 1/1/2007, the trial balance needs to
show the account balances at one minute past midnight on 1/1/2007. This is
also the very same thing as showing the account balances at the very end of
the last day that you’ll be using the old accounting system — in other words,
at exactly midnight on 12/31/2006 if you’re converting to QuickBooks on
1/1/2007.
If your old system is rather informal (perhaps it’s a shoebox full of receipts),
or if it tracks only cash (perhaps you’ve been using Quicken), you need to do
a bit more work:
 To get your cash balance, you need to reconcile your bank account or
bank accounts (if you have more than one bank account) as of the con-
version date.
 To get your accounts receivable balance, you need to tally the total of
all your unpaid customer invoices.
 To get your other asset account balances, you need to know what each
asset originally cost. For depreciable fixed assets, you also need to pro-
vide any accumulated depreciation that has been claimed for that asset.
(Accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation that you’ve already
expensed for each asset.)
By the way, check out Appendix B if you have questions about account-
ing or accounting terminology, such as depreciation.
 To get your liability account balances, you need to know how much
you owe on each liability. If you trust your creditors — the people to
whom you owe the money — you may also be able to get this informa-
tion from their statements.
23
Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard

You don’t need to worry about the owner’s equity accounts. QuickBooks can
calculate your owner’s equity account balances for you, based on the differ-
ence between your total assets and your total liabilities. This method is a bit
sloppy, and accountants may not like it, but it’s a pretty good compromise. (If
you do have detailed account balances for your owner’s equity accounts, use
these figures — and know that you’re one in a million.)
If you’re using the slightly awkward way to convert to QuickBooks — in other
words, if your conversion date is some date other than the beginning of the
accounting year — you also need to provide year-to-date income and
expense balances. To get your income, cost of goods sold, expenses, other
income, and other expense account balances, you need to calculate the year-
to-date amount of each account. If you can get this information from your old
system, that’s super. If not, you need to get it manually. (If you suddenly have
images of yourself sitting at your desk late at night, tapping away on a ten-
key, you’re probably right. What’s more, you probably also need to allocate
half of another Saturday to getting up and running with QuickBooks.)
Just for fun, I’ve created the sample trial balance shown in Table 2-1. This
table shows you what a trial balance looks like if you convert at some time
other than at the beginning of the accounting year.

Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
About those debits and credits
Don’t get freaked out about those debits and
credits. You just need to keep them straight for
a few minutes. Here’s the scoop: For assets and
expenses, a debit balance is the same thing as
a positive balance. So a cash debit balance of
$5,000 means that you have $5,000 in your
account, and $20,000 of cost of goods sold means
that you incurred $20,000 of costs-of-goods
expense. For assets and expenses, a credit bal-
ance is the same thing as a negative balance. So
if you have a cash balance of –$5,000, your
account is overdrawn by $5,000. In the sample trial
balance shown in Table 2-1, the accumulated
depreciation shows a credit balance of $2,000,
which is, in effect, a negative account balance.
For liabilities, owner’s equity accounts, and
income accounts, things are flip-flopped. A
credit balance is the same thing as a positive bal-
ance. So an accounts payable credit balance of
$2,000 means that you owe your creditors $2,000.
A bank loan credit balance of $10,000 means that
you owe the bank $10,000. And a sales account
credit balance of $60,000 means that you’ve
enjoyed $60,000 worth of sales.
I know that I keep saying this, but do remember
that those income and expense account bal-
ances are year-to-date figures. They exist only
if the conversion date is after the start of the
financial year.

The mother of all scavenger hunts
Even after you’ve decided when you want to convert to QuickBooks and have
come up with a trial balance, you still need to collect a bunch of additional
information. I list these items in laundry-list fashion. What you want to do is
find all this stuff and then pile it up (neatly) in a big stack next to the computer:
 Last year’s federal tax return. QuickBooks asks which federal income
tax form you use to file your tax return and also about your taxpayer
identification number. Last year’s federal tax return is the easiest place
to find this stuff.
 Copies of all your most recent state and federal payroll tax returns. If
you prepare payroll for employees, QuickBooks wants to know about the
federal and state payroll tax rates that you pay, as well as some other stuff.
 Copies of all the unpaid invoices that your customers (or clients or
patients or whatever) owe you as of the conversion date. I guess this is
probably obvious, but the total accounts receivable balance shown on
your trial balance needs to match the total of the unpaid customer
invoices.
 Copies of all unpaid bills that you owe your vendors as of the conver-
sion date. Again, this is probably obvious, but the total accounts
payable balance shown on your trial balance needs to match the total of
the unpaid vendor bills.
 A detailed listing of any inventory items you’re holding for resale. This
list should include not only inventory item descriptions and quantities,
but also the initial purchase prices and the anticipated sales prices. In
other words, if you sell porcelain wombats, and you’ve got 1,200 of these
beauties in inventory, you need to know exactly what you paid for them.
 Copies of the prior year’s W-2 statements, W-4 statements for anybody
you’ve hired since the beginning of the prior year, detailed informa-
tion about any payroll tax liabilities you owe as of the conversion
date, and detailed information about the payroll tax deposits you’ve
made since the beginning of the year. You need the information shown
on these forms to adequately and accurately set up the QuickBooks pay-
roll feature. I don’t want to scare you, but this is probably the most
tedious part of setting up QuickBooks.
 If you’re retroactively converting as of the beginning of the year, you
need a list of all the transactions that have occurred since the begin-
ning of the year: sales, purchases, payroll transactions, and every-
thing and anything else. If you do the right-way conversion
retroactively, you need to reenter each of these transactions into the
new system. You actually enter the information after you complete the
EasyStep Interview that I describe later in this chapter, but you might as
well get all this information together now, while you’re searching for the
rest of the items for this scavenger hunt.
26
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

If you take the slightly awkward way, you don’t need to find the last item that
I described in the preceding list. You can just use the year-to-date income and
expense numbers from the trial balance.
Doing the EasyStep Interview
After you decide when you want to convert, prepare a trial balance as of the
conversion date, and collect the additional raw data that you need, you’re
ready to step through the EasyStep Interview.
Before you begin the interview, you have to start QuickBooks 2007. To do 
so, choose Start➪All Programs and then click the menu choices that lead 
to QuickBooks. (For example, I choose Start➪All Programs➪QuickBooks➪
QuickBooks Premier Edition 2007.) Or double-click the QuickBooks program
icon if you put one on the desktop during the installation.
QuickBooks comes in several flavors. The most common flavors are
QuickBooks Simple Start, QuickBooks Pro, and QuickBooks Premier. These
three programs differ in several significant ways: QuickBooks Simple Start is 
a special “light” version of QuickBooks, which looks completely different. (I
wrote another book, QuickBooks Simple Start For Dummies [Wiley], which you
should use instead of this book if you’re working with QuickBooks Simple
Start.) QuickBooks Pro includes the advanced job-costing and time-estimating
features, which I briefly describe in Chapter 16. It also includes the ability to
share a QuickBooks file over a network, as I describe in Appendix C. QuickBooks
Premier has features beyond the QuickBooks Pro features for accountants and
auditors who want to use QuickBooks for rather large small businesses.
I actually used another very special version of QuickBooks called QuickBooks
Accountants Edition to write this book. The Accountants Edition of
QuickBooks will pretend to be another version of the QuickBooks software,
and I told QuickBooks Accountants Edition to pretend to be QuickBooks
Premier for writing this book. I mention all this not to confuse you but so that
you understand why the figures you see here may look a wee bit different
from what you see on-screen. But other than minor cosmetic differences, the
various versions of QuickBooks all work the same way. You can use this book
for any of these program versions.
If this is the first time you’ve started QuickBooks, QuickBooks displays a wel-
come message box that asks you how you want to start. For example, you
can click a button to indicate that you want to see an overview tutorial,
explore QuickBooks, create a new company file, or open an existing company
data file.
27
Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard

What I suggest you do, however, is jump right into the fray. If you’ve never used
QuickBooks before — the likely case if you’ve started your reading here — click
the Create a New Company File button, which starts the EasyStep Interview. (If
you’ve already been using an earlier version of QuickBooks, you click the
button labeled Open an Existing Company File.)
The real fun begins at this point. The EasyStep Interview starts automatically,
displaying the dialog box shown in Figure 2-1.
If you aren’t starting QuickBooks for the first time, but you want to step
through the EasyStep Interview to set up a new company anyway, choose
File➪New Company.
To begin the interview, click the Start Interview button.
I should mention that the first EasyStep Interview dialog box identifies some
other setup options you can use to get started. For example, the screen sug-
gests that you might want to upgrade from Quicken. (Basically, that upgrade
just means that you want QuickBooks to try using Quicken data as a starting
point for QuickBooks — something that doesn’t work, in my experience.) A
simple bit of advice: Don’t try to “upgrade” the Quicken data. It’s just as easy
and usually considerably cleaner to just start from scratch.
The one group of new QuickBooks users who should probably try upgrading
their Quicken data are people who’ve done a really good job of keeping their
books with Quicken, including complete balance sheet information. No
offense, but you probably aren’t in this category. Sorry.
You can also, if you’re an accounting expert, just skip the EasyStep Interview.
But you don’t need to worry about that option either. You’re going to want to
take the setup process slow and easy.
Figure 2-1:

28
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Tip 1: Get to know the interview protocol
For the most part, to complete the EasyStep Interview, all you do is fill in text
boxes with the information that QuickBooks requests (see Figure 2-2) or
answer questions by clicking buttons clearly marked Yes and No. When you
finish answering a page of interview questions, click the Next button to move
to the following page of the interview.
If you ever decide that you want to change some piece of information that
you’ve entered on a previous page of the EasyStep Interview dialog box, you
can just click the Back button to back up. If you get partway through the
interview process and decide that it isn’t worth the time, just click the Leave
button in the lower-left corner, and QuickBooks closes the EasyStep
Interview dialog box. When you next restart QuickBooks, the EasyStep
Interview begins again.
Here are two other notes that may come in handy:
 The EasyStep Interview dialog box appears every time you start a new
company (which you do by choosing File➪New Company).
 QuickBooks purposely makes it difficult to delete a company that you
create in QuickBooks, so don’t make up an imaginary company to play
with unless you’re familiar enough with your operating system to delete
files.
At some point after QuickBooks starts, you’ll see a message box that asks
whether you want to register QuickBooks. If you don’t register, you can use
the product roughly a few times, and then — whammo! The program locks
up, and you can no longer access your files. Either you register it, or you
Figure 2-2:

company’s
trade name
and legal
name in this
dialog box.
29
Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard

can’t use it. I don’t like being forced to do something, but getting worked up
about having to register QuickBooks is a waste of time. The simplest option is
to just register. Here’s how: When QuickBooks displays the message box that
asks whether you want to register, click the Online button to register online,
or click the Phone button to register over the phone. If you go with the Phone
option, QuickBooks displays another dialog box that gives you a telephone
number to call and provides a space for you to enter your registration
number.
I don’t provide you a blow-by-blow account of what happens when you take
the interview. Instead, I provide you a handful of key tips that you can read
now and use later (during the interview) to make the process as easy and as
fast as possible.
Tip 2: Take your time
As you step through the interview process, the EasyStep Interview dialog box
displays a bunch of different pages with suggestions, instructions, and
advice. Take the time to read this information. Click the Help button if you
have questions. If the EasyStep Interview suggests that you view some
related document with helpful information, do so.
Tip 3: Get industry-specific advice
Industry-specific advice is one of the handiest QuickBooks features. For
example, are you a rancher or a farmer? QuickBooks includes a detailed
online document that describes some of the unique accounting challenges
that your business faces, provides tips for making your record keeping easier,
and points out QuickBooks features that might be of particular interest to
someone like you. Are you a retailer? A manufacturer? A writer? A consul-
tant? You can get this same sort of information, too.
QuickBooks displays industry-specific tips and tidbits of information
throughout the interview. Keep your eyes peeled for the green arrows that
mark these little hints. Let me mention one other quick pointer about this
industry-specific information stuff: You may not understand everything that
you read. That’s okay. You still want to read the tips and maybe jot them
down on a piece of paper as you go along. As you work with QuickBooks and
find out more about it, you’ll find that more and more of the information pro-
vided in the industry-specific tips makes sense.
30
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

To view a document of industry-specific information at any time, click the
Support link on the Navigation bar, and click the Industry-Specific
Information hyperlink. Click the List of Industries hyperlink and then select
your industry from the list in the Help window that QuickBooks displays. To
print a copy of the information, click the Options button, and choose Print
Topic from the drop-down list.
Some of the hyperlinks lead to resources at the www.quickbooks.com Web
site, so QuickBooks may prompt you to make an Internet connection to
access that information.
Tip 4: Accept the suggested 
filename and location
A few minutes into the EasyStep Interview, QuickBooks asks you to specify a
name and location for the file that it uses to store your accounting informa-
tion (see Figure 2-3). This is normally your company name anyway. I can think
of no good reason why you need to fiddle with or change the suggested file-
name or location. Don’t do it. Let QuickBooks name the QuickBooks file what-
ever it wants, and let QuickBooks store the file wherever it wants.
Figure 2-3:

Filename 
for New
Company
dialog box

change the
suggested
filename and
location, but
I don’t
recommend
doing so.
31
Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard

Tip 5: Go with the suggested 
chart of accounts
Immediately after you name the file that QuickBooks uses for storing your
financial information, the EasyStep Interview displays a dialog box that
shows a list of accounts that QuickBooks wants to use for tracking your busi-
ness’s financial condition. This dialog box also asks whether the list of
accounts is the one that you want to use. Unless you know quite a bit about
accounting and are willing to find out just as much about QuickBooks, I rec-
ommend that you accept the suggested chart of accounts. You make your
future record keeping much easier by doing so.
Tip 6: Consider tracking all your 
expenses with your checkbook
You get two choices regarding how to record your expenses:
 By using just your checkbook
 By creating a bills-to-pay list
QuickBooks asks this question in the dialog box shown in Figure 2-4. I want to
be careful about what I say next, because the decision you make in this dialog
box can really screw up your business. But here’s my suggestion: Consider
taking the second option — the one that says you don’t want to keep track of
the bills you owe.
Figure 2-4:
Simplify

32
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Now, before you rush off to the next EasyStep Interview question, confident
and happy in my suggestion, let me tell you about the implicit trade-off that
you’re making. If you select the no-tracking-of-bills-owed option, you do sim-
plify your record keeping — which is why I suggest that you take this route.
But the predictable catch is that you can’t track your unpaid bills as closely.
Until you sit down to actually write checks for your bills, you don’t really
know (precisely) how much money you owe vendors. What’s more, you can’t
separate the actual incurring of some expense from the cash outflow that
pays the expense. So by taking the no-tracking-of-bills-owed option, you’re
unable to do finely tuned accrual-basis accounting (unless you pay bills when
you incur them). And you aren’t able to closely monitor the money that you
owe to vendors.
In my business, I don’t track bills I owe, and that simplifies my record keep-
ing. But I’m probably a little unusual (at least for a small business) for a
couple reasons. First, almost all my expenses get negotiated up front and then
get fixed by contract. For this reason, I don’t use and don’t need to use
QuickBooks to keep track of and remind me about my unpaid bills. In effect,
the negotiations and contracts do that. Second, I’ve actually been in business
for quite a while — about two decades, in fact. So I don’t have the cash-flow
problems that many (most?) small businesses have, which means that if I
want to produce an accurate profit and loss statement or an accurate balance
sheet — one that includes all my expenses — I can just pay all my unpaid bills.
I guess the bottom line here is this: If you don’t need to use QuickBooks to
closely monitor your unpaid bills, and if you don’t mind losing profit-calculation
precision because of the lag between the time you incur an expense and the
time you pay the bill by writing a check, go ahead and skip the bill tracking.
This choice greatly simplifies one area of your record keeping.
Tip 7: Add accounts you need
As you step through the interview questions, QuickBooks asks a few times
whether you want to add an account (see Figure 2-5). Go ahead and do this —
and feel comfortable doing so. Adding accounts isn’t hard. (You need an
account for each individual asset, liability, income, or expense amount that
you want to track.)
33
Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard

The Rest of the Story
Throughout the preceding sections in this chapter, I describe how you pre-
pare for and then step through the EasyStep Interview. But even after the
EasyStep Interview is over, you need to take care of three other little jobs:
 You need to describe in detail your inventory, your customer receiv-
ables, and (if you chose to ignore my earlier suggestion about not track-
ing vendor bills you owe) your vendor payables.
 You need to describe your current business finances, including any year-
to-date revenue and year-to-date expenses that aren’t recorded as part
of getting your customer receivables and vendor payables entered into
QuickBooks.
 If you want to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to make an 
adjustment.
These chores aren’t time consuming, but they are the three most compli-
cated tasks that you need to do to set up QuickBooks. (If you aren’t sure what
the big deal is about accrual-basis accounting, I respectfully suggest that you
take a break here and read Appendix B.)
To set up the inventory records, you just identify the items you hold in inven-
tory, as described in Chapter 3.
Figure 2-5:

34
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

To set up your customer receivables and, if necessary, your vendor payables,
you first need to identify the customers and vendors, as described in Chapter 3.
After that work, you may need to enter customer invoices that were prepared
prior to the conversion date but that are still uncollected at conversion, as
described in Chapter 4. Similarly, you may need to enter vendor payables
that were incurred prior to the conversion date but that are still unpaid at
conversion.
I talk about this stuff more in the next chapter, so if you’re still okay with
doing some more installation and setup work, go ahead and flip to Chapter 3.
However . . .
Should You Get Your Accountant’s Help?
So should you get help from your accountant? Oh, shoot, I don’t know. If you
follow my directions carefully (both in this chapter and the next), and your
business’s financial affairs aren’t wildly complex, I think you can probably
figure out all this stuff on your own.
Having said that, however, I suggest that you at least think about getting your
accountant’s help at this juncture. Your accountant can do a much better job
of giving you advice that may be specific to your situation. In many cases,
your accountant can give you beginning trial balance amounts that agree
with your tax returns. The accountant probably knows your business and can
keep you from making a terrible mess of things, just in case you don’t follow
my directions carefully.
Just so you know, one of the things that I (as a CPA) do for my clients is help
them set up QuickBooks. Because I do this, I can give you a couple of pieces
of useful information about getting a CPA’s help in setting up. First, your CPA
(assuming that he or she already knows QuickBooks) should be able to help
you through the setup process in an hour or two. So your CPA can do it (or
help you do it) much faster than you can on your own. Second, an hour or so
of tutoring from your CPA should mean that you get enough help to record all
your usual transactions. With just this help, you can find out how to pay your
bills, how to invoice customers exactly the way you want, and how to pro-
duce reports. I used to pooh-pooh this kind of hand-holding, but the older
(and hopefully wiser) I get, the more I see that business owners and book-
keepers benefit from this up-front help. A bit of planning and expert advice in
the beginning can save you a whole lot of trouble later on.

T
he EasyStep Interview (which I discuss at some length in Chapter 2) doesn’t
actually get QuickBooks completely ready to use. You also need to enter
the names of all your products, employees, customers, and vendors (and a
handful of other items) into lists. In this chapter, I describe how you create
and work with these lists. I also describe how you clean up some of the
accounting messiness created when you enter information into these lists.
The Magic and Mystery of Items
The first QuickBooks list you need to set up is the Item list — the list of stuff
you buy and sell. Before you start adding to your Item list, however, I need to
tell you that QuickBooks isn’t very smart about its view of what you buy and
sell. It thinks that anything you stick on a sales invoice or a purchase order is
something you’re selling.
If you sell colorful coffee mugs, for example, you probably figure (and cor-
rectly so) that you need to add descriptions of each of these items to the
Item list. However, if you add freight charges to an invoice, QuickBooks
thinks that you’re adding another mug. And if you add sales tax to an invoice,
well, guess what? QuickBooks again thinks that you’re adding another mug.
This wacky definition of items is confusing at first. But just remember one
thing, and you’ll be okay: You aren’t the one who’s stupid; QuickBooks is. No,
I’m not saying that QuickBooks is a bad program. It’s a wonderful accounting
program and a great tool. What I’m saying is that QuickBooks is only a dumb

computer program; it isn’t an artificial-intelligence program. It doesn’t pick
up on the little subtleties of business — such as the fact that even though
you charge customers for freight, you aren’t really in the shipping business.
Each entry on the invoice or purchase order — the mugs that you sell, the
subtotal, the discount, the freight charges, and the sales tax — is an item.
Yes, I know this setup is weird, but getting used to the wackiness now makes
the discussions that follow much easier to understand.
If you want to see a sample invoice, take a peek at Figure 3-1. Just so you’re
not confused, to make more room for the invoice window, I removed the
QuickBooks Navigation bar that typically appears along the left edge of the
QuickBooks window.
Do you see those first three items: Rainbow Mugs, Yellow Mugs, and Blue
Mugs? You can see the sense of calling them items, right? These mugs are
things that you sell.
But then suppose that you give frequent buyers of your merchandise a 10
percent discount. To include this discount in your accounting, you need to
add a Subtotal item to tally the sale and then a Discount item to calculate the
discount. Figure 3-1 also shows this. See it? Kind of weird, eh?
Figure 3-1:
A sample

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Then look at the Shipping & Handling item, which charges the customer $50
for freight. Yep, that’s right — another item. In sum, everything that appears
on an invoice or a purchase order is an item that you need to describe in
your Item list.
Just above the invoice total, if you look closely, you can see another item for
including sales tax on your invoices — and that’s really an item, too.
I describe creating invoices in Chapter 4 and creating purchase orders in
Chapter 7.
Adding items you might include on invoices
To add invoice or purchase-order items to the Item list, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Item List.
QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the Item
List window, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2:
The
QuickBooks
Item List
window.
39
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

2. Click the Item button at the bottom of the Item List window, and
choose New from the drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-3.
3. Categorize the item.
Select an item type from the Type drop-down list. The Item list that you
see is dependent on the type of business you told QuickBooks you were
in when you set up the program, so use the following as a sample — the
amount and type of items that you need depend on the business you’re
in. Select one of the following item types by clicking the name in the list:
• Service: Select this type if you charge for a service — such as an
hour of labor or a repair job.
• Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something that
you buy from someone else — and you want to track your holdings
of the item. If you sell thingamajigs that you purchase from the
manufacturer Thingamajigs Amalgamated, for example, you specify
the item type as Inventory Part. (For more information on using
QuickBooks to track inventory, see Chapter 7.)
Figure 3-3:
The
QuickBooks
New Item
window.
40
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

• Inventory Assembly: Select this type if what you sell is something
that you make from other Inventory items. In other words, if you
buy raw materials or other components and then assemble these
things to create your finished product, the finished product is an
Inventory Assembly item.
• Non-Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something
that you don’t want to track as inventory. (You usually don’t use
this item type for products that you sell, by the way. Instead, you
use it for items that you buy for the business and need to include
on purchase orders.)
• Other Charge: Select this item type for things such as freight and
handling charges that you include on invoices.
• Subtotal: This item type adds everything before you subtract any
discount, add the sales tax, and so on.
• Group: Use this item type to enter a bunch of items (which are
already on the list) at one time. This item is a nice timesaver. For
example, if you commonly sell sets of items, you don’t have to
specify those items individually every time you write an invoice.
• Discount: This item type calculates an amount to be subtracted
from a subtotal.
• Payment: This option is wacky, but if your invoice sometimes
includes an entry that reduces the invoice total — customer
deposits at the time of sale, for example — select this item type. If
this item type confuses you, just ignore it.
• Sales Tax Item: Select this item type for the sales tax that you
include on the invoice.
• Sales Tax Group: This item type is similar to the Group item type,
but you use it only for sales taxes that are collected in one transac-
tion and owed to multiple agencies.
4. Type an item number or name.
Press the Tab key or use your mouse to click the Item Name/Number
text box below the Type drop-down list. Then type a short description of
the item.
5. (Optional) Make the item a subitem.
If you want to work with subitems — items that appear within other
items — select the Subitem Of check box, and use the corresponding
drop-down list to specify the parent item to which a subitem belongs.
41
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

If you set up a parent item for coffee mugs and subitems for blue, yellow,
and rainbow mugs, for example, you can produce reports that show
parent items (such as mugs) and subitems (such as the differently colored
mugs). Subitems are just an extra complexity, so if you’re new to this
QuickBooks stuff, I suggest that you keep things simple by avoiding them.
6. Describe the item in more detail.
Move the cursor to the Description text box, and type a description.
This description then appears on the invoice. Note that if you specified
the item type as Inventory Part in Step 3, you see two description text
boxes: Description on Purchase Transactions and Description on Sales
Transactions. The purchase description appears on purchase orders,
and the sales description appears on sales invoices.
7. If the item type is Service, Non-Inventory Part, or Other Charge, tell
QuickBooks how much to charge for the item, whether the item is sub-
ject to sales tax, and which income account to use for tracking the
income that you receive from selling the item.
• For a Service type, use the Rate text box to specify the price you
charge for one unit of the service. If you charge by the hour, for
example, the rate is the charge for an hour of service. If you charge
for a job — such as a repair job or the completion of a specific task —
the rate is the charge for the job or task.
• For a Non-Inventory Part type, use the Price text box to specify the
amount you charge for the item.
• For an Other Charge type, use the Amount or % text box, which
replaces the Rate text box, to specify the amount you charge for
the item. You can type an amount, such as 20 for $20.00, or you can
type a percentage. If you type a percentage, QuickBooks calculates
the Other Charge Amount as the percentage multiplied by the pre-
ceding item shown on the invoice. (You usually put in an Other
Charge after using a Subtotal item — something I talk about in the
“Creating other wacky items for invoices” section, later in this
chapter.)
• For all three types, use the Taxable check box to indicate whether
the item is taxed. (Note that the Taxable check box appears only if
you told QuickBooks in the EasyStep Interview that you charge
customers sales tax.)
• For all three types, use the Account drop-down list to specify which
income account you want to use to track the income that you
receive from the sale of this item. 
8. If the item type is Inventory Part, tell QuickBooks how much to
charge for the inventory part, how much the inventory part costs, and
which income account to use for tracking the product sales income.
For an Inventory Part item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item
window, as shown in Figure 3-4.
42
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays
to record the following information:
• Description on Purchase Transactions: Describe the part. This
description appears on the documents (such as purchase orders)
that you use when you buy items for your inventory.
• Cost: Specify the average cost per unit of the items that you cur-
rently have. This field acts as the default rate when you enter the
item on a purchase transaction.
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell it.
(QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve cre-
ated other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate account.)
• Preferred Vendor: Specify your first choice when ordering the item
for your business. (If the vendor isn’t on your Vendor list,
QuickBooks asks you to add it. If you say, “Yeah, I do want to add
it,” QuickBooks displays the Add Vendor window, which you can
then use to describe the vendor.)
• Description on Sales Transactions: Type a description of the item
that you want to appear on documents, such as invoices and so on,
that your customers see. (QuickBooks suggests the same descrip-
tion that you used in the Description on Purchase Transactions
text box as a default.)

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to
use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is proba-
bly the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use the
Resale Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales and
the Sales account to track retail (taxable) sales.
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this Inventory item’s value.
• Reorder Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item
that can remain before you order more. When the inventory level
drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to reorder the item. (To
see the Reminders list, choose Lists➪Reminders.)
• On Hand: Set this field to the physical count for the item at the con-
version date if you’re setting up an item for the first time as part of
setting up QuickBooks. Otherwise, leave this field set to zero.
• Total Value: Leave this field at zero, too.
• As Of: Enter the current date.
9. If the item type is Inventory Assembly, tell QuickBooks which cost-of-
goods-sold and income account to use for tracking the item, how much
to charge for the inventory assembly, and how to build the item from
other component inventory items.
Note: The Inventory Assembly item is available in QuickBooks Premier
but not in Simple Start or QuickBooks Pro.
For an Inventory Assembly item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item
window.
You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays
to record the following information:
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell
it. (QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve
created other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate
account.)
• Description: Type a description of the item that you want to appear
on documents that your customers see, such as invoices.
• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
44
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to
use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is probably
the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use the Resale
Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales and the Sales
account to track retail (taxable) sales.
• Components Needed: Use the Components Needed list box to identify
the component items and the quantities needed to make the inventory
assembly.
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this inventory item’s value.
• Build Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item that
can remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory
level drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to make more of the
item.
• On Hand: Set this field to the physical count for the item at the con-
version date if you’re setting up an item for the first time as part of
setting up QuickBooks. Otherwise, leave this field set to zero.
• Total Value: If you enter a value other than zero into the On Hand
field, set the total value amount as the cost of the items you’re
holding. Otherwise, leave this field at zero.
• As Of: Enter the conversion date into the As Of text box if you’re
describing some item as part of getting QuickBooks set up.
Otherwise, just enter the current date.
10. If the item type is Sales Tax Item, tell QuickBooks what sales tax rate
to charge and what government agency to pay.
Note: The Sales Tax Item version of the New Item window looks a little
different from the window shown in Figure 3-4. But this is straightforward
stuff. Enter the sales tax rate into the appropriate box and the state (or city
or whatever tax agency name) into the appropriate box:
• Tax Name and Description: Specify further details for later 
identification.
• Tax Rate: Specify the sales tax rate as a percentage.
• Tax Agency: Name the state or local tax agency that collects all the
loot that you remit. If the tax agency isn’t on the list, you can add it
by selecting Add New from the drop-down list.
11. If the item type is Payment, describe the payment method and how
you want QuickBooks to handle the payment.
You use payment items to record a down payment made when the
invoice is created to reduce the final balance due from the customer
later. Note: Retainers and Advance Deposits are handled differently.
45
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

Note: The Payment Item version of the New Item window looks a little
different from the window shown in Figure 3-4.
Use the Payment Method drop-down list to specify the method of pay-
ment for a Payment item. QuickBooks provides a starting list of several
of the usual payment methods. You can easily add more payment types
by choosing Add New from the drop-down list. When you choose this
entry, QuickBooks displays the New Payment Method dialog box. In the
dialog box’s only text box, identify the payment method: cows, beads,
shells, or some other what-have-you.
When you’re finished, use the area in the lower-left corner of the New
Item window to either group the payment with other undeposited funds
or, if you use the drop-down list, deposit the payment to a specific
account.
12. Click OK or Next when you’re finished.
When you finish describing one item, click OK to add the item to the list
and return to the Item List window. Click Next to add the item to the list
and keep the New Item window on-screen so that you can add more
items.
13. If you added a new Inventory item, record the purchase of the item.
After you finish describing any new inventory items, you need to make
another transaction in order to categorize the purchase of the items
(unless they just showed up one morning on your doorstep). For an
explanation of these transactions, turn to Chapter 7.
Creating other wacky items for invoices
In the preceding section, I don’t describe all the items that you can add. For
example, you can create a Subtotal item to calculate the subtotal of the items
you list on an invoice. (You usually need this subtotal when you want to cal-
culate a sales tax on the invoice’s items.) You might want to create other
wacky items for your invoices as well, such as discounts. I describe these
special types of items in the next few sections.
Creating Subtotal items to stick subtotals on invoices
You need to add a Subtotal item if you ever want to apply a discount to a
series of items on an invoice. (I show a Subtotal item on the invoice shown in
Figure 3-1.) To add a Subtotal item to your Item list, choose Lists➪Item List,
click the Item button, and select New from the drop-down list. This displays
the New Item window — the same one I show several times earlier in this
chapter. Specify the item type as Subtotal and then provide an item name
(such as Subtotal).
46
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

When you want to subtotal items on an invoice, all you do is stick this
Subtotal item on the invoice after the items you want to subtotal. Keep in
mind, though, that QuickBooks doesn’t set up a subtotal feature automati-
cally. You have to add a Subtotal item; otherwise, you can apply a Discount
item that you create only to the single item that immediately precedes the
discount. A Discount item, by the way, calculates a discount on an invoice.
Creating Group items to batch stuff you sell together
You can create an item that puts one line on an invoice that’s actually a com-
bination of several other items. To add a Group item, display the New Item
window and specify the item type as Group. QuickBooks displays the New
Item window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
For example, if you sell three items — say, blue mugs, rainbow mugs, and
yellow mugs — but sometimes sell the items together in a set, you can create
an item that groups the three items. Note that when you create a group, you
continue to track the group member inventories individually and don’t track
the inventory of the group as a new item.
Figure 3-5:
The
QuickBooks
New Item
window

47
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

In the New Item window, use the Item/Description/Qty list box to list each
item included in the group. When you click an item line in the Item/
Description/Qty list box, QuickBooks places a downward-pointing arrow at
the right end of the Item column. You click this arrow to open a drop-down
list of items. (If the list is longer than can be shown, you can use the scroll
bar on the right to move up and down the list.) If you select the Print Items in
Group check box, QuickBooks lists all the items in the group on invoices. (In
the case of the mugs, invoices list the individual blue, rainbow, and yellow
mugs instead of just listing the group name, such as Mug Set.)
Creating Discount items to add discounts to invoices
You can create an item that calculates a discount and sticks the discount on
an invoice as another line item. (I show a Discount item on the invoice that
appears in Figure 3-1.) To add a Discount item to the list, display the New
Item window, specify the item type as Discount, and provide an item name or
number and a description.
Use the Amount or % text box to specify how the discount is calculated. If the
discount is a set amount (such as $50.00), type the amount. If the discount is
calculated as a percentage, enter the percentage, including the percent
symbol. When you enter a percentage, QuickBooks calculates the discount
amount as the percentage multiplied by the preceding item shown on the
invoice. (If you want to apply the discount to a group of items, you need to
use a Subtotal item and follow it with the discount.)
Use the Account drop-down list to specify the expense account that you want
to use to track the cost of the discounts you offer.
Click Apply Discount Before Taxes if you want to use this option. (This option
appears only if you indicated in the EasyStep Interview that you charge sales
tax.)
You probably want to check with your local sales tax revenue agency to
determine whether sales tax should be calculated before or after the 
discount.
If you need to collect sales tax, and you didn’t set up this function in the
EasyStep Interview, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Sales Tax icon in the list on the left, click the Company
Preferences tab, and select the Yes option button in the Do You
Charge Sales Tax area.
3. Add the Sales Tax item(s) to your Item list.
48
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Creating Sales Tax Group items to batch sales taxes together
Sales Tax Groups enable you to batch several sales taxes that you’re sup-
posed to charge as one tax so that they appear as a single sales tax on the
invoice. Combining the taxes is necessary — or at least possible — when
you’re supposed to charge, say, a 6.5 percent state sales tax, a 1.7 percent
county sales tax, and a 0.4 percent city sales tax, but you want to show one
all-encompassing 8.6 percent sales tax on the invoice.
To add a Sales Tax Group item, display the New Item window, and specify the
item type as Sales Tax Group. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as
shown in Figure 3-6. Use the Tax Item/Rate/Tax Agency/Description list box to
list the other sales tax items that you want to include in the group. When you
click an item line in the list box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at the right
end of the Tax Item column. You can click this arrow to open a drop-down list
of Sales Tax items.
Editing items
If you make a mistake, you can change any piece of item information by dis-
playing the Item List window and double-clicking the item so that QuickBooks
displays the Edit Item window, which you can use to make changes.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

Adding Employees to Your Employee List
If you do payroll in QuickBooks, or if you track sales by employees, you need
to describe each employee. Describing employees is pretty darn easy. Click
the Employee Center icon at the top of the screen to display the Employee
Center window. Then click the New Employee button that appears just above
the list on the upper-left side of the screen to have QuickBooks display the
New Employee window, shown in Figure 3-7.
The New Employee window is pretty straightforward, right? You just fill in the
fields to describe the employee.
Lesser computer-book writers would probably provide step-by-step descrip-
tions of how you move the cursor to the First Name text box and type the
person’s first name, how you move the cursor to the next text box, type
something there, and so on. Not me. No way. I know that you can tell just by
looking at this window that all you do is click a text box and type the obvious
bit of information. Right?
Figure 3-7:
The New
Employee
window.
50
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

I do need to tell you a couple of important things about the New Employee
window, however:
 When you release an employee, it’s important to enter the release date
for the employee on the Employment Info tab after you’ve written that
final paycheck. (To change to a new tab, choose the new tab from the
cleverly named Change Tabs drop-down list.) This way, when you
process payroll in the future, you can’t accidentally pay the former
employee.
 As for the Type field, most employees probably fit the regular category.
If you’re uncertain whether an employee fits the guidelines for corporate
officer, statutory employee, or owner, see the Circular E publication from
the IRS. And sleep tight.
The Address and Contact tab provides boxes for you to collect and store
address information. The Additional Info tab enables you to create customiz-
able fields in case you want to keep information that isn’t covered by the
QuickBooks default fields — favorite color and that type of thing. Again, what
you need to do on this tab is fairly straightforward. By the way, if you’ve told
QuickBooks that you want to do payroll, QuickBooks prompts you to enter
the information it needs to calculate things like federal and state income
taxes, payroll taxes, and vacation pay.
51
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists
Inactivating list items
One of the neat features in QuickBooks is that it
enables you to simplify your lists by hiding items
that are no longer active, including those that
you expect to be active again later. If you have
seasonal employees, you can hide them from
your Employee list during the times of the year
when they don’t work. Or if you sell commemo-
rative key chains only every five years, you can
keep them from cluttering your Item list in the
off years. You can also inactivate customers
and vendors from their respective lists.
To inactivate something from a list, all you have
to do is open the list and double-click the item.
When QuickBooks opens the item, employee,
customer, or vendor that you want to inactivate,
select the Item Is Inactive check box. (The name
of the check box changes, depending on what
you’re trying to inactivate.) Then click OK.
QuickBooks hides this member from your list.
The next time you display the list, the Include
Inactive box appears.
To view and edit hidden members of your list,
just click the Include Inactive box. Any inactive
members show up with X icons beside them. If
you want to reactivate a member, all you have
to do is click the X icon, and the member is
reactivated.

After you finish describing an employee, click OK to add the employee to the
list and return to the Employee List window, or click Next to add the
employee to the list and add more employees.
You can also inactivate an employee from your list if it starts to get cluttered
with names of employees who no longer work for you. Read about inactivat-
ing items, employees, customers, and vendors in the sidebar “Inactivating list
items” elsewhere in this chapter. I recommend waiting to inactivate them
until after the year is finished and the W-2 forms have been printed.
Customers Are Your Business
Here’s how you add customers to your Customer list:
1. Choose Customers➪Customer Center.
The Customer Center window appears.
2. Click the New Customer button.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Customer window,
as shown in Figure 3-8. Use this window to describe the customer in as
much detail as possible.
3. Type the customer’s name.
Enter the name of the customer as you want it to appear in the
Customer list. You can list customers by company name or by the repre-
sentative’s last name.
4. Enter the company name.
5. (Optional) Enter the name of your contact, along with other pertinent
information.
Move the cursor to the Mr./Ms. text box, and type the appropriate title.
Same with the First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. (QuickBooks
automatically fills in the names in the Contact text box as you type
them. Nice touch, eh?)
Go ahead and fill in the Phone, FAX, Alt. Phone, and E-Mail text boxes
while you’re at it.
6. (Really optional) Type the name of your alternate contact in the Alt.
Contact text box.
52

7. Enter the billing address.
You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s billing
address. QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first
lines of the billing address, so you need to enter only the address. To
move from the end of one line to the start of the next, press Enter.
8. Enter the shipping address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the customer’s shipping
address if this address differs from the Bill To address. (If it’s the same,
just click the Copy button.) You enter this information in the same way
that you enter the Bill To address. A few deft mouse clicks. Some typing.
You’re done.
9. (Optional) Click the Additional Info tab, and record some more data.
When you click this tab, QuickBooks displays the tab shown in Figure
3-9. You can use this tab to describe the customer in more detail.
10. (Optional) Click the Payment Info tab, and record some more data.
You can use the boxes on the Payment Info tab (see Figure 3-10) to
record bits of customer information, such as the account number that
should be included with any payments.
Figure 3-8:

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

11. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab to add specific job information.
Because you’re creating a new customer account, not invoicing by jobs, I
explain this step in the next section. If you’re the “can’t wait” type, feel
free to take a look. You can add a specific job to the new customer’s
information.
12. Save the customer information by clicking OK or Next.
When you finish describing a customer, you can save it in one of two
ways: Click OK to add the customer to the list and return to the
Customer Center window, or click Next to add the customer to the list
and keep the New Customer window on-screen so that you can add
more customers.
If you want to change some bit of customer information, display the
Customer Center window, double-click the customer you want to change, and
then make changes in the Edit Customer window.

It’s Just a Job
In QuickBooks, you can track invoices by customer or by customer and job.
This may sound kooky, but some businesses invoice customers (perhaps sev-
eral times) for specific jobs.
Take the case of a construction subcontractor who does foundation work for
a handful of builders of single-family homes. This construction subcontractor
probably invoices his customers by job, and he invoices each customer sev-
eral times for the same job. For example, he invoices Poverty Rock Realty for
the foundation job at 1113 Birch Street when he pours the footing and then
again when he lays the block. At 1028 Fairview, the same foundation job takes
more than one invoice, too.
To set up jobs for customers, you first need to describe the customers (as I
explain in the preceding section). Then follow these steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Customer Center.
QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window.
Figure 3-10:
The
Payment

55
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

2. Right-click the customer for whom you want to set up a job, and
choose Add Job from the contextual menu that appears.
QuickBooks displays the New Job window (shown in Figure 3-11). You
use this window to describe the job. A great deal of the information in
this window appears on the invoice.
3. Add the job name.
The cursor is in the Job Name text box. Just type the name of the job or
project.
4. Identify the customer.
On the off chance that you selected the wrong customer in Step 2, take a
peek at the Customer drop-down list. Does it name the correct customer?
If not, activate the drop-down list, and select the correct customer.
5. (Optional) Name your contact, and fill in other relevant information.
You can enter the name of your contact and alternative contact in the
Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. QuickBooks fills in
the Contact text box for you. You probably don’t need to be told this,
but fill in the Phone and FAX text boxes just so that you have that infor-
mation on hand. If you want to get really optional, fill in the Alt. Phone
and Alt. Contact text boxes. Go ahead: Take a walk on the wild side.

6. Enter the job’s billing address.
You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s job billing
address. Because chances are good that the job billing address is the
same as the customer billing address, QuickBooks copies the billing
address from the Customer list. But if need be, make changes.
7. Enter the Ship To address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the job’s shipping address.
Click the Copy button if the shipping address is the same as the Bill To
address.
8. (Massively optional) Click the Additional Info tab, and categorize
the job.
You can use the Customer Type drop-down list to give the job type. The
only initial types in the default list are Corporate and Referral. You can
create other types by choosing Add New from the Customer Type drop-
down list (so that QuickBooks displays the New Customer Type dialog
box) and then filling in the dialog-box blanks.
9. Click the Payment Info tab, and set the customer’s credit limit (that is,
if you’ve given the customer a credit limit).
You can set the customer’s credit limit by using the Credit Limit box.
10. Specify the total of the customer’s unpaid invoices by using the
Opening Balance text box.
Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box, and type the total
amount owed by the customer on the conversion date.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists
The little things do matter
If you aren’t familiar with how payment terms
work, you can get a bird’s-eye view here. For the
most part, payment terms just tell the customer
how quickly you expect to be paid. For example,
Due on Receipt means that you expect to be
paid as soon as possible. If Net is followed by
some number, as in Net 15 or Net 30, the number
indicates the number of days after the invoice
date within which the customer is supposed to
pay. So Net 15 means that the customer is sup-
posed to pay within 15 days of the invoice date.
Some payment terms, such as 2% 10 Net 30,
include early payment discounts. In other
words, the customer can deduct 2 percent from
the bill if it’s paid within 10 days. Either way, the
customer must pay the bill within 30 days. For
more information on how to make early pay-
ment discounts work for you, see Chapter 21.

QuickBooks suggests that you not enter a balance in the Opening
Balance box as part of setting QuickBooks up. (If you’re interested in the
logic of QuickBook’s argument, you can view the Customers online tutor-
ial, which is available by choosing Help➪QuickBooks Learning Center
and then clicking the How to Enter Your Customers link.) However, I’ve
thought long and hard about this, and I think you want to enter the cus-
tomer’s unpaid balance into the Opening Balance box. Doing this makes
setting up QuickBooks correctly much easier.
11. Enter the current date in the As Of text box.
12. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab, and add specific job information.
Figure 3-12 shows the Job Info tab. You can use the Job Status drop-
down list to choose None, Pending, Awarded, In Progress, Closed, or Not
Awarded, whichever is most appropriate. The Start Date is (I know that
this one is hard to believe) the day you start the job. As anyone knows,
the Projected End and the End Date aren’t necessarily the same. Don’t
fill in the End Date until the job is actually finished. The Job Description
field can contain any helpful information you can fit on one line, and the
Job Type is an extra field you can use. (If you do use this field, you can
add a new job type by choosing Add New from the Job Type list.)
Figure 3-12:
The Job 
Info tab.

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

13. Save the job information by clicking OK or Next.
After you finish describing the job, you have two options: You can click
OK to add the job to the list and return to the Customer Center window,
or you can click Next to add the job to the list and keep the New Job
window on-screen so that you can add more jobs.
You can edit job information the same way that you edit customer informa-
tion. Display the Customer Center window by choosing Customer➪Customer
Center. When QuickBooks displays the window, double-click the job, and
make the changes in the Edit Job window that appears.
Adding Vendors to Your Vendor List
Adding vendors to your Vendor list works in the same basic way as adding
customers to your Customer list. Here’s how to get the job done:
1. Choose Vendors➪Vendor Center or click the Vendor Center icon at the
top of the screen.
QuickBooks displays the Vendor Center window. Along with listing your
vendors, it lists any sales tax agencies that you identified as part of set-
ting up Sales Tax items.
2. Click the New Vendor button.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Vendor window, as
shown in Figure 3-13. You use this window to describe the vendors and
all their little idiosyncrasies.
3. Enter the vendor’s name.
The cursor is already in the Vendor Name text box. All you have to do is
type the vendor’s name as you want it to appear on the Vendor list. If
you want to list your vendors by company name, enter the company
name. To list them by the first or last name of the sales representative,
enter one of these names. Just remember, the list is going to sort, alpha-
betically or numerically, by the information you enter in this field, not by
the information down below.
4. (Optional) Enter the name of your contact.
Fill in the Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. QuickBooks
fills in the Contact text box for you automatically.
5. Enter the address to which you’re supposed to mail checks.
You can use the Address text box to provide the vendor’s address.
QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first line of
the address, so you need to enter only the street address, city, state, and
zip code. To move from the end of one line to the start of the next, press
Enter.
59
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

6. (Optional) Enter the vendor’s telephone and fax numbers, and, if
available, the e-mail address.
The window also has an Alt. Phone text box for a second telephone
number. They thought of everything, didn’t they?
7. Verify the entry in the Print on Check As text box.
QuickBooks assumes that you want the company name to appear on any
checks you write for this vendor. If not, change the text box to whatever
you feel is more appropriate.
8. At this point, click the Additional Info tab.
The window you see on-screen hopefully bears an uncanny resemblance
to Figure 3-14.
9. (Optional) Enter your account number in the Account No. text box.
If the vendor has assigned account numbers or customer numbers to
keep track of customers, type your account or customer number in the
Account No. text box. You can probably get this piece of information
from the vendor’s last invoice.
An account number is required if you want to use QuickBooks’ online
bill payment feature (which I describe in Chapter 13) to pay the vendor.
QuickBooks transfers the account number to the memo field of the pay-
ment check.
Figure 3-13:
The
Address
Info tab of
the New
Vendor
window.

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

10. Categorize the vendor by selecting an option from the Type drop-down list.
See that Type drop-down list box? If you open the list, you see the initial
QuickBooks list of vendor types. You can pick any of these types, but my
suggestion is that you diligently identify any vendor to whom you need
to send a 1099 Form as a 1099 contractor. (A 1099 contractor is any unin-
corporated business or person who performs services and to whom you
pay $600 or more during the year.) 
To create a new vendor type, select Add New from the drop-down list
and fill in the blanks in the New Vendor Type dialog box that QuickBooks
displays. You can create as many new vendor types as you need.
11. Specify the payment terms that you’re supposed to observe by select-
ing a term from the Terms drop-down list.
QuickBooks has already set up all the usual ones. (If you want to, you
can choose Add New to set up additional payment terms.)
If a vendor offers an early payment discount, it’s usually too good a deal
to pass up. Interested in more information about early payment dis-
counts? Is yours an inquiring mind that needs to know? See Chapter 21
to find out about the advantages of early payment discounts.
12. (Optional) Specify your credit limit, if the vendor has set one.
This procedure is obvious, right? You click the Credit Limit text box and
enter the number.
Figure 3-14:
The
Additional
Info tab of
the New
Vendor
window.
61
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

13. (If applicable) Store the vendor’s federal tax identification number
and select the Vendor Eligible for 1099 check box.
This number might be the vendor’s Social Security number if the vendor
is a one-person business. If the vendor has employees, the federal tax
identification number is the vendor’s employer identification number.
You need this information only if you’re required to prepare a 1099 for
the vendor.
14. Type 0 (zero) in the Opening Balance text box.
You typically don’t want to enter the amount you owe the vendor; you
do that later, when you pay your bills. However, if you’re using accrual
basis accounting for your expenses (this just means that your account-
ing system counts bills as expenses when you get the bill and not when
you pay the bill), you need to tell QuickBooks what amounts you owe
vendors at the conversion date. You can do that most easily by entering
opening balances for vendors into the Opening Balance box as you set
up a vendor in the Vendor list.
15. Enter the conversion date in the As Of text box.
What you’re doing here, by the way, is providing the date on which the
value shown in the Opening Balance text box is correct.
16. Save the vendor information by clicking OK or Next.
After you finish describing the vendor, you have two options: Click OK to
add the vendor to the list and return to the Vendor Center window, or
click Next to add the vendor to the list and leave the New Vendor
window on-screen so that you can add more vendors.
The Other Lists
Throughout the preceding sections, I cover almost all the most important
lists. A few others I haven’t talked about yet are Fixed Asset, Price Level,
Sales Tax Code, Classes, Other Names, Sales Rep, Customer Type, Vendor
Type, Job Type, Terms, Customer Messages, Payment Method, Ship Via, and
Memorized Transactions. I don’t give blow-by-blow descriptions of how you
use these lists because you don’t really need them. The other QuickBooks
lists are generally more than adequate. You can usually use the standard lists
as is, without building other lists.
Just so I don’t leave you stranded, however, I want to give you quick-and-
dirty descriptions of these other lists and what they do.
To see some of these lists, choose the list from the Lists menu, or choose
Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists and choose the list from the submenu
that QuickBooks displays.
62
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

The Fixed Asset list
If you buy fixed assets — things such as vehicles, various pieces of furniture,
miscellaneous hunks of equipment, and so on — somebody is supposed to be
tracking this stuff in a list. Why? You need to have this information at your
fingertips (or at your accountant’s fingertips) to calculate depreciation. And
if you later dispose of some item, you need this information to calculate the
gain or loss on the sale of the item.
For these reasons, QuickBooks includes a Fixed Asset list. Figure 3-15 shows
the Fixed Asset Item List window, used to describe and identify your fixed
assets.
Note: I should tell you that your CPA or tax accountant already has such a list
that he or she has been maintaining for you. So don’t, like, totally freak out
because this is the first you’ve heard about this fixed assets business.
Chapter 18 describes handling fixed assets in a bit more detail.
Figure 3-15:
The Fixed
Asset Item
List window.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

The Price Level list
The first time I encountered the QuickBooks Price Level feature, I was sorely
confused about how the feature worked. I’m still a little confused — not
about how the feature works, but about who’d really want to use this feature.
But heck, what do I know? Here’s the deal: Price Levels enable you to adjust
an item price as you’re creating an invoice. For example, you can create a
price level that increases the price for some item by 20 percent. And you
create a price level that decreases the price for some item by 10 percent. You
adjust a price by selecting a price level from the Price field on an invoice.
(This may not make much sense until you see the Create Invoices window,
which I describe in Chapter 4, but it’s fairly straightforward.)
The Sales Tax Code list
The Sales Tax Code list just maintains a list of sales tax codes. These sales tax
codes, when used on an invoice or bill, tell QuickBooks whether items are
taxable.
The Class list
Classes enable you to classify transactions by department or location, for
example, so that you can track trends and assess performance across parts
of your business. Classes are cool, really cool. But they add another dimen-
sion to the accounting model that you use in QuickBooks, so I’m not going to
describe them here. I urge you — nay, I implore you — to get comfortable
with how the rest of QuickBooks works before you begin mucking about with
classes. Here are just a handful of useful tidbits in case you want to use
classes:
 You may need to turn on the QuickBooks Class Tracking feature. To do
this, choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon, click the
Company Preferences tab, and select the Use Class Tracking check box.
Note: The Class box appears in data entry windows only after you turn
on class tracking.
 To display the Class list, choose Lists➪Class List.
 To add classes to the Class list, display the Class List window (choose
Lists➪Class List), right-click the window, choose New to display the New
Class window, and then fill in the blanks.
 To tag transactions as falling into a particular class — invoices, checks,
bills, journal entries, and so on — select the appropriate class from the
Class list box.
64
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

By the way, one other point: Before you go off and start using classes to com-
plicate your accounting, make sure that you can’t get what you want by beef-
ing up your chart of accounts. 
You don’t see a Class List command in the Lists menu if you indicated during
the EasyStep Interview that you don’t want to use classes.
The Other Names list
QuickBooks provides an Other Names list that works as a watered-down,
wimpy Vendor and Employee list combination. You can write checks to
people named on this Other Names list, but you can’t do anything else. You
can’t create invoices or purchase orders for them, for example. And you
don’t get any of the other information that you want to collect for vendors or
employees.
You’re really better off working with good, accurate, rich Vendor and
Employee lists. If you don’t like this suggestion, however, just choose
Lists➪Other Names List to display the Other Names List window, click the
Other Names button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the
blanks in the New Name window.
The Sales Rep list
You can create a list of the sales representatives you work with and then indi-
cate which sales rep sells to a customer or generates a sale. To do this,
choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Sales Rep. When you choose
this command, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep List window, which lists all
the sales representatives. To add sales representatives, click the Sales Rep
button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that
QuickBooks displays.
Customer, Vendor, and Job Types list
You can create lists of customer types, vendor types, and job types and then
use these lists to categorize customer, vendor, and job information. This is prob-
ably no surprise, but to do this, you need to use the appropriate command:
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Customer Type List
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Vendor Type List
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Job Type List
65
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

When you choose one of these commands, QuickBooks displays the appro-
priate List window, which lists all the Customer types, Vendor types, or Job
types. To add types, click the Type button, select New from the drop-down
list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
How you use any of these types of lists depends on your business. In a situa-
tion in which you want to sort or segregate customers, vendors, or jobs in
some unusual way, use the Customer Type, Vendor Type, or Job Type list.
Over the last few years, I’ve used the Customer Type box to identify which
marketing technique has brought me a client: yellow-pages advertising, news-
paper advertising, professional referrals, and so on. Because QuickBooks
easily prints reports that summarize client revenue by customer type, using
the Customer Type field in this manner lets me easily see how much revenue
different marketing activities produce — and when I’m getting a decent
return on my marketing dollars.
The Terms list
QuickBooks maintains a Terms list, which you use to specify what payment
terms are available. To add terms, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile
Lists➪Terms List. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the
Terms List window. To add more terms, click the Terms button, select New
from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Customer Message list
This list is another minor player in the QuickBooks drama. You can stick mes-
sages at the bottom of invoices if you first type the message in the Customer
Message list. QuickBooks provides a handful of boilerplate messages: thank
you, happy holidays, mean people suck, and so on. You can add more mes-
sages by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Customer Message
List. When QuickBooks displays the Customer Message List window, click its
Customer Message button and choose New. Then use the New Customer
Message window that QuickBooks displays to create a new message.
The Payment Method list
Now this will be a big surprise. (I’m just kidding.) QuickBooks provides
descriptions for the usual payment methods. But, of course, you can add to
these by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Payment Method.
When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the lost city of
Atlantis. Okay, not really. QuickBooks actually displays the Payment Method
66
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

window. To add more methods, click the Payment Method button, select New
from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Ship Via list
QuickBooks provides descriptions for the usual shipping methods. These
descriptions are probably entirely adequate. If you need to add more, how-
ever, you can do so by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪
Ship Via. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the Ship 
Via List window, which lists all the shipping methods that you or QuickBooks
said are available. To add more methods, click the Shipping Method button,
select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that
QuickBooks displays. Friends, it doesn’t get much easier than this.
The Vehicle list
As I describe in a bit more detail in Chapter 18, QuickBooks provides a
Vehicle list that you can use to maintain a list of business vehicles. To see the
Vehicle list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Vehicle List.
When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List
window, which lists all the vehicles that you previously said are available. To
identify additional vehicles, click the Vehicle button, select New from the
drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
To record vehicle mileage inside QuickBooks, choose Company➪Enter
Vehicle Mileage. Then use the window that QuickBooks displays to identify
the vehicle, the trip length in miles, the trip date, and a bit of other trip-
related information.
The Memorized Transaction list
The Memorized Transaction list isn’t really a list. At least, it’s not like the
other lists that I describe in this chapter. The Memorized Transaction list is a
list of accounting transactions — invoices, bills, checks, purchase orders,
and so on — that you’ve asked QuickBooks to memorize. To display the
Memorized Transaction list, choose Lists➪Memorized Transaction List.
You can have QuickBooks memorize transactions so that you can quickly
record them later or even put them on a schedule for recurring usage. This fea-
ture can save you lots of time, especially for transactions you regularly make.
67
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

The Reminders list
Here’s a list that isn’t accessible from the Lists menu. QuickBooks keeps
track of a bunch of stuff that it knows you need to monitor. If you choose
Company➪Reminders, QuickBooks displays the Reminders window. Here,
you see such entries such as invoices and checks that need to be printed,
inventory items you should probably reorder, and so on.
Organizing and Printing Lists
To organize a list, you must be in single-user mode. (I describe multi-user
mode in Appendix C.) Here are some ways that you can organize your list:
 To move an item and all its subitems, click the diamond beside the
item, and drag the item up or down the list to a new location.
 To make a subitem its own item, click the diamond beside the item, and
drag it to the left.
 To make an item a subitem, first move the item so that it’s directly
beneath the item you want it to fall under. Then click the diamond
beside the item, and drag it to the right.
 To alphabetize a list, click the button in the lower-left corner of the list
window. (The name of this button changes, depending on the list that
you’re displaying.) Then choose Re-Sort List from the pop-up menu.
Sensing that you definitely mean business and don’t want it fooling
around, QuickBooks displays a message box that asks whether you’re
sure that you want to re-sort your list. Click OK to alphabetize.
You can’t reorganize the Vendor list.
Jotting down notes for list items
To enter more information about a name on a list, display the list, and select
the customer, vendor, employee, or other name. Then click the button in the
lower-left corner of the list window. (The name of this button changes,
depending on the type of list.) Choose Notepad from the pop-up menu. In the
Notepad dialog box that appears for the person, type your notes, and click
OK. You can also click Date Stamp to stamp the current date on the note.
68
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Printing lists
You can print customer, vendor, and employee lists by clicking the Print
button at the top of the specific Center screen for the type of list you choose.
The list will be among the options available to print in a drop-down list.
You can print a regular list by displaying the list, clicking the button in the
lower-left corner of the list window, and then choosing Print List. However,
often the best way to print a list is to print a list report. You can create, cus-
tomize, and print a list report by choosing Reports➪List and then choosing
the list that you want to print. You can also create one of a handful of list
reports by clicking the Reports button in the list window and choosing a
report from the pop-up menu. For more information on printing reports, see
Chapter 15.
Click the Activities button in a list window to quickly access common activi-
ties associated with the items on that list. Or click Reports to quickly access
common reports related to the items on the list.
Exporting List Items to 
Your Word Processor
If you use QuickBooks to store the names and addresses of your customers,
vendors, and employees, you can create a text file of the contact information
for these people. You can then export this file to another application, like a
word processor, to create reports that use this information.
To export list information to a text file, click the button in the lower-left
corner of the list window, and choose Print List. When QuickBooks displays
the Print dialog box, select the File option button, click Print, and then pro-
vide a filename when prompted.
The File menu’s Print Forms command also provides a Labels command for
producing mailing labels for customers and vendors.
Dealing with the Chart of Accounts List
I saved the best for last. After you get done setting up your lists, you still
need to finalize one list: the Chart of Accounts. The Chart of Accounts just
lists the accounts you and QuickBooks use to track income and expenses,
assets, liabilities, and equity.
69
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

This is kind of a funny step, however, because a bunch of Chart of Accounts
stuff is already set up. So what you’re really doing here is just finalizing the
chart of accounts. Typically, this consists of two or possibly three separate
steps: describing customer balances, describing vendor balances, and enter-
ing the rest of the trial balance.
Describing customer balances
If you entered customer unpaid invoice totals when you set up the customers —
which is what I recommend — you’ve already described your customer bal-
ances. You, my friend, can skip ahead to the next section, “Describing vendor
balances.”
If you didn’t enter customer unpaid invoice totals, you need to supply that
information before you finalize the chart of account information. To do this,
you enter the invoice in the usual way — which I describe in Chapter 4. The
one really important thing to do is use the original invoice date when you
enter the invoice.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Hey, dude. The order of your instructions is
all screwed up. Here I am, slogging through Chapter 3, and now totally out of the
blue, you’re telling me that I have to jump ahead to Chapter 4 and read that?”
Yeah, well, that’s right. This jumping around and jumping ahead is the big
reason that I told you earlier to do it the way I did. Hey, sorry.
Describing vendor balances
If you entered vendor unpaid bill totals when you set up the vendors — this
is also what I recommend — you’ve described your vendor balances.
If you didn’t enter vendor unpaid bill totals, you need to supply that informa-
tion as I describe in Chapter 6 in the discussion on recording your bills the
accounts payable way. The one really important thing to do is use the origi-
nal vendor bill date when you enter the vendor bill.
Camouflaging some accounting goofiness
After you’ve entered the customer and vendor balances into QuickBooks, you
need to enter the rest of the trial balance, which you do by taking two big
steps. In the first step, you camouflage a couple of goofy accounts, called sus-
pense accounts, that QuickBooks creates when you set up the Item, Customer,
and Vendor lists. The second step, which I describe in the following section,
is supplying the last few missing numbers.
70
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 

Figure 3-16 shows a sample trial balance after I enter the inventory, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable balances. (These account balances get set
up indirectly, as I note in the sidebar “For accountants only,” later in this
chapter.) When you set up your Item, Customer, and Vendor lists, you also
create account balances for inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable.
You can produce your own half-complete trial balance from inside QuickBooks
by clicking the Report Center icon and choosing Reports➪Accountants &
Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a docu-
ment window.
If you need to do so, enter the conversion date in the As Of box by clicking
the box and typing the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Figure 3-16,
for example, shows the conversion date 10/31/2007 in the As Of box. You can
set the From box to any value; the From and To range just needs to end with
the conversion date. Make a note of the credit and debit balances shown for
the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses accounts.
If you want, you can print the report by clicking the Print button; then, when
QuickBooks displays the Print Report dialog box, click its Print button. Yes,
you click two Print buttons.

71
Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

After you have the conversion date balances for the Uncategorized Income
and Uncategorized Expenses accounts, you’re ready to make the accrual-
accounting adjustment. To do so, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, either click the Chart of Accounts icon in the
Company area or choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts to display the Chart
of Accounts window, shown in Figure 3-17.
2. Double-click Opening Bal Equity in the Chart of Accounts list to dis-
play that account.
Opening Bal Equity is listed after the liability accounts. QuickBooks dis-
plays the register — just a list of transactions — for the account named
Opening Bal Equity. Figure 3-18, coincidentally, shows this register.
3. Select the next empty row of the register if it isn’t already selected
(although it probably is).
You can select a row by clicking it, or you can use the up- or down-arrow
key to move to the next empty row.
4. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the
date. Use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, you can type either
10312007 or 10/31/2007 to enter October 31, 2007.
Figure 3-17:

5. Type the Uncategorized Income account balance (from the trial bal-
ance report) in the Increase field.
In Figure 3-16, for example, the Uncategorized Income account balance is
$190,000. In this case, click the Increase field, and type 190000 in the
field.
You don’t need to include the dollar sign or the comma; QuickBooks
adds the punctuation for you.
6. Type Uncategorized Income (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the row under the word Payee, and
begin typing Uncategorized Income, the account name. As soon as you
type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure out what you’re
typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you. When this happens, you
can stop typing.
7. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Income adjust-
ment transaction.
8. Again, select the next empty row of the register.
Click the row or use the up- or down-arrow key.
9. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the
date. You use the MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type 10/31/2007, for
example, to enter October 31, 2007.
10. Type the Uncategorized Expenses account balance in the Decrease
field.
In Figure 3-16, for example, the Uncategorized Expenses account balance
is $75,000. In this case, you click the Decrease field and then type 75000.
I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again because you’re just starting out:
You don’t need to include any punctuation, such as a dollar sign or
comma.
11. Type Uncategorized Expenses (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the second line of the register
transaction, and begin typing Uncategorized Expenses, the account
name. As soon as you type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure
out what you’re typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you.
12. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Expenses adjust-
ment transaction.
Figure 3-18 shows the Opening Bal Equity register with the correction
transactions. The correction transactions are numbered with a 3 and a 4.
See them? They’re near the middle of the register.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

You can close the Opening Bal Equity register at this point. You’re finished
with it. One way to close it is to click the Close button (the little X button in
the upper-right corner of the window).
You can check your work thus far — and checking it is a good idea — by pro-
ducing another copy of the trial balance report. What you want to check are
the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses account balances.
They should both be zero — as shown in Figure 3-19.
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪Accountant &
Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a docu-
ment window. If you need to enter the conversion date in the As Of box, click
the box, and type the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
If the Uncategorized Income and the Uncategorized Expenses account bal-
ances don’t show zero, you (with my help, of course) might have botched the
accrual adjustment. To fix the mistake, redisplay the Opening Bal Equity reg-
ister (as noted earlier, you can double-click Opening Bal Equity in the Chart
of Accounts list to display that account), select the adjustment transactions,
and then check the account, amount, and field (Increase or Decrease). If one
of the fields is wrong, select the field, and replace its contents by typing over
them.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists
For accountants only
If you’re reading this sidebar, I assume that
you’re an accountant who’s been asked to help
your client with the last piece of the QuickBooks
conversion. Of course, you understand double-
entry bookkeeping, and presumably you’re
familiar with the general mechanics involved in
converting to new accounting systems. With
those two caveats, you’re ready to start.
First, your client has probably already installed
QuickBooks and then, by running something
called the EasyStep Interview, partially set up a
chart of accounts and loaded three master files:
the Item list, the Customer list, and the Vendor
list. The Item list master file describes the inven-
tory account balances. (QuickBooks uses an
average costing assumption.) The Customer list
master file describes the accounts receivable
balances. The Vendor list master file describes
the accounts payable balances. Because your
client has set up these master files, QuickBooks
has made three journal entries, which I
describe in the following paragraphs. (I’m using
Xs to represent numbers, in case you’re not
familiar with this convention.)
To set up the conversion date inventory balance
(if inventory exists), QuickBooks created the fol-
lowing entry:
Debit
Credit
Inventory Asset
$X,XXX
Opening Bal Equity
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts receiv-
able (A/R) balance (if A/R exists), QuickBooks
created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Receivable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Income
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts payable
(A/P) balance (if A/P exists), QuickBooks cre-
ated the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Payable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Expenses $X,XXX
To complete the picture, you need to do two
little housekeeping chores. If your client plans
to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to
get rid of the credit to the Uncategorized
Income account and the debit to the
Uncategorized Expenses account. (These two
accounts are really just suspense accounts.)
And you need to load the rest of the trial bal-
ance. I describe the steps for accomplishing
these tasks in the section “Supplying the miss-
ing numbers,” toward the end of this chapter.
Supplying the missing numbers
You’re almost done. Really. Your last task is to enter the rest of the trial 
balance amounts into QuickBooks. To perform this task, you need to have
a trial balance prepared as of the conversion date. If you followed my
instructions in Chapter 2, you have one. Follow these steps:

1. Choose either Company➪Make Journal Entries or Accountant➪Make
Journal Entries.
QuickBooks displays the Make General Journal Entries window, as
shown in Figure 3-20.
2. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the
date. As you might know by now, you use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For
example, type 10/31/2007 for October 31, 2007 (or 10312007, if you
don’t want to put in the slashes).
3. Type each trial balance account and balance that isn’t already in the
half-completed trial balance.
Okay. This step sounds confusing. But remember that you’ve already
entered your cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts
payable account balances, and perhaps even a few other account bal-
ances and a portion of the Opening Bal Equity account balance as part
of the EasyStep Interview.
Now you need to enter the rest of the trial balance — specifically, the
year-to-date income and expense account balances, any missing assets
or liabilities, and the remaining portion of the Opening Bal Equity. To
enter each account and balance, use a row of the Make General Journal
Entries window’s list box. Figure 3-21 shows how this window looks after
you enter the rest of the trial balance into the list-box rows.

Chapter 3: Populating the QuickBooks Lists

4. Click the Save & New button to record the general journal entries that
set up the rest of your trial balance.
Checking your work one more time
Double-checking your work is a good idea. Produce another copy of the trial
balance report. Check that the QuickBooks trial balance is the same one that
you wanted to enter.
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪Accountant &
Taxes➪Trial Balance. Be sure to enter the conversion date in the As Of box. If
the QuickBooks trial balance report agrees with what your records show,
you’re finished.
If the QuickBooks trial balance doesn’t agree with what your records show,
you need to fix the problem. Fixing it is a bit awkward but not complicated.
Choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Journal. QuickBooks displays a report
or journal that lists all the transactions that you or QuickBooks entered as
part of setting up. (The Dates, From, and To text boxes need to specify the
conversion date.) Scroll through the list of transactions until you get to the
last one. The last transaction is the one that you entered to set up the rest of
the trial balance; it names recognizable accounts, and uses familiar debit and
credit amounts. Double-click this transaction. QuickBooks redisplays the
Make General Journal Entries window with the botched transaction. Find the
mistake and then fix the erroneous account or amount by clicking it and
typing the correct account or amount.
Congratulations! You’re done.

In this part . . .
O
kay. You’ve got QuickBooks set up, or maybe you
were lucky enough to have someone else do all the
dirty work. All that doesn’t matter now, though, because
this part is where the rubber really hits the road. You
need to start using QuickBooks to do a bunch of stuff on a
regular, and maybe daily, basis. Invoice customers. Record
customer payments. Pay bills. This part describes how
you do all these things.

I
n this chapter — you might be surprised to discover — I describe how to
create and print invoices in QuickBooks as well as how to create and print
credit memos.
You use the QuickBooks invoice form to bill customers for the goods that you
sell. You use its credit memos form to handle returns and canceled orders for
which you’ve received payments.
Making Sure That You’re Ready 
to Invoice Customers
I know that you’re probably all set to go. But first, you need to check a few
things, okay? Good.
You already should have installed QuickBooks, of course. (I briefly describe
how in Appendix A.) You should have set up a company and a Chart of
Accounts in the EasyStep Interview, as I describe in Chapter 2. You also
should have entered all your lists and your starting trial balance or talked
your accountant into entering it for you, as I describe in Chapter 3.

As long as you’ve done all this prerequisite stuff, you’re ready to start. If you
don’t have one of the prerequisites done, you need to complete it before
going any further.
Sorry. I don’t make the rules. I just tell you what they are.
Preparing an Invoice
After you complete all the preliminary work, preparing an invoice with
QuickBooks is a snap. If clicking buttons and filling in text boxes are becom-
ing old hat to you, skip the following play-by-play commentary and simply
display the Create Invoices window — by either choosing Customers➪Create
Invoices or clicking the Invoices icon on the Home page — and then fill in this
window and click the Print button. If you want more help than a single sen-
tence provides, keep reading for step-by-step instructions.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and
involved invoice around: a product invoice. Some fields on the product
invoice don’t appear on the service or professional invoice, but don’t worry if
your business is a service or professional one. Creating a service or profes-
sional invoice works basically the same way as creating a product invoice —
you just fill in fewer fields. And keep in mind that you start with Steps 1 and 2
no matter what type of invoice you create. Without further ado, here’s how to
create an invoice:
1. Display the Create Invoices window by choosing Customers➪Create
Invoices.
The Create Invoices window appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
2. Select the template or invoice form that you want to use from the
Template drop-down list located in the upper-right corner.
QuickBooks comes with four predefined invoice form types: Product,
Professional, Service, and Progress. Which one appears by default
depends on which one you told QuickBooks that you wanted to use in
the EasyStep Interview. You can download additional templates by
choosing Download Templates from the drop-down list. Or you can
create your own custom invoice template (or modify an existing one) by
clicking the Customize button. I describe customizing invoice forms in
the “Customizing Your Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in this
chapter.
3. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job by using the
Customer:Job drop-down list.
Scroll through the Customer:Job drop-down list until you see the cus-
tomer or job name that you need; then click it.
82
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

4. (Optional) Assign a class to the invoice.
If you use classes to track expenses and income, activate the Class drop-
down list, and select an appropriate class for the invoice. To turn this
handy way of categorizing transactions on or off (which is overkill for
some businesses), choose Edit➪Preferences, click Accounting on the
left, click the Company Preferences tab, and then select or clear the Use
Class Tracking check box. (Figure 4-1 doesn’t show the Class box.)
5. Give the invoice date.
Press Tab several times to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then
enter the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the fol-
lowing secret codes to change the date:
• Press + (the plus symbol) to move the date ahead one day.
• Press – (the minus symbol) to move the date back one day.
• Press T to change the date to today’s date (as specified by the
system time that your computer’s internal clock provides).
• Press M to change the date to the first day of the month (because
M is the first letter in the word month).
• Press H to change the date to the last day of the month (because H
is the last letter in the word month).
Figure 4-1:
The Create
Invoices
window.
83
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

• Press Y to change the date to the first day of the year (because, as
you no doubt can guess, Y is the first letter in the word year).
• Press R to change the date to the last day of the year (because R is
the last letter in the word year).
You can also click the button on the right side of the Date field to display
a small calendar. To select a date from the calendar, just click the date
you want. Click the arrows on the top-left and top-right sides of the cal-
endar to display the previous or next month.
6. (Optional) Enter an invoice number in the Invoice # text box.
QuickBooks suggests an invoice number by adding 1 to the last invoice
number that you used. You can accept this addition, or if you need to
have it your way, you can tab to the Invoice # text box and change the
number to whatever you want.
7. Fix the Bill To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can
change the address for the invoice by replacing some portion of the
usual billing address. You can, for example, insert another line that says
Attention: William Bobbins, if that’s the name of the person to whom the
invoice should go.
8. Fix the Ship To address, if necessary.
I feel like a broken record, but here’s the deal: QuickBooks also grabs the
shipping address from the Customer list. So if the shipping address has
something unusual about it for just this one invoice, you can change the
address by replacing or adding information to the Ship To address
block. Note that QuickBooks will keep track of each of the shipping
addresses you use for a customer, so if you’ve used a shipping address
before, you may be able to select it from the Ship To drop-down list box.
9. (Optional . . . sort of) Provide the purchase order number in the P.O.
Number text box.
If the customer issues purchase orders (POs), enter the number of the
purchase order that authorizes this purchase. (Just for the record, PO is
pronounced pee-oh, not poh or poo.)
10. Specify the payment terms by selecting an option from the Terms
drop-down list.
I have only one request: Don’t offer a customer an early payment dis-
count without reading the first couple sections in Chapter 21. Please. I’m
only looking out for your welfare. Really.
11. (Optional) Name the sales representative.
Rep doesn’t stand for Reputation, so don’t put three-letter editorial com-
ments in here (although I can’t, for the life of me, imagine what you could
do with three letters). If you want to track sales by sales representative, 
84
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

use the Rep drop-down list. Simply activate the list by clicking its arrow
and then pick a name. Sales representatives can include employees, but
they can also include other people that you’ve entered in your other
lists. To quickly add a sales rep, select Add New and then use the handy-
dandy dialog boxes that QuickBooks displays. To work with the Sales
Rep list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Sales Rep List.
12. Specify the shipping date, if it’s something other than the invoice date.
To specify the date, simply move the cursor to the Ship text box and
then type the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can move the cursor by
pressing Tab or by clicking the text box.
Oh — one other quick point: Remember all those secret codes that I talk
about in Step 5 for changing the invoice date? They also work for chang-
ing the shipping date.
13. Specify the shipping method.
You can probably guess how you specify the shipping method, but paral-
lel structure and a compulsive personality force me to continue. So to
specify the shipping method, move the cursor to the Via drop-down list,
activate the list, and then select a shipping method.
By the way, you can add new shipping methods to the list by choosing
Add New and then filling out the cute little dialog box that QuickBooks
displays. Setting up new shipping methods is really easy. Really easy.
14. Specify the FOB point by using the F.O.B. text box.
FOB stands for free-on-board. The FOB point is more important than it
first seems — at least in a business sense — because the FOB point
determines when the transfer of ownership occurs, who pays freight,
and who bears the risks of damage to the goods during shipping.
If a shipment is free-on-board at the shipping point, the ownership of the
goods being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the goods leave
the seller’s shipping dock. (Remember that you’re the seller.) In this
case, the purchaser pays the freight and bears the risk of shipping
damage. You can specify the FOB shipping point either as FOB Shipping
Point or by using the name of the city. If the shipping point is Seattle, for
example, FOB Seattle is the same thing as FOB Shipping Point. Most
goods are shipped as FOB Shipping Point, by the way.
If a shipment is free-on-board at the destination point, the ownership of
the goods that are being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the
goods arrive on the purchaser’s shipping dock. The seller pays the
freight and bears the risk of shipping damage. You can specify the FOB
destination point either as FOB Destination Point or by using the name
of the city. If the destination point is Omaha, for example, FOB Omaha is
the same thing as FOB Destination Point.
85
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

15. Enter each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Quantity/Item Code/Description/
Price Each/Amount/Tax list box. Okay, I know that isn’t a very good
name for it, but you know what I mean, right? You need to start filling in
the line items that go on the invoice. After you move the cursor to a row
in the list box, QuickBooks turns the Item Code field into a drop-down
list. Activate the Item Code drop-down list box of the first empty row in
the list box and then select the item.
When you select the item, QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price
Each text boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you’ve
entered in the Item list. (You can edit the information for this particular
invoice if you need to.) Enter the number of items sold in the Quantity
text box. (After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the
amount by multiplying Quantity by Price Each.) If you need other items
on the invoice, use the remaining empty rows of the list box to enter
each one. If you marked the Taxable check box when you added the item
to the Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that
the item will be taxed. If the item is nontaxable (or you feel like being a
tax evader for no good reason), click the Tax column and select Non.
You can put as many items on an invoice as you want. If you don’t have
enough room on a single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as nec-
essary to the invoice. Information about the invoice total, of course,
goes only on the last page.
Click the Time/Costs button at the top of the form to display the Choose
Billable Time and Costs dialog box. Use this dialog box to select costs
that you’ve assigned to the customer or job. Use the Items tab to select
items purchased for the job. Use the Expenses tab to select reim-
bursable expenses and enter markup information. Use the Time tab to
select billable time recorded by the Timer program, the Weekly
Timesheet, or in the Time/Enter Single Activity window.
16. Enter any special items that the invoice should include.
If you haven’t worked much with the QuickBooks item file, you have no
idea what I’m talking about. (For more information about adding to and
working with lists in QuickBooks, cruise through Chapter 3.)
To describe any of the special items, activate the Item Code drop-down
list of the next empty row and then select the special item. After
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price Each text boxes, edit this
information (if necessary). Describe each of the other special items —
subtotals, discounts, freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the
invoice by filling in the empty rows in the list box.
If you want to include a Discount item and have it apply to multiple
items, you need to stick a Subtotal item on the invoice after the inven-
tory or other items that you want to discount. Then stick a Discount
item directly after the Subtotal item. QuickBooks calculates the discount
as a percentage of the subtotal.
86
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

17. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Click in the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and
select a clever customer message. To add customer messages to the
Customer Message list, choose Add New and then fill in the dialog box
that QuickBooks displays. (I know that I talk about the Customer
Message box in Chapter 3, but I wanted to quickly describe how to add a
customer message again so that you don’t have to flip back through a
bunch of pages.)
18. Specify the sales tax.
If you specified a tax rate in the Customer list, QuickBooks uses it as a
default. If it isn’t correct, move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate
the drop-down list, and select the correct sales tax.
19. (Truly optional) Add a memo.
You can add a memo description to the invoice if you want to. This
memo doesn’t print on invoices — only on the Customer Statement.
Memo descriptions give you a way of storing information related to an
invoice with that invoice. Figure 4-2 shows a completed Create Invoices
window.
Figure 4-2:
A

Create
Invoices

87
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

20. If you want to delay printing this invoice, clear the To Be Printed
check box that’s below the column of buttons in the lower-left area of
the Create Invoices window.
I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check
box does until I finish the discussion of invoice creation. I talk about
printing invoices a little later in the chapter. I promise.
21. Save the invoice by clicking the Save & New button or the Save &
Close button.
QuickBooks saves the invoice that’s on-screen. If you click Save & New,
QuickBooks displays an empty Create Invoices window so that you can
create another invoice.
You can page back and forth through invoices that you created earlier
by clicking the Next and Previous buttons.
When you’re done creating invoices, you can click the invoice form’s
Save & Close button. Or click the Close button, also known as the Close
box, which is the little red box marked with an X in the upper-right
corner of the window.
Fixing Invoice Mistakes
I’m not a perfect person. You’re not a perfect person. Heck, nobody is; every-
one makes mistakes. You don’t need to get worked up over mistakes that you
make while entering information in invoices, though, because in the following
sections, I show you how to fix the most common mistakes that you might
make on your invoices.
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen, you can just move the cursor to the
box or button that’s wrong and then fix the mistake. Because most of the bits
of information that you enter in the Create Invoices window are short and
sweet, you can easily replace the contents of some fields by typing over
whatever’s already there. To start all over again, just click the Clear button.
To save the invoice after you’ve made your changes, click Save & New.
If you need to insert a line in the middle of the invoice, right-click to display a
contextual menu, and choose Insert Line or Delete Line.
88
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen
If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen, but you haven’t yet printed it, you
can use the Next and Previous buttons to page through the invoices. When
you get to the one with the error, simply fix the error as I describe in the pre-
ceding section. If you make an error fixing the invoice, you can click the
Revert button to go back to the saved invoice. The Revert button replaces
the Clear button when you’re viewing an existing invoice — that is, an invoice
that you’ve already saved.
If you’ve printed the invoice, you also can make the sort of change that I
describe in the preceding paragraphs. For example, you can page through the
invoices until you find the one (now printed) that has the error. And you can
change the error and print the invoice again. I’m not so sure that you want to
go this route, however, if you’ve already sent out the invoice. You might want
to consider fixing the invoice by issuing either a credit memo (if the original
invoice overcharged) or another invoice (if the original invoice under-
charged). The reason why I suggest issuing a credit memo (which I show you
how to do in the appropriately titled section, “Preparing a Credit Memo,”
later in this chapter) or another invoice is that life gets awfully messy if you
and your customer have multiple copies of the same invoice floating around
and causing confusion.
Deleting an invoice
I hesitate to mention this, but you also can delete invoices. Procedurally,
deleting an invoice is easy. You just display the invoice in the Create Invoices
window and choose Edit➪Delete Invoice. When QuickBooks asks you to con-
firm your deletion, click Yes. But read the following paragraph first. You may
not want to delete the invoice. . . .
Even though deleting invoices is easy, it isn’t something that you should do
casually or for fun. Deleting an invoice is okay if you’ve just created it; only
you have seen it, and you haven’t yet printed it. In this case, no one needs to
know that you’ve made a mistake. It’s your private secret. But the rest of the
time — even if you’ve created an invoice that you don’t want later — you
should keep a copy of the invoice in the QuickBooks system. By doing so, you
have a record that the invoice existed, which usually makes it easier to
answer questions later.
“But how do I correct my books if I leave the bogus invoice?” you ask.
Good question. To correct your financial records for the invoice that you
don’t want to count anymore, simply void the invoice. The invoice remains in
the QuickBooks system, but QuickBooks doesn’t count it because it loses its
89
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

quantity and amount information. Good news — voiding an invoice is as
simple as deleting one. Just display the invoice in the Create Invoices window
and then choose Edit➪Void Invoice.
Preparing a Credit Memo
Credit memos can be a handy way to fix data-entry mistakes that you didn’t
find or correct earlier. Credit memos are also handy ways to handle things
like customer returns and refunds. If you’ve prepared an invoice or two in
your time, you’ll find that preparing a QuickBooks credit memo is a lot easier
than using old-fashioned methods.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and
involved kind of credit memo: a product credit memo. Creating a service or
professional credit memo works basically the same way, however. You just fill
in fewer fields.
1. Choose Customers➪Create Credit Memos/Refunds or click the Refunds
& Credits icon in the Customer section of the Home page to display the
Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (shown in Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3:
The Create
Credit
Memos/
Refunds
window.
90
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job in the Customer:Job
drop-down list.
You can select the customer or job from the list by clicking it.
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the credit memo.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class
drop-down list and select the appropriate class for the credit memo.
4. Date the credit memo (going steady is optional).
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then enter the correct
date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the secret date-editing
codes that I describe in the section “Preparing an Invoice,” earlier in the
chapter. Oh, boy.
5. (Optional) Enter a credit memo number.
QuickBooks suggests a credit memo number by adding 1 to the last
credit memo number you used. You can accept the number or tab to the
Credit No. text box to change the number to whatever you want.
6. Fix the Customer address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can
change the address for the credit memo by replacing some portion of
the usual billing address. Typically, you should use the same address for
the credit memo that you used for the original invoice or invoices.
7. (Optional . . . sort of) Provide the purchase order (PO) number.
If the credit memo adjusts the total remaining balance on a customer
purchase order, you should probably enter the number of the purchase
order into the P.O. No. text box.
Here’s my logic on this suggestion, for those readers who care: If you
billed your customer $1,000 on P.O. No. 1984, which authorizes a $1,000
purchase, you’ve “used up” the entire purchase order — at least accord-
ing to the customer’s accounts payable clerk, who processes your
invoices. If you make sure that a credit memo for $1,000 is identified as
being related to P.O. No. 1984, however, you essentially free up the
$1,000 purchase balance, which might mean that you can use, or bill on,
the purchase order again.
8. If the customer is returning items, describe each item.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/
Amount/Tax text box. In the first empty row of the box, activate the Item
drop-down list and then select the item. After you select it, QuickBooks
fills in the Description and Rate text boxes with whatever sales descrip-
tion and sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can edit this infor-
mation if you want, but it isn’t necessary.) Enter the number of items
that the customer is returning (or not paying for) in the Qty text box.
91
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

(After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the amount by mul-
tiplying Qty by Rate.) Enter each item that the customer is returning by
filling in the empty rows of the list box.
In the case of inventory items, QuickBooks assumes that the items
you’re showing on a credit memo are returned to inventory. You will
want to adjust your inventory physical counts if unsold items are
returned.
As with invoices, you can put as many items on a credit memo as you
want. If you don’t have enough room on a single page, QuickBooks keeps
adding pages to the credit memo until you’re finished. The total informa-
tion, of course, goes on the last page.
9. Describe any special items that the credit memo should include.
If you want to issue a credit memo for other items that appear on the
original invoice — freight, discounts, other charges, and so on — add
descriptions of each item to the Item list.
To add descriptions of these items, activate the Item drop-down list of
the next empty row and then select the special item. (You activate the
list by clicking the field once to turn it into a drop-down list and then by
clicking the field’s down arrow to access the list box.) After QuickBooks
fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, edit this information (if nec-
essary). Enter each special item — subtotal, discount, freight, and so on —
that you’re itemizing on the credit memo.
If you want to include a Discount item, you need to stick a Subtotal item
on the credit memo after the inventory or other items that you’ve dis-
counted. Then stick a Discount item directly after the Subtotal item. In
this way, QuickBooks calculates the discount as a percentage of the
subtotal.
10. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Activate the Customer Message list, and select a clever customer message.
11. Specify the sales tax.
Move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate the list box, and select the
correct sales tax.
12. (Optional, but a really good idea . . .) Add a memo.
You can use the Memo text box to add a memo description to the credit
memo. I suggest that you use this description to explain your reasons
for issuing the credit memo and to cross-reference the original invoice
or invoices. Note that the Memo field prints on the Customer Statement.
Figure 4-4 shows a completed Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.

13. If you want to delay printing this credit memo, clear the To Be Printed
check box.
I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check
box does until I finish the discussion of credit memo creation. Coverage
of printing invoices and credit memos comes up in a later section.
14. Save the credit memo.
To save a completed credit memo, click either the Save & New or the
Save & Close button. QuickBooks saves the credit memo that’s on-
screen and then, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Create
Credit Memos/Refunds window so that you can create another credit
memo. (Note that you can page back and forth through credit memos
that you created earlier by clicking the Next and the Previous buttons.)
When you’re done creating credit memos, you can click the credit memo
form’s Close button.
See the Use Credit To button at the top of the Create Memos/Refunds
window? If you want, you can click that button to display a menu of com-
mands. The commands let you tell QuickBooks what you want to do with the
newly created credit memo: give a refund or apply to invoice. If you choose
one of these commands, QuickBooks asks for the additional information it
needs. For example, if you indicate that you want to apply the credit memo to
an invoice, it’ll ask, “Hey, dude, which invoice?”
Figure 4-4:

Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

To print a refund check, click the Use Credit To button, and choose Give
Refund. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window and automatically fills
out the check, linking it to the memo.
Fixing Credit Memo Mistakes
Sure, I can repeat the same information that I gave you in the section “Fixing
Invoice Mistakes,” earlier in this chapter, and leave you with a strange feeling
of déjà vu. But I won’t.
Here’s everything you need to know about fixing credit memo mistakes: You
can fix credit memo mistakes the same way that you fix invoice mistakes. If
you need more help, refer to the earlier section “Fixing Invoice Mistakes.”
Printing Invoices and Credit Memos
As part of setting up QuickBooks, you selected an invoice type. I assume that
you have the raw paper stock for whatever invoice type you chose. If you’re
going to print on blank letterhead, for example, I assume that you have letter-
head lying around. If you decide to use preprinted forms, I assume that
you’ve ordered those forms and have received them.
I also assume that you’ve already set up your printer. If you’ve ever printed
anything, your printer is already set up. Really.
Loading the forms into the printer
This part is easy. Simply load the invoice forms into the printer the same way
you always load paper. Because you have one of about a jillion different printers,
I can’t give you the precise steps that you need to take, but if you’ve used a
printer a bit, you should have no problem.
Wait a minute. What’s that? Your printer is brand new, and you’ve never used
it before? Okay, here’s one of my weird ideas: Use a pencil or something else
that’s heat resistant (so that it won’t melt and gum up the insides of the
printer) to draw an arrow on a piece of paper. (Do not, repeat, do not use
crayon. And don’t let your children watch you do this.) Draw the arrow so
that it points toward the top edge of the paper. Load the paper in the printer,
with the arrow face up, and note which direction the arrow is pointing. Print
something. Anything. When the paper comes out, notice whether the image
faces the same direction as the arrow and whether it’s on the same side of
the paper as the arrow. With this information and a little logic, you should be
able to figure out how to load forms correctly.
94
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Setting up the invoice printer
You need to set up the invoice printer only once, but you need to specify a
handful of general invoice-printing rules. These rules also apply to credit
memos and purchase orders, by the way.
To set up your printer for invoice printing, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup, and in the Form Name drop-down list,
select Invoice.
QuickBooks displays the Printer Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 4-5.
2. Select the printer that you want to use to print invoices.
Activate the Printer Name drop-down list to see the installed printers.
Select the one that you want to use for printing invoices and purchase
orders.
3. (Optional) Select the printer type.
The Printer Type drop-down list describes the kind of paper that your
printer uses. You have two choices: Continuous and Page-Oriented.
Continuous means that your paper comes as one connected ream with per-
forated edges. Page-Oriented means that your paper is in single sheets.
4. Select the type of invoice form.
Select the option button that describes the type of form that you want to
print on: Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. Then
check the Do Not Print Lines around Each Field check box if you don’t
like the nice little boxes that QuickBooks creates to separate each field.
Figure 4-5:
The Printer
Setup dialog
box.
95
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

For more on these types of forms, read the sidebar “What am I 
printing on?”
5. (Optional, but a really good idea . . .) Print a test invoice on real
invoice paper.
Click the Align button. When QuickBooks displays the Align Printer
dialog box, choose the type of invoice that you want to print from the
list and then click OK. When QuickBooks displays the Fine Alignment
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-6, click the Print Sample button to tell
QuickBooks to print a dummy invoice on whatever paper you’ve loaded
in the invoice printer.
The dummy invoice that QuickBooks prints gives you a chance to see
what your invoices will look like. The invoice also has a set of alignment
gridlines that prints over the Bill To text box. You can use these gridlines
if you need to fine-align your printer.
6. Fix any form-alignment problems.
If you see any alignment problems after you complete Step 5, you need
to fix them. (Alignment problems usually occur only with impact printers.
With laser printers or inkjet printers, sheets of paper feed into the
printer the same way every time, so you almost never need to fiddle
with the form alignment.)
To fix any big alignment problems — like stuff printing in the wrong
place — you need to adjust how the paper feeds into the printer. When
you finally get the paper loaded as best you can, be sure to note exactly
how you have it loaded. You need to have the printer and paper set up
the same way every time you print.
For minor (but nonetheless annoying) alignment problems, use the Fine
Alignment dialog box’s Vertical and Horizontal boxes to adjust the
form’s alignment. Then print another sample invoice. Go ahead and
experiment a bit. You need to fine-tune the printing of the invoice form
only once. Click OK in the Fine Alignment dialog box when you finish to
have QuickBooks redisplay the Printer Setup dialog box.
Figure 4-6:
The Fine
Alignment
dialog box.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Clicking the Options button in the Printer Setup dialog box (refer to
Figure 4-5) opens the selected printer’s Windows printer setup informa-
tion, where you can do such things as specify quality settings or print
order. Because this information relates to Windows and not to
QuickBooks, I’m not going to explain it. If you’re the curious type or acci-
dentally click it and then have questions about what you see, refer
either to your Windows user’s guide or the printer’s user’s guide.
7. Save your printer settings stuff.
After you finish fiddling with all the Printer Setup dialog box’s boxes and
buttons, click OK to save your changes.
If you always want to use some particular settings to print a particular
form (maybe you always print two copies of an invoice, for example),
see the “Customizing Your Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in
this chapter.
You can print invoices and credit memos one at a time or in a batch. How you
print them makes no difference to QuickBooks or to me, your humble author.
Pick whatever way seems to fit your style the best. The following sections
show you how.
Printing invoices and credit 
memos as you create them
If you want to print invoices and credit memos as you create them, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Print button after you create the invoice or credit memo.
After you fill in the boxes in the Create Invoices window (refer to Figure
4-2) or the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure 4-4),
click the Print button. QuickBooks, ever the faithful servant, displays
either the Print One Invoice dialog box (as shown in Figure 4-7) or the
Print One Credit Memo/Refund dialog box (which looks almost like the
Print One Invoice dialog box).
2. (Optional) Select the type of invoice or credit memo form.
If you’re using a different type of invoice or credit memo form than
you’ve described for the invoice printer setup, select the type of form
that you want to print from the Print On radio button choices. You can
select Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead.
97
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test-invoice or credit-memo
forms or fiddling with form-alignment problems if you addressed these
issues when you set up the invoice printer, so I’m not going to talk about
the Align button here. If you want to do this kind of stuff and you need
help, refer to the preceding section, “Setting up the invoice printer,” in
which I describe how to print test forms and fix form-alignment problems.
3. Print the form.
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints
the form.
4. Review the invoice or credit memo and reprint the form, if necessary.
Review the invoice or credit memo to see whether QuickBooks printed it
correctly. If the form looks wrong, fix whatever caused the problem (per-
haps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the
form by clicking the Print button again.
Printing invoices in a batch
If you want to print invoices in a batch, you need to mark the To Be Printed
check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Invoices
window. This check mark tells QuickBooks to put a copy of the invoice on a
special invoices-to-be-printed list.
Figure 4-7:
The Print
One Invoice
dialog box.
98
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

When you later want to print the invoices-to-be-printed list, follow these
steps:
1. Display the Create Invoices window (choose Customers➪Create
Invoices), click the arrow next to the Print button, and select Print
Batch from the drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the Select Invoices to Print dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-8. This box lists all the invoices that you marked as To Be
Printed that you haven’t yet printed.
2. Select the invoices that you want to print.
Initially, QuickBooks marks all the invoices with a check mark, indicating
that they will be printed. You can select and deselect individual invoices
on the list by clicking them. You also can use the Select All and the
Select None buttons. Click Select All to mark all the invoices. Click Select
None to deselect all the invoices.

Invoices to
Print dialog

Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
What am I printing on?
Sometimes people get confused about the dif-
ference between preprinted forms, letterhead,
and plain paper. Here’s the scoop: Preprinted
forms have your company name, perhaps your
logo, and a bunch of other boxes and lines
(often in another color of ink) already printed on
them. Preprinted forms are often multipart
forms. (Examples of preprinted forms come in
the QuickBooks box.)
Letterhead is what you usually use for letters
that you write. It has your company name and
address on it, for example, but nothing else. To
save you from having to purchase preprinted
forms, QuickBooks enables you to use letter-
head to create invoices and forms. (To make the
letterhead look a little more bookkeeperish,
QuickBooks draws lines and boxes on the let-
terhead so that it looks sort of like a preprinted
invoice.)
Plain paper is, well, plain paper. Nothing is
printed on it. So QuickBooks needs to print
everything — your company name, all the
invoice stuff, and optionally, lines and boxes.
Not that you care, but in my CPA practice, I use
high-quality plain paper to bill my clients and
find that approach works just great.

3. Click OK.
After you correctly mark all the invoices you want to print — and none
of the ones you don’t want to print — click OK. QuickBooks displays the
Print Invoices dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-9.
4. (Optional) Select the type of invoice form.
If you use a different type of invoice form than you described during the
invoice setup, select the type of form that you want to print on by using
the Print On options. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank
Paper, or Letterhead.
For more on these types of forms, read the sidebar, “What am I printing
on?” later in this chapter.
5. Print the forms.
Click the Print button to send the selected invoice forms to the printer.
QuickBooks prints the forms and then displays a message box that asks
whether the forms printed correctly.
6. Review the invoice forms, and reprint them if necessary.
Review the invoices to see whether QuickBooks printed all of them cor-
rectly. If all the forms look okay, click OK in the message box. If one or
more forms doesn’t look okay, enter the invoice number of the first bad
form in the message box. Then fix whatever problem fouled up the form
(perhaps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the
bad form(s) by clicking the Print button again. (The Print button is in
the Print Invoices dialog box.)

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Printing credit memos in a batch
If you want to print credit memos in a batch, you need to check the To Be
Printed check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Credit
Memos/Refunds window. Selecting this box tells QuickBooks to put a copy of
the credit memo on a special credit-memos-to-be-printed list.
Printing credit memos in a batch works similarly to printing invoices in a
batch. Because I describe how to print invoices in a batch in the preceding
section, I speed through the following description of printing credit memos in
a batch. If you get lost or have questions, refer to the preceding section.
When you’re ready to print the credit memos that are on the to-be-printed
list, follow these steps:
1. Display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure
4-4), click the down arrow next to the Print button, and select Print
Batch from the drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the Select Credit Memos to Print dialog box.
2. Select the credit memos that you want to print.
3. Click OK to display the Print Credit Memos dialog box.
4. Use the Print Credit Memos dialog box to describe how you want your
credit memos to be printed.
5. Click the Print button to send the selected credit memos to the
printer.
QuickBooks prints the credit memos.
Sending Invoices and Credit 
Memos via E-Mail
If you have e-mail already set up on your computer, you can e-mail invoices
rather than print them. To e-mail an invoice or credit memo, click the Send
button, which appears at the top of the Create Invoices window. (The button
shows a picture of a little envelope with a green arrow.) QuickBooks displays
the Send Invoice window, as shown in Figure 4-10.
101
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

To send your invoice via e-mail, enter the e-mail address of the business that
you want to bill or refund money to, edit the message as appropriate (make
sure to click that Check Spelling button), and then click the Send Now button.
If you want to wait to send your invoice, click the Send Later button while in
the Send Invoice window, or select the To Be E-Mailed check box in the lower-
left corner of the invoice window; QuickBooks batches your e-mail invoices
together. You can send the entire batch later by clicking the arrow next to the
Send button and choosing the Send Batch command. Note that QuickBooks
also has a mailing service that you can sign up for. To get the dirt on this
option, click the Send button and choose the Mail Invoice command from the
menu that QuickBooks displays.
You can also fax invoices and credit memos from inside QuickBooks if you
have a modem installed. To do this, click the Print button at the top of the
Create Invoices or the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, select your
fax/modem from the Printer Name drop-down list, and then use the wizard
that appears to send the fax via your modem (long-distance charges may
apply).

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Customizing Your Invoices 
and Credit Memos
With QuickBooks, you can easily customize the invoice and credit memo tem-
plates, or create new invoices and credit memos based on one of the existing
QuickBooks templates. All you have to do is open the form that you want to
customize and click the Customize button. When QuickBooks displays the
Basic Customization dialog box (see Figure 4-11), confirm that you’re working
with the correct form template. If you’re not working with the right form tem-
plate, click the Manage Templates button, and select the template you want
to customize from the list that QuickBooks displays. Then use the Logo &
Fonts options and the Company & Transaction Information options to make
your changes.
QuickBooks won’t customize its existing default templates.
To add a logo to the invoice form, check the Use Logo check box, click the
Select Logo button, and then use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to
identify the graphic image file that shows your logo. (This is a neat way to
personalize your invoices.)
Figure 4-11:
The Basic
Customiza-
tion dialog
box.
103
Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos

To fiddle-faddle with the colors used on your invoice or to noodle around
with the fonts used for the invoice text, experiment with the Change Color
Scheme box or the Change Font For box and the Change Font button.
Using the Company & Transaction Information boxes, you can choose what
you want in the header, footer, and fields of your invoice and in what order
you want the information. You can choose which information should print
and which should appear on-screen. You can rename the fields and columns.
Here’s the most important thing you should know about this invoice cus-
tomization stuff: As you make your changes, the Preview area shows what the
customizations look like. So go hog wild. Be adventurous. (If you make a
mess, just click Cancel to abandon your customization changes. Then, if you
want, restart the process — perhaps a bit wiser and smarter for the experience.)
If you’re creating a new invoice template, click the Layout Designer button in
the Basic Customization dialog box to open the Layout Designer window, as
shown in Figure 4-12. In this window, you can become a true layout artist and
observe how the overall look of your invoice changes when you move fields
around the page with your mouse.

Reeling In the Dough
In This Chapter
 Recording and printing sales receipts
 Discovering special tips for retailers
 Fixing sales receipt mistakes
 Recording customer payments
 Correcting mistakes in recording customer payments
 Tracking customer open invoices and collections
 Assessing finance charges
You need to record the amounts that customers pay you when they fork
over cash, at the time of a sale or after you invoice them. In this chapter,
I describe how to record these payments and explain how to make bank
deposits, track the amounts that customers owe and pay, and assess finance
charges.
If you’ve been using QuickBooks to prepare customer invoices, you’re ready
to begin recording payments. You’ll have no problem. If you haven’t been
invoicing customers, you need to make sure that you have a couple of things
ready to go before you can record cash sales.
First, you need to make sure that your lists are up-to-date. (I describe updat-
ing these lists in Chapter 3.) And second, if you want to print sales receipts,
you need to have your printer set up to print them. You do so by choosing
File➪Printer Setup and then selecting Sales Receipt from the Form Name
drop-down list. Setting up your printer to print sales receipts works just like
setting it up to print invoices and credit memos (as I describe in Chapter 4).

Recording a Sales Receipt
You record a sales receipt when a customer pays you in full for the goods at
the point of sale. Sales receipts work similarly to regular sales (for which you
first invoice a customer and then later receive payment on the invoice). In
fact, the big difference between the two types of sales is that sales receipts
are recorded in a way that changes your cash balance rather than your
accounts receivable balance.
In the following steps, I describe how to record sales receipts for products,
which are the most complicated type of cash sale. Recording sales receipts
for services works basically the same way, however. You simply fill in fewer
fields.
1. Choose Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt.
Or, in the Home screen, click the Create Sales Receipts icon. Or, in 
the Customer Center, select the customer from the list and choose 
New Transactions➪Sales Receipts. The Sales Receipt Template appears
with the customer already selected at the top.
The Enter Sales Receipts window appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1:
The Enter
Sales
Receipts
window,
strangely
empty and
perhaps a
bit lonely.
106
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Your Enter Sales Receipts window may not look exactly like mine for a
couple of reasons. The first is that QuickBooks customizes its forms to
fit your particular type of business. The second reason is that forms in
QuickBooks are really easy to customize. You can customize the Sales
Receipt form by clicking the Customize button in the Enter Sales
Receipts window.
Customizing sales receipt forms works in a similar way to customizing
invoices and credit memos, as I describe in Chapter 4. If your Enter Sales
Receipts window includes more fields than I describe here, you can also
turn to that chapter for help on how to fill out the additional fields or
turn them off.
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list by clicking the down arrow to
the right of the box. Scroll through the Customer:Job list until you see
the customer or job name that you want and then click it. Note that
unlike with invoices, the Customer:Job field is not required for cash
sales.
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the sales receipt.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class
drop-down list and select the appropriate class for the sales receipt. 
(I don’t show the Class list box in Figure 5-1, so don’t look for it there.)
4. Date the sales receipt.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then type the correct
date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can change the date by using any of
the date-editing codes. (You can find these codes in Chapter 4 and on
the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book.)
5. (Optional) Enter a sale number.
QuickBooks suggests a cash sale number by adding 1 to the last cash
sale number you used. Use this number, or tab to the Sale No. text box
and change the number to whatever you want.
6. Fix the Sold To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list and uses
the billing address as the Sold To address. You can change the address
for the cash sale, however, by replacing the appropriate part of the usual
billing address.
7. Record the check number.
Enter the customer’s check number in the Check No. text box. If the cus-
tomer is paying you with cold hard cash, you can leave the Check No.
text box empty.
107
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

8. Specify the payment method.
To specify the payment method, activate the Payment Method drop-
down list and select something from it: cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, or
whatever. If you don’t see the payment method that you want to use,
you can add the method to the Payment Method list. Choose Add New
to display the New Payment Method dialog box. Enter a description of
the payment method in the text box and click OK.
9. Describe each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/
Amount/Tax list box. When you do, QuickBooks turns the Item field into
a drop-down list. Activate the Item drop-down list of the first empty row
in the list box and then select the item. When you do, QuickBooks fills in
the Description and Rate text boxes with whatever sales description and
sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can edit this information if
you want, but that probably isn’t necessary.) Enter the number of items
sold in the Qty text box. (QuickBooks then calculates the amount by
multiplying the quantity by the rate.) Describe each of the other items
you’re selling by filling in the next empty rows of the list box.
If you add an inventory item to an invoice, QuickBooks adds a small
button to the Quantity field when the cursor rests on the Quantity field.
If you click the button, QuickBooks displays a window that describes the
on-hand quantities of the inventory item.
If you’ve already read the chapter on invoicing customers (Chapter 4),
what I’m about to tell you will seem very familiar: You can put as many
items on a sales receipt as you want. If you don’t have enough room on a
single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as you need to the receipt.
The sales receipt total, of course, goes on the last page.
10. Describe any special items that the sales receipt should include.
If you didn’t set up the QuickBooks item file, you have no idea what I’m
talking about. But here’s the scoop: QuickBooks thinks that anything
that you stick on a receipt (or an invoice, for that matter) is something
that you’re selling. If you sell blue, yellow, and red thingamajigs, you
obviously need to add each of these items to the Item list. But if you add
freight charges to your receipt, QuickBooks thinks that these charges
are just another thingamajig and requires you to enter another item in
the list. The same is true for a volume discount that you want to stick on
the receipt. And if you add sales tax to your receipt, well, guess what?
QuickBooks thinks that the sales tax is just another item that needs to
be included in the Item list. (For more information about working with
your Item list and adding new items, refer to Chapter 3.)
108
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

To include one of these special items, move the cursor to the next empty
row in the Item box, activate the drop-down list by clicking the arrow on
the right side of the box, and then select the special item. After
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, you might need
to edit this information. Enter each special item — subtotals, discounts,
freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the receipt by filling in the
next empty rows of the list box.
If you checked the Taxable check box when you added the item to the
Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that the
item will be taxed.
If you want to include a discount item (so that all the listed items are 
discounted), you need to stick a subtotal item on the receipt after the
inventory items or other items you want to discount. Then stick the 
discount item directly after the subtotal item. In this way, QuickBooks
calculates the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.
11. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Click the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and select a
clever customer message. To add customer messages to the customer
message list, select Add New. When QuickBooks displays the New
Customer Message box, fill it in and click OK.
12. Specify the sales tax.
If you specified tax information when you created your company file
during the EasyStep Interview — remember how QuickBooks asked
whether you charge sales tax? — QuickBooks fills in the default tax infor-
mation by adding the taxable items (which are indicated by the word
Tax in the Tax column) and multiplying by the percentage you indicated
when you created your company file. If the information is okay, move on
to Step 13. If not, move the cursor to the Tax box that’s to the right of
the Customer Message box, activate the drop-down list, and select the
correct sales tax. For more information about setting a default sales tax
for a customer on the Customer list, refer to Chapter 3.
13. (Truly optional and probably unnecessary for cash sales) Add a memo
in the Memo text box.
You can include a memo description with the cash sale information. This
memo isn’t for your customer. It doesn’t even print on the cash receipt,
should you decide to print one. The memo is for your eyes only. Memo
descriptions give you a way to store information that’s related to a sale
with the sales receipt information.
14. Decide whether you’re going to print the receipt.
If you aren’t going to print the receipt, make sure that the To Be Printed
check box is empty — if not, click it to remove the check.
Figure 5-2 shows a completed Enter Sales Receipts window.
109
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

15. Save the sales receipt.
To save a completed sales receipt, click either the Save & Close or the
Save & New button. QuickBooks saves the sales receipt that’s on-screen
and then, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Enter Sales
Receipts window so that you can create another sales receipt. (Note that
you can page back and forth through receipts that you created earlier by
clicking the Next and Previous buttons.) When you’re done creating
sales receipts, you can click the Enter Sales Receipts window’s Close
button.
Printing a Sales Receipt
To print a single sales receipt as you’re recording the information, click the
Print button in the Enter Sales Receipts window. The Print One Sales Receipt
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-3. The following steps tell you how
to complete this dialog box:

1. Select the type of sales receipt form.
If you’re using a different sales receipt form type than you described for
the invoice/purchase order (PO) printer setup, select the type of form
that you want to print on by selecting a radio button in the Print On sec-
tion. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead.
(See Chapter 4 for more on these printer options.)
You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test receipts or fiddling with
form alignment problems if you addressed these issues during the
invoice/PO printer setup, so I’m not going to talk about the Align button
here. If you want to print a test receipt or need to change the alignment,
refer to Chapter 4 for information on how to proceed.
2. Print that puppy!
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints
the sales receipt.
3. Review the sales receipt and reprint the form, if necessary.
Review the sales receipt to see whether QuickBooks printed it correctly.
If the form doesn’t look okay, fix whatever problem fouled up the print-
ing; perhaps you forgot to include the company name and address, for
example. Then reprint the form by clicking the Print button (in the Enter
Sales Receipts window) again, selecting the form on which you want to
print (again), and then clicking the Print button in the Print One Sales
Receipt dialog box (you got it — again).

To print a batch of receipts, make sure that you select the To Be Printed
check box on each receipt that you want to print and then display the Enter
Sales Receipts window, click the arrow beside the Print button, and choose
Print Batch from the drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Select Receipts
to Print dialog box, which enables you to choose which receipts to print.
Select the desired receipts by putting a check mark in the first column and
then click OK. The Print Sales Receipts dialog box appears. This dialog box
resembles the Print One Sales Receipt dialog box in just about every way, and
the instructions work in exactly the same manner. For help with this dialog
box, refer to the sections on printing invoices and credit memos in batches in
Chapter 4.
Special Tips for Retailers
Are you a retailer? If so, you’re probably saying, “Hey, idiot, what you just
described is way too much work to do every time someone walks into the
store and buys some $3 item.”
You know what? You’re right. So here’s what retailers do to record their sales.
Retailers record the day’s sales by using one, two, or three sales receipt
transactions. Retailers don’t record each individual sales receipt transaction.
Say that some coffee mug retailer has sold 2,500 red coffee mugs for the day
for $3.50 each. In that case, at the end of the day, the retailer would need to
record total sales of $8,750 and then the sales tax. (In my example here, sales
tax is 8.8 percent.) Using these example numbers, the daily sales would be
recorded using a sales receipt transaction like the one shown in Figure 5-2.
Pretty straightforward, right? And that’s not too much work, all things 
considered.
Let me share a handful of other tips for recording retail sales:
 You probably want to record a sales receipt transaction for each
deposit you make. In this manner, you can indicate that a particular
sales receipt transaction (really a batch of sales) is deposited at one
time into your bank account — which makes reconciling your bank
account relatively easy.
 You probably want to separate cash sales from credit card sales
because often credit card sales are handled differently. Your credit
card processing company, for example, might hold on to credit card
sales for a few days, or it might deduct a fee before depositing the
money into your bank account. You want to record a separate sales
receipt transaction for each deposit that you make (or some other com-
pany makes) into the bank account — again, to make reconciling the
bank account easier.
112
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

 If you don’t use the Item list to monitor your inventory (because you
have way too many items to store in the QuickBooks Item list), use
items that are designated as non–inventory parts. For example, you
might use non–inventory part items like daily cash sales, daily AmEx
sales, and daily Visa/MC sales if you make three deposits every day for
cash and check sales, for American Express sales, and for Visa and
MasterCard sales. If you don’t track inventory in your items file, your
CPA handles the inventory and cost of goods sold calculations on your
tax return. He or she probably also records a journal entry transaction
to get your account balances right as of the end of your fiscal year.
 You may want to look at the QuickBooks Point of Sale system. The
QuickBooks Point of Sale system makes it easy to quickly record cash
register sales. In fact, the more expensive version of the QuickBooks
Point of Sale system comes with a scanner, a receipt printer, and a cash
drawer. When you ring up a sale with the QuickBooks Point of Sale
system, the software automatically records your sales and the effect on
inventory and cost of goods sold.
 You also may not want to use inventory items to track your inventory
if you’re a retailer. You may instead want to use non–inventory part
items or generic non–inventory part items. In this way, QuickBooks
won’t track the quantity of items that sell — only the dollar amounts of
your sales.
Correcting Sales Receipt Mistakes
If you make a mistake in entering a sales receipt (cash sale), don’t worry.
Here’s a list of common problems and how to fix them:
 If the sales receipt is still displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt is still
on-screen, you can move the cursor to the box or button that’s wrong
and then fix the mistake. Most of the bits of information that you enter in
the Enter Sales Receipts window are fairly short or are entries that
you’ve selected from a list. You can usually replace the contents of some
field by typing over whatever’s already there or by making a couple of
quick clicks. If you really messed up and want to start over from scratch,
you can click the Clear button. To save a receipt after you’ve entered it
correctly, click either the Save & Close or the Save & New button.
If you need to insert a line in the middle of a sales receipt, right-click
where you want to insert the line and choose Insert Line from the short-
cut menu. To delete a line, right-click it and then choose Delete Line
from the contextual menu.
113
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

 If the sales receipt isn’t displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt isn’t
on-screen, and you haven’t yet printed it, you can use the Next and
Previous buttons to page through the sales receipts. When you get to
the one with the error, fix the error as I describe in the preceding bullet.
If you make a mistake while editing a receipt, you can click the Revert
button to go back to the saved receipt and not save your changes. Note
that Clear toggles to Revert after you edit a transaction.
Even if you’ve printed the customer’s receipt, you can make the sort of
change that I just described. For example, you can page through the
sales receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you find the
receipt (now printed) with the error. And you can correct the error and
print the receipt again. I’m not so sure that you want to go this route,
however. Things will be much cleaner if you void the cash sale by dis-
playing the sales receipt and choosing Edit➪Void Sales Receipt. Then
enter a new, correct cash sales transaction.
 If you don’t want the sales receipt: You usually won’t want to delete
sales receipts, but you can delete them. (You’ll almost always be in
much better shape if you just void the sales receipt.) To delete the
receipt, display it in the Enter Sales Receipts window (choose
Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt and then page through the sales
receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you see the cash
sale that you want to delete) and then choose Edit➪Delete Sales Receipt.
When QuickBooks asks you to confirm the deletion, click Yes.
If you want to see a list of all your cash sales, choose Edit➪Find, and the
Simple Find screen will appear. Select Transaction Type➪Sales Receipt
and then click Find. Select the receipt you want to see from the list that
appears. If you’re already viewing a sales receipt, click Edit➪Find Sales
Receipts. When you click the Find button, another screen pops up and
asks for details of the Sales Receipt that you’re looking for. Click the Find
button on that screen, and QuickBooks gives you a list of your cash
sales for the criteria you selected.
Recording Customer Payments
If your customers don’t always pay you up front for their purchases, you
need to record another type of payment: the payments that customers make
to pay off or pay down what you’ve invoiced them. To record the payments,
of course, you first need to record invoices for the customer. If you issue
credit memos that customers can use to reduce the amounts they owe, you
also first need to record credit memos for the customer. (Check out Chap-
ter 4 to find out how to create and record these items.) The rest is easy.
114
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

To access a wealth of customer information all on one page, click the
Customer Center icon at the top of the screen or choose Customers➪
Customer Center. The Customer Center appears, listing outstanding balances
for all customers and detailed information for the customer selected in the
Customers & Jobs list.
To display the Receive Payments window, click the Receive Payments icon 
on the Home screen or click the Customer Center icon and select the cus-
tomer you need. Click New Transactions and Receive Payments or choose
Customers➪Receive Payments from the top menus. Then describe the cus-
tomer payment and the invoices paid. If you want the gory details, read
through the following steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Receive Payments.
The Receive Payments window appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. (The
window may ask whether your company accepts credit cards; click Yes
or No to close the dialog box.)
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Received From drop-down list, and select the customer
(and job, if necessary) by clicking it. QuickBooks lists the open, or
unpaid, invoices for the customer in the list box at the bottom of the
window.
Figure 5-4:
The Receive
Payments
window.
115
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

3. Specify the payment date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box (the one right above
the Reference # box), and type the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
To edit the date, you can use the secret date-editing codes that I
describe in Chapter 4 and on the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book.
4. Enter the amount of the payment.
Move the cursor to the Amount field, and type the customer payment
amount. Note: If the customer is paying with a credit card, and your mer-
chant bank deducts a fee from the individual payments, record the full
amount of the payment on this payment screen and the merchant fee
later on the Deposit screen. 
5. (Optional) Specify the payment method.
Activate the Pmt. Method drop-down list, and select the payment
method.
6. (Optional) Enter the check number.
You can guess how this works, right? You move the cursor to the
Reference # field. Then you type the check number from the customer’s
check. Do you need to complete this step? Naw. But this bit of informa-
tion might be useful if you or the customer later ends up with questions
about what checks paid for what invoices. So I’d go ahead and enter the
check number.
7. (Optional) Add a memo description.
Use the Memo description for storing some bit of information that will
help you in some way. Note that this field prints on the Customer
Statement.
8. If the customer has any outstanding credits, decide whether to apply
them in this payment.
QuickBooks totals the amounts of any of the customer’s existing credits.
They can be anything from an overpayment on a previous invoice to a
return credit or anything else.
When you create a new invoice, QuickBooks notifies you that there are
credits available on the customer’s account and asks whether you want
to apply any of them to the new invoice.
If you want to apply a credit memo to a specific open invoice, select the
invoice and then click the Discounts & Credits button. When
QuickBooks displays the Credits tab of the Discount and Credits dialog
box, shown in Figure 5-5, click the credit memo that you want to apply
and then click Done.
116
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

9. Identify which open invoices the customer is paying.
By default, QuickBooks automatically applies the payment to the open
invoices, starting with the oldest open invoice. You can change this
application by entering amounts in the Payment column. Simply click
the open invoice’s payment amount, and enter the correct amount.
You can leave a portion of the payment unapplied, if you want to.
QuickBooks will then ask what you want to do with the overpayment:
leave the amount on account to be applied or refund the amount to the
customer or client. By the way, if you record an underpayment,
QuickBooks asks whether you want to just leave the unpaid amount sit-
ting there or want to instead write off the remaining balance.
If you want to apply the customer payment to the oldest open invoices,
click the Auto Apply Payment button. If you want to unapply payments
that you’ve already applied to open invoices, click the Clear Selections
button. Clear Selections and Auto Apply are the same button.
QuickBooks changes the name of the button, depending on whether
you’ve already applied payments.
10. Adjust the early payment or other discounts, if necessary.
If you offer payment terms that include an early payment discount,
QuickBooks automatically reduces the open invoice original amount
(shown in the Orig. Amt. column) by the early payment discount that
you specify to calculate the adjusted amount due (shown in the Amt.
Due column) if the payment is dated within the discount period.
Figure 5-5:
The Credits
tab of the
Discount
and Credits
dialog box.
117
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

To specify any other discounts, select the open invoice that you want to
adjust. Then click the Discount and Credits button. With little or no hesi-
tation, the Discount tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 5-6. Type the dollar amount of the discount in the
Amount of Discount text box. Then specify the expense account that you
want to use to track discounts by activating the Discount Account drop-
down list and selecting one of the accounts. (Interest Expense is proba-
bly a good account to use unless you want to set up a special expense
account called something like Discount Expense or Discounts Given.)
When you’re finished, click Done to return to the Receive Payments
window. (For more information on the costs and benefits of early pay-
ment discounts, see Chapter 21.)
11. Record the customer payment information.
After you identify which invoices the customer is paying — the unapplied
amount should probably show as zero — you’re ready to record the cus-
tomer payment information. You can do so by clicking either the Save &
New or the Save & Close button. QuickBooks saves the customer pay-
ment shown on-screen. If you click Save & New, QuickBooks displays an
empty Receive Payments window so that you can enter another payment.
You can return to customer payments you recorded earlier by clicking
the Previous button.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Correcting Mistakes in Customer
Payments Entries
You can correct mistakes that you make in entering customer payments in
basically the same way that you correct mistakes that you make in entering
cash sales.
First, you display the window you used to enter the transaction. In the case
of customer payments, click the Customer Center icon, and select the cus-
tomer you need. You will see a list of that customer’s transactions on the
right side. Double-click the payment transaction you want to change, and the
original payments screen appears. And then you make your changes. Then
you click Save & Close. Pretty straightforward, right?
If you’ve already recorded a deposit that includes the payment you want to
delete or edit, you need to delete the deposit before you can delete or edit
the payment.
Making Bank Deposits
Whenever you record a cash sale or a customer payment on an invoice,
QuickBooks adds the cash to its list of undeposited funds. These unde-
posited funds could be a bunch of checks that you haven’t yet deposited, or
they could consist of coinage (currency and coins) or even credit card pay-
ments, if you accept those.
You can also tell QuickBooks to give you the choice of indicating that a 
particular payment or sales receipt is deposited directly into a specified
account. To tell QuickBooks to give you this choice, choose the Edit➪
Preferences command, scroll down to the Sales & Customers icon, click the
Company Preferences tab, and deselect the Use Undeposited Funds as a
Default Deposit to Account option. After you make this change, QuickBooks
adds buttons and a box to the lower-left corner of the Enter Sales Receipt and
Receive Payment windows so that you can indicate into which bank account
the money is deposited.
Eventually, though, you’ll want to take the money out from under your mat-
tress and deposit it in the bank. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
Alternatively, select Record Deposits on the Home screen in the Banking
section.
119
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

The Payments to Deposit dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
This dialog box initially lists all the payments, regardless of the payment
method. You can, however, use the View Payment Method Type drop-
down list to indicate that you want to see payments only of a particular
type — such as credit card payments. (This feature can be pretty handy
because it lets you batch all your credit card transactions together.)
2. Select the payments that you want to deposit.
Click a payment or cash receipt to place a check mark in front of it,
marking it for deposit. If you want to deselect a payment, click it again.
To deselect all the payments, click the Select None button. To select all
the payments, click the Select All button. If you have gobs of payments
to look through, you can also filter out the list by clicking View Payment
Method Type at the top and see only the Cash or Credit Cards to select
among. If you are recording credit card payments deposited, you don’t
need to sort through the check payments also. They aren’t gone; they
just don’t appear until you select that type of payment or All.
3. Click OK.
After you indicate which payments you want to deposit, click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Make Deposits window, as shown in Figure 5-8.
If you need to redisplay the Payments to Deposit dialog box — maybe
you made a mistake or something, and now you need to go back and fix
it — click the Payments button at the top of the Make Deposits screen.
Note, though, that QuickBooks won’t display the Payments to Deposit
dialog box unless the undeposited funds list still has undeposited pay-
ments in it.
Figure 5-7:
The
Payments to
Deposit
dialog box.
120
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

4. Tell QuickBooks into which bank account you want to deposit the
money.
Activate the Deposit To drop-down list, and select the bank account in
which you want to place the funds.
5. Specify the deposit date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box, and type the correct
date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Use the secret date-editing codes if you
need to edit the date. (Get these codes from Chapter 4 or the Cheat
Sheet at the front of the book, if you don’t know them.)
6. (Optional) Add a memo description, if you want to.
I don’t know what sort of memo description you would add for a
deposit. Sorry. A bank deposit is a bank deposit. At least to me. 
7. Specify the cash-back amount.
If you want cash back from the deposit, activate the Cash Back Goes To
drop-down list, and select a cash account, such as Petty Cash. Then
enter a memo in the Cash Back Memo text box and the amount of cash
back you’re taking in the Cash Back Amount text box.
8. Record the deposit by clicking the Save & Close or Save & New button.
If you click Save & New, QuickBooks displays a new blank Make Deposits
window.
Figure 5-8:
The Make
Deposits
window.
121
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

If you sometimes take cash from the register or from the day’s collections to
spend on business supplies, for COD (collect on delivery) payments, and
even for salaries, you enter the cash payment transaction as another transac-
tion line in the Make Deposits window shown in Figure 5-8. For example, if
you use $50 from the cash register to pay for office supplies from Acme Office
Store, you enter another line into the Make Deposits window. You enter Acme
Office Store into the Received From column, your office supplies expense
account into the From Account column, and –50 into the Amount column.
You use a negative amount to reduce the total deposit to the correct amount
that is actually deposited into the checking account and to charge the
expense account for the amount paid out. This is also where you record the
Merchant Fees deducted from your credit card deposits mentioned earlier.
Improving Your Cash Inflow
I’m not going to provide a lengthy discussion of how to go about collecting
cash from your customers. I do, however, want to quickly tell you about a
couple of other details. You need to know how to monitor what your cus-
tomers owe you and how to assess finance charges. Don’t worry, though. I
explain these two things as briefly as I can.
Tracking what your customers owe
You can track what a customer owes in a couple of ways. Probably the sim-
plest method is to display the Customer Center by choosing Customer➪
Customer Center. Next, select the customer from the Customers & Jobs list
(which appears along the left edge of the window). QuickBooks whips up a
page that lists transactions for the customer. It also shows the customer’s
contact information. Figure 5-9 shows the Customer Center information for a
customer.
You also should be aware that QuickBooks provides several nifty accounts
receivable, or A/R, reports. You get to these reports by clicking the Report
Center icon and choosing Customers & Receivables. Or you can choose
Reports➪Customers & Receivables. QuickBooks then displays a submenu of
about half a dozen reports that describe how much money customers owe
you. Some reports, for example, organize open invoices into different groups
based on how old the invoices are. (These reports are called agings.) Some
reports summarize only invoices or payments. And some reports show each
customer’s open, or unpaid, balance.
In Chapter 15, I describe, in general terms, how you go about producing and
printing QuickBooks reports. So refer to Chapter 15 if you have questions. Let
me also say that you can’t hurt anything or foul up your financial records just
by printing reports. So go ahead and noodle around.
122
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

You can print a statement to send to a customer by choosing Customers➪
Create Statements. Use the Select Statements to Print dialog box to describe
which customers you want to print statements for and the date ranges you
want the statements to show, and then click Print or E-Mail to print or e-mail
the statements. Statements are a handy way to remind forgetful customers 
or clients about overdue amounts. You don’t, by the way, need to send state-
ments to everybody for every month. In my CPA practice, I send out state-
ments a couple of times a year to clients with past-due accounts. This
friendly reminder always produces a handful of quick payments and awkward
apologies.
Assessing finance charges
I wasn’t exactly sure where to stick this discussion of finance charges.
Because finance charges seem to relate to collecting the cash your customers
owe, I figure that I’m okay talking about assessing finance charges here.
QuickBooks assesses finance charges on unpaid open invoices without con-
sidering any unapplied payments. Accordingly, you’ll want to make sure that
you apply any payments and credit memos to open invoices before assessing
finance charges.
Figure 5-9:
The
Customer
Center.
123
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

To assess finance charges, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences; then click the Finance Charge icon in the
list on the left, and click the Company Preferences tab.
To be able to assess finance charges, you first need to set them up.
Only the QuickBooks administrator can change the company finance
charge settings, and he or she can do so only in single-user mode.
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-10.
(If you’ve assessed finance charges before, QuickBooks displays the
Assess Finance Charges window. You can display the Preferences dialog
box and check or edit your finance charge settings by clicking the
Settings button in the Assess Finance Charges window.)
2. Enter the annual interest rate that you want to use to calculate finance
charges.
Move the cursor to the Annual Interest Rate (%) text box, and enter the
annual interest rate.
124
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Using QuickBooks to write a letter
You can seamlessly integrate your QuickBooks
data to create collection letters in Microsoft
Word. You can also use the QuickBooks busi-
ness letter templates to speed the process of
writing business letters. To have QuickBooks
help you write a letter, choose Company➪
Prepare Letters with Envelopes. Then select the
submenu command for the type of letter you
want to create or edit. Or from the Customer
Center, click the Word icon, and select the let-
ters from the menu there.
If you’re creating a collection letter, you can
specify which customers and jobs you want
QuickBooks to search for money owed to you.
You can tell QuickBooks whether you want to
create a separate letter for each customer who
owes you money or each job on which you’re
owed money. You can also specify the limit for
how overdue an invoice must be to warrant a
collection letter. After you set the parameters
and click Next, QuickBooks searches for over-
due invoices that fit your criteria.
If you’re creating a type of letter other than a
collection letter, QuickBooks offers many
choices based on whether you’re sending the
letter to a customer, a vendor, an employee, or
someone else. For example, you can create
credit approval, credit denial, or credit request
letters. You can create birthday or apology let-
ters. And you can create faxes or bounced
check letters, just to name a few.
After you specify the information about the type
of letter that you want to create, QuickBooks
asks you a few questions about how you want
to sign the letter. Then it creates the letter and
displays it in Microsoft Word so that you can
edit the letter as necessary and then print or
save it.

3. (Optional) Enter the minimum finance charge — if one exists.
Move the cursor to the Minimum Finance Charge text box, and enter the
minimum charge. If you always charge at least $25.00 on a past-due
invoice, for example, type 25.
4. Enter the number of days of grace that you give.
Days of Grace. That sounds kind of like an artsy movie or serious novel,
doesn’t it? Basically, this number is how many days of slack you’re will-
ing to cut people. If you type 30 in the Grace Period (Days) text box,
QuickBooks doesn’t start assessing finance charges until 30 days after
the invoice is past due.
5. Specify which account you want to use to track the finance charges.
Activate the Finance Charge Account drop-down list, and select an
Income or Other Income type account.
6. Indicate whether you want to charge finance charges on finance
charges.
Does this statement make sense? If you charge somebody a finance
charge, and he or she doesn’t pay the finance charge, eventually it
becomes past due, too. So then what do you do the next time you assess
finance charges? Do you calculate a finance charge on the finance charge?
If you want to do this — and if state and local laws let you — select the
Assess Finance Charges on Overdue Finance Charges check box.
7. Tell QuickBooks whether it should calculate finance charges from the
due date or the invoice date.
Select either the Due Date or Invoice/Billed Date option button. As you
might guess, you calculate bigger finance charges if you start accruing
interest on the invoice date.
8. Tell QuickBooks whether it should print finance charge invoices.
Select the check box for Mark Finance Charge Invoices “To Be Printed” if
you want to print invoices later for the finance charges that you calculate.
Figure 5-10:
The
Preferences
dialog box
for finance
charges.
125
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

9. Click OK.
After you use the Preferences dialog box to tell QuickBooks how the
finance charges should be calculated, click OK.
10. Choose Customers➪Assess Finance Charges.
Alternatively, click the Finance Charges icon on the Home screen. The
Assess Finance Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 5-11. This
window shows all the finance charges that QuickBooks has calculated,
organized by customer.
11. Give the finance charge assessment date.
Move the cursor to the Assessment Date text box, and enter the date
when you’re assessing the finance charges, which I’m willing to bet is
the current date. (This date is also the invoice date that will be used on
the finance charge invoices, if you create them.)
12. Confirm which customers you want to be assessed finance charges.
QuickBooks initially marks all the finance charges, which means that it
sets up a new invoice for each finance charge. (QuickBooks marks
finance charges with a little check mark.) If you want to unmark (or,
later, mark) a finance charge, click it. To unmark all the charges, click the
Unmark All button. To mark all the charges, click the Mark All button.

You can produce a collections report for any of the customers or jobs
listed in the Assess Finance Charges window by selecting the customer
name and then clicking the Collection History button.
13. Click the Assess Charges button.
When the Assess Finance Charges window correctly describes the
finance charges that you want to assess, click Assess Charges. You’re fin-
ished with the finance charge calculations and assessments.
I don’t describe how to print invoices that contain finance charges because I
already slogged through invoice printing in painstaking detail in Chapter 4. If
you have questions about how to print the invoices, you may want to visit
that chapter.
Dealing with deposits
While I’m on the subject of improving your cash flow, let me briefly mention
one other powerful cash flow technique — and discuss the bookkeeping
required for that technique.
127
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
A word of advice from an accountant
While I’m on the subject of tracking what your
customers owe you, let me share a thought
about collecting this money. You should have
firm collection procedures that you follow faith-
fully. For example, as soon as an invoice is a
week or so past due, it’s very reasonable to
place a friendly telephone call to the customer’s
accounts payable department, and verify that
the customer has received the invoice and is in
the process of paying. You have no reason to be
embarrassed because some customer is late in
paying you! What’s more, you may find out
something surprising and essential to your col-
lection. You may discover, for example, that the
customer didn’t receive the invoice. Or you may
find out that something was wrong with the
gizmo you sold or the service you provided.
As soon as an invoice is a month or so past due,
you need to crank up the pressure. A firm letter
asking that the customer call you to explain the
past-due amount is very reasonable — espe-
cially if the customer assured you only a few
weeks ago that payment was forthcoming.
When an invoice is a couple of months past due,
you need to get pretty serious. You’ll probably
want to stop selling the customer anything more
because it’s unclear whether you’ll be paid. And
you may want to start a formal collection
process. (Ask your attorney about starting such
a process.)

One easy way to improve your cash flow is to accept or require up-front
deposits or retainers from clients or customers before you do the actual
work. In other words, before you begin work or order inventory or do what-
ever is the first step in your business for completing a sale, you collect cold,
hard cash.
Unfortunately, these customer deposits, as they’re called, create a bit of book-
keeping trouble. The question becomes, basically, how do you record a check
or cash deposit for stuff that you haven’t yet done or sold? You have two
basic options:
 The Easy Way: You can just record a sales receipt for the service or
product (see “Recording a Sales Receipt” at the beginning of this chap-
ter). In this way, you count the cash coming into your business. And you
recognize the revenue. Note, too, that if the deposit is nonrefundable —
and for cash flow purposes, the deposit should be nonrefundable — you
probably should count the revenue when you receive the deposit if
you’re a cash-basis taxpayer. (You probably are a cash-basis taxpayer,
but ask your tax advisor if you aren’t sure.)
 The Precise Way: You can recognize the deposit as a new liability. You do
this by creating a journal entry that records the increase in your cash
account and that records the increase in your Customer Deposits current
liability account. (For help on entering journal entries, refer to Chap-
ter 20.) If the deposit is refundable and you’re a cash-basis taxpayer, or 
if you’re an accrual-basis taxpayer, you probably should use this way.
When your sale is completed and invoiced later, use the Customer
Deposit item as a minus amount on the sales invoice to move the amount
from the liability account and apply it to the invoice balance due.

QuickBooks gives you two ways to pay and record your bills. And you
have many options when it comes to deciding when to pay your bills,
how to pay your bills, and how to record your bills for the purposes of track-
ing inventory and expenses.
In this chapter, I explain not only how to pay vendor bills, but also how to
pay that all-important bill that so many businesses owe to their state and
local governments. I’m talking, of course, about sales tax.
Pay Now or Pay Later?
When it comes to paying bills, you have a fundamental choice to make. You
can either record and pay your bills simultaneously or record your bills as
they come in but then pay them as they’re due. The first method is easiest, as
you might guess, because you do everything at once. The second method,
called the accounts payable method, gives you more accurate financial
records and makes for more precise management of your cash and outstand-
ing bills.
If you have a small business with little overhead, you may just as well record
and pay bills simultaneously. But if you need precise measurement of 
your expenses and bills — if you want to use what’s termed accrual-basis
accounting — you should use the accounts payable method of paying bills. 
I should note, too, that using the accounts payable method with QuickBooks
is not as difficult as it may seem at first.

And now you’re ready to begin. In the next section, I describe how to pay
bills by writing checks. A little later in the chapter, in the “Recording Your
Bills the Accounts Payable Way” section, you find out how to pay bills by
using the accounts payable method.
Recording Your Bills by Writing Checks
When you record bills by writing checks, you’re doing cash-basis accounting.
In a nutshell, this means that you count bills as expenses when you write the
check to pay the bill.
I talk a little bit about cash-basis accounting in Appendix B. But let me say
here that a trade-off is implicit in the choice to use cash-basis accounting. If
you use cash-basis accounting — which is what I do in my little business —
you greatly simplify your bookkeeping, but you lose precision in your mea-
surement of your expenses. And you don’t keep track of your unpaid bills
inside QuickBooks. They just stack up in a pile next to your desk.
As long as you understand this trade-off and are comfortable with it, you’re
ready to begin using this method, which you do by following the steps I pro-
vide in the paragraphs that follow.
The slow way to write checks
You can write checks either from the register or from the Write Checks
window. Using the Write Checks window is the slow way, but it enables you to
record your expenses and the items (if any) that you purchase. Using the
Write Checks window is the best choice in the following situations:
 You’re paying for an inventory item.
 You’re paying for something for which you have a purchase order.
 You plan to be reimbursed for the bill that you’re paying.
 You want to record what job or class the bill falls under.
To use the Write Checks window to write checks, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
Alternatively, click the Write Checks icon in the Banking section of the
Home screen. The Write Checks window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Notice that this window has three parts:
130
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

• The check part on the top, which you no doubt recognize from
having written thousands of checks in the past.
• The buttons on the top and bottom.
• The Expenses and Items tabs near the bottom of the window. This
part is for recording what the check is for, as I explain in Steps 7, 8,
and 9.
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list, and select the account from
which you want to write this check.
This step is very important if you have more than one account. Make
sure that you select the correct account; otherwise, your account bal-
ances in QuickBooks will be incorrect.
3. Specify the check date.
Click the Date box, and type the check date. I don’t keep reminding you
about this, but because I’m still in the early part of this book, remember
that you can enter today’s date by pressing the T key. You can also click
the button to the right of the Date box to get a pop-up calendar. To
select a date from the pop-up calendar, click the calendar day that you
want to use.
Figure 6-1:
The Write
Checks
window.
131
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

4. Fill in the Pay to the Order Of line.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill fea-
ture fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you
after you start typing the name. (AutoFill does so by comparing what you
type with names shown in the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Other
Names lists.) AutoFill also puts the payee’s address in the Address box.
The AutoRecall feature can even fill out the entire check for you, based
on the last check that you wrote to this vendor. (You can enable
AutoRecall by choosing Edit➪Preferences, clicking the General icon, and
selecting the Automatically Recall Last Transaction for This Name check
box on the My Preferences tab.)
Does the check look all right? Maybe all you need to do is tab around,
adjusting numbers. Otherwise, read the next 12 steps. (Another 12-step
program?) In these steps, I explain how to record information about a
new vendor and pay a check to that vendor in one fell swoop.
If you’ve never paid anything to this person before, the program dis-
plays a Name Not Found message box after you enter the name on the
Pay to the Order Of line. You can click either Quick Add or Set Up to add
the payee name to one of your lists. (To find out how to do so, check out
the “To Quick Add or to Set Up?” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter.)
5. Type the amount of the check.
Now comes my favorite part. I’ve always found it a big bother to write
out the amount of checks. I mean, if you write a check for $21,457.00,
how do you fit twenty-one thousand, four hundred fifty-seven dollars,
and no cents on the line? Where do you put those hyphens, anyway?
All you have to do with QuickBooks is enter the amount next to the
dollar sign and press Tab. When you press Tab, QuickBooks writes out
the amount for you on the Dollars line. At moments like this, I’m grateful
to be alive in the 21st century, when computer technology can do these
marvelous things for me.
6. (Optional) Fill in the Address text box.
You need to fill in this box only if the address isn’t there already, and you
intend to send the check by mail in a window envelope.
7. (Optional) Fill in the Memo line.
You can put a message to the payee on the Memo line — a message such
as “Quit bleeding me dry.” But you usually put an account number on
the Memo line so that the payee can record your account number.
If you try to click the Save & New button and close the dialog box now,
QuickBooks tells you that you can’t and tries to bite your leg off. Why?
Because you can’t write a check unless you fill out the Expenses and
Items tabs. You use these tabs to describe what the check pays.
132
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

8. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab, and
enter an expense account name.
Chances are that you want to enter the name of an account that’s
already on the Chart of Accounts. If that’s the case, move the cursor to a
field in the Account column; QuickBooks turns the field into a drop-
down list. Click the down arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You’ll
probably have to scroll down the list to get to the expense accounts.
Click the one that this check applies to (most likely, it’s Supplies or
Rent). If you need to create a new expense account category for this
check, choose Add New from the top of the list to see the New Account
dialog box. Fill in the information and click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying out with this check can be distrib-
uted across two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the
account that you just entered. The down arrow shoots down next to the
cursor. Click the down arrow, and enter another expense account, and
another, and another, if you want to.
9. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the num-
bers around.
If you’re distributing this check across more than one account, make
sure that the numbers in the Amount column correctly distribute the
check to the appropriate accounts. Figure 6-2 shows a completed check.
Figure 6-2:
A

check.
133
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

10. If you want to, enter words of explanation or encouragement in the
Memo column.
Someday, you may have to go back to this check and try to figure out what
these expenses mean. The Memo column may be your only clue. Enter
some wise words here: “August rent,” “copier repair,” or “company party.”
11. (Optional) Assign the expense to the Customer:Job column.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to
track your expenses by job, enter the name of the customer who is going
to reimburse you. Click the down arrow to find the customer. Enter an
amount for each customer or job, if necessary.
12. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class
column. Notice the usual down arrow, which you click to see a list of
classes. You won’t see the Class column, however, unless you told
QuickBooks that you wanted to use classes when you created your com-
pany. (You create the company when you work your way through the
EasyStep Interview; see Chapter 2.)
If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you have to set
it up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then
check the Use Class Tracking check box.
13. Use the Items tab to record what you’re purchasing.
134
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
To Quick Add or to Set Up?
If you click Quick Add in the Name Not Found
message box, you see a Select Name Type mes-
sage box asking whether the payee is a Vendor,
Customer, Employee, or Other. Most likely, the
payee is a vendor, in which case you click
Vendor (but you can, of course, click one of the
other three options). The address information
that you write on the check goes in the Vendor
list — or Customer, Employee, or Other Names
list, depending on what you clicked. (Refer to
Chapter 3 if you’re in the dark about adding to
your lists.)
Selecting the Set Up option in the Name Not
Found message box is a little more interesting.
When you select this option, you also see the
Select Name Type box. Click Vendor, Customer,
Employee, or Other. Click OK, and then you see
the New whatever window that you may
remember from Chapter 3, if you’ve already
added new vendors, customers, or employees
to your lists.
By the way, my long-suffering technical editor,
Joey, wants me to point out that using the Quick
Add method is sort of lazy. With Quick Add,
QuickBooks requires you to collect only a mini-
mal amount of information.

You may be purchasing inventory items, or you may already have filled
out a purchase order for the items for which you’re paying. If either of
these cases is so, click the Items tab. If you don’t have a purchase order
for the items, go on to Step 14. If you do have a purchase order for the
items, click the Select PO button to see a list of purchases on order with
this vendor. Check those for which you’re paying, and click OK.
QuickBooks doesn’t show its purchase order (PO) feature unless you told
it during the EasyStep Interview that you want to use purchase orders. If
you now think you want to use them, choose Edit➪Preferences. When
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Purchases &
Vendors button, click the Company Preferences tab, and then check the
Inventory and Purchase Orders Are Active check box.
14. Move the cursor to the Item column, and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click the arrow to see the Items
list. Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click
it. If not, choose Add New from the top of the list, and fill out the New
Item window (refer to Chapter 3).
15. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items that you’re purchasing on this tab. Make sure
that the Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing,
their cost, and the quantity.
When you finish adding items, you may want to use one of the following
options that appear in the Write Checks window:
• Click the Print button to print the check in the Write Checks
window. This option doesn’t print all the checks that you have
written and marked to be printed, however. (I explain how to print
more than one check at a time in Chapter 10.)
• The Clear Splits button deletes any individual amounts that you’ve
entered for separate expenses or items on the Expenses and Items
tabs. Then QuickBooks enters the total amount of the check in the
Amount column on the Expenses tab.
• The Recalculate button totals the items and expenses in the
window. It also puts the total on both the numeric and text amount
lines of the check.
• The To Be Printed check box designates the check for printing.
Mark this check box if you want to print the check with
QuickBooks by using your printer and preprinted check forms.
Clear this check box if you’re recording a handwritten check.
16. Click Save & New or Save & Close to finish writing the check.
Click Save & Close to tell QuickBooks that you want to save the check
and close the check form. Click Save & New to tell QuickBooks that you
want to save the check and then display another blank check form. If
you don’t want to save the check, close the dialog box and then click No
when QuickBooks asks whether you want to save the check.
135
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

You can also use the Next and Previous buttons to move to previously
written checks or to a blank check form. If you write check number 101,
for example, clicking Next takes you to check 102 so that you can write
that one. (Clicking Previous moves you to check 100, in case you need to
edit a check that you’ve written earlier.)
Well, that’s over with. For a minute there, I thought that it would never end.
The fast way to write checks
If you want to pay a bill that isn’t for inventory, that you won’t be reimbursed
for, or that you don’t need to track in any way, shape, or form, you can write
your check directly from the Checking register. This method is the fast and
easy way to go. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Use Register.
Alternatively, click the Check Register icon in the Banking section on 
the Home page. The Checking register appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.
(If you have more than one bank account, you have to select the proper
account from the drop-down list and click OK.) The cursor is at the end
of the register, ready and waiting for you to enter check information.
Figure 6-3:
The
Checking
register.
136
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

2. Fill in the information for the check.
Notice that the entries you make are the same ones that you would make
on a check. You need to note three things about the register:
• If you enter a Payee name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you
see the Name Not Found message box, and you’re asked to give
information about this new, mysterious vendor. To see what to do
next, go back to the preceding set of instructions on writing a
check the slow way.
• You have to choose an account name. Chances are, you can find
the right one in the Account drop-down list, but if you can’t, enter
one of your own. QuickBooks displays the Account Not Found mes-
sage box and asks you to fill in the information about this new
account.
• To record a check that pays more than a single expense, click the
Splits button (shown in the bottom-left corner of the window) to
display a little box that you can use to input multiple expense
accounts and amounts.
As you fill out the register, if you decide that you want to be reimbursed
for this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the
Edit Transaction button. You see the Write Checks window that you
know from Figure 6-1. Follow Steps 3–14 in the preceding section on how
to write a check the slow way to fill in the Write Checks window. When
you finish filling in the Write Checks window, click Save & New. You’re
back where you started, in the register window.
3. When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record
button.
You click Record, of course, to record the check.
By the way, if you realize that you’ve made a mistake and haven’t yet
clicked Record to record the check, you can click the Restore button to
go back to square one. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just entered
so that you can start over again.
If you want to print the check (or checks) that you’ve just entered, flip to
Chapter 10 for details. In the meantime, in Chapter 8, I give you the lowdown
on keeping your checkbook — so turn there if this discussion of checks has
you really excited.
137
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

Recording Your Bills the 
Accounts Payable Way
The accounts payable (A/P) way of paying bills involves two steps. The first
is a trifle on the difficult side, and the second step is as easy as pie. First, you
record your bills. If you’ve read the section earlier in this chapter on writing
checks the slow way, you’re already familiar with using the Expenses tab and
the Items tab to record bills. You need to fill out those tabs for the A/P
method as well if you want to distribute a bill to accounts, customers, jobs,
classes, and items. If you’ve read the first half of this chapter, some of what
follows will be old hat.
After you record your bills, you can go on to the second step: telling
QuickBooks which bills to pay. Then QuickBooks writes the checks. You print
them. You mail them.
To make the A/P method work, you have to record your bills as they come in.
That doesn’t mean that you have to pay them right away. By recording your
bills, you can keep track of how much money you owe and how much money
your business really has. QuickBooks reminds you when your bills are due so
that you don’t have to worry about forgetting to pay a bill.
When you record bills the accounts payable way, you’re using accrual-basis
accounting. I explain accrual-basis accounting in Appendix B.
Recording your bills
When a bill comes in, the first thing to do is record it. You can record bills
through the Enter Bills window or the Accounts Payable register. If you plan
to track bills by expense and item, you need to use the Enter Bills window. I
describe that method first. If you have a simple bill to pay that doesn’t need
to be reimbursed or tracked, skip ahead to the “Paying Your Bills” section,
later in this chapter.
To record a bill through the Enter Bills window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bills.
Alternatively, click the Enter Bills icon in the Vendors area on the Home
page. Figure 6-4 shows the Enter Bills window. You no doubt notice that
the top half of this window looks a great deal like a check — that’s
because much of the information that you put here ends up on the
check that you write to pay your bill. (If you see the word Credit at the
top of the form rather than Bill, select the Bill radio button in the top-left
corner. You also can use this screen to enter credit from vendors.)
138
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

2. Select the name of the vendor whom you’re paying.
If you want to pay this bill to a vendor who’s already on the Vendor list,
click the down arrow at the end of the Vendor line, and select the
vendor. (Then QuickBooks automatically fills the Enter Bills window
with as much information as it can remember.) If this vendor is new,
QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set Up some information about
the vendor: the address, credit limit, payment terms, and so on. You pro-
vide this information in the New Vendor window. If you aren’t familiar
with this window, make a brief visit to Chapter 3.
If you have one or more unfilled purchase orders with the vendor that
you select, QuickBooks asks you whether you want to receive against a
purchase order. Click Yes if you do or No if you don’t. If you choose to
receive against a purchase order, QuickBooks displays the Open
Purchase Orders dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-5. It lists the open pur-
chase orders you’ve recorded. When you select one or more purchase
orders to receive against, QuickBooks fills in the items and amounts
from these orders for you, which you can modify as necessary. When
you finish with the Purchase Orders dialog box, click OK to get back to
the Enter Bills window.
Figure 6-4:
The Enter
Bills
window.
139
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

Hey, you know what? I don’t talk about purchase orders until Chapter 7.
But here’s the CliffsNotes version: To create a purchase order, which is a
record of items you order from vendors, choose Vendors➪Create
Purchase Orders. When QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase
Orders window, describe your order. You print and edit purchase orders,
by the way, in the same manner as you print invoices and credit memos.
3. Select the payment terms that describe when the bill is due.
In the Terms line, open the drop-down list, and select the payment terms
(if the information isn’t already there from when you set up the vendor).
4. (Optional) Enter the vendor’s reference number.
If you enter the vendor’s reference number for the bill — this is probably
just the invoice number or your account number — the reference
number prints on the voucher that’s part of the printed check.
5. (Optional) Enter a memo to describe the bill.
You can enter a note in the Memo box. The note that you enter appears
on the A/P register.
6. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab, and
enter an expense account name.
Figure 6-5:
Paying a bill

purchase
order.
140
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Chances are that you want to enter the name of an expense account
that’s already on the chart of accounts. If that’s the case, click the down
arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You probably have to scroll
down the list to get to the expense accounts. (A fast way to move down
the list is to start typing the account name; you go straight down the
list.) Click the account that this bill represents. (Most likely, it’s Supplies
or something like that.)
If you need to create a new expense account category for this bill,
choose Add New from the top of the list. You see the New Account
dialog box. Fill in the information, and click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying out because of this bill can be split
among two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the
account that you just entered. The down arrow appears. Click it to enter
another expense account, and another, and another, if you want to.
7. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the numbers.
If you’re splitting this bill among several accounts, make sure that the
numbers in the Amount column add up to the total of the bill.
8. (Optional) Enter words of explanation or wisdom in the Memo column.
9. (Optional) Assign the expense to a Customer:Job.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to
track your expenses by job, enter the customer who is going to reim-
burse you. Enter an amount for each account, if necessary. You can use
the down arrow to find customers and then click them.
10. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class
column. Notice the usual down arrow, and click it to see a list of classes.
(You don’t see a Class column unless you’ve told QuickBooks that you
want to use classes.)
If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you can set it
up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then
check the Use Class Tracking check box.
If you want, click the Recalculate button to total the expenses.
11. Use the Items tab to record the various items that the bill represents.
Click the Items tab. Enter the items you purchased and the prices you
paid for them.
If you realize after partially completing the bill that the bill does indeed
pay a purchase order, click the Select PO button, which appears on the
Items tab of the Enter Bills window.
141
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

From the Vendor drop-down list, choose the name of the vendor who
sent you the bill. In the list of open purchase orders, click in the column
on the left to put a check next to the purchase order (or orders) for
which you’re paying. Easy enough? Click OK when you’re done;
QuickBooks fills out the Items tab for you automatically.
12. Move to the Item column, and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click it to see the Item list. Does
the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click that item. If
not, choose Add New from the top of the list, and fill out the New Item
window (refer to Chapter 3).
13. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items you’re purchasing here. Make sure that the
Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their costs,
and their quantities. If you want to, click the Recalculate button to total
the items.
14. Save the bill.
Click Save & New to save your record of the bill and then enter another
bill. Or click Save & Close to record your bill but not enter another bill.
Entering your bills the fast way
You also can enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register. This
method is faster, but it makes tracking expenses and items more difficult.
If you want to enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts or click the Chart of Accounts icon on
the Home page.
The chart of accounts opens.
2. Open the Accounts Payable account.
When QuickBooks displays your chart of accounts, double-click the
Accounts Payable account in the list. You see the Accounts Payable 
register window, as shown in Figure 6-6. The cursor is at the end of 
the register, ready and waiting for you to enter the next bill.
3. Fill in the information for your bill.
Enter the same information that you would if you were filling in the
Enter Bills window that I describe at the beginning of this chapter. In 
the Vendor text box, click the down arrow, and select a name from the
Vendor list.
142
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

If you enter a vendor name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you see
the Vendor Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you to give
information about this new, mysterious vendor. Either click Quick Add to
have the program collect the information from the register as you fill it
out or click Set Up to see the New Vendor dialog box. (I describe the
choice between Quick Add and Set Up in the “To Quick Add or to Set
Up?” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter. I explain how to set up new ven-
dors in Chapter 3.)
You have to select an account name. You can probably find the right one
in the Account drop-down list, but if you can’t, enter one of your own.
You see the Account Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you
to fill in information about this new account.
If you decide as you fill out the register that you want to be reimbursed
for this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the
Edit Transaction button to see the Enter Bills window (refer to Figure
6-4). Follow Steps 2–12 in the “Recording your bills” section (earlier in
this chapter) to fill in the Enter Bills window. When you finish filling in
the window, click Save & New. You’re back where you started: in the
Accounts Payable window.
Figure 6-6:

Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

See the Splits button? This Splits button works the same as the Splits
button in the bank account register window. When you click Splits,
QuickBooks provides additional rows for inputting expense and class
information.
4. When you fill in all the information, click Record.
The Restore button, located just right of Record, is there in case you fill
out the register but decide that you want to start all over again before
you’ve recorded the transaction. Click Restore to clear the information
on-screen, and you have a clean slate.
Deleting a bill
Suppose that you accidentally enter the same bill twice or enter a bill that
was really meant for the business next door. (Just because you’re tracking
bills by computer doesn’t mean that you don’t have to look over things care-
fully anymore.) Here’s how to delete a bill that you entered in the Accounts
Payable register:
1. Locate the bill in the Accounts Payable register by using one of the
following methods:
• If you know roughly what day you entered the bill, you can scroll
through the list to find it. The entries are listed in date order. (Mark
the 1-Line check box to display each bill on one line rather than on
two lines to make the scrolling go faster.)
• If you don’t remember the date, use the Edit menu’s Simple Find
command.
And now, back to the Accounts Payable register window that you have in
progress. . . .
2. Select the bill that you want to delete by clicking anywhere in the bill.
3. Choose Edit➪Delete Bill.
QuickBooks confirms that you really, truly want to delete the transac-
tion. If you click OK, it dutifully deletes the bill from the A/P register.
Remind me to pay that bill, will you?
You could tie a string around your finger, but the best way to make sure that
you pay your bills on time is to have QuickBooks remind you. In fact, you can
make the Reminders message box the first thing that you see when you start
QuickBooks.
144
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

To adjust the QuickBooks reminder options, you must be logged on as the
administrator in single-user mode. Then choose Edit➪Preferences. When
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Reminders icon
from the list on the left and then click the Company Preferences tab to access
the dialog box shown in Figure 6-7. See the eighth active item on the list: Bills
to Pay.
Make sure that its Show Summary or Show List option button is selected, and
then give yourself several days’ notice before you need to pay bills by typing
a number (10 is the default and usually works well) in the Days Before Due
Date text box, in the Remind Me column.
Figure 6-7:
The
Preferences
dialog box.

Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
Using the Find dialog box
When you can’t remember the information that
you need to find a particular entry or transac-
tion, you can search for the information by using
the Find dialog box. For example, if you can’t
recall when you entered the bill, choose Edit➪
Advanced Find to open the Find dialog box.
Choose a filter (the category to search by). The
box to the right changes to include drop-down
list boxes or text boxes that you can use to
specify what you want to search for.
Choose as many filters as you like, but be 
careful to enter information accurately, or
QuickBooks will look for the wrong information.
Also, try to strike a balance, choosing only as
many filters as you really need to find your infor-
mation. The more filters you choose, the more
searching QuickBooks does, and the longer the
search takes.
After you finish choosing filters, click the Find
button, and the transactions that match all your
filters appear in the list at the bottom of the
window. Click the transaction that you want to
examine more closely and then click Go To.
QuickBooks opens the appropriate window and
takes you right to the transaction. Very snazzy, I
do believe.

If you click the Show Summary option (the first button to the right of the
option), you get a summary of the bills that you owe each time you start
QuickBooks. If you select Show List (the second button to the right of the
option), you get the details about each bill.
Be sure to review the Reminders window when you start QuickBooks or open
a new company file. The window lists reminders (such as forms you need to
print and payments you need to transmit) and tells you which unpaid bills
you’re supposed to pay. You can see this list by choosing Company➪
Reminders.
Paying Your Bills
If you’ve done everything right and recorded your bills correctly, writing
checks is a snap. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Pay Bills.
Alternatively, click the Pay Bills icon located on the home page. You see
the Pay Bills window, shown in Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8:
The Pay
Bills
window.
146
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

2. Change the Payment Date box (at the bottom) to the date that you
want to appear on the checks.
By default, this box shows today’s date. If you want another date on the
payment check — for example, if you’re postdating the check — change
this date. (See the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book for some
secret date-editing codes.)
3. Set a cutoff date for showing bills.
In the Show Bills Due On or Before date box, tell QuickBooks which bills
to show by entering a date. If you want to see all the bills, select the
Show All Bills radio button.
4. Use the Sort Bills By drop-down list to tell QuickBooks how to sort the
bills.
You can arrange bills by due date with the oldest bills listed first,
arrange them alphabetically by vendor, or arrange them from largest to
smallest.
5. Identify which bills to pay.
If you want to pay all the bills in the dialog box, click the Select All Bills
button. If you want to clear all the bills you’ve marked, click the Clear
Selections button. If you want to pick and choose, click to the left of the
bill’s due date to pay the bill. A check mark appears where you click.
Note that after you apply a payment, the Clear Selections button
replaces the Select All Bills button.
6. Change the Amt. to Pay figure if you want to pay only part of a bill.
That’s right — you can pay only part of a bill by changing the number in
the Amt. to Pay column. (Of course, they can always just send you
another bill. . . .)
7. Get the early payment discount rate on your bills, if any.
You may be eligible for an early payment discount on some bills. To find
out how much of a discount you get, click the Amt. to Pay field and then
click the Set Discount button to see the Discount tab of the Discounts
and Credits dialog box. Use the Discount tab’s Amount of Discount box
to give the dollar amount of the discount. Use the Discount tab’s
Discount Account box to specify which account should be used for
recording the money saved through the discount.
8. Get a list of credit memos that you can apply to the payment.
Click the Set Credits button to see the Credits tab of the Discount &
Credits dialog box. If you want to use one of the credits listed to reduce
the amount of the bill, click it and then click Done.
147
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

9. Select a payment method.
Use the Payment Method drop-down list to select the payment method
you want to use: Check or Credit Card. If you have more than one check-
ing account or credit card account, click the down arrow next to the
drop-down list, and select the account that you want to use. If you’ve
subscribed to and set up the QuickBooks online bill payment feature,
you have another payment method choice: online payment. I describe
making online payments in Chapter 13.
10. If you plan to print the check, select the To Be Printed option button.
Many businesses use QuickBooks to keep track of checks, but instead of
printing the checks, they have employees write them by hand. If your
business uses this method, select the Assign Check No. radio button.
Then, when QuickBooks asks how it should number the check, either
give the number by typing it into the appropriate box or tell QuickBooks
to automatically number the check.
11. Click Pay Selected Bills to pay the bills and close the Pay Bills window.
QuickBooks goes into the Accounts Payable register and notes that you
paid these bills; then it goes into the Checking register and “writes” the
check or checks. Figures 6-9 and 6-10 show you exactly what I mean.
Figure 6-9:
How a paid
bill looks 
in the
Checking
Account
register.
Oooh. Cool.
148
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

QuickBooks shows the original bill amount as the amount that’s paid, not the
original bill amount minus the early payment discount. It needs to use this
method to completely pay off the bill.
In the Accounts Payable register, you see BILLPMT in the Type column and
the amount paid in the Paid column. The Due Date and Billed columns are
now empty.
In the Checking register, you again see BILLPMT in the Type column.
But don’t kid yourself — these bills aren’t really paid yet. Sure, they’re paid in
the mind of QuickBooks, but the mind of QuickBooks extends only as far as
the metal (or trendy plastic) box that holds your computer. You still have to
write or print the checks and deliver them to the payees.
If you’re going to write the checks by hand, enter the check numbers from
your own checkbook into the QuickBooks Checking register’s Number
column. You want these numbers to jibe, not jive. (I know, a pun is the lowest
form of humor.)
Figure 6-10:

register.
149
Chapter 6: Paying the Bills

If you plan to print the checks, see Chapter 10.
And another thing: If you enter a bill, you absolutely must use the Pay Bills
command to record the payment that pays off the bill. If you don’t do this,
the unpaid bill just sits there forever, lonely and forlorn.
Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks includes a vehicle mileage-tracking feature that lets you track
your business miles. To track vehicle mileage in QuickBooks, choose
Company➪Enter Vehicle Mileage. Then, in the Enter Vehicle Mileage dialog
box that appears, record the vehicle, date, miles driven, odometer settings,
and reason for the trip. (I talk a bit more about tracking vehicle mileage in
Chapter 18, so you may want to refer there if this is something you’re really
interested in.)
May I briefly tell you the IRS rules for deducting business miles? Essentially,
you have two approaches to choose between. The easier method — and the
one that I use, because I’m lazy — is to record as a business expense an
amount per business mile driven. The rate per mile is roughly $0.445 —
which is far less than the actual cost of driving most cars. But hey, that’s the
price of slothfulness.
The hard method for tracking business miles is to track all your vehicle
expenses — including gas, oil, repairs, insurance, and vehicle depreciation —
and then record as a business expense the business-use portion of these
expenses.
To get the business-use portion of your vehicle, you use the ratio of business
miles to total miles. For example, if over the year you drive 6,000 business
miles, and your total miles are 12,000, your business-use percentage equals
50 percent. In this case, you can record as a business expense 50 percent of
your vehicle expenses.
Usually with the hard “actual expenses” method, you get a higher business
vehicle expense deduction. However, you should note that the IRS limits the
amount that you can include as vehicle depreciation, so you don’t get as high
a deduction as you might at first think. (You may want to consult your tax
advisor for details.)
No matter which method you use, you want a record of your actual business
miles, which the Enter Vehicle Mileage command lets you do. By law, you
need a good record of business mileage to legitimately claim the deduction.
150
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Paying the Sales Tax
To ingratiate itself with your retailers, QuickBooks includes a special dialog
box for paying sales tax. However, to use this dialog box, you have to have
sales tax items or a sales tax group already set up. See Chapter 3 for a thor-
ough explanation of items and groups.
To see how much sales tax you owe and to write checks to government agen-
cies in one fell swoop, choose Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Pay Sales Tax to access
the Pay Sales Tax dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-11. Alternatively, click the
Pay Sales Tax icon on the Home page in the Vendors area.
This dialog box is similar to the Pay Bills window (refer to Figure 6-8). The
buttons basically work the same way.
Click in the Pay column to add check marks next to all the items that you
want to pay. QuickBooks automatically writes checks in the Checking regis-
ter. Your payments are likewise recorded in the Sales Tax Payable register.
A Quick Word on the Vendor 
Center Window
If you choose Vendors➪Vendor Center or click the Vendor Center icon,
QuickBooks displays a window that summarizes a bunch of information
about the vendor in question. This feature doesn’t actually provide you new
information. But — and this is noteworthy — it does give you a slick way to
get all the information you have regarding a particular vendor. Note that you
can select which vendor’s information appears in the Vendor Center window
by selecting the vendor from the vendor list that appears at the left edge of
the window.

Inventory Magic
In This Chapter
 Using the Item list to track inventory
 Keeping inventory as you purchase items
 Keeping inventory as you sell items
 Using purchase orders to help track inventory
 Adjusting inventory records to reflect what’s really in stock
 Dealing with multiple inventory locations
 Taking the lazy person’s approach to inventory
F
or small and growing businesses, inventory is one of the toughest assets
to manage. First, of course, you need to physically care for stuff. Second,
you’ve got to make sure that you don’t run out of some item or have too
much of some other item.
QuickBooks (unfortunately) isn’t all that sophisticated in its inventory man-
agement features, but it is easy to use. And with a little jiggering, you can
probably get it to work in any simple case. (The one tricky part that I talk
about a little later in the chapter is what you can do when you keep inventory
in multiple locations. But I’m going to hold off on that discussion for a bit.
That’d be like jumping off the deep end of the dock before you’ve learned to
swim.)
If you want to make inventory accounting really easy and don’t care about a
bit of imprecision, take a peek at the last section of this chapter, “The Lazy
Person’s Approach to Inventory.”
Setting Up Inventory Items
Before you can track your inventory, you need to do two things. First, you
need to tell QuickBooks that you want to track inventory. To do this, choose
Edit➪Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Items & Inventory icon in the list on the left. Your screen should
look remarkably similar to the one in Figure 7-1. (You might have to click the

Company Preferences tab first.) Make sure that the Inventory and Purchase
Orders Are Active check box is marked and that one of the Warn If Not
Enough Inventory to Sell radio buttons is marked.
Here’s the second thing that you need to do: Create an Item list. This list is a
description of all items that you might conceivably put on an invoice. In
other words, all items that you order and sell belong on the Item list.
You should have set up your initial Item list in the EasyStep Interview (see
Chapter 2). If you need to add an item to your list, choose Lists➪Item List.
Then click the Item button, select New from the drop-down list, and fill in the
New Item window. If you want the blow-by-blow, go to Chapter 3 and get it
straight from the horse’s mouth.
After you turn on the inventory stuff and set up (or update) your Item list,
you can track your inventory.
When You Buy Stuff
As you unload items from a truck, receive them in the mail, or buy them from
a street peddler, you have to record the items so that QuickBooks can track
your inventory. How you record the items and pay for them depends on
whether you pay cash on the barrelhead, receive a bill along with the items, or
receive the items without a bill (in which case you’ll pay for the items later).
And you may have filled out a purchase order for the items that you’re receiv-
ing. If that’s the case, receiving the items gets a little easier. If you receive
items for which you’ve already filled out a purchase order, see the section
“How Purchase Orders Work,” later in this chapter. I strongly recommend fill-
ing out a purchase order when you order items that you’re going to receive
and pay for later.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Recording items that you pay for up front
Okay, you just bought three porcelain chickens in the bazaar at Marrakech,
and now you want to add them to your inventory and record the purchase.
How do you record inventory you paid for over the counter? By using the
Write Checks window, of course — the same way you record any other bills
you pay for up front. Just make sure that you fill out the Items column as 
I describe in Chapter 6.
Recording items that 
don’t come with a bill
What happens if the items come before the invoice? Lucky you — you have
the stuff, and you don’t have to pay for it yet. However, you do have to record
the inventory you just received so that you know you have it on hand. You
can’t do that in the Write Checks window because you won’t be writing a
check to pay for the stuff — at least not for a while. How do you record items
that you receive before paying for them? Read on:
1. Either Choose Vendors➪Receive Items or click the Receive Inventory
icon on the Home page, and select the option to Receive Inventory
without a bill.
You see the Create Item Receipts window, shown in Figure 7-2. This
window is similar to the Enter Bills window that I describe in Chapter 6,
but it says Item Receipt Only. (You see the Enter Bills window again
when you receive the bill for items.)
2. Fill in the top part of the window.
If you want to record items from a vendor who’s already on the Vendor
list, click the down arrow, and select the vendor. If the vendor is a new
vendor, select Add New from the list, and click Set Up to set up informa-
tion about the vendor: the address, the credit limit, payment terms, and
so on. You enter the information in the New Vendor dialog box.
3. Click the Items tab.
You need to click the Items tab only if it isn’t already displayed. It proba-
bly is. But the computer book writers’ code of honor and a compulsive
personality require me to tell you that there’s another tab — the
Expenses tab — and you could possibly display it instead.
4. Move to the Item column, and type a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in the Item column. Click it to see the Item list.
Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click it. If
not, enter a new item name. You see the Item Not Found message box.
Click Set Up, and fill out the New Item dialog box. (See Chapter 3 for help
with describing new items.)
155
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

You may just as well go down the packing slip, entering the items on the
Items tab. Make sure that the Items tab accurately shows what’s on the
packing slip. And put a brief description of the items in the Memo field,
because that description might prove useful later when you want to
match up your item receipt with the bill. When you finish, the Create
Item Receipts window should look something like what you see in Fig-
ure 7-2, earlier in this chapter.
5. Click the Save & New or the Save & Close button to record the items
that you just received.
Now the items are officially part of your inventory. The item receipt has
been entered on the Accounts Payable register. Not only that, but also,
you’re all ready for when the bill comes.
Paying for items when you get the bill
The items arrive, and you fill out an item receipt. Three weeks pass. What’s
this in your mailbox? Why, it’s the bill, of course! Now you have to enter a bill
for the items that you received three weeks ago. This job is easy:
Figure 7-2:
The Create
Item
Receipts
window.
156
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bill for Received Items.
Or, from the Home screen, click the Enter Bills Against Inventory icon. If
you’re on the Vendor Center, click New Transactions and then Enter Bill
for Received Items. The Select Item Receipt dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 7-3.
2. Click the Vendor drop-down list, and select the name of the vendor
who sent you the bill.
You see one or more item receipts in the box, with the date you put on
the receipt, its reference number, and the memo that you wrote on the
receipt.
3. Select the item receipt for which you want to enter a bill, and click OK.
The Enter Bills window, shown in Figure 7-4, appears. Does this informa-
tion look familiar? It should — it’s the same information that you put in
the Create Item Receipts window, only now you’re working with a bill,
not a receipt.
4. Compare the Items tab in the window with the bill.
Are you paying for what you received earlier? Shipping charges and
sales tax may have been added to your bill. You may also need to adjust
the price because you may have been guessing when you recorded
receiving the items. If so, add to and adjust the original receipt informa-
tion by using the Items tab. (You can click the Recalculate button to add
the new items.)
How many days do you have to pay this bill? Is it due now? Take a look
at the Terms line to see what this vendor’s payment terms are. Change
the payment terms if they’re incorrect by selecting a different entry from
the drop-down list. Remember, you want to pay your bills at the best
possible time, but for you to do so, the terms in the Enter Bills window
must match the vendor’s payment terms.
5. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the bill.
Of course, you still need to pay the vendor’s bill. Fair enough. Take a
look at Chapter 6 if you need help.

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Recording items and paying 
the bill all at once
Suppose that you receive the bill when you receive the goods. The items are
unloaded from the elephant’s back, and the elephant driver takes a bow and
hands you the bill. Here are the steps you follow:
1. Choose Vendors➪Receive Items and Enter Bill.
Or, from the Home screen, click Receive Inventory and then select the
Receive Inventory with Bill option there. Or, from the Vendor Center,
click New Transactions and then Enter Bill for Received Items. You see
the Enter Bills window (refer to Figure 7-4). If you’ve been reading this
chapter from its beginning, you’re familiar with this window, and you
know exactly what it is and what it does. If you landed cold turkey on
this page by way of the index, you need to know, for inventory purposes,
how to record the items you’re paying for.
2. Fill out the top part of the window.
This stuff is pretty basic. Select a vendor from the drop-down list, and
make sure that the vendor’s terms for paying this bill are shown cor-
rectly. If this vendor is new, choose Add New. QuickBooks asks you to fill
in an information dialog box about the vendor. Do it. Make sure that you
fill out the Bill Due line correctly.
Figure 7-4:
The Enter
Bills
window.
158
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

3. Click the Items tab, and list all the items that you’re paying for.
To see the Item list, move the cursor to the Item column, and click the
down arrow that appears. Make sure that the quantity and cost of the
items are listed correctly on the Items tab.
4. Click Save & New or Save & Close.
QuickBooks adds the items you listed to the Item list and makes them an
official part of your inventory.
When You Sell Stuff
In Chapter 4, I tell you how to list the items on the invoice. Maybe you
noticed the similarities between the Items tab in the Enter Bills window and
the Quantity/Item Code/Description/Price Each/Amount box at the bottom of
an invoice. QuickBooks uses both for keeping inventory.
When you sell stuff, QuickBooks automatically adjusts your inventory. In
other words, if you buy 400 porcelain chickens and sell 350 of them, you have
only 50 on hand. QuickBooks updates records for this change. No muss, no
fuss. Gosh, isn’t this great? No more lying awake at night, wondering whether
you have enough chickens or wombats or whatever. The same thing happens
when you make cash sales. When you list the items on the sales receipt,
QuickBooks assumes that they’re leaving your hands and subtracts them
from your inventory.
The moral of this story is “Keep a good, descriptive Item list.” And the other
moral is “Enter items carefully on the Items tab of checks and bills and in the
Item/Description/Qty/Rate/Amount box of sales receipts and invoices.”
How Purchase Orders Work
If you have to order stuff for your business, consider using purchase orders.
Create QuickBooks purchase orders even if you order goods by phone or by
telegraph or even via the World Wide Web — that is, whenever you don’t
request goods in writing. Filling out purchase orders enables you to deter-
mine what items you have on order and when the items will arrive. All you’ll
have to do is ask QuickBooks, “What’s on order, and when’s it coming,
anyway?” Never again will you have to rack your brain to remember whether
you’ve ordered those thingamajigs and doohickeys.
159
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

And when the bill comes, you’ll already have it itemized on the purchase
order form. Guess what? Having written out all the items on your purchase
order, you don’t have to fill out an Items tab on your check when you pay the
bill. Or, if you’re paying bills with the accounts payable method, you don’t
have to fill out the Items tab in the Enter Bills window. (Look at Chapter 6 if
you don’t know what I’m talking about here.) When the items arrive, all you
have to do is let QuickBooks know; the items are immediately added to your
inventory list.
Use purchase orders for items that you order — that is, for items that you’ll
receive and pay for in the future. If you buy items over the counter or receive
items that you didn’t order, you obviously don’t need a purchase order. What
you need to do is just pay the bill and inventory the items that you just
bought, as I explain in the first half of this chapter.
Choosing a purchase order form
Before you begin using purchase order forms, you may want to design a pur-
chase order form especially for your business. To do this designing, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
Or click the Purchase Orders icon on the Home page; or, from the
Vendor Center, select New Transactions and Purchase Orders.
QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase Orders window.
2. Click the Customize button, which appears at the top edge of the
Create Purchase Orders window.
When QuickBooks displays the Basic Customization dialog box (see
Figure 7-5), confirm that you’re working with the correct form template.
Typically, you want to make customizations to the Custom Purchase
Order template. But if you have created multiple templates, click the
Manage Templates button, and select the template you want to cus-
tomize from the list that QuickBooks displays.
3. (Optional) Add a logo.
To add a logo to the purchase order form, check the Use Logo box, click
the Select Logo button, and then use the dialog box that QuickBooks dis-
plays to identify the graphic image file of your logo. (This is a neat way
to personalize your purchase orders.)
4. (Also optional) Color your world.
To fiddle-faddle with the colors used on your purchase order or to
noodle around with the fonts used for the invoice text, experiment with
the Change Color Scheme list or the Change Font For list and the Change
Font button.
160
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

5. Specify purchase order information you want.
Use the Company & Transaction Information boxes to choose what you
want in the header, footer, and fields of your purchase order and in what
order you want the information.
Here’s the most important thing you should know about this purchase
order customization stuff. As you make your changes, the Preview area
shows what the customizations look like. So go hog-wild. Be adventur-
ous. If you make a mess, just click Cancel to abandon your customiza-
tion changes. Then, if you want, restart the process — perhaps a bit
wiser for the experience.
To get even more creative about your customizations, click the Layout
Designer button. When the Layout Designer window appears, use the
mouse to drag fields around the page to make the purchase order look
just the way you want. Click OK to return to the Basic Customization
dialog box.
6. When your purchase order looks magnificent, click OK in the Basic
Customization dialog box.
QuickBooks returns you to the Create Purchase Orders window.
If you later decide that you want to change your purchase order templates,
all you have to do is select Customize again from the Custom Template drop-
down list, click the Manage Templates button, and select the template that
you want to edit from the list that QuickBooks displays.

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Filling out a purchase order
Perhaps you’re running low on gizmos, or doohickeys, or some other item on
your Item list, and you’re ready to reorder these things — whatever they are.
Follow these steps to fill out a purchase order:
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
Or click the Purchase Orders icon on the Home page. Or click the New
Transactions area of the Vendor Center, and select Purchase Orders. You
see the Create Purchase Orders window, which is similar to what’s
shown in Figure 7-6. Note that the exact details of this window depend
on how you customize your purchase order form.
2. Select a vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.
Click the down arrow to see a list of your vendors. Click a vendor to see
its name and address in the Vendor box. If you can’t find the name of the
vendor on your list, click Add New from the list, and fill in the informa-
tion about the vendor in the New Vendor dialog box.
3. If you track your inventory by class, select a class from the Class drop-
down list.
The Create Purchase Orders window may not have a Class drop-down
list. If it doesn’t, and you want it to have one, you have to set up
QuickBooks to track expenses by Class. To do so, open the QuickBooks
file in single-user mode as the administrator. Then choose Edit➪
Preferences, and click the Accounting icon in the list on the left. (You
may also need to click the Company Preferences tab.) Finally, check the
Use Class Tracking check box.
4. (Optional) Select a Rep, an Expected Date, and a FOB (which I
describe in Chapter 4) if you’re using them on your purchase order.
You may have to fill in other fields before you get to the item-by-item
descriptions at the bottom. Again, these fields may not appear if you
haven’t indicated that you want them on your form.
5. Move to the Item column, and start entering the items you’re ordering.
Entering the items is the most important part of creating a purchase
order. When you move into the Item column, it turns into a drop-down
list. Click its down arrow to see the Item list. You may need to scroll to
the item that you want to enter. A fast way to scroll to the item is to type
the first few letters of the item name. If you type the name of an item
that isn’t on the Item list, QuickBooks asks whether you want to set up
this item. Click Set Up, and fill in the New Item dialog box.
Enter as many items as you want in the Item column. QuickBooks fills in
an item description for you, but you can edit whatever it puts into the
Description column, if need be. In the Qty column, indicate how many of
each item you need.

6. If you want to, fill in the Vendor Message field — and definitely fill in
the Memo field.
The Message field is where you put a message to the party receiving
your order. You could write, “Get me this stuff pronto!”
No matter what you do, be sure to fill in the Memo field. What you write
in this field appears in the Open Purchase Orders dialog box and is the
surest way for you to identify what this purchase order is for. Write
something meaningful that you can understand two weeks, three weeks,
or a month from now, when you pay for the items that you’re ordering.
At the bottom of the Create Purchase Orders window is the To Be Printed
check box, which tells you whether you’ve printed this purchase order. If
you want to print the purchase order, make sure that this box is selected.
After you print the purchase order, the check disappears from the box.
7. Print the purchase order.
Click Print to print the purchase order. If this purchase order is one of
many that you’ve been filling out, and you want to print several at once,
click the arrow beside the Print button, and select Print Batch from the
drop-down list. Before you print the purchase order, however, you may
want to click the down arrow beside the Print button and choose
Preview to see what the purchase order will look like when you print it.
QuickBooks shows you an on-screen replica of the purchase order. I
hope it looks okay.
Figure 7-6:

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

You use the History button after you receive the items you’re so carefully
listing on the purchase order. After you receive the items and record their
receipt, clicking this button tells QuickBooks to give you the entire his-
tory of an item — when you ordered it and when you received it.
As for the other buttons at the top, I think that you know what those are.
8. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the purchase order.
QuickBooks saves the purchase order and displays a new, blank 
purchase order window in which you can enter another order.
Checking up on purchase orders
You record the purchase orders. A couple of weeks go by, and you ask yourself,
“Did I order those doohickeys from Acme?” Choose Reports➪Purchases ➪
Open Purchase Orders to see a report that lists outstanding purchase orders.
Or click the Reports Center, select Purchases in the left column, and click the
Open Purchase Orders report.
Receiving purchase order items
Now that the doohickeys and gizmos have arrived by camel train, you need
to record the receipt of the items and add them to your Item list.
The first two things to do are to note whether the stuff came with a bill and
decide how you want to pay for it. These decisions are the same ones that
you have to make if you receive goods without having first filled out a pur-
chase order.
You record purchase order items that you receive the same way you record
other items you receive:
 If you pay for purchase order items with a check, you use the Write
Checks window.
 If you receive the purchase order items without a bill, you use the Create
Item Receipts window.
 If you receive the purchase order items with a bill, you use the Enter
Bills window.
Regardless of the window you’re using, when you select the vendor who sold
you the purchase order items, QuickBooks alerts you that open purchase
orders exist for the vendor and asks you whether you want to receive against
164
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

a purchase order. Of course you do. (Receive against simply means to com-
pare what you ordered with what you received.) When you click Yes,
QuickBooks displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, as shown in
Figure 7-7. Select the purchase order(s) that you’re receiving against, and
click OK. QuickBooks fills out the Items tab to show all the stuff you ordered.
If what QuickBooks shows is not what you received, you may have to make
adjustments.
Assembling a Product
QuickBooks Premier includes a cool tool for accounting for the manufacture
of items. Suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain, the example business I use in this
book, mostly just buys and resells coffee mugs and other porcelain doodads.
But also suppose that once a year, Pine Lake Porcelain assembles a collection
of red coffee mugs into a boxed St. Valentine’s Day gift set. In this case,
QuickBooks can record the assembly of a boxed gift set that combines, for
example, four red coffee mugs, a cardboard box, and some tissue paper.
Identifying the components
Each component that makes up the assembly — in this example, the St.
Valentine’s Day boxed gift set — needs to be an item on your Item list.
Chapter 3 describes how to add items to the Item list, so I don’t repeat that
information here. The weird thing about assembly items, however, is that the
New Item window identifies the parts that make up the assembly. For exam-
ple, the St. Valentine’s Day boxed gift set assembly includes these items: four
red coffee mugs, a cardboard gift box, and some tissue paper that loved ones
can use when they become emotionally overwhelmed by the generosity of
this thoughtful gift. These items get listed as the pieces that make up the
boxed gift set.
Figure 7-7:
The Open
Purchase
Orders
dialog box.
165
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Building the assembly
To build an assembly, choose Vendor➪Inventory Activities➪Build
Assemblies. Or, if you’re on the Home Screen, click the Build Assemblies icon
in the Company area. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window,
shown in Figure 7-8. All you do is choose the thing that you want to build
from the Assembly Item drop-down list and then the quantity that you (or
some hapless co-worker) built in the Quantity to Build box. Then you click
either Build & Close or Build & New. (Click Build & New if you want to record
the assembly of some other items.)
While I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the
Build Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
 In the top-right corner (roughly) of the window, QuickBooks shows the
quantities of the assembly that you have on hand and for which cus-
tomers have placed orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, so,
hey — remember that it’s there.
 The main part of the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes
into your product. Not that you care, but this is called a bill of materials.
 At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the
maximum number of assemblies you can make, given your current
inventory holdings.
 When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts.
For example, in the case of boxed gift sets — each with four red coffee
mugs, one wrapping tissue, and a cardboard box — QuickBooks reduces
the item counts of red coffee mugs, wrapping tissues, and boxes, and
increases the item counts of the boxed gift sets when you record build-
ing the assembly.
 Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory
items. When you use non–inventory parts in an assembly, QuickBooks
doesn’t care about the item counts.
Time for a Reality Check
QuickBooks does a pretty good job of tracking inventory, but you’re still
going to have to make that complete annual inventory of what you have in
stock. What I’m saying here is that you’re going to have to go over everything
and count it by hand. Sorry. You just can’t avoid that chore.
166
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

QuickBooks will produce a handy physical inventory worksheet that you and
your minions can use to count inventory. To produce this report, choose
Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Physical Inventory Worksheet. Then, after
QuickBooks produces an on-screen version of this worksheet report, click the
Print button to print hard copies of the worksheet. You can use the printed
worksheet to record actual physical counts of the inventory items you hold.
After you make your count, what happens if your inventory figures differ
from those QuickBooks has? First, you have to decide who’s right: you or a
computer program. You’re right, probably. Products get dropped. They break.
And that means that you have to adjust the QuickBooks inventory numbers.
Choose Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand. Or
click the Adjust Quantity On Hand icon in the Company section of the Home
screen. The Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window appears, as shown in
Figure 7-9.
The first thing to do is choose an account for storing your inventory adjust-
ments. Choose it from the Adjustment Account drop-down list. You also can
select a class from the Class drop-down list.
Figure 7-8:
The Build
Assemblies
window.
167
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

For what it’s worth, if it were me, I’d set up and use a special inventory
adjustments expense account. (That way, I’d have an easy way to see the
total inventory adjustments over the year.)
Go down the Item column, entering numbers in the New Qty column where
your count differs from the QuickBooks totals. Click Save & Close when
you’re done.
Dealing with Multiple 
Inventory Locations
Okay, you’ve seen now how QuickBooks handles your inventory. It isn’t fancy,
but for many businesses, it gets the job done.
Unfortunately, I’ve encountered a real headache when using QuickBooks for
inventory. What if you store inventory in multiple locations — for example, in
a Michigan warehouse and in a Chicago distribution facility?
Figure 7-9:
The Adjust
Quantity/
Value on
Hand
window.
168
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

The problem is that QuickBooks is set up to deal with a single inventory loca-
tion. So although you can know how much inventory you have in total, if you
aren’t careful, you won’t know how much is in Michigan and how much is in
Chicago. And you can’t even really check on inventory shrinkage, because
QuickBooks’ records don’t tie to location-specific inventory counts.
Now I need to tell you up front that you don’t have any good way to deal with
this in QuickBooks. But throughout the following sections, I explain a couple
of sloppy fixes that you can do.
Manually keep separate 
inventory-by-location counts
If you have only a handful of items in your little business — say, a few 
dozen — it’s pretty easy to keep a simple manual running tab on what you’ve
got in the Michigan warehouse and what’s in the Chicago distribution facility.
Such a system is very . . . er, crude. It may just be a couple of sticky notes
taped to your computer monitor. No kidding. But it lets you know how much
inventory you’ve got (roughly) and where it’s stored. And for some purposes,
that works okay.
Use different item numbers 
for different locations
The embarrassingly crude approach that I describe in the preceding section
doesn’t work if you have a lot of items — so the approach won’t work for a
multiple-location retailer. Accordingly, if you’re a retailer with a large number
of items, I’m sorry, but I think you probably need to create sets of item num-
bers for each inventory location. This means a lot more work for you, of
course, but it’s really the only practical way to handle your inventory if you
have more than a handful of items.
One more thought
I have one more thought for you: I think that we should start a letter-writing
campaign. I’m serious. We should all start writing letters to Intuit, asking that
a multiple-stores or multiple-inventory locations feature be added to some
upcoming version of the program.
169
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

The Lazy Person’s Approach to Inventory
The inventory accounting approach that I describe in the previous para-
graphs of this chapter is the textbook approach. What’s more, the approach
is a really good one, because it lets you accurately calculate your cost of
goods sold and accurately estimate the value of the inventory you’re holding.
To paraphrase Martha Stewart, these are Good Things.
You should know, however, that you can also use a simpler approach to
inventory accounting. Specifically, rather than keeping track of individual
inventory items by using a perpetual inventory system — this simply means
that you track each item as it moves into your business and out into a cus-
tomer’s car or minivan — you can use a simple periodic system. In the sec-
tions that follow, I tell you how a periodic inventory system works in
QuickBooks; then I tell you what’s bad and what’s good about a periodic
inventory system.
How periodic inventory systems 
work in QuickBooks
If you use a periodic inventory system, you set up an Other Current Asset type
account called Inventory, and then, whenever you purchase inventory, you
categorize the inventory purchase as falling into this “fake” inventory
account. (I’m calling the account a “fake” inventory account because it isn’t a
real inventory account to QuickBooks.)
To record your cost of goods sold each month, you use a journal entry to
move an appropriate portion out of the “fake” inventory account and into
your cost of goods sold account. How do you know what portion you should
move? Good question. In a nutshell, you guess based on what your historical
cost of goods sold percentage is.
Here’s an example of how this works: Suppose that since time immemorial,
your cost of goods sold has run 45 percent of your sales revenue, and that
last month, you sold $10,000 of stuff. In this case, you would figure that 45
percent of $10,000 ($4,500) equals the cost of the inventory that you sold.
Accordingly, you would move $4,500 out of the “fake” inventory account and
into cost of goods sold.
Predictably, this rough-and-ready approach means that your inventory and
cost of goods sold numbers are going to be wrong. So at the end of the year,
you still perform a physical inventory count to figure out exactly what you
truly hold in inventory. At that point, you’d adjust the inventory and cost of
goods sold balances so that they match what your physical inventory shows.
170
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

For example, it may be that over the course of the year, your rough 45 per-
cent number has meant that you moved $5,000 too much from inventory to
cost of goods sold. In this case, you’d move $5,000 out of cost of goods sold
and back to inventory.
Or you may find that you moved $5,000 too little from inventory to cost of
goods sold. To fix that problem, you move another $5,000 from inventory to
cost of goods sold.
A final quick point about using a periodic inventory: As I note in this little dis-
cussion, you don’t use inventory items if you’re using a periodic inventory.
So what you put on invoices or sales receipts is just a generic, non–inventory
part item.
The good and bad of a periodic inventory
A periodic inventory system is good for some types of businesses. For exam-
ple, if you have too many items to track with the QuickBooks Item list, the
approach that I describe here can be a lifesaver.
However, periodic inventory systems create some problems. Here are the
four biggest and baddest problems in my mind:
 You won’t really know which items are selling well and which aren’t
because you won’t be tracking sales by inventory items. This means that
you won’t be able to stock more of the hot-selling stuff and less of stuff
that’s not selling.
 You won’t know what you really hold in your inventory except when you
take that year-end physical inventory. (You won’t know how many dol-
lars of inventory you’re holding, nor will you know which item quantities
you’re holding.)
 Because you won’t make item-level adjustments based on your physical
inventory, you won’t know which items are prone to shrinkage from
problems such as theft, breakage, and spoilage.
 You’ll need to make the journal entries that record the dollars moving
out of inventory and into cost of goods sold. These journal entries aren’t
terribly difficult, but they can be a little bit tricky to figure out the first
few times.
You’ll need to decide whether you want or need to go with a simpler periodic
inventory system in spite of the problems such a system presents. The 
one final thought that I’ll leave you with is this: Many small businesses — 
especially small retailers — successfully use periodic inventory systems.

Keeping Your Checkbook
In This Chapter
 Writing checks from the Write Checks window
 Writing checks from the Checking register
 Recording deposits
 Recording transfers
 Voiding and deleting transactions
 Searching for transactions
T
his is it. You’re finally going to do those everyday QuickBooks things:
entering checks, deposits, and transfers. Along the way, you also find out
about some neat tools that QuickBooks provides for making these tasks
easier, faster, and more precise.
Writing Checks
Chapter 6 shows you the two ways to write checks: from the Write Checks
window and from the Checking register. In case you were asleep in the back
row of the class, here’s the short version of the instructions for writing
checks.
You can record debit card and ATM transactions the same way that you
record checks that you write.
Writing checks from the 
Write Checks window
You can record handwritten checks and other checks that you want to print
with QuickBooks by describing the checks in the Write Checks window.

To write a check from the Write Checks window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
You can also click the Write Checks icon located in the Banking section
of the Home Screen. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window,
shown in Figure 8-1. I closed the Open Window list pane, which usually
appears along the left side of the QuickBooks program window, to make
more room.
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window, and
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
This step is really important and is something that you should always
remember to do before you write a check.
3. Enter a check number or mark the check for printing.
Select the To Be Printed check box if you plan on printing the check with
QuickBooks, using your printer and preprinted check forms that you’ve
purchased. (I describe this process in Chapter 10.) If you’re recording a
check you wrote by hand, enter the check number you used for the
check in the No. box.
Figure 8-1:
The Write
Checks
window.
174
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

4. Fill in the check.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill fea-
ture fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you
after you start typing the name. How QuickBooks manages this feat may
seem akin to magic, but it’s really not that tough. QuickBooks just com-
pares what you’ve typed so far with names on your lists of customers,
employees, and others. As soon as QuickBooks can match the letters
that you’ve typed with a name on one of these lists, it grabs the name.
If you haven’t written a check to this person or party before, QuickBooks
asks you to add the payee name. Do that. (If you’re not sure whether you
want to add a payee or how to add a payee, refer to Chapter 6.)
Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign, and press Tab.
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line. It also
writes out the address if it has been filled out in the payee’s master file.
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute detail.
6. Click Save & Close or Save & New to finish writing the check.
There you have it. Your check is written, is entered in the Checking reg-
ister, and is ready to be printed and mailed.
Writing checks from the Checking register
People who’ve grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin of QuickBooks, might
want to use the Checking register window to write checks. (Quicken users
like the register metaphor better, I guess.)
To write a check from the Checking register, follow these steps:
1. Open the Checking register.
Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon in the
Banking area of the Home Screen. If you have more than one bank
account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box so that you
can select the proper account.
From the drop-down list, choose the checking account against which
you want to write the check and then click OK. You see the Checking reg-
ister window (see Figure 8-2). The cursor is at the end of the register,
ready for you to enter check information. (QuickBooks automatically
fills in today’s date.)
175
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

QuickBooks uses the account name in the window title. This is why
Figure 8-2 refers to Big Banking Account. That’s the name of the fictitious
bank account that I set up.
2. Fill in the information for your check.
Notice that the entries you make in this register are the same ones that
you would make in the Write Checks window. If you’re more comfortable
entering checks in that window, you can click the Edit Transaction
button, which is at the top of the Checking register window, to see the
Write Checks window in all its glory and write a check there. In fact, if
you want to enter expenses or itemize what you’re paying for with the
check, you have to click the Edit Transaction button and get into the
Write Checks window.
Otherwise, just go from field to field and enter the information in the 
register. Once again, use the drop-down lists to enter the Payee and
Account names. If you enter a Payee or Account name that QuickBooks
doesn’t recognize, the program asks you to give more information.
Here’s sort of a trick question: What if the check you’re writing pays
more than one category of expense? Like, say you pay your landlord
both for your rent and for a share of the utilities. Are you limited to one
expense account? Do you face the mother of all accounting dilemmas —
choosing between two correct accounts? Well, no, you don’t. You can
just click the Splits button. QuickBooks displays a splits area that you
Figure 8-2:
The
Checking
register
window.
176
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

can use to split a check across several different accounts. For example, a
$1,500 check that pays $1,200 of rent and $300 of utilities can split onto
two separate lines: one that records the $1,200 of rent expense and one
that records the $300 of utilities expense.
3. When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record
button.
You can also click the Restore button if you decide that you want to go
back to start over again. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just
entered.
If you write checks by hand as opposed to printing them with QuickBooks,
make sure that the check numbers in the Checking register and the check
numbers in your checkbook match up. You may need to go into the
QuickBooks Checking register and change numbers in the Number column.
When your bank statement comes, reconciling your bank statement and your
checkbook is much easier if you enter check numbers correctly.
Changing a check that you’ve written
What if you need to change a check after you’ve already entered it? Perhaps
you made a terrible mistake, such as recording a $52.50 check as $25.20. Can
you fix it? Sure. Just go into the Checking register and find the check that you
want to change. Go to the Payment or Deposit field, and make the change.
If you have more extensive changes to make (for instance, if the check is a
split transaction), put the cursor where the check is, and click Edit
Transaction. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window with the original
check in it. Make the changes. (Don’t forget to make changes on the Items
and Expenses tabs, too, if necessary.)
When you finish, click Save & Close. You go back to the Checking register,
where you see the changes to the check.
If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can also use the Next
and Previous buttons to page through your checks and make any changes.
Packing more checks into the register
Usually, QuickBooks displays two rows of information about each check you
enter. It also displays two rows of information about each type of transaction
that you enter. If you want to pack more checks into a visible portion of the
register, mark the 1-Line check box at the bottom of the Checking register
window. When you check this box, QuickBooks uses a single-line format to
display all the information in the register except the Memo field.
177
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

Compare Figure 8-2 with Figure 8-3 to see what the 1-Line display looks like.
Checking registers can get awfully long, and the 1-Line display is helpful when
you’re looking through a long register for a check or transaction.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Paying for items with cash
To track petty-cash purchases, you need a
petty-cash account. You can set up a petty-cash
account (which works just like a bank account)
by following the steps in “Setting up a second
bank account,” later in this chapter. To record
purchases that you make from the money in that
coffee can beside your desk, use the petty-cash
register. You can record cash purchases just as
you record checks. (Of course, you don’t need
to worry about using the correct check numbers
when you record cash purchases; you can just
use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on.) To record
cashed checking withdrawals to be used for
petty cash in the office, just record the with-
drawal as a transfer to your petty-cash account,
as I describe later in the chapter.

Depositing Money into a 
Checking Account
You can’t write checks unless you deposit some money in your checking
account. You didn’t know that? Well, the next time you’re taking your exercise
in the prison yard, give it some serious thought. From time to time, you must
deposit money in your checking account and record those deposits in the
Checking register.
You can record deposits in two ways. Find out about those ways in the follow-
ing sections.
Recording simple deposits
If you have a simple deposit to make — a sum of money that didn’t come
from one of your customers — just make the deposit directly in the Checking
register.
Suppose that your elderly Aunt Iris sends you $100 with a note explaining
how, more than 80 years ago, Great-Uncle Bert started his hammock manufac-
turing business with only $100, and for good luck, she’s sending you $100 to
help you along.
Recording a simple deposit is, well, pretty simple. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Checking register.
Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon in the
Banking section of the Home Screen. If you have more than one bank
account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box. Select the
checking account into which you want to make the deposit, and click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Checking register window (refer to Figure 8-2).
2. In the Date column, enter the date on which you made the deposit.
3. In the Payee column, enter the name of the person or business that
sent you money.
Don’t worry if QuickBooks adds a check number in the Number field
when you move to the Payee column. When you enter a deposit amount,
QuickBooks changes the Number field to DEP (for deposit, of course).
4. Enter the amount that you’re depositing.
Move the cursor to the Deposit column, and enter the amount.
179
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

5. Enter an account for this deposit.
Move to the Account field, click the down arrow, and choose an account
from the list. For a gift like this, you’ll likely choose an account like
Uncategorized Income.
6. Click the Record button.
Your deposit is entered, and your checking account’s balance is fattened
accordingly. Note that all entries in the Checking register are made in
chronological order, with deposits first and checks next.
Depositing income from customers
Depositing income from customers is a little more complicated if you have
been issuing invoices and receiving payments, because it involves the
Payments to Deposit dialog box. Have you been recording customer pay-
ments as they come in? (You do so by choosing Customers➪Receive
Payments or Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt, as I describe in Chapter 5; or
by selecting the Create Sales Receipts or Receive Payments icon on the Home
Screen; or by clicking the Customer Center and selecting New Transactions,
Sales Receipts, or Receive Payments.) If you’ve been recording customer pay-
ments and have told QuickBooks to group them with your other undeposited
funds, QuickBooks places these payments in your Undeposited Funds
account. Now all you have to do is transfer the undeposited funds to your
checking account. Here’s how:
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
You can also click the Record Deposits icon in the Banking section of the
Home screen. Because you have undeposited funds, you see the
Payments to Deposit dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4. This dialog box
lists the checks that you’ve received but haven’t put in a checking
account or other bank account yet.
The View Payment Method Type drop-down list lets you see payments of
only a particular type: cash, check, American Express, and so on. If you
group deposits by payment type, this box works as a slick tool to group
transactions that you’ll deposit together.
2. Select the checks that you want to deposit, and click OK.
Place a check mark next to the checks that you want to deposit by click-
ing the column next to them. If you want to deposit all the checks, click
the Select All button.
The Make Deposits window appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. Do you rec-
ognize the information in the middle of the window? It describes the
checks that you just selected to be deposited.
180
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

You want to make sure that the Deposit Total shown in the Make
Deposits window is the right deposit amount — in other words, the
actual amount truly deposited into the bank account. When you later
attempt to reconcile the bank account, you’ll compare the deposit total
shown here with your bank statement’s cleared deposits amount.
Figure 8-5:
The Make
Deposits
window.

The
Payments to

181
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

3. Select the checking account to receive these deposits.
Select the account from the Deposit To drop-down list at the top of the
window. And while you’re at it, check the Date text box to make sure
that it shows the date you’ll deposit these checks in your checking
account. In other words, if you’re not going to make it to the bank or the
ATM until tomorrow, put tomorrow’s date in the Date text box.
4. Add any other noncustomer deposits to include on the deposit slip.
If your grandma (bless her heart) gave you 1,000 pennies in 20 rolls, for
example, that’s an extra $10 that you can record on this deposit slip. At
the bottom of the list of payments, enter the name of the person who
gave you the cash, the account, a memo, a check number, the payment
method (cash, in this case), a class if you’re using classes, and the
amount.
5. Write a note to yourself in the Memo box to describe this deposit, if
you want to, and click the Print button to get a hard copy of the
deposit slip.
Many banks accept this deposit slip, so you can print it and put it in the
envelope with your ATM deposit or hand it to the bank clerk. Whatever
you write on the memo appears on the Checking register. (You should
probably write a memo to yourself in case you need to know what this
deposit is years from now, when you’re old and dotty.)
6. Record any cash back that you plan to get with the deposit.
If you need to get cash to replenish your petty-cash account, select the
account from the Cash Back Goes To drop-down list, write a memo, and
then record the amount of cash that you want to get back from the
deposit.
7. Click the Save & Close button at the bottom of the Make Deposits
window.
The deposit is recorded in QuickBooks. It appears in your Checking reg-
ister next to the letters DEP (which stand for Deposit).
Transferring Money between Accounts
Account transfers occur when you move money from one account to 
another — for example, from your savings account to your checking account.
But jeepers, why am I telling you this? If you have one of those combined sav-
ings and checking accounts, you probably do this sort of thing all the time.
Oh, now I remember why I brought this up: QuickBooks makes quick work of
account transfers as long as you’ve already set up both accounts.

Setting up a second bank account
If you haven’t set up a second account, you need to set one up. To do so,
open the chart of accounts by choosing Lists➪Chart of Accounts, or just
click the Chart of Accounts icon on the Home screen in the Company section.
Then click the Account button, and choose New. Fill in the name of the
account and, if you want to, the account number or a description of the
account. Then fill in the As Of box with the date that you opened the account.
Enter the opening balance as zero so that you can record your initial deposit
or transfer of money into the account. You record initial deposits the way I
describe earlier in this chapter (either as simple deposits or as customer
deposits, whatever the case may be). You record an initial transfer by com-
pleting the following steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
You see the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, as shown in
Figure 8-6.
2. Select the bank account from which you’re going to transfer the
money.
In the Transfer Funds From box at the top of the window, choose the
account from the drop-down list.
Figure 8-6:
The Transfer
Funds

Accounts
window.
183
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

3. Select the bank account to which you want to transfer the money.
In the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, select the account that receives
the funds.
4. Enter the amount that you want to transfer, and fill in the Memo box.
Someday, you might go into the register for the account that you’re writ-
ing this check in (a transfer appears just like a check in your register)
and wonder where you transferred this money and why. Filling in the
Memo box solves this little mystery beforehand.
5. Click the Save & New or the Save & Close button.
QuickBooks records the transfer, which you can confirm by opening
your Checking register. You see that the transfer has the letters
TRANSFR in the Type column and the name of the account to which you
transferred the money in the Account column. The amount that you
transferred shows up in the Payment column (because you transferred
the funds out of this account). Figure 8-7 shows a $100,000 transfer — in
the figure, the selected transaction is the one we’re talking about — from
a checking account called Big Banking Account to an account called Big
Bank Savings. You can tell this transaction is a transfer because the
other account name shows up in the Account box. 
Figure 8-7:

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

About the other half of the transfer
Here’s the cool thing about transfer transactions: QuickBooks automatically
records the other half of the transfer for you. Figure 8-8 shows the other half
of the transfer from Figure 8-7. This register is for a savings account called
Big Bank Savings. The $100,000 transfer from your checking account actually
made it into your savings account. The transfer once again shows up as a
TRANSFR.
Changing a transfer that 
you’ve already entered
Big surprise here, but changing a transfer that you’ve already entered works
just like changing a check. First, you find the transfer in the account register,
and then you click the Edit Transaction button. You see the Transfer Funds
between Accounts window with the transfer check that you wrote. Make
changes to the check and then click Save & New or Save & Close. You return
to the register, where your deposit is adjusted accordingly.

Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

To Delete or to Void?
What happens if you put a transaction — a deposit, a check, or a transfer
payment — in a Checking register and later decide that it shouldn’t be there?
You have two ways of handling this situation. If you want to keep a record of
the transaction but render it moot, meaningless, or nada, you void the trans-
action. But if you want to obliterate the transaction from the face of the Earth
as though it never happened, you delete it.
Decide whether you want to void or delete the transaction and then follow
these steps:
1. Find the transaction in the register.
In the upcoming section “The Big Register Phenomenon,” I tell you some
quick ways to find transactions.
2. Choose either Edit➪Delete Check or Edit➪Void Check and then click
the Record button.
There; the deed is done. Figure 8-9 shows a Checking register window
with a voided check. The voided transaction is the one selected. Notice
the word VOID in the Memo column. If this check had been deleted, it
wouldn’t even show up in the register. An alternative method is to select
the check in the register or on the check screen and then right-click and
choose Void Check from there.
Figure 8-9:
The

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

The Edit menu changes depending on what kind of transaction shows or is
selected in the open window (that is, Void Deposit, Void Check, and so on).
Handling NSF Checks from Customers
I’ve had a handful of reader questions about how to handle insufficient-funds
(NSF) check transactions. Here’s the way I’d suggest handling this situation:
1. Record the service charge that the bank charges you for handling the
bounced check just like any other bank service charge.
You can enter a transaction directly into the register, for example. Or
you can even record the bank service fee as though it’s a check you’ve
just written. Anything coming out of your account is entered just like a
check. (Refer to the earlier discussions in this chapter for information
on entering transactions in the register or on recording checks.)
2. Record the adjustment to your bank account balance because the cus-
tomer’s check didn’t clear as a withdrawal or payment.
You can use a bad-debt expense account to categorize the expense of
the bounced check if you’re on the accrual basis for taxes; otherwise,
cash-basis companies should directly charge their sales income account
to reduce their income.
3. Optionally, try to collect on the check again.
Try running by the customer’s bank. You might also try to assess the
customer a bounced-check fee. (Refer to Chapter 4 for information on
invoicing customers.) But let’s be honest: You’re probably not going to
be able to collect, are you? So write a Note in the Customer’s master file
that says not to take any checks. It will appear right in the middle of the
Customer Center screen when you select them to record the next sale.
4. Post a huge copy of the check in your cash register area so the dead-
beat customer’s friends and family see the check.
This won’t help you collect, but it might make some new person think
about writing you a bad check.
The Big Register Phenomenon
If you start entering checks, deposits, and transfers into your registers, you
soon find yourself with registers that contain hundreds, and even thousands,
of transactions. You can still work with one of these big registers by using 
the tools and techniques that I talk about in the preceding paragraphs.
Nevertheless, let me give you some more help for dealing with . . . (drum roll,
please) . . . the big register phenomenon.
187
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

Moving through a big register
You can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to move up and down through
your register a screen full of transactions at a time. Some people call this
activity scrolling. You can call it whatever you want.
You can also use the Home key to move through the register. Press the Home
key once to move to the front of the field you’re currently in. Press the Home
key twice to move to the first field of the transaction you’re on (the Date
field), or press it three times to move to the first transaction in the register.
The End key works in a similar fashion. Bet you can guess how this works.
Press the End key once to move to the end of the field you’re in, press it twice
to move to the last field of the transaction you’re on (the Memo field), or
press it three times to move to the last transaction in the register.
Of course, you can use the vertical scroll bar along the right edge of the
Checking register, too. Click the arrows at either end of the vertical scroll bar
to select the next or previous transaction. Click either above or below the
square scroll box to page back and forth through the register. Or, if you have
no qualms about dragging the mouse around, you can drag the scroll box up
and down the scroll bar.
QuickBooks lets you sort your register in different ways, which makes
scrolling through and finding transactions much easier. To sort your register
the way you prefer, choose an option from the Sort By drop-down list in the
lower-left corner of the Checking register window.
Finding that darn transaction
Want to find that one check, deposit, or transfer? No problem. I discuss this
technique earlier in the book, but it’s appropriate here, too. The Edit menu’s
Find command provides a handy way for doing just such a thing. Here’s what
you do:
1. Choose Edit➪Find, and click the Advanced Find tab.
QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the
Advanced tab of the Find window (see Figure 8-10). You use this window
to describe — in as much detail as possible — the transaction that you
want to find.
Choose the Edit➪Find command to display the Simple tab of the Find
window. The Simple tab enables you to search for transactions by 
using the transaction type, customer or job name, date, number, and
amount. You can easily switch to an advanced search by clicking the
Advanced tab.
188
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

2. Choose a filter that describes the information that you already have.
In the figure, the Name filter is chosen. As you click different filters, the
Find window changes.
3. Describe the filter that identifies the transaction that you want to
locate.
In the upper-left box, which is set to Name in Figure 8-10, choose the
filter that describes the subject of your search from the drop-down list.
In case of an account-based filter, for example, you can select to look at
all accounts, just income accounts, just expense accounts, and so on.
Other filters provide different boxes and boxes for setting up the filter.
By the way, the case of the text doesn’t matter. If you type rainy, for
example, QuickBooks finds RAINY as well as Rainy.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
Yes, you can filter through as many fields as you want. In fact, you can
filter so much that nothing matches your specification.
5. Click Find to let the search begin.
Click the Find button to begin looking. If QuickBooks finds transactions
that match the one you described, QuickBooks lists them in the bottom
half of the window.

tab of the

window.

Chapter 9
Paying with Plastic
In This Chapter
 Setting up and selecting credit card accounts
 Entering credit card charges
 Changing charges that you’ve already entered
 Reconciling credit card statements
 Paying the monthly credit card bill
 Handling debit cards
 Handling customer credit cards
You can use QuickBooks to track your business credit cards in much the
same way that you use it to keep a checkbook. The process is almost the
same, but with a few wrinkles.
By the way, although this chapter is really about you charging money on your
credit cards, at the very end of the chapter, I talk about how to handle the
tricky problem of your customers paying with credit cards.
Tracking Business Credit Cards
If you want to track credit card spending and balances with QuickBooks, you
need to set up a credit card account — if you didn’t already do so in the
EasyStep Interview, which you can read about in Chapter 2. (In comparison,
you use bank accounts to track things such as the money that flows into and
out of a checking, savings, or petty-cash account.)

Setting up a credit card account
To set up a credit card account, you follow roughly the same steps that you
use to set up a bank account:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
Or click the Chart of Accounts icon on the home page. QuickBooks 
displays the Chart of Accounts window, shown in Figure 9-1.
2. Click the Account button in the lower-left corner of the Chart of
Accounts window and then choose New.
QuickBooks displays the New Account window, shown in Figure 9-2.
3. Choose Credit Card from the Type drop-down list.
Choosing Credit Card tells QuickBooks that you want to set up a credit
card account. I’m sure that you’re surprised.
4. Type a name for the account in the Name text box.
Why not do it right? Move the cursor to the Name text box, and enter
the name of your credit card.
Figure 9-1:
The Chart of
Accounts
window.
192
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

5. Type the card number in the Card No. text box.
If you’re creating a general Credit Card account for more than one card,
leave the Card No. text box empty. While you’re at it, you can describe
the card, too. You might want to type Usury! in the Description text box,
depending on your card’s interest rate.
6. In the Opening Balance text box, enter the balance that you owed at
the end of the last credit card billing period after you made your 
payment.
Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box, and use the number
keys to enter the balance value. If you just got this credit card, and you
haven’t bought anything with it, leave the box empty. You enter the bal-
ance as a positive number, by the way, even though you owe money.
The only time that you should enter a credit card account balance equal
to something other than zero, however, is when you start using
QuickBooks and are entering your trial balance as of the conversion
date. Otherwise, you’ll foul up your owner’s equity. (Refer to Chapter 2 if
you have questions about entering the trial balance or about the conver-
sion date.)
Figure 9-2:
The New
Account
window.
193
Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

7. Enter the As Of date on which you’ll start keeping records for the
credit card account.
You should probably use the date when you made your most recent 
payment.
8. Click OK.
QuickBooks redisplays the Chart of Accounts window (refer to Fig-
ure 9-1), except this time, the window lists an additional account: 
the credit card account that you just created.
Selecting a credit card account 
so that you can use it
To tell QuickBooks that you want to work with a credit card account, you use
the Chart of Accounts window — the same window shown in Figure 9-1. Go
figure! Or you can click the Credit Card Charges icon in the Banking Navigator.
Or you can also choose Banking➪Record Credit Card Charges➪Enter Credit
Card Charges.
Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts. After you display the window, double-click
the credit card account that you want to use. QuickBooks displays the Credit
Card register so that you can begin recording transactions.
Entering Credit Card Transactions
After you select a credit card account, QuickBooks displays the Credit Card
register. Figure 9-3 shows the register for a credit card account I’ve named
FrequentFlyer. It looks a lot like a Checking register, doesn’t it?
The Credit Card register works like the regular register window that you use
for a checking account. You enter transactions in the rows of the register.
When you record a charge, QuickBooks updates the credit card balance and
the remaining credit limit.
Recording a credit card charge
Recording a credit card charge is similar to recording a check or bank
account withdrawal. For the sake of illustration, suppose that you charged
$50.00 worth of burritos and margaritas to your favorite Mexican restaurant,
La Cantina. Here’s how you record this charge:
194
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

1. Choose Banking➪Record Credit Card Charges➪Enter Credit Card
Charges.
The Enter Credit Card Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
2. From the Credit Card list box, choose the credit card that you charged
the expense against.
Click the down arrow next to the Credit Card list, and choose a card
from the drop-down list.
3. In the Purchased From field, record the name of the business that you
paid with a credit card.
Move the cursor to the Purchased From line, and click the down arrow.
You see a list of names. Choose one from the list.
If you’ve never dined at this fine establishment before, choose Add New.
Then add the business name.
4. Select the appropriate radio button to indicate whether the transac-
tion is a purchase or a credit.
Select the Charge radio button if you want to record a purchase (which
is what you do most of the time and what this example shows you).
Select the Credit radio button if you want to record a credit on your
account (if you returned something, for example).
Figure 9-3:
The Credit
Card
Register
window.
195
Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

5. Enter the charge date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date line (if the cursor isn’t already there), and
type the date, using the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, type either
11262007 or 11/26/07 for November 26, 2007. If you’re entering this
charge two or three days after the fact, don’t enter today’s date. Enter
the date when the charge was made. Using that date makes reconciling
your records with your credit card company’s records easier when you
get your monthly statement.
6. Type the charge amount in the Amount field.
Move the cursor to the Amount line, and enter the total charge amount.
Don’t type a dollar sign, but do type the period to indicate the decimal
place.
7. (Optional) Enter a memo description in the Memo text box.
Move the cursor to the Memo text box, and type the specific reason that
you’re charging the item. In this case, you could type Important
Business Meeting or something like that.
8. Fill in the Expenses tab.
I’m hoping that you read Chapters 6 and 8 so that you know all about the
Expenses tab — and that you’re thoroughly bored by the topic.
However, for those of you who opened the book right to this page, you
use the Expenses tab to record business expenses.
Figure 9-4:
The Enter
Credit Card
Charges
window.
196
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

Move to the Account column of the Expenses tab, click the down arrow,
and choose an Expense account from the list (most likely, Travel &
Ent:Meals if this was a business lunch). If you enter a name here that
QuickBooks doesn’t already know, it asks you to set up an expense
account.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Amount column when you enter a
sum in the Amount field. Type something in the Memo column, and
assign this expense to a Customer:Job and Class if you want to. You need
to turn on class tracking if you want to assign the expense to a class.
9. Fill in the Items tab.
Because this charge is for a meal at a restaurant, you don’t itemize the
charge. However, if you were charging inventory items such as lumber,
paper supplies, and so on, you’d fill in the Items tab.
If you have a purchase order on file with the vendor that you entered in
the Purchased From line, QuickBooks tells you so. Click the Select PO
button to see a list of your outstanding purchase orders with the vendor.
If you don’t know how to handle purchase orders, see Chapter 7.
10. Record the charge by clicking the Save & New or the Save & Close
button.
The charge is recorded in the Credit Card register. Figure 9-5 shows what
the Credit Card register looks like after I enter a handful of charges.

Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

Changing charges that 
you’ve already entered
Perhaps you record a credit card charge and then realize that you recorded it
incorrectly. Or perhaps you shouldn’t have recorded it at all because you
didn’t pay for the business lunch. (Someone else paid for it after one of those
friendly arguments over who should pay the bill. You know the type of argu-
ment I mean: “No, I insist.” “On the contrary, I insist.” You get the picture.)
You have to go into the Credit Card register and either edit or delete the
charge by following these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
You see the Chart of Accounts window.
2. Double-click the credit card account where the faulty charge is.
Like magic, the Credit Card register appears on-screen.
3. Select the credit card transaction that you want to delete or change.
That’s easy. Just move the cursor to the transaction.
4. Void, delete, or edit the transaction:
• To void the credit card transaction, choose Edit➪Void Credit Card
Charge and then click OK.
• To delete the transaction, choose Edit➪Delete Credit Card Charge.
QuickBooks displays a message box that asks whether you really
want to delete the transaction. Click OK.
• To edit the transaction, click the Edit Transaction button at the top
of the window. You return to the Enter Credit Card Charges
window. Make your changes there, and click Save & New or Save &
Close. You also can make changes inside the Credit Card register
and then click Record when you’re done.
Reconciling Your Credit Card Statement
and Paying the Bill
You reconcile, or balance, a credit card account in the same way you balance
a bank account. (For help with this task, see Chapter 14.) After you success-
fully get the account to balance and click Reconcile Now, QuickBooks displays
198
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

the Make Payment dialog box, asking how you want to pay the bill. You can
either pay by check or enter a bill to be paid later. (The second option is the
accounts payable method, remember?)
If you opt to pay the bill by writing a check, you go straight to the Write
Checks window, and the Expenses tab is all filled out for you. Fill in the name
of the card issuer, the date, and so on. Click Save & New or Save & Close
when you’re done. The payment is recorded in both the Checking register
and the Credit Card register because you charge the credit card liability
account with the check total.
If you opt to enter the payment as a bill to be paid at a later date, you go to
the Enter Bills window. Fill everything out just as you would if you were in the
Write Checks window. When you click Save & New, the transaction is
recorded in the Accounts Payable register and the Credit Card register.
See Chapter 6 if you need to know more about either the Enter Bills or Write
Checks window.
So What about Debit Cards?
Debit cards, when you get right down to it, aren’t really credit cards at all.
Using a debit card is akin to writing a check more than anything else. Rather
than withdrawing money by writing a check, however, you withdraw money
by using a debit card.
Although a debit card transaction looks (at least to your friends and the 
merchants you shop with) like a credit card transaction, you should treat a
debit card transaction as you treat a check. In a nutshell, here’s what you
need to do:
 When you charge something to a debit card, record the transaction just
as you record a regular check. You may want to enter the transaction
number as the check number or in the Memo line so that you can keep
track of the transaction.
 When you withdraw cash by using a debit card, record the transaction
as a regular withdrawal (or transfer to a petty-cash account), as if you’d
gone into the bank with a withdrawal slip.
 When you make a deposit through a cash machine by using a debit card,
record the transaction just as you record a regular deposit.
199
Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

So What about Customer Credit Cards?
I want to talk about an awkward subject before you and I close our discussion
about how to work with credit cards. Let’s — gulp — talk about how to
handle customer credit card payments.
Okay, if you don’t already know this, although your customers probably love
to pay you with credit cards, customer credit cards create a headache for
you. The reason is that your merchant bank or credit card processor aggre-
gates customer credit card charges and then — maybe on a daily basis or
maybe every few days — deposits a big wad of cash into your bank account.
The cash represents the sum of the recent credit card charges minus a 
(hopefully modest) fee.
This all sounds innocuous enough, but here’s an example of how this works:
Customers A, B, and C come in on Monday and spend $5, $10, and $15,
respectively. Then, on Tuesday, customers D, E, and F come in and spend $10,
$50, and $30, respectively. On Wednesday, say that you don’t sell anything to
someone who uses a credit card, but you do see a $105 deposit into your
bank account from the credit card company.
The problem is that you’re looking at the last two days of credit card transac-
tions, and you know they total $120, because that’s the total you sold to cus-
tomers A, B, C, D, E, and F. So what’s with the $105? Is the missing $15 a
service fee? Oh, no, wait. Maybe Customer A called his credit card company
and blocked that first $5 charge . . . or maybe it was Customer B?
If you accept a credit card, you know how this works, right? It’s a royal
headache.
I think you probably have two reasonable approaches for dealing with this
madness:
 The Good Accountant’s Way: You can record customer credit card pay-
ments in the usual way — the way that QuickBooks expects. The Good
Accountant’s Way produces nice accurate records, but at the cost of
enormous bookkeeping hassles. Interested in more information? Great!
Use the QuickBooks Help command to search the QuickBooks online
help for the topic “recording a credit card payment.”
 The Bad Accountant’s Way: You can just record sales receipt transac-
tions when the credit card company deposits net charges amounts into
your bank account. In other words, using the example numbers given in
an earlier paragraph, rather than recording individual transactions for
customers A, B, C, D, E, and F as the sales occur, you can record a $105
200
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 

transaction when the credit card company deposits $105 into your bank
account. If you know the credit card company’s service charge, you can
record that, too, using a journal entry. (You’ll probably want to ask your
accountant for help on this.)
I should tell you something. The Bad Accountant’s Way probably isn’t justi-
fied unless you’re in a high-volume situation — such as a retail store — and
when you’re using a periodic inventory system or when you don’t sell inven-
tory. If you have only a handful of credit card transactions — say, one every
few days — or you’re trying to use a perpetual inventory system, you should
use the Good Accountant’s Way.

Stuff You Do from
Time to Time

In this part . . .
A
fter you start using QuickBooks, you need to com-
plete some tasks at the end of every week, month, 
or year. This part describes these tasks: printing checks,
payroll, budgeting, and so on. The list goes on and on.
Fortunately, QuickBooks comes with some nifty online 
features to help you get the job done.

Chapter 10
Printing Checks
In This Chapter
 Getting your printer ready to print checks
 Printing checks one at a time
 Printing several checks at a time
 Printing a register
T
his chapter covers the reductivity of the postcolonial implications in
Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Just kidding. It covers how to print
checks and checking registers.
Printing checks in QuickBooks is quick — well, it’s quick after you set up
your printer correctly. If you have a continuous-feed printer, you know by
now that these printers have problems printing anything on a form. The
alignment always gets messed up.
QuickBooks has check forms that you can buy, and I recommend using them
if you print checks. After all, the QuickBooks checks were made to work with
this program. And all banks accept these checks.
If you want help with printing reports, check out Chapter 15, where I cover
this topic in almost too much detail.
Getting the Printer Ready
Before you can start printing checks, you have to make sure that your printer
is set up to print them. You also have to tell QuickBooks what to put on the
checks: your company name, address, logo, and so on. And you might try
running a few sample checks through the wringer to see whether they come
out all right.

Follow these steps to set up the printer:
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup; then, at the top, click the Form Name
drop-down arrow, and select Check/Paycheck.
After you choose this command, you see the Printer Setup dialog box, as
shown in Figure 10-1.
2. Select Check/PayCheck from the Form Name drop-down list.
QuickBooks sets your printing options differently depending on which
form you want to print. For printing checks, you want to select the
Check/PayCheck form from the Form Name drop-down list at the top of
the dialog box.
3. In the Printer Name drop-down list, select your printer.
In the Printer Name drop-down list , click the down arrow, and look 
at the printer names. When you installed QuickBooks, it had a frank,
software-to-software talk with Windows to find out what kind of printer(s)
you have, among other things. Your printer is probably already selected,
but if it isn’t, select the correct printer.
4. Set the correct Printer Type option, if necessary.
This box is probably already filled in, too, thanks to that frank discus-
sion that I mention in Step 3. But if it isn’t, click the down arrow, and
select Continuous or Page-Oriented. (The former is generally for dot-
matrix printers and the latter for laser and inkjet printers, but it really
just depends on what kind of paper you use for your printer.)
Figure 10-1:

Setup dialog
box.

Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

5. Select the appropriate Check Style.
Now you’re cooking. This step is where you get to make a real choice.
Standard checks are sized to fit in legal envelopes. Voucher checks are
the same width as standard checks, but they’re much longer. When you
select the Voucher option, QuickBooks prints voucher information as
well: the items and expenses tabulations from the bottom of the Write
Checks window. QuickBooks also provides information about the check-
ing account that you’re writing this check on. The Wallet option is for
printing checks that are small enough to fit in — you guessed it — a
wallet.
6. (Optional) Click the Options button and then adjust your printer
options; when you’re finished, click OK to return to the Printer Setup
dialog box.
After you click the Options button, QuickBooks displays your printer’s
Properties dialog box. Use this dialog box to specify print quality,
number of copies, and other options specific to your printer.
7. Click the Fonts tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then the Fonts
button on that tab to customize the fonts on your checks.
When you click either the Font button or the Address Font button on
this tab, you see the Select Font dialog box (shown in Figure 10-2) or the
Select Address Font dialog box. You use the Address Font button to des-
ignate how your company’s name and address look and the Font button
to designate what all other print on your checks looks like. Here’s your
chance to spruce up your checks and make your company’s name 
stand out.
Figure 10-2:
The Select
Font dialog
box.
207
Chapter 10: Printing Checks

Experiment for a while with the font, font style, and type size settings.
For example, if you have a bookstore, choose the Bookman font (maybe
using bold for your company’s name and address); if you run a messen-
ger service, choose Courier; Italian mathematicians can use Times
Roman (just kidding). You can see what your choices look like in the
Sample box.
8. When you finish fooling around with the fonts, click the OK button to
go back to the Printer Setup dialog box.
9. Click the Partial Page tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then
select a Partial Page Printing Style.
Fortunately, some graphics appear; otherwise, you wouldn’t have a clue
what these options are, would you? These options are for the environ-
mentally friendly among you. Suppose that you feed two checks to the
printer, but the check sheets have three checks each. You have a left-
over check.
Thanks to this option, you can use the extra check. Select one of the
options to tell QuickBooks how you plan to feed the check to the 
printer — vertically on the left (the Left option), vertically in the middle
(the Centered option), or horizontally (the Portrait option). You feed
checks to the printer the same way that you feed envelopes to it.
10. (Optional) Click the Logo button and then enter a company logo or
some clip art.
In the Logo dialog box, click File, and find the directory and BMP
(bitmap) graphic file that you want to load. Click OK. Only graphics that
are in BMP format can be used on your checks, and Intuit recommends
that the logo be square.
11. Click OK when you’re finished.
That setup was no Sunday picnic, was it? But your checks are all ready to be
printed, and you’ll probably never have to go through that ordeal again.
Printing a Check
For some reason, when I get to this part of the discussion, my pulse quickens.
Actually writing a check for real money seems terribly serious. I get the same
feeling whenever I mail someone cash — even if the amount is nominal.
I think that the best way to lower my heart rate (and yours, if you’re like me)
is to just print the darn check and be done with it. QuickBooks can print
checks in two ways: as you write them or in bunches.
208
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

First things first, however. Before you can print checks, you have to load
some blank checks into your printer. This process works the same way as
loading any paper into your printer. If you have questions, refer to your
printer’s documentation. (Sorry I can’t help more on this process, but a mil-
lion different printers exist, and I can’t tell which one you have, even when I
look into my crystal ball.)
A few words about printing checks
Check printing is kind of complicated, isn’t it? For the record, I’m with you on
this one. I really wish it weren’t so much work. But you’ll find that printing
checks gets easier after the first few times.
Pretty soon, you’ll be running rather than walking through the steps. Pretty
soon, you’ll just skate around roadblocks such as check-form alignment prob-
lems. Pretty soon, in fact, you’ll know all this stuff and never have to read
pretty soon again.
Printing a check as you write it
If you’re in the Write Checks window, and you’ve just finished filling out a
check, you can print it. The only drawback is that you have to print checks
one at a time with this method. Here’s how:
1. Fill out your check.
Yes, I strongly recommend filling out the check before printing it. And
make sure that the To Be Printed box is checked. Turn to Chapter 6 for
help with writing checks with QuickBooks.
2. Click the Printer icon in the Write Checks window.
You see the Print Check dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3:
The Print
Check
dialog box.
209
Chapter 10: Printing Checks

3. Enter a check number in the Printed Check Number text box, and
click OK.
After you click OK, you see the similarly named Print Checks dialog box,
as shown in Figure 10-4. The settings that you see in this dialog box are
the ones that you chose when you first told QuickBooks how to print
checks. If you change the settings in the Print Checks dialog box, the
changes affect only this particular check. The next time you print a
check, you’ll see your original settings again.
4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in
the dialog box and then click Print.
In the Printer Name box, specify which printer you want to print to. In
the Check Style area, indicate whether you want to print a Standard,
Voucher, or Wallet-size check.
If you’re printing a partial page of forms on a laser printer, use the
Partial Page tab to indicate both the number of check forms on the par-
tial page and how you’ll feed them through your printer.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the check,
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
See how the Number of Copies text box is grayed out? If you want to
change this setting, you need to go back to the Printer Setup dialog box
(choose File➪Printer Setup).
After you click Print, QuickBooks prints the check, and you see the 
Print Checks – Confirmation dialog box (see Figure 10-5). Nothing tricky
here — just a list of the checks you’ve just tried to print.
Figure 10-4:
The other

dialog box.

Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

5. If the check didn’t print out right, click the check on the Print 
Checks – Confirmation dialog box to select it and click OK to return to
the Write Checks window.; then click the Write Checks window’s Print
button again, enter the new check number, and click Print again.
QuickBooks doesn’t automatically keep track of incorrectly printed
check forms, so you have to. If you botch a check form, be sure to write
VOID in large letters and permanent ink across the face of the check.
Then file the check away for your reference. Don’t throw the check away.
If you still have questions about how to check any mistakes, see the sec-
tion “What if I make a mistake?”, later in this chapter.
6. If your check looks good, click OK.
You return to the Write Checks window. Don’t forget to sign the check.
Printing checks by the bushel
What if you write a mess of checks and then decide to print them? That’s how
the process is usually done. Here’s how to print a bushel of checks:
1. Go into the Checking register, and make sure that the checks that you
want to print are marked To Print.
The quickest way to get into the Checking register is to choose
Banking➪Use Register. If you have more than one bank account, select
the Checking Account register that you want to open, and click OK. Do
the checks that you want to print have To Print in the Number line? If
not, tab to the Number line, press T, and then click the Record button.
QuickBooks automatically fills the Number field with To Print and then
moves on. (If the check you want to print already has a number, you
need to replace the number with T.)
Figure 10-5:
The Print
Checks –
Confirmation
dialog box.
211
Chapter 10: Printing Checks

2. Choose File➪Print Forms➪Checks.
You see the Select Checks to Print dialog box, in which you select the
checks to print (see Figure 10-6).
3. Click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to print
and then click OK.
All the checks are selected at first. If you want to print them all, fine. If
not, click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to
print so that QuickBooks removes the check marks. Or if you want to
print only a few of the checks, click the Select None button and then
click next to the checks that you want to print so that QuickBooks
places a check mark in the column.
When only the checks that you want to print have check marks, click OK
to continue with this crazy little thing called check printing. QuickBooks,
happy with your progress, displays the Print Checks dialog box (refer to
Figure 10-4). Here, you see the settings that you chose when you first
told QuickBooks how to print checks.
4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in
the dialog box and then click Print.
You can change the settings in this dialog box if you want them to be dif-
ferent. Any changes that you make for a particular batch of checks don’t
affect the default settings. The next time you print a check, your original
settings appear again.
In the Check Style box, indicate whether you want to print Standard,
Voucher, or Wallet-size checks. If you’re printing a partial page of checks,
enter the number of checks on the first page in the Number of Checks on
First Page text box.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the checks,
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
Figure 10-6:
The Select
Checks 
to Print
dialog box.
212
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

Note that the Number of Copies text box is grayed out. If you want to
change this setting, you need to choose File➪Printer Setup.
QuickBooks prints the checks, and then you see the Print Checks –
Confirmation dialog box (refer to Figure 10-5).
5. Review the checks that QuickBooks printed; then do one of the 
following:
• If QuickBooks printed the checks correctly, answer the Did
Check(s) Print OK? question by clicking OK. (QuickBooks, appar-
ently thinking that you now want to do nothing but print checks,
redisplays the nearly exhausted Write Checks window.)
• If QuickBooks didn’t print a check correctly, type the number of
the first incorrectly printed check in the text box and then click
OK. In this case, repeat the steps for check printing. Note, though,
that you need to reprint only the first bad check and the checks
that follow it. You don’t need to reprint good checks that precede
the first bad check.
Don’t forget to write VOID in large letters and permanent ink
across the front of incorrectly printed check forms. Then file the
checks for safekeeping. (Don’t throw them away.) To record the
voided check in QuickBooks, see the next section. 
If the numbers of the checks that you need to reprint aren’t
sequential and are, in fact, spread all over creation, make it easy on
yourself. Click OK to clear the list of checks to be printed, go into
the Checking register, click the Number line of the checks that you
need to print, and then press T. QuickBooks automatically fills
these with To Print. Then choose File➪Print Forms➪Checks, as in
Step 2, and continue from there.
If your checks came out all right, take the rest of the day off. Give your-
self a raise while you’re at it.
6. Sign the printed checks.
Then — and I guess you probably don’t need my help here — put the
checks in the mail.
What if I make a mistake?
If you discover a mistake after you print a check, the problem may not be as
big as you think.
213
Chapter 10: Printing Checks

If you’ve already mailed the check, however, you can’t do much. You can try
to get the check back (if the person you paid hasn’t cashed it already) and
replace it with a check that’s correct. (Good luck on this one.)
If the person has cashed the check, you can’t get the check back. If you 
overpaid the person by writing the check for more than you should have, 
you need to get the person to pay you the overpayment amount. If you under-
paid the person, you need to write another check for the amount of the
underpayment.
If you printed the check but haven’t mailed it, void the printed check. This
operation has two parts. First, write VOID in large letters across the face of the
check form. (Use a ballpoint pen if you’re using multipart forms so that the
second and third parts also show as VOID.) Second, display the Checking regis-
ter, highlight the check, and then choose Edit➪Void Check. (This option marks
the check as one that has been voided in the system so that QuickBooks 
doesn’t use the check in calculating the account balance.) If you’re voiding an
incorrectly printed check, you first need to create a transaction for the check
number that printed incorrectly and then void that transaction.
Of course, if you want to reissue a voided check, just enter the check all over
again — only this time, try to be more careful.
If you notice only after clicking OK in the Print Checks–Confirmation dialog
box that a check printed incorrectly, you can tell QuickBooks you want to
reprint the check in one of two ways. If you have the register window dis-
played, you can change the check’s number from 007, for example, to To
Print. If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can select the To
Be Printed check box.
214
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
A big bad warning concerning check voiding
In general, you shouldn’t void checks from a
previous year. (You would do this by choosing
Edit➪Void.) If you do, you’ll adjust the previous
year’s expenses, which sounds okay, but you
don’t want to do this because (a) it means that
you can no longer prepare income statements
and balance sheets that correspond to your
financial statements and tax returns, and (b)
you’ve already presumably included the check
in your deductions for the previous year. If you
do have a check that should be voided — say,
it’s outstanding and has never been cashed or
was a mistake in the first place — record a jour-
nal entry in the current year that undoes the
effect of the check. Normally, the entry is a
Debit to the Checking account and a Credit to
the Miscellaneous Income account in the cur-
rent year for the amount of the check if it was
expensed in a prior tax year. If it was for some-
thing other than an expense, just reverse the
check to the same account it was originally
charged.

Oh where, oh where do 
unprinted checks go?
Unprinted checks — those that you entered by using the Write Checks
window but haven’t yet printed — are stored in the Checking register. To
identify them as unprinted checks, QuickBooks puts To Print in the Number
line. What’s more, when you tell QuickBooks to print the unprinted checks,
what it really does is print the checks in the register that have To Print in the
Number line. All this knowledge is of little practical value in most instances,
but it results in several interesting possibilities.
For example, you can enter the checks that you want to print directly into the
register; all you need to do is type To Print in the Number line.
Printing a Checking Register
You can print a Checking register, or a register for any other account, too.
Follow these steps to print a register:
1. Open the account register you want to print.
Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon on the
Home Screen and then click the Print icon. If you have more than one
bank account, select the account register you want to print from the
drop-down list, and click OK.
2. Choose File➪Print Register.
You see the Print Register dialog box, shown in Figure 10-7. This option
is available whenever you have a register open for an account.
3. Fill in the Date Range text boxes.
To print a register of something other than the current year-to-date
transactions, use the From and Through text boxes. This step is pretty
darn obvious, isn’t it? You just move the cursor to the From and
Through text boxes and type the range of months that the register
should include.
Figure 10-7:
The Print
Register
dialog box.
215
Chapter 10: Printing Checks

4. If you want, select the Print Splits Detail check box.
As you know, a register doesn’t show all the messy details, such as the
Items and Expenses tab information, but you can select this check box
to include all this stuff on your printed register.
5. Click OK.
You see the Print Lists dialog box, shown in Figure 10-8.
6. If everything is cool, click the Print button, and skip the remaining
steps. If you want to change options in the Print Lists dialog box, pro-
ceed to the next step.
You don’t have to fool around with the Print Lists dialog box. If you want
to print a register pronto, just click Print, and QuickBooks sends the reg-
ister on its merry way to your printer. Then again, if you’re the sort of
person who likes to fool around with this kind of stuff, carry on with the
rest of these steps.
If you want to see the effect that the different settings in this dialog box
have, just experiment. You can’t hurt anything or anybody.
7. (Optional) Print the report to disk.
To print the report to disk as a text file, select the File radio button, and
choose one of the following Print To options:
• Choose ASCII Text File if you want to create a text file (for example,
when you want to import the register into a word processing 
program).
Figure 10-8:
The Print
Lists dialog
box.
216
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

• Choose Comma Delimited File to import the register into Microsoft
Excel or Lotus 1-2-3.
• Choose Tab Delimited File to, for example, import the register into
a database program like Access. (Oooh . . . fancy.)
8. Choose the paper orientation.
In which direction do you want the report to be printed: Portrait (regu-
lar) or Landscape (sideways)? Just select the appropriate radio button.
9. (Optional) Tell QuickBooks which pages to print.
Use the Print Range radio buttons and text boxes to limit the pages for
QuickBooks to print.
10. (Optional) Color your world; print your report in color.
If you have a color printer and want to print the register in color, select
the Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box.
11. (Optional) Preview the report.
To see how your settings will affect the report before you actually print
it, click Preview. QuickBooks shows you the results on-screen. This fea-
ture has probably saved more trees than you can imagine.
12. Click Print.
After you have the report exactly the way you want it (and not one
moment before!), click Print, and QuickBooks finally prints the register.

P
ayroll is one of the major headaches of running a small business. When 
I think of all the time that I’ve wasted figuring out withholding amounts,
writing checks, and trying to fill out comically confusing payroll tax returns,
it just makes me want to scream. Fortunately, QuickBooks helps. And in a big
way. In this chapter, I explain how.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll 
without QuickBooks’ Help
The easiest way to do payroll, quite frankly, is to sign up with an outside serv-
ice bureau, such as ADP or Paychex or QuickBooks’ Complete Payroll service.
If you have an accountant, you might also want to ask him or her about other,
cheaper, local payroll services.

Of course, the easiest route is often the most expensive, and payroll services
are no exception. In my experience, these full-meal-deal services tend to run
about twice the price of the QuickBooks Standard or Enhanced Payroll serv-
ice after you add everything up, but all you need to do is make a phone call.
(Check your telephone book for a local number, or if you’re interested in the
QuickBooks service, check the QuickBooks.com Web site.) The payroll serv-
ice will send someone nice out to your office. A few days later, all you need to
do is make a phone call or send a fax when you want to pay employees.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll 
with QuickBooks
If you want to use either QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll or QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll because you want to save money, you aren’t scared of a little
paperwork, or maybe you want the extra flexibility that comes with doing it
yourself, you need to sign up for the QuickBooks Standard Payroll (also
known as the Basic Payroll Service) for roughly $200 a year, or sign up with
QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll (previously known as Deluxe Payroll Service)
for roughly $300 a year.
To sign up for either service, get ready to hop on the Internet. Follow these
steps:
1. Choose Employees➪Payroll➪Order Payroll Service.
QuickBooks connects to the Internet and displays the first page of a 
multiple-page Web form that enables you to set up the Standard Payroll,
Enhanced Payroll, or Assisted Payroll service.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.
I don’t repeat the on-screen instructions for setting up the payroll serv-
ice. Providing that kind of information would be . . . well, extremely
redundant. Just carefully follow the instructions, and you’ll have no 
trouble.
Note: Setting up the QuickBooks payroll service requires that you have
accurate year-to-date payroll information for all your employees, as well
as state withholding rate information. You’ll want to collect all this infor-
mation before you begin. The process of setting up payroll — assuming
that you have the information at hand and that you have only a handful
of employees — shouldn’t take much more than half an hour.
220
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

Doing Taxes the Right Way
Even after you set up QuickBooks for payroll, you need a few other items if
you want to do payroll the right way (if you want to do payroll the wrong
way, you’re reading the wrong book):
 A federal employer identification number
 A state employer identification number (if you withhold state income
taxes)
 An unemployment tax identification number
 Some W-4 tax forms
Getting an employer ID number
To get an employer ID number, you need to file an SS-4, Application for
Employer Identification Number form, with the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). You can get this form at the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) or by calling
the IRS and asking for one.
You can also apply for and receive an employer identification number over
the telephone. You still need to fill out the SS-4 form before you call, however,
so that you can answer the questions that the IRS asks during the short tele-
phone application process. (You also need to mail or fax the form to the IRS
after you have your little telephone conversation.)
Or, even easier, you can just do it all online. Here’s the URL:
https://sa1.www4.irs.gov/sa_vign/newFormSS4.do
Having employees do their part
You also need to do something else before you can know how to handle all
those taxes: You need to have your employees fill out W-4 forms to tell you
what filing status they’ll use and how many personal exemptions they’ll
claim. Guess where you get blank W-4s? From your friendly IRS agent or the
IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) in the Forms & Publications area.
221
Chapter 11: Payroll

Paying Your Employees
After you subscribe to the QuickBooks Payroll service, set up your payroll
accounts, and get an employer identification number, you’re ready to pay
someone. This section is going to blow your mind, especially if you’ve been
doing payroll manually. The process makes your whole decision to use
QuickBooks to do your payroll worthwhile. Here’s how:
1. Start the payroll process by choosing Employees➪Pay Employees.
Alternatively, click the Pay Employees icon on the Home page. The
Select Employees to Pay window appears; it simply lists employees,
their salaries or hourly wages, and the last payroll date. If you don’t see
a name that you’re looking for in this list, you didn’t add the employee
to your Employee list during the payroll setup process. If you need help
adding employees to your list, read Chapter 3.
2. Change any settings that you want to.
You shouldn’t need to use any of the Select Employees to Pay window’s
boxes and buttons to change the way that QuickBooks does payroll. But
you can make several changes:
• If you aren’t going to print the checks — maybe you hand-write
them and just use QuickBooks to keep the books — leave the To
Be Printed radio button deselected.
• Confirm the bank account from which the employees are paid in
the Bank Account drop-down list.
• Typically, you want to leave the Enter Hours and Preview Check
before Creating option selected, just in case. When this option is
selected, QuickBooks displays a summary preview for each pay-
check that you create. If you select the Create Check without
Preview Using Hours Below and Last Quantities option, QuickBooks
doesn’t let you check its work first; it just creates the checks.
• Set the Check Date and the Pay Period Ends dates appropriately.
3. Select the employees whom you’re paying, and click the Create
button.
If you’re paying all the employees listed, click the Mark All button on the
right side of the Select Employees to Pay screen. If you need to mark the
employees individually, click next to each one in the left column — the
column with the check mark in the heading. Then click the Create
button to have QuickBooks create draft versions of the payroll checks
that you need for employees.
222
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

Next, QuickBooks displays the Preview Paycheck window if you indi-
cated in Step 2 that you want to preview payroll checks. This window
simply summarizes what you pay an employee. For example, if Joe
worked 80 hours, and he earns $15 an hour, the window shows that you
owe Joe $1,200. The window also shows the payroll tax and withholding
amounts that QuickBooks, ever the faithful companion, has calculated
for you.
4. Fill out the payroll information, as necessary.
The main thing to pay attention to in the Preview Paycheck window is
the Earnings box. It shows what QuickBooks assumes you’ll pay an
employee. In the Earnings box, you fill in the number of hours the
person worked and apply these hours to a customer or job, if necessary.
The Preview Paycheck window also includes an Other Payroll Items
input area. In the Other Payroll Items box, you enter commissions; addi-
tions, such as tips, bonuses, and expense reimbursements; deductions,
such as union dues and 401(k) contributions; and company contribu-
tions, such as insurance benefits and 401(k) matching amounts. You also
can change the payroll item or rate or add another payroll item, if you
need to.
Watch out for this: QuickBooks calculates the company taxes, the
employee taxes, and the amount of the net check; this information
appears in the Employee Summary area and the Company Summary area
of the Preview Paycheck window. If some information is inaccurate, click
the amount and change it, either by deleting it or replacing it with the
correct information.
You might also note that QuickBooks keeps totals for both the current
check and the year to date.
5. Click the Create button to record the paycheck transaction.
After you check all the employees’ paychecks, QuickBooks returns to
the Select Employees to Pay dialog box.
6. Print the checks.
You can print checks from the Select Employees to Pay window by click-
ing the Print Paychecks button. QuickBooks prints paychecks just like it
prints regular checks.
Got questions about printing checks? Take a look at Chapter 10.

Chapter 11: Payroll

Paying Payroll Liabilities
Make no mistake: Big Brother wants the money that you withhold from an
employee’s payroll check for federal income taxes, Social Security, and
Medicare. Big Brother also wants the payroll taxes you owe: the matching
Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal unemployment taxes, and so on.
So every so often, you need to pay Big Brother the amounts that you owe.
If you withhold money from employees’ checks for other reasons (perhaps
for health insurance or retirement savings), these amounts are payroll liabili-
ties that need to be paid to the appropriate parties.
Paying tax liabilities if you use 
the Assisted Payroll service
Fortunately, if you’re using the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll service, your fed-
eral tax liabilities and most (perhaps all) of your state tax liabilities are paid
as part of the service. In other words, Intuit withdraws money from your
bank account and uses this money to pay the appropriate federal or state
government agency.
Be sure to check which state payroll taxes QuickBooks calculates and pays.
In Washington state, which is where my business is located, QuickBooks
won’t calculate a couple of state payroll taxes, so I have to calculate these
myself (on the payroll tax form) and pay them with a check.
Paying tax liabilities if you use the
Standard or Enhanced Payroll service
If you’re using the Standard or Enhanced Payroll service, you need to pay the
payroll liabilities yourself. To do this, choose Employees➪Process Payroll
Liabilities➪Pay Payroll Liabilities, whereupon the Select Date Range for
Liabilities dialog box appears. Very important — the date range for the liabili-
ties is based on the paycheck dates, not the pay period covered by the pay-
checks. Select the appropriate date range, and click OK. When you do so,
QuickBooks displays the Pay Liabilities window.
224
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

All you have to do now is choose the liabilities or taxes that you want to pay
by clicking in the left column and indicating the portion of the amount due
that you want to pay. Unless you’ve selected the Review Liability Check to
Enter Expenses/Penalties option, QuickBooks automatically writes the check
and puts it in your register. QuickBooks automatically gives the check the
appropriate date and schedules it to pop up in your Reminders window at
the right time. I recommend always checking the Review box before the
check is created to be sure it’s exactly what you intend to pay. Also, if you are
enrolled in the EFTPS system online, the check is created the same way, and
the check number can be changed to EFTPS and not actually printed. 
When do you make payroll tax deposits? That’s a question that frequently
comes up. The general rule about U.S. federal tax deposits is this: If your
accumulated payroll taxes are less than $2,500 for the quarter, you can just
pay those taxes with your quarterly return. This law is called the De Minimis
rule. (My understanding is that the law was named after Congresswoman Dee
Minimis.) If you owe more than $2,500, other special rules come into play that
determine whether you pay deposits monthly, semimonthly, weekly, or even
immediately. The IRS tells you, by the way, how often you’re supposed to
make payments.
If you owe a large amount of money, you’re required to deposit it almost
immediately. For example, if you owe $100,000 or more, you need to make the
payroll tax deposit by the next banking day. Some nuances apply to these
rules, so unless you don’t owe very much (and, therefore, can fall back on the
De Minimis rule), you might want to consult a tax advisor (or call the IRS).
The general rule when writing payroll checks is to make the last checks that
you write the ones that pay your federal and state tax deposits when they
come due. You’ll never get into late-payment trouble if you follow this
approach. It will also make your life a lot easier when it comes time to fill out
Schedule B of Form 941, if you have to do so.
To make a payroll tax deposit, just deliver your check with a federal tax
deposit coupon to a financial institution that’s qualified as a depository for
federal taxes or to the Federal Reserve Bank that serves your geographical
area. The IRS should have already sent you a book of coupons as a result of
your asking for an employer ID number. And one other thing: Make your
check payable to the depository or to the Federal Reserve Bank. Note, too,
that the U.S. Treasury makes it very easy to make payroll tax deposits elec-
tronically by using the EFTPS. (EFTPS stands for Electronic Federal Tax
Payment System. The Treasury will send you information on this when you
start making deposits, so keep your eyes peeled for this easy way to save
yourself some time.) You can visit the www.eftps.gov Web site for more
information.

Chapter 11: Payroll

Paying other nontax liabilities
If you’re paying nontax liabilities for things like employee health insurance or
retirement savings — it doesn’t matter whether you’re using the Standard
Payroll service or the Enhanced Payroll service — you also use the Pay
Payroll Liabilities command (which I describe in the preceding section).
You need to pay all your payroll liabilities from the Pay Payroll Liabilities area
if you want QuickBooks to keep your payroll liabilities straight. I mention this
because people commonly just pay these liabilities by using the Write Checks
window. That creates a mess.
Preparing Quarterly Payroll Tax Returns
At the end of every quarter, you need to file a quarterly payroll tax return.
(By quarters here, I’m referring to calendar quarters.) If you’re a business
owner, for example, you must file a Form 941, which states how much you
paid in gross wages, how much you withheld in federal taxes, and how much
you owe for employer payroll taxes for the quarter.
You’ll find that QuickBooks makes filling out these forms darn simple.
If you have household employees, such as a nanny, you must file a Form 942.
Again, you fill out Form 942 to say how much you paid in gross wages, with-
held in federal taxes, and owe in payroll taxes. Unfortunately, QuickBooks
doesn’t do a 942 for you. Apparently, it thinks you don’t need domestic help.
Using the QuickBooks 
Assisted Payroll service
If you’re using the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, the service fills out
and sends the quarterly payroll tax forms for you.
Using the QuickBooks Standard 
Payroll service
If you’re using the Standard Payroll service, you need to fill out and send the
payroll tax forms, but don’t worry — QuickBooks prepares the 941 for you. If
you need to fill out the 942 or a state payroll tax form, QuickBooks can also
be of great help. All you really need to know for these other forms is what the
gross-wages totals are.
226
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

To get the gross-wages totals and the balances in each of the payroll tax lia-
bility accounts at the end of the quarter, print the Payroll Summary report.
Choose Reports➪Employees & Payroll➪Payroll Summary. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Payroll Summary report. Specify the range of dates as the quarter
for which you’re preparing a quarterly report. Scroll across to the Total
column, which shows the gross wages upon which your employer payroll
taxes are calculated.
The withholding account amounts are the amounts that you’ve recorded to
date for the employee’s federal income taxes withheld and the employee’s
Social Security and Medicare taxes, so QuickBooks needs to double these fig-
ures to get the actual Social Security and Medicare taxes owed. Choose
Reports➪Employees & Payroll➪Payroll Liability Balances. QuickBooks cre-
ates a report that tallies these amounts.
QuickBooks will create and print out a copy of Form 941 for you, so you don’t
have to get out your calculator or mess around with lining up the red form 
in your typewriter. Just choose Employees➪Process Payroll Forms, select
Federal, click OK, and then select the form from the list that QuickBooks dis-
plays. QuickBooks runs you through a wizard that asks you for your state and
the number of employees that you had over the quarter. Then QuickBooks
summarizes each line of the form. When QuickBooks is done, all you have to
do is print out the form.
If your accountant fills out the 941 or 942 form for you, you don’t need to
read this section of this chapter. Your accountant won’t have any problem
completing the quarterly payroll tax return by using the QuickBooks Payroll
report, and in fact — I kid you not — your accountant will probably even
enjoy doing it.
Filing Annual Returns and 
Wage Statements
At the end of the year, you need to file some annual returns — such as the
940 Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return — and the W-2 and W-3 wages
statements.
You need to prepare any state unemployment annual summary before you
prepare the 940 because the 940 requires information from the state returns.
227
Chapter 11: Payroll

Using the QuickBooks Assisted 
Payroll service
If you’re using the Assisted Payroll service, the service automatically fills out
and sends these forms for you.
Using the QuickBooks Standard or
Enhanced Payroll service
If you’re using the Standard or Enhanced Payroll service, you need to fill out
and send these forms in-house, but you get lots of help from QuickBooks.
QuickBooks creates and prints the 940 and W-2s/W-3 for you. All you have to
do is choose Employees➪Process Payroll Forms, select Federal, click OK, and
then select the form from the list that QuickBooks displays. QuickBooks asks
you for a little information, and then it does the calculating for you. Just
check the QuickBooks records against your own, and if everything matches,
print that puppy out. To look over the QuickBooks data included in the form
and verify its integrity, it helps to print an Employee Earnings Summary
report.
If you have a little trouble, call the IRS. If you have a great deal of trouble,
splurge and have someone else fill out the forms for you. Filling out these
forms doesn’t take a rocket scientist, by the way. Any experienced book-
keeper can do it for you.
Please don’t construe my “rocket scientist” comment as personal criticism if
this payroll-taxes business seems terribly complicated. My experience is that
some people — and you may very well be one of them — just don’t have an
interest in things such as payroll accounting. If, on the other hand, you’re a
“numbers are my friend” kind of person, you’ll have no trouble at all after you
learn the ropes.
The State Wants Some Money, Too
Yeah. I haven’t talked about state payroll taxes — at least not in great detail. I
wish that I could provide this sort of detailed, state-specific help to you.
Unfortunately, doing so would make this chapter about 150 pages long. It
would also cause me to go stark raving mad.
228
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

My sanity and laziness aside, you still need to deal with state payroll taxes.
Let me say, however, that you apply the same basic mechanics to state pay-
roll taxes that you apply to federal payroll taxes. For example, a state income
tax works the same way as the federal income tax; employer-paid state unem-
ployment taxes work like the employer-paid federal taxes; and employee-paid
state taxes work like the employee-paid Social Security and Medicare taxes.
If you’re tuned in to how federal payroll taxes work in QuickBooks, you really
shouldn’t have a problem with the state payroll taxes — at least not in terms
of mechanics. Also, note that the 2007 version of QuickBooks can now print
most state forms for most states if you subscribe to the Enhanced Payroll
service. Yippee.
The one thing you need to figure out is what your state wants. To do that, you
need to get the state’s payroll tax reporting instructions. You may need to
call the state. Or with a little luck, you may find online instructions at your
state government’s Web site. If that isn’t much help, you can probably look
up the state tax people’s telephone number in your local phone book.

Chapter 12
Building the Perfect Budget
In This Chapter
 Checking out powerful tips for business budgets
 Setting up a budget
 Reviewing QuickBooks’ Planning & Budgeting tools
I
don’t think that a budget amounts to financial handcuffs, and neither
should you. A budget is just a plan that outlines how you intend to gener-
ate sales, how you should spend your money, and your ideas about how you
can best organize your firm’s financial affairs.
Is This a Game You Want to Play?
If you’ve created a good, workable chart of accounts, you’re halfway to a
good, solid budget. (In fact, for 99 out of 100 businesses, the only step left is
to specify how much you earn in each income account and how much you
spend in each expense account.)
Does every business need a budget? No, of course not. Maybe you have a
simple financial plan that you can monitor some other way. Maybe in your
business, you make money so effortlessly that you don’t need to plan your
income and outgo. Maybe Elvis Presley really is still alive and living some-
where in the Midwest.
For everyone else, though, a budget improves your chances of getting your
business wherever you want it to go financially. It gives you a way to “plan
your work and work your plan.” In fact, I’ll stop calling it a budget. The word
has such negative connotations. I know — I’ll call it The Secret Plan.

All Joking Aside: Some 
Basic Budgeting Tips
Before I walk you through the mechanics of outlining your Secret Plan, I want
to give you a few tips. After that, I want to tell you a secret. A very special
secret.
Following are five ways to increase the chances that your Secret Plan works:
 Plan your income and expenses as a team, if that’s possible. For this
sort of planning, two heads are invariably better than one. What’s more,
although I don’t really want to get into marriage counseling or partner-
ship counseling here, a business’s budget — oops, I mean Secret Plan —
needs to reflect the priorities and feelings of everyone who has to live
within the plan: partners, partners’ spouses, key employees, and so on.
So don’t use a Secret Plan as a way to minimize what your partner
spends on marketing or on long-distance telephone charges talking to
pseudo-customers and relatives in the old country. You need to resolve
such issues before you finalize your Secret Plan.
 Include some cushion in your plan. In other words, don’t budget to
spend every last dollar. If you plan from the start to spend every dollar
you make, you’ll undoubtedly have to fight the mother of all financial
battles: paying for unexpected expenses when you don’t have any
money. (You know the sort of things I mean: the repair bill when the
delivery truck breaks down, a new piece of essential equipment, or that
cocktail dress or tuxedo you absolutely must have for a special party.)
 Regularly compare your actual income and outgo with your planned
income and outgo. This comparison is probably the most important
part of budgeting, and it’s what QuickBooks can help you with the most.
As long as you use QuickBooks to record what you receive and spend
and to describe your budget, you can print reports that show what you
planned and what actually occurred.
If you find that you’ve budgeted $1,000 a month for shipping costs, but
you discover that you consistently spend twice that amount, you may
need to shift some money from your monthly cocktail dress-and-tuxedo
allowance . . . unless you like coming in over budget on shipping charges.
 Make adjustments as necessary. When you encounter problems with
your Secret Plan — and you will — you’ll know that part of your plan
isn’t working. Then you can make adjustments (by spending a little less
on calling the old country, for example).
232
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

 A word to the wise: Don’t gear up your business overhead or your per-
sonal living and lifestyle when you have a great year (or even a few
great years) in the business. When you have a good year or even a few
good years, keep your overhead and expenses modest. Stash the extra
cash. If you can, build up some financial wealth that’s independent and
apart from your business assets. (One great way to do this, for example,
is by contributing to an IRA or by setting up a Simple-IRA or a SEP/IRA
for yourself and any employees.)
A Budgeting Secret You 
Won’t Learn in College
I also have a secret tip for you. (I’m going to write very quietly now so that no
one else hears. . . .)
Here’s the secret tip: Go to the library, and ask for the Robert Morris &
Associates Survey, the Risk Management Association (or RMA) Reference, the
Dun & Bradstreet Annual Financial Statement Survey, and any similar refer-
ences of business financial statistics. After you get these books, find a nice
quiet corner of the library, and look up how other businesses like yours (that
is, businesses that are the same size, sell the same stuff or services, and have
the same gross and net profits) spend money.
These references are really cool. For example, Robert Morris & Associates
surveys bank lending officers, creates a summary of the information that
these bankers receive from their customers, and publishes the results. You
can look up, for example, what percentage of sales the average tavern spends
on beer and peanuts.
Plan to spend an hour or so at the library. Getting used to the way that the
Robert Morris & Associates report, for example, displays information takes a
while. The taverns page doesn’t actually have a line for beer and peanuts, for
example. Instead, you see some vague accounting term like cost of goods sold.
Make a few notes so that you can use the information you glean to better plan
your own business financial affairs. If you spend about the same amount on
beer and peanuts every year as the average tavern, you’re in good shape —
well, unless you own a shoe store.
The point is that you can and should use this information to get a better
handle on what businesses like yours earn and spend.
233
Chapter 12: Building the Perfect Budget

A final, tangential point: Have you ever heard businesspeople talk about
benchmarking? The idea is that to compete in a market, you need to do at
least as well as your competitors or similar firms in other markets. And one
way to assess how you’re doing compared with competitors is to compare
financial ratios, or benchmarks. For example, if you compare what you spend
as a percentage of revenue on advertising with what similar firms spend, you
can often glean real insights into what you should do to better your business.
You’ll discover, for example, where you’re spending too much and where
you’re spending too little. You’ll also sometimes see competitive advantages
that you possess of which you were not aware earlier.
Setting Up a Secret Plan
Okay, enough background stuff. The time has come to set up your budget —
er, your Secret Plan — in QuickBooks. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets.
If you haven’t yet set up a budget, QuickBooks displays the Create 
New Budget window, as shown in Figure 12-1. If you have already set up
a budget, another window appears, and you need to click the Create
New Budget button to get to the Create New Budget window.
2. Select the year that you want to budget.
Use the box to specify the fiscal year. You use the arrows at the end of
the box to adjust the year number incrementally.
Figure 12-1:
The Create
New Budget
window.
234
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

3. Select the type of budget that you want to create.
See those two option buttons on the Create New Budget window? They
let you tell QuickBooks whether you want to create a budget of income
and expense amounts (done with a pro forma profit and loss statement)
or a budget of year-end asset, liability, and owner’s equity account bal-
ances (done with a pro forma balance sheet). Typically, you want to
budget income and expense amounts. After you indicate for what year
you want to budget and whether you want to budget income statement
amounts or balance sheet amounts, click Next.
4. Provide any additional budgeting criteria and instructions.
QuickBooks asks next whether you want to budget using additional cri-
teria, such as Customer:Job information or class information. You
answer this question by marking the option button that corresponds to
budgeting criteria you want and then clicking Next. (If you’re just start-
ing out, don’t worry about specifying additional criteria. Keep things
simple to start.)
5. Indicate whether you want to start from scratch; then click Next.
Next, QuickBooks asks whether you want it to create a first cut at your
budget by using last year’s numbers or whether you just want to start
from scratch. To answer this question, mark the option button that cor-
responds to your choice. For example, to budget from scratch, select the
Create Budget from Scratch radio button.
After you click Next, QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window
(see Figure 12-2).
6. Do your budget.
You use the Set Up Budgets window to identify the budgeted amounts
that you plan for each account. If you said that you want to budget from
scratch, by the way, QuickBooks shows a window with a bunch of empty
columns (like the window in Figure 12-2). If you said that you want to
base the coming year’s budget on last year’s real numbers, you see num-
bers in the columns.
If your Set Up Budget window is too big for the monitor, QuickBooks
shows only a few months of budgeted data at a time. Then you need to
click the Show Next 6 Months button to move to the next part of the
budget year. To move back to the first part of the year, click the Show
Prev 6 Months button. (Only one of these Show buttons appears at a
time.)
235
Chapter 12: Building the Perfect Budget

The Budget box, at the top-left corner of the Set Up Budgets window, lets
you name the budget you’re creating. Why? You can work with several
different versions of your budget. (To create a new budget, click the
Create New Budget button, which steps you through the process
described previously.)
To copy the amount shown in the selected box across the row, click the
Copy Across button. (This lets you copy, for example, some amount
you’ve budgeted for January into February, March, April, May, and so on.)
If you want to be a little fancier, you can also select some budgeted
amount and click the Adjust Row Amounts button. QuickBooks displays
the Adjust Row Amounts dialog box (see Figure 12-3), which lets you
adjust the selected amount by some specified percentage increase or
decrease. If you want to increase the budgeted amount by, say, 25% a
month, you use the Adjust Row Amounts window.
7. Save your budgeting work.
After you enter your Secret Plan, click Save to save your work and leave
the Set Up Budgets window open. Or click OK to save your work but
close the Set Up Budgets window.
I should mention, too, that you can just click Cancel if you don’t want to
save your work (in case you’ve just been noodling around).
Figure 12-2:
The Set Up
Budgets
window.
236
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

Adjusting a Secret Plan
To later make additional changes to a budget, choose Company➪Planning &
Budgets➪Set Up Budgets. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window.
Select the budget that you want to work with from the Budget drop-down list
and then make your changes. All the same tools that you had for initially set-
ting up your forecast (which I describe in the preceding section) are available
for editing your budget.
Projecting Cash Flows
If you tell it to, QuickBooks attempts to project your business’s cash flows.
To tell QuickBooks to do this, choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪
Cash Flow Projector. Then, when QuickBooks starts up its clever little wizard,
you follow the on-screen instructions. (This cash flow projector essentially
automates the same process that you’d step through on a scratch pad or the
back of an envelope.)
Using the Decision Tools
One other command available on the Planning & Budgets submenu deserves
mention: Decision Tools. The Decision Tools command displays a sub-submenu
of commands that you can use to find out more about accounting and finance,
and how to apply accounting and financial concepts to your business. For
example, the Decision Tools sub-submenu includes a command that steps you
through a wizard that explains what depreciation is and how you calculate it.
If you’re a regular Joe or Jane trying to be smart about managing your finan-
cial affairs, the Decision Tools sub-submenu offers some real nuggets of gold.
I recommend it.

Using the Other Planning 
and Analysis Tools
Some versions of QuickBooks include other planning and analysis tools, such
as forecasting and business planning. In general, you access these tools from
the Planning & Budgets submenu.
I don’t describe these other tools here. QuickBooks Pro, the most popular
version of QuickBooks, doesn’t supply the tools. However, keep your eyes
open — and feel free to experiment — if you see the other tools.

Online with QuickBooks
In This Chapter
 Using the QuickBooks online payment services
 Using the QuickBooks online banking service
 Reviewing other online services
I
n this chapter, I start by discussing QuickBooks’ online banking and bill
payment features — which are pretty cool tools for some businesses. At
the end of the chapter, I also briefly discuss some of the other online services
that Intuit provides for QuickBooks users.
Doing the Electronic Banking Thing
Before I discuss using the QuickBooks online banking and payment services,
you need to consider whether these features even make sense for you and
your business. Online banking does make sense for some people — maybe
even you. But then again, it might be more like the fins on a ’62 Cadillac: cool,
but not that cool.
So what’s the commotion about?
For QuickBooks, online banking includes two parts: online banking itself 
and online bill payment. Basically, online banking enables you to transmit
account transfer instructions to your bank and download (retrieve) account
information electronically by using your computer and modem. Online bill
payment allows you to transmit payment instructions electronically. (You
basically tell your bank to write, stamp, and mail a check so that you don’t
have to.)
And that, my friend, is about all there is to online banking.

A thousand reasons not to bank online
I don’t know whether you should bank online, really, but I’ll share some
thoughts with you. And no kidding, I’ve had my reservations over the years
about this feature. Is it safe? Is it easy? Is it just another way for a software
company — Intuit, in this case — to make more money off of me?
Here’s my latest thinking on the matter: You ought to use online banking. It is
safe if you don’t share your PIN, and it saves you tons of time. In fact, online
banking should allow many business owners to do their books themselves for
just a few minutes of work at the end of the week.
That being said, I should quickly point out the few flies in the ointment, so to
speak:
 Your bank needs to use Intuit’s service: To use the full-blown online
banking service, you need to use a bank that has signed up for Intuit’s
service. Many, many big banks have signed up. More banks sign up all
the time, of course, but some haven’t yet. So if your bank hasn’t jumped
on the bandwagon — that is, the Intuit bandwagon — you can’t really
jump on the bandwagon either. Or at least not as a full-fledged member
of the band. 
To find out whether your bank provides online banking, choose
Banking➪Online Banking➪Available Financial Institutions. After you’re
connected to the Internet, QuickBooks displays a list of the banks that
support Intuit’s flavor of online banking.
 It isn’t totally paperless: Although a totally electronic system sounds
really efficient and very slick, you need to realize that online bill pay-
ment (a key component of online banking) often isn’t that efficient or
slick because, to be quite honest, the system isn’t totally electronic.
“What the . . . ?” you’re saying. “I thought that was the point.” Let me
explain: For better or worse, most businesses are still set up to — and
still expect to — receive paper checks with remittance advices. What
often happens when you transmit payment instructions is that the bank
or online payment service simply prints a check for you. Think about
that for a minute. If the bank is printing your check, you still have all the
disadvantages of a printed check, like the following:
• You still need to allow extra time for mailing.
• You still have the possibility that the check will get lost.
• You still have the possibility that the check will be misapplied. (In
other words, the check to pay your power bill might instead be
applied to your neighbor’s account.)
240
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

 There’s a greater chance for error: What’s more, you have the extra
complication of having your bank, rather than you, mucking up all this
stuff.
 It ain’t free: Best of all, the bank most likely charges for this service.
And so does Intuit. (Remember that banks and software companies think
that online banking is an exciting new way for them to make money.)
 Possible vendor confusion: Receiving payments from your bank, as
opposed to directly from you, might confuse your vendors. The confu-
sion occurs because the checks that they receive come all bundled up in
these cute little envelopes that must be torn along the perforation on
just about all sides. And because you can’t send a remittance slip with
an online payment, vendors can easily credit your account incorrectly,
which can lead to problems. (My power company regularly threatens to
turn off the gas to my office because, even though my electric and gas
charges are included on the same bill, the power company doesn’t like
me to send one check via the QuickBooks online bill payment system. It
needs two checks: one for the electric bill and one for the gas bill.)
One other problem bears mentioning. When you use online banking, you
create a complex system without clear responsibilities for problem-solving
and technical support. And that means that when you have problems, you
often can’t call someone to get help. (No kidding. Just the other day, some
poor guy e-mailed me because his online banking stuff wasn’t working: Intuit
blamed the bank, the bank blamed his PC hardware, the PC company blamed
241
Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks
Finding a bank you can trust
Say you want to use Intuit’s online banking serv-
ices, but your bank isn’t signed up. In response
to this problem, many people might say, “Well,
dodo-brain, just switch banks.” But not you. You
know that switching banks is harder than it
sounds, especially for small businesses — 
and often is not a smart move. Many factors 
go into a successful small business banking
relationship:
 Convenience: Doing your banking should be
easy.
 Trust based on a long history: That way, you
can borrow money or set up merchant
credit card accounts without using your
children for collateral.
 Good rapport with a personal banker or
loan officer: If you ever have a problem —
and I hope that doesn’t happen — you have
someone to whom you can talk.
Sure, online banking is neat. Like Cadillac fins.
But online banking is neither the only nor the
most important feature you need to look at
when you consider a bank.

Intuit. . . . This guy has a problem that nobody can solve or will solve.) This is
important to understand, so let me briefly outline the steps that an online
payment might take:
1. You enter the transaction in QuickBooks.
2. You make, or QuickBooks makes, an Internet connection.
3. QuickBooks uses the Internet connection to send the transaction to the
bank.
4. The bank receives the transaction information and typically creates a
check, which it mails to the person you’re paying.
5. The person you’re paying gets the check, hopefully, and credits your
account.
Five simple steps, right? Wrong. Any of these five steps can go wrong — and if
one does, you don’t actually make the payment or transfer, and you won’t
know why:
 Bugs happen. If QuickBooks or your computer has a bug, it might say
that you’ve entered and transmitted a transaction when in fact you
haven’t. This has happened to me.
 Ya gotta get online. If your Internet connection doesn’t work or doesn’t
work dependably, you can’t send the online transaction. I’ve had prob-
lems both with online banking at home over a dialup Internet connection
(bad telephone cord) and at work using a network and a DSL connection
(either an incorrectly configured network or a bad DSL).
 Banks are fallible. If the bank screws up printing or mailing the check,
well, of course your check won’t get there. (I’ve had this happen, too, no
kidding. QuickBooks lets you enter a five-line address on a check, but the
check printed by the bank or online payment service can have only four
lines. So QuickBooks just removes the fifth line of the address block.)
I don’t mean to rant here, but whenever any of these problems occurs, you
won’t actually know what’s gone wrong — only that something has gone
wrong. And you’ll be responsible for solving the problem, even though it
might be the fault of your bank, Intuit, your Internet service provider, the
telephone company, or somebody else.
Making sense of online banking
So what should you do? Let me make a suggestion: If you use a bank that 
provides online banking, go ahead and try the service. Absolutely! It isn’t
very expensive — probably a few dollars a month. If you decide later on 
that you don’t like the service, you can always go back to banking the old-
fashioned way.
242
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking services, and you’re
really bummed out about it, you can try the online bill payment component
of online banking by using Intuit’s online bill payment service. Online bill pay-
ment is the part where you send instructions either to your bank (if it pro-
vides the service) or to Intuit to write and mail checks for you. You can use
the online bill payment service with any account — in essence, you just give
Intuit permission to automatically deduct money from your account to make
payments for you.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking, and you couldn’t care
less, don’t try the online banking stuff, don’t read any more of this chapter,
and consider taking the rest of the afternoon off.
Signing up for the service
All you need to do to sign up for online banking service is to choose
Banking➪Online Banking➪Set Up Account for Online Access. QuickBooks
starts an online application wizard that walks you through the steps to apply
for the online banking service. Just follow the on-screen instructions, and
voilà, that’s it. Another benefit of being literate.
To actually begin transmitting online payments or making account inquiries,
you need to complete the application and have that application processed.
Note, too, that you can also usually complete the application by filling out
paperwork from your bank and turning that in. You don’t have to use the
online application process.
Making an online payment
Plan to create and send online payments a good week before they’re due.
Processing your request and then printing and sending a check takes time for
the online bill payment service. And a check that your bank sends doesn’t go
through the mail any faster than a check you send yourself. So don’t expect
online bill payment to save you any time over sending checks that you print
or hand-write yourself.
After you sign up for online banking, making payments is easy. Just follow
these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
You can also click the Write Checks icon on the Home screen. If you’ve
written checks with QuickBooks before, you probably recognize your
old familiar friend, the Write Checks window, shown in Figure 13-1.
243
Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks

2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window, and
select the account from which you want to write this check.
Selecting the account is a really important step. Make sure that you’re
accessing the right account before you write a check.
3. Select the Online Payment check box.
Selecting this check box is another important step. If you don’t select
this box, you aren’t making an online payment; rather, you’re just writing
a regular check that you need to print or hand-write.
4. Fill in the check.
If the payee appears on one of your name lists, the AutoFill feature fills
in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line after you type a
few letters. For online bill payment, you must have the correct address.
If the address is incomplete, QuickBooks warns you and asks you to 
correct it. If you haven’t entered a transaction for this person or party
before or added them to a list, QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set
Up the payee name. Do that.
By the way, QuickBooks makes you collect more information about
anyone you’re going to pay with an online payment.

looks
familiar,
doesn’t it?
244
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign, and press Tab.
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line.
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these tabs are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute
detail. Start turning those pages.
6. Click the Save & New or the Save & Close button to finish writing the
check.
Click Save & New to write another check, or click Save & Close if you’re
finished writing checks for the moment. There you have it. Your check is
written, entered in the Checking register, and ready to be sent so that
your bank or Intuit can print and mail it.
And you thought this stuff was going to be tough, didn’t you?
People who have grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin product of
QuickBooks, may want to use the Register window to make online payments.
You can use the Register window in QuickBooks, too, although doing so isn’t
quite as slick. You just enter the payment in the usual way, except that you
type the word SEND in the Check Number text box.
Transferring money electronically
You can electronically transfer money between bank accounts, too, as long as
the accounts are at the same bank. (Both accounts, of course, also need to be
set for online banking.) Here’s what you need to do:
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
You see the Transfer Funds between Accounts window.
2. In the Transfer Funds From drop-down list, select the bank account
that you’re going to transfer the money from.
3. In the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, select the bank account to
which you want to transfer the money.
Select the account that you want to receive the funds.
4. Select the Online Funds Transfer check box.
Doing so tells QuickBooks that you want to make this transfer 
electronically.
5. Enter the amount that you want to transfer in the Transfer Amount
field, and fill in the Memo text box.
245
Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks

Someday, you might go into the register for the account that you’re
transferring money from and wonder where you transferred this money
and why. Filling in the Memo line solves this little mystery beforehand.
6. Click the Save & Close button.
The transfer is recorded. After you transmit the transfer instructions
(which I describe a little later in this chapter), the transfer transaction is
posted to your account — maybe not immediately, but as fast as a tele-
phone transfer or ATM transfer is posted.
Changing instructions
QuickBooks doesn’t actually send, or transmit, your payment and transfer
instructions until you tell it to. This little fact means that you can change or
edit your payment instructions (what you enter with the Write Checks
window) and your transfer instructions (what you enter with the Transfer
Funds between Accounts window) until you actually transmit them. You 
edit online payments and account transfers in the same way that you edit
regular payments and account transfers. Refer to Chapter 8 if you need more
information.
Transmitting instructions
After you describe the online payments and account transfers that you want
QuickBooks to make, you transmit that information to the bank. To do so,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Online Banking Center or click the Online Banking
icon on the Home page.
You see the Online Banking Center window, as shown in Figure 13-2.
2. In the Financial Institution drop-down list at the top of the screen,
select the bank to which you’re transmitting payment and transfer
instructions.
3. Review the payment and transfer instructions one last time.
Take one last peek at the Items to Send list to make sure that the pay-
ment and transfer instructions that you’re sending are correct. If you
have questions about a particular instruction, click it and then click the
Edit button. If you know that a particular payment instruction is incor-
rect, click it and then click the Delete button.
246
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

4. Click the Send button to transmit the payment and transfer 
instructions.
If you’re transmitting payment and transfer instructions for the first
time, QuickBooks probably prompts you to change your personal identi-
fication number (PIN). Figure 13-3 shows the PIN prompt. If you’ve trans-
mitted payment and transfer instructions before, QuickBooks prompts
you to enter your existing PIN.

5. Review any transactions that the bank tells you about.
Figure 13-2 shows two items received from the online bank: electronic
statements that you can use to see cleared transactions and to reconcile
your account. To view an online statement, click the statement and then
click the View button.
6. Click the Close box.
Hey, when you’re done, you’re done.
Balancing an online account
If your bank’s computers support the feature, QuickBooks retrieves an elec-
tronic version of your bank account statement. QuickBooks, with a bit of help
from you, happily compares this statement’s transactions with what your
bank account registers show. If QuickBooks identifies a transaction that is on
your bank account but not in your QuickBooks records, QuickBooks flags the
transaction as “unmatched,” and you know you need to record the transac-
tion in the usual way.
You can also enter transactions into the window that QuickBooks displays
when comparing your banking records with the bank’s records. To do so,
select the transaction from the list of downloaded transactions and then click
the Add One to Register button. QuickBooks uses the bank’s information to
record most of the transaction’s information into the register, but you typi-
cally need to finish recording the transaction and click Record. It’s a little
hard to visualize, but you know you’re done when the list of recent transac-
tions that QuickBooks has downloaded from the bank matches up with what
you’ve already entered in QuickBooks.
Message in a bottle
Doing all your banking electronically can be a little unsettling when you’re
starting out. What if, for example, you have a question? All you do is send an
e-mail message to the bank, asking the people there whatever question you
would normally ask in a telephone call or at the drive-through window. To do
so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Create Online Banking Message.
QuickBooks displays the Home Banking Message dialog box and fills in
the bank name (as long as you use online banking services with only one
bank). If you use online banking services with more than one bank,
select the name of the bank to which you want to send a message from
the Message To drop-down list.
248
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 

2. Click the Subject box and then type a brief description of your mes-
sage’s subject.
I may be telling you something you already know, but most e-mail pro-
grams simply display a list of messages that includes the sender, the
message subject, and the date. Therefore, the message subject that 
you use is one of the first bits of message information that the bank 
folks see.
3. Select the online account that you’re going to discuss in the message.
4. Click the Message box and then type your message.
You’re on your own here.
5. (Optional) Click the Print button to print a copy of your message.
6. Click OK.
When you click OK, you add the message to the list of stuff that’s ready
to send the next time you go online with your bank. You can send the
instructions immediately by following the steps in “Transmitting instruc-
tions,” earlier in this chapter.
A Quick Review of the Other 
Online Opportunities
Intuit provides several other small business–type services to QuickBooks
users. For example, Intuit has also arranged for a merchant credit card service,
which you can apply for online and then use online for receiving payments
and even getting charge authorizations. Through its Web site, Intuit also says
it provides a small business purchasing service that makes price shopping
over the Internet easy, or at least easier. And finally, as I hint in Chapter 11,
some of QuickBooks payroll services are very online-ish.
If you have questions about the current state of any of these products or 
services, visit the QuickBooks.com Web site, and search for the name of the
service.

In this part . . .
I
hope this doesn’t surprise you, but your accounting
system requires a bit of tender loving care. Oh, no,
don’t worry. Nothing unexpected. . . .
But you will want to know how to reconcile accounts (to
keep your books squeaky clean), how to keep your files
dust-free, and how to deal with some of the more tedious
accounting chores, including fixed assets accounting and
job costing.

Chapter 14
The Balancing Act
In This Chapter
 Balancing a non-online bank account
 Eleven things to do if your non-online account doesn’t balance
 Balancing an online bank account
I
want to start this chapter with an important point: Balancing a bank
account in QuickBooks is easy and quick.
I’m not just trying to get you pumped up about an otherwise painfully boring
topic. I don’t think that balancing a bank account is any more exciting than
you do.
My point is simply this: Because bank account balancing can be tedious and
boring, use QuickBooks to speed up the drudgery.
Balancing a Non-Online Bank Account
As I said, balancing a bank account is remarkably easy in QuickBooks. In fact,
I’ll go so far as to say that if you have any problems, they stem from . . . well,
sloppy record keeping that preceded your use of QuickBooks.
Enough of this blather; I’ll get started by describing how you reconcile a non-
online account. By this awkward label, non-online bank account, I just mean a
bank account that isn’t an account set up for online banking. I describe the
steps for balancing online accounts in the section “Balancing an Online Bank
Account,” later in this chapter.

Giving QuickBooks information 
from the bank statement
In a reconciliation, as you probably know, you compare your records of a
bank account with the bank’s records of the same account. You should be
able to explain any difference between the two accounts — usually by point-
ing to checks that you’ve written but that haven’t yet cleared. (Sometimes
deposits fall into the same category; you’ve recorded a deposit and mailed it,
but the bank hasn’t yet credited your account.)
The first step, then, is to supply QuickBooks the bank’s account information.
You get this information from your monthly statement. Supply QuickBooks
the figures it needs, as follows:
1. Choose Banking➪Reconcile or click the Reconcile icon on the home
page.
QuickBooks displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, as shown in
Figure 14-1.
If you have several bank accounts, you may have to select which
account you want to reconcile.
2. If the bank account shown isn’t the one you want to reconcile, open
the Account list, and select the correct account.
3. Enter the bank statement date into the Statement Date box.
Remember that you can adjust a date one day at a time by using the plus
(+) and minus (–) keys. You can also click the Calendar button on the
right side of the text box to select a date from the calendar. See the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a list of other secret date-editing
tricks.
Figure 14-1:
The Begin
Reconcilia-
tion dialog
box.
254
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

4. Verify the bank statement opening balance.
QuickBooks displays an amount in the Beginning Balance text box (refer
to Figure 14-1).
If the opening balance isn’t correct, see the sidebar “Why isn’t my opening
balance the same as the one in QuickBooks?”, elsewhere in this chapter.
5. Enter the ending balance from your bank statement into the Ending
Balance text box.
6. Enter the bank’s service charge.
If the bank statement shows a service charge, and you haven’t already
entered it, move the cursor to the Service Charge text box, and type the
amount.
7. Enter a transaction date for the service charge transaction.
QuickBooks adds one month to the service charge date from the last
time you reconciled. If this date isn’t correct, type the correct one.
8. Assign the bank’s service charge to an account.
Enter the expense account to which you assign bank service charges in
the first Account text box — the one beside the Date text box. Activate
the drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the category by
using the arrow keys, and press Enter. I’ll bet anything that you record
these charges in the Bank Service Charges account that QuickBooks sets
up by default.
If you told QuickBooks that you also want to track income and expense
amounts by using classes, QuickBooks adds Class boxes to the Begin
Reconciliation dialog box so that you can collect this information.
9. Enter the account’s interest income.
If the account earned interest for the month, and you haven’t already
entered this figure, type an amount in the Interest Earned text box (for
example, type 9.17 for $9.17).
10. Enter a transaction date for the interest income transaction.
You already know how to enter dates. I won’t bore you by explaining it
again (but see Step 3 if you’re having trouble).
11. Assign the interest to an account.
In the second Account text box, enter the account to which this
account’s interest should be assigned . I bet that you record this one
under the Interest Income account, which is near the bottom of the
Account drop-down list. To select a category from the Account list, acti-
vate the drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the cate-
gory, and press Enter.
12. Click Continue.
QuickBooks displays the Reconcile window, as shown in Figure 14-2.
255
Chapter 14: The Balancing Act

Marking cleared checks and deposits
Using the Reconcile window, shown in Figure 14-2, you tell QuickBooks which
deposits and checks have cleared at the bank. (Refer to your bank statement
for this information.) Follow these steps:
1. Identify the first deposit that has cleared.
You know how to do so, I’m sure. Just leaf through the bank statement,
and find the first deposit listed.
2. Mark the first cleared deposit as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Deposits and Other Credits
section of the Reconcile window, find the deposit, and then click it. You
also can highlight the deposit by using the Tab and arrow keys and then
pressing the spacebar. QuickBooks places a check mark in front of the
deposit to mark it as cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
If you have a large number of deposits to clear, and you can identify
them quickly, click the Mark All button and then simply unmark the
transactions that aren’t on the bank statement. To unmark a transaction,
click it. The check mark disappears.
Figure 14-2:
The
Reconcile
window.
256
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

3. Record any cleared but missing deposits.
If you can’t find a deposit in the Reconcile window, you haven’t entered
it into the Checking register yet. I can only guess why you haven’t
entered it. Maybe you just forgot. Close or deactivate the Reconcile
window by clicking Leave. Now open the Checking register, and enter
the deposit in the register in the usual way. To return to the Reconcile
window, either reopen it or reactivate it. Or you can just click Banking➪
Make Deposits and open the deposit screen right on top of the Reconcile
Window, if you like. Record the deposit, and click Save & Close. Now it
appears in the Reconcile Deposits area.
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 for all deposits listed on the bank statement.
Make sure that the dates match and that the amounts of the deposits are
correct. If they’re not, go back to the transactions and correct them. To
get to a transaction, click the Go To button. You see the Write Checks or
Make Deposits window where the transaction was originally recorded.
Make the corrections there and then click the Save & Close button. You
are returned to the Reconcile window.
5. Identify the first check that has cleared.
No sweat, right? Just find the first check or withdrawal listed on the
bank statement.
6. Mark the first cleared check as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Checks, Payments, and
Service Charges section of the Reconcile window; find the first check;
and then click it. You also can highlight it by pressing Tab and an arrow
key. Then press the spacebar. QuickBooks inserts a check mark to label
this transaction as cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
7. Record any missing but cleared checks.
If you can’t find a check or withdrawal in QuickBooks, guess what? —
you haven’t entered it in the register yet. Close or deactivate the
Reconcile window by clicking its Leave button or by activating another
window. Then display the Checking register, and enter the check or with-
drawal. To return to the Reconcile window, reopen or reactivate it. Or
you can just click Banking➪Write Checks, create the check right on top
of the Reconcile window, and then click Save & Close to return to the
Reconcile screen and carry on from where you left off.
8. Repeat Steps 5–7 for all withdrawals listed on the bank statement. 
These steps don’t take very long. Reconciling my account each month takes
me about two minutes. And I’m not joking or exaggerating. By two minutes, I
really mean two minutes.
257
Chapter 14: The Balancing Act

If the difference equals zero
After you mark all the cleared checks and deposits, the difference between
the Cleared Balance for the account and the bank statement’s Ending Balance
should equal zero. Notice that I said should, not will. Figure 14-2, fortunately,
shows a Reconcile window in which everything is hunky-dory. If the differ-
ence is small, look for small differences between the amount of the checks in
the register and the actual cleared checks on the bank statement. If you find a
discrepancy with a particular check, just click GOTO to go to the check and
change the amount. Click Save & Close to go right back to the Reconcile
screen.
If the difference does equal zero, you’re finished. Just click the Reconcile Now
button. QuickBooks displays a congratulatory message box telling you that
the reconciliation is complete. As a reward for being such a good boy or girl,
the message box asks you whether you want to print a free, all-expenses-paid
Summary or Full reconciliation report. Click Summary or Full, and click OK if
you want to print the report. Otherwise, just click OK.
258
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Why isn’t my opening balance the same 
as the one in QuickBooks?
An opening balance that isn’t the same as the
one shown in the Opening Balance text box can
mean a couple of things.
First, you may have mistakenly cleared a trans-
action the last time you reconciled. If you
cleared a transaction last month that didn’t go
through until this month, your opening balance
is wrong. Go back to the Checking register, and
start examining transactions. Each one that’s
cleared has a check mark next to it in the
narrow column between the Payment and
Deposit columns. If one of the checks that
appears on this month’s statement has a check
mark, you made a boo-boo last month. From the
Checking register, click the check mark to
remove it. You’re asked to confirm your actions.
The check now appears in the Reconcile
window.
The other reason why the opening balance can
be different is that a transaction that you
cleared in the past got changed. If you deleted
a transaction that occurred before this recon-
ciliation period, for example, it threw your bal-
ance off. Why? Because the transaction that
you deleted helped balance your account the
last time around, but now that transaction is
gone.
Whatever happens, don’t fret. If you can’t track
down the faulty transaction, you can just have
QuickBooks adjust the balance for you, which I
explain elsewhere in this chapter. If you fre-
quently find that your accounts don’t balance,
consider using the QuickBooks Audit Trail
report, which lists changes to the QuickBooks
data, when it’s time to reconcile your accounts.

Can’t decide whether to print the reconciliation report? Unless you’re a busi-
ness bookkeeper or an accountant who is reconciling a bank account for
someone else — your employer or a client, for example — you don’t need to
print the reconciliation report. All printing does is prove that you reconciled
the account. (Basically, this proof is the reason why you should print the
report if you’re a bookkeeper or an accountant. The person for whom you’re
reconciling the account will know that you did your job and will have a piece
of paper to come back to later with any questions.) Also, you can always
come back and print the report later, if necessary. QuickBooks saves the
Reconciliation reports under Reports, Banking, Previous Reconciliation. 
Now each deposit, withdrawal, and check that you just cleared is marked
with a check mark in your register. If you don’t believe me, open the register
and find out.
If the difference doesn’t equal zero
If the difference doesn’t equal zero, you have a problem. If you click the
Reconcile Now button, QuickBooks shows you the Reconcile Adjustment
dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-3. This dialog box tells you how unbalanced
your account is and asks whether you want to adjust your maladjusted
account.
Click the Return to Reconcile button if you want to go back to the Reconcile
window and start the search for the missing or incorrectly entered transaction.
If you want to force the two amounts to agree, click OK. Forcing the two
amounts to agree isn’t a very good idea. To do so, QuickBooks adds a cleared
transaction equal to the difference. (I talk about this transaction a little later
in the chapter.)
Postponing a reconciliation (by clicking the Leave Reconcile button) and not
choosing to adjust the bank account balance is usually the best approach,
because then you can locate and correct problems. (The next section con-
tains some ideas that can help you determine what the problem is.) Then you
can restart the reconciliation and finish your work. (You restart a reconcilia-
tion the same way that you originate one.)

Chapter 14: The Balancing Act

Eleven Things to Do If Your Non-Online
Account Doesn’t Balance
I want to give you some suggestions for reconciling an account when you’re
having problems. If you’re sitting in front of your computer, wringing your
hands, try the tips in this section:
 Make sure that you’re working with the right account. Sounds dumb,
doesn’t it? If you have several bank accounts, however, ending up in the
wrong account is darn easy. So go ahead and confirm, for example, that
you’re trying to reconcile your checking account at Mammoth
International Bank by using the Mammoth International Bank checking
account statement.
 Look for transactions that the bank has recorded but you haven’t. Go
through the bank statement, and make sure that you’ve recorded every
transaction that your bank has recorded. You can easily overlook cash-
machine withdrawals, special fees, or service charges (such as charges
for checks or your safe-deposit box), automatic withdrawals, direct
deposits, and so on.
If the difference is positive — that is, the bank thinks that you have less
money than you think that you should have — you may be missing a
withdrawal transaction. If the difference is negative, you may be missing
a deposit transaction.
 Look for reversed transactions. Here’s a tricky one: If you accidentally
enter a transaction backward — a deposit as a withdrawal or a with-
drawal as a deposit — your account doesn’t balance. And the error can
be difficult to find. The Reconcile window shows all the correct transac-
tions, but a transaction amount appears in the wrong list. (The amount
appears in the Deposits and Other Credits list when it belongs in the
Checks and Payments list, or vice versa.) The check that you wrote to
Acme Housewreckers for the demolition of your carport appears in the
Deposits and Other Credits list, for example.
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to half the difference. One handy
way to find the transaction that you entered backward — if you have only
one — is to look for a transaction that’s equal to half the irreconcilable
difference. If the difference is $200, for example, you may have entered a
$100 deposit as a withdrawal or a $100 withdrawal as a deposit.
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to the difference. While I’m on the
subject of explaining the difference by looking at individual transactions,
I’ll make an obvious point: If the difference between the bank’s records
and yours equals one of the transactions listed in your register, you may
have incorrectly marked the transaction as cleared or incorrectly left
the transaction unmarked (shown as uncleared). I don’t know. Maybe
that was too obvious. Naaaah.
260
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

 Check for transposed numbers. Transposed numbers occur when you
flip-flop digits in a number. For example, you enter $45.89 as $48.59.
These turkeys always cause headaches for accountants and book-
keepers. If you look at the numbers, detecting an error is often difficult
because the digits are the same. For example, when you compare a
check amount of $45.89 in your register with a check for $48.59 shown
on your bank statement, both check amounts show the same digits: 
4, 5, 8, and 9. They just show them in a different order.
Transposed numbers are tough to find, but here’s a trick that you can
try: Divide the difference shown in the Reconcile window by 9. If the
result is an even number of dollars or cents, chances are good that you
have a transposed number somewhere.
 Use the Locate Discrepancies button. Would you mind, terribly, taking a
peek back at Figure 14-1? The dialog box shown in that figure includes a
Locate Discrepancies button, which you can click to display another
dialog box that prints reports that may help you reconcile your account.
In particular, the dialog box lets you view a report of changes made to
previously cleared transactions (which would be pretty suspicious book-
keeping activity and would definitely foul up your reconciliation) and
also a report that lists transactions marked as cleared during previous
reconciliations (which might be interesting, because maybe you erro-
neously marked a transaction as cleared before it really was cleared).
 Have someone else look over your work. This idea may seem pretty
obvious, but I’m amazed by how often a second pair of eyes can find
something that I’ve been overlooking. Ask one of your co-workers or
employees (preferably that one person who always seems to have way
too much free time) to look over everything for you.
 Be on the lookout for multiple errors. If you find an error by using this
laundry list, and you still have a difference, start checking at the top of
the list again. You may discover, for example, after you find a transposed
number that you entered another transaction backward, or incorrectly
cleared or uncleared a transaction.
 Try again next month (and maybe the month after that). If the differ-
ence isn’t huge in relation to the size of your bank account, you may want
to wait until next month and attempt to reconcile your account again.
Before my carefree attitude puts you in a panic, consider the following
example: In January, you reconcile your account, and the difference is
$24.02. Then you reconcile the account in February, and the difference is
$24.02. You reconcile the account in March, and — surprise, surprise —
the difference is still $24.02. What’s going on here? Well, your starting
account balance was probably off by $24.02. (The more months you try
to reconcile your account and find that you’re always mysteriously
$24.02 off, the more likely that this type of error is to blame.) After the
second or third month, I think that having QuickBooks enter an adjust-
ing transaction of $24.02 is pretty reasonable so that your account bal-
ances. (In my opinion, this circumstance is the only one that merits your
adjusting an account to match the bank’s figure.)
261
Chapter 14: The Balancing Act

If you’ve successfully reconciled your account with QuickBooks before,
your work may not be at fault. The mistake may be (drum roll, please)
the bank’s! And in this case, you should do something else. . . .
 Get in your car, drive to the bank, and beg for help. As an alternative
to the preceding idea — which supposes that the bank’s statement is
correct and that your records are incorrect — I propose this idea: Ask
the bank to help you reconcile the account. Hint that you think the mis-
take is probably the bank’s, but in a very nice, cordial way. Smile a lot.
And one other thing: Be sure to ask about whatever product the bank is
currently advertising in the lobby (which encourages the staff to think
that you’re interested in that 180-month certificate of deposit, causing
them to be extra-nice to you).
In general, the bank’s record keeping is usually pretty darn good. I’ve
never had a problem either with my business or personal accounts. (I’ve
also been lucky enough to deal with big, well-run banks.) Nevertheless,
your bank quite possibly has made a mistake, so ask for help. Be sure to
ask for an explanation of any transactions that you discover only by
seeing them on your bank statement. By the way, you’ll probably pay for
this help.
Balancing an Online Bank Account
In a nutshell, you don’t actually reconcile your account with the bank when
you balance a bank account that you’ve set up for online banking. Every time
you send online payments or transfers to the bank, QuickBooks retrieves a
list of recent bank account transactions — essentially an online bank state-
ment. You can and should compare these statements with your own records.
To make this comparison, take the following steps:
1. Send your online banking transactions in the usual way.
I won’t repeat the discussion that I provide in Chapter 13; heck, you
know how to turn a few pages. But all you do is choose Banking➪Online
Banking Center or click the Online Banking icon on the Home screen,
click the Send button, and provide your PIN when prompted.
2. Double-click the bank statement item in the Items Received from
Financial Institution list.
This list appears at the very bottom of the Online Banking Center
window, so even though I’m not providing a figure, you’ll have no trouble

After you double-click the statement, QuickBooks displays the Match
Transactions window. The Match Transactions window is just a special
version of the register window. The top half of the window shows the
bank account with the traditional register window format. The bottom
half of the window provides a list of downloaded transactions that you
“match” with transactions already recorded in your register.
3. Add missing transactions.
To add transactions that your bank shows (such as banking service fees
or interest income) but are missing in your register, click the transaction
in the online transactions list and then click the Add to Register button.
QuickBooks partially records the transaction in the register. You need to
complete the recording — such as by adding the account and clicking
Record.
4. Match transactions.
QuickBooks attempts to match transactions in the online statement
(shown in the bottom half of the Match Transactions window) with
those you recorded for the bank account (shown in the top half of the
Match Transactions window). If QuickBooks matches a transaction, it
marks the online transaction as “match.” You can match a transaction
manually, however, by clicking the transaction in both the online trans-
actions list and the bank register and then clicking the Match button.
(To unmatch a transaction, duh, you click the Unmatch button.)
5. Click Done.
At the point when you’ve added any missing transactions and matched
all the transactions, you’re done. You’ve essentially reconciled the
account. Click the Done button. QuickBooks returns you to the Online
Banking Center window.

T
o find out whether your business is thriving or diving, you use 
the QuickBooks Reports feature. The different kinds of reports in
QuickBooks cover everything from cash flow to missing checks, not to men-
tion QuickReports. QuickReports are summary reports that you can get from
the information on forms, account registers, or lists by merely clicking the
mouse.
In this chapter, I tell you how to prepare reports, how to print them, and how
to customize reports for your special needs.
What Kinds of Reports 
Are There, Anyway?
If you run a small business, you don’t need all the reports that QuickBooks
offers, but many of these reports are extremely useful. Reports can show you
how healthy or unhealthy your business is, where your profits are, and where
you’re wasting time and squandering resources. 

To make sense of what might otherwise become mass confusion, QuickBooks
organizes all its reports in categories. You can see what all the categories are
by pulling down the Reports menu or by clicking the Report Center icon. The
names of the reports read a bit like public television documentary names,
don’t they? “Tonight, Joob Taylor explores the mazelike federal budget in
Budget Reports.” You select a report category to see a list of report names.
In Table 15-1, I describe reports by category and give a short description of
the major reports in each category. To get a thorough description of a partic-
ular report, go to the Help feature. To find out what a standard profit and loss
report does, for example, choose Help➪QuickBooks Help, and click the Index
tab. Type financial statements in the text box. Or, from the Reports Center,
select the type of report on the left; you see a list of the different reports
available on the right side, with a description of the information contained in
each one. To read the details about a topic, click that topic in the list.
Table 15-1
QuickBooks Report Categories
Report Category
Description
Company & Financial
These reports give you a bird’s-eye view of your com-
pany’s health and cash flow. They give you a snapshot of
your assets, liabilities, and equity, showing income,
expenses, and net profit or loss over time.
Customers & 
These accounts receivable reports are great for finding 
Receivables
out where you stand in regard to your customer invoices.
You can list unpaid invoices and group them in various
ways, including by customer, job, and aging status.
Sales
These reports show what you’ve sold and who your cus-
tomers are. You can see your sales by item, by customer,
or by sales representative.
Jobs, Time & Mileage
These reports let you see job and item profitability, com-
pare job estimates versus actual costs, view time
recorded on jobs and activities, and look at vehicle
mileage.
Vendors & Payables
These accounts payable reports tell you everything you
need to know about your unpaid bills. You can list bills in a
variety of ways, including by vendor and by aging status.
This category also includes a report for determining sales
tax liability.
266
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Report Category
Description
Purchases
These reports show from whom you bought, what you
bought, and how much you paid. You can list purchases
by item or by vendor. One handy report shows any out-
standing purchase orders.
Inventory
These reports help answer the ever-important question
“What items do I have in stock?” You can get an enormous
amount of detail from these reports. For example, you can
find out how many of an item you have on hand and how
many you have on order. You can group inventory by
vendor or by item. If you need price lists, you can print
them by using a special report from your QuickBooks file.
Employees & Payroll
These reports offer ways to track payroll or check your
payroll liability accounts. Believe me, these reports come
in handy.
Banking
These reports list checks and deposits.
Accountant & Taxes
These reports include income tax reports, journal and
general ledger reports, and a trial balance.
Budgets & Forecasts
These reports show you once and for all whether your
budgeting skills are realistic. You can view budgets by job,
by month, or by balance sheet account. Then you can
compare the budgets with actual income and expense
totals. (You need to have a budget already set up to use
this report — something I discuss in Chapter 12.)
List
These reports let you see your lists in detail. For example,
you can see the contacts, phone numbers, and addresses
on your Customer, Vendor, or Other Names lists. You also
can create a detailed report of your inventory.
Industry Specific
Some versions of QuickBooks also supply industry-
specific reports under the Industry Specific submenu
command. QuickBooks, at the time of this writing, pro-
vides industry-specific versions of QuickBooks for con-
tractors, manufacturers, wholesalers, professional
service firms, retailers, and nonprofit organizations.
If you’re not sure which report you need to create, you can use the Report
Center. Just choose Reports➪Report Center, select a report type from the list
along the left edge of the Report Center window (see Figure 15-1), and then
select a report from the list to preview that report.
267
Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs

Creating and Printing a Report
After you decide what report you need, all you have to do is select it from the
appropriate menu. To create a standard profit and loss report, for example,
choose Reports➪Company & Financial➪Profit & Loss Standard or select it
from the Reports Center.
Depending on how much data QuickBooks has to process, you may see a
Building Report box before the report appears on-screen in all its glory.
Figure 15-2 shows a standard profit and loss report, also called an income
statement.
If you see a Customize Report dialog box rather than a report, you can tell
QuickBooks to change this option. To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences and
then click the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left. Click the My
Preferences tab if you have one and it isn’t already selected; then remove the
check mark from the Prompt Me to Modify Report Options Before Opening a
Report check box.
Figure 15-1:
The Report
Center
window.

Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

You can’t see the entire on-screen version of a report unless your report is
very small (or your screen is monstrously large). Use the Page Up and Page
Down keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down, and use the Tab and
Shift+Tab keys to move left and right. Or, if you’re a mouse lover, you can use
the scroll bar.
To print a report, click the Print button at the top of the report. QuickBooks
displays the Print Reports dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-3. To accept the
given specifications, which are almost always fine, click the Print button.
You’ll never guess what happens next: QuickBooks prints the report!
The first time you print a report, QuickBooks displays a Printing Features
dialog box that explains a few things about the mechanics of choosing and
printing reports.
Before I forget, I want to tell you that you can select the File radio button in
the Print To panel to tell QuickBooks to save the report as a file instead of
printing it. You can then choose the file format: ASCII, Comma Delimited File,
or Tab Delimited File. You can use either delimited-file format if you want to
open the file later with a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. After
you click Print, use the Create Disk File dialog box to specify the filename and
storage location.

Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs

Another really popular option is to “print” your report to your desktop as a
PDF file that can be attached to an e-mail and sent to anyone you choose.
After sending, you can drag the file to your Recycle Bin. Anything that you
can print can be processed this way and e-mailed. Some documents in
QuickBooks, such as Invoices, have an icon that supports PDF e-mailing;
these documents are processed online through the Intuit servers. If you
“print” them to the desktop and send them manually, you use your own
e-mail server and send them as attachments. You need to have a PDF printer
driver installed on your computer to use this function. These can be down-
loaded online for free if you don’t have one already.
The Orientation settings tell QuickBooks how the report is supposed to
appear on the paper. The Page Range settings specify the pages that you want
to print. The Fit Report to Page(s) Wide check box enables you to shrink the
report so that it fits on the number of pages you specify. The purpose of the
Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box is pretty self-evident.
QuickBooks includes two page-break options for creating easier-to-read
reports:
 Mark the first check box (smart page breaks) to keep items that belong
in the same group on the same page.
 Mark the second check box to give each major group its own page.
You also can preview the report by clicking the Preview button.

Visiting the report dog-and-pony show
You can do some neat things with the reports you create. Here’s a quick run-
down of some of the most valuable tricks:
 QuickZooming mysterious figures: If you don’t understand where a
number in a report comes from, point to it with the mouse. As you point
to numbers, QuickBooks changes the mouse pointer to a magnifying
glass marked with a Z. Double-click the mouse to have QuickBooks dis-
play a list of all the transactions that make up that number.
This feature, called QuickZoom, is extremely handy for understanding
the figures that appear on reports. All you have to do is double-click any
mysterious-looking figure in a report. QuickBooks immediately tells you
exactly how it arrived at that figure.
 Sharing report data with Microsoft Excel: You can export report data to
an Excel spreadsheet by clicking the Export button in the report
window. QuickBooks displays the Export Report to Excel dialog box. You
can use this dialog box to specify whether you want to create a new
spreadsheet for the report data or whether you want to add the report
data to an existing spreadsheet.
Editing and rearranging reports
You may have noticed that when QuickBooks displays the report document
window, it also displays a row of buttons: Modify Report, Memorize, Print, 
E-Mail, Export, and so on (as you can see in Figure 15-2, if you look carefully).
Below this toolbar are some drop-down lists that have to do with dates, a
drop-down list called Columns, and a drop-down list called Sort By. (Not all
these list boxes are available in every report document window. I don’t know
why, really. Maybe just to keep you guessing.)
You don’t need to worry about these buttons and lists. Read through the dis-
cussion that follows only if you’re feeling comfortable, relaxed, and truly
mellow, okay?
Modifying
When you click the Modify Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify
Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-4. From this dialog box, you can
change the information displayed on a report and the way that information is
arranged (by using the Display tab), the data used to generate the report 
(by using the Filters tab), the header and footer information (by using, pre-
dictably, the Header/Footer tab), and the typeface and size of print used for a
report (by using the Fonts & Numbers tab).
271
Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs

Memorizing
If you do play around with the remaining buttons, you can save any custom
report specifications that you create. Just click the Memorize button.
QuickBooks displays the Memorize Report dialog box (as shown in Fig-
ure 15-5), which asks you to supply a name for the customized report and
assign the memorized report to a report group. After you name and assign
the customized report, QuickBooks lists it whenever you choose Reports➪
Memorized Reports and then click the report group. You can also access
Memorized Reports from the top of the Report Center screen. Whenever you
want to use your special report, all you need to do is select it from the list
and click the Report button.
QuickBooks memorizes the print orientation with the report, so if the print
orientation isn’t the way you want it for the report, you should first change it
by choosing File➪Printer Setup. Select the orientation you want to memorize,
click OK, and then memorize the report.
Figure 15-5:
The
Memorize
Report
dialog box.
Figure 15-4:
The Modify
Report
dialog box.
272
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

E-mailing
If you click the E-Mail button, QuickBooks displays the Edit E-Mail
Information box. It lets you e-mail a PDF version of the report to someone
else. All you need to know is the receiving person’s e-mail address.
Exporting
If you click the Export button, QuickBooks displays the Export Report dialog
box (see Figure 15-6). You can use this dialog box to create an Excel report
that holds the same information as shown in the report. (To do this, just
press Enter when you see the Export Report dialog box.) You can also get
fancier in your exporting by exporting a comma-separated-values file (these
files can be opened by other electronic spreadsheet programs and by data-
base programs), by exporting to a specific Excel workbook file, and by using
the Advanced tab to control how the exported information is formatted.
A friendly suggestion, perhaps? Feel free to experiment with all the special
exporting options. Just remember that after you export a QuickBooks report
to a new, blank Excel workbook, you can also do any of this fancy-dancey
stuff — special formatting and so on — there.
The other buttons and boxes
If you want to see how the Hide Header, Collapse, and Dates stuff work, just
noodle around. You can’t hurt anything.

If you change the report dates, click the Refresh button to update the report.
(To set refresh options for reports, choose Edit➪Preferences. Then click the
Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left, and click the My Preferences tab
if necessary. Click one of the Reports and Graphs options, and click OK.)
Reports Made to Order
If you intend to print a large number of reports — and, more important, if you
intend to print a large number of reports and show them to customers,
investors, and other significant people — you want your reports to look good
and to be easy to understand. I believe that beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, so I’m not going to get into the aesthetics of report layouts. What I
am going to do is explain how you can make QuickBooks reports look exactly
the way you want them to look.
Choose Edit➪Preferences. Click the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the
left and then click the Company Preferences tab to see the Preferences dialog
box, as shown in Figure 15-7, for reports and graphs.
You need to be logged in to single-user mode as the administrator to change
company preferences. Read how in Appendix C.
Here are your options:
 Accrual: Accrual is one of those cruel accounting terms that are hard to
understand at first. If you choose Accrual in the Summary Reports Basis
panel, you tell QuickBooks to include all your transactions, sales, pur-
chases, expenses, and so on, from the moment they’re recorded, not
from the time you receive or pay cash for them.
Figure 15-7:
The
Preferences
dialog box
for reports
and graphs.
274
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Accountants follow the accrual method because it gives a more accurate
picture of profits. Also, the Internal Revenue Service says that big corpo-
rations must use accrual accounting for their tax returns.
 Cash: If you choose Cash, all the financial transactions in your reports
are dated from the time you make your expense payments and you
receive your customers’ payments.
 Age from Due Date: If you select the Age from Due Date radio button in
the Aging Reports panel, QuickBooks counts your expenses and invoices
from the day that they fall due. Otherwise, QuickBooks counts them
from the day they’re recorded.
 Reports – Show Account By: You select a radio button in the Reports
Show By button group to indicate how you want QuickBooks to arrange
account information on your reports: by name, by description, or by
both name and description.
 Statement of Cash Flows: You click the Classify Cash button to tell
QuickBooks how it should handle its accounts when it produces a 
picture-perfect statement of cash flows using generally accepted
accounting principles. A suggestion? Leave this for your CPA.
 Format: Click the Format button if you want to improve the look of your
reports. In the Report Format Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure
15-8, you can use the Header/Footer tab to choose preferences for dis-
playing the company name, the report title, the subtitle, and so on.
You can use the Fonts & Numbers tab to choose preferences for display-
ing numbers, decimal fractions, and negative numbers. You also can fool
around with different fonts and point sizes for labels, column headings,
titles, and other things in your reports.
Figure 15-8:
The Report
Format
Preferences
dialog box.
275
Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs

Click the Revert button in the Report Format Preferences dialog box to undo
your customization changes.
Processing Multiple Reports
Want to print several reports at once? No problem. Choose Reports➪Process
Multiple Reports. When QuickBooks displays the Process Multiple Reports
dialog box, shown in Figure 15-9, select the reports that you want to print or
display.
Last but Not Least: The QuickReport
The last kind of report is the QuickReport, which is one of the best kinds of
reports, so I saved it for last. You can generate a QuickReport from a list,
from invoices and bills with names of people or items on them, and from
account registers. QuickReports are especially useful when you’re studying a
list and see something that momentarily baffles you. Simply make sure that
the item you’re curious about is highlighted, click the Reports button, and
choose the QuickReports command for the item from the drop-down list.
You can also right-click an item and choose the shortcut menu’s QuickReport
option to create a QuickReport of the item.
Figure 15-10 shows a QuickReport produced from a Checking register. I
clicked the QuickReport button to display this Register QuickReport window
with the transaction information for a vendor: the fictitious Little Bertha’s
Workshop.

The QuickReport option is also on the Reports menu. You can display a
QuickReport from a form — even though no QuickReport button appears — by
choosing the menu option. For example, if you’re writing a check to a vendor,
you can enter the company’s name on the check and choose Reports➪
QuickReport to see a report of transactions involving the company.

and Tracking
In This Chapter
 Turning on job costing and setting up jobs
 Creating estimates and estimate-based invoices
 Charging for time and out-of-pocket expenses
 Comparing budgeted, estimated, and actual job information
QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier have a feature that’s very inter-
esting for businesspeople — such as contractors, consultants, engi-
neers, and architects — who do jobs or projects for their customers.
QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier have the capability to do simple
project or job costing. This capability means that your business can create
project or job estimates, track costs by project or job, and bill invoices 
by project or job.
In this short chapter, I describe the QuickBooks job costing feature.
Turning On Job Costing
To turn on the job costing or estimating feature in QuickBooks, choose
Edit➪Preferences. Click the Jobs & Estimates icon on the left; click the
Company Preferences tab (as shown in Figure 16-1); and then use the Do You
Create Estimates? and Do You Do Progress Invoicing? radio buttons to tell
QuickBooks whether, in fact, you want to do these things. You get this, right?
You select the Yes radio button if you do and select the No radio button if
you don’t.

While you’re looking at the Company Preferences tab (shown in Figure 16-1),
let me also mention that as the figure shows, QuickBooks lets you categorize
jobs as falling into several different status categories: Pending, Awarded, In
Progress, Closed, and Not Awarded. As you might guess, you use these Job
Status descriptions to categorize your jobs.
Setting Up a Job
If you want to use QuickBooks job costing, your first step is to set up a job.
For example, if you’re a contractor, you can use QuickBooks to track the
invoices and costs of the remodeling jobs you do. You just need to set up a
job every time you get ready to bid on a project.
To set up a job, first set up a customer in the usual way. Then set up a job
also in the usual way. In Chapter 3, I describe how you do all this, so I won’t
repeat that information here. Just to save you time, however, all you need to
do is choose Lists➪Customer:Job List to tell QuickBooks that you want to set
up a job, select the customer for whom you might do a job, choose the Add
Job command from the Customer:Job pop-up menu (or New Customer & 
Job if you’re on the Customer Center screen), and fill out the window that
QuickBooks displays.
Creating a Job Estimate
In QuickBooks, job costing starts with an estimate. An estimate is just a 
list of the estimated costs you’ll incur for some job you’ll perform for some
customer.
Figure 16-1:
The
Company
Preferences
tab showing
Jobs &
Estimates

280
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Assuming that you’ve already created a job and have told QuickBooks that
you use estimates, here are the steps that you follow to create an estimate:
1. Choose Customers➪Create Estimates.
QuickBooks opens a Create Estimates form (see Figure 16-2), which
bears an uncanny resemblance to the Create Invoices form that you’ve
seen if you’ve worked with QuickBooks at all. (See Chapter 4 for more
information about the Create Invoices form.)
2. Start filling in the blanks.
Choose the appropriate Customer:Job from the drop-down list at the top
of the form. QuickBooks Pro automatically fills in as much information
as it can — usually at least the Name/Address box — on the form.
If you configured QuickBooks to track classes, the appropriate drop-
down list shows up in the top center of the form. Go ahead and use the
box, if appropriate.
Feel free to change the default settings — the Date and Estimate #, for
example. The Date Setting tricks that you can find in Chapter 4 and on
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book may come in handy here.
Figure 16-2:
The Create
Estimates
window.
281
Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking

3. Add the line items — details, details, details.
You fill in the details of a Create Estimates window in the same way that you
fill in the details of a Create Invoices window. Refer to Chapter 4 if you have
questions.
One field that is unique to the Create Estimates window is Markup. The
Markup field adds a specified percentage of the line item price total. In
Figure 16-2, I specified the markup percentages as zero, so the Amount
column values match the Total column values. However, if I had speci-
fied a 50% markup using the Markup column, the values shown in the
Total column would all be 50% greater.
In Chapter 3, I describe how to add items to the QuickBooks Items list.
Each line item that you want to include on your job estimate needs to 
be described in the Items list. Note that because you often sell work to
clients and customers by using, in part, an estimate, you’ll typically want
to include full descriptions of the items. (My construction-contractor
clients, for example, often use several lines of descriptive text to fully
explain each item that shows on the estimate.)
4. Add any optional information.
If you want to, use any of the other boxes available in the Create
Estimates window to collect and store additional information. For exam-
ple, just as with the Create Invoices window, you can click the Customer
Message drop-down list and select or write a friendly message.
You can also use the Memo field to write a note to yourself regarding the
job, if you like. Or maybe add some notes about the screenplay that
you’ve been thinking about pitching to the studios. Whatever suits your
fancy.
If you want to include other items in the Create Estimates window, you can
customize that window. Choose Customize from the Template drop-down list
in the upper-right corner of the Create Estimates window. QuickBooks gives
you a list of your estimate forms. Choose the one you want to edit. (You may
have only one estimate form on the list if you’ve never created a new one.)
Click either the New or Edit button. If you click New, QuickBooks displays the
Customize Estimate dialog box.
In Chapter 4, I talk a bit about how to customize invoice forms. You may want
to look there if you have questions about how to customize the Create
Invoices form.
Before you print that estimate, remember that the Create Estimates window
isn’t the same information that appears on the written estimate. To see how
the printed version looks, click the down arrow beside the Print button in the
Create Estimates window, and choose Preview from the drop-down list. The
result is a full-page image, shrunk to fit on-screen.
282
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

If you haven’t saved your estimate yet, go ahead and click either the Save &
New or the Save & Close button.
To examine the estimate (or any on-screen QuickBooks form) more closely,
either click the Zoom In button at the top of the Print Preview screen or move
the mouse cursor over the image. When the cursor looks like a magnifying
glass with a plus sign in it, click the left mouse button. Because you can see
only part of the preview this way, use the scroll bars at the bottom and right
of the windows to move around to the different areas.
Note that the magnifying glass now has a minus sign in it, and the Zoom In
button toggles to Zoom Out. If you complete more than one estimate, you can
use the Prev Page and Next Page buttons on the Print Preview screen to look
at other estimates. When you finish, click the Close button.
When you get back to the Create Estimates window, click the Print button;
QuickBooks Pro displays the Print One Estimate dialog box. Click Print to
print the estimate without any further ado.
If you haven’t used QuickBooks to print estimates before, you may need to
set up your printer for this task first. To do so, choose File➪Printer Setup,
and select Estimate from the Form Name drop-down list. Then specify the
printer settings that you want for printing estimates. (This process works the
same way as it does for printing other forms, such as invoices, as I describe
in Chapter 4.) Click OK when you’re done. The Print One Estimate dialog box
that QuickBooks displays after you click Print in the Create Estimates
window also works the same way as the Print One Invoice dialog box does.
Turn back to Chapter 4 if you need help with this dialog box.
Revising an Estimate
To revise an estimate, display the Create Estimates window, as described ear-
lier in this chapter. Then click the Previous button until you see the estimate.
Make your changes, and QuickBooks recalculates all the totals. Smile.
Imagine doing this task by hand — the recalculations, the looking up of
prices, the retyping, the inordinate amount of wasted time. Making these
changes automatically with QuickBooks doesn’t quite beat a hot dog with
sauerkraut in the park on a sunny day, but it’s pretty close.
You can keep only one estimate per job. After you click Save & New, any
changes that you make automatically take the place of the old estimate.
283
Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking

Turning an Estimate into an Invoice
You can easily turn the estimate into an invoice by following these steps:
1. On the Customer Center screen, select your customer; then, on the
right side of the screen, click Show Estimates.
QuickBooks shows you a list of the active estimates for the customer
you selected.
2. Double-click the estimate you want to work with.
The Create Estimates window opens (refer to Figure 16-2).
3. Click the Create Invoice button at the top of the window.
If you’ve indicated that you might progress-bill a customer or client,
QuickBooks displays a dialog box that asks whether you want to invoice
the entire estimate or just some portion of the estimate. Answer the
question by marking the appropriate option button. Then click OK.
QuickBooks creates an invoice based on your estimate (see Figure 16-3).
If you need to make any changes, you edit the invoice directly and click
OK to continue.

Invoices
window

284
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

4. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the resulting invoice.
The invoice that you see is a regular QuickBooks invoice, and you can
edit it the same way that you edit any invoice. Until you click Save &
New, the invoice isn’t recorded in your records.
5. After you make all your changes, click Save & New or Save & Close to
record the invoice.
If you want to print the invoice instead, you can click the Print button.
Comparing Estimated Item 
with Actual Item Amounts
In the preceding paragraphs, I describe how you can take an estimate 
and create an invoice by using that estimate as a starting point. I also say
that you can edit the numbers that come off the estimate. Now, here’s an
interesting job-costing point: QuickBooks prints reports — like the one in
Figure 16-4 — that let you compare the item estimates shown on the original
estimates with the actual billed items shown on invoices.
Figure 16-4:

To produce such a report, choose Report Center➪Jobs, Time & Mileage➪Item

estimated amounts with invoiced amounts. If you bid jobs by using estimates
but must invoice with actual numbers, such a report is a great way to see
how good a job you’re doing in your estimating.
Charging for Actual Time and Costs
If you’re going to charge the customer for actual costs, you need to track the
costs and time as you incur the charges for them. You assign the cost to the
job by entering the customer and job information into the Customer:Job
column that’s shown in the form window used to record a particular cost or
time charge. For example, if you use the Enter Bills window (see Chapter 6) to
record a bill for a particular job, you use the Customer:Job column to desig-
nate the job.
To charge a customer for costs or time that you’ve previously recorded,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Create Invoices to open the Create Invoices
window.
2. Change the name in the Customer:Job drop-down list to the proper
customer.
This step is easy: Activate the drop-down list, and choose the appropri-
ate customer and job. If you have assigned time or costs to this cus-
tomer, a screen pops up, asking you to click the Time/Costs button to
include the charges in your invoice.
3. Click the Time/Costs button.
QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. The
dialog box already shows the costs and time charges that you’ve previ-
ously assigned to this customer and job combination.
4. Select the billable time and costs that you want to add to the invoice.
Check the time charges and costs that you want to bill for. Note that the
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box provides different tabs for
Items, Expenses, and Mileage.
5. (Optional, Expenses only) Indicate the markup.
The Expenses tab has a couple of extra fields at the top of the tab to
indicate the Markup Amount or % and the Markup Account. If applica-
ble, fill in the fields with the appropriate information.
286
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

6. (Optional) Indicate whether you want the charges to appear as a
single item on the invoice.
If you want to avoid listing the gory details of the charges to your cus-
tomer, check the Print Selected Time and Costs As One Invoice Item
check box located in the bottom-left corner of the invoice.
7. Click OK.
After you have everything the way you want it, click OK. As if by 
magic — even if it was by your hard work and the sweat of your own
brow — the invoice appears.
8. (Optional) Add anything else you want to include on the invoice.
This invoice is a regular QuickBooks invoice, remember? You may want
to click the down arrow beside the Print button and choose Preview
from the drop-down list to make sure that only the job costs that you
want to appear do appear.
9. Click Save & New or Save & Close.
That’s how you record the invoice.
After you record the invoice, the job costs that have been billed are removed
from the Choose Billable Time and Costs window. You’re finished. Breathe
easier.
You can also track the amount of time that you or other employees spend on
clients or customers. To turn on time tracking, choose Edit➪Preferences,
scroll down to and click the Time Tracking icon, and then select the Time
Tracking Yes radio button. After you do this, you can track the time that you
spend on a client or customer by choosing Customers➪Time Tracking➪
Use Weekly Timesheet or Customers➪Time Tracking➪Time/Enter Single
Activity. Either command displays an easy-to-understand window that lets
you record time spent on a particular client or customer.
Tracking Job Costs
To see the costs assigned or allocated to a project, use the Job, Time &
Mileage Reports, which are available when you choose Reports➪Jobs, Time &
Mileage. You can experiment with the different reports to see which provides
the information in a format and at a level of detail that works best for you. For
example, if you’re invoicing customers by job and collecting cost data by cus-
tomer and job, you can produce great job-profitability reports that show what
you’ve made by job. Also note that you can budget amounts by customer and
job (using the same budgeting technique described in Chapter 12). If you do
the extra work of budgeting by customer job, you can also compare actual job
revenues and costs to budgeted job revenues and costs.

O
kay, you don’t need to worry about the data files that QuickBooks
stores your financial information in. Pretty much, QuickBooks does all
the dirty work. But that said, you do have a few housekeeping tasks to take
care of. In this chapter, I describe these chores and how to do them correctly
with minimal hassle.
Backing Up Is (Not That) Hard to Do
Sure, I can give you some tricky, technical examples of fancy backup strate-
gies, but they have no point here. You want to know the basics, right?
The guiding rule is that you back up anytime you work on something that you
wouldn’t want to redo. Some people think that a week’s worth of work is neg-
ligible, and others think that a month’s worth of work is negligible.
So here’s what I do to back up my files. I back up every week after I enter my
data for the week. Then I stick the disk (you might use any removable disk,
such as a Zip disk or writable CD) in my briefcase so that if something terri-
ble happens (like a meteor hitting my office building), I don’t lose both my
computer and the backup disk with the data. (I carry my briefcase around

with me — a sort of middle-age security blanket — so that it won’t get destroyed
in some after-hours disaster.)
Sounds like a pretty good system, huh? Actually, I admit that my strategy has
its problems:
 Because I’m backing up weekly, I might have to reenter as much as a
week’s worth of data if the computer crashes toward the end of the
week. In my case, I wouldn’t lose all that much work. However, if you’re
someone with heavy transaction volumes — if you prepare hundreds of
invoices or write hundreds of checks each week, for example — you
probably want to back up more frequently, perhaps every day.
 A second problem with my strategy is only remotely possible but still
worth mentioning: If something bad does happen to the QuickBooks files
stored on my computer’s hard drive as well as the files stored on the
backup floppy disk, CD-R, CD-RW, or Zip disk, I’ll be up the proverbial
creek without a paddle. (I should also note that a removable disk [espe-
cially a floppy] is far more likely to fail than a hard drive.) If this worst-
case scenario actually occurs, I’ll need to start over from scratch from
the beginning of the year.
Some people, who are religiously careful, circulate three sets of backup disks
to reduce the chance of this mishap. They also regularly move one copy off-
site, such as to a safe-deposit box. In this scenario, whenever you back up
your data, you overwrite the oldest set of backup disks.
Say you back up your data every week, and your hard drive not only crashes,
but also bursts into a ball of flames rising high into the night. To restore your
files, you use the most recent set of backups — one-week old, max. If some-
thing is wrong with those, you use the next-most-recent set — two weeks old.
If something is wrong with those, you use the last set — three weeks old. This
way, you have three chances to get a set that works — a nice bit of security
for the cost of a few extra disks or storage devices. 
If you can’t fit your backup QuickBooks file on a single floppy, and you want
to use floppy disks, you can back up across multiple floppies. The program
will ask for additional floppies as it needs them to complete the Backup
process.
Backing up the quick-and-dirty way
You’re busy. You don’t have time to fool around. You just want to do a pass-
able job of backing up, and you’ve decided how often you plan to do it. Sound
like your situation? Then follow these steps:
290
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

1. Insert a blank disk/disc into the appropriate drive.
You can back up to any removable disk, including flash memory devices,
floppy disks, Zip disks, and writable CDs. However, note that Intuit, the
maker of QuickBooks, now recommends that you not use the Quick-
Books backup command to move a backup file onto a CD. Instead, Intuit
recommends you back up the file onto your hard drive and then use the
Windows File Copy command to burn the file onto the disk. The new
“work-around” approach tends to solve some of the CD-writing problems
people experience when backing up directly to a CD.
Heck, I should admit that you can back up to any fixed disk, such as
your hard drive or a network disk, but the advantage of a removable disk
is that you can store it in some other location. As a compromise, you
can also use a network disk. You typically don’t want to use your hard
drive (although this is better than nothing) because one of the disasters
that might befall your QuickBooks data is a hard drive failure.
You can also back up your QuickBooks files to an online storage area.
See the sidebar “Backing up files online” for more information.
2. If you store data for more than one company, make sure that the com-
pany whose data you want to back up is the active company.
Yes, I know that all your companies are active; I’m hoping they’re not
dead in the water. My point is that you want to back up the right com-
pany. To find out whether the right company is active, just look at the
QuickBooks application window’s title bar, which names the active com-
pany. (If you don’t remember setting up multiple files, don’t worry. You
probably have only one file — the usual case.)
3. Choose File➪Save Copy or Back Up to begin the backup operation.
QuickBooks displays the first Backup Wizard dialog box, as shown in
Figure 17-1.
Figure 17-1:
The first
Backup
Wizard
dialog box.
291
Chapter 17: File Management Tips

If you use QuickBooks in multi-user mode, you need to switch to single-
user mode before you back up your file. For more information on how to
make this switch, see Appendix C.
4. Tell QuickBooks that you want to back up the QuickBooks data file.
When QuickBooks displays the first Backup Wizard dialog box — the
one shown in Figure 17-1 — select the Save A Backup Copy button and
then click Next. QuickBooks displays the second Backup Wizard dialog
box (not shown) that asks you to specify the location for the backup. 
5. Indicate whether you want to backup on a local storage device or
online.
To backup your QuickBooks file locally — this is my recommendation
but do see the sidebar that follows — select the Local Backup option. 
6. Describe how QuickBooks should back up your data file.
With the second Backup Wizard dialog box displayed, click the Options
button. QuickBooks displays the Options dialog box (see Figure 17-2).
You will use the Options dialog box to specify how and when Quick-
Books backs up your data file:
Specify the backup reminder rule: You can check the Remind Me to
Back Up When Closing the Data File Every [X] Times box to tell Quick-
Books it should remind you every so often to back up. By default, Quick-
Books reminds you every fourth time you close a data file. But you can
replace the value in the text box to specify some other backup reminder
frequency. 
Figure 17-2:
The Options
dialog box.
292
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Select a data verification option: QuickBooks provides two data verifica-
tion options, which appear as option buttons on the Options dialog box
(refer to Figure 17-2). You can select the button that corresponds to the
data verification method you want: Complete Verify (which is safe but
slow), Quicker Verify (which is fast but not as thorough), and None (which
saves you a bit of time now at the risk of huge problems later on). The
Complete Verify option is what QuickBooks and I both recommend.
Pick a default location: You also need to specify where the backup file
should be located. You can do this either by entering the pathname of
the backup folder in the Default Backup Location box (the hard way) or
by clicking the Browse button and then using the Browse for Folder
dialog box that Windows displays to pick a default backup location.
Fine-tune the backup operation: The Options dialog box also provides a
couple of check boxes that you can use to fine-tune the old QuickBooks
backup operation. The Append Date and Timestamp to the Name of This
Backup File check box, if checked, does just what it says. The Limit the
Number of Copies to Keep to X tells QuickBooks to limit the number of
backup copies of your QuickBooks file it stores in the backup folder. The
default number of backup copies kept on hand is 3; that should be fine.
When you finish with the Options dialog box, click OK. QuickBooks
returns to the second Backup Wizard dialog box. 
7. Describe when QuickBooks should back up your data file.
To continue, you click Next. QuickBooks displays the third Backup
Wizard dialog box (see Figure 17-3). The third Backup Wizard dialog box
provides buttons you use to schedule when you want to back up. For
example, to indicate that you want to back up on the spot, you click the
Backup Now button. 
Figure 17-3:
The third
Backup
Wizard
dialog box.
293
Chapter 17: File Management Tips

8. Confirm the backup-file location and name.
With the third Backup Wizard dialog box displayed (see Figure 17-3), click
Next. QuickBooks displays the Back Up Company To dialog box (see Figure
17-4). If you successfully completed Step 6, you have already specified the
appropriate folder location for the backup file. But just to be on the safe
side, confirm that the filename and folder location shown in the Back Up
Company To dialog box is correct. If the folder location isn’t correct, select
a new folder location from the Save In drop-down list. If the filename isn’t
correct, edit the name shown in the File Name text box.
9. Click Save.
QuickBooks backs up your data file and displays a message box that
tells you it’s backed up your file. The message also gives the backup file-
name and folder location.
Getting back the QuickBooks 
data you’ve backed up
What happens if you lose all your QuickBooks data? First of all, I encourage
you to feel smug. Get a cup of coffee. Lean back in your chair. Gloat for a
couple of minutes. You, my friend, have no problem. You have followed
instructions.
Figure 17-4:
The Back Up
Company To
dialog box.
294
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Okay, you may have one or two problems, but you can probably blame PC
gremlins for those. If the disaster that caused you to lose your data also
trashed other parts of your computer, you may need to reinstall QuickBooks.
You also mat need to reinstall all your other software.
After you’ve gloated sufficiently (and pieced your computer back together
again if it was the cause of the disaster), carefully do the following to rein-
state your QuickBooks data:
1. Get your backup disk.
Find the backup disk you created, and carefully insert it into the appro-
priate disk drive.
2. Start QuickBooks, and choose File➪Open or Restore Company.
QuickBooks closes whatever company file you have open. QuickBooks
displays the Open Company: Type dialog box (see Figure 17-5).
3. Indicate that you want to restore a backup copy of your QuickBooks
data file.
How you do this is probably obvious, right? Select the option button
labeled Restore a Backup Copy (.QBB).
4. Tell QuickBooks whether you backed up locally or online.
Click Next to continue. QuickBooks displays the Restore Backup:
Method dialog box (not shown). Select the Local Backup button to indi-
cate that you made a local backup.
295
Chapter 17: File Management Tips
Backing up files online
You can quickly and easily back up your data
online. If you do so, you no longer need to
remember to make backups and take them off-
site. To find out more about online backup,
choose File➪Save a Copy of Backup; indicate
that you want to back up the QuickBooks data
file; and, when QuickBooks displays the second
Backup Wizard dialog box, click the Tell Me
More button.
The Online Backup service is a pretty darn good
idea if you have a fast Internet connection, but
the service does cost a little bit of money. You
pay at least $50 a year and as much as $150 a
year, depending on the level of service, but you
can set up the service so that QuickBooks auto-
matically backs up your data and even other
important files on a regular basis. I think this is
pretty cool.
Just for the record, I don’t think you need to
worry about security. You can read more about
the security measures at the QuickBooks Web
site, but your data is as secure online as it is in
your office.

5. Identify the backup file that you want to use.
Click Next to continue. QuickBooks displays the Open dialog box (see
Figure 17-6). If you know the company filename and location, you can
enter this information in the boxes provided. If you don’t know this
information, use the Look In drop-down list to identify the drive that
contains the file you want to back up. Then select the backup file you
want to restore, and click Open. QuickBooks displays the Restore
Backup: To Location dialog box (not shown).
6. Specify where the restored file will be located.
Figure 17-6:
The Open
dialog box.
Figure 17-5:
The Open
Company:
Type dialog
box.
296
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Click Next again. QuickBooks displays the Restore To dialog box (see
Figure 17-7). Use the File Name text box and Save In drop-down list in the
Restore To dialog box to identify the file you want to replace.
If you know the company filename and location, you can enter this infor-
mation in the boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, use
the Save In drop-down list to make sure that you place the restored file
in the correct folder on the correct drive.
7. Click the Save button.
If the file you’re trying to restore already exists, you see a message box
telling you so. Click Yes to overwrite and replace the file with the one
stored on the backup disk, or click No to keep the original copy.
QuickBooks may ask you for your password to verify that you have adminis-
trative permission to restore the file. Then, if everything goes okay, you see a
message box that says so. Breathe a deep sigh of relief, and give thanks.
Oops. I almost forgot:
 When you restore a file, you replace the current version of the file with
the backup version stored on the floppy disk. Don’t restore a file for fun.
Restore a file only if the current version is trashed and you want to start
over by using the version stored on the backup disk.
 You need to reenter everything you entered since you made the backup
copy. I know. You’re bummed out. Hopefully, it hasn’t been all that long
since you backed up.

To dialog
box.

Chapter 17: File Management Tips

Accountant’s Review
Hey. While I’m on the subject of the housecleaning stuff that you can do with
your QuickBooks files, let me mention the Accountant’s Review feature.
Accountant’s Review allows your accountant to make adjustments in a spe-
cial copy of your QuickBooks data file while you continue to enter your daily
transactions in the master file. When your accountant returns the updated
file, you can merge the changes back into the master file.
To use Accountant’s Review, choose File➪Save Copy or Backup. Select the
Create a File to Send to Your Accountant option and then follow the on-
screen instructions. You will be able to import the accountant’s changes later.
If you need help with this feature, you should talk to your accountant.
You should never upgrade to a newer version of QuickBooks while your accoun-
tant is still working with the accountant’s copy. Or at least you shouldn’t do this
if you plan on using the accountant’s changes. If an active accountant’s copy is
in use, your screen will state that at the very top, next to the company name. 
Working with Portable Files
QuickBooks 2007 includes a portable-files feature. A portable file is a smaller,
condensed version of the QuickBooks data file. The portable file is small
enough, in fact, that you can probably e-mail it to your accountant, your
sister in Portland, or me.
To create a portable file, choose File➪Save Copy or Backup. When Quick-
Books displays the first Backup Wizard dialog box (refer to Figure 17-1),
select the Create a Portable File button, click Next, and then follow the on-
screen instructions. The process, by the way, resembles the backup process
described earlier in this chapter. I find it really easy to save the file on the
desktop. Then you can attach it easily to your e-mail and send it out. After
the other party receives the file, you can just drag your copy to the Recycle
Bin. Your real file remains intact. 
To open a portable file, a person (this could be your accountant, your sister
in Portland, or me) should choose File➪Open or Restore Company . When
QuickBooks displays the Open Company: Type dialog box (see Figure 17-5),
this other person just specifies the file that he or she wants to open as a
portable file and then follows the on-screen instructions.
298
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Using an Audit Trail
For some curious reason, in the post-Enron world of accounting, people are
much more interested in the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature. In fact, some
readers of past editions of this book have tracked me down as though I were
a wounded animal so that they could ask about audit trails in QuickBooks.
Because of this renewed interest, let me share the three things you need to
know about using the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature:
 An audit trail is simply a list of changes. The QuickBooks Audit Trail —
which is a simple report that lists the changes to the QuickBooks data
file — lets you see who changed what.
 To turn on QuickBooks’ Audit Trail feature in old versions of Quick-
Books, you had to choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon,
click the Company Preferences tab, and then check the Use Audit Trail
check box. However, in QuickBooks 2006 and later versions, you don’t
have to turn on the Audit Trail feature. It’s always on, baby.
 You can print the Audit Trail report by choosing Reports➪Accountant &
Taxes➪Audit Trail.
Using a Closing Password
QuickBooks doesn’t require you to or even let you “close” months and years,
the way old manual accounting systems did. (When you “closed” an old
accounting period, you actually zeroed out the revenue and expense accounts,
and transferred the net amount to the owner’s equity accounts.)
However, QuickBooks does let you use a closing date and password. The
closing date sort of prevents someone from entering transactions earlier than
the specified date. If you set a closing password, for example, someone needs
to supply that password before entering a transaction or changing a transac-
tion dated before the closing date. If you don’t set a closing password, some-
one trying to enter or change a transaction dated before the closing date is
warned, but he or she can still create or change the entry.
To set a closing date, choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon,
click the Company Preferences tab, and then enter the closing date (probably
the end of the most recently completed year) in the Date Through Which
Books Are Closed box. To use a closing password, click the Set Password
button, and use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to create the closing
password.

Chapter 18
Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
In This Chapter
 Discovering fixed assets accounting
 Finding out about fixed assets accounting in QuickBooks
 Setting up a Fixed Asset item list
 Tracking vehicle mileage
I
n this chapter, I cover two specialty topics of modest interest to a small
handful of business owners: how the QuickBooks Fixed Asset list works
and how the QuickBooks vehicle mileage tracking tool works.
Let me say at the outset that you may not need these tools. QuickBooks 
users commonly think the tools do more than they really do. But in some 
situations, business owners and accountants truly do find these two simple
tools helpful.
But you know what? I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the start.
What Is Fixed Assets Accounting?
So that you understand where the Fixed Asset list and vehicle mileage tracker
fit into the scheme of things, let me begin by defining the term fixed assets
and by explaining just what fixed asset accounting is.
The term fixed assets historically refers to assets that are fixed in place. For
example, a factory or building that is set into concrete is fixed. Likewise, a 20-
ton piece of machinery that is bolted into the floor is also fixed.
In the context of QuickBooks and its Fixed Asset list, fixed assets also include
items such as furniture, equipment, and vehicles — things that aren’t so
“fixed” but are assets that last a long time and that, therefore, a business
must depreciate.

Now that you know what fixed assets are — at least according to QuickBooks
2007 For Dummies — let me define the term fixed assets accounting. Fixed
assets accounting, I’m going to say, refers to three accounting tasks:
 Tracking your fixed assets’ costs, descriptions, and other relevant infor-
mation so that you can take proper care of your stuff.
 Calculating and recording fixed assets’ depreciation so that tax returns
and financial statements can be prepared.
 Calculating and recording the effect, including the gain or loss, stem-
ming from the disposal of fixed assets so that tax returns and financial
statements can be prepared.
Obviously, this fixed assets accounting stuff is important, but let me throw
you a curveball. I’m not sure you need to worry about this stuff.
Now, of course, you want to keep track of fixed assets so that you know 
what you own. This stuff-you-own information is pretty essential for thinking
smartly about how much insurance you should purchase, for example. You
may also pay property taxes on this stuff, so that’s another good reason to
really know what you have.
And ditto on your need to be able to depreciate your fixed assets and to keep
track of what happens when you sell a fixed asset. Shoot, you don’t have to
be in business more than about a year before you know that tax laws and gen-
erally accepted accounting principles say that you have to do this, regardless
of whether you want to.
But here’s my lazy-boy thinking. You know your accountant? The woman or
man who does your taxes? She or he is already keeping such a list to calcu-
late the correct amount of depreciation that you should enter onto your
income tax returns. This makes me wonder why you need to maintain a
second, duplicate list.
To me, you need to do the fixed assets accounting yourself in only two situations:
 Because you’ve got so much stuff that your poor accountant needs or
would benefit from help in tracking the stuff: This will be the case if
you have hundreds or thousands of items.
 Because you don’t use an outside accountant: You, therefore, are your-
self the poor sap who has to do this fixed accounting work.
302
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

Hopefully, most readers will just be able to quit their reading at this point.
Most readers now realize that their accountants are almost certainly already
doing their fixed assets accounting work. Most readers, in fact, will realize
that they really don’t need to worry about noodling around with the Quick-
Books Fixed Asset item list at all!
However, be cautious here. Perhaps a quick telephone call to your accoun-
tant can confirm that your fixed assets accounting is already being per-
formed. Another way to check this is to look carefully at last year’s tax
return. Do you see, buried somewhere near the back of the return, a listing of
your fixed assets? If so, skip this chapter.
If you realize that you need to handle the fixed assets accounting yourself,
keep reading.
Fixed Assets Accounting in QuickBooks
Fixed assets accounting amounts to three things:
 Keeping a list of the assets that you own
 Recording depreciation on any depreciable assets
 Recording the disposal of an asset, including any gain or loss on disposal
The Fixed Asset list, which I describe in the next section, takes care of the
first task. But the Fixed Asset list doesn’t directly help you with the second or
third tasks shown in the preceding list. You need to understand this impor-
tant point. You still need to calculate and then enter asset depreciation your-
self. And when you dispose of an asset, you still need to construct a journal
entry that records the disposition.
Chapter 20 describes how depreciation works and how you go about record-
ing the disposal of an asset. Refer to that chapter if you want to know how
that stuff works.
Setting Up a Fixed Asset List
As noted earlier in the chapter, if your business owns a lot of stuff with long-
lasting value, either you or your accountant needs to keep track of the items.
If you need to track the items, you can do so by using the Fixed Asset item list.
303
Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists

Adding items to the Fixed Asset list
To add a piece of furniture, some bit of equipment or machinery, or another
item of long-lived value to the Fixed Asset list, follow these steps:
1. Display the Fixed Asset item list.
To display the Fixed Asset item list, choose Lists➪Fixed Asset Item.
QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window, as shown in
Figure 18-1. Initially, because you haven’t yet added any assets, the list
shows no assets.
Have assets you’ve already purchased? You can edit the original pur-
chase transaction and add the fixed asset to the list during editing.
2. Tell QuickBooks that you want to add an item to the Fixed Asset list.
Click the Item button, and choose New from the menu that QuickBooks dis-
plays. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown in Figure 18-2.
Figure 18-1:
The Fixed
Asset Item
List window.
304
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

3. Name the asset.
Give the asset a unique name. For example, you might give a piece of fur-
niture a name like Leather couch, a computer a name like HP Pavilion,
and a vehicle a name like ’02 Chevy S20 Pickup.
4. Select the appropriate fixed asset account.
From the Asset Account drop-down list, select the fixed asset account 
in which the asset you’re describing should be placed. A leather couch
used in your opulent reception area, for example, should probably be
placed in a furniture fixed asset account. A piece of machinery should
probably be placed in an equipment fixed asset account.
QuickBooks, as you might guess, supplies a bunch of accounts automati-
cally, but you may not see the account you need or want in the Asset
Account drop-down list. You can add a new asset account on the fly, so
to speak, by entering a new account name and pressing Enter. When
QuickBooks sees that the fixed asset account isn’t yet set up, it prompts
you to set up the new fixed asset account.
5. Describe the purchase terms.
Figure 18-2:
The New
Item
window.
305
Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists

Use the Purchase Information area to describe the item that you’ve 
purchased and the purchase terms. For example, you want to indicate
whether the item is new or used by marking the New or Used radio button.
You can provide a purchase description, purchase date, purchase cost, and
even identify the vendor by using the other, self-explanatory boxes in the
Purchase Information area.
6. (Optional) Describe the asset in further detail.
The Asset Information area at the bottom of the New Item window pro-
vides additional text boxes that you can use to describe the asset. The
area provides a humongous field in which to place a lengthy asset
description, for example. You also have fields you can use to identify 
the asset location, the original purchase order (PO) number, the asset’s
serial number, and the warranty expiration date. If these fields aren’t
adequate, heck, QuickBooks even supplies a Notes area that you can use
to write a small ode to your asset or record some other bit of relevant
asset information.
7. Save the asset item description.
You can click OK to simultaneously save the new asset item description
and close the New Item window. Alternatively, you can click Next to save
the new asset item description but leave the New Item window displayed.
Adding fixed asset items on the fly
You can add items to the Fixed Asset list as described in the preceding 
paragraphs. Alternatively, you can add an item to the Fixed Asset list when
you record the bill that records the vendor invoice for the asset or when you
record the check that pays the vendor invoice for the asset.
Here’s how this works: If you’ve told QuickBooks that you want to maintain a
Fixed Asset item list, QuickBooks prompts you to add a fixed asset item when
you categorize, or debit, a fixed asset account while entering a bill or record-
ing a check.
To collect the information required to set up the fixed asset item, QuickBooks
displays the same New Item window (refer to Figure 18-2). The steps that I
provide in the preceding section for filling in the New Item window also work
when adding fixed asset items on the fly.
Editing items on the Fixed Asset list
To edit a fixed asset item, follow these steps:
306
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

1. Choose Lists➪Fixed Asset Item
QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window (refer to 
Figure 18-1).
2. Double-click the item that you want to edit.
QuickBooks displays the Edit Item window, as shown in Figure 18-3.
3. Update the asset description.
As necessary, update the information shown in the Purchase Information
and the Asset Information areas. Note, too, that if you want to record the
disposal of an asset, you can select the Item Is Sold check box. Then
QuickBooks enables the Sales Information area’s text boxes. You can use
these to identify the sales date, price, and amount of selling expenses.
QuickBooks doesn’t do any bookkeeping with the purchase and/or sales
information shown on the New Item and Edit Item windows. For example,
QuickBooks doesn’t add an asset to the balance sheet because you set up a
fixed asset item. And QuickBooks won’t calculate the gain or loss on disposi-
tion of the asset because you enter sales information. You need to do that

yourself — or have your accountant do that — by using either standard
QuickBooks transactions or traditional journal entries. Refer to Chapter 6 for
information on how to record a bill that stems from a vendor invoice and to
Chapter 8 for information on how to record a check that pays for some asset.
Refer to Chapter 20 for instructions on how to record depreciation and how
to record asset dispositions.
Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks supplies a business vehicle mileage tracker that you can use to
track and tally business mileage. As you may already know, you need to know
both your total miles and your business miles in order to validly deduct vehi-
cle expenses on your tax return. (If you’re not sure about how this works, you
should probably confer with your tax advisor. I also have a little write-up that
explains how all this works, including how the notorious sport utility vehicle
tax loophole works, at my Web site, www.stephenlnelson.com.)
Identifying your vehicles
By law, you’re required to track your mileage by vehicle. QuickBooks, accord-
ingly, provides a Vehicle list. To add items to the Vehicle list, follow these steps:
1. To display the Vehicle list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile
Lists➪Vehicle List.
QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List window, as shown in Figure 18-4.
Initially, because you haven’t yet added any vehicles, the list shows no
assets.
2. Click the Vehicle button (bottom-left corner), and choose New from
the menu that QuickBooks displays.
QuickBooks displays the New Vehicle window, as shown in Figure 18-5.
3. Enter a name for the vehicle in the Vehicle text box, and enter a
description of the vehicle in the Description text box.
Identify the vehicle by its make and maybe the year of manufacture. I
suppose if you’ve got a fleet of cars or trucks, you may want to provide
more identifying information than this.
4. Save the vehicle description by clicking OK.

Recording vehicle miles
After you add your business vehicles to the Vehicle list, you record each trip
by using the Enter Vehicle Mileage window. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Display the Enter Vehicle Mileage window by choosing Company➪
Enter Vehicle Mileage.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Vehicle Mileage window, as shown in
Figure 18-6.
2. Select the vehicle in which you took the trip from the Vehicle drop-
down list.
3. Provide the starting and ending dates of the trip.
Enter the starting date of the trip in the Trip Start Date box and the
ending date of the trip in the Trip End Date box. Note that you can click
the little calendar button at the right end of these two boxes to display
the QuickBooks pop-up calendar.
Figure 18-6:

310
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 

4. Enter the starting mileage of the odometer into the Odometer Start box
and the ending mileage of the odometer into the Odometer End box.
After you enter the two mileage readings, QuickBooks calculates the
total trip miles.
5. (Optional) Identify the customer and job.
If the trip’s miles should be billed to or associated with a particular cus-
tomer or job, select the customer or job from the Customer:Job drop-
down list. For more information about how invoicing works, refer to
Chapter 4.
6. (Optional) Associate the trip miles with a particular invoice item.
If you bill the trip miles on an item, select from the Item drop-down list
the invoice item that should be used . For more information about how
invoice items work, refer to Chapter 4.
7. Provide additional information as necessary.
Use the Notes text box to collect or store any additional information
needed for the vehicle mileage record keeping.
8. Save the trip information by clicking Save & Close.
Using the vehicle reports
If you click the Reports button at the bottom of the Vehicle List window (refer
to Figure 18-4), QuickBooks displays a menu that lists four different vehicle
mileage reports: Mileage by Vehicle Summary, Mileage by Vehicle Detail,
Mileage by Job Summary, and Mileage by Job Detail.
You can get to another menu of commands that produce these same reports
by clicking the Mileage Reports button that appears at the top of the Enter
Vehicle Mileage window (refer to Figure 18-6).
To produce a particular vehicle mileage report, choose one of the reports
from either of these menus.
Updating vehicle mileage rates
If you click the Mileage Rates button at the top of the Enter Vehicle Mileage
window (refer to Figure 18-6), QuickBooks displays the Mileage Rates dialog
box (see Figure 18-7). The Mileage Rates dialog box lists IRS mileage rates and
their effective dates. You can enter a new mileage rate by clicking the next
311
Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists

open row of the mileage rate schedule and then entering the effective date
into the Effective Date column and the standard rate into the Rate column.
You can find the current year’s business mileage rate at the Internal Revenue
Service Web site at www.irs.gov.

I
f you run a business, and you use QuickBooks, you need to know the infor-
mation in this chapter. You can get this information by sitting down with
your certified public accountant over a cup of coffee at $175 an hour. Or you
can read this chapter.
Sign All Your Own Checks
I have nothing against your bookkeeper. In a small business, however, 
people — especially full-charge bookkeepers — can bamboozle you too 
darn easily. By signing all the checks yourself, you keep your fingers on the
pulse of your cash outflow.
Yeah, I know this practice can be a hassle. I know that you can’t easily spend
three months in Hawaii. I know that you have to wade through paperwork
every time you sign a stack of checks.
By the way, if you’re in a partnership, I think that you should have at least a
couple of the partners cosign checks.

Don’t Sign a Check the Wrong Way
If you sign many checks, you may be tempted to use a John Hancock–like 
signature. Although scrawling your name illegibly makes great sense when
you’re autographing baseballs, don’t do it when you’re signing checks. A
clear signature, especially one with a sense of personal style, is distinctive. 
A wavy line with a cross and a couple of dots is really easy to forge.
Which leads me to my next tip. . . .
Review Canceled Checks before 
Your Bookkeeper Does
Be sure that you review your canceled checks before anybody else sees the
monthly bank statement.
This chapter isn’t about browbeating bookkeepers. But a business owner can
determine whether someone is forging signatures on checks only by being
the first to open the bank statement and by reviewing each of the canceled-
check signatures.
If you don’t examine the checks, unscrupulous employees — especially book-
keepers who can update the bank account records — can forge your signa-
ture with impunity. And they won’t get caught if they never overdraw the
account.
I won’t continue this rant, but let me mention one last thing: Every time I
teach CPAs about how to better help their clients with QuickBooks, I hear
again and again about business owners who haven’t been careful about keep-
ing an eye on the bookkeeper — and have suffered embezzlement and forgery
as a result.
If you don’t follow these procedures, you, not the bank, will probably eat the
losses.
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Choose a Bookkeeper Who Is 
Familiar with Computers and 
Knows How to Do Payroll
Don’t worry. You don’t need to request an FBI background check.
In fact, if you use QuickBooks, you don’t need to hire people who are familiar
with small business accounting systems. Just find people who know how to
keep a checkbook and work with a computer. They shouldn’t have a problem
understanding QuickBooks.
Of course, you don’t want someone who just fell off the turnip truck. But even
if you do hire someone who rode into town on one, you’re not going to have
much trouble getting that person up to speed with QuickBooks.
A bookkeeper who knows double-entry bookkeeping is super-helpful. But to
be fair, such knowledge probably isn’t essential. I will say this, however:
When you’re hiring, find someone who knows how to do payroll — and not
just the federal payroll tax stuff (see Chapter 11), but also the state payroll
tax monkey business.
Choose an Appropriate 
Accounting System
When you use QuickBooks, you use either cash-basis accounting or accrual-
basis accounting. (I describe the difference between these two methods in
Appendix B.)
Cash-basis accounting is fine when a business’ cash inflow mirrors its sales
and its cash outflow mirrors its expenses. This situation isn’t the case, how-
ever, in many businesses. A contractor of single-family homes, for example,
may have cash coming in (by borrowing from banks) but may not make any
money. Alternatively, a pawnshop owner who lends money at 22 percent
might make scads of money, even if cash pours out of the business daily.
As a general rule, when you’re buying and selling inventory, accrual-basis
accounting works better than cash-basis accounting. However, cash-basis
accounting typically defers income taxes.
317
Chapter 19: (Almost) Ten Tips for Business Owners

If QuickBooks Doesn’t Work 
for Your Business
QuickBooks is a great small business accounting program. In fact, I’d even go
as far as to say that QuickBooks is probably the best small business account-
ing program available.
However, if QuickBooks doesn’t seem to fit your needs — if, for example, you
need a program that works better for a manufacturer or that includes some
special industry-specific feature — you may want one of the more compli-
cated (but also more powerful) small business accounting packages.
One possibility is another popular (and more powerful) full-featured
Windows accounting program: Peachtree Accounting for Windows from
Peachtree (www.peachtree.com). If that program doesn’t work, you may
want to talk to your accountant about industry-specific packages. (For exam-
ple, if you’re a commercial printer, some vendor may have developed a spe-
cial accounting package just for commercial printers.)
I’m amazed that PC accounting software remains so affordable. You can buy a
great accounting package — one that you can use to manage a $5 million or a
$25 million business — for a few hundred bucks. Accounting software is truly
one of the great bargains in life.
Keep Things Simple
Let me share one last comment about managing small business financial
affairs: Keep things as simple as possible. In fact, keep your business affairs
simple enough that you can easily tell whether you’re making money and
whether the business is healthy.
This advice may sound strange, but as a CPA, I’ve worked for some very
bright people who have built monstrously complex financial structures for
their businesses, including complicated leasing arrangements, labyrinthine
partnership and corporate structures, and sophisticated profit-sharing and
cost-sharing arrangements with other businesses.
I can only offer anecdotal evidence, of course, but I strongly believe that
these super-sophisticated financial arrangements don’t produce a profit
when you consider all the costs. What’s more, these super-sophisticated
arrangements almost always turn into management and record-keeping
headaches.

Tips for Handling (Almost) 
Ten Tricky Situations
In This Chapter
 Selling an asset

 Doing multiple-state accounting
 Obtaining and repaying loans
A
s your business grows and becomes more complex, your accounting
does, too. I can’t describe and discuss all the complexities you’ll
encounter, but I can give you some tips on handling (just about) ten tricky 
situations.
In QuickBooks, you make journal entries by using the General Journal Entry
window, which you get to by choosing Company➪Make Journal Entries. If you
don’t understand double-entry bookkeeping but would like to, take a gander
at Appendix B.
To track the depreciation of an asset that you’ve already purchased (and
added to the Chart of Accounts), you need two new accounts: a Fixed Asset
type of account called something like Accumulated Depreciation and an
Expense type account called something like Depreciation Expense.
If you have a large number of assets, keeping track of the accumulated depre-
ciation associated with specific assets is a good idea. You can do this either
outside QuickBooks (for example, in an Excel spreadsheet or with your tax
return) or inside QuickBooks (by using individual accounts for each asset’s
original cost and accumulated depreciation).

After you set up these two accounts, you can record the asset depreciation
with a journal entry, such as the following one that records $500 of deprecia-
tion expense:
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
$500
Accumulated depreciation
$500
The federal tax laws provide a special form of depreciation called Section 179
depreciation. Section 179 depreciation enables you to depreciate the entire
cost of some assets, which is a big break for small businesses. You can’t,
however, use more than a certain amount of Section 179 depreciation in a
year: $108,000 in 2006, for example. You also need to know some other nitty-
gritty details, so confer with your tax advisor if you have questions.
Selling an Asset
When you sell an asset, you need to back out (get rid of) the asset’s account
balance, record the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays you for the
asset, and record any difference between what you sell the asset for and its
value as a gain or loss.
If you purchase a piece of land for $5,000 but later resell it for $4,000, for
example, you use the following journal entry to record the sale of this asset:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loss
$1,000
Asset
$5,000
You may need to set up another income account for the gain or another
expense account for the loss. Refer to Chapter 2 for information on setting up
new accounts.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Selling a Depreciable Asset
Selling a depreciable asset works almost identically to selling an asset that
you haven’t been depreciating. When you sell the asset, you need to back out
(or get rid of) the asset’s account balance. You also need to back out the
asset’s accumulated depreciation (which is the only thing that’s different
from selling an asset that you haven’t been depreciating). You need to record
the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays you for the asset. Finally, you
count as a gain or a loss any difference between what you sell the asset for
and what its net-of-accumulated-depreciation (also known as book value) is.
This process sounds terribly complicated, but an example will help. Suppose
that you purchased a $5,000 piece of machinery and have accumulated $500 of
depreciation thus far. Consequently, the asset account shows a $5,000 debit bal-
ance, and the asset’s accumulated depreciation account shows a $500 credit
balance. Suppose also that you sell the machinery for $4,750 in cash.
To record the sale of this depreciable asset, you would use the following jour-
nal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,750
Accumulated depreciation
$500
Asset
$5,000
Gain
$250
As noted earlier in the chapter, if you have a bunch of assets, you probably
want to set up individual accounts for each asset’s original cost and its accu-
mulated depreciation. The individual accounts make it much easier to make
the journal entry shown in the preceding paragraph. Also, be sure to record
the amount of that asset’s depreciation for the year of the sale before you
make the entry for the sale itself. 
Owner’s Equity in a Sole Proprietorship
Actually, tracking owner’s equity in a sole proprietorship is easy. You can 
use the single account that QuickBooks sets up for you, called Opening Bal
Equity, to track what you’ve invested in the business. (You might want to
rename this account something like Contributed Capital.)
321
Chapter 20: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations

To track the money you withdraw from the business, you can set up and use
a new owner’s equity account called something like Owner’s Draws. Table 20-1
gives an example of owner’s equity accounts in a sole proprietorship. Note
that the numbers inside parentheses are negative values.

Owner’s Equity in a Partnership
To track the equity for each partner in a partnership, you need to create
three accounts for each partner: one for the partner’s contributed capital,
one for the partner’s draws, and one for the partner’s share of the distributed
income.
Amounts that a partner withdraws, of course, get tracked with the partner’s
draws account.
The partner’s share of the partnership’s profits gets allocated to the partner’s
profit share account. (Your partnership agreement, by the way, should say
how the partnership income is distributed between the partners.) Table 20-2
gives an example of owner’s equity accounts in a partnership.

Owner’s Equity in a Corporation
Yikes! Accounting for the owner’s equity in a corporation can get mighty
tricky mighty fast. In fact, I don’t mind telling you that college accounting
textbooks often use several chapters to describe all the ins and outs of cor-
poration owner’s equity accounting.
As long as you keep things simple, however, you can probably use three or
four accounts for your owner’s equity:
 A capital stock par value account, for which you get the par value
amount by multiplying the par value per share by the number of shares
issued. The par value of the stock is written on the face of the actual stock
certificate, and it is stated in the corporate Articles of Incorporation.
 A paid-in capital in excess of par value account for the amount
investors paid for shares of stock in excess of par value. You get this
amount by multiplying the price paid per share less the par value per
share by the number of shares issued.
 A retained earnings account to track the business profits left invested
in the business.
 A dividends paid account to track the amounts distributed to share-
holders in the current year.
Table 20-3 shows an example of owner’s equity accounts in a corporation.

Chapter 20: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations

Multiple-State Accounting
For multiple-state accounting, you can either use classes to track sales in
each state or set up a chart of accounts that includes a complete set of
income and expense accounts (and, if necessary, a complete set of asset and
liability accounts) for each state. After you set up this chart of accounts, all
you have to do is use the correct state’s income and expense accounts to
record transactions.
If you do business in both Washington and Oregon, for example, you record
sales in Oregon as Oregon sales and sales in Washington as Washington sales.
You would treat other income accounts and all your expense accounts the
same way. If you use class tracking for sales in different states, you don’t
need duplicate accounts for each state.
Getting a Loan
Getting a loan is the hard part. After you get the money, recording it in
QuickBooks is easy. All you do is record a journal entry that increases cash
and that recognizes the new loan liability. For example, if you get a $5,000
loan, you might record the following journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$5,000
Loan payable
$5,000
You’ll already have a cash account set up, but you may need to set up a new
liability account to track the loan. 
Repaying a Loan
To record loan payments, you need to split each payment between two
accounts: the interest expense account and the loan payable account.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Suppose that you’re making $75-a-month payments on a $5,000 loan. Also
suppose that the lender charges 1 percent interest each month. The following
journal entry records the first month’s loan payment:
Debit
Credit
Explanation
Interest expense
$50
Calculated as 1 percent of
$5,000
Loan payable
$25
The amount left over and
applied to principal
Cash
$75
The total payment amount
The next month, of course, the loan balance is slightly less (because you
made a $25 dent in the loan principal, as shown in the preceding loan pay-
ment journal entry). The following journal entry records the second month’s
loan payment:
Debit
Credit
Explanation
Interest expense
$49.75
Calculated as 1 percent of
$4,975, the new loan balance
Loan payable
$25.25
The amount left over and
applied to principal
Cash
$75.00
The total payment amount
Get the lender to provide you an amortization schedule that shows the break-
down of each payment into interest expense and loan principal reduction. If
this doesn’t work, choose Banking➪Loan Manager. QuickBooks displays the
Loan Manager window. If you click the Add a Loan button, QuickBooks col-
lects a bit of information about the loan terms and builds an amortization
schedule for you. Note, too, that you can tell QuickBooks to remind you of
upcoming loan payments and even to schedule the payments.
You can record loan payments by using either the Write Checks window or
the Enter Bills window. Just use the Expenses tab to specify the interest
expense account and the loan liability account.

have some good news and some bad news for you. The good news is that
you can use some powerful formulas to better your chances of business
success and increase your profits. No, I’m not joking. These formulas do
exist. You can and should use them. And in the pages that follow, I explain the
formulas and how to use them.
Now for the bad news: To use these formulas, you need to feel comfortable
with a bit of arithmetic. You don’t need to be a serious mathematician or any-
thing, but you do need to feel comfortable with percentages and calculators.
By the way, you can use the standard Windows Calculator accessory, avail-
able from within QuickBooks, to calculate any of the secret formulas.
Even if you’re not particularly fond of (or all that good at) math, I want to
encourage you to skim this chapter. You can pick up some weird insights into
the world of finance.

The First “Most Expensive Money 
You Can Borrow” Formula
Here’s something you may not know: The most expensive money that you
can borrow is from vendors who offer cash or early payment discounts that
you don’t take. For example, perhaps your friendly office supply store offers a
2 percent discount if you pay cash at the time of purchase instead of paying
within the usual 30 days. You don’t pay cash, so you pay the full amount
(which is 2 percent more than the cash amount) 30 days later. In effect, you
pay a 2 percent monthly interest charge. A 2 percent monthly interest charge
works out to a 24 percent annual interest charge, and that’s a great deal of
money.
Here’s another example that is only slightly more complicated. Many, many
vendors offer a 2 percent discount if you pay within the first 10 days that an
invoice is due rather than 30 days later. (These payment terms are often
described and printed at the bottom of the invoice as “2/10, Net 30.”)
In this case, you pay 2 percent more by paying 20 days later. (The 20 days later
is the difference between 10 days and 30 days.) Two percent for 20 days is
roughly equivalent to 3 percent for 30 days, or a month. So a 2 percent 20-day
interest charge works out to a 36 percent annual interest charge. And now
you’re talking serious money.
Table 21-1 shows how some common early payment discounts (including
cash discounts) translate into annual interest rates. By the way, I’ve been a
bit more precise in my calculations for this table, so these numbers vary
slightly from (and are larger than) those given in the preceding paragraph.
Table 21-1
Annual Interest Rates for Early Payment Discounts

96.05%
64.04%
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Is it just me, or do those numbers blow you away? The 2 percent for 20 days
early payment discount that you often see works out (if you do the math pre-
cisely) to more than 37 percent annual interest. Man, that hurts. And if you
don’t take a 5 percent for 20 days early payment discount when it’s offered,
you’re effectively borrowing money at an annual rate of 96 percent. You
didn’t read that last number wrong. Yes, a 5 percent for 20 days early pay-
ment discount works out to an annual interest rate of almost 100 percent.
I want to make a couple more observations, too. Turning down a 1 percent
discount for paying 30 days early isn’t actually a bad deal in many cases.
Look at Table 21-1. It shows that the 1 percent discount for paying 30 days
early is 12.29 percent. Sure, that rate is pretty high, but that interest rate is
less than for many credit cards, and it’s less than for some small business
credit lines. So if you would have to borrow money in some other way in
order to pay 30 days early, making an early payment might not be cost 
effective.
The bottom line on all this ranting is that early payment discounts, if not
taken, represent one of the truly expensive ways to borrow money. I’m not
saying that you won’t need to borrow money this way at times. I can guess
that your cash flow gets pretty tight sometimes (a circumstance that is true
in most businesses, as you probably know). I am saying, however, that you
should never skip taking an early payment discount unless borrowing money
at outrageous interest rates makes sense.
Oh, yes. The secret formula. To figure out the effective annual interest rate
that you pay by not taking an early payment discount, use this formula:
Discount % / (1 – Discount %) × (365 / Number of Days of Early Payment)
So to calculate the effective annual interest rate that you pay by not taking a
2 percent discount for paying 20 days early, calculate this formula:
.02 / (1 – .02) × (365 / 20)
Work out the math, and you get 0.3724, which is the same thing as a 37.24
percent interest rate. (Note that the discount percents are entered as their
equivalent decimal values.)

Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

The Second “Most Expensive Money 
You Can Borrow” Formula
You know that “most expensive money you can borrow” stuff that I talk about
in the preceding section? The very tragic flip side to that story occurs when
you offer your customers an early payment discount, and they take it. In
effect, you borrow money from your customers at the same outrageous inter-
est rates. For example, if customer Joe Schmoe gets a 2 percent early payment
discount for paying 20 days early, you, in effect, pay ol’ Joe roughly 2 percent
interest for a 20-day loan. Using the same formula I give for the first “most
expensive money you can borrow” formula, the rate works out to 37.24 percent.
In some industries, customers expect early payment discounts. You may have
to offer them, but you should never offer them willingly. You should never
offer them just for fun. Borrowing money this way is just too expensive. A
rate of 37.24 percent? Yikes!
Let me also offer a rather dour observation. In my experience, anytime some-
one offers big early payment discounts — I’ve seen them as big as 5 percent —
he’s either stupid or desperate, and probably both.
The “How Do I Break Even?” Formula
I know that you’re not interested in just breaking even. I know that you want
to make money in your business. But knowing what quantities you need to
sell just to cover your expenses is often super-helpful. If you’re a one-person
accounting firm (or some other service business), for example, how many
hours do you need to work to pay your expenses and perhaps pay yourself a
small salary? Or if you’re a retailer of, say, toys, how many toys do you need
to sell to pay your overhead, the rent, and sales clerks?
You see my point, right? Knowing how much revenue you need to generate
just to stay in the game is essential. Knowing your break-even point enables
you to establish a benchmark for your performance. (Any time you don’t
break even, you know that you have a serious problem that you need to
resolve quickly to stay in business.) And considering break-even points is
invaluable when you think about new businesses or new ventures.
As you ponder any new opportunity and its potential income and expenses,
you need to know how much income you need to generate just to pay those
expenses.
To calculate a break-even point, you need to know just three pieces of informa-
tion: your fixed costs (the expenses you have to pay regardless of the business’s
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

revenue, or income), the revenue that you generate for each sale, and the
variable costs that you incur in each sale. (These variable costs, which also
are called direct expenses, aren’t the same thing as the fixed costs.)
 Whatever you sell — be it thingamajigs, corporate jets, or hours of con-
sulting services — has a price. That price is your revenue per item input.
 Most of the time, what you sell has a cost, too. If you buy and resell
thingamajigs, those thingamajigs cost you some amount of money. The
total of your thingamajigs’ costs varies depending on how many thingama-
jigs you buy and sell, which is why these costs are referred to as variable
costs. A couple of examples of variable costs include hourly (or contract)
labor and shipping. Sometimes, the variable cost per item is zero, how-
ever. (If you’re a consultant, for example, you sell hours of your time. But
you may not pay an hourly cost just because you consult for an hour.)
 Your fixed costs are all those costs that you pay regardless of whether
you sell your product or service. For example, if you have to pay an
employee a salary regardless of whether you sell anything, that salary is
a fixed cost. Your rent is probably a fixed cost. Things like insurance and
legal and accounting expenses are probably also fixed costs because
they don’t vary with fluctuations in your revenue.
Fixed costs may change a bit from year to year or bounce around a bit
during a year. So maybe fixed isn’t a very good adjective. People use the
term fixed costs, however, to differentiate these costs from variable costs,
which are those costs that do vary with the number of goods you sell.
Take the book-writing business as an example. Suppose that as you read this
book, you think, “Man, that guy is having too much fun. Writing about account-
ing programs . . . working day in and day out with buggy beta software . . . yeah,
that would be the life.”
Further, suppose that for every book you write, you think that you can make
$5,000, but you’ll probably end up paying about $1,000 per book for such things
as long distance telephone charges, overnight courier charges, and extra
hardware and software. And suppose that you need to pay yourself a salary
of $20,000 a year. (In this scenario, your salary is your only fixed cost because
you plan to write at home at a small desk in your bedroom.) Table 21-2 shows
how the situation breaks down.

331
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

With these three bits of data, you can easily calculate how many books you
need to write to break even. Here’s the formula:
Fixed Costs / (Revenue – Variable Costs)
If you plug in the writing business example data, the formula looks like this:
$20,000 / ($5,000 – $1,000)
Work through the math, and you get 5. So you need to write (and get paid for)
five books a year to pay the $1,000 per book variable costs and your $20,000
salary. Just to prove that I didn’t make up this formula and that it really
works, Table 21-3 shows how things look if you write five books.
Table 21-3

Revenue

Five books at $5,000 each.

Fixed costs

A little food money, a little rent money, a little

Profits

Subtract the costs from the revenue, and
nothing is left.
Accountants use parentheses to show negative numbers. That’s why the
$5,000 and the $20,000 in Table 21-3 are in parentheses.
But back to the game. To break even in a book-writing business like the one
that I describe here, you need to write and sell five books a year. If you don’t
think that you can write and sell five books in a year, getting into the book-
writing business makes no sense.
Your business is probably more complicated than book writing, but the same
formula and logic for calculating your break-even point apply. You need just
three pieces of information: the revenue that you receive from the sale of a
single item, the variable costs of selling (and possibly making) the item, and
the fixed costs that you pay just to be in business.
QuickBooks doesn’t collect or present information in a way that enables you
to easily pull the revenue per item and variable costs per item off some report.
Neither does it provide a fixed-costs total on some report. However, if you
understand the logic of the preceding discussion, you can easily massage the
QuickBooks data to get the information you need.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The “You Can Grow Too Fast” Formula
Here’s a weird little paradox: One of the easiest ways for a small business to
fail is by being too successful. I know. It sounds crazy, but it’s true. In fact, I’ll
even go out on a limb and say that business success is by far the most
common reason that I see for business failure.
“Oh, geez,” you say. “This nut is talking in circles.”
Let me explain. Whether or not you realize it, you need a certain amount of
financial horsepower, or net worth, to do business. (Your net worth is just the
difference between your assets and your liabilities.) You need to have some
cash in the bank to tide you over the rough times that everybody has at least
occasionally. You probably need to have some office furniture and computers
so that you can take care of the business end of the business. And if you
make anything at all, you need to have adequate tools and machinery. This
part all makes sense, right?
How net worth relates to growth
Okay, now on to the next reality. If your business grows and continues to
grow, you need to increase your financial horsepower, or net worth. A bigger
business, for example, needs more cash to make it through the tough times
than a smaller business does — along with more office furniture and comput-
ers, and more tools and machinery. Oh, sure, you might be able to have one
growth spurt because you started with more financial horsepower (more net
worth) than you needed. But — and this is the key part — you can’t sustain
business growth without increasing your net worth. Now you may be saying
things like “No way, man. That doesn’t apply to me.” I assure you, my new
friend, that it does.
As long as your creditors will extend you additional credit as you grow your
business — and they should, as long as the business is profitable and you
don’t have cash flow problems — you can grow your business as fast as you
can grow your net worth. If you can grow your net worth by 5 percent a year,
your business can grow at an easily sustained rate of only 5 percent a year. If
you can grow your net worth by 50 percent a year, your business can grow at
an easily sustained rate of only (only?) 50 percent a year.
You grow your business’s net worth in only two ways:
 By reinvesting profits in the business. Note that any profits that you
leave in the business instead of drawing them out — such as through
dividends or draws — are reinvested.
333
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

 By getting people to invest money in the business. If you’re not in a
position to continually raise money from new investors — and most
small businesses aren’t — the only practical way to grow is by reinvest-
ing profits in the business.
Calculating sustainable growth
You can calculate the growth rate that your business can sustain by using
this formula:
Reinvested Profits / Net Worth
I should say, just for the record, that this formula is a very simple sustainable
growth formula. But even so, it offers some amazingly interesting insights. For
example, perhaps you’re a commercial printer doing $500,000 in revenue a
year with a business net worth of $100,000; your business earns $50,000 a
year, but you leave only $10,000 a year in the business. In other words, your
reinvested profits are $10,000. In this case, your sustainable growth is calcu-
lated as follows:
$10,000 / $100,000
Work out the numbers, and you get 0.1, or 10 percent. In other words, you
can grow your business by 10 percent a year (as long as you grow the net
worth by 10 percent a year by reinvesting profits). For example, you can
easily go from $500,000 to $550,000 to $605,000 and continue growing annu-
ally at this 10 percent rate, but your business can’t grow any faster than 10
percent a year. That is, you’ll get into serious trouble if you try to go from
$500,000 to $600,000 to $720,000 and continue growing at 20 percent a year.
You can convert a decimal value to a percentage by multiplying the value by
100. For example, 0.1 × 100 equals 10, so 0.1 equals 10 percent. You can con-
vert a percentage to a decimal value by dividing the value by 100. For exam-
ple, 25 (as in 25 percent) divided by 100 equals 0.25.
The sustainable-growth formula inputs are pretty easy to get after you have
QuickBooks up and running. You can get the net worth figure off the balance
sheet. You can calculate the reinvested profits by looking at the net income
and deducting any amounts that you pulled out of the business.
I’m not going to go through the mathematical proof of why this sustainable-
growth formula is true. My experience is that the formula makes intuitive
sense to people who think about it for a few minutes. If you aren’t into the
intuition thing or if you don’t believe me, get a college finance textbook, and
look up its discussion of the sustainable-growth formula. Or do what all the
kids today are doing — search online for “sustainable growth formula.”

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The First “What Happens If . . . ?”
Formula
One curiosity about small businesses is that small changes in revenue or
income can have huge impacts on profits. A retailer who cruises along at
$200,000 in revenue and struggles to live on $30,000 a year never realizes that
boosting the sales volume by 20 percent to $250,000 might increase profits by
200 percent to $60,000.
If you take only one point away from this discussion, it should be this curious
little truth: If fixed costs don’t change, small changes in revenue can produce
big changes in profits.
The following example shows how this point works and provides a secret for-
mula. For starters, say that you currently generate $100,000 a year in revenue
and make $20,000 a year in profits. The revenue per item sold is $100, and the
variable cost per item sold is $35. (In this case, the fixed costs happen to be
$45,000 a year, but that figure isn’t all that important to the analysis.)
Accountants like to whip up little tables that describe these sorts of things,
so Table 21-4 gives the current story on your imaginary business.
Table 21-4

Revenue

Fixed costs

All the little things: rent, your salary, 
and so on.
Profits

What’s left over.
Table 21-4 shows the current situation. But suppose that you want to know
what will happen to your profits if revenue increases by 20 percent but your
fixed costs don’t change. Mere mortals, not knowing what you and I know,
might assume that a 20 percent increase in revenue would produce an approx-
imate 20 percent increase in profits. But you know that small changes in 
revenue can produce big changes in profits, right?
335
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

To estimate exactly how a change in revenue affects profits, use the following
secret formula:
Percentage Change × Revenue × (1 – [Variable Cost per Item / Revenue
per Item])
Using the sample data provided in Table 21-4 (I’m sorry this example is start-
ing to resemble those story problems from eighth-grade math), you make the
following calculation:
0.20 × $100,000 × (1 – [35 / 100])
Work out the numbers, and you get 13,000. What does this figure mean? It
means that a 20 percent increase in revenue produces a $13,000 increase in
profits. As a percentage of profits, this $13,000 increase is 65 percent ($13,000
/ $20,000 = 65 percent).
Let me stop here and make a quick observation. In my experience, entrepre-
neurs always seem to think that they need to grow big to make big money.
They concentrate on doing things that will double or triple or quadruple
their sales. Their logic, though, isn’t always correct. If you can grow your
business without having to increase your fixed costs, small changes in rev-
enue can produce big changes in profits.
Before I stop talking about this first “What happens if . . . ?” formula, I want to
quickly describe where you get the inputs you need for the formula:
 The percentage-change input is just a number that you pick. If you want
to see what happens to your profits with a 25 percent increase in sales,
for example, use 0.25.
 The revenue input is your total revenue. You can get it from your profit
and loss statement. (In Chapter 15, I describe how you can create a
profit and loss statement by using QuickBooks.)
 The revenue per item sold and variable costs per item sold figures work
the same way as I describe for the break-even formula earlier in this
chapter.
The Second “What Happens If . . . ?”
Formula
Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this, but people in finance, like me, usually have a
prejudice against people in sales. And it’s not just because people who are
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

good at sales usually make more money than people who are good at finance.
It’s really not. Honest to goodness.
Here’s the prejudice: People in finance think that people in sales always want
to reduce prices.
People in sales see things a bit differently. They say, in effect, “Hey, you worry
too much. We’ll make up the difference in additional sales volume.” The argu-
ment is appealing: You just undercut your competitor’s prices by a healthy
chunk and make less on each sale. But because you sell your stuff so cheaply,
your customers will beat a path to your door.
Just for the record, I love people who are good at sales. I think that someone
who is good at sales is more important than someone who is good at finance.
But that painful admission aside, I have to tell you that I see a problem with
the “Cut the prices; we’ll make it up with volume” strategy. If you cut prices
by a given percentage — perhaps by 10 percent — you usually need a much
bigger percentage gain in revenue to break even.
The following example shows what I mean and how this strategy works.
Suppose that you have a business that sells some doohickey or thingamajig.
You generate $100,000 a year in revenue and make $20,000 a year in profits.
Your revenue per item, or doohickey, sold is $100, and your variable cost per
item, or doohickey, sold is $35. Your fixed costs happen to be $45,000 a year,
but again, the fixed costs aren’t all that important to the analysis. Table 21-5
summarizes the current situation.

Then business is particularly bad for one month. Joe-Bob, your sales guy,
comes to you and says, “Boss, I have an idea. I think that we can cut prices by
15 percent to $85 a doohickey and get a truly massive boost in sales.”
337
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

You’re a good boss. You’re a polite boss. Plus you’re intrigued. So you think a
bit. The idea has a certain appeal. You start wondering how much of an
increase in sales you need to break even on the price reduction.
You’re probably not surprised to read this, but I have another secret formula
that can help. You can use the following formula to calculate how many items
(doohickeys, in the example) you need to sell just to break even on the new,
discounted price. Here’s the formula:
(Current Profits + Fixed Costs) / (Revenue per Item – Variable Cost 
per Item)
Using the example data provided earlier, you make the following calculation:
($20,000 + $45,000) / ($85 – $35)
Work out the numbers, and you get 1,300. What does this figure mean? It
means that just to break even on the $85 doohickey price, Joe-Bob needs to
sell 1,300 doohickeys. Currently, per Table 21-3, Joe-Bob sells 1,000 doohick-
eys a year. As a percentage, then, this jump from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,300
doohickeys is exactly a 30 percent increase. (Remember that Joe-Bob pro-
poses a 15 percent price cut.)
Okay, I don’t know Joe-Bob. He may be a great guy. He may be a wonderful
salesperson. But here’s my guess: Joe-Bob isn’t thinking about a 30 percent
increase in sales volume. (Remember, with a 15 percent price reduction, you
need a 30 percent increase just to break even!) And Joe-Bob almost certainly
isn’t thinking about a 50 percent or 75 percent increase in sales volume —
which is what you need to make money on the whole deal, as shown in 
Table 21-6.
Table 21-6

In summary, you can’t reduce prices by, say, 15 percent and then go for some
penny-ante increase. You need huge increases in the sales volume to get big
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

increases in profits. If you look at Table 21-6, you can see that if you can increase
the sales from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,750 doohickeys — a 75 percent increase —
you can more than double the profits. This increase assumes that the fixed
costs stay level, as the table shows.
I want to describe quickly where you get the inputs that you need for the 
formula:
 The profit figure can come right off the QuickBooks profit and loss 
statement.
 The fixed costs figure just tallies all your fixed costs. (I talk about fixed
costs earlier in this chapter in “The ‘How Do I Break Even?’ Formula”
section.)
 The revenue per item is just the new price that you’re considering.
 Finally, the variable cost per item is the cost of the thing you sell. (I dis-
cuss this cost earlier in the chapter, too.)
Please don’t construe the preceding discussion as proof that you should
never listen to the Joe-Bobs of the world. The “cut prices to increase volume”
strategy can work wonderfully well. The trick, however, is to increase the
sales volume massively. Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart, used the
strategy and became, at one point, the richest man in the world.
The Economic Order Quantity 
(Isaac Newton) Formula
Isaac Newton invented differential calculus, a fact that is truly amazing to me.
I can’t imagine how someone could just figure out calculus. I could never, in a
hundred years, figure it out. But I’m getting off track.
The neat thing about calculus — besides the fact that I’m not going to do any
for you here — is that it enables you to create optimal values equations. One
of the coolest such equations is called the economic order quantity, or EOQ,
model. I know that this stuff all sounds terribly confusing and totally boring,
but stay with me for just another paragraph. (If you’re not satisfied in
another paragraph or so, skip ahead to the next secret formula.)
Perhaps you buy and then resell — oh, I don’t know — 2,000 cases of vintage
French wine every year. The EOQ model enables you to decide whether you
should order all 2,000 cases at one time, order 1 case at a time, or order some
number of cases in between 1 case and 2,000 cases.
339
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

Another way to say the same thing is that the EOQ model enables you to
choose the best, or optimal, reorder quantity for items that you buy and 
then resell.
If you’re still with me at this point, I figure that you want to know how this
formula works. You need to know just three pieces of data to calculate the
optimal order quantity: the annual sales volume, the cost of placing an order,
and the annual cost of holding one unit in inventory. You plug this informa-
tion into the following formula:
You buy and resell 2,000 cases a year, so that amount is the sales volume.
Every time you place an order for the wine, you need to buy an $800 round-
trip ticket to Paris (just to sample the inventory) and pay $200 for a couple of
nights at a hotel. So your cost per order is $1,000. Finally, with insurance,
interest on a bank loan, and the cost of maintaining your hermetically sealed,
temperature-controlled wine cellar, the cost of storing a case of wine is about
$100 a year. In this example, you can calculate the optimal order quantity as
follows:
Work through the numbers, and you get 200. Therefore, the order quantity
that minimizes the total cost of your trips to Paris and of holding your expen-
sive wine inventory is 200 cases. You could, of course, make only one trip to
Paris a year and buy 2,000 cases of wine at once, thereby saving travel
money, but you would spend more money on holding your expensive wine
inventory than you would save on travel costs. And although you could
reduce your wine inventory carrying costs by going to Paris every week and
picking up a few cases, your travel costs would go way, way up. (Of course,
you would get about a billion frequent flyer miles a year.)
You can use the Standard view of the Windows Calculator to compute eco-
nomic order quantities. The trick is to click the :
__ (square root) key last. For
example, to calculate the economic order quantity in the preceding example,

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 isn’t exactly a secret formula. It’s more like a general rule.
Usually, people use this rule to figure out how long it will take for some
investment or savings account to double in value. The Rule of 72 is a cool
little trick, however, and it has several useful applications for businesspeople.
What the rule says is that if you divide the value 72 by an interest rate percent-
age, your result is approximately the number of years it will take to double
your money. For example, if you can stick money into some investment that
pays 12 percent interest, it will take roughly 6 years to double your money
because 72 / 12 = 6.
The Rule of 72 isn’t exact, but it’s usually close enough for government work.
For example, if you invest $1,000 for 6 years at 12 percent interest, what you
really get after 6 years isn’t $2,000 but $1,973.92.
If you’re in business, you can use the Rule of 72 for a couple other forecasts, too:
 To forecast how long it will take inflation to double the price of an
item, divide 72 by the inflation rate. For example, if you own a building
with a value that you figure will at least keep up with inflation, and you
wonder how long the building will take to double in value if inflation
runs at 4 percent, you just divide 72 by 4. The result is 18, meaning that
it will take roughly 18 years for the building to double in value. Again,
the Rule of 72 isn’t exactly on the money, but it’s dang close. A $100,000
building increases in value to $202,581.65 over 18 years if the annual
inflation rate is 4 percent.
 To forecast how long it will take to double sales volume, divide 72 by
the given annual growth rate. For example, if you can grow your busi-
ness by, say, 9 percent a year, you will roughly double the size of the
business in 8 years because 72 / 9 = 8. (I’m becoming kind of compulsive
about this point, I know, but let me say again that the rule isn’t exact,
but it’s very close. If a $1,000,000-a-year business grows 9 percent annu-
ally, its sales equal $1,992,562.64 after 8 years of 9 percent growth. This
figure really means that the business will generate roughly $2,000,000 of
sales in the ninth year.)

or Home], your screen may look a little different from the figures here.
I’m using Windows XP Home Edition, by the way. Not that you care, or
that it matters. . . .)
If you’re installing QuickBooks on a computer running Windows 2000 
or Windows XP Professional, you need to log on as either the administra-
tor or a user with administrator rights. With these operating systems,
Windows security features require an administrator to install the
QuickBooks program.
2. Get the QuickBooks CD.
Rip open the QuickBooks package, and get out the CD (which looks
exactly like the ones that play music).
3. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive.
If you have any amount of luck, Windows recognizes that you’ve inserted
the QuickBooks CD and displays a little message box that asks whether
you want to install QuickBooks. If you see this dialog box — you may
have to wait a few minutes — click the Yes button, and skip to Step 6.
4. If nothing happens when you insert the QuickBooks CD, open the
Control Panel window.
In Windows XP, click the Start button and then choose Control Panel. In
most versions of Windows, including Windows 2000, you click the Start
button and then choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Start menu.
Figure A-1 shows the Windows XP Control Panel window that appears.

5. Start the Windows Install program.
In most versions of Windows, you can do this by double-clicking the Add
or Remove Programs icon. When the dialog box in Figure A-2 appears,
click Add New Programs, and follow the on-screen instructions. You
need to press the Enter key several times to move through some dialog
boxes. Figure A-2, I should mention, is the Windows XP Add or Remove
Programs tool. If you’re using some other flavor of Windows, the tool
looks different, but it works roughly the same way.

6. Tell QuickBooks how you want it to install itself.
Ultimately, the QuickBooks installation window appears. Click its 
Begin button. The installation program asks several awkward technical
questions — how much you weigh, whether you watch your cholesterol,
whether you always wear your seatbelt — but don’t tie yourself in knots.
Just accept the default, or suggested, answers. (The default installation
options are fine for 999 out of 1,000 users.)
7. Provide the License and Product Number.
Finally, the QuickBooks License Number and Product Number window
appears. Enter these two bits of licensing information (they should be
printed on a yellow sticker on the back of the CD sleeve), and click Next
to begin the true “file-copying” installation process. The program slowly
begins extracting files from the CD. Did I mention that this process is
slow? Think glacier sliding down the side of a mountain. Obviously, you
need to follow the on-screen instructions. But don’t get stressed. If you
have a question about an installation option, just accept the QuickBooks
suggestion by pressing Enter.
As the installation program runs, you should see a little bar that shows
your progress. 
If you need to cancel the installation at any time, click Cancel.
QuickBooks warns you that the setup is incomplete. That’s okay; just
start the setup from scratch next time around.
8. Take 30 seconds or so to contemplate the meaning of life or get a
drink of water.
9. When the Install program finishes, click Restart.
Congratulations. You’re finished with the installation. You have a new item
on the Programs menu and probably new shortcuts on your desktop.
10. (Optional) Celebrate.
Stand up at your desk, click your heels together three times, and repeat
the phrase “There’s no place like home.” And watch out for flying houses.
As soon as you’re done celebrating, you may want to flip to Chapter 2 and
find out how to register the program. You’ll probably want to register
QuickBooks before you begin using it.
If you work on a network and want to be able to share a QuickBooks file
stored on one computer with other computers on the network, you need to
install QuickBooks on all the other computers that you want to use to work
with the file. Note: You need a separate copy of QuickBooks — such as from
the five-pack version — for each computer on which you want to install
QuickBooks.
347
Appendix A: Installing QuickBooks in Ten Easy Steps

By the way — and I mention this just because I’ve had a couple of clients ask
about this lately — running QuickBooks on a network with multiple QuickBooks
users isn’t super-tricky or terribly complicated. QuickBooks takes care of the
hard stuff. If you have more than one person using QuickBooks, you owe it to
yourself (and your business) to set up a network and then purchase and install
multiple copies of QuickBooks. Refer to Appendix C for more information.

Appendix B
If Numbers Are Your Friends
You don’t need to know much about accounting or about double-entry
bookkeeping to use QuickBooks, which, as you know, is most of its
appeal. If you’re serious about this accounting business or serious about
your business, consider finding out a bit more; setting up QuickBooks and
understanding all the QuickBooks reports will be easier, and you’ll be more
sophisticated in your accounting, too.
Just because the accounting in this appendix is a little more complicated
doesn’t mean that you can’t understand it. To make this whole discussion
more concrete, I use one big example. Hope it helps you out! If nothing else,
it’ll inspire you to get into the rowboat rental business.
Keying In on Profit
Start with the big picture. The key purpose of an accounting system is to
enable you to answer the burning question “Am I making any money?”
Accounting is that simple. Really. At least conceptually. So, throughout the
rest of this appendix, I just talk about how to calculate a business’s profits in
a reasonably accurate but still practical manner.
Let me introduce you to the new you
You just moved to Montana for the laid-back living and fresh air. You live in a
cute log cabin on Flathead Lake. To support yourself, you plan to purchase
several rowboats and rent them to visiting fly fishermen. Of course, you’ll
probably need to do quite a bit of fly-fishing, too, but just consider that the
price you pay for being your own boss.
The first day in business
It’s your first day in business. About 5 a.m., ol’ Peter Gruntpaw shows up to
deliver your three rowboats. He made them for you in his barn, but even so,

they aren’t cheap. He charges $1,500 apiece, so you write him a check for
$4,500.
Peter’s timing, as usual, is impeccable. About 5:15 a.m., your first customers
arrive. Mr. and Mrs. Hamster (pronounced ohm-stair) are visiting from Phoenix.
They want to catch the big fish. You’re a bit unsure of your pricing, but you
suggest $25 an hour for the boat. They agree and pay $200 in cash for eight
hours.
A few minutes later, another couple arrives. The Gerbils (pronounced go-
bells) are very agitated. They were supposed to meet the Hamsters and fish
together, but the Hamsters are rowing farther and farther away from the
dock. To speed the Gerbils’ departure, you let them leave without paying, but
you’re not worried. As the Gerbils leave the dock, Ms. Gerbil shouts, “We’ll
pay you the $200 when we get back!”
Although you don’t rent the third boat, you do enjoy a sleepy summer morning.
About 2 p.m., the Hamsters and Gerbils come rowing back into view. Obviously,
though, a problem has occurred. You find out what it is when the first boat
arrives. “Gerbil fell into the lake,” laughs Mr. Hamster. “Lost his wallet, too.”
Everybody else seems to think that the lost wallet is funny. You secretly
wonder how you’re going to get paid. No wallet, no money.
You ask Mr. Gerbil whether he would like to come out to the lake tomorrow to
pay you. He says he’ll just write you a check when he gets home to Phoenix.
Reluctantly, you agree.
Look at your cash flow first
I just described a fairly simple situation. But even so, answering the question
“Did I make any money?” isn’t going to be easy. You start by looking at your cash
flow: You wrote a check for $4,500, and you collected $200 in cash. Table B-1
shows your cash flow.
Table B-1
The First Day’s Cash Flow
Cash In and Out
Amount
Add the cash:
Rent money from Hamsters 
$200
(pronounced ohm-stairs)
Rent money from Gerbils 
$0
(pronounced go-bells)
Subtract the cash:
Money to purchase rowboats
($4,500)
Equals your cash flow:
($4,300)
350
Part VI: Appendixes 

To summarize, you had $200 come in but $4,500 go out. So your cash flow
was –$4,300. (That’s why the $4,300 is in parentheses.) From a cash-flow per-
spective, the first day doesn’t look all that good, right? But does the cash-
flow calculation show you whether you’re making money? Can you look at it
and gauge whether your little business is on the right track?
The answer to both questions is no. Your cash flow is important. You can’t,
for example, write a $4,500 check unless you have at least $4,500 in your
checking account. But your cash flow doesn’t tell you whether you’re making
money. In fact, you may see a couple of problems with looking just at the
cash flow of the rowboat rental business.
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick
Here’s the first problem: If you take good care of the rowboats, you can use
them every summer for the next few years. In fact, say that the rowboat
rental season, which runs from early spring to late autumn, is 150 days long
and that your well-made rowboats will last 10 years.
 You can probably rent the rowboats for 1,500 days.
(One hundred fifty days a year times 10 years equals 1,500 days.)
 Each rowboat costs $1,500.
The depreciation expense for each rowboat is only $1 per day over 1,500
days. That’s a whopping $3 for all three boats.
Do you see what I’m saying? If you have something that costs a great deal of
money but lasts for a long time, spreading out the cost makes sense. This
spreading out is usually called depreciation. The little $1 chunks that are allo-
cated to a day are the depreciation expense.
Accountants use the terms cost and expense to mean distinctly different things.
A cost is the price that you pay for something. If you pay Peter Gruntpaw $1,500
for a rowboat, the rowboat’s cost is $1,500. An expense, on the other hand, is
what you use in a profit calculation. The little $1 chunks of the rowboat’s
$1,500 cost (that are allocated to individual days) are expenses.
If this depreciation stuff seems wacky, remember that what you’re really
trying to do is figure out whether you made any money your first day of busi-
ness. And all I’m really saying is that you shouldn’t include the whole cost of
the rowboats as an expense in the first day’s profit calculation. Some of the
cost should be included as an expense in calculating the profit in future days.
That’s fair, right?
351
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

Accrual-basis accounting is cool
You don’t want to forget about the $200 that the Gerbils owe you, either.
Although Mr. Gerbil (remember that the name is pronounced go-bell) may not
send you the check for several days or even for several weeks, he will pay
you. You’ve earned the money.
The principles of accounting say that you should include sales in your profit
calculations when you earn the money and not when you actually collect it.
The logic behind this include sales when they’re earned rule is that it pro-
duces a better estimate of the business you’re doing.
Say that the day after the Gerbils and Hamsters rent the rowboats, you have no
customers, but Mr. Gerbil comes out and pays you $200. If you use the include
sales when they’re earned rule — or what’s called accrual-basis accounting —
your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$400
$0
If you instead use what’s called cash-basis accounting (in which you count
sales when you collect the cash), your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$200
$200
The traditional accrual-based accounting method shows that you have a good
day when you rent two boats and a terrible day when you don’t rent any boats.
352
Part VI: Appendixes 
Different names, same logic
I don’t see any point in hiding this nasty little
accounting secret from you: Accountants call
this cost-allocation process by different names,
depending on what sort of cost is being spread
out.
Most of the time, the cost allocation is called
depreciation. You depreciate buildings, machin-
ery, furniture, and many other items as well. But
allocating the cost of a natural resource —
such as crude oil that you pump, coal that you
dig, or minerals that you extract — is called
depletion. And allocating the cost of things that
aren’t tangible — copyrights and patents, for
example — is amortization.

In comparison, when you use cash-basis accounting, your sales record looks as
though you rented a boat each day, even though you didn’t. Now you know
why accrual-basis accounting is a better way to measure profit.
Accrual-basis accounting also works for expenses. You should count an
expense when you make it, not when you pay it. For example, you call the
local radio station and ask the people there to announce your new boat-
rental business a couple of times for a fee of $25. Although you don’t have to
pay the radio station the day you make the arrangements for your announce-
ment, you should still count the $25 as an expense for that day.
Now you know how to measure profits
With what you now know, you’re ready to measure the first day’s profits.
Table B-2 is a profit and loss statement for your first day in business.
Table B-2
A Profit and Loss Statement for the First Day

Although the first day’s cash flow was terrible, your little business is quite
profitable. In fact, if you really do make about $370 a day, you’ll recoup your
entire $4,500 investment in less than three weeks. That’s pretty darn good.
Some financial brain food
Now that you know how to measure profits, I can fill you in on some impor-
tant conceptual stuff:
 You measure profits for a specific period of time.
In the rowboat business example, you measured the profits for a day.
Some people actually do measure profits (or they try to measure profits)
on a daily basis. Most times, though, people use bigger chunks of time.
Monthly chunks of time are common, for example, as are three-month
353
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

chunks of time (quarters). And everybody measures profits annually —
if only because the government makes you do so for income tax
accounting.
 When people start talking about how often and for what chunks of
time profits are measured, they use a couple of terms.
The year that you calculate profits for is the fiscal year. The smaller
chunks of time for which you measure profits over the year are account-
ing periods or interim accounting periods.
You don’t need to memorize these new terms. But now that you’ve read
them, you’ll probably remember them.
 The length of your accounting periods involves an awkward trade-off.
Daily profit and loss calculations show you how well you did at the end
of every day, but you have to collect the data and do the work every day.
And preparing a profit and loss statement is a great deal of work.
I made the example purposefully easy by including only a few transac-
tions, but in real life, you have many more transactions to worry about
and fiddle with.
 If you use a quarterly interim accounting period, you don’t have to
collect the raw data and do the arithmetic very often, but you know
how you’re doing only every once in a while.
In my mind, checking your profits only four times a year isn’t enough. A
lot can happen in three months.
In the Old Days, Things Were Different
If you’re new to the arithmetic and logic of profit calculation — which is
mostly what modern accounting is all about — you won’t be surprised to
hear that not all that long ago, most people couldn’t and didn’t do much
profit calculating.
What they did instead was monitor a business’s financial condition. They
used — well, actually, they still use — a balance sheet to monitor the finan-
cial condition. A balance sheet just lists a business’s assets and its liabilities
at a particular point in time.
Say that at the start of your first day in the rowboat-rental business — before
you pay Peter Gruntpaw — you have $5,000 in your checking account. To
make the situation interesting, $4,000 of this money is a loan from your
mother-in-law, and $1,000 is cash that you’ve invested in your business.
354
Part VI: Appendixes 

Here’s a key to help you understand the balance sheets and cash flow in this
section:
 A business’s assets comprise things that the business owns.
 Liabilities comprise the amounts that the business owes.
 Equity is the difference between the business’s assets and its liabilities.
Interestingly, equity also shows the money that the owners or share-
holders or partners have left in the business.
 If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that go on the balance
sheet, the total assets value always equals the total liabilities plus total
owner’s equity value.
Your balance sheet at the beginning of the day looks like the one in Table B-3.

If you construct a balance sheet at the end of the first day, the financial pic-
ture is only slightly more complicated. Some of these explanations are too
complicated to give in a sentence, so the paragraphs that follow describe
how I got each number.
Even if you don’t pay all that much attention, I recommend that you quickly
read through the explanations. Mostly, I want you to understand that if you
try to monitor a business’s financial condition by using a balance sheet, as
I’ve done here, the picture gets messy. Later in this appendix, I talk about
how QuickBooks makes all this stuff easier.
Table B-4 shows the balance sheet at the end of the first day.

Cash, the first line item shown in Table B-4, is the most complicated line item
to prove. If you were really in the rowboat-rental business, of course, you
could just look at your checkbook. But if you were writing an appendix about
being in the rowboat-rental business — as I am — you’d need to be able to
calculate the cash balance. Table B-5 shows the calculation of the cash bal-
ance for your rowboat-rental business.
The $200 receivable, the second line item shown in Table B-4, is the money
that the Gerbils owe you.
The third line shown in Table B-4, the Rowboats balance sheet value, is
$4,497. This is weird, I’ll grant you, but here’s how you figure it: You take the
original cost of the asset and deduct all the depreciation expense that you’ve
charged to date. The original cost of the three rowboats was $4,500. You’ve
charged only $3 of depreciation for the first day, so the balance sheet value,
or net book value, is $4,497.
The only liabilities are the $25 that you owe the radio station for those new
business announcements (shown on the seventh line in Table B-4) and the
$4,000 that you borrowed from your mother-in-law (shown on the eighth line
in Table B-4). I won’t even ask why you opened that can of worms.
Finally, the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet shows the $1,000 that
you originally contributed (see line 10 in Table B-4) and also the $372 of
money you earned (see line 11 in Table B-4).

It’s not a coincidence that the total assets value equals the total liabilities
plus the total owner’s equity value. If you correctly calculate each of the num-
bers that go on the balance sheet, the two totals are always equal.
A balance sheet lists asset, liability, and owner’s equity balances as of a spe-
cific date. It gives you a financial snapshot at a point in time. Usually, you pre-
pare a balance sheet whenever you prepare a profit and loss statement. The
balance sheet shows account balances for the last day of the fiscal year and
interim accounting period. (I think that it’s kind of neat that after only a few
pages of this appendix, you’re reading and understanding such terms as fiscal
year and interim accounting period.)
What Does an Italian Monk 
Have to Do with Anything?
So far, I’ve provided narrative descriptions of all the financial events that affect
the balance sheet and the income statement. I describe how you started the
business with $5,000 of cash (a $4,000 loan from your mother-in-law and
$1,000 of cash that you yourself invested). At an even earlier point in this
appendix, I noted how you rented a boat to the Hamsters for $200, and they
paid you in cash.
Although the narrative descriptions of financial events — such as starting the
business or renting to the Hamsters — make for just-bearable reading, they
are unwieldy for accountants to use in practice. Partly, this awkwardness is
because accountants are usually (or maybe always?) terrible writers. But an
even bigger problem is that using the lots-and-lots-of-words approach makes
describing all the little bits and pieces of information that you need difficult
and downright tedious.
Fortunately, about 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Lucia Pacioli thought
the same thing. No, I’m not making this up. What Pacioli really said was, “Hey,
guys. Hello? Is anybody in there? You have to get more efficient in the way
that you describe your financial transactions. You have to create a financial
357
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

shorthand system that works when you have a large number of transactions
to record.”
Pacioli proceeded to describe a financial shorthand system that made it easy
to collect all the little bits and pieces of information needed to prepare income
statements and balance sheets. The shorthand system he described? Double-
entry bookkeeping.
This system enabled people to name the income statement or balance sheet
line items or accounts that are affected and then give the dollar amount of
the effect. The profit and loss statement and the balance sheet line items are
called accounts. You need to remember this term.
A list of profit and loss statement and balance sheet line items is a chart of
accounts. You might already know this term from using QuickBooks.
Pacioli also did one wacky thing. He used a couple of new terms — debit and
credit — to describe the increases and decreases in accounts.
 Debit: Increases in asset accounts and in expense accounts are debits.
Decreases in liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also
debits.
 Credit: Decreases in asset and expense accounts are credits. Increases in
liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also credits.
Keeping these terms straight is a bit confusing, so see Table B-6 for help.
I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but if you want to use double-entry book-
keeping, you need to memorize the information in Table B-6. If it’s any conso-
lation, this information is the only chunk of data in the entire book that I ask
you to memorize. Or, failing that, dogear this page so that you can flip here
quickly — or just refer to the Cheat Sheet.

And now for the blow-by-blow
The best way to help you understand this double-entry bookkeeping stuff is
to show you how to use it to record all the financial events that I’ve dis-
cussed thus far in this appendix. Start with the money that you’ve invested in
the business and the money that you foolishly borrowed from your mother-
in-law. You invested $1,000 in cash, and you borrowed $4,000 in cash. Here
are the double-entry bookkeeping transactions — called journal entries —
that describe these financial events.

If you add up all the debits and credits in a journal entry, you get a trial bal-
ance. A trial balance isn’t all that special, but you use it to prepare profit and
loss statements and balance sheets easily. If you add up the debits and credits
shown in journal entries 1 and 2, you get the trial balance shown in Table B-7.
Table B-7

This trial balance provides the raw data needed to construct the rowboat-
business balance sheet at the start of the first day. If you don’t believe me,
359
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

take a peek at Table B-3. Oh, sure, the information shown in Table B-7 isn’t as
polished. Table B-7 doesn’t provide labels, for example, that tell you that cash
is an asset. And Table B-7 doesn’t provide subtotals showing the total assets
(equal to $5,000) and the total liabilities and owner’s equity (also equal to
$5,000). But it does provide the raw data.
Take a look at the journal entries you would make to record the rest of the
first day’s financial events:

To build a trial balance for the end of the first day, you add all the first day
journal entries to the trial balance shown in Table B-7. The result is the trial
balance shown in Table B-8.

The trial balance shown in Table B-8 provides the raw data used to prepare
the balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the first day.
If you look at the accounts labeled Balance sheet accounts in Table B-8 and
compare these with the balance sheet shown in Table B-4, you see that this
trial balance provides all the raw numbers needed for the balance sheet. The
361
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

only numbers in Table B-4 that aren’t directly from Table B-8 are the subtotals
that you get by adding up other numbers.
If you look at the accounts labeled as Profit and loss statement accounts in
Table B-8 and compare them with the profit and loss statement shown in
Table B-2, you see that this trial balance also provides all the raw numbers
needed for the profit and loss statement. Again, the only numbers in Table 
B-2 that aren’t directly from Table B-8 are the subtotals that you get by
adding up other numbers.
Blow-by-blow, part II
If you understand what I’ve discussed so far, you grasp how accounting and
double-entry bookkeeping work. I want to show you about a half-dozen more
example transactions, however, to plug a few minor holes in your knowledge.
When you collect money that you’ve previously billed, you record the trans-
action by debiting cash and crediting receivables (or accounts receivable). In
the rowboat business, you make this basic entry when Mr. Gerbil later pays
you the $200 that he owes you for the first day’s rental.

Don’t record a sale when you collect the cash. The sale has already been

The one other thing I want to cover — ever so briefly — is inventory accounting.
Accounting for items that you buy and resell or the items that you make and
resell is a bit trickier, and I don’t have room to go into a great deal of detail.
362
Part VI: Appendixes 

When you buy items to resell, you debit an asset account, often named
Inventory. If you purchase 300 of the $10 thingamajigs that you hope to resell
for $25 each, you record the following journal entry:
Journal Entry 10: To record the cash purchase of thingamajigs
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$3,000
Cash
$3,000
When you sell a thingamajig, you need to do two tasks: record the sale and
record the cost of the sale. If you need to record the sale of 100 thingamajigs
for $25 each, for example, you record the following journal entry:
Journal Entry 11: To record the sale of 100 thingamajigs for
$25 apiece
Debit
Credit
Receivable
$2,500
Sales
$2,500
You also need to record the cost of the thingamajigs that you’ve sold as an
expense and record the reduction in the value of your thingamajig inventory.
That means that if you reduce your inventory count from 300 items to 200
items, you need to adjust your inventory’s dollar value. You record the fol-
lowing journal entry:
Journal Entry 12: To record the cost of the 100 thingamajigs sold
Debit
Credit
Cost of goods sold
$1,000
Inventory
$1,000
The cost of goods sold account, by the way, is just another expense. It
appears on your profit and loss statement.

Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

How does QuickBooks help?
If you (or someone else) keep(s) the books for your business manually, you
actually have to make these journal entries. When you use QuickBooks to
keep the books, however, all this debiting and crediting business usually goes
on behind the scenes. When you invoice a customer, QuickBooks debits
accounts receivable and credits sales. When you write a check to pay some
bill, QuickBooks debits the expense (or the accounts payable account) and
credits cash.
In the few cases in which a financial transaction isn’t recorded automatically
when you fill in some on-screen form, you need to use the General Journal
Entry window. To display the General Journal Entry window, choose Company➪
Make General Journal Entries. You use the General Journal Entry window to
create journal entries. An example of one of these noncash transactions is
Depreciation expense.
QuickBooks automatically builds a trial balance, using journal entries that it
constructs automatically and any journal entries that you enter by using the
General Journal Entry window. If you want to see the trial balance, just
choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks prepares
balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and several other reports as well
by using the trial balance.
Two Dark Shadows in the 
World of Accounting
The real purpose of accounting systems, such as QuickBooks, is simple:
Accounting systems are supposed to make succeeding in your business
easier for you. You may think, therefore, that the world of accounting is a
friendly place. Unfortunately, this scenario isn’t quite true. I’m sorry to report
that two dark shadows hang over the world of accounting: financial account-
ing standards and income tax laws.
The first dark shadow
“Financial accounting standards,” you say. “What the heck are those?”
Here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: Financial accounting standards are
accounting rules created by certified public accountants. These rules are
364
Part VI: Appendixes 

supposed to make reading financial statements and understanding what’s
going on easier for people. (I happen to believe that just the opposite is often
true, in case you’re interested.) But because of what financial accounting
standards purport to do, some people — such as bank loan officers — want
to see profit and loss statements and balance sheets that follow the rules.
The exact catchphrase is one that you might have heard before: “prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
Unfortunately, the rules are very complicated; the rules are inconsistently
interpreted; and actually applying the rules would soon run most small busi-
nesses into the ground. (And as you were running your business into the
ground — you’ll be happy to know — your certified public accountant would
make a great deal of money helping you figure out what you were supposed
to be doing.) So what should you do about this first dark shadow?
Glad you asked:
 First of all, know that it exists. Know that people like your banker honestly
think that you should follow a super-complicated set of accounting rules.
 Also, don’t get sucked into the financial accounting standards tar pit.
Tell people — your banker included — that you do your accounting in
the way that you think enables you to best manage your business. Tell
people a small business like yours can’t afford to have an in-house staff
of full-time CPAs. Finally, tell people that you don’t necessarily prepare
your financial statements “in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.”
Do attempt to fully and fairly disclose your financial affairs to people who need
to know about them. Lying to a creditor or an investor about your financial
affairs or getting sneaky with one of these people is a good way to end up in jail.
The second dark shadow
And now here’s the second dark shadow: income tax accounting laws. You
know that Congress enacts tax legislation to raise revenue. And you know
that it does so in a political environment strewn with all sorts of partisan
voodoo economics and social overtones. So you won’t be surprised to find
out that the accounting rules that come out of the nation’s capital and your
state capital don’t make much sense for running a business.
You need to apply the rules when you prepare your tax return, of course, but
you don’t have to use them the rest of the year. A far better approach is to do
your accounting in a way that enables you to best run your business. That
way, you don’t use accounting tricks and gambits that make sense for income
365
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

tax accounting but foul up your accounting system. At the end of the year,
when you’re preparing your tax return, have your tax preparer adjust your
trial balance so that it conforms to income tax accounting laws.
The Danger of Shell Games
This appendix is longer than I initially intended. I’m sorry about that. I want
to share one more thought with you, however. And I think that it’s an impor-
tant thought, so please stay with me just a little longer.
You could use the accounting knowledge that this appendix imparts to do the
bookkeeping for a very large business. As crazy as it sounds, if you had 3,000
rowboats for rent — perhaps you have rental outlets at dozens of lakes scat-
tered all over the Rockies — you might actually be able to keep the books for
a $200 million-a-year business. You would have to enter many more transac-
tions, and the numbers would all be bigger, but you wouldn’t necessarily be
doing anything more complicated than the transactions in this appendix.
Unfortunately, the temptation is great — especially on the part of financial
advisors — to let the money stuff get more complicated as a business grows.
People start talking about sophisticated leasing arrangements that make
sense because of the tax laws. Some customer or vendor suggests some com-
plicated profit-sharing or cost-reimbursement agreement. Then your attorney
talks you into setting up a couple of new subsidiaries for legal reasons.
All these schemes make accounting for your business terribly complicated. 
If you choose to ignore this complexity and go on your merry way, very soon
you won’t know whether you’re making money. (I’ve seen plenty of people go
this route — and it isn’t pretty.) On the other hand, if you truly want to do
accurate accounting in a complex environment, you need to spend a great
deal of cash for really smart accountants. (This tactic, of course, assumes
that you can find, hire, and afford these really smart accountants.)
If you’re unsure how to tell whether something is just too complicated, here’s
a general rule you can use: If you can’t easily create the journal entries that
quantify the financial essence of some event, you’re in trouble.
So what should you do? I suggest that you don’t complicate your business’s
finances — not even if you think that the newfangled, tax-incentivized, sale-
leaseback profit plan is a sure winner. Keep things simple, my friend. To win
the game, you have to keep score.

Appendix C
Sharing QuickBooks Files
In This Appendix
 Understanding how QuickBooks works on a network
 Installing QuickBooks for network use
 Setting up user permissions
 Specifying multi-user mode
 Working with a shared QuickBooks file
O
kay, here’s a cool deal: Within QuickBooks, you can set up user permis-
sions, which lets you specify who has access to which areas of your
QuickBooks files. In fact, you can also work with your QuickBooks file on a
network and in a multiple-user environment by using a powerful feature
called record locking.
If you work on a network and need to use or just want to find out about the
QuickBooks network features, you should read this appendix. If your computer
isn’t connected to a network, but you want to designate unique permissions
for different people by using a QuickBooks file on a single computer, you
should read the section “Setting Up User Permissions,” later in this appendix.
And if you’re the only one using QuickBooks, you can skip this appendix.
Sharing a QuickBooks File on a Network
Two important features power the QuickBooks multi-user network capability:
user permissions and record locking. The user permissions feature lets multi-
ple users of a QuickBooks file have unique permissions settings to access dif-
ferent areas of QuickBooks. Record locking, the second feature, allows more
than one person to log on to and work with a QuickBooks file at once.

User permissions
QuickBooks lets you set user permissions so that you can give different
QuickBooks users different privileges. For example, Jane Owner may be able
to do anything she wants because, metaphorically speaking, she’s Da Man.
But Joe Clerk may only be able to enter bills. Joe, a lowly clerk of perhaps
dubious judgment and discretion, may not have the ability to view the com-
pany’s profit and loss statement, print checks, or record customer payments.
This idea makes sense at a practical level, right? In a situation in which a
bunch of people access the QuickBooks file, you want to make sure that con-
fidential information remains confidential.
You also want to make sure that people can’t intentionally or unintentionally
corrupt your financial records. For example, you don’t want someone to
enter incorrect data (perhaps because they stumble into some area of the
QuickBooks program where they have no business being). And you don’t
want someone fraudulently recording transactions — such as fake checks
that they can go cash.
I think that if you reflect on this user permissions stuff, you’ll realize “Hey,
yeah, that makes sense!” So I’m not going to talk a bunch more about it. But
let me conclude by throwing out a couple of general observations about how
you decide which user permissions are appropriate:
 Data confidentiality: This issue probably has the most to do with your
management philosophy. The more open you are about stuff, the less
you probably have to worry about people snooping around for stuff. I
want to point out, however, that payroll is always a touchy subject. If
everybody knows what everyone else is paid, some interesting discus-
sions occur. But you already knew that. . . .
 Data corruption: Regarding data corruption, you need to know that
people usually apply two general rules:
• Don’t give people access to tools they don’t know how to use.
That’s only asking for trouble.
• Make sure that no one person can muck around unsupervised in
some area of the accounting system — especially if that person
records or handles cash.
If at all possible, employ a buddy system whereby people do stuff together so
that people always double-check — even if only indirectly — other people’s
work. Maybe Joe records a bill, for example, but Jane always cuts the check
to pay the bill. Maybe Raul records customer invoices, but Chang sends them
out. Maybe Saul records cash receipts, but Beth deposits them. You see the
pattern, right? If two people deal with a particular economic event — again,
especially one that involves cash — it’s a really good idea for Joe and Jane,
Raul and Chang, and Saul and Beth to look over each other’s shoulders.
368
Part VI: Appendixes 

Record locking
The easiest way to understand record locking is to compare it with the other
variety of locking, file locking. Most of the other programs that you use —
perhaps every one but QuickBooks — use file locking. What file locking means
is this: If one person on the network has, for instance, a word processing doc-
ument open, nobody else on the network can open that document. Other
people may be able to open a copy of the document that they can save on
their own computers, but they can’t edit the original document. The operat-
ing system locks the original document (the file) so that only one person can
fool around with the file at a time. This locking ensures the integrity of the
data and the changes that people make to the data. (If this business about
ensuring integrity seems weird, think about the difficulty of making sure that
both people’s changes end up in a word processing document that both
people are simultaneously editing.)
Record locking works differently. With record locking, more than one person
on the network can open and edit the same file at once, but only one person
can work with a specific record.
A record is a part of a file. For example, in a file of bills that you owe to ven-
dors, the file is the entire collection of bills. The individual bills are records
within the file. So more than one person can open the file of bills. But individ-
ual bills — the individual records that make up the file — are locked when a
person grabs a record.
This information sounds like too much confusion, but differentiating between
files and the records within a file is what makes sharing files possible. In
QuickBooks, for example, if Jane is entering one bill for the Alpha Company 
in a file, Joe can edit a bill for Beta Corporation because the two bills are dif-
ferent records. However, Jane can’t — because of record locking — fool around
with the Beta Corporation bill that Joe’s editing. And Joe can’t — again, because
of record locking — fiddle with the Alpha Company bill that Jane’s entering.
Restated more generally, no two people can edit the same record in the file at
the same time. Record locking enables employees to use a file in a multi-user
environment because it lets more than one person work with a file.
369
Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files
Just what is a network, anyway?
A network is a set of computers that someone
has connected so that the people who use the
computers can share information. Uh, well, this
is somewhat self-serving, but let me say that if
you don’t currently use a network, Networking
For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Doug Lowe, and
Home Networking For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by
Kathy Ivens (both published by Wiley), explain
how to set up a small business network in a
couple of hours and live to tell about it.

Installing QuickBooks for Network Use
To install QuickBooks for network use, you must first install QuickBooks on
all the computers on the network that need to access and work with the
QuickBooks file. This task isn’t tricky. You don’t need to install QuickBooks in
any fancy way to be able to share QuickBooks files.
You need to purchase a copy of QuickBooks for each computer that’s going
to run the program. So if you have five computers on which you want to use
QuickBooks, you need to buy five copies of QuickBooks. Or you can buy the
special five-license version of QuickBooks. If you attempt to install a single
copy of QuickBooks (with a single key code) on multiple computers,
QuickBooks won’t allow two computers using the same key code to share a
file in multi-user mode.
When you create the file that you want to share, you need to make sure that
you store the file in a location where the other QuickBooks users can access
it. You may need to store the file on a server. You can also store the file on a
client computer as long as you designate sharing permissions for either the
folder or the drive on which you save the QuickBooks file.
Another important thing: Whoever creates the QuickBooks file automatically
becomes the file administrator. The file administrator has access to all areas
of the file and sets up the other file users. So you don’t want just anybody set-
ting up the QuickBooks file. Either the business owner or the head of
accounting is well suited for this job. In any case, the person who sets up the
file should be trustworthy, regularly around the office, and easy to reach for
any questions or problems that arise. And this person probably should have
a strong background in accounting. See the following section for more details.
370
Part VI: Appendixes 
Choosing a good password
The administrator has access to all areas of
QuickBooks, so picking a good password is
especially important. Other users (especially
those with higher levels of access permission)
also need to select their passwords carefully.
A good password is one that you can easily
remember but that other people can’t easily
guess. Combinations of letters and numbers 
are the best way to go. For example, use your
grade school nickname plus the number of 
your favorite basketball player. Or use a random
number combined with the name of your
favorite restaurant (as long as you don’t walk
around all day muttering “Number nine, number
nine, number nine” and raving about your love
of this particular eatery). Avoid using telephone
numbers, family names, and family dates (such
as the birthday of a family member). And
absolutely do not use banking PINs or Social
Security numbers.
One last tip: QuickBooks lets you create pass-
words from 0–16 characters in length. As a gen-
eral rule, choose a password that’s five or more
characters long.

Setting Up User Permissions
You can tell QuickBooks who else will use the file and set permissions for
these other people during the EasyStep Interview (see Chapter 2). But I’m
going to assume that you give QuickBooks this information later. To do it
later, use the User List dialog box, as shown in Figure C-1. To display this
dialog box, choose Company➪Set Up Users.
1. Click the Add User button.
Doing so displays the first dialog box of the Set Up User Password and
Access Wizard. You use this wizard to add new users and specify user
permissions.
Note: As a security measure, QuickBooks doesn’t let me easily show you
pictures of the wizard’s dialog boxes. I honor this arrangement and just
describe the dialog boxes rather than describe and show the dialog boxes.
2. Type a username and password for the additional person whom you
want to be able to use the QuickBooks file; type the password again in
the Confirm Password box.
Reentering the password confirms that you typed the password cor-
rectly the first time.
From this point forward, when someone opens the QuickBooks file,
QuickBooks asks for a username and password. So for another person 
to access the QuickBooks file, he or she must enter the username and
password that you’ve set.
3. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays a dialog box (not shown here) asking whether you
want the person to have access to all areas of the QuickBooks file or
only some areas.
4. Click All Areas or click Selected Areas and then click Next.
If you specify that you want to give access to only some areas, QuickBooks
displays a series of dialog boxes that allow you to set permissions for
each area.
Figure C-1:
The User
List dialog
box.
371
Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files

QuickBooks has a potentially dangerous security flaw. I don’t want to
unnecessarily alarm you, but the CPAs to whom I teach QuickBooks tell
me that it’s very common for embezzling employees to print something
like an invoice but then not save the invoice. By printing and then send-
ing an invoice, the embezzler tells some customer of yours that he (the
customer) needs to pay your firm money . . . but because QuickBooks
doesn’t make you save a transaction before you print it, the invoice
might never be recorded in the QuickBooks system. That means, sadly,
that when the customer sends you payment, the embezzler can just
steal the check without your being the wiser. The moral of this little
story is this: Think carefully about the access permissions that you set.
5. Designate the access permission level for each area in the Set Up User
Password and Access Wizard.
Click the No Access radio button to make the area off limits for the user.
Click the Full Access radio button to give the user permission to create
and print transactions and reports in the area, or click the Selective
Access radio button to give partial access to the area. If you click
Selective Access, specify the limited access. Click Next after supplying
each area’s access information to proceed to the next area. The other
areas’ dialog boxes look and work the same way.
6. Tell QuickBooks whether you want the user to be able to change or
delete existing transactions and those recorded before the closing
date that you specify.
After you go through the access permissions for all the areas, QuickBooks
displays a dialog box that provides option buttons for restricting user
access to existing transactions. By specifying a closing date, you can pre-
vent users — for example, new QuickBooks users or new employees —
from altering data before a given date.
To set a closing date, log on to the QuickBooks file as the administrator.
Then make sure that you’re working in single-user mode. (If you aren’t,
choose File➪Switch to Single-User Mode.) Then choose Company➪Set
Up Users, and click the Closing Date button. In the Set Closing Date
dialog box, enter the date on and before which you want to restrict
changes to transactions into the Date through Which Books Are Closed
text box, and click OK.
7. Click Next.
Specify whether you want the user to be able to access QuickBooks data
from another application, such as TurboTax.
8. Review the permissions that you’ve granted the new user.
After you finish stepping through the Set Up User Password and Access
Wizard, QuickBooks shows a summary of the permissions for a user.
Click Prev if you need to go back and change permissions for an area.
372
Part VI: Appendixes 

9. Click Finish to finish setting up the new user.
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box again, but with the new
user added. Click Add User to add another new user, click Edit User to
edit the selected user, or click Close to close the dialog box.
A user can log on and open a QuickBooks file from any computer on the net-
work as long as the computer has QuickBooks installed and has network
access to the QuickBooks file. If a person attempts to open a restricted area
or perform an unauthorized action, QuickBooks displays a message box indi-
cating that the person lacks the permissions necessary to perform the action.
Individual users can specify and save their own personal preferences for
working with QuickBooks. For example, a user can decide to display and even
customize the QuickBooks icon bar or set options for graphs, reminders, and
warnings. Users can access their individual preference settings by choosing
Edit➪Preferences. Select an area by clicking an icon (such as General) on the
left. Click the My Preferences tab, if it isn’t already selected.
Specifying Multi-User Mode
For more than one person to work with the QuickBooks file at once, the users
must work with the QuickBooks file in multi-user mode. The first person who
opens the file needs to specify multi-user mode for others to be able to open
the file. To specify multi-user mode, choose File➪Switch to Multi-User Mode.
You can tell that you’re working in multi-user mode because the QuickBooks
title bar indicates so. When other people open the QuickBooks file, it auto-
matically opens in multi-user mode. For another user to work in single-user
mode, the other users must close the QuickBooks file.
Working in Multi-User Mode
Sharing a QuickBooks file over a network involves a couple of tricks. First, you
need to make sure that no one who is in single-user mode is using the file that
you want to open. If someone is, and you try to open the file, QuickBooks dis-
plays a message indicating that someone is using the company file in single-user
mode. Tell the person to switch to multi-user mode and then click Try Again.
As soon as you begin creating or editing a transaction, QuickBooks locks the
transaction. This way, no one else can edit the transaction as you work on 
it. You can tell whether you have a transaction open in edit mode by what
QuickBooks indicates in the title bar at the top of the form: QuickBooks 
373
Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files

displays Editing Transaction in the title bar. Other users can open the
transaction as you edit it in edit mode, but they can’t make changes to it until
you’re through.
For example, if you attempt to edit a transaction that your co-worker Harriet
already has open in edit mode, QuickBooks displays a message that says
(and here, I paraphrase), “Excuse me, Bubba? Harriet is working with that
transaction. You need to come back later.”
