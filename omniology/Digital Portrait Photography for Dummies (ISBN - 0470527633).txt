Introduction
P
ortrait photography is not rocket science. Photographers have been 
capturing portraits of people since cameras were invented. When you 
create a portrait of someone, your goal is to create a likeness of the person at 
his best. But how do you capture a portrait of someone at his best when he’s 
camera shy, for instance?
Another goal of portrait photography is to tell the viewer something about 
your subject. In addition to capturing a digital image that looks like the 
person, you’re also capturing the person’s essence. When someone looks at a 
portrait of a person she knows and says that the image captures the subject’s 
true essence, the photographer has done his job perfectly.
Capturing a person’s likeness and essence in the same photograph may 
sound like a daunting task. Buy it really isn’t if you take lots of pictures of 
people using the techniques in this book. In fact, when you practice portrait 
photography and start getting some great shots, portrait photography is an 
incredible amount of fun.
A Peek at the Road Ahead
This book is divided into four parts, each devoted to a specific aspect of por-
trait photography. The chapters flow logically from one subject to the next to 
take you from digital portrait photography neophyte to experienced photog-
rapher. You can read the book from cover to cover, or if you need quick infor-
mation about a specific topic, peruse the table of contents or index until you 
find the desired topic. Most of the sections in this book don’t require reading 
additional material.
The following sections offer a brief overview of each part of the book.
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography
Part I contains four chapters that familiarize you with portrait photography:
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Exploring Portrait Photography,” introduces you to the dif-
ferent aspects of digital portrait photography.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Choosing Your Equipment,” shows you how to choose equip-
ment for digital portrait photography. You’ll find information on point-
and-shoot cameras, digital SLRs, lighting equipment, and accessories.

2
Digital Portrait Photography For Dummies 
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Getting to Know Digital Photography,” discusses camera set-
tings you use for portrait photography. In this chapter, you’ll find infor-
mation about shooting modes, ISO settings, formatting your cards, and 
much more.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Becoming a Portrait Photographer” is designed to inspire 
you to think about what you’re photographing instead of blindly point-
ing the camera at your subject and pressing the shutter button. I show 
you concepts for working like a photojournalist, visualizing your image, 
and much more.
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques
In this part of the book, I cut to the chase and show you how to become a 
better portrait photographer.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Composing Your Portraits,” shows you how to use some 
time-honored rules of photography to create more compelling images. In 
this chapter, I show you which camera settings to use for portrait pho-
tography. Then I discuss rules of composition as they apply to portrait 
photography. I show you which rules work for specific types of images 
and tell you when you should break the rules.
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Working with Your Subjects,” shows you how to establish 
rapport with your subjects, how to pose them, and also discusses 
makeup and wardrobe. In this chapter, I also discuss photographing pets 
with their humans and how to capture portraits of pets by themselves.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Lighting Your Portraits,” discusses lighting techniques for 
digital portrait photography. In this chapter, I show you how to work 
with available light, light modifiers, camera flash, and more.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Photographing Portraits on Location,” discusses shooting 
portraits at different locations, such as at a beach and in your home 
town. I also devote sections to photographing wildlife at zoos and wild-
life preserves.
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Photographing Portraits in Your Home or Office,” shows you 
techniques for creating formal and informal portraits in your home or 
office. I also discuss working with backdrops and creating a makeshift 
studio.
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits
This part of the book shows you how to organize, edit, and share your images 
using Photoshop Elements 8.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Editing with Photoshop Elements,” introduces you to 
Photoshop Elements 8 and guides you through the process of down-
loading images to your computer. I also show you how to organize your 
images and work with RAW files.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Retouching Your Portraits,” shows you how to digitally 
remove blemishes and enhance your subject’s eyes. I also show you how 
to remove your subject from the background and edit portraits of older 
subjects.
 
✓ Chapter 12, “Sharing Your Images,” shows you how to create prints of 
your portraits from Photoshop Elements. I also show you how to create 
print packages and contact sheets, and introduce you to a resource that 
turns your digital files into wall art.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The book concludes with three top ten lists, written by yours truly, who hap-
pens to have a gap between his teeth like David Letterman, who is famous for 
his top ten lists. The lists are grouped according to subject matter. A splendid 
time is guaranteed for all. And tonight, Mr. Kite is topping the bill.
 
✓ Chapter 13, “Ten Editing Tips and Tricks,” shows you how to replace a 
solid-color background, how to create a painting from an image, and how 
to create a vignette. You’ll also find seven other cool editing tips that are 
designed to make your images shine.
 
✓ Chapter 14, “Ten Photography Tips and Tricks,” shows you how to 
become a better photographer. I show you how to develop a style, 
create a self-portrait, and improvise when you don’t have everything 
with you but the kitchen sink.
 
✓ Chapter 15, “Ten Resources for Portrait Photographers,” shows you ten 
places where you can get stuff such as equipment, photo books, and 
much more.
Icons and Other Delights
For Dummies books have icons that contain important bits of information. 
You can hopscotch from icon to icon and get a lot of information. But when in 
doubt, read the text associated with the icon. In this book, you’ll find the fol-
lowing icons: 

4
Digital Portrait Photography For Dummies 
 
✓ A Tip icon contains information designed to save you time — and in 
some instances, your very sanity.
 
✓ This icon warns you about something you shouldn’t do, something 
your fearless author has already done and decided it’s not a good thing 
to do again.
 
✓ When you see this icon, it’s the equivalent of a virtual piece of string 
tied around your finger. This is information you may want to commit to 
memory.
You’ll also find icons in the margin that show you controls on your camera 
and Photoshop Elements tools you use to edit your image.
About the Software Shown in This Book
The software I recommend for downloading your images and editing them is 
Photoshop Elements 8. This is the baby brother to Photoshop. Photoshop 
Elements is bundled with many cameras. If you don’t have Photoshop 
Elements 8, which as of this writing is the latest and greatest version of the 
software, you’ll be glad to know you can still do many of the same techniques 
with earlier versions of the software. If you own a different image-editing 
application, you can still benefit from Part III, as many other photo-editing 
applications use the same tools.
Shoot Lots of Pictures and Enjoy!
As I mention at the start of this introduction, portrait photography is not 
rocket science. The old adage “practice makes perfect” does apply, though. 
Don’t expect to give this book a casual reading, try the techniques once or 
twice, and then park your camera in the closet until the next time someone 
asks you to take her picture. The only way to become a better photographer 
is to apply what you know and shoot as many pictures as you can. While 
you’re working your way through this book, keep your camera close at hand. 
When your wife or significant other pokes her head into the room, grab your 
camera and start practicing your craft. Take one picture, then another, and 
another, and so on. With practice, you’ll know your camera like the back of 
your hand. You’ll also know which rules of photography and composition 
work for you, and you’ll start to develop your own style. With practice, por-
trait photography will become second nature, and you’ll amaze your friends 
and relatives with the quality of your work. For that matter, you’ll probably 
amaze yourself, too.

Part I
Introducing Portrait 
Photography

In this part . . .
P
eople have been taking pictures of people 
since the invention of photography. 
Photographers have been taking pictures of 
people on crowded city streets, pictures of friends 
and family, and pictures that tell you something 
about a person. And when you capture a person’s 
essence with a photograph, you have truly taken a 
portrait of that person.
Many amateur photographers and some profes-
sionals think portrait photography is a daunting 
task, but it doesn’t have to be that way. In this 
part of the book, I introduce you to the different 
aspects of portrait photography. In addition, I dis-
cuss digital cameras and the settings you should 
use when shooting a portrait.

P
ortrait photography is fun and can become downright addictive. Armed 
with a good digital camera and a little or a lot of knowledge, portrait 
photography gives you the chance to capture a slice of history in a person’s 
life. When you photograph someone, you’re telling a story. Done right, por-
trait photography reveals a lot about a person. Whether you’re shooting a 
formal portrait with a background, photographing someone on location, or 
capturing a candid portrait, you’re telling your viewers something about your 
subject. A portrait should be a flattering likeness of your subject, 
which can be a bit of work. Portrait photography may seem 
like a daunting task, but it’s extremely rewarding. In this 
chapter, I show you the various facets of portrait photog-
raphy and give you an inkling of what’s to come.
Becoming a Portrait Photographer
A portrait is a picture that conveys a likeness of a 
person, especially his face. When someone views a 
good portrait of someone they know, the subject is 
instantly recognizable. When someone views a great 
portrait of anybody, even a stranger knows something 
about the subject. A great portrait reveals a person’s 
character, attitude, outlook on life, and so much more. 
When you create a portrait, your job is to reveal something 
about the person you photograph. When someone else looks 
at the photo and says you really captured the person’s essence, you know 
you’ve done your job. 

8
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Capturing a portrait that reveals more than a person’s physical likeness is 
easier if you know the person you’re photographing. However, you can still 
create a great portrait of a relative stranger if you take your time and estab-
lish rapport with the person. Creating a compelling portrait is more than just 
taking a picture. Talking with your subjects will reveal things they’re inter-
ested in. When you see the person’s expression change after talking about 
something they’re interested in, ask a couple of questions about the topic, 
and then start photographing.
After you engage your subject to bring out her best, another task you must 
tackle is getting your subject to relax. Unless your subject is a professional 
model, she’s going to be shy in front of the camera. The smiles may end up 
looking forced, the facial expressions phony, and so on. It’s like trying to get 
someone to smile after they’ve received a letter from the IRS telling them to 
report for a tax audit. Unless you’re shooting candid portraits of people at 
work or play, a portrait photography session takes time. As a portrait pho-
tographer, you must slow down, relax, and take your time. Give your subject 
the time she deserves. If your subject can’t seem to relax and is preoccupied 
with other thoughts, reschedule the shoot at a time that’s convenient for 
your subject.
Your job as a portrait photography is twofold: getting your subject to put on 
a happy face and knowing how to capture that happy face digitally for poster-
ity. To do those things, you must get to know your equipment — know how to 
light your subject, choose the right camera settings, and so on. 
Your first foray into portrait photography may be an outright disaster. If you’re 
not familiar with your equipment, you won’t be able to devote time to your 
subject. If you spend too much time fiddling with your equipment, your subject 
will quickly lose interest, and you won’t be able to capture a natural portrait. 
Let’s face it, some people need to be the center of attention, and this is espe-
cially true when you’re capturing a portrait of a person. Be prepared ahead of 
time, and your photo shoot will flow.
 
If you’re shooting a formal portrait, always set up your equipment and back-
drop before your subject arrives.
Photographing Friends and Family
Photographing people you know and love may seem like a piece of cake, but 
sometimes knowing the people you’re photographing makes the job harder. 
They may trivialize your interest in photography. They may look at you and 
think, “There he is with the camera again.” This is when you need to take con-
trol and let your subjects know that you’re a serious photographer, and your 
goal is to make them look their best. In these situations, you end up being 
coach, cheerleader, and task master.

 Chapter 1: Exploring Portrait Photography
Anybody can take a picture of a person. All you need to do is grab a camera, 
point it at the person, click the shutter, and you’ve got the shot. (Hmmm . . . 
guess that’s why some digital cameras are called point-and-shoot.) The way to 
get a good portrait is to find a great location, use the proper equipment with 
the right settings, and work with your subject(s). You’re the artist. You’ll have 
to tell your subject how to pose, tilt her head, and get her to put her best face 
forward. Natural smiles are a good thing. Forced grimaces do not make good 
portraits. When you’re shooting a portrait of a person on location, you need 
to pick the best area based on the scenery and available lighting. This may 
involve taking lots of pictures to get a few good ones. But that’s the beauty 
of digital photography. You can see what you’ve got on the LCD monitor and 
know whether you’ve captured the quintessential portrait of your subject or 
a picture that’s a candidate for the trash bin.
If you’re shooting a formal portrait of someone you know, you need to set 
up the shot, arrange the lighting, and choose the proper camera settings. 
In addition, you need to tell your subject what to do, pose him in a pleasing 
manner, and then put him at ease. Yes, it is a daunting task. That’s why the 
pros get big bucks for creating professional portraits.
 
Relax your subject and get her to laugh by telling her that the area in front of 
your camera is a “No Blink” zone.
When you decide to pursue portrait photography seriously, let your friends 
and family know your goals. They’ll be more supportive and won’t think 
you’re being a nuisance when you ask to take their pictures. In exchange for 
a portrait session, tell your subject he’ll get an 8 x 10 print of his favorite 
picture from the shoot. You can get quality prints from online printing com-
panies such as Mpix and Shutterfly. Another good idea is to create a small 
photo book of your best shots. Then when a photogenic family moves into 
the neighborhood, you can introduce yourself as the neighborhood portrait 
photographer. You can also use your brag book at parties and social func-
tions. When you show people a photo book of your best work, they’ll know 
you’re a serious photographer. Sweeten the deal with a free print and you’ve 
got another subject. I carry a 4-x-4-inch book of my portrait work with me at 
all times. Showing it to friends and colleagues has resulted in many interest-
ing photo opportunities. For online printing and photo book resources, see 
Chapter 15.
 
Your best shots generally come at the end of a session. Let your subject know 
ahead of time how long your session will run. As the session moves to a con-
clusion, your subject will become more comfortable in front of the camera.
Creating candid portraits
Candid portraits are wonderful. You capture people doing what they do 
best, having fun or just being themselves. When you shoot candid portraits, 

10
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
you’re like a fly on the wall. You’ve got the camera ready to go with all the 
right settings dialed in. Then when you see your subject doing something 
interesting, compose your picture, click the shutter button, and you’ve got 
an interesting photo.
You can create a candid portrait anywhere. If it’s your nephew’s first birthday 
party, make sure you’ve got your camera ready when he gets a piece of his 
birthday cake. You’ll end up with wonderful portraits of a laughing child with 
a mouthful of cake, frosting-streaked hair, and gooey fingers. Remember to 
capture a photo of the tyke’s parents hosing him off after the party. When the 
child grows older, his parents will appreciate the portrait, and the now-grown 
child may be interested in it — or embarrassed beyond belief.
To capture good candid portraits, take your camera with you wherever 
you go. In time, your family and friends will get used to the fact that you’ve 
always got a camera tethered to your neck, so they won’t always be on 
guard, which makes it much easier to catch them in the act of being 
themselves.
If you have a digital SLR (single-lens reflex) with a zoom lens that looks like 
a bazooka, you’ll have a hard time being the fly on the wall. If you fall into 
this category, I suggest getting a good point-and-shoot camera as a second 
camera. My Canon digital SLR looks quite intimidating with a telephoto 
zoom attached, so I have a small Canon point-and-shoot that I take with me 
when I’m running errands, or visiting friends. The point-and-shoot is rela-
tively innocuous, so I carry it with me wherever I go, even into restaurants. 
You never know when something interesting will happen. When I see some-
thing that piques my curiosity, I capture it digitally with my trusty point-
and-shoot. I show you all you need to know about buying a second camera 
in Chapter 3.
Creating formal portraits
Formal portraits are used for many things. Sometimes your subject wants a 
formal portrait to hang on the wall. At other times, a formal portrait is used 
for business purposes, such as a company brochure or business card. If one 
of your friends or relatives needs a portrait for business purposes, you can 
get the job done. A head shot or head-and-shoulders shot is the accepted 
format for formal business pictures. You can create formal portraits using a 
makeshift studio in your home, on location, or in your subject’s office. (See 
Figure 1-1.)
When you photograph any portrait, it’s important to light your subject cor-
rectly. An on-camera flash is never a good option for formal portraits. If you 
must use a flash, it’s best to bounce the flash off a white surface such as a 
nearby wall or the ceiling. You can also use a bounce card. Better yet, use two 
light sources. Portrait lighting is covered in detail in Chapter 7.

 Chapter 1: Exploring Portrait Photography
Figure 1-1: Creating a formal portrait at your subject’s workplace.
Capturing a slice-of-life portrait
Sometimes you can tell a lot about a person by photographing possessions 
that are special to the person. When you create this type of portrait, you 
don’t even need the person in the photograph. People who know the person 
will automatically connect her with the photograph based on what’s in the 
photo. I call this a slice-of-life portrait. In essence, it’s a still life that tells a lot 
a person, without really showing the person. I show you some techniques for 
creating a slice-of-life portrait in Chapter 9.
Photographing children
Kids do the darndest things, especially the young ones. But they can also 
be like a bull in a China shop, moving every which way but where you want 
them to move. Getting a child to sit still is like getting a straight answer from 

12
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
your congressman. And forget about the bit that children should be seen 
and not heard. If you’re photographing young children, you’ll hear them: The 
din can get rather loud. You may also have a failure to communicate. You 
get your best kid photographs when you photograph a child who knows and 
trusts you. If you can create a rapport with the child, or for that matter, any 
subjects, perhaps you will get the shots you’re after. Your best bet is to have 
the child’s parents at the shoot. They can stand behind you and get the child 
to do what you want her to. Maybe.
You’ll get some great shots if the child has something to occupy his atten-
tion. Props like a favorite stuffed toy, a blanket, or some candy gives the child 
something to interact with. (See Figure 1-2.) If you know the child, you can get 
some interesting photos by playing a game of hide and seek. When you find 
the child, snap a head-and-shoulders portrait that shows his gleeful expres-
sion and sense of innocence. If you want to create portraits of your kids, 
check out Chapter 6.
Figure 1-2: Bribing a child with candy.

 Chapter 1: Exploring Portrait Photography
Photographing pets
Unfortunately, pets have shorter lifespans then their human masters. When 
they are no longer with us, photos are all we have to help us remember our 
furry, feathered, or scaled friends. You can capture wonderful photos of your 
pet at play, or you can take more formal snapshots of your pet. Your pet’s 
patience and trust in you and your equipment will determine the quality of 
shot you can get. If your pet is trained, you can capture a great portrait with 
your digital camera. However, you’ll often get the best shots of your pet being 
his goofy self. If you’re photographing a friend’s pet, you’ll get better shots if 
the pet knows you. However, it’s always best to have the pet’s master present. 
She can tell the pet what to do based on your instructions.
Dogs can be great hams. A dog may pose for you, allow you to place a hat on 
his head, and so on. On the other hand, a cat tends to be aloof, turning away 
from the camera when you point it at her. But if you’re patient, you can get a 
great photo of your cat playing, or contemplating what’s on the other side of 
the window. Sometimes all you need to do is grab your camera when your cat’s 
snoozing, call her name, and click the shutter. (See Figure 1-3.) Another great 
shot you can get is a pet with her owner. The pet will be comfortable with her 
owner alongside. Kids and pets are also a recipe for wonderful photographs.
Figure 1-3: Photographing your cat can be a challenge.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Creating animal portraits
If you live near a zoo or a wildlife preserve, you can capture some wonderful 
photographs of animals. Armed with a digital SLR with a telephoto lens, or a 
point-and-shoot camera with a zoom lens that has a long focal length, you can 
get some great images. When you photograph at a zoo, you’re a safe distance 
from the animals. However, when you photograph animals in the wild, you 
must exercise caution. Recently, while I was photographing some gorgeous 
white egrets at the Venice Rookery, a representative from the Audubon Society 
told me about the Rookery’s resident alligator. When he saw I had a telephoto 
lens, he chuckled and told me he had to be on the lookout for tourists with 
point-and-shoot cameras that would try to walk within a few feet of the rep-
tile to take a picture. Alligators may seem lethargic, but they can move quite 
quickly when provoked. Always keep a safe distance from any wild animal, 
including cats and dogs that may be roaming in your neighborhood. I show you 
some useful techniques for photographing wildlife and animals in Chapter 6.
Shooting Portraits on Location
When you decide to capture a digital portrait, the next decision is where to 
take the picture. Studio-type photographs with a colorful background are 
great for business photographs and formal portraits. But you can also get 
some great shots by photographing people on location. I find that people 
have a tendency to be more relaxed when they’re outdoors. Recently I pho-
tographed a family at their home. I took most of the pictures outside of their 
home. The location was fantastic; their house was right on the water with 
lush foliage in the yard. I also took some photos inside their house, but the 
ones they liked best — the ones that were the most natural — were those 
that were taken outdoors. The family eventually ended up using one of the 
photos for their holiday greeting card.
Photographing people in parks and public places
Parks and scenic parts of town are wonderful places to create compelling 
portraits of anybody. The background is what makes photographs in a park 
or on a photogenic city street so special. When you photograph a person 
outdoors, your subject is the center of interest. A background that is in sharp 
focus gives the viewer too many details. Your job is to choose the proper lens 
and exposure settings to render the background as a pleasant out-of-focus 
blur. After all, you’re taking a picture of your subject, not the scenery.
Of course, when you shoot outdoors, lighting is very important. If you shoot 
in adverse lighting conditions such as direct sunlight at high noon, your sub-
ject will have harsh shadows on his face, which will reveal wrinkles, or char-
acter lines, if you will. If your subject is female, showing skin texture is never 
a good thing. Shooting at the right time of day usually ensures that you’ll get 

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Portrait Photography
a pleasing portrait. If the lighting is harsh, find some shade and use fill flash. 
(See Figure 1-4.) I show you how to enlighten your subjects with fill flash in 
Chapter 7.
Figure 1-4: Using fill flash to shed a little light on your subjects.
Photographing subjects at work and play
Another location in which you can photograph people is where they work or 
play. If you have a friend or relative who’s an attorney or architect, you can 
get some wonderful shots in his office, but this type of photo shoot can be 
quite challenging. You’ve got to work with the office lighting, which may be 
quite harsh, or use an external flash unit. In an office, distractions are abun-
dant during business hours. If your subject gets an important phone call, 
she’ll have to take it. This destroys the flow of the photo shoot. If the phone 
call is from an angry client, your subject will not be very photogenic when 
she returns. I remember photographing an attorney who had to answer an 
important phone call. The photo shoot was going great up to that point, but 
when he returned, I couldn’t get him to relax. His mind was on what trans-
pired over the phone, not on the photo shoot.

16
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Another great way to tell a story about your subject is to photograph him 
doing his favorite hobby. If your subject paints watercolor, for instance, pho-
tograph him while he’s painting. (See Figure 1-5.) The resulting photograph 
tells viewers a lot about your subject. Your subject will treasure the photo-
graph for years to come. 
Figure 1-5: Capture a portrait of someone at play.
Capturing Portraits in Your Home
If you’re like me, you have a camera nearby at all times. And even if you’re 
not like me, you should consider having a camera nearby at all times. You 
never know when a digital-photo moment will present itself. All you need to 
do is be observant.
Capturing candid photos in your home
Your job as the card-carrying photo geek is to digitally record the family 
history. You can be your own candid camera director, and your family and 
friends can be your stooges . . . er, I mean subjects. A candid portrait can be 

17
 Chapter 1: Exploring Portrait Photography
funny or serious. A candid portrait is not posed. As a photographer, you 
train yourself to look for interesting situations. When you’re at home, these 
happen when you least expect them. For example, you can capture a candid 
portrait of your wife in deep concentration as she prepares a meal. The pos-
sibilities are endless if you keep your eyes open.
Using studio techniques in your home
If you’ve been bitten by the studio bug, you want serious portraits with 
formal backgrounds and studio lighting. Renting a studio is expensive. 
However, with a bit of work, you can convert a room in your house to a home 
studio within minutes. All you need is a blank wall, a background, and some 
means of lighting your subject. Using these techniques, you get a portrait 
that looks like it was photographed in a studio. (See Figure 1-6.) I cover home 
studio techniques in Chapter 9.
Figure 1-6: Creating a studio portrait at home.

18
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Visualizing Your Photograph
Anybody can point a camera at something or somebody, press the shutter 
button, and create a photograph. The resulting photograph may or may not 
be good, but that’s not really photography. True photography involves more 
than just random chance. True photography requires you to study your sub-
ject and then visualize the resulting photograph in your mind’s eye. When 
you visualize the photograph, you know the focal length needed to capture 
your vision, the camera settings to use, and the vantage point from which to 
shoot your image. Only when all these decisions are made do you point the 
camera and press the shutter button.
Editing Your Work
After you get to know your camera like the back of your hand, and after you 
gain confidence in some of the techniques in this book, you’ll start taking a 
lot of pictures of people. This is where many amateur photographers lose it. 
They download gobs of photos to their computer hard drive and just leave 
them there. Computer image-editing software enables you to sort through 
your images and organize them. After all, do you really want to search 
through a couple of hundred — or thousand — photos to locate the image of 
Aunt Molly that you photographed sometime last year? If you use Photoshop 
Elements to download and organize your photos, and follow the workflow I 
suggest in Chapter 10, you’ll be able to find specific images in no time flat.
Back in the days of film, photographers edited their work in darkrooms. An 
image-editing application like Photoshop Elements is your digital darkroom. 
Within your digital darkroom you have the tools to retouch your photos 
and much more. This comes in handy if you capture some great pictures of 
your son that are perfect with the exception of a few pimples. You can easily 
remove the pimples and apply other enhancements to the photo using the 
techniques I show you in Chapter 11. After you’ve edited your images to 
pixel perfection, you can print them using Photoshop Elements and a printer 
attached to your computer as shown in Chapter 12. Or you can use an online 
printer like one of the ones I mention in Chapter 15.

T
o create good portraits, you’ve got to have the right stuff. You can’t take 
good pictures without a good camera, good optics, and the right light-
ing equipment. And of course, you’ve got to have more than just the basics 
if you’re going to create good portraits. At some point in time, you’ve got to 
shed some light on your subjects. I strongly recommend that you don’t use 
the on-camera flash. Can you say “red-eye?” I knew you could. And you’ll 
need other accessories as well, if you’re going to be a serious (or 
even semi-serious) portrait photographer. In this chapter, I 
show you what I think is essential for portrait photogra-
phy. I cover digital SLRs and point-and-shoot cameras.
Finding the Ideal Camera 
for Your Needs
There are lots of digital cameras on the market. 
All of them will give you digital images, but there 
are a lot of other elements to consider. It pays to be 
prepared and know your stuff — if you let your local 
camera-store salesman make the choice, you may end 
up with too much or too little camera. 
Digital cameras come in two flavors: point-and-shoot cameras, 
and digital SLR (Single Lens Reflex) cameras. A point-and-shoot camera 
is fully contained, complete with a telephoto zoom lens and built-in flash. 
As the name implies, all you need to do is point the camera at something or 
someone, compose the image, and then shoot. On the other hand, a digital 
SLR has only the camera body. You attach the desired lens, which can be 

20
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
anything from an ultra-wide angle lens that captures a wide expanse of the 
scene before you or a telephoto lens with a long focal length that lets you 
get up close and personal with your subject. Some digital SLRs have built-in 
flash units and a hot shoe that enables you to connect a more powerful aux-
iliary flash to the camera. The following sections are designed to make you a 
better-educated consumer when you’re shopping for the digital portrait pho-
tography camera that’s best suited for your needs.
Portrait photography camera checklist
Do you make lists? I make need-to-buy lists for the various odds and ends I 
need at home. And then I forget to take them with me when I go shopping. 
But I’m fastidious when it comes to my photography. I have checklists for 
everything. The following is a list of things to consider when purchasing a 
camera for portrait photography:
 
✓ If purchasing a camera with a built-in flash, does it come with a hot 
shoe? An on-camera flash is very harsh. A hot shoe (which is a mount 
to which you can attach an external flash unit) gives you the option of 
using an auxiliary flash unit that slides into the hot shoe and communi-
cates with the camera.
 
✓ If you’re purchasing a point-and-shoot camera, does it have a telephoto 
lens with a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm? This is 
considered the ideal focal length for a head-and-shoulders portrait shot. 
For more information on determining the 35mm equivalent of any focal 
length, refer to the “What’s my focal length multiplier?” section of this 
chapter.
 
✓ Does the camera you’re considering have a mode dial with either 
Portrait or Aperture Priority mode? Portrait mode attempts to give you 
an image where your subject is in sharp focus, but the background is 
blurred. The amount of the image that is apparently in focus is known as 
the depth of field. In portrait photography, you want a shallow depth of 
field. Your camera’s ability to deliver a shallow depth of field in Portrait 
mode is dependent on the current lighting conditions. When you’re 
taking pictures in bright conditions, Portrait mode won’t always give you 
a shallow depth of field. You get much more control over depth of field 
using Aperture Priority mode. Aperture Priority mode lets you choose 
the desired aperture, and the camera calculates the shutter speed for a 
properly exposed picture based on lighting conditions. For more infor-
mation on depth of field, refer to Chapter 3.
 
✓ If you’re purchasing a point-and-shoot camera, does it have threads at 
the front of the lens for attaching filters? You can use accessory filters 
to control the amount of light entering the camera, change the color 
characteristics of the light, add special effects to your images, and so on.

21
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
 
✓ Does the camera feature exposure compensation? This feature gives 
you the option of manually increasing or decreasing the exposure, or the 
amount of light that reaches the camera sensor. This option is useful 
when you’re taking pictures in tricky light conditions, such as when the 
sun is behind your subject — or backlighting, in photographer-speak.
 
✓ Does the camera give you the option to display a histogram? A histo-
gram shows the distribution of pixels from shadows to highlights. When 
you read a histogram, you can tell whether a shot is overexposed (the 
highlights are blown out to pure white) or underexposed (there are not 
enough pixels in the highlight areas of the histogram, which creates an 
image darker than the actual scene). You can then adjust the exposure 
accordingly using exposure compensation.
 
✓ Does the camera have a bright LCD monitor? If you shoot portraits out-
doors, a bright monitor makes it easier to see your shots and any other 
information displayed about the image.
Choosing a point-and-shoot camera 
If you’re a beginning photographer, the obvious place to start is with a point-
and-shoot camera. There are many varieties of point-and-shoot cameras, but 
in order to capture compelling portraits, you need more than just a garden-
variety point-and-shoot camera. You can see two of the better point-and-
shoot cameras in Figure 2-1. The camera you choose needs good optics and 
the option to manually choose a shooting mode. A camera lens with good 
optics has multiple elements. The lens elements are coated for better light 
dispersion and protection against anomalies like lens flares.
Figure 2-1: Point-and-shoot cameras for portrait photography.

22
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Here are some things to consider when looking for a point-and-shoot digital 
camera:
 
✓ Does the camera offer advanced shooting modes? This feature gives you 
the option of choosing how the camera determines exposure, but you 
don’t have to master all of the variables at once. You can set the aperture, 
and the camera determines the proper shutter speed for a perfect expo-
sure. Or you can choose the shutter speed, and the camera chooses the 
proper aperture for a perfect exposure. (Chapter 3 tells you how aperture 
and shutter speed combine to make a perfectly exposed image.) Another 
handy option for portrait photographers is a camera with a Portrait mode, 
which chooses both aperture and shutter speed for you.
 
✓ Does the camera have a hot shoe? A hot shoe accepts an external flash 
unit. On-camera flash is very limited — the light is not good for portrait 
photography. When you need to augment natural light, or rely on a flash 
to provide all lighting, you have much better control with an external 
flash unit.
 
✓ What is the focal length range of the camera lens? A good range for 
general and portrait photography includes focal lengths that are the 
35mm equivalents from 28mm to 140mm.
 
✓ Does the camera feature image stabilization? This option makes it pos-
sible for you to take pictures without a tripod at slow shutter speeds. 
Cameras with image stabilization give you the capability of shooting up 
to three exposure values lower than you can with an equivalent camera 
without image stabilization. Many cameras with image stabilization flash 
a warning icon if the shutter speed is too slow to produce a sharp image. 
Another benefit of image stabilization is that you can shoot pictures at 
a lower ISO setting (see Chapter 3), which means you’ll get images with 
less digital noise. Digital noise comes in two flavors: color (random color 
specs in areas of solid color like blue skies) and luminance (random gray 
colored specks in areas with even tone such as shadows).
 
✓ Does the camera have the option to capture images in the RAW 
format? When you process a RAW image, you’re working with the data 
the camera sensor captured. The RAW format, then, is like a digital nega-
tive: It gives you more control over the resulting image. 
 
 If the camera doesn’t allow you to capture images in RAW format, the 
camera processes the image as a JPEG file, which is more difficult to 
work with. This can result in problems when you’re taking pictures in 
difficult lighting conditions because you have limited options for fixing 
a JPEG image. The RAW format, on the other hand, offers a lot of flexibil-
ity when you process images. For more information on processing RAW 
images, see Chapter 10.
 
✓ What is the minimum and maximum ISO setting for the camera? Lower 
ISO settings give great image quality, but the sensor needs more light. 
Higher ISO settings means the camera is more sensitive to light, and you 

23
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
can capture images in low-light situations. However, high ISO settings 
also introduce digital noise to your images, which is very noticeable 
when you’re capturing images with a point-and-shoot camera that has a 
small sensor. 
 
✓ What is the maximum resolution, in megapixels? There are some point-
and-shoot cameras with 15-megapixel resolution. However, when you 
cram 15 megapixels on a sensor that’s the size of your pinky fingernail, 
you’re dealing with small pixels indeed — much smaller than those on a 
digital SLR that has the same resolution on a bigger sensor. That means 
that the images shot at the same resolution on a smaller sensor won’t be 
as crisp or sharp when you enlarge them.
 
✓ Does the camera have a movie mode? This option is useful when you 
want to create slide shows of images and have some live video. You can 
easily create slide shows in applications like Movie Maker (Windows) or 
iMovie (Mac). Some digital cameras even offer HD (high definition) video.
 
✓ Will the camera accept accessory filters? Accessory filters can change 
the look of the image, change the amount of light entering the camera, 
and so on.
 
✓ Does the camera have a noticeable shutter lag? This is the amount 
of time it takes the camera to capture the picture after you press the 
shutter button. If there’s a noticeable lag, you may end up missing 
some great candid shots. After your subject realizes you have a camera 
pointed at her, she may change her expression and your shot is lost. 
When you try a camera out in a store, notice the amount of time it takes 
the camera to respond after you press the shutter button. You can also 
find information on shutter lag by reading camera reviews.
 
✓ If the camera captures RAW images, how long does it take the camera 
to record the image to the memory card? If it takes a long time, you’ll 
end up filling the camera buffer (built-in memory) after a couple of shots, 
and you’ll have to wait until the images are written to the memory card 
before you can take more shots.
 
✓ What is the aperture range of the lens? The aperture determines how 
much light enters the camera. The aperture also determines the depth 
of field. Small f-stop numbers let in large amounts of light, and large 
f-stop numbers let in small amounts of light. Smaller f-stop numbers 
give you a shallower depth of field (the area of the image that is in sharp 
focus), which is ideal for portrait photography. However, because a 
small sensor means shorter focal lengths, point-and-shoot cameras have 
an incredibly large depth of field. Your best bet is to get a camera that 
has an f-stop of 2.8 or smaller. The maximum aperture is listed with the 
focal length of the lens. For example, if you’re considering purchasing an 
85mm f/1.8 lens, 85 mm tells you it’s a moderate telephoto, and f/1.8 tells 
you that the lens has a large maximum aperture.

Choosing a digital SLR
A digital SLR (single-lens reflex) is what I consider the ideal camera for por-
trait photography. A digital SLR is equipped with a larger sensor than those 
in point-and-shoot cameras, and you can take advantage of a plethora of 
lenses from both the camera manufacturer and third-party lens makers. If you 
previously recorded photos on film — you know, the stuff that came in plastic 
containers that you had to pay for? — and used a 35mm camera, a digital SLR 
(see Figure 2-2) is right up your alley.
Figure 2-2: Digital SLRs are very versatile.
Here are a few things to consider when purchasing a digital SLR:
 
✓ Is the camera equipped with a sensor cleaner? When you change the 
lens on a digital SLR, you run the risk of getting some dust on the sensor 
and other objects behind the lens. Dust on your sensor shows up as 
black specks in large areas of the same color, such as a bright blue sky. 
Many of the newer digital SLRs vibrate the sensor when the camera is 
turned on and off, which shakes any dust particles off the sensor.
 
✓ Does the camera come with a lens? To competitively price a camera kit 
(the camera body plus a lens), some manufacturers include a lens that 
isn’t fast and doesn’t have great optical characteristics. If the camera 
comes with a lens, read reviews to see how the kit lens is rated. Better 
yet, buy just the camera body and then buy a higher quality lens made 
by the camera manufacturer. You’ll get better pictures with better glass.

25
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
 
✓ Will the camera work with lenses you already own? If you’re upgrading 
your camera, or finally making the transition from a film camera, make 
sure your old lenses will work on the new camera.
 
✓ What is the camera resolution in megapixels? When you buy a digital 
SLR, the larger sensor enables you to use lots of megapixels to their best 
effect. If you’re going to create prints larger than 11 x 17 inches from 
your images, get a camera that can capture 12 megapixels or greater.
 
✓ Does the camera have a full-frame sensor? This factor determines the 
focal length of the lenses you buy to achieve a given angle of view. When a 
sensor is smaller than 24 x 36 millimeters (the size of a 35mm film frame), 
the light from the rear of the lens strikes a smaller area, which makes the 
picture look like it was taken with a longer focal length. To find the 35mm 
equivalent of a lens on your camera, you need to know the focal length 
multiplier. For more information on the focal length multiplier, see the 
“What’s my focal length multiplier?” sidebar in this chapter.
 
 If you’re buying your first digital SLR and you’re a 35mm film camera 
convert, consider buying a camera with a full-frame sensor so you’ll be 
able to use your existing lenses at their “true” focal lengths.
 
✓ Does the camera have Live View? This enables you to compose a pic-
ture through the camera’s LCD monitor. This is a nice option, but not a 
necessity for portrait photography.
The megapixel myth
Digital cameras are technological miracles. 
Many of them are small enough to fit in your 
shirt pocket. Most point-and-shoot cameras 
come with built-in flash units and telephoto 
zoom lenses. But with this miniaturization come 
problems. The sensor on a point-and-shoot 
camera is much smaller than the sensor on a 
digital SLR, so the pixels are smaller as well. 
When you enlarge an image from a camera with 
a small sensor, it’s not as sharp or crisp as one 
from a camera with the same megapixel resolu-
tion but a larger sensor. For example, a Canon 
G10 point-and-shoot camera with a 14.7 mega-
pixel resolution has a sensor that measures 
7.6 x 5.7 millimeters, which equates to a pixel 
density of 34 megapixels per square centimeter. 
A Canon EOS 50D digital SLR with a 15.1 mega-
pixel resolution has a sensor with dimensions of 
22.3 x 14.9 millimeters, which results in a pixel 
density of 4.5 megapixels per square centime-
ter. The original Canon EOS 5D has a resolu-
tion of 12.7 megapixels. This camera’s sensor 
measures 36 x 24 millimeters, the same size as 
a frame of 35mm film, which means it has a pixel 
density of 1.5 megapixels per square centimeter. 
As you can see by this comparison, the G10 has 
the smallest pixel size of the lot. Even though it 
has more megapixels than the original EOS 5D, 
the latter will deliver sharper pictures.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Choosing a second camera
If you own a digital SLR and a case full of lenses, you’re probably reluctant to 
carry the camera with you at all times. Possibly, potential theft plays a role. 
After all, there are a lot of people out there who would break into a car to steal 
an expensive camera. One solution is to purchase a cheaper second camera. 
To address this problem, I bought a sophisticated point-and-shoot camera 
that had many of the same features as my digital SLR. My point-and-shoot, in 
fact, was made by the same company that made my digital SLR. When you’re 
shopping for a second camera, here are some things to consider:
 
✓ Does the camera enable you to capture images in a RAW format that 
is supported by your image-editing application? It’s not essential to 
capture your images in the RAW format, but this format gives you more 
flexibility when you process your images.
 
✓ Is the camera menu similar to that of your digital SLR? There’s no 
sense in having to retrain yourself every time you pick up your second 
camera.
 
✓ Does the camera take the same type of memory card as your primary 
camera? This saves you the expense of purchasing different memory 
cards.
Trying before you buy
In today’s economy, everyone wants to get the best deal possible. But you 
also need to purchase your equipment from a reputable source. The old-
fashioned mom-and-pop camera shops have all but faded from history, which 
leads many people to believe they can get the best deal online only. The 
dilemma with buying online is that you don’t know what you’re getting until 
you open the box and start using the camera. If you’re determined to buy 
from an online retailer, try the camera out at a local retailer first. The camera 
may get accolades from every review site out there, but if it’s not comfortable 
to work with, or the controls are too big or too small, you won’t use it that 
often. When you try the camera, do these things:
Researching your camera purchase online
You can find some great information about 
cameras online. Many online camera retailers 
let readers post reviews based on their experi-
ence with a camera. There are also Web sites 
that specialize in digital photography and post 
authoritative reviews on cameras. If you’ve 
narrowed your choices down to a few cam-
eras, go to your favorite search engine, enter 
the model of each camera on your list followed 
by the word “review.” Or you can cut to the 
chase and go to my favorite resource for digital 
camera reviews: www.dpreview.com.

27
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
 
✓ Make sure the controls are easy to find and easy to use.
 
✓ Make sure you can understand the menu.
 
✓ Make sure the camera is comfortable and easy to handle. Imagine what 
the camera will feel like after using it for a few hours.
 
✓ Shoot some pictures with the camera. When you do your test shots, 
make sure you use different ISO settings.
 
✓ If the camera salesperson isn’t too busy, ask to see the images on a 
computer. View the images at 100 percent magnification and pan to 
the shadow areas of the image. Look for any evidence of digital noise 
on the images you shot at high ISO settings. Digital noise shows up as 
random clumps of color or gray clumps. For those of you coming from 
a film background, digital noise should not be confused with film grain. 
Film grain has a definite pattern and could be used in an artistic manner. 
Digital noise is random and not at all artistic.
 
✓ Look at the LCD monitor in bright light and make sure you can still 
read the menu options, see images clearly, and so on.
 
✓ If the camera has an electronic viewfinder, point it at a bright light 
source and notice if you can still accurately compose the scene. On some 
cameras, you may notice the view is distorted and the bright light source 
looks like a bright star that obscures the rest of the objects in the scene.
 
✓ Notice the shutter lag. Shutter lag is the amount of time it takes the 
camera to take the picture after you press the shutter button. Does the 
camera have any noticeable shutter lag? If the lag time is long, you run 
the risk of missing spontaneous shots.
Lighting Your Portraits
A picture is a combination of colors, light and dark shades, shadows, and 
light. The way you use the light determines whether you get a compelling 
photograph or something that is washed out with no detail. There are several 
ways you can light a scene, some of them great, and some of them very bad. 
In the following sections, I introduce you to the preferred ways to light your 
subjects. I give you the Full Monty about lighting in Chapter 7.
Using available light
Available light is just that: the light that’s available in the area in which you’re 
going to shoot your portrait. If you’re shooting a portrait on location, you 
may have multiple lighting sources: fluorescent lights, tungsten lights, and 
natural light. When you end up with a hodge-podge like this, you trust your 
camera to sort it all out. Or not. The human eye perceives the color white 
correctly under any light. Your camera determines the lighting source, and 
makes changes to render white correctly. This is known as white balance. 

28
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
When you’re photographing a subject under mixed light sources, the camera 
may not get the white balance correct and the resulting pictures may have 
your subjects looking a little green under the gills. You can improve the situ-
ation by turning off room lights, moving your subject to a different location, 
and so on. Or you can manually set the white balance.
By far the best type of available light is natural light. On a cloudy day you get 
wonderful diffuse light, which is perfect for photographing people. On a bright 
sunny day, you can also get some wonderful portraits, but you need to modify 
the light in order to diffuse it. Or you can move your subject to an area with 
open shade on a bright sunny day. You can also direct the light toward your 
subject with store-bought or makeshift reflectors. But by far, the nicest avail-
able light is diffuse light coming through a window. (See Figure 2-3.)
Lighting with commercial strobes
Professional portrait photographers with studios have the right stuff. They 
have strobes, multiple backgrounds, backdrops that look like brick walls and 
so forth. One way to get studio-type portraits is to rent some studio space, 
but that gets expensive. Fortunately, there are alternatives.
You can get shots like the pros if you learn how to use light and set up a 
studio in your home. All you need is a large enough living room that you can 
convert into a studio. If you do your homework, you can get a two-strobe 
lighting system with stands and umbrellas for a reasonable price. (See Figure 
2-4.) I show you some of the things you need to know about setting up a 
home studio in Chapter 9.
Using external flash
The flash that’s attached to your camera is next to worthless. It throws out 
a short burst of light that fades away just a few feet from the camera. This 
harsh light doesn’t model faces well. You end up with very flat lighting with 
no contrast. You also end up with the dreaded red-eye, which is caused when 
the light bounces off blood vessels in the interior of your subject’s eyes. 
Many cameras have built-in red-eye reduction, but the cure is often worse 
than the disease. You can also remove red-eye in image-editing applications 
like Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, but the best way to cure red-eye is 
to avoid it.
You have much better control when you use one or more external flash 
units — also known as speedlites — to light your scene. Using an external 
flash unit isn’t rocket science — that is, of course, unless you want it to be. 
When you mount an external flash unit designed to work with your camera 
in the hot shoe, the camera and flash unit do the math and decide how 
many photons of light are needed to properly expose the image. And this 
dynamic duo also works quite well if you swivel the flash head and bounce 

29
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
the flash off the ceiling or the wall. Talk about components that work and 
play well together! When choosing a speedlite for your camera, make sure 
it’s compatible. Another nice option for a speedlite is the ability to manu-
ally adjust the settings. I illuminate you regarding the subject of speedlites 
in Chapter 7. Figure 2-5 shows a couple of flash units for Canon cameras.
Figure 2-3: Diffuse window light is wonderful for portrait photography.

Choosing Accessories
Having a digital camera without accessories is like owning a Porsche and not 
having a Rolex on your wrist. The right accessories can make your photog-
raphy experience more enjoyable. For example, although it has the manufac-
turer’s name on it, the standard camera strap is very thin. After lugging the 
camera around for a couple of hours, that strap will begin to feel like a gar-
rote, especially if the camera is a digital SLR with a telephoto lens. A wider-
cushioned lens strap is one of the first accessories I always get when I buy a 
new camera. (See Figure 2-6.) And after you get a few accessories, you’ve got 
to have a place to store your stuff, and for that matter, your camera. In the 
upcoming sections, I share some of my thoughts on accessories for digital 
portrait photographers.
Figure 2-6: The right accessories make your life as a photographer easier.
Choosing additional lenses for your dSLR
If you bought a digital SLR kit, you ended up with a kit lens that is, well, a kit 
lens. In other words, the lens is a compromise. It’s not the brightest glass in 
the chandelier. But the lens coupled with the camera body has an attractive 
price that entices people like you and me to buy the kit. Additionally, kit lenses 
aren’t fast. A fast lens has a large opening (small f-stop number) that lets in a 
lot of light and creates a nice, blurry, out-of-focus background — exactly what 
the doctor ordered when it comes to portrait photography. If you have a digital 
SLR with a sensor size smaller than a full frame of 35mm film, another prob-
lem crops up: additional depth of field. That’s right — smaller sensors have 

32
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
a greater depth of field, something that’s not desirable when you’re shooting 
a portrait of someone. So the Rx for great portrait photography is fast, high-
quality optics.
Lenses come in two flavors: prime and zoom. A prime lens has one — count 
’em — focal length. That’s right; you can’t zoom in or out. Old-school pho-
tographers use something called foot zoom when working with a prime lens. 
Foot zoom won’t burn many calories, but done properly, it will strengthen 
your calf muscles.
When you’re shooting portraits, your best focal length range starts at the 
35mm equivalent of 85mm. This is considered by many photographers, includ-
ing your friendly author, to be the best focal length for head-and-shoulders 
portraits. You also want a fast lens (one with a small f-stop number). So your 
best bet is to get an 85mm f/1.8 lens. There are faster 85mm lenses, but the 
f/1.8 is affordable for mere mortals like you and me. I recently spoke with a 
Canon rep regarding their 85mm f/1.2 lens — a lens that costs more than some 
big-screen TVs. With it, you can shoot pictures in very dark conditions, but the 
rep told me it was too sharp for portrait photographers. So save your nickels 
and dimes and buy the best quality 85mm f/1.8 you can afford, or buy a fast 
zoom lens that has the 85mm focal length in its range. Figure 2-7 shows a zoom 
lens that fits Canon digital SLRs.
 
All focal lengths mentioned in this book are 35mm equivalents. If your camera 
has a sensor with dimensions smaller than a frame of 35mm film, you have to 
factor in the camera’s focal length multiplier to get the 35mm equivalent for 
that lens on your camera. 
If you’re buying a zoom telephoto lens for portrait photography, make sure 
the 85mm focal length is included in the zoom range. A good all-around zoom 
lens includes a range from 28mm to 105mm. Just remember not to shoot any 
portraits using the wide-angle focal lengths, which put you very close to your 
subject. Being close to friends is a good thing when you’re socializing, but it’s 
a bad thing when you’re taking pictures. Your subject will not appreciate the 
fact that her nose looks like it’s bigger than an orange. If you do this kind of 
photography, your friends may never let you get close to them again.
Seeing in a different way
Film wedding and portrait photographers used 
a Holga camera to create an image that had 
vignetting, light streaks, and a sweet spot of 
focus. The Holga look was revered by photog-
raphers and clients that wanted dreamy looking 
romantic photos in addition to other photos of 
the wedding that were sharp and crystal clear. 
Then the digital age came along and photogra-
phers got very precise and crisp images. One 
wedding and portrait photographer named Craig 

33
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
Strong wanted the Holga look when shooting 
digital. So he started experimenting with vari-
ous optics connected to a camera mounted 
with vacuum cleaner hose and held together 
with duct tape — the universal quicker-
fixer-upper for just about everything. When his 
experimentation yielded photos with the look 
he wanted, he then figured out a way to mass 
produce his brainchild, and the Lensbaby was 
born. The original Lensbaby, which debuted in 
2004, had a single glass optic attached to the 
camera mount with a flexible hose. Aperture 
inserts were used to control the amount of light 
entering the camera. The aperture insert also 
controlled how large the sweet spot of focus 
was in the resulting image. (The smaller the 
f-stop, the smaller the sweet spot of focus.) The 
latest iteration of Lensbaby lenses ship with a 
coated doublet lens, which gives you a sharp 
image at the sweet spot of focus. You can pur-
chase an optic kit that contains a plastic optic, 
a single glass optic, and a pinhole/zoneplate 
optic. You change the aperture disc with a 
magnetic tool that is included. You can also tilt 
the lens to move the sweet spot of focus to the 
desired area of your image. I’ve been using the 
Lensbaby Composer for several weeks. It has 
a ball-and-socket arrangement with a focus 
ring that enables you to precisely compose the 
sweet spot of focus. I use the lens for every 
type of photography, including wedding and 
portrait photography. Visit the Lensbaby Web 
site www.lensbaby.com for tutorials, stun-
ning photo galleries of images photographed 
with Lensbaby lenses, and more information on 
Lensbaby products.

34
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Figure 2-7: Accessory lenses are a wonderful thing.
In addition to buying digital SLR lenses made by your camera manufacturer, 
you can also purchase lenses made by other manufacturers that will mount 
on your camera. The age-old wisdom of trying before you buy or at least 
reading a couple of impartial reviews applies here. You can find reviews by 
typing the manufacturer and model of the lens followed by the word review 
in your favorite search engine. Figure 2-8 shows a variety of lenses manufac-
tured by Tamron.
Using filters
If you were really into 35mm film photography, you had a grab bag full of 
goodies, including filters. Filters are used to create special effects and manip-
ulate the light coming into your camera. When you want to use a filter, you 
screw it into the accessory threads on the end of your lens. Digital SLR lenses 
have accessory threads, and some point-and-shoot cameras have them as 
well. Here’s a list of filters that are useful for portrait photography:

35
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
Figure 2-8: You can find third-party lenses to fit your camera.
 
✓ Skylight filter: A skylight filter slightly warms the colors in your image. 
Many photographers permanently affix a skylight filter to every lens 
they own for protection.
 
✓ Polarizing filter: This filter is great if you do portrait photography out-
doors. It deepens the blue hues in the sky and makes clouds look more 
prominent. It also reduces or eliminates glare, a useful option if light 
is reflecting off your subject’s glasses. You rotate the outer ring of the 
polarizing filter until you get the effect you’re after.
 
✓ Neutral-density filter: Neutral-density filters come in different strengths 
and reduce the amount of light entering the camera, which enables you 
to shoot at lower f-stops in bright lighting conditions. A lower f-stop 
gives you a smaller depth of field, which is ideal for portrait photogra-
phy. Some digital point-and-shoot cameras have a neutral-density option 
on the camera menu, which lessens the amount of light reaching the 
sensor. Check with your camera salesman to see if this feature is avail-
able on the camera you are considering purchasing. 
 
✓ Soft-focus filter: A soft-focus filter is a great accessory when you’re cre-
ating head-and-shoulders portraits. A soft-focus filter maintains image 
sharpness but lowers contrast. The filter also diffuses details like skin 
texture and wrinkles to give your portrait a more pleasing appearance. 
Soft-focus filters come in varying strengths. Use a filter with low diffu-
sion for younger subjects and a filter with high diffusion for older sub-
jects. Don’t use a soft-focus filter when shooting someone with character 
lines like Clint Eastwood. As a rule, I use a soft-focus filter only when 
photographing a woman.

36
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
Lenses come with different accessory thread sizes. Purchase filters for the 
lens with the largest accessory thread size, and then purchase step-up rings 
that enable you to use the large filters on all of your lenses. A step-up ring 
has a small inner ring with male threads to attach to the lens and a larger 
outer ring with female threads into which you insert the filter.
Steadying the camera with a tripod
Holding the camera steady and not shooting below a shutter speed that is 
the reciprocal of the focal length you’re using results in a sharp image. If you 
shoot with a digital SLR lens or camera that has image stabilization, you can 
shoot a couple of f-stops lower. But when you’re shooting in very low light 
conditions, or shooting portraits with diffuse window light, your only solu-
tion is to crank up the ISO, or put the camera on a tripod. A tripod is always 
a better solution, especially when you’re shooting portraits with a camera 
that has a small sensor. Figure 2-9 shows a tripod for a small point-and-shoot 
camera beside a tripod for a digital SLR.
What’s my focal length multiplier?
If you own a camera with a sensor smaller than 
a frame of 35mm film (36 x 24 millimeters), the 
sensor records only part of what the lens cap-
tures. The net result is that the lens acts like a 
longer focal length would on a full-frame sensor. 
The focal length multiplier depends on the size of 
your camera’s sensor in relation to a full-frame 
sensor. The focal length multiplier generally 
falls in a range from 1.3 to 2.0. If you slap a lens 
with a 50mm focal length on a camera with a 
focal length multiplier of 1.3, the resulting 35mm 
equivalent is 65mm (35 × 1.3). Put the same lens 
on a camera with a focal length multiplier of 1.6 
and you end up with a 35mm equivalent of 80mm 
(35 × 1.6). It’s important to know your camera’s 
focal length multiplier when choosing acces-
sory lenses for your camera. 
Creating a homemade soft-focus filter
If you’re a do-it-yourself kind of photographer, 
you can easily create a soft-focus filter using 
stuff you can find in your house. One way to 
create a soft-focus filter is to cut a piece of 
white pantyhose slightly larger than your lens. 
Stretch the fabric over your lens, and hold it in 
place with a rubber band. Another way you can 
make a soft-focus filter is to stretch a piece of 
plastic wrap over your camera lens. Make sure 
the plastic is taut and has no wrinkles. Use a 
rubber band to hold the plastic in place. Dip 
your finger in olive oil, and coat the plastic with 
it. You’ll get different diffusion effects depending 
on the direction you smear the oil on the plastic. 
Try distributing it diagonally and in a circle. Yet 
another method is to smear petroleum jelly over 
a cheap skylight filter. The amount of jelly deter-
mines the amount of diffusion you get.

37
 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
Figure 2-9: Steady your camera with a tripod.
Here are some things to consider when purchasing a tripod:
 
✓ How much weight will the tripod support? The tripod needs to support 
the weight of your camera. If you use a digital SLR, the tripod needs to 
support the weight of your camera body and your heaviest lens. To be 
on the safe side, include a fudge factor of 20 percent. You never know 

38
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
when a manufacturer is being optimistic with data. The fudge factor 
will also accommodate a heavier camera if you upgrade, or if you add a 
heavier lens to your digital photography arsenal.
 
✓ How heavy is the tripod? If you use the tripod at home only, weight isn’t 
a factor. However, if you’re going to be lugging it around on vacation, or 
shooting portraits on location, consider one of the low-weight tripods.
 
✓ Are you using the tripod outdoors? If so, look for a tripod that has 
retractable rubber feet that reveal a sharp stainless steel spike. Retract the 
feet and push the tripod into the ground. The spikes anchor the tripod.
 
✓ Does the tripod have a spirit level? This device makes it possible for 
you to level the tripod, which means you’ll get level horizon lines in your 
photos.
 
✓ Does the tripod have a quick-release platform on top of the head? This 
option is handy when you’re attaching a camera to a tripod. Instead of 
attaching the camera to the head and the tripod, you’re attaching the 
tripod to the platform, which is much easier to do. 
 
✓ What is the maximum extended height of the tripod? Make sure it’s tall 
enough for any scenario you’re likely to encounter.
 
✓ What is the folded length of the tripod? This factor is important if you 
intend to travel with your tripod. If this is the case, make sure it will fit in 
your luggage.
 
✓ Is it easy to lock and unlock the legs? The better tripods have a twist 
lock or a lever.
 
Purchase a carrying case for your tripod. Sling the carrying case with the 
tripod over your shoulder when you’re shooting on location and will be 
moving around. It’s much easier than lugging the tripod around without 
a case.
There are lots of tripod manufacturers. It’s a good idea to look at a tripod and 
try the controls before you buy it. Many superstores have camera depart-
ments with tripods at reasonable prices.
Using a monopod
Another option for steadying your camera is a monopod, which has a single 
telescoping leg. You unlock a section to extend the monopod, and then lock 
the section when the device is at the desired height. Repeat with the other 
sections until the monopod is at the desired height. A monopod features a 
wrist strap. Some monopods also feature a retractable set of legs (a mini-
tripod, if you will), or a retractable rubber foot and spike. When the monopod 
is extended, compose your picture and then pull down on the wrist strap to

 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
steady the camera. If you decide to buy a mono-
pod, make sure it will support the weight of 
your camera and that it’s lightweight and easy 
to use. Figure 2-10 shows a monopod manufac-
tured by Sunpak.
Choosing a camera case
You may have a point-and-shoot camera small 
enough to put in your hip pocket, but (if you’re 
like me) you have more camera gear then the 
law allows. If you own a digital SLR, a couple 
of lenses, and accessories, a camera bag is a 
necessity. But even if all you have is a miniscule 
point-and-shoot camera and a lens cleaning kit, 
a camera bag is still a good idea. A camera bag 
protects your camera when it isn’t in use, and 
it’s the ideal place for your digital photography 
stuff. Here are some tips for finding the perfect 
bag for your digital gear:
 
✓ Get a bag that’s big enough for the gear 
you now own, and any additional equip-
ment you anticipate buying in the near 
future.
 
✓ Purchase a bag that’s comfortable. Make 
sure you try the bag on for size in the 
camera store. Place your camera in the bag 
and put it over your shoulder. If it’s not 
comfortable, ask the salesperson to show 
you a different bag. There’s nothing worse 
than a chafed neck after a day-long photog-
raphy adventure.
 
✓ Make sure the bag has enough pockets 
for your stuff. The bag should have a place 
where you can park extra memory cards, 
spare batteries, and other accessories.
 
✓ Make sure the bag is sturdy enough to 
protect your gear.
 
✓ Make sure the bag is made so that you 
can get to your gear quickly. There’s 
nothing worse than fumbling for a piece of 
equipment as your digital Kodak Moment 
disappears.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
✓ Divide your equipment into manageable portions. If you’ve got a lot of 
gear, consider purchasing a hard-shell case that’s big enough for all of 
your equipment, and a soft bag for day trips.
 
✓ Consider purchasing a customizable camera bag. These bags come 
with removable partitions that are held in place with Velcro.
 
✓ Prepare for the elements. If it rains a lot where you live and you shoot 
portraits on location, purchase a water-resistant camera bag, or one 
with a built-in rain cover.
Camera bags come in many different shapes and sizes. Figure 2-11 shows a 
camera that’s suitable for a digital SLR and a couple of lenses. Figure 2-12 
shows a camera bag that’s suitable for a small point-and-shoot digital camera. 
This camera bag has an added bonus: It’s green. The bag is constructed from 
recycled materials. Now that’s a winning combination — a camera bag that’s 
fashionable, holds your gear, and is good for the planet.

 Chapter 2: Choosing Your Equipment
Figure 2-12: A case for a point-and-shoot camera.
Choosing other accessories
When you buy your camera, you get one battery, and maybe one memory 
card. That’s enough to get you by when you’re shooting close to home, but 
what happens when you take a day-long journey in search of cool places to 
photograph your subject? Or maybe you’re combining portrait photogra-
phy and landscape photography on your vacation. Well, the battery charge 
dwindles as you photograph, and you fill up the memory card pretty quickly. 
You’ve also got to maintain your equipment. Here are some additional acces-
sories you should consider:
 
✓ An extra battery: I always keep one fully charged spare in my camera 
bag. If you decide to buy a third-party battery, make sure you’re not 
voiding your camera warranty by using it.
 
✓ Extra memory cards: Memory cards come in different capacities and 
different data transfer rates. High-speed memory cards decrease the 
amount of time it takes the memory card to accept the data from your 
camera, which means your camera’s memory buffer won’t fill up as 
quickly when you hold the shutter button to capture a sequence of 
images. Some manufacturers include data recovery software with their 
high-speed cards. Data recovery software is handy if a card should 
ever become corrupt, which means you won’t be able to download the 
images to the computer. The data recovery software may make it pos-
sible for you to recover the corrupt data.
 
✓ A lens-cleaning brush: A lens-cleaning brush has soft hairs that you use 
to whisk dust off the leans.

42
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
✓ A lens-cleaning cloth: A good microfiber lens-cleaning cloth is used to 
clean any smudges off the camera lens. Use the cloth after you use the 
brush.
 
✓ A lens-cleaning pen: A lens-cleaning pen has a lens-cleaning brush on 
one end and a pad for removing smudges on the other end. It has a clip 
on it, just like some pens have, for clipping to your pocket. A lens-cleaning 
pen is handy when you want to travel light. But in my opinion, you 
should still have a good lens-cleaning brush and cloth for cleaning your 
equipment after a photo shoot.
 
✓ A memory card holder: When you’ve got lots of memory cards, a 
memory card holder is a great way to keep everything organized. The 
holder I use has two sides. I put my empty cards on one side, which has 
a gray background. When I fill a card, I place it in the other side of the 
memory card holder, which has an orange background.

fter you buy your camera, you’re ready to start creating portraits. 
Almost. Before you can create decent photographs, you’ve got to know 
what all those funny little buttons and dials do. You’ve also got to master the 
camera menu. That’s not as easy as choosing one from Column A and one 
from Column B. If you don’t know how to use the features of your 
camera, you’re not going to get the most out of your camera. 
If all you’re doing is pushing a button and hoping for the 
best, that isn’t really photography. Photography is a 
combination of creativity and knowing your equip-
ment. In the beginning, you’ll spend a lot of time get-
ting to know your camera. But after a while, you’ll 
know your equipment like the back of your hand; 
your creative juices will flow, and you’ll take some 
fantastic pictures. This chapter is about under-
standing what digital photography is all about, 
mastering your digital camera, and getting the most 
from it.
Understanding Digital Photography
Digital photography is pure technology. Think about it. Your camera 
captures photons of light through a lens composed of multiple elements of 
highly polished glass. The light hits a sensor that has a photosite for each 
pixel. The photosites in the sensor records what the lens sees, and then the 

44
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
results are sent to a processor in the camera. The processor converts the 
information into digital format (and compresses the image when you shoot in 
JPEG mode) and then sends the information to a buffer, which is the equiva-
lent of RAM memory in your computer. The data is then sent to your memory 
card, which is the digital equivalent of film.
If you shoot in your camera’s RAW format (in which the camera collects 
unprocessed, uncompressed photo data), the raw data is sent to the memory 
card. It’s then your job to process the RAW image in your digital darkroom. 
In the upcoming sections, I demystify some of the technical terms associated 
with digital photography.
What the heck are pixels and megapixels?
A pixel (picture element) is the smallest part of a digital image. When 
you put a whole mess of pixels together in a rectangular grid, you end up 
with something that looks like an image. If you still read an old-fashioned 
newspaper (I’ve gone green and read all my news online), open the comics 
section and hold a magnifying glass over your favorite comic character. 
You see the individual dots of ink that make up the image. This is the print 
equivalent of a pixel.
A megapixel is one million pixels. Megapixel is also the unit of measure for the 
amount of pixels a digital camera sensor can capture. For example, the sensor 
in a Canon PowerShot G10 camera captures 4416 pixels horizontally, and 3312 
pixels vertically. Do the math: Multiply the number of pixels captured horizon-
tally with the number of pixels captured vertically. (4416 × 3312 = 14625,792.) 
Divide the result by one million, and you get 14.7 megapixels. Round that 
number up,and you’ve got 15 megapixels. This also determines the size of the 
images you get from the camera. But for that to make sense, you’ve got to add 
image resolution to the equation. Isn’t digital photography fun?
Resolving to resolve resolution
Image resolution is the number of pixels per unit of measure. In North America, 
our unit of measure for resolution is pixels per inch (ppi). If you’ve ever down-
loaded an image from the Internet and then printed it, you know something 
about resolution. The native resolution for most computer monitors is 72 ppi. 
However, when you print an image optimized for screen display, you can see 
all the pixels, which isn’t a good thing. When it comes to printed image qual-
ity, a higher resolution yields better image quality.
Every camera has a native resolution. Many of the early digital cameras had 
a native resolution of 180 ppi. When you open the image in an application like 
Photoshop Elements, you’ll see the size in pixels and the resolution. The size 
of the image in inches is determined by the size in pixels and the resolution. 

45
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
You can calculate the image size (which is the largest size you can print a 
photo without distortion) by dividing the image width and height in pixels by 
the image resolution to get the size in inches.
For example, if you have an image with pixel dimensions of 3000 x 2400 with a 
resolution of 300 ppi, the printed image will be 10 x 8 inches. (3000 ÷ 300 = 10 
and 2400 ÷ 300 = 8.) If you change the image resolution to 200 ppi, you end up 
with an image that measures 15 x 10 inches. You can get decent image quality 
with a resolution of 180 ppi, but with most printers you’ll get the best qual-
ity when you resample your images to 300 ppi. I show you how to resample 
images in Chapter 10.
The Recipe for a Perfect Exposure
Each pixel represents a single dot of color. When viewed at 100 percent 
magnification, the pixels blend to produce a recognizable image. Each indi-
vidual pixel is a mixture of red, green, and blue. Most digital cameras capture 
images with 24-bit color depth, which means 16.8 million shades of color are 
available. That’s equivalent to what the human eye can see. The camera’s 
job is to accurately measure the scene and produce a distribution of colors 
from shadows to highlights. If the shadow areas are pure black, detail is lost. 
If the highlight areas are pure white, detail is lost. Imagine a picture of a bride 
in bright sunlight. If areas of her gown, such as lace, are blown out (overex-
posed) to pure white (showing none of the detail of the lace for example), 
the bride isn’t going to be very happy with the resulting image. Our job as 
photographers is to analyze the scene, analyze what the camera gives us, and 
modify the exposure, if necessary.
Understanding how exposure works in the camera
Digital cameras expose images the same way as film cameras did. When the 
camera exposes an image, the duration of the exposure and the amount of 
light entering the camera determines whether the resulting image is too dark, 
too bright, or properly exposed.
The duration of the exposure is known as the shutter speed. Digital cameras 
have a shutter speed range from several seconds in duration to as fast as 
1/8,000 of a second. A fast shutter speed stops action, and a slow shutter 
speed leaves the shutter open for a long time to record images in low-light 
situations.
The aperture (f-stop) determines how much light enters the camera during the 
exposure. Some people get confused with the terms aperture and f-stop. The 
aperture is the opening that determines the amount of light entering the camera, 
which corresponds to an f-stop, which is a number. You would think that a large 
aperture would equate to a high f-stop value, but it’s just the opposite. A small 

46
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
f-stop number (large aperture) lets a lot of light into the camera, and a high 
f-stop number (small aperture) lets a small amount of light into the camera. (See 
Figure 3-1.) Depending on the lens you’re using, the f-stop range can be from 
f/1.8, which sends huge gobs of light into the camera, to f/32, which lets a min-
iscule splash of light into the camera. The f-stop is also one of the factors that 
determines the depth of field, a concept I explain in the next section.
f/2

f/2.8
f/5.6
f/16
f/11
f/8
Figure 3-1: A lower f-stop number corresponds to a larger 
aperture, allowing more light into the camera.
As you can see, the camera has a number of different ways to create a per-
fectly exposed image. The camera’s metering device examines the scene and 
determines which shutter speed and f-stop combination will yield a properly 
exposed image. The camera can choose a fast shutter speed and large aper-
ture, or a slow shutter speed and small aperture.
If you shoot in automatic mode, the camera makes both decisions for you. 
But you’re much smarter than the processor inside your camera. If you 
take control of the reins and supply one piece of the puzzle, the camera will 
supply the rest. When you’re taking certain types of pictures, it makes sense 
to determine which f-stop will be best for what you’re photographing. In 
other scenarios, it makes more sense to choose the shutter speed and let the 
camera determine the f-stop. I show you which settings make the most sense 
for portrait photography in the upcoming “Understanding shooting modes” 
section of this chapter.
Controlling depth of field
Depth of field determines how much of your image looks sharp and is in 
focus. When you’re taking pictures of landscapes on a bright sunny day, 
you want a depth of field that produces an image where you can see the 
details for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles — thank you, Pete 

47
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
Townshend. Then there are other times when you want to have a very limited 
depth of field, such as when you’re shooting a portrait, with the person in 
focus and whatever’s in front of or behind her out of focus.
You control the depth of field in an image by selecting the f-stop and letting 
the camera do the math to determine what shutter speed will yield a prop-
erly exposed image. You get a limited depth of field when using a small f-stop 
(large aperture), which lets a lot of light into the camera. A fast lens has an 
f-stop of 2.8 or smaller, and it gives you the capability to shoot in low-light 
conditions and have a wonderfully shallow depth of field. When shooting at a 
lens’s smallest f-stop, you’re letting the most amount of light into the camera. 
This is known as shooting “wide open.” Figure 3-2 shows two pictures of the 
same subject. The image on the left was shot at f/1.8, and the image on the 
right was shot at f/10. In both cases, I focused on the subject. Notice how 
much more of the image shot at f/10 is in focus. The detail of the flowers in 
the second shot distracts the viewer’s attention from the subject.
The focal length you use is also a factor when determining depth of field. A 
wide-angle focal length of 28 mm or less will yield a larger depth of field than 
an 85 mm lens at the same f-stop.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Deciphering a histogram
You’ve got a digital camera with a microprocessor that does everything but 
tell you the time of day. (Come to think of it, the microprocessor records the 
time of day, and other bits of information about the photo, as metadata with 
the image file. But that’s a topic for a different chapter.) Foremost of every-
thing it does, though, your camera processor does its best to provide you 
with a properly exposed image for the available lighting conditions. But even 
the smartest and most up-to-date, all-singing, all-dancing digital camera can 
get it wrong when you’re shooting under difficult lighting conditions. That’s 
why most camera manufacturers give you the option to display a histogram 
(see Figure 3-3) alongside the image on your camera LCD monitor. A histo-
gram is a wonderful thing. It’s a graph — well, actually it looks more like a 
mountain — that shows the distribution of pixels from shadows to highlights. 
You see a peak in the histogram where there are a lot of pixels for a bright-
ness level. Where you see a valley, there are fewer pixels at that brightness 
range. Where the graph hits the floor of the histogram, you have no data.
Figure 3-3: Displaying a histogram on your camera’s LCD monitor.
When analyzing a histogram, you look for sharp peaks at either end of 
the scale. If you have a sharp peak that climbs the extreme left side of the 
histogram (the shadows), the image is underexposed. An image can also be 
underexposed if the graph is on the floor of the histogram in the highlight 
(right) side of histogram. If there’s a large spike that’s right up against the 
highlight side of the histogram, the image is overexposed and a lot of the 
detail in the image highlights are blown out to pure white. You can correct for 

49
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
overexposure and underexposure to a degree in your image-editing program, 
but it’s always best to get it right in the camera. If you analyze a histogram 
and notice that the image is overexposed or underexposed, you can use 
your camera’s exposure compensation feature to rectify the problem. For 
more information on exposure compensation, see the upcoming section, 
“Correcting exposure.”
 
The histogram is a tool. Use it wisely. When you’re analyzing a scene that 
doesn’t have bright highlights, you may end up with a histogram that is rela-
tively flat on the right side. That’s when you’ll have to judge whether the 
image on the LCD monitor looks like the actual scene.
Mastering Your Equipment
Shooting portraits isn’t rocket science, but you do need to know a few things. 
When your goal is to create a pleasing likeness of a friend or relative, you 
need to know what all the gizmos and gadgets on your digital camera do. 
When you shoot portraits, you graduate from rank amateur point-and-shooter 
to a serious hobbyist. After you start creating portraits of your friends and 
relatives, you may even consider becoming a professional photographer, but 
that’s another kettle of fish. The key to shooting great photos is getting to 
know what features your camera has, and which ones are applicable to the 
type of photography you do. This is a book about portrait photography, so 
I won’t go into a long discussion about stuff you won’t use when shooting 
portraits.
 
If you’re interested in other types of photography, consider getting a copy of 
Digital Photography Workbook For Dummies, written by Yours Truly (and pub-
lished by Wiley), and available online and at most major bookstores. If your 
favorite bookseller doesn’t have a couple of copies in stock, I’d appreciate it 
if you’d ask them to stock a few. My roommate Niki the Cat, and I would 
deeply appreciate it. Come to think of it, so would my publisher.
And now it’s time to master your equipment.
Mastering your camera menu
All camera menus are not created equal. Therefore, it’s impossible to 
cover each and every nuance that might appear on your camera menu, 
especially if your camera was hatched last week. Yup, they do update them 
that frequently. What I do in this section is cover what I think are some of 
the things you should know. Your camera may also use one or more dials to 
access certain functions. To find out where these gems are hidden in your 
multi-faceted, mega-page menu, or on the dial on which they appear on 

50
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
your Swiss-Army-Knife camera, you’ll have to consult that manual that came 
with your camera. Sorry if the manual is boring. And if the manual is really 
boring, tell them you know where they can find a Dummies author who can 
add a bit of spice to their boring drivel. Figure 3-4 shows two camera menus 
side by side. The camera menu on the left side of the figure is the shooting 
menu from a Nikon D5000, and the menu on the right is the shooting menu 
from a Canon PowerShot G10. 
Figure 3-4: A tale of two menus. Vive le difference.
Setting image quality
The combination of image size and quality determines the file size. Image 
size is simply the largest image you can print given the number of megapix-
els your camera is capable of capturing. Image quality, in this context, is the 
amount of compression that is applied to the image when the camera pro-
cesses it. When you let the camera process the image, in almost all cases you 
get a JPEG image. The camera compresses the image and data is lost. Letting 
the camera process the image is like having a digital Polaroid; you can’t do 
much with the image after you download it to your computer. If you shoot 
RAW, the image isn’t compressed and takes up the most amount of room 
on your memory card. However, when you shoot RAW, you can process the 
image in your computer. In essence when you capture pictures using your 
camera’s RAW format, you end up with a digital negative.
So the size you select also determines the overall size of the image in pixels. 
Combined with the camera’s native resolution, this determines the maximum 
size at which you can print the image. Most camera manufacturers feature 
the following image settings: S (small), M (medium image size), L (largest 
image size), W (widescreen with a letterbox), RAW (the camera manufactur-
er’s proprietary RAW format). 

51
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
The Quality setting determines how much the image is compressed, which 
also determines the resulting file size, and how many images you can fit on 
a card. If you choose a format other than RAW, you can specify a quality set-
ting. My Canon G10 offers the following quality settings: Superfine, Fine, and 
Normal. When I choose Superfine, the camera applies the least amount of 
compression, which gives me the best image quality, Fine applies more com-
pression, and Normal applies the most amount of compression. To give you 
an idea of how compression equates to file size, consider the following. With 
a 4GB memory card choosing the largest image size, I can fit 2080 images on 
the card with Normal image quality, 1013 with Fine image quality, and 602 
images using Superfine image quality. I strongly recommend shooting RAW, 
but if you are going to let the camera do the processing, choose the larg-
est image size, and the best image quality. Then you can use the images for 
prints, the Web, or e-mail.
To find out how to adjust these settings, you can explore your camera’s 
manual and menus. If your camera has the option to capture RAW images, 
you’ll find that option on the image quality section of your camera menu as 
well. On some cameras, such as the Canon G10, you’ll find that image quality 
settings and many other features appear when you press a Function button 
on the back of your camera to display a menu similar to that shown on the 
left in Figure 3-5. Other cameras require you to press the Menu button and 
scroll to the image quality section as shown on the right in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: Setting image quality.
 
Some digital cameras that capture lots of megapixels may offer more than 
one RAW setting. For example, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II has three RAW set-
tings, which capture different numbers of megapixels. The photographer can 
choose a smaller megapixel capture to conserve space on the memory card. 
If you know you’re only going to print your images on 4x6-inch paper, you can 
get by with a RAW setting that captures fewer megapixels.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Changing to a different metering mode
Your digital camera has a built-in metering device that measures the light and 
sends the information to Mr. Camera Brain, who determines the proper expo-
sure for the scene. But you have control over how Mr. Meter reads the light 
in the scene. The choice you make depends on the lighting conditions for the 
scene. To find out how to change the metering mode on your camera, you’ll 
have to resort to the camera manual. The list that follows shows the metering 
modes you can choose from and the conditions in which you should use them.
 
 
✓ Evaluative or Matrix: This is the default mode for most cameras. You 
can use this mode for most of your work, including backlit scenes. The 
camera divides the scene into several zones and evaluates the bright-
ness of the scene, direct light, and backlighting, factoring these variables 
to create the correct exposure for your subject.
 
 
✓ Center Weighted (Average): This metering mode meters the entire 
scene, but it gives more importance to the subject in the center of your 
scene. Use this mode when one part of your scene is significantly 
brighter than the rest — for example, when the sun is in the picture. If 
your bright light source is near the center of the scene, this mode pre-
vents it from being overexposed.
 
 
✓ Spot: This mode meters a small area in the center of the scene. Use this 
mode when your subject is in the center of the scene and is significantly 
brighter than the rest of your scene.
The icons shown are for Canon cameras. The icons for your camera may 
be slightly different. Please refer to your camera manual to see which icon 
equates to which metering mode.
Your camera may have the option to spot meter where the auto-focus frame 
is. If your camera has the option to move the auto-focus frame to your sub-
ject, you can accurately spot meter a subject that isn’t in the center of the 
frame.
Adjusting white balance
The human eye can accurately register white no matter how it is lit. Digital 
cameras automatically adjust white balance so that whites under different 
light sources look white. But under some lighting situations, digital cameras 
need help. If your subject looks a little green under the gills, automatic white 
balance (AWB) isn’t doing its job. When this happens, you can change the 
way your camera responds to light by choosing a different white balance set-
ting. The location of the white balance options depend on the camera you’re 
using. Refer to your camera manual for further instructions. Table 3-1 shows 
the different white balance options available on most digital cameras.

Your digital camera may have other white balance options, such as 
Fluorescent H (daylight fluorescent) or Underwater (for taking pictures under 
water with the camera in a water-tight enclosure). But what happens when 
you’re photographing your subject under every kind of lighting known to 
man? Your camera’s brain goes apoplectic and chooses a white balance set-
ting that doesn’t result in great pictures. When you review an image in the 
monitor and the color isn’t right, your only choice is manual white balance. 
The process differs from camera to camera. In a nutshell, what you do is pho-
tograph something that is pure white in the same position where your sub-
ject will be. Then you use a camera menu option to set white balance based 
on this photograph. When all else fails, this will save your bacon and give you 
photographs with the proper white balance. Refer to your camera manual for 
the exact instructions for your camera model.
 
Remember to reset your white balance setting to Auto (AWB) when you’ve 
finished taking pictures with a different setting. If you don’t, the rest of your 
photos will have the wrong white balance and look just plain weird.
Formatting your cards
Make sure you know where to find the command to format your memory 
cards. When you format a card, it’s the same thing as formatting a hard drive, 
you wipe all the images off the card. You can erase images, but it’s always 
best to format your cards after you download them to your computer.

54
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Many image-editing programs offer the option to format cards after images 
have downloaded. Don’t accept this option. Only your camera is best 
equipped to optimally format your memory cards. Besides, if something goes 
wrong with the download to your computer and you let the computer format 
your card, your precious images are lost forever.
 
Manufacturers are creating memory cards with huge capacities, in some 
cases up to 32GB. A memory card is a mechanical device that will eventually 
fail. When it fails, you’ll lose all your data. If a card with a large capacity fails, 
you lose a lot of your prized images. Pack several small cards in your camera 
bag. That way, when one does fail, you don’t lose as many photos.
 
Back up your images to an external hard drive after you download them to 
your computer and before you format the card. You never know when disas-
ter will strike and corrupt the data on your hard drive. If you don’t own an 
external hard drive, back up your images to CDs or DVDs. If you back up to 
CD or DVD, consider buying the archival discs (they’re usually gold in color) 
that have life spans of 20–30 years or longer.
Setting other useful options
There are lots of other useful options on your camera menu. Of course, they 
vary from model to model. That’s why there are many manufacturers and a 
plethora of models. Competition is a wonderful thing for the digital photogra-
pher. The cameras keep getting cheaper, with more bells and whistles. . . . But 
I digress. Here are a couple of other useful features that may be lurking on 
your camera menus, or on one of the dials:
 
✓ Custom auto-focus point: This gives you the option to move the auto-
focus point (the object in the frame that the camera uses to focus on) 
when you’re photographing a subject that isn’t in the center of the 
frame. If your camera has this option, you may also have the option of 
moving the metering point (the place in the scene from which the camera 
measures the lighting to determine the best shutter speed and f-stop) to 
the auto-focus point when using Spot metering mode.
 
✓ Single auto-focus point: This gives you the option to change from mul-
tiple auto-focus points to a single auto-focus point. This option is handy 
when you’re photographing people. Center the single auto-focus point 
over your subject and then press the shutter button halfway to achieve 
focus. You can then recompose your picture as desired. When you take 
pictures with a single auto-focus point, the camera won’t be fooled into 
locking focus on something else in the scene, such as the slats in the 
venetian blinds behind your subject.

55
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
 
✓ Face tracking: This option is useful if you’re photographing a couple of 
people and you want the camera to focus on them and not other stuff 
in the scene. Don’t ask me how the camera does it, but when you select 
this mode, the camera draws a square around each face (but it doesn’t 
show up in the final print, of course), or uses some other method to 
track a face. My Canon G10 detects a maximum of three faces, so if 
you’re shooting a group of four, one will be low man on the totem pole. 
Your camera may also have the option to move focus to a specific face. 
 
 If there’s something in your scene that looks like a face, say a bust of 
Mozart, the camera may mistakenly think it’s a human face, in which 
case your picture may be a bust.
 
✓ Servo or Continuous AF (Auto Focus) mode: This option keeps focus-
ing on a subject as it moves closer to or farther from you. This option is 
handy if you’re doing candid portraits of someone at work or play. After 
you achieve focus, the camera keeps your subject in focus as it moves 
through the frame. This option does use more battery power, though. 
Your camera may use another name to refer to continuous auto focus. 
Refer to your camera manual for specific instructions.
 
✓ Image stabilization: This option is handy when you zoom in tight on 
your subject in low lighting conditions. Image stabilization compensates 
for any operator movement — that would be you — when you press the 
shutter button. With image stabilization, you’ll be able to shoot one or 
two shutter speed stops slower than you normally would. Some camera 
manufacturers claim you can shoot even slower shutter speeds than 
these. Of course, if you hold your camera very still, with image stabiliza-
tion, you’ll be able to shoot at even lower shutter speeds than claimed 
by your camera manufacturer.
 
 To find out how slow you can go with image stabilization, zoom to your 
longest focal length, and photograph something with a lot of detail like a 
leaf on a tree. Shoot several pictures and choose a slower shutter speed 
each time. Download the images to your computer and examine them at 
100 percent magnification. Examine the edges of the leaves and the 
veins. When the lines start getting a little blurry, you know that the next 
fastest shutter speed is as slow as you can go.
 
✓ Neutral-density filter: This option lowers the amount of light entering 
the camera, which enables you to shoot at a larger aperture (smaller 
f-stop number) in bright light to reduce the depth of field.
 
✓ Second-shutter synch: This option fires the flash at the end of the expo-
sure instead of the beginning. Use this option when you’re using flash 
with slow shutter speeds. Any motion will appear to be coming toward 
the subject, instead of away from it, giving your image a more natural 
appearance.

Demystifying your camera dial
On the top or your camera, neatly organized with the utmost ergonomic 
efficiency, you’ll find a dial. On this dial, you’ll see some icons; some of them 
familiar, others strange. These dials determine what shooting mode the camera 
operates in. The number of icons you have on your camera depends on the 
model camera you use. Figure 3-6 shows the camera dial from a Nikon D5000.
 
On some cameras you use a combination of a button and a dial to change to a 
different shooting mode. Other cameras resort to a menu to change shooting 
modes.
Figure 3-6: Rotate the dial to choose a shooting mode.
Understanding shooting modes
Almost all digital cameras come with a dial that you use to switch from one 
shooting mode to the next. Your camera is equipped with an automatic mode, 
which gives complete control to the camera. This isn’t a good thing when 
you’re photographing portraits of people. Your camera might also have a 
multitude of scene modes. The common scene modes handle sports, macros 
(close-ups), landscape, and portrait photography. In fact, some cameras 
have a scene mode called Scene, which hooks you up to the camera menu 

57
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
and enables you to choose one of the special scene modes that are tailor-
made for shooting stuff like fireworks, beach scenes, snow scenes, and so on. 
Your camera may also have a set of advanced settings where you can manu-
ally set the exposure, or provide one part of the exposure equation, and the 
camera supplies the other. Fortunately, portrait photographers need only be 
concerned with the following modes:
 
 
✓ Portrait: The icon you see in the margin is used by almost all camera 
manufacturers to indicate Portrait mode. When you take pictures in 
Portrait mode, the camera chooses a large aperture, which keeps your 
subject in sharp focus and gives you a soft, blurry background. Note 
that if you’re shooting in very bright conditions, the camera may not be 
able to choose a large enough aperture to yield a blurry background. 
 
 
✓ Aperture Priority: The icon you see in the margin indicates Aperture 
Priority mode. On some cameras, this is shown as Av (Aperture Value). 
When you take a picture in Aperture Priority mode, you specify the aper-
ture and the camera dials in the shutter speed to yield a properly 
exposed image. When you shoot portraits, choose the largest aperture 
(smallest f-stop number) for the current lighting conditions. If you 
choose an aperture that will cause the image to be overexposed, your 
camera will flash some kind of warning in the viewfinder or LCD monitor.
 
If the light is too bright to use a large aperture, use a neutral density filter to 
decrease the amount of light reaching the sensor. Your local camera store 
probably carries a neutral density filter to fit your lens. If you own a point-
and-shoot camera, it may have a built-in neutral density filter that you can 
access from the camera menu. 
 
If you like to shoot other types of pictures, I urge you to explore the other 
shooting modes your camera offers. 
Correcting exposure
A properly exposed image is a wonderful thing. Overexposure is never a 
good thing, even if you’re a public figure. And underexposure never quite 
cuts it. When you’re taking pictures in challenging lighting conditions, the 
camera does its best to deliver an exposure where everything in the scene 
is properly exposed. But what happens when the camera gets it wrong and 
your subject is too bright (overexposure) or too dim (underexposure)? You 
get a gnarly looking picture that even the subject’s mother wouldn’t love. 
You may be able to correct these problems to some extent in your favorite 
image-editing program. But it’s always best to get it right in the camera. If 
your camera has an exposure compensation feature, you can correct a bad 
call on your camera’s part by doing the following:

58
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
1. Review the image on your camera monitor.
 
 When you’re reviewing the image, make sure your subject doesn’t have 
harsh white spots on her face. This is a sign that the image may be over-
exposed. If there’s no detail at all in the brightest areas of the image, the 
image is overexposed. If your subject appears to be dim — I’m not refer-
ring to her intelligence — the image may be underexposed. The only 
way to know for sure is to review the histogram. (See the “Deciphering a 
Histogram” section earlier in this chapter.)
 
2. Display the histogram.
 
 If your camera has this option, you either use a menu command or 
button to display the histogram. Many cameras have an Info button; 
pressing it displays different information screens.
 
3. Examine the histogram.
 
 If you see a sharp peak at the right edge of your histogram, your image 
is overexposed. If you see a flat line at the right edge of your histogram, 
your image is underexposed. But the histogram is not always the defin-
ing factor. If you’re shooting in low light conditions without any bright 
highlights, it is perfectly normal to have a flat line on a small portion 
of the right side of the histogram. When you’re taking photographs in 
tricky lighting conditions, let your eyes be the judge. If what you see 
on the LCD monitor doesn’t match the scene, dial in some exposure 
compensation as shown in the next step. If the LCD monitor accurately 
depicts the scene, you’ve nailed it, regardless of what the histogram 
indicates.
 
4. Dial in the needed amount of exposure compensation.
 
 The amount of compensation you dial in depends on how much the 
image is over- or underexposed. When the image is underexposed, you 
increase exposure. When the image is overexposed, you decrease the 
exposure. In the old days, that meant fiddling with the shutter speed 
or aperture. The exposure compensation feature lets you increase or 
decrease exposure 1/3 stop at a time. Most cameras have an exposure 
compensation range of 2 stops over and 2 stops under.
 
 On most cameras, there is an actual dial for exposure compensation. It 
may do double duty with other camera functions. For example, on my 
Canon EOS 5D, I have to press the shutter button and turn another dial 
while watching the viewfinder to determine how much compensation 
I’m dialing into the exposure. On my Canon G10, there is a dial on the 
left side of the camera that you rotate to specify the desired amount of 
compensation. Your camera manual shows you how to adjust exposure 
compensation. 

59
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
 
 Your camera may have a menu option that lets you change the incre-
ment by which exposure compensation is applied. Refer to your camera 
manual for details.
 
5. Take the picture after adjusting the exposure.
 
 After taking the picture, review the histogram again. If the exposure still 
isn’t right, you’ll have to increase or decrease the exposure as outlined 
in Step 4.
Using autoexposure bracketing
To hedge their bets, many photographers bracket their exposures. When 
you bracket an exposure, you take three pictures: one at the exposure the 
camera thinks is optimal, one shot that has less exposure than what the 
camera deems correct, and one shot that has additional exposure. This is a 
good option when you’re taking pictures in tricky lighting conditions when 
the action is hot and heavy and don’t have the time to review each shot and 
dial in exposure compensation. Fortunately, most cameras have a menu com-
mand you can use to bracket your exposures. When you choose this option, 
you determine how much the bracketed images are over- and underexposed. 
Most cameras enable you to bracket your exposures in 1/3 stop increments. 
After enabling this option, the camera takes three pictures at different expo-
sures. You can speed up the process by enabling continuous-release mode. 
After enabling this mode with autoexposure bracketing, the camera takes 
three pictures when you press the shutter button.
Understanding focal lengths
The focal length of the lens you use determines how much of the scene in 
front of you the camera records. A short focal length includes a wide view 
of the scene, which is why a lens with a short focal length is referred to as 
a wide-angle lens. Wide-angle lenses cover focal lengths from 12mm (very 
wide field of view) to 35mm. A long focal length magnifies the scene, essen-
tially capturing a small part of the scene (also known as field of view) and 
magnifying it to fill the frame. Lenses with long focal lengths are called tele-
photo lenses. Telephoto lenses begin with a focal length of 80mm and exceed 
500mm. A lens with a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 50mm 
encompasses the same field of view as the human eye.
When you have a lens that encompasses a range of focal lengths, you have 
a zoom lens. You can zoom in on your subject to focus on an small area, or 
zoom out for the big picture. You may see zoom lenses referred to as wide-
angle to telephoto zoom, or normal to telephoto zoom. 

60
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
For portrait photography, a focal length of 85mm is considered ideal for a 
head-and-shoulders portrait. You can also use longer focal lengths of up to 
200mm. A longer focal length compresses details in a scene. Objects behind 
your subject appear to be closer. If the background is colorful foliage or 
architectural shapes, for instance, this is a good thing. If the lens has a large 
aperture (small f-stop number), the background will be an out-of-focus blur.
The following image, Figure 3-7, shows a subject photographed with a 28mm 
focal length, a 70mm focal length, and a 200mm focal length.These are shots 
of a garden gnome on the deck in my backyard. I have too much respect for 
the people who have graciously consented to have their images included in 
this book, which is why you don’t see a picture of a person taken with a wide-
angle focal length. These pictures were all taken from the same distance and 
with the same aperture. Notice the wider field of view in the first and second 
image. Also notice that the background details are easier to identify in the 
first image. The background details in the second image are a soft, out-of 
focus blur, and in the third image, they’re barely visible. The second image is 
similar to the effect you’re after when you create portraits.

Setting image quality and image format
The image quality and size determine how many images you can fit on a 
memory card. Image quality also determines how crisp the resulting image is 
and the maximum size you can print the image. When you determine image 

61
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
quality, you determine how much the image is compressed. When an image is 
compressed, the file size is smaller and the quality is lower. Depending on the 
camera you use, you set the image quality and size using either the camera 
menu or access choices using a function button.
What the heck is a bokeh?
When you take pictures with a lens that has a 
larger aperture, the background is out of focus. 
When the background has specular highlights 
such as bright lights, reflections of shiny metal, 
leaves, and so on, the specular highlights in the 
background form a pattern which is known as 
a bokeh. (It can be pronounced boke-aay or 
boke-uh.) The way the lens is constructed deter-
mines the look of the bokeh. Many lenses are 
prized by photographers because of the bokeh 
they produce when a picture is taken with the 
lens wide open (maximum aperture, or smallest 
f-stop number).

62
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
You also use the camera menu or function dial to specify the image format. 
When you set the size and quality, you’re working with images in the JPEG 
format. Your camera may also have the option to shoot images in your 
camera’s RAW format. This option is also found on the camera menu or 
function dial. If you happen to have one of the newer cameras that captures 
a humongous amount of megapixels, you may have the option to specify a 
lower number of megapixels when capturing RAW images to conserve room 
on your memory card. Choose a lower setting if the image is going to be 
printed as a 4-x-6-inch image.
Understanding ISO
Your digital camera probably has the option to determine how sensitive the 
camera sensor is to light. If you’ve used film cameras, you may remember 
that film’s sensitivity to light was determined by its ISO rating, which is a 
number. Cameras are the same. With a film camera, you need to change film 
when shooting in different lighting conditions. With a digital camera, you can 
change ISO ratings on the fly. The ISO range depends on your camera. My 
Canon G10 has an ISO range from 100 to 1600.
When you increase the ISO rating, you increase the camera’s sensitivity to 
light, which means you can shoot with faster shutter speeds in low-light situa-
tions. When you increase the ISO rating, you also increase digital noise, which 
is prevalent in shadow areas of your image, of large areas of similar color such 
as the sky in a landscape picture. Many people think digital noise is like film 
grain. It’s not. It’s digital mish-mosh that doesn‘t look good. If you own a digital 
point-and-shoot camera, digital noise is exacerbated due to the amount of cir-
cuitry that’s crammed onto the miniscule sensor and the smaller pixel size.
When you increase ISO, you run the risk of creating an unusable image. How 
far can you crank up the ISO and get an acceptable image? That depends on 
the camera you own, and the age of your camera. The sensors on the newer 
cameras have less noise than older ones. The only way to be sure is to take 
test shots of the same subject in the same lighting at every ISO setting on 
your camera. Make sure you’ve got some shadow areas in the scene you’re 
photographing. Download your test shots to your computer, open them in 
your image-editing application, and zoom in to 100 percent. Digital color 
noise shows up as tiny specks of color in the shadow areas and areas of solid 
color. (See Figure 3-8.) And luminance noise shows up as gray clumps in the 
shadow areas. 

63

Creating a perfect portrait
If you’ve read this chapter from the start, you can see that there are many 
variables involving camera settings to focus on when your goal is a perfect 
portrait. There are additional variables concerning lighting, location, and so 
on that I address in upcoming chapters. In this section, I summarize what 
camera settings you need to fiddle with to create the perfect portrait:
 
✓ ISO: Choose the lowest ISO possible. Remember that when you choose 
a lower ISO setting, you’ll have to use a slower shutter speed or a larger 
aperture (small f-stop number). Make sure the shutter speed is fast 
enough to ensure a blur-free picture.

64
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
✓ Shooting mode: When you’re shooting portraits, I suggest that you 
always use Aperture Priority mode and then choose the largest aperture 
(lowest f-stop number) for the given lighting conditions, which creates 
an image with your subject in sharp focus and a blurry, out-of-focus 
background. If you aren’t comfortable manually adjusting the aperture, 
choose your camera’s Portrait mode, which achieves similar results.
 
✓ Aperture: If you’re using your camera’s Aperture Priority mode, choose 
the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number) possible for the given 
lighting conditions. As you change the aperture, the shutter speed the 
camera chooses is displayed in your viewfinder (on a digital SLR camera 
with no monitor), LCD monitor, or both. If you’re taking photographs 
in bright light, you probably won’t be able to use your largest aperture 
setting. When this is the case, put a neutral density filter over the lens 
to decrease the amount of light reaching the camera sensor. Some point-
and-shoot cameras have a menu command that enables you to activate a 
digital neutral density filter.
 
✓ Focal length: Never use a wide-angle focal length when taking a portrait. 
The resulting portrait will not be pleasing. If you’re using a point-and-
shoot camera to capture your portraits, back away from your subject 
and zoom in. If you’re using a digital SLR to capture your portraits, use a 
lens that gives you a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm. If 
your camera doesn’t have a full-frame sensor, you’ll have to do the math. 
(See Chapter 2.) If you fall into this category, use a lens that has a focal 
length of about 55mm and you’ll be in the right ball park. As a matter of 
fact, many digital SLR kit lenses have a focal length range from 18mm to 
55mm.
 
✓ Auto-focusing points: Your camera probably has multiple auto-focus 
points. Switch to one auto-focus point in the middle of the viewfinder. 
This enables you to establish focus on your subject; the camera won’t 
be fooled into focusing on something else that is closer to the camera, 
or moves into the frame. If your subject is off-center, use your camera’s 
focus lock and exposure lock.
Establishing a post-shoot ritual
You’ve had a great photo shoot with your subject. Now it’s time to get your 
images into the computer and think about what or who you’re going to shoot 
next. If that’s all you do, you’re heading down the highway to disaster. After a 
photo shoot, there are several things you should do before the next time you 
use your camera. Here’s what I suggest you do after every shoot:
 
1. Download the images to your computer.

65
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
 
 After you download the images to your computer, you should give them 
meaningful names and add keywords. This does take a bit of time, but 
it makes it much easier to find your images after you download a few 
hundred — or a few thousand — to your computer. I cover downloading 
images and adding keywords in Chapter 10.
 
2. Back up your images to an external hard drive.
 
 This is extra work, but it prevents the loss of your valuable images if the 
hard drive on your computer ever decides to go belly-up on you. Hard 
drives are cheap these days. If your hard drive crashes in the future, 
your images are safe and sound on your external hard drive. If you don’t 
have an external hard drive, back up your images to CD or DVD discs. 
Most CDs and DVDs last only about 5 years. To safeguard your backed-
up images, purchase archival CDs or DVDs. These cost more, but most 
have life expectancies of about 35 years. 
 
3. Clean your camera.
 
 Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning the camera body. 
Clean your lenses with a soft brush and a lens-cleaning cloth. You can 
find these accessories at your local camera store.
 
4. Return your camera settings to their default states.
 
 Check all settings. For example, if you changed your white balance set-
ting to cope with tungsten light and forget to set it back, you end up with 
blue pictures the next time you shoot in bright sunlight. Make sure to 
change your ISO setting back to its lowest value as well.
 
5. Format your memory cards.
 
 If you start shooting with a partially full card, you’ll end up mixing 
images from two photo shoots. If you’re dealing with a minimal number 
of memory cards, you run out of room before you expect to. And this 
always happens at the worst possible time. Always format your cards in 
the camera.
 
6. If necessary, recharge your camera battery.
 
 Look at the battery life in your LCD monitor. If it’s close to being 
exhausted, recharge it. Some people recharge their battery after every 
shoot. It’s great to start a shoot with a full battery, but your camera bat-
tery has a limited number of charges. I advise purchasing at least one 
extra battery and keep the spare fully charged.
 
7. Remove the battery from the camera.
 
 Batteries discharge when left in the camera. When you remove the 
battery from the camera, it holds its current charge until the next time 
you use it. 

66
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Editing Your Images
Many people let the camera do all the work, download the images to the 
computer, and then burn them to a disc and take them to a local camera shop 
or printing kiosk to get prints. But the camera doesn’t always get it right. 
Have you ever seen images that look very blue? These images have a color 
cast that will show up when printed. That is, of course, unless you correct it. 
That’s what an image-editing application is for. With an image-editing applica-
tion, you can fix and enhance your images. You can also crop them to size, 
add special effects, and much more. In the following sections, I introduce you 
to image-editing applications and show you a few of the things you can do 
with them.
Choosing an image editor
Many digital cameras come with an image-editing program. Image-editing 
applications are like cars — some come full featured and others are stripped 
down to the bare bones. The image-editing chapters in this book are based 
on Photoshop Elements 8. If this application came with your camera, you’re 
in luck. If it didn’t, consider purchasing this feature- rich application. It retails 
for less than $100 and gives you the capability of organizing your photos and 
then editing them. 
Sorting, ranking, and other delights
After downloading images to your computer, you may be tempted to just 
leave them as is and move on to your next photo shoot. If you use your 
camera only a couple of times a year, this may be okay. But the fact that 
you’re reading this book leads me to believe that you take a lot of pictures, or 
soon will be. When you take a lot of pictures, you end up with some duds. So 
how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? You rate your images. After 
you rate them, you delete the duds.
Okay, so you’ve rated your images and deleted the duds. After a couple of 
months, you end up with a huge folder full of images that were named by the 
camera. And your Aunt Edith asks you for a print of that wonderful portrait 
you took of her last July. That’s when you realize that searching for a single 
image among thousands is like looking for the proverbial needle in the hay-
stack. Fear not, intrepid portrait photographer. In Chapter 10, I show you how 
to organize your images using Photoshop Elements 7.

67
 Chapter 3: Getting to Know Digital Photography
Working with RAW files
When the RAW format was first introduced, photographers didn’t embrace 
it because the images needed to be processed before you could do anything 
else with them. The first applications to process RAW images were hard to 
work with, and you had to process one image at a time. Is it any wonder that 
photographers would rather endure a root canal instead of processing a 
couple of hundred RAW images?
The current batch of RAW processors are much better than their predeces-
sors. They’re easier to work with, and they enable you to process lots of 
images quickly. Photoshop Elements 7 uses a watered-down version of the 
Camera Raw editor that ships with the full version of Photoshop. But you can 
still do a lot with it. I show you how to process images with the Photoshop 
Elements 7 version of the Camera Raw editor in Chapter 10.
Tweaking your images
Many people think the images photographed with digital cameras aren’t as 
crisp as those shot with film cameras. I agree with this assessment. There are 
a number of reasons for this, but I won’t bore you with a lot of technical info. 
You can, however, make your images look their best when you edit them. You 
can make them look just like the scene or person you photographed, or you 
take a few extra steps and make them look better. Some people think this is 
cheating. However, what photographers do with image-editing applications 
installed on their computers is the same thing that film photographers did 
in their darkrooms. If you think Ansel Adams didn’t tweak his images in the 
darkroom, you are mistaken. In fact, a good image-editing application func-
tions as a digital darkroom. I show you how to tweak your portraits in Parts 
III and IV.

Becoming a Portrait Photographer
In This Chapter
▶ Thinking like a photographer
▶ Practice makes perfect
▶ Shooting portraits
▶ Thinking like a photojournalist
You’ve got your brand-spanking new, 14-megapixel camera, and now 
you just want to go out and shoot something. But you’re not sure what 
to shoot, or how to go about it. It’s kind of like being all dressed up with no 
place to go. Many new photographers, and a lot of old-timers, are tempted to 
take the camera, point it at the first thing that moves, and shoot. But photog-
raphy is so much more than that. Good photographers don’t happen over-
night. Photography is a discipline, just like basket weaving, albeit 
a lot more fun. In this chapter, I discuss some of the things 
that go into the makeup of a good photographer.
Seeing, Thinking, and Acting
In order to take a good picture, you’ve got to 
have the right equipment. But the right equip-
ment doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a good, or even 
mediocre, picture. Getting a good or great picture 
is all about you. Your unique personality, vision, and 
creativity is what separates your photographs from 
those taken by the guy down the street who owns the 
same digital camera. Have you ever looked at two pho-
tographs of the same person, place, or thing, yet they look 
completely different? That’s where the skill and unique vision 
of each photographer comes into play. Compare Ansel Adams’ fine 
art photographs of Yosemite to tourist snapshots, and you’ll see what I mean.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Being in the moment
Some people think of photography like a religion. They approach their equip-
ment and their subject with reverence, awe, and wonder. I’m sure you’ve seen 
photographs that have brought out those feelings in you. There’s no reason 
you can’t work to create your own jaw-dropping images. One of the best skills 
you can develop as a photographer is being in the moment. What I mean by 
that is experiencing the present moment and not thinking about anything else 
but the subject you’re about to photograph. If you’re distracted by things you 
have to do later in the day, you can’t focus on your photography. When you’re 
not thinking about anything in particular, but observing what’s around you, 
you notice things that would normally pass you by. This is important in por-
trait photography as well. When you’re giving your full attention to your sub-
ject, she knows it and will work with you. You’ll also notice things about your 
subject that you wouldn’t if you just glance superficially and snap the shutter. 
You get better pictures when you’re focused on what you’re doing and not fret-
ting about what you’re going to cook for dinner.
Practicing ’til your images are pixel-perfect
If you use your camera only once in a blue moon, your pictures will show it. 
Letting your gear gather dust in the closet isn’t the way to become a better 
photographer. Use your camera every chance you get. Consider joining a 
local camera club. Networking with other photographers is a wonderful way 
to get new information. You can also find a mentor in a photography club. 
Strike up a friendship with an experienced photographer and tell her you’d 
like to tag along the next time she does a photo shoot.
The best way to practice portrait photography is to take pictures of people 
every chance you get. Tell your friends and relatives about your love of pho-
tography, and ask them if they’d be willing to let you photograph them every 
now and again. Practice your photography when you see something that 
inspires you, such as a compelling portrait from a magazine, or a picture you 
see on the Web. With the picture fresh in your mind, try your best to create a 
reasonable facsimile with a friend or relative.
Becoming a student of photography
When you decide to seriously pursue portrait photography, you can find a 
lot of resources. Great portrait photography is all around you. You’ll find 
portraits of the rich and famous in magazines like People and Us. You’ll also 
find portraits of people like you and me in those magazines. Advertisers use 
portraits all the time when promoting their client’s wares. Your local news-
papers and magazines are also a great resource for portrait photography. 
Advertisements for lawyers can be great examples of formal portrait photog-
raphy, and advertisements for products such as swimming pools and barbe-
cue grills can be the inspiration for great candid photographs.

71
 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
When you see a portrait in a magazine, study the picture carefully. Look at 
the subject’s pose and try to figure out the light source for the portrait. Look 
at the subject’s eyes. You’ll see bright spots that are a dead giveaway to how 
the photographer illuminated his subject. These are known as catch lights. 
The size and shape of the catch lights give you clues. If the catch lights are 
large and rectangular, the photograph was probably taken using soft boxes in 
a studio. If the catch lights are fairly large and round, the photographer prob-
ably bounced studio strobes into an umbrella (see Figure 4-1). You may also 
see catch lights that look like windows. If this is the case, the photographer 
used natural light to illuminate his subject.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Another great way to understand portrait photography is to study the mas-
ters. Annie Leibovitz, for example, is a wonderful portrait photographer. She’s 
photographed musicians, actors, and other celebrities since the 1970s. You 
can find examples of her work online and in books that you can find in your 
local bookstore. Her portraits epitomize the concept of capturing a true like-
ness of the person. Another excellent portrait photographer is Greg Gorman. 
If you like to study the work of the old masters, Google Arnold Newman. He 
created some wonderful environmental portraits. If you like the gritty style of 
street photography, Google Henri Cartier-Bresson.
You can also find wonderful examples of portrait photography in online 
galleries. If you see a photograph that inspires you, type the photographer’s 
name into your favorite search engine to find online galleries of his work. LIFE 
magazine has a wonderful online gallery with lots of portrait photography. 
Visit www.life.com (see Figure 4-2), and navigate to the celebrity section. 
The site also has a search feature. Type a celebrity’s or politician’s name in 
the search field to view photos of that person.

 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
Never leave home without a camera
You can’t ask a photo opportunity to wait while you go home to get your 
camera. Photo opportunities happen when you least expect them. Therefore, 
you should never leave home without a camera. And no, the camera in your 
cellphone doesn’t count. If you’re nervous about taking an expensive camera 
with you wherever you go, I don’t blame you. I feel the same way. That’s why 
I bought a relatively inexpensive point-and-shoot camera that I do carry with 
me everywhere I go. When I see something I want to photograph, I reach in 
the glove box of my car, grab my trusty point-and-shoot, and snap the pic-
ture. For more information on choosing a second camera, see Chapter 2.
Waiting for the light
Landscape photographers arrive at a scene they want to photograph and 
often patiently wait for the right light, or wait until a cloud moves into the 
frame to get the perfect picture. Sometimes they’ll backtrack to a spot later 
when they know conditions will be better. Good landscape photographers 
are very patient. Patience is a virtue that all photographers need to cultivate. 
When you’re working with a subject, you need to give her time to relax in 
front of the lens when you’re shooting formal portraits. When you’re shooting 
candid pictures of your friends and family, minutes may pass when nothing 
exciting happens. Don’t put the camera away yet. If you wait patiently, some-
thing will happen that piques your interest and compels you to compose a 
picture and press the shutter button.
Working with Your Subjects
When you take someone’s picture, you’re interacting with that person. The 
success of the photos you take depends on how well the two of you hit it off. 
You also have to take the lead and tell your subjects what to do. If you just 
point the camera and expect great poses to appear like magic, you’re in for a 
big surprise. Being observant is a necessity no matter what type of photogra-
phy you do. When you’re a portrait photographer, you have to observe your 
subjects. When they appear relaxed, you’re ready to take control and start 
clicking the shutter button.
In portrait photography, there are no signposts that say Scenic Overlook. 
Your job as a photographer is to collaborate creatively with your subject. Use 
your skills and creativity to bring out your subject’s most endearing char-
acteristic, but remember not to overlook the flaws. These combinations of 
her most endearing qualities and her flaws are what make her truly unique. 
Combine these to create a truly flattering portrait. This means you really 

74
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
have to see your subject and look past the familiar. Your subject has an inner 
and outer beauty. A good portrait captures both. Experienced photographers 
do this automatically when they look through the viewfinder. Don’t be in a 
rush to take a photograph. Slow down and really see your subject. In the fol-
lowing sections, I tell you how to take command of the situation and gain rap-
port with your subject.
Photographing people you know
Photographing friends or loved ones can be a challenge. They’re not used to 
having a camera in front of them. And the fact that you’re behind the lens can 
make matters even more difficult. I mean, after all, they know you as a family 
member, not a portrait photographer. But if you show your friends and family 
that you take your photography seriously, they’ll relax. Here are a few tips for 
photographing people you know:
 
✓ Tell your subject your goals for the photo shoot. (See the upcoming 
“Defining Your Goals” section for tips on how to set those goals.)
 
✓ Compliment your subject about how great she looks. If your subject 
resembles a well known person, say something like “Jennifer Aniston 
looks a lot like you.” That compliment carries a lot more weight than 
“You look like Jennifer Aniston.” Sincere flattery will relax your subject.
 
✓ If your subject is female and you’re a man, always ask permission 
when you have to touch her to adjust a pose. In fact, if you don’t know 
your subject well, it’s a good idea to ask before touching no matter what 
gender you are and what gender your subject is.
 
✓ Take photographs of people doing things they love. You’ll get your 
best shots of people you know when they’re relaxed or doing something 
they love. It’s rare to get good formal portraits of people who don’t often 
have their pictures taken. (See Figure 4-3.)
 
✓ When you’re photographing friends and family, consider doing envi-
ronmental portraits where they work and play.
When you photograph someone you know well or love, you’re photograph-
ing familiar landscape. You can see this person in your mind’s eye. When 
you photograph someone you know well, dig deep and look past the familiar. 
Remember the endearing characteristics of the person, her inner beauty, to 
create a stunning photograph that represents the person’s true character 
and isn’t a cliché. Study your subject carefully until you find your photo-
graph. Try several different compositions until the photograph comes to you. 
Sometimes, you’ll have to take a lot of pictures to get the ideal photograph of 
a person you know well.

Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
When you photograph your subject, don’t label her. Your subject’s name may 
be Jane, but you’re not photographing Jane. You’re photographing a vibrant 
human being, a special person. Your job is to show your subject in her best 
light. Not doing so is like reading the wine label and never tasting the wine. 
To see your subject, and create a good photograph, look past the labels that 
identify your subject and capture her true essence digitally.
Taking pictures of strangers
When you’re on vacation, or traveling, you’ll meet interesting people that 
you may want to photograph. It takes a bit of nerve to walk up to a perfect 
stranger and ask to take his picture. Here are a few tips for photographing 
strangers:
 
✓ When you want to take someone’s picture, walk up to her, smile, and 
tell her you’re a photographer.
 
✓ Tell your subject she has an interesting face that you’d love to capture.
 
✓ Never travel alone when you want to photograph people. Safety in 
numbers.
 
✓ Make sure you’re in a safe part of town before you start photograph-
ing. Ask the hotel concierge if there are any areas of town that are 
unsafe. Taxi drivers are another good source for local information.
 
✓ If you’re traveling to a foreign country, find out something about the 
culture. Photography may be taboo. You’ll insult the locals if you dress 
or act inappropriately. Always show respect for people when you’re in 
a foreign country, or for that matter, anywhere you travel. This is espe-
cially important if you’re toting a camera.
 
✓ If you don’t speak the language of the country you’re visiting, hold the 
camera up in front of the person you want to photograph and smile. If 
you get a nod of the head and a smile in return, you’re good to go. If the 
subject moves his head from side to side, move on.
 
✓ Smile and maintain eye contact while you’re photographing your 
subject. After you take the picture, smile. If you know how to say “thank 
you” in your subject’s language, do so. If not, consider learning how to 
say the phrase. Common courtesy goes a long way.
 
✓ If you’re photographing a child, make sure you get permission from 
his parents first.
 
✓ Don’t travel in a large group. You’ll get better results when you travel in 
a small group, or with a buddy who can watch your back. Anyone would 
be overwhelmed at the sight of 15 or 20 photographers approaching. 
Travel alone only if it’s safe to do so. The image in Figure 4-4 was photo-
graphed in San Francisco’s Chinatown. The shopkeeper’s red apron 
caught my eye and made an interesting composition with the red apples.

78
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
 
When you move to a new town, or go on vacation, wander around interesting 
areas of the city and photograph scenes that appeal to you. You’ll find inter-
esting people to photograph as well.
Candid photography
Candid photographs tell more about a person then a formal portrait. As 
photographers, we must be alert and perceptive enough to realize when our 
subject is being herself. This means letting go of preconceived notions about 
your subject and waiting for the spontaneous moment when the true nature 
of your subject is revealed. When you see your subject doing something that 
captures your interest or piques your curiosity, quickly compose the picture 
and click the shutter before the moment is gone (see Figure 4-5). 
Figure 4-5: Candid photos of children can be fascinating.
Gaining rapport
If you and your subject don’t hit it off, you’re never going to get a good 
portrait. So before you start taking pictures, your goal is to relax your sub-
ject and get him talking about something. Begin by talking about topics 
that interest you.When you find a subject to which your subject responds 
enthusiastically, ask your subject for his opinions about the topic. This will 

79
 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
be easier to do if you know your subject well. I recently did a portrait ses-
sion for a local attorney, and I knew he was a big fan of Jerry Seinfeld, so I 
started talking about memorable episodes of the Seinfeld show. When he 
started laughing, I started taking pictures.
If you’re photographing someone you don’t know very well, you can quickly 
gain rapport by using a technique called mirroring. Observe how the person 
communicates with you. Does she use her hands? Does she speak fast? 
Does she use a lot of hip phrases? Find out how she communicates and then 
mirror what she does. Just don’t go over the top so that what you’re doing is 
blatantly obvious. When you mirror someone, the person thinks you’re a kin-
dred spirit and will relax in front of the camera.
Lights, camera, action
No matter what type of portrait you’re taking, a little bit of planning goes 
a long way toward getting the results you’re after. If you’re going to take 
formal portraits of a friend or family member at his place of work, make sure 
you know the location. Figure out which area will be the best to capture the 
photographs you’re after. You’ll get the best shots when you’re in control 
of the situation. Before the shoot, rearrange the furniture and get rid of any 
obstacles. Set up your equipment ahead of time. If your subject’s desk is clut-
tered, ask him to clear away everything but the essentials. After that’s done, 
look around the office for something that belongs to your subject, something 
that says something about him, and place it on the desk. For example, if your 
subject loves automobiles and has a collection of small die-cast automobiles, 
place his favorite on the desk. You can use items on the desk as integral parts 
of the image. The objects tell viewers something about your subject and 
become points of interest. When placing objects, remember the rules of 
composition that I show you in Chapter 5.
If you’re taking pictures of your subject on location, choose a location that 
you know well. If your subject tells you the location where she wants the 
pictures taken, check the place out ahead of time. First and foremost, make 
sure the location is workable. You’ll need some items of interest to spice up 
the images. If you’ve got interesting architectural details such as a staircase, 
you’ve got an interesting backdrop for your subject. (See Figure 4-6.) You can 
also use foliage to frame your subject and direct the viewer’s eye. 
Whether you’re doing a location shoot, or formal portraits in your makeshift 
studio, take control of the shoot from the start. Tell your subject where to 
stand or sit, and then tell her your goals for the photo shoot and ask her 
if they coincide with what she has in mind. When you’ve gained rapport 
with your subject and she relaxes, start taking pictures. While you’re taking 
the pictures, pay attention to what you see in the viewfinder. If you notice 
wrinkled clothing, or a piece of jewelry such as a locket that isn’t centered, 

80
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
tell her what you’ve noticed and ask her to make a few adjustments. You’ll 
also be responsible for telling her how to pose. I cover posing your subject in 
Chapter 6.
Figure 4-6: Use architectural and natural elements in your composition. 
Defining Your Goals
Before you photograph someone, you should have a clear idea what the 
final image will look like. If you don’t have a goal for the picture or the photo 
shoot, you’re wasting your time and your subject’s time. Of course, the goal 

81
 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
doesn’t have to be a perfect portrait. You can set up a photo session to exper-
iment with new ideas, master a new technique, or perfect a technique such as 
lighting your portraits. After all, practice does make perfect.
When you know why you’re taking the picture, you’ll know what settings to 
use, how to light the photo, which lens to use, and so on. If you’re creating a 
portrait for someone, you adhere to the standard rules of portrait photogra-
phy as outlined in this book. However, if you’re creating a portrait for your-
self, you can get as creative as you want. You can shoot from different and 
unique vantage points, tilt the camera, and so on.
What is your center of interest?
When you create a portrait of a person, or a group of people, decide on the 
main point of interest in the photo. For some photos, it may be the person’s 
face. Or if you’re creating a portrait of a family member who’s a pianist, a 
picture of him playing the piano would be appropriate, and your center of 
interest would be his hands on the keys. Sometimes, you have more than one 
vantage point. When this is the case, you can compose the photo in such a 
manner that one center of interest leads the viewer’s eye to the other center 
of interest. In Figure 4-7, I used barbells and the exercise ball as visual props 
to draw the viewers into the image. The athletes’ heads form an oval that 
leads the viewer through the photo. Each person is a center of interest, but 
the man on the exercise ball is the lead trainer. I composed the image accord-
ing to the rule of thirds and moved until his head was in the proper position. 
For more information on composing your images and the rule of thirds, see 
Chapter 5.
What is your best vantage point?
The decision you make on your best vantage point depends on what you’re 
photographing. In most instances, you want to be eye-to-eye with your sub-
ject. With adults, this is fairly easy to do. However, when you photograph 
children, you’ll have to squat down, or drop to one knee. Pets and wildlife 
should also be photographed at eye level. When you photograph small 
subjects from above, the results aren’t flattering. Of course, any rule can be 
broken. Refer to Figure 4-7, where I intentionally shot the image from a low 
vantage point to accentuate the lean physiques of the standing athletes.
 
If you’re capturing a full body shot of a short person, you can make her look 
taller by shooting from below. Drop to one knee, rotate the camera 90 degrees 
(Portrait format), and take the picture.

82
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
Figure 4-7: Define your center of interest.
What else is in the picture?
The only time you’re not bothered by other objects is when you shoot a por-
trait against a solid color background such as a wall or cloth backdrop. But 
even then, you have to notice everything in the viewfinder or LCD monitor. 
If your subject is too close to the background, you may notice wrinkles from 
a cloth backdrop, or texture from a wall. If this is the case, ask your subject 
to move forward. Then shoot the picture in Portrait mode, or in Aperture 
Priority mode with a large aperture to blur the background.

83
 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
 
Muslin backgrounds get wrinkled when you store them. A product called 
Downy Wrinkle Releaser gets rid of wrinkles in short order. Set up the back-
ground, and follow the manufacturer’s directions to get rid of the wrinkles. 
Wait for the backdrop to dry, and you’re ready to start your portrait session.
When you’re taking pictures of subjects on location, you often have unwanted 
objects, such as telephone poles, in the background. Sometimes you have to 
make a decision to include the distracting elements in the image and clone 
them out in an image-editing application. But that takes time. If you have the 
alternative to move your subject slightly and make the distracting elements 
disappear, that’s always your best option. You can also move to a different 
place in the same general area with a pleasing background and no distracting 
elements.
Thinking like a Photojournalist
A photojournalist records the history of everyday life and the world around 
him, capturing compelling photographs of man and his environment. Anyone 
with an avid interest in photography can create a photographic journal of his 
life, and also document his family’s life. All you need to do is carry a camera 
with you wherever you go and take photographs of the things and people 
that interest you. This isn’t exactly portrait photography, although you will 
be able to practice your portrait photography skills while taking pictures of 
the people in your life. The other trait so common to a photojournalist is his 
power of observation. A good photojournalist seems to have a sixth sense 
and knows when something interesting is about to happen. Yes, this is a gift. 
But it also comes from years of photography experience. If capturing a slice 
of your life and your family’s life digitally sounds like something you might be 
interested in, study the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, who is considered by 
many to be the father of modern photojournalism.
Telling a story
When you photograph a family event with a journalist mindset, you’re telling 
a story. No story is complete without a beginning, middle, and ending. So if 
you’re going to photograph an event like your grandmother’s birthday, get 
there early and take pictures of the host preparing the party. Take close-up 
pictures of the birthday cake, candid portraits of the host setting the table, 
and so on. If it’s a surprise party, take pictures of the guests arriving. The 
picture of your grandmother entering the room and being surprised by the 
guests will be a portrait in and of itself. If you have a zoom lens with a focal 
length that’s the 35mm equivalent of 85mm, zoom to that focal length, and 
have one of the guests enter through the door. You’ll know right where you 
need to stand to get a great shot of the birthday girl with a surprised look on 
her face. 

84
Part I: Introducing Portrait Photography 
When the party starts, you can photograph the guests interacting with your 
grandmother. This part of the party can also be great for getting candid shots 
of your relatives. Just make sure you don’t photograph them while they’re 
eating. A photo of a person stuffing a taco in his mouth is not a good thing 
unless you’re taking pictures as part of an advertising campaign for a national 
taco chain. Other great photo opportunities are when she opens her gifts and 
when she blows out the candles. 
When the party’s over, you can create some slice-of-life photos. Take a pic-
ture of your grandmother’s gifts, a partially eaten piece of cake, crumpled up 
gift wrap, and so on. After the event, you can post the photos online in a Web 
gallery. If it’s a really special event, like your parent’s 50th wedding anniver-
sary, create a photo book using pictures from the event. 
Being the fly on the wall
If you decide you like being a photojournalist, the next step is to develop 
some techniques for capturing great photos of your family at work and play. 
After you make it known that you’re the family photographer, they’ll get used 
to seeing you with a camera around your neck. But the camera still sticks out 
like a sore thumb, and your friends and family will be on guard if they see you 
quickly raise the camera.
Some people get very self-conscious when you point a camera at them. So 
you have to be kind of sneaky and be the proverbial fly on the wall. You can’t 
magic the camera away, but you can be a bit clandestine in your approach. If 
you live in a two-story house with a balcony, you can be a fly on the balcony. 
Another trick is to do all your composing through the camera’s LCD monitor. 
This is a breeze if you’ve got a point-and-shoot. Put the camera on the table, 
compose your picture, and press the shutter button. If you have a digital SLR 
with Live View, enable Live View, compose your image, and press the shut-
ter button when one of your family members does something interesting. 
Another technique you can use is to focus the camera on an object that is 
the same distance from you as your subject is. Then when your subject does 
something interesting, quickly compose the picture and press the shutter 
button. 
Another way you can be a fly on the wall is to set up your camera in a room 
where you want to take a picture. For example, if you want some photos of 
your wife preparing a meal, camp out in the kitchen. When she sees you with 
the camera, she’ll look at you when she starts to prepare the meal. Smile 
and fiddle with your camera. After a few minutes, she’ll become engrossed 
in what she’s doing. Then you can calmly raise the camera and squeeze off a 
couple of shots. If she gives you the hairy eyeball, smile and fiddle with the 
camera some more.

85
 Chapter 4: Becoming a Portrait Photographer
Becoming the family historian
After you delve into the world of portrait photography and become familiar 
with your camera, you’ll want to use it more and more. What better way to be 
of service to your family than to become the family historian? You can shoot 
portraits of your children at each birthday and portraits of your parents’ spe-
cial occasions, such as wedding anniversaries. If your children are involved in 
sports, take music lessons, or participate in any special events, take photos 
of these occasions. Portraits of your children dressed up in their uniforms, 
or with their instruments, will spark wonderful memories in later years. Make 
sure you archive everything so you’ll be able to get the photos 10, 15, or 20 
years in the future. At that point in time, you may want to consider creating 
a photo book of the family history. Photo books make wonderful holiday gifts. 
The genius of digital photography
The genius of digital photography is immediacy. The old days of waiting for 
your film to be developed and returned from the lab are gone. You know if 
you got the shot as soon as it appears on your camera’s LCD monitor. You 
also never have to pay for film again. Ever. But for the most part, people have 
made the switch to digital because they can capture their images on cards 
the size of a postage stamp, they don’t want to worry about film expiration 
dates, and so on.
But with these advantages is also a curse. If you’re not careful, the very 
genius of digital photography can turn you into a bad photographer. You 
don’t pay for film so you tend to shoot more images. This is a good thing if 
you take good photographs. But if you just shoot everything that pops up in 
front of your camera, you’re going to get a lot of bad photos that end up in 
the trash bin. To take advantage of the genius of digital photography, be in 
the moment and do your best to make every image a keeper. If you apply the 
techniques in this chapter, you’ll be more focused on your subject. Practice 
also enters into the equation. When you know your camera like the back of 
your hand, and you apply all of your attention to your photographing the 
subject before you, you’re well on the way to utilizing the genius of digital 
photography and capturing compelling photographs.

Composing Your Portraits
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the right settings
▶ Choosing the right focal length
▶ Composing your images
T
he glorious moment has arrived. Your victim — I mean subject — has 
arrived for his portrait session. Now it’s time to put your finely honed 
portrait photography skills to work and take some really fine portraits. But 
you’ll never get a really fine portrait if you don’t use the right camera settings 
or choose the right focal length. Then there’s the matter of composing the 
picture. Yes, you have to put some thought into this process. Just randomly 
pointing the camera at your subject and pressing the shutter button won’t 
get you a good portrait. There are rules of composition you can 
follow. But if you’re a rebellious kind of photographer and you 
know the rules, you can break them. In this chapter, I show 
you some suggested camera settings and rules you can 
follow to take your portrait photography to the next 
level.
Using the Right Camera Settings
Most digital cameras come with an Auto mode, 
which you find on a dial that is usually on top of 
the camera on the right side. Your camera’s Auto 
mode does all the thinking for you, but it has no idea 
of what your subject is. It makes its decisions based on 
the available light and other factors. For portrait photog-
raphy, the Auto setting is not a good thing. It makes decisions 
based on normal point-and-shoot photography. You have different 
goals when you create a portrait. For some reason, camera manufacturers 
assume that a good number of their patrons are idiots who haven’t read a 
Dummies book on digital photography and use Auto as the default mode.

Fortunately, there are other shooting modes you can use for specific situa-
tions. In the following sections, I show you the ideal camera settings for por-
trait photography.
Choosing a camera mode
You’re not getting the most out of your camera if you let it make all the deci-
sions for you. Portrait photography is a different breed of cat. Your goal 
is to accentuate your subject, not the background. Your best options for 
portrait photography are to use Portrait mode or Aperture Priority mode. 
Aperture Priority mode gives you the best control. However, if you still want 
the camera to do most of the work, Portrait mode is the best option for you. 
These modes are described in the next two sections.
Shooting portraits using Portrait mode
When you rotate the dial to the funny icon that looks like a woman with an 
oversized floppy hat (see Figure 5-1), you’ve selected Portrait mode. When 
you shoot in Portrait mode, the camera chooses a shutter speed and aper-
ture that creates a soft, out-of-focus background. This gives the photo a 
dreamy look and draws the viewer’s attention to your subject.
Portrait mode
Figure 5-1: Portrait mode is your first choice for portrait 
photography.

91
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
The camera chooses the largest aperture based on the available light. This 
can pose a problem if you’re taking pictures in bright light. The aperture the 
camera chooses may not be enough to render the background as an out-of-
focus blur. When this occurs, move your subject to a shaded area. Shade or 
diffused light is a better option when creating a portrait of your subject. Your 
results using Portrait mode will be better with digital SLR cameras because 
they have bigger sensors. Small point-and-shoot cameras will always give you 
a sharper background, even when you photograph using Portrait mode.
Shooting portraits in Aperture Priority mode
When you take pictures in Aperture Priority mode, you choose the aperture, 
and the camera determines the shutter speed needed for a properly exposed 
image. When you shoot in this mode, you have complete control over depth 
of field. When you shoot portraits, you want a shallow depth of field to blur 
the background. When you shoot in Aperture Priority mode, you have better 
control over depth of field. Then it’s a matter of marrying the right focal 
length with a large aperture as a prelude to capturing wonderful portraits. 
Most digital cameras have an option for Aperture Priority mode on a dial (see 
Figure 5-2), which is generally found on the top-right side of the camera.

field.

Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Choosing a focal length and aperture
When you create a portrait, if you’ve dialed in Aperture Priority mode, you 
get your best results when you choose the proper focal length and aperture. 
A wide-angle focal length gives you a greater depth of field, even when you’re 
shooting in Portrait mode, or when you’re choosing a large aperture (low 
f-stop number) when shooting in Aperture Priority mode. Wide-angle focal 
lengths are ideally suited for taking pictures of landscapes, not for portrait 
photography. Many beginning portrait photographers who don’t know better 
get close to their subjects and use a wide-angle focal length. This tends to 
make the object closest to the camera — usually the subject’s nose — look 
much bigger than it actually is.
Most portrait photographers agree that 85mm is the ideal focal length for por-
traits. The best way to get a good portrait is to move away from your subject 
and zoom in. If you’re capturing portraits with a point-and-shoot camera with 
a zoom lens, zoom in to a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm. 
Many digital point-and-shoot cameras have the 35mm equivalent marked on 
the lens barrel. Your camera may display a bar that shows the amount of mag-
nification you’ve zoomed to on the LCD monitor. If this is the case, you can 
come close to the ideal focal length by doing a bit of math. For example, my 
Canon PowerShot G10 has a zoom lens with a 35mm equivalent range, from 
28mm to 140mm. When the bar is approximately three-quarters of the way to 
the end, I know I’m somewhere near the 35mm equivalent of 85mm.
If you have a digital SLR, you can precisely zoom to 85mm. However, if your 
camera has a sensor that’s smaller than a frame of 35mm film, you have 
something known as a focal length multiplier to contend with. (See Chapter 
2.) Multiply this by the selected focal length to ascertain the 35mm equiva-
lent for this focal length on your camera. For most digital SLRs with a sensor 
smaller than a 35mm frame, 50mm will get you in the right ballpark. 
The next piece of the puzzle is the aperture. You want to choose the largest 
aperture you can for the existing lighting conditions. If you’re taking pic-
tures in diffuse light, or on an overcast day, you can easily achieve this goal. 
However, in bright lighting conditions, you may not be able to get a properly 
exposed picture shooting with the largest aperture. If this is the case, you can 
screw a neutral density filter to the end of your digital SLR lens (see Chapter 
2) to reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. If you own a digital 
point-and-shoot camera, you may have a menu option to enable a neutral 
density filter. Check your camera manual to see if you have this option on 
your camera.
 
When you shoot a portrait with a lens that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm 
or longer, and use your largest aperture (lowest f-stop number), you have a 
very shallow depth of field, especially when you’re using a fast lens with a 

93
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
minimum f-stop value of 2.8 or less. In fact, the depth of field is so shallow 
that parts of your subject’s face may be slightly out of focus. When you’re 
shooting at your lowest f-stop value, switch to a single auto-focus point (good 
advice any time you take pictures of people), and focus on your subject’s 
eyes. Your viewer’s attention is first drawn to the eyes, so when the eyes are 
in sharp focus, it gives the illusion that the entire face is in sharp focus.
Specifying an ISO setting
As noted in Chapter 3, the ISO setting determines how sensitive the camera is 
to light. When you increase the ISO, you run the risk of adding digital noise to 
your image. Whenever possible, always use the lowest ISO setting available. 
However, if you’re creating portraits in very low light, you may end up with 
a shutter speed that is too slow to hand-hold the camera and still get a blur-
free picture. For more information on ISO settings, see Chapter 3.
 
If you want to see how far you can increase the ISO and still get acceptable 
pictures, take some photos of a landscape with a clear blue sky. With each 
shot, increase the ISO to the next highest rating. After taking the pictures, 
download them to your computer and open them in your image-editing pro-
gram. Zoom in to about 200 percent and examine the sky for evidence of 
noise. Note the ISO where the noise starts looking ugly and then you know 
you can use the next lowest ISO rating and still get acceptable pictures. 
The ideal digital SLR portrait lens
Because most portrait photographers agree 
that 85mm is the ideal focal length for portraits, 
many portrait photographers purchase an 
85mm prime lens with a large aperture and use 
it exclusively for head-and-shoulders portraits. 
An 85mm f/1.8 lens gives you the best of both 
worlds. The focal length is ideal for portraits, 
and the large aperture gives you a shallow 
depth of field, which ensures that your viewers’ 
attention will be focused on your subject. 
There are faster 85mm lenses. Canon makes an 
85mm f/1.2 lens in their L series. Recently, I was 
talking with a Canon rep at a trade show. He 
says the L series lens is too sharp for portrait 
photography and recommends their 85mm f/1.8 
for portrait photography.

Composing Your Images
Digital cameras are great for creating portraits of friends, family, and interest-
ing people. With a digital camera, you have the ability to take a lot of pictures 
and store them on a memory card. And you don’t have to pay for film or 
developing. But the point-and-shoot mentality can also be a curse. If you just 
point a camera at someone without thinking, and snap the shutter, you’re 
creating a snapshot. In the following sections, I show you some time-honored 
methods professional photographers use to compose their images.
Composing your picture in the viewfinder
When you compose an image, your viewfinder or LCD monitor is your 
window to the world. When you compose a picture, you have to make a deci-
sion about what to leave in the image and what to leave out of the image. 
Include only enough to tell your story. Anything else is excess information 
and will detract from the image. Sometimes, zooming in is all you need to do 
to exclude unwanted elements; other times, you’ll have to move or ask your 
subject to move.
 
Check the edges of the frame: Some photographers make sure their subject is 
composed perfectly, but they forget to look all around the viewfinder. If 
you’re taking a picture indoors and forget to clear the breakfast table behind 
your subject, your photo won’t be very pleasing. The same thing applies for 
outdoor photos. Garbage cans in the background will ruin an otherwise well-
composed shot.
You can also diminish the appearance of elements within an image through 
use of focal length and aperture. For example, if you’re shooting a portrait 
of a college president on location, you may want to include a recognizable 
element in the background. Of course, you don’t want it in sharp focus. That 
would distract the viewer’s attention from your subject. You can achieve this 
goal by choosing a focal length that will include both your subject and part of 
a building, but choose a large aperture (low f-stop number) that will blur the 
building so as not to detract attention from your subject.
Zoom in to fine-tune what’s in the viewfinder, removing elements from your 
composition until you’ve removed one too many and your story is no longer 
being told. Then recompose your picture to add the element back and take 
your picture. The practice of what to leave in and what to leave out of the 
picture becomes second nature with practice. Take lots of pictures.
Some photographers attempt to say too much about a person when they take 
her picture. For example, when you create a portrait of a person where she 
works, you’ll make some decisions on what items to include in your picture. 

95
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
You may want to include way too much stuff on the desk in your picture in an 
attempt to tell your viewers everything about your subject. The visual clutter 
will confuse your viewers. Once you decide the most important thing about 
your subject, you’ll know what to include in your picture. Anything else in the 
picture is too much information. Determine what it is you want to say about 
your subject and zero in on that. For example, if your subject is a photogra-
pher, you can create an effective portrait by taking a picture of him with the 
camera raised to his face. (See Figure 5-3.) 
Figure 5-3: The elements in the image tell a story about your subject.

96
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Defining the center of interest
The center of interest in a photo is the predominant feature in the image, 
the feature to which the viewer is first attracted. When you create an artistic 
portrait of a person, you determine what is important about that person, and 
you use your knowledge of photography and rules of composition to draw 
your viewer’s attention to the center of interest. 
It’s up to you as the photographer to determine what will be the center of 
interest in the photo. Your knowledge of the person will help to ascertain the 
true essence of the person. For example, if you were photographing cellist 
Yo-Yo Ma, it would be appropriate to include part of a cello in the picture, 
even if you’re shooting a head-and-shoulders portrait. Picture one of his 
hands around the neck of the cello, which is resting on his shoulder. Perhaps 
you’d want to include the bow in the picture. I envisioned this picture in my 
mind, but if you go to his Web site, there’s almost a carbon copy of the pic-
ture I just described.
Positioning the camera
Many photographers take pictures in landscape format, which is an image 
that’s wider than it is tall. However, when you’re photographing a scene like 
a waterfall, photographing a person, or anything that’s taller than it is wide, 
rotate the camera 90 degrees. This is known as portrait format. If you’re pho-
tographing a group of people, take the picture in landscape format. If you’re 
photographing one person, especially if you’re creating a head-and-shoulders 
portrait, rotate the camera 90 degrees. (See Figure 5-4 for an example of a 
photo in the portrait format.)
Using the rule of thirds
You’ve probably seen a lot of pictures where the subject was smack-dab in the 
middle of the frame. Everything in that type of photo might be symmetrical — 
well, at least as far as the human form can be. But there’s no intrigue, no 
mystery to the image. It’s nothing more than a snapshot. Photographers com-
monly use the rule of thirds to define a point of interest in the image. Instead 
of placing the subject in the center of the frame, the photographer positions 
the subject so that a key feature appears at a power point within the frame. 
To apply the rule of thirds, imagine that your camera viewfinder is divided 
into three sections vertically and horizontally, as shown in Figure 5-5. A power 
point is where two of those sections intersect. Some digital cameras provide a 
grid that you can use to compose your images according to the rule of thirds. 

97
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
Check your camera manual to find out how to display it. Figure 5-5 shows an 
image that has been composed using the rule of thirds. I’ve also included a 
grid overlay for reference. Notice how her left eye is aligned to a power point 
according to the rule of thirds. Your gaze is first drawn to that point of the 
photo.
Figure 5-4: Rotate the camera when shooting head-and-shoulders 
portraits.

98
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 5-5: Composing an image according to the rule of thirds.
Determining point of view
The point of view is the vantage point from which you photograph your sub-
ject. If you’re photographing an adult, you can do so from a standing position. 
If you photograph a child or pet, kneel to their level. It’s always best if you’re 
eye to eye with your subject. The exception to this rule is when you’re photo-
graphing a short person. To make the person look taller, kneel and then take 

99
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
your picture. Be careful not to tilt the camera when you’re kneeling. If you 
do, the person may look like she’s falling toward or away from you. Instead of 
tilting the camera, move back until your subject fills the frame without tilting 
the camera.
The golden ratio
The golden ratio, also known as the divine pro-
portion, has fascinated artists and scientists 
since the Renaissance. The aspect ratio of the 
golden ratio is 1:.618. A chambered nautilus (a 
sea creature) is an example of the golden ratio 
in nature. If you imagine a nautilus shell in a 
rectangle whose dimensions match the golden 
ratio, you get an idea of how you can use this 
concept when composing your images. Where 
the shell spirals down to its smallest point, you 
place your center of interest. The aspect ratio of 
most digital cameras is 1:0.6666, or 3:2. However, 
you can crop an image to the golden ratio in an 
image-editing program. If you compose your 
image with the golden ratio in mind and place 
it in a new document with dimensions that con-
form to the golden ratio, you can end up with 
an interesting image. A program called Corel 
Painter has a feature, called Divine Proportion, 
which you can use to compose an image using 
the golden ratio after the fact.

100
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
Take pictures of your subject from several different points of view. Make sure 
that one of them is a point of view most people would never see him from. 
For example, photograph a bald friend from overhead with him staring you in 
the eyes with a sardonic look on his face and one arched eyebrow. Yes, some-
times whimsy does have a place in photography.
Framing your subject
If you’re taking a photograph outdoors, look for natural frames. You can 
frame your subject in a window, frame your subject with foliage, trees, and so 
on. Naturally, frames are everywhere you look. When you frame your subject, 
you draw your viewer’s attention to your subject. You can even create whim-
sical frames by having your subject hold a picture frame around her head. 
Archways also make great frames. Or you might consider using an interesting 
door jamb to frame your subject. (See Figure 5-6.)
 
Your goal as a photographer is to capture the decisive moment that tells your 
story. When photographing a person on location, or when taking candid 
photographs, be alert and ready to act decisively, clicking the shutter when 
your subject does something interesting. If you miss the shot, don’t be afraid 
to ask your subject to repeat the pose or gesture.
Placing the horizon
When you photograph people in natural surroundings, it’s important not to 
bisect them with the horizon line. In other words, don’t place the horizon 
smack-dab in the center of the image or your subject. If you read the “Using 
the rule of thirds” section, you know that in this rule of composition, the 
scene is divided into thirds vertically and horizontally. Look at the back-
ground in your image. If there are interesting objects such as clouds or 
mountains in the background, place the horizon line in the lower third of the 
image. If you’ve got an interesting seascape in the background, or a beach, 
place the horizon line in the upper third of the image.
Using lines and natural curves in your composition
Another element you can use for composing your photo is the simple straight 
line. Sometimes, the line will be an element in a location portrait. It can also 
be the subject’s arm, her shirt collar, or a pleat in her blouse. When you 
notice a line that you want to use in your composition, compose the photo so 
that the line actually leads to a center of interest in the photo.
You can also use diagonal lines to draw your viewer into the image. If you’re 
photographing a musician with an instrument such as a flute, ask your sub-
ject to start playing. Ask your subject to move the flute a bit until it’s diago-
nal, and then compose the image so that your subject is aligned according to 

101
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
the rule of thirds, with her left hand almost intersecting a power point. The 
viewer’s eye will be drawn to the tip of the flute and follow the diagonal line 
formed by the flute to your subject (See Figure 5-7).
Figure 5-6: Create a frame around your subject.

102
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
PhotoDisc, Inc.
Figure 5-7: Using a diagonal line as part of your composition.
If you’re doing a location portrait, you can use lines from architectural ele-
ments to draw your viewer into the picture. A banister is an excellent way 
to draw your viewer up to a subject when you photograph him from a lower 
vantage point. You can use straight lines or diagonal lines. Your job as a pho-
tographer is to notice these elements and figure out how to use them to your 
advantage. 
Curves are other elements you can use to create a compelling portrait. If your 
subject has long curly hair, you can use the curls to draw your viewer into 
the picture. You can also use natural curves such as the slope of a woman’s 
shoulder, the curve from the nape of her neck, and so on. Look for naturally 
occurring curves and then figure a way to use them to move your viewer 
through the image.
 
If lines and curves are an integral part of your image, make sure the horizon 
is level. Otherwise you’ll confuse your viewers.
Using color, shapes, and texture
The beauty of digital photography is the ability to capture all visible colors 
and minute details, such as small shapes and texture. You can use these ele-
ments when you’re composing an image.

103
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
When you use color as a compositional element, you can use it to draw your 
viewer’s eye through the photograph. If there is one predominant color in the 
scene, or in your subject’s wardrobe, move the camera around until the ele-
ments fall into a pleasing pattern. If there’s a lot of red in the scene, consider 
placing a red object according to the rule of thirds. Or you may try using one 
of the other composition rules, such as using a curve to draw your viewer 
into the image. If your subject has a red rose in her hair, scatter some rose 
petals on the table in front of her and use them to draw your viewer’s eye to 
your subject and then the rose.
 
Make sure the colors in the image work well together. The colors should har-
monize with your subject’s wardrobe. If they don’t, you can change them in 
some image-editing applications. Another option is to convert the image to 
black and white in your image-editing application.
If there are similar shapes in a scene, you can use these to compose your pic-
ture. Sometimes, you have to look hard to see shapes in the viewfinder, but 
with a bit of concentration, you’ll find them. Your subject’s eyes are round. 
Perhaps she’s wearing large hoop earrings. Then you have two more circles. 
Is she wearing a ring with a round stone in it? There’s another circle. Once 
you notice the shapes in the viewfinder, you can use them to compose the 
image. Change your vantage point until you see the elements are aligned in a 
pleasing manner. You may also have to ask your subject to move in order for 
the image to come together as you envision it.
Shapes are geometric forms. If you look closely in the viewfinder, you may 
find geometry. Perhaps you can compose the image to arrange the shapes in 
a geometric form. Consider Figure 5-8. The earrings, rose, and her lips form a 
triangle. The color red is also repeated three times in the image. The triangle 
and the color lead your eyes through the image.
 
When adding objects to a scene, it’s always better to go with an odd number. 
Three objects look better than four, five better than six, and so on. But 
remember not to add too many objects to a scene to avoid visual clutter.
Using selective focus
If you use a lens with a large aperture, you can selectively focus on one part 
of the image, and the rest of the image will be soft. You can use selective 
focus when you want to draw the viewer’s attention to a specific part of the 
image. For example, if you’re creating a portrait of a person playing a violin, 
you can use selective focus to draw attention to her face. If you use a focal 
length that’s the 35mm equivalent of 85mm, her hand closest to the camera 
will be softly focused, but still recognizable. (See Figure 5-9.) Notice that the 
hand closest to the camera intersects a power point according to the rule of 
thirds. The bow adds an interesting diagonal element as well.

Figure 5-9: Using selective focus to draw attention to a specific part of the image.
If you’re not focusing on something your subject is holding, focus on your 
subject’s eyes. The rest of the image can go soft, but if the eyes aren’t in 
sharp focus, the entire image appears to be out of focus. Even out-of-focus 
details add to an image. The colors, textures, and shapes of out-of-focus 
objects marry your subject to the place.
Breaking the rules
There are many rules of composition in photography, which I cover in previ-
ous sections. However, sometimes you can break the rules and create a more 
compelling photograph. When should you break the rules? When you exam-
ine a scene through the viewfinder or LCD monitor and decide that you’ll get 
a better photograph if you don’t stick to the rules. For example, sometimes it 
makes sense to center your subject in an image, as shown in Figure 5-10. But 
notice that even though the part in her hair and her nose are centered verti-
cally in the image, the reverse S-curve her hair forms on the right side of the 
image gives you a road map to the center of attention: her eyes.

106
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 5-10: Sometimes breaking the rules results in a more interesting image.

107
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
Here are some other rules you can break:
 
✓ Maintain a level horizon line. Sometimes, you can tilt the camera diago-
nally and get an interesting picture. For example, if you take a picture 
of a cheerleader lying on the grass with her pom-poms, tilt the camera 
diagonally and compose the picture so that her feet are in the lower-left 
corner of the image, and her head is in the upper-right corner of the 
image. Figure 5-11 shows a wildlife portrait of a young alligator. I pho-
tographed him once with the log running parallel to the bottom of the 
image. After reviewing the image on my LCD monitor, I decided to take 
another picture with the log and alligator diagonally, which resulted in a 
more natural and interesting photograph.
Figure 5-11: Break the rules to get a better picture.
 
✓ Use a telephoto lens. Try using a wide-angle lens for an environmental 
portrait. For example, you can use a wide-angle lens instead of a tele-
photo lens when creating a portrait of a child in a playground to empha-
size his size in relationship to the environment.
 
✓ Shoot from the optimal vantage point. Instead of sticking to the tried-
and-true dogma of photographing your subjects at eye level, experiment 
with shooting from an unusual vantage point. For example, you can photo-
graph your child or pet from high above and have them look at you. Or try 
the opposite and photograph a very tall person from a low vantage point. 

108
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
The latter technique really makes body builders look quite intimidating. 
Another alternative is to stand on a ladder and have your subject look up 
at you. 
 
✓ Take a head-and-shoulders portrait in portrait format. If your subject 
has long, flowing hair and you’ve got a stiff breeze, don’t rotate the 
camera 90 degrees as you normally would. Using the landscape format, 
compose the image with your subject’s face on the side of the image 
facing the wind. Her hair will stream away from the wind, giving you a 
unique portrait.
 
✓ Leave room for your subject to look into. When you photograph some-
one looking pensively into the distance, you generally leave some space 
for him to look into. For a different effect, zoom in tight filling the frame 
with your subject’s face. This is also known as an extreme close-up. 
 
✓ Have one central point of interest. When you photograph a person, 
you’ve typically got one center of interest. In most cases, it’s your subject, 
or something your subject is holding. However, you can have more than 
one center of interest in a portrait. For example, if you’re photographing 
an attorney at his desk, you can strategically place a picture of his family 
according to the rule of thirds. Each center of interest lies on one of those 
power points on the rule-of-thirds grid. Having more than one center of 
interest gives your viewers more information about your subject. In the 
case of the attorney, the picture on the desk shows viewers and potential 
clients he’s a family man.
Feeding your creative muse
Great photographs are made by creative photographers who stretch the enve-
lope. You can enhance your creativity by trying new things. Schedule a time 
each week when you experiment with new techniques or new equipment. Julia 
Cameron, author of The Artist’s Way (Tarcher), calls this an “artist’s date.” 
When I do this, I limit myself to one or two lenses and I often visit familiar 
territory with someone I’ve photographed before. When you photograph a 
person you know well at a familiar place, and the goal is to enhance your cre-
ativity, you do things differently. Shoot from a different vantage point and use 
a different lens than you’d normally use for the subject. Photograph your sub-
ject against a backdrop you’ve never photographed him against before.
Great photos always inspire me to get out the camera and take some pic-
tures. Great photos can also help you become more creative. When you see a 
really great photo, dissect the image and try to figure out what the photogra-
pher did to make it so compelling. Was it an in-camera technique, or did the 
photographer do some editing after the fact to make the image pop? There 
are lots of places on the Internet where you can find great photos. One of my 
favorite places is www.photo.net. At this Web site, you’ll find many types of 
inspirational photographs, from portraits to drop-dead gorgeous landscapes. 

109
 Chapter 5: Composing Your Portraits
You can even join www.photo.net and upload your own images. Next time 
you need something to spark your creativity, look at some great photographs.
You can enhance your creativity while you’re taking pictures. Stretching the 
envelope is a wonderful way to create interesting photographs. When you’re 
photographing a friend, cut to the chase and simplify the scene to its lowest 
common denominator. A great way to do this is to use a large aperture (low 
f-stop number) and focus your camera on the most important part of the 
scene. Or you can compose your picture so the viewer’s eye is drawn to a 
single element in the image.
Do you have favorite places or things you like to photograph? Explore your 
favorite subject and create a theme of photographs. For example, if you’re a 
cat lover, photograph your cat and then photograph the neighborhood cats. 
When you photograph the same subjects or places frequently, you think of 
new ways to create interesting pictures. Your creative juices start flowing, 
and before you know it, you learn to see your favorite subject in a different 
way. I love landscapes and photographing friends and relatives in beautiful 
scenery. My main goal is to create a compelling portrait, but I use the scen-
ery to frame my subjects, or to provide a colorful out-of-focus backdrop that 
enhances the portrait.
Practice makes perfect
If you’re not an experienced photographer or haven’t dabbled in the graphic 
arts, composition may be a bit daunting at first. Here’s where the old adage 
of practice makes perfect comes into play. The first step is to master your 
camera. After you master your camera, you no longer have to think about 
which settings to use. When you take someone’s picture, you react instinc-
tively, dial in the right settings, and take the picture before the moment is 
gone. The next step is mastering the art of portrait photography.
Bug your friends, neighbors, and loved ones for photo sessions. Make com-
position a priority during your first photo shoots. Consciously look for ele-
ments you can use in your composition. Approach each photo shoot as a 
new opportunity to master the art of composing photographs. When you 
consciously think about composition, you may miss some other important 
factors. But you will slowly but surely master the rules of composition.
Consciously work on mastering one rule of composition for three or four 
photo shoots, then move on to the next rule you want to master. After a 
while, you’ll recognize the elements in your viewfinder that you can use to 
create compelling portraits. You’ll know how to compose the image instinc-
tively because of your practice. You’ll know which rule of composition is ide-
ally suited for the picture. You’ll also know when to break the rules to achieve 
the image you have in your mind’s eye. But before you can break the rules, 
you’ve got to master them.

f you really get into portrait photography, you end up photographing a 
broad spectrum of humans, from bawling babies to crotchety spinsters. 
Each subject has his own quirks, and each age group has its own special 
quirks. In addition to working with a wide and diverse group of subjects, you 
also have to concern yourself with wardrobe suggestions and, per-
haps, makeup. You can also use props in your photos. So much 
to think about. And then there’s the subject of photograph-
ing people with their pets or pets without their people. If 
you live close to wildlife, you’ve got yet another great 
subject for pictures. In this chapter, I share some 
techniques for photographing the wide spectrum 
from children to wildlife.
Photographing Children
Kids do the darnedest things. It’s your job as a pho-
tographer to capture the antics, quirks and foibles of 
children digitally. But kids come in all shapes and sizes, 
from diapered babies to adolescents. Some kids have the 
attention span of a flea. Young children have a tendency to 
be very active, running, jumping, and playing games. And you, 
the fleet-footed photographer, are responsible for capturing digital 
portraits of them.

Photographing babies
Photographing babies can be tricky, especially newborns. They’re immobile 
and sleep for long periods of time. When they do wake, they’re not the hap-
piest campers on the block, either. They tend to cry, which, combined with 
laughter, is the only communication they know. If you’re photographing a 
friend or relative’s baby, you’re invited into the home for an hour or so, and 
you capture cute pictures of the baby. Here are some tips for creating por-
traits of a baby:
 
✓ Get to their level. Most newborns are swaddled or in diapers. You’ll 
have to get to their level to get pictures of the baby’s beautiful eyes look-
ing at you. Instead of crawling on the floor, create a pile of neatly folded 
large white towels on a table. Place the baby on top of the towels. You 
can use the top towel to move the baby to a different position if your 
camera is mounted on a tripod and you’re using fixed lighting.
 
✓ Use a backdrop. Hang a clean white sheet on the wall behind the table 
on which you’ll photograph the child. Make sure the table on which 
you’re photographing the infant is a few feet away from the backdrop.
 
✓ Use props. Swaddle the newborn so you can see only her face, eyes, 
and perhaps a hand. If you’re not comfortable posing the baby, ask her 
parent for assistance. You can then place a prop, such as a freshly cut 
red rose, or perhaps a pacifier, next to the infant. You’ll get a more inter-
esting picture if you use a colorful prop that adds contrast to the image.
 
✓ Take close-up shots. Back away from the child and then zoom in. This 
will give you a pleasing close-up of the child’s cherubic face.
 
✓ Go macro. If your camera has a macro mode or you use a digital SLR and 
have a macro lens, take pictures of the newborn’s tiny hands, feet, and 
ears. Another interesting close-up is the child’s tiny hand grabbing his 
father’s finger. For a contrast of new and old, take a picture of the baby’s 
hand grabbing one of his grandparent’s fingers.
 
✓ Take a sequence of images. Newborns make subtle movements when 
they change position. (See Figure 6-1.) If you take a single shot, you may 
miss something interesting. Switch your camera to continuous shoot-
ing (burst) mode, and press the shutter button when the baby starts 
moving. You’ll have a wonderful sequence of images from which to 
choose. You can also combine these images to make a slide show, or use 
your image-editing application to create a document that is a collage of 
the best shots.

If you’re a parent who’s had a recent addition to the family, photography of 
your newborn takes on a whole different meaning. In addition to creating 
portraits for friends and family, you’re also the family historian, capturing 

114
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
images of your child for posterity. Documenting the first few weeks of your 
newborn’s life provides wonderful memories for the rest of your life, and your 
child’s life. When you document your child’s life, think like a photojournalist 
and always have a camera close at hand. Here are a few things to consider 
when creating a photo journal of your child’s earliest days:
 
✓ Capture the special moments. Document your child’s arrival at your 
home, and take other pictures, such as the child’s first bath, your child 
being nursed, and so on.
 
✓ Photograph the happy moments. Infants spend a lot of their time 
crying, soiling their diapers, throwing tantrums, and so on. Make sure 
you’ve got your camera ready to capture the moments when he’s a 
happy camper, such as when your spouse plays with your baby, the 
moment after he’s been fed, when one of the other children in the family 
or the family pet interact with the baby, and so on.
 
✓ Take pictures of the special moments. Your baby will be fairly predict-
able. After you know your baby’s routine, keep the camera handy to 
capture the special moments when she does something cute, funny, 
obnoxious, and anything else you think should be documented.
 
✓ Document the changes. Your baby changes from week to week as he 
starts to learn how to interact with his world. The changes can be fasci-
nating to watch. If you take pictures of your baby’s first days and neglect 
to take pictures for several weeks, you’ll miss an important part of your 
child’s development. You may not see the changes from day to day, but 
when you compare pictures of your child when he’s a few days old to 
pictures of him when he’s six weeks old, you’ll be amazed at the changes 
that have taken place.
 
Never use direct flash when photographing babies. The sudden burst of light 
will scare them. Always use indirect lighting for your baby portraits or 
bounce the flash off a wall or ceiling. For more information on lighting, check 
out Chapter 7.
 
When you shoot portraits of babies, choose a focal length that is the 35mm 
equivalent of 85mm and choose a large aperture (low f-stop number), which 
will create a soft blurry background. Make sure you focus on the child’s eyes.
Photographing young children
Young children are very active. It’s difficult to get one to slow down long 
enough to get a formal portrait. However, you can get wonderful candid shots 
of kids playing with other children, or interacting with pets. In fact, the best 
time to photograph children is when they’re doing something they enjoy. 
Here are some things to consider when photographing children:

115
 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
 
✓ Photograph at eye level. Unless you’re trying for a special effect, you 
should always crouch down and photograph children at eye level.
 
✓ Get some help. If you’re photographing a child you don’t know, ask 
the parents for assistance. In fact, when you ask for assistance, ask the 
child’s mother to be in the frame and you’ll get a wonderful mother and 
child portrait. If the child doesn’t know you, having her picture taken 
with her mother may put her at ease.
 
✓ Shoot in continuous mode. When you’re photographing children at 
play, switch your camera to continuous or burst mode. When something 
interesting starts happening, press the shutter button and hold it down 
to take a series of pictures.
 
✓ Switch to continuous focus mode. When you photograph children 
at play using this mode, the camera locks focus when you press the 
shutter button halfway. As the child moves in the frame, the camera 
changes focus.
 
✓ Shoot with a wide-angle focal length. Normally, you shoot portraits 
with a telephoto lens. However, you can create a compelling environ-
mental portrait of your child in the playground using a wide-angle focal 
length. When you use this technique, don’t fill the frame with your child. 
Include the environment in which the child is playing.
 
✓ Get the child to laugh. Sometimes you’ve got to act like a kid to bring 
out the best in a kid. Laugh or make a funny face. If that doesn’t work, 
get the child’s parent to laugh or make a funny face.
 
✓ Anticipate emotion. Children go at their own paces. Sometimes children 
are bored; other times they get excited really quickly. Be ready to take 
one or more pictures when you see the child’s mood start to change.
 
✓ Include friends in the picture. Take a picture of your subject with his 
best friend, who may be another kid, or his favorite toy.
 
✓ Remember the details. You can get interesting pictures of children by 
photographing details such as the child’s hand as she tries to lace her 
shoe, or the child hugging her teddy bear. You can use a macro lens for 
small details like the child’s tiny fingers fumbling with shoe laces.
 
✓ Use a zoom lens. Some children are camera shy. If you run into an elu-
sive child, step back and then zoom in on the child. Have someone who 
isn’t in the frame interact with the child. The child may not be looking 
at the camera, but you’ll get better pictures than if you try to coax the 
camera-shy child into looking at the camera and smiling.
 
✓ Switch to Shutter Priority mode. If the child is moving quickly, switch 
to Shutter Priority mode and use a shutter speed of 1/125 of a second or 
faster. This freezes the child’s motion. If you’re not comfortable manu-
ally setting the shutter speed, switch to Sports shooting mode. (See 
Figure 6-2.)

116
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
✓ Play Simon Says. If you know the child well, play a game of Simon Says 
with him. When you see a pose you like, say, “Simon says, ‘stop’.” When 
the child stops, press the shutter button.
There are a million ways to create interesting photographs of children. 
Whether your goal is to capture a formal portrait of the child, or an environ-
mental portrait of the child at play, the key is to stay focused and be ready 
for anything once the child is in front of your camera.

child at play.

 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
 
Remember your rules of composition. You almost always get a better picture 
if you follow one of the rules of composition instead of centering your subject 
in the viewfinder.
Creating Portraits of Couples
When you photograph a couple, your goal is to capture the bond between 
the couple, their love and intimacy. When you create a photo of a couple 
who know each other well and are romantically involved, it’s similar to the 
engagement shoot that many wedding photographers do. Here are some tips 
for photographing couples:
 
✓ Make sure they’re close to each other. If the couple has a romantic 
relationship, ask them to hug or ask the man to put his arm around the 
woman.
 
✓ Make sure there is little or no space between their heads. (See Figure 6-3.)
 
✓ Get your couple to start talking and keep your eye on the viewfinder or 
LCD monitor. When they start relaxing and laughing, start taking pictures.
 
✓ Put on some music and ask the couple to start dancing.
 
✓ Ask them to look at each other.
 
✓ Photograph the couple doing something, such as looking at a laptop 
computer or preparing a meal.
 
✓ If you know the couple well, you know what they like to do together. 
Photograph them doing their favorite pastime. Even a game like tennis 
holds possibilities for interesting photos of a couple. You can photo-
graph them walking to the court with their rackets over the shoulders 
while talking.
 
✓ Take a close-up of the couple holding hands.
 
✓ If you’re photographing the couple outdoors in a setting like a park, ask 
them to sit back to back. Use a wide-angle focal length to create an envi-
ronmental portrait of the couple and their surroundings.
 
✓ Photograph the couple holding a glass of wine and toasting each other; 
then zoom in for a close-up of their hands and the wine glasses.
 
✓ Photograph them from behind, in silhouette, holding hands walking 
away from the camera.
These are just a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing. The opportuni-
ties for creating wonderful photos of a couple are limited only by your imagi-
nation. Your goal is to create a photo that tells the viewer something about 
the couple. This is not just a snapshot. Put your own creative spin on one 
or more of the items in the previous list and create beautiful portraits your 
friends will cherish forever.

118
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
After you take a picture, review it to make sure you’ve captured the moment. 
Zoom in and review the image carefully to make sure they’re both smiling, 
and that nobody’s blinking.
Figure 6-3: Your photos tell a story about each couple you photograph.
 
When you begin a photo shoot, get your subjects to relax and laugh. Tell 
them that the area in front of your camera is a no-blink zone.

119
 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
Photographing Groups
Photographing a group presents a different challenge. Even if it’s a family, 
you still have a diverse range of subjects ranging from young tykes to grand-
parents. Add the different heights to the equation and you’ve got an interest-
ing challenge on your hands. Here are some things to consider when you’re 
photographing a group of people:
 
✓ Avoid the police-lineup look, where you’ve got the shortest in the front, 
tallest in the back, and they’re all shoulder to shoulder.
 
✓ If you’re in a natural setting such as a park, get the youngest members 
of the group to sit on the ground, or in the lap of an adult sitting on the 
ground. Another possibility is to have the youngsters lie on their stom-
achs with their hands holding up their heads. You might even consider 
having the tallest member of the group lie horizontally propped up on one 
elbow, with other members of the group standing or kneeling behind him.
 
✓ Ask everyone to move in close and touch faces. Take a picture of the 
group from above. Compose your picture and ask the group to look at 
you and smile.
 
✓ Photograph the group doing something together. But if you photograph 
them enjoying a meal together, make sure you don’t take pictures that 
show a group member with a mouth full of food. If you accidentally take 
one, delete it immediately.
 
✓ If one member of the group is heavier than the others, sandwich him 
between and behind two thin people. Make sure you can see his face 
clearly and he’s not in shadow.
 
✓ Ask the group to lie on the floor like they’re spokes on a wheel. Take the 
picture from overhead and zoom in on their faces.
 
✓ Group shots are more interesting if you have an odd number of people in 
the group.
 
✓ Photograph the group from above and have them look up at you. (See 
Figure 6-4.)
When you photograph a group of people that are two or more rows deep, you 
want everybody to be in focus. The best way to achieve this goal is to shoot 
in Aperture Priority mode and choose an f-stop of f/5.6 or greater. However, 
every rule is meant to be broken. If you want to draw your viewer’s attention 
to one member of a group, choose an f-stop of f/4.0 or lower. For example, in 
a family portrait, you may want to focus the viewer’s attention on the grand-
parents. Place them in front of the rest of the group, choose a large aperture, 
focus on them, and take the picture. After you take the picture, review it on 
your LCD monitor before taking the next shot. If the other family members 
are too out of focus, increase the f-stop to the next highest number and take 
the picture again.

 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
 
Review each photo immediately to make sure everyone is looking at the 
camera and everyone is smiling. Also check to make sure no one is blinking. 
If you’re photographing a group at a once-in-a-lifetime event, such as your 
parent’s 50th wedding anniversary, you won’t get a second chance.
 
If you have a hard time capturing a picture where everybody has their eyes 
open, tell your subjects to close their eyes and open them and smile at the 
count of three. Count to three and press the shutter button.
Choosing Wardrobe
When you’re creating a portrait, the emphasis is on your subject, not the 
clothes she’s wearing. Tell your subject to avoid bringing clothes with 
bright colors or patterns that will detract from her face. She should bring 
a wardrobe with complimentary colors. Black and white colors are always 
good choices because they blend with most backgrounds. You can also try 
burgundy, dark browns, greens, or blues. Blondes look good in navy blue or 
black clothing. Avoid colors like beige or pink, as these colors can alter skin 
tones. Your goal is draw attention to your subject’s face.
When you’re photographing people with dark colored skin, ask them not to 
wear bright colors. Dark blue and black clothes work well when photograph-
ing people with dark skin. Get the lighting right to draw attention to your 
subject’s face.
Long sleeves are generally the best choice unless you’re capturing candid 
shots or photographing people at the beach. V-neck collars accentuate a 
woman’s figure better than round or turtleneck collars.
 
Avoid baggy clothes because they make your subjects look bigger. Ask your 
subjects to wear clothing that fits them well and isn’t too tight or skimpy.
Ask your subject to iron her outfit before the shoot. It’s also a good idea to 
have her change into the outfit you’ll be photographing her in when she gets 
to the shoot location. If you’re taking the pictures in a public place, make 
sure there’s a clean restroom nearby where she can change her clothes. This 
is also useful if you’re photographing her in more than one outfit. 
If you’re photographing a group, make sure group members have similar 
styles so that they look like they belong together. If you’re taking a full-length 
portrait, make sure they have socks and shoes, although children can go 
barefoot. Of course, if you are photographing a group on the beach, everyone 
can be barefoot or wear flip-flops.

122
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Women should keep jewelry to a minimum. A simple necklace, earrings, and 
the rings she usually wears is more than enough. If you notice that any of the 
jewelry draws attention away from your subject’s face, ask her to remove it. 
If she does wear a necklace with a pendant, make sure it’s properly aligned 
before taking the picture.
 
Ask your subjects not to wear trendy clothing, as it dates the photo when the 
clothing goes out of style. Casual, timeless outfits are always the best bet.
 
Keep a lint roller with your portrait photography equipment. You can use this 
to perform spot maintenance on your subject’s clothing.
Using Makeup
Unless you can afford a professional makeup artist, your best bet is to go 
with little or no makeup. Or course, this depends on your subject. If you’re 
photographing a man with oily skin, use a little powder to diminish the sheen 
and even out his skin tone. If you’re photographing a woman, ask her to apply 
some powder and light eye makeup. Ask her to use a bit more lipstick and 
blush than normal so that it shows up better in the resulting portrait.
If your subject is getting her hair styled for the portrait, ask her to do it two 
weeks prior to the session. If you’re photographing a man, ask him to shave 
before the session and trim his sideburns. Men’s facial hair grows quickly. 
It’s not uncommon for a man with dark hair to sprout a five o’ clock shadow 
before noon. If he has a moustache or beard, ask him to trim it before the 
session.
 
Visit your local beauty supply store and purchase a few neutral tones of 
powder and a makeup brush. Take your makeup kit along to a portrait shoot 
for when your subject needs a quick touch-up.
Posing Your Subject
After applying makeup and tidying the wardrobe, you’re ready to begin your 
portrait session. If your subject isn’t a professional model, or isn’t used to 
being in front of the camera, you’re going to have to tell him what to do. The 
first step is gaining rapport, as outlined in Chapter 4. When your subject 
starts to relax, you’re ready to click the shutter. Now it’s your job to show 
him how to pose so that you make him look mahvelous. Here are some things 
to consider to get a compelling portrait of your subject:

123
 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
 
✓ Shoulders: In many cases, your subject’s shoulders should not be level. A 
high shoulder and low shoulder add interest to the image. The alternative 
is to have your subject square his shoulders to the camera. This implies 
strength and works well with portraits of young men, especially if you 
shoot from below, looking up at your subject. If he has a slim waist, you’ll 
see get a nice triangular shape from the pelvis to his shoulders.
 
✓ Head: If your subject tips his head back, you’ll get a casual portrait with 
a “punk” look. This works well for young men. If your subject is standing 
sideways to the camera and gently turns her head toward the camera, 
this gives her an elegant look. If your subject is older and has sagging 
skin on her neck, have her tilt her head up to diminish the appearance of 
the wrinkles and then turn her head toward the camera. If your subject 
is a young woman, have her tilt her head to the high shoulder, which 
gives her a flirtatious look. Have a man tilt his head toward the low 
shoulder to impart a feeling of power. This works well when you shoot 
from a lower position, looking up at your subject.
 
✓ Joints: Have your subject bend her wrist and elbow to create a graceful 
pose. A rigid arm and wrist imply rigidity, something you should avoid at 
all costs. Make sure the bends are graceful and natural looking. 
 
✓ Arms: Have your subject bend his arms slightly to impart a casual, at-
ease feeling. If your subject straightens his arms, this implies rigidity 
and should be avoided at all costs. When you’re composing the portrait 
through your viewfinder, make sure the angle of the arms doesn’t look 
unnatural, and make sure the arms aren’t bent the wrong way. You’re 
creating a portrait, not a poster of a circus contortionist.
 
✓ Hands: A woman’s fingers should be extended so they look long and 
elegant. A man’s fists should be lightly clenched like he’s holding a small 
rock. You can also give your subjects something to hold, something that 
they use in their work or hobby.
 
✓ Hips: If your subject is facing the camera sideways, have her tilt her hips 
forward for a slimming effect.
 
✓ Legs: If your subject is a man, have him face the camera with legs spread 
shoulder-width apart to show a feeling of strength. If your subject faces 
the camera sideways, one leg should support the body weight and the 
other leg should be bent gracefully.
 
✓ Feet: Feet that are shoulder-width apart impart a feeling of strength and 
solidity. You can also have your subject place one foot on an object such 
as a wall or a step to add interest to the composition.

124
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Getting the body parts right is part of the puzzle. Putting it all together to 
get an artistic pose can be a bit more challenging. Here are some poses you 
can try:
 
✓ Pose 1: Have your subject stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Have 
him place his hands on his hips, or hook one thumb in his front pocket. 
Kneel when you take a picture using this pose and your subject will look 
powerful and confident. Smile is optional.
 
✓ Pose 2: Have your subject lean against a wall and rest one foot on the 
wall. Have her put one hand in her pocket, or rest it on her hip.
 
✓ Pose 3: Have your subject sit in a chair or on a step that’s almost at a right 
angle to the camera with one leg slightly bent at the knee. Have her look 
toward the camera but not all the way, with her head slightly tilted up.
 
If your subject has a large nose, have him tilt his chin and make sure his nose 
is pointed straight at the camera.
Using Props
When you add a prop to a portrait, you add another layer to the story, telling 
viewers more about your subject. Props can run the gamut from your sub-
ject’s favorite object or memento to the musical instrument he plays. A prop 
can be subtle or in-your-face. For example, if your subject is a pipe smoker, 
take a picture of him tamping the tobacco with an ornate tamper. If your sub-
ject is a cello player, place your subject behind the cello with the neck over 
one shoulder and the bow in his hand.
Where is your subject looking?
When you take someone’s picture, the area into 
which he’s looking tells a story, even more so 
when you photograph two people. For example, 
if you’re photographing a couple looking at each 
other, that implies a relationship. If they’re look-
ing away from each other, that implies a differ-
ence of opinion or disharmony. If your subject 
is holding something and looking at the camera, 
this implies an invitation, and your subject is the 
center of attention. If your subject is holding 
something, and looking at the object, the object 
then becomes the center of attention. If your 
subject is looking out of the frame, this implies 
a sense of mystery: What is he looking at? If the 
subject is looking toward the camera, she is 
definitely your center of interest. If the subject 
is looking at the camera with an intense look on 
his face, it’s a very strong pose which implies 
tension.

125
 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
If you’re creating an environmental portrait, you’ll have natural props all over 
the place. You’ll have to weed out the props that don’t really belong in the 
picture and limit yourself to a few that help tell your story. For example, if 
you’re creating an environment portrait of a woodworker in his study, a pho-
tograph of him holding a chisel over his latest work in progress while intently 
deciding where to use it will create a compelling photo to which everyone 
can relate.
Other props to consider are tools used by the person you’re photographing. 
If you’re photographing a business person, take a picture of her with her 
laptop while talking on her cell phone, as I did in Figure 6-5. If you’re photo-
graphing a firefighter, take a picture of him holding an axe.
Props are also great when you’re creating portraits of children. The prop 
keeps the child occupied while you take pictures. The prop should be some-
thing the child loves, something with which viewers of the photograph can 
identify.
Photographing People with Pets
People who have pets think of them as members of the family. So it’s no 
wonder that every pet wants a portrait of himself with his human. When 
you photograph a pet and his owner, you want to show viewers the bond 
between the pet and its owner. This is easy to do when you’re photographing 
a dog and his owner, as shown in Figure 6-6, but cats can be more elusive. No 
matter what type of pet you’re photographing, you’re going to have to rely on 
the owner for assistance.
If the pet is small, take a picture of the owner holding her pet. If the pet is 
large, ask the owner to have the pet come to her side. Dogs will generally give 
you something that looks like a smile. Use your rapport techniques to loosen 
up the owner and get her to smile, too. Take as many pictures as you can 
when the pet isn’t fidgeting. It’s also a good idea to switch your camera to 
continuous shooting (burst) mode to take several pictures quickly. Press the 
shutter button when the owner starts interacting with her pet. You may get a 
picture of the dog plastering a big wet kiss on his human.
Photographing Pets
Photographing pets without their owners is definitely a challenge, especially 
if they don’t know you. Here’s another case where you’ll have to rely on the 
pet’s owner for assistance. That is, of course, unless you’re photographing a 
cat. When you photograph a cat, you’re definitely on your own.

Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Creating formal pet portraits
You can create some wonderful portraits of your pet with your digital 
camera. Many of the same composition rules apply when you create a formal 
portrait of your pet. Your goal is to create an interesting composition that 
tells a story about your family friend. Formal portraits work best if your 
pet is trained. You can tell your pet to sit, shake hands, and whatever other 
stupid pet tricks you’ve taught him. It also helps if your pet is used to seeing 
you with a camera pointed at him. You may have to try several attempts 
before getting the photos you want. If you’re photographing someone else’s 
pet, have the owner stand beside you so she can tell the pet what to do. If 
you have the pet’s favorite treat handy, you’ll have a captive audience. That 
is, unless you’re trying to photograph a cat. They live in their own world and 
definitely have their own agenda. Trying to get a cat to do anything on com-
mand may prove fruitless. If your subject is a cat, fast forward to the section 
on candid pet portraits. When creating a formal portrait of your pet, consider 
the following:
 
✓ Consider the background. If you’re photographing a pet with dark 
hair against a dark background, your pet may be hard to distinguish. 
Choose a background that isn’t busy and contrasts well with your 
pet’s colors. If you’re shooting indoors, you can use a bed sheet as an 
impromptu background.
 
✓ Don’t use on-camera flash. When the flash fires, it may frighten your 
pet. You’ll also get the pet equivalent of red-eye, which looks more look 
glowing demon eyes. Your best bet for illuminating a pet is to use soft, 
indirect window light. If you do need to use flash, bounce it off a ceiling 
or wall. 
 
✓ Shoot from the animal’s level. Your pet’s eyes should be at camera level.
 
✓ Zoom in. Back away from your pet and zoom in. Choose a focal length 
that’s the 35mm equivalent of 85mm or higher. You can include your 
entire pet in the image, or zoom in tight for a whimsical face shot of your 
smiling pooch.
 
✓ Shoot close-ups first. If you’re taking a picture of your pet in his environ-
ment, take the close-up shots first and then back up to capture more of 
the surrounding environment. If you shoot the environment portraits 
first, the pet may lose interest and wander off. Get the good stuff first 
while you’ve got Fido’s undivided attention. If necessary, a couple of 
treats will keep your subject interested.
 
✓ Switch to Aperture Priority mode. Whether you’re photographing your 
pet indoors or outdoors, you don’t want the background to be sharp and 
draw the viewer’s attention away from your pet. Choose a small f-stop 
number to limit the depth of field.

129
 Chapter 6: Working with Your Subjects
 
✓ Focus on the eyes. When you choose a large aperture (small f-stop 
number) combined with a telephoto lens, your depth of field is extremely 
limited, and part of your pet may not be in sharp focus, especially if your 
pet is large. Therefore, it’s important that the eyes be in sharp focus. 
After all, the eyes are the windows to the soul, even with a pet.
Creating candid pet photos
Dogs are very active critters. Cats can be active when it suits them. If your 
pet isn’t trained, candid photos are your best bet. You can get some great pic-
tures of your pet playing with her favorite toy. If you’ve got a really athletic 
dog who loves to fetch a Frisbee, you’ve got everything you need for a great 
series of candid photos. Here are a couple of suggestions for capturing great 
candid photos of your pet:
 
✓ Be ready. Have a camera nearby at all times. You never know when your 
pet will do something funny or interesting. I own a cat named Niki, who 
is also known as “Queen of the Universe.” She stares out the window 
with Zen-like focus waiting for squirrels to run by. I’ve taken some great 
photos of her, just by being ready.
 
✓ Choose the right shooting mode. If you’re photographing a pet looking 
out the window, switch to Aperture Priority mode and choose a large 
aperture (small f-stop number) to blur the background and draw atten-
tion to your pet. If you’re photographing an active pet, switch to Shutter 
Priority mode and choose a shutter speed fast enough to stop the action. 
 
 To accentuate the motion of your pet, switch to a slow shutter speed of 
about 1/30 of a second. Have someone toss a ball so that it travels 
across the frame from left to right. Zoom in on your pet and pan the 
camera to keep your pet in the frame. Press the shutter button and con-
tinue to pan. You’ll get a wonderful picture with your pet’s head in sharp 
focus, but the legs will be a blur. When you pan the camera, make sure 
your hands are cradling the lens and your feet are spread shoulder-
width apart to create a stable platform.
 
✓ Switch to continuous shooting (burst) mode: This mode enables you to 
take a sequence of pictures as long as the shutter button is depressed. 
This is a wonderful way to capture a series of images of your pet doing 
something like jumping up to catch a Frisbee in mid-air.
Photographing your pet can be a lot of fun. After you’ve had a pet for a while, 
you know her routine, and you can be ready when she does something cute 
or interesting. My cat sits by her food bowl and begs for a handout whenever 
she sees me pick up the camera bag or change my clothes, and sometimes 
she just finds a ray of sunshine and contemplates whatever cats contemplate 
when they stare out a window. I take opportunities like these to capture some 
new photos of my buddy. (See Figure 6-7.)

130
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 6-7: Cats are great subjects for candid photos.
If you have children, you can create some great images of the family pet play-
ing and interacting with the kids. When you see your pet getting playful with 
your children, pick up your camera and get ready to shoot. This is another 
time when it makes sense to switch to continuous shooting (burst) mode.

Lighting Your Portraits
In This Chapter
▶ Using flash
▶ Working with various light sources
▶ Creating portraits in the dark
▶ Using natural light
W
hen you create a portrait, lighting is everything. With the right light, 
you reveal all of the character and warmth of your subject. Lighting 
isn’t rocket science, but you do have to take advantage of what nature has 
dealt you and modify or augment the light source with flash or other devices. 
In this chapter, I show you how to work with camera flash and natural light 
sources, and how to modify both.
Understanding Light Sources
The source and size of the light you use for your por-
traits is very important. When you deal with a small 
light source, you have very harsh shadows. Picture 
the sun at noon. It’s a relatively small light source 
because it’s so far away from the planet. The small 
size of the sun relative to the earth creates very 
harsh shadows when it illuminates something. 
Now picture a cloudy day. The sun is still there, but 
it’s hidden by the clouds. The sun hits the clouds, 
and it’s diffused to create a very pleasing light source 
that is large with hardly any shadows. If you do have 
shadows, they’re very soft with a diffuse edge. Compare 
this with the hard knife-edge shadow you get with a small light 
source. Therefore, it’s important to use the largest light source pos-
sible when your goal is to create a flattering portrait. In upcoming sections, I 
share some techniques for using the most flattering light source possible.

132
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Using Camera Flash
A camera’s built-in flash units — you know, those deals that pop up and send 
a flash of light when you press the shutter button — are the harshest artifi-
cial light source available. They’re small and aimed directly at your subject. 
The small light source creates a very harsh shadow. The light also bounces 
off your subject’s retina and creates a condition known as red-eye, which 
causes your subject’s pupils to look blood red. On-camera flash is never a 
good choice for portrait photography.
Using auxiliary flash
If your camera is equipped with a hot shoe, you can mount an auxiliary flash 
in the hot shoe and use it to create a more flattering light than you’d get with 
the on-camera flash. If you have a flash that is dedicated to your camera, you 
can take advantage of TTL (Through The Lens) metering, where the camera 
metering system determines how much illumination is needed from the flash 
to properly illuminate your subject. Figure 7-1 shows an auxiliary flash unit 
mounted on the Canon PowerShot G10. The on-camera flash for the G10 isn’t 
very powerful, and it’s totally unsuitable for portrait work.
Figure 7-1: Mounting an auxiliary flash unit in the camera hot shoe.
Some camera manufacturers feature auxiliary flash units that enable you to 
modify the amount of light coming out of the flash. This allows you to increase 
or decrease the power of the flash unit. This comes in handy when you need to 
add a kiss of light to a portrait or just fill in a few shadows. Some cameras let 
you communicate directly with the flash via a menu option to adjust the flash 
power. Other units have options for adjusting flash power from the unit itself.

133
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
 
Many flash units feature flash compensation, which enables you to increase 
or decrease the amount of light coming from the flash unit. When you review 
a picture on your LCD monitor and decide you need more or less light on 
your subject, you use flash compensation to achieve this result. Refer to your 
flash manual for more details.
Bouncing flash
If you have a dedicated flash with a swivel head, you can turn the head 
toward a wall or ceiling and bounce the light toward your subject. The benefit 
of bounce flash is that you end up with a much larger light source, which pro-
duces soft light without harsh shadows. The disadvantage is that you need 
a longer exposure because the flash loses quite a bit of its punch because it 
travels a greater distance, and is diffused. When using bounce flash, increase 
your ISO to the largest value that will still give you an acceptable image with-
out too much noise. If you don’t know the highest ISO you can use without 
creating unacceptable digital noise, refer to Chapter 3.
When you use bounce flash, you must remember one of the laws of physics, 
which states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. In 
other words, if your flash hits the ceiling at a 45-degree angle, it bounces off 
the ceiling at a 45-degree angle. Most flash units with swivel heads have a 
detent that clicks in to hold the flash at a 45-degree angle from the head. You 
need to be far enough away from your subject so that the full illumination 
from the bounced flash reaches her. If you’re too close, the flash will bounce 
over her head, too far away, and the light will fall short.
When you use bounce flash properly (see Figure 7-2), it produces a flatter-
ing light. Figure 7-3 shows a Canon flash with a swivel head as you would 
position it when bouncing the flash off a ceiling. The head rotates on two 
axes. You can bounce it up toward the ceiling, and sideways to bounce 
some of the flash off a nearby wall or reflector. The swivel gives you endless 
possibilities.
Figure 7-2: Bouncing flash off a ceiling.

134
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 7-3: A flash with a swivel head can be used to bounce the flash.
Creating a bounce card
Bounce flash is great when you have a white ceiling or wall nearby. But what 
happens when you’re creating candid portraits at a party or an event that’s 
being held in a large room without white walls and with a ceiling that might 
as well be in the stratosphere? You use a bounce card. A bounce card spreads 
the flash out, giving you a larger light source, which produces a flattering 
light. You can create a bounce card for your camera using supplies from a 
craft store. Here’s how:
 
1. Purchase a sheet of white foam and some Velcro.
 
 Michaels (an arts and crafts store with retail stores in the U.S. and 
Canada) sells foam sheets called Creative Hands Cool Foam. Each sheet is 
approximately 12 x 18 inches, thin, and white, and is the perfect product 
for creating a bounce card. You can purchase Velcro at Michaels or at your 
local office supply store. Velcro that is ¾ of an inch wide is perfect.
 
2. Download the bounce card template from www.dasdesigns.net/
downloads/bouncetemp.zip.
 
 Download this to a convenient spot on your hard drive. In most cases, 
I download files like these to my desktop, which unfortunately can lead 
to a bit of clutter. Hmm… maybe we need a Computer Desktop Feng-Shui 
For Dummies book. But I digress . . .The template is a Zip file. When you 
unzip the file, you’ll have a PDF document. 

135
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
 
3. Unzip the file and open the PDF file.
 
 Most versions of Windows will open a dialog box with options for 
extracting the zipped file. To open the PDF file, you’ll need to have 
Adobe Reader installed. If you don’t have Adobe Reader, you can down-
load it for free at http://get.adobe.com/reader.
 
4. Print the PDF file and then cut out the template.
 
5. Trace the template onto the foam and then cut it out.
 
6. Attach one side of the Velcro to the flash, as shown in Figure 7-4.
 
7. Attach the Velcro to the bounce card, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
8. Attach the card to your flash unit, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-4: Attaching Velcro to the flash.
Figure 7-5: Attaching Velcro to the bounce card.

136
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 7-6: Attaching the bounce card to your flash unit.
 
 Notice that the flash is pointing with the narrow side facing the subject 
and up toward the ceiling. This is so you can quickly swivel the unit when 
you want to rotate the camera 90 degrees and shoot in portrait format.
 
9. When you shoot vertically (portrait format), rotate the flash unit as 
shown in Figure 7-7.
In either configuration, the flash is bounced up to the ceiling, and toward 
your subject. This bathes your subject in diffuse light instead of the harsh 
light normally associated with a small flash unit.
Modifying pop-up flash
If your camera doesn’t have a hot shoe but does have a pop-up flash, you can 
still produce flattering lights for your portraits. Most camera stores carry a 
device that you can attach to your camera that creates a small tent over the 

137
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
flash to diffuse the light before it reaches your subject. LumiQuest (www.
lumiquest.com) makes a device known as the Soft Screen (see Figure 7-8), 
which currently retails for $13.95.
Figure 7-7: Swivel the unit and bounce card to shoot vertically.
Modifying the light from an auxiliary flash
If you’re a geek like me, you like gadgets — I’ve got a camera bag full of them. 
If you’ve got an auxiliary flash and you want to modify the light coming from it, 
you can take the DIY approach and create a bounce card. But if you want some-
thing that looks more professional and is scientifically designed to modify the 
light, you can find a device at your local camera store to fit the bill. LumiQuest 
makes several devices for modifying the light from an auxiliary flash unit. 
These units mount directly on your flash unit. The Softbox is shown on the left 
of Figure 7-9, and the UltraSoft is shown on the right.

Using Fill Flash
When the light source is coming from behind your subject, your camera 
should meter the scene, and the resulting image will be a compromise. The 
background will be exposed almost perfectly, but your subject will be in dark 
shadow, or perhaps a silhouette. You have two choices with a backlit subject: 
Use exposure compensation to increase the brightness of your subject or 
use fill flash to fill in the shadows. The problem with the first solution is that 

139
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
the background will be overexposed. When you enable fill flash, your camera 
meters the overall scene and then figures how much flash is needed to fill 
in the shadows. When you use fill flash, shoot in one of the advanced shoot-
ing modes. When you’re shooting a portrait, Aperture Priority mode is ideal. 
Enable your on-camera flash or auxiliary flash. Even though you’re using 
ambient light for the background, it’s still a good idea to put a light modifier 
on your flash, which fills the shadows with soft, diffuse light. The portrait on 
the left in Figure 7-10 was taken outdoors using ambient light only. Compare 
that with the portrait on the right side of Figure 7-10, which was shot using fill 
flash. Notice that the colors are much more vibrant. The flash caused catch 
lights to appear in each eye, drawing the viewer’s attention to her eyes. I 
used a light modifier on the flash similar to the ones shown in Figure 7-9.
You can use fill flash indoors and outdoors. Actually, it’s a good idea to use 
fill flash whenever you create portraits outdoors. The extra light fills in 
shadow areas of the face, such as the area under your subject’s brow. It’s 
also great if your subject is wearing a hat or cap that creates a harsh shadow 
as the flash will fill in the shadow area under the brim of the cap and reveal 
detail that would otherwise be lost. Fill flash also adds a bit of sparkle to the 
eyes in the form of catch lights.

Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Creating Portraits with Window Light
If you’ve got a window with a window treatment that filters the light, you 
have the ideal light source for a compelling portrait. When window light is 
filtered through curtains made of a white fabric that lets light through, you 
end up with a wonderful diffuse light 
that is very flattering.
The time of day also makes a differ-
ence when you’re creating a portrait 
using window light. If you create the 
photograph when the sun is rising and 
filtering in through the window, you 
get a soft, warm light. The same is true 
when the sun is setting. If you create 
the photograph during the afternoon, 
the light will still be flattering, but you 
won’t get the warm light of the rising 
or setting sun.
When you create a window-light por-
trait, your subject can look toward the 
window or look toward the camera. A 
profile shot of your subject facing the 
window and looking toward the light 
source can be an interesting charac-
ter study. You can also create a nice 
portrait by positioning your subject 
perpendicular to the light source. One 
side of her face will be in shadow and 
the other will be illuminated by the 
light coming in through the window. 
When you create a window-light por-
trait, turn off any other lights in the 
room. If part your subject’s face is 
in deep shadow, use a reflector to 
bounce some light into the shadow 
side of her face. Figure 7-11 was pho-
tographed with window light. To fill 
in the shadow side of her face, I used 
a reflector with a grip manufactured 
by Lastolite, shown in Figure 7-12. The 
catch lights show the window on the 
right side of each eye, and the reflec-
tor on the left side of each eye. For 
more information on reflectors, refer 
to the section, “Using a reflector,” later 
in this chapter.

light back into shadow areas.

 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
Modifying Light
The great thing about light is it’s not a WYSIWYG object. You can modify the 
available light with devices you can purchase from a camera store. You can 
modify light by diffusing the ambient light, or by bouncing light back into 
the shadows. In the following sections, I show you how to use photography 
equipment that’s designed to modify light.
Using a reflector
You use a reflector when you need to bounce light back into the shadows. 
Basic reflectors have two sides. One commonly used reflector has a highly 
reflective gold colored fabric on one side and a highly reflective silver fabric 
on the other side. Use the silver side of the reflector when you want to add 
light to an image without changing the color temperature but also add con-
trast to the image. The silver reflector is a favorite for black-and-white pho-
tography. Use the gold side of the reflector when you want to bounce warm 
light onto your subject. The left side of Figure 7-13 shows a portrait illumi-
nated by window light with no reflector. The right side of the figure shows 
the same portrait using the gold side of a reflector to bounce light onto the 
shadow side of the young girl’s face.
Figure 7-13: Bouncing warm light into shadow areas.

142
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Some reflectors are multipurpose. They have silver, gold, white, or black 
discs and a translucent disc. The translucent disc is actually a diffuser, which 
I discuss in the next section. The black reflector is also known as a gobo. 
The black reflector decreases the amount of light reaching the subject and is 
also used for removing unwanted reflections and color casts. The white side 
of the reflector bounces neutral light back onto your subject.
Reflectors come in a wide variety of sizes. Small reflectors up to 22 inches 
in diameter are ideal for head-and-shoulders portraits. Reflectors 40 inches 
and larger are ideal for a portrait where you’re photographing the person 
from head to toe. Larger reflectors are also handy when you’re photograph-
ing a group. When you need to use a reflector, ask a friend to hold it, and 
tell her where to move it. You’ll notice the changes in your viewfinder or 
LCD monitor.
Circular reflectors require the use of an assistant. There are, however, reflec-
tors on the market that can be held by the photographer. A company called 
LastoLite makes a triangular reflector with a grip on one end. If you place 
your camera on a tripod, you can easily move the reflector to bounce the 
light where it is needed. Figure 7-14 shows an assistant handholding a reflec-
tor and a diffuser over a bride. Notice that the top part of her body is shaded 
by the diffuser, and the right side of her face is brighter than the left, thanks 
to the reflector.
Image courtesy of Bogen Imaging
Figure 7-14: Using a reflector with a built-in grip.

143
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
You can also purchase an inexpensive light stand and use it to hold the reflec-
tor. If you’re shooting in windy conditions, you’ll have to secure the light 
stand with a sand bag or some other weight. You can also purchase a bag to 
counterweight the light stand. It looks like a hot water bottle. Fill the bag with 
water and attach it to the light stand. 
Using a diffuser
A diffuser reduces the amount of light reaching the scene. A diffuser is the 
ideal solution when you have no choice but to photograph someone under 
harsh light. A diffuser acts just like a layer of clouds occluding the sun. It 
spreads the light out and minimizes harsh shadows. You can purchase a dif-
fuser from your favorite camera store, or use a multipurpose reflector that 
has a translucent disc. Have a friend hold the diffuser over your subject. 
Figure 7-15 was photographed under a harsh glaring sun. Earlier, I had pho-
tographed the young lady in a shaded area, but I wanted one photo of her in 
the bikini with the lake as a background. I showed her mother (her chaperone 
and my assistant) how to hold the diffuser, and I took several pictures. Note 
that using a reflector or diffuser can be a challenge if it’s a windy day.
Using Auxiliary Flash Off the Camera
When you illuminate your subject with on-camera flash, the light source hits 
your subject square in his face. You can modify the light for a more flattering 
portrait, but you still end up with hardly any shadows on his face. Shadows 
model the face and give it some dimension. You can achieve this by taking 
the flash out of the hot shoe and moving it to one side or another. Mount 
the flash on a tripod or light stand and angle the flash so that it strikes your 
subject directly. The light striking your subject from an angle will add some 
nice shadows on the other side of her face. You should also add some type of 
modifier to diffuse the flash as discussed in the “Modifying Light” section.
Of course, you’ll have to have some way to connect the flash to the camera. If 
your flash and camera have PC sockets, you can use a PC cord to connect the 
flash to the camera. Another option is to purchase a cord that mounts in the 
hot shoe of your camera and has a hot shoe on the other end, into which you 
mount the flash. (See Figure 7-16.)
There are several ways you can trigger an off-camera flash without using 
cables. Many Nikon digital SLRs feature a Commander system, which is built 
into the camera and can be used to trigger Nikon flash units. The off-camera 
flash units are slaves controlled by the Commander. Canon has a wireless 

144
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
transmitter that plugs into the camera hot shoe. (See Figure 7-17.) The ST-E2 
transmitter acts as the master flash and sends out an infrared pulse to trigger 
the slave units. The ST-E2 can trigger an unlimited number of 420EX, 430EX, 
550EX, and 580EX flash units in two separate groups.

Creating Portraits at Night
When you use flash at night, your subject is properly exposed, but the back-
ground is underexposed. You can solve this problem if your digital SLR or 
point-and-shoot camera has what is known as Night Portrait mode. When you 
enable this mode, the camera strikes a balance between a perfectly exposed 
background and a perfectly exposed subject. The camera uses a slow shutter 

146
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
speed with this mode to properly expose the background, and the camera flash 
fires to create a perfect exposure of your subject. Because of the slow shutter 
speed, you’ll have to mount your camera on a tripod and tell your subject to 
remain perfectly still. although some photographers do shoot portraits using 
Night Portrait mode with no tripod, which results in a blurry background 
because of camera movement. The latter can be aesthetically pleasing with the 
right background. If you shoot in Night Portrait mode with no tripod, there will 
also be a ghost image around your subject due to the camera movement.
If your camera doesn’t have a Night Portrait mode, the only solution is to use 
one of the advanced shooting modes and let the camera meter the scene. For a 
portrait, the ideal mode is Aperture Priority. If you choose a large aperture (low 
f-stop number), the background will be soft. If you choose a small aperture 
(high f-stop number), the background will be in focus, but the shutter speed 
will be very slow. In either instance, use fill flash to illuminate your subject, and 
mount the camera on a tripod to compensate for the slow shutter speed.
Shooting in Sunlight
If you create portraits outdoors, you’re going to have to deal with sunlight 
at some point in time. The quality of light from the sun differs depending on 
the time of day. In early morning and late afternoon, the sun is low on the 
horizon and the light travels slightly longer and through considerably more 
atmosphere. The resulting light is soft and diffuse, which results in a more 
pleasing portrait. Photographers refer to the hour after sunrise and the hour 
before sunset as the golden hour or magic hour. The light has an orange or 
reddish hue, which is well suited to portrait photography. 
As with any lighting situation, there are challenges, to which I present solu-
tions in the upcoming sections.
Photographing backlit subjects
When the sun is behind your subject, your subject is backlit. Digital cameras 
have a hard time dealing with backlit subjects. The camera meters the entire 
scene and creates an image that is a compromise: Your subject is either a sil-
houette or very dark and the background is perfectly exposed. You can deal 
with a backlit subject in one of two ways:
 
✓ Use exposure compensation to increase the exposure. You can increase 
the exposure until your subject is perfectly exposed. The solution is 
acceptable if you’re doing a head-and-shoulders portrait, or an extreme 
close-up. However, if you’ve got a lot of the background in your image — 
or worse yet, the sun — these parts of the image will be overexposed.
 
 or

147
 Chapter 7: Lighting Your Portraits
 
✓ Use fill flash. When you use fill flash, the camera meters the entire 
scene and adds enough flash to fill the shadows. With fill flash, you get 
the best of both worlds: a properly exposed background and a properly 
exposed subject. If your subject is still darker than you’d like, you can 
use flash compensation to add more light to the shadows.
Photographing subjects facing the sun
When you photograph people with the sun in their eyes, you face a couple 
of problems. First is the time of day. If you photograph just after high noon, 
the sun will still be rather strong and cast strong shadows on your subject. If 
you must photograph someone facing the sun, your best bet is to wait until 
late afternoon when the sun is closer to the horizon, casting a warmer light. 
Another option is to photograph in the early morning, just after sunrise. The 
second problem you face is that your subjects squint when they look directly 
into the sun. The way to overcome this is to ask them to close their eyes, 
open them, and smile at the count of three.

Portraits on Location

▶ Creating informal portraits
▶ Snapping candid shots
▶ Capturing portraits of wildlife
C
reating portraits on location can be a lot of fun. You can incorporate 
interesting elements from the location in your images. The 
possibilities for creating portraits on location are limited only 
by your imagination. You can find interesting locations in 
your hometown, while on vacation, or anywhere else 
you happen to travel. The trick is to be observant and 
not overlook possible locations for portrait photo 
shoots. In this chapter, I share some information 
about shooting portraits on location.
Shooting Portraits on the Beach
If you live or vacation near a beach, you’ve got the 
ingredients for creating wonderful portraits on loca-
tion. Miles of bleached white sand, lush vegetation, 
and sun-dappled water provide wonderful backdrops for 
casual on-location portraits. Whether you’re photographing 
children at play or an entire family, the beach is a wonderful place 
to create a keepsake photo your subject will cherish forever. (See Figure 8-1.)

150
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 8-1: A pristine beach provides a wonderful backdrop for a portrait.
Here are some things to consider when creating portraits on the beach:
 
✓ Location: When you opt for a portrait shoot at the beach, scout the 
location before your subject arrives. Look for an interesting background 
and notice the orientation of the sun as compared to the shoreline. With 
this information, you’ll know exactly where to position your subjects, 
and whether you’ll have to augment the ambient lighting with fill flash. 
Without the addition of fill flash, the subjects in Figure 8-1 would have 
been silhouetted. The flash was modified using a device similar to those 
shown in Chapter 7. I used a transmitter in the camera hot shoe to trigger 
a flash unit that was held by an assistant and angled toward the couple. 

151
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
 
✓ Backgrounds: Choose an area that has a simple background that won’t 
draw attention away from your subjects. Sand dunes with beach vegeta-
tion make a wonderful backdrop. Unless your subjects are wearing col-
orful clothes, avoid a background that is just sand and surf. A splash of 
color from the setting sun or green foliage will add interest to the photo. 
Shy away from buildings with lots of details. Also make sure there are no 
distracting elements in the background, such as utility poles or power 
lines. However, simple elements such as the steps of a lifeguard station 
can add a lot of interest to a portrait and immediately tell a story to the 
viewer.
 
✓ Time of day: You’ll get your best portraits if you shoot during the golden 
hour, which is an hour after sunrise and an hour before sunset. This 
gives you wonderfully warm light which creates warm skin tones.
 
✓ The weather: If you’re creating a beach portrait at sunrise or sunset, 
you’re at the mercy of the weather. If you try to shoot the portrait on a 
day when there’s not a cloud in the sky, the resulting image will be dull 
and lifeless. If your subject is available on a moment’s notice, call her up 
when you notice an interesting sky that will enhance the image. If you’re 
forced to photograph on a cloudless day, or an overcast day, make sure 
you’ve got some color in the background to add life to the image.
 
✓ Look for natural frames: You can use foliage or other natural elements 
to frame your subject. Other possibilities are stairways, palm trees, a 
window in an abandoned beach house, and so on.
 
✓ Tell a story: Not all of your beach portraits need to be posed. When 
you’re photographing a subject on the beach, or by the ocean, you can 
create a wonderful candid photograph of your subject doing something. 
For example, you could photograph a child building a sand castle or 
playing in the surf as the sun sets. (See Figure 8-2.)
 
✓ Lighting: If your subject is backlit, you’ll have to use a reflector or fill 
flash to illuminate the shadows, as I did in Figure 8-1. Or you can use 
existing lighting to create a silhouette, as I did in Figure 8-2.
 
 If your subject is facing the sun, he’ll probably be squinting. Tell your 
subject to close his eyes and open them on the count of three. Take the 
picture immediately after he opens his eyes.
 
✓ Camera settings: When you shoot a portrait on the beach, your first 
choice should always be Aperture Priority mode. Use the largest aper-
ture (low f-stop number) to create a soft, out-of-focus background. If 
you’re not comfortable shooting in Aperture Priority mode, switch to 
Portrait mode. Switch to a single auto-focus point and make sure your 
subject’s eyes are in focus. Don’t use a wide-angle focal length unless 
you’re photographing a large group of people at the beach. Using a focal 
length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm or greater will yield a pleas-
ing portrait. Combined with a large aperture (low f-stop number), this 
focal length gives you a background that is recognizable but doesn’t 
draw the viewer’s attention from your subjects.

152
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 8-2: Create a portrait of your subject playing on the beach.
 
Don’t zoom in too close. You’re shooting a beach portrait, so be sure you 
include enough of the background that viewers will know the picture was 
taken at a beach.
 
When you photograph people on the beach, sand is everywhere. Be careful 
not to get any sand on your hands, which, according to one of Murphy’s 
Laws, will inexorably get into your camera. A single grain of sand can wreak 
havoc with the motor used to zoom your lens to different magnification 
levels. Salty air is also a factor. If you notice a salty tang to the air, when you 
get home, be sure to wipe your camera down with a damp cloth that has 
almost been wrung dry.
 
When you’re photographing subjects on white sand, the camera may end up 
giving you a less-than-desirable exposure. For example, the sand may be too 
bright, and your subjects may be too dark. Review the image on the LCD 
monitor after taking the picture. If areas of the image are overexposed, use 
exposure compensation to correct the exposure as outlined in Chapter 3. 
Depending on the scene, you may have to decrease exposure to properly 
expose the sand, and use fill flash to properly expose your subject.

Photographing Subjects in Your Hometown
Observant photographers know all the photogenic spots in the town in 
which they live. If you don’t know the photogenic spots in your hometown, 
or you’ve recently moved, network with other photographers to find the pho-
tography hot spots where you live. You may live in a town that’s chock full of 
historically significant buildings, or perhaps you live in an area with lots of 
recently constructed buildings. Either way, with a bit of work, you can mine 
interesting places to photograph your subjects from the field of gold that is 
the town in which you live. The following list presents a few ideas to consider 
when creating portraits in your hometown.
 
✓ Consider what your subject likes to do. Before choosing a location, 
find out what hobbies or interests your subject has. For example, if your 
subject likes track and field, photograph him at a local high school track. 
Position your subject behind a runner’s starting gate. Include part of the 
bleachers to add another visual clue to your image. You may want to 
photograph him in his running clothes.
 
✓ Choose the right location. If you’re not choosing a location based on 
your subject’s interest, choose a location that viewers will identify with 
the town in which you and your subject live. For example, you might 
consider taking a picture of your subject on the steps of the county 
courthouse. Another possibility is to include a readily identifiable statue 
in the background. Botanical gardens are also great locations for portrait 
photo shoots.
 
✓ Shoot in historical places. Another great location is a place in your town 
that’s on the historical register. This adds a local element to the picture 
that viewer’s from your hometown are bound to recognize. Figure 8-3 
depicts a portrait shot at Tampa University, which was formerly The 
Tampa Hotel, built in the late 1800s.
 
✓ Incorporate architectural elements. When choosing a location for a loca-
tion shoot, look for interesting architectural elements that you can use to 
draw viewers into the picture or frame your subject. Windows, doorways, 
stairways, and arches are interesting elements to include in a picture.
 
✓ Highlight local flora and fauna. Do you have a type of tree or flower that 
is associated with the town in which you live? If so, include it in your por-
trait. For example, if you live in Washington, DC, schedule a photo shoot 
with your favorite subject when the cherry blossoms bloom.
 
✓ Find a neutral background. When you arrive at your desired location, 
look for a background that viewers can identify as being in your town, 
but avoid busy backgrounds with patterns that clash with your subject’s 
clothing. If you have no option other than to photograph your subject 
against a busy background, make sure she’s far enough away from the 
background so that a large aperture will soften the background. Review 
the image on the LCD monitor. If the background clashes, ask your sub-
ject to move away from it and make sure you move an equal distance 
from the background, as well.

154
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 8-3: Shooting portraits at a historical place.
 
✓ Work with weather and lighting conditions. Don’t shoot the portrait 
in bright sunlight. Either photograph your subject in a shaded area, or 
photograph during the golden hour, which is one hour after sunrise or 
one hour before sunset. If the sky is in your images, try to plan your 
photo shoot during a time of day when there will be clouds in the sky. 
This adds another element of interest to the picture. When you shoot in 
open shade or on an overcast day, consider using fill flash to add some 
sparkle to your subject’s eyes and fill in the shadows. 
 
 If you have no choice other than to photograph your subject in direct, 
harsh light, use a diffuser, as outlined in Chapter 7, to soften light and 

155
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
shadows. If your subject’s back is to the sun, you’ll have to use fill flash 
to illuminate your subject.
 
✓ As always, use the optimal camera settings for your portrait. When you 
shoot a portrait in town, or for that matter, anywhere, choose Aperture 
Priority mode and use the largest aperture (lowest f-stop number) to 
create a pleasing out-of-focus background. If you’re not comfortable 
shooting in Aperture Priority mode, switch to Portrait mode. Switch to 
a single auto-focus point and focus on your subject’s eyes. Don’t use 
a wide-angle focal length unless you’re photographing a large group 
of people. In addition to not being a pleasing choice for a portrait of 
a single person, a wide angle focal length gives you a greater depth 
of field. Using a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm or 
greater will yield a pleasing portrait which, when combined with a large 
aperture, yields you a background that is recognizable, but does not 
draw the viewer’s attention from your subject.
 
✓ Have a backup plan. You never know what may happen when you got to 
a location. It might rain, the place might be crawling with tourists, or 
your ideal shooting location is being remodeled. If you encounter these, 
or any other problems that would prevent the shoot from happening, go 
to your backup location.
Capturing Informal Portraits
An informal portrait is any portrait that’s not created using studio lighting. 
You can create informal portraits of friends and relatives in the town they 
live in doing the things they love to do. When you create an informal portrait, 
you’re telling a story about your subject.
When you create an informal portrait, you’re photographing like a photojour-
nalist. You’re with the subject when she’s either at work or at play. You’re 
the fly on the wall, ready to press the shutter button to capture the quintes-
sential photograph of your subject doing what she loves. Sometimes you can 
do this quickly, and other times you’ll have to spend an extended amount of 
time with your subject to capture the full scope of what she does. Informal 
portraits are also known as environmental portraits. You’re photographing 
your subject in her environment where she’s totally at ease and in command 
of her game.
Here are some ideas for informal portraits:
 
✓ Don’t rush the photo shoot. Let your subject get into his routine. Just 
sit back calmly and observe. When your subject starts doing something 
interesting, compose the scene and take the picture.
 
✓ Don’t suggest poses. Just let your subject start to make her magic, doing 
whatever she does. When you let nature run its course, you’ll capture 
natural hand movements and expressions.

156
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
✓ Focus on your subject’s eyes. You’ll be able to accurately capture his 
expressions as he concentrates on the task at hand. When creating por-
traits, it’s always good practice to switch to a single auto-focus point.
 
✓ Use selective focus. If your subject uses a tool in her work, such as a 
paintbrush, choose a large aperture, a focal length that’s the 35mm 
equivalent of 85mm or larger, and switch to a single auto-focus point. 
Lock the exposure on the subject’s paintbrush as she moves it from pal-
ette to the canvas. The canvas will be in soft focus, as will the subject’s 
face, but the face will still be recognizable. Selective focus draws atten-
tion to the tool of your subject’s trade, thereby creating a compelling 
informal portrait. Here’s a portrait of a businessman getting ready to 
shake hands. Selective focus is used to render his hand in sharp focus, 
yet his face is still recognizable. (See Figure 8-4.)
Purestock
Figure 8-4: Using selective focus.

157
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
Creating Candid Portraits
Candid portraits are similar to informal portraits; the portrait isn’t photo-
graphed using backdrops or studio lighting. The difference between a candid 
portrait and an informal portrait is the location. You’re not photographing 
the subject at his place of work or performing his favorite hobby or pastime. 
You’re capturing a photograph of your subject doing something funny or 
endearing. You can capture a candid portrait almost anywhere. All you need 
is to have camera in hand and be alert enough to realize when your subject’s 
getting ready to do something interesting.
Children are also great subjects for candid portraits. Photograph your child 
at play, when he’s taking music lessons, or studying. Children have a ten-
dency to act like hams in front of a camera. If your child goes over the top, 
put the camera down and let him get involved in what he’s doing. When he’s 
focusing more on his activity than you, pick up the camera again and start 
taking pictures. (See Figure 8-5.)
Purestock
Figure 8-5: Children are great subjects for candid portraits.

158
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Here are a few candid photography tips:
 
✓ Use a standard focal length lens. A standard focal length lens, which 
is the 35mm equivalent of 50mm, lets you include some of the area in 
which you’re photographing your subject. The extra information adds 
to the story. When you compose your image, back up and examine the 
scene through your viewfinder or LCD monitor. When you see an inter-
esting composition with just enough elements to identify the area in 
which you’re taking the picture, press the shutter button. 
 
✓ Don’t use your largest aperture. When you want to add some elements 
from the environment to your candid portrait, use a smaller aperture 
than you normally would use for shooting a portrait. For example, if the 
largest aperture on your camera is f/2.8, change to f/4.0 when creating 
candid portraits. The added depth of field tells something about the 
area in which the image is photographed, but the background is still 
softer than you’d want when photographing a landscape. You’re giving 
the viewers a hint about the surrounding area, yet the center of interest 
is your subject, who is in sharp focus.
 
✓ Spend some time with your subject. Unless you know your subject very 
well, he’ll be a bit nervous when you first start taking pictures. With 
time, this will pass, and he will start to relax and act normally. That’s 
when the photo opportunities begin, so make sure you’ve got your 
camera ready.
 
✓ Get your subject to relax. Some people find it very hard to relax when 
they know they’re being photographed. Establish a rapport with your 
subject, as outlined in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Agree on a location. Does your subject have some kind of routine or 
ritual? Does she go for a walk every evening with her dog? Does she take 
yoga classes? Meet your subject on location, fade into the background, 
and wait for something interesting to happen.
 
✓ Use a small camera. Even though your subject knows you’re photo-
graphing him, a digital SLR with a telephoto zoom lens is intimidating. If 
you own a small point-and-shoot camera that delivers good image qual-
ity, use it when you want to create your candid portraits. You will get a 
larger depth of field with a point-and-shoot camera, so be sure to keep 
this in mind when choosing the location as even distant elements will 
be sharper than they would if you were shooting with a digital SLR using 
the same focal length and f/stop.
 
✓ Pre-focus the camera. When your subject starts doing something inter-
esting, look away and pre-focus the camera on a subject that’s the same 
distance from your camera as your subject. Keep the shutter button 
pressed halfway and watch your subject from the corner of your eye. 
Move the camera toward your subject when he does something you want 
to capture digitally, and press the shutter button the rest of the way.

159
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
 
✓ Shoot from the hip. When you raise the camera to your eye, it’s a dead 
giveaway that you’re going to take a photo of your subject. Unless you’re 
quick, his expression will change when he sees you pointing the camera at 
him. If your camera has a swivel monitor, place the camera at waist level 
and compose your picture. When your subject does something interest-
ing, press the shutter button. You can also rest your camera on the edge 
of a table and compose the scene through the LCD monitor and remain 
alert. When your subject does something interesting, take a picture.
 
✓ Wait until your subject’s occupied. If someone starts talking to your 
subject, she drops her guard and looks at the other person. This is a 
great time to capture a candid photo of your subject with a natural 
expression on her face.
You’ll get great candid portraits if you’re ready and focused on your subject. 
This doesn’t mean you have to have the camera at your eye at all times. Do 
your best to blend in and let your subject get used to your presence.
Shooting Portraits of Wildlife
Many photographers pore through magazines like National Geographic and 
Audubon with envy. Wildlife photography represents the beauty of nature, 
something you can capture with your digital camera. All you need is a digi-
tal camera with a zoom lens, and you’re ready to shoot some wildlife. The 
beauty of shooting wildlife with a camera is that the wildlife lives to see 
another day, and you’ve got a wonderful memento of your encounter. Some 
areas of the world are closer to wildlife than others. But if you have the 
slightest interest in photographing wildlife, you can do so from just about 
anywhere in the world. The following sections are devoted to tips and tech-
niques for photographing wildlife in nature and in city parks and zoos.
Photographing birds and wildlife in state parks
If you live in a state that has wildlife reserves and state parks, you can get 
some wonderful photos of animals and birds in their natural habitat. For a 
small fee, you can enter a state park and explore. Most state parks give you 
a map with hiking trails and points of interest. The park rangers can also 
be helpful and tell you where to find the hot spots for nature photography. 
Wildlife photography is challenging, but the end results are well worth the 
effort.
The easiest way to find spots to photograph wildlife near your home is to 
type into your favorite search engine the phrase state park, followed by 
the name of the town or county in which you live. Other good sources of 
information are the salespeople in your local camera store, or members 
of a local camera club. I live in an area where there are many state parks. 
I recently moved here, but I had the good fortune to find a photography 

160
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
buddy who has shown me many of the wonderful wildlife hot spots near my 
home. Here are some of the things I’ve learned about photographing wildlife 
in a state park:
 
✓ Use a long lens. Unless you’re photographing large animals, you’ll need 
a long lens with a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 300mm or 
greater. Most state parks are animal sanctuaries from civilization. The 
animals are wary of human beings. A long lens is the only way you’ll be 
able to get close-ups of the animals.
 
✓ Choose the proper shutter speed. When you’re photographing wildlife 
with a long lens, camera shake is magnified. Choose a shutter speed 
that is equal to the reciprocal of the 35mm equivalent of the lens you’re 
using. If you’re using a 300mm lens, that means you should choose 
a shutter speed that is at least 1/300 of a second. You can shoot at a 
slightly slower shutter speed if your camera or lens is equipped with 
image stabilization. You may have to increase the ISO to get the proper 
shutter speed, especially if you’re photographing wildlife in a forest or in 
dense foliage. A tripod is also useful to stabilize the camera.
 
✓ Use a large aperture (small f-stop number). When you’re creating wild-
life portraits, the shallow depth of field you get using a large aperture 
ensures that your viewer’s attention is drawn toward the animal, not the 
background.
 
✓ Switch to a single auto-focus point and focus on the animal’s eyes. If 
the eyes are out of focus, you’ve missed the shot. When you’re shooting 
wildlife with a long lens and using a large aperture, you’ve got a very 
shallow depth of field, which makes accurate focus a necessity. If the 
animal’s eyes are in focus, your viewer assumes the entire animal is in 
focus, even with a shallow depth of field.
 
✓ Always travel with a buddy. Many of the animals in state parks are 
fairly innocuous. However, some of the inhabitants can be dangerous 
if you’re not on your toes. Many state parks have bears, alligators, and 
other animals that can be hazardous to your health when provoked. 
While you’re in the moment photographing a bird, your buddy can 
watch your back and make sure a dangerous animal isn’t sneaking up 
on you. Consider the following image of an alligator feeding. (See Figure 
8-6.) These animals can leave the water at incredible speed and are very 
dangerous when they’re breeding. Fortunately, I was a long way from 
this toothy critter. I captured the image with a 500mm lens.
 
✓ Never feed the animals. You may be tempted to feed an animal to coax 
it within range. Not only does this put you in potential danger, it also 
causes the animal to lose its fear of humans.
 
✓ Look for changes. When you’re photographing animals in the wild, they 
blend in with the scenery and can be hard to spot. Blending with the 
background helps the animal hide from potential predators. Look for 
changes in color and slight movements as you hike on a trail or drive 
down a park road.

161
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
Figure 8-6: Exercise extreme caution around wildlife.
 
✓ Travel out and back. Arrive at the park early and drive the length of 
the park looking for potential hot spots for wildlife photography. If you 
follow my sage advice and travel with a buddy, he can drive on the way 
out, and you can drive on the way back. This gives you both an equal 
opportunity to capture some great photos.
 
✓ Use your vehicle as a blind. If you’re traveling in a white van or SUV, 
the vehicle can double as a blind. When you see something interesting, 
park the vehicle and exit from the side opposite the animal you want to 
photograph. You can photograph from the front of the vehicle, and your 
buddy can photograph from the back of the vehicle. I recently used this 
technique in a state park and was rewarded with a wonderful photo of a 
deer. (See Figure 8-7.) This was the second photo I took. The deer heard 
the click of the shutter and raised her ears. She ran off after the second 
shot. You can also park the vehicle by the side of the road in an area 
where you’ve seen wildlife before. Stand on the side of the vehicle that’s 
opposite the area where you expect the animals to appear. Wait patiently 
and look through the vehicle windows. When you see something interest-
ing, quietly walk to the front or back of the vehicle and take the picture.
 
✓ Know your subject. Animals are somewhat predictable. After you pho-
tograph an animal species for a while, you get to learn its habits. An 
animal generally moves its head in the direction it’s about to travel. 
Another benefit to knowing your subject is being able to figure when 
they’ll stray from cover to feed.

162
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
✓ Protect yourself. In addition to keeping a safe distance from dangerous 
animals, make sure you’re wearing the proper clothing. If you’re hiking 
on a narrow trail, or through underbrush, wear long pants and hiking 
boots. Remember to use sunscreen to protect your skin. And make sure 
you’re properly hydrated. Even if you’re just going out for a short after-
noon jaunt, pack a cooler with a couple of bottles of water and some 
snacks to keep your energy up. If you leave the vehicle and go for a hike, 
carry a bottle of water with you. Some camera backpacks have compart-
ments in which you can carry a bottle of water without endangering 
your camera gear.
Wildlife photography is a lot of fun. The trick is to practice until you’re per-
fect. Shoot lots of pictures and get to know the wildlife sanctuaries, state 
parks, and animal preserves near your home. Visit them over and over until 
you know the lay of the land and its inhabitants like you know your own 
neighborhood. Then you’re well on your way to creating wonderful wildlife 
portraits.

Creating animal portraits at the zoo and in city parks
If you don’t have wildlife preserves or state parks with wildlife near where 
you live, you can still get some interesting pictures of wildlife at the nearest 
zoo, or at a city park. Most major cities have a zoo, and many cities have 
parks with birds and other wildlife. Visiting nearby zoos or city parks is a 
great way to photograph wildlife when you live in a metropolitan area. It’s 
also a bit safer than roaming through the woods. In the upcoming sections, I 
show you some techniques for photographing animals in a zoo or city park.
Photographing animals at the zoo
If you live in a big city or don’t have nature reserves near where you live, you 
can still get some great shots of wildlife at your local zoo. A city zoo can be a 
home to a diverse group of animals, from exotic birds to primates like mon-
keys or orangutans. But zoos are busy places with fences and crowds. Below 
are a few tips for getting great shots of wildlife at your local zoo:
 
✓ Visit the zoo on an off day when there will be fewer crowds to contend 
with.
 
✓ Visit the zoo early in the morning, or late in the afternoon when the light 
is better. You won’t get good results if you try to photograph animals in 
the afternoon when the sun produces harsh shadows.
 
✓ Know when the animals are fed. They’re likely to be more active prior to 
feeding time. You may be able to get this information from the zoo.
 
✓ When you find an animal you want to photograph, make sure there are 
no humans in the frame. Also make sure there are no signs in the picture 
or other items that would be a dead giveaway that the picture was taken 
at a zoo.
 
✓ If the animal is behind a glass enclosure, press your camera right up to 
the glass to eliminate glare and any possible reflection.
 
✓ Photograph the animal at his level. If you photograph the animal from 
above, it’s a dead giveaway you’re in a zoo. If the animal is below you in an 
enclosure, wait until he walks to a higher level and then take the picture.
 
✓ Use a telephoto lens and choose a large aperture (small f-stop number). 
Move around to compose the best possible picture, zoom in on the 
animal, and then patiently wait until the animal strikes up an amus-
ing pose and take the picture. Hang around for a few minutes, and the 
animal may do some other interesting things. (See Figure 8-8.)
 
✓ If there are objects such as fences, posts, or other telltale signs the image 
was photographed at a zoo, crop them out in your image-editing program.
 
✓ Photograph your children with animals at the petting zoo. Most zoos 
have an area where young children can interact with animals and pet 
them. This can be the source of some wonderful photos of your kids 
learning about animals.

164
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
✓ Be patient. Animals have their own agenda. If the animal is asleep when 
you get to his habitat, or not doing anything interesting, wait a few min-
utes until something interesting does happen.
Figure 8-8: Photographing wildlife at your local zoo.
The best way to get great shots from your local zoo is to visit often and shoot 
lots of images. After a few visits, you’ll know your way around, the zoo atten-
dants will recognize and help you, plus you’ll know more about the habits of 
the critters that live at the zoo.
Photographing birds in city parks
If you live near a city with lakes, you may be near a hot spot for bird photo-
graphy. Many cities protect birds within city limits and create sanctuaries 
where the birds can breed and raise their young. If the lake is in the middle of 

165
 Chapter 8: Photographing Portraits on Location
a crowded city, it can be difficult to get a good picture without telltale signs 
of civilization in the background. To get good photographs of birds in a city 
park, try these techniques:
 
✓ Go early in the morning or late in the afternoon. You’ll have better 
light to work with at these times of day. The harsh midday sunlight isn’t 
a good solution for any type of subject, including birds.
 
✓ Use a telephoto lens with a large aperture (low f-stop number). Using 
a telephoto lens enables you to photograph the birds from a distance. 
Even protected birds in a city park will be spooked by the sight of a 
human at close range. The large aperture helps to blur out the back-
ground, thereby minimizing buildings and other signs of civilization.
 
✓ Get down to the bird’s level. You’ll get a more natural-looking photo 
if you drop down to the bird’s level. This often means kneeling in wet 
grass. Make sure you wear an old pair of jeans when you photograph 
birds. It’s also a good idea to look before you kneel, so you don’t land in 
a pile of bird poop.
 
✓ Photograph on a cloudy day or a foggy morning. A cloudy day gives 
you wonderfully diffuse light without harsh shadows. If the day is com-
pletely overcast, you have no shadows. And if you photograph birds in 
heavy fog, the resulting images won’t show any signs of civilization. (See 
Figure 8-9.)
Figure 8-9: Using fog to erase signs of civilization at a city park.

166
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
 
✓ Take one shot and move closer. Get as close as you think you can with-
out spooking the bird and then take a picture. With one picture in the 
bank, move closer and take another. If you approach the bird cautiously, 
you won’t spook him and may end up getting an extreme close-up.
Bird photography is a lot of fun. When you find a great place to photograph 
birds, visit the place often and learn the habits of the birds. You can also go 
online to learn a lot about the birds that inhabit your local park. Many city 
parks also have informative signs or displays with pictures of the birds you’ll 
see in the area, with information about the fine-feathered friends as well.

Y
ou can create portraits anywhere as long as you’ve got a subject and a 
photogenic — or for that matter, Plain Jane — background. But if you 
really want to tell something about your subject, photograph him in 
his home or in his office. Viewers of the photo can learn a lot 
more about your subject because of the background and 
surrounding objects. This type of photography has its 
rewards as well as challenges. In this chapter, I show 
you techniques for creating interesting portraits of 
your subject where he works and lives.

Photojournalist
You’ve got a digital camera and know how to use it. 
So use it. Photograph any of your family’s meaning-
ful moments, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and so 
on. Photograph the everyday events as well. Life is short.

Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
If you have both very young and very old relatives, the young relatives may 
have a hard time remembering the older members of your family when 
they’re no longer on this mortal plane. But if you take your camera with you 
wherever you go and photograph your family and relatives at family gather-
ings, parties, or just being themselves in their homes, you create a legacy for 
your immediate relatives and future generations. If you’re meticulous about 
archiving your work, it will stand the test of time. For more information 
about archiving your work, see Chapter 10.
You’ll know which events are important to you and your family. If your family 
is religious, you’ll want to take pictures of special events such as baptisms 
and Bar Mitzvahs. Birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries are no-brainers. 
But what separates your work from the boring, ho-hum shots of the smiling 
graduate or the birthday girl blowing out her candles are the types of shots 
you take. Don’t get me wrong; those shots are important, but a photojournal-
ist doesn’t capture a single moment for each event. A photojournalist cap-
tures events behind the scene, such as the graduate’s mother hugging her 
son after the ceremony.
You should also get photos of family members going about their daily activi-
ties. And make sure to capture photos of people’s hobbies, the technologies 
they use, and so on. Text messaging is currently a very cool way for adoles-
cents to keep in touch with their family and friends. Photos of young people 
using current technology or fads will be interesting in 20 or 30 years as the 
technology evolves. It will also be a source of amusement for the person in 
the photo. (See Figure 9-1.)
Being the family photojournalist is fun and rewarding. Your relatives may 
object to your poking the camera in their faces at every moment, no matter 
how important or how trivial. But they’ll come to appreciate your dedication 
to the family when a family member moves or a loved one passes on.
After a while, you’ll end up with hundreds, maybe thousands, of photos of 
your family. You can use the photos to create special gifts like calendars, 
coffee table books, coffee mugs, mouse pads, and much more. You’ll find an 
endless resource for photo products online.

Creating Formal Portraits in Your Home
Formal portraits are posed, and the subject is usually photographed against 
a background or backdrop. You can create formal portraits in the comfort of 
your own home. All you need is a relatively large room with a blank wall, and 
you’re ready to start creating portraits. It’s also a good idea to have a formal 
chair or a stool upon which your subject can sit.

170
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Formal portraits are usually created in studios with multiple backgrounds, 
props, studio lighting, and so on. Purchasing lighting equipment and back-
grounds is all well and good for a professional photographer, but if you’re 
shooting portraits only occasionally, purchasing expensive equipment and 
accessories isn’t economically feasible, unless you’ve recently won the lot-
tery or inherited a large sum of money. Even so, it’s still not practical to 
invest a lot of money in something you don’t use frequently. You can get good 
portraits in your home using relatively inexpensive equipment. The portrait 
in Figure 9-2 was created in my home studio, which consists of a backdrop 
and two lights. In the next sections, I show you some ways to create portraits 
in your home on the cheap.
Figure 9-2: Creating portraits in a home studio.

 Chapter 9: Photographing Portraits in Your Home or Office
Using backdrops and backgrounds
Every formal portrait has some type of background or backdrop. Professional 
photographers buy their backdrops and backgrounds from companies that 
do nothing but create backdrops and backgrounds. You can find online ven-
dors by typing photography backgrounds and backdrops in the search field 
of your favorite search engine. You can also pick up fairly inexpensive back-
grounds by doing a search on eBay.
Most photography backgrounds are made of muslin. The backdrops are 
made of a heavier fabric upon which paint is applied. The paint can be 
abstract patterns or something that simulates a scene. If you do decide to 
purchase a commercial background or backdrop, purchase one that has 
grommets. The grommets are used to attach the backdrop to a rod. In my 
last house, I screwed two hooks into the ceiling and placed a piece of con-
duit through the hooks. I put shower curtain holders over the conduit and 
snapped them into the grommets on the backdrop. With this setup, I could 
put a backdrop up in a matter of minutes. When the photo shoot was over, 
I removed the backdrop from the conduit, and then I removed the conduit 
from the hooks in the ceiling.
 
If you’re adventurous, you can create your own backdrops. You can find inter-
esting fabrics for backgrounds and backdrops at your local fabric store. 
Purchase a piece of muslin fabric approximately 9 x 9 feet, some fabric dye, 
and then use the time-honored tie-dye technique to create a unique back-
drop. You can find tutorials about creating backdrops by typing DIY photogra-
phy backgrounds into the search field of your favorite search engine. Take the 
DIY info with as many grains of salt as you wish, but make sure the author 
posts some pictures of the process and the end result. A picture is worth a 
thousand words.
If you create formal portraits only every now and again, you can improvise to 
create a backdrop. All you need is a bed sheet. Bed sheets come in many dif-
ferent colors, and they’re suitable backgrounds for head-and-shoulders shots. 
You can use push pins to hang the bed sheet on a wall. Straighten the sheet 
to remove as many of the wrinkles as possible. If you’ve got some stubborn 
wrinkles, try using Downy Wrinkle Releaser. 
When you’re ready to start shooting photos, ask your subject to move 
several feet in front of the backdrop, and use a large aperture (low f-stop 
number). This combination renders the background as an out-of-focus blur, 
which has the added benefit of blurring any wrinkles. 

172
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Creating a makeshift studio
You can create a makeshift studio in a large room. All you need is a blank 
wall, onto which you’ll hang a background or backdrop, and a nearby 
window. You can quickly create a makeshift studio by following these steps:
 
1. Move any large furniture and other obstacles away from the wall on 
which you’re going to add your background or backdrop.
 
2. Adhere your background or backdrop to the wall.
 
 I find that large pushpins are perfect for this. They don’t leave huge 
holes in the wall, and they do a good job of holding your backdrop or 
background in place. The only exception is if you’re using a heavy com-
mercial backdrop. In that case, you’ll have to invest in a backdrop stand.
 
3. If needed, place a sheet over the window to diffuse the light.
 
 If you’re photographing on a cloudy day, or you have sheer curtains, this 
step isn’t needed. Now you have one light source. 
 
 But if you’re photographing in a dark room, you’ll need some way to illu-
minate the shadow side of your subject’s face. Room lights are never a 
good option because you can’t direct the light. Your best bet is a reflec-
tor of some sort.
If you don’t have a lot of light coming in through the window, you may end up 
with a slow shutter speed. If this is the case, mount your camera on a tripod.
 
After you set up your studio, position your subject, choose your largest aper-
ture, point your camera at your subject, and then press the shutter button 
halfway. Your camera will meter the scene and tell you what shutter speed 
will be used. If the shutter speed is too low, mount the camera on a tripod, or 
choose the highest ISO at which your camera can take relatively noise-free 
pictures. You may still have to use a tripod when choosing a higher ISO, but 
at least your subject won’t have to remain motionless for too long.
 
4. Position your subject.
 
 If you’re doing a head-and-shoulders portrait, have your subject sit 
on a stool or kitchen chair. Make sure the chair isn’t visible in the 
viewfinder. It’s also a good idea to have your subject move away from 
the backdrop, if possible. This minimizes the appearance of any wrinkles 
in the backdrop. Moving your subject farther from the backdrop also 
helps eliminate your subject’s shadow on the backdrop. The best advice 
is to examine everything carefully in your viewfinder and LCD monitor 
before you decide on the final position from which your subject will be 
photographed.

173
 Chapter 9: Photographing Portraits in Your Home or Office
 
5. Add a reflector to bounce light back into the shadow side of your sub-
ject’s face.
 
 You can use a commercial reflector, as outlined in Chapter 7. A 4 x 8-foot 
piece of Styrofoam, which you can purchase from your local building 
supply store, also doubles as a great reflector. You can use a chair to 
hold the piece of Styrofoam in place.
 
6. Adjust the position of the reflector.
 
 Move the reflector closer to your subject to bounce more light into the 
shadows, or away from your subject to bounce less light into the shad-
ows. If you’re working solo, you can gauge your results by the amount of 
light on the shadow side of your subject’s face. You can see the results 
in your viewfinder, LCD monitor, or by eye. If you have an assistant, tell 
him which direction you want the reflector moved. 
 
7. Add some fill flash.
 
 If you’re shooting with only natural light, fill flash will add some sparkle 
to your subject’s eyes. In addition to the window light and the reflector, 
this is almost like working with three lights. Make sure you use some 
kind of device to diffuse the flash, as outlined in Chapter 7. Alternatively, 
you can bounce the flash off a white ceiling. 
Your makeshift studio setup should resemble Figure 9-3.

Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Studio lighting kits
If you’re really adventurous, you can create great portraits with a studio light-
ing kit. Studio lighting kits come with one, two, or three lights, light stands, 
and umbrellas. For a basic head-and-shoulders portrait, you can get by with 
a one-light kit. If you’re photographing more than one person or want more 
control over your lighting, consider picking up a two-light set.
If you use a one-light setup, position the light to one side of your subject and 
point the light at a 45-degree angle. This illuminates one side of your subject 
and casts the other side of your subject in deep shadow. You can fill in the light 
on the shadow side of your subject using a commercial reflector. A good alter-
native is a 4 x 8 piece of Styrofoam. Move the reflector closer to or farther from 
your subject to vary the amount of light that is reflected to the shadow side of 
your subject. Figure 9-4 shows a one-light setup as described here.

Figure 9-4: Using a one-light setup for portrait photography.
If you use a two-light setup, position the lights equidistant from your subject 
and point each light at a 45-degree angle. One light will be the main light, and 
the second light will be the fill light. Decrease the power of the fill light by 25 
percent. Figure 9-5 shows a two-light setup as described here.
 
If you have three studio lights, place one behind and to the side of your sub-
ject. Point the light at the backdrop to illuminate it. If you’re using a white 
backdrop, you can decrease the power of the main and fill light, and keep the 
third light at 100 percent power. You may have to experiment a bit to get the 

175

right ratio, but when you do, the white background will be blown out to solid 
white, which makes selecting the background very easy in an application like 
Photoshop Elements.

Creating Informal Portraits in a Home or Office
When you capture an informal portrait of a friend or loved one, you’re pho-
tographing the person doing an everyday task, such as cooking or cleaning, 
working, or doing something they love, such as a hobby. To create informal 
portraits in your home, all you need is a camera and knowledge of your 
subject. Informal portraits are similar to candid portraits, but your subject 
is aware of the fact that you’re photographing him. Informal portraits aren’t 
posed. Your job as a photographer is to get your subject involved with what-
ever activity it is you’re going to photograph him doing. Once your subject is 
engrossed with the task at hand, you can begin taking pictures. Here are a few 
things to consider when creating an informal portrait:
 
✓ Let your subject relax. Sit back calmly and observe your subject as he 
gets into his routine. When he starts doing something interesting, take 
the picture.
 
✓ Don’t suggest poses. Just let your subject start doing whatever she 
does. When your subject starts focusing on the task at hand, you’ll cap-
ture natural expressions and hand movement. (See Figure 9-6.)
 
✓ Focus on your subject’s eyes and you’ll be able to accurately capture his 
expressions as he works. When creating portraits, it’s always good prac-
tice to switch to a single auto-focus point to ensure that your subject’s 
eyes are in focus.

176
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Figure 9-6: Creating an informal portrait.
 
✓ Use natural lighting if possible. If you’re taking pictures in the subject’s 
home, use window light when at all possible — and if necessary, aug-
ment the lighting with a reflector or fill flash.
 
✓ Capture the big scene. If your subject is doing something that involves 
equipment or nearby objects, zoom out so you can see the tools of his 
trade. As you’re composing the picture, pay attention to what’s in your 
viewfinder. If the scene looks cluttered, either physically remove some 
objects or zoom in until you see the image you envision.
 
✓ Choose the proper aperture. If your portrait involves a subject and one 
piece of machinery, or a tool, use a large aperture. If there are support-
ing players in your cast, such as a chef’s utensils, cookware, and kitchen, 

177
 Chapter 9: Photographing Portraits in Your Home or Office
choose a slightly smaller aperture and focus on your subject. Your sub-
ject will be in sharp focus, and the area in front of and behind her will be 
out of focus — yet the items will still be recognizable.
 
✓ Use selective focus. If your subject uses specialized tools in his work, 
choose a large aperture (low f-stop number) and switch to a single auto-
focus point. Lock the focus on the subject’s tool as he works. The tool 
will be in sharp focus, and your subject will be out of focus but recogniz-
able. If your subject is too out-of-focus for your taste, switch to a slightly 
smaller aperture.
Creating a Slice-of-Life Portrait
A slice-of-life portrait isn’t a picture of a person; it’s a picture of things he 
owns and uses in his profession. A slice-of-life portrait can also be a photo-
graph of things he uses in his favorite hobby or pastime. In essence, a slice-
of-life portrait is a still life that immediately tells the viewer something about 
the owner of the things in the photograph. If the viewer knows the owner of 
the objects, the slice-of-life portrait is instantly recognizable. (See Figure 9-7.)
Figure 9-7: A slice-of-life portrait with a loved one’s favorite objects.

178
Part II: Portrait Photography Techniques 
Here are a few tips for creating a slice-of-life portrait:
 
✓ Lighting: Window light is ideal for any type of still life photography. 
Alternatively, you can use bounce flash or photograph the still life 
outdoors on a cloudy day. You can also use one of the flash modifiers 
mentioned in Chapter 7 to get soft, diffuse light for your still life.
 
✓ Number of elements: Don’t empty your subject’s desk drawer, dump it 
on the table, and expect to get an artistic still life. Limit the still life to 
five items or fewer. It’s always better to use an odd number of objects 
for a slice-of-life portrait. For some slice-of-life portraits, even one item 
is sufficient, as long as it speaks volumes about its owner.
 
✓ Contrast: Contrast adds interest to a slice-of-life portrait. The contrast 
can come from the lighting, or from the objects used in the portrait. If 
the subject has varying interests, populate the image with items that 
are in direct contrast with each other. You can also use light and dark 
objects to provide contrast.
 
✓ Background: The background for your still life should be simple and 
not distract from the image. Place the objects on a black or white back-
ground and you’ll have a glare-free background that doesn’t detract 
from the objects in your image. Alternatively, a nice piece of wood with 
simple grain can be a good background for a slice-of-life portrait with 
tools.
 
✓ Inspiration: When your goal is to create a slice-of-life portrait, interview 
your subject and ask him about the important things in his life, career, 
family, and so on. With this information, you can scour his office or 
home to find objects for your portrait. Use your creativity to find the 
items you think tell the best story about your subject, based on your 
interview. If you know your subject well, the job will be easier. However, 
you may want to include a question about his favorite objects to make 
sure you nail the portrait.
 
✓ Lens: Most objects used for this type of portrait are fairly small. 
Therefore, you’ll have to use a macro (close-up) lens to get close 
enough. Many point-and-shoot cameras have a macro button, perhaps 
with a flower icon on it. Your camera manufacturer may also have avail-
able a close-up attachment that screws into the accessory threads of 
your camera lens.

our images do you absolutely no good if you keep them on the memory 
card. It’s really inconvenient to drag the camera out every time you 
want to show someone what you’ve photographed. You also run 
out of memory cards real quick — I know this is a case of the 
blindingly obvious, but some of you may not have used a 
digital camera before. In this chapter, I show you how to 
get the images out of the camera and into your com-

such as resizing and cropping images. If your camera

Elements, you will find useful information here.
Introducing Photoshop Elements 8
Photoshop Elements 8 is a powerful image-editing program. You use 
the application to tweak your photos, color-correct images, and so on. You 
also use the program to organize your images into collections. The following 
sections are dedicated to organizing and editing your images in Photoshop 
Elements 8.

Getting to know Photoshop Elements 8
When you first launch Photoshop Elements, you have a choice to make: 
which workspace to select, Organize or Editing. The choice depends on 
what you’re using the application for. If you’re using the application to sort, 
rename, and find images, choose the Organize workspace. In this workspace, 
you can also back up your image collection, manage your catalog of images, 
add images to the catalog, and much more. You can also edit images you 
select from the Organize workspace. I refer to the Organize workspace (see 
Figure 10-1) in upcoming sections. I introduce you to the Editing workspaces 
in the section, “A Tale of Two Editing Workspaces,” later in this chapter.

Downloading your images
After you finish a photo shoot, your first step is to get your images into your 
computer. Many cameras have a USB port and cable you can use to download 
your images. This, however, depletes the camera battery and is also fairly 
slow. A much better method of downloading your images is to use a card 
reader. There are a lot of different card readers on the market, and many of 
them support multiple memory card formats. Find one that matches your 
memory card type. The following steps show you how to download images 
using a card reader and a Windows operating system:
 
1. Connect your card reader to the computer.
 
 Figure 10-2 shows a SanDisk card reader attached to a laptop computer.
 
2. Insert a card into the reader.
 
 Windows makes a noise to notify you that media has been attached. (If 
you have Windows Vista, it makes a really annoying noise, in my humble 
opinion.) Shortly after the notification, a window also appears, giving 
you options. (See Figure 10-3.) The default option for a Windows operat-
ing system is shown.

Figure 10-3: Choosing the right downloading option.
 
3. Choose Organize and Edit Using Adobe Elements Organizer 8.0.
 
 The Elements Organizer – Photo Downloader dialog box appears. (See 
Figure 10-4.)
 
4. Specify the following settings:
 
• Location: Click the Browse button and navigate to the desired loca-
tion where you want to save your photos. I advise that you set up 
a main folder on your hard drive for all of your digital images, and 
then create subfolders for the years. For example, my main image 
folder is called Digital Images. I set up a new subfolder for each year.
 
• Create Subfolder(s): The default option is the Shot Date. This is a 
good way to keep your images organized. However, I recommend 
you go one step further and choose the Custom Name option 
from the drop-down menu. When you do this, a text field appears 
beneath the first drop-down menu, allowing you to specify a new 
name. I name my folders with the date of the shoot, followed by 
the place or person I photographed. For example, if I photograph a 
girl named Dawn on November 25, 2009, I name the folder 112509_
DAWN. This keeps the folders organized by date and makes it easy 
to locate a specific folder of images.

185
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Figure 10-4: Downloading images to your computer.
 
• Rename Files: The default option doesn’t rename files. If you select 
this option, your camera will use a default naming option that isn’t 
very user friendly; it will name all your files with an acronym like 
IMG or DSC, followed by a four-digit number. If you want to stay 
organized, choose one of the renaming options from the drop-down 
menu. My favorite is Shot Date (yy mm dd) + Custom Name. I use the 
subject’s name for the custom name. Choosing this option will give 
you image names like 112509_DAWN_ followed by a 4-digit number. 
 
• Preserve Current Filename in XMP: This option records the current 
filename (the default name from your camera) as metadata in an 
XMP file. Metadata is data from your camera such as the date the 
image was shot, the focal length, shutter speed, and so on. This 
information is automatically generated by your camera along with 
the filename according to the naming conventions used by your 
camera manufacturer. An XMP file is a small data file that records 
this information. It is stored in the same folder in which the image 
is saved. When the image is opened, Photoshop Elements reads 
the metadata from the XMP file.
 
• Open Organizer when Finished: This option opens the Elements 
Organizer after the download is finished, where you can do further 
organizing.

186
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
• Delete Options: Choose one of the options from the drop-down 
menu. The default option doesn’t delete the originals. There’s also 
an option to verify and delete originals, which verifies that the 
images have downloaded properly. However, I recommend that you 
stick with the default option and format your cards in the camera 
after downloading them. Your camera is better equipped to opti-
mally format your memory cards for future use.
 
• Automatic Download: This option automatically downloads images 
whenever you insert a card in your card reader or connect a 
camera to the computer. I recommend that you leave this option 
deselected so you can rename your photos and specify the folder 
in which they’re saved.
 
5. Click Get Photos.
 
 Photoshop Elements downloads the images into the specified folder and 
opens the Organizer (if you specified that option).
 
You can perform other tasks when downloading photos by clicking the 
Advanced Dialog button. In the Advanced section of the Elements Organizer 
dialog box, you can specify which images are included in the download, 
rotate images, fix red-eye, apply copyright information, and so on. For more 
information on the Advanced options, check out Photoshop Elements 8 For 
Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova (Wiley Publishing).
Organizing your work
After you download images into the Organizer, you can perform other steps 
to organize your images even further. You can rank your images, add key-
words to your images, select images to add to an album, and much more. In 
the upcoming sections, I show you how to get your ducks in a row.
Ranking images
If you’ve imported lots of pictures, it’s hard to know which ones to edit. You 
can make things easy on yourself by ranking your imported images so that 
the fine distinctions between images become more obvious. 
I generally make two passes. In the first pass, I give the best images a 3-star 
rating. Then I press the icon above the image thumbnails to filter the images 
and show photos with 3-star and higher ratings. To do this, press the third 
star icon and then choose And Higher from the drop-down menu. On the next 
pass, I give the best of those images a 4-star rating. On the final pass, I filter 
the images to show only 4-star ratings and higher. The images I’m going to 
edit get a 5-star rating.
The following steps show you how to separate the wheat from the chaff and 
select a group of candidates you want to edit.

187
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
1. Drag the slider to increase the size of the thumbnails.
 
 You find the slider at the top of the Organizer above the thumbnails. The 
default view of the Organizer shows the imported images as thumbnails, 
very small thumbnails. This doesn’t really give you a chance to see the 
minute details in each image. I prefer to see the whole image. (See Figure 
10-5.) You can quickly do this by double-clicking an image. Alternatively 
you can click the blue square to the right of the thumbnail size slider.
 
2. Rank the first image.
 
 You can rank an image by clicking one of the stars beneath the image, or 
by pressing the number on your keyboard. You can rank images between 
1 and 5, with 1 being the worst image and 5 being the best.
 
3. Navigate to and rank the next image.
 
 If you’re viewing individual thumbnails, click the desired thumbnail and 
then rank it. You can also click a star under any thumbnail to rate it. 
However, it’s hard to get a good look at an image without magnifying it. If 
you’re viewing images at full magnification, press the right-arrow key to 
navigate to the next image.
 
4. Continue ranking images until you’ve ranked all from the shoot.
Figure 10-5: Increase magnification to get a better look at your images.

188
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
After ranking images, you can filter them by clicking a star to the right and 
above the images. You can also choose a viewing option from the drop-down 
menu. The default option is to view images of a certain rank and higher. You 
can choose to view only images with that rank, or images that are the chosen 
rank and lower.
Adding keywords to images
Keywords keep you organized, especially when you want to find images. I 
add keywords to all images, regardless of their rank. You never know when 
you can use a 3-star image you normally wouldn’t edit as part of a collage. 
Keywords make it easy to find images. For example, if you take photos of 
Aunt Milly, you’d use Milly as a keyword. When you have hundreds of 
images of Aunt Milly spread over the course over several months or years, 
some stored in different folders, the keyword of her name will make it easy 
for you to locate all pictures of Milly.
Photoshop Elements has some keyword categories built in. This is a book 
about portrait photography, so our concern when it comes to keywords is 
people. The People keyword category is divided into Family and Friends. You 
can add your own keywords to these categories, and apply them to images as 
follows:
 
1. On the Keyword Tags panel, click the keyword category under which 
you want to create the keyword.
 
 Don’t click the space next to the keyword. That’s used to find images 
with that keyword.
 
2. Click the green plus sign (+).
 
 The Keyword drop-down menu appears. (See Figure 10-6.)
 
3. Choose New Keyword Tag from the drop-down menu.
 
 This opens the Create Keyword Tag dialog box. (See Figure 10-7.)
 
4. Enter the keyword text in the Name field.
 
 We’re portrait photographers. The name of the person in the photo-
graph would be logical.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The new keyword is added to the group, with a question mark for an 
icon. The icon changes as soon as you apply the keyword to an image.
 
6. Continue adding keywords as needed.

 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Figure 10-6: Adding a keyword to a group.
To add a keyword to one or more images, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the images to which you want to apply the 
keyword.
 
 You can select a single image or multiple images. To select contiguous 
images, Shift+click the first and last images. To select noncontiguous 
images, Ctrl+click each image to which you want to apply the keyword.
 
2. Drag the keyword over the selected images.
 
 The keyword tag is applied to the selected images, and the keyword 
tag icon changes to the last picture to which the keyword was applied. 
Each image to which a keyword is applied has a triangular blue icon to 
the right of its thumbnail. Pause your cursor over the icon to see which 
keyword(s) have been applied to the image.
 
3. Continue applying keywords as needed.
 
 That’s right; you can apply multiple keywords to an image. For example, 
you might want to include the place where the image was photographed 
as a keyword.

To find images to which a keyword has been applied, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Keyword Tags panel, click the arrow to the left of the parent 
keyword category.
 
 This expands the category and displays all keywords assigned to the 
category.
 
2. Click the blank square to the left of the keyword.
 
 All images with that keyword are displayed.
 
Choose Display➪Date to view images by date. In this mode, you have access 
to all images you’ve imported. You can display images by day, month, or year.
Creating albums
Albums are collections of your favorite photographs. You can add to an album 
any time you import images. You can also find images that match certain cri-
teria and add them to an album.

191
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
To create an album, follow these instructions:
 
1. On the Albums panel, click the green plus sign (+).
 
 The Albums panel drop-down menu appears. (See Figure 10-8.)
 
2. Choose New Album.
 
 This opens the Album Details panel. (See Figure 10-9.)
 
3. Enter a name for the album in the Album Name text box.
 
 Choose any name that does a good job of describing the photos you 
plan to add.
 
4. Drag images into the Content box to include them in the album.
 
5. After you finish creating the album, click Done.
 
 The album now appears on the Albums panel. Click the album title to 
display the images.
 
Click the Pencil icon to edit a selected album at any time. This opens the 
Album Details panel.

Processing RAW files
If you use your camera’s native RAW mode, you capture everything the 
camera saw with almost no processing. All other image formats are pro-
cessed in the camera and compressed. With the RAW format, you have tre-
mendous latitude. You can adjust the exposure, recover lost highlights, and 
more. You process a RAW image in the Adobe Camera Raw application that 
is part of Photoshop Elements. After you process the image, you can open 
the image in Photoshop Elements to further fine-tune the image. To process a 
RAW file, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the Organizer workspace and select the image you want to 
process.
 
2. From the Fix drop-down menu choose Full Photo Edit, or Quick Photo 
Edit.
 
 The desired editing workspace is loaded, and the Adobe Camera Raw 
application launches. (See Figure 10-10.)
 
3. You can process your images using the following tools from the tool-
bar at the top of the Adobe Camera Raw dialog box:
 
• Zoom: Use this tool to zoom in. Click inside the image to zoom to 
the next highest level of magnification. Press Alt and click your 

193
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
mouse to zoom out. You can also click and drag around the area 
you want to examine. As you drag, a rectangular marquee appears, 
signifying the area you’ll be examining in closer detail.
 
• Hand: Use this tool to pan around the image after magnifying it.
 
 You can press the spacebar when using any other tool to momen-
tarily access the Hand tool. When you release the spacebar, you 
revert to the currently selected tool.
 
• White Balance: Use this tool to adjust the image’s white balance. 
Normally the camera automatically adjusts white balance, or you 
can manually adjust it using camera options as shown in Chapter 3. 
However, if you don’t like the results from the camera, click an area 
that you know should be black, white, or gray. If you don’t get the 
results you want, click another area.

• Crop: Use this tool to cut out a specific part of the image. The tool’s 
default mode allows you to crop to any portion of the image with-
out preserving the image’s aspect ratio. 
 
 You can also choose a specific aspect ratio from the drop-down 
menu. For example, if you’re going to print the image on 8 x 10-inch 
paper, you’d choose the 4 to 5 option. You can also choose Custom 
to open a dialog box that enables you to crop to a custom ratio — 
or a size measured in pixels, inches, or centimeters — by enter-
ing values in text boxes. After choosing an option, click and drag 
inside the image to display a crop rectangle. You can modify the 
size to which you crop by dragging one of the perimeter handles, 
or click and drag inside the rectangle to move it to another posi-
tion. Double-click inside the rectangle to see the cropped image.
 
• Straighten: Use this tool to straighten the image. Click and drag 
along a line you know should be vertical or horizontal and then 
release the mouse button to straighten the image.
 
• Red Eye: Click this tool, and the display changes to reveal the tool’s 
adjustable parameters. Accept the default options, or drag the 
Pupil Size slider to increase or decrease the pupil size relative to 
the eye. Drag the Darken slider to increase or decrease the amount 
by which the pupil is darkened. When you finish setting the param-
eters, drag the tool over the eye and part of the surrounding face, 
and Adobe Camera Raw removes any traces of red-eye it finds.
 
• Camera Raw Preferences: Click this icon to open the Camera Raw 
Preferences dialog box. In this dialog box, you can determine 
whether initial sharpening is applied to your images, whether to 
apply auto-tone adjustments, and so on. Based on previous experi-
ence, I suggest you accept the default options and never venture 
inside this dialog box.
 
• Rotate Left: This tool rotates the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
 
• Rotate Right: This tool rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.
 
• Magnification: Click the plus sign (+) to zoom to the next highest 
level of magnification, or click the minus sign (–) to zoom out to 
the next lowest level of magnification. Alternatively, you can select 
a value from the Magnification drop-down menu.
 
4. On the Basic panel, you can modify the following settings:
 
• White Balance: Accept the default, As Shot, to use the white bal-
ance from your camera. Alternatively, you can choose an option 
from the drop-down menu. Auto will usually get the job done if the 
camera goofed. You can also drag the Temperature slider to the 
right to warm the image, or to the left to cool the image. Drag the 
Tint slider right to add a magenta tint to the image, or left to add a 
cyan tint to the image.

195
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
5. On the Basic panel, you can also click Auto.
 
 When you click Auto, Adobe Camera Raw applies the settings it deems 
optimal for the image. If you don’t like the results, you can modify any of 
the following:
 
• Exposure: Drag the slider right to increase the exposure, or drag it 
left to decrease the exposure. Press Alt while dragging the slider 
to place a black overlay on the image. If you see any colors appear, 
you have blown-out highlights for that color channel. If you see pure 
white, you’ve lost all details in the highlights for the area indicated.
 
• Recovery: Drag the slider to the right to recover blown-out high-
lights. Press Alt while dragging the slider to show a black overlay 
on the image. The areas that are blown out will be indicated by a 
color. Drag the slider until the color disappears.
 
• Fill Light: Drag the slider to the right to add light to the shadows. 
This is sort of like fill flash, which I tell you about in Chapter 7. It 
works quite well as long as you don’t exceed a value of 20.
 
• Black: Drag the slider to the right to darken shadow areas, or drag 
it to the left to lighten them. Hold down the Alt key while dragging 
to display a white overlay. If you see any colors appear as you 
drag the slider, you’re losing detail in that color channel. If you see 
black, you’re losing all detail in that area.
 
• Brightness: Drag the slider to the right to brighten the image, or 
drag it to the left to darken it. This option adjusts the brightness of 
the image midtones without affecting the image exposure. Use this 
option when the image is otherwise properly exposed with a good 
distribution of pixels from shadows to highlights, but you want to 
make the image darker or brighter.
 
• Contrast: Drag the slider to the right to increase contrast; to the left 
to decrease contrast.
 
• Clarity: Drag the slider to the right to add contrast to the midtones 
in your image. This adds more punch to your image.
 
• Vibrance: Drag this slider to make all colors pop, with the excep-
tion of skin tones. This is an ideal way to enhance your image with-
out destroying the subtle pink and red hues of skin tones.
 
• Saturation: Drag this slider to increase saturation of all colors in 
the image. I recommend not using this for portraits because it satu-
rates the skin tones. If you want the colors in the image to pop, use 
the Vibrance slider.
 
6. In the panel on the right, click the Detail icon.
 
 This opens the Detail panel (see Figure 10-11). In this tab you adjust 
image sharpening and specify the amount noise reduction that will 
be applied to the image. Camera Raw has some defaults that you can 
modify to suit your image.

196
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
Figure 10-11: Adobe Camera Raw’s Detail tab.
 
7. Adjust Sharpening.
 
 You can modify the following parameters:
 
• Amount: This determines the amount of sharpening applied to the 
image. Zoom to 100 percent and pan to an area with detail. Press 
the Alt key while dragging the slider. When zoomed to 100 percent, 
this momentarily displays the image as black and white, which 
makes it easier to see the effects of your sharpening. For a portrait, 
I never exceed a value of 50.
 
• Radius: This determines the distance from an edge to which the 
sharpening is applied. For a portrait, I almost always leave this at 
the default setting of 1.0.
 
• Detail: This determines how much sharpening is applied to the 
details in your image, such as strands of hair, teeth, and so on. 
Zoom to 100 percent and pan to an area with details. Press the Alt 
key while dragging the slider to the right. This places an overlay 
over the image. As you increase the value, you’ll see more details 
appear. Don’t overdo this setting because you’ll also sharpen 
details like fine skin wrinkles. If you used a high ISO setting (I tell 
you about ISO in Chapter 3) when shooting the picture, drag the 
slider to 0 so you don’t increase sharpness of details like noise.
 
• Masking: This applies a mask to part of the image, which deter-
mines which areas of the image are sharpened. By default, 

197
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
sharpening is applied to the entire image, even defects such as 
digital noise. Sharpening digital noise isn’t a good thing because it 
makes the noise more readily apparent in the sharpened image. So 
you can use masking to avoid sharpening digital noise.
 
 To apply masking, zoom to 100 percent and then pan to an area of 
the image that contains details. Press Alt and drag the slider. When 
you first press Alt, you see a white overlay on the image. As you 
drag the slider to the right, you begin to see shapes. Some of the 
shapes look like digital gibberish. This is the noise. Drag the slider 
until you see details appear, such as your subject’s eyelashes or 
the strands of her hair. You’ve applied enough masking when you 
can clearly see the details and nothing else. I find a value between 
60 and 70 is perfect for portraits.
 
8. Adjust Noise Reduction settings.
 
 This determines how much noise reduction is applied to the image. The 
default settings work well for most images. However, if you’ve used a high 
ISO setting to capture the image, you may need to adjust these settings:
 
• Luminance: Zoom to 100 percent and then pan to an area with a 
lot of shadows. If you see areas with clumps of gray color, this is 
luminance noise. Drag the slider to the right until the noise starts 
to disappear. When you remove luminance noise, you also soften 
details in the image.
 
• Color: Zoom to 100 percent and pan to an area with a uniform color. 
If you see random specks of color, this is noise. Drag the color 
slider to the right until the noise disappears. Don’t overdo it or 
you’ll lose details.
 
9. Finalize your editing.
 
 At this stage, you’ve completed all of the work. Use the three buttons at 
the bottom-right corner of Adobe Camera Raw to determine what hap-
pens next.
 
• Done: Click this button to apply the settings to the image, save the 
information with the file, and exit Adobe Camera Raw. The informa-
tion that tells Camera Raw how to process the image is saved as an 
XMP file. When you next open the image in Adobe Camera Raw, the 
settings are applied to the file.
 
• Cancel: Click this button to exit Adobe Camera Raw without apply-
ing the settings to the image.
 
• Open Image: Click this button to open the image in the editor you 
specified in Step 2.
 
If you press Alt, the Cancel button becomes the Reset button. Click the 
button to erase all of your settings without leaving Adobe Camera Raw.

A Tale of Two Editing Workspaces
Your camera does a great job of capturing digital images. But like their 
film counterparts, digital images generally need a bit of work. Photoshop 
Elements is your digital darkroom. This application can do marvelous things 
for images that aren’t quite up to snuff. You can also use the application to 
enhance images and add special effects using filters. The program has so 
much to offer, I can only skim the surface in the following three chapters. 
If you want a soup-to-nuts serving of Photoshop Elements 8, consider pur-
chasing Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and Ted 
Padova (Wiley Publishing).
Photoshop Elements has two ways you can edit images. One is called the 
Quick Photo Edit. This is ideal for tasks like removing red-eye, removing a 
color cast, adjusting white balance, and sharpening an image. The Quick Fix 
is great when you need to make only minimal changes on an image. If you 
want the “Full Monty,” you use the Full Photo Edit workspace. In addition to 
the tasks just mentioned, you can add layers to your image, enhance your 
images with filters, and so on. In the upcoming sections, I show you how to 
edit an image in each workspace.
Exploring the Editing workspace
The Photoshop Elements 8 Editing workspace has lots of tools, panels, and 
so on. It also comes with a plethora of commands that do everything from 
changing the size of an image to applying filters to images. When you want to 
get creative and adventurous, the Full Photo Edit workspace is your port of 
call. The Full Photo Edit workspace (see Figure 10-12) is divided into the fol-
lowing sections:
 
✓ Title bar: Lets you sign into your Adobe account; create a new Adobe ID; 
reset panels; Undo or Redo the last step performed; open the Organizer; 
display the Photoshop Elements splash screen; and minimize, maximize, 
or close the application.
 
✓ Menu bar: Lets you access the various menu groups. Click a menu title 
to expand the group. The menu groups are as follows:
 
• File: These menu commands are used to open images, save images, 
open recent files, print files, and so on.
 
• Edit: These menu commands are used to undo or redo commands; 
cut, copy, and paste; change color settings; and so on.
 
• Image: These menu commands are used to rotate, transform, crop, 
and resize images, and so on.
 
• Enhance: These menu commands are used to fix defects in images, 
apply color corrections, adjust lighting and color, convert images 
to black and white, and so on.

199
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
• Layer: The commands in this group are used to create layers, add 
adjustment layers, merge layers, and so on.
 
• Select: The commands in this group are used to refine selections 
made with tools, select the entire document, select layers, and so on.
 
• Filter: The commands in this group are used to correct camera dis-
tortion, add artistic effects to images, stylize images, and so on.
 
• View: The commands in this menu are used to zoom in, zoom out, 
view rulers, view the grid, and so on.
 
• Window: The commands in this menu are used to display panels, 
display open images, hide panels, and so on.
 
• Help: The commands in this menu group are used to summon 
online help, view video tutorials, get support, and so on.
 
✓ Option bar: Contains settings for the tool you’re currently using. Use 
drop-down menus or text fields to vary the settings for the currently 
selected tool. At the right side of the Option bar, you find buttons to 
Edit, Create, and Share images. When you click the Create or Share 
button, the Panels bin changes to display the options you have for cre-
ating objects such as photo books, calendars; and the like; or sharing 
photos using an online album, e-mailing photos, and so on.
 
✓ Tools: This part of the workspace contains the tools you use to edit your 
images, make selections, add text, and so on.
 
✓ Project bin: Displays thumbnails of all images currently open in the 
Editing workspace.
 
✓ Panels bin: Displays the panels that you’re currently working with.
Editing an image in the Quick Fix workspace
When you need a quickie, this is the place to take your images. In the Quick 
Fix workspace, you can use automatic adjustments and then tweak them 
manually. To edit an image in the Quick Fix workspace, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer.
 
 Your most recent import is displayed. To find other images, switch the 
Date view by choosing Date View from the Display drop-down menu in 
the upper-right corner of the Organize workspace.
 
2. Select the image you want to edit.
 
3. Choose Quick Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
4. Choose an option from the View drop-down menu.
 
 I prefer to work with the Before and After (Horizontal) view mode. (See 
Figure 10-13.) This gives you an accurate representation of the changes 
being applied to your image. The Quick Fix workspace looks similar to 

200
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
the Full Edit workspace, but you have fewer tools with which to work. 
Many of the menu commands are dimmed out, which means you can 
access them only in Full Edit mode. The Panels bin is home to the Quick 
Fix options.
 
5. Implement one or all of the following quick fixes:
 
• Smart Fix: Click the Auto button to apply general corrections for 
color balance. This fix also enhances shadows and highlights, if 
needed. You can also drag the slider to manually apply Smart Fix. 
Use this option if you don’t get the desired results. You can also 
click the grid to the left of the Amount slider to reveal thumbnails 
of the image, with different amounts of Smart Fix applied. Pause 
your cursor over a thumbnail, and the image changes. Click the 
thumbnail to apply the change.
Tools
Panels bin
Figure 10-12: Navigating the Full Edit workspace.
 
• Lighting: Click the Levels Auto button to automatically adjust the 
shadows and highlights to improve the image. Click the Contrast 
Auto button to automatically improve image contrast. If the 
changes are not to your liking, you can manually adjust the lighting 

201
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
by dragging the Lighten Shadows, Darken Highlights, or Midtone 
Contrast sliders. You can click a grid to the left of each slider to 
reveal thumbnail images with different amounts of each fix applied. 
Pause your cursor over the image to see the changes on your 
image. Click the thumbnail to apply the change.
 
• Color: Click the Color Auto button to automatically adjust the color 
tones in the image. If you’re not happy with the results, drag the 
Saturation slider to the right to increase image saturation, or left to 
decrease saturation. However, when you change saturation, you’re 
changing all colors and hues. If you increase saturation, you end 
up with unrealistic skin tones. You can also change the hues in the 
image by dragging the Hue slider. Drag the slider left to changes 
the hues to a bluish color, or right to change the hues to a greenish 
color. Again, this is a global correction and not ideal for portraits.
 
If you’re new to image-editing, choose Guided Photo Edit from the Fix drop-
down menu. This opens the image in the Guided Photo Edit workspace where 
you can choose the task you want to complete from a list.
If you only need to perform a simple edit, click the Fix button to reveal but-
tons that perform tasks such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Color, and so on.

Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
Resizing and Cropping Your Portraits
Your camera has a set size and resolution for the images it captures. The 
size depends on the resolution of the camera in megapixels. You can use 
Photoshop Elements to resize your images prior to exporting them for e-mail, 
posting them on a Web site, or creating prints. To do so, you specify the 
image size and resolution. You can also crop your images to a specific aspect 
ratio, or a specific size. The following sections tell you everything you need 
to know about resizing and cropping images but were afraid to ask.
Understanding image size and resolution
Your camera has a maximum dimension at which it captures images and a set 
resolution. You can change the size and resolution using your camera menu. 
However, unless you’re using images for the Web, I recommend you capture 
images at your camera’s maximum size and resolution. The maximum size 
and resolution for my Canon G10 is 4416 x 3312 pixels with a resolution of 240 
pixels per inch (ppi). That equates to a print size of 18.4 x 13.8 inches. To get 
the maximum print size for your camera, divide the dimension in pixels by 
the resolution.
Resizing images
You can resize images to a specific size. Resizing is also known as resampling. 
You can resample images to a smaller size with no loss of fidelity. However, 
if you try to increase the size of an image, you’re asking the image-editing 
application to redraw pixels, which causes image degradation. To resize 
images, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the image you want to resize in either the Quick Fix or Full Edit 
workspace.
 
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
 
 This opens the Image Size dialog box. (See Figure 10-14.)
 
3. In the Document Size section, enter the desired resolution.
 
 You’ll get your best results on most printers if you specify a resolution of 
300 pixels per inch.
 
4. Enter the desired size in either the Width or Height text box.
 
 As long as you accept the default option to Constrain Proportions, 
Photoshop Elements supplies the other value. If you don’t accept the 
Constrain Proportions option, your image will be distorted.
 
5. Choose an option from the Resample Image drop-down list.
 
 Bicubic Sharper is always the best when you’re resampling to a smaller 
size.

203
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements resizes the image.
Figure 10-14: Resizing an image.
 
You can also change the image size by changing resolution. Deselect the 
Resample Image option and enter the desired resolution. If you enter a 
smaller resolution, the document size (print size) becomes larger. If you enter 
a higher resolution, the document size becomes smaller.
Color Correcting Images
Tricky lighting conditions fool the best digital cameras. If you’ve got a por-
trait that has a color cast, the image needs to be color corrected. For exam-
ple, if your camera didn’t get the white balance right when you photographed 
in an area that has fluorescent lighting, your subject may look a little green 
around the gills. To remove a color cast like this, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to edit, click the Fix 
button, and then click Full Photo Edit.
 
 This opens the image in the Full Photo Edit workspace.

204
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast.
 
 The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. (See Figure 10-15.)
Figure 10-15: Removing a color cast from an image.
 
3. Click an area inside the image that you know should be jet black, pure 
white, or neutral gray.
 
 Photoshop Elements removes the color cast based on the area you 
clicked. If the first click doesn’t modify the image to your satisfaction, 
click a different area. 
 
4. Click OK to remove the color cast.
 
If you prefer to do things quick and easy, you can let Photoshop Elements 
take the reins and remove the color cast on its own. Choose Enhance➪
Auto Color Correction.
Sharpening Photos
Images captured by a digital camera are a little soft. This has nothing to 
do with the camera lens, but has everything to do with the camera sensor. 
Fortunately, you can sharpen your digital images in Photoshop Elements 
using the Adjust Sharpness command. Photoshop Elements has other com-
mands to sharpen images, but the Adjust Sharpness command does a better 
job of identifying edges, which means you won’t end up sharpening noise or 
random pixels that shouldn’t be sharpened. To sharpen a photo using the 
Adjust Sharpness command, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to edit, click the Fix 
button, and then click Full Photo Edit.
 
 This opens the image in the Full Photo Edit workspace.

205
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
2. Zoom to 100 percent magnification.
 
 You can use the Zoom tool’s 1:1 button or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 
Alt + 0 to zoom to 100 percent. When you sharpen an image, you should 
always view the image at 100 percent magnification.
 
3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness.
 
 The Adjust Sharpness dialog box appears. (See Figure 10-16.)
Figure 10-16: Using the Adjust Sharpness command.
 
4. Specify the Amount value.
 
 You can use the slider to select a value, or enter the value in the text 
field. This value determines the amount of sharpening that’s applied to 
the image. As you drag the slider, the image updates in real time. If any 
halos appear on the edges, you’ve over-sharpened the image. When you 
sharpen a portrait, don’t go over the top. Your goal is to enhance the 
image, not to draw attention to skin texture and wrinkles. The value you 
use depends on your subject, the camera lens, and your personal taste. 
 
 Click the Preview check box to disable the preview of the sharpening on 
your original image, which enables you to see the unsharpened image. 
Click the check box again to see the effects of the sharpening on your 
image. 
 
5. Specify the Radius value.
 
 This value determines the distance from each edge to which the sharp-
ening is applied. If you specify too low a value, the sharpening effect will 
not be noticeable; too large a value, and halos appear around the edges.

206
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
6. Choose an option from the Remove drop-down menu.
 
 Your choices are Gaussian Blur, Lens Blur, and Motion Blur. Lens Blur is 
the best option for digital photographs. However, you can use Motion 
Blur if you moved the camera while taking the picture. When you choose 
Motion Blur, you can specify the angle by dragging a slider. Drag the 
slider until you see the sharpest image possible. Use Gaussian Blur for 
close-ups.
 
7. Click the More Refined check box.
 
 This option processes the command slower for more accurate results.
 
8.  Click OK to sharpen the image.
Cropping images
You can crop images to remove unwanted items, such as too much back-
ground or other distracting elements. You can also crop an image to a spe-
cific size and resolution. To crop an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer and choose the image you 
want to crop.
 
2. From the Fix drop-down menu, choose Full Photo Edit, or Quick Photo 
Edit.
 
 Your choice depends on how much work you need to do to the image. 
If all you want to do is crop the image and apply minimal edits, choose 
Quick Photo Edit.
 
 
3. Select the Crop tool.
 
4. Choose an option from the Aspect Ratio drop-down menu on the 
Option bar.
 
 The default option is No Restriction, which lets you crop the image to 
any aspect ratio. You can also choose to crop the image while maintain-
ing the aspect ratio (use Photo Ratio) or choose one of the preset sizes, 
such as 4 x 6. Alternatively, you can enter the desired dimensions in the 
Width and Height text fields.
 
5. Enter the desired image resolution in the Resolution field.
 
 If you’re cropping images for the Web, enter 96 or 72 pixels per inch. If 
you’re cropping an image for print, specify 300 pixels per inch, or the 
resolution specified by the printing service you’re using.
 
6. Drag inside the image to specify the crop area.
 
 The crop area is signified by a border of dotted lines and eight handles. 
(See Figure 10-17.) The handles are used to resize the area to which the 
image is cropped.

207
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Figure 10-17: Cropping an image.
 
7. Adjust the size of the crop rectangle.
 
 Drag the corner handles to resize the width and height at the same time. 
Drag the handle in the middle of the top or bottom of the crop rectangle 
to change the height, or drag the handle in the middle of the right or 
left side of the crop handle to change the width. If you’re cropping your 
image to a size or aspect ratio, dragging any handle changes the size of 
the rectangle proportionately.
 
8. Click inside the crop rectangle and drag to change its position.
 
9. When the crop rectangle is the desired size, click the green check 
mark below the lower-right corner of the rectangle to crop the image.
 
 You can also click the red circle with the diagonal slash to remove the 
crop rectangle and leave your image as is.
 
10. Save your work.
 
 When you make changes to an image, I advise you to save it with a differ-
ent filename in order to preserve the original. For more information on 
saving your work, refer to the sections “Saving Your Work” or “Saving for 
the Web” later in this chapter.

208
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
If all you need to do is crop the photo, click the Fix button and choose Crop 
from the Photo Fix options menu. This opens a dialog box with a crop rectan-
gle that you can resize. You can also choose from one of the presets.
Saving Your Work
After you edit an image, it’s time to save it. You can save your image in any 
format supported by Photoshop Elements. If you’re editing a RAW file, your 
only option is to save to a different format.
 
1. Perform the desired edits on your image.
 
2. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears. (See Figure 10-18.)
Figure 10-18: Saving your work.
 
3. Enter a filename for the image in the File Name text box.
 
 It’s advisable to give the image a different filename than the original. 
If you give the image the same filename and save it in the same folder, 

209
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
you’ll overwrite the original. If you don’t enter a filename, Photoshop 
Elements automatically adds the following to the original: _edited-1 
(for the first edit). If you don’t rename your images, I advise you to 
accept the default filename Photoshop Elements gives the image. This 
prevents overwriting the original.
 
4. Choose a folder in which to save the image from the Save In drop-
down menu.
 
 By default, Photoshop Elements saves images in the same folder as the 
original. You can save your work in any folder, or you can create a new 
folder in which to save your edited images.
 
5. Choose from the following options:
 
• Include in the Elements Organizer: Accept this default option, 
and the saved file will be included in the Photoshop Elements 
Organizer.
 
• Save in Version Set with Original: This option stacks the saved file 
with the original in the Organizer. The most recently saved image 
in the version set appears on the top of the stack. If you deselect 
this option, the edited image is saved beside the original. 
 
• Layers: If the image has layers and you save to a file format that 
supports layers, this option is selected by default. If the selected 
file format doesn’t support layers, the layers are flattened.
 
• As a Copy: If your image has layers and you deselect the option to 
save the image with layers, this option is selected by default.
 
• ICC Profile: Saves the image with the same color profile as the 
original.
 
6. Choose a format from the Save as Type drop-down menu.
 
 Photoshop Elements supports many file types. Unfortunately, a full-
blown explanation of each file type is beyond the scope of this book. 
Most online print sources prefer the JPEG format, which is what I show 
you in the upcoming steps.
 
7. Click Save.
 
 If you accept the default option to save the edited image in a version 
set with the original, a dialog box appears, telling you about version 
sets. After choosing a file format, the dialog box changes to reflect the 
options for the file format. Figure 10-19 shows the options for the JPEG 
format.
 
8. Specify the image quality in the Quality text box.
 
 JPEG is a lossy format, which means the image is compressed and infor-
mation is lost. The default image quality option is 7, which creates a 
medium-size file with good image quality. If you’re printing the image, 
choose a quality of 10 or higher.

210
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
Figure 10-19: Options for the JPEG file format.
 
9. Choose from the following format options:
 
• Baseline (“Standard”): This option works well for print and for 
the Web.
 
• Baseline Optimized: This option yields good image quality, but it 
applies a bit more compression. Choose this option when file size 
is a concern.
 
• Progressive: Choose this option for Web images. This option loads 
the image into the browser in stages. The first stage gives the 
viewer an idea of what is to come. With each stage, the image 
quality improves. When you choose this option, the Scans drop-
down menu becomes available. Choose the number of scans from 
the drop-down menu. The default option loads the image in three 
stages (scans). You can specify as many as five scans.
 
10. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements saves the image.
Saving for the Web
If you’re saving an image for e-mail or posting to a Web site, you use the Save 
for Web command. This command lets you examine the image with different 
compression settings as compared with the original. To save an image for the 
Web, follow these instructions:

211
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
1. Resize the image.
 
 When you send an image via e-mail or post an image to a Web site, image 
size and resolution are important. Your camera’s default size and resolu-
tion is way too big for e-mail or posting to a Web site. Resize the image 
to a width of 640 pixels or less, and specify a resolution of 72 or 96 pixels 
per inch.
 
2. Choose File➪Save for Web.
 
 If you don’t resize the image, a warning appears, telling you the image 
is too large for the Web. If you’ve resized the image, the Save for Web 
dialog box appears. (See Figure 10-20.)
 
3. Choose an option from the Preset drop-down menu.
 
 Your options include the GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats. The GIF format 
isn’t suited for photorealistic images, and the PNG format isn’t sup-
ported by all browsers. Therefore, choose one of the JPEG formats. JPEG 
Medium is a good option for Web and e-mail.
Figure 10-20: Saving an image for the Web.

212
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
4. If desired, tweak the Quality.
 
 Specify a lower image quality for a smaller file size. When you specify a 
lower quality, examine the image on the right side. The easiest way to 
specify image quality is to click the arrow to the right of the text box, 
which reveals the Quality slider. Drag the slider to the left to specify a 
lower image quality. When you release the slider, the data below the image 
in the right window refreshes to show the file size at the specified quality 
setting. When the image quality is no longer acceptable, drag the slider 
to the right until it improves and you’ve found the lowest possible quality 
setting for the image. The image file size and download time with a con-
nection speed of 28.8Kbps is displayed below the Web-optimized image.
 
5. If desired, choose these options:
 
• Progressive: Displays the image in stages.
 
• ICC Profile: Saves the current ICC profile with the image. When you 
save images for the Web, they should always have the sRGB color 
profile. If for any reason they don’t, choose Image➪Convert Color 
Profile➪Convert to sRGB Profile before using the Save for Web 
command.
 
• Matte: This option determines transparency for Web pages. This 
option is needed only when you’re displaying a banner with text 
and other elements on a Web site over a color background, and it 
isn’t applicable for portraits.
 
6. If desired, enter new values for Width or Height.
 
 Enter one value, and Photoshop Elements calculates the other as long 
as you have the Resize Proportionately icon (it looks like chain link) 
enabled.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 The image is saved for the Web.
Archiving Your Work
Your computer is a mechanical piece of equipment. Like a car, it will fail, and 
it will fail at the least opportune moment. If you have hundreds of images on 
your computer and your hard drive decides to self-destruct, your images are 
lost. You may be able to recover them using a data-recovery service, but why 
spend the money when you can archive your images and restore them when 
needed? You can back up your Photoshop Elements catalog to a CD, DVD, or 
hard drive by following these steps:

213
 Chapter 10: Editing with Photoshop Elements
 
1. Launch the Organizer workspace and then choose File➪Backup 
Catalog to CD, DVD, or Hard Drive.
 
 The Backup Catalog to CD, DVD, or Hard Drive dialog box appears. (See 
Figure 10-21.) Your choices are Full Backup or Incremental Backup. 
When you back up for the first time, you need to perform a full backup. 
After the initial backup, use an incremental backup. When you do an 
incremental backup, Photoshop Elements compares the source drive 
on your computer to the previous backup. New files from the catalog 
are added, and old files that have been changed are updated during the 
incremental backup.
 
2. After choosing the backup option, click Next.
 
 The Destination Settings section of the Backup Catalog Wizard appears. 
(See Figure 10-22.)
 
3. Select the destination drive from the available drives listed in the 
Select Destination Drive section.
 
 This is a list of available drives on or attached to your computer. I 
strongly suggest you back up to an external drive, CD, or DVD. If 
you back up to your computer hard drive, and it fails, the backup is 
worthless.
Figure 10-21: Specifying the backup destination.

214
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
4. In the Options section, specify the following options:
 
• Name: Enter a name for the catalog or accept the default name: My 
Catalog.
 
• Write Speed: This option is available if you back up to a DVD or 
CD drive. The maximum speed is selected by default. If desired, 
choose another option from the drop-down menu.
 
• Backup Path: This option is available if you’re backing up to a hard 
drive. You can browse for an existing folder or create a new folder.
 
• Previous Backup file: This option is available when you do an incre-
mental backup. Navigate to and select the original backup file.
 
5. Click Done.
 
 Photoshop Elements backs up the image files and the associated data to 
the specified folder.
If you ever need to restore the catalog, choose File➪Restore Catalog from CD, 
DVD, or Hard Drive. After you invoke the command, you’ll be prompted to 
locate the backup file and then specify where to restore the files.

I
f every person you photograph has a peaches-and-cream complexion, and 
you photograph all of them against a perfect background, you can go out 
and shoot more portraits instead of reading this chapter. But if you’re like 
most of us, your subjects have some subtle flaws they’d rather not see in a 
portrait. Perfectionists can spend hours retouching an image, removing every 
single imperfection they see. But people aren’t perfect. The trick is to retouch 
a portrait just enough to make your subjects look their best 
without making them look inhuman — and without spending 
hours to achieve that goal. In this chapter, I introduce you 
to the joys of retouching.
Editing Non-Destructively
When you use a Photoshop Elements tool or menu 
command, the results almost always change the 
original pixels in some way, shape, or form. For that 
matter, any tool or command used in most image-
editing program changes pixels. So what happens 
when good pixels turn terribly wrong? Well, you have 
the Undo command, but image-editing programs allow 
you only a limited number of uses of that command. Some 
image-editing applications allow you to increase the number 
of times you can use the Undo command, but this takes up system 
resources, resources you should be using to edit your images.

216
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
So, when your editing goes horribly wrong, you may end up starting from 
scratch again, which sucks up your valuable time. However, if you take advan-
tage of the tools that programs like Photoshop Elements have to offer, you 
can edit non-destructively. To edit non-destructively in Photoshop Elements 
or similar applications, you need the option to create layers. You can have 
clear layers, upon which you add text, make marks with drawing tools, and 
so on. But when you’re retouching images, you work with duplicates of the 
original layer. You do all of your editing and retouching on one or more dupli-
cate layers. If you don’t like the end results, just delete the duplicated layer, 
and you’ve still got your original layer intact.
To create a layer that’s a carbon copy of the Background layer in the 
Photoshop Elements Full Photo Edit workspace, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Layers panel, click the layer you want to duplicate.
 
 Your original image has only one layer, the Background layer, and it is 
selected by default.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 The Duplicate Layer dialog box appears. (See Figure 11-1.)
Figure 11-1: Creating a new layer.
 
3. Enter a name for the layer in the As text box.
 
 Enter a name that reflects the purpose for which you’re using the layer. 
If you’re retouching an image, Retouch is a good choice.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements creates a new layer.
 
5. To apply changes to the layer, select it by clicking it on the Layers 
panel.
 
 The selected layer is highlighted on the Layers panel. (See Figure 11-2.)

217
 Chapter 11: Retouching Your Portraits
Figure 11-2: Selecting the duplicated layer.
 
6. Click the eyeball icon to the left of a layer to hide it.
 
7. To delete a selected layer, click the Delete icon that looks like a 
trash can.
 
 Alternatively, if you prefer to work with menu commands, you can 
choose Layer➪Delete Layer.
 
8. After editing a layer to perfection, click the Lock icon on the Layers 
panel.
 
 A lock icon appears next to the layer, indicating that you can’t do any 
work on it. Click the Lock icon again to unlock the layer.
 
9. After you’ve finished editing the image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image.
 
 Use this command only after all of your edits are done. If, for any reason, 
you need to stop your work and resume at a later date, save the image 
using Photoshop Element’s native .psd format. When you save an 
image in the *.PSD format, you have access to any layer you’ve created 
when you open the document again. If you flatten the image, the layers 
are merged into the background layer. For more information on saving 
images, see Chapter 10.

218
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
If you like keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+J to duplicate the background layer 
without opening the Duplicate Layer dialog box. This creates a carbon copy 
of the original layer, with the name Layer 1. If you want to rename the layer, 
click its name on the Layers panel and then enter the desired name.
Removing the Background
Did you ever take a perfect photograph of someone in front of a less than per-
fect background? If so, you’ll be happy to know that you can extract a subject 
from a background in Photoshop Elements using the Magic Extractor. The 
command does an amazingly good job of extracting a subject from its back-
ground. To extract a subject from a background, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to edit, and then choose 
Full Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
 Photoshop Elements opens the image in the Full Photo Edit workspace.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 The Duplicate Layer dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for the layer.
 
 Extraction is a good name.
 
4. Press OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements creates a duplicate layer. If the extraction isn’t per-
fect, you still have the original image as a backup from which you can 
start anew.
 
5. Choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
 
 The Magic Extractor dialog box appears. (See Figure 11-3.)
 
6. Select the Foreground Brush tool and click inside the subject you 
want to extract from the background.
 
 When you have a complex image with many colors, such as the one 
shown here, click several times to accurately define the borders of the 
area you want to extract. If you’re working with an image with large 
dimensions, increase the Brush Size so you can see your work. The 
default size of 20 pixels barely shows up on large images.
 
7. Select the Background tool and click inside the area you want to 
remove.

 When you have an image with lots of colors, and some that are similar 
to your subject, click as many areas as possible to accurately define 
what you don’t want after the extraction. (See Figure 11-4.)
 
8. Fine-tune your work with the Point Eraser tool.
 
 The tool works like a standard eraser. Drag it over the points you need 
to erase.
 
9. Click Preview.
 
 The Magic Extractor does its thing and extracts your subject from the 
background. (See Figure 11-5.) Be patient, as this step may take some 
time.

10. Clean up the extraction using the following tools:
 
• Add to Selection: Use this tool to paint in any areas that were 
removed but need to be in the final final image. For example, if part 
of the person’s face or hair was extracted, you use this tool to add 
them back to the image.
 
• Remove from Selection: Use this tool to erase any areas that you 
don’t want in the final extraction.
 
• Smoothing Brush: Use this tool to smooth any jagged edges.

 Use the Zoom tool to zoom in on areas you need to clean up. You can 
then use the hand tool to pan to different areas of the image.
 
11. Use the following Touch Up options to fine-tune the extraction:
 
• Fill Holes: Click this button to fill any holes in the extraction.
 
• Defringe: Click this button to smooth the edges of the extraction.
 
12. Click OK.
 
 The Magic Extractor does its thing and closes.
 
13. On the Layers panel, click the eyeball icon for the Background layer.
 
 The Background layer is hidden, and you can examine the extraction. 
(See Figure 11-6.) In this case, some further work is needed because of 
the little girl’s fly-away hair.
 
14. On the Layers panel, Ctrl+click the Extraction layer.
 
 Photoshop Elements creates a selection based on the layer content. 

222
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
15. Choose Select➪Refine Edge.
 
 The Refine Edge dialog box appears. (See Figure 11-7.)
Figure 11-6: Surveying your handiwork.
 
16. Enter values for Smooth, Feather, and Contract/Expand.
 
 The values are in pixels and differ depending on the size of your image. 
Click the red chain icon to view a red overlay on the image. This shows 
you what the refined edge looks like and updates in real time as you 
change values. Your goal is to smooth the edges and decrease the size of 
the selection to remove any rough edges.
 
17. When you’re satisfied with the refined edge, click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements refines the edge.
 
18. Press Ctrl+J to create a new layer based on the selection.
 
 The new layer is slightly smaller than the extraction layer.
 
19. Click the eyeball icon on the Extraction layer.

223
 Chapter 11: Retouching Your Portraits
 
 The only visible layer is the one you created based on the selection. 
If the results are pleasing, you’re ready to replace the background as 
shown in the upcoming section. If the results aren’t acceptable, delete 
the duplicate of the extraction layer and repeat Steps 14 through 18, this 
time entering different values in Step 16.
Figure 11-7: Refining a selection edge.
Creating a Digital Background
After you extract an object from the background, you can replace the back-
ground. You can replace the background using a photo that’s the same size, 
or you can create a background in Photoshop Elements. To create a back-
ground in Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Extract a subject from its background.
 
 OK. I’m making an assumption that you read the previous section. If you 
didn’t, please read the section “Removing the Background,” which pre-
cedes this section.

224
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
2. Select the Background layer.
 
 That’s the layer with your original image. By making this selection, you 
create the digital background on top of this layer.
 
3. Click the Adjustment Layer icon (the circle that’s half gray and half 
white), and choose Solid Color.
 
 The Pick a Solid Color dialog box appears. (See Figure 11-8.)
Figure 11-8: Adding a solid color background.
 
 Alternatively, you can replace the background with a gradient, which is a 
blend of two or more colors. To replace the background with a gradient, 
choose Gradient in this step.
 
4. Select a color.
 
 You can enter values in the HSB or RGB fields, or you can drag the 
slider next to the vertical color swatch to select a hue, and then drag 
inside the square to set the saturation and brightness. Alternatively, 
you can move your cursor outside the dialog box and into the image, 
when you’ll see an eyedropper icon. Click inside the image to sample 
a color.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements adds the solid-color layer to the image. (See 
Figure 11-9.)

Retouching Your Portraits
Unless you’re photographing professional models who have had makeup 
meticulously applied by professional makeup artists, you’re going to have 
some issues with your images. If you photograph children and teenagers, 
you’ll have to deal with blemishes — a.k.a. zits. Other issues you’ll have to 
deal with are skin texture and character lines. Skin texture and character 
lines are fine if you’re photographing Clint Eastwood, but if you’re photo-
graphing your wife, or any female friend, texture and wrinkles are not a 
good thing. As if that wasn’t enough to think about, there’s also the issue 
of retouching portraits of middle-aged people and older folks. How much 
retouching do you do and still make it look real? I show you how to address 
these issues and more in the upcoming sections.
Of course it’s a good idea to discuss retouching with your subject. When a 
client hires me to photograph a portrait of them, I always discuss retouching 
after I’m finished with the photo shoot. That gives me time to observe the 

226
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
subject carefully and get to spot any potential flaws that may detract from 
the photograph. I avoid getting technical. I tell them what can be accom-
plished, and then ask them if there are any areas they’d like me to retouch. 
Softening skin
When you photograph someone with a sharp lens, you capture every subtle 
nuance of your subject, and some not so subtle nuances. When you photo-
graph a woman and your lens reveals a lot of texture, this is not a good thing. 
Many photographers have a technique for softening skin. The trick is to get 
silky looking soft skin without the Barbie Doll look. The following steps show 
you how to achieve this goal:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to edit, and then choose 
Full Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
 Photoshop Elements opens the image in the Full Photo Edit workspace.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 The Duplicate Layer dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for the layer.
 
 Skin Softening makes sense to me.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Photoshop Elements creates a new layer.
 
5. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
 
 The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears. (See Figure 11-10.)
 
6. Enter a value of 6 in the Radius text box and click OK.
 
 The blur is applied to the entire layer. However, you still want to see 
sharp details around areas like your subject’s hair, eyes, eyebrows, and 
so on. Note that this value is for a full-sized image as it comes from the 
camera. If you’re editing an image that’s 10 megapixels or less, you may 
have to use a smaller value. In a nutshell: If you don’t like the results, 
undo the step and then repeat with a different value.
 
 
7. Select the Eraser tool.
 
 That’s right; you’re going to erase the areas to which you don’t want the 
blur applied.
 
8. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the currently selected brush 
and choose a soft brush tip from the menu. (See Figure 11-11.)
 
 Soft-edged brush tips have icons that are blurry around the edges. This 
effectively blends the remaining pixels on the layer you’re working on 
with the pixels on the underlying layer instead of creating a harsh edge 
that’s a dead giveaway that you’ve edited the image.

9. Click the eyeball icon to the left of the Background layer.
 
 The Background layer is hidden from view. This makes it easier to erase 
the areas you don’t want blurred on the Skin Softening layer.
 
10.  Erase the areas you don’t want blurred.
 
 Erase the hair, eyes, eyebrows, and other details that you want to remain 
sharp. You may have to resize the brush several times while erasing. 
Remember, you can press the right bracket key (]) repeatedly to increase 
brush size, or the left bracket key repeatedly to decrease brush size.
 
11. Click the blank spot to the left of the Background layer.
 
 The Background layer is revealed. The skin looks good, but it looks like a 
plastic Barbie Doll.
 
12. Select the Skin Softening layer and change the blend mode to Darken.
 
 The skin looks soft, but realistic, and not plastic.
 
13. When you’ve finished editing the image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image.
 
 The image is flattened to a single layer and ready for saving to the 
format of your choice.
Removing blemishes
Your subjects will appreciate it if you remove any blemishes, such as pim-
ples. If you photograph adolescents, pimples are a fact of life. Photoshop 
Elements gives you two tools for removing blemishes: the Spot Healing Brush 
tool and the Healing Brush tool. The Spot Healing Brush tool samples the 
pixels surrounding the area you’re repairing. This tool is useful when you’ve 
got small areas to repair like pimples. When it comes to slightly larger areas, 
or the surrounding pixels are not similar to the area you want to repair, 
you use the Healing Brush tool. This tool gives you complete control over 
the healing process because you choose the area from which Photoshop 
Elements heals the target area. 
To give your subject a squeaky-clean complexion with the Spot Healing Brush 
tool, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to retouch.
 
2. Choose Full Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
 The retouching tools aren’t available in Quick Photo Edit mode.

229
 Chapter 11: Retouching Your Portraits
 
3. Press Ctrl+J to duplicate the Background layer.
 
 If you do your retouching on a duplicated layer and it doesn’t turn out 
as you planned, you can delete the duplicated layer and still have your 
original image intact.
 
 
4. Zoom in on the area you want to retouch.
 
 
5. Select the Spot Healing Brush tool.
 
 This tool looks like a Band Aid with a small circle beside it.
 
6. Move your cursor over the area you want to retouch, and then size the 
brush.
 
 You can change the brush size by entering a value in the Options bar, by 
pressing the right bracket key (]) repeatedly to increase the brush size, 
or by pressing the left bracket key ([) repeatedly to decrease the brush

7. Click the blemish to remove it.
 
 Photoshop Elements samples the surrounding area and uses the infor-
mation to remove the blemish. (See Figure 11-12.)

Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
To remove a blemish with the Healing Brush tool, follow these instructions:
 
1. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 in the preceding list.
 
 
2. Select the Healing Brush tool.
 
 The Healing Brush tool occupies the same space on the toolbar as the 
Spot Healing Brush tool. Click the triangle in the lower-right corner of 
the tool to reveal a fly-out menu that reveals the Spot Healing Brush tool 
and the Healing Brush tool.
 
3. Move your cursor over the area you want to retouch, and then size the 
brush.
 
4. Alt+click an area of clean skin.
 
 Sample an area of skin with the same texture as the area you’re repairing.
 
5. Click the blemish to remove it.
Enhancing your subject’s eyes
The eyes are the windows to the soul, and usually the first thing you notice 
when you look at a portrait. When I retouch a portrait, I brighten the whites 
of the eyes and apply a bit of sharpening as well. This makes the eyes stand 
out in the image. Whether your subject is a child or a senior citizen, this 
simple process almost always gives you a better portrait. To enhance your 
subject’s eyes, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to retouch.
 
2. Choose Full Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
 The tools you need to enhance the eyes are available only in Full Photo 
Edit mode.
 
3. Press Ctrl+J to duplicate the Background layer.
 
 
4. Zoom in on your subject’s eyes.
 
 
5. Select the Dodge tool.
 
 The Dodge tool is used to brighten areas.
 
6. In the Option bar, change the Exposure value to 25%.
 
 The default value, 50%, is way too bright for this task. Your goal is to 
brighten the whites, not replicate the “deer in the headlights” look.
 
7. Resize the brush if necessary.
 
 You can increase the brush size by repeatedly pressing the right bracket 
key (]), or decrease the brush size by repeatedly pressing the left 
bracket key ([).

231
 Chapter 11: Retouching Your Portraits
 
8. Click and drag inside the whites of your subject’s eyes. (See Figure 
11-13.)
 
 After brightening the whites of the eyes, you can draw further attention 
to your subject’s eyes by applying some sharpening.
Figure 11-13: Brightening the whites of your subject’s eyes.
 
9. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness.
 
 The Adjust Sharpness dialog box appears.
 
10. Enter a value of 150 in the Amount text box, as shown in Figure 11-14.
 
 You’ll see the results in the dialog box. If the sharpening looks too 
severe, reduce the amount to a value between 100 and 125. The other 
defaults for sharpening are perfect for this purpose.
 
11. Click OK to apply the sharpening.
 
 Unfortunately, the sharpening is applied to the entire image. But the fact 
that you’re doing your retouching on a layer means you can erase every-
thing on the layer but the eyes.
 
 12. Select the Eraser tool and choose a brush tip with a soft edge from the 
Brush Presets drop-down menu.

232
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
Figure 11-14: Sharpening the eyes with the Adjust Sharpness command.
 
 A brush with a soft edge blends the pixels from the layer you’re erasing with 
the pixels from the underlying layer. A brush tip with a hard edge leaves a 
harsh edge, which is a dead giveaway that the image has been edited.
 
13. Resize the brush to suit your image.
 
 You can increase the brush size by repeatedly pressing the right bracket 
key (]), or decrease the brush size by repeatedly pressing the left 
bracket key ([).
 
14. Erase everything but the eyes.
 
 This works better if you have a digital tablet and stylus.
 
15. After you finish editing the image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image.
 
 Photoshop Elements flattens the image to a single layer.
 
On the Layers panel, click the eyeball icon for the background layer. This 
momentarily hides the Background layer so you can see exactly what you’re 
erasing.
Retouching portraits of older subjects
When you photograph someone with lots of miles on the odometer, retouching 
is a touchy subject — redundancy intended. After all, nobody really expects 
someone who’s pushing 60 to look like a 20-year old. If someone looks at a 

233
 Chapter 11: Retouching Your Portraits
portrait of an older person with flawless skin and no wrinkles and then sees 
the actual person, it’s obvious that some digital hanky-panky has been applied 
to the image. The trick is to retouch the portrait enough to make it look like the 
photo was taken when the person was extremely relaxed, and extremely well 
rested. Here’s how to retouch a photo of an older person:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the image you want to edit, and then choose 
Full Photo Edit from the Fix drop-down menu.
 
 Photoshop Elements opens the image in the Full Photo Edit workspace.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 The Duplicate Layer dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a name for the layer.
 
 Retouch is a good name.
 
4. Use the Healing Brush and/or Spot Healing Brush tool to remove 
blemishes and age spots.
 
 If you don’t know how to use these tools to remove blemishes, refer to 
the section, “Removing blemishes,” earlier in this chapter.
 
5. Zoom in on the eyes.
 
 
6. Select the Healing Brush tool.
 
 
7. Alt+click an area of skin with no wrinkles that is about the same 
texture as the area around the eyes.
 
8. Resize the tool if necessary.
 
 The tool should be slightly bigger than the wrinkles you’re healing.
 
9. Click and drag across the fine wrinkles around the eyes.
 
 Drag the tool across the wrinkle in one motion. (See Figure 11-15.)
 
10. Continue healing other wrinkles and character lines.
 
 Remember to sample a new area each time, one that matches the texture 
in the area you’re repairing.
 
11. Select the Retouch layer on the Layers panel.
 
12. Reduce the layer opacity until you start to see a trace of the wrinkles.
 
 I find somewhere between 70 and 80 percent works well. (See Figure 
11-16.) Your goal is to create a believable retouching job.
 
13. After you finish editing the image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image.
 
 Photoshop Elements flattens the image to a single layer.
 
If your subject has flaws or character traits he wants you to eliminate, do this 
work on another layer and leave the layer opacity at 100 percent.

A
fter you get your photos into the computer and edit them to pixel per-
fection, it’s time to share your portraits with friends, relatives, and, of 
course, the person in the photograph. You have lots of ways to share images, 
and you can do most of them using Photoshop Elements. In fact, there are so 
many ways you can share images that I won’t be able to show you all of 
them in one chapter. But I show you the ones I think are impor-
tant. In addition, I introduce you to some third-party compa-
nies you can use to turn your portraits into wall art.
Sending Photo Mail
Sending photos via e-mail is a wonderful way to 
keep friends and relatives up to date with the 
important events in your life. Whether you’re 
shooting portraits of friends, or portraits of family 
members, you can easily share your photos by send-
ing them as Photo Mail by following these steps:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer 
workspace.
 
2. Select the photo you want to send.
 
 You can locate a photo using the Find command, or by clicking the appli-
cable keyword tag. You are assigning keywords to your photos when you 
download them, aren’t you?

236
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Portraits 
 
3. Click the Share button.
 
 The options for sharing photos appear.
 
4. Click Photo Mail.
 
 The right pane of the Organizer changes and shows the Photo Mail 
options. A thumbnail of the photo appears along with the estimated size 
and download time . (See Figure 12-1.) At this time, you can also drag 
other photos from the Organizer into the Photo Mail dialog box.
 
Figure 12-1: This photo is going to be sent via e-mail.
 
 You may be tempted to send lots of photos in one e-mail message. If you 
send more than two or three photos, the message will take a long time to 
download, especially if your recipient has a slow Internet connection.
 
5. Click Next.
 
 The Organizer refreshes and shows you additional options. (See 
Figure 12-2.)
 
6. Select a recipient from your recipient list.

237

 Photoshop Elements has a Contact Book. You can add people to your 
Contact Book by clicking the man-shaped icon to the right of the Select 
Recipients title. The Contact Book gives you the option of adding new 
contacts by importing contacts from vCard Files, Microsoft Outlook, or 
Outlook Express. The Contact Book is quite easy to use. 
 
 You can also access the Contact Book in the Organizer by choosing 
Edit➪Contact Book.
 
7. If desired, modify the message.
 
 You can delete the default message and type your own, or add to the 
default message.
 
8. After Selecting one or more recipients and modifying the message, 
click Next.
 
 The Stationery and Layouts Wizard appears, (See Figure 12-3.) The

by selecting a different background color, changing the photo size, 
changing the layout if you’re sending multiple photos, changing the font 
family and font color, changing the border style and color, and decid-
ing whether or not to include a drop shadow with the Photo Mail. (See 
Figure 12-4.)
 
12.  Click Next.
 
 The photo is handed off to your default e-mail application with the recip-
ients’ e-mail addressee(s) already inserted in the To: field, along with 
the Subject (Here are the photos that I want to share with 
you.) and message.
 
13. Click Send.

Printing from Photoshop Elements
Creating prints you can share with friends and relatives is an ideal way to 
show your prowess as a portrait photographer. Give prints to people you’ve 
photographed as a token of your appreciation for letting you take their pho-
tograph. Who knows? The person may ask you how much extra prints cost. 
If you’ve taken pictures of a family, give the family a print of the best image 
from your shoot. The family members may get excited and order other prints 
for their friends and relatives. Prints are also great for holiday greeting cards 
and the like. You can easily print your images from Photoshop Elements by 
following these steps:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer workspace.
 
2. Select the photo you want to print.
 
3. Click the Create button and choose Photo Prints.
 
 The panel refreshes to show the Photo Prints options.
 
 You can also use the Photo Print options to upload and order prints 
through Shutterfly and Kodak Gallery.
 
4. Click the Print with Local Printer button.
 
 The Prints dialog box appears. (See Figure 12-5.)
 
5. Select a printer from the Select Printer drop-down menu.

10. Decide whether you want to crop the image to fit the size and media.
 
 If you crop to fit, you lose information from the image. If you deselect this 
option, the image will be displayed in the window at its original aspect 
ratio, and it will be sized to fit the longest dimension of the print size.
 
 If you’re printing the image for a specific paper size, open the image in 
one of the edit workspaces and use the Crop tool to crop the image to 
the print size.

When you’re done, close the dialog box by clicking OK.
 
13. Click Print.
 
 Photoshop Elements sends the information to your printer, which prints 
the image.
Creating a Picture Package
Photoshop Elements has a variety of printing options. One option is to create 
a picture package. When you create a picture package, you print multiple 
copies of the same image on the same sheet of paper at different sizes. This 
option is handy when you’re creating prints for friends and relatives. They 
can choose how to use the images on the page. For example, they may frame 
one of the images, use another in a scrapbook, and use others for wallet 
inserts. To create a picture package, take these steps:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer workspace.
 
2. Select the photo you want to print.
 
 You can also select multiple photos when you create a picture package. 
The following steps assume you’re using one photo for the picture package.
 
3. Click the Create button and choose Photo Prints.
 
 The panel refreshes to show the Photo Prints options.
 
4. Click the Print Picture Package button.

Creating a Contact Sheet
The beauty of digital photography is that you can take lots of pictures, store 
them on memory cards, and download them to your computer. The curse 
of digital photography is that you can take lots of pictures, store them on 
memory cards, and download them to your computer. You end up with a 
lot of photos on your computer, and after you separate the wheat from the 
chaff, you end up with lots of images that you think are keepers. But if you’re 
going to print images from the shoot for your subject, she may not share 
the same opinion as you. Instead of printing lots of images from the shoot 
and letting your subject decide which ones to print, you can create a sheet 
with small images and let her choose the ones she likes best. This neat sam-
pler is known as a contact sheet. You can easily create a contact sheet from 
Photoshop Elements as follows:
 
1. Launch the Photoshop Elements Organizer workspace.
 
2. Select the photos you want on the contact sheet.
 
 Ctrl+click the desired photos. You can select as many photos as you want. 
Photoshop Elements prints more than one contact sheet if necessary.
 
3. Click the Create button and choose Photo Prints.
 
 The panel refreshes to show the Photo Prints options.
 
4. Click the Print with Local Printer button.
 
 The Prints dialog box appears.
 
5. Select an option from the Select Printer drop-down menu.
 
 The drop-down menu lists all printers connected to your computer and 
or the local network.

 This option crops the images to fill in a square. If you deselect this option, 
the images fill the square space using the default aspect ratio of the 
images, which leaves a white area around the smaller dimension. I almost 
always deselect this option in order to get a look at the entire image.
 
10. In the Select a Layout section, specify the following options:
 
• Columns: Click the spinner arrows to increase or decrease the 
number of columns in the contact sheet. After you make a change, 
the thumbnails in the dialog box update in real time to reflect your 
change.
 
• Show Print Options: Select this check box to reveal the following 
options: Date, which prints the current date under each image; 
Caption, which prints the image caption under each image; 
Filename, which prints the filename under each image, and 
Page Numbers, which prints the page number when you create 
a contact sheet with enough images to require multiple pages.
 
• Print X Copies of Each Image: Click the spinner arrows to print mul-
tiple copies of each contact sheet.
 
11. Click the Page Setup button.
 
 This opens a dialog box with setup options for the selected printer. 
When you’re done, close the dialog box by clicking OK.
 
12. Click the Print button.
 
 Photoshop Elements sends the information to your printer, which prints 
the contact sheets.
Using third-party papers
There are lots of companies that manufacture 
paper for printing digital images. Some of them 
are more economical than the paper available 
from your printer manufacturer, and others are 
available to create fine art prints. For example, 
there are papers with a high rag contact that 
make your images look like artwork instead of 
photos. When you print images from Photoshop 
Elements, the printer determines how much of 
each ink is laid down on the paper to create the 
resulting image. However, when you use third-
party paper (paper not manufactured by the 
company that made your printer), your printer 
has no way of knowing how much ink to lay 
down to replicate what you see on your com-
puter screen. When this is the case, you need to 
get an ICC profile for the paper and your printer. 
Many manufacturers of fine art photo paper 
(such as Ilford and Hahnemühle) have profiles 
you can download for your printer and their 
paper. They also supply instructions on where 
the profile needs to be stored on your system, 
and how to use the profile with many popular 
image-editing applications such as Photoshop 
Elements and Photoshop.

Showing Off with a Slide Show
You can create a very cool slide show using images from your Photoshop 
Elements Organizer workspace. You determine how long each slide is dis-
played, the transition between slides, and so on. To create a slide show, first 
you need to do some setup work, and then you can add some fancy tricks. 
When your slide show is all set up to your liking, you can output it for shar-
ing. The following sections cover all these tasks.
Setting up a slide show
Before you can output a slide show, you need to set some parameters for your 
slide show and select the images. It may seem like a lengthy process, but the 
results are well worth it. To set up your slide show, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the Organizer workspace.
 
2. Select the images for your slide show.
 
 To select a range of images, Click+ Shift the first image, and then 
Click + Shift the last image. The first and last images will be selected as 
well as the images in-between. To select individual images, Ctrl+Click 
each image you want to include in the slide show.
 
3. Click the Create button and then click the Slide Show button.
 
 The Slide Show Preference dialog box appears. (See Figure 12-9.) This 
dialog box appears the first time you choose to create a slide show.
 
4. Choose an option from the Static Duration drop-down menu.
 
 This option determines the duration for which each slide is displayed.
 
5. Choose an option from the Transition drop-down menu.
 
 The default option is Fade, which in my humble opinion is perfect for 
portraits. Experiment with the other options to see what’s possible. I 
advise you not to select the Random option, which creates a disjointed, 
and amateurish-looking slide show.
 
6. Choose an option from the Transition Duration drop-down menu.
 
 This option determines the amount of time it takes to transition from 
one slide to the next.
 
7. Accept the default background color of black or click the Background 
Color swatch to choose a different color. If you accept the default 
color, go to Step 9.

Figure 12-9: Setting slide show preferences.
 
 If you decide to venture beyond the “Bad in Black” background and click 
the Background Color swatch, the Photoshop Elements Color Picker is 
displayed, as shown in Figure 12-10. Drag the slider on the right to select 
the hue; click inside the well to select a color.
 
8. Click OK to apply the new background color.
 
9. Select or deselect the following check boxes:
 
• Apply Pan & Zoom to All Slides: This option causes each slide to 
move and changes the magnification. This is similar to the Ken 
Burns effect.
 
• Include Photo Captions as Text: Displays photo captions as text 
beneath each slide.
 
• Include Audio Captions as Narration: If you’ve added audio captions 
to any slide, the caption is added as audio narration.
 
• Repeat Soundtrack Until Last Slide: Repeats the soundtrack if added 
until all slides have been displayed.

249
 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Images
 
10. Next to Crop to Fit Slide, select a cropping option: Landscape Photos 
or Portrait Photos.
 
 You can crop landscape photos to fit the slide show dimensions, or crop 
portrait photos to fit the slide show dimensions.
Figure 12-10: Selecting a background color for the slide show.
 
11. Choose an option from the Preview Quality drop-down menu.
 
 The default option previews your slide show as high-quality images. If 
your computer is older, the time required to build the preview may be 
shorter if you choose a lower-quality option.
 
12. Accept the option to show the dialog box each time you create a slide 
show.
 
 This gives you the option to change slide show parameters for each show. 
Deselect this check box if you want to use the same options for all shows.
 
13. Click OK.
 
 The preferences are saved, and the Slide Show Editor appears. (See 
Figure 12-11.)
 
14. Click the Save Project button.
 
 This opens the Elements Organizer dialog box, which is self-explanatory.
 
15. Enter a name for the slide show and click Save.
 
 This step saves the project in the Photoshop Elements Organizer work-
space, which means you can edit the show at any time.

Adding pizzazz to your slide show
Now that you’ve done the preliminary setup, it’s time to add some panache 
to your slide show. In this section, I show you how to add additional media to 
the show, create title slides, and more. Here’s what you need to do:
 
✓ Add media. If desired, click the Add Media button and choose an option 
from the drop-down menu. This option enables you to add media from 
the Elements Organizer or from a folder on your computer.
 
✓ Add a blank slide. If desired, click the Add Blank Slide button. This step 
adds a blank slide after the currently selected slide. You can use a blank 
slide as an intro to your slide show.
 
✓ Add text. Click the Add Text button. The default text is displayed on 
top of the currently selected slide, and the Edit Text dialog box appears. 
Enter the desired text and click OK. The text is displayed on top of the 
slide. You can drag the text to the desired location.

251
 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Images
 
✓ Change the order of the slides. Drag a slide from the film strip at the 
bottom to change the order in which it plays. This is a quick and easy 
way to change the order of your slide show or to bring a blank title slide 
to the start of the slide show.
 
✓ Add other extra goodies. In the Extras section, you can add the follow-
ing to any slide by clicking an icon:
 
• Graphics: This option displays graphic categories below the Extras 
icons. There are several categories from which to choose. Drag and 
drop the graphic on the slide and then use the handles to resize it.
 
• Text: This option displays the letter T using several different font 
styles. Drag the desired style over a slide, which displays text 
options in the Properties panel. Change the text and modify to suit 
your slide show. The text is displayed over the slide. This is a great 
option for noting the place a photo was taken or the name of the 
person in the photo. Click and drag the text to the desired location 
within the picture. You can also change the font type, color, size and 
so on in the Properties panel, which appears below the Extras panel.
 
• Narration: This option opens a dialog box that enables you to 
record an audio narration for the slide.
 
✓ Modify the properties of a slide. In the Properties panel, you can 
change properties for the selected slide. You can change the duration 
for which the slide is displayed, the background color, and enable Pan 
& Zoom for the selected slide. If you choose the latter option, you can 
change the area to which the slide is cropped as well as its position at 
the start and end of its duration. You can’t increase the magnification of 
the either slide.
 
✓ Use the buttons beneath the slide display to preview your show.
 
 
You can change the duration for individual slide by choosing an option

Creating Wall Art
Your digital portraits get better as you practice your skills. When you get 
images you’re really proud of, you’re ready to take the next step and display 
your work as wall art. If you have a digital camera that’s capable of capturing 
images with a resolution of 8 megapixels or larger, you have the raw ingre-
dients for creating wall art. You can have your images printed by online ser-
vices such as Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com) or MPIX (www.mpix.com). 
Both services offer a wide variety of options for your digital portraits. You 
can find additional online printing services, but the aforementioned services 
create good images with a quick turnaround.
When you want to create a different statement for your digital portraits, con-
sider turning one of your portraits into a photo canvas. Photo canvasses are 
stunning and look great framed or on stretchers. When you choose to have 
your image on a canvas with stretchers, the image wraps around the stretch-
ers and stands off the wall to make an impressive display of your work. I call 
on Artistic Photo Canvas (www.artisticphotocanvas.com) when I want 
to display one of my photos as a canvas. Figure 12-13 shows canvasses dis-
played on a wall.

E
diting portraits can be a lot of fun. It can also be a serious time drain. 
Sometimes you start working on an image and just get sucked in. Before 
you know it, half an hour has passed. My motto has always been: “Why work 
harder if you can work smarter?” In this chapter, I present ten tips and tricks 
for editing your images.
Replacing a Background
If you’ve got a portrait with a boring background, like 
a clear blue sky or a plain white wall, you can easily 
remove and replace the background. If you’ve got 
an image with a solid-colored background that you 
want to replace, follow these steps in Photoshop 
Elements 8:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, 
choose File➪Open, and then navigate to the 
image you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 This creates a carbon copy of the background layer. 
Eventually, you’ll replace the contents of the background 
layer with a different color. In the interim, the background layer 
serves as a backup in case you select too much.
 
 
3. Select the Magic Wand tool.
 
4. Adjust the Tolerance setting.

258
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 The Tolerance setting determines how similar the colors must be before 
they are added to the selection. In most cases, the default setting of 32 
works well. However, if in Step 5, you select too much of the area, use 
a lower tolerance setting. For this image, experimentation showed me 
a tolerance level of 5 was perfect to select the whole background. (See 
Figure 13-1.)
Figure 13-1: Adjusting the Tolerance setting of the Magic Wand tool.
 
5. Click inside the area you want to select.
 
 In this case, you want to select the background, so click anywhere inside 
the background. After clicking inside the area, you see a flashing border 
of dashes, which some graphic artists and photographers refer to as a 
“marching army of ants.” (See Figure 13-2.)
 
6. Examine the selection carefully and make adjustments as necessary.
 
 Your goal is to select as much of the background as possible. If the tool 
selected some areas that you didn’t want selected, lower the Tolerance 
value and click inside the area of the image you want to select again. 

259
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
Figure 13-2: Making a selection with the Magic Wand tool.
 
 If the tool didn’t select enough of the background, increase the 
Tolerance value and click inside the image again. If the tool selected 
more of the image than you wanted, lower the tolerance, and then click 
inside the area you want to select again.
 
 If any of the background remains unselected, you’re going to have to add 
to the selection as shown in the following steps:
 
a. Lower the Tolerance value to about 5.
 
b. Shift+click inside the image to add that area to the selection.
 
 When you press the Shift key, you can add to the selection. 
Alternatively, you can press the Alt key and click inside an area to 
delete it from the selection. 
 
c. Continue adding to the selection until the entire background is 
included.
 
7. Choose Select➪Refine Selection.
 
 The Refine Selection dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-3.)

260
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 13-3: Refining the selection.
 
8. Adjust the Smooth, Feather, and Contract/Expand values as needed 
and click OK.
 
 This smoothes and shrinks the selection to ensure that none of the back-
ground is visible when you delete it.
 
• Smooth: This control smoothes the edge of the selection. I recom-
mend a value of 6 when you’re removing a background. 
 
• Feather: This control determines the size in pixels around the end 
of the selection that’s used to blend the selection with the adjacent 
pixels. Type 0 in this box when you’re removing a background.
 
• Contract/Expand: This control increases or decreases the size of 
the selection. When removing a background, it’s a good idea to 
shrink (contract) the selection slightly to get rid of any nearby 
pixels that may be the border. A value of -2 works well to remove a 
background.
 
9. Press the Backspace key to delete the selection.
 
 The selected pixels are transported into cyberspace, or wherever pixels 
go when they’re no longer needed.

261
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
 
 If you still see traces of the background, press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or 
Cmd+Z (Mac) to undo the deletion and then repeat Steps 7 and 8 to fur-
ther refine the selection until all traces of the background disappear.
 
10. Click the Foreground color swatch located at the bottom of the tool bar.
 
 The Select Foreground Color dialog box appears.
 
11. Select a color that complements the image and click OK to close the 
dialog box.
 
 You can select a color from the dialog box, or click inside the image to 
select a color from the photo.
 
12. On the Layers panel, click the Background layer.
 
13. Press Alt+Backspace.
 
 The background is filled with the Foreground Color. (See Figure 13-4.)
Figure 13-4: Replacing the background with a different color.

262
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can also use the Gradient tool to replace the background with a blend of 
two or more colors. A full-blown tutorial on how to use the Gradient tool is 
beyond the scope of this book. If you’re interested in learning more about the 
Gradient tool and the other features in Photoshop Elements 8, consider pur-
chasing a copy of Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier 
and Ted Padova (Wiley).
Creating a Painting Using Corel Painter 11
As far as I’m concerned, photography is an art. When you master the craft, 
you create more than pictures; you create images rich enough to make view-
ers spend a bit of time drinking it all in. The same is true when you nail a por-
trait. The viewer looks at it much longer than he would a snapshot. You’ve 
conveyed a message to the viewer, told a story. But I also believe that within 
every photographer lies a frustrated artist who would also like to create 
vibrant brush strokes on a canvas or watercolor paper. I was a dismal failure 
with watercolors, which is why I embrace photography as an art form. In 
fact, I had all but given up on traditional art until I purchased a copy of Corel 
Painter. This is a program I can use to turn my photos into something that 
looks like it’s painted with traditional art materials — you know, brushes, 
oils, canvas, and the like.
Traditional artists and photographers use Corel Painter. Photographers like 
the application because it has an auto-painting mode. You tweak the original 
image and then create a clone of it. Then you use the Auto-Painting palette to 
create your masterpiece. The Auto-Painting palette has Smart Stroke Painting 
and Smart Settings features. When you enable these, you choose a brush 
from the Smart Brushes category. Press the Play button and Corel starts 
putting brush dabs on the canvas based on the original photograph. As the 
painting progresses, the application learns the photograph and adapts the 
brush strokes to follow the lines and curves of the original photograph. If 
desired, you can touch up the painting using one of the clone brushes. With a 
portrait, you want a bit more detail around the eyes, nose, and mouth, which 
is where I typically use one or more of the clone brushes. If you’d like to turn 
some of your photo masterpieces into painterly works of art, you can down-
load a 30-day trial version of Corel Painter 11 by visiting this Web address:

Creating a Vignette
If you’ve ever seen a portrait with an oval, colored border around it, you’ve 
seen a vignette. A vignette is a wonderful way to enhance a portrait, and it’s 
easy to do. To create a vignette around an image using Photoshop Elements 8, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, choose File➪Open, and 
then navigate to the image you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 
3. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool.
 
 It shares a space on the toolbar with the Rectangular Marquee tool. If 
the Elliptical Marquee tool isn’t currently selected, click the arrow in the 
lower-right corner of the Rectangular Marquee tool to display the flyout 
menu and then select the Elliptical Marquee tool.
 
4. Click and drag inside the image to create the selection.
 
 Create a selection that surrounds your subject. You can press the 
spacebar while creating the selection to move it to a different place in 
the image.
 
5. Release the mouse button when the selection is centered over the 
image and is the desired size.
 
 A border of moving dashes indicates the selection. (See Figure 13-5.)
 
6. Choose Select➪Feather.
 
 The Feather Selection dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-6.)
 
7. Enter the desired value in the Feather Radius text box.
 
 The value depends on the resolution of your image. If your camera cap-
tures 8 to 10 megapixels, use a value of about 100 pixels. The feather 
prevents a harsh edge around the vignette.
 
8. Choose Select➪Inverse.
 
 Photoshop Elements selects the inverse of the selection.
 
9. Click the Foreground Color Swatch near the bottom of the toolbar.
 
 The Select Foreground Color dialog box appears.

10. Select the desired color.
 
 Select a color that complements the image. You can also click inside the 
image to select a color.
 
11. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
12. Press the Alt key and click the mouse inside the selection to fill it with 
the Foreground color.
 
 Voilà. Instant vignette. (See Figure 13-7.)

Adding a Border to a Portrait
The portraits you create with your digital camera are full bleed; the color 
goes all the way to the edge of the image. This is fine if you’re going to matte 
the print and frame it. But if you’re going to put the image in a frame with no 
matte, a border helps draw the viewer’s attention to your subject. You can 
quickly create a border around a portrait as follows:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, choose File➪Open, and 
then navigate to the image you want to edit.
 
 
2. Select the Crop tool.
 
3. Enter the desired values in the Width, Height, and Resolution text boxes.
 
 For example, if your final print will be 8 x 10 inches with a resolution of 
300 pixels per inch with a 1 1/2-inch border, enter a value of 6.50 for the 
width, 8.50 for the height, and 300 for the resolution.
 
4. Click and drag inside the image to define the area to which the image 
will be cropped.

266
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 A border appears, indicating the area to which the image will be 
cropped. (See Figure 13-8). Somewhere along that border, you’ll also see 
two buttons: a green check mark (accept the crop) and a red circle with 
a slash (cancel the crop). 
Figure 13-8: Cropping the image.
 
 If you didn’t get the crop perfect, you can click and drag any of the 
handles on the perimeter of the crop box to change the area. Click inside 
the crop box to move it to a different location. Or you can click the red 
circle with a slash if you change your mind about cropping the photo.
 
5. Click the green check mark to commit the change.
 
 Photoshop Elements crops the image.
 
6. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 This creates a carbon copy of the background layer.
 
7. Choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size.
 
 The Canvas Size dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-9.)

267
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
Figure 13-9: Changing the canvas size.
 
8. Select the Relative check box.
 
 This method lets you increase the canvas by a specific amount. With the 
default option, you specify the new dimensions of the canvas. When you 
choose Relative, you specify the value you want to add to the canvas. 
 
9. Enter a value in the Width and Height text fields.
 
 The value depends on the size of your image, and the size of the frame in 
which you’re going to put the image. If you’re creating a 1 1/2-inch border, 
enter a value of 1.5 in the Width and Height text boxes.
 
10. Click the Canvas Extension Color drop-down arrow and choose White.
 
 Actually, you can use any color you want. White works well with images 
that have dark backgrounds. Try black or a dark gray if your image has a 
light background.
 
11. Click OK.
 
 The image has a border. (See Figure 13-10.)

Creating a Gallery Print
When you get a portrait you’re really proud of, you can create a gallery-type 
print. A gallery-type print shows off your best work with a bit of panache. The 
image will have a white border with two black strokes to draw your viewer’s 

269
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
attention to the image. To create a gallery-type print in Photoshop Elements 
7, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, choose File➪Open, and 
then navigate to the image you want to edit.
 
 Open an image that’s about the same size as the frame you’re going to 
mount the finished image in. 
 
2. Determine the size of the border.
 
 You need enough room to add two strokes and some text. For an 8 x 
10-inch image, a 1 1/2-inch border is perfect. When you’re working with a 
larger image, you can have a bigger border and larger text.
 
 
3. Select the Crop tool.
 
4. Enter the desired value in the Width, Height, and Resolution text boxes.
 
 For an 8 x 10-inch image with a resolution of 300 pixels per inch, enter a 
value of 6.50 for the width, 8.50 for the height, and 300 for the resolution.
 
5. Click and drag inside the image to define the area to which the image 
will be cropped.
 
 A border appears, indicating the area to which the image will be cropped. 
Somewhere along that border, you’ll also see two buttons: a green check 
mark (accept the crop) and a red circle with a slash (cancel the crop). 
 
 If you didn’t get the crop perfect, you can click and drag any of the 
handles on the perimeter of the crop box to change the area. Click inside 
the crop box to move it to a different location. Or you can click the red 
circle with a slash if you change your mind about cropping the photo.
 
6. Click the green check mark to commit the change.
 
 Photoshop Elements crops the image.
 
7. Choose Select➪Select All.
 
 The image is surrounded by moving dashes to indicate your selection.
 
8. Choose Edit➪Stroke Outline (Selection).
 
 The Stroke dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-11.)
 
9. Accept the default color of black.
 
 If you’ve been experimenting with stroking selections and have changed 
the stroke color, click the current color swatch to open the Select Stroke 
Color dialog box and choose black.
 
10. Click the Inside radio button.
 
 The stroke appears inside the selection.
 
11. Click OK.
 
 A 1-pixel stroke appears around the selection.

270
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 13-11: Stroking a selection.
 
12. Choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size.
 
 The Canvas Size dialog box appears.
 
13. Select the Relative check box. Then click the drop-down arrow to the 
right of Inches and choose Pixels as the unit of measure.
 
14. Enter a value of 20 in the Width and Height text boxes.
 
 This is perfect for an 8 x 10-inch image. If you’re working with larger 
images, experiment with larger values. For example, 40 to 50 pixels is 
perfect for a 16 x 20-inch image.
 
15. Accept the default extension color of White and click OK.
 
 You have a small white border around the image.
 
16. Repeat Steps 6 through 10 to add another 1-pixel stroke to your image.
 
17. Choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size.
 
 The Canvas Size dialog box appears.
 
18. Deselect the Relative check box if it’s already checked.
 
 By default this check box is not selected. However, if you used the 
Relative method of adding to the canvas on a previous image, it is selected 
the next time you open the dialog box. When you deselect the check box, 
the current dimensions of the canvas are displayed in the dialog box.

271
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
 
19. Enter the final dimensions of your print in the Width and Height text 
boxes, choose White for the canvas extension color, and then click OK.
 
 You’ve got a nice white border around the image with two strokes to 
draw attention to the portrait. (See Figure 13-12.)

If desired, you can use the Text tool to create a title for the image and add 
your name as the artist. Unfortunately, a tutorial on using the Text tool is 
beyond the scope of this book. For detailed instructions on using the Text 
tool, refer to Photoshop Elements 8 For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and 
Ted Padova (Wiley).
Converting an Image to Black and White
If you like the rich tones of a great black-and-white image, you can get similar 
results with your portraits in Photoshop Elements. It’s quick and easy. The 
results will amaze your friends and your subject. To create a black-and-white 
image in Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, choose File➪Open, and 
then navigate to the image you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Convert to Black and White.
 
 The Convert to Black and White dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-13.)
Figure 13-13: Choosing the options for a black-and-white conversion.

273
 Chapter 13: Ten Editing Tips and Tricks
 
3. Choose a style from the left column.
 
 This is a book on portrait photography, so humor me and choose Portrait.
 
4. To adjust the look, drag the sliders in the Adjustment Intensity area.
 
 These sliders adjust the mix of red, green, and blue, plus the contrast. 
You’re converting an image to black and white, but you still have three 
color channels to work with. Each slider adjusts how much that color 
channel affects the mix of the final image. The Contrast slider controls 
the amount of contrast in the resulting conversion. The Red slider has 
the greatest affect on skin tones. Black-and-white photographs are highly 
subjective. Experiment with the sliders and presets until you get some-
thing you like.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The image is converted to black and white. (See Figure 13-14.)
Figure 13-14: Converting an image to black and white.

274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Creating a Sepia-Toned Image
In the old days, photographers would add tone to a black-and-white image 
while developing it to make it look more colorful. The tone was like a wash of 
solid color over the black-and-white image. A sepia-toned image was a light 
beige wash over the image. You can do the same thing to your digital images, 
without nasty chemicals, by following these steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in 
Editing mode, choose File➪
Open, and then navigate to the 
image you want to edit.
 
2. Convert the image to black 
and white as outlined in the 
“Converting an Image to Black 
and White” section of this 
chapter.
 
3. Click the Adjustment Layer 
icon at the bottom of the 
Layers panel, and then choose 
Photo Filter.
 
 This opens the Photo Filter 
panel in the panel dock. (See 
Figure 13-15.)
 
4. Choose Sepia from the drop-
down menu and then click OK.
 
 You’ve got a nice, sepia-tone 
image. (See Figure 13-16.) If the 
sepia effect isn’t strong enough, 
double-click the gear icon in the 
Adjustment layer. This opens 
the Photo Filter panel again. 
Drag the Density slider until you 
get the effect you want.

Simulating a Hand-Tinted Image
Do you remember the hand-painted images that were all the rage in the 
1940s? If you’re not old enough to remember, artists would take a black-
and-white image and hand tint it. It was a lot of work, and cost quite a bit of 
money at the time. You can achieve the same effect in Photoshop Elements 
without breaking a sweat by following these steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements in Editing mode, choose File➪Open, and 
then navigate to the image you want to edit.
 
2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
 
 This creates a carbon copy of the background layer.

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Follow the steps to convert the duplicated layer to black and white, 
as shown in the “Converting an Image to Black and White” section of 
this chapter.
 
4. On the Layers panel, select the layer on which you performed the 
black-and-white conversion.
 
5. Move your cursor over the Opacity title until you see a finger with 
arrows pointing in both directions.
 
 This is the infamous Photoshop Scrubby Slider. (See Figure 13-17.)
Scrubby Slider
 
Figure 13-17: Lowering layer opacity.
 
6. Drag left to lower the opacity of the layer.
 
 As you drag the slider left, you begin to see some of the color from the 
underlying layer. The exact value is a matter of personal preference. I 
find that somewhere around 60 percent gives you pleasing results. 
(See Figure 13-18.)

Using a Digital Tablet and Stylus
A digital tablet and stylus (an electronic drawing device and tool) give you ulti-
mate control when making selections in any image-editing program. Trying to 
make a selection with a mouse is like trying to use a sledge hammer to drive 
home a finishing nail. After connecting the tablet to your computer via a USB 
port, you use the stylus to make selections, draw lines, or do anything else 
you previously did with a mouse, but with much greater accuracy. After all, a 
pencil or crayon was the first thing you used to make marks on paper when 
you were a kid. The stylus feels very natural in your hand, and using it soon 
becomes second nature. You may be able to purchase a tablet and stylus 

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
from your local office supply store or a national chain like Best Buy. You can 
purchase a tablet and stylus online as well. The preferred tablet of many 
photographers is made by Wacom (www.wacom.com), a company that offers 
several different lines of tablets. If you’re just getting your feet wet, try one of 
the tablets in Wacom’s Bamboo line. (See Figure 13-19.)
Figure 13-19: Gain control over your work using a tablet and stylus.
Editing Your Photos Online
Adobe has created an online photography portal where you can edit, share, 
and display your photos online. If you own Photoshop Elements 7 and Adobe 
Premier Elements 7, membership at Photoshop.com is absolutely free. With a 
basic free membership, you can store up to 2GB of photos and video online.
After you create an account at Photoshop.com, you can upload your images 
and organize them in folders. After uploading a photo, you can edit it online. 
Figure 13-20 shows a photo being edited at Photoshop.com. Editing comes in 
three flavors: Basic, which includes options like cropping, resizing, removing 
dreaded red-eye, and so on; Adjustments, which enables you to adjust white 
balance, sharpen images, add fill light, and so on; Advanced, which gives you 
options like adjusting saturation, converting the image to black and white, 
and so on.

the excitement and story of their life with a portrait, you’ve joined the ranks 
of serious portrait photographers. After you master the basics, 
it’s time to spread your wings and learn some tips and tricks 
to improve your portrait photography. In this chapter, I 
show you ten techniques to improve your photography, 
develop your style, improvise, and so on.
Developing Your Style
Photographers are attracted to different subjects 
and do things in different ways. Casual photogra-
phers tend to produce similar images, but serious 
photographers like to do things differently. When you 
seriously explore the world of portrait photography, 
you have a tendency to look at your subjects differently. 
You experiment with different lenses and vantage points, 
different lighting, and so on. For example, instead of using 
window light to illuminate your subject, use a couple of candles to 
create a moody portrait.

282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The key to developing your own style is to study the work of the masters. 
Study images on portrait photographer Web sites, in magazines, and in books. 
When you see an image you like, look at the credit for the photographer’s 
name and visit his Web site, if he has one. You can also go to your favorite 
search engine and type the photographer’s name in the search text box. 
Google is a great site for finding images from your favorite photographer. 
For example, enter the phrase “Annie Leibovitz photographs” in the Google 
search text box. The first result that shows up is Image results for Annie 
Leibovitz photographs. Click the link to find a treasure trove of her work.
When you find an image you like, try to figure out how the photographer 
achieved the look. Was it done in-camera or in an image-editing program? 
When I look at great photographs, I’m inspired to go out and take pictures of 
my favorite subject in my favorite setting. I use what I learn from examining 
other photographs but put my own spin on it.
Creating a Self-Portrait
If you have a digital camera with a monitor that can be swiveled toward you, 
creating a digital self-portrait is a breeze. Mount the camera on a tripod, 
adjust the tripod to the desired height — high enough to take a picture of 
your head and shoulders — and then swivel the LCD monitor to the area in 
which you’ll be standing when the shutter opens. Enable your camera self-
timer, press the shutter, and walk into position. You’ll see yourself in the 
LCD monitor and be able to fine-tune your position and pose while the timer 
counts down.
If you don’t have a swiveling monitor, you can still capture your own self-
portrait. Mount the camera on a tripod, adjust the height of the tripod, and 
start the self-timer. After the camera captures the picture, review it on the 
LCD monitor to make sure that you weren’t too close or far away from the 
camera. If you didn’t get the shot you envisioned, set the self-timer and play 
it again, Sam.
Creating Makeshift Reflectors
Many professional photographers carry reflectors with them. You use a reflec-
tor to bounce light back into shadow areas of your subject’s face. But what do 
you do if you don’t have a reflector? Or you do have one, but it’s at home in 
a closet? Improvise! Here are a couple of things you can use to bounce light 
into the shadows:

283
 Chapter 14: Ten Photography Tips and Tricks
 
✓ A windshield sunshade: These devices are very handy because 
they’re wide (as wide as the inside of a windshield) and very reflec-
tive. They’re typically silver on one side and gold on the other. Have 
a friend hold the sunshade below your subject and angle it until light 
bounces into the shadows. You can direct your friend while you com-
pose the scene through your viewfinder or LCD monitor. Use the silver 
side to bounce neutral-colored light into the shadows, or use the gold 
side to bounce warm light into the shadows.
 
✓ A white shirt: Ask a friend with a white shirt to move toward your sub-
ject, but out of frame. Have him move around until you see the shadows 
start to brighten.
 
✓ A white sheet or blanket: Have a friend place a white sheet on the 
ground near your subject in a position where it will bounce light back 
into the shadows.
Steadying the Camera without a Tripod
It’s dusk. The billowing clouds are tinted in 20 hues ranging from purple 
to sky blue–pink. You have all the ingredients for a great shot except your 
tripod, which is in your closet gathering dust. Don’t you just hate it when that 
happens? I know I do. But with a bit of ingenuity, you can still get a great shot. 
Here are some ways you can steady your camera without a tripod:
 
✓ Place the camera near the edge of a table. If you can see the tabletop in 
the viewfinder or LCD monitor, move the camera closer to the edge.
 
✓ Hold the camera against a wall. Use this technique when you rotate the 
camera 90 degrees (Portrait mode).
 
✓ Lean against a wall and spread your legs slightly. This is known as “the 
human tripod.” Press the shutter gently after you exhale.
 
✓ Carry a small bean bag in your camera bag. Place your camera on the 
bean bag and move it to achieve the desired composition. You can pur-
chase bean bags at your local camera store.
 
✓ Carry a baggie filled with uncooked rice in your camera bag. (Cooked 
rice is messy and will spoil.) Place your camera on the bag and move it 
until you achieve the desired composition.
In addition to using one of these techniques, use your camera self-timer. This 
gives the camera a chance to stabilize from any vibration that occurs when 
you press the shutter button. These techniques are also great when you’re on 
vacation and don’t have the room to carry a tripod in your baggage.

Creating a Homemade Soft-Focus Filter
Soft-focus filters are expensive, but you can create a homemade soft-focus 
filter. Buy an inexpensive skylight filter to fit your lens. Smear the outer por-
tion of the lens with petroleum jelly. Apply more jelly to the outer edges of 
the filter but leave the middle portion clear. This gives you more diffusion at 
the edges of the image, while the center is relatively sharp. After you use this 
technique, you can either clean the filter or store it in a plastic bag. It’s also 
a good idea to carry some disposable wipes in your camera bag so you can 
clean the goop off your hands after you create your homemade filter.
For a more permanent soft-focus filter, purchase an inexpensive skylight filter 
to fit your lens. Buy a bottle of clear, nonyellowing nail polish and paint it 
on the filter. The dry nail polish will diffuse the light enough to create a soft 
focus look that’s very flattering for portraits. (See Figure 14-1.)
Figure 14-1: Use a homemade soft focus filter for flattering portraits.

285
 Chapter 14: Ten Photography Tips and Tricks
Using a Neutral-density Filter
When you want to limit the depth of field in an image, you choose a large 
aperture (low f-stop number). However, if you’re photographing in bright 
light, with many cameras, a large aperture lets too much light into the sensor, 
which overexposes the image. A workaround is to use a neutral-density filter 
to reduce the amount of light that reaches the sensor, without changing the 
color of the light. On a digital SLR, you screw the neutral-density filter into 
the threads at the end of your lens. For a point-and-shoot camera, you may 
have a menu option to enable a neutral-density filter.
Neutral-density filters come in varying strengths, and the stronger filters 
greatly reduce the amount of light that reaches the sensor. An ND.3 
neutral-density filter requires increasing the exposure by one stop, an 
ND.6 neutral-density filter requires increasing the exposure by two stops, 
and an ND.9 neutral-density filter requires increasing the exposure by 
three stops.
Using Second Curtain Shutter Sync
When you use flash to illuminate a picture, the flash generally fires when 
the shutter opens. This is all well and good when you shoot at a relatively 
fast shutter speed. When you shoot at a slow shutter speed and use flash to 
augment the natural light, though, there will be motion trails in the picture 
caused by the movement of your subjects while the shutter is open. You’ll 
also have a crisp rendition of your subject(s) because of the speed of the 
flash froze the motion. When the flash fires when the shutter opens, the 
motion trails move away from the subject, which looks unnatural. If your 
camera has the option to fire the flash just before the shutter closes, the 
motion trails will move toward your subject, which creates a more natural-
looking image.
Creating a Digital Double Exposure
You can create an artsy-fartsy double-exposure portrait in low light. Set your 
camera to Aperture Priority mode and choose a small aperture (large f-stop 
number). Your goal is to have the shutter open for an extended period of 
time. Set the self-timer and walk into the frame. After the timer counts down, 
the shutter opens. Move into the frame and hold your position for a few sec-
onds, and then move to another part of the frame. Hold your position until 
the shutter closes. This technique works well when the shutter is open for 15 
to 20 seconds. Figure 14-2 shows a self-portrait of your fearless author that 
was taken using this technique.

Figure 14-2: Creating a double exposure.
Calibrating Your Monitor
When you make decisions regarding white balance, color casts, and other 
color issues with your images, you rely upon what you see on your monitor. 
However, your monitor changes over time, which can result in a slight color 
shift. So when you still rely on the monitor to accurately portray red, green, 
and blue in your photos — and then you print the images, or send them to 
an online printer — the resulting print doesn’t faithfully render what was 

287
 Chapter 14: Ten Photography Tips and Tricks
displayed on the monitor. That’s because your monitor isn’t accurately repro-
ducing color and needs to be calibrated. When your monitor is calibrated the 
color values you choose in an application like Photoshop Elements match 
what you see in the real world. For example, if you choose pure red as a color 
for text in Photoshop Elements, the color on the monitor will match what 
your printer produces. Yup, another case of “What you see is what you get.”
Many products are on the market for calibrating monitors. When you cali-
brate a monitor, you start the calibration software and then attach a device 
called a colorimeter to your screen. The software analyzes your monitor and 
compares the colors it generates against the accepted standards for red, 
green, and blue as stored with the software. After the software does its thing, 
it creates a profile, which is software that you use to get your monitor to 
accurately represent color.
 
When you calibrate your monitor, use the same lighting conditions that you 
normally work in. After the initial calibration, you should recalibrate your 
monitor every two or three months to compensate for changes as your moni-
tor ages. One popular monitor calibration kit is Huey, manufactured by 
Pantone. (See Figure 14-3.) As of this writing, the Huey retails for about $90.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Keep It Clean
You have a great digital SLR and a bag full of great lenses, or a top notch 
point-and-shoot camera, but your images leave a little to be desired. Great 
equipment needs to be kept in tip-top shape. If you’re not cleaning your 
equipment on a regular basis, do so to get images with greater clarity.
Unless you have a digital SLR that shakes the sensor to dislodge dust when 
you power up the camera, sensor dust is a fact of life. The best way to keep 
the inside of your camera clean is to invest in a good blower. Several blowers 
are on the market whose names include the generic keywords hurricane or 
rocket. In fact, even if you do have an all-singing, all-dancing, shake and bake 
sensor cleaner, you should still manually clean your sensor every now and 
again. Refer to your camera manual for instructions on how to manually clean 
your monitor.
The Giottos Rocket Blaster is shown in Figure 14-4. A good blower is made 
of natural rubber and features a small opening at the tip that enables you to 
direct a strong current of air with pinpoint accuracy. To clean the sensor, take 
the lens off the camera, and then choose the sensor cleaning option from 
your camera menu. This flips up the mirror, giving you access to the sensor. 
Squeeze the blower bulb several times to send a rush of air to the sensor 
that hopefully dislodges the dust and sends it floating to the ground. I always 
point the camera down when cleaning the sensor, which lets the dust drop 
from the camera after it’s dislodged.
 
Never touch the sensor with the blower. And never use a blower with a CO2 
cartridge because those cartridges contain propellants that can foul your 
sensor.
 
To minimize the chances of getting dust on your sensor, always power-off the 
camera when changing lenses. When the camera is on, the sensor has an 
electrical charge that acts like a dust magnet. If you’re taking pictures out-
doors in a dusty environment or on a windy day, change lenses in your car or 
in a nearby building.
You can buy more-aggressive products available for cleaning digital SLR 
sensors. However, if your sensor is extremely dirty, I recommend having it 
cleaned by a professional. Your local camera store may offer this service.
You also need to keep your lenses clean. If a lens has smudges, fingerprints, 
or a fine coating of dust and pollutants, your pictures won’t be crystal clear. 
Use a brush with fine hairs to dislodge any particles of dust and then gently 
rub a microfiber cloth over the lens. Make sure you purchase a good quality 
microfiber cloth that’s designed to clean precision optics. Microfiber is 10 
times thinner than silk and 100 times thinner than a human hair.

I’ve purchased several lens cloths from Photosilk (www.photosilk.com). 
Photosilk’s cloths do an excellent job of keeping my lenses clean. (The cloths 
have a photo imprinted on one side, and you can even order Photosilks with 
your own photographs printed on them. I’ve ordered several with my com-
pany logo emblazoned on the microfiber.) Another option is to purchase a 
camera-cleaning kit at your favorite camera retailer that comes with a blower, 
lens cleaning cloth, lens cleaning solution, and lens swabs. (See Figure 14-5.)
And don’t forget to be on the lookout for grime on your camera body. Just 
gently rub a damp nonabrasive cloth over the grime. Never use a solvent on 
your camera body because it may damage the material. If you use your camera 
in a salty environment (such as the beach), thoroughly soak a cloth with 
fresh water and then wring it until it’s almost dry. Gently rub the slightly 
damp cloth over the camera body and lens.

camera store.
I always inspect my equipment before a shoot. This is also when I clean the 
lenses I’ll be using on the shoot. I also frequently do a test to make sure I’m 
not getting a dust buildup on the sensor. I take a photograph of a clear blue 
sky with the lens focused to its closest setting. When I open the image in 
Photoshop or Lightroom, the dust is readily visible as small black specks.

Ten Resources for Portrait 
Photographers
In This Chapter

▶ Researching a seller’s reputation
▶ Getting gear on eBay
▶ Sharing photos online
▶ Creating photo books
▶ Finding photo-editing instructions
T
here are thousands of online resources for photographers. 
To explore each and every one would require a book as 
thick and heavy as a doorstop. There’s a lot of good infor-
mation about digital photography online, but there’s a 
lot of junk, too. In this chapter, I try to separate the 
wheat from the chaff and present what I think are ten 
valuable resources for photographers.
Shopping ’Til You Drop 
at B&H Photo
There are hundreds of online retailers of photography 
equipment. However, if you want to get expert advice, 
quality equipment, great selection, and competitive prices, 
check out B&H Photo (www.bhphoto.com). B&H Photo is 
located in New York City, and I’m quite sure if I ever visited the store 
in person, I’d be like a kid in a candy store. I’ve talked to photographer friends 
who have visited the store, and they describe it with one word: awesome. 

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
I think their Web site is equally awesome. (See Figure 15-1.) They also have 
a toll-free number you can call for information about products and placing 
orders. The sales representatives at B&H know the equipment like the back of 
their hands, and they don’t try to sell you something you don’t need.
Figure 15-1: B&H Photo’s online superstore.
Checking Out Online Retailers
There are lots of reputable online retailers, and there are some that will try 
to sell you the moon. There are also online retailers that lure you in with a 
low price and then attempt to sell you extra stuff that actually comes with 
the camera for free. For example, a friend of mine responded to a cheap 
price from an online retailer. When he attempted to place the order, he was 
informed that the battery was an extra $100, when in fact it is included with 
the camera. The extra $100 brought the price in line with the reputable 
retailers. To avoid bait and switch and other unethical actions, visit www.
resellerratings.com . Enter the name of the retailer and you’ll see 
reviews from people who have purchased from them. The following image 
shows the rating for B&H Photo, which is as close to perfect as you can get. 
Remember that if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. When in 
doubt, check out a retailer at ResellerRatings.com.

Buying and Selling Stuff on eBay
Technology changes very quickly these days. If you’re the type of photogra-
pher who has to have the latest and greatest gear, you’ve got to find a place 
to sell your old stuff. The ideal solution for selling anything that’s technical in 
nature is eBay. You might call this Web site the world’s largest online garage 
sale. When I was considering purchasing my current digital camera, I wanted 
to pay cash for the camera instead of charging it. I rummaged through my 
closets and found some technology I wasn’t using that was still in demand. I 
put it up for auction on eBay. After one week of auctions, I had more than 70 
percent of the purchase price of the camera. After buying the new camera, I 
auctioned off my old one. The net proceeds from my sales paid for the new 
camera and then some.
eBay even has free software for sellers. You can download an application 
called Turbo Lister from the following URL: http://pages.ebay.com/
turbo_lister/index.html. Turbo Lister is a desktop application that 
enables you to create a listing at your leisure and upload it to eBay when 
you’re done.

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The trick to selling stuff on eBay is great photos and good descriptions. Make 
sure you don’t have any typos in your listing. Before selling an item on eBay, do 
a search for the item and see how other people have described the item you’re 
selling. You may also be able to get some information from the manufacturer’s 
Web site. The following image shows a listing for a lens I just sold on eBay. I 
included several photos of the lens in the listing so that potential bidders could 
see the condition of the equipment. I also answered all questions promptly. 
Notice that I have 100 percent positive feedback for 192 transactions.
Figure 15-3: An eBay listing.
In addition to selling equipment on eBay, you can also find some great deals 
on used photography equipment. Enter the item you’re looking for in the 
eBay search text field, and you’ll see the current listings. eBay is not a buyer-
beware Web site. The site has instituted a feedback system. Buyers can give 
feedback on any transaction. When you’re considering bidding on a piece of 
equipment at eBay, check out the buyer’s Feedback Rating. If he has a rating 
close to 100 percent, and 40 or 50 recent transactions, you can rest assured 
that he’s not selling junk and is carefully packing the merchandise as well as 
shipping it promptly.

Sharing Your Photos on Flickr
If you don’t know how to create a Web site, or don’t have the inclination to 
create a Web site, you can still display your work online. There are several 
Web sites you can use to show your work online. Flickr (www.flickr.com) 
seems to be one of the most popular. After you set up an account at Flickr, 
you can upload your photos. You can also join one or more Flickr groups, 
which are communities of photographers who have interests in specific 
photo subjects or styles. Flickr is a great way to get feedback on your work 
from site visitors and other photographers. With a free account, you can 
upload two videos (90 seconds in duration with a maximum of a 500MB file 
size) and 100MB of photos with a maximum file size of 10MB per photo, each 
month. (With a paid account, you can upload much more.) If you resize your 
photos to be Web friendly in an application like Photoshop Elements, you 
can upload a lot of photos each month. The following image shows the Flickr 
photo stream of an avid photographer.

Creating Photo Books at Blurb
If you’d like to see your work in a custom photo book, you can make this a real-
ity by visiting Blurb (www.blurb.com). Blurb is a popular online portal for cre-
ating and selling photo books. You can create a great looking photo book using 
Blurb’s free BookSmart software, which you can download for free from this 
URL: www.blurb.com/make/booksmart. After you create your book, you 
can upload the photos to Blurb directly from the BookSmart software. You can 
also create a custom book in an application like Adobe InDesign and upload it 
as a PDF. After you upload the book, you have 14 days to place an order for it. 
Blurb offers hardcover and soft cover books in the following sizes: 7 x 7 inches, 
10 x 8 inches, 12 x 12 inches, and 13 x 11 inches. You can also upgrade to pre-
mium paper. The minimum number of pages is 20, and the maximum number 
of pages you can put in a book is 440. You can put multiple photos on a page 
using BookSmart templates or using your own software.
You can also choose the option to make your book public after ordering one 
copy. When you make a book available to the public, you can specify the sell-
ing price. Figure 15-5 shows a book I created from photos I took at a classic 
car show. Quite a few copies of this book have been ordered online. When 
your book sells, Blurb sends you the difference between your selling price 
and their established price minus a small handling fee.

Finding Inspiration at Photo.net
Sometimes you need to recharge the batteries and get a little inspiration 
before photographing your next subject. When I need a creative spark, I look 
no further than Photo.net. This Web site features the work of many photog-
raphers. You’ll find varying degrees of talent among the photographers who 
post images at this site. A safe bet is to go to the home page and view some of 
the Daily Photo Sampling From Our Member’s Work thumbnails. (See Figure 
15-6.) When you click a thumbnail, you see a larger image. Alternatively, you 
can enter a phrase like portrait in the search box and peruse the results. 
 
There are some tasteful artistic nudes on this Web site. If you’re offended by 
artistic photos of the human body, don’t visit this Web site.
Figure 15-6: Recharge your creative batteries at Photo.net.
Researching Digital Cameras at 
Digital Photography Review
If you’re ready to buy your first digital camera, want to buy a second camera, 
or decide to upgrade to a better camera, it’s a good idea to do as much 
research as possible. I always begin my search by visiting manufacturers’ 

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Web sites. Sometimes, I’ll hear about a new camera that piques my curiosity. 
Before I plunk down my hard-earned cash on any camera, I always go to www.
dpreview.com to see what they have to say about the camera. At this Web 
site, you’ll find authoritative reviews on many of the new cameras. If you’re 
surfing eBay for a used camera and you find an interesting older model, you 
may find a review of that camera at Digital Photography Review as well. 
Figure 15-7 shows a review of one of Nikon’s new cameras. Notice the drop-
down menu above the camera image. There are a total of 35 pages of infor-
mation for this camera, with sample images. If you want to cut to the chase, 
select Conclusion from the drop-down menu and you can read the pros and 
cons as noted by the reviewer.

Getting Quality Prints at Mpix
Looking at pictures on a computer monitor or a Web site is all well and 
good, but when you get a great portrait, you should display your work in a 
proper frame on your wall, or your subject’s wall. If you want great prints 
at a reasonable price, check out Mpix (www.mpix.com). This online printer 

299
 Chapter 15: Ten Resources for Portrait Photographers
offers high-quality prints in a wide variety of sizes, and other goodies such 
as custom frames and greeting cards. They offer three different papers. Print 
sizes start at 1.75 x 2.5 inches and go up to a whopping 24 x 36 inches. When 
you’ve got an image that you want to display on a wall, or print for a friend or 
relative, visit www.mpix.com.
Finding Tutorials at YouTube
YouTube is a video-sharing Web site. In the early days, the quality of the 
videos and the subject matter was definitely amateurish. However, YouTube 
has come a long way since its inception. Now you can find high-quality videos 
on a wide range of topics, including digital photography. The Web site is 
absolutely free for viewers and those who want to upload their own videos. 
Visit the site and type a phrase like portrait photography in the search text 
box. In a few seconds, you’ll see a list of videos on the topic. (See Figure 
15-8.) Click the thumbnail to view the video.

Viewing Tutorials at Adobe TV
In addition to creating two of the best image-editing applications on the 
planet — Photoshop and Photoshop Elements — Adobe also provides a 
wealth of resources. At their main Web site (www.adobe.com), you can find 
support for any Adobe product. You can search their knowledge base for 
answers to a question, post a question in a forum, and so on. Adobe also has 
a subdomain that is chock full of videos about their products. Visit http://
tv.adobe.com and you’ll find videos from Adobe evangelists such as 
Julieanne Kost on a wide variety of topics pertaining to Adobe software. You 
can also search for information by entering a phrase in the search text box. 
Figure 15-9 shows the results for the search term photoshop elements. Visit 
this site often. New videos are posted on a regular basis.
