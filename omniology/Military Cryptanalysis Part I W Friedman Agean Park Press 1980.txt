1. Scope of this text.+. 
It is assumed that the student has studied the two preceding 
texts written by the same author and forming part of this series, viz, Elementary Military 
Cryp- 
tography, and Advanced Military 
Cryptography. 
These texts deal exclusively with cryptography 
as defined therein; that is, with the various types of ciphers and codes, their principles of con- 
struction, and their employment in cryptographing and decryptographing messages. Particular 
emphasis was placed upon such means and methods as are practicable for military usage. It is 
also assumed that the student has firmly in mind the technically precise, special nomenclature 
employed in those texts, for the terms and definitions therein will all be used in the present text, 
with essentially the same significances. If this is not the case, it is recommended that the student 
review his preceding work, in order to regain a familiarity 
with the specific meanings assigned 
to the terms used therein. 
There will be no opportunity 
herein to repeat this information and 
unless he understands clearly the significance of the terms employed, his progress will be retarded. 
b. This text constitutes the first of a series of texts on cryptanalysis. 
Although most of the 
information contained herein is applicable to cryptograms of various types and sources, special 
emphasis will be laid upon the principles and methods of solving military cryptograms. 
Except 
for an introductory 
discussion of fundamental principles underlying the science of cryptanalytics, 
this first text in the series will deal solely with the principles and methods for the analysis of 
monoalphabetic substitution 
ciphers. 
Even with this limitation 
it will be possible to discuss 
only a few of the many variations of this one type; but with a firm grasp upon the general prin- 
ciples no difficulties should be experienced with any variations that may be encountered. 
c. This and some of the succeeding texts will deal only with elementary types of cipher 
systems not because they may be encountered in military operations but because their study is 
essential to an understanding of the principles underlying the solution of the modem, very much 
more complex types of ciphers and codes that are likely to be employed by the larger govern- 
ments today in the conduct of their military affairs in time of war. 
d. All of this series of texts will deal only with the solution of visible secret writing. 
At 
some future date, texts dealing with the solution of invisible secret writing, and with secret 
signalling systems, may be prepared.

These words are as true today as they were then. There is no royal road to success in the 
solution of cryptograms. 
Hitt goes on to say: 
Cipher work will have little permanent attraction 
for one who expects results at once, without 
labor, for 
there is a vast amount of purely routine labor in the preparation 
of frequency tables, the rearrangement 
of 
ciphers for examination, 
and the trial and fitting of letter to letter before the message begins to appear. 
The present author deems it advisable to add that the kind of work involved in solving 
cryptograms is not at all similar to that involved in solving “cross-word puzzles”, for example. 
The wide vogue the latter have had and continue to have is due to the appeal they make to the 
quite common instinct for mysteries of one sort or another; but in solving a cress-word puzzle 
there is usually no necessity for performing any preliminary labor, and palpable results become 
evident after the first minute or two of attention. 
This successful start spurs the cross-word 
“addict” 
on to complete the solution, which rarely requires more than an hour’s time, Further- 
more, cross-word puzzles are all alike in basic principle and once understood, there is no more to 
learn. 
Skill comes largely from the embellishment of one’s vocabulary, though, to be sure, con- 
stant practice and exercise of the imagination contribute to the ease and rapidity with which 
solutions are generally reached: 
In solving cryptograms, however, many principles must be 
learned, for there are many different systems of varying degrees of complexity. 
Even some of 
the simpler varieties require the preparation of tabulations of one sort or another, which many 
people find irksome; moreover, it is only toward the very close of the solution that results in the 
form of intelligible text become evident. 
Often, indeed, the student will not even know whether 
he is on the right track until he has performed a large amount of preliminary 
“spade work” 
involving many hours of labor. 
Thus, without at least a willingness to pursue a fair amount of 
theoretical study, and a more than average amount of patience and perseverance, little skill and 
experience can be gained in the rather difficult art of cryptanalysis. 
General Givierge, the author 
of an excellent treatise on cryptanalysis, 
remarks in this connection: 2 
The cryptanalyst’s 
attitude 
must be that of William the Silent: 
No need to hope in order to undertake, nor 
to succeed in order to persevere. 
b. As regards Hitt’s reference to careful methods of analysis, before one can be said to be a 
cryptanalyst 
worthy of the name it is necessary that one should have firstly a sound knowledge 
of the basic principles of cryptanalysis, and secondly, a long, varied, and active practical experi- 
ence in the successful application of those principles. 
It is not sufficient to have read treatises 
on this subject. 
One month’s actual practice in solution is worth a whole year’s mere reading 
of theoretical principles. 
An exceedingly important 
element of success in solving the more 
intricate ciphers is the possession of the rather unusual mental faculty designated in general 
terms as the power of inductive and deductive reasoning. 
Probably this is an inherited rather 
than an acquired faculty; the best sort of training for its emergence, if latent in the individual, 
and for its development is the study of the natural sciences, such as chemistry, physics, biology, 
geology, and the like. 
Other sciences such as linguistics and philology are also excellent. 
Apti- 
tude in mathematics is quite important, more especially in the solution of ciphers than of codes. 
c. An active imagination, or perhaps what Hitt and other writers call intuition, 
is essential, 
but mere imagination uncontrolled by a judicious spirit will more often be a hindrance than a 
help. 
In practical cryptanalysis the imaginative or intuitive 
faculties must, in other words, be 
guided by good judgment, by practical experience, and by as thorough a knowledge of the general 
situation or extraneous circumstances that led to the sending of the cryptogram as is possible 
to obtain. 
In this respect the many cryptograms exchanged between correspondents whose 
identities and general affairs, commercial, social, or political, are known are far more readily

3 
solved than are isolated cryptograms exchanged between unknown correspondents, dealing with 
unknown subjects. 
It is obvious that in the former case there are good data upon which the 
intuitive 
powers of the cryptanalyst 
can be brought to bear, whereas in the latter case no such 
data are available. 
Consequently, in the absence of such data, no matter how good the imagina- 
tion and intuition 
of the cryptanalyst, these powers are of no particular service to him. 
Some 
writers, however, regard the intuitive 
spirit as valuable from still another viewpoint, as may be 
noted in the following: a 
Intuition, like a flash of lightning, 
lasts only for a second. 
It generally 
comes when one is tormented by 
a difficult 
decipherment 
and when one reviews in his mind the fruitless experiments 
already tried. 
Suddenly 
the light breaks through and one finds after a few minutes what previous days of labor were unable to reveal. 
This, too, is true, but unfortunately 
there is no way in which the intuition 
may be sum- 
moned at will, when it is most needed.’ 
There are certain authors who regard as indispensable 
the possession of a somewhat rare, rather mysterious faculty that they designate by the word 
“flair’,, 
or by the expression “cipher brains.” 
Even so excellent an authority 
as General 
Givierge,’ in referring to this mental facility, uses the following words: “Over and above per- 
severance and this aptitude of mind which some authors consider a special gift, and which they 
call intuition, 
or even, in its highest manifestation, clairvoyance, cryptographic 
studies will 
continue more and more to demand the qualities of orderliness and memory.” 
Although the 
present author believes a special aptitude for the work is essential to cryptanalytic 
success, he is 
sure there is nothing mysterious about the matter at all. 
Special aptitude is prerequisite to 
success in all fields of endeavor. 
There are, for example, thousands of physicists, hundreds of 
excellent ones, but only a handful of world-wide fame. 
Should it be said, then, that a physicist

FElix Alcan, Parin, 1925, p. 104. 
4 The follo+ng 
extracts are of interest in this connection: 
_ “The fact that the scientific investigator 
works 50 per cent of his time by non-rational means is, it seems, quite 
insuf&iently 
recognized. 
There b without the leant doubt an instinct for research, and often the meet successful 
inveetigntors 
of nature are quite unable to give 8n 8CCOUnt 
of their reedone for doing such and ruch an experi- 
ment, or for placing side by ride two apparently 
unreh&d 
fact.& 
Again, one of the moat salient traits in the 
character of the successful ecientific worker in the capacity for knowing that a point ia proved when it would not 
8ppe8r to be proved to an outaide intelligence 
functioning 
in 8 purely rational 
manner; thus the investigator 
feels that Borne proposition is true, and proceeda at once to the next set of experiments without waiting and wasting 
time in the ebboration 
of the formal proof of the point which heavier minds would need. 
Questionless such a 
scientific intuition 
may and does sometimes lead investigators 
astray, 
but it ie quite certain that if they did 
not widely rmrke ure of it, they would not get 8 qu8rter M far 88 they do. 
Experimenta 
confirm each other, and a 
falae step ia usually soon discovered. 
And not only by tti 
plrrtial replacement of reason by intuition 
does the 
work of science go on, but also to the born scientific worker-and 
emphatically 
they cannot be mad-the 
struc- 
ture of the method of research ie 8~ it were given, he cannot expl8in it tp you, though he may be brought to agree 
u porferiori to a formal logical preeentatlon 
of the w8y the method worka”.-Excerpt 
from Nedham, 
Joseph,

who has achieved very notable success in his field has done so because he is the fortunate poseessor 
of a mysterious faculty ? That he is fortunate in possessing a special aptitude for his subject is 
granted, but that there is anything mysterious about it, partaking of the nature of clairvoyance 
(if, indeed, the latter is a reality) is not granted. 
While the ultimate nature of sny mental 
process seems to be as complete a mystery today as it has ever been, the present author would 
like to see the superficial veil of mystery removed from a subject that has been shrouded in 
mystery from even before the Middle Ages down to our own times. 
(The principal and easily 
understandable reason for this is that governments have always closely guarded cryptographic 
secrets and anything so guarded soon becomes “mysterious.“) 
He would, rather, have the 
student approach the subject as he might approach any other science that can stand on its own 
merits with other sciences, because cryptanalytics, 
like other sciences, has 8 practical importance 
in human affairs. 
It presents to the inquiring mind an interest in its own right as a branch of 
knowledge; it, too, holds forth many difhculties and disappointments, and these are all the more 
keenly felt when the nature of these difhculties is not understood by those unfamiliar with the 
special circumstances that very often are the real factors that led to success in other cases. 
Finally, just as in the other sciences wherein many men labor long and earnestly for the true 
satisfaction and pleasure that comes from work well-done, so the mental pleasure that the 
successful cryptanalyst 
derives from his accomplishments is very often the only reward for much 
of the drudgery that he must do in his daily work. 
General Givierge’s words in this connection 
are well worth quoting:4 
Some studies will I& 
for years before bearing fruit. 
In the ca8e of others, cryptanalysta 
undertaking 
them 
never get any result. 
But, for a cryptanalyst 
who likes the work, the joy of diecoveriee effaces the memory of hie 
houra of doubt 
apd 
impatience. 
d. With his usual deft touch, Hitt says of the element of luck, as regards the role it plays in 
analysis: 
As to luck, there ia the old mineru’ proverb: 
“Gold is where you find it.” 
The cryptanalyst 
is lucky when one of the correspondents whose ciphers he ir studying 
makes a blunder that gives the necessary clue; or when he finds two cryptograms identical in 
text but in different keys in the same system; or when he finds two cryptograms identical in 
text but in ditIerent systems, and so on. The element of luck is there, to be sure, b& the crypt- 
analyst mu& be en the alert if he is to profit by these lucky “breaks.” 
e. If the present author were asked to state, in view of the progress in the field since 1916, 
what elements might be added to the four ingredients Hitt thought essential to cryptanalytic 
success, he would be inclined to mention the following: 
(1) A broad, general education, embodying interests covering as many fields of practical 
knowledge as possible. 
This is useful because the cryptanalyst 
is often called upon to solve 
messages dealing with the most varied of human activities, and the more he knows about these 
actSties, 
the easier his task. 
(2) Access to a large library of current literature, and wide and direct contacts with sources 
of collateral information. 
These often afford clues as to the contents of specific messages. For 
example, to be able instantly to have at his disposal a newspaper report or a personal report of 
events described or referred to in a message under investigation goes a long way toward simpli- 
fying or facilitating 
solution. 
Government cryptanalysts are sometimes fortunately situated in 
this respect, especially where various agencies work in harmony. 
(3) Proper coordination of effort. This includes the organization of cryptanalytic 
personnel 
into harmonious, efficient teams of cooperating individuals.

(4) Under mental equipment he would also include the faculty of being able to concentrate 
on a problem for rather long periods of time, without 
distraction, 
nervous irritability, 
and 
impatience. 
The strain under which cryptanalytic 
studies are necessarily conducted is quite 
severe and too long-continued 
application 
has the effect of draining nervous energy to an 
unwholesome degree, so that a word or two of caution may not here be out of place. One should 
continue at work only so long as 8 pe8cefu1, c8hn spirit prevails, whether the work is fruitful or 
not. But just as soon as the mind becomes wearied with the exertion, or just 8s soon as a feeling 
of hopelessness or mental fatigue intervenes, it is better to stop completely and turn to other 
activities, rest, or play. 
It is essential to remark that systematization and orderliness of work 
are aids in reducing nervous tension and irritability. 
On this account it is better to take the 
time to prepare the data carefully, rewrite the text if necessary, and so on, rather than work 
with slipshod, incomplete, or improperly 
arranged material. 
(5) A retentive memory is 8n important asset to cryptesalytic 
skill, especially in the solu- 
tion of codes. The ability to remember individual 
groups, their approximate locations in other 
messages, the associations they form with other groups, their peculiarities and similarities, saves . 
much wear and tear of the mental machinery, 8s well 8s much time in looking up these groups in 
indexes. 
f. It may be advisable to add a word or two at this point to prepare the student to expect 
slight mental jars and tensions which will almost inevitably 
come to him in the conscientious 
study of this and the subsequent texts. 
The present author is well aware of the complsint of 
students that authors of texts on crypt8nalysis base much of their explanation upon their fore- 
knowledge of the “answer”- 
which the student does not know while he is attempting to follow 
the solution with an unbiased mind. 
They complain too that these authors use such expressions 
as “obviously”, 
“naturally”, 
“of course “, “it is evident that”, rend so on, when the circumstances 
seem not at all to warrant their use. There is no question but that this sort of treatment is apt 
to discourage the student, especially when the point elucidated becomes clear to him only after 
many hours’ labor, whereas, according to the book, the author noted the weak spot at the first 
moment’s inspection. 
The present author can only promise to try to avoid making the steps 
appear to be much more simple than they really are, and to suppress glaring instances of unjusti- 
fiable “jumping at conclusions.” 
At the same time he must indicate that for pedagogical reasons 
in many cases a message ha8 been consciously “manipulated” 
so 8s to allow certain principles to 
become more obvious in the illustrative 
examples than they ever are in practical work. 
During 
the course of some of the explanations attention will even be directed to cases of unjustified 
inferences. 
Furthermore, of the student who is quick in observation and deduction, the author 
will only ask that he bear in mind that if the elucidation of certain principles seems prolix and 
occupies more space than necessary, this is occasioned by the author’s desire to carry the 
explanation forward in very short, easily-comprehended, and plainly-described 
steps, for the 
benefit of students who &re perhaps a bit slower to grasp but who, once they understand, are 
able to retain and apply principles slowly learned just 8s well, if not better than the students 
who learn more quickly. 
3. Validity of results of crypkn8lysis. -V8lid, 
or authentic cryptanalytic 
solutions cannot 
and do not represent “opinions” 
of the cryptarmlyst. 
They are valid only so far 8s they are 
wholly objective, and are susceptible of demonstration and proof, employing authentic, objective 
method.3. It should hardly be necessary (but an attitude frequently encountered among laymen 
makes it advisable) to indicate that the validity 
of the results achieved by any serious crypt- 
analytic studies on authentic material rests upon the same sure foundations and are reached by 
the same general steps as the results achieved by any other scientific studies; viz, observation, 
hypothesis, deduction asd induction, snd confirmatory experiment. 
Implied in the lntter is the

possibility that two or more qualified investigators, each working independently upon the same 
material, will achieve identical (or practically 
identical) results. 
Occasionally a pseudo-crypb 
8nalyst offers “solutions” 
which cannot withstand such tests; a second, unbiased, investigator 
working independently either cannot consistently apply the methods alleged to have been applied 
by the pseudo-cryptanalyst, 
or else, if he can apply them at all, the results (plain-text transla- 
tions) are far different in the two cases. The reason for this is that in such cases it is generally 
found that the “methods” 
are not clesr-cut, straightforward 
or mathematical in character. 
Instead, they often involve the making of judgments on matters too tenuous to measure, weigh, 
or otherwise subject to careful scrutiny. 
In such cases, the conclusion to which the unprejudiced 
observer is forced to come is that the alleged “solution” 
obtained by the first investigator, the 
pseudo-cryptanalyst, 
is purely subjective. 
In nearly all cases where this has happened (and they 
occur from time to time) there has been uncovered nothing which can in any way be used to 
impugn the integrity of the pseudo-cryptanalyst. 
The worst that can be aaid of him is that he 
has become a victim of a special or peculiar form of self-delusion, and that his desire to solve the 
problem, usually in accord with some previously-formed 
opinion, or notion, has over-balanced, 
or undermined, his judgment and good sense.’

4. The four basic operations in cryptanalysis.-& 
The solution of practically every crypto- 
gram involves four fundamental operat,ions or steps: 
(1) The determination of the language employed in the plain-text version. 
(2) The determination of the general system of cryptography employed. 
(3) The reconstruction of the specific key in the case of a cipher system, or the reconstruc- 
tion, partial or complete, of the code book, in the case of n code system; or both, in the case of an 
enciphered code system. 
(4) The reconstruction or establishment of the plain text. 
b. These operations will be taken up in the order in which they are given above and in which 
they usually are performed in the solution of cryptograms, although occasionally the second 
step may precede the first. 
6. The determination of the language employed.-u. 
There is not much that need be said 
with respect to this operation except that the determination of the language employed seldom 
comes into question in the case of studies made of the cryptograms of an organized enemy. 
By this is meant that during wartime the enemy is of course known, and it follows, therefore, 
that the language he employs in his messages will almost certainly be his native or mother tongue. 
Only occasionally nowadays is this rule broken. 
Formerly it often happened, or it might have 
indeed been the general rule, that the language used in diplomatic correspondence was not the 
mother tongue, but French. 
In isolated instances during the World War, the Germans used 
English when their own language could for one reason or another not be employed. For example, 
for a year or two before the entry of the United States into that war, during the time America 
was neutral and the German Government maintained its embassy in Washington, some of t.he 
messages exchanged between the Foreign Office in Berlin and the Embassy in Washington were 
cryptographed in English, and a copy of the code used was deposited with the Department of 
State and our censor. Another instance is found in the case of certain Hindu conspirntors who 
were associated with and partially financed by the German Government in 1915 and 1916; they 
employed English as the language of their cryptographic 
messages. Occasionally the crypto- 
grams of enemy agents may be in a language different from that of the enemy. But in general 
these are, as has been said, isolated instances; as a rule, the language used in cryptograms ex- 
changed between members of large organizations is the mother tongue of the correspondents. 
Where this is not the case, that is, when cryptograms-of unknown origin must be studied, the 
cryptanalyst 
looks for any indications on the cryptograms themselves which may lead to a 
conclusion as to the language employed. 
Address, signature, and plain-language words in the 
preamble or in the body of the text all come under careful scrutiny, as well as all extraneous 
circumstances connected with the manner in which. the cryptograms were obtained, the person 
on whom they were found, or the locale of their origin and destination.

b. In special cases, or under special circumstances a clue to the language employed is found 
in the nature and composition of the cryptographic text itself. 
For example, if the letters K and 
W are entirely absent or appear very rarely in messages, it may indicate that the language is 
Spanish, for these letters are absent in the alphabet of that language and are used only to spell 
foreign words or names. The presence of accented letters or letters marked with special signs of 
one sort or another, peculiar to certain languages, will sometimes indicate the language used. 
The Japanese Morse telegraph alphabet and the Russian Morse telegraph alphabet contain 
combinations of dots and dashes which are peculiar to those alphabets and thus the interception 
of messages containing these special Morse combinations at once indicates the language involved. 
Finally, there are certain peculiarities of alphabetic languages which, in certain types of crypto- 
grams, ~$2, pure transposition, give clues as to the language used. For example, the frequent 
digraph C H, in German, leads to the presence, in cryptograms of the type mentioned, of many 
isolated C’s and H’s; if this is noted, the cryptogram may be assumed to be in German. 
c. In some cases it is perfectly possible to perform certain steps in cryptanalysis bejote 
the language of the cryptogram has been definitely determined. 
Frequency studies, for example, 
may be made and analytic processes performed without this knowledge, and by a cryptanalyst 
wholly unfamiliar with the language even if it has been identified, or who knows only enough 
about the language to enable him to recognize valid combinations of letters, syllables, or a few 
common words in that language. He may, after this, call to his assistance a translator who may 
not be a cryptanalyst 
but who can materially aid in making necessary assumptions based upon 
his special knowledge of the characteristics of the language in question. 
Thus, cooperation 
between cryptanalyst 
and translator results in so1ution.L 
6. The determination 
of the general system.-, a. Except in the case of the more simple 
types of cryptograms, the determination of the general system according to which a given crypt.o- 
gram has been produced is usually a difficult, if not the most diicult, 
step in its solution. 
The 
reason for this is not hard to find. 
b. As will become apparent to the student as he proceeds with his study, in thejnul 
analyti, 
the soh.lion of every cryptogram invohing 
UjO?WI of i?ubstitu4ion depends upon its reduction to mono- 
alphabetic terms, if it is not originaLly in those terms. 
This is true not only of ordinary substitution 
ciphers, but also of combined substitution-transposition 
ciphers, and of enciphered code. If the 
cryptogram must be reduced to monoalphabetic 
terms, the manner of its accomplishment is 
usually indicated by the cryptogram itself, by external or internal phenomena which become 
apparent to the cryptanalyst as he studies the cryptogram. 
If this is impossible, or too diflicult 
the cryptanalyst 
must, by one means or another, discover how to accomplish this reduction, 
by bringing to bear all the special or collateral information he can get from all the sources at his 
command. 
If both these possibilities fail him, there is little left but the long, tedious, and often 
fruitless process of elimination. 
In the case of transposition ciphers of the more complex type, 
the discovery of the basic method is often simply a matter of long and tedious elimination of 
possibilities. 
For cryptanalysis 
has unfortunately 
not yet attained, and may indeed never 
attain, the precision found today in qualitative 
analysis in chemistry, for example, where the 
analytic process is absolutely clear cut and exact in its dichotomy. 
A few words in explanation of 
what is meant may not be amiss. When a chemist seeks to determine the identity of an unknown 
1 The writer hae seen in print statements 
that “during 
the World War . . . decoded message-s in Japanese 
and Russian without knowing 8 word of either language.” 
The extent to which such etatements are exaggerated 
will soon become obvious to the student. 
Of course, there are occasional instances in which a mere clerk with 
quite limited experience may be able to “solve” 
a message in 8n extremely simple system in a language of which 
he has no knowledge at all; but such a “solution” 
calls for nothing more rvduous than the ability 
to recognize 
pronounceable 
combinatione 
of vowels and consonants-8n 
ability 
that hardly deserves to be rated as “crypt- 
analytic” 
in any real sense. 
To say th8t it is possibIe to solve 8 cryptogram 
in a foreign language “without 
knowing a word of that language” 
is not quite the same 8s to cay that it Is possible to do so with only 8 slight 
knowledge of the language; and it may be stated without 
cavil 
that 
the better the cryptanalyst’s 
knowledge of 
the language, the greater are the chances for his success and, in any c8se, the easier is his work.

substance, he applies certain specific reagents to the substance and in a specific sequence. The 
first reagent tells him definitely into which of two primary classes the unknown substance falls. 
He then applies a second test with another specific reagent, which tells him again quite definitely 
into which of two secondary classes the unknown substance falls, and so on, until finally he has 
reduced the unknown substance to its simplest terms and has found out what it is. 
In striking 
contrast to this situation, cryptanalysis affords exceedingly few “reagents” or tests that may be 
applied to determine positively that a given cipher belongs to one or the other of two systems 
yielding externally similar results. 
And this is what makes the analysis of an isolated, complex 
cryptogram so ditlicult. 
Note the limiting adjective “isolated” in the foregoing sentence, for it 
is used advisedly. 
It is not often that the general system fails to disclose itself or cannot be 
discovered by painstaking investigation when there is a great volume of text accumulating from 
a regular traffic between numerous correspondents in a large organization. 
Sooner or later the 
system becomes known, either because of blunders and carelessness on the part of the personnel 
entrusted with the cryptographing 
of the messages, or because the accumulation of text itself 
makes possible the determination 
of the general system by cryptanalytic 
studies. 
But in the 
case of a single or even a few isolated cryptograms concerning which little or no information can 
be gained by the cryptanalyst, he is often unable, without a knowledge of, or a shrewd guess as to 
the general system employed, to decompose the heterogeneous text of the cryptogram into 
homogeneous, monoalphabetic text, which is the ultimate and essential step in analysis. 
The 
only knowledge that the cryptanalyst can bring to his aid in this most diflicult step is that gained 
by long experience and practice in the analysis of many different types of systems. 
c. On account of the complexities surrounding this particular phase of cryptanalysis, and 
because in any scheme of analysis based upon successive eliminations of alternatives the crypt- 
analyst can only progress so far as the extent of his own knowledge of aU the possible alternatives 
will permit, it is necessary that detailed discussion of the eliminative process be postponed until 
the student has covered most of the field. 
For example, the student will perhaps want to know 
at once how he can distinguish between a cryptogram that is in code or enciphered code from one 
that is in cipher. 
It is at this stage of his studies impracticable to give him any helpful indica- 
tions on his question. 
In return it may be asked of him why he should expect to be able to do 
this in the early stages of his studies when often the experienced expert cryptanalyst is baffled on 
the same score! 
d. Nevertheless, in lieu of more precise tests not yet discovered, a general guide that may be 
useful in cryptanalysis will be built up, step by step as the student progresses, in the form of a 
series of charts comprising what may be designated An Analytical 
Key For C’ryptanalysis. 
(See 
Par. 50.) 
It may be of assistance to the student if, as he proceeds, he will carefully study the 
charts and note the place which the particular cipher he is solving occupies in the general crypt- 
analytic 
panorama. 
These charts admittedly 
constitute 
only very brief outlines, and can 
therefore be of but little direct assistance to him in the analysis of the more complex types of 
ciphers he may encounter later on. 
So far as they go, however, they may be found to be quite 
useful in the study of elementary cryptanalysis. 
For the experienced cryptanalyst 
they can 
serve only as a means of assuring that no possible step or process is inadvertently 
overlooked in 
attempts to solve a diEcult cipher. 
e. Much of the labor involved in cryptanalytic 
work, as referred to in Par. 2, is connected 
with this determination 
of the general system. 
The preparation of the text, its rewriting in 
different forms, sometimes being rewritten in a half dozen ways, the recording of letters, the 
establishment of frequencies of occurrences of letters, comparisons and experiments made with 
known material of similar character, and so on, constitute much labor that is most often in- 
dispensable, but which sometimes turns out to have been wholly unnecessary, or in vain.

recent treatise a it is stated quite boldly that “this work once done, the determination of the 
eystbm is often relatively easy.” 
This statement can certainly apply only to the simpler types of 
ciphers; it is entirely misleading 8s regards the much more frequently 
encountered complex 
cryptograms of modem times. 
7. The reconstruction 
of the specific key.+. 
Nearly 8ll practical cryptographic 
methods 
require the use of a specific key to guide, control, or modify the various steps under the general 
system. 
Once the latter has been disclosed, discovered, or h8s otherwise come into the possession 
of the cryptanalyst, 
the next step in solution is to determine, if necessary, and if possible, the 
specific key that ~8s employed to cryptograph 
the message or messages under examination. 
This determination may not be in complete detail; it may go only so far 8s to lead to a knowledge 
of the number of alphabets involved in a substitution cipher, or the number of columns involved 
in a transposition cipher, or that a one-part code has been used, in the case of a code system. 
But it is often desirable to determine the specific key in 8s complete a form and with 8s much 
detail as possible, for this information will very frequently be useful in the solution of subsequent 
cryptograms exchanged between the s&me correspondents, since the nature of the specific key 
in 8 solved c8.se may be expected to give clues to the specific key in s,n unsolved case. 
b. Frequently, however, the reconstruction of the key is not 8 prerequisite to, and does not 
constitute an absolutely necessary preliminary step in, the fourth basic operation, oiz, the recon- 
struction or establishment of the plain text. 
In many cases, indeed, the two processes 8re 
carried along simultaneously, the one assisting the other, until in the 6ns.l stsges both have been 
completed in their entireties. 
In still other cases the reconstruction 
of the specific key may 
succeed instead of precede the reconstruction of the plain text, and is accomplished purely as a 
matter of academic interest; or the specific key may, in unusual cases, never be reconstructed. 
8. The reconstruction of the plain text.-u. 
Little need be said at this point on this phase 
of cryptanalysis. 
The process usually consists, in the case of substitution ciphers, in the estab- 
lishment of equivalency between specific letters of the cipher text and the plain text, letter by 
letter, psir by pair, and so on, depending upon the particular 
type of substitution 
system 
involved. 
In the c8se of transposition ciphers, the process consists in rearranging the elements of 
the cipher text, letter by letter, pair by psir, or occasionally word by word, depending upon the 
particular type of transposition system involved, until the letters or words have been returned 
to their original plrtin-text order. 
In the case of code, the process consists in determining the 
meaning of each code group and inserting this meaning in the code text to reestablish the original 
plain text. 
b. The foregoing processes do not, 8s a rule, begin at the beginning of a message snd 
continue letter by letter, or group by group in sequence up to the very end of the message. The 
establishment of values of cipher letters in substitution 
methods, or of the positions to which 
cipher letters should be transferred to form the plain text in the c8se of transposition methods, 
comes at very irregular intervals in the process. At first only one or two values scattered here 
asd there throughout the text may appear; these then form the “skeletons” of words, upon which 
further work, by a continuation 
of the reconstruction process, is msde possible; in the end the 
complete or nearly complete * text is established. 
c. In the case of cryptograms in a foreign language, the trsnslation of the solved messages 
is a final and necessary step, but is not to be considered 8s a cryptanalytic 
process. However, 
it is commonly the c8se that the translation process will be carried on simultaneously with the 
cryptanalytic, 
and will aid the latter, especially when there 8re lacunas which may be filled in 
from the context. 
(See also Par. 5c in this connection.) 
’ Lange et Soudart, op. cit., p. 106. 
* Sometimes in the case of code, the meaning of 8 few code groupe may be lacking, because there ia tiufficient 
text to eetabliah their meaning.

Compare, for example, the frequencies of A, B, C . . . Z in Fig. 1 with those of A, B, C, . . . Z

rather strikingly.

d. This agreement, or similatity, 
would be practically complete if the two texts were much 
longer, for example, five times as long. 
In fact, when two texta of similar character, each con- 
taining more than 1,000 letters, are compared, it would be found that the respective frequencies 
of the 26 letters composing the two graphs show only very alight diflerences. This means, in 
other words, that in normsl, plain text each letter of the alphabet occurs with 8 rather constant or 
charatacterieti.c jrequenq 
which it tends to approximate, depending upon the length of the text 
analyzed. 
The longer the text (within certain limits), the closer will be the approximation to the 
characteristic frequencies of letters in the language involved. 
However, when the amount of 
text being analyzed has reached a substantial volume (roughly, 1,000 letters), the practical gain 
in accuracy does not warrant further incresse in the amount of text.’ 
e. An experiment slang these lines will be convincing. 
A series of 260 official telegnuna 1 
passing through the War Department Message Center was exsmined statistic8lly.

eagea were divided into five seta, each totaling 10,000 letters, and the five distributions

TABLE 2-A. -Absolute frequencies 
of letters appearing in the combined five set of messages 
totaling 
50,000 letters, arranged alphabetically 
10. Important features of the normal uniliteral frequency distribution.- a. 
When the graph 
shown in Fig. 3 is studied in detail, the following features are apparent: 
(1) It is quite irregular in appearance. 
This is because the letters are used with greatly 
varying frequencies, as discussed in the preceding paragraph. 
This irregular appearance is often 
described by saying that the graph shows marked crests and troughs, that is, points of high fre- 
quency and low frequency.

(2) The relative positions in which the crests and troughs fall within the graph, that is, the 
spatial relations of the crests and troughs, are rather definitely fixed and are determined by cir- 
cumstances which have been explained in a preceding text.’ 
(3) The relative heights and depths of the crests and troughs within the graph, that is, the 
linear eztensions of the lines marking the respective frequencies, are also rather definitely 8xed, 
as would be found if an equal volume of similar text were analyzed. 
(4) The most prominent 
crests are marked by the vowels A, E, I, 0, and the consonants 
N, R, S, T; the most prominent troughs are marked by the consonants J, K, Q, X, and Z. 
(5) The important data are summarized in tabular form in Table 3.

b. The data given in Fig. 3 and Table 3 represent the relative frequencies found in a large 
volume of English telegraphic text of a governmental, administrative 
character. 
These fre- 
quencies will vary somewhat with the nature of the text analyzed. 
For example, if an equal 
number of telegrams dealing solely with commc~cia2 transactions in the Zux.thct indutztty were 
studied statistically, the frequencies would be slightly different because of the repeated occurrence 
of words peculiar to that industry. 
Again, if an equal number of telegrams dealing solely with 
milifay 
messages of a tactical character were studied statistically, 
the frequencies would tier 
slightly from those found above for general governmental messages of an administrative character. 
c. If ordinary English literary text (such as may be found in any book, newspaper, or printed 
document) were analyzed, the frequencies of certain letters would be changed to an appreciable 
degree. This is because in telegraphic text words which are not strictly essential for intelligibility 
(such as the definite and indefinite articles, certain prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns) are 
omitted. 
In addition, certain essential words, such as “stop”, “period”, “comma”, and the like, 
which are usually indicated in written or printed matter by symbols not easy to transmit tele- 
graphically and which must, therefore, be spelled out in telegrams, occur very frequently. 
Fur- 
thermore, telegraphic text often employs longer and more uncommon words than does ordinary 
newspaper or book text. 
d. As a matter of fact, other tables compiled in the Office of the Chief Signal Oflicer gave 
slightly different results, depending upon the source of the text. 
For example, three tables based 
upon 75,000, 100,000, and 136,257 letters taken from various sources (telegrams, newspapers, 
magazine articles, books of fiction) gave as the relative order of frequency for the first 10 letters 
the following:

Hitt also compiled data for telegraphic text (but does not state what kind of messages) and 
gives the following table:

e. Frequency data applicable purely to English military text were compiled by EIitt,’ from 
a study of 10,000 letters taken from orders and reports. 
The frequencies found by him are given 
in Tables 4 and 5. 
11. Constancy of the standexd or normal, nniliteral 
frequency 
distribution.-u. 
The 
relative frequencies disclosed by the statistical study of large volumes of text may be considered 
to be the standard or nomLal frequencies of the letters of written English. 
Counts made of 
smaller volumes of text will tend to approximate these normal frequencies, and, within certain 
limits,( the smaller the volume, the lower will be the degree of approximation 
to the normal, 
until, in the case of a very short message, the normal proportions may not obtain at all. 
It is 
advisable that the student fix this fact firmly in mind, for the sooner he realizes the true nature 
of any data relative to the frequency of occurrence of letters in text, the less often will his labors 
toward the solution of specific ciphers be thwarted and retarded by too strict an adherence to 
these generalized principles of frequency. 
He should constantly bear in mind that such data 
are merely statistical generalizations, that they will be found to hold strictly true only in large 
volumes of text, and that they may not even be approximated in short messages. 
b. Nevertheless the normal frequency distribution 
or the “normal expectancy” for any 
alphabetic language is, in the last analysis, the best guide to, and the usual basis for, the solution 
of cryptograms of a certain type. 
It is useful, therefore, to reduce the normal, 
uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
to a basis that more or less closely approximates the volume of text which 
the cryptanalyst 
most often encounters 
in individual 
cryptograms. 
As regards length of mes- 
sages, counting only the letters in the body, and excluding address and signature, a study of the

in establishing 
the normal-frequency 
distribution 
for 8 given 
Lnguage. 
As a etriking 
instance of this fact, witness the frequency etudy msde by an indefatigable 
German, 
I&ding, 
who in 1898 made B count of the lettera in about 11,000,OOO words, totaling about 62,ooO,ooO letters in 
German text. 
When reduced to I) percentage bask and when the relative order of frequency WM determined, 
the reaulte he obtained differed very little from the reeulta obtained by Kaekki, 
a German cryptographer, 
from a 
count of only 1,060 letters.

c. The student should take careful note of the appearance of the distribution 
’ shown in 
Pig. 4, for it will be of much a&stance to him in the early stages of his study. 
The manner of 
setting down the tallies should be followed by him in making his own distributions, 
indicating 
every fifth occurrence of a letter by an oblique tdy. 
This procedure almost automaticslly 
shows the total number of occurrences for each letter, snd yet does not destroy the grapbicrtl 
appearance of the distribution, 
especially if care is taken to use approximately the same amount 
of space for each set of five tallies. 
Cross-section paper is very u8efu.l for this purpose. 
d. The word “uniliteml” 
in the designation “uniliteral 
frequency distribution” 
means 
“single letter”, and it is to be inferred that other types of frequency distributions may be encoun- 
tered. 
For example, a distribution 
of pairs of letters, constituting 
a biliteral frequency distri- 
bution’ is very often used in the study of certain cryptograms in which it is desked that pairs 
msde by combining successive letters be listed. 
A biliteral distribution 
of A B C D E F would 
take these pairs: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF. The distribution 
could be made in the form of a large 
square divided up into 676 cells. 
When distributions 
beyond biliteral are required (triliteral, 
quadraliteral, 
etc.) they can only be msde by listing them in some order, for example, alpha- 
betically based on the let, 2d, 3d, . . . letter. 
* The arithmetical 
average is obtained 
by adding each different 
length and dividing 
by the number of 
different-length 
meesagee; the mean in obtained by multiplying 
each different length by the number of meesage-a 
of that length, adding all products, and dividing 
by the total number of meaeages. 
1 The use of the terma “distribution” 
and ‘2requency 
distribution”, 
instead of “hble” 
and “frequency 
table”, 
respectively, 
ia considered advisable 
from the point of view of oon&kency 
with the usual statistical 
nomenclature. 
When data are given in tabular 
form, with frequencieo indicated 
by numbers, then they may 
properly 
be said to be set out in the form of a t&e. 
When, however, the tzame data are dktributed 
in a chart 
which part&es 
of the nature of a graph, with the data indicated 
by horixootal 
or vertical linear extensionr, or 
by a curve connecting points corresponding to quantities, 
then it ie more proper to call ouch a graphic repreeen- 
tation of the data a distribution.

FUNDAMENTAL 
USES OF THE 
UNILITERAL 
FREQUENCY 
DISTRIBUTION 
tribution 
for a cryptogram. 
a. The following four facts (to be explained subsequently) can 
usually be determined from &n inspection of the &literal 
frequency distribution 
for a given 
cipher message of avenge length, composed of letters: 
(1) Whether the cipher belongs to the substitution 
or the transposition cless; 
(2) If to the former, whether it is monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic in character; 
(3) If monoalphabetic, whether the cipher alphabet is a standard cipher alphabet or a mixed 
cipher alphabet; 
(4) If standard, whether it is a direct or reversed standard cipher alphabet. 
b. For immediate purposes the tit’ 
two of the foregoing determinations are quite important 
and will be discussed in detail in the next two subparagraphs; the other two determinations will 
be touched upon very briefly, leaving their detailed discussion for subsequent sections of the 
text. 
13. Determining the class to which a cipher belongs.+. 
The determination 
of the class 
to which 8 cipher belongs is usually 8 relatively easy matter because of the fundamental difference 
in the nature of transposition and of substitution as cryptographic processes. In a transposition 
cipher the original letters of the plain text have merely been rearranged, without any change 
whatsoever in their identities, that is, in the conventional values they have in the normal alpha- 
bet. 
Hence, the numbers of vowels (A, E, I, 0, U, Y), high-frequency consonants (D, NJ R, S, T), 
medium-frequency consonants (B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W), and low-frequency consonants (J, K, 
Q, X, 2) are exactly the s8me in the cryptogram 8s they are in the plain-text message. Therefore, 
the percentages of vowels, high, medium, and low-frequency consonants are the s8me in the 
transposed text as in the equivalent plain text. 
In a substitution cipher, on the other hand, the 
identities of the original letters of the plsin text have been changed, that is, the conventional 
values they have in the normal alphabet have been altered. 
Consequently, if a count is made 
of the various letters present in such a cryptogram, it will be found that the number of vowels, 
high, medium, and low-frequency consonants will usually be quite different in the cryptogram 
from what they are in the original plain-text 
message. Therefore, the percentages of vowels, 
high, medium, and low-frequency consonants are usually quite difIerent in the substitution 
text 
from what they are in the equivalent plsin text. 
From these considerations it follows that if in 
8 specific cryptogram the percentages of vowels, high, medium, and low-frequency consonants 
are approximately the same as would be expected in normal plain text, the cqWqprn 
probably 
belongs to the transposition 
class; if these percentages are quite difIerent from those to be 
expected in normal plain text the cryptogram probably belongs to the substitution class.

i. In the preceding subparagraph the word “probably” 
was emphasized by it&i&g 
it, 
for there can be no certainty in every c&se of this determination. 
&u&y 
these percentages in 
a transposition cipher are close to the normal percentages for plain text; &y, 
in a substitu- 
tion cipher, they are far different from the normal percentages for plain text. 
But occ88ionally 
8 cipher message is encountered which is difhcult to classify with 8 rerrsonsble degree of certainty 
because the message is too short for the general principles of frequency to manifest themselvee. 
It is clear that if in actual megsages there were no variation whatever from the normal vowel 
and consonant percentages given in Table 3, the determination of the class to which a specific 
cryptogram belongs would be an extremely simple matter. 
But unfortunately 
there is always 
some variation or deviation from the normal. 
Intuition 
suggests that as messages decresae in 
length there may be a greater and grerrter departure from the normal proportions of vowels, 
high, medium, and low-frequency consonants, until in very short messages the normal propor- 
tions may not hold at all. 
Similarly, as messages increase in length there may be a lesser and 
lesser depsrture from the normal proportions, until in messages totahing a thousand or more 
letters there may be no merence 
at all between the actual and the theoretical proportions, 
But intuition is not enough, for in dealing with specific messages of the length of those commonly 
encountered in practical work the question sometimes arises as to exactly how much deviation 
(from the normal proportions) may be allowed for in a cryptogram which shows a considerable 
amount of deviation from the nor-ma and which might still belong to the transposition rather 
than to the substitution 
class. 
c. Statistical studies have been made on this matter and some graphs have been constructed 
thereon. 
These are shown in Charts l-4 in the form of simple curves, the use of which will now 
be explained. 
Each chart contains two curve8 marking the lower and upper limits, respectively, 
of the theoretical amount of deviation (from the normal percentages) of vowels or consonants 
which may be allowable in a cipher believed to belong to the transposition class. 
d. In Chart 1, curve V, marks the lower limit of the theoretical amount of deviation from the 
normtll number of vowels to be expected in a message of given length; curve VP marks the upper 
limit of the same thing. 
Thus, for example, in a message of 100 letters in plain English there 
should be between 33 and 47 vowels (A E I 0 U Y). 
Likewise, in Chart 2 curves HI and & 
mark the lower asd upper limits 88 regards the high-frequency consonants. 
In a message of 100 
letters there should be between 28 and 42 high-frequency consonants (D N R S T). 
In Chart 3, 
curves Ml and M2 mark the lower and upper limits as regards the medium-frequency consonants. 
In a message of 100 letters there should be between 17 and 31 medium-frequency consonants 
(B C F G H L M P V W). Finally, in Chart 4, curve8 & and 4 mark the lower and upper 
limits 8s regards the low-frequency consonants. 
In a message of 100 letters there should be 
between 0 and 3 low-frequency consonants (J K Q X Z). 
In using the charts, therefore, one 
finds the point of intersection of the vertical coordinate corresponding to the length of the 
message, with the horizontal coordinate corresponding to (1) the number of vowels, (2) the 
number of high-frequency 
consonants, (3) the number of medium-frequency 
consonants, and 
(4) the number of low-frequency consonsnta actually counted in the message. If 8h four points 
of intersection fall within the 8rea delimited by the respective curves, then the number of vowels, 
high, medium, and low-frequency consonants corresponds with the number theoretically expected 
in 8 normal plain-text message of the same length; since the message under investigation is not 
plain text, it follows that the cryptogram may certainly be classified &B a transposition cipher. 
On the other hand, if one or more of these points of intersection f8lls outside the area delimited 
by the respective curves, it follows that the cryptogram is probably a substitution cipher. 
The 
distance that the point of intersection falls outside the area delimited by these curves is a more or 
less rough measure of the improbability 
of the cryptogram’s being a transposition cipher.

e. Sometimes a cryptogram is encountered which ia hard to cla+?.ify with c&ainty 
even with 
the foregoing aids, because it has been consciously prepared with a view to making the class&a- 
tion acult. 
This can be done either by selecting peculiar words (se in Wick cryptograms”) 
or by employing a cipher aphabet in which letters of approtimafcly eimdut normal jrequtvuies 
have been interchanged. 
For example, E may be replaced by 0, T by R, and so on, thus yiekling

a cryptogram giving external indications of being a transposition cipher but which is really a 
substitution 
cipher. 
If the cryptogram is not too short, a close study will usually disclose what 
has been done, as well as the futility 
of so simple a subterfuge. 
j. Ln the majority of c8sea, in practical work, the determination 
of -the class to which a 
cipher of average length belongs GUI be made from a mere inspection of the message, after the 
cryptanalyst 
has acquired a familiarity 
with the normal appearance of transposition and of 
substitution ciphers. 
In the former case, his eyes very speedily note many high-frequency letters, 
such as E, T, N, R, 0, and S, with the absence of low-frequency letters, such as J, K, Q, X,

and 2; in the latter case, his eyes just as quickly note the presence of many low-frequency letten, 
and a corresponding absence of the usual high-frequency letters. 
g. Another rather quickly completed test, in the case of the simpler varieties of ciphers, is 
to look for repetitions oj groups oj letters. 
As will become apparent very soon, recurrences of 
syllables, entire words and short phrases constitute a characteristic of all normal plain text.

(l3aPu.lM.) 
text message, such recurrences are broken up so that the cipher text no longer will show repetitions 
of more or less lengthy sequences of letters. 
But if a cipher message does show many repetitions 
and these are of several letters in length, say over four or five, the conclusion is at once warranted 
that the cryptogram is most probably a substitution 
and not a transposition cipher. 
However, 
for the beginner in cryptanalysis, it will be advisable to make the &literal 
frequency distribution, 
and note the frequencies of the vowels, the high, medium, and low-frequency consonants. 
Then, 
referring to Charts 1 to 4, he should carefully note whether or not the observed frequencies for

these categories of letters fall within the limits of the theoretical frequencies for a normal plain- 
text message of the same length, and be guided accordingly. 
h. It is obvious that the foregoing rule applies only to ciphers composed wholly of letters. 
If a message is composed entirely of figures, or of arbitrary signs and symbols, or of intermixtures

of letters, figures and other symbols, it is immediately apparent that the cryptogram is 8 sub- 
stitution cipher. 
i. Finally, it should be mentioned that there are certain hinds of cryptogrsms whose class 
cannot be determined by the method set forth in subparagraphs b, c, d above. These exceptions 
will be discussed in a subsequent section of this text.’ 
14. Determining whether a substitution cipher is monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic--a. 
It 
will be remembered that a monoalphabetic substitution 
cipher is one in which a single cipher 
alphabet is employed throughout the whole message, that is, a given plain-text letter is invariably 
‘Par. 47.

23 
represented throughout the message by one and the same letter in the cipher text. 
On the other 
hand, a polyalphabetic 
substitution 
cipher is one in which two or more cipher alphabets are 
employed within the same message; that is, 8 given plain-text letter may be represented by two or 
more ditferent letters in the cipher text, according to some rule governing the selection of the 
equivalent to be used in e8Ch case. From this it follows that n single cipher letter may represent 
two or more different plsin-text letters. 
b. It is easy to see why and how the appearance of the uniliteral frequency distribution 
for 
a substitution 
cipher may be used to determine whether the cryptogram is monoalphabetic or 
polyalphabetic 
in character.

virtue of two circumstances. 
First, the elementary sounds which the symbols represent 8re 
used with greatly varying frequencies, it being one of the striking Ch8r8CtWiStiCS of every alpha- 
betic language that its elementary sounds are used with greatly varying frequencies.’ 
In the 
second place, except for orthographic aberrstions peculiar to certain languages (conspicuously, 
English and French), esch such sound is represented by the same symbol. 
It follows, therefore, 
that since in 8 monoalphabetic substitution 
Cipher each merent 
plain-text letter (=elementary 
sound) is represented by one and only one cipher letter (=elementary 
symbol), the uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
for such a cipher message must also exhibit the irregular crest and trough 
appearance of the normal distribution, 
but with only this important modification-the

po&om 
of the crests and trough.8 d 
not be the 8am8 ad in the norm& 
That is, the letters accom- 
panying the crests and the troughs in the distribution 
for the cryptogram will be different from 
those accompanying the crests and the troughs in the normal distribution. 
But the marked 
irregularity 
of the distribution, 
the presence of accentuated crests and troughs, is in itself an 
indication that each symbol or cipher letter always represents the same pl8in-text letter in that 
cryptogram. 
Hence the gene4 rule: 
A marked crest and trough appearaw 
in the uni&&ral 
frequency dtitribuiion 
for a given cryptogram indicates thui a single cipher alphabet ie involved and 
constitutes on& of the test8 jar a monoalphabetic 
wbstitution 
ciph4r. 
c. On the other hand, suppose that in a cryptogram each cipher letter represents several 
diEerent plain-text letters. 
Some of them are of high frequency, others of low frequency. 
The 
net result of such a situation, so far 8s the uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
for the cryptogram 
is concerned, is to prevent the appearance of any marked crests and troughs and to tend to reduce 
the elements of the distribution 
to a more or lees common level. 
This imparts 8 “flsttened 
out”. appearance to the distribution. 
For example, in a certain cryptogram of polyalphabetic 
construction, 
K,=&, 
G,, 8nd J,; R,=&, 
DP, and B,; Xc=Oo, L, and FD. The frequencies of 
K,, R,, and X, will be approximately equal because the summations of the frequencies of the several 
plain-text 
letters each of these cipher letters represents at different times will be about equal. 
If this same phenomenon were true of 8ll the letters of the cryptogram, it is clear that the 
frequencies of the 26 letters, when shown by means of the ordinary uniliteral frequency distribu- 
tion, would show no striking differences and the distribution 
would have the flat appeamnce of 
a typical polyalphabetic 
substitution 
cipher. 
Hence, the general rule: 
The absence of marked 
crests and trough8 in the uni&er& 
jreqwnq 
d&-&&on 
indicate8 tti 
two or more ciph-er atphubets 
are involved. 
Theji%tene&ou4 
appearance oj the distritiion 
con&..tzLtes one of the t&s for a poly- 
alphubetie substitution 
cipher. 
d. The foregoing test based upon the appearance of the frequency distribution 
constitutes 
only one of several means of determining whether a substitution 
cipher is monoalphabetic or 
polyalphabetic 
in composit.ion. 
It ca.n be employed in cases yielding frequency distributions 
from which definite conclusions can be drawn with more or ,less certainty by mere ocular exami- 
nation. 
In those cases in which the frequency distributions 
contain insuf6cient data to permit 
drawing definite conclusions by such examination, certain statisticctl tests can be applied. 
These 
will be discussed in a subsequent text. 
c. At this point, however, one additional test willsbe given because of its simplicity of appli- 
cation. 
It may be employed in te&ing messages up to 200 letters in length, it being Bssumed that 
in messages of greater length ocular examination of the frequency distribution 
offers little or no 
ditbculty. 
This test concerns the number of blanks in the frequency distribution, 
that is, the 
number of letters of the alphabet which are entirely absent from the message. It has been 
found from statistical studies that rather definite “laws” govern the theoretically expected num- 
ber of blanks in normal plain-text 
messages and in frequency distributions 
for cry-ptograms of 
tierent 
natures and of various sixes, The results of certain of these studies have been embodied 
in ch8xt 
5. 
j. This chart containe two curves. 
The one labeled P applies to the average number of 
blanks theoretically expected in frequency distributions 
based upon normal plain-text messages 
of the indicated lengths. 
The other curve, labeled R, applies to the average number of blanks 
theoretically 
expected in frequency distributions 
based upon perfectly random assortments 
of 
letters; that is, assortments such 8s would be found by random selection of letters out of a hat 
containing thousands of letters, all of the 26 letters of the alphabet being present in equal pro- 
portions, each letter being replaced after a record of its selection has been made. Such random 
assortments correspond to polyalphabetic 
cipher messages in which the number of cipher alpha-

bets is so large that if uniliteral frequency distributions

are practically identical with those which are obtained by random selections of letters out of 8 hat. 
g. In using this chart, one finds the point of intersection of the vertical coordinate corre- 
sponding to the length of the message, with the horizontal coordinate corresponding to the 
observed number of blanks in the distribution 
for the message. If this point of intersection falls 
closer to curve P than it does to curve R, the number of blsnks in the message approximates or 
corresponds more closely to the number theoretically 
expected in a plain-text message than it 
does to a random (cipher-text) messsge of the same length; therefore, this is evidence that the 
cryptogram is monoalphabetic.

tion occupy positions which correspond to the rel&ve positions they occupy in the norm81

then the cipher alphabet is 8 standard cipher alphabet. 
If this is not the 
case, then it is highly probable thst the cryptogram has been prepared by the use of 8 mixed 
cipher alphabet.

whether the standard cipher alphabet is direct or reversed.-Assuming 
that the frequency distribution 
for 8 given cryptogram shows clearly thst 8 standard cipher 
alphabet is involved, the determination as to whether the alphabet is direct or reversed can also 
be made by inspection, since the difference between the two ie merely 8 matter of the direction 
in which the sequence of crests and troughs progresses -to 
the right, 8s in normal resding or 
writing, or the left. 
In 8 direct cipher alphsbet the direction in which the crests and troughs 
of the distribution 
should be resd is the normal direction, from left to right; in 8 reversed cipher 
alphabet this direction is reversed, from right to left.

17. Principles of solution by construction and analysis of the uniliteral 
frequency distri- 
bation.-u.’ 
Standard cipher alphabets are of two sorts, direct and reversed. 
The arAy& 
of 
monoalphabetic cryptograms prepared by their use follows almost directly from 8 considerstion of 
the nature 
of such slphabets. 
Since the cipher component of 8 standard cipher alphabet consists 
either of the normal sequence merely displaced 1, 2, 3, . . . intervals from the norm81 point of 
coincidence, or of the normal sequence proceeding in 8 reversed-normal direction, it is obvious 
that the unihter81 frequency distribution 
for 8 cryptogram prepared by means of such 8 cipher 
alphabet employed monoalphabetic8hy 
will show crests and troughs whose relative positions 
and frequencies will be exsctly the s8me as in the unilitersl frequency distribution 
for the plain 
text of thst cryptogrsm. 
The only thing thst has happened is that the whole set of crests and 
troughs of the distribution 
has been displaced to the right or left of the position it occupies in the 
distribution 
for the plain text; or else the successive elements of the whole set progress in the 
opposite direction. 
Hence, it follows thst the correct determinstion of the pl8in-text v8hre of the 
letter marking any crest or trough of the unilitersl 
frequency distribution 
will result at one 
stroke in the correct determination of the plsin-text values of alJ the remsining 25 letters respec- 
tively marking the other crests and troughs in thst distribution. 
Thus, having determined the 
value of a single element of the cipher component of the cipher alphabet, the values of all the 
remaining letters of the cipher component are automatically 
solved at one stroke. 
In more 
simple 18nguage, the correct determination 
of the value of 8 single letter of the cipher text 
automatically 
gives the values of the other 25 letters of the cipher text. 
The problem thus 
resolves itself into 8 mstter of selecting that point of sttack which will most quickly or mOSt 
easily lesd to the determination of the value of one cipher letter. 
The single word identi@u4ion 
will hereafter be used for the phrase “determination 
of the v8hre of 8 cipher letter”; to iden.@/ 8 
cipher letter is to find its plain-text value. 
b. It is obvious that the easiest point of attack is to assume that the letter msrking the crest 
of greatest frequency in the frequency distribution 
for the cryptogram represents &. 
Proceeding 
from this initial point, the identifications of the remaining cipher letters marking the other crests 
and troughs are tentatively 
made on the basis that the letters of the cipher component proceed 
in accordance with the norm81 alphabetic sequence, either direct or reversed. 
If the actual 
frequency of each letter marking 8 crest or 8 trough approximetes to 8 fairly ClOSe degree the 
normal theoretical frequency of the assumed plain-text equivalent, then the initia.1 identification 
8,=E, 
msy be assumed to be correct and therefore the derived identificetions of the other cipher 
letters m8y be assumed to be correct. 
If the original starting point for assignment of plain-text 
vrrlues is not correct, or if the direction of “resding” 
the successive cresta and troughs of the 
cm 
Page 31

28 
distribution 
is not correct, then the frequencies of the other 25 cipher letters will not correspond 
to or even approximnte the norm81 theoretic81 frequencies of their hypotheticsl plain-text equiva- 
lents on the basis of the initial identificstion. 
A new initial point, that is, 8 different cipher 
equiv8lent must then be selected to represent ED; or else the direction of “reading” the crests and 
troughs must be reversed. 
This procedure, that is, the &tempt to make the actual frequency 
relations exhibited by uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
for 8 given cryptogram conform to the 
theoretic81 frequency relations of the norm81 frequency distribution 
in 8n effort to solve the 
cryptOgram, is referred to technically 8s “fitting 
the actual un.i.liters.l frequency distribution 
for 8 
cryptogram to the theoretical uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
for norm81 plain text”, or, more 
briefly, as “jEtinq the jrequency di&ibuticm 
for the cryptogram to the normal jrequency distribution”, 
or, still more briefly, “fling 
the dtitribufion 
Lo th.e norm&.” 
In statistical work the expression 
commonly employed in connection with this process of fitting 8n actual distribution 
to 8 the- 
oretical one is ‘%esting the goodness of fit.” 
The goodness of fit mfty be stated in vsrious ~8~9, 
m8them8&8l 
in character. 
c. In fitting the sctual distribution 
to the normal, it is necessary to regard the cipher corn- 
ponent (that is, the letters A . . . Z marking the successive crests and troughs of the distribution) 
8s partaking of the nature of 8 wheel or sequence closing in upon itself, so thst no matter with 
what crest or trough one starts, the spatial and frequency relations of the crests and troughs 8re 
constant. 
This manner of regarding the cipher component as being cyclic in nature is valid 
becuwe ir is obwiowt ihui the tetiive posiiiona and jreqwxwies

d. In the third sentence of subparsgrsph b, the phrase %ssumed to be correct” ~8s ad- 
visedly employed in describing the results of the sttempt to fit the distribution 
to the normal, 
because the final test of the goodness of fit in this connection (thst is, of the correctness of the 
assignment of values to the crests and troughs of the distribution) 
is whether the con&tent 
substitution 
of the plain-text values of the cipher characters in the cryptogram will yield intelli- 
gible plain text. 
If this is not the case, then no matter how close the approximstion 
between 
actual and theoretical frequencies is, no matter how well the act& 
frequency distribution 
fite 
the normal, the only possible inferences 8re that (1) either the closeness of the fit is 8 pure coin- 
cidence in this c8se, and that another equally good fit may be obtained from the same data, or 
else (2) the cryptogrsm involvea something more than simple mono8lphsbetic substitution

means of a single standard cipher alphabet. 
For example, suppose 8 transposition has been 
applied in addition to the substitution. 
Then, although an excellent correspondence between 
the uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
and the normal frequency distribution 
has been obtained, 
the substitution 
of the cipher letters by their assumed equivalents will still not yield plain text. 
However, aside from such csses of double encipherment, instances in which the uniliterai 
fr+ 
quency distribution 
may be easily fitted to the normal frequency distribution 
and in which at 
the same time an attempted simple substitution fails to yield intelligible text 8re rare. It may be 
said that, in practical operations whenever the unihteral frequency distribution 
c8n be made to 
fit the normal frequency distribution, 
substitution 
of values will result in solution; and, 8s a 
corollary, whenever the uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
cannot be made to fit the normal 
frequency distribution, 
the cryptogram does not represent a ca8e of simple, mono8lphsbetic 
substitution 
by means of a standard alphabet. 
18. Theoretical example of solation.--a. 
The foregoing principles will become clearer by 
noting the cryptographing and solution of a theoretical example. The following mess8ge is to be 
cryptographed.

d. Let the student now compare Figs. 6 and 7, which have been superimposed in Fig. 8 
for convenience in examination. 
Crests and troughs are present in both distributions; 
moreover 
their relative positions and frequencies have not been changed in the slight&t particular. 
Only 
the absolute position of the sequence 8s 8 whole has been displaced six intervals to the right in 
Fig. 7, as compared with the absolute position of the sequence in Fig. 6. 
ROuxn 8. 
e. If the two distributions 
are compared in detail the student will cle8rIy understand how 
easy the solution of the cryptogram would be to one who knew nothing about how it was prepared. 
For example, the frequency of the highest crest, representing E, in Fig. 6 is 28; at an interval of 
four letters before Ep there is another crest representing A, with frequency 16. Between A and E 
there is a trough, representing the low-frequency letters B, C, D. On the other side of E, at 8n 
interval of four letters, comes another crest, representing I with frequency 14. Between E and I 
there is another trough, representing the low-frequency letters F, G, H. Compare these crests 
and troughs with their homologous crests and troughs in Fig. 7. In the latter, the letter K 
marks the highest crest in the distribution 
with a frequency of 28; four letters before K there is 
another crest, frequency 16, and four letters tin the other side of K there is another crest, frequency

14. Troughs corresponding to B, C, D and F, G, H are seen at H, I, J and L, M, N in Fig. 7. In 
fact, the two distributions may be made to coincide exactly, by shifting the frequency distribution 
for the cryptogram six intervals to the left with respect to the distribution 
for the equivalent 
plain-text message, as shown herewith. 
j. Let us suppose now that nothing is known about the cryptographing 
process, and that 
only the cryptogram and its uniliteral frequency distribution 
is at hand. 
It is clear that simply 
bearing in mind the spatial relations of the crests and troughs in a normal frequency distribution 
would enable the cryptanalyst 
to fit the distribution 
to the normal in this case. He would 
naturally first assume that G,=A,, from which it would follow that if a direct standard alphabet 
is involved, Ha=Bp, Ic=Cp, and so on, yielding the following (tentative) deciphering alphabet: 
Cipher ____________ 
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N 0 P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
Plain ____________

g. Kow comes the final test: If these assumed values are substituted 
in the cipher text, 
the plain text immediately appears.

etc. 
h. It should be clear, therefore, that the select,ion of G, to represent A, in the cryptographing 
process has absolutely no effect upon the relative spatial and frequency relations of the crests 
and troughs of the frequency distribution 
for the cryptogram. 
If Q, had been selected to repre- 
sent A,, these relations would still remain the same, the whole series of crests and troughs being 
merely displaced further to the right of the positions they occupy when G,=A,.

At first glance the approximation 
to the expected frequencies seems fair, especially in the region 
FGHIJK,andRST,. 
But there are too many occurrences of b, P,, X, and C, and too few 
occurrences of A,, I,, ND, 0,. 
Moreover, if a substitution is attempted on this basis, the following 
is obtained for the first two cipher groups:

This is certainly not plain text and it seems clear that B, is not E,. 
A diflerent assumption will 
have to be made. 
(7) Suppose Qa=Ep. Going through the same steps as before, again no satisfactory results 
8re obtained. 
Further trials’ 8.re made along the s8me lines, until the assumptio& M,=E, is tested.

(8) The fit in this case is quite good; possibly there are too many occurrences of GD and MD 
nnd two few of Ev, 0, and S,. 
But the tial 
test remains: trial of the substitution alphabet on the 
cryptogram itself. 
This is immediately done and the results are as follows:

(9) It is always advisable to note the specific key. 
In this case the correspondence between 
any plain-text letter and its cipher equivalent will indicate the key. 
Although other conventions 
are possible, and equally valid, it is usual, however, to indicate the key by noting the cipher 
equivalent of A,. 
In this case A,=I,.

(2) The preliminary steps illustrated above, under subpar. a (1) to (4) inclusive, in connec- 
tion with the test for class and monoalphabeticity, 
will here be omitted, since they are exactly 
the same in nature. 
The result is that the cryptogram is obviously a substitution 
cipher and is 
monoalphabetic. 
(3) Assuming that it is not known whether a direct or a reversed standard alphabet is in- 
volved, attempts are at once made to fit the frequency distribution 
to the normal direct sequence. 
If the student will try them he will soon find out that these are unsuccessful. 
All this takes but a 
few minutes.

he will note that the relative positions and extensions of the crests and troughs are identicnl; 
they merely progress in opposite directions. 
20. Solution by completing the plain-component 
seqnence.-a. 
Z4.s case of direct standard 
alphabet ciphers.-(l) 
The foregoing method of analysis, involving as it does the construction of 
a uniliteral 
frequency distribution, 
was termed a soktion 
by the frequency method because it in- 
volves the construction of a frequency distribution 
and its study. 
There is, however, another 
method which is much more mpid, almost wholly mechanical, and which, moreover, does not 
necessitate the construction or study of any frequency distribution 
whatever. 
An understand- 
ing of the method follows from a consideration of the method of encipherment of a message 
by the use of a single, direct standard cipher alphabet. 
(2) Note the following encipherment:

(3) The enciphering alphabet shown above represents a case wherein the sequence of letters 
of both components of the cipher alphabet is the normal sequence, with the sequence forming the 
cipher component merely shifted six intervals in retard (or 20 intervals in advance) of the posi- 
tion it occupies in the normal alphabet. 
If, therefore, two strips of paper bearing the letters of 
the normal sequence, equally spaced, are regarded as the two components of the cipher alphabet 
and are juxtaposed at all of the 25 possible points of coincidence, it is obvious that one of these 
25 juxtapositions 
must correspond to the actual juxtaposition 
shown in the enciphering alphabet 
directly above .* It is equally obvious that if a record were kept of the results obtained by ap- 
plying the values given at each juxtaposition 
to the letters of the cryptogram, one of these results 
would yield t.he plain text of the cryptogram. 
(4) Let the work be systematized and the results set down in an orderly manner for exam- 
ination. 
It is obviously unnecessary to juxtapose the two componenta so that A,=A,, for on 
the assumption of a direct standard alphabet, juxtaposing two direct normal components at 
their normal point of coincidence merely yields plain text. 
The next possible juxtaposition, 
therefore, is A,=B,. 
Let the juxtaposition 
of the two sliding strips therefore be Ac=BD, as shown 
here:

The values given by this juxtaposition 
are substituted for the first 20 letters of the cryptogram

(6) Since each column in Fig. 11 is nothing but a normal sequence, it is obvious that instead 
of laboriously writing down these columns of letters every time a cryptogram is to be examined, 
it would be more convenient to prepare a set of strips each bearing the normal sequence doubled 
(to permit complete coincidence for an entire alphabet at any setting), and have them available 
for examining any future cryptograms. 
In using such 8 set of sliding strips in order to solve n 
cryptogram prepared by means of a single direct standard cipher alphabet, or to make a test to 
determine whether a cryptogram has beenso prepared, it is only necessary to “set up” the letters 
of the cryptogram on the strips, that is, align them in a single row across the strips (by sliding 
the individual 
strips up or down). 
The successive horizontal lines, called gene&rices (singular, 
gewatriz), 
are then examined in a search for intelligible 
text. 
If the cryptogram really belongs 
to this simple type of cipher, one of the genera&es 
will exhibit intelligible 
text all the way 
across; this text will practically invariably 
be the plain text of the message. This method of 
analysis may be termed a eolution by completing the pl&.-componcnt 
sequence. Sometimes it is 
referred to 8s “running 
down” the sequence. The principle upon which the method is based 
constitutes one of the cryptanalyst’s 
most valuable to01s.~ 
b. The cue of rever8ed standard dphubete.- 
(1) The method described under subpar. a may 
also be applied, in.slightly 
modified form, in the case of a cryptogram enciphered by a single 
reversed standard alphabet. 
The basic principles are identical in the two crises. 
(2) To show this it is necessary to experiment with two sliding components as before, except 
that in this case one of the components must be a reversed normal sequence, the other, a direct 
normal sequence. 
(3) Let’the two components be juxtaposed A to A, as shown below, and then let the resultant 
values be substituted for the letters of the cryptogram.

(6) It is seen that the letters of the “plain text” given by the seco& trial 8re merely the 
continuants of the normal sequences initiated by the letters of the “plain text” given by the first 
trial. 
If these sequences sre “run down”- 
that is, completed within the columns-the 
results 
must obviously be the same as though successive tests exactly similar to the first two were 
applied to the cryptogram, using one reversed normal and one direct normal component. 
If the 
cryptogram has really been prepared by means of a single reversed standard alphabet, one of 
the generatrices of the diagram that results from completing the sequences muat yield intelligible 
text. 
(7) Let the diagram be made, or better yet, if the student has already at hand the set of 
sliding strips referred to in the footnote to page 36, let him “set up” the letters given by the 
$rst trial. 
Fig. 12 shows the diagram and indicates the plain-text generatrix.

(8) The only difference in procedure between this case and the preceding one (where the 
cipher alphabet was a direct standard a.lphabet) is that the letters of the cipher text are first 
“deciphered” by means of any reversed standard alphabet and then the columns are “run down”, 
according to the normal A B C . . . Z sequence. For reasons which will become apparent very 
soon, the first step in this method is technically 
termed converting the cipher letters into their 
plain-component 
equiwlents; 
the second step is the s8me 8s before, dz, completing the plain-com-

81. Special remarks on the method of solution by completing the p&in-component sequence.- 
a. The terms employed to designate the steps in the solution set forth in Par. 20b, viz, “con- 
verting the cipher letters into their plain-component 
equivalents” 
and “completing the plain- 
component sequence”, accurately describe the process. Their meaning will become more clear 
as the student progresses with the work. 
It may be said that whenever the plain component of 
8 cipher alphabet is a known sequence, no matter how it is composed, the difliculty 
and time 
required to solve any cryptogram involving 
the use of that plain component is practically cut 
in half. 
In .some cases this knowledge facilitates, 
and in other c(Ises is the only thing that makes 
possible the aotution of a very short cryptogram 
that might othmwise &jy solution. 
Later on an 
example will be given to illustrate what is meant in this regard. 
b. The student should take note, however, of two qualifying expressions that were employed 
in a preceding paragraph to describe the results of the application of the method. 
It was stated 
that “one of the genera&es will exhibit intelligible text all the way across; this text will practically 
invariably be the plain text.” 
Will there ever be a case in which more than one generatrix will 
yield intelligible 
text throughout its extent? 
That obviously depends almost entirely on the 
number of letters that are aligned to form a generatrix. 
If 8 generatrix contains but a very few 
letters, only five, for example, it may happen as a result of pure chance that there will be two or 
more genera&es 
showing what might be “intelligible 
text.” 
Note in Fig. 11, for example, that 
there are several cases in which 3-letter and 4-letter English words (ANY, VAIN, GOT, TIP, etc.) 
appear on generatrices that are not correct, these words being formed by pure chance. But there 
is not a single case, in this diagram, of a 5-letter or longer word appearing fortuitously, 
because 
obviously the longer the word the smaller the probability 
of its appearnnce purely by chance; 
and the probabilit,y that two generatrices of 15 letters each will both yield intelligible text along 
their entire length is exceedingly remote, so remote, in fact, that in practical crpptography such 
a case may be considered nonexistent.’ 
c. The student should observe that in reality there is no difIerence whatsoever in principle 
between the two methods presented in subpars. a and b of Par. 20. In the former the preliminary 
step of converting the cipher letters into their plain-component equivalents is apparently not 
present but in reality it is there. 
The reason for its apparent absence is that in that case the 
plain component of the cipher alphabet is identical in all respects with the cipher component, so 
that the cipher letters require no conversion, or, rather, they are identical with the equivalents 
that would result if they were converted on the basis A,- -A,. 
In fact, if the solution process had 
been arbitrarily 
initiated by converting the cipher letters into their plain-component equivalents 
at the setting A,=O,, for example, and the cipher component slid one interval to the right there- 
after, the results of the first and second tests of Par. 20a would be as follows:

Thus, the foregoing diagram duplicates in every particular the diagram resulting from the first 
two tests under Par. 206: a first line of cipher letters, a second line of letters derived from them 
but showing externally no relationship with the 6rst line, and a third line derived immediately 
from the second line by continuing the direct normal sequence. This point is brought to attention 
only for the purpose of showing that a single, broad principle is the basis of the general method of 
solution by completing the plain-component 
sequence, and once the student has this firmly in 
. 
* A person with patience and 8n inclination 
toward the curioeitien of the science might conetruct 8 text of 15 
or more letters which would yield two “intelligible”

mind he will have no difficulty whatsoever in realizing when the principle is applicable, what a 
powerful cryptanalytic 
tool it can be, and what results he may expect from its application in 
specific instnnces. 
d. In the two foregoing examples of the application of the principle, the plain component 
wns a normal sequence but it should be clear to the student, if he has grasped what has been said 
in the preceding subparagraph, that this component may be a mixed sequence which, if known 
(that is, if the sequence of letters comprising the sequence is known to the cryptannlyst), 
can be 
handled just as readily as can a plain component that is a normal sequence. 
e. It is entirely immaterial at what. points the plain and the cipher components are juxtaposed 
in the preliminary step of converting the cipher letters into their plain-component equivalents. 
For example, in the case of the rerersed nlphabet cipher solved in Par. 20b, the two components 
were arbitrarily 
juxtaposed to give the value A=A, but they might have been juxtaposed at any 
of the other 25 possible points of coincidence without in any way affecting the final result, tiz, the 
production of one plain-text generatrix in the completion diagram. 
22. Value of mechanical solution as a short cnt.-u. 
It is obvious that the very first step 
the student should take in his attempts to solve nn unknown cryptogram that is obviously a 
substitution cipher is to try the mechanical method of solution by completing the plain-component 
sequence, using the normal alphabet, first direct, then reversed. 
This takes only a very few 
minutes nnd is conclusive in its results. 
It saves the labor and trouble of constructing a frequency 
distribution 
in case the cipher is of this simple type. 
Later on it will be seen how certain varia- 
tions of this simple type may also be solved by the application of this method. 
Thus, a very 
easy short cut to solution is afforded, which even the experienced cryptanalyst 
never overlooks 
in his first attack on an unknown cipher. 
6. It. is important 
now to note that if neither of fhe two foregoing 
attempts is successful in 
bringing 
plain 
text to light and the cryptogram is quite obviowly 
monoalphabetic 
in character, the 
cryptanalyst 
is warranted in assuming that the cyptogtam 
involves a mid 
cipher dphabet.l 
The 
steps to be taken in attacking a cipher of the latter type will be discussed in the next section. 
’ There is but one other possi ’ 
“t’ 
ity, already referred to under Par. 17d, which involvee the case where trans- 
position and monoalphadetic 
suhs itution 
processes have been applied in mcceasive steps. 
Thin b unusual, 
however, and will be discussed in its proper place.

23. Basic 
reason 
for the low degree of cryptographic security afforded by monoalphabetic 
cryptograms involving standard cipher alphabets.- 
The student hss seen that the solution of 
monoalphabetic cryptograms involving 
standard cipher alphabets is a very easy matter. 
Two 
methods of analysis were described, one involving 
the construction of a frequency distribution, 
the other not requiring this kind of tabulation, 
being almost mechanical in nature and corre- 
spondingly rapid. 
In the first of these two methods it was necessary to make a correct assumption 
as to the value of but one of the 26 letters of the cipher alphabet and the values of the remaining 
25 letters at once become known; in the second method it was not necessary to assume a value 
for even a single cipher letter. 
The student should understand wh t constitutes the basis of this 
situation, aiz, the fact that the two components of the cipher alp abet are composed of known 
% 
8equmcea. 
Whnt if one or both of these components are, for the cryptanalyst, unknown scquencee? 
In other words, what difbculties will confront the cryptanalyst 
if the cipher component of the 
cipher alphabet is a mixed sequence? Will such an alphabet be solvable as a whole at one stroke, 
or will it be necessary to solve its values individually. 7 Since the determination 
of the value of 
one cipher letter in this case gives no direct clues to the value of any other letter, it would seem 
that the solution of such a cipher should involve considerably more analysis and experiment than 
has the solution of either of the two types of ciphers so far examined occasioned. A typical 
example will be studied. 
24. Preliminary 
steps in the analysis of a monoalphabetic, mixed alphabet cryptogram.-

b. A casual inspection of the text discloses the presence of several long repetitions as well as 
of many letters of normally low frequency, such as F, G, V, X, and Z; on the other hand, letters of 
(46)

c. The fact that the frequency distribution 
shows very marked crests and troughs means 
that the cryptogram is undoubtedly 
monoalphabetic; 
the fact that it has already been tested 
(by the method of completing the plain-component sequence) and found not to be of the mono- 
alphabetic; standard-alphabet 
type, indicates with a high degree of probability 
that it involves 
a mixed cipher alphabet. 
A few moments might be devoted to making a careful inspection of the 
distribution 
to insure that it cannot be made to fit the normal; the object of this would be to 
rule out the possibility that the text resulting from substitution 
by a standard cipher alphabet 
had not subsequently been transposed. 
But this inspection in this case is hardly necessary, in 
view of the presence of long repetitions in the message.’ (See Par. 13g.) 
d. One might, of course, attempt to solve the cryptogram by applying the simple principles 
of frequency. 
One might, in other words, assume that Z, (the letter of greatest frequency) 
represents E,, D, (the letter of next greatest frequency) represents TD, and so on. 
If the message 
were long enough this simple procedure might more or less quickly give the solution. 
But the 
message is relatively short and many difllculties would be encountered. 
Much time and effort 
would be expended unnecessarily, because it is hardly to be expected that in a message of only 
235 letters the relative order of frequency of the various cipher letters should exactly coincide 
with, or even closely approximate the relative order of frequency of letters of normal plain text 
found in a count of 50,000 letters. 
It ie to be cmphagiud 
that the bcginn+w mud repress tk ndurd 
tendency 
to place too much ~~JWLCC in the generalized princip~ 
of frequency and to rely too much 
upon them. 
It is far better to bring into effective use certain other data concerning normal 
plain text which thus far have not been brought to notice. 
26. Further data concerning normal plain t&.-u. 
Just as the individual lettem constituting 
a large volume of plain text have more or less characteristic or fixed frequencies, so it is found 
that digraphs and &graphs 
have characteristic 
frequencies, when a large volume of text is 
studied statistically. 
In Appendix 1, Table 6, are shown the relative frequencies of all digraphs 
appearing in the 260 telegrams referred to in Paragraph 9c. It will be noted that 428 of the 676 
possible pains of letters occur in these telegrams, but whereas many of them occur but once or 
twice, there are a few which occur hundreds of times. 
b. In Appendix 1 will also be found several other kinds of tables and lists which will be useful 
to the student in his work, such as the relative order of frequency of the 50 digraphs of greatest

of this kind will be ditscuneed in a later text.

frequency, the relative order of frequency of doubled letters, doubled vowels, doubled consonants, 
and so on. 
It is suggested that the student refer to this appendix now, to gain an idea of the 
data available for his future reference. 
Just how these data may be employed will become ap 
parent very shortly. 
26. Reparation 
of the work sheet.-u. 
The details to be wnsidered in this paragraph may 
at first appear to be superfluous but long experience has proved that systematization of the 
work, and preparation of the data in the most utilizable, condensed form is most advisable, even 
if this seems to take considerable time. 
In the first place if it merely serves to avoid interrup- 
tions and irritations 
occasioned by failure to have the data in an instantly 
available form, it 
will pay by saving mental wear and tear. 
In the second place, especially in the case of com- 
plicated cryptograms, painstaking care in these details, while it may not always bring about 
success, is often the factor that is of greatest assistance in ultimate solution. 
The detailed 
preparntion of the data may be irksome to the student, and he may be tempted to avoid as much 
of it as possible, but, unfortunately, 
in the early stages of solving a cryptogram he does not know 
(nor, for that matter, does the expert always know) just which data are essential and which 
may be neglected. 
Even though not all of the data may turn out to have been necessary, as a 
general rule, time is saved in the end if all the usual data are prepared as a regular preliminary 
to the solution of most cryptograms. 
b. First, the cryptogram is recopied in the form of a work sheet. 
This sheet should be of a 
good quality 
of paper so as to withstand 
considerable erasure. 
If the cryptogram is to be 
copied by hand, cross-section paper of X-inch squares is extremely useful. 
The writing should 
be in ink, and plain, carefully made roman capital letters should be used in all cases. If the 
cryptogram is to be copied on a typewriter, the ribbon employed should be impregnated with an 
ink that will not smear or smudge under the hand. 
c. The arrangement of the characters of the cryptogram on the work sheet is a matter of 
considerable importance. 
If the cryptogram 
se first obtained is in groups of regular length 
(usually five characters to a group) and if the uniliteral frequency distribution 
shows the crypto- 
gram to be monoalphabetic, the characters should be copied without regard to this grouping. 
It is advisable to allow two spaces between letters, and to write a constant number of letters 
per line, approximately 25. At least two spaces, preferably three spaces, should be left between 
horizontal lines. 
Care should be taken to avoid crowding the letters in any case, for this is 
not only confusing to the eye but also mentally irritating 
when later it is found that not enough 
space has been left for making various sorts of marks or indications. 
If the cryptogram is origi- 
nally in what appears to be word lengths (and this is the case, as a rule, only with the cryptograms 
of amateurs), naturally 
it should be copied on the work sheet in the original groupings. 
If 
further study of a cryptogram shows that some special grouping is required, it is often best to 
recopy it on a fresh work sheet rather than to attempt to indicate the new grouping on the old 
work sheet. 
d. In order to be able to locate or refer to specific letters or groups of letters with speed, 
certainty, and without possibility of confusion, it is advisable to use coordinates applied to the 
lines and columns of the text as it appears on the work sheet. To minimize possibility of wn- 
fusion, it is best to apply letters to the horizontal lines of the text, numbers to the vertical wlumns. 
In referring to a letter the horizontal line in which the letter is located is usually given first. 
Thus, 
referring to the work sheet shown below, coordinates Al7 designate the letter Y, the 17th letter 
in the first line. 
The letter I is usually omitted from the series of line indicators 
so ss to avoid 
confusion with the figure 1 
If lines are limited to 25 letters each, then each’ set of 100 letters of 
the text is automatically 
blocked off by remembering that 4 lines constitute 100 letters. 
c. Above each character of the cipher text may be some indication of the frequency of that 
character in the whole cryptogram. 
This indication 
may be the actual number of times the

charecter occura, or, if colored pencils area used, the cipher letters may be divided up into three 
catagoriee or groups-high 
fkequency, medium frequency, and low frequency. 
It is perhaps 
simpler, if &rical 
help is 8Va8ble, 
to indicate the crctd 
frequencies. 
This saves constant 
reference to the frequency tablee, which interrupt8 the pain of thought, and s8ve8 considerable 
time in the end. 
f. After the special frequency distribution, 
explained in Par. 27 below, hss been constructed, 
repetitions of digraphs and trigr8phs should be underscored. 
In so doing, the student should be 
particuMy 
watchful of trigrnphic 
repetitions which can be further extended into tetragmphs 
8nd polygraph8 of greater length. 
Repetitions of more than ten characters should be set off by 
heavy vertical lines, 8s they indicste 
repeated phr8ses and 8re of considerable assistance in 
solution. 
If a repetition continues from one line to the next, put 8n srrow at the end of the 
underscore to signal this fact. 
Reversible digraphs should also be indicated by an underscore 
with 8n arrow pointing in both directions. 
Anything 
which strikes the eye as being peculiar, 
unusual, or sign&ant 
88 regards the distribution 
or recurrence of the characters should be 
noted. 
All these marks should, Tf convenient, be made with ink so as not to cause smudging. 
The work sheet will now appear a8 shown herewith (not 8ll the repetition8 are underscored): 
27. Triliteral-frequency 
distribution&--a. 
In what h88 gone before, 8 type of frequency 
distribution 
known 8s a uniliteral frequency distribution 
~88 used. This,.of course, shows only 
the number of times esch individual 
letter occurs. 
In order to apply the normal digraphic and

trigraphic frequency data (given in Appendix 1) to the solution .of 8 cryptogram of the type now 
being studied, it is obvious that the dat8 with respect to digraphs and trigraphs occurring in the 
cryptogram 
should be compiled and should be compared with the data for normal plain text. 
In 
order to accomplish this in suitable mauner, it is advisable to construct a slightly more com- 
plicated form of distribution 
termed a #ri&fer~ jrepucw 
dihbuiiun.I 
b. Given a cryptogram of 50 or more letters and the task of determining what trigraphs are 
present in the cryptogram, there are three ways in which the data may be arranged or assembled. 
he may require that the data show (1) each letter with its two succeeding letters; (2) each letter 
with its two preceding letters; (3) each letter with one preceding letter and one succeeding letter. 
c. A distribution 
of the first of the three foregoing types may be designated 8s a “triliter8l 
frequency distribution 
showing two su6xes”; 
the second type may be designated as a “tri- 
literal frequency distribution 
showing two preks”; 
the third type may be designated as 
a “trihteral 
frequency distribution 
showing one prefix and one sufhx.” 
Quadriliteral 
and 
pentaliteral 
frequency distributions 
may occasionally be found useful. 
d. Which of these three arrangements is to be employed at a specific time depends largely 
upon what the data are intended to show. 
For present purposes, in connection with the solution 
of 8 monoalphabetic substitution cipher employing a mixed alphabet, possibly the third arrange- 
ment, that showing one prefix and one suffk, is most satisfactory. 
e. It is convenient to use )/r-inch cross-section paper for the construction of 8 triliterd 
fre- 
quency distribution 
in the form of 8 distribution 
showing crests snd troughs, such 8s that in 
Figure 14. 
In that figure the prefk to esch letter to be recorded is inserted in the left half of the 
cell directly above the cipher letter being recorded; the su5x to each letter is inserted in the right 
half of the cell directly above the letter being recorded; and in each case the prefix and the 
sufhx to the letter being recorded occupy the came cell, the prefix being directly to the left of the 
sufk 
The number in parentheses gives the total frequency for each letter. 
* Heretofore such a dimtribution hes been termed I, ‘Wgraphlc 
frequency table.” 
It b thought that the word 
“trilitera1” 
ie more suitable, to correspond with the deeigmtioa 
“uniliteral” 
in the mae of the distribution 
of the 
single lettem. 
A trigraphlc 
distribution 
of A B C D E F would condder only the trigr~phs A B C and D E F, 
whereas a triliteral 
distribution 
would conalder the groups A B C, B C D, C D E, and D E F.

j. The trihter8l frequency distribution 
ia now to be ex8mined with 8 view to B 
. . 
what digrspha and trigraphs occur two or more times in the cryptogram. 
Conaider the pair 
of colunms containing the prefixes and sufTixes to D, in the distribution, 
8s shown in Fig. 14.

The nature of the triliteral 
frequency distribution 
is such that in tiding 
what digraphs 8re 
present in the cryptogram it is immaterial 
whether the prefke8 or the sufhxes to the cipher 
letters 8re studied, so h 
as 07~ ie consistcnf in tlu dudy. 
For example, in the foregoing list of 
digraphs based on the prefixes to D,, the digr8phs FD, ZD, ZD, VD, etc., sre found; if now, the 
student will refer to the sufhxes of F,, Z,, V,, etc., he will fl.nd the very s8me digmphs indicated. 
This being the cam, the question m8y be raised &B to what value there is in listing both the 
prefixes 8nd the suffixes to the cipher letters. 
The 8nswer is that by so doing the trigrsphs 8re 
indicated at the 88918 time. 
For example, in the ca8e of D,, the following trigrsphs 8re indic8ted: 
FDZ, ZDY, ZDS, VDF, ADZ, YDZ, BDV, ZDF, IDZ, 
ZDF, YDZ, BDV, ZDF, 
ZDZ, ZDT, CDZ, ZDO, YDZ, VDG, SDZ, GDI, ZDF, IDE. 
g. The repeated digraphs 8nd trigraphs can now be found quite re8dily. 
Thus, in the MUM 
of D,, ex8miuing the list of digraphs based on sufiixes, the following repetitions are noted: . 
DZ 8ppMUS 
9 times 
DF appeare 5 time8 
DV 8pp68IS 
2 times 
Examhhg 
the trigr8phs with D, 8s central letter, the following repetitions Ive noted: 
ZDF 8ppearS 
4 time8 
mz 
8pp08l’il3 
tiIlX!8 
BDV 8ppeSre 
2 time8 
A. It is unnecessary, of course, to go through the detailed procedure set forth in the pre- 
ceding subparagraphs in order to find 8ll the repested digmpha and trigr8phs. 
The repeated 
trigraphs ,with D, as central letter ~811 be found merely from an inspection of the prefixes and 
eufkee opposite D, in the distribution. 
It ia nectary 
only to find those ~(~888 in which two or 
more prefixes 8re identical at the sBme time th8t the su&es 8re identical. 
For example, the 
distribution 
shows at once that in four c.aees the prefix to D, is Z, at the s8me time that 
the 
su5x to this letter is F, 
Hence, the trigraph ZDF appears four times. 
The repeeted trigraphs 
may all be found in this manner. 
i. The most frequently 
repested digraphs and tiiphs 
8re then seeembled in what is 
termed 8 condt~nsc& #ubk of repd&mu, so aa to bring this information prominently before the eye. 
As a rule, digr8phs which occur lese than four or five times, end trigrnphs which occur less than 
three or four time8 may be omitted from the condensed table 8a being relstivaly of no importsnce 
in the study of repetitions. 
In the condensed tsble the frequencies of the individual 
letters 
forming the most important digraphs, trigr8ph8, etc., should be indic8ted. 
28. Classifying the cipher letters into vowelr and con8onant8.--u. 
Before proceeding to 8 
detailed analysis of the repeated digraphs and trigr%phs, 8 very important step c8n be taken which 
will be of assistance not only in the analysis of the repetitions but aleo in the final solution of 
the cryptogram. 
This step conceder the cksification 
of the high-frequency 
letters into two

groups-qowels 
and consonante. 
For if the cryptanalyet can quickly 88c&ain the equivalents 
of the four vowele, A, E, I, end 0,8nd of only the four consonanta, 
N, R, S, and T, he will then 
have the value8 of approximatiy 
two-thirds of 8ll the cipher letter8 th8t oocur in the cryptognun; 
the valuea of the rena8ining letters can almoet be filled in automatically. 
b. The belie for the chusificetion will be found to reet upon a comparatively simple phs 
nomenon: the 88eociational or combiitory 
behavior of vowel8 is, in general, quite Merent 
from that of coneonsnte. 
If an examination be m8de of Table 7-B in Appendix 1, showing the 
relative order of frequency 
of the 18 digmphs compokng 25 percent of English telegraphic text, 
it will be 8een that the letter E e&era into the composition of 9 of the 18 digraphs; that i8, in 
exactly half of all the ~8888 the letter E is one of the two lettare forming the digmph. 
The 
digr8phs conkining 
E 8re a8 fo~ow8: 
ED 
EN 
ER 
Es 
NE 
RE 
SE 
TE 
VE 
The rem8ining nine digrapha 8re 88 follows:

E. Nom of tlu 18 digraphe ir a c-m&W

Note now that of the 9 combin8tions 
with E, 7 8re with the coneonanta N, R, S, end T, one ia with D, one ie with V, and MW ie &A any 
oszwl. In other words, & combines most readily with con8on8uta but not with other voweh+ or 
even with itself. 
Using the terma often employed in the chemical analogy, E show8 a great 
%5ity” 
for the consonaate N, R, S, T, but not for the vowels. 
Therefore, if the lettera of higheat 
frequency occurring in a given cryptogmm 8re Wed, together with the number of timea each of 
them combines with the cipher equivalent of ED, thoee which 8how considerable combining power 
or 85&y 
for the cipher equivalent of & may be assumed to be the cipher equivalenti of N, R, S, 
TD; those which do not chow any affinity for the cipher equivalent of & may be sseumed to be the 
cipher equivalent8 of A, I, 0, U,. 
Applying these principles to the problem in hand, and ezsmin- 
ing the triliter8l 
frequency dietribution, 
it is quite certain that Z,=$, 
not only beccruee Z, is the 
lettar of highest frequency, but also because it combinea with Ural 
other high-frequency let&m,

It ie clear that D, 
must be a consonant. 
In the s8me way, coneider T,, which chows 9 combinations with Z,, 4 in the

29. Further analysis of the letters representing vowels and oonsonants.-u. 
0, is usually 
the vowel of second highest frequency. 
Is it possible to determine which of the letters V, H, S, I, 
is the cipher equivalent of O,? Let reference be made again to Table 6 in Appendix 1, where it 
is seen that the 10 most frequently occurring diphthongs are: 
Diphthong __-___ IO 
OU EA EI 
AI 
IE 
AU EO AY

If V, H, S, I, are really the cipher equivalents of A, I, 0, U, (not respectively), perhaps it is possible 
to determine which is which by examining 
the combinduns 
fhcy make among thcmdwa 
and with 
Z, (=E,J. 
Let the combinations of V, H, S, I, and Z that occur in the message be listed. 
There 
are only the following: 
z&l4 
HI-I 
w-I-2 
m-1 
HH-1 
IS-1 
ZZ, is of coume q. 
Note the doublet HH,; if H, is a vowel, then the chances are excellent that 
H,=O, because the doublets AA,, II,, UU,, are practically nonexistent, 
whereas the double vowel 
combination 00, is of next highest frequency to the double vowel combination w. 
If H,=O,, 
then V, must be I, because the digraph VH, occurring two times in the message could hardly be 
AO,,, or UO,, whereas the diphthong IO, is the one of high frequency in English. 
So far then, the 
tentative (because so far unverified) results of the analysis are as follows: 
Z,=E, 
Ho=O, 
V,=I, 
This leaves only two letters, I, and S, (already classified as vowels) to be separated into A, and 
U,. 
Note the digraphs: 
HIo=08, 
SV,=BI, 
1s,=ee, 
Only two alternatives are open: 
(1) Either I,=& 
and S,=U,, 
(2) or 
I,=&, 
and &=A,. 
If the first alternative is selected, then 
HI,=OA, 
SV,=UI, 
IS,=AU, 
If the second alternative is selected, then 
HI,=OU, 
SV,=AI, 
IS,=UA, 
The eye finds it diflicult to choose between these alternatives; but suppose the frequency valuea of 
the plain-text diphthongs as given in Table 6 of Appendix 1 are added for eachof these alternatives, 
giving the following: 
HI,=O&, 
frequency value= 
7 
HI,=OU,, frequency value=37 
SV,=UI,, 
frequency value= 
5 
SV,=AI,, 
frequency value=17

Mathematically, 
the second alternative is more than twice as probable a the first. 
Let it be 
assumed to be correct and the following (still tentative) 
values 
are now at hand: 
Z,=E, 
H,=O, 
Vc=ID 
&=A, 
I,=& 
b. Attention 
is now directed to the letters classified as consonants: 
How far is it possible 
to ascertain their values? 
The letter D,, from considerations of frequency alone, would seem 
to be TD, but its frequency, 23, is not considerably greater than that for T,. 
It is not much 
greater than that for F, or G,, with a frequency of 19 each. But perhaps it is possible to ascer- 
tain not the value of one letter alone but of two letten at one stroke. 
To do this one may make 
use of a tetragraph of considerable importance in English, oiz, TION,. 
For if tbe analysis per- 
taining to the vowels is correct, and if VH,- -IO,, 
then an examination of the letters immediately 
before and after the digraph .W, in the cipher text might disclose both Tp and ND. Reference 
to the text gives the following: 
me 
Me 
8108, 
em, 
The letter T, follows VH, in both cases and very probably indicates that T,=N,; but as to whether 
G, or F, equals Tp cannot be decided. 
However, two conclusions are clear: first, the letter D, 
is neither TD nor ND, from which it follows that it must be either R, or !&,; second, the letters 
G, and F, must be either T, and Sp, respectively, or S, and Tp, respectively, because the only 
tetragraphs usually found (in English) containing the diphthong IO, as central letters are SION, 
and TION,,. This in turn means that as regards D,, the latter cannot be either R, or S,; it must 
be Rp, a conclusion which is corroborated by the fact that ZDo (=ER,) and DZ, (=w) 
occur 9 
times each. Thus far, then, the identifications, 
when inserted in an enciphering 
alphabet, nre 
8s follows:

30. Substituting 
deduced values in the oryptogram.-u. 
Thus far the analysis has been 
almost purely hypothetical, 
for as yet not a single one of the values deduced from the foregoing 
analysis has been tried out in the cryptogram. 
It is higb time that this be done, because the 
final test of the validity of the hypotheses, assumptions, and identifications made in any crypto- 
graphic study is, after all, only this: do these hypotheses, assumptions, and identifications 
ultimat,ely yield verXable, intelligible 
plain-text when consietently applied to the cipher text? 
b. At the present stage in the process, since there are at hnnd the assumed values of but 9 
out of the 25 letters that appear, it is obvious that a continuous “reading” 
of the cryptogram 
can certainly not be expected from a mere insertion of the values of the 9 letters. 
However, the 
substitution 
of these values should do two things. 
First, it should immediately disclose the 
fragments, outlines, or “skeletons” of “good” words in the text; and second, it should disclose 
no places in the text where “impossible” 
sequences of letters are established. 
By the first is 
meant that the partially 
deciphered text should show the out.lines or skeletons of words such 
as may be expected to be found in the communication; 
this will become quite clear in the next 
subparagraph. 
By the second is meant that sequences, such aa “AOOEN” or “TNRSENO” or the 
like, obviously not possible or extremely unusual in normal English text, must not result from 
the substitution 
of the tentative identifications 
resulting from the analysis. 
The appearance 
of several such extremely unusual or impossible sequences at once sign.&% that one or more of 
the assumed values is incorrect.

b. The solution should, as a rule, not be considered complete until an attempt has been 
made to discover all the elements underlying the general system and the specific key to a message. 
In this case, there is no need to delve further into the general system, for it is merely one of 
monoalphabetic substitution 
with a mixed cipher alphabet. 
It is necessary or advisable, how- 
ever, to reconstruct the cipher alphabet because this may give clues that later may become 
valuable. 
c. Cipher alphabets should, as a rule, be reconstructed by the cryptanalyst 
in the form of 
enciphwing 
alphabets because they will then usually be in the form in which the encipherer 
used them. 
This is important for two reasons. First, if the sequence in the cipher component 
gives evidence of system in its construction or if it yields clues pointing toward its derivation 
from a keyword or a key-phrase, this may often corroborate the identifications 
already made 
and may lead directly to additional identifications. 
A word or two of explanation is advisable 
here. For example, refer to the skeletonized enciphering alphabet given at the end of par. 29b: 
Plain___________ ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
Cipher -_--- 
S 
Z 
V 
TH 
DGFI 
FG 
Suppose the cryptanalyst, 
looking at the sequence DGFI or DFGI in the cipher component, sus- 
pects the presence of a keyword-mixed 
alphabet. 
Then DFGI is certainly a more plausible 
sequence than DGFI. 
Again, noting the sequence S . . . Z . . . V . . . . TH . . D, he might 
have an idea that the keyword begins after the Z and that the TH is followed by AB or BC. This 
would mean that either P, &=A, 
B, or B, C,. Assuming that P, Q,=A, B,, he refers to the fre- 
quency distribution 
and tlnds that the assumptions PD= A, and &=B, 
are not good; on the other 
hand, assuming that P, &=B, 
C,, the frequency distribution 
gives excellent corroboration. 
A trial of these values would materially 
hasten solution because it is often the case in crypt 
analysis that if the value of a very low-frequency letter can be sureIy established it will yield 
clues to other values very quickly, 
Thus, if & is definitely identified it almost invariably 
will 
identify U,, and will give clues to the letter following the &,, since it must be a vowel. 
In the 
case under discussion the identification 
PQ,=BC, would have turned out to be correct. 
For the 
foregoing reason an attempt should always be made in the early stages of the analysis to deter- 
mine, if possible, the basis of construction or derivation of the cipher alphabet; as a rule this 
can be done only by means of the enciphering alphabet, and not the deciphering alphabet. 
For 
example, the skeletonized d&ph.tting 
alphabet corresponding 
to the enciphering alphabet 
directly above is as follows: 
Cipher -________ ABCDEFGHIJKLYNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
Plain-----,, 
R 
TSOU 
AN 
I 
E 
ST 
Here no evidences of a keyword-mixed 
alphabet are seen at all. 
However, if the enciphering 
alphabet hss been examined and shows no evidences of systematic construction, the deciphering 
alphabet should then be examined with this in view, because occasionally it is the deciphering 
alphabet which shows the presence of a key or keying element, or which has been systematically 
derived from a word or phrase. The second reason why it is important to try to discover the basis 
Page 56

53 
of construction or derivation of the cipher alphabet is that it &ords clues to the general type of 
keywords or keying elements employed by the enemy. This is a psychological factor, of course, 
and may be of s&stance in subsequent studies of his traffic. It merely gives a clue ta the general 
type of thinking indulged in by certain of his cryptographers. 
d. In the case of the foregoing solution, the complete enciphering alphabet is found to be es 
follows: 
P18iIl______________ 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
Cipher ___________ 
SUXYZLEAVNWORTHBCDFGIJKMP 
Obviously, the letter Q, which is the only letter not appearing in the cryptogram, should follow 
P in the cipher component. 
Note now that the latter is based upon the keyword LEAVENWORTH, 
and that this particular cipher alphabet has been composed by shifting the mixed sequence based 
upon this keyword five intervals to the right so that the key for the message is &=S,. 
Note 
also that the deciphering alphabet fails to give any evidence of keyword construction based upon 
the word LEAVENWORTH.

c. If neither the enciphering or the deciphering alphabet exhibits charact&stics 
which 
give indication of derivation from 8 keyword by some form of mixing or disarrangement, the 
latter is nevertheless not finally excluded as a possibility. 
The st,udent is referred to Section IX 
of Elementary Mdita y Cyptography, 
wherein will be found methods for deriving mixed alphabets 
by transposition methods applied to keyword-mixed alphabets. 
For the reconstruction of such 
mixed alphabets the cryptanalyst 
must use ingenuity 
and a knowledge of the more common 
methods of suppressing the appearance of keywords in the mixed alphabets. 
32, General notes on the foregoing solntion.--a. 
The example solved above is admittedly 
a more or less artificial illustration 
of the steps in analysis, made so in order to demonstrate 
general principles. 
It WBB essy to solve because the frequencies of the various cipher letters cor- 
responded quite well with the normal or expected frequencies. 
However, sll cryptograms of 
the s8me monoalphabetical nature can be solved along the same general lines, after more or less 
experimentation, 
depending upon the length of the cryptogram, the skill, and the experience of 
the cryptanalyst. 
b. It is no cause for discouragement if the student’s initial attempts to solve a cryptogram of 
this type require much more time and effort than were apparently required in solving the fore- 
going purely illustrative 
exsmple. 
It is indeed rarely the case that mey assumption made by the 
cryptanalyst 
proves in the end to have been correct; more often is it the c8se that a good many 
of his initial assumptions 8re incorrect, and that he loses much time in casting out the erroneous 
ones. The speed and facility with which this elimination process is conducted is in many cases 
8l.l that distinguishes the expert from the novice. 
c. Nor will the student always find that the initial classification into vowels and consonanta 
c8n be accomplished as easily and quickly 8s WBB apparently the c8se in the illustrative 
example. 
The principles indicated 8re very general in their nature and applicability, 
and there 8re, in 
addition, some other principles that may be brought to becu in c8ae of difficulty. 
Of these, per- 
haps the most useful 8re the f&owing: 
(1) In normal English it is unusual to find two or three consonants in succession, esch of high 
frequency. 
If in 8 cryptogrsm 8 succession of three or four letters of high-frequency appear in 
succession, it is practically certain that at least one of these represents 8 vowel.a

(2) Succeesions of three vowels 8re rather unusual in English.’ 
Pr8ctic8Uy the only time 
this happens is when a word ends in two vowels and the next word begins with a vowel.’ 
(3) When two letters 
already

81% separated by a sequence of 
six or more letters, it is either the c88e th8t one of the supposed vowel-equiv8lent.e is incorrect, 
or else that one or more of the intermediate letters is a vowekquivalent:

wry, the underscoring of 8ll repetitions of several letters is very essential, (LB it calls attention to 
peculiarities of structure that often yield clues. 
6. After 8 few bssic sseumptions of values have been made, if short words or skeletons of 
words do not become manifest, it is necessary to make further assumptions for unidentified letters. 
This is accomplished most often by 8ssumin.g a word .l 
Now there are two pl8ces in every message 
which lend themselves more re8dily to aucceasful8ttBCh by the seeumption of worde than do 
any other places-the 
very beginmng and the very end of the meeeege. The re8son is quite 
obvious, for although words may begin or end with aknost any letter of the alphabet, they 
usually begin and end with but a few very common digmphs and trigruphs. 
Very often the 
aasocistion of letters in peculiar combinations will enable the student to note where one word 
ends and the next begins. 
For erample suppose, E, N, S, and T have been detitely 
identified, 
8nd a sequence like the following 
ia found in a cryptogram: 
ENTSNE 
Obviously the break between ko’wo& 
should fsll either*8f& 
the S of E NT S or sftetr the T 
ofENT,so 
that two possibilities are offered:. 
. . ENTS/NE.. 
., or.. 
. ENT/SNE 
. . . . Since in English there are very few words with the initial t&graph S N E, it is most 
likely 
that the proper division is . . . E N T S / N E . . . . Obviously, when several word 
divisions have been found, the sohrtion is more readily 8chieved because of the grester e8se with 
which resumptions of sdditiond 
new values may be made. 
SS. The “probable word” method ; its v8lae and rpplicabilfty.-o. 
In practic8hy all cryptan- 
alytic studies, short-cute c8n often be made by assuming the presence of certain words in the 
m-8 
under study. 
some writers attech so much value to this kind of 8n “attack from the 
rear” that they pnscticay 
elevate it to the position of 8 method and 4 
it the “intuitive 
method” 
or the “probablaword 
method.” 
It is, of course, merely 8 refinement of wh8t in everyday 
hnguage is c&d 
“assuming” or tcgue@sing” 8 word in the messsge. The value of m8king 8 
“good gued 
can hardly be overestimated, 
end the cryptanalyst 
should never f& 
that he is 
8ccomphshing 8 solution by an illegitimate 
subterfuge when he h8s made 8 fortunate guess 
leading to .solution. 
A wrrect assumption 8s to plain text will often s8ve hours or days of labor, 
end sometbnes there is no &ern8dve 
but to try to “guess 8 word”, for occeaiomdy 8 system is 
encountered the solution of which is Absolutely dependent upon this 8rtitlc.e. 
b. The expression “good guess” is used advisedly. 
For it is “good” in two respects. First, 
the cryptanalyst 
must use o8.m in making his seeumptions as to plain-text words. 
In this he 
must be guided by extraneous &cunist8nces 
lesding to the 8ssumption of probable words-not 
just any words that come to his mind. 
Therefore he must use his imsgination 
but he must 
nevertheless carefully control it by the exercise of good judgment. 
Second, only if the “guess” 
is cmrect and le8ds to solution, or at le8st pute him on the road to BOhIfiOn, ia it 8 good guess. 
But, while re8hxing the usefulness and the time md Mor-esving 
features of a solution by 8ssum- 
ing a probable word, the oryptan8lyst 
should exercise discretion in regard to how long he may 
continue in his efforts with this method. 
Sometimes he may actually waste time by 8dherin.g 
to the method too long, if etmightforward, 
methodical 8ns.lysis will yield rezmlta more quickly. 
e. Obviously, 
the “probablsword” 
method has much more SppliCSbi&y when working 
upon mate&l 
the general nature of which is known, than when working upon more or lea 
isolated communications exchanged between correspondents concerning whom or whose activities

nothing is lmown. 
For in the latter c8se there is little or nothing that the’ imagination c8n seize 
upon 8s a background or basis for the assumptions.* 
d. Very frequently, 
the choice of probable words is aided or limited by the number and 
positions of repectted letters, 
These repetitions may be pa&n..+that 
is, externally visible in 
the cryptographic text as it originally stands-or 
they may be latent-that 
is, externally invisible 
but susceptible of being made patent as a result of the analysis. 
For example, iu a mono8lpha- 
betic substitution 
cipher, such M that discussed in the preceding p8r8gr8ph, the repeated letters 
8re directly exhibited in the cryptogram; 
later tho student will encounter many csses in which 
the repetitions are latent, but are made patent by the analytical process. When the repetitions 
8re patent, then the p&tern or fonnvla 
to which the repeated letten conform is of direct use 
in assuming plain-text words; snd when the text is in word-lengths, the pattern is obviously of 
even greater a,saistance. Suppose the cryptanalyst 
is dealing with military 
text, in which case 
he may expect such words 8s DIVISION, 
BATTALION, etc., to be present in the text. 
The 
positions of the repeated letter I in DIVISION, 
of the reversible digraph AT, TA in BATTALION, 
and so on, constitute for the experienced cryptanalyst 
tell-tale indications of the presence of 
these words, even when the text is not divided up into its original word lengths. 
c. The important aid that a study of word patterns csn afford in cryptesalysis warranta the 
use of definite terminology and the establishment of certain data having 8 bearing thereon. The 
phenomenon herein under discussion, namely, that many words 8re of such construction as 
regards the number and positions of repeated letters aa to make them readily identifiable, will be 
termed idiomorphism (from the Greek Wios”=one’s 
own,individual,peculiar+“morphe”=form). 
Words which show this phenomenon will be termed idiomotphic. 
It will be useful to deal with 
the idiomorpbisms symbolically 
and systematically 
&B described below. 
j. When dealing with cryptograms in which the word lengths are determined or specifically 
shown, it is convenient to .indicate their lengths and their repeeted letters in some easily recog- 
nized mazLIler or by formulas. 
This is exemplified, in the case of the word DIVISION, by the 
formula ABCBDBEF; in the case of the word BATTALION, by the formula ABCCBDEFG. If the 
cryptanalyst, 
during the course of his studies, makes note of striking formulas he has encoun- 
tered, with the words which fit them, after some time he will have assembled a quite valuable 
body of data. 
And after more or less complete lists of such formulas have been established in 
some Systematic srrangement, 8 rapid comparison Of the id.iOmOIphs in 8 Specific CryptOgr8m 
with those in his lists will be feasible and will often lead to the assumption of the correct word. 
Such lists can be aRanged according to word length, as shown herewith: 
3/&a 
: DID, 
EVE, EYE. 
abb 
: ADD, ALL, ILL, 
OFF, etc. 
4/abac

84. Solution of additional cryptograms produced by the same cipher component.--a. 
To 
return, after a rather long digression, to. the cryptogram solved in pars. 28-31, once the cipher 
component of a cipher alphabet has been reconstructed, subsequent mess8ges which hsve been 
enciphered by means of the s&me cipher component may be solved very readily, and without 
recourse to the principles of frequency, or application of the probable-word method. 
It has been 
seen that the illustrative 
cryptogram treated in paragraphs 24-31 wss enciphered by juxtaposing 
the cipher component rrgainst the normal sequence so &et A,=&. 
It is obvious that the cipher 
component may be set against the plein component at any one of 26 different points of coinci- 
dence, each yielding a diflerent cipher alphabet. After a cipher component hss been reconstructed, 
however, it becomes a knovm sequence, and the method of converting the cipher letters into their 
plain-component 
equivalents 
and then completing the plain-component 
sequence begun by 
e8ch equivalent can be applied to solve sny cryptogram which has been enciphered by that 
cipher component, 
b. An exsmple will serve to make the process clear. Suppose the following message, psssing 
between the same two stations 8s before, ~8s intercepted shortly sfter the first message had 
been solved: 
IYEWK 
CERNW 
OFOSE 
LFOOH 
EAZXX 
It is assumed that the s8me cipher component was used, but with 8 d&rent 
key letter. 
First 
the initial 
two groups 8re converted into their plaincomponent 
equivalents by setting the 
cipher component against the normal sequence at any arbitrsrg 
point of coincidence. 
The 
inhid letter of the former may 8s well be set @nst 
A of the latter, with the following result:

95. Analysis 02 multiliteral, 
monoalphabetic substitution eptema.-a. Substitution methods 
in general may be classified into uniliteral 
and multiliteral 
systema 
In the former there is a 
strict “one-to-one” correspondence between the length of the unite of the plain and those of the 
cipher text ; that is, each letter of the plain text is replaced by a single character in the cipher text. 
In the latter this correspondence is no longer l,:l, 
but may be 1,: 2,, where each letter of the plain 
text is replaced by a combination of two characters in the cipher text; or 1,: 3,, where a 3-character 
combination in the cipher text represente a single letter of the plain text, and so on. 
A cipher in 
which the correspondence of the l,:l, 
type is termed uniliteral 
in character; one in which it is of 
the l,:2, type, biliteral; 
1,:3,, trilitaral, 
and so on. 
Those beyond the l,:l, 
type are classed to- 
gether as mulWera1. 
b. When a multiliteral 
system employs biliteral equivalents, the cipher alphabet is said to be 
bipartite. 
Such alphabets are composed of a set of 25 or 26 combinations of a limited number of 
characters taken in pairs. 
An example of such an alphabet is the following.

obviously have all the characteristics of a dimple, uniliteral 
distribution 
for a monoalphabetic 
substitution 
cipher. 
d. Ciphers of this type, as well a8 of those of the multiliteral 
(triliteral, quadraliteral, 
. . .) 
type are readily detected externally by virtue of the fact that the cryptographic text is composed 
of but a very limited number of diflerent characters. 
They are handled in exactly the same man- 
ner as are uniliteral, 
monoalphabetic substitution 
ciphers. 
So long a8 the 8ame character, or 
combination of characters, is always u8ed to represent the same plain4ext letter, and so long a8 a 
given letter of the plain text is always represented by the same character or combination of 
characters, the substitution is strictly monoalphabetic and can be handled in the simple manner 
described under Par. 31 of this text. 
I. An interesting example in which the cipher equivalents are quinqueliteral 
groups and yet 
the resulting cipher is strictly monoalphabetic in character is found in the cipher system invented 
by Sir F’rancis Bacon over 300 years ago. Despite its antiquity 
the system possesses certain 
features of merit which are well worth noting. 
Bacona proposed the following cipher alphabet, 
composed of permutations of two elements taken five at a time: * 
A=aaaaa 
IJ=abaaa 
&aaaab 
E=abaab 
C=aaaba 
L=ababa 
D=aaabb 
Mababb 
-baa 
N=abbaa 
F=aabab 
oabbab 
G=aabba 
P=abbba 
H=aabbb 
Q=abbbb 
R=baaaa 
SIbaaab 
wbaaba 
U-V=baabb 
W=babaa 
X=babab 
Y=babba 
Z=babbb 
If this were all there were to Bacon’s invention it would be hardly worth bringing to attention. 
But what he pointed out, with great clarity and dimple examples, was how euch an alphabet 
might he used to convey a secret message by enfolding it in an innocent, external message which 
might easily evade the etrictest kind of censorship. 
Bs a very crude example, suppose that a 
message is written in capital and lower ca8e letters, any capital letter standing for an “a” element 
of the cipher alphabet, and any emall letter, for a “b” element. 
Then the external eentance 
“All 
is well 
with 
me today” 
can be made to contain the secret message ttHelp.ll 
Thus:

P 
Instead of employing such an obvious device 88 capital snd small letters, suppose that an “a” 
element be indicated by a very alight shading, or a very slightly heavier stroke. 
Then a secret 
message might easily be thus enfolded within an external message of exactly opposite meaning. 
The number of possible variations of this besic scheme is very high. 
The fact that the characters

During the campaign for the presidential election of 1876 
many cipher messages were exchanged between the Tilden managers and their agents in several 
states where the voting was hotly contested. Two years later the New York Tribune 4 exposed 
many irregularities in the campaign by publishing the decipherments of many of these messages. 
These decipherments were achieved by two investigators employed by the Tribune, and the 
plain text of the messages seems to show that illegal attempts and mensurca to carry the election 
for Tilden were made by his managers. 
Here is one of the messages: 
’

Examination of the message discloses that only ten d.Serent letters are used. It is probable, 
therefore, that what one has here is a cipher which employs a bipartite alphabet and in which 
combinations of two letters represent single letters of the plain text. 
The message ia therefore 
rewritten in pairs and substitution 
of arbitrary letters for the pairs is made, as seen below: 
PP YY 
EN NS NY W 
PI 
MA SH NS YY 
SS 
etc. 
ABCDEBFGHDB

etc. 
A triliteral 
frequency distribution 
is then made and analysis of the message along the lines 
illustrated in the preceding section of this text yields solution, as follows:

87. Purpoee of providing multiple-equivalent cipher dphabetr.-u. 
It haa been seen that 
the charscteristic frequencies of letters composing normal plain text, the sssoci8tions they form 
in combining to form words, and the peculiarities certain of them manifest in such text & &ord 
direct clues by means of which ordinary monoalphabetic substitution 
encipherments 
of such 
plain text may be more or less speedily solved. 
This hs,s led to the introduction 
of hple 
methods for disguising or suppressing the manifestations of monoaJphsb&i&y, 
80 far 88 po&ble. 
Basically these methods 8re multiliter8l 
and they will now be presented. 
b. Multilitera.l 
substitution may be of two types: (1) That wherein e8ch letter of the p& 
text is represented by one and only one multiliteral 
equivalent. 
For eurmple, in the Fnrnci,e 
Bacon cipher described in Par. 35c, the letter & is invsriably 
represented by the permut8tion 
abaab. 
For this resaon this type of system may be more completely described 8s nunwalphtz- 
betic, mu&&ml 
eubatitution 
with aingk~idd 
cipicct alphabeta. 
(2) That wherein, because of the large number of equivalenta made available by the com- 
binations snd permutations of a limited number of elements, each letter of the plain text may be 
represented by several multiliter8l 
equivalents which may be selected at random. 
For example, 
if 3-letter combinations 8re employed there are available 26’ or 17,576 equivalents for the 26 
letters of the plain text; they may be essigned in equal numbers of dilferent equiv8lent.a for the 
26 letters, in which case each letter would be representable by 676 different 34etter equivalents; 
or they may be assigned on some other basis, for example, proportionately to the relative 
frequencies of plain-fext letters. 
For this reason this Qpe of systcun may be more completely 
described aa a monoolpldetic, 
mdtdiietal 
B1Lbsti.tutiun with a mu&l+qui~ent 
cipher alphabet. 
Some authora term such a system 9imple substitution with multiple equivalents”; 
others term 
it monodphabatk aubsttitiion 
wi4h curia&. 
For the sake of brevity, the latter designation will 
be employed in this text.’ 
c. The primary object of monoslphsbetic 
substitution 
with variants is, as has been men- 
tioned above, to provide several values which may be employed at random in a simple substitution 
of cipher equivalenta for the plain-text lettera. 
In this connection, reference is made to Section 
X of Elcmcntary 
Militaq 
ctyplography, 
wherein several of the most common methods for 
producing and using variants are set forth. 
1 My attention 
has been called to the contradiction 
in terminology 
involved in the designation 
“monoalpha- 
betic substitution 
with varianb”, 
and when judged by my own definition 
of the term, ILB given in Elemen&ary 
Mdila+y Cryplogrophy, it mu& be admitted 
that the criticism is warranted. 
8yetem.s employing 
complefe cipher 
alphabets which form the b&s 
for the choice of variant 
values are, strictly 
speaking, not monoalphabetic 
but 
polyalphabetic 
in nature. 
But what shall be said of those systems in which there are no complete cipher alphabets 
for the selection of alternative 
or variant 
valuea but only a few variants for the high-frequency 
letters? 
I recog- 
nlxs, of course, that w 
or difllculty 
in the solution of specific type8 of systems should not be the determining 
factor in a systematic 
nomenclature 
in cryptography. 
The equation X*X 16 is not designated a linear equation 
because it is easy to solve; it is designated a quadratic equation and although it is easier to solve than x*+x= 
16 
it is a quadratic 
nevertheless. 
The analogy is, of course, clear: a system which is technically 
polyalphabetic 
should not be designated monoalphabetic 
because it is usually easier to solve than a polyalphabetic 
system. 
Indeed, there are systems of monoalphabetic 
substitution 
with variants which are more difficult to solve than 
certain types of polyalphabetic 
systems, for example, those using several standard alphabets in a cyclic manner. 
However, the designation 
“monoalphabetic 
substitution 
with variants” 
ham become so firmly established in the 
literature 
and is so deecriptive of the actual process followed in encipherment 
that I hesitate to change it at this 
date in favor of some le8s deecriptive 
but more accurate designation, 
such as “multiliteral 
substitution 
with 
multiple-equivalent 
cipher dph&eta”, 
although I hcoc used it as the title of this section.

d. A word or two concerning the underlying theory from the cryptanalytic 
point of view of 
monoalphabetic substitution 
with variants, may not be amiss. Whereas in simple or single- 
equivalent, monoalphabetic substitution it ia seen that- 
(1) The same letter of the plain text is invariably 
represented by but one and always the 
came character of the cryptogram, and 
(2) The same character of the cryptogram invariably 
represents one and always the same 
letter of the plain text; 
In multiliteral 
substitution 
with multiple equivalents (monoalphabetic substitution 
with 
variants) it is seen that- 
(1) The same letter of the plain text may be represented by one or more d&went characters 
of the cryptogram, but 
(2) The same character of the cryptogram nevertheless invariably represents one and always 
the same letter of the plain text. 
38. Solution 02 a simple example.-& 
The following cryptogram has been enciphered by a 
set of four alphabets similar to the following:

The keyword here is TRIP I. In enciphering a message the equivalents are to be selected at 
random from among the four variants for each letter. 
The steps in solving a message produced 
by such a scheme will now be scrutinized.

b. Agsumiug that the foregoing remarks had not been made and that the cryptogram haa 
just been submitted for solution with no information 
concerning it, the tit 
step is to make a 
preliminary study to determine whether the cryptogram involves cipher or code. The crypto- 
gram appears in !%gu.re groups, which may indicate either cipher or code. A few remarka will 
be made at this point with reference to the method of determiniug whether a cryptogram com- 
posed of figure groups is in code or cipher, using the foregoing example. 
c. In the first place, if the cryptogram contains an even number of digits, as for example 
494 in the foregoing message, this leaves open the possibility that it may be cipher, composed of 
247 pairs of digits; were the number of digits an exact o&f multiple of five, such &8 125,135,&c., 
the possibility that the cryptogram is in code of the 5-figure group type must be considered. Next, 
a preliminary study is made to see if there are many repetitions, and what their characteristics

fo the lowest number in en& line of the diagram ahowing the cipher alphabeta

are. If the cryptogram is code of the 5-figure group type, then such repetitions as appear should 
gcnerdly be in whole groups of five digits, and they should be visible in the text just as the mes- 
sage stands, unless the code message has undergone encipherment also. 
If the cryptogram is in 
cipher, then the repetitions should extend beyond the 5digit groupings; if they conform to any 
definite groupings at all they should for the most part contain even numbers of digits since each 
letter is probably represented by a pair of digits. 
If no clues of the foregoing natureare present, 
doubts will be dissolved by making a detailed study of frequencies. 
d. A simple 4-part frequency distribution 
is therefore decided upon. Shall the alphabet be 
assumed to be a 25- or a 26-character one? If the former, then the 2digit pairs from 01 to 00 
fall into exactly four groups each corresponding to an alphabet. 
Since this is the most common 
scheme of drawing up such alphabets, let it be assumed to be true of the present case. The 
following distributions result from the breaking up of the text into 2digit pairs. 
c. If the student will bring to bear upon this problem the principles he learned in Section V 
of this text, he will soon realize that what he now has before him are four, simple, monoalpha- 
betic frequency distributions 
similar to those involved in a monoalphabetic substitution 
cipher 
using standard cipher alphabets. 
The realization of this fact immediately provides the clue to 
the next step: “fitting 
each of the distributions 
to the normal.”

g. From the detailed procedure given above, the student should be able to draw his own 
conclusions as to the procedure to be followed in solving cryptograms produced by methods 
which are more or less aimple variations of that just discussed. In this connection he is referred 
to Section X of R&aty 
Military 
Oyptography, 
wherein a few of these variations are mentioned. 
li. Possibly the most important 
of the variations is that in which 8 rectangle such (LB that

In the solution of cases of this kind, repetitions would play their usual role, with the modifications 
noted below in Par. 39. Once an entering wedge has been forced, though 
the identification 
of one or more repeated words such as BATTALION, DIVISION, 
etc., the entire encipher+ 
matrix would soon be reconstructed. 
It may be added that the frequency distribution 
for 
the text of a single long message or several short ones enciphered by such a system would show 
characteristic phenomena, the most important 
of which are, &st, that the distribution 
for a 
matrix such as shown in Fig. 17 would practically 
follow the normal and, second, that the 
distribution 
for the 2d digit of pairs would show more marked crests and troughs 
than the 
distribution 
for the 1st digit. 
For example, the initial digits 1,4, and 7 (for the numbers l&19, 
40-49, and 70-79, inclusive) would apply to the distribution 
for the letters A to J, inclusive; the 
initial digits 2, 5, and 8 would apply to the distribution 
for the letters K to T, inclusive. 
The 
total weighted frequency values for these two groups of letters are about equal. 
Therefore, 
the frequencies of the initial 
digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 would be approximately 
equal. 
But 
consider the final digit 5 in the numbers 15, 45, 75, 25, 55, and 85; its t&d 
frequency 
b corn- 
posed of the sum of the frequencies of E,, 0,, and Y,, two of which are high-frequency letters; 
whereas in the case of the final digit 6, its total frequency is composed of the sum of the frequencies 
of F,, P,, and Z,,, all of which are low-frequency letters. 
The two cases would show a marked 
difference in frequency, in the proportion 
of 1319+844+208=2371 
to 205-j-243+6=454, 
or 
about 5 to 1. Of course, the letters may be inserted within the enciphering matrix in a keyword- 
mixed or even in a random order; the numbers may be applied to the rectangle in a random 
order. 
But these variations, while increasing the difficulty in solution, by no means make the 
latter as great as may be thought by the novice. 
30. Solution of a more complicated example.-a. 
As soon as a beginner in cryptography 
realizes the consequences of the fact that letters are used with greatly varying frequencies 
in normal plain text, a brilliant 
idea very speedily comes to him. 
Why not disguise the 
natural 
frequencies of letters by a system of substitution 
using many equivalents, 
and let 
the numbers of equivalents assigned to the vnrious letters be more or less in direct proportion 
to the normal frequencies of the letters? Let E, for example, have 13 or more equivalents; T, 10; 
N, 9; etc., and thus (he thinks) the enemy cryptanalyst 
can have nothing in the way of tell-tale 
or characteristic frequencies to use as an entering wedge. 
b. If the text available for study is small in amount and if the variant values are wholly 
independent of one another, the problem can become exceedingly difficult. 
But in practical 
military communications such methods are rarely encountered, because the volum of tezf is wdy 
great enough to permif 
of the establishmen 
oj equG&eni u&es. 
To illustrate 
what is meant, 
suppose a set of cryptograms produced by the monoalphabetic-varinnt 
method described above 
shows the following two sets of groupings in the text: 
SET A 
SET B 
12-37-02-79-68-13-03-37-77 
71-12-02-51-2345-77

91-05-02-01-68-42-78-37-77 
97-12-51-02-78-69-77 
An examination of these groupings would lead to the following tentative conclusions with regard 
to probable equivalents: 
12, 82, 91 
01, 16, 79 
03, 23, 78 
05, 37, 69 
13, 42, 68 
35, and 77 
02, and 51 
The establishment of these equivalencies would sooner or later lead to the finding of additional 
sets of equal values. 
The completeness with which this can be accomplished will determine

the ease or difficulty 
of solution. 
Of course, if many equivalencies can be established the 
problem can then be reduced practically 
to monoalphabetic terms and a speedy solution can 
be attained. 
c. Theoretically, 
the determination 
of equivalencies may seem to be quite an easy matter, 
but practically it may be very dif%cult, because the cryptanalyst 
can never be certain that a 
combination showing what may appear to be a variant value is really such, and is not a diflerent 
word. 
For example, take the groups- 
17-82-31-82-14-63,and 
27-82-40-82-14-63 
Here one might suspect that 17 and 27 represent the same letter, 31 and 40 another letter. 
But 
it happens that one group represents the word MANAGE, the other DAMAGE. 
d. When reversible combinations are used as variants, the problem is perhaps a bit more 
simple. 
For example, using the accompanying Fii. 
18 for encipherment, two messages with 
the same initial words, REFERENCE YOUR, may be enciphered as follows: 
K,Z 
Q,V 
B,H 
M,R

The experienced cryptanalyst, 
noting the appearance of the very first few groups, assumes that 
he is here confronted with a case involving biliteral reversible equivalents, with v&ants. 
e. The probable-word method of solution may be used, but with a slight variation intro- 
duced by virtue of the fact that, regnrdless of the system, letters of low jrequency 
in plain 
tert 
remain 
infrequent. 
Hence, suppose a word containing low-frequency 
letters, but in itself a 
rather common word strikingly 
idiomorpbic in character is sought as a “probable word”; for 
example, words such as CAVALRY, ATTACK, and zRE@RE. 
Writing such a word on a slip of 
paper, it is slid one inte;aiat 
a time under the text, which has been marked so that the high 
and low-frequency characters are indicated. 
Each coincidence of a low-frequency letter of the 
text with a low-frequency letter of the assumed word is examined carefully to see whether the 
adjacent text letters correspond in frequency with the other letters of the assumed word; or, if 
the latter presents repetitions, whether there are correspondences between repetitions in the 
text and those in the word. 
Many trials are necessary but this method will produce results 
when the difficulties are otherwise too much for the cryptanalyst 
to overcome. 
40. A subterfuge to prevent decomposition of cipher text into component units.-u. 
A few 
words should be added with regard to certain subterfuges which are sometimes encountered in 
mononlphabetic 
substitution 
with variants, and which, if not recognized in time, cause con- 
siderable delays. 
These have to deal with the insertion of nulls so aa to prevent the cryptanalyst 
from breaking up the text into its real cryptographic 
units. 
The student should take careful

note of the last phrase; the mere insertion of symbols having the same characteristics as the 
symbols of the cryptographic 
text, except that they have no menning, is not what is meant. 
This class of nulls rarely achieves the purpose for which they are intended. 
m-hat is really meant 
can best be explained in connection with an example. 
Suppose that a 5 x 5 checkerboard design 
with the row and column indicators shown in Fig. 19 is adopted for encipherment. 
Normally, 
the cipher units would consist of 2-letter combinations of the indicators, invariably 
giving the 
row indicator first (by agreement).

These would normally then be arranged in 5-letter groups, thus: 
VIEBP 
HIUFT 
IEABT 
MWOPW 
GT... 
b. It will be noted, however, that only 20 of the 26 letters of the alphabet have been employed 
as row and oolumn indicators, leaving J, K, Q, X, Y, and Z unused. 
Now, suppose these five letters 
are used as nulls, not in pairs, but a.s individual 
let2et.s inserted at random just before the real text is 
arranged in B-letter groups. 
Occasionally, a pair of nulls is inserted. 
Thus, for example: 
VIEXB 
PHKIU 
FJXTI 
EAJBT 
MWOQP 
WGKTY 
The cryptanalyst, 
after some study, suspecting a biliteral cipher, proceeds to break up the text 
into pairs: 
VI 
EX BP HK IU FJ XT IE AJ BT MW OQ PW GK TY 
Compare this set of P-letter combinations with the correct set. Only 4 of the 15 pairs are “proper” 
units. 
It is easy to see that without a knowledge of the etitence 
of the nulls, and even with a 
knowledge, if he does not know which letters are nulls, the cryptanalyst would be confronted with 
a problem for the solution of which a fairly large amount 
of text might be necessary. The 
careful employment of the variants also very materially adds to the security of the method be- 
cause repetitions can be rather effectively suppressed. 
c. From the cryptographic standpoint, the fact that in this system the cryptographic text 
is more than twice as long 85 the plain text constitutes a serious disadvantage. 
From the 
cryptanalytic 
standpoint, the masking 
of the cipher units constitutes the most important source 
of strength of the system; this, coupled with the use of variants, makes it a bit more diflicult 
system to solve, despite its monoalphabeticity.

41. Monographic and polygraphic substitution 
systems.+. 
The student is now referred 
to Sections VII and VIII 
of Advanced Mililary 
Cryptography, 
wherein polygraphic systems of 
substitution 
8re discussed from the cryptographic 
point of view. 
These will now be discussed 
from the cryptsnaiytic 
point of view. 
b. Although the essential differences between polyliteral 
and polygraphic substitution 
8re 
treated with some detail in Section VII of Advanced Military 
Cryptography, 
8 few additional 
words on the subject may not be amiss at this point. 
c. The two primary divisions of substitution 
systems into (1) uniliteral 
and multilitersl 
methods and into (2) monographic and polygraphic methods are both bssed upon considerations 
as to the number of elements constituting 
the plain-text and the equivalent cipher-text units. 
In 
uniliteral as well 8s in monographic substitution, 
each plain-text unit consists of a single element 
end each cipher-text unit consists of a single element. 
The two terms &literal 
and mono- 
graphic 8re therefore identical in signifkance, as defined cryptographklly. 
It is when the 
terms mukihter8l 
and polygraphic 8re examined that 8n essential difference is seen. In multi- 
literal substitution 
the plain-text 
unit always consists of 8 single element (one letter) and the 
cipher-text unit consists of 8 group of two or more elements; when bihteral, it is 8 pair of elements, 
when triliteral, 
it is a set of three elements, and so on. 
In what will herein be designated 8s 
true or complete polygraphic substitution 
the plain-text 
unit consists of two or more elements 
forming an indivisible 
compcund; the cipher-text unit usually consists of 8 corresponding number 
of elements.’ 
When the number of elements comprising the plain-text umts is fixed and always 
two, the system is digraphic; 
when it is three, the system is trigraphic; 
when it is four, tetra- 
graphic; and so on.’ 
It is important 
to note that in true or complete polygraphic substitution 
the elements combine to form indivisible 
compounds having properties Werent 
from those of 
either of the constituent letters. 
For example, in unilitersl substitution 
ABD may yield XY, and 
AC, may yield XZ,; but in true digraphic substitution m 
may yield xy, and AC, may yield Ga. 
A difference in identity of one letter affects the whole result.’ 
An analogy is found in chemistry, 
when two elements combine to form a molecule, the latter usually having properties quite 
different from those of either of the constituent elements. 
For example: sodium, 8 metal, and 
1 The qualifying 
adverb “ueually” 
ie employed beeauae. thie correspondence is not essential. 
For example, 
if one should draw up a set of 676 arbitrary 
eingle signe, it would be poaaible to represent the O-letter paim from 
AA to ZZ by single symbols. 
This would still be a digraphic ryrtem. 
r In this cenee a code system is merely a polygraphic 
eubatitution 
ryetern in which the number of elements 
constituting 
the plain-text 
unite b variable.

chlorine, 8 gas, combine to form sodium chloride, common table salt. 
Furthermore, sodium 8nd 
fluorine, 8lso 8 gas similar in many respects to chlorine, combine to form sodium fluoride, which 
is much d%erent from table salt. 
Partial and pseudo-polygraphic substitution 
will be treat&d 
under subparsgraphs d and c below. 
d. Another way of looking at polygraphic substitution is to regard the elements comprising 
the plain-text 
units as being enciphered individually 
and polyalphabetically 
by a fairly large 
number of separate alphabets. 
For example, in a digraphic system in which 676 pairs of plsin- 
text letters are representable by 676 cipher-text pairs assigned at random, this is equivalent to 
having a set of 26 different alphabets for enciphering one member of the pairs, and another set 
of 26 different nlphabets for enciphering the other member of the pairs. 
According to this 
viewpoint the different alphabets are brought into play by the particular combination of letters 
forming each plain-text pair. This is, of course, quite different from systems wherein the various 
alphabets are brought into play by more definite rules; it is perhaps this very absence of definite 
rules guiding the selection of alphabets which constitutes the cryptographic strength of this type 
of polygraphic syst,em. 
e. When regarded in the light of the preceding remarks, certain systems which at first glance 
seem 
t,o be polygraphic, in that groupings of plain-text 
letters are treated as units, on closer 
inspection are seen to be only partially 
polygraphic, or pseudo-polygraphic in character. 
For 
example, in a system in which encipherment is by pairs and yet one of the letters in each pair is 
enciphered monoalphabetic.ally, the other letter, polyalphabeticnlly, 
the method is only psuedo- 
polygraphic. 
Cases of this type are shown in Section VII of Advanced Militay 
Gyptography. 
Again, in a system in which encipherment is by pairs and the encipherments of the left-hand 
and right-hand members of the pairs show group relat.ionships, this is not pseudo-polygraphic 
but only partially 
polygraphic. 
Cases of this type are also shown in the text referred to above. 
f. The fundamental purpose of polygraphic substitution 
is again the suppression of the 
frequency chnracteristics of plain text, just as is the case in monoalphabetic substitution 
with 
variants; but here this is accomplished by a different method, the latter arising from a somewhat 
different approach to the problem involved in producing cryptographic security. 
When the sub- 
stitution involves replacement of single letters in a monoalphabetic system, the cryptogram 
can 
be solved rather readily. 
Basically the reason for this is that the principles of frequency and the 
laws of probability, 
applied to individual 
units of the text (single letters), have a very good 
opportunity 
to manifest themselves. A given volume of text of say n plain-text letters, enciphered 
purely monoalphabetically, 
affords n cipher cha.racten, and t.he same number of cipher units. 
The same volume of text, enciphered digraphically, 
still affords n cipher characters but only 
n 3 cipher units. 
Statistically speaking, the sample within which the laws of probability now apply 
has been cut in half. 
Furthermore, 
from the point of view of frequency, the very noticeable 
diversity in the frequencies of individual 
letters, leading to the marked crests and troughs of 
the unihternl frequency distribution, 
is no longer so strikingly in evidence in the frequencies of 
digraphs. 
Therefore, although true digraphic encipherment, for example, cuts the cryptographic 
textual units in half, the di5culty 
of solution is not doubled, but, if a matter of judgment arising 
from practical experience can be expressed or appro.ximated mathematically, squared or cubed. 
g. Sections VII and VIII of Advanced Military 
Cryptography 
show various methods for the 
derivation of polygraphic equivalents and for handling these equivalents in cryptographing 
and 
decryptographing 
messages. The most practicable of those methods are digraphic in character 
and for this reason their solution will be treated in a somewhat more detailed manner than will 
trigraphic methods. The latter can be passed over with the simple statement that their analysis 
requires much text to permit of solution by the frequency method, and hard labor. Fortunately, 
they are infrequently 
encountered because they are diflicult 
to manipulate without extensive

tables.’ 
If the latter are required they must be compiled in the form of a book or pamphlet. 
If 
one is willing to go that far, one might as well include in such document more or less extensive lists 
of words and phrases, in which case t,he system falls under the category of code snd not cipher. 
42. Tests for identifying 
digrsphic substitution.-u. 
The tests which are applied tc deter- 
mine \vhether a given cryptogram is digraphic in character are usually rather simple. 
If there 
are many repetitions in the cryptogram and yet the uniliteral-frequency 
distribution 
gives no 
clear-cut indications of monoalphabeticity; 
if most of the repetitions contain an even number 
of letters; and if the cryptogram contains an even number of letters, it may be assumed to be 
digraphic in nature. 
b. The student should first try tc determine whether the substitution is completely digraphic, 
or only partially 
digraphic, or pseudo-digraphic in character. 
As mentioned nbove, there are 
cases in which, although the substitution is effected by taking pairs of letters, one of the members 
of the pairs is enciphered monoalphabetically, 
the other member, polyalphabetically. 
A dis- 
tribution 
based upon the letters in the odd positions and one based upon those in the even 
positions should be made. If one of these is clearly monoalphabetic, then this is evidence that the 
message represents a case of pseudo-digrnphism of the type here described. 
By attacking the 
monoalphabetic portion of the messages, solution can soon be reached by slight variation of the 
usual method, the polyalphabetic 
portion being solved by the aid of the context and considera- 
tions based upon the probable nature of the substitution 
chart. 
(See Tables 2, 3, and 4 of 
Advanced Military 
Oyptography.) 
It will be noted that the charts referred to show definite 
symmetry in their construction. 
c. On the other hand, if the foregoing steps prove fruitless, it may be assumed that the 
cryptogram is completely digraphic in character. 
d. Just a8 certain statistical tests may be applied to a cryptogram to establish its mono- 
alphsbeticity, 
so also may a statistical test be applied to n cryptogram for the purpose of estab- 
lishing its digraphicity. 
The nature of this test and its method of application will be discussed 
in 8 subsequent text. 
43. Genera1 procedure in the analysis of tiigraphic substitution ciphers.+. 
The analysis of 
cryptograms which have been produced by digraphic substitution 
is accomplished largely by 
the application of the simple principles of frequency of digraphs, with the additional aid of such 
special circumstances as may be known tc or suspected by the cryptanalyst. 
The latter refer 
to peculiarities which may be the result of the particular 
method employed in obtaining the 
equivalents 
of the plain-text 
digraphs in the cryptographing 
process. In general, however, 
only if there is sufficient text tc disclose the normal phenomena of repetition will solution be 
feasible or possible. 
b. However, when a digraphic system is employed in regular service, there is little doubt 
but that traffic will rapidly accumulate to an amount more than sufficient to permit of solution 
by simple principles of frequency. 
Sometimes only two or three long messages, or a half dozen 
of average length are sufficient. 
For with the identification 
of only a few cipher digraphs, 
larger portions of messages may be read because the skeletons of words formed from the few 
high-frequency digraphs very definitely limit the values that can be inserted for the intervening 
unidentified 
d&graphs. For example, suppose that the plain-text 
digraphs TH, ER, IN, IS, OF, 
NT, and TO have been identified by frequency considerations, corroborated by a tentatively 
identified long repetition; and suppose 8ls.o that the enemy is known to be using a quadricular

table of 676 cells containing digraphs showing reciprocal equivalence between plain and ciphcr- 
text digraphs.

inserted) :

The words FOURTH INFANTRY REGIMENT are readily recognized. 
The reciprocnl pairs EL, 
and LE, suggest ATTACK. The beginning of the message is now completely disclosed: 
FOURTH 
INFANTRY REGIMENT NOT YET IN POSITION TO ATTACK. The values more or less automati- 
cally determined are VO,=uR,, AL,=TY,,, HN,=ET,, VL,=PO,, OZ,=TI,, 
YW,=CK,. 
c. Once a good start has been made and a few words have been solved, subsequent work 
is quite simple and straightforward. 
A knowledge of enemy correspondence, including data 
regarding its most common words and phrases, is of great assistance in breaking down new 
digraphic tables of the same nature but with different equivalents. 
d. The foregoing remarks also apply to the details of solution in cases of partially 
digraphic substitution. 
44. Analysis of digrapbic substitution ciphers based upon 4-square checkerboard matrices- 
a. In Section VIII 
of Advanced Military 
Cryptography 
there are shown various examples of di- 
graphic substitution 
based upon the use of checkerboard designs. These may be considered 
cases of partially 
d&graphic substitution, 
in that in the checkerboard system there are certain 
relationships 
between plain-text 
digraphs having common elements and their corresponding 
cipher-text d&graphs, which will also have common elements. 
For example, take the following 
a-square checkerboard matrix: 
BWGRMOPAUL

20. 
Here BC,=OW,, BO,=OF,, BS,=OP,, BG,=ON, and BT,=OD,. 
In each case when B, is the initial 
letter of the plain-text pair, the initial letter of the cipher-text equivalent is 0,. This, of course, 
is the direct result of the method; it means that the encipherment is monoalphabetic for the 
Page 77

74 
first half of each of these&e plain-text pairs, polyalphabetic for the second half. 
This relation- 
ship holds true for jour other groups of pairs beginning with Bp. In other words, there are five 
alphabets employed, not 25. Thus, this case differs from the case discussed under Par. 42b 
only in that the monoalphabeticity 
is not complete for one-half of all the pairs, but only among 
the members of certain groups of pairs. 
In a completely digraphic system using a 676-tell 
mndomized matrix, such relationships are entirely absent and for this reason the system is 
cryptographically 
more secure than the checkerboard system. 
b. From the foregoing, it is clear that when solution has progressed sufficiently to disclose 
a few values, the insertion of letters within the cells of the checkerboard matrix to give the plain- 
text and cipher relationships indicated by the solved values immediately leads to the disclosure 
of additional values. Thus, the solution of only a few values soons leads to the breakdown of 
the entire matrix. 
c. (1) The following example will serve to illustrate the procedure.

Since there are quite a few repetitions, two of considerable length, since all but one of them 
contain an even number of letters, and since the message also contains an even number of letters, 
344, digraphic substitution 
is suspected. 
The cryptogram is transcribed in P-letter groups, for 
greater convenience in study. 
It is as follows:

It is noted that all the repetitions listed above break up properly into digraphs except in 
one case, viz, FEQQ in lines C, D, and F. 
This seems rather strange, and at first thought one 
might suppose that a letter was dropped out or was added in the vicinity of the FEQQ in line D. 
But it is immediately seen that the FE QQ in line D has no relation at all to the . F EQ Q. in 
lines C and F, and that the F EQ Q in line D is merely an accidental repetition.

(5) A digrapbic frequency distribution 
b is made and is shown in Fii. 22. 
ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
(6) The appearance of the foregoing distribution 
for this message is quite characteristic of 
that for 8 digraphic substitution 
cipher. 
There are many blank cells; although there are many 
cases in which a digrsph appears only once, there are quite a few in which a digraph appears 
two or three times, four casea in which a digraph appeare four times, and two cases in which a 
digraph appears five times. 
The absence of the letter J is also noted; this is often the case in a 
digrnphic 
system 
based upon 
a checkerboard 
matrix. 
6 The distinction 
between %graphic” 
and %iiteral” 
t bseed upon the following 
corAderation. 
In a 
bilateral (or diliteral) 
dietribution 
every two successive letters of the text would be grouped together to form a 
pair. 
For example, a biiteral 
distribution 
of ABCDEF would tabulate thepaha AB, BC, CD, DE, and EF. 
In a 
digraphic 
distribution 
only Bucceasive pain of the text are tabulated. 
For example, 
ABCDEF would yield only 
AB, CD, and EF.

(7) In another common type of checkerboard system known 8s the Playfair cipher, described 
in Par. 46, one of the telltale indications besides the absence of the letter J is the absence of double 
letters, that is, two successive identical letters. 
The occurrence of the double letters GG, HH, 
and QQ in the message under investigation 
eliminates the possibility 
of its being a Playfsir 
cipher. 
The simplest thing to Bssume is that 8 4-square checkerboard is involved. 
One with 
normal alphabets in Sections 1 and 2 is therefore set down (Fig. 23a). 
. 
(s) The recurrence of the group QMLF, three times, and at intervals suggesting that it might 
be a sentence separator, leads to the assumption that it is the word STOP. The letters Q, M, L, 
and F are therefore inserted in the appropriate cells in Sections 3 and 4 of the diagram. 
Thus

These plscements eeem logical. 
Moreover, in Section 3 the number of cells between L and 
Q is just one less thsn enough to contain 8l.l the letters M to P, inclusive, and suggests thst either 
N or 0 is in the keyword portion of the sequence, that is, near the top of Section 3. Without 
making 8 commitment in the matter, suppose both N and 0, for the present, be inserted in the 
cell between M and P. Thus (Fig. 23~):

(9) Now, if the plscement of P in Section 3 is correct, the cipher equivalent of TH, will be 
PfJ,, 8tid there should be 8 group of 8deqU8te frequency to correspond.

(11) So far no impossible combinations are in evidence. 
Beginning with group H4 in the 
message is seen the following sequence: 
PNFNPN 
TH. 
.TH 
Assume it to be THAT THE. Then AT,=FN,, and the letter N is to be inserted in row 4 column 1. 
But this is inconsistent with previous aesumptions, since N in Section 4 has already been tenta- 
tively plsced in row 2 c&mn 4 of section 4. Other assumptions for FN, are made: that it is, 
IS,(THISTH...);thstifisEN,(THENTH... 
); but the same inconsistency is spparent. 
In fact 
tbe student will see that FN, must represent 8 digr8ph ending in F, G, H, I-J, or K, since N, is 
tentatively 
located on the same line as these letters in Section 2. Now FN, occurs 4 times in 
the message. The digraph it represents mu..& be one of the following: 
DF, DG, DH, DI,

Of these the only one likely to be repeated 4 times is OF, yielding T H 0 F T H which msy be 
PNFNPN

NORTHOFTHE. 
CQLQPNFNPNIT 
Or 
SOUTHOFTHE 
~QLQPNFNPNIT 
In either case, the position of the F in Section 3 is excellent: F . . . L in row 3. There 8re 3 
cells intervening between F and L, into which G, H, I-J, and K m8y be inserted. 
It is not nearly 
so likely that G, H, and K 8re in the keyword 8s that I should be in it. 
Let it be assumed that 
this is the case, and let the letters be plsced in the appropriate cells in Section 3. Thus (Fig. 23e):

Let the resultant derived values be checked against the frequency distribution. 
If the position of 
H in Section 3 is correct, then the digrsph ON,, nornmlly of high frequency should be represented 
sever81 times by HF.. 
Reference to Fig. 22 shows 8 frequency of 4 times. 
And HbL with 2 occur- 
rences, represents NS,. There is no need to go through all the possible corroborations.

it is seen at once from Fig. 23~ thst the lstter is apparently correct and not the former, becsuse 
L& equals OU, and not OR,. If BS,=CR, this means that the letter C of the digraph CQ, must be 
placed in row 1 column 3 or row 2 column 3 of Section 3. Now the d.igraph CB, occurs 5 times, 
CG,, 4 times, CH,, 3 times, CC&, 2 times. 
Let an attempt be made to deduce the exact position of 
C in section 3 and the positions of B, G, and H in section 4. Since F is already placed in section

d. (1) It is interesting to note how much simpler the matter becomes when the positions 
of the plain-text 
and cipher-text sections are reversed, or, what amounts to the same thing, 
when in encipherment the plain-text pairs are sought in the sections containing the mixed alpha- 
bets, and their cipher equivalents are taken from the sections containing the normal alphabets. 
For example, referring to Fig. 23h, suppose that sections 3-4 be used as the source of the plain- 
text pairs, and sections l-2 as the source of the cipher-text pairs. 
Then ON,=DG,, E&,=AU., etc. 
(2) To solve a message enciphered in that manner, it is necessary merely to make a mat,rix 
in which all four sections are normal alphabets, and then perform two steps. First, the cipher text 
pairs are converted into their normal alphabet equivalents merely by “deciphering” 
the message 
with that matrix; the result of this operation yields two monoalphabets, one composed of the odd 
letters, the other of the even letters. 
The second step is to solve these two mono-alphabets. 
(3) Where the same mixed alphabet is inserted in sections 3 and 4, the problem is still 
easier, since the letters resulting from the conversion into normal-alphabet equivalents all belong 
to the same, single-mixed alphabet. 
45. Analysis of ciphers based upon other types of checkerboard matrices.-The 
solution 
of cryptograms enciphered by other types of checkerboard matrices is accomplished along lines 
very similar to those set forth in the foregoing example of the solution of a message prepared by 
means of a &square checkerboard matrix. 
There are, unfortunately, 
no means or tests which can 
be applied to determine in the early stages of the analysis exactly what type of design is involved 
in thejitsf case under study. 
The author freely admits that the solution outlined in subparagraph 
c is quite artificial in that nothing is demonstrated in step (7) that obviously leads to or warrants 
the assumption that a 4-square checkerboard is involved. 
This point was passed over with the 
quite bald statement that this was “the simplest thing to assume”-and 
then the solution 
proceeds exactly as though this mere hypothesis has been definitely established. For example, the 
very first results obtained were based upon assuming that a certain 4-letter repetition represented 
the word STOP and immediately 
inserting 
certain letters in appropriute 
cella in a &squute checket- 
board. 
Several more assumptions were built on top of that and very rapid strides were made. 
What if it had not been a &square chwkerboard at all ? What if it had been a 2-square matrix 
of the type shown in Fig. 24?

The only defense that can be made of what may seem to the student to be purely arbitrary 
procedure based upon the author’s advance information or knowledge is the following: In the 
first place, in order to avoid making the explanation a too-longdrawnsut 
affair, it is necessary 
(and pedagogical experience warrants) that certain alternative 
hypotheses be passed over in 
silence. 
In the second place, it may now be added, aflet the principles and procedure have been 
elucidated (which at this stage is the primq 
object of this text) that if good results do not follow 
from a first hypothesis, the only thing the cryptanalyst 
can do is to reject that hypothesis, and 
formulate a second hypothesis. 
In actual practice he may have to reject a second, third, fourth, 
. . . nth hypothesis. 
In the end he may strike the right one-or 
he may not. 
There is no 
guaranty of success in the matter. 
In the third place, one of the objects of this text is to show 
how certain systems, if employed for military purposes, can readily be broken down. 
Assuming

that a checkerboard system is in use, and that daily changes in keywords are made, it is possible 
that the traffic of the first day might give considerable difRculty in solution, if the type of 
checkerboard were not known to the cryptanalyst. 
But the second or third day’s tr8tIic would 
be easy to solve, because by that time the cryptanalytic 
personnel would have analyzed the 
system and thus learned what type of checkerboard the enemy is using. 
46. Analysis of the Playfair cipher system.-& 
An excellent example of a practical, partially 
digraphic system is the Playfair cipher? 
It was used for a number of years as a field cipher by 
the British Army, before and during the World War, and for a short time, also during that 
war, by certain units of the American Expeditionary 
Forces. 
b. Published solutions’ 
for this cipher 8re quite similar basically and vary only in minor 
details. 
The earliest, that by Lieut. Mauborgne, used straightforward 
principles of frequency to 
establish the values of three or four of the most frequent digraphs. 
Then, on the assumption 
that in most cases in which a keyword appears on the first and second rows the last five letters 
of the normal alphabet, VWXYZ, will rarely be disturbed in sequence and will occupy the last row 
of the square, he “juggles” the letters given by the values tentatively established from frequency 
considerations, placing them in various positions in the square, together with VWXYZ, to correspond 
to the plain-text 
cipher relationships tentatively 
established. 
A later solution by Lieut. Frank 
Moorman, as described in Bitt’s Manual, assumes that in a Playfair cipher prepared by means 
of a square in which the keyword occupies the first and second rows, if a digraphic frequency 
distribution 
is made, it will be found that the letters having the greatest combining power are 
very probably letters of the key. 
A still later solution, by Lieut. Commander Smith, is perhaps 
the most lucid and systematized of the three. 
He sets forth in definite language certain con- 
siderations which the other two writers certainly entertained but failed to indicate. 
c. The following details have been summarized from Commander Smith’s solution: 
(1) The Playfair cipher may be recognized by virtue of the fact that it always contains an 
even number of letters, and that when divided into groups of two letters each, no group contains 
8 repetition of the same letter, as NN or EE. Repetitions of digraphs, trigraphs, and polygraphs 
will be evident in fairly long messages. 
(2) Using the square B shown in Fig. 25a, there are two general cases to be considered, as 
regards the results of encipherment:

Reciprocity is only partial. 
(3) The foregoing gives rise to the following: 
RULE I. (a) Regardless of the position of the letters in the square, if 
1.2=3.4, then 
2.1=4.3 
(b) If 1 and 2 form opposite comers of a rectangle, the following equations obtsin: 
1.2=3.4 
2.1=4.3 
3.4=1.2 
4.3=2.1 
(4) A letter considered as occupying a position in a row con be combined with but four other 
letters in the same row; the same letter considered 8s occupying a position in a column can be 
combined with but four other letters in the same column. 
Thus, this letter can be combined with 
only 8 other letters all told, under Case 2, above. 
But the same letter considered a8 occupying 
a comer of a rectangle can be combined with 16 other letters, under Case 1, above. 
Commander 
Smith derives from these facts the conclusion that “it would appear that Case 1 is twice a8 prob- 
able as Case 2.” 
He continues thus (notation my own): 
“Now in the square, note that: 
81eO 
“From this it is seen that of the 24 equations that ~8x1 be formed when each letter of the 
square is employed either as the initial or final letter of the group, five will indicate 8 repetition of 
n corresponding letter of plain text. 
“Hence, RULE II. After it has been determined, in the equation 1.2=3.4, thst,eay, EN,,=FA,, 
there is a probability of one in five that any other group begimdng with F, indicates E88, snd that 
any group endingin A, indicates ON,.

“After such combinations 
a8 ER,, OR,, and EN, have been assumed or determined, the above 
rule may be of use in discovering additional digraphs and partial words.” @ 
RULE III. 
In the equation 1.2=3.4, 
1 and 3 can never be identical, nor can 2 and 4 ever be 
identical. 
Thus, AN, could not possibly be represented by AY,, nor could ER, be represented by KR,. 
This rule is useful in elimination of certain possibilities when a specific message is being studied. 
RULE 
IV. In the equation 1.2,=3.4,, if 2 and 3 are identical, the letters are all in the same 
row or column, and in the relative order 124. In the square shown, AN,=NK, and the absolute 
order is ANK. The relative order 124 includes five absolute order8 which are cyclic permutations 
of one another. 
Thus: ANK. . , NK. . A, K. . AN, . . ANK, and . ANK.. 
RULE V. In the equation 1.2,- -3.4,, 
if 1 and 4 are identical, the letters are all in the same 
row or column, and in the relative order 243. In the square shown, KNr,=RK, 
and the absolute 
order is NKR. The relative order 243 include8 five absolute orders which are cyclic permutations 
of one another. 
Thus NKR. ., KR. .N, R. .NK, . .NKR, and .NKR.. 
RULE 
VI. “Analyze 
the message for group recurrences. 
Select the group8 of greatest 
recurrence and assume them to be high-frequency digraphs. 
Substitute the assumed digraphs 
throughout the message, testing the assumptions in their relation to other groups of the cipher. 
The reconstruction of the square proceeds simultaneously with the solution of the message and 
aids in hastening the translation of the cipher.” 
It is seen that F. represenb D,, N,. G,, H, 4 times each, and E,, 8 times. 
Consequently, 
supposing that it has 
been determined that FA o=ENr,, the probability 
that F. will represent E, is not 1 in 5 but 8 in 24, or 1 in 3; but 
supposing that it has been determined 
that FW .=NTn, the probability 
that F. will represent N, is 4 in 24 or 1 in 6. 
The difference in these probabilities 
is occasioned by the fact that the 6rst instance, FA,=EN, 
corresponds to a 
Case. 1 encipherment, 
the second instance, FW.=NT,, to a Case 2 encipherment. 
But there is no way of knowing 
initially, and without 
other data, whether one is dealing with a Case 1 or Case 2 encipherment. 
Only as an 
approximation, 
therefore, may one say that the probability 
of F. representing a given 8, is 1 in 5. 
A probability 
of 1 in 5 is of almost trivial 
importance 
in this situation, 
since it represents such a “long shot” for success. 
The 
following rule might be preferable: 
If the equation 1.2=3.4 has been established, where all the letters represented 
by 1, 2, 3, and 4 are different, then there is a probability 
of 4/5 that a Case 1 encipherment 
is involved. 
Conse- 
quently, 
if at the same time another equation, 3.6=5.2, 
has been established, where 2 and 3 represent the same 
letters as in the first equation, and 5 and 6 are different letters, also different from 2 and 3, there is a probability 
of 16/25 that the equation 1.6=5.4 is valid; or if at the same time that the equation 1.2=3.4 has been determined, 
the equation 
1.6=5.4 has also been established, then there is a probability 
of 16/25 that the equation 3.6=5.2 is 
valid. 
(Check this by noting the following 
equations 
based upon Fig. 250: &=& 
%==k, 
%=;d. 
Note 
the positions occupied in Fig. 25~ by the letters involved.) 
Likewise, 
if the equations 1.2=3.4 and 1.6=3.5 
have been simultaneously 
established, then there is a probability 
that the equation 2.5~4.6 
is valid; or if the 
equations 
1.2=3.4 
and 2.5=4.6 
have been simultaneously 
established, 
then there is a probability 
that the 
equation 
2.5=4.6 
is valid. 
(Check this by noting the following equations: 
bk=;)b; 
;I=;;(; 
l%=$; 
note the 
positions occupied in Fig. 25~ by the letters involved.) 
However, it must be added that these probabilities 
are 
based upon assumptions which fail to take into account any considerations 
whatever as to frequency of letters 
or specificity 
of composition 
of the matrix. 
For instance, suppose the 5 high-frequency 
letters E, T, R, I, N all 
happen to fall in the same row or column in the matrix; 
the number of Case 2 encipherments 
would be much 
greater than expectancy 
and the probability 
that the equation 
1.2=3.4 represents a Case 1 encipherment 
falls 
much below 4/5.

d. (1) When solutions for the Playfair cipher system were first developed, based upon the 
fact that the letters were inserted in the cells in keyword-mixed order, cryptographers thought 
it desirable to place stumbling blocks in the path of such solution by departing from strict, 
keyword-mixed order. 
Playfair squares of the latter type are designed as “modified Playfair 
squares.” 
One of the simplest methods is illustrated in Fig. 25a, wherein it will be noted that 
the last five letters of the keyword proper are inserted in the fourth row of the square instead 
of the second, where they would naturally fall. 
Another method is to insert the letters within 
the cells from left to right and top downward but use a sequence that is a keyword-mixed sequence 
developed by a columnar transposition based upon the keyword proper. 
Thus, using the key- 
word BANKRUPTCY:

The principal disadvantage of such an arrangement is that 
it requires more time to locate the letters desired, both in cryptographing 
and decryptographing, 
than it usually does when a semblance of normal alphabetic order is preserved in the matrix.

,4t first glance they all appear to be different, but closer examination shows them to be regular 
commutations or cyclic permutations 
of one another and of the square in Fig. 25b. 
They yield 
identical equivalent,s in all cases. However, if an attempt be made to reconstruct the original 
keyword, it would be much easier to do so from Fig. 25b than from any of the others, because 
in Fig. 25b the keyword-mixed sequence has not been disturbed as much as in Figs. %c, d, e. 
In working with Playfair ciphers, the student should be on the lookout for such instances of 
cyclic permutation 
of the original Playfair square, for during the course of solution he will not 
know whether he is building up the original or an equivalent cyclic permutation of the original 
matrix; only after he has completely reconstructed the matrix will he be able to determine this 
point. 
(4) If the columns of a given Playfair square or matrix, M,, are permuted cyclically (shifting 
column 5 to the left so as to change the order 12345 into 51234, then shifting column 4 to produce 
the order 45123, and so on), a set of five sq’uares, Ml, Mf, M3 M,, and MS, all having superficially 
different configurations but yielding identical equivalents will be obtained. 
From each of these 
five matrices, four more may be obtained by a homologous cyclic permutation applied to the 
rows. Thus a set of 25 superficially 
different but cryptographically 
equivalent matrices may 
be produced. 
By interchanging the rows and the columns of the original square, M, (i. e., mak- 
ing column 1 into row 1, column 2 into row 2, and so on), a new matrix, M:, is produced, in 
which all Case 2 encipherments (letters in the same row or in the same column) will be identical 
with those of the original M1 matrix, but all Case 1 encipherments (letters at diagonally op- 
posite corners of a rectangle) will be the reverse of those of the original M, square. 
(Note the 
effect of turning a Playfair square 90’ or 27OO.) By cyclically permuting the rows and then the 
columns of the Ml, matrix, another set of 25 superficially different but cryptographically 
equiva- 
lent matrices may be produced. 
Thus, 49 matrices are derivable by cyclic permutation of an 
original square, making a total of 50 matrices in all. 
Now, the Case 2 encipherments obtained 
from all 50 of these matrices will be identical but Case 1 encipherments by means of any one of 
the 25 matrices of the first set will be the reverse of those obtained by means of any one of the 
25 matrices of the second set. 
Consequently, there are only 24 secondary matrices which may 
be derived by cyclic permutation from a basic or primary Playfair square, and which are crypto- 
graphically 
equivalent among themselves and with the original square, thus making, in all, 25 
cryptographically 
equivalent 
matrices. 
The usefulness of this property 
of cryptographic 
equivalence inherent in cyclically 
related matrices, as well as the property of reversibility 
as 
regards Case 1 encipherments from two matrices bearing a 90’ or 270’ phase relationship, will 
become clear in the subsequent paragraphs, when the mechanics of the reconstruction 
of a 
Playfair 
square are presented.

(2) Without going through the preliminary 
tests in detail, with which it will be assumed 
that the student is now familiar,lO the conclusion is reached that the cryptogram is &graphic in 
nature, and a &graphic frequency distribution 
is made (Fig. 26).

Since there are no double-letter 
groups, the conclusion is reached that a Playfair cipher

The first long repetition, with the sequent reversed digraphs CX and XC immediately suggests 
the word BATTALION, split up into -B

(4) Because of the frequent use of numerals before the word BATTALION and because of 
the appearance of ON before this word in line G, the possibility suggests itself that the word 
before BATTALION in line G is either ONE or SECOND. The identical digraph FA in both cases 
gives a hint that the word BATTALION in line F may also be preceded by a numeral; if ONE is

correct in line G, then THREE is possible in line F. 
On the other hand, if SECOND is correct in

First, note that if either hypothesis is true, then OTo=THo. The frequency distribution 
shows 
that OT occurs 6 times and is in fact the most frequent digraph in the message. Moreover, by 
Rule I of subparagraph b, if OT,=TH, then TOe=HT,. 
Since HT, is a very rare digraph in normal 
plain text, TO, should either not occur at 8h in so short a message or else it should be very infre- 
quent. 
The frequency distribution 
shows its entire absence. Hence, there is nothing incon- 
sistent with the possibility that the word in front of BATTALION in line F is THREE or THIRD, 
and some evidence that it is actually one or the other. 
(5) But can evidence be found for the support of one hypothesis against the other? 
Let 
the frequency distribution 
be examined with a view to throwing light upon this point. 
If the 
first hypothesis is true, then UZ,=RE,, and, by Rule I, ZU,=ER,. 
The frequency distribution 
shows but one occurrence of UZ, and but two occurrences of ZU,. These do not look very good for 
RE and ER. On the other hand, if the second hypothesis is true, then UZ,=IR, 
and, by Rule I, 
ZUc=RIP. 
The frequencies are much more f8vOr8ble in this case. Is there anything inconsistent 
with the assumption, on the basis of the second hypothesis, that TE,=EC,? 
The frequency 
distribution 
shows no inconsistency, for TE, occurs once and ET, (= CE,, by Rule I) occurs once. 
As regards whether FA,- -EB, or D$, both hypotheses are tenable; possibly the second hypothesis 
is a shade better than the first, on the following reasoning: By Rule I, if FA,=EB, then AF,=BE,, 
or if FA,=DB, then AFo=BD,. 
The fact that no AF, occurs, whereas at least one BE, may be 
expected in this message, inclines one to the second hypothesis, since BD, is very rare. 
(6) Let the 2nd hypothesis be assumed to be correct. 
The additional values are tentatively 
inserted in the text, and in lines G and K two interesting repetitions are noted:

This certainly looks like STATE THAT THE. . . , which would make TEp= PTo. Furthermore, in 
line G the sequence STATETHATTHE. .SECONDBATTALION can hardly be anything else than 
STATE THAT THEIR SECOND BATTALION, which would make TC*=EI,

(7) It is perhaps high time that the whole list of tentative equivalent values be studied in 
relation to their consistency with the positions of letters in the Play-fair square; moreover, by so 
doing, additional values may be obtained in the process. The complete list of values is aa follows:

(11) since the sequence containing

occupy 8 column; or, if the HTO sequence occupies a column, then the CETPI sequence must

occupy a row; and they may be combined by means of their common letter, T. According to 
subpar. d (4), the two sequences may be inserted within a Flayfair square in 25 merent 
ways 
by cyclically permuting and shifting the letters of one of these two sequences; and the same 
two sequences may be again inserted in another set of 25 ways by cyclically permuting and 
shifting the letters of the other of these two sequences. In Fig. 27 the diagrams labeled (1) 
to (lo), inclusive, show 10 of the possible 25 obtainable by making the HTOXN sequence one 
of the rows of the square; diagrams (11) and (12) show 2 of the possible 25 obtainable by making 
the HTOXN sequence one of the columns of the square. 
The entire complement of 25 arrange- 
ments for each set may easily be drawn up by the student; space forbids their being completely 
set forth and it is really unnecessary to do so.

(12) Before trying to discover means whereby the actual or primary matrix may be detected 
from among the full set of 50 possible matrices, the question may be raised: is it necessary7 
So far as concerns Case 2 encipherments, since any one of the 50 arrangements will yield the 
same equivalents as any of the remaining 49, perhaps a relative arrangement wil1 do. 
The 
configurations shown in Fig. 27 constitute what may be termed slcele~on matrices, and one of 
them will be selected for experiment.

selected for trial.

(14) What additional let,ters can be inserted, using as a guide the list of equivalents in sub- 
paragraph (7)? There is ATp=CXO, for example. 
It contains only one letter, A, not in the 
skeleton matrix selected for trial, and this letter may immediately 
be placed, as shown:‘*

Scanning the list for additional cases of this type, none are found. 
But seeing that several high- 
frequency letters have already been inserted in the matrix, perhaps reference to the cryptogram 
itself in connection with values derived from these inserted letters may yield further clues. For 
example, the vowels A, E, I, and 0 are all in position, as are the very frequent consonants N and T. 
The following combinations may be studied: 
AN,=BX, 
AT,=C& 
NA,=Xe, 
TA,=XC, 
EN,=BT, 
ET,=TP, 
IN,=BT, 
IT,=CP, 
ON,=XH, 
OT,=XO, 
NE,=TB, 
NI,=T8, 
NO&X, 
TE,=PT, 
TI,=PC, 
TO,=OX, 
AT,( = CX,), TA,( =XC,), ON,( =XH,), TE,( = PT,) and ET,( =TP,) have already been inserted in the 
text. 
Of the others, only OX,(=TO,) occurs two times, and this value can be at once inserted in 
th 
test. 
But can the equivalents of AN, EN, or IN be found from frequency considerations? 
10 The fact that the placement 
of A yields AT, =CX+, means that the skeleton matrix selected for experiment 
really 
belongs to the correct set of 25 possible cylic permutations, 
and that the letters of the NHTOX sequence 
belong in a row, the letters of the PICET sequence belong in a column of the original Playfair square. 
If the 
reverse were the case, one could not obtain AT, =CX, but would obtain AT,=XC,. 
Thus the equation AT,=XC, 
unequivocally 
distinguishes 
the skeleton matrices 
1 to 10, inclusive 
(Fig. 27), from skeleton matrices 
11 and 
12, since if either of the latter had been selected instead of skeleton matrix 8, the letter A could not have been 
positioned to satisfy this equation without 
contradiction.

Take E$, for example ; it is represented by eT,. 
J&hat combination of 83 is most likely to repre- 
sent EN, among the following candidates: 
K’I’, (4 times) ; by Rule I, NE, would=TK, 
(no occurrences) 
VT, (5 times) ; by Rule I, NE, would=TV, 
(2 times) 
ZT, (3 times) ; by Rule I, NE, would =TZ, (1 time) 
VT, certainly looks good: it begins the message, suggesting the word ENEMY; in line H, in the 
sequence PZTV would become LINE. 
Let this be assumed to be correct, and let the word ENEMY 
also be assumed to be correct. 
Then EM,=& and the square then becomes as shown herewith:

The sequence . . . RI. , NERS . . PT. . . suggests PRISONERS CAPTURED, as follows: 
MW CF ZU BH TV YA BG IP RZ KP

This gives the following new values: 9Pp=CF,; SOp=BH,; CA,=BG,; URp=RZ,; ED,=KP,. 
The letters B and G can be placed in position at once, since the positions of C and A are already 
known. 
The insertion of the letter B immediately permits the placement of the letter S, from the 
equation SOD= BH,. Of the remaining equations only ED,=KP, can be used. 
Since E and P are 
fixed and are in the same column, D and K must be in the same column, and moreover the K must 
be in the same row as E. There is only one possible position for K, viz, immediately after Q. This 
automatically fixes the position of D. The square is now as shown herewith:

(16) A review of all equations, including the very first ones established, gives the following 
which may now be used: DBp=FAt ; RS,=YA,.

now permits the placement of U, which is confirmed by the 
equation URp=RZo from the word CAPTURED.

There is then only one cell vacant, and it must be occupied by the only letter left unplaced, 
viz, W. Thus the whole square has been reconstructed, and the message can now be decrypto- 
graphed. 
(17) Is the square just reconstructed identical with the original, or is it a cyclic permuta- 
tion of a keyword-mixed Playfair square of the type illustrated 
in Fig. 25bl 
Even though the 
message can be read with ease, this point is still of interest. 
Let the sequence be written in five 
ways, each composed of five partial sequences made by cyclicly permuting each of the horizontal 
rows of the reconstructed square. 
Thus:

with these five sequences, in an endeavor to reconstruct a transposition

f. Continued practice in the solution of Playfair ciphers will make the student quite expert 
in the matter and will enable him to solve shorter and shorter messages.11 Also, with practice 
it will become a matter of intierence 
to him as to whether the letters are inserted in the square 
with any sort of regularity, such as simple keyword-mixed order, columnar transposed kcyword- 
mixed order, or in a purely random order. 
8. It may perhaps seem to the student that the foregoing steps are somewhat too artificial, 
a bit too “cut and dried” in their accuracy to portray the process of’ analysis, as it is applied in 
practice. 
For example, the critical student may well object to some of the assumptions and the 
reasoning in step (5) above, in which the words THREE and ONE (1st hypothesis) were rejected 
in favor of the words THIRD and SECOND (2nd hypothesis). 
This rested largely upon the 
rejection of RE, and ER, as the equivalents of UZ, and ZU,, and the adoption of IR, and RI, as 
their equivalents. 
Indeed, if the student will examine the final message with a critical eye he 
will find that while the bit of reasoning in step (5) is perfectly logical, the assumption upon which 
it is based is in fact wrong, for it happens that in this case ER, occurs only once and RE, does not 
occur at all. 
Consequently, although most of the reasoning which led to the rejection of the 1st 
hypothesis and the adoption of the 2nd was logical, it was in fact based upon erroneous assump- 
11 The author once had a student who “specialized” 
in Playfsir 
ciphera and became so adept that be could 
solve messages containing 
M few aa 50-60 lettere within 30 minutes.

tion. 
In other words, despite the fact that the assumption was incorrect, a correct d&&on 
was made. 
The student should take note that in cryptanalysis 
situationa of this soti are not at a8 un- 
us&. 
Indeed they are to be expected and a few words of explanation at this point may be useful. 
h. Cryptanalysis is a science in which deduction, based upon observational data, pIays a 
very large role. 
But it is also true that in this science most of the deductions usually rest upon 
assumptions. 
It is most often the case that the cryptanalyst is forced to make his assumptions 
upon a quite limited amount of text. 
It cannot be expected that assumptions based upon 
statistical generalizations will always hold true when applied to data comparatively very much 
smaIler in quantity than the total data used to derive the generalized rules. 
Consequently, as 
regards assumptions made in specific messages, most of the time they will be correct,, but OCCG 
sionully 
they will be incorrect. 
1n cryptanalysis it is often found that among the correct deduc- 
tions there will be cases in which subsequently discovered facts do not bear out the assumptions 
on which the deduction was based. Indeed, it is sometimes true that if thefacts had beenknown 
before the deduction was made, this howledge would have prevented making the correct deduc- 
tion. 
For example, suppose the cryptanalyst 
had somehow or other divined that the message 
under consideration contained no RE, only one RR, one IR, and two RI’s (as is actually the case). 
He would certainly not have been able to choose between the words THREE and ONE (1st hypo- 
thesis) as against THIRD and SECOND (2d hypothesis). 
But because he assumes that there 
should be more ER,‘s and RED’s than IR’s and RI’s in the message, he deduces that UZ, cannot 
be RI&, rejects the 1st hypothesis and takes the 2d. 
It later turns out, after the problem has been 
solved, t.hat the deduction was correct, although the assumption onwhich it was based (expectation 
of more frequent appearance of RE, and RR,) was, in fact, not true in this particular case. The 
cryptanalyst can only hope that the number of times when his deductions are correct, even though 
based upon assumptions which later turn out to be erroneous, will abundantly exceed the num- 
ber of times when his deductions are wrong, even though based upon assumptions which later 
prove to be correct. 
If he is lucky, the making of an assumption which is really not true will 
make no difference in the end and will not delay solution; but if he is specially favored with 
luck, it may actually help him solve the message-as was the case in this particular example. 
i. Another comment of a general nature may be made in connection with this specific 
example. 
The student may ask what would have been the procedure in this case if the message 
had not contained such a tell-tale repetition as the word BATTALION, which formed the point 
of departure for the solution, or, as it is often said, permitted an “entering wedge” to be driven 
into the message. The answer to his query is that if the word BATTALION had not been repeated, 
there would probably have been some other repetition which would have permitted the same 
sort of attack. 
If the student is looking for cut and dried, straight-forward, 
unvarying methods 
of attack, he should remember that cryptanalysis, while it may be considered a branch of mathe- 
matics, is not a science which has many “general solutions” such as are found and expected in 
mathematics proper. 
It is inherent in the very nature of cryptanalytica 
that, a8 a rzcle, on1y 
general principles can be established ; their practical application must take advantage of pecti- 
arities and part,icular situations which are noted in specific messages. This is especially true in 
a text on the subject. 
The illustration 
of a general principle requires a spec%c example, and the 
latter must of necessity manifest charact,eristics which make it different from any other example. 
The word BATTALION was not purposely repeated in this example in order to make the demon- 
stration of solution easy ; “it just happened that way.” 
In another example, some other entering 
* 
wedge would have been found. 
The student can be expected to learn only the general principles 
which will enable him to take advantage of the spe&$c characteristics manifested in spec$fc cases. 
Here it is de&cd to illustrate the general principles of solving Playfair ciphers and to point out 
the fact that entering wedges must and can be found. 
The specific nature of the entering wedge 
varies with specific examples.

47. Special remarks concerning the initial classification of crpptograms.--a. 
The student 
should by this time have a good conception of the basic nature of monoalphabetic substitution and 
of the many “changes” which may be rung upon this simple tune. 
The first step of all, naturally, 
is t,o be able to classify 
a cryptogram 
properly and place it in either the transposition or the 
substitution 
class. The tests for this classification have been given and as a rule the student 
will encounter no dif&uIty 
in this respect. 
b. There are, however, certain kinds of cryptograms whose class cannot be determined in the 
usual manner, as outlined in Par. 13 of this text. 
First of all there is the type of code message 
which employs bona-fide dictionary words as code groups.’ 
Naturally, 
a frequency distribution 
of such a message will approtiate 
that for normal plain text. 
The appearance of the message, 
how-ever, gives clear indications of what is involved. 
The study of such cases will be taken up in 
its proper place. 
At the moment it is only necessary to point out that these are code messages and 
not cipher, and it is for this reason that in Pars. 12 and 13 the words “cipher” and “cipher mes- 
sages” are used, the word “cryptogram” 
being used only where technically correct. 
t. Secondly, there come the unusual and borderline cases, including cryptograms whose 
nature and type can noi be ascertained from frequency distributions. 
Here, the cryptograms are 
technically not cipher but special forms of disguised secret writings which are rarely susceptible 
of being classed as transposition or substitution. 
These include a large share of the cases wherein 
the cryptographic messages are disguised and carried under an external, innocuous text which is 
innocent and seemingly without 
cryptographic 
content-for 
instance, in a message wherein 
specific letters are indicated in a way not open to suspicion under censorship, these letters being 
intended to constitute the letters of the cryptographic message and the other letters constituting 
“dummies.” 
Obviously, no amount of frequency tabulations 
will avail a competent, expert 
cryptanalyst in demonstrating or disclosing the presence of a cryptographic message, written and 
secreted within the “open” message, which serves but as an envelop and disguise for its authentic 
or real import. 
Certainly, such frequency tabulations can disclose the existence neither of sub- 
stitution 
nor transposition in these cases, since both forms are absent. 
Another very popular 
method that resembles the method mentioned above has for its basis a simple grille. 
The whole 
words forming the secret text are inserted within perforations cut in the paper and the remaining 
space filled carefully, using “nulls” 
and “dummies”, 
making a seemingly innocuous, ordinary 
message. There are other methods of this genera3 type which can obviously neither be detected 
nor cryptanalyzed, using the principles of frequency of recurrences and repetition. 
These can 
not be further discussed herein, but at a subsequent date a special text may be written for their 
handling.*

which the student ha8 just read (47~) contains a hidden cryptographic 
message.

48, Ciphers employing characters other than letters or -es,-. 
In view of the fore- 
going remarks, when so-called symbol ciphers, that is, ciphers employing peculiar symbols, 
signs of punctuation, 
diacritical marks, figures of “dancing men”, and so on are encountered 
in practicai work nowadays, they are almost certain to be simple, monoalphabetic ciphers. 
They are adequately described in romantic tales, in popular books on cryptography, 
and in 
the more common types of magazine articles. 
No further space need be given ciphers of this 
type in this text, not only because of their simplicity 
but also because they are encountered 
in military cryptography only in sporadic instsnces, principally 
in censorship activities. 
Even 
in the latter cases, it is usually found that such ciphera are employed in “intimate” 
correspondence 
for the exchange of sentiments that appear less decorous when set forth in plain language. 
They 
are very seldom used by authentic enemy agents. 
When such a cipher is encountered nowadays 
it may practically always be regarded as the work of the veri8st typo, when it is not that of a 
“crank” or a mentally-deranged person. 
b. The usual preliminary procedure in handling such oaseq where the symboIs may be some- 
what confusing to the mind because of their u&m&u 
appearance to the eye, is to substitute 
letters for them consistently throughout the message md then treat the resulting text as an ordi- 
nary cryptogram composed of letters is treated. 
This procedure also facilitates the construction 
of the necessary frequency distributions, 
which would be tedious to construct by using symbols. 
c. A final word must be said on the subject of symbol ciphers by way of caution. 
When 
symboIs are used to replace letters, syllables, and entire words, then the systems approach code 
methods in principle, and can b8come difhcult of solution.4 
The logical extension of the use of 
symbols in such 8 form of writing is the employment of arbitrary 
characters for 8 specially 
developed “shorthand’, 
system bearing little or no resemblance to well-known, and therefore 
nonsecret, systems of shorthand, such as Gregg, Pitman, etc. Unless a considerable amount 
of text is available for analysis, a privat8lydevised 
shorthand may be very difhcult to solve. 
Fortunately, such systems are rarely encountered in military cryptography. 
They fall under the 
heading of cryptographic curiosities, of interest to the cryptanalyst in his leisure moments4 
d. In practical cmtography 
today, as has been stated above, the use of characters other 
than the 26 letters of the English alphabet is comparatively 
rare. 
It is true that there are a 
few governments which stih adhere to systems yielding cryptograms in groups of figures. 
These 
are almost in every case code systems and will be treated in their proper place. 
In some cases 
cipher systems, or systems of enciph8ring cod8 are used which are basically mathematical in 
character and operation, and therefore use numbers instead of letters. 
Some persons are 
inclined toward the use of numbers rather than letters because numbers lend themselves much 
more readily to certain arithmetical 
operations such as addition, subtraction, and so on, than 
do letters.’ 
But there is usually added some final process whereby the figure groups are con- 
verted into letter groups, for the sake of economy in transmission. 
a The most famous: Poe’8 27~ Gold Bug; Arthur Conan Doyle’s 7%~ Siqn of Four. 
4 The use of rymbols for abbreviation 
and speed in writing 
goes back to the days of antiquity. 
Cicero ie 
reported to have dmwn up “a book like a dictionary, 
in which he placed before each word the notation (symbol) 
which should represent it, and so great was the number of notation8 and worda that whatever could be written in 
Latin could be expre-d 
in his notations.” 
4 An example 
is found in the famous Pepye Diary, which was written in shorthand, purely for hir own eyes 
by Samuel Pepps (163%1703). 
“He wrote it in Shelton’e Byetern of tachygraphy 
(1641), which he complicated 
by using foreign language8 or by varieties of his own invention 
wbenever he had to record passagea least fit to be 
Been by his servants, or by ‘all the world.’ ” 
6 But, this of course, is because we are taught arithmetic 
by using numbers, based upon the decimal system 
8~3 8 rule. 
By epecial training 
one couki learn to perform the usual “ruithmetical” 
operations using lettere. 
For example, using our Englieh alphabet of 26 letters, where A= 1, B=2, 
C=3, etc., it is obvioue that A+ B=C, 
jurt aa 1+ 2=3; 
(A+ B)‘= I, etc. 
Thir sort of cryptographic 
arithmetic 
could be learned by rote, just aa 
multiplication 
tablea are learned.

e. The only notable exceptions to the statement contained in the first sentence of the pm- 
ceding subparagraph are those of Russian messages transmitted in the Russian Morse alphabet 
and Japanese messages transmitted in the Kata Kana Morse alphabet. 
As regards Chinese, 
which is not an alphabetical language and comprises some 40,000 ideographs, since the Morse 
telegraph code comprises only some 40 combinations, telegrams in Chinese are usually prepared 
by means of codes which permit of substituting 
arbitrarily-assigned 
code groups for the char- 
acters. 
Usually the code groups consist of figures. 
One such code known as the 0$&zZ C7Gncse 
Telegr&ph Code, has about 10,000 4-figure groups, beginning with 0001, and these are arranged 
so that there are 100 characters on each page. Sometimes, for purposes of secrecy or economy, 
these figure groups are enciphered and converted in letter groups. 
49. Concluding remarks concerning 
monoalphabetic substitution--a. 
The alert student will 
have by this time gathered that the solution of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers of the simple 
or fixed type are particularly 
easy to solve, once the underlying principles are thoroughly under- 
stood. 
As in other arts, continued practice with examples leads to facility and skill in solution, 
especially where the student concentrates his attention upon traffic all of the same general nature, 
so that the type of text which he is continually 
encountering becomes familiar to him and its 
peculiarities or characteristics of construction give clues for short cuts to solution. 
It is true 
that a knowledge of the general phraseology of messages, the kind of words used, their sequences, 
and so on, is of very great assistance in practical work in all fields of cryptanalysis. 
The student 
is urged to note particularly 
these finer details in the course of his study. 
b. Another thing which the student should be on the lookout for in simple monoalphabetic 
substitution 
is the consecutive use of several difIerent mixed cipher alphabets in a single long 
message. Obviously, a single, composite frequency distribution 
for the whole message will not 
show the characteristic crest and trough appearance of a simple monoalphabetic cipher, since a 
given cipher letter will represent difIerent plain-text 
letters in diflerent parts of the message. 
But if the cryptanalyst 
will carefully observe the distribution 
a8 it ti being compiled, he will 
note that at first it presents the characteristic crest and trough appearance of monoalphabeticity, 
and that after a time it begins to lose this appearance. 
If possible he should be on the lookout 
for some peculiarity 
of grouping of letters which serves as an indicator for the shift from one 
cipher alphabet to the next. 
If he finds such an indicator he should begin a second distribution 
from that point on, and proceed until another shift or indicator is encountered. 
By thus isolating 
the different portions of the text, and restricting 
the frequency distributions 
to the separate 
monoalphabets, the problem may be treated then as an ordinary simple monoalphabetic sub- 
stitution. 
Consideration of these remarks in connection with instances of this kind leads to the 
comment that it is often more advisable for the cryptanalyst 
to compile his own data, than to 
have the latter prepared by clerks, especially when studying a system de no~o. For observations 
which will certainly escape an untrained clerk can be most useful and may indeed facilitate 
solution. 
For example, in the case under consideration, if a clerk should merely hand the uni- 
literal distribution 
to the cryptanalyst, 
the latter might be led astray; the appearance of the 
composite distribution 
might convince him that the cryptogram is a good deal more complicated 
than it really is. 
c. Monoalphabetic substitution with variants represents an extension of the basic principle, 
with the intention of masking the characteristic frequencies resulting from a strict monoalpha- 
beticity, 
by means of which solutions are rather readily obtained. 
Some of the subterfuges 
applied on the establishment of variant or multiple values are simple and more or less fail to 
serve the purpose for which they are intended; others, on the contrary, may interpose serious 
difficulties to a straightforward 
solution. 
But in no case may the problem be considered of more 
than ordinary difficulty. 
Furthermore, 
it should be recognized that where these subterfuges 
.

are really adequate to the purpose, the complications introduced are such that the practical 
manipulation 
of the system becomes as di&ult 
for the cryptographer as for the cryptanalyst. 
d. As already mentioned in monoalphabetic substitution 
with variants it is most common 
to employ figures or groups of figures. 
The reason for this is that the use of num&al 
groups 
seems more natural or easier to the uninitiated 
than does the use of varying combinations of 
letters. 
Moreover, 
it is easy to draw up cipher alphabets in which some of the letters are 
represent,ed by single digits, others by pairs of digits. 
Thus, the decomposition of the cipher 
text which is an irregular intermixture 
of uniliteral 
and multiliteral 
equivalents, is made more 
complicated and correspondingly 
di&ult 
for the cryptanalyst, 
who does not known which 
digits are to be used separately, which in pairs. 
e. A few words may be added here in regard to a method which often suggests itself to lay- 
men. 
This consists in using a book possessed by all the correspondents and indicating the letters 
of the message by means of numbers referring to specific letters in the book. 
One way consists 
in selecting a certain page and then giving the line number and position of the letter in the line, 
the page number being shown by a single initial indicator. 
Another way is to use t.he entire 
book, giving the cipher equivalents in groups of three numbers representing page, line, and 
number of letter. 
(Ex.: 75-8-10 means page 75,&h line, 10th letter in the line.) 
Such systems 
are, however, extremely cumbersome to use and, when the cryptographing 
is done carelessly, 
can be solved. 
The basis for solution in such cases rests upon the use of adjacent letters on the 
same line, the accidental repetitions of certain letters, and the occurrence of unenciphered words 
in the messages, when laziness or fatigue intervenes in the cryptographing. 
f. It may also be indicated that human nature and the fallibility 
of cipher clerks is such 
that it is rather rare for an encipherer to make full use of the complement of variants placed 
at his disposal. 
The result is that in most cases certain of the equivalents will be used so much 
more often than others that diversities in frequencies will soon manifest themselves, affording 
important data for att’ack by the cryptanalyst. 
g. In t,he World War the cases where monosiphnbetic substitution 
ciphers were employed 
in actual operations on the Western Front were exceedingly rare because the majority of the 
belligerents had a fair knowledge of cryptography. 
On the Eastern Front, however, the exten- 
sive use, by the poorly prepared Russian Army, of monoalphabetic ciphers in the fall of 1914 
was an important, 
if not the most important, 
factor in the success of the German operations 
during the Battle of Tannenberg.8 
It seems that a somewhat more secure cipher system was 
authorized, but proved too difficult for the untrained Russian cryptographic and radio personnel. 
Consequently, recourse was had to simple substitution 
ciphers, somewhat interspersed with 
plain text, and sometimes to messages completeip in plain language. 
The damage which this 
faulty use of cryptography did to the Russian Army and thus to the Allied cause is incalculable. 
k Many of the messages found by censors in letters sent by mail during the World War 
were cases of monoalphabetic substitution, 
disguised in various ways. 
’ In 1915 the German Government 
conspired with a group of Hindu revolutionaries 
to stir up a rebellion in 
India, the purpose being to cause the wit,hdrawal 
of British troops from the Western Front. 
Hindu conspirators 
in the United State8 were given money to purchase arm 
and ammunition 
and to transport them to India. 
For 
communication 
with their superiors in Berlin the conspirators 
Itsed, among others, the system described in this 
paragraph. 
A ‘I-page typewritten 
letter, built up from page, line, and letter-number 
references to a book known 
only ti the communicants, 
was intercepted 
by the British and turned over to the United States Government 
for u8e in connection with the prosecution of f,he Hindus for violating 
our neutrality. 
The author solved this 
message without 
the book in question, by taking full advantage of the clues referred to.

60. llndytid 
key for cryptsnalpsis.-u, 
It may be of assistance to indicate, by means of an 
outline, the relationships existing among the various cryptographic systems thus far considered. 
This graphic outline will be augmented from time to time as the difterent cipher systems are 
examined, and will constitute what has already been alluded to in Par. ti and there termed an 
analytical key for cryptanalysis? 
Fundamentally 
its nature is that of a schematic classification 
of the different systems examined. 
The analytical key forms an insert at the end of the book. 
b. Note, in the analytical key, the rather clear-cut, dichotomous method of treatment; that 
is, classification by subdivision into pairs. 
For example, in the very first step there are only 
two alternatives: 
the cryptogram is either (1) cipher, or (2) code. 
If it is cipher, it is either 
(1) substitution, 
(2) transposition. 
If it is a substitution 
cipher, it is either (1) monographic, 
or (2) polygraphic-and 
so on. 
If the student will study the analytical key attentively, 
it will 
assist him in fixing in mind the manner in which the various systems covered thus far are related 
to one another, and this w-ill be of benefit in clearing away some of the mental fog or haziness 
from which he is at first apt to suffer. 
c. The numbers in parentheses refer to specific paragraphs in this text, so that the student 
may readily turn to the text for detailed information or for purposes of refreshing his memory 
as to procedure. 
d. In addition to these reference numbers there have been afExed to the successive steps 
in the dichotomy, numbers that mark the “routes” 
on the cryptanalytic 
map (the analytical 
key) which the student cryptanalyst should follow if he wishes to facilitate his travels along the 
rather complicated and difficult road to success in cryptanalysis, in somewhat the same way in 
which an intelligent motorist follows the routes indicated on a geographical map if he wishes to 
facilitate 
his travels along unfamiliar 
roads. 
The analogy is only partially 
valid, however. 
The motorist usually knows in advance the distant point which he desires to ,reach and he pro- 
ceeds thereto by the best and shortest route, which he finds by observing the route indications 
on a map and following the route markem on ths road. 
Occasionally he encounters a detour 
but these are unexpected di&ulties 
as a rule;. Least of all does he anticipate any necessity for 
journeys down what may soon turn out to be blind alleys and “dead-end” streets, forcing him 
to double back on his way. 
Now the cryptanalyst also has a distant goal in mind-the 
solution 
of the cryptogram at hand-but 
he does not know at the outset of his journey the exact spot 
where it is located on the cryptanalytic 
map. 
The map contains many routes and he proceeds 
* Thie analytical 
key i.a quite analogoue to the analytical 
keys usually found in *the handbooka biologists 
commonly employ in the classification 
and identification 
of living organ*. 
In fact, there are eeversl pointe 
of resemblance b&ween, for example, that branch of biology called taxonomic 
botany and cryptanalysia. 
In 
the former the Cr&, steps in the ctseaificatory 
process are based upon observation 
of exfernaIly 
quite marked 
differences; as the process continuee, the obeervational 
details become tier 
and finer, involving 
more and more 
difficulties as the work progrew. 
Towards the end of the work the botanical taxonomiet 
may have to dissect 
the specimen and study internal characterietics. 
The whole proceaa ia largely a matter of painstaking, 
accurate 
obrvation 
of data and drawing proper conclueions therefrom. 
Except for the fact that the botanical taxonomist 
depends almoat entirely upon ocular observation 
of characteristice 
while the cryptanalyet 
in addition to obeerva- 
tion muet u8e some et&e&ice, the steps taken by the former are quite eimilar to those taken by the latter. 
It ie 
only at the very end of the work that a tignificant 
dieeimilaritg 
between the two wiencea ariees. 
If the botanist 
makes a mistake in observation 
or deduction, 
he merely fails 
to identify 
the specimen correctly; 
he has an 
“answer”-but 
the answer is wrong. 
He may not be cognizant of the error; however, other more skillful botaniets 
will find him out. 
But if the cryptanalyst 
makes a mistake in observation 
or deduction, he faib to get any 
“answer” 
at all; he needs nobody to tell him he bee failed. 
Further, there L one additional 
important 
point of 
difference. 
The botanist is studying 
a bit of Nature--and 
she does not consciously interpose obstacles, pitfalla, 
and diaeimubtiom 
in the path of those trying to solve her myeteriea. 
The cryptanalyst, 
on the other hand, ia 
studying 
a piece of writing 
prepared with the express purpom of preventing 
ita being read by any persona for 
whom it ie not intended. 
The obetacles, pitfalls, and dissimulationa 
are here consciously-interposed 
by the one 
who cryptogrsphed 
the mewe. 
Theee, of course, are what make cryptanalyti 
different and difIicult.

to test them one by one, in a successive chain. 
He encounters many blind alleys and dead-end 
streets, which force him to retrace his steps; he makes many detours and jumps many hurdles. 
Some of these retracings of steps, doubling back on his tracks, jumping of hurdles, and detours 
are unavoidable, but a few are avoidable. 
If properly employed, the analytical key will help 
the careful student to avoid those which should and can be avoided; if it does that much it will 
serve the principal purpose for which it is intended. 
e. The analytical key may, however, serve another purpose of a somewhat different nature. 
When a multitude of cryptographic 
systems of diverse types must be filed in some systematic 
manner apart from the names of the correspondents or other reference data, or if in conducting 
instructional 
activities classificatory designations are desirable, the reference numbers on the 
analytical key may be made to seme as “type numbers.” 
Thus, instead of stating that a given 
cryptogram is a keyword-sysbmatically4xed-uniliteral-monoalphabetic-monographic 
aubstitu- 
tion cipher one may say that it is a ‘Type 901 cryptogram.” 
J. The method of assigning type numbers is quite simple. 
If the student will examine the 
numbers he will note that successive levels in the dichotomy are designated by successive hun- 
dreds. 
Thus, the first level, the classification into cipher and code is assigned the numbers 101 
and 102. On the second level, under cipher, the classification into monographic and polygraphic 
systems is assigned the numbers 201 and 202, etc. 
Numbers in the same hundreds apply 
therefore to systems at the same level in the classification. 
There is no particular virtue in this 
scheme of assigning type numbers except that it provides for a considerable degree of expansion 
in future studies.

PROBLEMS 
1. 
In 
his 
classic 
treatise 
MANUAL FOR THE SOLUTION OF MILITARY CIPHERS 
Captain 
Parker 
Hitt 
said 
that 
there 
were four 
essential 
things 
necessary 
for 
cryptanalytic 
success. 
What were they? 
2. Five 
additional 
elements 
might 
be added to the 
four 
ingredients 
that 
Hitt 
thought 
essential 
to cryptanalytic 
success. 
What are they? 
3. Normally 
four 
fundamental 
operations 
or steps 
are 
involved 
in reach- 
ing 
the 
solution 
of a cryptogram. 
What are they? 
4. 
In 
what 
language 
would 
you expect 
the 
cryptographed 
portion 
of 
the 
following 
message to be written 
? Give 
the reasons 
for 
your 
answer.

In 
the 
final 
analysis 
concerning 
the 
solution 
of cryptograms 
involv- 
ing 
a form 
of 
substitution 
to 
what 
simple 
terms 
must 
the 
cryptograms 
be reduced 
in order 
to reach 
a solution? 
6. In order 
to reconstruct 
plaintext 
is 
it 
always 
necessary 
to determine 
the 
specific 
key used by the correspondents? 
7. The words 
of 
sentences 
in the 
following 
examples 
have been transpos- 
ed. Rearrange 
the words 
to make the probable 
original

8. Letters 
of various 
words 
in the 
sentences 
below 
have been transposed. 
Rearrange 
the

a cryptogram 
that 
is 
obviously 
a monoalphabetic 
sub- 
stitution 
cipher, 
if

alphabet 
may be assumed to have 
been used? 
30. 
Monoalphabetic 
substitution 
ciphers 
which 
involve 
standard 
cipher 
alphabets

FOREWORD
We are proud to add this book,
MILITARY CRYPTANALYSTS, PART II, recently
declassified by the U.S. Government,
to our Cryptographic Series.
As in the
case of MILITARY CRYPTANALYSIS, PART 1,
we have added a large number of
problems to the book.
These problems,
largely keyed to the order that the
material is presented in the text,
not only will provide the student with
many hours of enjoyment,
but at the same time will act as the ultimate
teaching aid.
In keeping with what might be termed modern cryptologic advances, we have
also added to the book some computer programs.
There is no doubt that the
computer has greatly affected modern cryptology,
and today cryptographic and
cryptanalytic "tasks"
which at one time took hours and even days to accomp-
lish can now be done in seconds, if not microseconds.
The added computer
programs,
found at the end of the book, following the problems, are only
representative of the many programs that can be used with the large class of
cipher systems discussed in this book*
The student should set his sights on
modifying, improving,
and developing other programs which will assist him in
his solution efforts.
Comments concerning this book,
or any book in our Cryptographic Series,
are always greatly received.

1. The essential diflerenoe between monoalphabetio and polyalphabedo anbstitution.-u. 
In the substitution methods thus far discussed it has been pointed out that their basic feature 
is that of monoalphabeticity. 
F’rom the cryptanalyti~ standpint, 
neither the nature of the 
cipher symbols, nor their method of production is an essential feature, although these may be 
difIerentiating charaoteristics from the cryptographic etandpoint. 
It is true that in those caeee 
designated as monoalphabetic substitution with variants or multiple equivalents, there is a 
departure, more or less considerable, from strict monoalphabeticity. 
In some of tbose cases, 
indeed, there may be available two or more wholly independent sets of equivalents, which, 
moreover, may even be arranged in the form of completely separate alphabets. Thus, while a 
loose terminology might permit one to designate such systems as polyalphabetic, it is better to 
reserve this nomenolature for those cases wherein polyalphabeticity is the essence of the method, 
specifically introduced with tbe purpose of imparting a po&onal variation in the substitutive 
equivalents for plain-text letters, in accordance with some rule directly or indirectly connected 
with the absolute positions tbe plain-text lettem occupy in the message. This point calls for 
amplification. 
b. In monoalphabetic substitution with variants the object of having di%rent or multiple 
equivalents is to suppress, so far as possible by simple methods, the characteristic frequencies 
of the letters occurring in plain text. 
As has been noted, it is by means of these characteristic 
frequencies that the cipher equivalents can usually be identified. 
In these systems the varying 
equivalents for plain-text letters are subject to the free choice and caprice of the enciphering 
olerk; if he is careful and conscientious in the work, he will really make use of all the dSrent 
equivalents afforded by the system; but if he is slip-shod and hurried in his work, he will use the 
same equivalents repeatedly rather than take pains and time to refer to the charts, tables, or 
diagrams to find the variants. 
Moreover, and this is a crucial point, even if the individual 
enciphering clerks are extremely careful, when many of them employ the same system it is entirely 
impossible to insure a complete diversity in the encipherments produced by two or more clerks 
working at ditIerent message centers. The result is inevitably to produce plenty of repetitions 
in the texts emanating from several stations, and when texts such as these are all available for 
study they are open to solution, by a comparison of their &uilarities and differences. 
c. In true polyalphabetic systems, on the other hand, there is established a rather deflnita 
procedure which automatically determines the shifts or changes in equivalents or in the manner 
in which they sre introduced, so that these changes are beyond the momentary whim or choice of 
the enciphering clerk. 
When the method of shifting or changing the equivalents is scientifically 
sound and sufllciently complex, the research necessary to establish the values of the cipher 
characters is much more prolonged and diflicult than is the case even in complicated monoalphsr 
betic substitution with variants, as will later be seen. These are the objects of true polyalpha- 
betic substitution systems. The number of such systems is quite large, and it will be possible to

describe in detail the cryptan@eis 
of only a few of the more common or typical examplea of 
methods encountered in practical military communications. 
d. The three methods, (1) single-equivalent monoalphabetic substitution, 
(2) monoalpha- 
bet& substitution withy variants, and (3) true polyalphabetic substitution, show the following 
relationships as regards the equivalency between plain-text and cipher-text unite: 
A. In method (I), there is a set of 26 symbols; a plain&xt 
letter is always represented by 
one and only one of these symbois; conversely, a symbol always repreaente the same piain=text 
letter. 
The equivalence between the plain-text and the cipher letters is constant in both enci- 
pherment and decipherment. 
B. In method (2), there is a set of n symbols, where 1) may be any number greater than 26 
and often is a multiple of that number; a plain4ext letter may be represented by 1,2, 3, . . . 
Merent 
symbols; conversely, a symbol always representi the same plain-text letter, the same as 
is the case in method (I). 
The equivalence between the plain-text and the cipher letters is 
variable in encipherment but constant in decipherment.l 
C. In method (3) there is, as in the first method, a set of 26 symbols; a plain-text letter 
may be represented by 1,2,3, 
. . . 26 diRerent symbols; convemely, a symbol may repreeent 
1, 2, 3, . . . 26 difEerent plain text letters, depending upon the system and the specS~ key. 
The equivalence between the plain-text and the cipher letters is variable in both encipherment 
and decipherment. 
2. Primary clastioation oi polyalphabetio systems.--a. 
A primary &r&cation 
of poly- 
alphabetic systems into two rather distinct typee may be made: (1) periodic systems and (2) 
aperiodic system& When the enciphering prooees involves a cryptographic treatment which is 
repetitive in character, and which results in the production of cyclic pW 
in the crypto- 
graphic text, the system is termed p&&c. 
When the enciphering process is not of the type 
described in the foregoing general terms, the system is termed aperio&. 
The substitution in 
both cases involvea the use of two or more cipher alphabeta. 
b. The cyc+ phenomena inherent in a periodic system may be exhibited externally, in 
which case they are said to be paten& or they may not be exhibited exteunally, and must be un- 
covered by a preliminary step in the analyeia, in whioh case they are said to be Zutent. 
The 
periodicity may be quite definite in nature, and therefore determinable with mathematical 
exactitude allowing for no variability, in which case the periodicity is said to be&&. 
In other 
instancea the periodicity is more or less flexible in character and even though it may be deter-

minable mathematically, allowance must be made for a degree of variability subject to limits 
controlled by the specific system under investigation. 
The periodicity is in this case said to be 
&xibb, or lxlriabb withk limits. 
3. primary classification of periodic systems.--+. Periodic polyalphabetic substitution 
systems may primarily be classified into two kinds: 
(1) Those in which only a few of a whole set of cipher alphabets are used in enciphering 
individual messages, these alphabet8 being employed repeatedly in a fixed sequence throughout each 
message. Because it is usual to employ a secret word, phrase, or number a8 a key to determine 
the number, identity, and sequence with which the cipher alphabets are employed, and this 
key is used over and over again in encipherment, this method is often called the repea&ng-key 
system, or the repeating-alphabet system. It is also sometime8 referred to as the mu&iple&pha- 
bd system because if the keying of the entire message be considered as a whole it is composed 
of multiples of a short key. used repetitively? 
In this text the designation “repeating-key 
system” will be used. 
(2) Those in which all the cipher alphabets comprising the complete set for the system are 
employed one after the other successively in the encipherment of a message, and when the 
last alphabet of the series hae been used, the encipherer begins over again with the first alphabet. 
This is commonly referred to as a progres&ealpMet 
system because the cipher alphabets are 
used in progression. 
4. Sequence of study of polyalphabetio systems.-o. 
In the studies to be followed in con- 
nection with polyalphabetic systems, the order in which the work will proceed conform8 very 
closely to the classifications made in paragraphs 2 and 3. Periodic polyalphabetic substitution 
ciphers will come first, because they are, se a rule, the simpler and becau8e a thorough under- 
standing of the principles of their analysis is prerequisite to a comprehension of how aperiodic 
systems are solved. But in the final analy8i8 the solution of examples of both types r&e upon 
the conversion or reduction of polyalphabeticity 
into monoalphabeticity. 
If this i8 possible, 
solution can alwaya be achieved, granted there are sutbcient data in the fmal monoalphabetic 
distributions to permit of solution by recourse to the ordinary principles of frequency. 
b. First in the order of study of periodic systems will come the analysis of repeating-key 
systems. Some of the more simple varieties will be discussed in detail, with examples. Subee- 
quently, cipher8 of the progre8sive type will be discussed. There will then follow a more or leas 
detailed treatment of aperiodic systems. 
s Frenoh Wmiuology ti 
this the “double-key method”, but there is no logio in suoh nomenclature.

5. Claatioation 
of cipher alphabets upon the baais of their derivation-o. 
The substitu- 
tion processes in polyalphabetic methods involve the use of a plurality 
of cipher alphabets. 
The latter may be derived by various schemes, the exact nature of which determines the principal 
characteristics of the cipher alphabets and plays a very important role in the preparation and 
solution of polyalphabetic cryptograms. 
For these reasons it is advisable, before proceeding to a 
discussion of the principles and methods of analysis, to point out these various types of cipher 
alphabets, show how they are produced, and how the method of their production or derivation 
may be made to yield important clues and short-cuts in analysis. 
b. A primary classiCcation of cipher alphabets for polyalphabetic substitution may be made 
into the two following types: 
(1) Independent or unrelated cipher alphabets. 
(2) Derived or interrelated cipher alphabets. 
c. Independent cipher alphabets may be disposed of in a very few words. They are merely 
separate and distinct alphabets showing no relationship to one another in any way. 
They may 
be compiled by the various methods discussed in Section IX of Eztmentary Military 
Cryptography. 
The solution of cryptograms written by means of such alphabets is rendered more diEcult by 
reason of the absence of any relationship between the equivalents of one cipher alphabet and 
those of any of the other alphabets of the same cryptogram. 
On the other hand, from the point of 
view of practicability in their production and their handling in cryptographing and decryptograph- 
ing, they present some di&ulties 
which make them less favored by cryptographers than cipher 
alphabets of the second type. 
d. Derived or interrelated alphabets, as their name indicates, are most commonly produced 
by the i&ra&on 
of two primary components, which when juxtaposed at the various points of 
coincidence can be made to yield 8ecoRdapy a&&zbekl 
6. Primary components and secondary alphabets.- Two basic, slidable sequences or com- 
ponents of n characters each will yield n secondary alphabets. The components may be &ssi- 
fied according to various schemes. For cryptanalytic purposes the following classification will be 
found useful: 
CASE A. The primary components are both normal sequences. 
(1) The sequences proceed in the same direction. 
(The secondary alphabets are direct 
standard alphabets.) 
(Pars. 13-15.) 
(2) The sequences proceed in opposite directions. 
(The secondary alphabets are reversed 
standard alphabets; they are also reciprocal cipher alphabets.) 
(Par. l3i, 14g.) 
CASE B. The primary componeuta are not both normal sequences. 
(1) The plain component is normal, the cipher component is a mixed sequence. (The 
secondary alphabets are mixed alphabets.)

(2) The plain component is a mixed sequence, the cipher component is normal. 
(The 
secondary alphabets are mixed alphabets.) 
(Par. 26.) 
(3) Both components are mixed sequences. 
(a) Components are identical mixed sequences. 
I. Sequences proceed in the same direction. 
(The secondary alphabets are 
mixed alphabets.) 
(Par. 28.) 
II. Sequences proceed in opposite directions. 
(The secondary alphabets are 
reciprocal mixed alphabets.) 
(Par. 38.) 
(b) Components are different mixed sequences. (The secondary alphabets are mixed 
alphabets.) 
(Par. 39.) 
7. Primary components, cipher disks, and square tables.+. 
In preceding texts it has 
been shown that the equivalents obtainable from the use of quadricular or square tables may be 
duplicated by the use of revolving cipher disks or of sliding primary components. It was also 
stated that there are various ways of employing such tables, disks, and sliding components. 
Cryptographically 
t*he results may be quite diverse from different methods of using such para- 
phernalia, since the specific equivalents obtained from one method may be altogether different 
from those obtained from another method. 
But from the cryptanalytic 
point of view the 
diversity referred to is of little significance; only in one or two csses does the specific method of 
employing these cryptographic instrumentalities have an important bearing upon the procedure 
in cryptanalysis. 
However, it is advisable that the student learn something about these different 
methods before proceeding with further work. 
b. There are, not two, but four letters involved in every case of tiding equivalents by means 
of sliding primary components; furthermore, the determination of an equivalent for a given 
plain-text letter is representable by two equations involving four 
elements, usually letters. 
Three of these letters are by this time well-known to and understood by the student, viz, G,, C,, 
and 8,. 
The fourth element or letter has been passed over without much comment, but crypto- 
graphically it is just as important a factor as the other three. 
Its function may best be indicated 
by noting what happens when two primary components are juxtaposed, for the purpose of tiding 
equivalents. 
Suppose these components are the following sequences: 
(1)ABCDEFGHIJKLNNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
(2)FBPYRCQZIGSEHTDJUMKVALWNOX 
Now suppose one is merely asked to &id the equivalent of P, when the key letter is K. Without 
further specification, the cipher equivalent cannot be stated; for it is necessary to know not only 
which K will be used as the key letter, the one in the component labeled (1) or the one in the 
component labeled (2), but also what letter the Kk will be set against, in order to juxtapose the 
two components. Most of the time, in preceding texts, these two factors have been tacitly 
assumed to be fixed and well understood: the r<, is sought in the mixed, or cipher component, 
and this K is set against A in the normal, or plain component. 
Thus:

c. The letter A in this case may be termed the iti 
f&u-, symbolized A,. The iudexletter 
constitutes the fourth element involved in the two equations applicable to the 6miing of equiva- 
lents by sliding componenta. 
The four elements are therefore theee: 
(19 The key letter, 0k 
(2) The index letter, 8c 
(3) The plejn-tea letter, h 
(4) The cipher letter, 8. 
The index letter is commonly the initial letter of the component; but this, too, ia only a con- 
vention. 
It nrisrJ be any Z&r of the se~nence constituting the component, as agreed upon by 
the correspondenti.

d. In the foregoing case the enciphering equations are aa follows: 
Q b=Ai; 
P,=z, 
But there is nothing about the use of sliding components which excludes other methods of fluding 
cquivalenta’than 
that shown above. For instance, de+spite the labeling of the two components 
ae shown above, there is nothing to prevent one from seeking the plain-text letter in the com- 
ponent labeled (2), that is, the cipher component, and taking ae ita cipher equivalent the letter 
opposite it in the other component labeled (1).

(II) K.=A,;P,=K. 
e. Since equations (I) and (II) yield different resultants, even with the same index, key, 
and plain-text letters, it is obvious that an accurate formula to cover a specific pair of enciphering 
equations must include data showing in *hat component each of the four lettera comprising the 
equations is located. 
Thus, equations (I) and (II) should read: 
(I) Kk in component (2)=-A, in component (1) ; Pv in component (l)=Z, 
in component (2). 
(II) Kk in component (2)=A, in component (1); P, in component (2)= K, in component (1).

f. Employing 
two sliding componenta and the four letters entering into an enciphering 
equation, there are, in all, twelve diGrent 
resultants poseible for the same set of components 
and the same set of four basic elements. 
These twelve di&mncea in resultants arise from a set 
of twelve different enciphering conditions, ae set forth below (the notation adopted in sub- 
paragraph 6 is used):

g. The twelve resultants obtainable from juxtaposing sliding components aa indicated under 
the preceding subparagraph may also be obtained either from one square table, in which case 
twelve different methods of finding equivalents must be applied, or from twelve different square 
tables, in which case one standard method of fInding equivalents will serve all purposes. 
h. If but one table such as that shown below as Table I-A is employed, the various methods 
of &ding equivalents are d.%icult to keep in mind.

Only three different methods have been shown and the student no doubt already has encountered 
difficulty in keeping them segregated in his mind. 
It would obviously be very confusing to try 
to remember all twelve methods. 
But if one standard or fixed method of finding equivalents is 
followed with several d&rent 
tables, then this dlfhculty dwlppears. 
Suppose that the following 
method is adopted: Arrange the square so that the plain-text letter may be sought in a separate 
sequence, arranged alphabetically, above the square and so that the key letter may be sought 
in a separate sequence, also armnged alphabetically, to the left of the square; look for the plain- 
text letter in the top row; locate the key letter in the 1st column to the left; find the letter stand- 
ing within the square at the intersection of the vertical and horixontal lines thus determined. 
Then tweh squares, equivalent to the twelve d&rent 
conditions listed in subparagraph f, can 
readily be constructed. 
They are all shown in Appendix 1, pp. W-107. 
i. When these square tables are examined carefully, certain interesting points are noted. 
In the first place, the tables may be paired so that one of a pair may serve for enciphering and the 
other of the pair may serve for deciphering, or vice versa. For example, tables I and II bear this 
reciprocal relationship to each other; III and IV, V and VI, VII and VIII, IX and X, XI and 
XII. 
In the second place, the internal dispositions of the letters, although the tables are derived 
from the same pair of components, are quite diverse. For example, in table I-B the horixontal 
sequences are identical with those of Table I-A, but are merely displaced to the right and to the 
left different intervals according to the successive key letters. 
Hence this square shows what 
may be termed a horizontally-displaced, 
direct symmetry of the cipher component. 
Vertically, 
it shows no symmetry, or if there is symmetry, it is not visible.* 
But when Table I-B is more 
carefully examined, an invisible, or indirect, vertical symmetry may be discerned. where at first 
glance it is not apparent. 
If one takes any two colvmne of the table, it is found that the interval 
between the members of any pair of letters in one column is the same as the interval between the 
members of the homologous pair of letters in the other column, if the. dietant% ie mca8ured on th-e 
tiphe 
component. For example, consider the 2d and 15th columns (headed by L and I, respec- 
tidy) 
; take the letters P and G in the 2d column, and J and W in the 15th column. The distance 
between P andG on the cipher component is 7 intervals: the distance between J and W on the same 
component is uZ80 7 intervals. 
This phenomenon implies a kind of hidden, or latent, or indirect 
symmetry within the cipher square. 
In fact, it may. be stated that every table which sets forth 
in systematic fashion the various secondary alphabete derivable by sliding two primary sequences 
through all points of coincidence to find cipher equivalents must show some kind of symmetry,

both horizontally and vertically. 
The symmetry may be termed Z&Y&% or direct, if the sequences 
of letters in the rows (or columns) are the same throughout and &re identical with that of one 
of the primary components; it may be termed hidden or indirect if the sequences of letters in the 
rows or columns are different, apparently not related to either of the components, but are in 
reality decimations of one of the primary components. 
j. When the twelve tables of Appendix 181~ ex8mined in the light of the foregoing remarks, 
the type of symmetry found in each may be sumnmrixed in the following manner:

Of these twelve types of cipher squares, corresponding to the twelve different ways of using a 
pair of sliding primary components to derive secondary alphabets, the ones best known snd 
most often encountered in cryptogr8phic studies 8re Tables I-B and II, referred to 8s being of 
the Vigenere type; Tables V and VI, referred to 8s be@ of the Beaufort type; and Tables IX 
and X, referred to 8s being of the Delastelle type. 
It will be noted that the tables of the Dela- 
stdle type show no direct or visible symmetry, either horixont8lly or vertics.lly and because of 
this 8re supposed to yield more security than do sny of the other types of tables. But it will 
presently be shown that the supposed increase in security is more illusory thns re8l. 
k. The foregoing facts concerning the vasious types of qu8dricular tables generated by diverse 
*methods of using sliding primary components or their equiv8lent rotating cipher disks will be 
employed to good advantage, when the studies presently to be undertaken will bring the student 
to the place where he can comprehend them in the axmlysis of polyalphabetic systems. But in 
order not to confuse him with a multiplicity of det$s which have no direct bearing upon basic 
principles, one and only one standard method of finding equivrtlents by means of sliding compo- 
nents will be selected from among the twelve available, 8s set forth in the preceding subpara- 
graphs. Unless otherwise stated, this method will be the one denoted by the first of the formulae 
listed in subpar.f, tiz: 
%t=%l; 
$/1- -%/a 
CMli.ng the pl8in component “1” asd the cipher component “‘2”, this will mean that the keyletter 
on the cipher component will be set opposite the index, which will be the first letter of the plain 
component; the plain-text letter to be enciphered will then be sought on the plain component and 
its equivalent will be the letter opposite it on the cipher component.

The method of enciphering 
ackling 
to the principle of the repeating key, or repeating alphabeta is adequately explained in 
Section XI of Elementary MGtary Cyptogmphy, and no further referenoe need be made at this 
time. 
The analysis of a cryptogram of this type, regardless of the kind of cipher alphabeta 
employed9 or their method of production, 1~4.~89 itself i&o three distinct and succwsive~ stepa 
(1) Determination of the length of the repeating key, which ia the &me as the determination 
of the exact number of alphabeti involved in the oryptograrn; 
(2) Allocation or distribution of the letters of the cipher text into the respective cipher alpha- 
beta to which they belong. 
This is the step which reducea the polyalphabetic text to mono- 
alphabetic terms; 
(3) Analysis of the individual monoalphabetic distributions to determine plain-text values of 
the cipher lettera in each distribution or alphabet. 
b. The foregoing steps will be treatad in the order in which mentioned. 
The first step may 
be described briefly as that of dstsnnining tha pe&L

9. Fimt step : &uiing the length of the peuiod.-a. 
The determination of the period, that 
ia, the length of the key or the number of cipher alphabets involved in a cryptogram enciphered 
by the repeating-key method is, as a rule, a relatively simple matter. 
The cryptogram itself 
usually manifests externaUy certain phenomena whi& are the direct result of the use of a repeat- 
ing key. 
The principles involved are, however, so fundamental in cryptanalyais that their 
elucidation warrants a somewhat detailed treatment. 
This will be done in connection with a 
short example of encipherment, &own in sig. 1.

b. Regardless of what system ia used, identical plain-text letters enciphered by the same 
cipher alphabet 1 must yield identical cipher letters. 
Referring to Fig. 1, such 8 condition is 
brought about every time that identical plain-text lettera happen to be enciphered with the same 
key-letter, or every time identical plain-text letters fall into the same column in the encipher- 
ment.* 
Now since the number of columns or positiona with respect to the key is very limited 
(axcept in the case of very long key words), and since the repetition of letters is an inevitable 
condition in plain text, it follows that there will be in a message of fair length many casea where 
identical plain-text letters mwt fall into the same column 
They wilI thus be enciphered by the 
same cipher alphabet, resulting, therefore, in the produotion of many identical letters in the 
cipher text and these will represent identical letters in the plain text. When identical plain-text 
polygraphs fall into identical columns the result is the formation of identical cipher-text poly- 
grrtphs, that is, repetitions of groups of 2, 3, 4, . . . letters 8re exhibited in the cryptogram. 
Repetitions of this type will hereafter be called causal repetifions, because they are produced by 
8 definite, traceable cause, z&r, the encipherment of identical letters by the same cipher alphabets. 
c. It will also happen, however, that di#ernt 
plain-text letters falling in d$erent columns 
will, by mere sccident, produce identical cipher letters. 
Note, for example, in Fig. 1 th8t in 
Column 1, R, becomes S, and that in Column 2,H,, also becomes S,. 
The production of an identical 
cipher text letter in these two cases (that is, a repetition where the plain-text letters are difIerent 
and enciphered by different alphabets) is merely fortuitous. 
It is, in every day language, “a 
mere coincidence”, or “an accident.” 
For this reason repetitions of this type will hereafter be 
c8lled accidental repetitions. 
d. A consideration of the phenomenon pointed out in c makes it obvious that in polyalpha- 
betic ciphers it is important that the cryptanalyst be able to tell whether the repetitions he &ids 
in a specific case are causal or accidental in their origin, that is, whether they represent actual 
encipherments of identical plain-text letters by identical keying elements, or mere coincidences 
brought about purely fortuitously. 
e. Now accidental repetitions will, of course, happen fairly frequently with individual letters, 
but less frequently with digmphs, because in this case the same kind of an “accident” must take 
place twice in succession. Intuitively 
one feels that the chances that such 8 purely fortuitous 
coincidence will happen two times in succession must be much less than that it will happen every 
once in 8 while in the case of single letters. Similarly, intuition makes one feel that the chances 
of such accidents happening in the case of three or more consecutive letters are still less than in 
the case of digraphs, decreasing very rapidly as the repetition increases in length, 
f. The phenomena of cryptogr8phic repetition may, fortunately, be dealt with statistically, 
thus taking the matter outside the realm of intuition and putting it on a firm mathematical or 
objective basis. Moreover, often the statistical analysis will tell the cryptanalyst when he has 
arranged or rearranged his text properly,that 
is, when he is approaching or has reached mono- 
alphabeticity 
in his efforts to reduce polyalphabetic text to its simplest terms. 
However, in 
order to preserve continuity of thought it is deemed inadvisable to inject these statistical con- 
siderations at this place in the text proper; they have been incorporated in Appendix 2 hereof. 
The student is advised to study the Appendix very carefully after he haa fInished reading this 
section of the text. 
g. At this point it will merely be indicated that if a cryptanalyst were to have at hand only 
the cryptogram of Fii. 1, with the repetitions underlined as below, a statistical study of the

number and length of the repetitions within the message (Par. 5 of Appendix 2) would tell him 
that while some of the digraphic repetitions may be accidental, the chances that they all are 
accidental are small. In the case of the tetragraphic ‘repetition he would realize that the 
chances of its being accidental are very small indeed.

h. A consideration of the facts therefore leads to but one conclusion, z&z, that the repetitions 
exhibited by the cryptogram under investigation are not accidental but are cawral in their origin; 
and the cause is in this case not difficult to find: repetitions in the plain text were actually en- 
ciphered by identical alphabets. In order for this to occur, it was necessary that the tetragraph 
USYE, for example, fall both times in em.ctZy the same relative position with respect to the key. 
Note, for example, that USYE in Fig. 1 represents in both cases the plain-text polygraph THEA. 
The first time it occurred it fell in positions l-2-3-4 with respect to the key; the second time it 
occurred it happened to fall in the very same relative positions, although it might just aa well 
have happened to fall in any of the other three possible relative positions with respect to the 
key, wiz, 2-3-4-1, 3-4-l-2, 
or 4-l-2-3. 
i. Lest the student be misled, however, a few more words are necessary on this subject. 
In the preceding subparagraph the word “happened” was used; this word correctly expresses 
the idea in mind, because the insertion or deletion of a single plain-text letter between the two 
occurrences would have thrown the second occurrence one letter forward or backward, respec- 
tively, and thus caused the polygraph to be enciphered,by a sequence’of alphabets such as can 
no longer produce the cipher polygraph USYE from the plain-text polygraph THEA. On the 
other hand, the insertion or deletion of this one letter might bring the letters of some other 
polygraph into similar columns so that some other repetition would be exhibitedin 
case the 
USYE repetition had thus been suppressed. 
j. The encipherment of similar letters by similar cipher alphabets is therefore the curse of 
the production of repetitions in the cipher text in the case of repeating-key ciphers. What 
principles can be derived from this fact, and how can they be employed in the solution of crypto- 
grams of this type? 
k. If a count is made of the number of letters from and including the first USYE to, but not 
including, the second occurrence of USYE, a total of 40 letters is found to intervene between the 
two occurrences. This number, 40, must, of course, be an exact multiple of the length of the key. 
Having the plain-text before one, it is easily seen that it is the 10th multiple; that is, the 4-letter 
key has repeated itself 10 times between the first and the second occurrence of USYE. It follows, 
therefore, that if the length of the key were not known, the number 40 could safely be taken to 
be an exact multiple of the length of the key; in other words, one of the factors of the number 
40 would be equal to the length of the key. 
The word “safely” is used in the preceding sentence 
to mean that the interval 40 applies to a repetition of 4 letters and it has been shown that the 
chances that this repetition is accidental are small. The factors of 40 are 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 20. 
So far as this single repetition of USYE is concerned, if the length of the key were not known, all 
that could be said about the latter would be that it is equal to one of these factors. 
tion by itself gives no further indications.

m. Are all these repetitions cuusul repetitions? 
It can be shown (Appendix 2, par. 4c) that 
the odds against a theory that the, USYE repetition is accidental are about 99 to 1 (since the 
probability for its occurrence is.01). 
It can also be shown that the odds against a theory that the 
10 digraphs which occur two or more times are accidental repetitions are over 4 to 1 (Appendix 
2, par. 5~) ; the odds against a theory that the two digraphs which occur 3 times are accidental 
repetitions are quite large. 
(Probability is calculated to be about .06.) The chances are very 
great, therefore, that all or nearly all these repetitions are causal. 
Certainly the chances against 
the two occurrences of the tetragraphUSYE and the three occurrencesof the two different digrapha 
(LE and US) being accidental are quite high, and it is therefore not sstonishing that tbe intervals 
between all the vnrious repetitions, except in one case, contain the factors 2 and 4. 
n. This means that if the cipher is written out in either 2 columns or 4 columns, all these 
repetitions (except the CX repetition) would fall into the same columns. 
From this it follows 
that the length of the key is either 2 or 4, the latter, on practical grounds, being more probable 
than the former. 
Doubts concerning the matter of choosing between a a-letter and a 4-letter 
key will be dissolved when the cipher text is distributed into its component uniliteral frequency 
distributions. 
o. The repeated digraph CX in the foregoing mess-e is an accidental repetition, as will be 
apparent by referring to Fig. 1. Had the message been longer there would have been more 
such accidental repetitions, but, on the other hand, there would be a proportionately 
greater 
number of causal repetitions. 
This is because the phenomenon of repetition in plain text i 
so all-pervading. 
p. Sometimes it happens that the cryptanalyst quickly notes a repetition of a polygraph of 
four or more letters, the interval between the first and second occurrences of which has only 
two factors, of which one is a relatively small number, the other a. relatively high incommen- 
surable number. 
He may therefore assume at once that the length of the key is equal to the 
smaller factor without 
searching for additional recurrences upon which to corroborate his 
assumption. 
Suppose, for example, that in a relatively short cryptogram the interval between 
the first and second occurrences of a polygraph of five letters h+gens to be a number such as 
203, the factors of which are 7 and 29. Evidently the number of alphabets may at once be

15 
assumed to be 7, unless one is dealing with messagea exchanged among correspondents known 
to use long keys. In the latter case one could assume the number of alphabets to be 29. 
Q. The forgoing method of determining the period in a polyalphabetic cipher is commonly 
referred to in the literature asi’fa&ring 
the intervals between repetitions”; or more often it is 
simply called “factoring.” 
Because the latter is an apt term and is brief, it will be employed 
hereafter in this text to designate the process. 
10. General remarks on factoring.-o. 
The statement made in Par. 2 with respect to the 
cyclic phenomena said to be exhibited in cryptograms of the periodic type now becomes clear. 
The use of a short repeating key produces a periodicity of recurrences or repetitions collectively 
termed “cyclic phenomena”, an analysis of which leads to a determination of the length of the 
period or cycle, and this gives the length of the key. 
Only in the case of relativeiy short crypto- 
grams enciphered by a relatively long key does factoring fail to lead to the correct determination 
of the number of cipher alphabets in a repeating-key cipher; and of course, the fact that a crypto- 
gram contains repetitions whose factors show constancy is in itself an indication and test of its 
periodic nature. 
It also follows that if the cryptogram is not a repeating-key cipher, then 
.factoring will show no definite results, and conversely the fact that it does not yield definite 
result.43 at once indicates that the cryptogram is not a periodic, repeating-key cipher. 
b. There are two caees in which factoring leads to no definite resulta. One is in the case of 
monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. Here recurrences are very plentiful as a rule, and the 
intervals separating these recurrences may be fa&m3d, bud the factors 
wiu 
show no Con8tancy; 
there will be several factors common to many or most of the recurrences. This in itself is an 
indication of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, if the very fact of the presence of many 
recurrencea fails to impress itself upon the inexperienced cryptanalyst. 
The other c&se in which 
the process of factoring is nonsigmficant involves certain types of nonperiodic, polyalphabetic 
ciphers, In certain of these ciphers recurrences of digraphs, trigraphs, and even polygraphs 
may be plentiful in a long message, but the intervals between such recurrences bear no definite 
multiple relation to the length of the key, such as in the case of the true periodic, repeating-key 
cipher, in which the alphabets change with successive letters and repeat themselves over and 
over again. 
c. Factoring is not the only method of determining the length of the period of a periodic, 
polyalphabetic substitution cipher, although it is by far the most common and easily applied. 
At this point it will merely be stated that when the message under study is relatively short in 
comparison with the length of the key, so that there are only a few cycles of cipher text and no 
long repetitions affording a basis for factoring, there are several other methods available. 
However, it being deemed inadvisable to interject the data concerning those other methods 
at this point, they will be explained subsequently. 
It is desirable at this juncture merely to 
indicate that methods other than factoring do exist and are used in practical work. 
d. Fundamentally, the factoring process is merely a more or less simple mathematical method 
of studying the phenomena of periodicity in cryptograms. 
It will usually enable the crypt- 
analyst to ascertain definitely whether or not a given cryptogram is periodic in nature, and if 
so, the length of the period, stated 
in terms 
of the cryptographic 
unit 
involved. 
By the latter 
statement is meant that the factoring process may be applied not only in analyzing the periodicity 
manifested by cryptograms in which the plain-text uuits subjected to cryptographic treatment 
are monographic in nature (i. e. are single letters) but also in studying the periodicity exhibited 
by those occasional cryptograms wherein the plain-text units are digraphic, trigraphic, or 
n-graphic in character. The student should bear this point in mind when he comes to the study 
of substitution systems of the latter sort. However, the present text will deal solely with cases 
of the former type, wherein the plain-text units subjected to cryptographic treatment are single 
letters.

11. Second step: distributing 
the cipher text into the oomponent monoalphabek.-u. 
After the number of cipher alphabets involved in the cryptogram has been ascertained, the next 
step is to rewrite the message in groups corresponding to the length of the key, or in columnar 
fashion, whichever is more’convenient, and this automatically divides up the text so that the 
lettera belonging to the same cipher alphabet occupy similar positions in the groups, or, if the 
colum~~ar method is used, fall in the same column. 
The letters are thus allocated or distributed 
into the respective cipher alphabets to which they belong. 
This reduces the polyalphabetic 
tent to monoalphabetic terms. 
b. Then separate uniliteral frequency distributions for the thus isolated individual alphabeta 
are compiled. For example, in the case of the cipher on page. 13, having determined that four 
alphabeta are involved, and having rewritten the mesaage in four columna, a frequency diatribu- 
tion is made of the letters in Column 1, another is made of the letters in Column 2, and so on for 
the rest of the columns. 
Each, of tha resu&ng diatributiona ia thmafora a monoaZphabsticfrapncy 
dietrihhon. 
If these distributions 
do not give the characteristic irregular crest and trough 
appearance of monoalphabetic frequency distributions, 
then the analysis which led to the 
hypothesis as regards the number of alphabets involved ia fallacious. 
In fact, the appearance of 
these individual distributions may be conaidered to be an index of the co~ectnees of the factoring 
process;‘for theoretically, and practically, the individual distributiona constructed upon the 
correct hypothesis will tend to conform more closely fo the irregular crest and trough appearacne 
of a monoalphabetic frequency distribution 
than will the graphic tables constructed upon an 
incorrect hypothesis. 
These individual distributions may also be teeted for monoalphaheticity 
by statistical methods. 
12. Third step : solving the monoalphabetic distributions.-The 
difbculty experienced in 
analyzing the individual or isolated frequency distributions depends mostly upon the type of 
cipher alphabets that is used. It is apparent that mixed alphabets may be used just as easily aa 
standard alphabets, and, of course, the cipher lettera themselves give no indication aa to which 
is the case. However, just as it wae found that in the case of monoalphabeticaubatitution 
ciphers, 
a uniliteral frequency distribution gives clear indications as to whether the cipher alphabet ia a 
standard or a mixed alphabet, by the relative positions and extensions of the crests and troughs 
in the table, so it is found that in the case of repeating-key ciphers, uniliteral frequency distribu- 
tiona for the isolated or individual alphabets will also give clear indications aa to whether these 
alphabets are standard alphabets or mixed alphabets. 
Only one or two such frequency distribu- 
tions are necessary for this determination; if they appear to be standard alphabets, similar distri- 
butions can be made for the rest of the alphabets; but if they appear to be mixed alphabets, then 
it is beat to compile triliteral frequency distributions for all the alphabets. 
The analysis of the 
values of the cipher lettera in each table proceeds &IQ the same linea aa in the case of monoalpha- 
betic ciphers. 
The analysis ia more difbcult only because of the reduced size of the tablee, but 
if the message be very long, then each frequency distribution will contain a sufficient number of 
elements to enable a speedy solution to be achieved.

b. The factor 5 appear in all but two cases, each of which involves only a digraph. 
It seems 
almost certain that the number of alphabets is five. 
Since the text already appears in groups Of 
five letters, it is unnecessary to rewrite the message. The next step is to make a uniliteral fre- 
quency distribution for Alphabet 1 to see if it can be determined whether or not atandrrrd alpha- 
beta are involved. 
It is as follows: 
ALPWET 
c. Although the indications are not very clear cut, yet if one takes into consideration the 
small amount of data the assumption of a direct standard alphabet with Wa=A,,, is worth further 
test. 
Accordingly a similar distribution is made for Alphabet 2.

6. After but little experiment it is found that the distributions can best be made to fit 
the normal when the following values are assumed:

A,,=W.

Alphabet 3,,,--- 
A,,= I, 
Alphabet 4 __-_-_- &=Td 
Alphabet 5 _____-__ A,,=E, 
f. Note the key word given by the successive equivalents of A,: WHITE

the correctness of the analysis is, of course, to test the values of the solved alphabets on the 
cryptogram.

h. Intelligible text at once results, and the solution can now be completed very quickly. 
The complete message is as follows:

PANY IN TRUCKS NEAREMMITSBURG. AM HOLDING MIDDLE CREEK NEARHILL 543 SOUTH-

i. In the foregoing example (which is typical of the system erroneously attributed, in cryp- 
tographic literature, to the French cryptographer Vigenere, although to do him justice, he 
made no claim of having “invented” it), direct standard alphabets were used, but it is obvious 
that reversed standard alphabets may be used and the solution accomplished in the same 
manner. 
In fact, the now obsolete cipher disk used by the United States Army for a number 
of years yields exactly this type of cipher, which is also known in the literature as the Beaufort 
Cipher, and by other names. In fitting the isolated frequency distributions to the normal, the 
direction of “reading” the crests and troughs is merely reversed. 
14. Solution by completing the plain-component sequence.--a. There is another method 
of solving this type of cipher, which is worthwhile explaining, because the underlying principles 
will be found useful in many cases. It is a modification of the method of solution by completing 
the plain-component sequence, already explained in Military 
Cryptandy&, 
Part I. 
b. After all, the individual alphabets of a cipher such as the one just solved are merely 
direct standard alphabets. It has been seen that monoalphabetic ciphers in which standard 
cipher alphabets are employed may be solved almcst mechanically by completing the plain- 
component sequence. The plain text reappears on only one generatrix and this generatrix is the 
same for the whole message. It is easy to pick this generatrix out of all the other generatrices 
because it is the only one which yields intelligible text. Is it not apparent that if the same process 
is applied to the cipher letters of the in&&!~ 
alpha& 
of the cipher just solved that the plain- 
text equivalents of these letters must all reappear on one and the same generatrix? But how 
will the generatrix which actually contains the plain-text letters be distinguishable from the 
other genera&ices, since these plain-text letters are n&t consecutive letters in the plain text but 
only letters separated from one another by a constant interval? The answer is simple. The plain- 
text generatrix should be distinguishable from the others because it wiu show mwe and a better 
assortmant of high-jrequency letters, and can thw be seWed by the eye from tb whde set of genera- 
t&es. 
If this is done with all the alphabets in the cryptogram, it will merely be necessary to 
assemble the letters of the thus selected gene&rices in proper order, and the result sould be 
consecutive letters forming intelligible text. 
c. An example will serve to make the process clear. Let the same messagc be used as before. 
Factoring showed that it involves five alphabets. Let the fhst ten cipher letters in each alphabet 
be set down in a horizontal line and let the normal alphabet sequences be completed, Thus:

e. Solution by this method can thus be achieved without the compilation of any frequency 
tables whatever and is very quickly attained. 
The inexperienced cryptanalyst may have difll- 
culty at first in selecting the gene&rices which contain the most and the best assortment of 
high-frequency letters, but with increased practice, R high degree of proficiency is attained. 
After all it is only R matter of experiment, trial, and error to select and assemble the proper 
generatrices so as to produce intelligible text. 
j. If the letters on the sliding strips were accompanied by numbers representing their relative 
frequencies in plain text, and these numbers were added ~47088 each generatrix, then that gen- 
eratrix with the highest total frequency would theoretical& always be the plain-text genera&ix. 
Practically it will be among the generatrices which show the first three or four greatest totals. 
Thus, an entirely mathematical solution for this type of cipher may be applied. 
g. If the cipher alphabets are reversed standard alphabets, it is only necessary to convert 
the cipher letters of each isolated alphabet into their normal, plain-component equivalents and 
then proceed as in the case of direct standard alphabets.. 
h. It has been seen how the key word may be discovered in this type of cryptogram. 
Ususlly 
the key is made up of those letters in the successive alphabets whose equivalents are A, but other 
conventions are of course possible. Sometimes R key number is used, such as 847-1-12, 
which means merely that A, is represented by the eighth letter from A (in the normal alphabet) 
in the first cipher alphabet, by the fourth letter from A in the second cipher alphabet, and so on. 
This modification is known in the literature as the Gronsfeld cipher. 
However, the method of 
solution as illustrated above, being independent of the nature of the key, is the same as before. 
15. Solution by the “probable-word 
method.“- 
a. The common use of key words in cryp- 
tograms such as the foregoing makes possible a method of solution that is simple and can be used 
where the more detailed method of analysis using frequency distributions or by completing the 
plain-component sequence is of no avail. In the case of a very short message which may show 
no recurrences and give no indications as to the number of alphabets involved, this modified 
method will be found most useful. 
b. Briefly, the method consists in assuming the presence of R probable word in the message, 
and referring to the alphabets to fmd the key letters applicable when this hypothetical word is 
assumed to be present in various positions in the cipher text. 
If the assumed word happens to 
be correct, and is placed in the correct position in the message, the key letters produced by 
referring to the alphabets will yield the key word. 
In the following example it is assumed that 
reversed standard alphabets are known to be used by the enemy.

c. Extraneous circumstances lead to the sssumption of the presence of the word AMMU- 
NITION. 
One may assume that this word begins the message. Using sliding normal compo- 
nents, one reversed, the other direct, the key letters are ascertained by noting what the successive 
equivalents of AI, are. Thus:

The key does not spell any intelligible word. 
One therefore shifts the assumed word one letter 
forward and another trial is made.

This also yields no intelligible key word. 
One continues to shift the assumed word forward 
one space at R time until the following point is reached. 
Cipher--,--,,

AMMUNITION 
“Key” -_______ 
LCORPSSIGN 
The key now becomes evident. 
It is a cyclic permutation of SIGNAL CORPS. It should be 
clear that since the key word or key phrase repeats itself during the encipherment of such a 
message, the plain-text word upon whose assumed presence in the message this test is being 
based may begin to be enciphered at any point in the key, and continue over into its next repeti- 
tion if it is longer than the key. 
VVhen this is the csae it is merely necessary to shift the latter 
part of the sequence of key letters to the fimt part, as in the case noted: LCORPSSIGN is trans- 
posed into SIGN . . . LCORPS, and thus SIGNAL CORPS. 
d. It will be seen in the foregoing method of solution that the length of the key is of no 
particular interest or consequence in the stepa taken in effecting the solution. 
The determina- 
tion of the length and elements of the key comes after the solution rather than before it. 
In this 
case the length of the period is seen to be eleven, corresponding to the length of the key (SIGNAL 
CORPS). 
c. The foregoing method is one of the other methods of determining the length of the key 
(besides factoring), referred to in Par. 10~. 
f. If the assumption of reversed standard alphabets yields no good results, then direct 
standard alphabets are assumed and the test made exactly in the same manner. 
As will be 
shown subsequently, the method can also be used .as a last resort when mixed alphabets are 
employed. 
g. When the assumed word is longer than the key, the sequence of recovered key letters will 
show a periodicity equal to the length of the key; that is, after R certain number of letters the 
sequence of key letters will repeat. This phenomenon would be most useful in the case of keys 
that are not intelligible words but are composed of random letters or figures. Of course, if such 
R key is longer than the assumed word, this method is of no avail. 
h. This method of solution by searching for a word is contingent upon the following cir- 
cumstances: 
(1) That the word whose presence is assumed actually occurs in the message, is properly 
spelled, and correctly enciphered. 
(2) That the sliding components (or equivalent cipher disks or squares) employed in the 
search for the assumed word are a&rally the ones which were employed in the encipherment, 
or are such as to give identical resulta as the ones which were actually used. 
(3) That the pair of enciphering equations used in the test is actually the pair which was 
employed in the encipherment; or if a cipher square is used in the test, the method of tiding 
equivalents givea results that correspond with those actually obtained in the encipherment.

i. The foregoing appears to be quite an array of contingencies and the student may think 
that on this account the method will often fail. But examining these contingencies one by one, 
it will be seen that successful application of the method may not be at all rare-after 
the solution 
of some messages has disclosed what sort of paraphernalia and methods of employing them nre 
favored by the enemy. From the foregoing remark it is to be inferred that the probable-word 
method has its greatest usefulness not in an initial solution of a system, but only after successful 
study of enemy communications by more diEcult processes of analysis has told its story to the 
alert cryptanalyst. 
Although it is commonly attributed to Bazeries, the French cryptanalyst 
of 1900, the probable-word method is very old in cryptanalysis and goes back several centuries. 
Its usefulness in practical work may best be indicated by quoting from a competent observer 1: 
There ia another [method] which is to thic first method what the geometric method ie to analysie in ckrtain 
ecienceu, 8nd, Recording to the whims of individuala, 
certain cryptsnalyets 
prefer one tc the other. 
Certain others, 
inc8psble of getting the 8nawer with one of the method8 in the solution of a difficult problem, conquer it by meana 
of the other, with 8 disconcerting 
masterly 
stroke. 
This other method is that of the probable 
word. 
We msy 
have more or leas definite opinions concerning the subject of the cryptogmm. 
We may know something about its 
date, and the correspondents, 
who may have been indiscreet 
in the subject they have treated. 
On this basis, the 
hypothesis 
la made that a certain word probably 
appeara in the text. 
. . . 
In certain clasaea of documents, 
militrrry 
or diplomcrtic 
telegmme., bsnklng 
8nd mining 
tiaim, 
etc., it is not impossible 
to make very huportant 
aaaumptiona 
about the presence of certain worda in the text. 
After a cryptanalyst 
hse worked for a long time 
with the writinge 
of certain correspondentc, 
he gete ueed to their expressions. 
He gets a whole load of worda 
to try out; then the changes of key, and eometlmw 
of aystem, no longer throw into hia way the difficulties 
of an 
absolutely 
new study, which might require the snslytical 
method. 
To which I am prompted to add the amusing definition of cryptanalysis attributed to a 
British wag: “All cryptanalysis is divided into two parts: trance-titution 
and supposition.”

16. Beason for the use of mixed alphabets.-o. 
It has been seen in the examples oonsidered 
thus far that the use of several alphabets in the same message does not greatly complicate the 
analysis of such a cryptogram. 
There are three reasons why this is so. Fitly, 
only relatively 
few alphabets were employed; secondly, these alphabets were employed in a periodic or repeating 
manner, giving rise to cyclic phenomena in the cryptogram, by means of which the number of 
alphabets could be determined; and, thirdly, the cipher alphabets were know, alphabets, by * 
which is meant merely that the sequences of letters in both components of the cipher alphabets 
were known sequences. 
b. In the case of monoalphabetic ciphers it was found that the use of a mixed alphabet 
delayed the solution to a considerable degree, and it will now be seen that the use of mixed alpha- 
bets in polyalphabetic ciphers renders the analysis much more difhcult than the use of standard 
alphabets, but the solution is still fairly easy to achieve. 
17. Interrelated mixed alphabet&--a. 
It was stated in Par. 5 that the method of producing 
the mixed alphabets in a polyalphabetic cipher often affords clues which are of great assistance 
in the analysis of the cipher alphabets. 
This is so, of course, only when the cipher alphabets 
are interrelated secondary alphabets produced by sliding components or their equivalents. 
Reference is now made to the classification set forth in Par. 6, in connection with the types of 
alphabets which may be employed in polyalphabetio substitution. 
It will be seen that thus far 
only Cases A (1) and (2) have been treated. 
Csse B (1) will now be discuseed. 
b. Here one of the components, the plain component, is the normal sequence, while the 
cipher component is a mixed sequence, the various juxtapositions of the two components yielding 
mixed alphabets. 
The mixed component may be a systematically-mbred or a’ random-mixed 
sequence. If the 25 successive displacements of the mixed component are recorded in separate 
lines, a symmetrical cipher square such sa that shown in Fii. 5 results therefrom. 
It is identical 
in form with the square table shown on p. 7, labeled Table I-A..

18. Principles of direat synuw~try of poeition.-a. 
It was stated directly above that Fig.5 
is a symmetrical cipher square, by which is meant that the letters in its successive horizontal 
lines show a symm&y of posit&m with respect to one another. 
They constitute, in reality, one 
and only one sequence or series of letters, the sequences being merely displaced successively 1, 
2, 3, . . . intervals. 
The symmetry exhibited is obvious and is said to be visible, or ditch. 
This fact can be used to good advantage, as has already been alluded to in par. 7j. 
b. Consider, for example, the pair of letters G, and V,, in cipher alphabet (1) of Fii* 6b. The 
letter V, is the 15th letter to the right of G,. In cipher alphabet (2), V,, is also the 15th letter to 
the right of Gd, as is the case in each of the four cipher alphabets in l?ii. 6b, since the r&z&~ 
positions they occupy are the same in each horizontal line in Fig. 6a, that is, in each of the suc- 
cessive recordings of the cipher component as the latter is slid to the right against the plain or 
normal component. 
If, therefore, the relative positions occupied by two letters, 8, and 9,, in 
such a cipher alphabet, Cl, are known, and if the position of e1 in another cipher alphabet, C,, 
belonging to the same series is known, then’& may at once be placed into its correct position in Ct. 
Suppose, for example, that as the result of an analysis based upon considerations of frequency, 
the following values in four cipher alphabets have been tentatively determined: 
(l) Plain------- 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

c. The cipher components of these four secondary alphabets may, for convenience, be assem- 
bled into a cellular structure, hereinafter called a sc~zulrce recvn&zt&n 
&&ton, 
as shown in 
Fii. 76. Regarding the top line of the reconstruction skeleton in Fii. 7b as being common to aJ.l 
four secondary cipher alphabets listed in Fig. 7a, the successive lines of the reconstruction skeleton 
may now be termed cipher alphabets, and may be referred to by the numbers at the left. 
Plain- -_- -- 
d. The letter G is common to Alphabets 1 and 2. In Alphabet 2 it is noted that N occupies 
the 10th position to the left of G, and the letter P occupies the 5th position to the right of G. 
One may therefore place these letters, N and P, in their proper positions in Alphabet 1, the letter N 
being placed 10 letters before G, and the letter P, 5 letters after G. Thus: 
--------- A B C D E F G H I J K L M N 0 P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
plhlw.-..]-==d++#i 
V N

27 
Thus, the values of two new letters in Alphabet 1, viz, P,=J,, and N,=U, have been automsti- 
tally determined; these values were obtained without any analysis based upon the freqwncy of 
P,andN,. 
Likewise, in Alphabet 2, the letters Y and V may be inserted in these positions: 
AIBCDEFGHI 
JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
““~:~~::~~-i-l-t;;~~~~~~#~~~~~=~=~=~~=~=~=~=~~~=~ 
This gives the new values V,=D, and Y,=Y,, in Alphabet 2. Alphabets 3 and 4 have a common 
letter I, which permits of the placement of Q and Win Alphabet 3, and of B and L in Alphabet 4. 
c. The new values thus found are of course immediately inserted throughout the crypto- 
gram, thus leading to the assumption of further values in the cipher text. 
This process, viz, the 
reconstruction of the primary components, by the application of the principles of direct symmetry 
of position to the cells of the reconstruction skeleton, thus facilitates and hastens solution. 
f. It must be clearly understood that before the principles of direct symmetry of position 
can be applied in c-es such ‘as the foregoing, it is necessary that the plain component be a known 
sequence. Whether it is the normal sequence or not is immaterial, so long as the sequence is 
known. 
Obviously, if the sequence is unknown, symmetry, even if present, cannot be detected 
by the cryptanalyst 
because he has no base upon which tc try out his assumptions for 
symmetry. 
In other words, direct symmetry of position is ma.nifested in the illustrative 
example because the plain component is a known sequence, and not because it is the 
normal alphabet. 
The significance of this point will become apparent later on in connection 
with the problem discussed in Par. 26b. 
19. Initial steps in the solution of a typical example.- a. In the light of the foregoing prin- 
ciples let a typical message now be studied.

The factor 5 is common to ail of these repetitions, and there seems to be every indication that 
five alphabets are involved. 
Smee the meaeage already appean3 in groups uf five lett8r8, it irl 
unnecessary in this case to rewrite it in groups corresponding to the length of the key. 
The 
unilitaral frequency distribution for Alphabet 1 is aa follows: 
. 
Rawma 
c. Attempts to fit this distribution to the normal on the basis of a direct or reversed standard 
alphabet do not give positive results, and it is assumed that mixed alphabeta are involved. 
Individual triliteral frequency distributions are then compiled and are shown in Fii. 9. These 
tables are similar to those made for single mixed alphabet ciphera, and am mrrde in the same 
way except that instead of taking the let- 
one after the other, the lettim which belong to the 
separate alphabets now must be assembled in separate tablee. For example, in Alphabet 1, 
the trigraph QAC means that A occura in Alphabet 1; Q, its prefix, occurs in AIphabet 5, and C, its 
s&ix, occurs in Alphabet 2. All confusion may be avoifv, by placing numbers indicating the 
alphabets in which they belong above the letters, thus: QAC *

d. One now proceeds to analyxe each alphabet distribution, in an endeavor to establish 
identifloations of cipher equivalents. 
Wirst, of course, attempts should be made to separate 
the vowels from the consonants in each alphabet, using the same test ss in the case of a single 
mixed-alphabet cipher. 
There seems to-be-no doubt about the equivalent of E,, in each alphabet: 
E=;.,~~,&*~e,& 
e. The letters of greatest frequency in Alphabet 1 are I, M, Q, V, B, G, L, R, S, and C. I, 
has already been assum ed to be 4. 
If i* and &=&, 
then one should be able to distinguish the 
vowels from the consonants among the lettem At, Q, V, B, G, L, R, S, and C by examining the 
prefixes of i,,, and the suflixes of & 
The preties and suflixes of these letters, as shown by the 
trili~ral 
frequency distributions, are these: 
Preiixes of ia (=& 
Suflix~ of ;. (& 
J. Consider now the letter &; it doca not occur either as a prefix of i,, or as a suflix of h. 
Hence it is most probably a vowel, ant on account of its high frequency i,t may be sssumed to 
be O,,. On the other hand, note that Q, occurs five times as a prefix of W, aud three times as 
a sufEx6;f i. 
It is’ therefore a consonant, mo;,t probably &, for it would give the digraph 
ER (= QQJ as occurring three times and RE (= QW,) ss occurring five times. 
g. The letter ;. occurs three times ss a prefix of i. and twice as a suflix of i.. 
It is there- 
fore a consonant, and on account of ite frequency, let it be assumed to be TP. The letter 4. 
occurs twice se a prefix of ie but not ss a suflix of i.. 
Ita frequency is only medium, aud it is 
probably a consonant. 
612 
In fact, the twice repeated digraph & 
is once a part of the trigraph 
GBW, and &, the letter of second highest frequency in Alphabet 5, looks excellent for TD. 
b11 
Might 
not the t&graph GBW be THFJ It will be well to keep this possibility in mind. 
h. The letter G. occurs only once as a preti of i. and does not occur as a sufbx of i.. 
It may 
be a vowel, but one can not be sure. The letter i. occurs once as a prefix of ;. and once as a 
sufFix of 4.. It may be considered to be a consonant. R. occurs once as a prefix of ;,, and twice 
6 
as a suflix of Q,, and is certainly a consonant. 
I 
I 
Neither the letter S, nor the letter C, occurs as a 
pdx 
of ;. or as a s&ix of 4.; both would seem to be vowels, but a study of the prefixes and 
autbxes of these letters lends more weight to the assumption that 6, is a vowel than that 4, is a 
vowel. For all the prefixes of C, vis, i, 3; and ;, are in subsequent analysis of Alphabet 6 classi- 
fied as consonants, as are likewise its suflixes, viz, T, C, and B in Alphabet 2. On the other hand, 
only one prefix, L., and one suflix, &, of k, are later classitled as consonauts. since vowels are

The next step is to try 
to determine a few values in each alphabet. In Alphabet I, from ,tie foregoing analysis, the

b. It is - 
that by good fortune the letter Q is common to Alphabets 1 and 5, and the 
letter C is common to Alphabets 1 and 4. If it is assumed that one is dealing with a case in which 
a mixed component is sliding against the normal component, one can apply the principles of 
diwmt qznmetxy of poeition to tbeuw alphabeti, as outlined in Par. 18. For example, one may 
insert the following values in Alphabet 5:

c. The proceee at once givea three definite valuea: i,=B,,, t.-G,,, 
&+. 
Let them Deb- 
duced values be substantiated by referring to the frequency distribution. 
Since B and G are 
normally low or medium frequency lettem in plain tent, one should find that & and V, their 
hypothetical equivalents in Alphabet 5, should have low frequencies. Aa a matter of fact, they 
do not appear in this alphabet, which thus far corroborates the aaaumption. On the other hand, 
since t.=&, 
if the values derived from symmetry of position are correct, i. should be of high 
frequency, and reference to the distribution shows that I, ie of high frequency. 
The position of 
C is doubtful; it belongs either under ND or V, 
Iftheformeril3coRect,thenthefrequency 
of i. should be high, for it would equal N,; if the latter is correct, then ite frequency should be 
low, for it would equal V,. As a matter of fact, & doer, not occur, and it must be concluded 
that it belongs under V,,. This in turn s&t&a the value of d., for it must now be placed definitely 
under I,, and removed from beneath 4. 
d. The definite placement of C now permits the insertion of new valueo m Alphabet 4, and 
one now hse the following: 
I5 ----------I 
PI I Pi PI I I I. I I I I I I III I I ICI I I I I 
11, Subsequent rtepr in rolndon.-o. 
It ia high time that the thus far deduced values, aa 
recorded in the reconstruotion skeleton, be inwrted in the tipher text, for by tbia time it mu&+em 
that the analysis baa certainly gone too far upon unproved hypotheses. The following resulti 
are obtained:

d. Note also (in F5) the polygraph : G g P W KM, which looks like the word ATTACK. The 
frequency distributions are consulted to see whether the frequenoies given for 6. and $. are high 
enough for TD and A,, respectively, and also whether the frequency of i. is good enough for C,; 
it is noted that they me excellent. Moreover, the digraph &, 
which occurs four times, looks 
like TH, thus making B.=H,. 
Does the insertion of these four new values in our diagram of 
alphabets bring forth any inconsisten&s? 
The insertion of the value bo=AD and &&, 
givee 
no indications either way, since neither letter has yet been located in any of the other alphabets. 
The insertion of the value &=T, 
gives a value common to Alphabets 3 and 5, for the value 
&,=E, was assumed long ago. Unfortunately 
an inconsistency is found here. The letter I 
has been placed two letters to the left of G in the mixed component, and has given good results 
in Alphabeta 1 and 5; if the value i o=CD (obtained above from the assumption of the word 
ATTACK) is correct, then W, and not I, should be the second letter to the left of G. Which shall 
be retained? 
There has been so far nothing to establish the value of &,=ED; this value w&s 
assumed from frequency considerations solely. Perhaps it is wrong. 
It certainly behaves like 
a vowel, and one may see what happens when one changes its value to 0,. 
The following 
placements in the reconstruction skeleton result from the analysis, when only two or three new 
valueshave been added as a result of the clues aflorded by the deductions:

c. The preceding case is a good example of the value of the principles of direct symmetry 
of position when applied properly to a cryptogram enciphered by the sliding of a mixed com- 
ponent against the normal. 
The cryptsnalyst starts off with only a very limited number of 
assumptions and builds up many new values se a result of the placement of the few original 
values in the reconstruction skeleton. 
23. Solution. of subsequent messages enciphered by the same cipher oomponent-e. 
Preliminary 
remarka .--Let it be supposed that the correspondents are using the same basic or 
primary component but with di8erent key words for other messages. Can the knowledge of 
the sequence of lettem in the reconstruoted primary component be used to solve the subsequent 
messages? It has been shown that in the csae of a monoalphabetic cipher in which a mixed 
alphabet was used, the process of completing the plain component could be applied to solve 
subsequent messagee in which the same cipher component wae used, even though the cipher 
component was set at a different key letter. 
A modification of the procedure used in that case 
can be used in this caee, where a plurality of cipher alphabets based upon a sliding primary 
component is used.

e. EJzaminution and diction 
of g-.-It 
haa been shown that in the case of a mono- 
alphabetic cipher it was merely necessary to complete the normal alphabet sequence beneath 
the plain-component equivalenta and the plain text all reappeared on one genera&ix. 
It wae 
also found that in the cue of a multiple-alphabet cipher involving standard alphabets, the plain- 
text equivalenta of each alphabet reappeared on the same generatrix, and it was neceaaarg only 
to combine the proper ganeratrice!a in order to produce the plain text of the mm. 
In the 
caee at hand both proceasets are combined: the normal alphabet sequence is continued beneath 
the lettem of eaoh column and then the generatricem are combined to produce the plain text. 
The completaly developed generatrix d&rama 
for the fin& two c&mna are as follows (Fig. 16):

Combining 
the 
selectd 
generWice8.--After 
some experi- 
menting with these generatrices the 23d generatrix of Column 1 and 
the 1st of Column 2, which yield the digraphs shown in Fig. 17a, 
are combined. The genera&ices of the subsequent columns are 
examined to select those which may be added to these already 
selected in order to build up the plain text. The results are shown 
in Fig. 176. This process is a very valuable aid in the solution of 
messsges after the primary component has been recovered as a 
result of the longer and more detailed analysis of the frequency 
distributions of the first message intercepted. 
Very often a short 
message can be solved in no other way than the one shown, 
if the primary component is completely known. 
g. Recovery of the key.-It 
may be of interest to find the key 
word for the message. Assuming that enciphering method num- 
ber 1 (see Par. 7j, page 6) were known to be employed, all that 
is necessary is to set the mixed component of the cipher alphabet 
underneath the plain component so as to produce the cipher letter 
indicated as the equivalent of any given plain-text letter in each 
of the alphabets. For example, in the fix& alphabet it is noted that 
CD-S,. 
Adjust the two components under each other so as to 
bring S of the cipher component beneath C of the plain component,

!J4. Summation of relath 
fkeqnenoier a8 an aid to the seleadon of the oorreot generatrioe8.- 
a. In the foregoing example, under subparagraph f, there oooura this phrasez “After 
some 
experimenting with thesegeneratrioee . . .” 
By this was meant, of comw, that the selection of 
the correot initial pair of generatriees of plairktext equivalents is in this pess 
a matter of trial 
and error. 
The test of “correotness~’ is whether, when juxtaposed, the two generatrioes so 
selected yield “good” digraphs, that is, high-frequenoy digraphs such as ooour in normal plain 
text. In bin early efforta the etude& may have tmme di&ulty in sebting, memly by ocular 
examination, the moat likely generatricee to try. 
There may be in eaoh diagram several gen- 
eratrices whioh contain good assortments of high-frequenoy letters, and the number of trials of 
combinations of gene&rices may be quite large. Perhaps a simple mathematical method may 
be of assistanoe in the prooess. 
b. Suppoem, in Fig. 16, that each letter were accompanied by a number which corresponds 
to its relative frequenoy in normal English telegraphic text. 
Then, by adding the numbem along 
each AU&H& 
line, the totals thus obtained will serve sa relative numerical messures of the 
frequency valut38 of the respective generatricew5. TheJoretically, the generatrix with the greatest 
value will be the correct generatrix because its total will represent the sum of the individual 
valu88 of the actual plaintext letters. 
In actual practice, of course, the generatrix w%h the 
greatit 
value may not be the correot one, but the correct one will certainly be among the three 
or four generatrices with the large& values. Thus, the number of trkls may be greatly reduced, 
in the attempt to put together the correct generatrices. 
c. Using the preceding messege as an example, note the respeotive generatrk values in Fig. 
18. The frequency values of the respective letters shown in the 6gure are based upon the normal 
distribution

d. It will be noted that the frequency value of the 23d generatrix for the first column of 
cipher letters is the greatest; that of the firat generatrix for the second column is the greatest. 
In both cases these are the correct generatrices. Thus the selection of the correct generatxices 
in such csaes has been reduced to a purely mathematical basis which is at times of much assistance 
in effecting a quick solution. 
Moreover, an understanding of the principles involved will be of 
considerable value in subsequent work. 
25. Solution by the probable-word method.-u. 
Occasionally one may encounter a crypto- 
gram which is so short that it contains no recurrences even of digraphs, and thus gives no indi- 
cations of the number of alphabets involved. 
If the sliding mixed component is known, one may 
apply the method illustrated in Par. 15, assuming the presence of a probable word, checking it 
against the te.xt and the sliding components to establish a key, if the correspondents are using 
key words. 
b. For example, suppose that the presence of the word ENEMY is assumed in the message 
in Par. 23b above. One proceeds to check it against an unknown key word, sliding the already 
reconstructed mixed component against the normal and starting with the first letter of the 
cryptogram, in this manner: 
When ENEMY equals 
SF’DZR then AD successively equals 
XENFW 
The sequence 2UDJFW spells no intelligible word. 
Therefore, the location of the assumed word 
ENEMY is shifted one letter forward in the cipher text, and the test is made again, just ss was 
explained in Par. 15. When the group AQRLU is tried, the key letters ZIMUT are obtained, 
which, taken as a part of a word, suggests the word AZIMUTH. The method must yield solution 
when the correct assumptions sre made. 
c. The danger to cryptographic security resulting from the inclusion of cryptographed 
addresses and signatures in cryptographic messages becomes quite obvious in the light of 
solution by the probable-word method. 
To illustrate, reference is made fo the message employed 
in Pars. 19-22. 
It will be noted in Par. 22b that the message carried a signature (Treer, Col.) 
and that the latter was enciphered. 
Suppose that this were an authorized practice, and that 
every message could be assumed to conclude with a cryptographed signature. 
The signature 
“TREER COL” would at once afford a very good basis for the quick solution of subsequent mes- 
sages emanating from the same headquarters as did the 6rst message, because presumably this 
same signature would appear in other messages. It is for tbis reason that addresses and signa- 
tures must not be cryptographed; if they must be included they should be cryptographed in a 
totally different system or by a wholly different method, perhaps by means of a speoial address 
and signature code. It would be best, however, to omit all addresses and signatures, and to 
let the call signs of the headquarters concerned also konvey these parts of the message, leaving 
the delivery to the addressee a matter for local action. 
26. Solution when the plain component is a mixed sequence, the cipher component, the 
normal .-a. 
This falls under Case B (2) outlined in Par. 6. It is not the usual method of 
employing a single mixed component, but may be encountered occasionally in cipher devices. 
b. The preliminary steps, as regards factoring to determine the length of the period, are 
the same as usual. The message is then transcribed into its periods. Frequency distributions 
sre then made, as usual, and these are attacked by the principles of frequency and recurrence. 
An attempt is made to apply the principles of direct symmetry of position, but this attempt 
will be futile, for the reason that the plain component is in this case an WA- 
mixed sequence.

e. Since the cipher component in this case is the normal alphabet, it fo~%ws that the $ve 
frequmcy di&-ibutions 
are based upon a sequence which i.a known, and therefore, the jive. frequency 
distributions 
&ndd manifeest a direct symmetry of distribution 
of crest8 and trough& By virtue of 
this symmetry and by shifting the five distributions relative to one another to proper superim- 
positions, the several distributions may be combined into a single uniliteral distribution. 
Note 
how this sbifting has been done in the case of the five illustrative distributions:

f. The aupwimposition 
of the respective distribution 
enabk 
one to conve& the cipher 
lettam of the five alphabets into one alphabet. 
Suppose it is decided to convert Alphabeta 
2,3,4, and 5 into Alphabet 1. It is merely neceasq 
to substitute for the respective lettam in 
the four alphabets those which stand above them in Alphabet 1. For example, in Fig. 19b, X. 
in Alphabet 2 is directly under A, in Alphabet 1; hence, if the superimposition is correct then 
&;L$ 
Therefore, in the crypta- 
it is merely necessary to replace every X, in the second 
position by A,. Agaiu T, in Alphabet 3=A, iu Alphabet 1; therefore, in the cryptogram one 
replaces every T, in the third position by A,,. The entire process, hereinafter designated aa

g. The problem having been reduced to monoalphabetic terms, a triliteral frequency distri- 
bution can now be made and solution readily attained by simple principles. 
It yields the 
following: 
JAPAN CONSULTED 
GERMiNY TODAY ON REPORTS 
THAT THE COMMUNIST 
INTERNATIONAL 
WAS BEHIND THE AMAZING SEIZURE OF GENERALJSSIMO 
CHIANG KAI SHEK IN CHINA. 
TOKYO ACTED UNDER THE ANTICOMMUNIST

MANY. THE PRESS SAID THERE WAS INDISPUTABLE'PROOF 
THAT THE COMINTERN

COMMUNIST 
LEADERS HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FIGHTING. SUCH AN ALLIANCE THESE 
OBSERVERS 
DECLARED OPENED UP A RED ROUTE FROM MOSCOW 
TO NORTH AND CENTRAL 
CHINA. 
h. The reconstruction of the plain component is now a very simple matter. 
It is found to 
be as follows: 
HYDRAULICBEFGJKMNOPQSTVWXZ 
Note also, in Fig. 19b, the keyword for the message, (HEAVY), the letters being in the columns 
headed by the letter H. 
i. The solution of subsequent messages with different keys can now be reached directly, by 
a simple modification of the principles explained in Par. 18. This modification consists in using 
for the completion sequence the m&ed plain component (now known) instead of the normal alpha- 
bet, after the cipher letters have been converted into their plain-component equivalents. 
Let 
the student confirm this by experiment. 
j. Tho probable-word method of solution discussed under Paragraph 20 is also applicable 
here, in case of very short cryptograms. 
This method presupposes of course, possession of the 
mixed component and the procedure is essentially the same as that in Par. 20. In the example 
discussed in the present paragraph, the letter A on the plain component was successively set 
against the key letters HEAVY; but this is not the only possible procedure. 
k. The student should go over carefully the principle of “conversion into monoalphabetic 
terms” explained in subparagraphf above until he thoroughly understands it. 
Later on he will 
encounter cases in which this principle is of very great assistance in the cryptanalysis of more 
complex problems. 
(Another example will be found under Par. 45.) 
1. The principle illustrated in subparagraph a, that is, shifting two or more monoalphabetic 
frequency distributions relatively so as lo bring them into proper alignment for amalgamation 
into a single monoalphabetic distribution, is called matching. 
It is a very important crypt- 
analytic principle. 
Note that its practical application consists in sliding one monoalphabetic 
distribution against the other so as to obtain the best coincidence between the entire sequence 
of crests and troughs of one distribution and the entire sequence of crests and troughs of the other 
distribution. 
When the beat point of coincidence has been found, the two sequences may be 
amalgamated and l&ore&u@ 
the single resultant distribution will also be monoalphabetic in 
character. 
The successful application of the principle of matching depends upon several factors. 
First, the cryptographic situation must be such that matching is a correct cryptographic step. 
For example, the distributions in figure 19b are properly subject to matching because the cipher 
component in the basic sequences concerned in this problem is the normal sequence, while the 
plain component is a mixed sequence. But it would be futile to try to match the distributions 
in figure 9, for in that case the cipher component is a mixed sequence, the plain component is 
the normal sequence. Hence, no amount of shifting or matching can bring the distributions of

f&ure 9 into proper superimposition for correct nmnlpnmntion. 
(If the owurren cei4inthemrioua 
distributions in Sgure 9 had been distributed according to the sequence of letten in the mixed 
component, then matching would be possible; but in order to be able to distribute these o- 
rences according to the mixed component, the latter haa to be kruna--rmd 
that is just what is 
mkuown until the problem has been solved.) 
A second factor involved in succe&ul matching 
ie the numb 
of elements in the two distributions 
forming the subject.of the test. 
If both 
of them have very few tallies, there is hardly sufkient information to permit of makhiug with 
any degree of assurau~ that the work is not in vain. 
Ifoneofthemhasmanytallies,theother 
only a few, the chances for su- 
are better than before, because the positions of the MM&I in 
the two distnbutions can be used aa a guide for their proper superimposition. 
m. There are certain mathema&cal and statistical procedures which a 
be brought to bear 
upon the matter of cryptanaIytic matching. 
These will be presented in a later text. 
However, 
until 
the student has studied theee mathematical and statistical methods of matching distri- 
butions, he will have to rely upon mere ocular examination as a guide to proper superimposition. 
Obviously, the more data he has in each distribution, 
the ea&r is the co-t 
supe&nposition 
tucedahed by any method.

27. Further cases to be considered.-+ 
Thus far Cases B (1) and (2), mentioned in Para- 
graph 6 have been treated. 
There remains Case B (3), and this case has been further subdivided 
as follows: 
CASE B (3). Both components are mixed sequences. 
(a) Components are identical mixed sequences. 
(1) Sequences proceed in the same direction 
(The secondary alphabets are mixed 
‘- alphabets.) 
(2) Sequences proceed in opposite directions. 
(The secondary alphabets are 
reciprocal mixed alphabets.) 
(b) Components are different mixed sequences. (The secondary alphabets are mixed 
alphabets.) 
6. The first of the foregoing subcases will now be examined. 
28. Identical primary mixed oomponents proceeding in the same direction-u. 
It is often 
the case that the mixed components are derived from an easily remembered word or phrase, 
so that they can be reproduced at any time from memory. 
Thus, for example, given the key 
word QUESTIONABLY. the following mixed sequence is derived: 
QUESTIONABLYCDFGHJKMPRVWXZ 
15. By using this sequence as both plain and cipher component, that is, by sliding this 
sequence against itself, a series of 26 secondary mixed alphabets may be produced. 
In encipher- 
ing a message, sliding strips may be employed with a key word to designate the particular and 
successive positions in which the strips are to be set, the same as was the case in previous examples 
of the use of sliding components. 
The method of designating the positions, however, requires 
a word or two of comment at tbis point. 
In the examples thus far shown, the key letter, as 
located on the cipher component, was always set opposite A, as located on the plain component; 
possibly an erroneous impression has been created, viz, that this is invariably the rule. 
This 
is decidedly not true, as has already been explained in paragraph 715. If it has seemed to be the 
case that 8t always equals A,, it is only because the text has dealt thus far principally with cases in 
which the plain component is the normal sequence and its initial letter, which usually consti- 
tutes the index for juxtaposing cipher components, is A. 
It must be emphasized, however, 
that various conventions may be adopted iu this respect; but the most common of them is to 
employ the initial letter of the plain component as the index letter. 
That is, the index letter, 
81, will be the initial letter of the mixed sequence, in this case, Q% Furthermore, to prevent the 
possibility of ambiguity it will be stated again that the pair of enciphering equations employed 
in the ensuing discussion will be the first of the 12 set forth under Par. 7f, $2, eJZ=8J1; OJl=O&. 
In this case the subscript “1” 
means the plain component, the subscript “2”, the cipher 
component, so that the enciphering equation is the following: eJo=&/p; 6~,/~=0,J,,.

d. Very frequently a quadricular or square table is employed by the correspondents, instead 
of sliding strips, but the results are the same. The cipher square based upon the word QUESTION- 
ABLY is shown inFig. 21. 
It will be noted that it does nothing more than set forth the successive 
positions of the two primary sliding components; the top line of the square is the plain component, 
the successive horizontal lines below it, the cipher component in its various juxtapositions. 
The 
usual method of employing such a square (i. e., corresponding to the enciphering equations 
%o=%D; 
%/o- -C&J 
is to take as the cipher equivalent of a plain-text letter that letter which 
lies at the intersection of the vertical column headed by the plain-text letter and the horizontal 
row begun by the key letter. 
For example, the cipher equivalent of Ev with keyletter T is the 
letter 0,; or & (Tk)=O,. 
The method given in paragraph 6, for determi&g 
the cipher equive 
lents by means of the two sliding strips yields the same results as does the cipher square.

20. Cryptographing and decryptopaphing by identical primary mixed components.-There 
is nothing of special interest to be noted in connection with the use either of identical mixed 
components or of an equivalent quadricular table such as that shown in Fig. 21, in enciphering or 
deciphering a message. The basic principles are the same as in the case of the sliding of one 
mixed component against the normal, the displacements of the two components being controlled 
by changeable key words of varying lengths. 
The components may be changed at will and so on. 
All this has been demonstrated adequately enough in Elementary Military 
Gyptography, 
and 
Admneed Military 
Cryptography. 
30. Principles of solntion.-e. 
Basically the principles of solution in the case of a crypto- 
gram enciphered by two identical mixed sliding components are the same as in the preceding 
case. Primary recourse is had to the principles of frequency and repetition of single letters, 
digraphs, trigraphs, and polygraphs. 
Once an entering wedge has been forced into the problem, 
the subsequent steps may consist merely in continuing along the same lines as before, building 
up the solution bit by bit. 
b. Doubtless the question has already arisen in the student’s mind as to whether any 
principles of symmetery of position can be used to assist in the solution and in the reconstruction 
of the cipher alphabets in cases of the kind under consideration. 
This phase of the subject will 
be taken up in the next section and will be treated in a somewhat detailed manner, because the 
theory and principles involved are of very wide application in cryptanalytics.

31. Beoonstruction of primary oomponents from seoondary alphabets.-+ 
Note the two 
secondary alphabets (1) and (2) given in paragraph 2%. 
Eixtmdly 
they show no resemblance 
or symmetry despite the fact that they were produced from the same primary componente. 
Nevertheless, when the matter is studied with care, a symmetry of position is discoverable. 
Because it is a hidden or latent phenomenon, it may be termed &ten4 aymm&y of pod&m. 
However, in previous ‘texts the phenomenon hss been designated as a.n &&rect symmetry of position 
and this terminology has grown into usage, so that a change is perhaps now inadvisable. 
Indirect 
symmetry of position is a very interesting and exceedingly useful phenomenon in 
cryptanalytics. 
b. Consider the following secondary alphabet (the one labeled (2) in paragraph 28~):

c. Assuming it to be known that this is a secondary alphabet produced by two primary 
identical mixed components, it is desired to reconstruct the latter. 
Construct a chain of alter- 
nating plain-text and cipher-text equivalents, begin&g 
at any point and continuing until the 
chain has been completed. 
Thus, for example, beghming with b=J,, 
JD==Q,, $=B,, 
a . ., and 
dropping out the letters common to successive pairs, there results the sequence A J Q B . . . . By 
completing the chain the following sequence of letters is established:

e. Since the sequence A J Q B K . . . gives exactly the same equivalents in the secondary 
alphabets as the sequence Q U E S T . . . gives, the former sequence is cryptographically 
equivalent to the latter sequence. For this reason the A J Q B K . . . sequence is termed 
an equivad?ent primary component. 1 If the real or original primary 
component is a key-word mixed 
sequence, it is hidden or latent within the equivalent primary sequence; but it can be made patent 
by decimation of the equivalent primary component. The procedure is as follows: Find three 
letters in the equivalent primary component such as are likely to have formed an unbroken 
sequence in the original primary component, and see if the interval between the first and second 
is the same as that between the second and third. 
Such a case is presented by the letters W, X, 
and Z in the equivalent primary component above. Note the sequence. . . W 0 G X N H Z . . . ; 
the distance or interval between the letters-w, X, and Z is two letters. Continuing the chain by 
adding letters two intervals removed, the latent original primary component is made patent.

f. It is possible to perform the steps given in c and e in a combined single operation when the 
original primary component is a key-word mixed sequence. Starting with any pair of letters (in 
the cipher component of the secondary alphabet) likely to be sequent in the key-word mixed 
sequence, such as JK, in the secondary alphabet labeled (2), the following chain of &graphs may 
be set up. 
Thus, J , K, in the plain component stand over Q, U , respectively, in the cipher com- 
ponent; Q, U, in the plain component stand over B , L, respectively, in the cipher component, and 
so on. Connecting the pairs in a series, the following results are obtained: 
JK + QU + BL + KM + UE + LY+ NP + ES + YC -+ PR + ST + CD + RV + 
TI~DF~VW-,IO-,M:-,WX-,CINjGH-,XZ-,NA-tHJ~ZQ,AB~JK.. 
. 
These may now be united by means of their common letters: 
JK+KM+MP+PR+RV+etc&KMPRVWXZQUESTIONABLYCDFGH 
The original primary component is thus completely reconstructed. 
g. Not all of the 26 secondary alphabets of the series yielded by two sliding primary compo- 
nents may be used to develop a complete equivalent primary component. If examination be made, 
it will be found that only 13 of these secondary alphabets will yield complete equivalent primary 
components when the method of reconstruction shown in subparagraph c above is followed. 
For 
example the following secondary alphabet, which is also derived, from the primary components 
based upon the word QUESTIONABLY will not yield a complete chain of 26 plain text-cipher- 
plain text equivalents:

1 Such an equivalent 
component 
is merely a sequence which haa been or can be developed or derived from 
the original 
sequence or basic primary 
component 
by applying 
a decimation process to the latter; 
conversely, 
the original 
or basic component 
can be derived 
from an equivalent 
component 
by applying 
the same sort of 
proceea to the equivalent 
component. 
By decimation 
ia meant the selection of elementa from a sequenae accord- 
ing to Borne fixed interval. 
For example, 
the sequence A E I Y . . . ia derived, 
by decimation, 
from the 
normal alphabet 
by aelecting every fourth letter.

i. It is now necessary to distribute the letters of each half-sequence within 26 spaces, to 
comapond with their placements in a complete alphabet. 
This can only be done by allowing a 
con&M 
odd number of spaces between the lettem of one of the halfquences. 
Distributions 
are therefore made upon the basis of 3, 5, 7, 9, . . a spaces. Select that distribution 
which 
most nearly coincides with the distribution to be expected in a key-word component. 
Thus, for 
example, with the first half-sequence the distribution selected is the one made by leaving three 
spaces between the letters. 
It is as follows:

j. Now interpolate, by the same constant interval (three in this case), the letters of the other 
half-sequence. 
Noting that the group F - H appears in the foregoing distribution, it is appareut 
that G of the second half-sequence should be inserted between F and H. The letter which immt+ 
diataly follows G in the second half-sequence, oiz, M, is next inserted in the position three spaces to 
the right of G, and so on, until the interpolation has been completed. 
This yields the original 
primary component, which is as follows: .

1. The resson why a complete chain of 26 letters cannot be constructed from the secondary 
alphabet given under subparagraph g is that it represents a case in which two pm 
com- 
ponents of 26 letters were slid an 66~~ number of intervals apart. 
(This will be explained in 
further detail in subparagraph f below.) 
There are in all 12 such cases, none of which will 
admit of the construction of a complete chain of 26 letters. In addition, there is one case whers 
in, despite the fact that the pw 
components are an odd number of intervals apart, the 
secondary alphabet cannot be mada to yield a complete chain of 26 letters for an equivalent 
primary component. 
This is the case in which the displacement is 13 intervals.

The original key-word mixed primary component (based on the word QUESTIONABLY) can 
be recovered from either of the two foregoing equivalent primary components. But if lines 1

Tbis is because 1 and 3 are both odd-interval secondary alphabets, whereas 2 is an even- 
interval secondary. It may be added that odd-interval secondaries are characterized by having 
two cases in which a plain-text letter is enciphered by itself; that is, 0, is identical with 8,. 
This phrase “identical with” will be represented by the symbol =; the phrase “not identical 
with” will be represented by the symbol # . (Note that in secondary alphabet number 1 above, 
F,mF, and UB=Uo; in secondary alphabet number 3 above, MD+ 
and O,=O,). 
This charac- 
teristic will enable the cryptanalyst to select at once the proper two secondaries to work with in 
case several are available; one should show two cases where 8,=0,; 
the other should show 
none. 
p. (1) When the primary components are different mixed sequences, their reconstruction 
from secondary cipher alphabets follows along the same lines as set forth above, under b to j, 
inclusive, with the exception that the selection of letters for building up the chain of equivalents 
for the primary cipher component is restricted to those below the zero line in the reconstruction 
skeleton. 
Having reconstructed the primary cipher component, the plain component can be 
readily reconstructed. 
This will become clear if the student will study the following example.

T B F M X S. This is au equivalent primary of the sequence based upon QDESTIONABLY. 
r. A final word concerning the reconstruction of primary components in gen8ral may be 
added. It has b88n s88n that in the case of a 26&ment 
component sliding against itself (both 
components proceeding in the same direction), it is only the Becondary alphabets msultiug from 
odd-interval displacements of the primary components which permit of reconstructing a single 
%-letter chain of equivalents. 
This is true except for the 13th inkzval displacement, which 
even though an odd number, still acts like an even number displacement in that no complefe 
chain of equivalents can be established from the secondary alphabet. 
This exception giv8s the 
clue to the basic reason for this phenomenon: it is that the number 26 has two factors, 2 and 13, 
which enter into the picture. 
With the exception of displacementGnt8rval 1, any m 
htmal 
which is a sub-mdtipk 
of, or haa a factor in common with the nvmbct of let&a in tlb primary 
seqwncs 
wiJl yield a secondmy alphabet from whkh no compkta chain of 26 quiti 
can bs 
d&&d 
for ths CO1CBtmCtiOl) 
of a compiet~ equkaknt 
p&nary 
componest. 
This g8neral rule is 
applicable only to component8 which progress in the same direction; if they progress in opposite 
directions, all the secondary alphabet8 are reciprocal alphabets and they behave exactly like 
the reciprocal secondaries resulting from the l3-interval displacement of two 26-letter identical 
components progressing in the same dim&on. 
8. The 
foregoing remarks give rise to the following oba8Fpaticms based upon the g8n8ral 
rule poinfed’out above. 
Whether or not a complete equivalent primary compouent is derivable 
by decimation from an original primary component (and if not, the lengths and numbers of chains 
of IetteFe, or incomplete components, that can be constructed in attempts to darive such equiv- 
alent components) will depend upon the number of letters in the original primary component 
and the specifk decimation interval selected. For example, in a 26-letter original p&mu-y com- 
ponent, decimation interval 5 will yield a complete equivalent primary component of 26 lettem, 
whemas decimation intervals 4 or 8 will yield 2 chains of 13 letters each. In a 2kletter compo- 
nent, d8cimation interval 5 will also yield a complete equivalent primary component (of 24 letters), 
but decimation int8rval4 
will yield 6 chains of 4 letters each, and decimation interval 8 will

yield 3 chains of 8 letters each. It also follows that in the c8se of 8$ original prim8ry com- 
ponent in which the total number of characters is a prime number, aL? decimation intervaIs wiil 
yield complete equivalent primary components., The following table has been drawn up in the 
light of these observations, for original primary sequences from 16 to 32 elements. (All prime- 
number sequences have been omitted.) 
In this table, the column at the extreme left gives the 
various decimation intervals, omitting in each case the first interval, which merely gives the 
original primary sequence, and the last interval, which merely gives the original sequence 
reversed. The top line of the table gives the various lengths of original primary sequences from 
32 down to 16. (The student should bear in mind that sequences containing characters in sddi- 
tion to the letters of the alphabet may be encountered; he can add to this table when he is 
interested in sequences of more than 32 characters.) 
The numbers within the table then show, 
for each combination of decimation interval and length of, original sequence, the lengths of the 
chains of characters that csn be constructed. 
(The student may note the symmetry in each 
column.) 
The bottom line shows the total number of complete equivalent primary components 
which c8n be derived for each Werent length of original component.

3% Applying the principlea to a specifto example.-+. 
The preceding section, with the 
many details covered, now forma a su&ient 
base for proceeding with an exposition of how the 
principles of indirect symmetry of position can be applied very early in the solution of a poly- 
alphabetic substitution cipher in which sliding primary components were employed to produce 
the secondary cipher alphabets for the enciphering of the cryptogram. 
b. The -caee described below will serve not only to explain the method of applying these 
principles but will at the same time show how their application greatly facilitates the solution 
of a single, rather Mcult, 
polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It is realized, of course, that the 
cryptogram could be solved by the usual methods of frequency and long, patient experimentation. 
However, the method to be described was actually applied and very materially reduced the 
amount of time and labor that would otherwise have been required for solution. 
33. The aryptogam employed in the exposition.--a. 
The problem that will be used in this 
exposition involves an actual cryptogrclm submitted fox solution in connection with a cipher 
device having two concentric disks upon which the same random mixed alphabet appears, both 
alphabgt$ progreasing in the same direction. 
This was obtained from a study of the descriptive 
circular accompanying the cryptogram. 
By the usual process of factoring, it was determined 
that the cryptogram involved 10 alphabets. 
The message aa arranged according to its period 
is shown in Fiie 
27, in which all repetitions of two or more letters are indicated. 
b. The triliteral frequency distributions are given in Figure 28. It will be seen that on 
account of the brevity of the message, considering the number of alphabets involved, the fre- 
quency distributions 
do not yield many clues. By a very careful study of the repetitions, 
tentative individual determinations of values of cipher letters, aa illustrated in Fiies 
29,30, 
31, and 32, were made. 
These are given in sequence and in detail in order to show that there is 
not&g 
artifmial or arbitrary in the prelimin&ry stages of analysis here set forth.

c. From the initial and subsequent tentative identificationa shown in Figuree 29, 30, 31, 
and 32, the values obtained were arranged in the form of the secondary alphabets in a reconatruc-

34. Fundamental theory.-o. 
In paragraph 31, methods of reconstructing primary com- 
ponents from secondary alphabets were given in detail. 
It is necessary that those methods be 
fully understood before the following steps be studied. 
It was there shown that the primary 
component can be one of a series of equivalent primary sequences, all of which will give exactly 
similar results so far as the secondary alphabets and the cryptographic 
text are concerned. 
It is not necessary that the identical or original primary component employed in the crypto- 
grsphing be reeenstructed; any equivalent primary sequence will serve. The whole question is 
one of establishing a sequence of lettera the interval between which is either identical with that 
in the original pr&ary 
compenent or else is-an exact constant multiple of the interval separating 
the letters in the original primary component. 
For example, suppose K P X N Q forma a 
sequence in the original primary component. 
Here theinterval 
between K and P, and P and X, 
X and N, N and Q is one; in an equivalent primary component, say the sequence K . . P . . X 
. N.. 
Q, the interval between K and P is’ three, that between P and X also three, and so on; 
&d the two sequences will yield the same secondary alphabets. So long aa the interval between 
KandP,PandX,XandN,NandQ, 
. . . , is a constant one, the sequence will be cryptographically 
equivalent to the original primary sequence and will yield the same secondary alphabeta ae do 
those of the original primary sequence. However, in the case of a 264etter component, it ia 
necessary that tbie interval be an odd number other than 13, sa these are the only cases which 
will yield one unbroken sequence of 26 lettem. 
Suppose a secondary alphabet to be ae follows: 
Plda~ARCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
&ipher- 
X 
KN 
P

It can be said that the primary component contains the following sequences: 
XN KP NQ PX 
These, when united by means of their common letters, yield K P X N Q. 
Suppose also the following secondary alphabet is at hand: 
. 
(2) 
---e------m 
{ F!iTer _________ 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
P 
x 
K 
N 
Here the sequences PN, XQ, KX, and NZ can be obtained, which when united yield the two se- 
quences KXQ and PNZ. 
By a comparison of the sequences K P X N Q, K X Q, and P N Z, one can establish the 
following: 
KPXNQ 
K.X.Q 
P.N.Z 
It follows that one can now add the letter Z to the sequence, making it K P X N (1 Z. 
b. The reconstruction of a primary component from one of the secondary alphabets by the 
process given in paragraph 31 requires a complete or nearly complete secondary alphabet. 
This is at hand only afier a cryptogram has been completely solved. But if one could employ 
several very scant or skeletonized secondary alphabets simultaneously with the analysis of the 
cryptogram, one could then possibly build up a primary component from fewer data and thus 
solve the cryptogram much more rapidly than would otherwise be possible. 
c. Suppose only the cipher components of the two secondary alphabets (1) and (2) given 
above be placed into juxtaposition. 
Thus:

(l).....‘........X.KN......P.. 
(2).............P..X......K.N 
The sequences PX, XN, and KP are given by juxtaposition. 
These, when united, yield KPXN 
as part of the primary sequence. It follows, therefore, that one can employ the cipher components 
of secondary alphabets aa sources ojindepcndent data to assist in building up the primary sequences. 
The usefulness of this point will become clearer subsequently. 
36. Application of principles.-a. 
Refer now to the reconstruction skeleton shown in 
Figure 33. Hereafter, in order to avoid all ambiguity and for ease in reference, the position of 
a letter in Figure 33 will be indicated as stated in footnote 1, page 56. Thus, N (6-7) refers to 
the letter N in line 6 and in column 7 of Fiie 
33. 
b. (1) Now, consider the following pairs of letters: 
E (0-5) 
J (3-5) 
G (0-7) 
N (6-7) 
H b-4 
0 (0-15) 
(One is able to use the line marked zero in Figure 33 since this is a mixed sequence sliding against 
iteetf. 
)

(2) The immediate resuh of this set of vahma will now be given. 
Having HOF as a sequence, 
with EJ as belonging to the same dispiacement interva& suppose HOF and EJ are placed into 
juxtaposition as portions of sliding components. 
Thus: 
Main,,, 
. . . H 0 F . . . 
Cipher -- 
. . . E J . . . . 
When b=E,, 
then On=J.. 
(3) Refer now to alphabet 10, Figure 33, where it is seen that K=E,. 
ZVk d+ked tnz.Z~~ 
O,=J,, an immediutdy 
be ilzscrted in the same alphabet and substituted in the cryptogram. 
(4) The student may possibly get a clearer idea of the principIea involved if he will regard 
the matter as though he were dealing with arithmetical proportion. 
For instance, given any 
three terms in the proportion 2~834: 16, the 4th term can easily be found. Furthermore, given 
the pair of values on the left-hand side of the equation, one may find numerous pairs of 
valuee which may be inserted in the right-hand side, or vice versa. For instance, 2 :8=4 : 16 
is the same as 2:8=5:20, 
or 9:36=4:16, 
and so on. An illustration of each of these principles 
will now be given, reference being made to Figure 33. As an example of the first prkiple, 
note 
that E (6-5):H 
(pI-s)=J 
(6-5):O 
(6-8). 
Now find E (10-8):H (0-8)=? 
(19-15):0 
(8-15). 
It is clear that J ~.y 
be inserted aa the 3d term in this proportion, 
thus giving the 
important new value, OD= J,, which is exactly what was obtained directly above, by means of 
the partiai sliding components. 
Ba an example of the second principle, note the following pairs: 
E M-5) 
H (0-8) 
K (2-5) 
Z (24) 
D (5-5) 
C (5-8) 
J (6-6) 
0 (6-8) 
These additional pairs are aiso noted: 
. 
K (l-20) 
Z (l-7) 
T W-20) 
G (0-7) 
Therefore, E:H=K:Z=D:C=J:O=T:G, 
and T may be inserted in position (4-5). 
c. (1) Again, GN belongs to the same set of displacement-interval values as do EJ and HOF. 
Hence, by superimposition: 
Plains,, 
. . .HOF.. 
. 
Cipher _-_ 
. . . G N . . . . 
(2) Referring to alphabet 4, when H D=Go thtn 0 ,, =N, ‘iTherefor% the letterN can be inserted 
in position (4-15) in Figure 33, and the value N,- -0, 
can be substituted in the cryptogram. 
(3) Furthermore, note the corroboration found from this particular superimposition: 
H WI) 
G (0-7) 
0 (6-8) 
N (e-7) 
This checks up the value in alphabet 6, G9=N0. 
(1. (1) Again superimpose HOF and GN: 
. . . HOF... 
. . . . GN.. 
. 
(2) Note this corroboration: 
0 @-@ 
G (Ir-s) 
F (fk15) 
N (e-16) 
which has just been ins&A 
in Figure 33, aa stated above.

e. (1) Again using HOF and EJ, but in a Werent superimposition: 
. . . HOF.. 
. . EJ.. 
. . 
(2) Refer now to H (9-g), J (9-8). 
Directly under these letters is found V (10-g), E (10-8). 
Therefore, the V can be added immediately before H 0 F, making the sequence V H 0 F. 
j. (1) Now take V H 0 F and juxtapose it with E J, thus: 
. . . VHOF.. 
. 
. . . EJ.. 
. 
(2) Refer now to Fire 
33, and find the following: 
v w-9) 
E (10-8) 
H (9-g) 
J N-N 
0 M-9) 
G (44 
1 w-9) 
H M-8) 
(3) From the value 0 G it follows that G can be set next to J in E J. 
Thus: 
. 
. 
l 
VHOF.. 
. 
. . . EJG.. 
. 
(4) But G N already is known to belong to the same set of displacementAnterva1 values 
as E J. 
Therefore, it is now possible to combine E J, J 6, and G N into one sequence, E J G N, 
yielding: 
. . . VHOF.. 
. 
. . . EJGN.. 
. 
g. (1) Refer now to Figure 33. 
V (0-22) 
E (165) 
? (l-22) 
G (l-5) 
? (2-22) 
K (2-5) 
? (3-22) 
X (3-5) 
? (5-22) 
D (5-5) 
? (6-22) 
J (6-5) 
(2) The only values which can be inserted are: 
-0 ‘(l-22) 
G (l-5) 
‘H (6-22) 
J (6-5) 
(3) This means that V,=O, in alphabet 1 and that V,,=H, in alphabet 6. There is one 0, 
in the frequency distribution for alphabet 1, and no H, in that for alphabet 6. 
The frequency 
distribution is, therefore, corroborative insofar as these values are concerned. 
(h) (1) Further, taking E J G N and V H 0 F, superimpose them thus: 
. . . EJGN.. 
. 
. . . . VHOF..

new value, but ooourriug only onoe in the cryptogram. 
Has au error been made? The work 
so far seems too corroborative in interlocking detaila to think so. 
i. (1) The possibilities of the superimposition and sliding of the AVHOF and the KJGNZ 
sequences have by no meaus been exhausted as yet, but a little Merent 
trail this time may 
be advisable.

whereupon the value S can be inserted: 
EJGNZ.. 
. 
‘T:K..S... 
. . . 
k. (1) Consider all the values based upon the dispiacement interval corresponding to JG: 
J (6-5) 
G (l-5)+ J (9- 8) G (4- 8) 
N (6-7) 
Z (l-7) 
H (9- 9) 0 (4- 9) 
S (9-20) 
P (+2O)+S 
(2-14) 
P (5-14) 
Z (2- 8) C (5- 8) 
K (2- 5) D (5- 5) 
(2) Since J*and G are sequent in the E J G N Z sequence, it can be said that ail the letters 
of the foregoing pairs are also sequent. Hence Z C, S P, and K D are available as new data. 
ThesegiveE J G N Z CandT 
. K D . S P. 
(3) Now consider: 
T (9-20) 
P (&20) 
A (0- 1) 
E @- 1) 
H W 8) 
G (4- 8) 
I (0- 9) 
0 (4- 9) 
121466 
Now in the T . K D . S P sequence the interval between T and P is T . . . . . P. 
Hence the interval between A and E is 6 also. It foiiows therefore that the sequences A V H 0 F 
and E J G N Z C should be united, thus: 
128466 
. 
. 
. AVHOF. 
EJGNZC... 
. 
(4) Corroboration is found in the interval between H and G, which is also six. The letter I 
can be placed into position, from the relation I (6-S) 0 (4-g), thus: 
121466 
. 
. 
. I.. 
AVHOF.

E (a- 5) 
K (2- 5) 
N (0-14) 
S (2-14) 
u (a-21) 
F (2-21) 
(2) Since in the I . . A .* H 0 F . E J G N Z C sequence the letters H and Z are separated 
by 8 intervals one can write: 
1224SO76

o. The primary component appears to be a random-mixed sequence; no key word is to be 
found, at least none reappears on experimentation with various hypotheses as to enciphering 
equations. 
Nevertheless, the random construction of the primary component did not compli- 
cate or retard the solution.

p. Some students may prefer to work exclusively with the rewnstr&ion 
skeleton, rathar 
than with &ding strips. 
One method is as good as the other and personal preferencea will dictate 
which will be used by the individual student. 
If the reconstruction skeleton is used, the original 
letters should be inserted in ink, so as to differentiate thee from derived letters.

With 
that 
&dly 
followed 
in 
thing 
the 
pr&- 
lam. It is also to be pointed out that this method can be used ss a control in the early stages 
of analysis because it will allow the cryptanalyst to check assumptions for values. For example, 
the very first value derived in applying the principles of indirect symmetry to the problem 
herein described wsa H,=A, in alphabet 1. As-a matter of. fact the writer had been inclined 
toward this value, from a study of the frequency and combinations which H, showed; when the 
indirec~etry 
method actually substantiated 
his t$&ative 
hypothesis he immediately 
proceeded to substitute the value given. If he had assigned a different value to H,, or if he had 
assumed a letter other than H, for i&, in that alphabet, the conclusion would immediately follow 
that either the assumed value for H, wss erroneous, or that one of the values which led to the 
derivation of H,=A, by indirect symmetry waa wrong. 
Thus, these principles aid not only in 
the systematic and nearly automatic derivation of new values (with only occasional, or incidental 
references to the actual frequencies of letters), but they also assist very materially in serving as 
corroborative checks upon the ?alidity of the assumptions already made. 
b. Furthermore, while the writer has set forth, iu the reconstruction skeleton in Figure 33, 
a set of 30 values apparently obtained before he began to reconstruct the primary component, 
this wss done for purposes of clarity and brevity in exposition of the principles herein described. 
As a matter of fact, what he did was to watch very carefully, when inserting values iu the recon- 
struction skeleton to find the very first chance to employ the principlea of indirect symmetry; 
and just as soon as a value could be derived, he substituted the value in the cryptographic text. 
This is good procedure for two reasons. Not only will it disclose impossible combinations but 
also it gives opportunity for making further assumptions for values by the addition of the derived 
values to those previously assumed. Thus, the processes of reconstructing the primary com- 
ponent and finding additional data for the reconstruction proceed simultaneously in an ever- 
widening circle. 
c. It, is worth noting that the careful analysis of only 30 cipher equivalents in the recon- 
struction skeleton shown in Figure 33 results in the derivation of the entire table of secondary 
alphabets, 676 values in all. And while the elucidation of the method seems long and tedious, in 
its actual application the results are speedy, accurate, and grntifying in their corroborative effect 
upon the mental activity of the cryptanalyst. 
d. (1) The problem here.used M an illustrative case is by no means one that most favorably 
presents the application and the value of the method, for it has been applied iu other cases with 
much speedier success. For example, suppose that in a cryptogrnm of 6 alphabets the equivalents 
of only THE in all 6 alphabets are fairly certain. 
As in the previous csse, it is supposed that the 
secondary al&abets are obtained by sliding a mixed alphabet against itself. Suppose the sec- 
ondary alphabets to be aa follows:

(2) Consider the following chain of derivatives arranged diagrammatically: 
H (o- 8) 0 (5- 8) 
T (0-20) 
P (5-20) 
E (@- 5) X (5- 5)4E (l-20) 
X (2-20) 
Q (I- 8) L (2- 8) 
B (l- 5) C (2- 5)-*B (4~20) C (3-20) 
N (4- 5) I (3- 5) 
P (& 8) V (3- 8)+ 
+P (5-20) 
v (6-20) 
0 (5- 8) z (6- 8) 
X (5- 5) T (6- 5)-*X (2-20) T (8-20) 
L (2- 8) Ii W- 8) 
C (2- 5) E (0- 5)+C (3-20) E (l-20) 
V (3- 8) Q (l- 8) 
I (3- 5) B (l- 5) 
(3) These pairs manifestly all belong to the same displacement interval, and therefore 
unions can be made immediately. 
The complete list is as follows: 
E X, 
Q L, 
N I, 
L H, 
H 0, B C, 
0 Z, C E, 
T P, 
P V, X T, 
V Q, I B 
(4) Joining pairs by their common letters, the following sequence is obtained: 
. . . NIBCEXTPVQLHOZ... 
e. With this as a nucleus the cryptogram can be solved speedily and accurately. 
When 
it is realized’that the cryptanalyst can assume THE's rather readily in some cases, the value of 
this principle becomes apparent. When it is further realized that if a cryptogram has sufficient 
text to enable the THE’s to be found easily, it is usually also not at all d.ifElcult to make correct 
assumptions of values for two or three other high-frequency letters, it is clear that the principles 
of indirect symmetry of position may often be used with gratifyingly quick success to reconstruct 
the complete primary component. 
f. When the probable-word method is combined with the principles of indirect symmetry 
the solution of a difBcult case is often accomplished with astonishing ease and rapidity.

In 
the discussion of the methods of solving repeating-key ciphers using secondary alphabets derived 
from the sliding of a mixed component against the normal component (Section V), it was shown 
how subsequent messages enciphered by the same pair of primary components but with d&rent 
keys could be solved by application of principles involving the completion of the plain-component 
sequence (paragraphs 23, 24). The present paragraph deals with the application of these same 
principles to the case where the primary components are identical mixed sequences.

of a lengthy cryptogram:

38. Solution of repeating-key ciphers 
in which the identical mixed components proceed in 
opposite directions.- The secondary alphabets in this case (paragraph 6, Case B (3) (a) (II) 
are reciprocal. 
The steps in solution are essentially the same as in the preceding case (p= 
graph 28) ; the principles of indirect symmetry of position can also be applied with the necessary 
modifications introduced by virtue of the reciprocity existing within the respective secondary 
alphabets (paragraph 31~). 
39. Solution of repeating-key ciphers in which the primary components are diEerent mixed 
sequences. --This is Case B (3) (b) of paragraph 6. The steps in solution are essentially the same 
as in paragraphs 28 and 31, except that in applying the principles of indirect symmetry of posi- 
tion it is necessary to take cognizance of the fact that the primary components are Werent 
mixed sequences (paragraph 31q).

sequences, the solution of subsequent messa.ges l is a relatively easy matter. 
Xn both cases, how- 
ever, the student must remember that before the method illustrated in paragraph 37 can be 
applied it is necessary to convert the cipher letters into their plaineomponent 
equivalents 
before completing the plain-component sequence. From there on, the process of selecting and 
assembling the proper generatrices is the same as usual. 
b. Perhaps an example may be advisable. Suppose the enemy has been found to be using 
primary components based upon the keyword QUESTIONABLY, the plain component running 
from left to right, the cipher component in the reverse direction.

c. Factoring discloses that the period is 6 and the mes- 
sage is accordingly transcribed into 6 columns, Fii. 42. 
The letters of these columns are then converted into their

mary components at any point of coincidence, for ex- 
ample Q,=Z,. 
The converted letters are shown in Fii. 43. 
The letters of the individual columns are then used as the

41. General remarks .-The 
preceding three sections have been devoted to an elucidation 
of the general principles and procedure in the solution of typical cases of repeating-key ciphers. 
This section will be devoted to a consideration of the variations in cryptanalytic procedure arising 
from special circumstances. 
It may be well to add that by the designation “special circum- 
stances” it is not meant to imply that the latter are necessarily und 
circumstances. 
2’7~ 
&dent should dumys bs on ths alert to s&u upon any opportunities that may appear in which he may 
apply the methods to be &&bed. 
In practical work such opportunities are by no means rare and 
are seldom overlooked by competent cryptanalysts. 
42. Deriving the secondary alphabets, the primary components, and the key, given a 
cryptogram 
with its plain text.-a. 
It may happen that a cryptogram and its equivalent plain 
text are at hand, as the result of capture, pilferage, compromise, etc. 
This, as a general rule, 
affords a very easy attack upon the whole system. 
b. Taking first the case where the plain component is the normal alphabet, the cipher com- 
ponent a mixed sequence, the first thing to do is to write out the cipher text with its letter-for- 
letter decipherment. 
From this, by a slight modification of the principles of “factoring”, 
one dis- 
covers the length of the key. 
It is obvious that when n word of three or four letters is enciphered 
by the same cipher text, the interval between the two occurrences is almost certainly a multiple 
of the length of the key. 
By noting a few recurrences of piain text and cipher letters, one can 
quickly determine the length of the key (assuming of course that the message is long enough to 
afford suflicient data). 
Having determined the length of the key, the message is rewritten accord- 
ing to its periods, with the plain text likewise in periods under the cipher letters. 
From this 
arrangement one can now reconstruct complete or partial secondary alphabets. 
If the secondary 
alphabets are complete, they will show direct symmetry of position; if they are but fragmentary 
in seveml alphabets’ then the primary component can be reconstructed by the application of the 
principles of direct symmetry of position. 
c. If the plain component is a mixed sequence, and the cipher component the normal (direct or 
reversed sequence), the secondary alphabets will show no direct symmetry unless they are ar- 
ranged in the form of deciphering alphabets (that is, & . . . 2, above the zero line, with their 
equivalents below). 
The student should be on the lookout for such cases. 
d. (1) If the plain and cipher primary components are identical mixed sequences proceeding 
in the same direction, the secondary alphabets will show indirect symmetry of position, and they 
can be used for the speedy reconstruction of the primary componenta (Paragraph 31a to 0).

(2) If the plain and the cipher primary componenta are identical mixed sequencea proceeding 
in opposite directions, the secondary alphabets will be completely reciprocal secondary alphabets 
and the primary component may be reconstructed by applying the principles outlined in para- 
graph 31~. 
(3) If the plain and the cipher prnnary components are different mixed sequences, the 
secondary alphabets will show indirect symmetry of position and the primary components may 
be reconstructed by applying the principles outlined in paragraph 31q. 
e. In all the foregoing cases, after the primary components have been reconstructed, the 
keys can be readily recovered. 
43. Deriving the seoondary alphabets, the primary components, and the keywords for 
messages, given two or more cryptograms in different keys and suspected to contain identical 
plain text.-o. 
The simplest case of this kind is that involving two monoalphabetic substitution 
ciphers with mixed alphabets derived from the same pair of sliding components. An understand- 
ing of this case is necessary to that of the case involving repeating-key ciphers. 
b. (1) A message is transmitted from station A to station B. 
B then sends A some operating 
signals which indicate that B cannot decipher the message, and soon thereafter A sends a second 
message, identical in length with the fist. 
This leads to the suspicion that the plain text of both 
messages is the same. The intercepted messages are superimposed. Thus: 
1. NXGRV MPUOF ZQVCP VWERX QDZVX WXZQE TRDSP WXJK RFZWH ZUWLU IYVZQ FXOAR 
2. EMLHJ FGVUR PRJNG JKWHM RAPJM KMPRW ZTAXG JJMCD HRPKY PVKIV QOJPR BMUSH 
(2) Initiating a chain of cipher-text equivalents from message 1 to message 2, the following 
complete sequence is obtained:

(3) Experimentation along already-indicated lines soon discloses the fact that the foregoing 
component is an equivalent primary component of the original primary based upon the keyword 
QUESTIONABLY, decimated on the 21st interval. 
I.& the student decipher the cryptogram. 
(4) The foregoing example is somewhat art&ial 
in that the plain text was consciously 
selected with a view to making it contain every letter of the alphabet. 
The purpose in doing 
this was to permit the construction of a complete chain of equivalents from only two short 
messages, in order to give a simple illustration of the principles involved. If the plain-text message 
does not contain every letter of the alphabet, then only partial chains of equivalents can be con- 
structed. 
These may be united, if circumstances will permit, by recourse to the various prin- 
ciples elucidated in paragraph 31. 
(5) The student should carefully study the foregoing example in order to obtain a thorough 
comprehension of the reaso7c why it was possible to reconstruct the primary component from the 
two cipher messages without having any plain text to begin with at all. Since the plain text of 
both messages is the same, the relative displacement of the primary components in the case of 
message 1 differs from the relative displacement of the same primary components in the case of 
message 2 by ajiazd interval. 
Therefore, the distance between N and E (the first letters of the 
two messages), on the primary component, regardleas of what plain-text letter these two 
cipher letters represent, is the same as the distance between E and W (the 18th letters), W and K 
(the 17th letters), and so on. Thus, this &red interval permits of establishing a complete chain 
of letters separated by constant intervals and thin chain becomes an equivalent primary com- 
ponent.

44. The case of repeating-key systems.-u. 
With the foregoing baaio principles in mind 
the student is ready to note the procedure in the case of two repeating-key ciphers having identical 
plain texts. First, the case in which both messages have keywords of identical length but merent 
compositions will be studied. 
b. (1) Given the following two cryptobgr 
suspected to contain the same plain text: 
YHYEX 
UBUKA 
PVLLT 
ABUVV

(2) The first step is to try to determine the length of the period. 
The usual method of 
factoring cannot be employed because tb.ere are no long repetitions and not enough repetitions 
even of digraphs to give any convincing indications. 
However, a subterfuge will be employed, 
based upon the theory of factoring. 
c. (1) Let the two messages be superimposed.

For example, L and L

are separated by 40 letters, Q, Q, and Q are separated by 12 letters. Let these intervals between 
identical superimpositions be factored, just as though they were ordinary repetitions. 
That 
factor which is the most frequent should correspond with the length of the period for the following 
reason. If the period is the same and the plaiu text is the same in both messages, then the con- 
dition of identity of superimposition can only be the result of identity of encipherments by 
identical cipher alphabets. This is only another way of saying that the same relative position in 
the keying cycle has been resched in both caseu~ of identity. 
Therefore, the distance between 
identical superimpositions must be either equal to or else a multiple of the length of the period. 
Hence, factoring the intervals must yield the length of the period. The complete list of intervals

d. A reconstruction skeleton of “secondary alphabets” is now made by distributing 
the 
letters in respective lines corresponding to the 12 different superimposed pairs of numbers. For 
example, all pairs corresponding to the superimposition of position 1 of Message 1 with position 1 
of Message 2 are distributed in lines 0 and 1 of the skeleton. 
1

Thus, the very 6rst superimposed 
pair is g; the letter Z is inserted in line 1 under the letter V. The next {: pair is the 13th super- 
1 
imposition, with I 
F 
D; the letter D is inserted in line 1 under the letter F, and so on. The skeleton 
is then as follows: 
jj %

f. The subsequent steps in the actual decipherment of the text of either of the two messages 
are of considerable interest. 
Thus far the cryptanalyst has only the cipher component of the 
primary sliding components. 
The plain component may be identical with the cipher com- 
ponent and may progress in the same direction, or in the reverse direction; or, the two com- 
ponents may be di8erent. 
If d&rent, 
the plain component may be the normal sequence, 
direct or reversed. Teats must be made to ascertain which of these various possibilities is true. 
g. (1) It will first be assumed that the primary plain component is the normal direct 
sequence. Applying the procedure outlined in Par. 23 to the message with the shorter key 
(Message No. 1, to give the most data per secondary alphabet), an attempt is made to solve 
the message. It is unnecessary here to go further into detail in this procedure; suEice it to 
indicate that the attempt is unsuccessful and it follows that the plain component is not the 
normal direct sequence. A normal revemed sequence is then assumed for the plain component 
and the proper procedure applied. 
Again the attempt is found useless. Next, it is assumed 
that the plain component is identical with the cipher component, and the procedure outlined in 
Par. 37 is tried. 
This also is unsuccessful. Another attempt, assuming the plain component 
rms in the reverse direction, is likewise unsuccessful. There remains one last hypothesis, viz, 
that the two primary components are difEerent mixed sequences.

Uniliteral

distributions 
for the four secondary alphabets are shown below in Fig. 52, labeled la, 2a, 3a,

sequence of the cipher component, as shown in distributions labeled lb, 2b, 3b, and 4b in Fig. 52.

(5) Having the plain text, the derivation of the plain component (an equivalent) is an easy 
matter. 
It is mernly necessarv to base the reconstruction upon any of the secondary alpha- 
bets, since the plain text-cipher 
relationship is now known directly, and the primary cipher 
component is at hand. 
The primary plain component is found to be as follows:

(7) The etudent may, if he wiahee, try to find out whether the primary components recon- 
structed above axe the original componante or are equivalent componenta, by examin@ all the 
possible decimations of the two components for evidencea of derivation from keywords. 
h. As already stated in Par. 26m, there are certain statistical and mathematical tests that 
can be employed in the process of “matching” 
distributions to ascertain proper superimpositions 
for monoalphabeticity. 
In the case just considered there were%u&ient 
data in the distributions 
to permit the process to be applied successfully by eye, without necessitating statistical tests. 
i. This case is an excellent illustration 
of the application of the process of CO~W+J Q 
polyalphabetic cipti 
into monoalphu&ic terms. Because it is a very valuable and important 
cryptmalytic 
“trick,” 
the student should study it most carefully in order to gain a good under- 
standing of the principle upon which it is based and its significance in cryptanalysis. 
The 
conversion in the case under discussion was possible because the sequence of letters forming the 
cipher component had been reconstructed and was known, and therefore the uniliteral dis- 
tributions for the respective secondary cipher alphabete could theoretically be shifted to correct 
superimpositions for monoalphabeticity. 
It also happened that there were suflicient data in 
the distributions 
to give proper indications 
for their relative 
displacements. 
Therefore, the 
theoretical possibility in this case became an actuality. 
Without these two necessary conditions 
the superimposition and conversion cannot be accomplished. 
The student should always be 
on the lookout for situations in which this is poesible. 
46, Concluding remarka.--o. 
The observant student will have noted that a large part of 
this text is devoted to the elucidation and application of a very few basic principles. 
These 
principles are, however, extremely important and their proper usage in the hands of a skilled 
cryptanalyst makes them practically indispensable tools of his art. 
The student should therefore 
drill himself in the application of these tools by having someone make up problem after problem 
for him to practice upon, until he acquires facility in their use and feels competent to apply 
them in practice whenever the least opportunity presents itself. 
This will save him much time 
and effort in the solution of bona fide messages.

APPENDIX 
2’ 
ELEMENTARY 
STATISTICAL THEOEY APPLICABLE TO TFIE PHENOMENA OB REPETITION 
IN CRYPTANALYSIS 
1. Introductory.-& 
In Par. 9c it was stated that the phenomena of repetition in crypt- 
analytics may be removed from the realm of intuition and dealt with statistically. 
The dis- 
cussion of the matter will here be confined to relatively simple phases of the theory of probability, 
a definition of which implies philosophical questions of no practical interest to the student of 
cryptanalysis. 
Par his purposes, the following definition of a priori probability will be sufficient: 
The probabihty that an event will occur is the ratio of the number of “fav- 
orabie cases” to the number of total possible cases, all cases being equally 
,likeiy to occur. By a “favorable case” is meant one which will produce the 
event in question. 
b. In what follows, reference will be made to rundom assorfments of letters and especially to 
random betiS By the latter will be meant merely that the text under consideration has been as- 
sumed to have been enciphered by some more or less complex cryptographic system so that for 
all practical purposes the sequence of letters constituting this text is a random assortment; that 
is, the sequence is just about what would have been obtained if the letters had been drawn at 
random out of a box containing a large number of the 26 letters of the alphabet, all in equal 
proportions, so that there are exactly the same numbers of A’s, B’s, C’s, . . . Z’s. .It is assumed 
that each time in making a drawing from such a box, the latter is thoroughly shaken so that the 
letters arc thoroughly mixod and then a single letter is selected at random, recorded, and 
replaced in the same box. In what follows, the word “box” will refer to the box as described. 
c. A uniliteral frequency distribution 
of a large volume of random text will be “flat,” 
i. o., lacking crests and troughs. 
d. For purposes of statistical analysis, the text of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is 
equivalent to plain text. As a corollary, when a polyalphnbctic substitution cipher has been 
rcduccd to the simple terms of a set of monoalphabets, i. e., when the letters constituting the 
cipher text have beon allocated into their proper uniliteral distributions, the letters falling into 
tha respective distributions are statistically equivalent to plain text. 
2. Data pertaining to single letters.+. 
(1) A single letter will be drawn at random from 
the box. What is the probability that it will be an A? According to the foregoing definition of 
probability, since the total number of possible cases is 26 and the number of favorable cases is 
here only 1, the probability is 1: 26=&=. 
0385. This is the probability of drawing an A from 
the box. The probability that the lotter drawn will be a B, n C, a D, . . ., a Z is the same as for A. 
In other words, the probability of drawing any specijicd s-ingle letter is p= .03&L 
(2) The.value p-. 0386, MJ found above, may also be termed the probability constant for 
single letters in random text of a 26-letter alphabet. 
For any language this constant is merely 
the reciprocal of the total number of different chnrscters which may be employed in writing the 
text in question. 
1 In the preparation of this appendix, the author hae had the benefit of the very helpful suggestions of 
Capt. H. G. Miller, Signal Corps, Mr. F. B. Rowlett, Dr. 9. Kullback, and Dr. A. Sinkov, Assistant Cryptanalysts, 
0. C. Yig. 0. 
Certain parta of Dr. Kullback’e important paper Y3tatiaticd 
Methods in Cryptanalynie” 
form 
the basis of the discussion.

(3) Another way of interpreting the notation p= .0385 is to say that in a large volume of 
random t,ext, for example in 100,000 letters, any letter that one may choose to specify may be 
expected to occur about 3,850 times; in 10,000 letters it may be expected to occur about 385 
times; in 1,000 letters, about 38.5 times, and so on. In every-day language it would be said 
that “in the long run” or “on the average” in 1,000 letters of random text there will be about 
38.5 occurrences of each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. 
(4) But unfortunately, in cryptanalysis it is not often the case that one has such a large 
number of letters available for study in any single cipher alphabet. 
More often the cryptanalyst 
has a relatively small number of letters and these must be distributed over several cipher 
alphabets. 
Hence it is necessary to be able to deal with smaller numbers of letters. 
Consider 
a specific piece of random text of only 100 letters. 
It has been seen that “in the long run” 
each letter may be expected to occur abuut 3.85 times in this amount of random text; that is, 
the 26 letters will have an average frequency of 3.85. But in reaching this average of 3.83 
occurrences in 100 letters, it is obvious that some letter or letters may not appear at all, some 
may appear once, some twice, and so on. How many will not appear at all; how many will 
appear1,2,3,. 
. . times? In other words, how will the diiferent categories of letters (differ- 
ent in respect to frequency of occurrence) be distributed, or what will the distribution be like? 
Will it follow any kind of law or pattern ? The cryptanalyst also wants to know the answer 
to questions such as these: What is the probability that a specified letter will not appear at 
all in a given piece of text ? That it will appear era&y 1, 2, 3, . . . times? That it will appear 
at least 1, 2, 3, . . . times? The same sort of questions may be asked with respect to digraphs, 
trigraphs, and so on. 
b. (1) It may be stated at onc.e that questions of this nature are not easily answered, and 
a complete discussion falls quite outside the scope of this text. 
However, it will be sufficient 
for the present purposes if the student is provided with a more or less simple and practical mea.ns 
of finding the answers. With this in view certain curves have been prepared from data based 
upon Poisson’s exponential expansion, or the “law of small probabilities” and their use will 
now be explained. 
Students without a knowledge of the mathematical theory of probability 
and statistics will have to take the curves “on faith” 
Those interested in their derivation are 
referred to the following texts: 
Fisher, R. A., Sfatistical Methods for Research IVorkers, London, 1937. 
Fry, T. C., Probability and Its Engineering Uses, New York, 1928. 
(2) By means of these proZ&iZity curues, it is possible to find, in a relatively easy manner, 
the probability for 0, 1, 2, . . . 11 occurrences of an event in n cases, if the mean (expected, 
average, probable) number of occurrences in these n cases is known. 
For example, given a cryp- 
togram equivalent to 100 letters of random text, what is the probability that any specified single 
letter, whatever will not appear at all in the cryptogram? 
Since the probability of the occurrence 
of a specified single letter is 1 
23=. 0385, and there are 100 letters in the cryptogram, the average 
or expected or mean number of occurrences of an A, a B, a C, . . ., is .0385X 100=3.85. 
Refer 
now to that probability curve which is marked ‘fo”, 
meaning 
“frequency 
zero", 
or 
"zero 
occur- 
rences.” 
On the horizontal or x axis of that curve find the point corresponding to the value 
3.85 and follow the vertical coordinate determined by this value up 
t,o 
the 
point 
of 
intersection 
with the curve itself; then follow the horizontal coordinate determined by this intersection p&t 
over to the left and read the value on the vertical axis of the curve. It is approximately .021. 
This means that the probability that a specified single letter (an A, a B, a C, . . .) will not appear 
at all in the cryptogram, if it really were a perfectly random assortment of 100 letters, is .021.

That ia, according to the theory of probability, in 1,000 cases of random-text messages of 100 
letters each, one may expect to End about 21 messages in which a specified single letter will not 
appear at all. 
Another way of saying the same thing is: If 1,000 sets of 100 letters of random 
text are examined, in about 21 out of the 1,000 such sets any letter that one may choose to 
name will be absent. 
This, of course, is merely a theoretical expectancy; it indicates only 
what probably will happen in the long run. 
(3) What is the probability 
that a specified single letter will appear eructly once in 100 
letters of random text? 
To answer this question, End on the curve marked fi, the point of 
intersection of the vertical coordinate corresponding to the mean or average value 3.85 with 
the cunve; follow the horizontal coordinate thus determined over to the vertical scale at the 
left; read the value on this scale. It is .082, which means that in 1,000 cases of random-text 
messages of 190 letters each, one may expect to find about 82 messages in which any letter 
one chooses to specify will occur exactly once, no more and no less. 
(4) In the same way, the probability that a specified single letter will appear ezactly twice 
is found to be .158 ; exactly 3 times, .202 ; and so on, as shown in the table below:

(5) To find the probability that a specified single letter will occur at lea& 1,2,3, 
. . . times 
in a series of letters constituting random text, one reasons as follows: Since the concept “at least 
1” implies that the number specified is to be considered only as the minimum, with no limit 
indicnted as to maximum, occurrences of 2,3,4, . . . are also “favorable” cases; the probnbilities 
for ezu& 1,2,3,4, 
. . . occurrences should therefore be added and this will give the probability 
for “at least 1.” 
Thus, in the case of 100 letters, the sum of the probabilities for exaotly 1 to 11 
oocurrences,’ as set forth in the table directly above, is .978, and the latter value approximates 
the probability for at least 1 occurrence. 
(6) A more aocurate result will be obtained by the following reasoning. The probability 
for zero occurrences is 921. 
Since it is certain that a specified letter will occur either zero times 
or 1, 2, 3, . . . times, to find the probability for af Zeast one time it is merely necessary to sub- 
tract the probability 
for zero occurrences from unity. 
That is, l-.021=.979, 
which is .OOl 
greater than the result obtained by the other method. 
The reason it is greater ia that the value 
.979 includes occurrenct~ beyond 11, which were excluded from the previous calculation. 
Of 
CO~ZBC+ 
the probabilities for these occurrences beyond 11 are very small, but taken all together they

ill 
ndd up to .ool, the difference between the results obtained by the two riMhods. 
The proba- 
bility for at least 2 occurrences is the diflerence between unity and the sum%f the probability 
for zero and exactly 1 occurrences; that is, l-(P,+P,)=l-(.021-l-.082)=1-.1&S---.897.

(7) The foregoing calculations refer to random text composed of 100 letters. 
For other 
numbers of letters, it is merely necessary to find the mean (multiply the probability for drawing 
a specified single letter out of the box, which is & or .0385, by the number of letters in the 
assortment) and refer to the various curves, as before. For example, for a random assortment 
of 200 letters, the mean is 200 X .0385, or 7.7, and this is the value of the point to be sought along 
the horizontal or z axes of the curves; the intersections of the respective vertical lines correspond- 
ing to this mean with the various curves for 0, 1,2,3, 
. . . occurrences give the probabilities for 
these occurrences, the reading being taken on the vertical or y axes of the curves. 
(8) The C’scussion thus far hss dealt with the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . occurrences 
of specified single letters. It may be of more practical advantage to the student if he could be 
shown how to find the answer to these questions: Given a random assortment of 100 letters 
how many letters may b3 expected to occur exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . times? 
How many mny be 
expected to occur at Z-eat 1, 2, 3, . . . times? The curves may here again be used to answer 
these questions, by a very simple calculation: multiply the probability value as obtained above 
for a specified single letter by the number of different elements being considered. For example, 
the probability that a specified single letter will occur exactly twice in a perfectly random assort- 
ment of 100 letters is .158; since the number of dXerent letters is 26, the absolute number of single 
letters that may be expected to occur exactly 2 times in this assortment is .158X26=4.108. 
That is, in 100 lettors of random text there should be about four letters which occur exactly 2 
tiJJlw. 
The! following table gives the data for various numbers of occurrences.

(9) Referring again to the (curves, and speciscally to the tabulated resulta set forth dire& 
above, it will be seen that the probability that there will be exactly two occurrences of a specified 
single letter in 100 letters of random text (.168), is less than the probability that there will be 
exactly three occurrences (.202); in other words, the chances that a specified single letter will 
occur exactly three times are better, by about 25 percent, than that it will occur only two timea. 
Furthermore, 
there will be about five letters which will occur exactly 3 times, and about five 
which will occur exactly 4 times, whereas there will be only about two lettera which will occur 
exactly 1 time. 
Other faots of a similar import may be deduced from the foregoing table. 
c. The discussion thus far has dealt with random assortments of letters. What about other 
types of texts, for example, normal plain text? What is the probability that E will occur 0, 1, 
2, 3, i . . times in 50 lettem of normal English? 
The relative frequency value or probability 
that a letter selected at random from a large volume of normal English text will be E ia .12604. 
(In 100,000 letters E ocourred 12,604 times.) For 50 letters this value must be multiplied by 50, 
giving 6.3 as the mean or point to be found along the z axes of the curves. The probabilities for 
0, 1,2, 3, . . . oocurrences are tabulated below:

d. (1) It has been seen that the probability of occurrence of a specified single letter in random 
. 
text employing a 26-letter alphabet is p-h-. 
0385. If a considerable volume of such text is 
written on a large sheet of paper and a pencil is directed at random toward this text, the probabil- 
ity that the pencil point will hit the letter A, or any other letter whtih may be epecifid in advance, 
is .0386. Now suppose two pencils are directed simultaneously toward the sheet of paper. The 
probability that both pencil points will hit two A’s is AX&=&= 
.00148, since in this case 
one is dealing with the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of two events which are 
independent. 
The probability of hitting two B’s, two C’s, . . ., two Z’s is likewise &a 
Hence, 
if no particular letter is specified, and merely this question is aeked: “What is the probability 
that both pencil points will hit the same letter?” the answer must be the sum of the separate 
probabilities for simultaneously hitting two A’s, two B’s, and so on, for the whole alphabet, 
1

whichis26Xs,=s=. 
0385. This, then, is the probability that any two letters selected at random 
in random text of a 26-letter alphabet will be identical or will coincide. Since this value remains 
the same so long as the number of alphabetic elements remains fixed, it may be said that the 
probability of monographic coincidence in random text of a &T-element alphabet is .0385. The fore- 
going italicised expression ’ is important enough to warrant assigning a special symbol to it, viz, 
K? (read “kappa sub-r”). 
For a 20-clement alphabet, then, xP=.0385. 
(2) Now if one asks:. “Given a random assortment of 10 letters, what are the respective 
probabilities of occurrence of 0, 1, 2, . . . single-letter coincidences?” one proceeds as follows. 
As before, it is first necessary to find the mean or expected number of coincidences and then 
refer to the various probability curves. To find the mean, one reasons as follows. 
Given a 
sequence of 10 letters, one may begin with the 1st letter and compare it with the 2d, 3d, . . . 10th 
letter to see if any two letters coincide; 9 such comparisons may be made, or in other words there 
are, beginning with the 1st letter, 9 opportunities for the occurrence of a coincidence. But 
one may also start with the 2nd letter and compare it with the 3d, 4th . . . 10th letter, thus 
yielding 8 more opportunities for the occurrence of a coincidence, and so on. This process may 
continue until one reaches the 9th letter and compares it with the lOth, yielding but one oppor- 
tunity for the occurrence in question. 
The total number of comparisons that can be made is 
therefore the sum of the series of numbers 9, 8, 7, . . . 1, which is 45 comparisons.* Since in 
the 10 letters there are 46 opportunities for coincidence of single letters, and since the probability 
1 The expreneion i&&f may be termed LL parameter, which in mathematics is often used to designate a constant 
that characteri- 
by each of itr particular values some particular member of a system of values, fun&ions, etc. 
The word ia applicable in the aaee under disouaeion because the value obtained forr, ia .0385; for a 254ement 
alphabet, Iv= B400; for a 2?-element siphabet, x,= .0370, eta.

for monograpbic coincidence in random text is .0385 the expected number of coincidences is 
.0385X45 
= 1.7325. With m= 1.7 one consults the various probability curves and an approxi- 
mate distribution for exactly and for at least 0, 1,2, . . . coincidences mayreadily be awxtaiued.’ 
e. (I) Now consider the matter of monographic coincidence in Engiish plain textes Follow- 
ing the same reasoning outlined in subpar. d (l), the probabilig 
of coincidence of two A’s in plain 
text is the square of the probabiity 
of occurrence of the single letter A in such text. 
The 
probability of coincidence of two B’s is the squsxe of the probability of occurrence of the single 
letter B, and so on. The sum of these squares for all the letters of the alphabet, aa shown in 
the following table, is found to be .0667.

This then is the probability 
that any two. letters selected at. random in a large volume of

(2) Given 10 letters of English plain text, what is the probability 
that there will be 0, 1, 
2 
. . single-letter coincidences? Following the line of reasoning in subparagraph d (2), the 
ekected number of coincidences is .0667X45=3.00, or m=3. 
The distribution for exactly and 
foratleastO,1,2,. 
. . coincidences may readily be found by reference to the various probability 
curves. (See footnote 4.) 
f. The fact that K~ (for English) is almost twice as great as K, is of considerable importance 
in cryp tanalysis. 
It will be dealt with in detail in a subsequent text. 
At this point it will mere- 
ly be said that rc, and I[, for other languages and alphabets have been calculated and show con- 
siderable variation, as will be noted in the table shown in paragraph 3d. 
3. Data pertaining to digraphs.-o. 
(1) The foregoing discussion has been restricted to 
questions concerning single letters, but by slight modification it can be applied to questions 
concerning digraphs, trigraphs, and longer polygraphs. 
(2) In the preceding cases it was necessary, before referring to the, various probability 
curves, to find the mean or expected number of occurrences of the event in question in the 
total number of cases or trials being considered. Given a piece of random text Walling 100 
letters, for example, what is the mean (average, probable, expected) number of occurrences of 
digraphs in this text? 
Since there are 676 different digraphs, the probability of occurrence 
. 
of any specified digraph is 6%-. 00148; since in 100 letters thore are 99 digraphs (if the letters 
are taken consecutively in pairs) the mean or average number of occurrences in this case is 
.00148X99=.147. 
Having the mean number of occurrences of the event under consideration, 
one may now find the answers to these questions: What is the probability that any specified 
digraph, say XY, will not occur? What is the probability 
that it will occur exactly 1, 2, 
3 
’ 
. . times? At least 1,2, 3, . . . times? 
* (3) Again the probability curves may be used as before, for the type of distribution is the 
same. The following values are obtainable by reference to the various curves, using the mean 
value .00148X99=.147.

(4) Thus it is seen that in 100 letters of random text the probability that a specified digraph 
will occur exactly once, for example, is .13; at least once, .14; at least twice, .Ol. The probability 
that a specified digraph will occur at least 3 timesis negligible. 
(By calculation, it is found to 
to be .0005.) 
b. (1) The probability of digraphio coincidence in random text baaed upon a 26-clement 
alphabet is of course quite simply obtained: since there are 262 different digraphs, the probability 
of selecting any specified~digraph in random text is &*

(2) Given a random assortment of 100 letters, what is the probability 
of occurrence of 
0, 1, 2, . . . digrapbic 
coincidences? Following the line of reasoning in paragraph 2d (2), in 
100 letters 
the total number of comparisons that may be made to see if two digraphs coincide 
is 4,851. 
This number is obtained as follows: Consider the 1st and 2d letters in the series of 
100 letters; they may be combined to form a digraph to be compared with the digraphs formed 
by combining .the 2d and 3d, the 3d aud 4th, the 4th and 5th letters, and so on, giving R total of 
98 comparisons. 
Consider the digraph formed by combining the 2d and 3d letters; it may be 
compared with the digraphs formed by combining the 3d and (rth, 4th and 5th letters, and so on0 
giving a total of 97 comparisons. 
This process may be continued down’ to the digraph formed 
by combining the 98th and 99th letters, which 
yields only one comparison, since it may be 
compared only with the digraph resulting from combining the 99th and 100th letters. 
The 
total number of comparisons is the sum of the sequence of numbers 98, .97, 90, 95, . . . 1, which 
is 4,851.6 
(3) Since in the 100 letters there are 4,851 opportunities for the occurrence of a digraphic 
coincidence, and since G*= .OOl48, the expecti 
number of coincidences is .00148X4851= 
7.17948=7.2. 
The various probability curvea may now be referred 
to and the following results 
are obtained:

c. In this tab18 it will be noted that it is almost certain that in 100 letters of random text 
there will be at least one digraphic coincidence, despite the fact that there are 676 possible 
digraphs 
and only 99 of them have appeared in 100 letters. 
When one tbinke of a total of 676 
different digraphs from which the 99 digraphs may be selected it may appear rather incredible 
that the chances are better than even (.582) that one will find at least 7 digraphic coincidences in 
100 letters of random text, yet that is what the statistical analysis of the problem shows to be 
the case. These are, of COW~L, p-u&y accidental repciitti. 
It is important that the student 
should fully realize that more coincidences or accidental repetitions than he feels intuitively 
should occur in random text will actually occur in the cryptograms he will study. 
He must 
therefore be on guard against putting too much reliance upon the surface appearances of the 
phenomena of repetition; he must calculate what may be expected from pure chance, to make 
sure that the number and length of the repetitions he doea see in a cryptogram are really better 
than what may be expected in random text. 
Ih studying cryptograms composed of figures this 
8 The formula for finding the number of comparisons that can be made is as follows, where n = the tot&l number 
of letters in the sequence and f is the length of the polygraph: 
Since the number of polygraphs possible is 
n--t+l, 
the number of comparisons is 
(n-t+11 
(n-t)

how to calculate probability data concerning trigraphs, tetragraphs, and longer polygraphe.

ia .00005689X100=.005689. 
With so small a value, the probability curve8 are hardly usable, 
but at any rate they show that the probability of occurrence of a specif%d trigraph in 80 8f118u 
a volume of text ia 80 small aa to be practically negligible. 
The probability of a specified trigraph

of at least one trigraphic coincidence in 100

Referring to curve jO, with m= .27 the probability of &ding no trigrapbic coincidence i8.76. 
The probability of fkling 
at least one trigraphic coincidence is therefore l--.76=.24. 
C. The calculation for a tetragrapbic coincidence ie as followe: 
Referring to curve jo, with m= .Ol the probability of finding no tetragraphic coincidauce is

Consequently, the probability of flnding at least

This means that in a hundred cases of 100-letter random-text cryptograms, one might expect 
to find but one cryptogram in which a Pletter repetition is brought about purely by chance; it 
is, in common parlance, 8 “hundred to one ehot.“) 
consequently, if a tetragraphic repetition 
is found in a cryptogram of 100 lettera, the’probability 
that it is an accidental repetition is 
extremely sd. 
If not accidental, then it must be causal, and the cause should be aecertained.

The message of Par. 9a of the text proper will be employed. First, let 
the repetitions be sought and underlined; then the repetitions are listed for convenience.,

b. Referring to the table in Par. 3a (3) above, it will be seen that in 100 letters of random 
text one might expect to find about 7 digraphs appearing at least twice and no digraph appearing 
3 hne8. 
The list of repetitione Show8 8 digrapha occurring twice and 2 occurring 3 time& 
c. Again, the list of repetitiona show8 10 digrapha each repeated at leaat twice; the table in 
Par. 3b (3) above ahowe that in 100 letters of random text the probability of finding at lea& 
that many digraphic coiucidencee ie only .193. That is, the chancea of this being an accident are 
but 176 in a thousand ; or another way of expreaeing the same thing ia to say that the odde againat 
this phenomenon being an accident are as 807 is to 193 or roughly 4 to 1. 
d. The probability 
of finding at lee& one trigraphic coincidence in 100 letters of random 
text is very s&l& na noted in Par. 4b; the probability of finding at least one Mragraphk 
coin- 
cidence is still smaller (Par. 4c). 
of this length. 
Yet this cipher meaeage of but 1Oq lettan, contains a repetition 
6. A consideration of the foregoing leada to the conclusion that the number and length of the 
repetitions manifested by the cryptogram are not accidental, such aa might be expected to occur 
in random text of the same length; hence they muat be causal in their origin. 
The cause in this 
case is not dif6culf to find: repeated isolated letters and repeated sequences of leftem (digraphe, 
trigraphs) in the plain text were actually enciphered by identical slphabeta, reeulting in producing 
repeated lettem and sequences in the cipher text.

It ha8 been shown t-hat the interval

Referring to tbr primary component, it will be spen that t,he lett,cbrs of the partial scqucncI\s

of the partial sequences obtained from group 2 represent a decimation intrrval 
of two in thc~ 
primnry component; and those obtained from group 3, a decimation interval of three.

c. Again referring to Figure 1, the partial sequences STI, UE, and NA can be obtained from 
Figure 3(a) by reading down columns 4, 2, and 8, respectively. 
This can be represented 
graphically 
by the symbol j, 1, which means that all partial sequences obtained from Figure 
3(a) by proceeding downward in any- column would be in the same group (i. e., secondary 
alphabet) and have the same decimation interval. 
d. The partial sequences IN, ET, and OA can be represented graphically by 1 Ii” or simply 
\I, 
which indicsk 
that all partial sequences obtained by taking lettem one space down and 
one space to the right: or one space down a diagonal to the right would represent the same 
decimation inter&. 
6. The partial sequences TN and QSO oan be represented by the symbol 1 I+; but they can

also be represented by 2 I + and, if the entire matrix of Fiie

from a primary ie the Rzllll of the 
horizontal and w-&al 
compownt8 of the. route selected. Since the partial sequence TN can be 
represented by 1 I+ the decimation interval of this sequence is equal to the vertical decimation 
2 
interva.1 of the basic square plus twice the horizontal decimation interval in that square. Any 
other route selected for the same sequence would give an equivalent of this. 
8. It is seen, therefore, that the decimation interval of a component can be represented 
graphically in various ways other than along the horizontal, by use of diagrams such as in 
Figure 3, in which the successive juxtaposed componenti have t.he same relative displacement. 
In this case the successive horizontal lines had a one-letter displacement to the left. 
h. Not being limited to one dimension, reconstruction of the primary component or au 
equivalent should be possible in one combined matrix by reversing the foregoing process and

i. (1) Using cross-section paper one can arbitrarily select the ST1 sequence in group 1 and 
write this sequence horizontally, m&ii 
the graphical notation T below group 1. 
(2) Proceeding to group 2, the partial sequence IN contains one letter in common with 
the sequence ST1 already entered, but since NA forms a sequence in group 1 and OA forms a 
sequence in group 2, it is clear that two different decimations are involved and therefore it 
would. be incorrect to integrate the ST1 and the IN into SPIN. 
However, the letter N can 
arbitrarily be placed in any position ofher than along the horizontal line*on which ST1 has been 
placed. It will be placed directly below the letter I and the group will be denoted graphically 
by 4 1, give:

(3) The skeleto n of the matrix or diagram is now tied 
in two. dimensions, and no further 
letters csn be at&4nctily 
placed within 
it. 
However, additional 
sequences tirn 
groups 1 and 2 
can be added, provided 
8 common letter is available in the diagram; sequences from other 
groups can be added, provided one psir is 8l.re8dy entered in the diagram which would fix the 
proper graphical decimation. 
(4) Moving to group 3, there is the partial sequence TN and it is noted that this peir of letters 
is present in the diagram. 
The symbol 11 c8n therefore be placed under group 3. 
(5) In group 3 the partial 
sequence QSO appears snd the letter S is in the dim. 
It 
therefore follows that the lettera Q nnd 0 c8n be placed thurr: 
(1)Q. 
. . 
(2) . S T I 
(3) . . 0, N 
FIOUU

the letter E of the partial sequence ET in group 2 goes directly above the T: 
(1) Q . E . 
(2) . S T I 
(3). 
. ON 
FIOWBB 
4 (01. 
(7) The letter U of th e sequence UE in group 1 goes before the E: 
(1) Q U E . 
(2) . S T I

the letter A of NA in group 1 follows N:

FmuxB

(9) The sequence OA in group 2 remains to be entered. 
Since both these letters 8re already 
in the diagram, the letter A can be placed under the exksting 0 or the letter 0 csn be placed 
shove the existing A. Either 
alternative 
would be correct. 
Selecting the latter 
alternative 
yields the following:

information 
hae now been entered in the dii

snd the letter 0 appesn\ twice therein. 
This letter 0 rmry be termed the “ti&n” 
letter since it 
indicstea the horizontal 
interval 
between the juxtaposed 
reconstructed 
sequences of the beaic 
matrix. 
The absence of a tie-in letter in the diagram would 
indicate 
thet insuf6cient data 8re 
preeent for the reconetruction 
of a complete fiequence.

to the right the two O’s c8n be

(2) Since each horizontal sequence must be shifted two intervals to the right of its initial 
position in relation to the line above, row (1) must be moved two intervals to the left of its original 
position. 
Thus:

. . . . . ONA

(3) Since the three rows involve the same decimation, and since the 0 of ONA coincides 
with the 0 of STIO, the ONA sequence may be raised up one row and united with the ST10 
sequence. If this is legitimate then the new row (2) may likewise be raised up one row. 
This 
yields the united sequence QUESTIONA. . . . This last step may be more clearly understood by 
studying the following partially reconstructed matrix: 
(4)ONABLYCD.. 
FI9uF.r 
4 (I). 
2. Application of principles.-u. 
For the specific application of the principles underlying 
this method reference is made to the problem described in Section VIII of the text. 
It is desired 
to reconstruct the original primary component, or an equivalent, from the values entered in the 
reconstruction skeleton shown in Figure 33, page 68. Since a mixed sequence is sliding against 
itself, all the partial sequences (pairs or greater) which can be established by studying the 
reconstruction skeleton are listed as shown in Figure 5(a). 
The single pairs in 6-7 and 8-s are 
crossed out since they offer no data for reconstruction. 
This yields the following groups of 
partial sequences: 
%- 1

b. (1) The sequences HOF and EJ in group 6 and HE in group 10 are noted. 
The HOF will 
be placed horizontally and the notation 
--, made under group 6. The letter E of the pair HE 
1 
of group 10 will be placed under the H, and the notation 4 1 added under group 10. Thus:

Since the sequence EJ belongs to the same displacement interval as HOF, the letter J can be

No more paim can be immediately added from group8 6 or 10. 
Those pairs already entered are 
trod 
out in their respective groupa and an inspection is made for additional data in another 
group. 
(2) The sequence IHJ is noted in group 9. The letters H and J are already entered in the 
diagram. 
One can therefore place the letter I, and the notation 11 is placed under group 9. 
The addition of the letter I now permits the insertion of the letter V of the sequence IV in group 
10, giving: 
I.. 
. 
V-H 0 F 
. EJ. 
ROUBS 
e (b). 
(3) In group 4 there is the sequence IO which ia obtainable in the diagram by the route 1 I+. 
This notation ie made beneath group 4; the letter A of the sequence AE and the letter G of ie 
sequence HG can now also be entered. 
The addition of the letter A permite the placement of 
the letter W of the pair WA of group 9; likewise the addition of the letter G permits the insertion of 
the letter N of the sequence GE of group 6; finally, tht placement of the’ letter N permits the 
placement of the Q of group 9. One now haa: 
W.I... 
. AVHOF. 
l 
.

EJGN 
. . . . . . Q 
rfoun8 e (0). 
(4) Referring to group 1, the sequence EGZ is noted, of which EC appeara in the diagram 
at +. 
The letter 2 can therefore be placed and the letter B of the sequence BW can be inserted 
2 
two intervals to the left of the letter W. giving: 
B.W.I..... 
. . . AVHOF.. 
. . . . . EJGNZ 
. . . . * . . . Q * 
Roum 0 (d). 
(5) Noting the sequence HZ of group 2 aa being graphically represented in the diagram by 1 IT 
the letters K, S and U of the sequencea EK, NS and UF may be placed. 
Thus: 
B . WUI........

(6) The letter T of the sequence TK of group 1 can now be placed, which permits the addi- 
tion of the letter P of the sequence TP of bgo~p 4. 
A study of the diagram shows the pair TU 
of group 8 ,at interval 3?-, which allows the placing of the letter X of the pair EX of the same

group. 
One then has:

The letter D of the sequence

(8) Pair TS of group 9 remams. It has already been noted that the notation \l

been applied to group 9. Hence the letter S can also be placed one interval to the right and 
below the T, as shown in Figure 6 (h), in which all the available data are now entered.

C. (1) The letter S appears in rows (5) and (6) at a diiplacement interval of four. 
This 
letter then serves as the “tie-in” 
letter. 
Marking off 26 squares on cross-section paper the 
D.SP of row (6) is written, and row (5) is moved four intervals to the left, at which position 
the letter S is properly superimposed as follows:

(2) Likewise row (4) is moved four intervals to the left of its original relative position to 
row (5) and dropped into position. 
Row (3) is moved the same distance in relation to row (4), 
etc. 
These steps may be illustrated as follows:

(4) It will be noted that the -fmgoing component is identical with that obtained in sub- 
paragraph m(3), page 74 of the text. 
3. Remarks.-+. 
In the example given above only one tie-in letter was available and it was 
located in adjacent rows. 
Although only one is necessary, in most cases several tie-in letters 
are present after all pairs of letters have been entered in the diagram; then the superimposed 
sequences can be easily connected by their common letters. 
If the tie-in letter had appeared 
in adjacent columns instead of adjacent mws as in the foregoing example, the columns would 
have been shifted vertically and the sequence taken from the diagram in that manner. 
b. When only a few pairs of letter forming part&l sequences are available, frequently only 
one tie-in letter may be encountered. 
If it does not occur in adjacent rows or columns the com- 
ponent can still be written with additional considerations. 
For example, adjacent diagonals 
might be used. However, the student will experience no difllculty after the application of this 
method to R few problems. 
c. Since all the data are entered in one diagram, the graphical method of reconstruction 
quickly discloses erroneous assumptions and enables one to ascertain in a short time whether 
sufficient data are present for the reconstruction of, the component., Even if this is not the case, 
the diagram automatically offers new values which may be substituted in the cryptogram. 
One 
may then assume additional values which can be entered in the diagram or which will serve to 
corroborate sequences already entered. 
d. The placing of the first two sequences of different displacement intervals in the diagram 
determines the type of sequences that will be established. 
If the original sequence entered 
horizontally in the diagram is an odd decimation of the primarv component, a 26-letter sequence 
can be obtained horizontally. 
If this original sequence is initially tied in vertically with another 
sequence of an odd decimation interval, a 26-letter sequence can also be obtained vertically 
from the diagram.

e. (1) In certain instances, however, it ,will happen that the available partial sequences 
have all resulted from even decimations of the basic sequence and that no tie-in letters are present 
to permit the integration of all the data into a single diagram. 
In such cases the reconstruction 
of the basic sequence may take place by taking data from two or more different diagrams, and 
then, using the relative positions of the letters with respect to each other in these diagrams, the 
basic sequence may be established. This method can best be demonstrated by means of an 
example, and the following one is based upon the QUEST. . . sequence of paragraph la. 
Suppose 
the reconstruction diagram from the derivation of a few plain text-cipher relationships yields the 
following partial sequences:

(2) The partial sequences in the t,hree groups can be combined to form two diagrams. 
This may be accomplished by considering the sequences of group 1 as parts of a horizontal com- 
ponent and those of group 2 as parts of a vertical component of a cipher square based upon the 
original or an equivalent primary sequence. When all the letters of these two groups have 
been entered into the two resultant diagrams in Figure 8 (a) and (b), it will be observed that the 
positions occupied in these two diagrams by the letters of group 3 represent the interval 1 13.

(b) 
(3) It will be noted that there are 12 letters in each of the two diagrams and that all the 
letters appearing in the original partial sequences have been included in these two groups. It 
appears, first, that two 13-letter sequences are involved and second, that the partial sequences in 
all three groups represent even decimations of the basic component. 
The problem now remains 
to reconstruct the original or an equivalent primary cipher square to which these diagrams belong, 
or to find the original or an equivalent component of which the partial sequences in groups 1, 2, 
and 3 are derivatives. 
(4) Since the two diagrams are linked by the partial sequences of group 3 (because the 
interval 1 I--, is common to both of them), it follows that any two letters in one of the diagrams 
2 
will be separated from each other in the basic sequence by the same interval &s any two letters 
occupying the same relative positions in the other diagram. 
Another way of saying the same 
thing is, that while the intervals between V and C, C and E, E and K, and K and A, in the basic 
component (or an equivalent thereof) are unknown, whatever they are they are identical and the 
same as that between W and D, D and S, S and M, P and B (from WDSMB), or between Y and U, 
U and J, J and N (from YUJN), and so on. Likewise, Q and K (interval 2 I,) are separated by the 
same interval as Y and S, or U and M, and so on.

(5) Making the easiest assumption first, suppose the, basic sequence is a keyword-mixed 
sequence, and that the letter 2 is the final letter thereof. 
If it is preceded by Y, then, because of 
the relative positions occupied by Y and 2 in Figure 8 (b), the following would also be sequent 
in the basic sequence: QF, HT, OP, XC, FE, TK, PA; UG, JI, ZD, GS, and Ill. 
Since the majority 
of these are hardly likely to occur in a keyword-mixed sequence, the assumption that Y precedes 
z is discarded. 
Suppose X precedes 2 (implying that Y is in the keyword). 
But X and 2 are not 
in the same diagram, so no test can be made. Suppose the sequence is W . 2. 
Then the 
following sequences would be valid: 
w . z . u 
V.X.Q 
D.G.J 
C . F . H 
S . I . N 
E . T . 0 
K.P 
These look very likely. 
In fact, noting the D. G. J and the 6. F . H sequences it seems logical to 
integrate or “dovetail” 
them thus: CDFGHJ. This then suggests that W . Z. U and V. X. Q may 
be integrated into VWXZQU; S. I. N and E. T. 0 may be integrated into ESTION. From this 
point on the matter of extending the partial sequences into the basic one is simple and rather 
obvious. 
f. (1) Suppose, however, that the basic sequence is not a keyword-mixed sequence, so that 
clues of the nature of those employed in the preceding subparagraph are no longer available. 
Then what? 
(2) Referring back to subparagraph d (3), it has already been noted that the two diagrams, 
each containing 12 letters, represent half-sequences (of 13 letters) derived ‘from an even decima- 
tion of the original component. 
(The decimation must be the same in both cases because the 
interval 11, is common to them.) 
Suppose an attempt is made to integrate the QHO, XPTP, and 
2 
VCEKA sequences of Figure 8 (a) into a 134etter cycle or half-sequence. 
The three partial 
sequences in this diagram may be united into a l&letter 
cycle in a number of ways but the 
correct integration will be that which will satisfy all the conditions set up by the partial sequences 
in groups 1, 2, and 3. After a bit of experimentation it is found that the only one which will 
satisfy all conditions is this: 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 11 12 I.3 
QHOVCEKAXFTP. 
Note, for example, that the conditions represented by QXV in group 2 are satisfied in that the 
intervals between these letters are the same in the la-letter cycle; the same is true as regards the 
intervals between 0 and T, P and K, snd so on. 
Likewise, the conjugate sequence from Figure 8 
(b) is established as 
2 
3 
4 
5 
8 
7 
6 
9 
10 11 12 13 
YUJNWDSMBZGI. 
Thus there have been established the two half-sequences involved. 
The problem now remains 
to integrate them into a single sequence which is either the primary or an equivalent basic 
component. 
* 
(3) Each of these sequences may, of course, be expanded to form a a&element sequence the 
elements of which will satisfy the interval relationships among the letters in each la-letter 
sequence. Thus :

There remains the problem of integrating 
these two sequences into a single sequence. 
(4) Suppose a start is made thus:

FIounr 10. 
All the interval relationships of groups 1, 2, and 3 of Figure 7 are satisfied by this sequence. 
If 
the sequence is written on a pair of sliding strips, any even-interval 
displacement of one of the 
strips will produce plain text-cipher 
relationships 
fully satisfied by the requirements of the 
sequences in Figure 7 or Figure 8. 
Thus: 
QYOJCWKSXBTG. 
HUVNEDAMFZPI

QYOJCWKSXBTB..HUVNEDAMFZPI

11. 
The foregoing three juxtapositions 
will satisfy all the requirements of the sequences indicated in 
groups 1,2, and 3 of Figure 7, as well as those indicated in Figures 8 (a) and (b). 
Without further 
restrictions or additional data, therefore, it is impossible to tell whether the reconstructed single 
sequence is correct or not. 
In fact, there are 13 possible integrations of the two expanded l3- 
letter sequences which will yield equivalent 
results, since there are 13 positions in which the 
“dovetailing” 
of the second sequence may be commenced with respect to the first sequence. 
Only 
one of these, however, will be correct in that it will yield a single sequence which, when slid 
against itself at all juxtapositions 
(both odd and even displacements) will invariably 
yield the 
full quota of plain text-cipher 
relationships 
that the original 
basic or an equivalent 
primary 
component yields when slid against itself. 
(An incorrect integration 
will often yield a series of 
equivalents of which only a few are wrong.) 
(5) The correct integration 
will, however, be disclosed quickly enough when the cipher text 
is consulted and one or two additional values are derived. 
Thus, suppose an additional word is 
deciphered and it yields a pair of values in a new secondary alphabet, for example, A,=D, 
and 
u,= 0,. 
The single sequence reconstructed 
as shown in Figure 10 will not yield this pair of 
values, as seen in the following juxtaposition 
of the sliding strips: 
QYOJCWKSXBTG..HUVNEDAMFZPI 
IQYOJCW*KSXBTG..HUVNEDAMFZP 
I 
Flonar 12. 
Here A,=D,. but U,,=He, not 0,. 
However, if the “dovetailing” 
is commenced with the letter S, 
of Figure 9 and the resultant 26-letter sequence is juxtaposed against itself as shown in Figure 13, 
it will be found that the sequence will now satisfy all the requirements.

The sequence is, of course, a decimation of the QUESTIONABLY . . . sequence, at the third interval.

Two messages, 
Message A (plaintext) 
and Message B (ciphertext), 
have been 
intercepted. 
It 
is 
suspected 
that 
Message A is 
the plaintext 
beginning 
of 
Message B (and only 
that 
portion 
of Message B that 
matches Message A is fur- 
nished). 
The enemy has been using 
a mixed 
sequence 
slid 
against 
itself. 
Determine 
the 
keyword 
upon which 
the 
primary 
component 
is 
based 
and the 
specific 
key used to encipher 
Message B.

COMPUTER PROGRAMS 
The computer 
programs 
that 
follow 
have been especially 
written 
for 
this 
book 
by Wayne G. Barker. 
These computer 
programs, 
although 
written 
specifically 
in BASIC for 
use with 
a TRS-80 MODEL 4 computer, 
with 
usually 
minimum change 
are 
likewise 
applicable 
to 
other 
personal 
computers 
which 
use BASIC. 
The 
computer 
programs 
are 
only 
representative 
of the many programs 
that 
pertain 
to 
polyalphabetic 
substitution 
cipher 
systems. 
These 
type 
cipher 
systems 
particularly 
lend 
themselves 
to the use of computer 
programs 
to perform 
both 
cryptographic 
and cryptanalytic 
tasks. 
Indeed, 
virtually 
all 
the cryptana- 
lytic 
operations 
described 
in 
this 
book can be duplicated 
and perhaps 
even 
improved 
upon by computer 
programs. 
Each of 
the 
following 
listed 
computer 
programs 
is 
followed 
by a RUN of the 
program 
to 
show clearly 
the 
results 
obtained 
by using 
the program. 
The re- 
sults 
of using 
the 
listed 
programs 
for 
the most part 
are self-evident. 
Only 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
fourth 
listed 
program, 
"Determining 
the 
Period 
of 
a 
Periodic 
Cipher", 
is an explanation 
of the program 
probably 
required. 
Using 
the program, 
the "period" 
of most simple 
polyalphabetic 
substitution 
ciphers 
can 
usually 
be easily 
discovered. 
The only 
qualification 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
program 
is 
that 
the 
"period" 
must be relatively 
short, 
up to about 
25 
letters, 
and the 
length 
of 
the 
ciphertext 
must be sufficient 
to provide 
a 
reasonable 
number 
of 
letters 
to 
be enciphered 
by each 
letter 
of 
the key. 
The computer 
program 
in 
turn 
"tests" 
various 
key-lengths, 
beginning 
first 
with 
a key-length 
of 
1, then 
a key-length 
of 2, 
etc. 
For each key-length 
the program 
provides 
the average 
"index 
of coincidences" 
for 
the repetitions 
found 
in 
the 
various 
monoalphabetic 
distributions 
formed 
by the key-length 
being 
tested. 
In general, 
the closer 
that 
the average 
"IC" 
approaches 
.0667 
(the 
probability 
of 
monographic 
coincidence 
in 
English 
telegraphic 
plain- 
text), 
the more likely 
it 
is that 
the key-length 
producing 
that 
average 
"If?' 
is 
the 
correct 
"period'* 
or key-length 
of the ciphertext 
being 
examined. 
In 
this 
connection, 
it 
is 
advised 
that 
the student 
especially 
read Appendix 
2, 
pages 108-118.

1. F’reliminary remarks .-a. 
The text immediately 
preceding this devoted itself almost 
exclusively to polyalphabetic 
substitution 
systems of the type called repeating-key ciphers. 
It was seen how a regulaxity in the employment of a limited number of alphabets results in the 
manifestation of periodicity 
or cyclic phenomena in the cryptogram, by means of which the 
latter may be solved. 
The difEculty in solution is directly correlated with the type and number 
of cipher alphabets employed in specific examples. 
13. Two procedures suggest themselves for consideration when the student cryptanalyst 
realizes the foregoing circumstances 
and thinks of methods to eliminate the weaknesses inherent 
in this cryptographic 
system. 
First, noting that the difficulties 
in solution increase as the 
length of the key increases, he may study the effects of employing much longer keys to see if 
one would be warranted in piacing much trust in that method of increasing the security of the 
messages. Upon second thought, however, remembering that as a general rule the first step 
in the solution consists in ascertaining the number of alphabets employed, it seems to him that 
the most logical thing to do would be to use a procedure which will avoid periodicity altogether, 
will thus eliminate the cyclic phenomena that are normally manifested in cryptograms of a 
periodic construction, 
and thus prevent an enemy cryptanalyst 
from taking even a first step 
toward solution. 
In other words, he will investigate the possibilities of apwiodic systems first 
and if the results are unsatisfactory, he will then see what he can do with systems using lengthy 
keys. 
c. Accordingly, the first part of this text will be devoted to an examination of certain of the 
very simple varieties of aperiodic, polyalphabetic 
substitution 
systems; after this, methods of 
extending or lengthening short mnemonic keys, and systems using lengthy keys will be studied. 
2. General remarks upon the nature of cryptographic periodicity.--a. 
When the thoughtful 
student considers the matter of petriodicity in polyalphabetic 
substitution 
systems and tries to 
ascertain its real nature, he notes, with some degree of interest and surprise perhaps that it is 
composed of two fundamental factors, because there are in reality tzoo elements involved in ita 
production. 
He has, of course, become quite familiar with the idea that periodicity 
necessitates 
the use of a keying element and that the latter must be employed in a cyclic manner. 
But he 
now begins to realize that there is another element involved, the significance of which he haa 
perhaps not fully appreciated, oiz, that unless the key is applied to constant-length plain-text 
groups no periodicity will be man&ted 
externally by the cryptogram, despite the repetitive or 
cyclic use of a constant-length key. 
This realization is quickly followed by the idea that possibly 
all periodicity may be avoided or suppressed by either or both of two ways: (1) By using constant- 
length keying units to encipher variable-length 
plain-text 
groupings or (2) by using variable- 
length keying units to encipher constanf-length plain-text groupings. 
b. The student at once realizes also that the periodicity exhibited by repeating-key ciphers 
of the type studied in the preceding text, is of a very simple character. 
There, successive letters 
of the repetitive key were applied to successive letters of the text. 
In respect to the employment 
of the key, the cryptographic or keying procesFJ may be said to be constant orjixed in character. 
This terminology remains true even if a single keying unit servea to encipher two or more letters 
(1)

2 
at a time, provided only &at the groupings of plain-text lett,ers are constant, in lengt,h. 
For 
example, a single key letter may serve to encipher two successive plain-text letters; if the key is 
repetitive in character and the message is sufficient, in length, periodicity will still be manifested 
by the cryptogram and the latter can be solved by the methods indicated in the preceding text.l 
Naturally, 
those methods would hare to be modified in accordance with the specific t-ype of 
grouping involved. 
Tn this case the factoring process would disclose an apparent key length 
t,wice that of the real length. 
But study of the frequency distributions 
would soon show that 
the 1st and 2d distributions were similar, the 3d and 4th, the 5th and 6th, and so on, depending 
upon the length of the key. 
The logical step is therefore to combine the distributions in proper 
pairs and proceed as usual. 
c. In all such cases of encipherment by constant-length groupings, the apparent length of 
the period (as found by applying the factoring process to the cryptogram) is a multiple of the 
real length and the multiple corresponds to the length of the groupings, that is, the number of 
plain-text letters enciphered by the same key letter. 
d. The point t,o be noted, how-ever, is that all these cases are still periodic in character, 
because both the keying units and the plain-text groupings are constant in length. 
3. Effects of varying the length of the plain-text groupings.--e. 
But now consider the effects 
of making one or the other of these two elements oariable in length. 
Suppose that the plain-test 
groupings are made variable in length and that the keying units are kept constant in length. 
Then, even though the key may be cyclic in character and may repeat itself many times in the 
course of encipherment, external periodicity is suppressed, unless the luw governing the variation 
in plain-text 
groupings 
is itself cyclic in character, and the length of the message is at least tzco or 
more times that of the cycle applicable to this variable grouping. 
b. (1) For example, -suppose the correspondents agree to use reversed standard cipher 
alphabets with the key word SIGNAL, to encipher a message, the latter being divided up into 
groups as shown below:

(2) The cipher text in this example (Fig. 1) shows a tetragraphic 
and a pentagraphic 
repetition. 
The two occurrences of QUWUG ( =COhW.A) are separated by an interval 
of 90 
letters; the two occurrences of ARQN ( =IRST) 
by 39 letters. 
The former repetition (QUKJG) , 
it u-ill be noted, is a true periodic repetition, since the plain-text 
letters, their grouping, and 
the key letters are identical. 
The interval in this case, if counted in terms of letters, is the 
product of the keying cycle, 6, by the grouping cycle, 15. 
The latter repetition 
( ARQN) is not 
a true periodic repetition in the sense that both cycles have been completed at the same point, 
as is the case in t,he former repetition. 
It is true that the cipher letters ARQN, representing 
IRST both times, are produced by the same key lett,ers, I and G, but the enciphering points in 
t,he grouping cycle are different in the two cases. Repetitions of this type may be termed 
partially 
periodic repetitions, to distinguish them from those of the completely periodic type. 
c. ‘&hen the intervals between the two repetitions noted above are more carefully studied, 
especially from the point of view of the interacting cycles which brought them about, it will be 
seen that counting acrording to groupings and not according to single letters, the two pentagraphs 
QU’WUG 
are separated by an interval of 30 groupings. 
Or, if one prefers to look at the matter in 
the light of the keying cycle, the two occurrences of QUWJG are separated by 30 key letters. 
Since the key is but 6 let,ters in length, this means that the key has gone through 5 cycles. 
Thus, 
the number 30 is the product of the number of letters in the keying cycle (6) by the number 
of different-length 
groupings in the grouping cycle (5). 
The interaction 
of these two cycles 
may be conceived of ns partaking of the nature of two gears which are in mesh, one driven by 
the other. 
One of these gears has 6 teeth, the ot,her 5, and the teeth are numbered. 
If the 
two gears are adjusted so that the “number 
1 teeth” are adjacent to each other, and the gears 
are caused to revolve, these two teeth will not come together again until the larger gear hns 
made 5 revolutions and the smaller one 6. 
During this time, a total of 30 meshings of individual 
teeth will have occurred. 
But since one revolution of the smaller gear (=the grouping cycle) 
represents the encipherment of 15 iet,ters, when translated in terms of letters, the 6 complete 
revolutions of this gear mean the encipherment of 90 letters. 
This accounts for the period of 
90, when stated in terms of letters. 
d. The two occurrences of the other repetition, 
ARQN, are at an interval of 39 letters; but 
in terms of the number of intervening 
groupings, the interval is 12, which is obviously two 
times the length of the keying cycle. 
In other words, the key has in this case passed through 2 
cycles. 
e. In a long message enciphered according to such a scheme aa the foregoing there would 
be many repetitions of both types discussed above (the completely periodic and the partially 
periodic) so that the cryptanalyst 
might encounter some difticulty 
in his attempts to reach a 
solution, especially if he hnd no information 
as to the basic system. 
It is to be noted in this 
connection that if any one of bhe groupings exceeds say 5, 6, or 7 letters in length, the scheme 
may give itself away rather easily, since it is clear that within 
each grouping 
the encipherment is 
strictly 
monoalphubetic. 
Therefore, in the event of groupings of more than 5 or 6 letters, the 
monoalphabetic 
equivalents 
of tell-tale 
words such as ATTACK, BATTALION, DIVISION, 
etc., would stand out. 
The system is most efficacious, therefore, with short groupings. 
f. It.should also be noted that there is nothing about the scheme which requires a regularity 
in the grouping cycle such as that embodied in the example. 
A lengthy grouping cycle such as 
the one shown below may just as easily be employed, it being guided by a key of its own; for 
example, the number of dots and dashes contained in the International 
Morse signals for the 
letters composing the phrase DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE might be used. Thus, A (. -> 
has 2, B (-.. 
.> has 4, and so on. 
Hence: 
DECLARATIONOFINDEPENDENCE

4 
The grouping cycle is 3+ 1 f-4+4+2 
. . ., or 60 letters in length. 
Suppose the same phrase 
is used as an enciphering key for determining 
the selection of cipher alphabets. 
Since the 
phrase contains 25 letters, the complete period of the system would be the least common multiple 
of 25 and 60 or 300 letters. 
This system might appear to yield a very high degree of crypto- 
graphic security. 
But the student will see as he progresses that the security is not so high as 
he may at first glance suppose it to be. 
4. Primary and secondary periods ; resultant periods.-a. 
It has been noted that the length 
of the complete period in a system such as the foregoing is the least common multiple of the 
length of the two component or interacting 
periods. 
In a way, therefore, since the component 
periods constitute the basic element of the scheme, they may be designated as the basic or primary 
periods. 
These are also hidden or latent periods. 
The apparent or patent period, that is, the 
complete period, may be designated as the secondary or resultant period. 
In certain types of 
cipher machines there may be more t,han two primary periods which interact to produce a 
resultant period; also, there are cases in which the latter may interact with anot’her primary 
period to produce a tertiary period; and so on. 
The final, or resultant, or apparent period is the 
one which is usually ascertained Crst as a result of the study of the intervals between repetitions. 
This may or may not be broken down into its component primary periods. 
b. Although a solution may often be obt.ained without breaking down a resultant period 
into its component primary periods, the reading of many messages pertaining to a widespread 
system of secret communication is much facilitated when the analysis is pushed to its lowest 
level, that is, to the point where the final cryptographic scheme has been reduced to its simplest 
terms. 
This may involve the discovery of a multiplicit,y 
of simple elements which interact in 
successive cryptographic strata.

5. Introductory 
remarks.-a. 
The system described in paragraph 3 abore is obriously not 
to be classified as aperiodic in nature, despite the injection of a variable factor which inthvt 
case was based upon irregularity 
in the length of one of the two elements involved in polyalpha- 
betic substitution. 
The variable factor was there subject to a law which in itself was periodic 
in character. 
b. To make such a system truly aperiodic in character, by elaborating upon the basic 
scheme for producing variable-length 
plain-text grouping s, would be possible, but impractical. 
For example, using the same method as is given in paragraph 3f for determining the lengths of 
the groupings, one might employ the text of a book; and if the latter is longer than the message 
to be enciphered, the cryptogram would certainly show no periodicity as regards the intervals 
between repetitions, which would be plentiful. 
However, as already indicated, such a scheme 
would not be very practical for regular communication between n large number of correspondents, 
for reasons which are no doubt apparent. 
The book would have to be safeguarded as would a 
code; enciphering and deciphering would be quite slow, cumbersome, and subject to error; 
and, unless the same key text were used for all messages, methods or indicators would have to 
be adopted to show exactly where encipherment begins in each message. A simpler method 
for producing constantly changing, aperiodic plain-text groupings therefore, is to be sought. 
6. Aperiodic encipherment 
produced by groupings according to word lengths.-. 
The 
simplest method for producing aperiodic plain-text 
groupings is one which hns doubtless long 
ago presented itself to the student, G., encipherment according to the actual word lengths of 
the message to be enciphered. 
b. Although the average number of letters composing the words of any alphabetical language 
is fairly constant, successive words comprising plain text vaxy a great deal in this respect, and 
this variation is subject to no law.’ 
In telegraphic English, for example, the mean length of 
words is 5.2 letters; the words may contain from 1 to 15 or more letters, but the su’ccessive 
words vary in length in an extremely irregular manner, no matter how long the text may be. 
c. As a consequence, the use of word lengths for dete rmining the number of letters to be 
enciphered by each key letter of a repetitive key commends itself to the inexperienced cryptog- 
rapher as soon as he comes to understand the way in ,which repeating-key ciphers are solved. 
If there is no periodicity in the cryptograms, how can the letters of the cipher text, written in 
1 It is true, of course, that the differences between two writers in respect to the lengths and characters of 
the words contained in their personal vocabularies 
are often marked and can be measured. 
These differences 
may be subject to certain laws, but the latter are not of the type in which we are interested, being psychological 
rather than mathematical 
in character.

;3-letter groups, be distributed into their respective monoalphabets? 
And if t,his very first step 
is impos;sihle. how can the crypto,Tams be solved? 
7. Solution when direct standard cipher alphabets are employed.--a. 
Despite the foregoing 
rhetorical questions, the solution of this case is really quite simple. 
It merely involves a modifi- 
cation of thr mctllod given in a previous text,2 wherein solution of a monoalphabetic cipher 
employing a direct standard nlphnbet is accomplished by completing the plain-component 
sequence. There, all the words of the entire messa.ge come out on a single generatrix of the 
completion diagram. 
In the present case, since the individual, 
separate words of a message 
are enciphered by different key letters, these words will reappear on diflerent gene&rices 
of the 
diagram. 
All the cryptannlyst has to do is to pick them out. 
He can do this once he has found 
a good starting point, by using a little imaginat,ion and following clues afforded by the context. 
b. An example will make the method clear. 
The following message (note its brevity) has 
been intercepted: 
TRECS 
YGETI 
LUVWV 
IKMQI 
RXSPJ 
SVAGR 
XUXPW 
VMTUC 
SYXGX 
VHFFB 
LLBHG 
c. Submitting the message to routine study, the first step is to use normal alphabet strips 
and try out the possibility 
of direct standard alphabets having been used. The completion 
diagram for the first 10 letters of the message is shown in figure 2. 
d. Despite the fact that the text does not all reappear on the 
same generatrix, the solution is a very simple matter because the 
first three words of the message are easily found: CAN YOU GET. 
The key letters may be sought in the usual manner and are found 
to be REA. 
One may proceed to set up the remaining letters of 
the message on sliding normal alphabets, or one may assume 
various keywords such as READ, REAL, REAM, etc., and try to 
continue the decipherment in that way. 
The former method is 
easier. The completed solution is as follows:

e. Note the key in the foregoing case: It is composed of the 
successive key letters of the phrase READERS DIGEST. 
f. The only difficult part of such a solution is that of making 
the first step and getting a start on a word. 
If the words are 
short it is rather easy to overlook good possibilities and thus 
spend some time in fruitless searching. 
However, solution must 
come; if nothing good appears at the beginning of the message, 
search should be made in the interior of the cryptogram or at 
the end.

8. Solution when reversed standard cipher alphabets are employed.-It 
should by this time 
hardly be necessary to indicnte that the only change in the procedure set, forth in paragraph 
;c, d in the case of reTerscd standard cipher alphabets is that the letters of the cryptogram must 
be converted into their plain-component 
(direct standard) equivalents before the completion 
sequence is applied to the message. 
9. Comments on foreg0ir.g cases.--a. The foregoin g cases are so simple in nature that the 
detailed t,rea.tment accorded them would seem hardly to be u-arranted at this stage of study. 
However, they are necessary and valuable as an introduction 
to the more complicated cases to 
follow. 
b. Throughout 
this text, whenever encipherment processes are under discussion, the pair 
of enciphering equations commonly referred to as characterizing the so-called Vigent!re method 
will be understood, unless otherwise indicated. 
This method involves the pair of enciphering 
equations 0,,1=&n; 
0D,1=Oe,2, that is, the index letter, which is usually the initial letter of the 
plain component, is set opposite the key letter on. the cipher component; the plain-text letter 
to be enciphered is sought on the plain component and its equivalent is the letter opposite it 
on the cipher component.3 
c. The solution of messages prepared according to the two preceding methods is particularly 
easy, for the reason that standard cipher alphabets are employed and these, of course, are derived 
from known components. 
The significance of this statement should by this time be quite 
obvious to the student. 
But what if mixed alphabets are employed, so that one or both of the 
components upon which the cipher a.lphabets are based are unknown sequences? The simple 
procedure of completing the plain component obviously cannot be used. Since the messages 
are polyalphabetic 
in character, and since the process of factoring cannot be applied, it would 
seem that the solution of messages enciphered in different alphabets and according to word 
lengths would be a rather difficult matter. 
However, it will soon be made clear that the solution 
is not nearly so difficult as first impression might lead the student to imagine.

10. Solution when the original word lengths are retained in the cryptogram.-a. 
This case 
will be discussed not because it is encountered in practical military cryptography but because it 
affords a good introduction 
to the case in which the original word lengths are no longer in evi- 
dence in the cryptogram, the latter appearing in the usual B-letter groups. 
b. Reference is made at this point to the phenomenon called idiomorphism, and its value in 
connection with the application of the principles of solution by the “probable-word” 
method, 
as explained in a previous text.’ 
When the original word lengths of a message are retained in 
the cryptogram, there is no difficulty in searching for and locating idiomorphs and then making 
comparisons between these idiomorphic 
sequences in the message and special word patterns 
set forth in lists maintained for the purpose. 
For example, in the following message note the 
underlined groups and study the letters within these groups: 
MESEAQE

c. Reference to lists of words commonly found in military 
text and arranged according to 
their idiomorphic patterns or formulae soon gives suggestions for these cipher groups. 
Thus:

d. PTith these assumed equivalents a reconstruction skeleton or diagram of cipher alphabets 
(forming a portion of a quadricular 
table) is established, on the hypothesis that the cipher 
alphabets have been derived from the slidin g of a mixed component against the normal se- 
quence. 
First it is noted that since O,=% both in the word DIVISION and in the word OCLOCK 
their cipher equivalents must be in the same alphabet. 
The reconstruction skeleton is then as 
follows: 
Division, 
o’clock----- (1) 
Battalion ----(2) 
Artillery 
--..--(3) 
- -_ 
1 -- 
e. Noting t,hat the interval between 0 and R in the first and second alphabets is the same, 
direct symmetry of position is assumed 
In a few moments the first alphabet in the skeleton 
becomes as follows: 
MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
--.--- 
.- 
DRAU 
I 
EF 
JK 
---- 
- 
N 0 
T V 
.- 
F 
J 
P 
f. The key word upon which the mixed component is based is now not difllcult 
to find: 
HYDRAULIC. 
g. (1) To decipher the entire message, the simplest procedure is to convert the cipher 
letters into their plaincomponent 
equivalents (setting the HYDRJWLIC . . . Z sequence against 
the normal alphabet at any point of coincidence) and then completing the plain-component 
sequence, a8 usual. 
The words of the message will then reappear on Werent gene&rice-s.

key let,ters may then be ascertained and the solution completed. 
Thus, for the first three words, 
the diagram is as follows:

h. In case the plain component is the reversed normal sequence, the procedure is no different 
from the foregoing, except that in the completion diagram the reversed sequence is employed 
after the cipher letters have been converted into their plain-component equivalents. 
i. fro doubt the student realizes from his previous work that once the primary mixed 
component has been recovered the latter becomes a known sequence and that the solution of 
subsequent messages employing the same set of derived alphabets, even though the keys to 
individual 
messages are different, then becomes a simple matter.

11. Solution when other types of alphabets are employed.--+ 
The foregoing examples 
involve the use either of standaxd cipher alphabets or of mixed cipher alphabets produced b:- 
the sliding of a mixed component against the normal sequence. There is, however, nothing 
about the general cryptographic 
scheme which prevents the use of other types of derived, 
interrelated, 
or secondary mixed alphabets. 
Cipher alphabets produced by the sliding of a 
mixed component against itself (either direct or reversed) or by the sliding of two different 
mixed components are very commonly encountered in these cases. 
b. The solution of such cases involves only slight modifications in procedure, namely, those 
connected with the reconstruction 
of the primary components. 
The student should be in a 
positim to employ to good advantage and without difficulty 
what he has learned about the 
princi )les of indirect symmetry of position in the solution of cases of the kind described. 
c. The solution of a message prepared with mixed alplit ’ pts derived ns indicated in sub- 
parag:,aph b, may be a difIicult matter, depending upon the iongth of the message in question. 
It might, of course, be almost impossible if the message is short and there is no background for 
the application of the probable-word method. 
But if the message is quite long, or, what is 
more probable with respect to military communications, should the system be used for regular 
tragic, so that there axe available for study several messages enciphered by the same set of 
alphabets, then the problem becomes much easier. In addition to the usual steps in solution 
by the probable-word method, guided by a search for and identification 
of idiomorphs, there is 
the help that can be obtained from the use of the phenomena of isomorphism, 
a study of which 
forms the subject of discussion in the next paragraph. 
12. Isomorphism 
and its importance 
in cryptanalytics.--+ 
The term idiomorphism 
is 
familiar to the student. 
It designates the phenomena arising from the presence and positions 
of repeated letters in plain-text words, aa a result of which such words may be classified according 
to their compo&ons, 
‘!patterns,” 
or formulae. 
The term isomorphism 
(from the Greek ‘(isos” 
meaning “equal” and “morphe” 
meaning “form”) 
designates the phenomena arising from the 
existence of two or more idiomorphs with identical formulae. 
Two or more sequences which 
possess identical formulae axe said to be isomorphic. 
b. Isomorphism may exist in plain text or in cipher text. 
For example, the three words 
WARRANT, LETTERS, and MISSION are isomorphic. 
If enciphered monoalphabetically, 
their 
cipher equivalents would also be isomorphic. 
In generd, isomorphism is a phenomenon of 
monoalphabeticity 
(either plain or cipher); but there are izstances wherein it is latent and can 
be made patent in polyalphabetic cryptograms. 
c. In practical cryptanalysis the phenomena of isomorphism afford a constantly astonishing 
source of clues and aids in solution. 
The alert cryptanalyst, is always on the lookout for situations 
in which he can 
take advantage of these phenomena, for they are among the most interesting 
and most import&t 
in cryptanalytics. 
13. Illustration 
of the use 
of isomorphism.--a. 
Let us consider the case discussed under 
paragraph 10, wherein a message was enciphered with a set of mixed cipher alphabets derived 
from sliding the key word-mixed primary component HYDRAULIC . . . XZ against the normal 
sequence. Suppose the message to be as follows (for simplicity, 
original word lengths are 
retained):

b. (1) Only a few minutes inspection discloses the following three sets of isomorphs: 
(1) 
(2) VVithout stopping to refer to word-pattern 
lists in an attempt to identify 
the very 
striking idiomorphs of the first set, let the student proceed to build up partial sequences of 
equivalents, as though he were dealing with a case of indirect symmetry of position. 
Thus:2 
From isomorphs (1) (a) and (1) (b): 
V+C;CeS; 
L+P; 
KeH; 
IcQ; 
DeK; 
S+L; 
JGZ; 
from which the following partial sequences are constructed: 
(a) VCSLP (b) DKH (c) IQ 
(d) JZ 
From isomorphs (1) (b) and (1) (c): 
C==P ; SGA; 
PGD ; HeE; 
Q+R; 
KGX; 
L+N; 
Z+B ; 
from which the following partial sequences are constructed: 
(e) CPD (f) SA (g) HE (h) QR (i) KX (j) LN 
(k) ZB 
From isomorphs (1) (a) and (1) (c): 
v+P; 
CeA; 
L+D; 
K+E; 
I+R; 
D+X; 
SCN; 
JcB; 
from which the following partial sequences are constructed: 
0) LDX 
Cm> VP (n> CA (0) KE (p) IR 
(q) SN (r) JB 
Noting that the data from the three isomorphs of this set may be combined (VCSLP and CPD 
make VCSLP . . D; the latter and LDX make VCSLP . . D . . . X), the following sequences are 
established: 
c. (1) The fact that the longest of these chains consists of exactly 13 letters and that no 
additions can be made from the other two cases of isomorphism, leads to the assumption that a 
“half-chain” 
is here disclosed and that the latter represents a decimation of the original primary 
111460789 
component at an even interval. 
Noting the placement of the letters V . S . P . N . K , 
I The symbol 0 b to be read ‘58 equivalent

alphabets belonging to a 
set of secondary alphabets. 
(c) Repetitions of plain-text words, enciphered by diflerent alphabets, produce isomorphs 
and the lengths of the isomorphs are definitely known as a result of circumstance (a). 
(2) Of these facts, the last is of most interest in the present connection. 
But what if the 
actual word lengths are not shown; that is, what if the text to be solved is intercepted in the 
usual 5-letter-group 
form?

14. Qeneral remarks.--+. 
The cases described thus far are particularly easy to solve because 
the cryptanalyst 
has before him the messages in their true or original word lengths. 
But in 
military cryptography 
this is seldom or never the case. The problem is therefore made some- 
what more difficult by reason of the fact that there is nothing to indicate definitely the limits of 
encipherment by successive keyletters. 
However, the solution merely necessitates more es- 
perimentation in this case than in the preceding. 
The cryptanalyst 
must take careful note of 
repetitions which may serve to “block out” or delimit words, and hope that when this is done he 
will be able to find and identify certain sequences having familiar idiomorphic features or pat- 
terns, such as those noted above. 
If there is plenty of text, repetitions will be sufficient in number 
to permit of employing this entering wedge. 
b. Of course, if any sort of stereotypic phraseology is employed, especially at the beginnings 
or endings of the messages, the matter of assuming values for sequences of cipher letters is easy, 
and affords a quick solution. 
For example, suppose that as a result, of previous work it has been 
found that many messages begin with the expression REFERRING TO YOUR NUMBER , . . . 
Having several messages for study, the selection of one which begins with such a common 
idiomorphism as that given by the word REFERRING is a relatively simple matter; and having 
found the word REFERRING, .if with a fair degree of certainty one can add the words TO YOUR 
NUMBER, the solution is probably well under way. 
c. (1) Take the case discussed in paragraph 13, but assume that word lengths are no longer 
indicated because the message is transmitted 
in the usual s-letter groups. 
The process of 
ascertaining the exact length of sequences which are isomorphic, or, as the process is briefly 
termed, “blocking out isomorphs” becomes a more difficult matter and must often rest upon 
rather tenuous threads of reasoning. 
For example, take the illustrative 
message just dealt 
with and let it be assumed that it was arranged in s-letter groups.

(2) The detection of isomorphisms now becomes a more diflicult 
matter. 
There is no 
special trouble in picking out the following three isomorphic sequences: 
(1) V C L L K I D V S J D C I 
(2) 
C S P P H Q K C L Z K S Q 
(3) P A D D E R X P N B X A R

&ace the first one happens to be at the beginning of the message and its left-hand boundary, or 
‘&head,” is marked by (or rather, coincides with) the beginning of the message. By a fortunate 
circumstance, the right-hand 
boundary, or “tail,” 
can be fixed just as accurately. 
That the 
repetition extends as far as indicated above is certain for we have a check on the last column 
I, Q, R. 
If an additional column were added, the letters would be 0, L, I. 
Since the second 
letter has previously appeared while the first and third have not, a contradiction results and the 
new column may not be included. 
If, however, none of the three letters 0, L, I had previously appeared, so that there could 
be no means of getting a check on their correctness, it would not be possible to block out or 
ascertain the extent of the isomorphism in such a case. All that could be said would be that 
it seems to include the first 13 letters, but it might continue further. 
d. (1) However, the difficulty 
or even the impossibility 
of blocking out the isomorphs to 
their full 
extent is not usually a serious matter. 
After all, the cryptanalyst uses the phenomenon 
not to identify 
words but to obtain cryptanalytic 
data for reconstructing 
cipher alphabets. 
For example, how many data are lost when the illustrative 
message of subparagraph 13~ is 
rewritt,en in &letter groups as in subparagraph 14c (I)? 
Suppose the latter form of message 
be studied for isomorphs:

(2) If the underscored sequences are compared with those in the message in subparagraph 
13a, it will be found that only a relatively small amount of information has been lost. 
Certainly 
not enough to cause any difficulty 
have been lost in this case, for all the data necessary for the 
reconstruction 
of the mixed cipher component came from the first set of isomorphs, and the 
latter are identical in length in both cases. Only the head and tail letters of the second pair 
of isomorphic sequences are not included in the underscored sequences in the 5-letter version 
of the message. The third pair of isomorphic sequences shown in paragraph 13b does not appear 
in the 5-lett.er version since there is only one repeated letter in this case. In long messages or 
when there are many short messages, a study of isomorphism will disclose a sufficient number of 
partial isomorphs to give data usually sufficient for purposes of alphabet reconstruction. 
e. It should be noted that there is nothing about the phenomenon of isomorphism which 
restricts its use to cases in which the cipher alphabets are secondary alphabets resulting from 
the sliding of a mixed component against the normal. 
It can be useful in all cases of interrelated 
secondary alphabets no matter what the basis of their derivation may be. 
j. In subsequent studies the important role which the phenomenon of isomorphism plays 
in cryptanalytics 
will become more apparent. 
When the tra%ic is stereotypic in character, 
even to a slight degree, so that isomorphism may extend over several words or phrases, the 
phenomenon becomes of highest importance to the cryptanalyst 
and an extremely valuable tool 
in his hands. 
15. Word sepnrators.-u. 
One of the practical difEiculties in employing systems in which the 
keying process shifts according to word lengths is that in handling such a message the decrypto- 
graphing clerk is often not certain exactly when the termination 
of a word has been reached, 
and thus time is lost by him. 
For instance, while decryptographing 
a word ‘such as INFORM 
the clerk would not know whether he now has the complete word and should shift to the next 
key letter or not: The word might be INFORMS, INFORMED, INFORMING, INFORMAL, INFOR-

MATION, etc. 
The past tense of verbs, the plural of nouns, and terminations of various sorts 
capable of being added to word roots would give rise to difliculties, 
and the latter would be 
especially troublesome if the messages contained a few telegraphic errors. 
Consequently, a 
scheme which is often adopted to circumvent this source of trouble is to indicate the end of a 
word by an infrequent letter such as Q or X, and enciphering the letter. 
In such usage these 
letters are called word separators. 
b. When word separators are employed and this fact, is once discovered, their presence is 
of as much aid to the cryptanalyst in his solution as it is to the clerks who are to decryptograph 
the messages. Sometimes the presence of these word separators, even when enciphered, aids 
or makes possible the blocking out of isomorphs. 
16. Variations and concluding remarks on foregoing systems-u. 
The systems thus far 
described are all based upon word-length encipherment using different cipher alphabets. 
Kords 
are markedly irregular in regard to this feature of their construction, and thus aperiodicity is 
imparted to such cryptograms. 
But’ variations in the method, aimed at making the latter 
somewhat, more secure, are possible. 
Some of these variations will now be discussed. 
b. Instead of enciphering according to natural B-ord lengths, the irregular groupings of the 
text may be regulated by other agreements. 
For example, suppose that the numerical value 
(in the normal sequence) of each key letter be used to control the number of letters enciphered 
by the successive cipher alphabets. 
Depending then upon the composition of the key word or 
key phrase, there would be a varying number of letters enciphered in each alphabet. 
If the 
key word were PREPARE, for instance, then the first cipher alphabet would be used for 16 
(P=16) letters, the second cipher alphabet, for 18 (=R) letters, and so on. 
Monoalphabetic 
encipherment would therefore allow plenty of opportunity 
for tell-tale word patterns to manifest 
themselves in the cipher text. 
Once an entering wedge is found in this manner, solution would 
be achieved rather rapidly. 
Of course, all types of cipher alphabets may be employed in this 
and the somewhat similar schemes described. 
c. If the key is short, and the message is long, periodicity will be manifested in the crypto- 
gram, so that it would be possible to ascertain the length of the basic cycle (in this case thelength 
of the key) despite the irregular groupings in encipherment. 
The determination of the length 
of the cycle might, however, present di%culties in some cases, since the basic or fundamental 
period would not be clearly evident because of the presence of repetitions which are not periodic 
in their ori,ti. 
For example, suppose the word PREPARE were used as a key, each key letter 
being employed to encipher a number of letters corresponding to its numerical value in the 
normal sequence. It is clear that the length of the basic period, in terms of letters, would here 
be the sum of the numerical values of P (=16)+R 
(=18) 
+ E (=5), and so on, totalling 79 
letters. 
But because the key itself contains repeated letters and because encipherment by each 
key letter is monoalphabetic there would be plenty of cases in which the first letter P would 
encipher the same or part of the same word as the second letter P, producing repetitions in the 
cryptogram. 
The same would be true as regards encipherments by the two R’s and the two 
E l a in this key word. 
Consequently, the basic period of 79 would be distorted or masked by 
aperiodic repetitions, the intervals between which would not be a function of, nor bear any 
relation to, the length of the key. 
The student will encounter more cases of this kind, in which 
a fundamental periodicity is masked or obscured by the presence of cipher-text repetitions not 
attributable 
to the fundamental cycle. 
The experienced cryptanalyst 
is on the lookout for 
phenomena of this type, when he finds in a polyalphabetic cipher plent,y of repetitions but with 
no factorable constancy which leads to the disclosure of a short period. 
He may conclude, then, 
either that the cryptogram involves several primary periods which interact to produce a long 
resultant period, or that it involves a fairly long fundamental cycle within which repetitions of a

nonperiodic origin are present. and obscure the phenomena manifested by repetitions of a periodic 
Ol-i,giD. 
d. (1) -1 loricnl est,enaion of the principle of polyalphabetic encipherment of variable-length 
plain-text groupings is the case in which these plain-text groupings rarely exceed 4 letters, so 
that a given cipher alphabet is in play for only a very short time, thus breaking up what might 
otherwise appear as fairly long repetitions in the cipher text. 
For example, suppose the letters 
of the alphabet, arranged in their normal-frequency 
order, were set off into four groups, as 
follows: 
ETRIN 
OASDLC 
HFUPMYG 
WVBXKQJZ 
Group 1 
Group 2 
Group 3 
Group 4 
(2) Suppose that a letter in group 1 means that one letter will be enciphered; a letter in 
group 
2, that two letters will be enciphered; and so on. 
Suppose, next, that a rather lengthy 
phrase were used as a key, for example, PREPARED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF 
SIGNAL OFFICER FOR USE WITH ARMY EXTENSION COURSES. Suppose, iinal.ly, that each 
letter of the key were used not only to select the particular cipher alphabet to be used, but also 
to control the number of letters to be enciphered by the selected alphabet, according to the 
scheme outlined above. 
Such an enciphering scheme, using the HYDRAULIC. . .XZ primary 
cipher component sliding against the normal plain component, would yield the following 
groupings:

(3) Here it will be seen that any tendency for the formation of lengthy repetitions would 
be counteracted by the short groupings and quick shifting of alphabets. 
The first time the 
word DIVISION occurs it is enciphered as THJGVFXM; the second time it occurs it is enciphered 
as RPRNPCKS . 
Before DIVISION can be twice enciphered by ezuctly the same sequence of key 
letters, an interval of at least 140 letters must intervene between the two occurrences of the 
word (the sum of the values of the letters of the key phrase=l40); 
and then the chances that 
the key letter P would begin the encipherment, of DIV are but one in three. 
Only one of these 
three possible encipherments will yield era&y the same sequence of cipher equivalents the 
second time as was obtained the first time. 
For example, if the text were such as to place two 
occurrences of the word DIVISION in the positions shown below, their encipherments would 
be as follows: 
; Ii; iJ i;;; 
; Ii 
; Ii; ; d;iE 
; ;J 
FIRSTDIVISION... 
. 
. . . . . .DIVISION...

,.. 
. . THJGVFXM... 
. 
. . . . . .THZGTPNb!...

Although the word DIVISION, 
on its second appearance, begins but one letter beyond the place 
where it begins on its first appenrance, the cipher equivalents now agree only in the lirst two 
letters, the fourth, and the last letters. 
Thus: 
(1) 
(2) 
DIVISION 
EJCVFXM 
UZGTPNM 
e. Attention 
is directed to the characteristics of the foregoing two encipherments of the 
same word. 
When they are superimposed, the first two cipher equivalents are the same in the 
two encipherments; t,hen there is a single interval where the cipher equivalents are different; 
the next cipher equivalent is the same; then follow three intervals uitb dissimilar cipher equiva- 
lents; finally, the last cipher equivalent is the same in both cases. The repetitions here extend 
only to one or two letters; longer repetitions can occur only exceptionally. 
The two encipher- 
ments yield only occasional coincidences, that is, places where the cipher letters are identical; 
moreover, the distrib&on 
of the coincidences is quit,e irregular and of an intermittent character. 
f. This phenomenon of intermittent 
coincidences, involving 
coincidences of single letters, 
pairs of letters, or short sequences (rarely ever exceeding pentagraphs) is one of the character- 
istics of this general class of polyelphabetic 
substitution, 
wherein the cryptograms commonly 
manifest what appears to be a disturbed or distorted periodicitp. 
g. From a technical standpoint, 
the cryptographic 
principle upon which the foregoing 
system is based has much merit, but for practical usage it is entirely too slow and too subject 
to error. 
However, if the encipherment were mechanized by machinery, and if the enciphering 
key were quite lengthy, such a system and mechanism becomes of practical importance. 
Cipher 
machines for accomplishing this type of substitution 
will be treated in a subsequent text.

17. Variable-length 
groupings of the keying sequence.-The 
preceding cases deal with 
simple methods of eliminat,ing or avoiding periodicity by enciphering variable-length groupings 
of the plain text, using constant-length keying units. 
In paragraph 2a, however, it was pointed 
out that periodicity 
can also be suppressed by applying variable-length key groupings to con- 
stant-length plain-text groups. 
One such method consists in irregularly 
interrupting the keying 
sequence, if the latter is of a limited or fixed length, and recommencing it (from its initial point) 
after such interruption, 
so that the keying sequence becomes equivalent to a series of keys of 
different lengths. 
Thus, the key phrase BUSINESS MACHINES may be expanded to a series of 
irregular-length 
keying sequences, such as BUSI/BUSINE/BU/BUSINFSSM/BUSINESSMAC, etc. 
Various schemes or prearrangements for indicating 
or determining the interruptions 
may be 
adopted. 
Three methods will be mentioned in the next paragraph. 
18. Methods of interrupting 
a cyclic keying sequence.-a. 
There are many methods of 
interrupting 
a keying sequence which is basically cyclic, and which therefore would give rise 
to periodicity if not interfered with in some way. 
These methods may, however, be classified 
into three categories as regards what happens after the interruption 
occurs: 
(1) The keying sequence merely stops and begins again at the initial point of the cycle. 
(2) One or more of the elements in the keying sequence may be omitted from time to time 
irregularly. 
(3) The keying sequence irregularly 
&ernates 
in its direct,ion of progression, wit.h or 
without omission of some of its elements. 
b. These methods may, for clarity, 
be represented graphically 
as follows. 
Suppose the 
key consists of a cyclic sequence of 10 elements represented symbolically by the series of numbers 
1, 2, 3, . . . , 10. Using an asterisk to indicate an interruption, 
the following may then represent 
the relation between the letter number of the message and the element number of the keying 
sequences in the three types mentioned above:

As regards the third method, which involves only an alternation in the direction of progression 
of the keying sequence, if there were no interruptions 
in the key it would mean merely that a 
lo-element keying sequence, for example, could be treated as though it were an 18-element 
sequence and the matter could then be handled as though it were a special form of the second 
method. 
But if the principles of the second and third method are combined in one system, 
the matter may become quite complex. 
c. If one knows when the interruptions 
take place in each cycle, then successive sections of 
the basic keying cycle in the three cases may be superimposed.

Obviously if one does not know when or how the interruptions 
take place, then the successive 
sections of keying elements cannot be superimposed as indicated above. 
d. The interruption 
of the cyclic keying sequence usually takes place according to some 
prearranged plan, and the three basic methods of interruption 
will be taken up in turn, using 
a short mnemonic key as an example.

e. Suppose the correspondents agree that the interruption 
in the keying sequence will take 
place after the occurrence of a specified letter called an inferruptor,l 
which may be a letter of the 
plain text, or one of the cipher text, as agreed upon in advance. 
Then, since in either case 
there is nothing fixed about the time the interruption 
will occur-it 
will take place at no fixed 
mtervals-not 
only does the interruption 
become quite irregular, following no pattern, but also 
the method never reverts to one having periodicity. 
hlethods of this type will now be discussed 
in detail. 
19. Interruptor 
is a plain-text letter.-u. 
Suppose the correspondents agree that the inter- 
ruption in the key will take place immediately 
after a previously agreed-upon letter, 
say R, 
occur: in the plain text. 
The key would then be interrupted as shown in the following example 
(using the mnemonic key BUSINESS MACHINES and the HYDRAULIC . . . XZ sequenoe):

b. Instead of employing an ordinary plain-text letter as the interruptor, 
one might reserve 
the letter J for this purpose (and use the letter I whenever this letter appears as part of a plain- 
text word). 
This is a quite simple variation of the basic method. 
The letter J acts merely 
as though it were a plain-text letter, except that in this case it also serves as the interruptor. 
The interruptor 
is then inserted ai random, at the whim of the enciphering clerk. 
Thus:

c. It is obvious that repetitions would be plentiful 
in cryptograms of this construction, 
regardless of whether a letter of high, medium, or low frequency is selected as the signal for key 
interruption. 
If a let.ter of bigh frequency is chosen, repetitions will occur quite often, not 
only because that letter will certainly be a part of many common words, but also because it will 
be followed by words that are frequently repeated; and since the key starts again with each 
such interruption, 
these frequently repeated words will be enciphered by the same sequence of 
alphabets. 
This is the case in the first,of the two foregoing examples. 
It is clear, for instance, 
that every time the word ARTILLERY appear in the cryptogram the cipher equivalents 
of 
TILLERY must be the same. If the intarruptor 
letter were AD instead of %, the repetition 
* Al80 tied at times U “influence” 
letter because it influenced or modi& 
normal procedure. 
In some 
caaea no influence or interruptor 
letter ie used, the interruption 
or break in the keying eequence occurring after 
a previously-agreed-upon 
number of lettfsn haa been enciphered.

22 
would include the cipher equivalents of RTILLERY; if it were T,, ILLERY, and so on. 
On the 
other hancl, if a letter of low frequency were selected as the interruptor 
letter, then the encipher- 
ment would tend to approsimate that of normal repeat,ing-key substitution, 
and repetitions 
would be plentiful on that basis alone. 
d. Of coljrse. the lengths of the intervals between the repetitions, in any of the foregoing 
cases, would l,e irregular, so that periodicity 
would not be manifested. 
The student may 
inquire, therefore, how one would proceed to solve such messages, for it is obvious that, an 
attempt to allocate the letters of a single message into separate monoalphabetic distributions 
cannot be successful unless the exact locations of the interruptions 
are known-and 
they do 
not become known to t,he cryptanalyst 
until he has solved the message, or at least a part of it. 
Thus it would appear as though the would-be solver is here confronted with a more or less insoluble 
dilemma. 
This s)rt of reasoning, however, makes more of an appeal to the novice in cryptog- 
raphy thnn to the experienced cryptanalyst, who specializes in methods of solving cryptographic 
dilemmas. 
e. (1) The pro!)lem here will be attacked upon the usual two hypotheses, and the easier 
one \s-ill be disc usqec! first. 
Suppose the system has been in use for some time, that an original 
solution has been reached b- means t.o be discussed under the second hypothesis, and that, the 
cipher alphabets are known. 
There remains unknown only the specific key to messages. Exam- 
ining whatever repetitions are found, an attack is made on the basis of searching for a probable 
word. 
Thus. taking the illustrative 
message in subparagraph a, suppose the presence of the 
word ARTILLERY is suspectell. 
;It:empts 
nre made to locate this word, basing the search 
upon the construction of an intelligible key. 
Beginning with the very first letter of the message, 
the word ARTILLERY is juxtaposed against the cipher test, and the key letters ascertained, 
using the known alphabets, which we will assume in this case are based upon the HYDRAULIC 
. . XZ sequence sliding against the normal. 
Thus: 
Cipher 
~_-..-___ B 0 L Y R P J D R 
Plain __..._ _.__...... .__ A R T I L L E R Y 
“Key” .______._._____.__ 
B H J Q P I B F U 
(2) Since this “key” is certainly not intelligible 
text, the assumed word is moved one letter 
to the right and the test repeated, and so on until the following place in t&e test is reached: 
- Cipher .____....._..._.__ S X D J U P S Y I 
Plain---- .__._____ 
-__-___ A R T I L L E R Y 
Key _________.______ 
--..- S I B U S I N E B 
(3) The seqllence BUSINE suggests BUSINESS; moreover, it is noted that the key is in- 
terrupted both times by the letter R,. 
Now the key may be applied to the beginning of the 
messace, to see if the whole key or only a portion of it has been recovered. 
Thus: 
Key ___..__.... _________ 
B U S I N E S S B U S 
Cipher .__________ 
_ ______ B 0 L Y R P J D R 0 J 
Plain- ___________________ 
A M M U N I T I U M T 
(4) It is obvious that BUSINESS is only a part of Lhe key. 
But the deciphered sequence 
certainly 
seems to be the word AMMUNITION. 
When this is tried, the key is extended to 
BUSINESS MA. . . 
. 
Enough has been shown to clarify the procedure.

f. The foregoing solution is predicated upon the hypothesis that the cipher alphabetv are 
knoun. 
But what if this is not the case? What of the steps necessary to arrive at the -first 
solution, before even the presence of an interrupccr is suspected? The answer to this question 
leads to the presentation of a method of attack which is one of the most important and powerful 
means the crypt,analpst has at his command for unraveling many knotty problems. 
It is called 
solution 
by superimposition, 
and warrants detailed treatment,. 
20. Solution by superimposition.- 
a. Basig 
principles. 
-- 
(1) 
In solving 
an ordinary 
repeating-key cipher the firs: step, that of ascertaining the length of the period, is of no signifi- 
cance in itself. 
It merely paves the way for and makes possible the second step, which consists 
in allocating the letters of the cryptogram into individual 
monoalphabetic dist’ributions. 
The 
third step then consists in solving these distributions. 
Usually, the text of the message is trans- 
cribed into its periods and is written out in successive lines corresponding in length with that 
of the period. 
The diagram then consists of a series of columns of letters and the letters in each 
column belong to the same monoalphabet. 
Another way of looking at the matter is to conceive 
of the text as having thus been transcribed into superimposed periods: in such case the letters in 
each column have undergone the same kind of treatment by the same elements (plain and cipher 
components of the cipher alphabet). 
(2) Suppose, however, that the repetitive key is very long and that the message is short, so 
that there are only a very few cycles in the text. 
Then the solution of the message becomes 
difficult, if not impossible, because there is not a sufficient number of superimposable periods to 
yield monoalphabetic distributions 
which can be solved by frequency principles. 
But suppose 
also that there are many short cryptograms all enciphered by the same key. 
Then it is clear 
that if these messages are superimposed: 
(a) The letters in the respective columns will all belong to individual 
alphabets; and 
(b) If there is a sufficient number of such superimposable messages (say 25-30, for English), 
then the frequency distributions 
applicable to the successive columns of text can be solved- 
without knowing the length of the key. 
In other words, any difficulties that may have arisen on 
account of failure or inability 
to ascertain the length of the period have been circumvented. 
The second step in normal solution is thus “by-passed.” 
(3) Furthermore, and this is a very important point, in case an extremely long key is em- 
ployed and a series of messages beginning at different initial pointsare enciphered by such a key, 
this method of solution by superimposition can be employed, provided the messages can be super- 
imposed correctly, that is, so that the letters which fall in one column really belong to one cipher 
alphabet. 
Just how this can be done will be demonstrated in subsequent paragraphs, but a 
clue has already been given in paragraph 1%. At this point, however, a simple illustration 
of 
the method wiIl be given, using the substitution 
system discussed in paragraph 19. 
b. Example.-(l) 
A set of 35 messages has been intercepted on the same day. 
Presumablp 
they are all in the same key, and the presence of repetitions betm-een messages corroborates this 
assumption. 
But the intervals between repetitions wit.hin the same message do not show any 
common factor and the messages appear to be aperiodic in nature. 
The probable-word method 
has been applied, using standard alphabets, with no success. The messages are then super- 
imposed (Fig. 5) ; the frequency distributions for the first 10 columns are as shown in Figure 6.

(2) The 1st and 2d distribut.ions are certainly monoalphabetic. 
There are very marked 
crests and troughs, and the number of blanks (14) is more than satisfactory in both cases. (Let 
the student at this point refer to Par. 14 and Chart 5 of Military 
Cryptanalysis, Part I.) 
But 
the 3d, 4th, and remaining distributions 
appear no longer to be monoalphabetic. 
Note particu- 
larly the distribution 
for the 6th column. 
From this fact the conclusion is drawn that some 
disturbance in periodicity has been introduced in the cryptograms. 
In other words, although 
they all start out with the same alphabet, some sort of interruption 
takes place so as to suppress 
periodicity. 
(3) However, a start on solution may be made by attacking the first tw-o distributions, 
frequency studies being aided by considerations based upon probable words. 
In this case, since 
the text comprises only the be ,mgs 
of messages, assumptions for probable words are more 
easily made than when words are sought in the interiors of messages. Such common intro- 
ductory words as REQUEST, REFER, ENEMY, WHAT, WHEN, IN, 
SEND, etc., are good ones 
to assume. Furthermore, 
high-frequency 
digraphs used as the initial 
digraphs of common 
words will, of course, manifest themselves in the first two columns. 
Tine greatest aid in this 
process is, as usual, a familiarity 
with the “word habits” of the enemy. 
(4) Let the student try to solve the messages. In so doing he will more or less quickly find 
the cause of the rapid falling off in monoalphabeticity 
as the columns progress to the right from 
the initial point of the messages. 
21. Interruptor 
is a cipher-text letter.--a. 
In the preceding case a plain-test letter serves 
as the interruptor. 
But now suppose the correspondents agree that the interruption 
in the key 
will take place immediately after a previously-weed-upon 
letter, say Q, occurs in the cipher 
text. 
The key would then-be interrupted 
as shown in the following edample:

b. In the foregoing example, there are no significant repetitions. 
Such as do occur comprise 
only digraphs, one of which is purely accidental. 
But the absence of sign&ant, 
long repetitions 
is itself purely accidental; for had the interruptor 
letter been a letter other than Q,, then the 
phrase AMMUNITION FOR, which occurs twice, might have been enciphered identically 
both

times. 
If a short key is employed, repetitions may be plentiful. 
For example, note the fol- 
lowing, in which S, is the interruptor 
letter: 
Key .___....._......_____ B A N D S B A N D S B A N D S B A N D S B A N B A N D S B A N D S B

c. This last example gives a clue to one method of attacking this t.ype of system. 
There 
will be repetitions within short sections, and the interval between them will sometimes permit 
of ascertaining the length of the keg. 
In such short sections, the letters which intervene between 
the repeated sequences may be eliminated as possible interruptor 
letters. 
Thus, the letters 
A, C, B, and N may be eliminated, in the foregoing example, as interruptor 
letters. 
By extension 
of &is principle to the letters intervening 
between other repetitions, one may more or less 
quickly ascertain what letter serves as the interruptor. 
d. Onre the interruptor 
letter has been found, the next step is to break up the message 
into “uninterrupted” 
sequences and then attempt a solution by superimposition. 
The prin- 
ciples explained in paragraph 20 need only be modified in minor respects. In the first place, in 
this case the columns of text fcrmed by the superimposition of uninterrupted 
sequences will 
be purely monoalphabetic, whereas in the case of the example in paragraph 20, only the very 
first column is purely monoalphabetic, the monoalphabeticity 
falling off very rapidly with the 
2d, 3d, . . . columns. 
Hence, in this case the analysis of the individual 
alphabets should be 
an easier task. 
But this would be counterbalanced by the fact that whereas in the former case 
the cryptanalyst, is dealing with the initial words of messages, in this case he is dealing with 
interior portions of the text and h&no way of knowing where a word begins. 
The latter remarks 
naturally do not apply to the case where a whole set, of messages in this system, 
all in the same 
key, can be subjected to simultaneous study. 
In such a case the cryptanalyst would also have 
the initial words to work upon. 
22. Concluding remarks.--a. 
The preceding two paragraphs both deal with the first and 
simplest of the three basic cases referred to under paragraph 18. The second of those cases 
involves considerably more work in solution for the reason that when the interruption 
takes 
place and t,he keying sequence recommences, the latter is not invariably 
the initial point of the 
sequence, as in the first case. 
b. In the second of those cases the interruptor 
causes a break in the keying se,quence and 
a recommencement at any one of the 10 keying elements. 
Consequently, it is impossible now 
merely to superimpose sections of the text by shifting them so that their initial letters fall in 
the same column. 
But a superimposition is nevertheless possible, provided the interruptions 
do not occur so frequently 2 that sections of only a very few letters are enciphered by sequent 
keyletters. 
In order to accomplish a proper superimposition 
in this case, a statistical test 
is essential, and for this a good many letters are required. 
The nature of this test will be 
explained in Section XI. 
c. The same thing is true of the last of the three cases mentioned under paragraph 18. 
The solut,ion of a case of this sort is admittedly a rather difficult matter which will be taken up 
in its proper place later. 
d. (1) In the cases thus far studied, either the plain-text groupings were variable in length 
and were enciphered by a constant-length 
key, or the plain-text 
groupings were constant in 
2 When no inierruptor 
or “influence letter” 
is used, the ir#erruption 
or break in the keying sequence occurs 
after the encipherment 
of a definite number of letters. 
Once this number has been ascertained, solution of 
subsequent messages is very simple.

length and R-ere enciphered by a variable-length key. 
It is possible, however, to combine both 
principles and to apply a variable-length key to variable-length groupings of the plain text, 
(2) Suppose the correspondents agree to encipher a message according to word lengths, but 
at irregular intervals, to add at the end of a word an interruptor 
letter which will serve to inter- 
rupt the key. 
Note the following, in which the key is BUSINESS MACHINES and the interruptor 
letter is X:

(3) The foregoing system is only a minor modification of the simple case of ordinary word 
length encipherment as explained in Section II. 
If standard cipher alphabets are used, the 
spasmodic interruption 
and the presence of the interruptor 
letter would cause no difficulty 
whatever, since the solution can be achieved mechanically, by completing the plain-component 
sequence. If mixed cipher alphabets are used, and the primary components are unknown, 
solution may be reached by following the procedure outlined in Sections II and III, 
with such 
modifications as are suitable to the case. 
e. It is hardly necessary to point out that, the foregoing types of aperiodic substitution 
are 
rather unsuitable for practicai military usage. Encipherment is slow and subject to error. 
In 
some cases encipherment can be accomplished only by single-letter 
operation. 
For if the 
interruptor is a cipher letter the key is interrupted by a letter which cannot be known in advance; 
if the interruptor 
is a plain-text letter, while the interruptions 
can be indicated before encipher- 
ment is begun, the irregularities occasioned by the interruptions 
in keying cause confusion and 
quite materially 
retard the enciphering process. In deciphering, the rate of speed wol!ld be 
just as slow in either method. 
It is obvious that one of the principal disadvantages in all these 
methods is that if an error in transmission is made, if some letters are omitted, or if anything 
happens to the interruptor 
letter, the message becomes difficult or impossible to derryptograph 
by the ordinary code clerk. 
Finally, the degree of cryptographic security attainable by most 
of these methods is not sufficient for military purposes.

REVIEW 
OF AUTO-KEY 
SYSTE?vlS 
The two basic methods of auto-key encipherment ______________________ - ____________________________ 
23 
23. The two basic methods of auto-key encipherment.--a. 
In auto-key encipherment there 
are two possible sources for successive key letters: the plain text or the cipher text of the message 
itself. 
In either case, the initial key letter or key letters are supplied by preagreement between 
the correspondents; after that the text letters that are to serve as the key are displaced 1, 2, 3, 
. . . intervals to the right, depending upon the length of the prearranged key. 
b. (1) dn example of plain-text keying will 6rst be shown, to refresh the student’s recollec- 
tion. 
Let the previously agreed upon key consist of a single letter, say X, and let the cipher 
alphabets be direct, standard alphabets. 
Key _____________________ 
X N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M A S T E R . .

N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M-A S T E R . . . 
Cipher __________________ 
K B H B N D 0 K U R K X V D M S L X V . . . 
(2) Instead of having a single letter serve as the initial key, a word or even a long phrase 
may be used. Thus (using TYPEWRITER as the initial key): 
Key _____________________ 
T Y P E W R I T E RI N 0 T I F Y Q U A R . .

N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M A S T E R . . . 
Cipher __________________ 
G M I M B P Y N E I G S K U F Q J Y R . . . 
c. (1) In cipher text auto keying the procedure is quite similar. 
If a single initial key letter 
is used: 
Kc- _____________________ 
Xl K Y R Z E C S M M D W A R D D V 0 S . . . 
Plain ___________________ 
N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M A S T E R . . . 
Cipher __________________ 
K Y R Z E C S M M D W A R D D V 0 S J . . . 
(2) If a key word is used: 
Key _____________________ 
T Y P E W R I T E R] G M I M B P Y N E I 
. . 
Plain ___________________ 
N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M A S T E R . . . 
Cipher __________________ 
G M I M B P Y N E I Z Q Z Y B H R R V . . . 
(3) Sometimes only the last cipher letter resulting from the use of the prearranged key 
word is used as the key letter for enciphering the auto-keyed portion of the text. 
Thus, in the 
last esample, the plain text beginning TEPMASTER would be enciphered as follows: 
Key _____________________ 
T Y P E W R I T E RI I B F W I I A T X . . . 
Plain ___________________ 
N 0 T I F Y Q U A R T E R M A S T E R . . .

d. In the foregoing examples, direct standard alphabets are employed; but mixed alphabets, 
either interrelated or independent, may be used just as readily. 
Also, instead of the ordinary 
type of cipher alphabets, one may employ a mathematical process of addition (see par. 40j of 
Special Text Ko. 166, Advanced Military 
Cryptography) 
but the difference between the latter 
process and the ordinary one using sliding alphabets is more apparent than real. 
e. Since the analysis of the case in which the cipher text constitutes the auto key is usually 
easier than that in which the plain text serves this function, the former will be the first to be 
discussed.

24. Solution of cipher-text auto-keyed cryptograms when known alphabets are employed.- 
a. (1) First of all it is to be noted that if the cryptanalyst 
knows the cipher alphabets which 
were employed in encipherment, the solution presents hardly any problem at all. 
It is only 
necessary to decipher the message beyond the key letter or key-word portion and the initial part 
of the plain text enciphered by this key letter or key word can be f?lled in from the context. 
An example, using standard cipher alphabets, follows herewith: 
CRYPTOGRAM 
WSGQV 
OHVMQ 
WEQUH 
AALNB 
NZZMP 
ESKD 
(2) writing 
the cipher text as key letters (displaced one interval to the right) and deciphering 
by direct standard alphabets yields the following: 
Key--- _._ ___ 
___ _ _ 
WSGQVOHVMQWEQUHAALNBNZZMPESK 
Cipher ___________ 
W S G Q V 0 H V M Q W E Q U H A A L N B N Z Z M P E S K D 
Plain _____________ 
WOKFTTOREGIMENTALCOMMANDPOST 
(3) Trial of the word REPORT as the initial word of the message yields an intelligible word 
as the initial key: FORCE, so that the message reads: 
Key _____________________ 
F 0 R C E V 0 H V M Q . . 
Cipher __________________ 
W S G Q V 0 H V M Q . . . 
Plain ____________________ 
R E P 0 R T T 0 R E . . . 
(4) A semiautomatic met,hod of solving such a message is to use sliding normal alphabets 
and align the strips so that, as one progresses from left to right, each cipher letter is set opposite 
the letter A on the preceding strip. 
Taking the letters VMQWEQUHA 
in the foregoing example, 
note in Figure 7 the series of placements of the successive strips. 
Then not.e how the successive 
plain-text 
letters of the word REGIMENT reappear to the left of the successive cipher letters

b. If, as a result of the analysis of several messages (as described in par. 25), mixed 
primary components have been reconstructed, the soIution of subsequent messages may readily 
be accomplished by following t,he procedure outlined in a above, since in that case the cipher 
alphabets have become known alphabets. 
25. General principles 
und’erlying solution 
of cipher-text 
auto-keyed 
cryptograms 
by 
frequency analysis-o. 
First of all, it is to be noted in connection with cipher-text auto-keying 
that repetitions will not be nearly as plentiful in the cipher text as they are in the plain text, 
because in this system before a repetition can appear two things must happen simultaneously. 
First, of course, the plain-text sequence must be repeated, and second, one or more cipher-text 
letters (depending upon the length of the introductory key) immediately before the second appear- 
ance of the plain-text repetition must be identical with one or more cipher-text letters immediately 
before the first appearance of the group. 
This can happen only as the result of chance. In 
the following example the introductory 
key is a single letter, X, and d&t 
standard components 
are used in the usual Vigenere manner: 
Key _______ 
_ __ _ _______ 
XCKBTMDHNVHLY....KDKSJMDHNVHLY 
Plain _________________

Cipher _______________

The repeated plain-text word, REGIMENT, has only 8 letters but the repeated cipher-text group 
contains 9, of which only the last 8 letters actually represent the plain-text 
repetition. 
In 
order that the word REGIMENT be enciphered by D H N V H L Y R the second time this 
word appeared in the test it was necessary that the key letter for its first letter, R, be M both 
times; no other key letter will produce the same cipher sequence for the word REGIMENT in this 
case. Each different key letter for enciphering the first letter of REGIMENT will produce a 
different encipherment for the word, so that the chances 1 for a repetition in this case are roughly 
about 1 in 26. This is the principal cause for the reduction in repetitions in this system. 
If 
an introductory 
key of two letters were used, it would be necessary that the two cipher letters 
immediately before the second appearance of the repeated word REGIMENT be identical with 
the two cipher letters immediately before the first appearance of the word. 
In general, then, 
an n-letter repetition in the cipher text, in this case, represents an (n-k)-letter 
repetition in the 
plain text, where n is the length of the cipher-text repetition and k is the length of the introductory 
key. 
b. There is a second phenomenon of interest in connection with the cipher-text auto-key 
method. 
Let the letter opposite which the key letter is placed (when using sliding components 
for encipherment) be termed, for convenience in reference, “the base letter.” 
normally 
the 
base let,ter is the initial letter of the plain component, but it has been seen in preceding tests 
that this is only a convention. 
Kow when the introductory 
key is a single letter, if the base 
letter occurs as a plain-text 
letter its cipher equivalent is identical with the immediately pre- 
ceding cipher letter; that is, there is produced a double letter in the cipher text, no matter what 
the cjpher component is and no matter what the key letter happens to be for that encipherment. 
For example, using the H Y D R A U L I C . . . X Z sequence for both primary 
com- 
ponents, with H, the initial 
letter of the plain component as the base letter, and using the 
introductory 
key letter X, the following encipherment is produced: 
Key ________________________ 
XJOIIFLYUTTDKKYCXG 
Plain ______________________ 
M A N H A T T A N H I G H J I N K S 
Cipher ____________________ 
J 0 5 
F L Y U TT 
D KK 
Y C X G L 
Note the doublets II, TT, KK. Each time such a doublet occurs it means that the second letter 
represents H,, which is the base letter in this case (initial letter of plain.component). 
xow if 
the base letter happens to be a high-frequency letter in normal plain text, for example the letter 
E, or T, then the cipher text will show a large number of doublets; if it happens to be a low-fre- 
quency letter the cipher text will show very few doublets. 
In fact, the number of doublets 
will be directly proportional 
to the frequency of the base letter in normal plain text. 
Thus, 
if the cryptogram contains 1,000 letters t,here should be about 72 occurrences of doublets if 
the base letter is A, since in 1,000 letters of plain text there should be about 72 A’s. Conversely, 
if a cryptogram of 1,000 letters shows about 72 doublets, the base letter is likely to be A; if it 
shows about 90, it is likely to be T, and so on. 
Furthermore when a clue to the identity of the 
base letter has been obtained in this manner, it is possible immediately to insert the corresponding 
plain-text 
letter througho?!t the text of the message. The distribution 
of this letter may not 
only serve as a check (if no inconsistencies develop) but also may lead to the assumption of 
values for other cipher letters. 
c. When the introductory 
key is 2 letters, then this same phenomenon will produce groups 
of the formula ABA, where A and B may be any letters, but the first and third must be identical. 
The occurrence of patterns of this type in this case indicates the encipherment of the base lett.er. 
1 If all the cipher letters appeared with equal frequency the chances would be exactly 1 in 26. 
But certain 
letters appear with greater frequency because some plain-text 
letters are much more frequent than others.

d. The phenomena noted above can be used to considerable advantage in the solution of 
cryptograms of this type. 
For instance, if it is hewn 
that the ordinary Vigenere method of 
encipherment is used (0, ,? = 6, ,1 ; 0pll=0e12), then the initial letter of the plain component is 
the base letter. 
If, further, it is known that the plain component is the normal direct sequence, 
then the base letter is A and a word such as BATTALION 4l 
be enciphered by a group having 
the formula AABCCDEFG. 
-- 
If the plain component is a mixed sequence and happens to start 
with the letter E, then a word such as ENmY would be enciphered by a sequence having the 
formula @JCD.2 
Sequences such as these are, of course, idiomorphic and if words yielding 
such idiomorphisms are frequent in the text there will be produced in the latter several or many 
cases of isomorphism. 
When these are analyzed by the principles of indirect symmetry of 
position, a quick solution may follow. 
e. A final principle underlying the solution of cipher-text auto-keyed cryptograms remains 
to be discussed. It concerns the nature of the frequency distributions required for the analysis 
of such cryptograms. 
This principle will be set, forth in the next paragraph. 
26. Frequency distributions 
required 
for solutiom-u. 
Consider the message given in 
paragraph 23c (1). 
It happens thnt the letter R, occurs twice in this short message and, because 
of the nature of the cipher-text auto-keving method, this letter must also appear twice in the 
key. 
Kow it is obvious that all plain-text letters enciphered by key lett,er Rh will be in the same 
cipher alphabet; in other words, if the key text is “offset” one letter to the right of the cipher 
text, then every cipher letter which immediately follows an R, in the cryptogram will belong to the 
same cipher alphabet, and this alphabet may be designated conveniently as the R cipher alphabet. 
Now if there were sufhcient text, so t,hat there were, say, 30 t’o 40 RO’s in it, then a frequency 
distribution 
of the letters immediately 
following 
the Rc’s will 
exhibit 
monoalphabeticity. 
Vi%at has been said of the letters following the Rc’s applies equally well to the letters following 
all the other letters of the cipher text, the AC’s, Be’s, Cc’s, and so 0x1. In short, if 26 distributions 
are made, one for each letter of the alphabet, showing the cipher letter immediately succeeding 
each different letter of the cipher text, then the text of the cryptogram can be allocated into 26 
uniliteral, 
monoalphabetic frequency distributions 
which can be solved by frequency analysis, 
providing there are sufficient data for this purpose. 
b. The foregoing principle has been described as pertaining to the case when the introductory 
key is a single letter, that is, when the key text is “offset” or displaced but one interval to the 
right, of the cipher text. 
But it applies equally to cases wherein the key text is offset more than 
one interval, provided the frequency distributions 
are based upon the proper interval, as deter- 
mined by the displacement due to the length of the introductory 
key. 
For instance, suppose 
the introductory 
key consists of two letters, as in the following example: 
Key text _______________ 
-_ UIMRHFHGFNQRXOMRMVWEE 
Plain text ________________ 
RELIABLEINFORMATION.. 
Cipher text ______________ 
MRHFHGFNQRXOMRMVWEE.. 
The key text in this case is offset two intervals to the right of the cipher text and, therefore, fre- 
quency distributions 
made by taking the cipher letters one interval to the right of a given cipher 
letter, each time that lett,er occurs, will not be monoalphabetic because some letter not related 
at all to the given cipher letter is the key letter for enciphering the letter one interval to the 
right of the latter. 
For example, note the three R,‘s in the foregoing illustration. 
The first 
R, is followed by H,, representing the encipherment of L, by Mr; the second R, is followed by X,, 
representing the encipherment of FD by Qr; the third R, is followed by M,, representing the en- 
cipherment of A, by M&. The three cipher letters H, X, and M are here entirely unrelated and do 
1 Six letters are shown because the idiomcrphism 
in this case extends over that many letters.

34 
not belong to the same cipher alphabet because they represent encipherments by three diffrrcnt 
key letters. 
On the other band, the cipher letters two intervals to the right of the Rl’s, viz, 
F, 0, and V, are in the same cipher alphabet because these cipher letters are the results of en- 
ciphering plain-text letters I, 0, and T, respectively, by the same key letter, R. It is obvious, 
then, that when the introductory 
key consists of two letters and the key test is displaced two 
intervals to the right of the cipher text, the proper frequency distributions for mononlphabeticitp 
will be based upon the letter at the second interval to the right of each cipher letter. 
Likewise, 
if the introductory 
key consists of three letters and the key text is displaced three intervals to 
the right of the cipher text, the distributions 
must be based upon the third interval, and so on! 
in each case the interval used correspondin g to t.he amount of displacement between key text 
and cipher text. 
c. Conversely, in solving a problem of this type, when the length of the introductory 
key 
and therefore the amount of displacement are not known, the a.ppearance of the frequency dis- 
tributions 
based upon various intervals after each different cipher letter will disclose this un- 
known factor, since only one set of distributions will exhibit monoalphabeticity 
and the interval 
corresponding to that set will be the correct interval. 
d. Application of these principles will now be made, using a specific example. 
27. Example of solution by frequency analysis.--a. 
It will be assumed that previous studies 
have disclosed that the enemy is using the cipher-text auto-key system described. 
It will be 
further assumed that these studies have also disclosed t,hat (1) the introductory 
key is usually a 
single letter, (2) the usual Vigenbre method of employing sliding primary components is used, 
(3) the plain component is usually the normal direct sequence, the cipher component a mixed 
sequence which changes daily.

b. A distribution 
table of the type described in paragraph 256 is compiled and is shown as 
Figure 8 below. 
In making these distributions 
it is simple to insert a tally in the appropriate 
cell in the pertinent horizontal line of the table, to indicate the cipher letter which immediately 
follows each occurrence of the letter to which that line applies. 
Obviously, the best method of 
compiling the data is to handle the text digraphicnlly, 
taking the first and second letters, the 
second and third, the third and fourth, and so on, and distributing 
the final letters of the digraphs 
in a quadricular table. 
The distribution 
merely takes the form of tally marks, the fiffth being a 
diagonal stroke so as to totalize the occurrences visibly.

8. 
The individual 
frequency distributions 
give every appearance of being‘monoalphabetic, 
which checks the assumption that the enemy is still employing the same system. 
The total 
number of letters of text (excluding the final X’s) is 680. If the base letter is A then there should 
be approximately 
680X7.2%=49 
cases of double letters in the text. 
There are actually 52 
such cases, which checks quite well with expectancy. 
The letter A is substituted throughout 
the text for the second letter of each doublet. 
d. The following sequence is noted: 
Message V, line l_________ 
G I S U H

Assume that the sequence DDHOOVNBT represents BATTALION. Then the frequency of H, in the 
D cipher alphabet should be high, since H,=T,. 
The H has only 2 occurrences. 
Likewise, the 
frequency of 0, in the H alphabet (=T,) should be high; it is also only 2. The frequency of V 
in the 0 alphabet should be medium or low, since it would equal L,; it is 5, which is too high. 
The rest of the letters of the assumed word are simil~ly 
checked against the appropriate fre- 
quency distributions, 
with the result that, on the whole, the assumption that the DDHOOVNBT

sequence represents BATTALION does not appear to be warranted. 
Similar attempts are made 
at other points in the text, with the same or other probable words. 
Some of these attempts 
may hare to be carried to the point where the placement of values in the tenktire 
cipher com- 
ponent leads to serious inconsistencies. 
Finally, attention is fixed upon the following sequence:

The assumption cannot be discarded just yet. 
Let the values derivable from the assumption 
be inserted in their proper places in a cipher component, and, using the latter in conjunction 
with a normal direct sequence as the plain component, let an attempt be made to find corrobora- 
tion for these values. 
The following placements may be made:

M 
F G 
UN 
T 
The letter M, appears twice in the cipher sequence and when this partinlly reconstructed cipher 
component is tested it is found that the value L,(N,)=M, 
is corroborated. 
Having the letters 
M, F, G, U, N, and T tentatively 
placed in the cipher component, it is possible to insert certain 
plain-text values in the text. 
For example, in the M alphabet, Fc==DD, G,=&, 
Uc=Op, N,-P,, 
T,=V,. 
In the F alphabet, Go=Bp, U,=L,, 
Nc=Mp, T,=S,, 
M,=X,. 
The other letters yield 
additional 
values in the appropriate 
alphabets. 
The plain-text 
values thus obtainable are 
inserted in the cipher text. 
No inconsistencies appear and, moreover, certain “good” digraphs 
are brought to light. 
For instance, note what happens here:

Now if the letter H can be placed in the cipher component, several values might be added to this 
partial decipherment. 
Noting that F and G are sequent in the cipher component, suppose H 
follows G therein. 
Then the following is obtained:

e. In the foregoing example the plain component was the normal direct sequence, so that 
with the 1~igenPre method of encipherment the base letter is A. If the plain component is a 
mixed sequence, the base letter may no longer be A, but in accordance with the principle set 
forth in paragraph 23, the frequency- of doublets in the cipher t,ext w-ill correspond with the 
frequent\- of the base letter as a lettw of normal plein test. 
If a good clue as to the identity 
of this letter is afforded by the frequency of doublets in the cipher text, the insertion of the 
corresponding base letter in the plain test, will lead to further clues. The solution from there 
on can be handled along the lines indicated above. 
28. Example of solution by analysis of isomorphisms.--a. 
It u-as stated in paragraph 23

d. However, before becoming discouraged too quickly, a search is made throughout 
the 
text to see if any isomorphs are present. 
Fortunately 
there appear to be several of them. 
Note the following:

First, it is necessary to delimit the length of the isomorphs. 
Isomorph (2) shows that the iso- 
morphism begins with the doubled letters. 
For there is an E before the V V in that case and also 
an E within the isomorph; if the phenomenon included the E, then the letter immediately before 
the D D in the case of isomorph (1) would have to be an N, to match its homolog, E, in isomorph 
(2), which it is not. 
Corroborating data are given by isomorphs (3), (4), and (5) in this respect. 
Hence, we may take it as established that the isomorphism begins with the doubled letters.

As for the end of the isomorphism, the fact that isomorphs (2) and (5’1 are the same for 10 letters 
seems to indicate that that is the length of the isomorphism. 
The fact that message 2 ends 2 
letter.. after the last “tie-in” 
letter, Z, corroborates this assumption. 
It is at least certain that 
the isomorphism does not extend beyond 11 letters because the recurrence of R in isomorph (5) 
is not matched by the recurrence of R in isomorph (2), nor by the recurrence of T in isomorph (3). 
Hence it may be assumed that the isomorphic sequence is probably 10 letters in length, possibly 
11. But to be on safe ground it is best to proceed on the lo-letter basis. 
e. Applying 
the principles of indirect symmetry to the superimposed isomorphs, partial 
chains of equivalents may be constructed and it happens in this case that practically the entire 
primary component may be established. 
Let the student confirm the fact that the following 
sequence may be derived from the data given:

The only missing letters are A, C, H, h!, P, and Y. By use of the nearly complete sequence on the 
text it will be possible to place these 6 letters in their positions in the cipher component. 
Or, if a 
keyword-mixed sequence is suspected, then the sequence which was reconstructed may be merely 
a decimation of the original primary sequence. By testing the partial sequence for various 
intervals, when the seventh is selected the following result is obtained:

The sequence is obviously based on the keyword HYDRAULIC, and the complete primary cipher 
component is now available. 
The plain component is then to be reconstructed. 
A word must 
be assumed in the text. 
j. A good probable word to assume for the lo-letter repetition found in messages 1 and 3 
is ARTILLERY. 
This single assumption is sticient 
to place 7 letters in the plain component. 
Thus:

It is obvious that an introductory 
key of more than one letter was used, since the first few letters 
yield unint,elligible text; but it also appears that t,he last cipher letter of the introductory 
key 
u-as used as the introductory 
key letter for enciphering the subsequent auto-keyed portion of 
the text (see par. 23c(3)). 
However, assuming that t.he IVE before the word FIRE is the ending 
of the first word of the plain text, and that this word is INTENSIVE, the introductory 
key word 
is found to be WICKER. Thus:

g. The example solved in the foregoing subparagraphs offers an important 
lesson to the 
student, insofar as it teaches him that he should not immediately feel discouraged when con-fronted 
with a problem presenting 
only a small quantity 
of text and therefore affording 
what seems at first 
glance to be an insuficient 
quantity 
of data for solution. 
For in this example, while it is true that 
there are insufficient data for analysis by simple principles of frequency, it turned out that 
solution ws 
achieved without 
any recourse to the principles 
of frequency 
oj occuvence. 
Here, 
then, is one of those interesting cases of substitution 
ciphers of rather complex construction 
which are solvable without any study whatsoever of frequency distributions. 
Indeed, it will 
be found to be true that in more than a few instances the solution of quite complicated cipher 
systems mny be accomplished not, by the application of the principles of frequency, but by 
recourse to inductive 
and deductive reasoning based upon other considerations, even though 
the latter may often appear to be very tenuous and to rest upon quite flimsy supports. 
29. Special case of solution of cipher-text auto-keyed cryptograms-u. 
Two messages with 
identical plain tests enciphered according to the method of paragraph 23 c (3) by initial key 
words of different lengths and compositions can be solved very rapidly by reconstructing the 
primary components. 
The cryptographic 
tezts of such messages will be isomorphic ajter the initial 
key-word portions.

tween the two cryptograms is obvious nfter their 6th letters:

By intorpolat,ion, these partial sequences may be united into the key-word sequence: 
HYDRAULICBEFGJKMNOPQSTVWXZ 
b. The initial 
key words and the plain texts may now be ascertnined quite easily by 
deciphc ring the messages, using this primary component slid against itself. 
It will be found that 
the initial key word for the 1st message is PENCE, that for the 2d is LATERAL. The reason that 
the cryptographic texts are isomorphic beyond the initial key word portions is, of course, that 
since the text beyond the key word is enciphered auto-key fashion by the preceding cipher letter 
the letters before the last letter of the key have no effect upon the encipherment at all. 
Hence 
two messages of identical text cannot be other than isomorphic after the initial key-word portions. 
c. The foregoing solution affords a clue to the solution of cases in which the texts of two 
or more messages are not completely identical but are in part ident.ical because they happen to 
have similar begiigs 
or endings, or contain nearly similar information or instructions. 
The 
progress in such cases is not so rapid as in the case of messages with wholly identical texts because 
much care must be esercised in blocking out the isomorphic sequences upon which the recon- 
struction of the primary components will be based. 
d. (1) In the foregoing cases, the primary components used to encipher the illustrative 
messages were identical 
mixed sequences. If nonidentical 
components are employed, the 
cryptograms present an interesting case for the application 
of a principle pointed out in a 
preceding text.’ 
(2) Suppose that the three messages of paragraph 27b had been enciphered by using a 
plain component different 
from the mixed component. 
The encipherments of the word 
ARTILLERY would still yield isomorphic sequences, from which, as has hen noted, the recon- 
struction of the cipher component can be accomplished. 
(3) Having reconstructed the cipher component (or an equivalent) 
the latter may be 
applied to the cipher text and a “decipherment” 
obtained. 
In this process any sequence of 26 
letters may be used as the plain component and even the normal sequence A . . . Z may be 
employed for this purpose. 
The word decipherment in the next to the last sentence is enclosed 
by quotation marks because the letters thus obtained would not yield plain text, since the real 
or an equivalent plain component has not yet been found. 
Such “deciphered” 
text may be 
termed spurious plain text. 
But the important 
thing to note is that this text is now monoalphabetic 
and may be solved by the simple procedure usually 
employed in solving a monoalphabetic 
cipher 
produced by a single mired alphabet. 
Thus, a polyalphabetic cipher may be converted to mono- 
alphabetic terms and the problem much simplified. 
In other words, here is another example 
of the situations in which the principle of conversion into monoalphabetic terms may be applied 
with gratifying 
success. It is also an example of the dictum that the use of two differently 
mixed primary components does not really give much more security than does a mixed component 
sliding against itself or against the normal sequence.

e. (1) If the auto-key method shown in paragraph 23~ (2) had been employed in enciphering

To

30. Preliminary remarks on plain-text auto-keying.--a. 
If the cipher alphabets are unknown 
sequences, plain-text 
auto-keying gives rise to cryptograms of more intricate character than 
does cipher-text auto-keying, as has already been stated. 
As a cryptographic 
principle it is 
very commonly encountered as a new and remarkable “invention” 
of tyros in the cryptographic 
art. 
It apparently gives rise to the type of reasoning to which attention has been directed 
once before and tc-hich was then shown to be a popular delusion of the uninitiated. 
The novice 
to whom the auto-key principle comes as a brilliant flash of the imagination sees only the apparent 
impossibility 
of penetrating a secret which enfolds another secret. His reasoning runs about 
as follows: “In order to read the cryptogram, the would-be solver must, of course, fl.rst know 
the key; but the key does not become known to the would-be solver until he has read the crypto- 
gram and has thus found the plain text. 
Since this is reasoning around a circle, the system is 
indecipherable.” 
How unwarranted such reasoning really is in this case, and how readily the 
problem is solved, will be demonstrated in the next few paragraphs. 
b. A consideration of the mechanics of t.he plain-text 
auto-key method discloses that a 
repetition of n letters in the plain text will produce a repetition of (n-k) 
letters in the cipher 
text, where n represents the length of the repetition and k the length of the introductory 
key. 
Therefore, when the introductory 
key consists of a single letter there will be as many repetitions 
in the cipher text as there are in the plain text, except for true digraphic repetitions, which of 
course disappear. 
But on the other hand some “accidental” 
digraphic repetitions are to be 
fairly expected, since it can happen that two Merent 
plain-text pairs, enciphered by different 
key letters, will produce identical cipher equivalents. 
Such accidental repetitions will happen 
less frequently, of course, in the case of longer polygraphs, so that when repetitions of 4 or more 
letters are found in the cipher text they may be taken to be true or causal repetitions. 
It is 
obvious that in studying repetitions in a cryptogram of this type, when the introductory 
key 
is a single letter, a 5-letter repetition in the cipher text, for example, represents a 6-letter word, 
or sequence repeated in the plain text. 
When the introductory 
key is k letters in length then 
nn n-letter repetition represents an (n+k)-letter 
repetition in the plain text. 
c. The discussion will, as usual, be divided into two principal cases: (1) when the cipher 
alphabets are known and (2) when they are unknown. 
Under each case there may be an intro- 
ductory key consisting of a single letter, a word, or a short phrase. 
The single-letter initial 
key will be treated first,.

(4) 
A,. 
(2) B plain-text sequence of the general formula ABA yields a doublet as the cipher equivalent 
of the fmnl two letters. 
(See IV1 or IS1 in DIVISION, 
example 2 above,) 
(3) Every plain-text 
trigraph having A, as its central letter yields a cipher equivalent the 
last two letters of wlich are identical with the initial and final letters of the plain-text trigraph. 
(See MAN in COMMANLING, example 3 above.) 
(4) Every plain-text tetragraph having A, as the initial and the final letter yields a cipher 
equivalent the second and fourth letters of which are identical with the second and third letters 
of the plain-test, tetragraph, respectively. 
(See APTA in CAPTAIN, example 4 above; also ATTA 
in BATTALION, example 1.) 
b. (1) From the foregoing characteristics and the fact that a repetition of a sequence of n 
plain-text letters will yield, in the case of a l-letter introductory 
key, a repetition of a sequence 
of n-l cipher letters, it is obvious that the simplest method of solving this type of cipher is 
that of the probable word. 
Indeed, if the system were used for regular traffic it would not be 
long before the solution would consist merely in referring to lists of cipher equivalents of com- 
monly used words (as found from previous messages) and searching through the messages for 
these cipher equivalents. 
(2) Note how easily the following message can be solved: 
BECJI 
BTMTL 
TWBPQ 
AYMNQ 
HVNET 
WAALC... 
1 ww 
1 
Seeing the sequence BTMTLTWB, which is on the list of equivalents in Q above (see example l), 
the word BATTALION is inserted in proper position. 
Thus: 
BECJI 
BTMTL 
TWBPQ... 
. . . . B 
ATTAL 
ION..... 
Kith 
this as a start, the decipherment may proceed forward or backward with ease. Thus: 
BECJI 
BTMTL 
TWBPQ 
AYMNQ 
HVNET 
WAALC

c. The foregoing example is based upon the so-called Vigenke method of encipherment 
eha=%1; 
eD,,=eaP1). If in encipherment the plain-text 
letter is sought in the cipher com- 
ponent, its equivalent taken in the plain component (0 rn=8,,,; 
@,/2=@cll), the steps in solution 
are identical, except that the list of cipher equivalents of probable words must be modified 
accordingly. 
For instance, BATTALION will now be enciphered 
by the sequence _________________ 
ZTAHLXGZ. 
* The student is cautioned that the characteristics 
noted apply only to the case where tFo identical COD 
ponents are used, with the base letter A.

which also presents idiomor$ic 
characteristics leading to the easy recognition of the word. 
e. All the foregoing phenomena are based upon standard alphabets, but when mixed cipher 
components are used and these have been reconstructed, similar observations may be recorded 
and the results employed in the solution of additional messages enciphered by the same com- 
ponents.

does not appear to be monoalphabetic. 
Plain-text 
auto-keying is sus- 
pected. 
The simplest assumption to make at the start is that single-letter introductory 
keys 
are being used, with the normal Vigenere method of encipherment, and that t,he plain component 
is the normal sequence. Attempts to solve any of the messages on the assumption that the 
cipher component is also the normal sequence being unsuccessful, it is next assumed that the 
cipher component is a mixed sequence. The 13-letter repetition 
J D R U W N G R Y S

repetition P D G 0 V V V K W U are studied intensively.

single-letter introductory 
key is being used, then these repetitions involve 14-letter and 11-letter 
plain-text 
sequences or words; if the normal Vigenere method of encipherment is in effect. 
(ek/?=e/il; 
&,:l=@c/2), then the base letter is A. If the latter is true then a good word which 
would fit the 134etter repetition is: 
Key __________________

Plain text __________ 
R E C 0 N N A I S S A N C E .

and a good word which would fit the lo-letter repetition is:

(3) It is a srmple matter to combine these two partial cipher components into a single 
sequence, and the two components are as follows:

Cipher _________ 
R E A D J U S T I N G B C F H K L M 0 P Q V W X Y Z 
(4) with the primary components at hand, solution of the messages is now an easy matter. 
c. The foregoing example uses an unknown mixed cipher component sliding against what 
was first assumed (and later proved) to be the normal direct sequence. When both primary com- 
ponents are unknown mixed sequences but are identical, solution is more difbcult, naturally, 
because the results of assuming values for repeated sequences cannot be proved and established 
so quickly as in the foregoing example. 
Nevertheless, the general method indicated, and the 
application of the principles of indirect symmetry will lead to solution, if there is a fair amount 
of text available for study. 
When an introductory 
key of several letters is used, repetitions 
are much reduced and the problem becomes still more difficult but by no means insurmountable. 
Space forbids a detailed treatment of the method of solving these cases but it is believed that 
the student is in a position to develop these methods and to experiment with them at his leisure. 
33. Concluding remarks on the solution of auto-key systems.-u. 
The type of solution 
elucidated in the preceding paragraph is based upon the successful application of the probable- 
word method. 
But sometimes the latter method fails because the commonly expected words 
may not be present after all. 
Hence, other principles and methods may be useful. 
Some of 
these methods, useful in special cases, are almost mechanical in their nature. 
Extension of the 
basic principles involved may lead to rather far-reaching complexities. 
However, because these 
methods are applicable only to somewhat special situations, and because they are somewhat 
involved they will be omitted from the text proper and placed in Appendix 1. The student 
who is especially interested in these cases may consult that appendix at his leisure. 
b. It is thought that sticient 
attention has been devoted to the solution of both cipher-text 
and plain-text auto-key systems to have demonstrated to the student that these cryptographic 
methods have serious weaknesses which exclude them from practical usage in military cryptog- 
raphy. 
Besides being comparatively slow and subject to error, they are rather easily solvable, 
even when unknown cipher alphabets are employed.

c. In both systems there are characteristics which permit of identifying 
a cryptogram as 
belon,tig 
to this class of substitution. 
Both cases will show repetitions in the cipher text. 
In 
cipher-test auto-keying there will be far fewer repetitions than in the original plain text, especially 
when introductory 
keys of more than l-letter in length are employed. 
In plain-text auto-keying 
there n-ill be nearly as many repetitions in the cipher text as in the original plain text unless 
long introductory 
keys are used. In either system the repetitions Gil show no constancy as 
regards interrals between them, and a uniliteral frequency distribution 
will show such messages 
to be polyalphabetic in nature.

METHODS 
OF LENGTHENING 
OR EXTENDING 
THE 
KEY

34. Preliminary remarks.-In 
paragraph lb of this text it was stated that two procedures 
suggest themselves for eliminating 
the weaknesses introduced by periodicity 
of the type pro- 
duced by simple, repeating-key methods. 
The Crst of these, when studied, embraced some of 
the very simple methods of suppressing or destroying periodicity, by : .,ch devices as interrupting 
the key and using variable-length 
groupings of plain text. 
It was demonstrated that subter- 
fuges of this simple nature are inadequate to eliminate the weaknesses referred to, and must be 
discarded in any system intended to afford real security. 
The other alternative suggested in 
paragraph lb therefore remains now to be investigated, viz, that of lengthening the keys to a 
point where there would seem to be an insufficient amount of text to enable the cryptanalyst to 
solve the traffic. 
Attempts 
toward this end usually consist in extending 
the key to such a length 
that the enemy cryptanalysts 
will have only a very limited number of periods to work with. 
The key may, indeed, be lengthened to a point where it becomes as long as, or longer than, the 
text to be enciphered, so that the key is used only once. 
35. Extended and nonrepeating keys.-a. 
It is obvious that one of the simplest methods of 
lengthening the key to a message is to use a long phrase or even a complete sentence, provided 
it is not too long to remember. 
In addition to the di ‘Lzulties that would be encountered in 
practical military cryptography ti selecting long mnemonic phrases and sentences which xould 
have to be imparted to many clerks, there is t,he fact that the probable-word method of solution 
still remains as a powerful tool in the hands of enemy cryptanalysts. 
And if only a word or 
two of the key can be reconstructed as a result of a fortunate assumption, it is obvious that the 
enemy cryptanalysts 
could readily guess the entire key from a fragment thereof, since any long 
phrase or sentence which is selected because it can easily be remembered is likely to be well 
known 
to many 
people. 
b. There are, however, more or less simple methods of employing a short mnemonic key in 
order to produce a much longer key. 
Basically, any method of transposition applied to a single 
alphabetic sequence repeated several times will yield a fairly long key, which, moreover, has the 
advantage of being unintelligible 
and thus approaching a random selection of letters. 
For 
example, a numerical 
key may be derived from a word or a short phrase; this numerical 
key may 
then be applied as a columnar-transposition 
key for a rectangle within which the normal alphabet, 
has been repeated a previously agreed upon number of times in a normal (left to right) or pre- 
arranged manner. 
The letters when transcribed from the transposition rectangle then become 
the successive letters for enciphering the plain text, 
using 
any desired type of primary com- 
ponents. 
Or, if a single transposition is not thought to be sufficiently secure, a double trans- 
position will yield a still more mixed up sequence of key letters. 
Other types of transposition 
may be employed for the purpose, including various kinds of geometric figures. 
Also, a non-

transposition method of lengthening the keying sequence and at the same time introducing an 
irregularity-, such as aperiodic interruption 
has already been described (see par. 13). 
c. Another method of developing a long key from a short mnemonic one is that shown below. 
Given the keyword CHRISTNZ3, a numerical sequence is first derived and then one writes down 
successive sections of this numerical key, these sections terminating 
with the successive num- 
bers 1, 2, 3, . . . of the numerical key. 
Thus: 
Llnemonic key _______

CHRISCHRISTMASCHRIST 
Thus the original key of only 9 lettersis expanded to one of 45 letters (l-+3+3$ 
. . . $-9=45). 
The longer key is also an interrupted key of the type noted under paragraph 17, but if the mes- 
sage is long enough to require several repetitions of the espanded key the encipherment becomes 
periodic and can be handled by the usual methods emp!oyed in solving repeating-key ciphers. 
If the basic key is fairly long, so that the expanded key becomes a quite lengthy sequence, then 
the message or messages may be handled in the manner explained in paragraph 20. 
d. Another method of producing a rather long sequence of digits for keying purposes from a 
single kev number is to select a number whose reciprocal when converted by actual division into 
its equivalent decimal yields a long series of digits. 
For example the reciprccal of 49, or lj49, 
yields a sequence of 42 digits beginning .02040815 . . . . 
Such a number, coupled with a 
key word like CHRISTMAS, could be used for interrupted keying, the successive cipher alphabets 
being used for enciphering as many letters as are indicated by the successive digits. 
In the case 
of the example cited, the first digit is 0; hence the C alphabet would not be used. The nest 
digit is 2; the H alphabet would be used for enciphering the first and second letters. 
The third 
digit is again 0; t.he R alphabet would not be used. The fourth digit is 4; the I alphabet would 
be used for enciphering the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth letters, and so on. 
36. Other systems employing lengthy keying sequences.-+. 
Th.e so-called 
“running-key” 
system.-To 
be mentioned in connection with this subject of extensive or lengthy keys is the 
cipher system known as the running-key, continuous-key, or nonrepeating-key system, in which 
the key consists of a sequence of elements which never repeats no matter how long the message 
to be enciphered happens to be. The most common and most practical source of such a key is 
that in which the plain text of a previously agreed-upon book serves as the source for successive 
key letters for encipherment. r The solution of this type of cipher, an accomplishment which was 
once thought impossible, presents some interesting phases and will be considered shortly. * At this 
point it is merely desired to indicate that according to the running-key system the key for an 
individual 
message may be as long as the message and never repeat; but if a large group of 
correspondents employ the same key sequence, it may happen that there will be several messages 
in the same key and they will all begin with the same initial key letter; or, there will be several 
which will “overlap” 
one another v-ith respect to the key, that is, they begin at different initial 
points in the keying sequence but one message soon overtakes the other, so that from that point 
forward all subsequent letters in both messages are enciphered by the same sequence of key 
letters.

b. The so-called progtessicealphubet 
system .-In 
the so-called progressive-alphabet system 
the basic principle is quite simple. 
Two or more primary elements are arranged or provided 
for according to a key which may be varied from time to time; the interaction of the primary 
elements results in making available for cryptographic purposes a set of cipher alphabets; all 
the latter are employed in a fixed sequence or progression; hence the designation progressive- 
alphabet system. 
If the number of alphabets available for such use is rather small, and if the 
text to be enciphered is much longer than the sequence of alphabets, then the system reduces 
to a periodic method. 
But if the number of alphabets is large, so that the sequence is not 
repeated, then of course, the cryptographic text will exhibit no periodic phenomena. 
c. The series of cipher alphabets in such a system constitutes a keying sequence. Once set 
up, often the only remaining element in the key for a specific message is the starting point in the 
sequence, that is, the initial cipher alphabet employed in enciphering a given message. If this 
keying sequence must be employed by a large group of correspondents, and if all messages 
employ the same starting point in the ke-ying sequence, obviously the cryptograms may simply 
be superimposed without any preliminary testing to ascertain proper points for superimposition. 
The student has already been shown how cases of this sort may be solved. 
However, if messages 
are enciphered tith 
varying starting points, the matter of superimposing them properly takes 
on a different aspect. This will soon be treated in detail. 
d. The respective cipher alphabets constituting 
the entire complement of alphabets may 
be employed in a simple progression, that is, consecutively from a preselected initial point; or, 
they may be employed according to other types of progression. 
For example, if the system 
comprises 100 alphabets one might use t,hem in the sequence 1,3,5,7, . . . ; or 1,4,7, 10, . . . ; 
or irregular types of skipping ma.y be employed. 
e. In addition to the foregoing, there are, of course, a great many mechanical methods of 
producing a long key, such as those employed in mechanical or electrical cipher machines. 
In 
most cases these methods depend upon the interaction of two or more short, primary keys which 
jointly produce a single, much longer, secondary or resultant key. 
(See par. 4.) 
Only brief 
reference can be made at, this point in the cryptanalytic 
studies to cases of this kind. 
,4 detailed 
treatment of complex esamples would require much time and space so that it will be reserved 
for subsequent texts. 
f. Finally, there must be mentioned certain devices in which, as in encipherment by the 
auto-key method, the text itself serves to produce the variation in cipher equivaIents, by con- 
trolling the selection of secondary alphabets, or by influencing or determining the sequence with 
which they will be employed. 
Naturally, 
in such cases the key is automatically extended to a 
point where it coincides in length with that of the text. 
An excellent example of such a device 
is that known as the Wheat&me, the solution of which will be described in its proper place.2 
Some writers classify and treat this method as well aa auto-key methods as forms of the running- 
key system but the present author prefers to consider the latter aa being radically different in 
principle from the former types, because in the true running-key system the key is wholly external 
to and independent of text being enciphered. 
This is hardly true of auto-key systems oi of 
systems such as the Wheatstone mentioned herein.

37. Solution when the primary components are known sequences.-+. 
-ti usual, the solution 
of cases involving long or continuous keys will be treated under two headings: First, when the 
primary components are known sequences; second, when these elements are wholly unknown 
or partially unknown. 
b. Since t.he essentia1 purpose in using long keys is to prevent the formation of repetitive 
cycles within the text, it is obvious that in the case of very long keying sequences the crypt- 
analyst is not going to be able to take the text and break it up into FL number of small cycles 
which will permit the establishment of monoalphabetic frequency distributions 
that can readily 
be solved, an end which he can attain all the more readily if to begin with he knows the primary 
sequences. But, there nearly always remains the cryptanalyst’s last resort: the probable-w-ord 
method. 
Inasmuch as this method is applicable to most of these cases, even to that of the 
running-key 
system, which perhaps represents the furthest extension of the principle of long 
keying sequences, an example using a cryptogram of the latter type will be studied. 
38. Solution of a running-key 
cipher when an unknown but intelligible 
key sequence 
is used and the primary components are known.-. 
In paragraph 36~ mention was made of 
the so-called running-key, continuous-key, or nonrepeating-key system, in which the plain t6xt 
of a previously agreed-upon book serves as the source for successive key letters for encipherment. 
Since the running-key 
system is entirely aperiodic, and the cipher text can therefore not be 
arranged in superimposed short cycles, as in the case of the repeating-key system, it would 
appear on first consideration to be “indecipherable” 
without 
the key.’ 
But if the student 
will bear in mind that one of the practical methods of solving a repeating-key cipher is that of 
the probable word,’ he will immediately 
see that the latter method can also be applied in 
solving 
this type of nonrepeating-key 
system. 
The essence of the matter is this: The 
cryptanalyst 
may assume the-presence of a probable word in the text of the message; if he 
knows the primary components involved, and if the assumed word actually exists in the message, 
he can locate it by checking against the key, sin.4~ the latter is intelligible 
ted 
Or, he may 
assume the presence of a probable word or even of a phrase such as “to the,” “of the,” etc., 
in the key text and check his assumption against the text of the message. Once he has forced 
1 At one time, indeed, this view was current among certain cryptographers, 
who thought that the principle 
of factoring the intervals 
between repetitions 
in the c&e of the r&eating-key 
cipher formed the basis for the 
only possible method of solving the latter type of system. 
Since, according to this erroneous idea, factoring 
cannot be applied in the case of the running-key 
system cueing a book aa the key), therefore solution was con- 
eidered to be impossible. 
How far this ides is from the truth will presently be seen. In this same connection 
see &JO footnote 8, page 71.

such an entering wedge into either the message or the key, he may build upon this foundation 
by extending his assumptions for text alternately in the key and in the message, thus gradu- 
ally reconstructing both. 
For esample, given a cr”yptogmm containing the sequence . . . 
HVGGLOWBESLTR . . . , suppose he assumes the presence of the phrase THAT THE in the key text 
and finds a place in the plain text where this yields MMUNITI . 
Thus, using reversed standard 
cipher alphabets: 
Assumed key text _______..___________ 
. . . T H A T T H E . . . 
Cipher text ____________.___.._.________ 
. . . H V G G L 0 W B E S L T R . . . 
Resultant plain text _________________ 
. . . M M U N I T I . . . 
This suggests the word AMMUNITION. The ON in the cipher text then yields PR as the begin- 
ning of the word after THE in the key text. 
Thus: 
A; sumed I+- test. ___________________ 
. . . T H A T T H E P R . . . 
Cipher t,est. __________________________ 
. . . H V G G L 0 W B E S L T R . . . 
Resultant pl :in test----_.--- ________ 
. . . M M U N I T I 0 N . . . 
PR must be followeJ bp a vowel, with 0 the most likely candidate. 
He finds that, 0 yields PI 
in the plain text, which suggests the word WILL. 
The latter then yields OTEC in the key, 
making the latter read THAT THE PROTEC . . . . Thus: 
,4ssumed key text ____________________ 
. . . T H A T T H E P R 0 T E C . . . 
Cipher text ____________________________ 
. . . H V G G L 0 W B E S L T R . . . 
Resultant plain text _________________ 
. . . M M U N I T I 0 N W I L L . . . 
This suggests the words PROTECTION, PROTECTIVE, PROTECTING, etc. 
Thus extending one 
text a few letters serves to “coerce” a few more letters out of the other, somewhat as in the case 
of two boys who are running approximately abreast in a race; as soon as one boy gets a bit ahead 
the spirit of competit,ion causes the other to overtake and pass the first one; then the latter puts 
forth a little more effort, overtakes and ‘passes the second boy. 
Thus the boys alternate in 
overtaking and passing each other until the race is run. 
The only point in which the simile 
fails is that while the boys usually run forward all the time, that is, in a single direction, the 
cryptanalyst 
is free to work in two directions-forward 
and backward from an internal point 
in the message. He may, in the case of the example cited above, continue his building-up 
process by adding A to the front of MMUNITI as well as ON to the rear. 
If he reaches the end of 
his resources on one end, there remains the other end for experimentation. 
He is certainly 
unlucky if both ends terminate in complete words both for the mesaage and for the key, leaving 
him without a single clue to the next word in either, and forcing him to a more intensive 
use 
of his imaginntion, guided only by the context. 
b. In the foregoing illustration 
the cryptanalyst 
is assued 
to have only one message 
available for his experimentation. 
But if he has two or more messages which either begin at 
identical initial points with reference to the key, or overlap one another with respect to the key, 
the reconstruction process described above is, of course, much easier and is accomplished much 
more quickly. 
For ij the messages have been correctly superimposed with reference to the key ted, 
the addition 
of one OF two letters to the key yields stLggestions for the assumption 
of zoo& in several 
messages. The latter lead to the addition of several letters to the key, and so on, in an ever- 
widening circle of ideas for further assumptions, since as the process continues the context 
affords more and more of a basis for the work.

C. Of course, if sufficient of the key text is reconstructed, the cryptanalyst 
might identify 
the book that is being used for the key, and if available, his subsequent labors are very much 
simplified. 
d. -ill the foregoing is, however, dependent not only upon the use of an intelligible test as 
the keying text but also upon having a kno\x:ledge of the primary components or cipher alpha- 
bets employed in the encipherment. 
Even if the primary components are differently miser1 
sequences, so long as they are known sequences, the procedure is quite obvious in view of 
the foregoing explanation. 
The training the student has already had is believed sufficient to 
indicate to him the procedure he may follow in that solution, and no further details will here be 
given in respect, to such cases. But what if the primary components are not known sequences? 
This contingency will be treated present’ly. 
39. Solution of a progressive-alphabet 
cipher when the cipher alphabets are known-u. 
Taking a very simple case, suppose the interacting elements referred to in paragraph 36b consist 
merely of two primary cipher components which slide against each other to produce a set of 26 
secondary cipher alphabets, and suppose that the simplest type of progression is used, viz, the 
cipher alphabets are employed 
ne after the other consecutively. 
Beginning at an initial 
juxtaposition, producing say, alphabet 1, the subsequent secondary alphabets are in the sequence 
2, 3, . . . 26, 1, 2, 3, . . ., and so on. 
If a difTerent initial juxtaposition is used, say alphabet 10 
is the first one, the sequence is exactly the same as before, only beginning at a different point. 
b. Suppose the two primary components are based upon the keyword HYDRAULIC. A 
message is to be enciphered, beginning with alphabet 1. Thus:

c. This method reduces to a periodic system involving 26 secondary cipher alphabet,s and 
the latter are used in simple progression. 
It is obvious therefore that the lst, 27th, 53d, . . . 
letters are in the 1st alphabet; the 2d, 28th, 54th, . . . letters are in the 2d alphabet, and so on. 
d. To solve such a cryptogram, knowing the two primary components, is hardly a problem 
at all. 
The only element lacking is a knowledge of the starting point. 
But this is not neces- 
sary, for merely by completing the plain-component sequences and examining the diagonals of 
the diagram, the plain text becomes evident. 
For example, given the following:

10. 
Had the cipher component been shifted in the opposite direction in encipherment, the steps 
would have been downlv-nrd inst.ead of upward. 
If the sliding strips had been set up according to 
the sequence of cipher letters but on a diagonal, then, of course, the plain-text letters would 
have reappeared on one generatrix. 
e. The student u-ill understand what simple modifications in 
procedure would be required in case the two primary components 
HIDCTEHUXL 
were different mixed sequences. But what if the primary com- 
YCRBVFYLZI

ponents are not known sequences? How does the cryptanalyst 
REUFXJRCYB 
proceed in that case? 
AFLGZKABDE 
40. General solution for ciphers involving

sequence of fixed length and composition.--a. 
It is obvious, as 
LJCKYNLFAG 
stated at a previous point, that no matter how the keying sequence 
IKBMDOIGUJ 
is derived, ijall the correspondents employ the same key, or ij this key ie 
/ 
CMENRPCJLK 
used many times by a single ofice, and ij it always begins at the same 
BNFOAQBKIM 
point, the carious messages may simply be superimposed. 
Thus, their 
EOGPUSEMCN 
respective lst,, 2d, 3rd, . . . letters will all fall within columns 
PPJQLTFNBO 
which have been enc.iphered by the lst, 2d, 3rd, . . . key letters. 
GQKSIVGOEP 
If there is a sticient 
number of messages, solution then becomes 
FIODPL 
10. 
possible by frequency analysis of the successive columns-no 
matter 
how long the keying sequence may be, and regardless of whether the keying sequence constitutes 
intelligible text or is a purely random sequence of letters. 
This method of solution by superimposi- 
tion has already been outlined in paragraph 20 and no further reference to it need here be made. 
b. But now suppose that the keying sequence does not always begin at the same point for 
all messages. Suppose the several correspondents are able to select at will any point in the 
keying sequence as the point of departure in encipherment. 
Thus, such a keying sequence, if re- 
garded as partaking of the nature of a circle, will afford aa many possible starting points aa there 
are letters or characters in that sequence. Now if there are no external indications or indicators a 
in the cryptograms pertaining to such a system, such as would afford enemy cryptanalysts direct 
and detite 
information with regard to the initial keying element for each cryptogram, then it 
would seem as though the superimposition of messages (to bring letters enciphered by the same 
cipher alphabets within the same columns) would be difficult or impossible, and therefore that 
attempts at solution are blocked at their very beginning. 
This, however, is not the end of the 
story. 
For suppose two of the messages have in common only one polygraph, say of 5 letters; 
these two messages may be juxtaposed so as to bring these repetitions into superimposition. 
Thus, the possession of this long polygraph in common serves to “tie” these two m-ages 
to- 
gethcr or to “interlock” 
them. 
Then, suppose a shorter polygraph, say of 4 letters, is possessed 
in common by one of these two messages and a third message; this will serve to tie in the latter 
with the first two. 
Extension of this procew, including the data from shorter repetitions of 
trigraphs and digraphs, will serve to assemble a whole set of such messages in proper super- 
imposition. 
Therefore, the first step is to examine all the messages for repetitions. 
1 Indicators 
play an important 
r61e in practical cryptography. 
An indicator 
ie a symbol (coneiating of a 
letter, group of letters, a figure or a group of figures) which indicates the epecXa key used under the general 
cryptographic 
system, or it may indicate which one of a number of geneml systems hae been used, or it may indi- 
cate both.

c. Khen such repetitions are found, and if there are plenty of them so that assumptions for 
probable words are easy to make, it is clear t,hat, the correct assumptions will enable the crypt- 
analyst to set up plain-cipher equiralencies which will make it possible to reconstruct the pri- 
mary components. 
Depending upon the type used, the principles of direct or indirect sym- 
met,ry of position will be very useful in this process. 
d. But if it happens that there are no polygraphs by means of which two or more messages 
may be tied together and properly superimposed, the simple methods mentioned in subparagraphs 
a-c cannot here be applied. 
However, although the road toward a solution seems to be blocked 
rather effectively, there is a detour which presents rather interesting vistas. 
The latter are 
really of such importance in cryptanalysis as to warrant detailed treatment.

41. The basic theory of the coincidence or K (kappa) test---a. 
In Appendix 2 of the pre- 
ceding text L certam simple applications of the theory of probability 
were presented for the 
student’s consideration, by u-ay of pointing out to him the important role which certain phases 
of that branch of mathematics play in cryptanalysis. 
Reference was there made to the subject 
of coincidences and its significance in connection with the study of repetitions in cryptograms. 
In this section the matter will be pursued a fe\t- steps further. 
b. In the appendix referred t,o, it was shown that the probability of monographic coincidence 
(1) in random text employing a Z-letter 
alphabet is .0385; (2) in English telegraphic plain text, 
.OG67. 
These two parameters were represented by the symbols K, and IQ,, respectively. 
The 
important role which these values play in a certain cryptanalytic 
test Cl1 now be explained. 
c. One of the most import.ant techniques in cryptanalytics 
is that know-n as applying 
the 
coincidence or “kappa 
test.” 
This test is useful for several cryptanalytic 
purposes and one of 
the most important of t,hem is to ascertain when two or more sequences of let’ters are correctly 
superimposed. 
By the word “correct” 
in this case is merely meant that the sequences are so 
arranged relative to one another as to facilitate or make possible a solution. 
The test has for 
its theoretical basis the following circumstances: 
(1) If any two rather lengthy sequences of characters are superimposed, it will be found, 
on exa mining both members of the successive pairs of letters brought into vertical juxtaposition, 
that in a certain number of caSes the two superimposed letters will coincide. 
(2) If both sequences of letters constitute random text (of a 26-letter alphabet), there will 
be about 38 or 39 such cases of coincidenc,e per thousand pairs examined. 
This, of course, is 
because K~= .0385. 
(3) If both sequences of let,ters constitute plain text, there will be about 66 or 67 such cases 
of coincidence per thousand pairs examined. 
This is because KD is .0667. 
(4) If the superimposed sequences are wholly monoalphabetic 
encipherment’s of plain 
text by the same cipher alphabet, there will still be about 66 or 67 cases of coincidence in each 
1,000 cases examined, because in monoalphabetic substitution 
there is a fixed or unvarying 
relation between plain-text letters nnd cipher letters so that for statistical purposes monoalpha- 
betic cipher text behaves just the same as if it were normal plain text. 
(5) Even if the two superimposed sequences are not monoalphabetically 
enciphered texts, 
but are polyalphabetic in character, there will still be about 66 or 67 cases of identity between 
superimposed lett,ers per thousand cases examined, provided the two sequences really belong to the 
same cryptographic 
system and are superimposed 
at the proper point with respect to the keying 
sequence. The reasons for this will be set forth in the succeeding subparagraphs.

(6) Consider the two messages below. 
They hare been enciphered polyalphabetically 
by 
the same two primary components sliding against each other. 
The two messages use the same 
keying sequence, beginning at the same initial point in that sequence. Consequent.ly, the two 
messages are identically enciphered, letter for letter, and the only differences between them nre 
those occasioned by differences in plain text.

Kate, now, that (a) in every case in which two superimposed cipher letters are the same, the 
plain-text let,ters are identical and (b) in every case in which two superimposed cipher letters 
are different, the plain-text 
letters are different. 
In such a system, even though the cipher 
alphabet changes from letter to letter, the number of cases of identity or coincidence in the two 
members of a pnir of superimposed cipher lett,ers will still be about 66 or 67 per thousand cases 
examined, because the two members of each pair of superimposed letters are in the sume cipher 
alphabet and it has been seen in (4) that in monoalphabetic cipher text K is the same as *for plain 
tezt,2 Viz, 
.0667. The two messages may here be said to be superimposed ‘Lcorrectly,” that is, 
brought into proper juxtaposition 
wit’h respect to the keying sequence. 
(7) But now suppose the same two messages are superimposed “incorrectly,” 
that is, they 
are no longer in proper juxtaposition with respect to the keying sequence. Thus:

It is evident that the two members of every pair of superimposed letters are no longer in the 
same cipher alphabet, and therefore, if two superimposed cipher letters are identical this is 
merely an “accident,” 
for now there is no basic or general cause for the similarity, such as is 
true in the case of a correct superimposition. 
The similarity, 
if present, is, as already stated, 
due to chance and the number of such cases of similarity 
should be about the same as though 
the two cipher letters were drawn at random from random text, in which ~,=.0385. 
It is no 
longer true that (a) in every case in which two superimposed cipher letters are the same, the 
plain-text letters are identical, or (b) in every case in which two superimposed cipher let.ters are 
different, the plain-text letters are different. 
Note, for example, that the superimposed T,‘s repre- 
sent two different plain-text letters and that the S, of the word COURSE in the first message gives 
J, while the S of the word ABSOLUTELY in the second message gives H,. Thus, it becomes clear 
that in an incorrect superimposition two different plain-text letters enciphered by two different 
alphabets may “by chance” produce identical cipher letters, which on superimposition yield a 
( The fact that in thie case each monoalphabet 
contains but two letters does not affect the theoretical 
value 
of r; and whether the actual number of coincidences agrees closely with the expected number based upon I= 
.0667 depends upon the lengths of the two superimposed sequences.

60 
coincidence having no external indications as to dissimilarity in plain-text equivalents. 
Hence, 
if there are no other factors which enter into the matter and which might operate to distort 
the results to be expected from the operation of the basic factor, the expected number of cases of 
identical cipher letters brought together by an incorrect superimposition will be determined by 
the value ~,=.0385. 
(8) But now note also that in the foregoing incorrect superimposition there are two ZO’s and 
that they represent the same plain-text letter L. 
This is occasioned by the fact that the plain- 
text mess,ages happened to have L’s in just those two places and that the cipher alphabet hap- 
pened to be the same both times. 
Hence, it becomes clear t.hat the same cipher alphabet brought 
into play twice may “by chance” happen to encipher the same plain-text letter both times, thus 
producing identical cipher letters. 
In some systems this source of identity 
in superimposed 
cipher letters is of little importance, in other systems, it may materially affect the actual number 
of coincidences. 
For instance, if a system is such that it produces a long secondary keying cycle 
composed of repetitions of short primary keying cycles, an incorrect superimposition of two 
cryptograms may bring into juxtaposition 
many of these short cycles, with the result that the 
actual number of cases of identical superimposed cipher letters is much greater than the ex- 
pected number based upon +=.0385. 
Thus, this source for the production of identical cipher 
letters in an incorrect superimposition operates to increase the number of cases to be expected 
from the fundamental constant Kc=.0385. 
(9) In some systems, where nonrelated cipher alphabets are employed, it may happen 
that two identical plain-text letters may be enciphered by two difIerent cipher alphabets which, 
“by chance,” have the same equivalent for the plain-text letter concerned. 
This is, however, 
a function of the particular 
cryptographic 
system and can be taken into account when the 
nature of the system is known. 
(10) In general, then, it may be said that in the case of a correct superimposition the 
probability 
of identity or coincidence in superimposed cipher letters is .0667; in the case of an 
incorrect superimposition, the probability 
is at least .0385 and may be somewhat greater, de- 
pending upon special circumstances. 
The foregoing situation and facts make possible what 
has been referred to as the “coincidence test.” 
Since this test uses the constant 
K, it is also 
called the “kappa test.” 
d. The way in which the coincidence test may be applied will now be explained. 
The 
statement that ~,=.0667 means that in 1,000 cases where two letters are drawn-at random 
from a large volume of plain text, there will be about 66 or 67 cases in which the two letters 
coincide, that is, are identical. 
Nothing is specsed as to what the two letters shall be; they 
may be two Z’s or they may be two E’s. This constant, .0667, really denotes a percentage: 
If many comparisons of single letters are made, the letters being drawn at random from among 
those constituting 
a large volume of plain text, 6.67 percent of these comparisons made will 
yield coincidences. 
So, if 2,000 such comparisons are made, the theory indicates that there 
should be about .0667X2,009=133 
coincidences; if there is sufhcient text to permit of making 
20,000 comparisons, there should be about 1,334 coincidences, and so on. 
< 
e. Another way of handling the matter is to find the ratio of the observed number of co- 
incidences to the total number of cases in which the event in question might possibly occur, i. e., 
the total number of comparisons of superimposed letters. 
When this ratio is closer to .0667 
than it is to .0385 the correct superimposition has been ascerta&ed. 
This is true because in 
the case of a correct superimposition both members of each pair of superimposed letters actually 
belong to the same monoalphabet and therefore the probability 
of their coinciding is .0667; 
whereas in the case of an incorrect superimposition the members of each pair of superimposed

61 
letters belong, as a general rule, to diEerent monoalphabets ), and therefore the probability 
of 
their coinciding is nearer .0385 than .0667. 
j. From the foregoing, it becomes clear that the kappa test involves ascertaining the total 
number of comparisons that can be made in a given case, as well as ascertaining the actual number 
of coincidences in the case under consideration. 
When only two messages are superimposed, 
this is easy: The total number of comparisons that can be made is the same as the number of 
superimposed pairs of letters. 
But when more than two messages are superimposed in a szLpet- 
imposition 
diagram it is necessary to make a simple calculation, based upon the fact that n 
4-J) 
letters yield 
2 
pairs or comparisons, where n is the number of letters in the column.’ 
For 
example, in the case of a column of 3 letters, there are 3X2 
-=3 
comparisons. 
This 
can 
be 
2 
checked by noting that the 1st letter in the column may be compared with the 2d, the 2d with 
‘the 3d, and the 1st with the 3d, making 3 comparisons in all. 
The number of comparisons per 
column times the number of columns in the superimposition diagram of letters gives the total 
number of comparisons. 
The extension of this reasoning to the case where a superimposition 
diagram has columns of various lengths is quite obvious: one merely adds together the number of 
comparisons for columns of different lengths to obtain a grand total. 
For convenience, the 
following brief table is given:

number of coincidences is the sum of the number of coincidences for each case of identity. 
For 
example, in the column sho~-n at the side, containing 10 letters, there are 3 B’s, 2 C’s, 4 K’s, and 
1 Z. The 3 B’s -yield 3 coincidences, the 2 C’s yield 1 coincidence, and the 4 K’s yield 6 
C 
coincidences. 
The sum of 3+1+6 
makes a total of 10 coincidences in 45 comparisons. 
K 
42. General procedure to be followed in making the K test--a. 
The steps in applying 
B 
the foregoing principles to an actual case will now be described. 
Suppose several messages 
K 
enciphered by the same keying sequence but each beginning at a different point in that 
z 
sequence are to be solved. 
The indicated method of solution is that of superimposition, 
K 
the problem being to determine just where the respective messages are to be superimposed 
C 
so that the cipher text within the respective columns formed by the superimposed messages 
B 
will be monoalphabetic. 
From what has been indicated above, it will be understood that 
B 
the various messages mnv be shifted relative to one another t,o many different points of 
K 
superimposition, there being but one correct superimposition for each message with respect 
to all the others. 
First, all the messages are numbered according to their lengths, the long- 
est being assigned the number 1. Commencing with messages 1 and 2, and keeping number 1 in 
a fixed position, message 2 is placed under it so that the initial lett.ers of the two messages coincide. 
Then the tsvo letters forming the successive pairs of superimposed letters are examined and the 
total number of cases in which the superimposed letters are identical is noted, this giving the 
observed number of coincidences. 
Next, the total number of superimposed pairs is ascertained, 
and the latter is multiplied by .0667 to find the expected number of coincidences. 
If the observed 
number of coincidences is considerably below the expected number, or if the ratio of the observed 
number of coincidences to the total number of comparisons is nearer .0385 than .0667, the 
superimposition is incorrect and message 2 is shifted to the next superimposition, 
that is, so 
that its first letter is under the second of message 1. Again the observed number of coincidences 
is ascertained and is compared with the expected number. 
Thus, by shifting message 2 one 
space at a time (to the right or left relative to message 1) the coincidence test finally should 
indicate the proper relative positions of the two messages. When the correct point of super- 
imposition is reached the cryptanalyst is rarely left in doubt, for the results are sometimes quite 
startling. 
After messages 1 and 2 have been properly superimposed, message 3 is tested first 
against messages 1 and 2 separately, and then against the same two messages combined at their 
correct superimposition.b 
Thus message 3 is shifted a step each time until its correct position 
with respect to messages 1 and 2 has been found. 
Then message 4 is taken and its proper point 
of superimposition with respect to messages 1, 2, and 3 is ascertained. 
The process is continued 
in this manner until the correct points of superimposition for all the messages have been found. 
It is obvious that as messages are added to the superimposition diagram, the determination of 
correct points of superimposition for subsequent messages becomes progressively more certain 
and therefore easier. 
b. In the foregoing procedure it is noted that there is necessity for repeated displacement 
of one message against another or other messages. Therefore, it is advisable to transcribe the 
messages on long strips of cross-section paper, joining sections accurately if several such strips 
are necessary to accommodate a long message. Thus, a message once so transcribed can be 
shifted to various points of superimposition relative to another such message, without repeatedly 
rewriting the messages. 
c. Machinery for automatically 
comparing letters in applying the coincidence test has been 
devised. 
Such machines greatly facilitate and speed up the procedure. 
6 At first thought the student might wonder why it is advisable or necessary to test message 3 against message 
1 and message 2 separately before testing it against the combination 
of messages 1 and 2. 
The first two tests, 
it seems to him, might be omitted and time saved thereby. 
The matter will be explained in par. 43f (3).

43. Example of application of the K test-u. 
1%th the foregoing in mind, a practical example 
will now be given. 
The following messages, assumed to be the first 4 of a series of 30 messages, 
supposedly enciphered by a long keying sequence, but each message commencing at a different 
point in that sequence, are to be arranged so as to bring them into correct superimposition:

the number of coincidences is found to be 8. Since the total number of comparisons is 101, the 
expected number, if the superimposition were correct, should be 101X.0667=6.7367, 
or about 
7 coincidences. 
The fact that the observed number of coincidences matches and is even greater 
than the expected number on the very first trial creates an element of suspicion: such good 
fortune is rarely the lot of the practical cryptanalyst. 
It is very unwise to stop at the first trial, 
even ij the results are javorabb, for this close agreement between theoretical and actual numbers

on cross-section 
paper.

of coincidences might just be “one of those accidents.” 
Therefore message 2 is shifted one 
space to the right, placing its 1st letter beneath the 2d letter of message 1. Again the number 
of coincidences is noted and this time it is found to be only 4. The total number of comparisons 
is now 100; the expected number is still about 7. Here the observed number of coincidences is 
considerably less than the expected number, and when the relatively 
small number of com- 
parisons is borne in mind, the discrepancy between the theoretical and actual results is all the 
more striking. 
The hasty cryptanalyst 
might therefore jump to the conclusion that the 1st 
superimposition is actually the correct one. But only two trials have been made thus far and 
a few more are still advisable, for in this scheme of superimposing a series of messages it is 
absolutely essential that the very first superimpositions rest upon a perfectly sound foundation- 
otherwise subsequent work will be very difficult, if not entirely fruitless. 
Additional trials will 
therefore be made. 
c. Message 2 is shifted one more space to the right and the number of coincidences is now 
found to be only 3. Once again message 2 is shifted, to the position shown below, and the 
observed number of coincidences jumps suddenly to 9.

The total number of comparisons is now 9S, so that the expect&l number of coincidences is 98X 
.0667’=6.5366, or still about 7. The 2d and 3d superimpositions are definitely incorrect; as to 
the 1st and 4th, the latter gives almost 30 percent more coincidences than the former. Again 
considering the relatively small number of comparisons, this 30 percent difEerence in favor of 
the 4th superimposition as against the 1st is important. 
Burther detailed explanation is unneces- 
sary, and the student may now be told that it happens that the 4th superimposition is really 
correct; if the messages were longer, all doubt would be dispelled. 
The relatively large number 
of coincidences found at the 1st superimposition is purely accidental in this case. 
d. The phenomenon noted above, wherein the observed number of coincidences shows a 
sudden increase in moving from an incorrect to 8 correct superimposition is not at all unusual, 
nor should it be unexpected, because there is only m correct superimposition, while aU other 
superimpositions are entirely incorrect. 
In other words, a superimposition is either 100 percent 
correct or 100 percent wrong-and 
there are no gradations between these two extremes. 
Theoretically, therefore, the difference between the correct superimposition and any one of the 
many incorrect superimpositions should be very marked, since it follows from what has been 
noted above, that one cannot expect that the discrepancy between the actual and the theoretical 
number of coincidences should get smaller and smaller as one approaches closer and closer to 
the correct superimposition.’ 
For if letters belonging to the same cipher alphabet are regarded 
7 The importance of this remark will be appreciated when the student cornea to study longer examples, in 
which statistical expectations have a better opportunity to materialize.

as being members of the same family, so to speak, then the two letters forming the successive 
pairs of letters brought into superimposition by au incorrect placement of one message relative 
to another are totnl strangers to each other, brought together by pure chance. This happens 
time and again, as one message is slid against the other-until 
the correct superimposition is 
reached, whereupon in ecery case the two superimposed letters belong to the same family. 
There 
may be many different families (cipher alphabets) but the fact that in every case two members 
of the same family are present causes the marked jump in number of coincidences. 
e. In shifting one message against another, the cryptanalyst 
may move to the right con- 
stantly, or he may move to the left constantly, or he may move alternately to the left and right 
from a selected initial point. 
Perhaps the latter is the best plan. 
f. (1) Having properly superimposed messages I and 2, message 3 is next. to be studied. 
Xom it is.of course possible to test the latter message against the combination of the former, 
without further ado. That is, ascertaining merely the total number of coincidences given by the 
superimposition 
of the 3 messages might be thought suflicient. 
But for reasons Fvhich wiil 
soon become apparent it is better, even though muc.h more work is involved, first to test message 
3 against message 1 alone and against message 2 alone. 
This will really not involve much addi- 
tional work after all, since the two tests can be conducted simultaneously, because the proper 
superimposition of messages 1 and 2 is already known. 
If the tests against messages 1 and 2 
separately at a given superimposition give good results, then message 3 can be tested, at that 
superimposition, against messages 1 and 2 combined. 
That is, all 3 messages are tested as a 
single set. Since, according to the scheme outlined, a set of three closely related tests is involved, 
one might as well systematize the work so as to save time and effort, if possible. 
With this in 
view a diagram such as that shown in Figure lla is made and in it the coincidences are recorded 
in the appropriate cells, to show separately the coincidences between messages 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 
2 and 3, for each superimposition tested. 
The number of tallies in the cell l-2 is the same at 
the beginning of all the tests; it has already been found to be 9. Therefore, 9 tallies are inserted 
in cell 1-2 to’begin with. 
A column which shows identicnl letters in messages 1 and 3 yields a 
single tally for cell 1-3; a column which shows identical letters in messages 2 and 3 yields a single 
tally for cell 2-3. 
Only when a superimposition yields 3 identicsl letters in a column, is a tally 
to be recorded simultaneously in cells l-3 and 2-3, since the presence of 3 identical letters in the 
column yields 3 coincidences.

The successive columns are now esamined and the coincidences are recorded, remembering that 
only coincidences between messages 1 and 3, and between messages 2 and 3 are now to be tabu-

(3’) The reason for the separate tabulation 
of coincidences between messages 1 and 3, 
2 and 3. and 1. 2. and 3 should now be apparent. 
1Vhereas the observed number of coincidences 
is 57 percent heinw the espected number of coincidences in the case of messages 1 and 3 alone, 
and 50 percent below in the case of messages 2 and 3 alone, the discrepancy between the expected 
and observed numbers is not quite so marked (-21 percent) when all three messages are con- 
sidered togethtr. becallse the relatirelv 
high number of comcidences betlveen messages 1 and 2, 
which are correctly superimposed. serres to counterbalance the low numbers of coincidences 
between 1 and 3. and 2 and 3. 
Thus. a correct superimposition 
for one of the three combino tiona 
may yield such good results a.9 to mask the bad results jot 
the other taco combinations.

Note how well the obsemed and expected numbers of coincidencea agree in all three combina-

Indeed, the results of this test are so good that the cryptanalyst 
might well hesitate to 
make any more tests.

(6) It is believedthattheprocedure 
hasbeen explained with sufficient detail tomake further 
examples unnecessary. 
The student should bear in mind always that as he adds messages to 
the superimposition diagram it is necessary that he recalculate the number of comparisons so 
that the correct expected or theoretical number of coincidences will be before him to compare 
with the observed number. 
In adding messages he should see that the results of the separate 
teats are consistent, as well ns those for the combined tests, otherwise he may be led astray at 
times by the overbalancing effect of the large number of coincidences for the already ascertained, 
correct superimpositions. 
44. Subsequent steps.-a. 
In paragraph 43a four messages were given of a series supposedly 
enciphered by a long keying sequence, and the succeeding pa.ragraphs were devoted to an ex- 
planation of the preparatory steps in the solution. 
The messages have now been properly 
euperimposed, so that the text has been reduced to monoalphabetic columnar form, and the 
matter is now to be pursued to ita ultimati 
stagea.’

b. The four messages employed in the demonstration of the principles of the K test have 
served their purpose. 
The information 
that they are messages enciphered by an intelligible 
running key, by reversed standard cipher alphabets, was withheld from the student, for peda- 
gogical reasons. ‘i’iere the key a random sequence of letters instead of intelligible 
text, the 
esplanation of the coincidence test would have been unchanged in the slightest particular, so 
far as concerns the mechanics of the test itself. 
Kere the cipher alphabets unknown, mixed 
alphabets, the explanation of the K test would also have been unchanged in the slightest par- 
ticular. 
But, as stated before, the four messages actually represent encipherments by means of 
an intelligible 
running key, by reversed standard alphabets; they will now be used to illustrate 
the solution of cases of this sort. 
c. Assuming now that the cryptanalyst is fully aware that the enemy is using the running- 
key system with reversed standard alphabets (obsolete U. S. Army cipher disk), the method of 
solution outlined in paragraph 38 will be illustrated, 
employing the first of the four messages 
referred to above, that beginning PGLPN HUFRK SAUQQ. The word DIVISION will be taken as 
a probable word and tested against the key, beginning with the very first letter of the message. 
Thus: 
Cipher text _________________________ 
PGLPNHUFRKSAUQQ.. 
-4ssumed plain test ______________ 
D I V I S I 0 N . . . . . . . . . 
Resultant key text _______________ 
S 0 G X F . . . . . . . . . . . . 
The resultant key text is unintelligible 
and the word DIVISION is shifted one letter to the right. 
Cipher text _________________________ 
PGLPNHUFRKSAUQQ.. 
Assumed plain text ______________ 
. D I V I S I 0 N . . . . . . . . 
Resultant key text _______________ 
. J T K . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
Again the resultant key text, is unintelligible 
and the hypothetical 
word DIVISION is shifted 
once more. 
Continuation 
of this process to the end of the message proves that the word is not 
present. 
Another probable word is assumed: REGIMENT. When the point shown below is 
reached, note the results: 
Cipher text _________________________ 
P G L P N H U F R K S A U Q Q . . 
Assumed plain text ______________ 
. . . . R E G I M E N T . . . . . 
Resultant key text _______________ 
. . . . E L A N D 0 F T . . . . . 
It certainly 
looks as though intelligible 
text were being obtained as key text. 
The words 
LAND OF T . . . suggest that THE be tried. 
The key letters HE give NO, making the plain text 
read . . ..REGIMENT NO... 
. 
The four spaces, preceding REGIMENT suggest such words 
as HAVE, SEND, MOVE, THIS, etc. 
A clue may be found by assuming that the E before LAND 
in the key is part of the word THE. Testing it on the cipher text gives IS for the plain text, 
which certainly indicates that the message begins with the word THIS. 
The latter yields IN 
for the tist two key letters. 
And so on, the process of checking one text against the other con- 
tinuing until the entire message and the key text have been reconstructed. 
d. Thus far the demonstration has employed but one of the four messages available for 
solution. 
When the reconstruction 
process is applied to all four simultaneously it naturally 
goes much faster, with reduced necessity for assuming words after an initial entering wedge has

been driven into one message. For example, note what happens in this case just as soon as the 
word REGIMENT is tried in the proper place:

e. But now suppose that the key text that has been actually employed in encipherment is 
not intelligible 
text. The process is still somewhat the same, only in this case one must %ave at 
least two messages in the same key. 
For instead of checking a hypothetical word (assumed to 
be present in one message) against the key, the same kind of a check is made against the other 
message or messages. Assume, for instance, that in the case just described the key test, instead 
of being intelligible text, were a series of letters produced by applying a rather complex transpo- 
sition to an originally intelligible 
key text. 
Then if the word REGIMENT were assumed to be 
present in the proper place in message So. 1 the resultant key letters would yield an unintelligible 
sequence. But these key letters when applied to message No. 2 would nevertheless yield 
IELDTRAI; when applied to message No. 3, LINGKITC, and so on. 
In short, the text of on.e mes- 
sage is checked against the text of another message OT messages; if the originally assumed word is 
correct, then plain text till be found in the other messages.* 
* Perhaps this is as good a place as any to make some observations which are of general interest in connection 
with the running-key 
principle, 
and which have no doubt been the subject of speculation on the part of som- 
students. 
Suppose a basic, unintelligible, 
random sequence of keying characters which is not derived from the 
interaction 
of two or more shorter keys and which never repeats is employed bul once as a key for encipherment. 
Can a cryptogram 
enciphered in such a system be solved? 
The answer to this question must unqualifiedly 
be 
this: even if the cipher alphabets are known sequences, cryptanalytic 
science is certainly 
powerless to attack 
such a cryptogram. 
Furthermore, 
so far ss can now be discerned, no method of attack is likely ever to he devised. 
Short of methods based upon the alleged phenomena 
of telepathy-the 
very objective 
existence of which is 
denied by most “sane” investigators 
today-it 
is impossible for the present author to conceive of any way of 
att,acking such a cryptogram. 
This is a case (and perhaps the only caye) in which the impossibility 
of cryptanalysis 
is mathematically 
demonst,rable. 
Two things are involved 
in a complete solution in mathematics: 
not only must a satisfact,nry 
(logical) answer to the problem be offered, but also it must be demonstrated 
that the answer offered is ljniqxe, 
that is, t,he only possible one. 
(The mistake is often made that the latter phase of what constitutes a valid 
solution is overlooked-and 
this is the basic error which numerous alleged Bacon4hakespeare 
“cryptographers” 
commit.) 
To attempt 
to solve a cryptogram 
enciphered in the manner indicated is analogous to an attempt 
to 
find a unique solution for a single equation 
containing 
two unknowns, with absolutely 
no data available 
for 
solution other than those given by that equation itself. 
It is obvious that no unique solution is possible in such 
a case, since nny one quantily whatsoever may be chosen for one of the unknowns and the other will folldw as a 
conseouence. 
Therefore an infinite number of Werent 
apswers, all equally valid, is possible.

f. All the foregoing work is, of course, based upon a knowledge of the cipher alphabets 
employed in the encipherment. 
-What if the latter are unknown 
sequences? It may be stated 
at once that not much could be done with but four messages, even after they had been super- 
imposed correctly, for the most that one would have in the Ray of data for the solution of the 
individual 
columns of text would be four letters per alphabet-which 
is not nearly enough. 
Data for solution by indirect symmetry by the detection of isomorphs cannot be expected, for 
no isomorphs are produced in this system. 
Solution can be reached only if there is sufficient 
text to permit of the analysis of the columns of the superimposition diagram. 
When there is 
this amount of text there are also repetitions which afford bases for the assumption of probable 
words. 
Only then, and after the values of a few cipher letters have been established can indirect 
symmetry be applied to facilitate the reconstruction of the primary components-if 
used. 
g. Even when the volume of text is great enough so that each column contains say 15 to 20 
letters, the problem is still not an easy one. But, frequency distributions 
with 15 to 20 letters 
can usually be studied statistically, 
so that if two distributions 
present similar characteristics, 
the latter may be used as a basis for combining distributions 
which pertain to the same cipher 
alphabet. 
The next section will be devoted to a detailed treatment of the implications of the 
last statement. 
cryptogram 
enciphered in the manner indicated, 
there is the equivalent 
of an equation with two unknowns; 
the key is one of the unknowns, the plain text is the other. 
One may conjure up an infinite number of different 
plain texts and offer any one of them as a “solution.” 
One may even perform the perfectly meaningless labor 
of reconstructing 
the “key” 
for this selected “solution”; 
but since there is no way of proving from the cryptogram 
itself, or from the reconstructed 
key (which is unintelligible) 
whether the “solution” 
so selected is fhe actual 
plain text, all of the infinite number of “solutions” 
are equally valid. 
ICOW since it is inherent in the very idea 
. 
of cryptography 
as a practical art that there must and can be only one actual solution (or plain testj, and since 
none of this infinite number of different solutions can be proved to be Ihe one and only correct solution, therefore, 
our common sense rejects them one and all, and it may be said that a cryptogram 
enciphered in the manner 
indicated is absolutely impossible to solve. 
It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that the foregoing statement is no longer true when the running key 
constitutes intelligible 
text, or if it is used to encipher more than one message, or if it is the secondary resultant of 
the interaction 
of two or more short primary 
keys which go through cycles themselves. 
For in these cases there 
is additional 
information 
available for the delimitation 
of one of the pair of unknowns, and hence a unique solu- 
tion becomes possible. 
Sow although 
the running-key 
system described in the first paragraph 
represents the ultimate 
goal of 
cryptographic 
security and is the ideal toward which cryptographic 
experts have striven for a long time, there is 
a wide abyss to be bridged between the recognition of a theoretically 
perfect system and its establishment 
as a 
practical 
means of secret intercommunication. 
For the mere mechanical details involved 
in the production, 
reproduction, 
and distribution 
of such keys present difficulties which are so formidable as to destroy the effectivc- 
ness of the method as a system of secret intercommunication 
suitable for groups of correspondents engaged in a 
voluminous exchange of messages.

45. Preliminary remarks.--a. 
The real purpose of making the coincidence test in cases such 
as that studied in the preceding section is to permit the cryptanalyst to arrange his data so as to 
circumvent the obstacle which the enemy, by adopting a complicated polyalphabetic scheme of 
encipherment, places in the way of solution. 
The essence of the matter is that by dealing indi- 
vidually 
with the respective columns of the superimposition 
diagram the cryptanalyst 
has 
arranged the polyalphabetic 
text so that it can be handled as though it were monoalphabetic. 
Usually, the solution of the latter is a relatively easy matter, especially if there is sufficient text 
in the columns, or if the letters within certain columns can be combined into single frequency 
distributions, 
or if some cryptographic relationship can be established between the columns. 
b. It is obvious that merely ascertaining the correct relative positions of the separate mes- 
sages of a series of messages in a superimposition diagram is only a means to an end, and not an 
end in itself. 
The purpose is, as already stated, to reduce the complex, heterogeneous, poly- 
alphabetic text to simple, homogeneous, monoalphabetic text. 
But the latter can be solved only 
when there are sufficient data for the purpose-and 
that depends often upon the type of cipher 
alphabets involved. 
The latter may be the secondary alphabets resulting from the sliding of the 
normal sequence against its reverse, or a mixed component against the normal, and so on. 
The 
student has enough information concerning the various cryptanalytic 
procedures which may be 
applied, depending upon the circumstances, in reconstructing diflerent types of primary com- 
ponents and no more need be said on this score at this point. 
c. The student should, however, realize one point which has thus far not been brought 
specifically to his attention. 
Although the superimposition diagram referred to in the preceding 
subparagraph may be composed of many columns, there is often only a relatively small number 
of &@eteni cipher alphabets involved. 
For example, in the case of two primary components of 
26 letters each there is a maximum of 26 secondary cipher alphabets. 
Consequently, it follows 
that in such a case if a superimposition diagram is composed of say 100 columns, certain of those 
columns must represent similar secondary alphabets. 
There may, and probably will be, no 
regularity 
of recurrence of these repeated secondaries, for they are used in a manner directly 
governed by the letters composing the words of the key text or the elements composing the. 
keying sequence. 
d. But the latter statement offers an excellent clue. 
It is clear that the number of times a 
given secondary alphabet is employed in such a superimposition diagram depends upon the com- 
* The x test, presented in this section, as well aa the e test, presented in Section XIV, mere first described 
in an important 
paper, SlalieticaZ Mefhodr in CryplanaZytis, 1935, by Solomon Kullback, 
Ph. D., Associate Crypt- 
analyst, 
Signal Intelligence 
Service. 
I take pleasure in acknowledging 
my indebtedness 
to Dr. Kullback’s 
paper for the basic material 
used in my own exposition of these teats, as well ee for his helpful criticisms 
thereof 
while in manuscript.

position of the key test. 
Since in the case of a running-key system using a book as a key the 
key test constitutes intelligible 
text, it follows that the various secondary alphabets will be em- 
ployed w’th jreouencies which are directly related to the respectice frequencies of occurrence oj letters 
in normal plain 
tez+t. Thus, the alphabet corresponding to key letter E should be the most 
frequently used; the alphabet corresponding to key letter T should be next in frequency, and so on. 
From this it follows that instead of being c&fronted with a problem involving as many different 
secondary cipher alphabets as there are columns in the superimposition diagram, the crypt- 
analyst will usually have not over 26 such alphabets to deal with; and allowing for the extremely 
improbable repetitive use of alphabets corresponding to key letters J, K, Q, X, and Z, it is likely 
that the cryptanalyst will have to handle only about 19 or 20 secondary alphabets. 
e. Moreover, since the E secondary alphabet will be used most frequently and so on, it is 
possible for the cryptanalyst 
to study the various distributions 
for the columns of the super- 
imposition diagram with a view to assembling those distributions which belong to the same cipher 
alphabet, thus making the actual determination of values much easier in the combined distri- 
butions than would otherwise be the case. 
-f. However, if the keying sequence does not itself const.itute intelligible 
text, even if it is 
a random sequence, the case is by no means hopeless of solution-provided 
there is sufficient 
text within columns so that the columnar frequency distributions may afford indications enabling 
the cryptanalyst 
to amalgamate a large number of small distributions into a smaller number of 
larger distributions. 
g. In this process of assembling or combining individual 
frequency distributions 
Ehich be- 
long to the same cipher alphabet, recourse may be had to a procedure merely alluded to in con- 
nection with previous problems, and designated as that of “matching” 
distributions. 
The nest 
few paragraphs will deal with this important subject. 
46. The nature of the “Cross-product 
sum” or “x (Chi) test” in cryptanalysis.--a: 
The 
studeui has already beeu Gunfronted with cases in which it was necessary or desirable to reduce 
a large number of frequency distributions 
to a smaller number by identifying and amalgamating 
distributions 
which belong to the same cipher alphabet. 
Thus, for example, in a case in which 
there are, say, 15 distributions but only, say, 5 separate cipher alphabets, the difficulty in solving 
a message can be reduced to a considerable degree provided that of the 15 distributions 
those 
which belong together can be identified and allocated to the respective cipher alphabets to which 
they apply. 
b. This process of identifying 
distributions 
which belong to the same cipher alphabet in- 
volves a careful examination and comparison of the various members of the entire set of distri- 
butions to ascertain which of them present saciently 
similar characteristics to warrant their 
being combined into a single distribution 
applicable to one of the ciphdr alphabets involved in 
the problem. 
Now when the individual 
distributions 
are fairly large, say containing over 50 
or 60 letters, the matter is relatively easy for the experienced cryptanalyst 
and can be made by 
the eye; but when the distributions 
are small, each containing a rather small number of letters, 
*ocular comparison and identification 
of two or more distributions M belonging to the same alpha- 
bet become quite diflicult and often inconclusive. 
In any event, the time required for the suc- 
cessful reduction of a multiplicity 
of individual 
small distributions 
to a few larger distributions 
is, in such cases, a very material factor in dete rmining whether the solution will be accomplished 
in time to be of actual value or merely of historical interest. 
c. However, a certain siatistical test, called the “cross-product sum” or “x test”, hss been 
devised, which can be brought to bear upon this question and, by methods of mathematical 
comparison, eliminate to a large degree the uncertainties of the ocular method of matching and 
combining frequency distributions, 
thus in many cases materially reducing the time required 
for solution of a complex problem.

d, It is advisable to point out, however, that the student must not e.xpect too much of a 
mathematical method of comparing distributions, because there are limits to the size of distribu- 
tions to be matched below which these methods will not be effective. 
If two distributions 
contain some similar characteristics the mathematical method will merely afford a quantitative 
measure of the degree of similarity. 
TWO distributions may actually pertain to the same cipher 
alphabet but, as occasionally happens, they may not present any external evidences of this 
relationship, in which case no mathematical method can indicate the fact that the two distribu- 
tions are really similar and belong to the same alphabet. 
47. Derivation of the x test.--u. 
Consider the following plain-test distribution 
of ci0 letters: 
5 
-5 
z 
3% 
AB~~~~G~~JKL~~~PQ~S~~V~XYZ 
In a previous text 2 it was shown that the chance of drawing two identical letters in normal 
English telegraphic plain text is the sum of the squares of the relative probabilities of occurrence 
of the 26 letters in such text, which is .0667. That is, the probability of monographic coincidence 
in English telegraphic plain text is K,=.O667. 
In the message to which the foregoing distribu- 
tion of 50 letters applies, the number of possible pairings (comparisons) that can be made betweeT 
single letters is '?=1,225. 
According to the theory of coincidences there should, therefore 
be 1,225X.0667=81.7065 
or approrrimately 82 coincidences of single letters. 
Examining the 
distribution 
it is found that there are 83 coincidences, as shown below: 
s 
s 
-.F 
-2 
ABC~~ac~~JKt~~~PQ~~~~v~xyz 
3+0+0+1+21+0+0+1+3+0+0+0+1+10+i:+0+0+I+10+15+1+0+1+0+u+0=~ 
The actual number of coincidences agrees very closely with the theoretical number, which is 
of course to be expected, since the text to which the distribution 
applied has been indicnted as 
being normal plain text. 
b. In the foregoing simple demonstration, let the number of comparisons that can be made 
in the distribution 
be indicated symbolically by AT( N- 
1) 
2 
J where .??= the totnl number of letters 
in the distribution. 
Then the expected number of coincidences may be written as .0067.\'(.1'-- 
1) 
2 
t 
which may then be rewritten as 
(1) 
.0067-v-.0667N 
2 
c. Likewise, if fA represents the number of occurrences of A in the foregoing distribution, 
then the number of coincidences for the letter A may be indicated symbolically by f”(.k1). 
And similarly, the number of coincidences for the letter B may be indicated by h&--1: 2 -, 
and 
so on down to fi(fz-l). 
The total number of actual coincidences found in the distribution 
is, 
2 
of course, the sum of j,‘?;-l)

If the symbolfe is used to indicate

any of the letters A, B, . . . Z, and the symbol z is used to indicate that the sum of all the

elements that follow this sign is to be found, then the sum of the actual coincidences noted in 
the distribution 
may be indicated thus: c

) which may be rewritten as

c

d. Now although derived from difIerent sources, the two expressions labeled (I) and (II) 
above are equal, or should be equal, in normal plain text. 
Therefore, one may write: 
c 
f&-fe-.0667p--.0667-h’ 
-- 2 
2 
Simplifying this equation: 
(III) 
Ej&--Sje=.0667N2-.0667N 
e. Now 2fe=l)T. 
Therefore, expression (III) 
may be written as 
(IV) 
zje2-N=.0667N’-.0667N, 
which on reduction becomes: 
W) 
Xje2=.0667AT+.9333N 
This equation may be read as “the sum of the squares of the absolute frequencies of a distribution 
is equal to .0667 times the square of the total number of letters in the distribution, 
plus .9333 
times the total number of letters in the distribution.” 
The letter S2 is often used to replace the 
s,ymbol zja2. 
j. Suppose two monoalphabetic distributions 
are thought to pertain to the same cipher 
alphabet. 
Now if they actually do belong to the same alphabet, and if they are correctly ’ 
combined into a single distribution, 
the latter must still be monoalphabetic in character. 
That 
is, again representing the individual letter frequencies in one of these distributions by the general 
symbol-fee, the individual letter frequencies in the other distribution by fe,, and the total frequency 
in the East distribution 
by N,, that in the second distribution 
by N,, then 
WI) 
Z(~el+jet)‘=.0667(N,+Np)‘+.9333(N,+Nz) 
Expanding the terms of this equation: 
(VII) 
~j~12+2~f~,~~2+~f~~=.0667(N~+2;1:N~tNz2)+.9333N,+.93~3N, 
But from equation (V): 
Zje,2=.0667N,z+.9333Nl 
and 
so that equation (VII) may be rewritten thus: 
.0667N12+.9333Nl+2&, 
je3+.0667N,t+.9333N2= 
.0667(N~‘+2N,Ns+Ns2)f.9333N,+.9333N,

g. The last equation thw permits of establishing an expected value for the sum oj the product8 
of the corresponding jrequencks 
of the two distributions 
being considered for amalgamation. 
The 
cross-product 8urn or x test for matching two distributions 
is based upon equation (VIII).

b. The fact that the quotient (.0711) agrees very closely with the expected value (.0667) 
means that the two distributions very probably belong together or are properly matched. 
Note 
the qualifying phrase “very probably.” 
It implies that there is no certainty about this business 
of matching distributions by mathematical methods. 
The mathematics serve only as measuring 
devices, so to speak, which can be employed to measure the degree of similarity that exists. 
c. Instead of dividing xje,ja, by N,N, and seeing how closely the quotient approximates the 
value .0667 or .0385, one may set up an expected value for zje, j% and compare it with the ob- 
served value. 
Thus, in the foregoing example .0667 (N,N2)=.0667X422=28.15; 
the observed 
value of zfe, jep is 30 and therefore the agreement between the expected and the observed values 
is quite close, indicating that the two distributions 
are probably properly matched. 
d. There are other mathematical or statistical tests for matching, in addition to the x test. 
Moreover, it is possible to go further with the x test and find a measure of the reliance that may 
be placed upon the value obtained; but these points will be left for future discussion in subse- 
quent texts.

e. One more point will, however, here be added in connection with the x test. 
Suppose 
the very same two distributions in subparagraph a are again juxtaposed, but with je, shifted one 
interval to the left of the position shown in the subparagraph of reference. 
Thus:

Here zje, je,=2+3+2+3=10 
and 
Ef%f% 
10 
N,;=442=.0226 
The observed ratio (.0226) is so much smaller than the expected (.0667) that it can be said that if 
the two distributions pertain to the same primary components they are not properly superimposed. 
In other words, the x test rrtay also be applied in cases where two or more frequency distributions 
must 
be shijted relatkely 
in order tojind 
their correct superimposition. 
The theory underlying this appli- 
cation of the x test is, of course, the same as before: two monoalphabetic distributions when prop- 
erly combined will yield a single distribution 
which should still be monoalphabetic in character. 
In applying the x test in such cases it may be necessary to shift two 264ement distributions 
to 
various superimpositions, make the x test for each superimposition, and take as correct that one 
which yields the best value for the test. 
f. The nature of the problem will, of course, determine whether the frequency distributions 
which are to be matched should be compared (1) by direct superimposition, that is, setting the A 
to Z tallies of one distribution 
directly opposite the corresponding tallies of the other distribution, 
as in subparagraph a, or (2) by shifted superimposition, that is, keeping the A to Z tallies of the 
first distribution 
fixed and sliding the whole sequence of tallies of the second distribution 
to 
various superimpositions against the first.

49. Study of a situation in which the x test may be applied.-a. 
A simple demonstration 
of how the x-test is applied in matching frequency distributions 
may now be set before the 
student. 
The problem involved is the solution of cryptograms enciphered according to the 
progressive-alphabet system (par. 36b), with secondary alphabets derived from the interaction 
of two identical mixed primary components. 
It will be assumed that the enemy has been using 
a system of this kind and that the primary components are changed daily. 
b. Before attacking an actual problem of this type, suppose a few minutes be devoted to a 
general analysis of its elements. 
It is here assumed that the primary components are based 
upon the HYDRAULIC . . . Z sequence and that the cipher component is shifted toward the 
right one step at a time. 
Consider a cipher square such as thnt shown in Figure 12, which is 
applicable to the type of problem under study. 
It has been arranged in the form of a deciphering 
square. 
In this square, the horizontal 
sequences are aLl identical 
but merely shi,fted relatively; 
tk 
letters inside the square are plain-text letters.

c. If, for mere purposes of demonstration, instead of letters within the cells of the square 
there are placed tallies corresponding in number with the normal frequencies of the letters 
occupying the respective cells, the cipher square becomes as follows (showing only the 1st 
three rows of the square):

d. It is obvious that here is a case wherein if two distributions pertaining to the square are 
isolated from the square, the x test (matching distributions) 
can be applied to ascertain how the 
distributions sllould be shifted relative to each other so t,hat they can be superimposed and made 
to yield a monoalphabetic composite. 
There is obviously one correct superimposition out of 25 
possibilities. 
In this case, the B row of tallies must be displaced 5 intervals to the right in order 
to match it and amalgamate it with the A row of tallies. 
Thus: 
e. Note that the amount of displacement, that is, the number of intervals t,he B sequence 
must be shifted to make it match the A sequence in Figure ISb, corresponds exactly to the distance 
between the letters A and B in the primary cipher component, which is 5 intervals. 
Thus: 
012346 
. . . AULICB... 
. 
The fact that the primary pls.in component is in this case identical 
with the primary cipher component has nothing to do with the matter. 
The displacement interval 
is being measured on the cipher component. 
It is important that the student see this point very 
clearly. 
He can, if he like, prove the point by experimenting with two different primary com- 
ponents. 
j. Assuming that a message in such a system is to be solved, the text is transcribed in rows 
of 26 letters. 
A uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
is made for es.ch column of the transcribed 
text, the 26 separate distributions 
being compiled within a single square sucl: as that shown in 
Figure 14. Such a square may be termed a frequency distribufion 
square. 
g. Now the vertical columns of tallies within such a distribution square constitute frequency 
distributions 
of the usual type: They show the distribution 
of the various cipher letters in each 
cipher alphabet. 
If there were many lines of text,, all arranged in periods of 26 letters, then each 
column of the frequency square could be solved in the usual manner, by the application of the 
simple principles of monoalphabetic frequency. 
But what do t,he horizontal rows of tallies 
within t,he square represent? 
Is it not clear that the first such row, the A row,‘merely shows the 
distribution 
of A, throughout the successive cipher alphabets? 
And does not this graphic picture 
of the distribution 
of A, correspond to the sequence of letters composing the primary 
plain component? 
Furthermore, is it not clear that what has been said of the A row of tallies applies equally to the 
B, C, D,. . . ..Zrows? 
Finally, is it not clear that the graphic pictures of all the distributions 
correspond to the same sequence of letters, except that the sequence begins with a diRerent letter 
in each row? 
In other words, all the horizontal rows of tallies within the distribution 
square 
apply to the same sequence of plain-text letters, the sequences in one row merely beginning with 
a different letter from that with which another row begins. 
The sequences of letters to which 
the tallies apply in the various rows are merely displaced relative to one another. 
Now if there 
are sufficient data for statistical purposes in the various horizontal sequences of tallies within the 
distribution 
square, these sequences, being approximat,ely similar, can be studied by means of 
the x test to find their relative displacements. 
And in finding the latter a method is provided 
whereby the primary cipher component may be reconstructed, since the correct assembling of 
the displacement data will yield the sequence of letters constituting the primary cipher component,. 
If the plain component is identical wit,h the cipher component, the solution is immediately at

Thus, there hes been elnbo- 
rated a method of solving this type of cipher system udhout making any assumptions of calues

d. The x test will now be applied to the horizontal rows of tallies in the distribution square, 
in accordance with the theory set forth in paragraph 49g. Since this test is purely statistical 
in character and becomes increasingly reliable as the size of the distributions increases, it is best 
to start by working with the two distributions 
having the greatest t.otal numbers of tallies, 
These are the V and W distributions, 
with 53 and 52 occurrences, respectively. 
The results of 
three relative displacements of these two distributions 
are shown below, labeled “First test,” 
“Second test,” and “Third test.”

c. Since the last of the three foregoing tests gives a value somewhat better than the expected 
.0667, it looks as though the correct position of the W distribution with reference to the V distribu- 
tion has been found. 
In practice, several more tests would be made to insure that other close 
approximations to -0667 will not be found, but these will here be omitted. 
The test indicates 
113

that the primary cipher component has the Ietten V and W in these positions: V . . W, since 
the correct superimposition requires that the 4th cell of the W distribution 
must be placed under 
the 1st cell of the V distribution 
(see the last superimposition above). 
f. The next best distribution with which to proceed is the F distribution, with 51 occurrences. 
Paralleling the procedure outlined .in paragraph 43, and for the same reasons, the F sequence 
is matched against the W and V sequences separately and then against both W and V sequences

The test yields the sequence V . . W . . . F . 
g. The process is continued in the foregoing manner until the entire primary cipher com- 
ponent has been reconstructed. 
It is obvious that as the work progresses the cryptanalyst 
is 
forced to employ smaller and smaller distributions, 
so that statistically 
the results are apt to 
become less and less certain. 
But to counterbalance this there is the fact that the number of 
possible superimpositions becomes progressively smaller as the work progresses. For example, 
at the commencement of operations the number of possible points for superimposing a second 
sequence against the first is 25; after the relative positions of 5 distributions 
have been ascer- 
tained and a 6th distribution 
is to be placed in the primary sequence being reconstructed, there 
are 21 possible positions; after the relative positions of 20 distributions have been ascertained, 
there are only 6 possible positions for the 21st distribution, 
and so on. 
h. In the foregoing case the completely reconstructed primary cipher component is as 
follows:

i. Of course, it is probable that in practical work the process of matching distributions 
would be interrupted soon after the positions of only a few letters in the primary component had 
been ascertained. 
For by tr”ying partially reconstructed sequences on the cipher text the skele- 
tons of some words would begin to show. 
By filling in these skeletons with the words suggested 
by them, the process of reconstruct,ing the components is much facilitated and hastened. 
j. The components having been reconstructed, only a moment or two is necessary to as- 
certain their initial position in enciphering the message. It is only necessary to justapose the 
t,wo components so as to give ‘(good” values for any one of the vertical distributions of Figure 14. 
This then gives the juxtaposition 
of the components for that, column, and the rest follows very 
easily for the plain text may now be obtained by direct use of the components.

k. The student should clearly understand the real nature of the matching process employed 
to such good advantage in this problem. 
In practically all the previous cases frequency distri- 
butions were made of cipher letters occurring in a cryptogram, and the tallies in those distribu- 
tions represented the actual occurrences of cipher letters. 
Furthermore, when these distribu- 
tions were compared or matched, what were being compared were actually cipher alphabets. 
That is, the text was arranged in a certain way, so that letters belonging to the same cipher alphabet 
actually fell within the same column and the frequency distribution 
for a specifk cipher alphabet 
was made by tabulating the letters in that column. 
Then if any distributions 
were to be com- 
pared, usually the entire distribution 
applicable to one cipher alphabet was compared with the 
entire distribution 
applying to another cipher alphabet. 
But in the problem just completed, 
what were compared in reality were not frequency distributions 
applying to the columns of the 
cipher text as transcribed on p. 83, but graphic representations of the variations in the frequencies 
of plain-texi 
letters falling 
in identical 
sequences, th 
idmtities 
of these plain-ted 
letters being 
unknown for the moment. Only after the reconstruction has been completed do their identities 
become known, when the plain text of the cryptogram is established.

51. Alternative 
method of solution-o. 
The foregoing method of solution is, of course, 
almost entirely statistical in nature. 
There is, however, another method of attack which should 
be brought to notice because in some cases the statistical method, involving the study of rela- 
tively large distributions, may not be feasible for lack of sufficient text. 
Yet in these cases there 
may be sufficient data in the respective alphabets to permit of some assumptions of values of 
cipher letters, or there may be good grounds for applping the probable-word method. 
The 
present paragraph will therefore deal with a method of solving progressive cipher systems which 
is based upon the application of the principles of indirect symmetry to certain phenomena arising 
from the mechanics of the progressive encipherment method itself. 
b. Take the two sequences below ond encipher the phrase FIRST BATTALION by the pro- 
gressive method, sliding the cipher component to the left one interval after each encipherment.

The two I’s in line (1) are 10 letters apart; reference to the cipher component will show that the 
interval between the cipher equivalent of the first I, (which happens to be I,) and the second I, 
(which is K,) ia 10. Consideration of the mechanics of the enciphering system soon shows why 
this is so: since the cipher component ia displaced one step with each encipherment, two identical 
letters n intervals apart in the plain text must yield cipher equivalents which are 7~ intervals 
apart in the cipher component. 
Examination 
of the data in lines (3) and (4), (5) and (6) will 
collhn 
this finding. 
Consequently, it would appear that in such a system the successful appli- 
cation of the probable-word method of attack, coupled within indirect symmetry, can quickly 
lead to the reconstruction of the cipher component.

d. Sow consider the repeated cipher letters in the example under b. There happens to be

Reference to the plain component will show that the plain-text letters represented by the three 
Y’s appear in the order N 0 . . . T, that is, reversed with respect to their order in the plain text. 
But the intervals between these letters is correct. 
Again a consideration of the mechanics of 
the enciphering system shows why this is so: evince the cipher component is displaced one step 
with each encipherment, two identical letters n intervals apart in the cipher text must represent 
plain-text letters which are n intervals apart in the plain component. 
In the present case the 
direction in which these letters run in the plain component is opposite to that in which the 
cipher component is displaced. 
That is, if the cipher component is displaced toward the left, 
the values obtained from a study of repeated plain-text letters give letters which coincide in 
sequence (interval end direction) with the same letters in the cipher component; the values 
obtained from e study of repeated cipher-text letters give letters the order of which must be 
reversed in order to make these letters coincide in sequence (interval and direction) with the 
same letters in the plain component. 
If the cipher component is displaced toward the right, this 
relationship is merely reversed: the values obtained from a study of the repeated plain-text 
letters must be reversed in their order when placing them in the cipher component; those yielded 
by a study of the repeated cipher-text letters are inserted in the plain component in their original 
order. 
e. Of course, if the primary components are identical sequences the data from the two 
sources referred to in subparagraphs c and d need not be kept separate but can be combined 
and made to yield the primary component very quickly. 
f. PTith the foregoing principles as background, and given the following message, which is 
assumed to begin with COh!MANDING GENERAL FIRST ARMY (probable-word method of attack), 
the data yielded by this assumed text are shown in Figure 15.

to it, these being two letters which until now could not be placed into position in the cipher 
component.

The word after ARMY is probably WILL. 
This leads to the insertion of the letter W in the plain 
component and G in the cipher component. 
In a short time both components can be completely 
established. 
g. ln passing, it may be well to note that in the illustrative 
message in paragraph 50a the 
very frequent occurrence of tripled letters 
(MM& m, 
FFF, etc.) indicates the presence of a 
frequently used short word, a frequently used ending, or the like, the letters of which are sequent 
in the plain component. 
An astute cryptanalyst 
who has noted the frequency of occurrence 
of such triplets could assume the value THE for them, go through the entire text replacing all 
triplets by THE, and then, by applying the principles of indirect symmetry, build up the plain 
component in a short time. 
With that much as a &art, solution of the entire message would be 
considerably simplified. 
h. The principles elucidated in this paragraph may, of course, also be applied to cases of 
progressive systems in which the progression is by intervals greater than 1, and, with necessary 
modifications, to cases in which the progression is not regular but follows a specific pattern, such 
as l-2-3, 
l-2-3, 
. . . , or 2-5-7-3-1, 
2-5-7-3-1, 
and so. The latter types of progression 
are encountered in certain mechanical cryptographs, the study of which will be resenrod for 
future texts.

62. Purpose of the 9 (phi) teat.-a. 
The student has noted that the x test is based upon the 
general theory of coincidences and employs the probability 
constants Kp and K~. There is one 
more teat of 8 related nature which may be useful for him to understand and its explanation 
wd be given in the succeeding par&gr&phS. 
b. In paragraph 48e it was stated that two monoalphabetic distributions 
when correctly 
combined will yield a single distribution 
which should still be monoalphabetic in character. 
This question &rises, therefore, in the student’s mind: Is there a test whereby he can ascertain 
methematically 
whether 8 distribution 
is monoalphabetic or not, especially in the case of one 
which has relatively few data? 
Such a test has been devised and is termed the “+ (phi) test.” 
63. Derivstion of the Q te8L-a. 
Consider a monographic.or uniliteral frequency distribution 
which is monoalphabetic in composition. 
If there is a total of N letters in the distribution 
iV(S- 
1,; 
in a system in which there are R. possible elements, then there is a possible total of --2 
pairs of letters (for comparison purposes). 
b. Let the symbolf, represent the number of occurrences of A, jB the number of occurrences 
of B, and so on to ji. 
With regard to the letter A then, there are j*y*-1) 
2 
coincidences. 
(Again 
the combinations of jA things taken two at a time.) 
With regard to the letter B, there are 
jw 
coincidences, and so on up to jzCf\-- l) coincidences for the letter Z. Xow it has been 
seen that according to the K test, in N(N- 
1) 
2 
comparisons of letters forming the two members 
of pairs of letters in normal English plain text, there should be 
K,A~(L~ 
- 1) 
2 
coincidences, where 
r,is the probability 
of monographic coincidence for the language in question. 
c. Now the expected value of -- 
jd(fAp

; . , . +z(,fz-1) 
2 
is equal to the theoret- 
ic8.l number of coincidences to be expected in IV&-

If for the left-hand side of equations (IX) and (X) the symbol E (+) is used, then these equations 
become: 
(XI) 
For plain text . . . E(aP)=~fi(N- 
1) 
(XII) 
For random text . . . E(@,) =K,~!(L\‘- 
1), 
where EC+) means the overage or expected value of the expression in the parenthesis, 
Kg and 
K, are the probabilities of monographic coincidence in plain and in random text, respectively. 
d. Sow in normal English plain text it hns been found that ~,=.0667. 
For random text 
of a 26-letter alphabet 
K,=.O38. 
Therefore, equations (XI) and (XII) 
may now be written 
thus: 
(XIII) 
For normal English plain text . . . E(aP) = .0667 2\r(N- 1) 
(XIV) 
For random test (26-letter alphabet) . . . E(%)=.0385 
N(N-1) 
e. By employing equations (XIII) 
and (XIV) it becomes possible, therefore, to test a piece 
of test for monoalphnbeticity 
or for “randomness.” 
That is, by using these equations one can 
mathematically 
test a very short crvptogram to ascertain whether it is a monoalphabetically 
enciphered substitution 
or involves several alphabets so that for all practical purposes it is 
equivalent to random text. 
This test has been termed the 0 test. 
54. Applying the + test---a. 
Given the following short piece of text, is it likely that it is 
normal English plain text enciphered monoalphabetically? 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
A-=25 
-2 
ss .= 
s> 
1 
‘= 
For this case the observed value of @ is: 
(lxo)+(~xo)+(2xl)-c( 
3X2)$(4X3)+(2X1)+(1X0)+(4X3)+(2X1)+(1X0)+(1X0)+ 
(3X2)=2+6+12+2+12+2+6=42 
If this text were monoalphabetically 
enciphered English plain text the expected value of @ is: 
E(@,)=Kp\r(,%--l)=.0667X25X24=40.0 
If the text were random text, the expected value of + is: 
The conclusion is warranted, therefore, that the cryptogram is probsbly monoalphabetic sub- 
stitution, 
since the observed value of @(42) more closely approximates the expected value for 
English plain text (40.0) than it does the expected value for random text (23.1). 
(As a mstter 
of fact, the cryptogram was enciphered monoalphabetically.) 
b. Here is another example. 
Given the following series of letters, does it represent a 
selection of English text enciphered monoalphabetic8lly 
or does it more nearly represent 8 
random selection of letters?

The distribution 
and calculation are as follows: 
ABCDEF$~IJ~LMNOPQRST~VWXYZ 
-2-N 
-3 
000200~600-02 
00 
.->a 
jcf-1) 
. . . 
0026 
- 
Zjcf-1)=18 
(That is, observed value of O=lS) 
E(+,)=.0667X25X24=40.0 
(That is, expected value of +p=40.0) 
The conclusion is that the series of letters does not represent a selection of English text mono- 
alphabetically 
enciphered. 
V&ether or noi it represents a random selection of letters cannot 
be told, but it may be said that if the letters actually do constitute a cryptogram, the latter is 
probably polyalphabetically 
enciphered. 
(As a matter of fact, the latter statement is true, for 
the message was enciphered by 25 alphabets used in sequence.) 
c. The 9 test is, of course, closely related to the x test and derives from the same general 
theory as the latter, which is that of coincidence. 
V&en two monoalphabetic distributions 
have been combined into a single distribution, 
the 9 test may be applied to the latter as a check 
upon the x test. 
It is also useful in testing the columns of a superimposition diagram, to ascer- 
tain whether or not the columns are monoalphabetic.

65. Concluding remarks 
on aperiodic 
substitution 
systems.---& The various systems 
described in the foregoing pages represent some of the more common and well-known methods 
of introducing 
complexities in the general scheme of .cryptograpbic substitution with the view 
to avoiding or suppressing periodicity. 
There are, of course, other methods for accomplishing 
this purpose, which, while perhaps a bit more complex from a practical point of view, yield more 
desirable results from a cryptographic point of view. 
That is, these methods go deeper into the 
heart of the problem of cryptographic 
security and thus make the task of the enemy crypt- 
analyst much harder. 
But studies based on these more advanced methods will have to be 
postponed at this time, and reserved for a later text. 
b. Thus far in these studies, aside from a few remarks of a very general nature, no attention 
has been paid to that other large and important class of ciphers, viz, transposition. 
It is desir- 
able, before going further with substitution methods, that the student gain some understanding 
of how to solve certain of the more simple varieties of transposition ciphers. 
Consequently, 
in the text to succeed the present text, the student %4ll temporarily lay aside the various 
useful 
methods and tools that he has been given for the solution of substitution ciphers and wih turn 
his thoughts toward the methods of breaking down transposition ciphers.

Cryptanalysis, the outline for the studies covered by Part III is shown on p. 119.

1. Introductory 
remarks.--u. 
In paragraph 33 of the text proper it was indicated that the 
method elucidated in paragraph 32 for solving plain-text auto-keyed ciphers is likely to be suc- 
cessful only if the cryptanalyst has been fortunate in his selection of a “probable word.” 
Or, to 
put it another way, if the “probable words” which his imagination leads him to assume to be 
present in t.he text are really not present, then he is unfortunntc, 
for solution 41 escape him. 
Hence, it is desirable to point out other principles and methotls whicii are not so subject to chance. 
But because most of these methods are applicable only in special cases and because in general it 
is true that auto-key systems are no longer commonly encountered in practical military cryptog- 
raphy, it was thought best to exclude the exposition of these principles and methods from the 
text proper and to add them in an nppendix, for the study of such students as find them of 
particular interest. 
b. A complete discussion of the solution of plain-text 
auto-key systems, with examples, 
would require a volume in itself. 
Only one or two methods will be described, therefore, leaving 
the development of additiond principles and methods to the ingenuity of the student who wishes 
to go more deeply into the subject. 
The discussion herein will be present,ed under separate 
headings, dependent upon the types of primary components employed. 
c. As usual, the types of primary components may be classified as follows: 
(1) Primary components are ident.ical. 
(a) Both components progress in the same direct,ion. 
(b) Both components progress in opposite directions. 
(2) Primary components are differen’t. 
2. Simple “mechanical” 
solution.--cz. (1) Taking up the case wherein the two identical 
primary components progress in the same direction, assume the following additihnal factors to 
be known by the cryptanalyst: 
(a) The primary components are both normal sequences. 
(b) The encipherment is by plain-text 
auto-keying. 
(c) The enciphering equations are: &=EI,~; 
0DI,=00/2. 
(2) A message beginning QVGLB TPJTF . . . is intercepted; the only unknown factor is 
the initial key letter. 
Of course, one could try to decipher the message using each key letter in 
turn, beginning with A and continuing until the correct key letter is tried, whereupon plain text 
will be obtained. 
But it seems logical to think that all the 26 possible “decipherment? 
might 
be derived from the first one, so that the process might be much simplified, and this is true, as

u-ill now be shown. 
Taking the two cipher groups under consideration, let them be “deciphered”

The deciphered test is certainly not “plain text.” 
But if one completes the sequences initiated 
by these letters, using the direct standard sequence for the even columns, the reversed atanderd 
for the odd columns, the plain text sequence is seen to reappear on one generatrix: It is HOSTILE 
FOR(CE). 
From this it appears that instead of going through the labor of making 26 successive 
trials, which would consume considerable time, all that is necessary is to have a set of strips 
bearing the normal direct sequence and another set bearing the reversed normal sequence, and 
to align the strips, alternately direct and reversed, to the first “decipherment.” 
The plain text 
will now reappear on one generatrix of the completion diagram.

b. The peculiar nature of the phenomenon just observed, da, a completion diagram with the 
vertical sequences in adjacent columns progressing in opposite directions, those in alternate 
columns in the same direction, calls for an explanation. 
Although the matter seems rather 
mysterious, it will not be hard to understand. 
First, it is not hard to see why the letters in 
column 1 of Figure 1 should form the descending sequence QPO. . . for these letters are merely

the ones redting 
from the eucceaive “decipherment” 
of Q, by the successive key letters A, B, 
c 
. . 
. Now since the “decipherment” 
obtained from the 1st cipher letter in any row in 
F’&e 
1 becomes the key letter for “deciphering” 
the 2d cipher letter in the same row, it is 
apparent that as the letters in the 1st column progress in a reversed normal (descending) order, 
the letters in the 2d column mu.& progress in a direct normal (ascending) order. 
The matter 
may perhaps become more clear if encipherment is regarded as a process of addition and de- 
cipherment 8s 8 process of subtraction. 
Instead of primary components or 8 Vigenere square, 
one may use simple arithmetic, assigning numerical values to the letters of the alphabet, begin- 
ning with A=8 and ending with 2=25. 
Thus on the basis of the pair of enciphering equations 
%=%l; 
%A=%, 
the letter H, enciphered by key letter Mk with direct primary components 
yields T,. 
But using the following numerical values: 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

23 
24 
21) 
the same result may be obtained thus: &(&)=7+12=19=T,. 
Every time the number 25 is 
exceeded in the addition, one subtracts 26 from it and finds the letter equivalent for the remain- 
der. 
In decipherment, the process is one of subtraction.’ 
For example: T,&=l9-12=7= 
l&; D&)=3-17=[(26+3)-17]=29-17=12=&. 
Using this 8rithmetical 
equivalent 
of 
normal sliding-strip encipherment, the phenomenon just noted can be set down in the form of a 
diagram (Fig. 2) which will perhaps make the matter clear. 
* It will be noted that if the letters of the alphabet 
are numbered from 1 to 26, in the usual manner, the 
arithmetical 
method must be modified in a minor particular 
in order to obtain the same results 88 are given by 
employing 
the normal Vigenere square. This modification 
consists merely in subtracting 
1 from the numerical 
value of the key letter.

d. (1) In the foregoing example the primary components were normal sequences, but the 
case of identical mixed components may be handled in a similar manner. 
Note the following 
example, based upon the following primary component (which is assumed to have been recon- 
structed from previous work):

(2) First. t,he message is “deciphered” 
with the initial key-letter 
A, and then a completion 
diagram is established, using sliding strips bearing the mixed primary component, alternate 
strips bearir,: the reversed sequence. -?;ote Figure 4, in which the plsin text. HOSTILE 
FOR( CE) . reappears on a single generatrix 
Note also that whereas in Figure 1 the odd columns 
contain the primary sequence in the reversed order, and the even columns contain the sequence 
in the direct order, in Figure 4 the situation is reversed: the odd columns contain the primsry 
sequence in tl!e direct order, and the even columns contain the sequence in the reversed order. 
This point is brought to notice to show that it is immaterial whether t,he direct order is used 
for odd columns or for even columns; the alternation 
in direction is all that is required in this 
type of solution. 
e. (1) There is next to be considered the case in which the two primary components progress 
in opposite directions [par. lc (1) (b)]. 
Here is a message, known to have been enciphered by 
reversed standard alphabets, plain-text 
auto-keying having been followed: 
XTWZLXHZRX 
(2) The procedure in this case is exactly the same as before, except that it is not necessary 
to have any alternation in direction of the completion sequences, which may be either that of 
the plain component or the cipher component. 
Note the solution in Figure 5. Let the student 
ascertain why the alternation in direction of the completion sequences is not necessary in this 
case. 
(3j In the foregoing case the alphabets were reversed standard, produced by the sliding 
of the normal sequence against its reverse. 
But the underlying principle of solution is the same 
even if a mixed sequence were used instead of the normal; so long &9 the sequence is known, the 
procedure to be followed is exactly the same as demonstrated in subparagraphs (1) and (2) hereof. 
Note the following solution:

Note here that the primary mixed sequence is used for the completion sequence and that the 
plain text, I4OSTILE FOR( CE) , comes out on one generatrix. 
It is immaterial whether the 
direct or reversed mixed component is used for the completion sequence, so long as aM the 
sequences in the diagram progress in the same direction.

Now prepare a strip bearing the cipher component rewrsed, and set it below the plain component 
so that F p=Ls, a setting given by the 1st two letters of the spurious “plain text” recovered. 
Thus:

Cipher __-- -__ FXONWLAVKMUJDTHESGIZQCRYPB 
(3) Now opposite esch letter of the completion sequence in column 1, write its plein- 
component equivalent, as given by the juxtsposed sequences above. 
This gives what is shown 
in Figure 7b. Then reset the two sequences (reversed cipher component and the plain com- 
ponent) so that 
Q,=F, 
(to correspond with the 2d and 3d letters of the spurious plain text); 
write down the plain-component 
equivalents of the letters in column 2, forming column 3. 
Continue this process, scanning the generatrices from time to time, resetting the two components 
and finding equivalents from column to column, until it becomes evident on what generatrix 
the plain text is reappearing. 
In Figure 7c it is seen that the plain text generatrix is the one 
beginning HOST, and from this point on the solution may be obtained directly, by using the 
two primary components.

(4) When the plain component is also a mixed sequence (and different from the cipher 
component), the procedure is identical with that outlined in subparagraphs (l)-(3) 
above. 
The fact that the plain component in the preceding case is t.he normal sequence is of no particular 
significance in the solution, for it acts as a mixed sequence would act under similar circumstances. 
To demonstrate, suppose the two following components were used in encipherment of the 
message below: 
Plain_~.--~----~-.-~ W B V I G X L H Y A J Z M N F 0 R P E Q D S C T K U

To sclve the message, “decipher” 
the text with any arbitrarily 
selected initial key letter and 
proceed exactly as in subparagraphs (2) and (3) above. 
Thus:

i’ote the completion diagram in Figure 8 which shows the word HOST. . . very soon in the 
process. From this point on the solution may be obtained directly, by using the two primary 
components.

3. Another “mechanical”

cryptanalytic 
sidelights.

and encipher it by plain-test

b. x-ow suppose the message has been intercepted and is to be solved. 
The only UI&LIOWJI 
factor will be sjsun:ed to be the initial key letter. 
Let the message be “deciphered” by means 
of nny initi:ll key letter,* say A, and then note the underscored repetitions in the spurious plai 
text.

c. Later on it will be seen how this m&hod of converting an 
auto-key cipher into a periodic cipher may be applied to the 
case where an introductory 
key word is used as the initial keying 
element instead of a single letter, aa in the present case.

d. The student has probably already noted that the phenomena observed in this sub- 
paragraph are the same as those observed in subparagraph 2b. 
In the latter subparagraph it 
was seen that the direction of the sequences in alternate columns had to be reversed in order 
to bring out the plain text on one generatrix. 
If this reversal is not done, then obviously the 
plain text would appear on :ZL’O 
generatrices, which is equivalent to having the plain text reduced 
to two monoalphabets. 
e. when reciprocal components are employed, the spurious plain text obtained by “decipher- 
ment” wit.h a key set,ting other than the actual one will be monoalphabetic throughout. 
Sote 
the following encipherment (with initial key setting A,=G,, usin g n reversed standard sequence 
sliding against the direct standard) and its ‘*decipherment” by setting these two components 
A,=A,. 
Plain text ___.___

______ P N Z B N N R L Y X Z Q D Y N Z B N N R. L Y . . . 
Spurious plain text-e L Y Z Y L Y H W Y B C M J L Y Z Y L Y H W Y . . . 
Here the spurious plain text is wholly monoalphabetic. 
f. The reason for the exception noted in footnote 2 on page 106 now becomes clear. 
For 
if the actual initial key letter (G) were used, of course the decipherment yields the correct plain 
text; if a letter 13 intervals removed from G is used as the key letter, the cipher alphabet selected 
for the first “decipherment” 
is the reciprocal of the real initial cipher alphabet and thereafter 
all alternate cipher alphabets are reciprocal. 
Hence the spurious t.ext obtained from such n 
‘Ldecipherment” must be monoalphabetic. 
g. In the foregoing case the primary components were identical normnl sequences progress- 
ing in the same direction. 
If they were mixed sequences the phenomena observed above would 
still hold true, and so long as the sequences are known, the indicated method of solution may be 
applied. 
h. V&en the two primary components are known but differently 
mixed sequences, this 
method of solution is too involved to be practical. 
It is more practicable to try successive 
initial 
key letters, noting the plain text each time and resetting the strips until the correct 
setting has been ascertained, as will be evidenced by obtaining intelligible plain text. 
4. Solution of plain-text auto-keyed cryptograms when the introductory 
key is a word or 
phrase.-a. 
In the foregoing discussion of plain-text 
auto-keying, 
the introductory 
key was 
assumed to consist of a single letter, so that the subsequent key letters are displaced one letter 
to the right with respect to the text of the message itself. 
But sometimes a word or phrase 
may serve this function, in which case the subsequent key is displaced as many letters to the 
right of the initial plain-text letter of the message as there are letters in the initial key. 
This 
will not, as a rule, interfere in any way with the application of the principles of solution set 
forth in paragraph 28 to that part of the cryptogram subsequent to the introductory 
key, and 
a solution by the probable-word method and the study of repetitions can be reached. 
However, 
it may happen that trial of this method is not successful in certain cryptograms because of the 
paucity of repetitions, or because of failure to find a probable word in the text. 
When the cipher 
alphabets are known there is another point of attack which is useful and interesting. 
The 
method consists in &nii.ng the length of the introductory 
key and then solving by frequency 
principles. 
Just how this is accomplished will now be explained. 
b. Suppose that the introductory 
key word is HORSECHESTNUT, 
that the plain-text message 
is as below, and that identical primary components progressing in the same direction are used

It will now be noted that since the introductory 
key contains 13 letters the 14th letter of the 
message is enciphered by the 1st letter of the plain text, the 15th by the 2d, and so on. 
Likewise, 
the 27th letter is enciphered by the 14th, the 28th by the 15th, and so on. 
Hence, if the 1st 
cipher letter is deciphered, this will give the key for deciphering the 14th, the latter will give 
the key for the 27th, and so on. 
An important step in the solution of a message of this kind 
would therefore involve ascertaining the length of the introductory 
key. 
This step will now 
be explained. 
c. Since the plain text itself constitutes the key letters in this systein (after the introductory 
key), these key letters will occur with their normal frequencies, and this means that there will 
be many occurrencea of E, T, 0, A, N, I, R, S, enciphered by &; there will be many occurrences 
of these same high-frequency Iettera enciphered by T,, by 4, by A,, and so on. 
In fact, the 
number of times each of these combinations will occur may be calculated statistically. 
With 
the enciphering conditions set forth under b above, & enciphered by T,, for example, will yield 
the same cipher equivalent aa T, enciphered by F;; in other words two enciphermenta of any 
pair of letters of which either may serve as the key for enciphering the other muat yield the same 
cipher resultant.’ 
It is the cryptographic 
effect of these two phenomena working together 
which permits of ascertaining the length of the introductory 
key in such a case. For every 
time a given letter ,0,, occurs in the plain text it will occur n letters later as a key letter, %, and 
n in this case equals the length of the introductory 
key. 
Note the following illustration: 
3 It ir important to note that the two componenb must be identical wqueacea and progreu in the aam 
direction. If this ia not the caoe, the entire ramming ir inapplicable.

Here it will be not,ed that E, in line (2) has a T, on either side of it, at a distance of 13 intervals; 
the tist encipherment (E, by T,) yields the same equivalent (X,) as the second encipherment 
(T, by E+). Two cipher letters are here identical, at an interval equal to the length of the intro- 
ductory key. 
But the converse is not true; that is, not eoery pair of identical letters in the cipher 
text represents a case of this type. 
For in this system identity 
in two cipher letters may be 
the result of the follow 
three conditions each having a statistically 
ascertainable probability 
of occurrence: 
(1) A given plain-text letter is enciphered by the same key letter two different limes, at an 
int.erval which is purely accidental; the cipher equivalents are identical but could not be used 
t,o give any information about the length of the introductory 
key. 
(2) Two different plain-text letters are enciphered by two different key letters; the cipher 
equivalents are fortuitously 
identical. 
(3) A given plain-text letter is enciphered by a given key letter and later on the same plain- 
text letter serves to encipher another plain-text letter which is identical M-ith the first keJ letter; 
the cipher equivalents are causally identical. 
It can be proved that the probability 
for identities of the third type is greater than that for 
identities of either or both 1st and 2d types for that intercal which corresponds with the length 
of the in.troductoq 
key; that is, if a tabulation is made of the intervals betI%-een identical letters in 
such a system as the one being studied, the interval which occurs most frequently should coincide 
with the length of the introductory 
key. 
The demonstration of the mathematical basis for this 
fact is beyond the scope of the present text; but a practical demonstration will be convincing.

message be transcribed in lines of say 11, 12, and 13 letters, as b

In each transcription, 
every pair of superimposed letters is noted and the number of identities 
is indicated by ringing the letters involved, as shown above. 
The number of identities for an 
assumed introductorr-kev 
length 13 is 9, as against 3 for the assumption of a key of 11 letters, 
., 
and 5 for the assumption of a key of 12 let,ters. 
e. Once having found the length of the int.roductory key, two lines of attack are possible: 
the composition of the key may be studied, which u-ill yield sufficient plain text to get a start 
toward solution; or, the message may be reduced to periodic terms and solved as a repeating-key 
cipher. 
The first line of attack will be discussed first, it being constantly borne in mind in this 
paragraph that the entire discussion is based upon the assumption that the cipher alphabets 
are known alphabets. 
The illustrative 
message of b above will be used. 
5. Subsequent steps after determining the length of the introductory key.-a. 
-4ssume that 
the first letter of the introductory 
key is A and decipher the 1st cipher letter T, (with direct 
standard alphabets). 
This yields T, and the latter becomes the key letter for the 14th letter of 
the message. The 14th letter is deciphered: D, (Tr)=K,; 
the latter becomes the key letter for 
the 27th letter and so on, down the entire first column of the message as transcribed in lines of 
13 letters. 
The same procedure is followed using B as the initial key letter, then C, and so on. 
The message as it appears for the first three trials (assuming A, B, then C as the initial key letter) 
is shown in Figure 11.

b. Inspection of the results of these three trials soon shows that the entire series of 26 
trials need not be made, for the results can be obtained from the very frrst trial. 
This may be 
shown graphically 
by superimposing merely the results of the first three trials horizontally. 
Thus:

c. It will be noted that the vertical sequences in adjacent columns proceed in opposite 
directions, whereas those in alternate columns proceed in the same direction. 
The explanation 
for this alternation 
in progression is the same as in the 
previous case wherein this phenomenon was encountered 
(par. 2b), and the sequences in Figure 12 may now be 
completed very quickly. 
The diagram becomes as shown 
in Figure 13.

d. One of the horizontal lines or generatrices of figure 
13 is the correct one; that is, it contains the actual plain- 
text equivalents of the lst, 14th, 27th, . . . letters of the 
message. The correct generatrix can be selected by mere 
ocular examination, 
as is here possible (see generatrix 
marked by asterisk in Fig. 13), or it may be selected by a 
frequency test, assigning weights to each letter according 
to its normal .plain-text 
frequency. 
(See par. 14f of 
Military 
Cryptanulysis, 
Part II.) 
e. Identical procedure is followed with respect to columns 2, 3, 4, . . . of Figure lOc, with 
the result that the initial key word HORSECHESTNUT is reconstructed and the whole message 
may be now deciphered quite readily.

6. Conversion of foregoing aperiodic cipher into periodic forms-a. 
In paragraph 4 it waa 
stated that an aperiodic cipher of the foregoing type may be reduced to periodic terms and 
solved as though it were a repeating-key cipher, provided the primary components are known 
sequences. The basis of the method lies in the phenomena noted in paragraph 2b. 
An example 
will be given. 
b. Let the cipher text of the message of paragraph 4b be set down again, as in Figure 10~:

Using direct standard alphabets (Vigenere method), “decipher”

as key letters. 
Then use the thus-found “plain text” as “key le&ters” and “decipher” the third

c. R-hen the underlined repetitions in Figures 15 and 16 are compared, they are found to be 
identicL1 in the respective columns, and if the columns of Figure 15 are tested, they will be found 
to be monoalphabetic. 
The cipher message now gives every indication of being a repeating-key 
cipher. 
It is not di5cult 
to explain this phenomenon in the light of the demonstration given in 
paragraph 3g. First, let the key word HORSECHESTNUT 
be enciphered by the following alphabet: 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
AZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCB 
“Plain” _________________ 
H 0 R S E C H E S T N U T 
“Cipher” _______________ 
T M J I W Y T W I H N G H 
Then let the message MY LEFT FLANK, etc., be enciphered by direct standard alphabets as 
before, but for the ke:r add the monoalphabetic equivalents of HORSECHESTNUT 
TMJIW. . . to 
the key itself, that is, use the 26-letter key HORSECHESTNUTTMJIWYTWIHNGH 
in a repeating-key 
manner.

The cipher resultants of this process of enciphering a message coincide exactly with those obtained 
from the “&ciphering” 
operation that gave rise to Figure 15. How does this happen?

d. First, let it be noted that the sequence TMJI . . . , which forms the second half of the 
key for enciphering the text in Figure 17 may be described as the standard alphabet complement 
of the sequence HORSECHESTNUT, w&h 
forms the first half of that key. 
Arithmetically, 
the 
sum of a letter of the first half and its homologous letter in the second half is 26. Thus: 
H+T= 
7+19=26=0 
O+M=14+12=26=0 
R+J=17+ 
9=26=0 
S+I=lS+ 
8=26=0 
E+W= 
4+22=26=0 
That 
is, every letter 
of HORSECHESTNUT plus its homologous letter of the sequence 
TMJIWYTYIHNGH equals 26, which is here the same as zero. In other words, the sequence 
TMJIWYTVIHNGH is, by cryptographic 
arithmetic, 
equivalent 
to “minus HORSECHESTNUT.” 
Therefore, 
in 
Figure 
17, enciphenng 
the second half of each line by the key letters 
TMJIPlYTWIHNCH (i. e., adding 19, 12, 9, 8, . . . ) is the same as deciphering by the key letters 
HORSECHESTNUT (i. e., subtracting 7, 14, 17, 18, . . . ). 
For example: 
R,(Tr)=17+19=36=lO=K, 
and 
R,(-Hr)=17-7=10=K 
&&)=4+12=16=Q,, 
and 
E,(-Or)=4-14=(26-l-4)-14=16=Q,, 
and so on. 
e. Refer now to Figure 15. The letters in the first half of line 1, beginning TMCWJ . . . 
are identical with those in the first half of line 1 of Figure 17. They must be identical because 
they are produced from identical elements. 
The letters in the second half of this same line in 
Figure 15, beginning KQLME . . . were produced by &ciphering 
the letters in the second line 
of Figure 10~. Thus (taking for illustrative 
purposes only the first five letters in each case): 
KQLME=DCNIN-TMCWJ 
But 
DCNIN= 
RECEI+MYLEF 
And 
TMCWJ= 
MYLEFfHORSE 
Hence, 
K Q L M E = (RECEI+MYLEF)-(MYLEF+HORSE) 
Or, 
KQLME=RECEI-HORSE 
(1) 
As for the letters in the second half of line 1 of Figure 17, also beginning KQLME . . . , these 
letters were the result of enciphering RECEI by TMJIW. 
Thus: 
KQLME= 
RECEI+TMJIW 
But it has been shown in subparagraph d above that 
TMJIW=-HORSE 
Hence, 
K Q L M E = RECEI 
+ 
(-HORSE) 
Or, 
KQLME=RECEI-HORSE 
(2) 
Thus, equations (1) and (2) turn out to be identical but from what appear to be quits diverse 
sources. 
j. What has been demonstrated in connection with the letters in line 1 of Figures 15 and 
17 holds true for the letters in the other lines of these two figures, and it is not necessary to 
repeat the explanation. 
The steps show that the originally aperiodic, auto-key cipher hsa been

converted, through a knowledge of the primary components, into a repeating-key cipher with a 
period twice the length of the introductory 
key. 
The message may now be solved as an ordinary 
repeating-key cipher. 
g. (1) The foregoing case is based upon encipherment 
by the enciphering equations 
%z=Q,,*; 
%l=eo/2- 
then 
encipherment by the enciphering equations &n=8,n 
; &,,2=Oen 
has been followed, the conversion of a plain-text auto-keyed cipher yields a repeating-key cipher 
with a period equal to the length of the introductory 
key. 
In this conversion, the enciphering 
equations ern=O,,l; epll=& 
are used in finding equivalents. 
(2) An example may be useful. 
Note the encipherment of the following message by 
auto-key method by enciphering equations &fl=8,,1; 
8,n=8,n.

(3) If the message is w&ten out in lines corresponding to the length of the introductory 
key, and each line is enciphered by the one directly above it, using the enciphering equat,ions 
%2=%/l; 
eDI1=OclZ in fmding equivalents, the results are as shown in Figure 22b. But if the 
same message is enciphered by equations hn=el,,; 
$,/2=ecll, 
using the word TUESDAY as a 
repeating key, the cipher text (Fig. 18~) is identical with that obtained in Figure 18b by encipher- 
ing each successive line with the line above it.

(4) ?u’ow note that the srquences joined by arrows in Figure 18 b and c are identical and since 
it is certain that Figure 1% is periodic in form because it was enciphered by the repeating-kcp 
method, it follows that Figure 18b is now also in periodic form, and in that form the message 
could be solved as though it were a repeating-key cipher. 
h (1) In case of primary components consist,ing of a direct normal sequence sliding against 
a reversed normal (r. S. Army disk), the process of converting the auto-key text to periodic 
terms is accomplished by using two direct normal sequences and “deciphering” 
each line of the 
text (as transcribed in periods) by the line above it. 
For example, here is a message auto- 
enciphered by the aforementioned disk, wit.h the initial key word TUESDAY: 
TUESDAY~INFORMATIONFROMRELIABLESOURCESINDIC 
INFORMATIONFROMRELIABLESOURCESINDICATESTHE 
LHZEMOYPFRBMVMHRKCXRNBNMXOJZHMKBRJAEZEVKBY 
(2) The cipher text is transcribed in periods equal to the length of the initial key word 
(7 letters) and the 2d line is “deciphered” 
with key letters 01 the 1st line, using enciphering 
equations ek,2= e,,, ; ep,l= ec,l. ‘lhe resultant letters are then used as key letters to “decipher” 
the 3d line of text and so on. 
I he results are as seen in Figure 19b. l”;ow let the original mes- 
sage be enciphered in repeating-key manner 
by the disk, with the key word TUESDAY, and the 
result, is Figure 19~. Note that the odd or alternate lines of Figure 19b and c are identical, 
showing that the auto-key test has been converted into repeating-key text.

i. The foregoing procedures indicate a simple method of solving ciphers of t,he foregoing 
t.ypes, when the primary components or the secondary cipher alphabets are known. 
It consists 
in assuming introductory 
keys of various lengths, converting the cipher text into repeating-key 
form, and then examining the resulting diagrams for repetitions. 
m%en a correct key length is 
assumed, repetitions will be as numerous as should be e.xpected in ciphers of the repeating-key 
class; incorrect assumptions for key length will not show so many repetitions. 
3. All the foregoing presupposes a knowledge of the cipher alphabets involved. 
V&en these 
are unknown, recourse must be had to first principles and the messages must be solved purely 
upon the basis of probable words, and repetitions, as outlined in paragraphs 27-28.

1. Introductory 
remarks concerning transposition ciphers.--a. 
-4s stated in a previous text, 
transposition ciphers are roughly analogous to “jigsaw puzzles” in that all the pieces of which 
the original is composed are present but are merely disarranged. 
The pieces into which the 
picture forming the basis of a jigsaw puzzle may be divided are usually quite irregular in size 
and shape; the greater the amount of irregularity, 
as a rule, the greater the difficulty in reas- 
sembling the pioces in proper order. 
In this respect, too, transposition ciphers are analogous to 
jigsaw puzzles, for the greater the amount of distortion to which the plain text is subject,ed in 
the transposition process, the more difficult becomes the solution. 
b. In jigsaw puzzles there is usually no regularity 
about the size of the individual 
pieces 
into which the original picture has been cut, and this feature, of course, materially contributes 
to the difficulty in reconstructing 
the picture. 
There are, to be sure, limits (dictated by con- 
siderations of practicability) 
which serve to prevent the pieces being made too small, for then 
they would become unmanageable; on the other hand, there are also limits which must be ob- 
served in respect to the upper magnitude of the pieces, for if they are made too large the puzzle 
becomes too easy to solve. 
These features of jigsaw puzzles also have their analogies in trans- 
position methods. 
In the latter, if the text.ual units to be subjected to transposition are made 
quite large, say entire sentences, t.he difficulties a cryptanalyst 
will have in reconstructing the 
text are practically 
nil; on the other hand, if these textual units are made quite small, even 
smaller than single letters,’ then the reconstruction of the transposition text by a cryptanalyst 
often becomes a very difficult matter. 
In between these two extremes there may be various 
degrees of fragmentation, limited only by considerations of practicability. 
c. It is fortunate, however, that the cryptanalyst. does not, as a rule, have to contend with 
problems in which the size of the textual units varies within the same message, as is the case in 
jigsaw puzzles. 
It is perhaps possible to devise a transposition 
system in which the text is 
divided up in such a manner that entire sentences, whole words, syllables, individual letters, and 
fractions of letters form the units for transposition; but it is not difficult to imagine how imprac- 
tical such a scheme would be for regular communication, and it may be taken for granted that 
such irregularity 
in size of textual units will not be encountered in practical communication. 
d. The days when the simple methods of word transposition were sufficient for military 
purposes have long since passed by, and it is hardly to be expected that cryptograms of such 
ineffectual nature will be encountered in the military communications of even the smaller armies 
of today. 
However, in time of emergency, when a counter-espionage censorship is exercised over 
internal communications, it is possible that isolated instances of simple word transposition may 
be encountered. 
The solution of such cases should present no diEculties, unless numerous code 
names and nulls are also used in the cryptograms. 
Mere experimentation with the cryptograms, 
trying various types and sizes of rectangles, will usually disclose the secret text. 
If code names

systems.

are used and the context gives no clur to the identity of the persons or places mentioned, it rnnF 
be necessary to wait until additional messages become available, or, lacking such a possibility, 
there is usually sufficient justification, 
under the exigencies of war, to compel the correspondents 
to reveal the meaning of these code names. 
e. Although transposition ciphers, as a general rule, are much less complex in their mechanics 
than are substitution 
ciphers, the cryptanalyst 
usually experiences a feeling of distaste and 
dismay when confronted with unknown ciphers of this category. 
There are several reasons for 
his dislike for them. 
In the first place, although transposit,ion ciphers are admittedly less intricate 
than substitution ciphers, as a general rule there are not nearly so many cryptanalytic 
t’ools and 
“tricks” 
to be used in the solution of the former as there are in the latter, and therefore the 
mental stimulus and sat’isfact,ion which the cryptanalyst usually derives and regards as part of the 
reward for his hard labor in solving a cipher is often missing in the case of transposit,ion ciphers. 
In the second place, despite their lack of comple.xity, the solution of transposition ciphers often 
involves a tremendous amount of time and labor most of which commonly turns out to be 
fruitless experimentation. 
Thirdly, 
in modern military 
communication, transposition methods 
are usually not employed alone but in conjunction with substitution 
methods-and 
then the 
problems may become difficult indeed, for usually before the substitution 
can be attacked it is 
necessary first to uncover the transposition. 
Finally, in working with transposition ciphers a 
much higher degree of accuracy in mere mechanical operations is required than in working with 
substitution 
ciphers, because the accidental omission or addition of a single letter will usually 
necessitate rewriting 
the work sheets applying to entire messages and starting afresh. 
Thus, 
this sort of work calls for a constant state of concentrated attention, with its resulting state of 
psychological tension, which takes its toll in mental wear and tear. 
2. Basic mechanism of transposition ciphers.+. 
Basically, all transposition ciphers involve 
at least two processes: (1) Writing the plain-text units (usually single letters) within a specific 
regular or irregular two-dimensional 
design called a “matrix,” 
“cage,” “frame,” 
“rectangle,” 
etc., in such a prearranged manner that the said units are distributed 
regularly or irregularly 
throughout 
the various cells or subsections of that design; (‘2) removing the plain-text 
units 
from the design in such a prearranged manner as to change the original sequence in which they 
followed one another in the plain text, thus producing cipher text. 
Since the first process consists 
of inscribing the text within the design, it is technically referred to as the process of inscription: 
and since the second process consists of transcribing 
the text from the design, it is technically 
referred to as that of transcription. 
Either or both processes may be repetitive, by prearrange- 
ment of course, in which case the intermediate steps may be referred to as processes of rescription, 
or rescriptive processes. 
b. It is hardly necessary at this point to give the student any indications as to how to 
differentiate a transposition from a substitution 
cipher. 
If a review is necessary, however, he 
is referred to Section IV of Military 
Cryptanalysis, 
Part I. 
3. lldonophase and polyphase transposition.-u. 
As may be inferred from the foregoing 
definitions, when a transposition system involves but a single process of inscription, followed by 
a single process of transcription, 
the system may be referred to as monophuse transposition, 
commonly called single tran.spos&on. 
When one or more rescriptive processes intervene between 
the original inscription and the final transcription 
the system may be referred to as polyphase 
transposition. 
As a general rule, the solution of the latter type is much more difficult than the 
former, especially when the successive transpositions are theoretically correct in principle. 
b. Any system which is suited for monophase transposition is also usually suited for polyphase 
transposition, 
the processes of inscription, 
rescription 
and transcription 
being accomplished 
with the same or with different keys.

4. Simple types of transposition.--a. 
The simple cases of reversed writing, vertical writing, 
or rail fence writing hardly require serious attention, since they may be solved almost by inspec- 
tion. 
These methods are included here only because they may be encountered in censorship 
operations. 
b. The low degree of cryptographic security afforded by these methods may be increased to 
a slight degree by adding nulls or by disguising the original word lengths, and regrouping into 
false words or into groups of regular length. 
c. Some examples of these simplest types of transposition 
follow. 
Let the message be: 
BRIDGE DESTROYED AT ELEVEN PM. 
(1) Reversing only the words and retaining original word lengths: 
Cipher--- E G D I R B 
D E Y 0 R T S E D 
T A 
N E V E L E M P 
(2) Reversing only the words and regrouping into false word lengths:

(3) Reversing the whole text and regrouping into fives: 
Cipher--- M P N E V

G D I R B 
(4) Reversing the whole text, regrouping into fives, and inserting a null in every fifth position:

These simple types can be solved merely by inspection. 
5. The principles 
of solution of nniliteral 
route-transposition 
ciphers.--a. 
The so-called 
uniliteral 
route-transposition 
methods are next to be examined. 
The solut,ion of cryptograms 
enciphered by these methods is a matter of experimenting with geometric figures, usually rec-

4 
tangles, of various dimensions suggested by the total number of letters in the message, then 
inspecting these rectangles, searching for whole words or the framents 
of words by reading 
horizontally, diagonally, vertically, spirally, and so on.’ 
(See Special Test So. 165, Elementary 
Military 
Cryptography, 
1935, pars. 20, 21.) 
b. The amount of experimentation that must be performed in the solution of ciphers of this 
type may be materially shortened by means of formulae and tables constructed for the purpose. 
But because ciphers of this t,ype are of infrequent occurrence today, these formulae and tables 
are only occasionally useful and hence they have not been included in this text .’ 
6. Keyed columnar transposition 
with completely-filled 
rectangles.-a. 
In practical cryp- 
tography, the dimensions of the transposition rectangle, as a general rule, cannot vary between 
large limits; that is, it can be assumed in practice that rectangles based upon lines of writing 
containing less than 5 letters or more than 25 letters will not commonly be encountered. 
If the 
width, that is, the number of columns, is determined by a key, t,hen the number of rows becomes 
a function of the length of the message to be enciphered. 
If the latter is very long, longer than 
can be conveniently handled without too many errors, it is a common practice to break up a 
message into two or more parts and treat each part as though it were a separate communication. 
Such parts are commonly termed sections. 
b. When the last row of a transposition rectangle is completely filled, the solution of the 
resulting cryptogram is considerably more simple than when this is not the case.3 Conse- 
quently, this will the constitute first case to be studied. 
1 It is interesting 
to observe that Daniel, of Biblical 
fame, was apparently 
the firat cryptanalyst 
in history 
(as well as one of the earliest interpreters 
of dreams), for he solved the cryptogram 
in the “handwriting 
on the 
wall,” 
obtaining 
as his decipherment 
words which he interpreted 
as predicting 
the downfall of BclGhazzar and 
his dynasty 
(Daniel V: l-28). 
The following partial account of the episode is not, as enlightening as one might 
wish, but it is probably 
the best explanation 
available. 
It, is taken from Dr. Max SelipFohn’s article on the sub- 
ject in The Jeuish Encyclopedia, vol. 8, pp. 490-491 (1925): ‘%ENE. m, 
TEKEL, UPHARSIN (~O~Dl 3pn X22 WD) 
Words written by a mysterious hand on the walls of Belshazzar’s palace, and interpreted 
by Daniel as predicting 
the doom of the King and his dynasty. 
The incident is described as follows: Once when King Belshazzar was 
banqueting 
with his lords and drinking 
wine from the golden vessel5 of the temple of THWH, 
a man’s hand was 
seen writing 
on the wall certain mysterious 
words. 
Frightened 
by the apparition, 
the King ordered his: astrol- 
ogers to explain 
the inscription; 
but they were unable to read it. 
Daniel was then summoned to the Royal 
Palace, and the King promised him costly presents if he could decipher the inscription. 
Daniel read it “ Mene, 
mene, tekel, upharsin,” 
and explained 
it to mean that God had “numbered” 
the Kingdom 
of Belshazzar and 
brought it, to an end; that the King had been weighed and found wanting; 
and that his Kingdom 
was divided 
and given to the hledes and Persians. 
The first question which presents itself to the critic, namely, why could the inscription 
be deciphcted by 
Daniel 
only-engaged 
the attention 
of the Talmudists, 
who advanced 
various 
answers. 
Certain 
of them 
concluded that the Hebrew writing 
had been changed in the time of Ezra, so that even the Jews that were 
found in the royal court could not read an inscription 
written 
in archaic characters. 
But those who followed 
R. Sirneon in maintaining 
that the writing 
had not changed found other solutions for t.he problem; e. II. it was 
written in the cryptographic 
combination 
m m, each letter of each pair being substituted 
by its companion, 
e. 9. aan 1X ttx M nU’; or the words were written 
thus: ~~~ 
‘Dpll PVIIJO, one above the other, having to be 
read vertically; or lWO9 np5 BM “, 
each word backward; or again, VW 5nP Xm XP the first two letters of 
each word being transposed (Sanh. 22~). 
It is evident that the author of the Book of Daniel meant that the 
inscription was written in characters familiar 
to the King and wise men of Babylon, but that, as often happens 
with ancient inscriptions, 
the transposition 
of certain letters baffled every attempt 
to decipher them. . . .”

c. In solving a cryptogram of this type the first step taken by the cryptanalyst is to ascertain 
the dimensions of the rectangle. 
Clues for this are usually afforded by finding the factors of 
the total number of letters in the cryptogram. 
Suppose the cryptogram contains 132 letters. 
The dimensions of the transposition rectangle may be 4x38 or 8X 19, by which is meant that 
four hypotheses may be made w-ith respect to it,s dimensions. 
The rectangle may consist of: 
(1) 4 columns with 38 rows, or 
(2) 38 columns 
with 4 rows. or 
(3) 8 columns with 19 rows, 
or 
(4) 19 columns with 8 rows. 
In practical work it is rather unlikely to encounter a rect,angle t’hat conforms to hypothesis (1) 
or (2), and for the present these may be discarded. 
As to choosing between hypotheses (3) and 
(4), a rather simple test to be described presently will disclose which is the more probable. 
.d. It is obvious that if the cryptogram is transcribed within a rectangleof thecorrect dimen- 
sions, the letters in each row will be the ones which actually were in those rows in the original 
transposition rectangle and formed good plain text therein. 
In fact, the rows of letters in the 
correctly-dimensioned 
rectangle would read plain text were it not for the transposition 
which they hare 
undergone within 
the TOWS. Therefore, the rows of a correctly-dimensioned 
rectangle are more 
likely to manifest the expected vou-el-consonant proportions of normal plain text than are the 
rows of an incorrectly-dimensioned 
rectangle, because in the latter case there are brought into 
some of the rows letters which belong to other rows and which are likely to disturb the normal 
vowel-consonant proportions of plain t,ext . That is, in an incorrectly-dimensioned 
rectangle 
some of the rows will have too many consonants and not enough vowels, in other rows this 
relationship will be reversed; whereas in a correctly-dimensioned rectangle each row u-ill have the 
proper number of vowels and consonants. 
Hence in solving an unknown cryptogram of this 
type, if a count is made of t’he vowels and consonants in t.he rows of rectangles of various probable 
dimensions, that rectangle in which the rows show the best proportions of vowels and consonants 
is most likely to be correct, and the one that should be tried first. 
e. Having ascertained the correct dimensions of the rectangle by the foregoing procedure, 
the next step is to experiment with the columns of the rectangle, trying to bring together several 
columns which will then show “good” digraphs, trigraphs, or polygraphs in the TOWS formed by 
juxtaposing the columns. 
This process of combining or matching columns in order to build up 
these fragments of plain text will herein be referred to as anugramming.’ 
j. The procedure is to select a column which has a good assortment of high-frequency letters 
and fmd another column which may be placed before or after the selected column to build up 
high-frequency 
digraphs in the rows; when such a pair of columns has been found, attempt is 
made to add another column before or after this pair to build up high-frequency trigraphs, and 
so on, gradually building up longer and longer polygraphs until entire words begin to appear in the 
respective rows of the rectangle. 
In this process of anagramming, advantage may be taken 
of simple mathematical considerations such as adding the normal plain-text frequency values of the 
digraphs in the rows to assist in discarding combinations which are on the borderline of choice. 
However, it must be noted that the totals obtained by simple addition of the frequency values of 
4 The Standard Dictionary 
defines the word anagram as follows: “(noun) 
1. 
The letters of a word or phrase so 
transposed as to make a different word or phrase; as, ‘time’ and ‘mite’ are anagrams of ‘emit’. 
2. A transposition; 
interchange.” 
As a verb, it is defined as “to anagrammatize; 
to make an anagram of; make anagrams.” 
(The 
construction 
of anagrams w-as a very widespread pastime in previous centuries. 
See Wheatley’s 
Of Anagrams, 
London, 1862.) 
A strict interpretation 
of the word would therefore confine it to cases wherein the letters to be 
rearranged already form bonafide words or intelligible 
phrases. 
However, this would hardly be broad enough for 
cryptanaWic purposes. 
As used in cryptanalysis 
the word is commonly employed as a verb to refer to theproc- 
es.8 of rearranging the disordered letters of cipher text so as to reconstruct the original plain test.

the digTaphs should be considered only as rough approximations or guides in weighing probabil- 
ities in favor of one hypothesis as against another, for theoretically the probability of the simul- 
taneous occurrence of two or more independent’ events is the product, and not the sum, of their 
respective probabilities. 
In most cases the calculation of products involves an amount, of labor 
unwarranted by the results to be expected, so that simple addition of probabilities is usually 
sufficient. 
However, if tables of the logarithms of the probabilities are readily available, the 
addition 
of these logarithms becomes a simple matter and affords a more accurate guide in selec- 
tion of combinations produced in the anagramming process.’ 
Once a set of four or five columns 
has been correctly assembled it is usually the case that, the process may be completed very quickly, 
for with the placement of each column the number of remaining columns possible for selection 
diminishes; t,oward the close of the process, when only two or t,hree columns remain, their place- 
ment is almost automatic. 
g. It is desirable, as a final st,ep, to try to reconstruct, if possible, the literal key from which 
the numerical transposition key was derived.

b. The cryptogram contains 126 letters (factors of 126: 2, 3, 6, 7,9, 14, 18,21), suggesting 
rectangles of 7X 18 or 9X 14. If the former dimensions are taken, the rectangle may have 7 
columns a.nd 18 rows or 18 columns and 7 rows; if the latter dimensions are taken, it, may have 9 
columns and 14 rows or 14 columns and 9 rows. 
The factors of 126 do not, of course, preclude 
the possibility tbat the rectangle may be 6X21, that is, with 21 columns and 6 rows or 6 columns 
and 21 rows. 
If no good results were obtained by testing rectangles of the dimensions indicated 
(7x18 or 9X14), t,hen one would proceed to test rectangles 6X21. 
In the event that all tests on 
the basis of a completely-med 
rectangle failed, then it would be assumed that the rectangle may 
be incompletely filled. 
In making the vowel-consonant test described in paragraph 6d, it is 
advisable to base the count on the columns as well as on the rows of a rectangle, since it is possible 
that the cryptogram was prepared by inscribing the plain text in rows and transcribing the text 
from the columns, or vice ~ersu. After examining a rectangle both horizontally 
and vertically, 
it is often possible to discard various arrangements without further tests. For-example, at A 
in figure 1 there is shown a rectangle of 7 columns and 18 rows. 
Now in a row of 7 letters there 
should be (7X40 percent=2.8) 
either 2 or 3 vowels; but rows 12 and 15 contain no vowels at all 
and rows 8 and 9 contain 5 vowels, row 16,6 vowels. 
It is concluded at once that this arrange- 
ment is highly improbable. 
If the plain text had been inscribed vertically in this same rectangle, 
and then the rows had been transposed in forming the cipher text, then in each column (18 letters) 
there should be (18X40 percent=7.2) 
about 7 vowels; but column 2 contains 11 vowels and col- 
umn 6 only 4. This likewise indicates that it is highly improbable that the message was inscribed 
vertically apd the cryptogram formed by transposing the rows. 
But when the arrangement at

principle makes practicable

for the purpose of speeding up and facilitating 
the 
matching of columns in the anagramming 
process.

B in figure 1 is studied, it is not so easy to say at once that it is improbable. 
For in 18 letters 
there should be about 7 vowels and none of the rows of this arrangement shows too great :I 
departure from this expected number. 
This possibility will have to be esplored further and it 
is for the moment put aside. If it be assumed that the message was inscribed verticnlly in the 
rectangle 18X7 and the rows subjected t,o transposition, there should be (7X40 percent=3.8) 
2 or 3 vowels in each column. 
But since several of the columns show rather considerable depar- 
tures from this expected number, it may be concluded that a vertica.1 inscription ant1 horizontal 
transcription 
is not probable and this assumption may be eliminated. 
Then the arrangements 
at C and D in figure 1 are studied in the same manner, with the result that at the end of the study 
t,he situation as regards the various assumptions is aummerized as follows:

of anagramming applied. 
(For this it is best to have the cryptogram written on cross-section 
paper preferably with >44nch squares for ease in handling.) 
Consider column 7, with the letter 
J in row 5; this letter, if it is a part of a word, must be followed by a vowel, which eliminates 
columns 1, 3, 4, and 5 as possibilities for placement on the right of column 7. Here are the 
digraphs formed b y combining column 7 with columns 2,6,8, and 9, respectively, and the totals 
obtained by adding the frequency values of the digraphs formed in the rows:

values for the digraphs were summed. 
The second greatest total was for combination (2) in 
which columns 7 and 6 were put together. 
The infrequent digraph J U suggests a word such as 
JUST or JUNCTION. If it were the former there should be a column containing an S in the 5th row, 
and there is no such column. 
If the word is JUNCTION, there should be a column containing an N 
in the 5th row, and there is only one such column, the 3d. Placing column 3 after columns i-6 
gives the trigrnphs shown in figure 4-A. 
,%ll of these trigraphs are excellent except the last, and 
that one may be either an abbreviation of a signature, or possibly nulls added to complete the rec- 
tangle. 
If the word JUNCTION is correct then there should be a column with a C in the 5th row;but 
none is found. 
However, column 
9 has a C in the 6th row, and if it happened that the last column 
on the right is So. 3, then column 9 would be the 1st column. 
Thus, as shown in figure 4-B, the 
arrangement of columns becomes 9 . . . . . 7 6 3.

.f. It is believed that the procedure has been set forth with suftlcient detail so as to make 
further demonstration unnecessary. 
The rectangle can be completed very quickly and is found 
to be as shown in figure 5. 
g. It will be interesting to see if a calculation based upon the sum of the logarithms of the 
probabilities 
given in figure 2 would have given the correct combination as the first choice. 
Note the results shown in figure 6. This calculation gives the correct combination as first 
choice, viz, 7-6, with a logarithmically-weighted 
value of 17.35 as against a value of 16.51 for 
combination 7-8, which was the first one tried on the basis of merely the sums of the frequency 
values of the digraphs.

As a matter of interest, it may be observed that the combination i-6 IS 7 times more probable 
than combination 7-8, since the difference between 17.35 and 16.51 is .84, which is the logarithm 
of 7. Likewise, combination 7-6 is roughly 15,000 times more probable than combination 7-9, 
since 17.35-13.17=4.18. 
8. The probable-word 
method of solution.--a. 
The probable-word method of attack is as 
important in the solution of transposition ciphers as it is in the solution of substitution ciphers, 
and if the cryptanalyst 
is able to assume the presence of such probable words as are usually 
encountered in military communications, the solution, as a rule, comes very quickly. 
b. As an illustration, 
looking at the first row of letters in the rectangle shown in figure lj, 
the letters I S T B R T A T F almost at once suggest FIRST BATTALION as the initial words of the 
message. A rearrangement of the columns of the cryptogram to bring the necessary letters 
into juxtaposition 
at once discloses the key. 
Thus: 
915284763 
FIRSTBATT 
ALION 
It will be noted that this assumption requires that there be a column headed by F A, another 
headed by I L, another headed by R I, and so on. 
Had such columns not been found, then the 
word BATTALION would not be possible. 
In that case the word FIRST would still remain as a 
point of departure for further experimentation. 
c. In the foregoing illustration, 
the probable word was assumed to appear in the first line 
of text in the rectangle. 
If the probable word being sought is in the interior of the message, the 
steps must be modified somewhat but the basic principle remains unchanged. 
The modifications 
are of course obvious. 
9. General remarks on. solution .--a. In solving transposition ciphers advantage should be

enemy, because they often afford clues of considerable assistance to the cryptanalyst. 
In all 
languages there arc certain letters, 
usually 
of medium or low 
frequency, which combine with 
other letters to form digraphs of high frequency. 
For instance, in English the letter H is of 
medium frequency, but it combines with T to form the digraph T H, which is of highest frequency 
in literary test; it also combines with C, a letter of medium frequency, to form the fairly frequent 
digraph C H. The letter V is almost in the low-frequency category yet it combines with E to 
form the digrnph V E, which in military text is the 14th in frequency. 
The low-frequency letter 
K often combines with C to form the digrsph C K. Consequently, in working with transposition 
ciphers in English, when there is an H, attempts should be made to combine it first with a T or 
with a C; a V should be combined first with an E; a K should be combined first with a C; and so on. 
b. There is usually in every language at least one letter which can be followed by only a 
certain other letter, forming what may be termed an obligatory sequence, or an invariable 
digraph. 
In all languages having the letter Q, the combination Q U constitutes such an invariable digraph.’ 
In bon&de words of the German language the letter C is never used by itself; when present the 
letter C is invariably followed by an H, except on rare occasions when the digraph C K is employed. 
In English, the letter J can be followed only by a vowel; the letter X can only bc preceded by a 
vowel and, esccpt at the end of a word, can only be succeeded by a vowel, or by one of a limited 
number of consonants (C H P T), and so on. 
Letters which behave in this manner, that is, 
letters which hare what may be called a limited nfinity in combining with other letters t,o form 
digrnphs, constitute good points of departure for solution and arc therefore of sufficient impor- 
tance to warrant their being designated by the more or less descriptive name of pilot letters. 
c. The presence of pilot letters in a transposition cipher often forms the basis for the assump- 
tion of probable words. 
Obviously, a special lookout should be kept for words of rather high 
frequency (in military 
correspondence) which contain letters of low or medium frequency. 
The frequent word CAVALRY, for example, would suggest itself if the cryptogram has the letters 
C, V, L, and Y, which are all of medium frequency. 
The important word ATTACK suggests 
itself if the cryptogram has a K, a letter of low frequency, and a C, one of medium frequency; 
and so on. 
d. The mechanics of simple columnar transposition make possible the production of rather 
long sequences of vowels and long sequences of consonants in the text of the cryptogram. 
h’ote, 
for esample, in the cryptogram on p. 6, the sequence of vowels 0 0 E E E E I 0 E, and the 
sequence of consonants V N L R N R W. If the enciphering or plain-text 
rectangle is con- 
sulted, it will be seen that these two sequences belong together, that is, they are in adjacent 
columns in that rectangle. 
It is a characteristic’of 
plain text that consonant-vowel or vowel- 
consonant digraphs are much more frequent than consonant-consonant or vowel-vowel digraphs,8 
and therefore when long sequences of consonants and of vowels are found in transposition 
ciphers, a good start toward solution may result from assuming that such sequences come from 
adjacent columns. 
e. It should, however, be noted in connection with tell-tale letters such as Q (entering into 
the composition of Q U) and C (entering into the composition of C H), that astute cryptographers 
yho realize the clues which such letters afford often replace invariable digraphs by single char- 
acters, usually those rarely used in the language in question. 
For example, C H in German may 
be replaced by Q, Q U in French, by K, and so on. 
When this is done, solution is made more 
difficult; Lut only in those cases where it is dependent upon finding letters forming obligatory 
sequences in plain text does this sort of subterfuge become a factor of importance. 
7 The letter Q may, of course, be part of an abbreviation, such a.~ SQ for “square,” 
or it may be used as a null, 
ar as a sign of punctuation. However, unless there are good reasons for believing that thie letter is used for such 
purpo~+,~QU may be cpnsidered to be aninvariable 
digraph. 
8 The kV 
and VC digraphs constitute about 62 percent of all digrapha.

f. The presence of many Q’s, or K’s, or X’s in a transposition cipher should not, however, be 
taken as primafucie 
evidence of the type of replacement noted in the preceding subparagraph. 
It is possible that such letters may bc used as sentence separators or other punctuation; possibly 
they may bc nulls, aithough the alert cryptographer would either use nulls not at all or, if he 
had to, ~~~iltl use letters of medium or high frequency for this purpose. 
g. Because it is important that the cryptanalyst take advantage of every peculiarity specifi- 
cally applicable to a cryptogram to be solved, especially as regards the presence of low-frequency 
letters, it is advisable that a uniliteral 
frequency distribution 
be prrparccl, just as though he 
were going to deal with a substitution 
cipher. 
This is probably the quickest way of bringing to 
light the peculiarities which may be helpful in solution. 
10. Reconstruction 
of literal key.--a. 
The reconstruction 
or recovery of the literal key 
from which the numerical transposition key xvas derived is naturally the last step in the solution 
of cryptograms of this type. 
It is often of more than merely academic interest, because if it is 
found that the enemy is employin, v for this purpose some well-known book, or words or phrases 
of a simple nature associated with the locale of operations, this fact may be of highest importance 
in subsequent woi k. 
b. In this process there are only a fer guiding principles to be noted and much must be left 
to the ingenuity and imaginative powers of the cryptanalyst. 
Taking as an esample the numer- 
ical key uncovered in the solution of the cryptogram in paragraph 7, the procedure will be set 
forth below. 
c. The numerical key referred to was found to be 9 1 5 2 8 4 ‘7 6 3. Assuming that this 
sequence was derived in the usual manner, by assigning numbers to the letters of a key word in 
accordance with their relative positions in the normal alphabet, the sequence forms the basis for 
the key-word reconstruction diagram shomn in figure 7-A, in which the individual 
key numbers are 
mitten from left to right on different “levels” so that each level contains only numbers normally 
in succession.

d. It is likely that the digit 1 on the first 1eveI in the key-word reconstruction diagram 
represents a letter at or at least close to the beginning of the alphabet. 
Since the digits 2 and 3 
are on the same level as the digit 1, it is likely (1) that the letter represented by 1 occurs 2 m&e

times in the key word, or (2) that the digit 2 represents another letter, also near the beginning of 
the alphabet, and that this letter is repeated, or (3) that the digits 2 and 3 represent 2 different 
letters both near the beginning of the alphabet, or (4) that all three digits represent different 
letters but all near the beginning of the alphabet. 
The digit 4, on the second level in the recon- 
struction diagram, must represent a letter beyond the letter represented by the digit 3; the digit 
5 must represent one beyond the letter represented by the digit, 4, and the digit 6 may represent 
the same letter as 5, or a letter not much beyond that represented by 5. Assuming that the 
letters composing the key word are fairly well distributed over the entire alphabet, the digit 7 
must represent a letter near or slightly beyond the middle of the alphabet, the digit 8 must repre- 
sent one further toward the end of the alphabet than does the digit 7, and so on. 
Assigning 
several values to the digits, in accordance with the foregoing principle, the results are as shown 
in figure 7-B. 
e. It is perhaps possible that some students may find the process of reconstructing the literal 
key somewhat easier if the variant possible letters are merely listed under the respective key 
numbers as shown in figure 7-C. The candidates for the successive positions in the literal key 
thus appear in a rather condensed space and the eye is able to pick up “good” combinations 
very quickly.

NOW 
comes the trying process of finding a “good” word in this assemblage of lett,ers. The 
beginning and end of the word are the easiest points of attack, and it’is useful to keep in mind the 
relative frequency order of letters as initial and final letters of the language in question. 
For 
English, the datn are as follows: Q 
As initial letters- _____________ 
T S A F C 0 R D N P E M I W B H L U G Y V J Q K Z X 
As final letters _ 
_ ______________ 
E T D S N Y R 0 H L A F G P M X C K W U B I Z Q J V 
Studying the candidate letters at the end of the key, it is seen that E is one of the possibilities. 
If that is correct, then a good ending would be one of the type vowel-consonant-vowel, with E as 
the final letter. 
There is but 1 vowel in the fourth level in the column under the digit 7, the 
letter 0. This gives 0 K E, 0 L E, 0 M E, 0 N E as- possible terminal trigraphs, the best of which 
from a frequency standpoint is ONE. Seeing the letters P and H in columns 8-4, the ending

g. In future studies, cases u-ill be encountered wherein the reconstruction of the numerical 
key is an essential or, at least, a useful element after the solution of one or more cryptograms has 
been achieved by cryptanalysis. 
This is done in order that subsequent cryptograms in the same 
key can be read directly without cryptanalysis. 
The reconstruction 
of the numerical key is, 
however, a different process than the one illustrated in this paragraph, wherein the problem is 
solely one of building up a literal key from its numerical equivalent. 
The purpose in reconstruct- 
ing the literal key is to give clues as to the source from which keys are derived or taken. 
Some- 
times this may lead to ascertaining a book which is used for this purpose and which may be 
available by purchase at, bookshops; or it may be a well-known document, a telephone directory, 
etc. 
Obviously, if the source document or book can be located the solution of future Crypto- 
grams in the same system becomes merely a matter of decipherment and such cryptograms no 
longer form the material for cryptanalytic 
efforts. 
The method of reconstructing 
the literal 
key is, obviously, easier to apply in the case of long numerical keys than in the case of short. ones; 
in general, the longer the numerical key the easier is the recovery of the literal key. 
11. Column and row transposition- 
It, should be obvious that when the rows as well as 
the columns of a completely-filled 
rectangle undergo transposition the increase in security- is 
hardly worth mention, since the underlying procedure in solution aims simply at assembling a 
few columns on the basis of “good” digraphs and trigraphs brought to light by juxtaposing 
columns. 
After three or four columns have been properly juxtaposed, the placement of addi- 
tional columns becomes easier and easier, merely by cont,inuing to build upon the fragments of 
words in the TOWS. Hence, the cryptanalyst is, during a large part of the process, not particularly 
interested in the intelligibility 
of the test he is building up; only at the end of the process does 
this become a factor. 
When all of the columns have been assembled in proper order, then the 
text will read continuously in the normal manner (left to right, top to bottom). 
If it does not, 
then it is usually a very simple matter to rearrange the rows of the rectangle to bring this about, 
since t,he letters at the ends and beginnings of the rows give the necessary clues for continuity.

12. General principles underlying 
solution. --a. In the system designated keyed columnnr 
transposition the feature which differentiates an incompletely-filled 
rectangle from one that is 
completely filled is a very simple one from the cryptographic point of view: The bottom row of 
the rectangle in the former case merely lacks one or more letters, a feature which only very 
slightly complicates the system in practical operation. 
But the consequences of this simple 
difference between the two types are, from the cryptanalytic 
point of view, quite profound, and 
the cryptanalytic 
effect of this small change in cryptographic procedure is seemingly all out of 
proportion with the simplicity of the difference. 
b. Cryptograms involving completely-filled rectangles are rather easy to solve because of two 
circumstances. 
In the first place, since the rect-angle is completely filled, the various possible 
dimensions of the rectangle can be ascertained by noting the factors of the total number of letters. 
Usually only a few possibilities are indicated and therefore this materially reduces the amount of 
experimentation that would be required in the absence of this situation, since it is obvious that 
when working with incompletely-filled 
rectangles a good many rectangles of various dimensions 
become possibilit,ies for trial. 
In the second place, the columns in a completely-filled rectangle 
all contain the same number of letters, and therefore the anagramming process (matching and 
assembling of columns) can be performed without any mental reservations such as must’ be made 
in working with incompletely-filled 
rectangles because of uncertainty 
as to whether the letters 
which are juxtaposed to form digraphs and trigraphs really come from the same row in the plain- 
text rectangle. 
The latter statement calls for a bit more explanation. 
c. The columns of an incompletely-filled 
rectangle arc of two sorts which may conveniently 
be designated as long and short. 
The long columns are at the left of the rectangle and each one 
contains just one more letter than the short columns, which are at the right. 
This follows, of 
course, from the fact that it is only the last row in such a rectangle which lacks one or more letters 
to complete the rectangle. 
The term width, as applied to a transposition rect.angle, will be con- 
venient to designate the number of columns, which is, of course, determined by the length of the 
numerical key or the number of letters in the literal key. 
Given the width of the rectangle and 
the total number of letters in the cryptogram, the length and number of t’he long and the short 
columns may be found by a simple calculation: Multiply 
the width of the rectangle by the 
smallest number which will yield a product greater than the total number of letters in the 
cryptogram. 
The multiplier gives the length of the long columns; this multiplier minus 1 gives 
the length of the short columns; the excess over the total number of letters gives the number of 
short columns; 
the latter deducted from the width gives the number of long colum.ns. Thus, 
with a cryptogram 
of 287 letters and a rectangle 15 columns in width: [(15X20)-113=287] 
the 
(18)

Prev. Book

19 
long columns n-ill have 20 Iet’ters, the short ones, 19 letters; there will be 13 short columns and 2 
long ones. 
d. Sow if the cryptanalyst 
were able to cut up the test of a cryptogram produced 
from an 
incompletely-filled 
rectangle into sections corresponding in length with the actual long and short 
columns, he could handle these columns in exactly the same manner that he hnntllcs the equal- 
length columns in the solution of a cryptogram produced from a complctcly-filled 
rcctsngle. 
In 
fact, the solution would bc easier because he kno1v-s that all the short columns fall at the right, 
all the long columns at the left of the transposition rectangle, and therefore the amount 
of esperi- 
mentation he must undertake in his attempts to justapose columns in the anagramming process is 
considerably reduced. 
But, unfortunately, 
there is usually no way in wluch, at the initial stage 
of solution, the cryptanalyst can find out, from a single cryptogram, which arc the long columns 
and rvhich the short, 
This is obviously a matter directly connected with the specific trunsposi- 
t.ion key, and the latter is the sole unknown factor in the whole problem. 
e. If it were practicable to transcribe a cryptogram of this type according to all the possible 
transposition keys for a given width of rectangle, solution would obviously merely consist in 
scanning the various rectangles to find the one which is correct- for there will be only Oht? such 
rectangle. 
A rectangle 15 columns in width may have been enciphered by any one of factorial 
15 transposition keys.’ 
TF?tile it is conceivable that machinery might be devised for this purpose, 
so that the production of the millions of possible rectangles could be effected in a rclatirely 
short 
time, in the present st,ate of the art no such machinery has yet been devisctl. 
Furthermore, it is 
problematical whether a solut.ion by such means could bc achieved in a reasonable length of time 
even if the machinery were available, because of the immensity of the task it would have to 
perform.* 
f. However, this question may be asked: Given a cryptogram of t letters and a rectangle of 
n columns in width, is it possible to transcribe the test within a single rectangle so that’ the latter 
will show what letters will constitute the respective columns for all possible transposition keys of 
7t elements? If so, then such a rectangle would be useful in t,rying to solve the cryptogram, 
because the rectangle would then limit t,he amount of experimentation 
that would have to be 
performed by the anagramming process, since it would show whether or not two letters which 
are brought together in t,hat process to form a digraph could possibly have been in the same row 
in the plain-test rectangle. 
If not, then of course there would be no use in forming such digraphs, 
and thus the number of trials becomes much reduced. 
Another way of indicating what is meant 
is to say that such a rectangle would show the maximum amount that one column may be shifted 
up or down in trying to match it with another column in the anagramming process. This will be 
made clearer in a subsequent paragraph. 
At this point it will merely be stated that it is easy to 
prepare a rectangle of the nature indicated 
above for any keyed, columnar-transposition 
cryptogram. 
* Factorial 
15, or 15X14X13X. 
. .X 1, equals 1,369,944,576,000 different transposition 
keys. 
1 It is nevertheless pertinent 
to indicate that machinery 
for facilitating 
the “matching” 
or snagramming 
of 
columns has bean devised and found to be quite prac;tical in the solution of problems involving 
columnar trans- 
position.

c. The rectangle shown in figure 8 is the same as though it had been assumed that the key 
numbers 9: 10, 11, and 12 happened to fall at the extreme right in the numerical transposition 
key, Columns 1 to 8, inclusive, would then be long columns, and columns 9, 10, 11, and 12 would 
be short columns. But suppose that the key numbers on the extreme right happened to be 1, 2, 
3, and 4, instead of 9, 10, 11, and 12. 
5 to 12 the long ones. 
Then columns 1, 2, 3. and 4 would be the short columns, 
In this case, making reference to figure 8, the final letter of column 1 
would pass to the top of column 2; the final 2 letters of column 2 would pass to the top of column 
3; the f?nal 3 letters of column 3 would pass to the top of column 4; the final 4 letters of columns 
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 would pass to the top of columns 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; the final 3 letters of column 
9 would pass to the top of column 10; the final 2 letters of column 10 would pass to the top of 
column 11; and the final letter of column 11 would pass to the top of column 12. The results of 
the foregoing reasoning are embodied in the matrix or diagram shown in figure 9.

d. Now the capital letters in this matrix or diagram, which is often called a crown or hat 
diagram,3 figure 9, represent the latters which are in the columns in case tbe fir& hypothesis 
(key numbers 9, 10, 11, 12 at the extreme right) is true. 
The capital letters above the heavy 
blclck line together with t.he lower-case letters at the top of the diagrn.m represent the letters 
which are in the columns in case the second hypothesis (key numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 at tho extreme 
right) is true. 
Therefore, since the hat diagram covers the two possible extremes with reference 
to the positions occupied by the short columns and embraces all possible intermediate conditions 
by showing what letters may be in the respective columns under any possible arrangement of long

and short 
columns, 
the hat diagram is a,ppEicable to any possible numerical 
keyjor 
the cryptogram 
in quc.stion. and “for the asslcmcd width qf rectangle. 
Therefore, in the anagrammkg process the 
hat diagram shows the maximum possible amount that any column may be shifted up or down 
in juxtaposing two columns to form digrnphs of letters assumed to come from the same ro\r 
in the plain-text 
recta&. 
This is because all the letters of the first row of the actual enci- 
phering rectangle will be found in rows 1 to 5, inclusive, of figure 9; all the letters of the second 
ro\\- of the rectangle will be found in IOWS 2 to G, inclusive, and so on, as indicated by the braces 
at the right in figure 9. 
e. Thus there arises the following important 
principle: Designating the number of short 
columns in a specific diagram by n, only such letters as fall within (n+l) 
consecutive rows, will 
be letters that may hate appeared in the same row in the actual transposition rectangle. 
Or, 
another way of stating the principle is this: Both members of any pair of letters actually in the 
same row in the transposition rectangle will be found only among the letters appearing in (n+l) 
consecutive rows in the correct hat diagram. 
In the case under discussion, if the first letter 
of such a pair is located in row 8, for example, the other letter cannot be in rows 1, 2: 3, or 13 to 
23 of figure 9. 
j. The usefulness of this principle in connection with the construction and employment of 
the hat diagram will soon become apparent. 
For example, again referring to figure 9, take the 
let.ter Q in row 19, column 7; it must be followed by a U in t,he plain text. 
There are 4 U’s in the 
message; they are in row 13 column 11, row 14 column 3, row li 
column 1, and row 20 column 6. 
Sow the question is, can nny of these 4 U’s follow the U, or may one or more of them be eliminated 
from consideration at’ once’? Since the U’s in rows 13 and 14 fall outside the 4 consecutive rows 
above that in which the U is located, it follows that neither one of these U’s can be the one that 
succeeds the U. Thus two candidates are automatically .eliminated from consideration. 
The U 
in row 17 and the U in row 20 are both possible candidates. 
14. Solution of example.-a. 
With the foregoing preliminaries out of the way, the solution 
of the cryptogram can now be carried forward with rapid progress. It has been indicated that 
the Q in row 19, column 7 (fig. 9), may be combined with either the U in row 17 column 1: or the 
U in row 20 column 6. Suppose the columns of figure 9 are now cut apart for ease in anagramming. 
Juxtaposing the indicated columns yields u-hat is shown in figure 10. Since the combination 
shown at a in figure 10 involves column 1, it obviously begins with the letter 0 and ends with the 
letter A or L; no ot’her letters can be added to this column. 
Since column 7 is already the maxi- 
mum length this column can be under any circumstances, no letters can be added to it at the 
bottom. 
Therefore, all the digraphs -possible to form by juxtaposing these two columns are 
indicated in figure lOa. 
There are only 17 digraphs in all, whereas there should be at least 18.

Hence, combination 7-l is impossible, and combination 7-6 is the only one that needs to be 
considered furt’her. 
There are many excellent digraphs in it, and only one which admittedly 
looks rather bad, the H X. Seeing the digraphs K B and K S in these columns, a good assumption 
to make is that the K’s are preceded by the letter C. Is there a column with 2 C’s in approximately 
the correct region ? Column 4 meets this requirement. 
Note the excellenttrigraphs 
it yields, 
as shown in figure 10~. It now becomes fairly easy to add columns to this nucleus. 
For instance, 
the trigraph R Y B suggests a word ending in R Y, such as INFANTRY, ARTILLERY, CAVALRY: 
the trigraph M 0 V suggest MOVING; the trigraph C K B suggests the word ATTACK; followed by 
a word beginning with B, and so on. 
Trial of only a few columns soon yields what is shown in 
figure lOd, from which it soon becomes probable that the long colunms end with column 12, since 
the letters after L Y yield an impossible sequence (E E E Y). 
Since it was originally assumed 
that there are only 4 short columns in the transposition rectangle, and since 4 columns have 
already been placed at the right (4-7-6-lo), 
the rectangle, with the columns thus far placed, 
must be as shown in figure 10e. This, then, at once tells what the limits of columns 2,3, 5,8,9, 
and 11 must be, nnd the rectangle can now be fl.lled in without further delay. 
The completed 
rectangle is shown in figure 11.

The word PENETRATIONS will fit and it is taken to be presumabIy correct. 
There is no absolute 
certainty about the matter, for it is conceivable and possible that there are other words which 
can be made to fit the sequence of key numbers given. 
15. Alternative method of solution.-u. 
The foregoing solution will no doubt appeal to the 
student as being straightforward 
and simple-+ 
the original 
assumption 
as to the width of the 
ti-ansposition 
rectangle is correct. 
But, unfortunately, 
there is no way of knowing whether such 
an original asstiption 
is cbrrect until &lution 
is well’tider 
way. 
In practice, of course, what

26 
might be done within a well-organized cryptanalytic 
unit would be to divide up the work among 
the individuals constituting 
the.unit, each being assigned one or more specific hypotheses to try 
out with respect to width of rectangle. 
Then one of these individuals 
n-ould find the correct 
rridth and he would be joined by the others as soon as an entering wedge had been found in this 
Kay. 
Of, if the cryptanalyst 
is working alone, he must try out successive hypotheses as to 
Kiclth of rectangle until he hits upon the correct one. 
In making these hypotheses he must be 
guided by previous experience with enemy correspondence, which may all’ord clues as to minimum 
and maximum widths of rectangles. 
b. However, there is another method of attack which does not necessitate making any 
definite initial assumptions with respect to the width of the transposition rectangle. 
This method 
is a modification of the method set forth in the preceding paragraph. 
The text of the crypto- 
gram is written out columnwise on cross-section paper, every fifth letter being numbered for pur- 
poses of reference. 
Plenty of space is left between the columns, and about 10 or 15 letters at the 
bottom of each column are repeated at. the top of the next column so that at any point in the 
transcription there will be in a single unbroken string at least. one complete column of letters from 
the transposition rectangle. 
Then a section of consecutive letters of text is written on a separate 
strip of cross-section paper, columnwise of course, and by juxtaposing this strip against. the n-hole 
text, sliding it to various points of coincidence against the text, an attempt is made to find that 
position in which the best digraphs are formed of the letters on the movable strip and the fixed 
sequence. Of course, if there is a Q in the cryptogram, the sliding-strip section is made to contain 
this letter, and the strip is then placed against the text where a U is found, so as to form the digraph 
QU. The digraphs formed above and below the QU are then studied; possibly a written record is 
made of the digraphs found. 
Then the same thing is done with the Q and all other U’s in the 
text, to insure that a correct start is made. 
It’ is this initial step which is likely to give the most 
difficulty 
(if there is anything difficult, at all in the procedure) and it is important that it be cor- 
rect. 
If this first step is easy, then solution follows quite rapidly; if the cryptanalyst 
is unlucky 
and makes several false starts, the process is likely to be a slow one. 
In choosing from among 
several possible juxtapositions 
it may be advisable to calculate the probability 
value of each 
possibility by adding the logarithms of the -frequenci vaiues of the digraphs, as explained in 
paragraph 7g. In the absence of any Q’s in the text, recourse must be had to the formation of 
other probable digraphs, based upon the presence of certain other telltale low-frequency letters, 
such as C, H, J, K, V, and X. The cryptanalyst is fortunate if there are two or three of these low- 
frequency letters close to one another in a series of letters, for in this ca.se he can search for a 
place where there are high-frequency letters (in a corresponding sequence) that might be com- 
bined with them. 
For example, suppose that a text shows a sequence . . . V E H H K . . . . 
Asequencesuchas. 
.-.ART-CC. 
. . would be excellent to try, for it will yield the digrahhs 
AV, RE, TH, CH, CK. Or if there is a long sequence of consonants, the cryptanalyst 
should 
look for a correspondingly long sequence of vowels, since these make the best combinations and 
are therefore most probable. 
For these reasons it pays to study the text quite carefully before 
choosing a starting point, to find all such peculiar sequences as might be useful in affording a 
good point of departure. 
It should also be noted that there are at least two correct positions at 
which,.he sliding strip can be juxtaposed against the text, since in the enciphering rectangle the 
letters in one column form digraphs with the letters in the column not only on the right but also 
on the left. 
In the absence of any Q’s, or other low-frequency letters suitable for a point of depar- 
ture, the very &st 20 or 25 letters of the cryptogram may be used as the starting point, since 
these letters come from column 1 of the transposition rectangle and therefore there is no uncer- 
tainty at least as to the letter which is at the top of that column; or, the last 20 or 25 letters of 
the cryptogram may be used as the starting point, since these letters come from the last-num-

bered column of the rectangle and therefore there is no uncertainty at least as to the letter which 
is at the bottom of that column. 
c. Suppose that n good initial justnposition 
hns been found for the portion of the test that 
has been written on the sliding strip, nnd that a series of excellent digrnphs has been brought to 
light. 
The nest step is, of course, to ndtl to these digraplrs on eithir 
side by finding sections of test, that kll 
yield “good” 
trigraphs and 
tetragrnphs. 
For example, suppose that the initial juxtaposition 
has 
yielded what is shown in figure 14. The rligrnph P R suggests thnt it 
must be followcd by a ro\vel: preferably E, A, or 0; the digr:iph A V 
might be port of the kvord CAVALRY, in lvhich case it will be followed 
by A; the digrnph C R su . 
ggcsts that it might, bc followed by the vowel 
A or E. A place is therefore sought, in the rest of the text, n-hrrc 
there is a sequence of the letters here desired, and, qf court<e, a2 the

Suppose such n scqucnce is found and yields n-hat is 
shown in figure 15. The skeletons of words are now beginning to 
sppear. 
Assuming that A V A is indeed part of the word CAVALRY, 
there should be an L to follow it; the trigrnph T I N suggests the ttr- 
minntion G; the tiigraph Z E R suggests the word ZERO. A section of 
text is therefore sought, which will have the letters L, G, and 0 in the

order L . . . . . G . . 0. Enough has been shown to demonstrate 
the procedure. 
In the course of the work it soon becomes cvidcnt 
where the ends of columns are, bccnuse the digmphs above and below 
the nuclear or “good” portion become “bad” 
quite suddenly, just as 
soon as letters belonging to nonadjacent columns in the original rec-

tangle are brought together. 
For example, in figure 15 it is observed t.hst the trigraph at the 
top, R R S, is highly improbable, as is likewise the trigraph at the bottom, E-A 0. This suggests 
that these letters have been brought together erroneously, that is, that they do not belong in 
adjacent columns in the enciphering rectangle. 
If this is true then the “good” portion is com- 
posed of the 13 letters between these two extremities and therefore the columns are about 13 
letters long. 
Additional work will soon show exactly how long each column really is, and when 
this has been ascertained the problem has been practically completed, since at the same time 
that this becomes evident the sequence of columns has also become evident. 
d. An example of solution by this alternative method may be helpful. 
Using the crypto- 
gram of paragraph 13 as an example, figure 16 shows how the text might be transcribed on a sheet 
of cross-section paper. 
Noting that the message contains a Q as the 129th letter, a section of 
text to include the Q is transcribed on a strip of cross-sect,ion paper and this strip is then juxta- 
posed against the remaining text to bring the Q in front of a U. How many letters should be 
included in this strip? 
The message contains 224 letters; if a width of say 10 to 20 columns is 
assumed, the columns of the rectangle will be about 12 to 22 letters in length. 
It will be safer to 
assume o, convenient length closer to the maximum than to the minimum; consequently a length 
of 20 letters will be tentatively assumed. Now the Q may be at, the top of a column, at the middle,

or at the bottom-there 
is no way of telling at this point. 
Hence, to make sure that nothing 
is overlooked, suppose a section of 41 letters is taken, with the Q at the center. 
There are 4 U’s 
in the message, and 4 trials are to be made. The results are as indicated in figure 17-A. Examin-

bad. 
In fact,-noi one of those above the Q U is impossible and the same 
is true of those below the Q U until the digraph V N is reached. 
Hence, 
combination 1 is possible. 
As for combination 2, this at once appears 
to br bad. 
Digraphs such as I I, and I H nrc highly improl)ablr, aud 
this combination 
may be discarded with safety. 
Combination 
3 is 
possible from the top digraph, 0 F, to the 12th digraph below the Q U, 
alt,hough the digraph H X looks very bad. 
However, the X might be a 
sentence separator, so that this combination 
cannot, be discarded. 
Combination 4 looks very improbable, with the digrnph H N occurring 
twice, and other equally bad digraphs showing. 
Of the four possibil- 
ities then, combinations 2 and 4 are discarded, leaving 1 and 3 for 
further study. 
It is very difficult to choose between these two possi- 
bilities. 
All the digraphs in combination 1 down to digraph V N are 
possible; many of them are excellent. 
As for combination 3, all the 
digraphs doun to V D are also possible and many of them are excellrut. 
There does not seem to be much use to add the frequency values of the 
digraphs (or logarithms thereof) in each combination because it is hard 
to know with what digraphs to begin or end, although as a last resort 
this could of course be done. 
Howetqer, perhaps it is not essential that 
a choice be made at once; possibly further 
work along #he lines 
now to 
be demonstrated will 
show which combination 
is correct. 
Pu’oting the 2 K’s (in the digraphs K B and K S) among 
the combinations before the Q, assume that t.hese K’s are 
parts of the digraph C K. Is there a sequence C . C in 
the text? 
There is but one such place, at the 63d letter. 
Suppose the corresponding section is placed in front of 
the combinations 1 and 3 of figure 17, as shown in figure 
17-B. 
It immediately becomes evident that combina- 
tion 3 is the correct one, for note the excellent tri- 
graphs it gives, as compared with those in combination 
1. Also note that the second trigraph below the E Q U 
in combination 3 consists of 3 E’s, indicating that the 
end of the columns has been reached just before this 
trigraph. 
As for the top trigraphs of figure 17-B they 
are good all the way up.

words are beginning to appear. 
The T H R immediately above the E Q U sug- 
gests either THREE or THROUGH; the F R 0 above the T H R suggests FROM or 
FRONT. Suppose the word REQUEST is assumed for the E Q U, and the word 
THREE is assumed for the T H R above it. 
This requires a section with 2 E’s in 
succession. 
e. There are several such places in the text, and further limitation is advisable. 
The 8th trigraph from the top is certainly suggestive of the word MOVING, which 
requires an I to follow the V. Is there a place in the text where an I occurs 12 
letters before a succession of two E’s? There is one such place, and the corres- 
ponding section is juxtaposed at the proper place, yielding what is shown in

figure 17-C. 
The upper and lower limits of the columns are now fairly definite and are 
marked by the horizontal 
bars; tet,ragraphs E E E Y at the bottom and A M I E at the top 
are very improbable. 
The ftetragraph C E E S below the top bar is possible, because it may 
represent the end of a word like FORCE followed by the beginning of the word ESTIMATED; the 
tetmgraph above the bottom bar suggests a word ending in E followed by the word IMMEDIATE. 
It, seems hardly necessary to continue with the demonstration; in a few moments the entire 
diagram is reconstructed and yields the solution. 
During this process, as soon as a section of 
text in figure 16 has been used it is crossed off, so as to prevent its letters from being considered 
as further possibilities for addition t.o the reconstruction diagram. 
Thus, as the work progresses 
the number of available sections becomes progressively less, and the choice for successive sections 
for addition to the diagram becomes a quite easy matter. 
j. When two or three operators are assigned to work upon a cryptogram by this method, 
solution can be reached in a very short space of time, especially if each one of the operators takes a 
different point of attack. 
After a few minutes the fragments of texts obtained may be assim- 
ilated into one message which is then completed very speedily. 
g. This and t,he next four subparagraphs will be devoted to some remarks of a general nature 
concerning columnar transposition of the foregoing type. 
The degree of cryptographic security 
afforded by simple columnar transposition 
methods, especially when incompletely-filled 
ma- 
trices are employed, is considerably increased if some of the cells of the matrix are occupied by 
nulls instead of significant letters. 
If nulls are employed judiciously 
their presence serves to 
confuse the cryptanalyst 
by introducing 
unusual digraphs, trigraphs, and polygraphs which 
may lead him to discard correct combinations of columns in the anagramming process and thus 
retard solut’ion. 
Obviously, the use of low-frequency letters such as J, Q, X, or Z as nulls does 
not commend itself for this purpose, as such letters would not only distort the normal frequency 
distribution 
and thus give clues to the presence of nulls, but also they would be quickly 
“spotted” 
in the anagramming process. 
h. Another subterfuge, and a good one, to put stumbling blocks in the way of a quick 
solution is to leave “blanks” 
within the transposition matrix, that is, certain cells are left un- 
occupied by letters of the text. 
If only a few cells distributed 
irregularly 
within the columns 
of the transposition matrix are designated as blanks, the disturbing effect upon the anagram- 
ming process is quite marked. 
This more or less effectively hinders the cryptanalyst’ in his 
attempts to ascertain the lengths of the columns and considerably increases the difficulty 
of 
the anagramming process. 
i. In order to fix definitely the positions of the nulls or of the blanks in the transposition 
matrix, definite prearrangements between correspondents are necessary. These may be in the 
nature of “forms” outlining the matrix, showing the number of columns and the positions of the 
cells to be occupied by nulls, or of the cells to be left vacant in the inscription process; or the 
positions of these cells may be derived from the elements of the transposition key itself. 
If 
“forms” are employed, they may be used with varying transposition keys, so that even thougb 
there may be only relatively few different forms, the use of varying transposition keys serves to 
increase cryptographic security to a rather marked degree. 
j. If nulls, or blanks, or both, are distributed irregularly 
but symmetrically 
throughout the 
transposit,ion matrix (as, for example, blanks are distributed 
in cross-word puzzles) solution 
of single messages produced by simple keyed-columnar 
transposition 
from such a matrix 
becomes an extremely difficult if not impossible problem. 
Naturally, 
if nulls and blanks are 
distributed 
irregularly 
and assymmetrically 
the matter becomes hopeless, as far as a single 
message is concerned. 
k. Of course, if several messages of identical length and in the same key are available for 
superimposition, 
the presence of the nulls or blanks then makes little difference, because the

gen.eral snlutinn to be explained in a subsequent paragraph (par. 26) can be applied. 
Or if mes- 
sages with similar beginnings or similar endings are available, solution is facilitated here as in the 
simpler case where nulls or blanks are not employed, as will be explained in subsequent para- 
graphs (pars. 23-24). 
Considerations of space prevent going into detail in the solution of an 
example, and the student should undertake a study of these cases for himself. 
16. The C-+P and the P-+C sequences-a. 
Two numerical sequences which constitute the 
bases for several very important 
cryptanalytic 
operations and procedures in the solution of 
transposition ciphers map be derived from, and are applicable to, most ciphers of this class. They 
are as follows: 
(1) A sequence the successive terms of which indicate the position numbers that the 
successive letters of the plain text occupy in the cipher text. 
This sequence will hereinafter be 
designated the plain-cipher 
sequence, or P-C 
sequence. 
(2) A sequence the successive terms of which indicate the position numbers that the 
successive letters of the cipher text occupy in the plain test. 
This sequence will hereinafter be 
designat,ed the cipherjplain 
sequence, or C-P 
sequence. 
b. These two sequences are obviously related, one being the imerse or indexed version of the 
other. 
Given one of the sequences, the other can be derived from it by the simple operation of 
indexing, in a normal sequence, the positions occupied by the numbers constituting the sequence 
on hand. 
An example will be given presently.

matrix, in normal order of writing,

The student may easily verify that. the P+C sequence is what it purports to be by noting that, 
according to it, the 1st letter of the plain text of the illustrative 
message, T,, becomes the 31st 
letter of the cipher text (since the number 01 occupies position 31 in the P-& 
sequence shown 
above), and that in the cryptogram the 31st letter is T, ; the 2d letter of the plain text, H,, becomes 
the 22d letter of the cipher text and that in the cryptogram the 22d letter is H,; and so on. 
In 
connection with the P-+C sequence, it is to be noted that successive terms in the sequence,

in the case of single transposition, show a constant difference except when passing from a greater 
to a smaller number, which happens every time a transition is made from a term applying to 
the bottom element of one column to a term applying to the top element of the next column. 
For example, in the case of the 1st three terms in the sequence: 16-03= 
13; 29-16=13. 
However, in the case of the 3d term of the sequence (29) and the 4th (09) the passage is from 
a greater to a smaller number and the constant difference, 13, no longer is evident. 
The cause of 
the constant difference is, of course, obvious and follows directly from the mechanics of the trans- 
position system itself. 
The point to be specially noted is that the existence of such a constant 
difference (with the exceptions noted above) may be taken as one of the identifying characteristics 
of single columnar t,ransposition; double columnar transposition or other types of complex trans- 
position will show no such constant difference throughout, the P+C sequence. 
d. Given the P+C sequence in subparagraph c, its inverse, the C-P sequence is established 
merely by preparing an indexed version of the former.

e. The C!+P sequence can also be produced in a.nother way. 
Suppose that numbers are 
inscribed in the cells of the transposition matrix, 
not in the normal manner of writing from left to 
right and form the top downward, but according to the route followed in transcribing 
the numbers 
to form the “cipher text,” that is, in key-number order in the columns of the mat,rix. 
Thus: 
12 9 
1 4 10 8 6 11 2 13 3 7 5 
31 22 01 09 25 19 14 28 04 34 07 17 12

F~owr 16-C. 
If these numbers are now transcribed according to the normal manner of writing (from left to 
right and from the top downward), the sequence produced is 31 22 01 09 25 . . ., which coin- 
cides with the C+P sequence shown in subparagraph d above, which in turn was derived from the 
P-AZ sequence.

f. The C-+P sequence may also be called the artugrunz seqmnce because it can be established 
as a result of a solution accomplished by anagramming superimposed messages of identical length. 
It is clear that what is accomplished in such a solution is to rearrange the letters of the cipher 
text to bring them back into their original order in the cipher text, that is, the solution involves a 
C+P conversion. 
g. The P+C sequence is called by a recent French author the KP sequence (from the Greek 
word kryptos) because it gives the order of the plain-text letters as they occur in the cryptogram. 
The P+C sequence is also termed the encipher sequence by another writer, and still another has 
called it the transposition 
sequence. 
The present author believes that the terminology adopted 
herein, viz, P+C sequence and C-P 
sequence, is less confusing and serves more accurately to 
identify or characterize these sequences than the other designations herein indicated.

h. The term number is useful merely to facilitate finding and referring to specific terms or 
numbers in a sequence, whether the latter be a C+P or a P-+C sequence. The number simply 
indicates the locus or position a t’erm occupies in the sequence. In connection with a plain- 
text message the consecutive term numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . may be used as loci for the successive 
letters of the message; in connection with a cryptogram the c,onsecutive term numbers 1, 2, 3, 
. . . may be used as loci for the successive letters of the cipher text. 
i. In single, keyed-columnar transposit’ion an interesting relationship exists between sections 
of the C+P sequence. Consider the C-+P sequence given in subparagraph (I above, and note 
that by adding the integer 1 to the successive numbers thereof, sections of the original sequence 
show certain identities with sections in CdP sequence + 1. Thus:

In fact, if the successive numbers of the C-P

Rawr 18-D. 
Reference to figure 18-C will show the identity 
of this diagram with that figure. 
Such an 
arrangement of course indicates at once the number of columns in the transposition rectangle, 
from which it follows that if the C+P sequence is available it is an easy matter to establish the 
outlines of the transposition matrix. 
The phenomena dealt with in this subparagraph are but 
a reflection of those discussed in subparagraph c above. 
j. The phenomena just indicated may, however, be employed to advantage in another 
manner in the solution of an unknown example. 
Referring to the illustrative 
cryptogram in 
subparagraph c above, suppose that the cryptanalyst 
has reason to suspect the presence of the 
probable word QUICK. The letters necessary to produce this word (and their term numbers in 
the crypt,ogram) are as follows: 
2s 
iiv”;‘:K” 
The sequence 9-i:- 
19-14-28 now constitutes a portion of the C+P sequence. Adding the 
integer 1 successively to those C+P numbers, let the corresponding letters be set down along- 
side the numbers. 
Thus:

Here it will be seen that portions of “good” plain text become manifest, viz, JUMPS and AZYDO. 
The 3d derivative no longer is “good” because the rectangle has but 3 rows and consequently 
only the 1st and 2d derivatives from the “base” are valid. 
It is obvious that the foregoing 
method of deriving plain-text’ sections from a correct probable word offers considerable possi- 
bilities as a cryptanalytic 
tool, especially in the case of matrices with more than 2 or 3 rows. 
If 
sections of text can be reconstructed in this manner and then combined ir proper seqllence the 
reconstructicn of the complete matrix and the transposition key is a relatively simplta mtltter. 
The application of the foregoing principle t,o t,he solution of unknown esamplcs is, of course, 
obvious. 
k. There is also an interesting relationship betw-een the sections of t,he P+C sequence for a 
cryptogram, though it is somewhat different from that discussed is iubparagraphs i and j in t,he 
case of the C+P sequence. Consider the P-+C sequence set forth in subparagraph d above end 
note how, by adding the integer 1 to the successive numbers, sections of the P+C sequence become 
identical with sections of the P+C+l 
sequence. Thus:

The equivalencies between identities, as indicated above, indicate not only that the enciphering 
matri.. has 13 columns, but also they may be used to establish the actual transposition key or 
at least a cyclic permutation of the key, by constructing a chain of equivalents. 
Thus: 
1=4, 4=10, 10=8, 8=6, 6=11, 11=2, 2=13, 13=3, 3=7, 7=5, 5=12, 12=9, 9=1 
This yields, by eliminating 
the term common to successive equivalents, the following chain or 
transposition key: 
1 4 
10 8 6 
11 2 13 3 7 5 12 9 
Reference to figure 18-A will show that the foregoing key is a cyclic permutation of the actual key. 
1. There remain only some minor remarks which, being of a general nature arising from the 
mechanics of simple keyed-columnar transposition, are worth noting. 
They are.discussed in the 
subsequent two subparagraphs. 
m. An appreciation of the difEculties introduced by employing only incompletely-filled 
rectangles indicates that it would be very useful if there were some method whereby in the initial 
stages of solution the cipher text could be divided up correctly into its component long and short 
columns, for the subsequent steps of rearranging the colunins by the anagramming principle are 
quite simple. 
If, for example, there were some feature which provided a means of ascertaining 
when in encipherment a transit was made from the bottom of one column to the top of the next 
column, then the location of these transition points or “breaks” would obviously permit of break- 
ing up the cipher text into its correct long and short columns. 
In later studies cases of this kind 
will be encountered. 
n. It is useful sometimes to be able to ascertain just where breaks cannot occur, that is, 
where a passage from the bottom of one column to the top of the next one cannot occur in the 
cipher text, for this will limit the field for experiment. 
A consideration of the mechanics of the 
system will afford an excellent clue to the fact that this determination is easy to make. 
In any 
transposition rectangle involving simple keyed-columnar transposition the interval, in the cipher 
text, between two consecutive letters which are in the same row in the matrix is the sum of a

multiple of the length of the short columns 
and a multiple of the length of the long columns. 
FOI 
example, consider the adjacent letters C K in t,he plain-text rectangle in figure 18-A. 
In the cipher, 
C, is the 14th lett,er, K, is the 28th and the interva.1 is 28-14=14. 
The message has a total of 
35 letters and the matrix has 13 columns, 9 long ones of 3 letters and 4 short ones of 2 letters. 
An interval of 14 can therefore be brought about in only one way: (4X3)+(1X2)=14, 
which 
means that 4 long columns and 1 short one intervene between the C and the K in the plain text, 
and that the key numbers applicable to the two columns are 5 apart in sequence, that is, if the 
column in which C is located has key number 1, the column next to it on the right is 6, or if the 
former is 2 the latter is 7, and so on. 
Reference to figure 18-A will show that these deductions 
are correct and that, the key numbers involved are 6-l 1. However, a more general treatment is 
possible. 
Given a cryptogram of 26 letters and an assumed

All the possible positions of breaks in the cipher t.ext, that is, transits from the bottom of one 
column to the top of the next column, may now readily be ascertained by finding the totals result- 
ing from making all the possible combinations of the indicated multiples taken in pairs. 
It is 
convenient’ to draw up a table to show directly the sums of the combinations.

If, now, diagonal lines are drawn from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner 
of the diagram, the locations of all possible breaks are given. 
Thus, there can be a ‘break be- 
tween the 4th and 5th letters (passing from a short column to the next column, which may be 
long or short, of course); there cannot be a break between the 5th and 6th letters, nor between 
the 6th and i’th, nor between the 7th and 8th; there can be a break bet,ween the 8th and gth, as 
well as between the 9th and lOth, but not between the 10th and llth, 
and so on. 
Suppose that 
for one reason or another the cryptanalyst has good reason to suspect that a break occurs imme- 
diately after the 13th letter. 
This means that there are 2 short columns (of 4 letters) and 1 long 
column (of 5 letters) up to that break. 
The diagram shows that there remain only 2 short 
columns 
and 1 long one, a.nd the only breaks that are possible beyond the one at the 13th letter 
are: Between the 17th and 18th, or between the 21st and 22d letters. 
O. The importance of the various principles set forth in this paragraph will become evident as 
the student progresses in his studies of transposition ciphers.

17. Importance 
of the study of errors and blunders in early work upon an unknown 
system.-a. 
Blunders and mistakes made by cryptographic 
clerks in the esecution of cryp- 
tographic clerks in the execution of cryptographic instructions should be rare in a well-trained and 
well-disciplined 
cryptographic 
service. 
Nevertheless, blunders and mistakes are committed 
despite all that can be done to prevent their occurrence. 
Especially in the excitement prior to 
or during an important action or movement do such instances take place and these afford golden 
opportunities for the enemy cryptanalytic 
service. 
This situation exists in respect to all types of 
cryptographic systems and no cryptanalytic 
instruction would be complete if cognizance were not 
taken of the advantages which may be reaped from the blunders, the mistakes, and, occasionally, 
the downright ineptitude of the adversary’s cryptographers. 
6. Practically every cryptographic system affords opportunities for the commission of errors 
in its application, and each system more or less presents a separate case. That is, the errors which 
may be made in one type of cryptographic system may be peculiar to that type alone and to no 
other type; hence, the astute cryptanalyst 
is constantly on the lookout for instances of crypto- 
grams containing the specific type of error by which that system is handicapped. 
Furthermore, 
t,he general types of blunders or errors that may be committed are nearly as numerous as are the 
general types of cryptographic systems, so that no complete list of such as may be encountered in 
practice can be drawn up. 
c. After the cryptanalyst has by painstaking and more or less arduous labors solved a system 
and has become thoroughly familiar with its mechanics, he should carefully review the details of 
the mechanics to learn what things can go wrong, what sorts of mistakes the enemy cryptographic 
personnel are likely to make, and then study the external manifestations 
of these aberrations so that he 
may be able to recognize instances of their occurrence in subsequent cryptograms. This sort of study 
has no value in itself particularly; 
its importance lies in the fact that the effects of erroneous 
treatment may lead to very rapid solution or to quick recovery of keys to subsequent messages. 
d. Khen an unknown system is under investigation and the cryptanalyst is striving to iscer- 
tain just how it operates (which is often the most dficult 
step in solution), a study of the crypto- 
grams representing corrections to previous messages containing errors is a most fruitful source of 
data. 
Indeed, at times this sort of intensive study will yield clues for solving a system which 
might otherwise resist all efforts to break it down for a very long time. 
18. Significance of terms “special solution” and “general solution.“-a. 
Now the importance 
of the comments made in the foregoing paragraph will be clear if it is noted that a study of the 
blunders and errors often leads to the elaboration of methods for the rapid breaking down of 
cryptographic systems. 
But it must also be realized that in some cases no blunders or errors are 
essential to a rapid solution of the type alluded to above. 
Sometimes the very mechanics of 
(37)

Prev. Book

the sl-stem itself WE such that unavoidable 
or unpredictable circumstances arise so that special 
solutions become possible. 
The latter term calls for a bit of explanation. 
b. When the circumstances surrounding a specific cryptogram or set of cryptograms arc such 
as to present peculiar or unusual conditions that make a solution possible when in the absence of 
these conditions solution is either impossible or improbable, the methods employed in rc~aching a 
solution in such cases constitute u-hat is commonly termed a special solution. 
Some examples 
will be demonstrated very soon. Systems of which this may bc true are, of course, crpptographi- 
tally weak but’ it. may be observed that it is perhaps impossible to devis(x a system whicbh may be 
considered to be absolutely free from this source of weakness. 
c. The advantages of a special solution for any type of cryptographic system are, as a nlle, 
two in number. 
First, it often makes a solution possible when otherwise this might not be the 
case. Secondly, if often affords a method of achieving a very rapid solution in the case of a 
problem which otherwise might require a long time. 
But a special solution presents one basic 
disadvantage: It is by its very nature dependent upon the existence of unusual circumstances; in 
other words, upon chance or good fortune bringing about a set of circumstances favorable for a 
solution. 
Khen these unusual conditions or circumstances do not obtain, then solution may be 
impossible. 
Therefore, it is desirable to have, if possible, for every type of system A IMJIY or less 
general solution which may be applied in the absence of the unusual conditions necessary for the 
application of a special solution. 
In other words, a general solution in cryptanalysis implies a 
method or procedure which if applied in ordinary cases and under normal conditions will yield 
the solution. 
However, the term general solution in cryptanalysis must not be taken too literally. 
The situation in cryptanalysis is not exactly analogous to that which obtains in the field of pure 
mathematics, for the circumstances are often quit.e different in the two sciences. A general 
solution in mat’hematics is expected to, and will, solve every case that falls within its province; 
a general solution in cryptanalysis is likewise intended to solve every case that falls within its 
province but this usually partakes more of the nature of a prayer or hope than an espectation. 
PIIuch depends upon the amount of traffic available for study, the length of individual 
crypto- 
grams, and t,he indefinable element called luck, that is, a set of fort8uitous circumstances which 
happen to make a solution easy or diflicult, such as the presence of many or exceptionally long 
repetitions, etc. 
Furthermore, whereas in mathematics a general solution prescribes the exact 
steps to be followed in arriving at the solution and the latter can be applied in all instances 
without variation or deviation from a fixed procedure, in cryptanalysis a general solution merely 
outlines a broad path that may be followed in order to arrive at a solution. 
Application of a 
general solution in cryptanalysis in specific instances may involve minor detours to circumvent 
unexpected obstacles, or it may involve qdite large changes or modifications in the general 
procedure. 
19. Examples to be stadied.-u. 
As stated above in paragraph 17, a complete list of the 
specific blunders that cryptographic clerks are prone to perpetrate cannot be drawn up’. Certain 
of them may be described in general terms and examples given of some which have already been 
encountered in this and in preceding texts. 
Commonly it is the case that these blunders do not 
become evident until two or more cryptograms are available for comparison. 
One of the most 
frequent sources of circumstances leading to the transmission of cryptograms affording rich 
material for cryptanalytic 
comparison is the following: A cryptographic clerk prepares a crypto- 
gram, 
in the course of which he makes a mistake of such a nature as to render the cryptogram 
difllcult or impossible to decipher by the cryptographic clerk serving the addressee. A request 
for repetition ensues, whereupon the enciphering clerk reexamines his original work and finds that 
he has made amistake. He then commits the grave blunderof reenciphering the identical message 
(without paraphrasing) and transmitting 
what to the enemy cryptanalysts is obviously a second

39 
version of the original message. The consequences are often fatal t’o cryptographic 
security, 
The least that can happen is that the key for this particular message may be disclosed very 
quickly; more serious, the basic or primary elements for the entire day’s traffic may be wrested 
from the blunder; but most serious are the consequences if it happens that the blunder has been 
committed immediately or soon after a new cryptographic system has been instituted and the 
enemy cryptanalysts are exerting strenuous efforts t,o learn its mechanics, for then is n-hen the 
information to he gained is most valuable. 
b. In his previous studies the student has observed the many opportunities 
for quick 
cryptanalytic 
success afforded by enemy addiction to the use of stereotypic phraseology, espe- 
cially at the beginnings and endings of messages. Stereot,ypic phraseology affords even more 
golden opportunities 
for cryptanalytic 
success in the case of transposition systems than it does 
in the case of substitution 
systems. 
c. In the next few paragraphs some specific examples of the consequences of cryptographic 
blunders and ineptitude in the case of transposition systems will be studied. 
These are intended 
to give the student some idea of the far-reaching effects such studies may have. 
It is import,ant 
that he grasp the fundamental principles, for they will enable him to develop for himself the 
methods that he may find necessary in practical work. 
Incidentally, 
it may be added that the 
student should not get the idea that these instances are purely theoretical. 
It is sometimes almost 
unbelievable that cryptographic 
clerks with any common sense would perpetrate the stupid 
blunders that they do occasionally commit.

20. Solution when the beginning or end of the plain text is known.--a. 
It often happens, 
when correspondents have fallen into the bad habit of sending stereotyped communications, 
that the beginnings or the endings of messages become so fixed in their form and content that 
the enemy can with a fair degree of certainty guess what these w-ill be in specific cases. If so, 
a quick solution can be reached, the key reconstructed for one message, and this will, of course, 
enable him to read all other messages in the same key. 
This is particularly 
true of simple, 
keyed-columnar-transposition 
ciphers. 
It is only necessary that the cryptanalyst 
cut the test 
up in such a manner as to bring the letters composing the assumed text, all within the same TOW 
or rows of t’he transposition rectangle. 
b. Suppose that the enemy frequently uses the introductory 
espression REFERRING TO YOUR 
NUMBER. Here is a crvptogram assumed to begin with this phrase:

c. Assuming that previous experience has indicated that the enemy uses keys varying 
from 10 to 20 letters in length, the arrangement of the letters in the tops of columns under a 
key length of 10 would be as shown in Fig. 20.

The first group of the cryptogram begins with I M. The arrangement shown above gives I U 
as the top of a column; hence a key length of 10 is not correct. 
A key length of 11 is then tried.

columns of 10 letters. 
The text can now be marked off into sections of proper lengths and, more- 
over, guided by the letters which must be at the heads of columns, the text can be inscribed in 
the rectangle in key order. 
For example, column 1 must end with the second group, R M G R N; 
column 2 therefore begins with E R. There is only one possibility, 
viz, the fourth column. 
This is a long column, and must therefore have 11 letters, making column 3 begin with R Y. 
This definitely fixes the position of the number 3 in the key, and so on. 
The solution is reached 
after only a very few moments and is as shown in figure 23.

d. The same general principles, modified to suit the circumstances, may be followed in the 
case involving 
known or suspected endings of messages. The probable words are written out 
according to various assumed key lengths and the superimposed letters falling at the bottoms 
of columns are sought in the cryptogram. 
21. The case of an omitted colnmn.-u. 
Sometimes a very careless clerk omits a column in 
transcribing the text from the enciphering rectangle and fails to check the number of letters in 
the final cryptogram. 
Obviously such a cryptogram will be difficult if not impossible to decipher 
at the other end, and a repetition is requested and sent. If now the identical plain text is en- 
ciphered correctly, two cryptograms are at hand for comparison. 
This will disclose the length 
of one column, which can be assumed to be either a long one or a short one. The position, in 
the correct cryptogram, of the column omitted from the incorrect one will often afford direct 
clues as to the exact dimensions of the enciphering rectangle. 
For example, suppose the crypto- 
gram in paragraph 2Ob had first been transmitted as follows: 
CBYPTOQBAM 
IMAOD 
RMGRN 
RYEPB 
RCFTO 
IRNWT

B. The column which was omitted is E R N I N T U S F S D, and falls between columns 
1 and 3. Since the omitted column contains 11 letters and column 1 contains 10, the dimensions 
of the rectangle immediately become known. 
Thus, uncertainties as to the dimensions of the 
Page 47

Prev. Book

rectangle are dissolved and a large step forward has been made in the solution. 
Also, the 
general whereabouts of ~01umn~ 1 and 2 are now known, since the former is a short one, the 
latter a long one. 
22. The case of an interchanged pair of columns.--a. 
The keying element in the case of 
columnar transposition is simply a practical means of controlling the order in which the columns 
of t.he enciphering rectangle are transcribed in forming the cipher t,ext. Commonly this numerical 
key is derived from a literal key. 
Suppose that a cryptographic clerk makes a mistake in the 
latter step. For example, suppose that the literal key is ADMIRATION and t’hat as a result of a 
slight relaxation in attention he assigns the number 5 to the letter N and the number 6 to the 
letter 1f. 
A pair of columns will become interchanged as regards their order of selection in the 
transcription 
process, and likely as not a repetition will be requested by the addressee. If a 
second version is sent, enciphered by the correct key, a comparison of the two versions will dis- 
close the width of the enciphering rectangle and possibly the general position (left or right) of 
the columns that were interchanged. 
b. An example will serve to make the matter clear. Assume the two cryptograms to be as 
follows:

and difference noted.

Secondversion-ODNILNTTHDGSOHAOOQSGTER[NFUEHRW 
[NFUEHRWR]RIRATPEDETANOOCOOROGIOS 
R]PSINENE]RIRATPEDETANOOCOOROGIOS 
d. The two versions are alike except for a pair of interchanged sequences; the bracketed 
sequence P S I N E N E in the first version is matched by the same sequence in the second 
version, 
but 
at a different 
position 
in the message; likewise 
the bracketed 
sequence 
N F U E H R W R in the first version is matched by a similar sequence in the second version, 
but at a different position in the message. The various deductions which can be made from the 
situation will now be set forth. 
e. One of these sequences contains 7 letters, the other contains 8. It follows that the col- 
umns of the enciphering rectangle are probably 7 and 8 letters in length; hence, with 61 letters, 
the width of the matrix 
is 8. Since there are 23 letters from the beginning of the messages to the 
first point of their difference, it follows that there are 2 columns of 8 letters and 1 column of 7 
letters involved in this section [(2X8)+ 
(1 X7)=23], 
and that the error made in encipherment 
does not involve columns 1,2, or 3, which are therefore properly placed in the first version. Since 
Page 48

Prev. Book

the sequences which are interchanged are consecutive in the text it means that the numbers 4 
and 5 were interchanged in t.he key for the first version. 
Since one of these sequences is of 7 
letters, the other of 8 letters, one of the numbers, 4 or 5, applies to a long column, the other, to 
a short column. 
Since the second version is presumably the correct version, and since in the 
second version the S-letter sequence comes first, the key number 4 applies to a long column, the 
key number 5 to a short column in the correct version. 
Tvith the foregoing deductions in mind, 
the solution and the reconstruction of the numerical key becomes a simple matter. 
j. The text of the correct version is written out as seen in figure 25,. 
Seeing a Q in column 3 
and a U in column 4, these two columns are made adjacent by sliding column 3 one interval down- 
ward, as shown in figure 25b. 
In the latter, column 7 has also been placed at the second interval 
to the right of column 5, because the latter yields good trigraphs with columns 34. 
Seeing the 
trigraph T R 0 near the bottom of columns 3-4-5 and the letters 0 and P in the same row, sug- 
gests the word TROOP. The columns are to be rearranged to make this word TROOP. There are

two columns which have an 0 in the proper row, columns 2 and 8. The trial of combination 
34-5-8-6, 
while producing TROOP in the proper row, gives bad pentagraphs in the other rows; 
but the combination 34-5-2-6 
shows excellent pentagraphs, as will be seen in figure 25~. The 
words SQUADRON and HOSTILE are clearly evident; the completion of the rectangle is now a 
very simple matter. 
The result is shown in figure 25d. 
The recovery of the numerical key now 
will enable other cryptograms to be read directly. 
23. lldessages with similar beginnings-u. 
In military 
correspondence it is often the case 
that somewhat similar instructions 
or information 
must be conveyed by a superior commander 
to several subordinate commanders simultaneously. 
Such a situation frequently results in the 
circumstance that two or more cryptograms addressed to diBerent stations will begin with exactly 
t,he same words. 
When simple columnar transposition is the system used for encipherment, 
then it will result, in such cases as the foregoing, that the first two or more rows of the transposi- 
tion rectangle will be identical in the messages which begin alike. 
Therefore, the cryptograms 
will show identical sequences of two or more letters, distributed 
throughout the texts and by 
studying these identities the cryptanalyst is able at once not only to ascertain the width of the 
rectangle but also to divide up the cipher text into sections corresponding with the exact columns 
of the rectangle, thus eliminating 
the only real difliculty 
in solution, tiz, the determination 
of 
which are the long columns, which the short. 
An example will demonstrate the short cut to 
solution which such a situation provides. 
b. Here are two cryptograms which are assumed to have been intercepted within a few min- 
utes of each other, the messages being addressed to two battalion commanders by the regimental 
commander.

c. The cryptanalyst, noting the similarities in the first few letters of the two messages, care- 
fully compares the two texts, looking for additional identical sequences of letters between the 
cryptograms. 
For example, Xo. 1 begins with B N T S E and so does Xo. 2; after an interval 
of 4 letters in Xo. 1 and 5 letters in so. 2 he notes the identical sequences L C E T; after an 
interval of 5 letters in h’o. 1 and 5 letters in No. 2 he notes the identical sequences E R R 0, 
and so on. 
The identities are underlined or marked in some distinctive manner throughout the 
texts, as shown in figure 26.

d. Now it is obvious that these identities exist because the two messages begin alike, and 
by taking advantage of the identical portions in the cryptograms it will be possible to transcribe 
the texts of the latter into transposition rectangles which will not only have the identical por- 
tions in homologous positions, but also will show which are long columns, which are short. 
All that is necessary is to begin transcribing the texts on cross-section paper, in columns, arranging 
matters so that the identical sequences will fall at the tops of the columns. 
Thus, the first 
column of No. 1 will contain the letters B N T S E A R K C and the first column of No.2 will 
contain the letters B N T S E I N D 0 T; the second column of No. 1 will contain the letters 
L C E T T N B I T and the second column of No. 2will contain theletters L C E T S A F P L,

and so on. 
It appears that the identical portion embraces the first four roes of the rectangle and 
runs over a number of letters on the fifth row. 
This is because the identical sequences consist 
of 4 and j letters. 
Figure 27~ sh ows the identities between the first 5 columns of the two trans- 
position rectangles. 
Only once in the case of this particular example does any uncertainty arise 
as to exactly where an identical sequence begins or ends, and that is in connection with the 
seventh pair of identities, involvin, p the series of letters A E F T F S N P G N P in No. 1, and 
A E F T F S T 0 N T N in Il’o. 2. These sequences contain 6 identical letters, but even here 
the uncertainty is of only a moment’s duration: The initial letter A does not belong to the iden- 
tical portions at the top of the transposition rectangle because the A’s are needed to complete 
columns 6 in both rectangles. 
(If the A were placed at the head of column 7 in No. 1, then 
column 6 would lack a letter at the bottom.) 
Cases of “accidental 
identities” 
of course com- 
plicate the process of cutt,ing up the text into the respective columns, but they only serve to 
add a small degree of interest to what would otherwise be a purely cut and dried process. 
The final results of the transcription 
into columns are shown in figure 2ib.

e. It is obvious from a comparison of these two skeletonized matrices, and a consideration 
of the fact that the long columns must of necessity go to the left side, that the numbers 7 and 10 
occupy the first two positions in the key, and that the numbers 2, 4, 11, and 13 occupy the last 
four positions in the key.

24. Messages with similar endings.--o. 
What has been said at the beginning at the pre- 
ceding paragraph with respect to the nature of military 
correspondence and the presence of 
identical phraseology in the messages sent by a superior commander to his subordinates also 
operates to produce messages in which the endings are identical. 
It has been noted that when 
two messages with similar beginnings are available for comparison, the reconstruction of the 
transposition rectangles and the recovery of the transposition key is an easy matter. 
It will 
now be shown that solution is an even easier matter when two messages having identical endings 
are available for study.

The 
cryptanalyst 
now carefully compares the two tests, searching for identical sequences of 
letters, but in this case instead of trying to locate identities in what may be termed a parallel 
progression (as in the preceding case) he searches for identical sequences of two or more letters 
appearing in both messages. For example, in t.he present case, he notes the sequence T R 0 
forming the final trigraph of the 8th group of XO. 
1 and finds a similar sequence forming the 
initial trigraph of the 13th group of I%o. 2. Going through both cryptograms in this way, all the 
identities ore marked off in some fashion, by colored crayon or underlining, as shown below. 
In 
this search for identities the cryptanalyst 
bears in mind that when all have been found they 
should be distributed at quite regular intervals throughout the text. 
For example, note in the 
following that the identities in Eo. 1 fall at int,ervals of 6 letters, with one exception; in T\‘o. 2 
they fall at intervals of 4 letters, with one exception. 
The intervals between identities serve 3s a 
guide in finding them. 
After they have all been located, the identities in the cryptograms are 
numbered serially.

c. The identities between the two cryptograms may now be equated, using for this purpose 
the numbers below the identities. 
For instance, identity 1 in cryptogram 1 matches identity 7 
in cryptogram 2; identity 2 in crytogram 1 matches identity 6 in cryptogram 2, and so on. Thus:

13 identities), the rectangle for cryptogram 1 contains 12 columns of 8 letters and 1 column of 9 
letters. 
Cryptogram 2 has 81 letters, and its rectangle contains 10 columns of 6 letters and 3 
columns of 7 letters. 
The rectangle of cryptogram 1 has but 1 long column, whereas that of 
cryptogram 2 has 3 long columns. Relative to the position the last letter in each rectangle occu- 
pies in the last row of the rectangle, it is obvious that the last letter of the rectangle for crypto- 
gram 2 is 2 letters in advance of the last letter of the rectangle for cryptogram 1. Using this 
difference, viz, 2, a cyclic sequence is generated from the series of equivalencies given above. 
Thus, the equivalent of identity 1 of cryptogram 1 is identity 7 of cryptogram 2, and the number 
7 is placed two intervals to the right of the number 1; the equivalent of identity 7 of cryptogram 
1 is identity 11 of cryptogram 2, and the number 11 is placed two intervals to the right of number 
7, and so on until the following sequence is obtained:

e. The equivalent of ident,ity 9 of cryptogram 
1 is identity 4 of cryptogram 2, and the num- 
ber 4 is plnced between the numbers 1 and 7 in this sequence, for the sequence may be regarded 
as partaking of the nnture of a cycle or a continuous series. From this point on, the process is 
the same 3s before, and finally the following is obtained:

f. dfter little experiment it becomes obvious that column 8 belongs on the extreme left 
because in cryptogram 1 there is only one long column, number 8, ascertained by counting the 
number of letters between successive identities in that message. The number 8 being at the 
extreme left the final actual transposition key is 8 10 3 12 9 1 4 i 2 11 6 13 5. The completely’ 
deciphered messages are shown in figure 28.

g. The possibility of the rapid solution of columnar transposition ciphers by means of the 
method of similar beginnings and endings, constitutes one of the most serious drawbacks to the 
use of transposition ciphers in military 
cryptography, 
because it is almost impossible to avoid 
such cases where many messages must be sent in the same key each day. 
25. Solution of a single message containing a long repetition.--a. 
Sometimes a lengthy phrase 
or a series of numbers (spelled out in letters) is repeated within a message and if the message ij 
enciphered by a transposition rectangle of such narrow width (in comparison with the length of 
the repetition) that the repeated portion forms identical sequences within the text of the crypto- 
gram, 
a solution somewhat similar in principle to that explained in paragraph 24 may be achieved 
within a few minutes. 
5. Note the following cryptogram, in which identical portions have been underlined.

c. There are 18 segments of underlined letters, which means in this case that the rectangle is 
9 columns wide, because the repeated portion in the text. will give rise to two repeated sequences 
in each column. 
This means that the rectangle has 7 columns of 19 letters and 2 columns of 18 
letters. 
The first two segments may t,herefore be assigned the numbers la and lb, since they 
come from column 1; the next two segments may be assigned the numbers 2a and 2b, since they 
come from column 2, and so on, as shown above. 
Identical segments may now be equated. 
Thus: 
la 
2a 
3a 
4a 
5a 
6a 
7a 
8a 
9a 
3b 
4b 
2b 
9b 
8b 
lb 
6b 
7b 
5b 
This gives rise to the cycle l-3-24-9-5-8-7-6, 
which is a cyclic permutation 
of the actual 
transposition key. 
d. By transcribing the text into a rectangle of proper width, “cutting” 
the columns so as to 
bring t,he identical portions within the same rows, the result shown in figure 29 is obtained.

e. Study of figure 29 shows that columns 2 and 7 are the short, columns and belong on the 
right, either in the sequence 2-7 or 7-2. 
The cyclic permutation of the transposition key obtained 
in subparagraph c is l-3-24-9-5-8-7-6. 
In order to bring the 2 and 7 adjacent in a sequence 
2-7 or 7-2 one must take intervals of 5 and 4, respectively, and “decimate” the cycle, giving the 
following: 
l-5-3-8-2-74-6-9 
or 1-9-64-7-2-8-3-5. 
Since columns 2 and 7 belong on 
the right, the key must be: 4-6-9-l-5-3-8-2-7 
or 8-3-5-1-9-64-7-2, 
Only a few moments are 
necessary to establish the correctness of the former alternative and the solution is at hand. 
It is 
as shown in figure 30. 
f. A good understanding of the principles elucidated in this and the preceding paragraph 
will enable the student to derive for himself the procedure applicable to cases of somewhat 
similar nature, such as that wherein a single letter or a whole group has been omitted from the

fist version of a message and a second (correction message) is sent without paraphrasing the 
original test; or that wherein two messages are alike except. for a difference in a single word (such 
as a number) and are cryptographed by identical transposition keys, or that wherein the numeri- 
cal key has been incorrectly derived from :he lit,eral key and two versions of the same plain text are 
available for comparison, one based on a transposition by means of the incorrect key, the second 
based on a transposition by means of the correct key, both keys, however, being of the same 
length. 
26. Solution when several cryptograms of identical length and in the same key are avail- 
able--u. 
Although the method to be described in this paragraph is included within the category 
of special solutions, it is of such general applicability 
that it might well be treated as a general 
solution for all transposition systems. 
It is based upon the very mechanics of transposition as a 
cryptographic scheme, viz, that the essential feature of the transposition method consists merely 
in the alterations in the positions of the elements (letters, groups of letters, or words) composing 
the plain text, according to a specific key. It follows, therefore, that the respective elements of 
two or more messages of identical lengths, when transposed according t,o the same key, will undergo 
identical alterations in position in the course of encipherment, and therefore all plain-text 
ele- 
ments occupying homologous positions in t&? original messages will emerge in homologous posi- 
tions ‘in the cryptograms. 
The sit,uation is very much like that which may be observed in the 
movements executed by t’wo symmetrical groups of dancers in a chorus. 
Suppose each group 
consists of 8 dancers starting originally in definite positions relative to one another. 
V&en a 
movement. is executed each dancer in each group performs certain evolutions; at the conclusion 
of the movement the 8 dancers in each group may be in quite different positions relative to one 
another than they were at the beginning of the movement, but the correspondingly numbered 
dancers in both groups End themselves in identical positions relative to their neighbors. 
Of 
course, the fact that in this analogy the groups are based upon 8’s is of no significance; if the 
groups consisted of many more t’he principle would still apply. 
Another way of looking at the 
matter is to call attention to the fact that in any type of transposition 
the position which a specified 
letter or element of the plain text will occupy in the final cryplogram is quite de$nitely a junaion 
of the 
number of letters or elements in the plain text itself. 
For example, suppose that a plain-text message 
contains exactly 100 letters, and suppose that the transposition system and specific key is duch 
that the 1st plain-text letter appears as the 17t,h cipher-text letter, the 2d plain-t.ext letter, as the 
68th, and so on; in another message of exactly 100 letters, enciphered by the same general system 
and specific key, it is obvious that the 1st plain-text letter must also appear as the 17th cipher- 
text let,ter, the 2d plain-text letter, as the 68th, and so on. 
In short., all corresponding!y num- 
bered plain-text letters in both messages will appear in iden tical positions in the crypt,ograms. 
b. Granting the obvious truth of the foregbing, to what use can it be put in the solution of 
transposition 
ciphers? 
Simply this: It enables the cryptanalyst 
to reconstruct the plain 
texts of 
cryptograms of identical 
length without even knowing what the transposition 
key or system w&s that 
produced them. 
The process is not. at all complicated and if there are several messages the 
process is very easy. It consists in superimposing the several cryptograms and anagramming 
the columns formed by the superimposition, for it is obvious that any circumstances which can 
be used as a guide for rearranging the letters in one of the lines of superimposed text in order 
to form plain text will require, and can be checked by, the results of an identical rearrangement 
of the corresponding letters of the other lines of superimposed text. 
c. An example of the method involving 
the application of this general solution will now 
be given, using as a basis five messages assumed to have been enciphered by an unknown but 
complex type of transposition. 
It will now be shown how the security of such a system is demol- 
ished when it is used by a large number of i.ntercQmmunicating commands.

d. Let the following be five cryptograms isolated from among many messages intercepted 
on the same day and therefore suspected of being in the same key. 
These five cryptograms 
have been isolated because they all contain exactly the same number of letters. 
They are here 
shown superimposed (fig. 31) and therefore all the letters in one column have undergone exactly 
the same evolutions or changes in position in the course of encipherment.

e. Noting a Q in message 1 column 51, the obligatory sequence Q U is assumed to be present 
in that message. There is in message 1 but one U, which is fortunate. 
Combining columns 51 
and 23, the results are found to be fair (fig. 32~). 
The H T in the third row suggests a word 
ending in G H T, such as FIGHT, MIGHT, EIGHT, etc. 
Searching in message 3 for a G, two candi- 
dates are found: columns 10 and 30. The t,rigraphs yielded by each combination are shown in 
figure 32b. 
The second of the two possibilit,ies looks much the better.

first row suggests the word SQUARE or SQUADRON; that in the last row suggests BATTLE or 
ATTALION. 
This means that a column with an A at the top and a T at the bottom should be 
sought. 
There is only one such column, 31. 
Adding it to the 30-51-23 combination gives 
what is shown in figure 33~. Looking for a column with a D at the top (for SQUAD) and either an 
A (for BATTALION) or an L (for BATTLE), there is only one candidate, column 22, yielding the 
sequences shown in figure 33b. 
Enough has been shown of the procedure to make further demon- 
stration unnecessary. 
Once a good start has been made, progress is quite rapid, unless the 
cryptanalyst 
is unfortunate 
and arrives at a point where all the messages simultaneously ter- 
minate in complete words, without a clue as to what follows or precedes in any one of the mes- 
sages. In such a contingency the only thing he can do is to try all sorts of possible continuations, 
either “fore” or ‘[aft,” that is, in front of the original starting point or after it, until he picks up 
another word which will enable him to continue. 
Or he may have to search for a new point of 
entry and build upon that, later joining this structure with the other. 
In the case under ex- 
amination no serious di@iculties are found and the entire set of five messages is reconstructed. 
f. In the course of this reconstruction the numbers applicable to the columns become assem- 
bled in proper sequence, that is, in the correct order to reproduce the plain text.

g. The solut,ion by superimposing and anagramming equal-length messages 
in the case of 
transposition constit,utes a gsned 
so,!&ion which is applicable in all cases without exception. 
Indeed, the possibility of solution by this method constitutes the most serious, if not fatal, weak- 
ness of transposition as a cryptographic method, for not only is it applicable to the most complex 
as well as to the most simple types of transposition, but, what is much more serious, the pro- 
cedure is very simple, requiring very little cryptanalytic 
ingenuity 
or expertness. 
The chief 
disadvantage of this general solution is, of course, that it is dependent upon the more or less 
fort,uitous availability 
of messages of identical lengths, and while t,his f0rtunat.e contingency is 
quite frequent in a voluminous correspondence, it would naturally 
be better from the point of 
view of the cryptanalyst 
if this requirement were not essential in all cases. Deeper study of 
the subject will show that the method can still be applied in a modified way to the case of mes- 
sages of almost the same lengths when the transposition is not too involved. 
To illustrate, 
a case of simple keyed-columnar transposition will be used and it will be assumed that several 
messages of approximately identical lengt,hs are at hand. 
h. First, take the case of two messages which have been enciphered by completely-filled 
rectangles, one meswge 
having, for example, one more row of letters than the other. 
In the 
discussion, the consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . will be employed as though they constituted 
the successive letters of a plain-text message that is being enciphered. 
This method of treat- 
ment is very useful in connection with studies of the mechanics of transposition 
ciphers in 
general, and especially so in the case of double transposition. 
Note the P+C! sequences that 
result from the transposition:

It is obvious that the two sequences may be superimposed so as to bring identical sections into 
superimposition. 
Thus:

The T, blank spaces in the B line mark the ends of the columns in the transposition rectangle. 
The regularity in the distribution 
of the blank spaces follows from the mechanics of encipherment. 
If two messages were superimposed in this manner it is clear t,hat a solution by anagramming 
becomes perfectly feasible. 
Moreover, anagramming of columns is perhaps unnecessarv, for 
anagramming merely the lett,ers that would occupy in line ,4 the positions marked by the blanks 
in line B will yield the transposition key direct,ly. 
Extension of these principles to the case in 
which the two rectangles differ by 2, 3, 4, . , . complete rows is obvious. 
i. Taking next a case wherein two rectangles differ by one or two letters in the bottom row, 
it is clear that by shifting the letters of one message one or two spaces to the right (or left) from 
a given point will bring most of the text into proper superimposition for a solution by anagram- 
ming.

FIGURE 366 
It is possible to superimpose these two sequences by shifting the sections in line B after certain 
numbers. 
Thus:

In the case of actual messages corresponding to the foregoing P+C sequences, superimposition 
of the two texts in the manner indicated would at once permit of a solution by anagramming of 
columns. 
The unknown factor, of course, is the location of the blank spaces. Where the two 
messages differ in length by only one or two letters brief experimentation would tell the story; 
where the messages differ in length by a good many letters the process would be much more 
difI?cult but not at all hopeless of fruitful results. 
Only a small section of text reconstructed by 
anagramming will soon lead to complete solution. 
Hence, it follows that by regulating the num- 
ber of blanks to be left here and there and judicious shifting of sections of text, solution by super- 
imposing and anagr amming homologous sections of text from several messages in the same trans- 
position key will often be possible.

j. The foregoing principles will naturally not be applicable to cases where two messages diff cr 
in length by but one letter and this small difference brings about a profound difference in the P-4’ 
sequences applicable to the messages. This is what happens often in the case of true double 
transposition,l but the principle can nevertheless be applied even here. An e.xplanation of the 
procedure lies beyond the scope of the present text, however, and no more will be indicated herein 
concerning the matter in the case of true double transposition. 
However, in certain cases of 
combined substitution-transposition 
to be discussed in a later portion of this text the principles 
elucidated in these last. few subparagraphs may be found to be applicable. 
27. Reconstruction of the keys in double transposition-u. 
Having reconstructed the plain 
texts of the messages solved by superimposing and anagramming, as esplained in paragraph 
26 d, e, can the transposition key be found? 
First, it is necessary to ascertain whether a single 
columnar transposition had been used and, if not, then the assumption will be that a double 
transposition had been used. 
b. If a single transposition were the case, the relationship pointed out in paragraph 16c, con- 
cerning the existence of a constant difference between successive elements of the P+C sequence, 
should obtain. 
Having the C-+P sequence, the P+C sequence may readily be established by 
inversion of the former. 
Hence, the P-4 
sequence is constructed by inversion, as shown in 
figure 36a.

c. (1) Since there appears to be no constant difference between successive terms in the 
P ---, C sequence in figure 36a, single columnar transposition is ruled out and double transposition 
is assumed to have been employed. 
In passing, it is worthwhile noting that the reconstruction 
of the keys employed in the case of true double transposition,is 
quite important, because it is 
often the case that concentrated effort directed toward the cryptanalysis of one or more messages 
and the subsequent recovery of the transposition 
keys will, of course, greatly facilitate 
the 
reading of all other messages in the same keys. 
(2) There are at least four methods suited to the purpose and they will be dealt with in an 
order most conducive to their comprehension by the student. 
(3) A preliminary to the reconstruction of the keys in the case of each of the four methods 
to be studied consists in establishing or ascertaining the width of either the T-l 
or the T-2 
matrix, usually the former, because it is easier to do.

(4) As in paragraph 26h,, the exposition will employ matrices in which the consecutive 
numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . take the place of the successive plain-text 
letters in the T-l matrix, 
because in such handling significant facts arising from the mechanics of encipherment are brought 
to light. 
d. In order to study the effects of true double transposition on this matter of reconstructing 
the keys an example will be employed, involving 
transposition with two different keys.

Nothing in the nature of a series of constant differences between successive terms is now discernible 
in the P + C sequence. But there is, as can readily be seen, a fairly constant relationship 
betKeen segments or sections of this sequence. For example, take the 1st to 6th terms of this 
P + C sequence (20 06 48 33 
15), set them under the 29th to 34th terms (28 
14 05 41 
23), and fmd the dserence between superimposed numbers. 
(When the minuend is less than 
the subtrahend the superimposed terms are disregarded.) 
Thus:

There is a constant difference between the superimposed terms. 
The reason for its appearance 
is not hard to understand if reference is made to figure 37a and the matter is studied in the light 
of the mechanics of the method of encipherment. 
As for the two terms 28 and the 20, while 
they come from different columns in the T-2 mat,rix, both come from the same column of the 
T-l matrix, as do 14 and 06, 41 and 33, 23 and 15. But the 05 and the 48 not only come from 
different columns in the T-2 matrix, but also from different columns in the T-l 
matrix, this 
representing a case where there is a transit from the bottom of one column to the top of the next 
column in the transposition process. &‘ow the constant difference is in this case 8 because 
the superimposed terms happen to be sequent in t’he columns in which they fall in the T-l matrix. 
If the superimposed terms are in the same column in the T-l matrix but separated by one row, 
the constant difference will be 16; if separated by two rows, the constant difference will be 24, 
and so on. 
Thus, for example: 
6th to 11th terms ________________ 
-_--_- ..___.__________ 
2 44 30 21 03 39 
29th to 34th terms ___________ 
-__------- . . . ..____________ 
28 14 05 41 23 
16 16 16 
16 
Here the difference, 16, is a multiple of 8 because the superimposed terms are separated by one 
row in the T-l matrix, as can be seen by referring to figure 37a. 
e. The foregoing phenomena afford a method of ascertaining the width of the T-l matrix 
in an unknown case, and, as noted above, this constitutes the first step in recovering the transposi- 
tion key or keys. 
For if a study be made of the terms of the P + C sequence in figure 36a, 
based upon finding sections thereof which show a constant difference, the latter will correspond 
to either the width of the T-l 
matrix 
or a multiple of the width. 
An easy way to make this 
study is to take a section of the P + C sequence in figure 36a, add 5, 6, 7, . . . (in successive 
steps) to each term of the selected section, and then look for repetitions between t,he original 
P + C sequence and tbe P + C sequence plus the additive. 
A beginning will be made with an 
assumption of a T-l 
matrix of 5 columns. 
Since the cryptograms contain only 51 letters, all 
totals greater than 51 will be disregarded. 
Hence it is best to take a section which has a long 
series of low numbers, so that when the additive is applied the majority of the totals will not 
exceed 51. Such a series is the following (only one term in it, the 29th, is close to the maximum):

Searching for repetitions between the P+C sequence and the P+C sequence $5, the results are 
negative. 
Trial is then made of additives 6 to 11, inclusive, with similar negative results. When 
an additive of 12 is applied, however, the results obtained give positive indication that the T-l 
matrix is 12 columns in width.

The width of the T-l matrix is therefore 12 and its outlines may at once be drawn, since the total 
number of letters in each message, 51, indicates that there are 3 long columns of 5 letters and 9 
short columns of 4 letters.

f. (1) There is another method of ascertaining the width of the T-1 
matrix, 
which is perhaps 
a bit shorter and more direct thnn that described above. 
Basically both methods are the same, 
the one now to be presented being but another way of looking at the matter. 
Suppose that the 
differences between successive t,erms in the P-X 
sequence of figure 3ia arc calculated and set 
down as shown below, and then repetitions are sought in the series of differences, the latter 
constituting 
what will hereinafter be termed the P-4 
intemal sequence.

indicated in analogous cryptanalytic 
procedure. 
Now take the longest repetition, -14-9+36

The other repetitions will show the same constant difference. 
The terms which produce the 
repetitions will be found to be located in the same columns of the T-2 matrix in figure 37a, and 
reference to that figure will show that the constant difference between the sets of terms producing 
repetitions in the P+C interval sequence is merely the result. of the mechanics of encipherment.

This is identical with the results found by the other method. 
The T-l matrix for the messages 
of paragraph 26d is therefore 12 columns in width. 
g. Having ascertained the width of the T-l 
matrix, the next step is to ascertain whether 
the width of the T-2 matrix is the same as that for the T-l, or different. 
If the same, the sus- 
picion is warranted that the transposition keys for both matrices may be identical, in which case 
it is necessary to recover but one key. 
If the widths of the two matrices are different, then 
it is obvious that tsvo different transposition keys are involved. 
Having ascertained the widths 
of both matrices, one can proceed to reconstruct the transposition key or keys which apply 
thereto. 
There are, as stated once before, at least four methods suitable for this purpose. 
They 
will now be taken up in turn, and each method will be explained in detail. 
h. (1) In explaining the first method the discussion will be initiated with a reconsideration 
of figure 37~. If the C-+P sequence established in that figure is treated as though it were plain 
text and enciphered by the double transposition method, using the same two transposition keys 
as before, an interesting phenomenon is observed.

Here it is seen that the numbers in the columns of the T-2 matrix are consecutive. 
Obviously, if 
the columns of this T-2 matrix were retranscribed in a matrix of the same outlines as the T-l 
matrix, the numbers would be consecutive in rows and would represent the plain-text sequence 
1, 2, 3, . . . , inscribed within a T-l matrix in the normal fashion.

The result of these three steps has been to effect a return to the original T-l matrix containing 
plain text in normal sequence. The principal point to be noted here is the appearance of the 
T-2 matrix in figure 37c, for it is the basis of the first method for recovering the transposition 
key-s, as well as for other operations in connection with double transposition. 
(2) To demonstrate the procedure, the data afforded by figure 37~ again will be employed. 
Let the C+P sequence be inscribed within a matrix of 8 columns (the width having been estab- 
lished by one of the methods set forth in subpars. d-f).

The positions of vertical lines to be placed at the left and right to mark the exact.outlines of the 
matrix may now readily be found by referring to the matrix in figure 3ie. 
It is obvious that the 
column with the terms 11-15 belongs at the extreme left of the T-2 matrix, the coltnnn with the

By referring to the T-l matrix of figure 37~ and the foregoing structure, the key for T-1 can be 
recovered. 
It is 6-2-7-l-5-3-8-4.

It is 3-9-l-74-2-11-8-10-6-5. 
k. Applying this method to the messages solved in paragraph 26d-e, the steps are. as follows: 
The width of the T-l matrix has been established as being 12. The P+C interval sequence in 
figure 36b shows the repetition 
$3 +5 - 14 -11 -3 
appearing two t,imes; the repetition 
$3 +5 - 14 appearing t.hree times; and the repetition

It is now easy to u-rite the transposition key over the T-l matris: 4-i-l-S-2-5-9-1

By following the numbers in the P+C sequence the transposition kty for tlie T-2 ma tris is

hole the width of the T-l matrix can be ascertained from a stud-y of the P--X sequence; the \l-orli

Since sections 1, 4, and i of the PAZ! sequence contain 5 terms ( = long columns), the other 
sections only 4 (= short columns), it follows that the key numbers 4-7-l go to the left and the 
actual key for t,he T-2 matrix is 4-7-l-8-2-5-9-11-3-12-10-6. 
Since the number of elements 
in this key is the same as in the key for the T-l matrix, it is likely that the same key is employed 
for both transpositions. 
Simple experiment will quickly verify this assumption and the trans- 
position matrices for the first of t,he 5 messages of pa.ragraph 26d may be seen in the following

:i casual examination of these three rows of numbers discloses an intcrcsting inrarinnf

sllip hct\vccn any pair of superimposed numbers in rows 1 nnd 2 nntl in rows 2 ant1 3. I’01 
instance, tnkc the very first pnir, 03 
O1 in rows 1 nnd 2; in rows 3 nnd 3 the same pair of s~lpcr- 
imposed numbers will be found (under term Xo. 14). This same relationship exists bctn-ceil :111 
the superimposed pairs in 1’0~s 1-2 and 2-3. 
(2) Given only the third row of numbers in figure 36k. that is? the I’-&‘, 
S~II~‘I\CC 
(n-hieh 
has heretofore been designated merely as the P-4 
sequence). obtnincd as a result of a solution 
by superimposing and anagramming several messages, it is not difficult to reconstruct the second 
row! the P--C1 sequence. The width of the T-l matrix can be ascertained by either of the two 
methods indicated in subpnragraphs e and j. 
It is now known to be 12. A 12-col~unn matrix 
is therefore constructed, containing 51 cells numbered in the normal manner. 
This will, of 
course, give the T-l matrix seen in figure 36j. but nithout 
the transposition key or the letters 
.n the cells. 
Thus:

The invariant 
relationship pointed out in subparagraph (1) above may now be used to est,ab- 
lish the T-l key. 
Since the key is known to contnin 12 elements, a stnrt map be made with 
any one of 12 possibilities. 
Suppose that’ the key begins with 1. The first five terms in the 
P-&i 
sequence would be as indicated herewith: 
1. Term number ____________________________ 
01 02 
03

2. P+C1 sequence __________________________

Two “conflicts” 
or contradictions are at once manifested: ii in rows 1 and 2, ii in rows 2 and 3; 
also, yi in rows 1 and 2, :i in rows 2 and 3. The conclusion is obvious that the key number 1 
does not occupy the 1st position in the transposition key. 
Suppose key number 1 belongs in the 
2d position in the keg. 
The superimposed sequences are then as follows: 
1. Term number ____________________________ 
01 oz

Here again two conflicts are noted: o2 m rows 1 and 2, o2 in rows 2 and 3; yi in rows 1 and 2, 2T 
in rows 2 and 3. Only a single contradiction is suflicient to permit of discarding an hypothesis. 
The key number 1 does not occupy the 2d position in the key. 
A trial is made of t,he 3d position 
for key number 1. The results are as follows:

The application of the foregoing phenomena in the case under study is obvious. 
Here it is not 
even necessary to ascertain the width of the T-l 
matrix before proceeding to try to establish 
the T-l 
key. 
Of course, the number of chains which may be established will vary with the

npplicd. 
In sornc C:IWS it may be necessary to justaposr two different chains obtained by 
cxqunting terms from rows I and 3, rather than juxtaposing one chain against itself. 
Only a 
few minutes csperimcntation 
will be necessary to establish contradictions which will permit of 
discarding fallacious h>-pothcses. 
0. (1) In the foregoing esplnllation, the two transposition keys and matrices were identical. 
Even n-hrn they arc tliffercnt the same principles, with minor modifications, may be applied. 
The matrices and kc-s of figure 37~. will again bc employed to dcmonstmtc the ncccssary modi- 
lications. 
(2) First, prcparc the two matrices with consecutive numbers in the cells of both matrices, 
as shown at A ant1 B in figure 370 and then prepare the T-2 matrix, shown at C.

Xote, now, the invariant 
relationship 
between rows l-2 and 3-4. 
The same phenomenon is 
here manifested as was encountered in the preceding case where the T-l and T-2 matrices and 
keys were iden tical. 
It follows, therefore, that the principles elucidated under subparagraph m 
map be applied, with some modifications, also to. the case where different keys and matrices are 
employed for double transposition. 
The width of the T-l 
matris may be ascertained in the 
manner already indicated; an assumption is made as to the position occupied by key number 1 
of the T-l key; this assumption provides data for making an assumption as to the width of the 
T-2 matrix. 
When the correct pair of assumptions is made, the data in rows 1 and 2 are cor- 
roborated by t.hose in rows 3 and 4. From that point on t.he rest is eas7 and follows along the 
same lines as before. 
p. (1) The procedure will be illustrated 
by employing the P-X! sequence in figure 37b 
(which is the same as tha.t labelled P-C, 
sequence in figure 37~), it being assumed that nothing 
is known about the matrices, and that t,he sequence was obtained from a solution by superim- 
posing and anagramming scverd mrssagfls of identical length.

(4) An attempt is now made to construct a T-2 matrix which will produce the distribution 
and spacing of the numbers in row 3. For example, from the position of the number 05 the matrix 
would have to be of such dimensions that there are short columns of 2 letters and long columns of 
3 letters; or short columns of 3 letters and long columns of 4 letters. 
The former hypothesis 
can be discarded at once, for the intervals between the numbers 03, 07, 02, 01, and 06 in row 3 
make it untenable. 
The latter hypothesis may a.lso be discarded, for the intervals between 03 
and 07 and between 01 and 06 make it impossible. 
Hence key number 1 cannot, occupy the first 
position in the T-l 
key. 
Position 2 is assumed for key number 1 and the procedure repeated, 
also without good results. 
Note what happens u-hen position 4 is assumed for key number 1 in 
the T-l key:

(‘7) In the first place note, in row 2, the c,onstant difference 8 , giving manv corroborations 
that the width of the T-l matrix is 8; in the second pluce 
no conflicts whatever become manifest 
between the pairs of rows. 
Thus, the validity of the assumption of a T-2 matrix with 11 columns 
is well tsta blished. 
The rest follows quite readily, with the final result that figure 37r becomes 
completccl, and the recovery of both keys is a simple matter. 
In fact, both keys may be rstab- 
lished from a simple study of rows 2 and 3 of the final figure (which would, of course, be identical 
with that shown in fig. 37~ and need not here be repeatedj. 
Q. A careful study and good grasp of the principles and methods elucidated in this paragraph 
will be sufficient to indicate to the student that, when, as a result of a close study of several 
messages in tbc same keys, partial C-+P sequences become available, the entire C-+1’ sequence 
or sequences can usually be reconstructed from the partial sequence or sequences and the mes- 
sages solved without 
too much difficulty. 
For instance, suppose it has developed that the 
enemy 1la.s become addicted to stereotypic beginnings, so that the first fen- letters of a message 
or of several messages can be reconstructed with some assurance of certainty. 
The construction 
of partial C-+P sequenc,es and their completion by means of the principles set forth, especially 
those presented in subparagraphs m-p, may result in reconstruction 
of the completr C-+P 
sequences and ultimate recovery of the transposition key or keys. 
28. Special cases of solution of double transposition ciphers.--a. 
When the double trans- 
position system is employed in the field and is used for a voluminous traffic it is almost inevitable 
that certain situations will arise which make possible a rather easy solution. 
Aside from the case 
in which several cryptograms of identical length and in the same key are intercepted, other cases 
of a special nature may arise. 
Some of these will be discussed in this paragraph. 
b. First, there is the case in which an inexperienced cryptographic clerk fails t,o execute the 
double transposition properly and causes the transmission of a cryptogram which is only a single 
transposition. 
The solution of this message will be a simple matter and will, of course, yield the 
key. 
If the key is the same for both transpositions it is obvious that t’his will permit the reading 
of all other messages even though the latter have been correctly cryptographed. 
The only 
difficult part of the matter is to find among a large number of intercepted cryptograms one which 
involves a blunder of this sort. 
When the cryptanalyst 
has, as a result of considerable e.xperi- 
ence, become adept in the solution of transposition ciphers the work of testing cryptograms to 
ascertain whether or not they involve single columnar transposition is not difficult and goes quite

rapidly. 
For only a few minutes are sufficient to give him the “feeling” 
that the cryptogram is 01 
is not solvable b)- single transposition. 
He might not be able to point out any specific indicztions 
which give him this feeling if asked to do so; nevertheless it must be recognized that his intuition 
is nlonc sttfficient to tell him when there is hope of solution along this line and when furthtar work 
11p0n the> hypoth&s 
of single transposition is useless. 
c. (1) X;est comes the case in which the encipherin g rectangles of a double transposition 
cryptogram happen to be perfect squares (that is, both T-1 and T-2 rectangles arc pcrfcct 
squarcsj . In this case, not only is such a cryptogram detectable at once, since the total number of 
letters is the square of the number of elements in the key, but also the cryptogram can be solved 
in a very simple manner. 
For the cryptogram now represents a case in K-hich a completely-filled 
rectangle has been employed, and moreover there is no need even t,o assume various widths. 
(2) Given the following cryptogram of 49 letters (7X7) as an example, the text is tran- 
scribed as shown in figure 39a and retranscribed as in figure 39b.

d. men 
the enciphering rectangle is not, a perfect square but nevertheless a complete rec- 
tangle, solution of a single cryptogram becomes somewhat, more dif&ult. 
Here the columns are 
all equal in length, since the last row of the rectangle is completely filled. 
Two cases will be 
considered; first, when the width of the rectangle is a multiple of the depth, or number of letters 
in the columns, and second, when the denth is a multinle of the width.

(2) There is obviously a definite regularity in the composition of the sections whereby, if the 
letters cprresponding to the numbers in one section can be assembled properly, all the letters 
corresponding to the numbas in the other sections belonging to the same category (A or B, 
respectively) will be assembled correctly too. For example, in category B the letters correspond- 
ing to the numbers occupying the third, first, and fifth positions in each section,are sequent in 
the plain-text rectangle; in category A the let.ters corresponding to the numbers occupying the 
first and fourth positions in each section are sequent. 
Moreover, all the letters in each section 
come from the same row in t’he T-l rectangle. 
Consequently, if two sections coming from the 
same row can be identified, there will be 10 letters which may be rearranged by experiment to 
form plain text, and the key for this rearrangement will apply to all other pairs of sections. 
For example, the message in this case has a Q and only one U. The Q (P+C 
sequence Xo. 
15) is in the second section, the U (P+C! sequence No. 16) is in the seventh section. 
These two 
sections come from the same row and the letters may be anagrammed: ’

’ The fact that the length of the sections corresponds to 5-letter groups has, of course, no bearing on the 
validity 
of the method. 
In this case it just happens that the rectangle contains 5 letters per column.

The transposition key can now be reconstructed with ease. 
(3) The cryptanalyst, in this case must , cf course, make an assumption as to the width of 
the enciphering rectangle before he can apply the method. 
JYith a number such as 50, the 
dimensions 10X5 or 5X10 suggest themselves. 
The process of finding cipher groups which 
form pairs on the same row is one of “cut and try,” 
If there is a single Q and a single U in the 
message, the initial pair of groups is obvious. 
f. P;hen the depth of the rectangle is a multiple of the width, solution follows along the 
lines of the preceding case. Taking the same message as before, note what happens in enci- 
pherment with a rectangle of 5 columns containing 10 letters each:

The subsequent steps are obvious. 
Here again in solving an unknown example it would be 
necessary to test out various assumptions with respect to the dimensions of the rectangle before 
attempting to apply the method outlined. 
g. Whenever this simple relationship betlveen the width and depth of the rectangle obtains, 
that is, when one dimension is a multiple of the other, solution of a single cryptogram is relatively 
easy. The reason for this is not hard to see. When the enciphering rectangle is a perfect square, 
every column of the T-2 rectangle is composed of letters which all come from the same row of 
the T-l rectangle. 
Hence solution is in this case the same as though a false double transposition 
were in effect, with merely the columns and the rows of a single rectangle shifted about. 
When the 
width of the transposition rectangle is twice the depth, a column of the T-2 rectangle contains 
half the letters appearing on one row of the T-l rectangle; two columns therefore contain all the 
letters belonging in the same row of the T-1 rectangle. 
If the width were three times the depth, 
then three columns of the T-2 rectangle would contain all the letters belonging in the same row 
of the T-l rectangle, and so on. When the width is half the depth, a column of t,he T-2 rectangle 
contains all the letters appearing in two rows of the T-l rectangle; when the width is one-third 
the depth, a column of the T-2 rectangle contains all the letters appearing in three rows of the 
T-1 rectangle, and so on. But rrhen this multiple relationship no longer obtains, solution becomes 
more diEcult because each column of the T-2 rectangle is composed of letters coming from sev- 
eral columns of the T-l rectangle, in an irregular distribution. 
Solution is, of course, most difli- 
cult when incompletely filled rectangles are used. However, although solvable, even in the case 
of a single message, the solution will not be dealt with in this text.

29. Special designs or geometric figures-u. 
It is impossible here to elucidate and demon- 
strate by esample all the methods which may be used for the solution of cryptograms produced 
by the many various types of transposition designs or geometric figures other than the simple 
rectangular ones thus far treated. 
,Reference may be made to such matrices as triangles, trape- 
zoids, and polygons of various symmetrical shapes. Alost of these matrices, however, are imprac- 
tical for military correspondence in any case, so that no attention need be given them in this test. 
6. If such designs were used, although it might be difficult to solve a single or even a few 
messages in the same key, the general solution described in paragraph 26 is applicable whenever 
two or more messages of identical lengths but in the same key are available for study. 
Since 
most of these designs are of a fixed or inflexible character with regard to the number of letters 
that can be accommodated with one application of the design to the plain text to be enciphered, 
the production of several cryptograms of identical length in the same key is by no means an un- 
usual circumstance. 
The general solution can usually be depended upon to yield the answer to 
cryptograms of this category but it then becomes advisable to try to ascertain the exact nature of 
the specific design or geometric figure employed, t,hat is, to reconstruct the transposition matrix. 
For this purpose a general method will be indicated by means of a specific example, leaving other 
cases to the ingenuity of the student after he has learned t,he general method. 
30. Reconstruction of transposition 
matrix.--a. 
Assume that t,he enemy is employing an 
unknown geometric figure of rather small dimensions so that it appears from a study of the traffic 
that it accommodates a maximum of 85 letters. 
A long cryptogram has been intercepted a.nd it is 
broken up into sections of 85 letters, which sections are t,hen superimposed, as shown belox. 
It will be noted that there are 3 complete sections of 85 letters each, plus a Canal section of but 
49 letters. 
The final section will be dealt with later.

consecutive numbers appear on the same level, as shown in figure 40--i:

d. From this skeleton of what may be termed the matrix-reconstruction

to derive direct clues for the continuance and completion of the C+P sequence and the text of 
the message. For example, it would appear that the very next column to the left should be 78, 
the one to the left of 78 should be 68, the one to the left of 68 should be 9. Trial gives the

This, of course. speeds up the work involved in the anagramming process and when completed the 
test, the C-+P sequence, the P-K 
sequence, and the matrix reconstruction diagram are as 
shown in figure 40-B. 
In the cells of the diagram there have been inserted in the upper left 
hand corner small numbers in italics, 
the latter numbers being merely the term numbers 
applying to the C+P sequence. 
e. The matrix-reconstruction 
diagram in figure 46-B shows a total of i lrrcls of numbers. 
Let t,he term numbers corresponding to the conswutire 
C-+P sequence numbers on the 
same level in the diagra.m be set down. Thus! for the C-P sequence numbers 4 to 16, inclusivcx, 
on the first level the term numbers are:

79 83 85 
On the second level there are two sets of consecutive C--+P sequence numbers, those from 48 
to 58, inclusive forming one set, those from 64 t.o 74, inclusive forming the other set. Two series 
of term numbers are therefore derived:

f. There are in all 13 sets or series of consecutive C+P sequence numbers, indicating 
that the transposition matrix has 13 columns, the number of letters in each column corresponding 
with the number of different terms in each series. Thus, there is a column of 13 letters, 2 
columns of 11 letters, 2 columns of 9 letters, and so on. This leads directly to the idea of a 
very symmetrical matrix of the form shown in figure 42-A.

g. The rec.overy of the transposition key (for the columns of figure 42-A) is now a simple 
matter. 
Referring t.o the P+C! sequence shown in figure 40-B, and noting the various columns 
in figure 42-A in which successive numbers of the P-C 
sequence fall, the key number 1 of the 
transposit,ion key obviously applies to the column containing P+C sequence numbers 26-38-50; 
the key number 2 obviously applies to the colunm containing P+C sequence numbers 1-3-7-13- 
21--31-43-5%65-73-79-83-85;snd 
so on. The complete transposition key and the matrix are 
shown in figure 42-B.

h. The solut’ion of the incomplete section of the message (the last 79 letters) now becomes a 
simple matt.er, since the matrix and the transposition key are both know-n. The matter can be 
handled as if simple transposition were involved, by outlining the matrix t’o contain exactly 79 
letters and inscribing the cipher text in the columns in key-number order. 
i. The foregoing principles and procedure will be found quite valuable not only in facili- 
tating the anagramming of the text in its initial stages (as in subparagraph d) but also in recon- 
structing various types of matrices based upon symmetrical designs used with single transpo- 
sition (subparagraphs e-g). 
It should be not’ed that the number of levels in the reconstruction 
diagram corresponds with the number of different-length 
columns in the matrix; the number of 
different c&go&s of term numbers (as in figure 41) corresponds with the number of columns 
in the matrix.

31. Revolving grilles.--+ 
In this type of grille l apertures are distributed 
among the cells 
of a square sheet of cross-se&ion paper in such a manner that when the grille is placed upon a 
grid (a sheet of cross-section paper of the same size as the grille) certain cells of the grid are dis- 
closed ; then when the grille is turned three times successively through angles of 90’ from an 
initial position upon the grid, all the remaining undisclosed grid cells (or all but t,he central 
grid cell) are disclosed in turn. 
Correspondents must, of course, possess identical grilles and they 
must have an understanding 
as to its initial 
position and direction of rotation, clockwise or 
counterclockwise. 
There are two procedures possible in usiug such a grille. 
(1) The letters of 
the plain text may be inscribed successively in the grid cells through the apertures of the grille; 
when the grid has been completely filled the grille is removed and the letters transcribed from 
the grid according to a prearranged route. 
(2) All the letters of the plain text may first be 
inscribed in the grid cells according to a prearranged route and then the grille applied to the 
completely-filled grid to give the sequence of letters forming the cryptogram. 
The two methods 
of using the grille are reciprocal; if the first-described method is used to encipher a message, the 
second is used to decipher the cryptogram, and vice versa. The first of the two above-described 
methods, the one in which the plain text is inscribed through the apertures, will here be referred 
to as the alpha method; the second method uill be referred to as the beta method. 
b. The number of letters in a cryptogram enciphered by such a device is either a perfect, 
square, when the grille has an even number of cells per side, or is 1 less than a perfect square, 
when the grille has an odd number of cells per side, in which case t,he cent’ral cell of the grid is 
not disclosed and hence remains unfYled.2 
c. The manner of construction and the method of use of a grille entails certain consequences 
which can be employed to solve the cryptograms and to reconstruct the grille itself. The student 
who wishes to get a thorough grasp of the underlying principles to be explained will do well to 
prepare a grille 3 and study the properties which characterize cryptograms produced by its use. 
Three principles will be brought to bear in the solution of grille ciphers of this type and they 
will be demonstrated by reference to the grille and message shown in figure 43. 
r See Special Text No. 166, Adoanced Military 
Cryptography, 
sec. V. 
a Of course, the cryptogram 
may consist of the letters produced by several applications 
of the same grille. 
For example, if a message of 170 letters is to be enciphered by a grille accommodating 
only 36 letters at a time, 
the message is divided up into 5 sections of 36 letters each (10 nulls being added to make the total a multiple 
of 
36). 
The total number of letters (180) here shows no properties 
of the type noted. 
Again, if the grille has a 
capacity greater than the number of letters to be enciphered, certain of the grid cells may be cancelled, so that 
the number of letters in the final cryptogram 
will not be a perfect square or 1 less than a perfect square.

for the construction 
of revolving 
grilles will be found in Special Text No. 166, Ad-

d. The first principle may be termed that of symmetry. 
When a revolving grille is in position 
1 a certain number of cells of the underlying 
grid are disclosed (uncovered). 
For each such 
disclosed cell of the grid there is a symmetrically-corresponding 
cell on the same grid which is 
disclosed when the grille is turned to positions 2, 3, and 4, because the apertures of the grille 
remain fixed-only 
their positions change as the grille .is turned in the process of encipherment. 
Now two success&e apertures in position 1 will, of course, be occupied by a plain-text digraph (alpha 
method of encipherment). 
When the grille reaches position 3, after a turn of 180°, the two

apertures concerned n-ill disclose two cells which will also be occupied by a plain-text digraph, 
but the letters composing the digrcrph u-ill be in reverse order in the plain ttst. 
This property is true 
also of two succes.sire apertures in position 2 when they turn up in position 4. Let the student 
verify this by means of the grille which he has constructed. 
Thus, referring to figure 43, at A 
is shown the grille in position I. 
In the first row are show-n 2 apertures, at coordinates 1-4 and 
1-8. At B are shown the results of the first application of the grille to the grid. 
Sotc the letters 
Y 0 (first 2 letters of message) in cells 4 and 8. Sow note that the symmrtrically-corresponding 
cells disclosed when the grille is in position 3 are ceils 57 and 61 and these correspond to cells 4 
and 8 in the reverse order. 
The letter T in cell 57 therefore symmetrically corresponds with 
letter 0 in cell 8; the letter Yin cell 61 corresponds with letter Y in cell 4. The same is true of all 
other letters in positions 1 and 3. -4s a consequence of this property of grilles, a single cryptogram 
can be handled as though it were really t,wo cryptograms of identical length having certain 
characteristics by means of which an assumption made in one text may be verified by what it 
yields in the other text. 
That is, when the cryptogram is transcribed as a series of letters in one 
line and the same text is written in another line under these letters but in reversed order, then the 
superimposed letters will bear the symmetrical relationship pointed out in this paragraph. 
If 
two letters in the upper line of such a transcription 
are taken to form a digmph, the two corre- 
sponding Ithtters in the lower line must form a digraph but in reversed order in the plairl.test. 
For example, if the cryptogram of figure 43 is writt’en out as explained above, the result is as 
shown at figure 44. T\‘ow the presence of the Q in position 39 suggests that it bc combined with

a U. If the U in position 43 is taken, then the symmetrical digraph corresponding to Q U would 
be L I; if the U in position 56 is taken, the symmetrically-corresponding 
digraph would be M I. 
Furthermore, two apertures which are in the same column and which do not hate an intervening 
aperture between them, will yield a good digraph in all 4 positions of the grille. 
For example, not,e 
apertures 2-6 and 3-6 at B in figure 43. Vihen the grille is turned to positions 2,3, and 4 they will 
disclose two sequent letters in eac.h case. An analysis of the symmetries produced by an 8X8 
grille yields the following table, which shows what cells are disclosed in the other 3 positions when 
an aperture is cut in any one cell in 1 of the 4 positions of the grille. 
For example, an aperture 
cut in cell 11 (position 1) will disclose grid-cell 23 when the grille takes position 2, grid-cell 54 when 
the grille takes position 3, and grid-cell 42 when t’he grille takes position 4.

The second principle may be termed that of exclusion. 
On account of the system upon which 
the construction of a revolving grille is based, a knowledge of the location of an aperture in one 
of the bands brings with it a knowledge 
of 3 other locations in which there can be no apertures. 
For example, referring to A in figure 43, the presence of the aperture at coordinates 14 precludes 
the presence of apertures at coordinates 4-8, 8-5, and 5-1. 
By virtue of this principle of exclu- 
sion, the number of possibilities for choice of letters in solving a cryptogram prepared by means 
of a revolving grille becomes much reduced and the problem is correspondingly simplified, as 
will bc seen presently. 
f. The third principle may be termed that of sequence. 
Rhen trying to build up text, the 
letters which follow a given sequence of plain-text letters n-ill usually be found to the right and 
below, that is, if the normal method of writing u-as used (left to right and from the top down- 
ward). 
For example, referring to figure 44, if the trigraph Q U E is to be built up, neither the U 
in position 5 nor the U in position 10 is wry likely to be the one that follows the Q; the U in position 
43 is the most likely candidate because it is the first one beyond the Q. Suppose the U in position 
43 is selected. Then the E for Q U E cannot be the one in position 40, or in any position in front 
of 40, since the E must, be beyond the U in the diagram. 
g. In solving a grille, it will be found advisable to prepare a piece of cross-section paper of 
proper size for the grille and to cut each aperture as soon as its location in the grille becomes 
quite definite. 
In this way not only will the problem be simplified but also when completed the 
proper grille is at hand. 
32. Solution of example.--a. 
Suppose the cryptogram shown in figure 43 is to be solved. 
It 
has 64 letters, suggesting a grille 8X8. 
The cryptogram is first transcribed into a square 8x8, 
yielding n-hat has already been obtained at F in figure 43. The Q in position 39 suggests that it 
is part of a word inscribed when the grille was in posit,ion 3, since there will be 16 plain-text letters 
inscribed at each position of the grille. 
Then a piece of cross-section paper is prepared for 
making the grille as shown in figure 45-A, and an aperture is cut in the proper position to dis- 
close, in position 3, cell 39. It will be found that this is the aperture located at coordinates 4-2 
of the grille shown in figure 45-A.

The result is shown in

Conforming to the principle of sequence, the U to be combined with the Q is 
sought to the right of the Q in figure 43-F. 
There are three candidates, in positions 43, 46, and

All of the symmetrical correspondents of these 3 Q U’s are good digraphs and it is impossible to 
eliminate any of the three possibilities. 
The U in position 43 would place an aperture at coordi- 
nates 6-3 in figure 45-B; the U in position 46 would place an aperture at coordinates 6-6; and the 
U in position 56 would place an aperture at coordinates i-8. 
All of thrsc> are possible, none being 
excluded by principle 2. Suppose the Q U is followed by E. There are only two possibilities: 
an E in cell 51 and E in cell 63. The following possibilities are presented:

None of the symmetrical correspondents of the Q U E’s are impossible sequences in plain text, 
although 0 A I is not as probable as the others. 
(The 0 could be the end of a word, the AI 
the beginning of the word AID, AIM, AIR, etc.) 
Each of these possibilities would be tested by 
principle 2 to see if any conflicts would arise as to the positions of apertures. 
-4s in all cases of 
transposition ciphers, the most difficult part of the solut.ion is that of forcing an entering wedge 
into the structure and getting a good start; when this has been done the rest is easy. Sote what 
the results are when the proper apertures are assumed for QUEST in this case, as shown in figure 
45-C. 
In position 1 this yields OUR LI . . .; in position 2 it yields two digraphs AN and UT; 
in position 4 it yields two digraphs H A and R 0. 
The student should note that the indicated 
digraphs A N and R 0 in positions 2 and 4, respectively, are certain despite the fact that there is 
a space between the two apertures disclosing these letters, for the principle of exclusion has per- 
mitted the crossing off of this cell as a possib<ity for an aperture.

b. Enough has been shown of the procedure to make further demonstration unnecessary. 
Given the sequence OUR LI one begins t,o build on that, assuming a word such as LINE. 
This 
yields possibilities for the placement of additional apertures in the grille; these are tested in 
positions 2, 3,4, and so on. 
When any 16 consecutive letters of plain text have been established 
all apertures have been ascertained and the problem has been completed. 
Subsequent crypto- 
grams prepared by the same grille can be read at once.

c. If attempts at solution on the basis of the alpha method of using a grille have failed, the 
obvious modifications in procedure on the basis of the beta method can readily be made. 
33. Concluding remarks on the solution of revolving grilles-a. 
There is nothing about the 
mechanics of revolving grilles which prevents their employment in enciphering complete words 
instead of individual 
letters. 
However, the assembling of whole words in intelligible 
sequences 
and thus the reconstruction of the original plain text is a much easier matter than assembling 
single letters to form the words of the original plain text 
b. In case the same grille has been employed several times with separate grids to encipher a 
message that is considerably longer than a single grid will accommodate (see footnote 2, par. 31b), 
the several sections each reprcscnting the set of letters enciphered on one grid may be super- 
imposed and the general solution described in paragraph 26 may then be applied. 
c. In case the capacity of a grille is in excess of the number required by the length of the 
text to be enciphered, either of two procedures may be agreed upon. The grid cells which would 
otherwise be unoccupied may be filled by nulls, or the grid may be left incomplete. 
As regards 
the former procedure, little more need be said than that the presence of a few nulls will only 
delay solution a bit until the fact that nulls are being employed for this purpose becomes estab- 
lished. 
But the second type of procedure calls for more comment. 
If the grid is to be left’ 
incomplete it is necessary, before applying the grille, to count the number of plain-text letters 
and to cancel from the grid a number of cells equal to the number of cells in excess of the 
total number required. 
The posit,ion of the cells to be cancelled must be agreed upon: commonly, 
they are those at the end of the grid. 
Such cells are marked so that when they become exposed 
during the rotations of the grille they will not be used. Thus, for example, the grille shown in 
figure 43-A is intended for a grid of 64 letters; if the message to be enciphered contains only 53 
letters, 12 cells of the grid must be canceled, and by agreement they may be cells 53 to 64, inclusive, 
The solution of a single cryptogram of this sort, or even of several of them of different lengths, 
may become a rather difficult matter. 
First of all, clues as to the dimensions of the grille are no 
longer afforded by the total number of letters in the cryptogram, so that this information can 
be obtained only by more or less laborious experimentation. 
Grilles of various dimensions must 
be assumed, one after the other, until the c.orrect dimensions have been found. 
In the second 
place, the symmetrical relationships pointed out in paragraph 31 no longer obtain, so that a 
single cryptogram cannot be handled as though it were constituted of tFo messages of identical 
length. 
Of course, in trying out any assumed dimensions, t,he 64 letters of t’he cryptogram 
may 
be written out in t1v-o superimposed lines, blanks being left. for those positions which are unfilled. 
The procedure then follows the normal lines. About the most hopeful clues would be obtained 
from a knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the t.ransmission and affording a basis for 
the assumption of probable words. 
However, were such a system employed for regular com- 
munication there would undoubtedly be cases of cryptograms of identical lengths, so that the 
type of solution given in paragraph 26 will be applicable. 
Once a solution of this sort has been 
obtained, the dimensions of the grille may be ascertained. 
Subsequent, crypt,ograms 
may 
then 
be attacked on the basis of the normal procedure, with such modifications as are indicated by 
the absence of the number of letters needed to make a completely-filled grid. 
34. Indefinite 
or continuous 
grilles-a. 
In his Manual 
of Cryptography, 
Sacco illustrates 
a type of grille which he has devised and which has elements of practical importance. 
An ex- 
ample of such a grille is shown in figure 46. This grille contains 20 columns of cells, and each 
colunm contains 5 apertures distributed 
at random in the column. 
There are therefore 100 
apertures in all, and this is the maximum number of letters which may be enciphered in one posi- 
tion of the grille. 
The plain text is inscribed vertically, from left to right, using only as many 
colunms as may 
be necessary to inscribe the complete message. A 25-letter message would require

but 6 columns. 
To form the cryptogram the letters are transcribed horirontally 
from the rows, 
taking the letters from left to right as they appear in the operturcs. 
If the total number of 
letters is not a multiple of 5, sufficient nulls are added to make it so. In decryptographing, the 
total number of letters is divided by 5, this giving the number of columns employed. 
The cipher 
text is inscribed from left to right and top downwards in the apertures in the rows of the indicated 
number of columns and the plain text then reappears in the apertures in the columns, reading 
downvvard and from left to right. 
(It is, of course, not essent.ial that nulls be added in encipher- 
ment to make the length of the cryptogram an exact multiple of 5, for the matter can readily 
be handled even if this is not done. 
In decipheimcnt the total number of letters divided by 5 
FIGCRE 
46. 
will give the number of complete columns; the remainder left over from the division will give 
the number of cells occupied by letters in the last column on the right.) 
b. Such a grille can assume 4 positions, two obverse and two reverse. Arrangements must 
be made in advance as to the sequence in which the various posit’ions will be employed. 
c. The solution of a single cryptogram enciphered by one and only one position of such a 
grille presents a practically 
hopeless problem, for the apertures being distributed at random 
throughout the grille there is nothing which may be seized upon as a guide to the reconstruction 
of either the grille or the plain text. 
It is conceivable, of course, that a person with an infinite 
amount of patience could produce an intelligible 
text and a grille conformable to that text, the 
grille having a definite number of columns and a fixed number of apertures distributed at random 
throughout the columns. But there would be no way of proving that the plain text so obtained 
is the actual plain text that was enciphered; for it would be possible to produce several “solutions” 
of the same character, any one of which might bc correct.* 
d. However, suppose a grille of this sort were employed to encipher a long message, requiring 
two or more applications of the grille. 
For example, in the case of the grille shown in figure 46, 
having a capacity of 100 letters per application, suppose n message of 400 letters were to be 
enciphered, requiring two obverse and two reverse applicat,ions of the grille. 
It is obvious that 
symmetrical relationships of the nature of those pointed out in paragraph 31 can be established. 
Of course, if the grille is used several times in the same position to its full capacity, producing 
cryptograms of multiples of 100 letters, then the sections of 100 letters may be superimposed and 
the general solution elucidated in paragraph 26 applied.

e. If the grille shown in figure 46 were used to encipher two messages, one of 80 letters, the 
other of 85, it would be possible to solve these messages. For bp eliminating 5 letters from the 
longer message, the two cryptograms can be superimposed and handled as in paragraph 26. The 
difficulty would be in finding the 5 extra letters. 
Of course, if it should happen that one of the 
messages required 3 or 4 nulls and letters such as J, X, or Z were employed for this purpose, the 
nulls would be likely characters for elimination. 
But regardless of this, even if letters of medium 
or high frequency were used as nulls, patient experimentation would ultimately lead to solution. 
The latter, it must be conceded, would be diEcult but not impossible.

35. Reasons for combining transposition with substitution.--a. 
Transposition methods are, 
from the cryptographic point of view, rather highly regarded because they are, as “hand methods” 
go, rather rapid in operation and usually quite simple. However, from their very nature they 
entail the disadvantage that a single-letter omission or addition may render their decryptograph- 
ing difficult if not impossible for the average cryptographic clerk. 
But from the standpoint of 
modern cryptography 
the principal disadvantage of transposition methods is that t,hey can be 
mechanized only with great difficulty-certainly 
with greater difficulty than is the case of sub- 
stitution methods. Only one or two attempts have been made to produce machinery for effecting 
transposition, and these have not been successful. 
b. Pure transposition, that is, transposition by itself, without an accompanying substitution 
or other means of disguise for the letters of the plain text, hardly affords sufficient guarantees for 
cryptographic 
securit_v in the case of a voluminous correspondence which must be kept really 
secret for any length of time. 
For no matter how complex the method, or how many trans- 
positions may be applied to the letters of a single message, sight must never be lost of the fact 
that F-hen there are manymessages in the same key there arc bound to be two or more of identical 
length; and when this is the case the type of solution described in paragraph 26 may be applied 
to these cryptograms, the transposition keys recovered, and then all other messages in the same 
key translated. 
c. A message may undergo monoalphabetic substitution and the resulting test passed through 
a simple transposition. 
When this is the case a uniliteral frequency distribution 
will, of course, 
exhibit all the characteristics of monoalphabcticity, 
yet the cryptogram will resist all attempts 
at solution according to,straight,forward simple substitution principles. 
It is usually not difficult 
to detect that a transposition is involved because there will not only be long strings of low- 
frequency letters or high-frequency letters but .what is more important, 
there will be very few or 
no repetitions 
of digraphs, 
ir;graphs, 
and t&agTaphS, 
since these will 
be broken up by the trans- 
position. 
F\Then a uniliteral distribution 
presents all t’he external evidences of monoalphabeticity 
and yet there are no repetitions, it is almost 
a positive indication of the presence of transposition 
superimposed upon the substitution, or vice versa. (The former is usually the case.) 
d. When confronted with such a situation the cryptanalyst 
usually proceeds by stages, 
first eliminating 
the transposition and then solving the substitution. 
It is of course obvious 
that the general solution for transposition ciphers (cryptograms of identical length in the same 
key) u-ill not be applicable here, for the reason that such a solution is based upon anagramming, 
which in turn is guided by the disclosure of good digraphs, trigraphs, and polygraphs. 
Since the 
letters of a combined substitution-transposition 
cipher are no longer the same as the original 
plain-text 
let.ters, simple anagramming of columns formed by superimposing identical-length

95 
cryptograms 
can yield no results, because there is nothing of the nature of plain text to guide the 
cryptanalyst 
in his juxtaposition 
of colunms.1 
e. Of course, if it’ should happen that the substitution 
process involves knom 
alphabets, 
the cryptanalyst 
can remove the effects of the substitutive 
process before proceeding to elim- 
inate the transposition, even if in the encipherment the substitution came first,. For example, if 
a standard cipher alphabet were employed for the substitution 
the uniliteral 
frequency distri- 
bution would give indications thereof and the cipher letters could immediately be converted 
to the normal plain-text equivalents. 
The latter may then be studied as though merely trans- 
position had been applied. 
But if unknown mixed cipher alphabets m-ere employed, this initial 
step can not be accomplished and a solution must usually wait upon the removal of the trans- 
position before the substitution can be attacked. 
The latter may be very difficult or impossible 
where a good transposition method is used; where simple columnar transposition is used the 
removal of the transposition can be effected if the message is long enough. 
j. Of course if nothing is known about the system of transposition that has been employed, 
there is hardly anything to do but experiment with various types of transposition in an attempt 
to bring about such an arrangement of the text as will show repetitions. 
If this can be done, 
then the problem can be solved. For example, suppose that a message has been enciphered by a 
single mixed cipher alphabet and the substitution text has then been inscribed within a rectangle 
of certain dimensions according to one of the usual routes mentioned in paragraph 5 of this text. 
Repetitions in the plain text will of course be preserved in the substit.ution text, but will be 
destroyed after the transposition has been applied. 
The cryptanalyst, however, in his attempts 
to eliminate the transposition, may experiment n-ith route transpositions of the various types, 
employing rectangles of various dimensions as suggested by the total number of letters in the 
cryptogram. 
If he perseveres, he will find one route which he will know is correct as soon as he 
tries it because it will disclose the repetitions in the plain text, although the latter are still covered 
by a substitution. 
g. Practically all the methods of transposit,ion which may be applied to plain text may also 
be applied to a text resulting from an initial transformation by substitution. 
As already men- 
tioned, route transposition may be used; reversed and rail-fence vziting, columnar transposition 
rrith or without, keying and with complete or incomplete rectangles are also possible. From a 
practical standpoint, keyed-columnar transposition applied to a monoalphabetic substitution 
is 
not only a popular but also a fairly secure combination because in this case the elimination of the 
transposition is a rather difficult matter. 
If the rectangle is completely filled the problem is not 
insurmountable in the case of a long message transposed by means of transposition with a rec- 
tangle of fairly small dimensions. For by assuming rectangles of various dimensions suggested 
by the total number of letters, cutting the columns apart, and then combining columns on the 
basis of the number of repetitions produced within juxtaposed columns and between different 
sets of juxtaposed columns, it is possible to reconstruct the rectangle and thus remove the trans- 
position phase. This, however, is admittedly a slow and difficult process even under the most 
favorable conditions; and if the rectangle is incompletely filled the process is very difficult. 
For 
in the latter case the lack of absolutely clear-cut knowledge as to the lengths of the columns, the 
juxtaposition 
of columnar material becomes replete with uncertainties and engenders feelings 
of confusion, hopelessness, and inadequacy in the mind of the cryptanalyst. 
However, he need 
1 It should, however, not be inferred that snagramming 
processes are entirely excluded in the crrptanalvis 
of all combined substitution-transposition 
systems. 
In certain cases the anagramming 
process may be guided 
by considerations 
of frequency of letters or fragments of letters. 
A case of this kind will be encountered in the 
solution of the ADFGVX cipher, par. 40.

not be It-holly in despair if he is confronted with a problem of this nature in war time, when 
many cryptograms become available for study. 
For there arc special methods of solution suitable 
to the occasion, created by specinl circumstances attendant upon the interception of a voluminous 
traffic. 
In subsequent paragraphs the student ~-ill come to understand n-hat is here meant by 
the special circumstances and n-ill learn of these special solutions. 
36. Other types of combined substitution-transposition 
systems-u. 
There is no technical 
obstacle to the application of a transposition to the test resulting from any t\-pe of substitution, 
even if the latter is polyalphabetic or polygraphic in nature. The obstacles, or rather objc!ctions. 
to such combinations are practical in their cl~racter-they 
are too complex for ordinary use and 
the prevalence of errors makes them too difficult to handle, as a general rule. 
However, they 
have been and are sometimes used even as field ciphers. For instance, on the southeastern front, 
during the World Kar, the Central Powers made use of a somewhat irregular polyalphabetic sub- 
stitution 
involving 
four standard alphabets and a keyed columnar transposition with incom- 
pletely-filled rectangles of a relatively large number of columns. Severthrless. messages in this 
system were solved by taking advantage of the possibility of devising special solutions. 
b. A few remarks may be made in regard to the order in which the two processes, sub- 
stitution 
and transposition, 
are employed in a combined system. 
It is clear that n-hen the 
substitution 
is monoalphabetic it is immaterial, so far as cryptographic security is concerned, 
whether substitution 
is followed by transposition or vice versa, because the equivalent of each 
plain-test letter remains fixed regardless of the order in which the plain-text, letters appear in 
the plain text. 
However, if the substitution 
is polyalphabetic in character it is better that the 
transposition process precede the substitution 
process, and that the number of alphabets em- 
ployed be different from the number of elements in the transposition key, if columnar trans- 
position is the case. The best situation, from a cryptographic 
security standpoint, is when 
the two key lengths (substitution 
and transposition) have no common factor. 
If the t1v-o kr?-s 
are of the same length, the letters in each column are enciphered by the same cipher alphabet 
and thus the cryptogram would contain a certain number of sections of approximately 
equal 
length, composed of letters falling in the same cipher alphabet. 
c. Digraphic substitution, 
such as that produced by the Playfair Cipher, may be combined 
with transposition to yield cryptograms of fair security. 
But here again the elimination of the 
transposition phase by taking advantage of special circumstances or by rearranging the next so 
as to uncover the repetitions which are inevitable in the Playfair Cipher, will result in solution. 
d. A particularly fruitful source of combined substitution-transposition 
is to be found in those 
methods generally designated as fractionating 
systems, in which in the substitution 
phase each 
plain-text letter is replaced by an equivalent composed of two or more components or “fractions” 
and then these components are subjected to transposition in a second phase. This latter may be 
followed by a third phase, recombination 
of distributed 
components, and a fourth phase, the 
replacement of the recombined components by letters. 
Thus, such a system comprises a first 
substitution, 
a transposition, a recombination, 
and a second substitution.2 
In the subsequent 
paragraphs certain systems of this sort will be dealt with in detail. 
They are interesting examples 
of practical systems of cryptography which have been used in the field of military operations in 
the past and may again be used in the future. 
The first one to be discussed is particularly 
inter- 
esting for this reason alone; but it is also of interest because it will serve as a model for the student 
to follow in his study of methods for the solution of combined substitution-transposition 
ciphers 
in general.

37. Introductory 
remarks.--a. 
One of the most interestin g and practical of the many 
methods in rrhich substitution 
and transposition are combined within a single system is that 
known in the literature as the ADFGVX cipher.’ 
In this system a 36-character bipartite substitu- 
tion checkerboard is employed, in the cells of which the 26 letters of the alphabet and the 10 
digits 
are clistribnted 
in mixed order, often according t,o some key word. 
The row and column 
indicators (coordinates) are the letters ADFGVX, and, taken in-pairs, t,he latter are used as substi- 
tutes for the letters of the plain test. 
These substitutive 
pairs are then inscribed within a rec- 
tangle and a columnar transposition takes place, according to a numerical key. 
The cipher test 
consists then merely of the 6 letters A, D, F, G, V, and X. 
b. The ADFGVX cipher system was inaugurated on the Western Front by the German Army 
on March 1, 1918, for communication between higher headquarters, principally 
between head- 
quarters of divisions and corps. 
m’hen first instituted on hiarch 1, 1918, the checkerboard con- 
sisted of 25 cells, for a 25-letter German alphabet (J was omitted), and the 5 letters A, D, F, G, and 
X used as coordinates. 
On June 1 the letter V was added, the checkerboard having been enlarged 
to 36 cells, to take care of a 26-letter alphabet plus the 10 digits. 
Transposition keys ranged from 
I 5 to 22 numbers, inclusive, and both the checkerboard and the transposition key were changed 
daily. 
The number of messages in t’his system varied from 25 a day upon the inception of the 
system 
to as many as 150 per day, during the last days of May 1918. The first solution was made 
on April 6 by the French. 
The cipher continued in use rather extensively until late ;1 June but 
from that time until 
the Arm&ice 
the volume of messages diminished very considerably. 
Although only 10 keys, covering a period of as many days were ever solved, the proportion of 
solved messages in the whole intercepted traffic was about 50 percent. 
This was true because of 
the fact that the keys solved were those for days on which the greatest number of messages was 
intercepted. 
The same system 
was employed on the southeastern front from July 1918 to the 
end of the war. 
Keys were in effect at first for a period of 2 days and beginning on September 1, 
for a period of 3 days. 
In all 17 keys, covering a total of 44 days, were solved. 
c. At the t,ime that the Allied cryptanalytic 
offices were working with cryptograms in this 
system only three methods were known for their solution and all three of them a.re classifiable 
under the heading of special solutions, 
because certain conditions had to obtain before they 
could be applied. 
No general solution had been developed until after hostilities had ceased.a 
1 Special Test So. 166, A&xznred Milifary 
Crypfography, 
sec. XI. 
1 The general solution to be described in paragraphs 
4143 was not established until after the Armistice. 
Had it been elaborated earlier there would no doubt have been many more solutions than were actually effected 
by the methods then available.

Because they are interesting and useful some attention n-ill be devoted to both the general and the 
special solutions. 
Since the special solutions are easy to understand and serve as a good introduc- 
tion to the general solution: they will be taken up first. 
38. Special solution by means of identical endings.-a. 
In paragraph 24 it ~-3s demonstrated 
how the solution of keyed-columnar transposition ciphers can be facilitated and simplified by t,he 
comparison of t\vo cryptograms which are in the same key and the plain-text endings of which 
are identical. 
It was noted in that case that a study of the irregularly distributed cipher-text 
identities between the tsvo crypt.ograms permits of not only cutting up the text into sections 
that correspond with the long and the short columns of the transposition rectangle but also of 
establishing the transposition key in a direct manner almost entirely mathematical in nature. 
‘&hen this has been accomplished the plain texts of these two messages are at once disclosed, and 
all other messages in the same key may be read by means of the key so reconstructed. 
b. The same method of solution is applicable t.o the similar situation, 
if it can be found, in 
the case of the ADFGVX system, except that one more step intervenes between the reconstruction 
of the transposition rectangle and the appearance of the plain text in the rectangle: A mono- 
alphabetic substitution 
must be solved, since the text in the rows of the rectangle does not 
consist of plain-text letters but of pairs of components representing these letters as enciphered by 
means of a bipartite substitution 
alphabet. 
Moreover, this latter st,ep is comparatively simple 
- 
when there is a sufficient amount of text.in the two rectangles; if not, additional material for use 
in solving the monoalphabet can be obtained from other cryptograms in the same key, if they are 
available, since the t,ransposition key, having already been reconstructed from the two crypto- 
grams with identical endings, will permit of inscribing all other cryptograms in the same key 
within their proper rectangles. 
c. A demonstration of the application of the principles involved in such a solution will be 
useful. 
The following cryptograms have been intercepted on the same date, the 20th:

d. The delimitation and marking of identities between these two cryptograms is a procedure 
similar to that explained in pa.ragraph &lb, except that a little more study may be necessary in 
this case because occasionally there may be considerable uncertainty 
as t,o esact.ly where an 
identity begins or ends. The reason for this is not difficult to understand. 
Whereas in para- 
graph 24b the process involves “unfractionated” 
letters and t,here are about 18 or 20 different 
letters to deal with, so that an “accidental identity ” is a rather rare occurrence, in the present, 
problem the process involves fractions of letters (the components of the bipartite cipher equiva- 
lents), and there are only 6 different cha.racters to deal with, so that such “accidental identities” 
are quite frequent. 
Now the cryptanalyst is not able at. first to distinguish between these acci- 
dental identities and actual identities and this is what makes the process somewhat difficult. 
What is meant will become perfectly clear presently. 
e. Taking the two illustrative 
cryptograms, the first st,ep is to ascertain what identities 
can be found between them, and then mark off these identities. 
For example, it is obvious that 
if the messages end alike the last several letters in No. 1 should be found somewhere in ?r’o. 2, 
and likewise the last several letters in No. 2 should be found somewhere in No. 1. The number 
of let,ters in identical sequences will depend upon the length of the identical text and the width 
of the transposition rectangle. 
Searching through No. 2 for a sequence such as A G D X, or 
G D X, or at least D X, the tetragraph A G D X is found as letters 151-54. 
The last column of Ko. 2 
ends with F G A V; searching through No. 1 for a sequence F G A V, or G A V, or at least, A V, the 
t,etragraph F G A V is found as lett,ers 87-90. 
These identities are underlined or marked off in 
some fa.shion, and search is made for ot,her identities. 
It would be a great help if the width of 
the transposition rectangle were known, for then it would be possible to cut up the text into 
lengths approximately corresponding to column lengths, and this would then restrict the search 
for identical sequences to those sections which correspond to the bottoms of the columns. 
Sup- 
pose the key to contain 20 numbers. 
Then the rectangle for No. 1, containing 152 letters, 
would consist of 12 long columns of 8 letters and 8 short ones of 7 letters; that for 30.2, con- 
taining 194 letters, would consist of 14 long columns of 10 letters and 6 short ones of 9 letters. 
If that were correct t.hen in No. 1 the end of the first column would be either X V D D, or X V D. 
Searching through ,“o. 2 for either of these a sequence X V D D is found as letters 84-7. 
Column 
1 is probably a long column in No. 1: The word probably is used because the identity may 
extend only over the letters X V D, and the next D may be an accidental similamty, 
since the chances 
that D will appear by pure accident are 1 in 6, which is not at all improbable. 
It must also be 
pointed out that a certain number of telegraphic errors may be expected, and since’there are

100 
on]- 6 different letters the chances that an F, for example, will be received or recorded as a D 
are fairly good. 
Column 1 of So. 2 ends either with V F A D or V F A. Searching through So. 1. 
a sequence V F A D is found as letters 14-l;; a sequence V F A is found as letters 34-6 ; a sequence 
V F F D is found as letters ‘79-82; a sequence V F A D is also found as letters 126-130; a sequence 
V F A is found as letters 130-2. 
Here are several possibilities; which is the one to choose? Two 
of these possibilities coincide exactly with the full sequence being sought, V F A D. Can one of 
them be eliminated as a possibilitv? 
Perhaps tables to facilitate the loca.tion of possible ‘Lbreaks”

From these tables it follows that as regards message So. 1 there can be a break after the ith, 8th, 
14th, 15th, 16th . . . letters but not after the 6th letter, nor after the 9th to 14th letters, nor 
after the lith 
to 21st letters, and so on; as regards message Ko. 2 there can be a break after the 
gth, lath, lsth, 19th, 20th, . . . letters but’ not after the 8th letter nor after the 11th to 18th 
letters, nor after the 21st to 27th letters, and so on. 
Referring again to the two VFAD sequences 
in T\‘o. 1 which may correspond with the VFAD sequence in Ko. 2, it was found that the first 
candidate would 
require a break immediately after the 17th letter. 
But the break table for So. 1 
precludes this possibility; hence the first VFAD sequence in No. 1 in position 14-17 may be climi- 
nated as a candidate, leaving the second VFAD, in position 126-130, as a candidate. 
This would 
require a break after the 130th letter and reference to the break table for No. 1 shows this to be a 
possibility. 
Hence, the VFAD in position 126-130 in So. 1 will tentatively 
be accepted as 
matching the VFAD sequence in So. 2. bother 
section of the text of one or the other crypto- 
gram is next selected, with a view to establishing additional identities. 
To go through the 
whole process here would consume too much space and time. 
Jforeover, it is not necessary, 
for the only purpose in carrying the demonstration &is far is t.o indicate to the student the 
general procedure and to show him some of the difficulties he will encounter in the identificn- 
tion of the similar portions when the test is composed of only a very limited number of different 
letters. 
In this case, after more or less tedious experiment,ation. the hypothesis of a key of 20 
columns is established as correct. whereupon two sets of 20 identities are uncovered and the 
identities are found t.o be as shown below.

These chains must now be united into a single chain by proper interlocking. 
Since cryptogram 
No. 1 has 12 long columns, and since the identities of these 12 columns aTe now known (1, 3, 
5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20), the interlocking 
of the two chains and hence the transposition

g, The two cryptograms may now be transcribed into their proper transpositiori matrices, 
as shown in figure 48, 
1 It is necessary to remark that in setting up the table of equivalencies, 
after determining the width of the 
rectangle, that message 
which has the lesser number of long columns is used as the basis for the normal sequence 
1, 2, 3, . . . . If the one having the greater number of long columns is employed as the base, the reconstructed 
key n-ill be reversed.

h. A frequency distribution 
is now made of all the bipartite pairs, so as to solve the encipher- 
ing checkerboard. 
There is no necessity for going through this part of the solution, for it falls 
along quite normal lines of monoalphabetic 
substitution. 
The two plain-test 
rectangles are 
shown in figure 49. The checkerboard 4 is found to be as shown in figure 50~.

4 Since the second cryptogram is addressed to the CG 23d Brigade and the first cryptogram mentions that 
the commander of that brigade has been ordered to do so and so, the solution of the groups GG (-2) and FG 
(~3) is made by inference. This gives the placement of these two digits in the cipher square.

i. Speculating upon the disposition of the letters within the enciphering checkerboard, it 
becomes evident that the key phrase upon which it is based is GERMAN MILITARY CIPHERS. 
The fact that the digit 2 follows B and the digit 3 follows C suggests that the digits are inserted 
immediately after the letters A, B, C, . . .) as they occur in the mixed sequence. xote the cells 
which still remain vacant after the key word mixed sequence is fully developed in the checker- 
board, and all the letters which do occur in the two messages are inserted in their correct cells

39. Special solution by means of identical beginnings.--a. 
In paragraph 23 u-as demon- 
strated the nn~thocl of solution bawl upon finding two cryptograms which are in the same key 
an(l the plain tests of which begin n-it11 the same words. 
The application of this method to the 
corresponding situation in the case of the ADFGVX system should by this time be obvious. 
The 
finding of identical sequences is somewhat easier in this case than in the case of identical endings 
because the identities can be found in parallel progression from the beginning to the end of the 
two crvptograms being compared. 
SIoreover, the discovery of two cryptograms with similar 
beginnings is easier than that of two with similar endings because in the former case the very 
first groups in the two cryptograms contain identities, whereas in the latter case the identities 
are hidden and scattered throughout the texts of the two cryptograms. 
On the other hand, the 
complete solution of a case of identical endings is very much more simple t’han that involving 
identical beginnings because in the former case the establishment of t’he identities carries with it 
almost automatically 
the complete reconstruction of the transposition key, whereas in the latter 
this is far from true and additional cryptograms may be essential in order t.o accomplish this 
sine qua non for the solution. 
b. The following represent 8 cryptograms of the same date, assumed to have been enciphered 
by the same key.

The cryptograms have been exsmined for identical beginnings, and xos. 3 and 6 apparently 
begin alike, identical portions being underlined as shown in figure 51. Now the number of 
identical sections in the two cryptograms is 15; this indicates that the width of the transposition 
rectangle is 15. Therefore, No. 3 (290 letters) has 5 long columns of 20 letters and 10 short 
columns of 19 letters [(15X20)-10=290]. 
Il’o. 6 (302 letters) has 2 long columns of 21 letters 
and 13 short columns of 20 letters [(15X21)-13=302]. 
The identical sections in No. 3 and 
No. 6 having been marked off as shown in figure 51, the next step is to transcribe the texts into 
their correct column lengths as given by the study of identical sections, writing them merely 
in their serial order, as shown in figure 52. In this transcription 
no serious difficulty is usually 
encountered in the division into correct column lengths, this process being guided by the identical 
sequences, the number of letters between the identical sequences, and the maximum and minimum 
lengths of the columns as calculated from the dimensions of the rectangle. 
Whenever difficulties 
are encountered in this process, they are brought about by accidental identities of letters before 
and after the true or actual identical sequences. In the present case no such difficulties arise 
except in going from column 12 to column 13. The identical sections for column 13 here consist 
of the sequence A F F A A F; if these sections are placed at the head of column 13, it leaves column 
12 one letter short at the bottom in each diagram. 
This means that the initial A's in these 
identical sequences represent an accidental identity; 
these A’s belong at the bottom of column 
12 in each diagram, and the true identical sequences are F F A A F, and not A F F A A F. In 
some cases there may be many more instances of such accidental identities before and after the 
true identical sequences. Another thing to be noted is that the identical beginnings in this 
case run along for at least 4 complete rows and part of the fifth row in the transposition rectangle. 
Therefore, the identical sequences should consist of not less than 4, and not more than 5 letters; 
any letters in excess of 5 in any identical sequence are accidental identities. 
There are several 
such accidental identities in the case under study, viz, in columns 5 and 12,

c. Now comes the attempt to place the columns in proper sequence in the respective trans- 
position rectangles, 
Since No. 6 has only 2 long columns, viz, 5 and 14, it is obvious that these 
two columns belong at the extreme left of the rectangle. 
Their order may be 5-14 or 14-5; 
there is no way of telling which is correct just yet. 
Since No. 3 has 5 long columns, z%z, 3, 4, 5, 
7, 14, and since from No. 6 it has been ascertained that 5 and 12 go to the extreme left, it is 
obvious that columns 3, 4, and 7 occupy the third, fourth, and fifth positions in the rectangles. 
Their order may be any permutation of the three numbers 3,4, and 7; their exact order must be 
ascertained by further study.

d. In this study, to fix the exact order of the columns and thus to reconstruct 
the tmnsposi- 
tion 
key, advantage can be taken of the diverse lengths of other cryptograms 
that 
may 
be 
available in the same key. 
In this case there are 6 additional cryptograms, Xos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 
and 8, suitable for the purpose. 
The following calculations are made:

Now So. 7 has 4 long columns, and these must consist of 4 columns from among the 5 already 
a.scertnined as falling at the extreme left, z’iz, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14. Columns 5 and 14 have further- 
more been placed in positions l-2, leaving columns 3, 4, and 7 for positions 3-4-5. 
Which 
of these three possibilities is t,o be omitted as a long column in No. 7? A means of answering 
this question involves certain considerations of general importance in the cryptanalysis of this 
type of system. 
e. Consider a transposition rectangle in which the number of columns is even, and consider 
specifically the first pair of columns in such a rectangle. 
The combinations of bipartite compo- 
nents formed by t’he juxtaposition 
of these 2 columns correspond to plain-text letters, and there- 
fore the distribution 
of the bipartite digraphs in these columns will be monoalphabetic in char- 
acter. 
The same is true with respect to the bipartite components in the third and fourth columns, 
the fifth and sixth columns, and so on. 
Hence, if a long cryptogram of this nature is at hand, 
and if the 2 columns which belong at the extreme left can be ascertained, then a distribution 
of 
the bipartite digraphs formed by juxtaposing these columns should not only be monoalphabetic, 
but also this distribution, 
ij it is at all normal, will a2ord a basis for matching other columns which 
11311 produce similar 
distributions, 
for the text as a whole is monoalphabetic. 
In this way, by 
proper matching of columns, those which really go together to form the pairs containing the 
bipartite equivalents of the plain-text letters can be ascertained. 
From that point on, the solu- 
tion of the problem is practically 
the same as t,hat of solving a columnar transposition cipher 
with nonfractionated letters. 
j. But now consider a plain-text rectangle in the ADFGVX system, in which the number of 
columns is odd, and consider specifically the first pair of columns in t’he rectangle. 
Now only the 
alternate combinations of bipartite 
components in these columns form the units of plain-text 
letters. 
The same is true of the bipartite components of the third and fourth, the fifth and sixth 
columns, and so on. 
In all other respects, however, the remarks contained in subparagraph e 
apply equally to this case where the width of the rectangle is odd. 
g. Returning to the problem under study, it has been ascertained t,hat columns 5 and 14 fall 
at the extreme left. 
Whether their correct order is 5-14 or 14-5 cannot at the moment be ascer- 
tained, nor is it essential. 
The thing to do is to make a distribution 
of the bipartite pairs and 
see what it is like. 
Since the width of the rectangle here is odd, only the lst, 3d, 5th, . . . pairs 
down the columns can be distributed in a frequency square. 
The results are shown in Fig. 53.

The distribution 
is fairly good. 
Five occurrences of AA a.re noted, 3 of FD. These must 
represent high-frequency letters. 
The 4 (Phi) test for monoalphabeticity 
may be applied. 
Expected value of C#J 
for plain text=.0667X21 
X20=28.01 
Expectedvalueof(bforrandomtext=.0385~2lX20=16.1i 
Observed value of 9 in this case=(5X4)+(2X1)+(2Xl)+(3X2)+(2Xl)+(2X1)=34 
The observed value of 4 is considerably greater than the expected value for plain text and more 
than twice as much as the expected value for random text. 
Using the distribution 
in figure 53 as 
a basis, an attempt is made to add to the 5-14 combination a column selected from among columns 
3,4, and i, so that the second, fourth, sixth . . . pairs down the second and third columns in the 
rectangle w-ill give bipartit.e pairs that will conform to the distribution 
noted in figure 53. Since 
the results sought will be very materially affected if the combination 5-14 should really be 14-5, 
all possible combinations of 5-14 and 14-5 with 3,4, and 7 must be tried. 
The various combina- 
tions tested are shown in figure 54.

j. These distributions 
are now tested for monoalphabeticity, 
by applying the 4 test 
Tllf~ 
number of occurrences in each distribution 
is 4 1. Then 41 X40X .0667= 109.4 is the expected 
value of 9 for plain t,ext; 41X40X.0385=63.1 
is the expected value of + for random text. 
Here are the calculat,ions for the first distribution 
(combination 5-14-3) yielding the observed 
value of I# as 82: 
(5X4)+(3X2)+(1X0)+(2X1)+(1X0>+ 
(2X1)+(3X2)+(1X0)+(1X0)+(5X4)+(2X1)+ 
(1X0)+(4X3)+(2X1)+(1X0)+(3X2)+(2X2)+(2X1)=82. 
The observed values of 4 for all 6 frequency distributions are shown herewith:

Only two of these distributions 
give close approsimations to 109, the expected value of 4, and

m. The additional bipartite pairs given by adding columns 4-7 to the basic combination 
14-5-3 are distributed in the 4th frequency distribution 
square of figure 55, yielding the distri- 
bution shown in square (1) of figure 57. The other squares in figure 57 are constructed in the 
same wa..y. for the other combinations of figure 56.

n. Again applying the +-test, the expected value of $I is 81 X80X.0667=432. 
The observed 
values for the four combinations of figure .!ii are as follows: 
(1) For combination 14-5-34-i, 
4=436 
(2) For combination 14-5-3-74, 
1#1=276 
(3) For combination 14-5-7-34, 
cp=344 
(4) For combination 14-5-7-4-3, 
+=318 
The combination 14-5-34-7, 
giving the greatest value for 4 (a little better than the expected 
value), is very probably the correct one. 
o. Examining t.he other cryptograms that arc available, it is seen that No. 7 is the third 
longest one of the entire set, with 124 letters; moreover, t,he dimensions of the rectangle [ (15 X 9) - 
11= 1241 are such as to bring about 4 long columns of 9 letters and 11 columns of 8 letters. 
The 
first 5 columns are definitely fixed in position, since it is known that the first 5 key numbers are 
14-5-3-4-T. 
The resulting diagram is shown in figure 58. There is now a section consisting of

10 columns which are to be anagrammed to ascertain their correct sequence. The column t,o 
follow column 7 is ascertained on the basis of the repetitions which are brought about when the 
selected column is placed on the right. 
These repetitions should fall into those cells of frequency 
distribution 
(l), figure 57, which are of high frequency. 
In other words, the process is one of 
selecting from among columns 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 that column which will yield 
the most repetitions of bipartite digraphs with the digraphs given by the juxtaposition of columns 
14-5-34-7, as dist’ributed in frequency square (1) of figure 57. The column thus selected turns 
out to be Ko. 10. Then other columns are added by proceeding along the same lines, the work 
becoming progressively more easy as the number of available candidates decreases. Sometimes 
the discovery of what appears to be a long repetition within one of the cryptograms or between 
two cryptograms facilitates the process. In this case the results obtained from the 3 crypto- 
grams under study are shown in figure 59.

p. What t,he cryptanalyst 
now has before him is a monoalphabetic subst’itution cipher, the 
solution of which presents no difficulties. 
The cipher square is reconstructed as completely as 
possible, blanks being left where there are no occurrences to give clues as to the character involved, 
usually some of the digits and the very infrequent letters. 
not occur in the plain text are Q, X, and Z. 
In this case the only letters which do 
The digits 5 and 7 are recovered from the context, 
in message No. 6, where the caliber of a gun is mentioned and the digits are confirmed at other 
places in the message. The square that is obtained is seen in figure 60. Examination 
of the 
mixed sequence discloses that it is based upon the phrase THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN THE 
SPRING. This permits of the establishment of the transposition key and of the position of the 
digits in the checkerboard (as in par. 38i). 
solved messages are shown in figure 62. 
The results are shown in figure 61. The completely

40. Special solution by the exact factor method.-u. 
The student who has comprehended 
the successive steps in the solution of the example discussed in the preceding paragraph is in a 
position to grasp at once the mechanics of the special solution by the exact factor method. 
The 
latter is based upon the interception of a number of cryptograms, preferably lengthy ones, which 
have been enciphered by rectangles in which the last row is completely filled with letters. 
The 
total number of bipartite components in the case of such a cryptogram will yield clues as to the 
dimensions of the kansposition rectangle. 
Then the text is transcribed into columns of appro- 
priate length, all being equal in this respect, and the process of combining columns, as explained 
in paragraph 39e, is applied in order to produce the best monoalphabetic distribution 
of bipartite

digraphs down the juxtaposed 
CO~UIKUS. 
There is nothing to prevent the simultaneous use of 
all cryptograms that have been enciphered by completely filled rectangles, for it is clear that 
if, for example, columns 15 and 4 are to be paired in one cryptogram, the same columns will be 
paired in all the other cryptograms. 
Hence, even if the rectangles are small in depth they can 
be used in this process; it is necessary only that all columns of any rectangle be of the same 
length. 
Now if only two or three such pairs of columns can be set up correctly, solution follows 
almost as a matter of course. 
No additional or new principles need be brought into play, beyond 
those already possessed by the student. 
b. In this special solution, the important step is, of course, the initial one of experimenting 
with rectangles of various dimensions until the correct size has been hit upon. 
In some cases, 
excessive experimentation may not be necessary if the total number of characters is such as to 
yield only one or two possibilities with regard to the length of the columns. 
For example, suppose 
that previous work has established the fact that the enemy uses transposition rectangles not 
less than 15 and not more than 22 columns in width. 
A message totaling 703 letters would 
indicate a rectangle of 19 columns of 37 letters, since these two numbers are the only factors of 
703. 
If this then were corroborat,ed by other cryptograms of 76 (19X4), 152 (19X8), 
190 
(19 X 10) letters, the probability 
that 19 is the width of the transposition rectangle becomes quite 
persuasive. 
Of course, there will be and there should be other cryptograms of lengths that do 
not factor exactly; these represent the ones in which the rectangles are not completely filled in 
their last row. 
They do not enter into the solution at first, but just as soon as the positions of 
two or three key numbers become tied, 
the data afforded by these messages become available 
for use in the later stages in the solution. 
c. The exact-factor method is a useful one to know. ‘For despite all instructions 
that 
may be drawn up insisting upon the advisability of not completing the last row of a transposition 
rectangle, the tendency to violate such a rule is quite marked, especially where a large crypto- 
graphic personnel must be employed. 
It is not astonishing to find that for lazy or ignorant clerks 
the temptation to fill the rectangle completely is particularly 
hard to resist when it happens that 
a message falls just one, two, or three letters short of forming a completely-filled 
rectangle: 
it is so much easier for such clerks to handle a rectangle with equal-length columns than one in 
which this is not the case. Moreover, the number of errors and therefore the number of times a 
shiftless or careless clerk must go over his work to correct errors is reduced to a minimum. 
Hence, it often happens that in such cases an enciphering clerk adds one, two, or three letters 
to complete the last row, thus leading to the transmission of not a few cryptograms enciphered 
by completely-filled rectangles. 
Space forbids giving an example of such a solution. 
41. General solution for the ADFGVX system.+. 
All three of the foregoing methods of 
solving cryptograms in the ADFGVX system fall in the category of special solutions and therefore 
are dependent upon the fortuitous existence of the special conditions required under each case. 
What is really desired in the practical situation is a method of solution which is not so dependent 
upon chance or good fortune for success. A search for a general solution was, of course, made 
during the time that the system was under minute study by the cryptanalytic 
agencies of the 
Allies, but no general solution was devised. 
All the solutions made during actual hostilities 
and for a number of weeks thereafter were of the special types described in the preceding para- 
graphs. 
The first published description of a general solution is to be found in Givierge’s Cows 
de Ctryptographie, 
1925, but only in broad outlines. 
A complete general solution was inde- 
pendently conceived by a group of cryptanalysts in the office of the Chief Signal Officer 6 and 
will be described in paragraphs 42 and 43. 
b. The attention of the student is directed to the comments made in paragraph 18, with 
regard to the significance of the term general solution in cryptanalysis. 
He must be cautioned 
‘ See footnote 7 of this sectinn.

125 
not to expect that in practical work a general solution will, in the cryptanalytic 
as in the mathe- 
matical field! invariably 
lead to a solution. 
If there is a sufficient amount of text and if the text 
contains no abnormalities, the attempt to apply the general solution will usually be successful. 
But the cryptanalyst 
must remember that the ADFGVX system is by no means a simple one to 
solve even under the best of conditions and if there is only a small amount of text, if it happens 
that the transposition key is unusually long, or if the text is abnormal, he may not succeed in 
solving the messages by the straightfor\vard 
method to be set forth below, and he may have to 
introduce special modifications. 
For the latter he can only rely upon his own ingenuity and 
intuition. 
42. Basic principles 
of the general solution.--a. 
Every transposition 
rectangle in the 
ADFGVX system must conform to one or the other of two and only two fundamental types: the 
number of columns must be either odd or even.” A number of important consequences follow from 
this simple fact, some of which have already been pointed out in paragraph 39e. They will be 
elaborated upon in the next subparagraphs. 
b. Consider a rectangle with an even number of columns. 
Each of its rows contains an 
even number of bipartite components, half of which are initial components, half, jhzl 
compo- 
nents, alternating in a regular order from left to right in the rows. 
When the transposition is 
applied, all the components within a given column are of the same class, either initial or final. 
No intermixture 
or alternation 
of t,he two classes is-possible. 
On the other hand, consider a 
rectangle with an odd number of columns. 
Each of its rows contains an odd number of bipartite 
components, t,he 1st row containing one more initial component than final components, the 2d 
row containing one more final component than initial components, and so on, this arrangement 
alternating 
regularly in the successive rows of the rectangle. 
When one studies the various 
columns of the rectangle, it is seen that in each column there is a perfectly regular alternation of 
initial 
and final components, the odd columns (lst, 3d, 5th, . . . ) beginning with an initial 
component, the even columns (2d, 4th, 6th, . . . ) beginning with a final component. 
This 
alternation in components remains true even after the transposition is applied. 
These remarks 
become very clear if one studies figure 63. Two transposition rectangles are shown, one with 
an even number of columns, the other with an odd number. 
Instead of the actual components 
(ADFGVX), the symbols G1 and & are used to indicate the two classes of component.s, initial and 
final, because in this analysis interest centers not upon the actual identity of a component but 
upon the class to which it belongs, initial or final. 
At the top of each column is placed a “plus” 
to denote a column occupying an odd-numbered position in the rectangle, or a “minus” to denote 
a column occupying an even-numbered position.

c. In what follows, the term “odd column” will mean merely that the column in question 
occupies an odd position (lst, 3d, 5th; . . .) in the transposition rectangle; the term “even 
column,” that it occupies an even position (2d, 4th, 6th, . . .) in the rectangle. 
The odd or 
even designation has no reference whatever to the nature of the transposition key number appli- 
cable to that column, whether it is odd or even. 
Now when the transposition is applied to the 
even-width rectangle a, figure 63, the cryptographic text will consist of a number of sections of 
letters, each section corresponding to a column of the rectangle, and therefore the number of 
Page 131

126 
sections in this case will be even. 
Moreover, all the components in a section correspondjng to 
an odd column in rectangle a will be 0, or initial components, all those in a section corresponding to 
an even column, 02 or final components. The sections or columns are completely homogeneous with 
respect to the class to which their constituent components belong. 
On the other hand, when the 
transposition is applied to odd-width rectangle b, the cryptographic text will consist of an odd 
number of sections, each corresponding to a column of the rectangle. 
The components in the 
sections consist of members of both classes of components in a regular alternation; in a section 
corresponding to an odd column the order is &+&+c& 
. . . ; in a section corresponding to an 
even column the order is &+e1+e2 
. . . . The sections or columns are not homogeneous in this 
case as they are in the former. 
d. Now if there were some way of distinguishing between initial components as a class and 
final components as a class it is clear that it may be possible f+st of all to ascertain whether the 
transposition rectangle contains an even or an odd number of columns. 
Secondly it may be 
possible to identify those columns which are even and those which are odd. 
Finally, it may be 
possible to ascertain which are the long columns and which are short, thus yielding the exact 
outlines of the rectangle in case the last row is incompletely filled. 
From that point on, solution 
follows along the same lines as explained in paragraph 40, with the modification that in the pair- 
ing of columns the number of possibilities is greatly reduced, since it is useless to pair two columns 
both containing initial components or &al components. 
e. The foregoing depends then upon the possibility of being able to distinguish as a class 
between initial and fmal components of the bipartite cipher equivalents in this system, or at 
least between letters belonging to one or the other of these two general classes of components. 
Now if the substitution 
checkerboard has not been consciously manipulated with a view to 
destroying certain properties normally characterizing its rows and colunms, the sort of differenti- 
ation indicated above is quite possible. 
For example, if in the checkerboard shown in figure 61 
the normal frequencies of the letters as they appear in English telegraphic plain text E are inserted 
in the cells and totals are obtained vertically and horizontally, 
these totals will permit of assign- 
ing frequency weights to the letters ADFGVX as initial and as Cnal letters of the bipartite cipher 
equivalents of the plain-text letters. 
This is shown below in figure 64. The bipartite letter A

has a frequency value of 284 as an init.ial component of the bipartite cipher equivalents of plain- 
text letters, and a frequency value of only 169 as a final component. 
Similarly, the letters V and X have frequency values of 4T and 69, respectively, as initial com- 
ponents and 120 and 198 as final components. 
It is obvious, then, that in this checkerboard the 
weighted frequency values of the letters A, V, and X as initial components differ considerably from 
the values of these same letters as final components, the value for G as an initial is only a little 
less than its value as a final, the values of D and F as initia.ls are only a little more than their 
values as finals. 
But it is the wide variations in the weighted frequency values of certain of the 
letters as initial components and as final components, exemplified in the case of A, V, and X, 
which form the basis of the general solution, because these wide variations afford a means for 
making the various differentiations noted in subparagraph d. 
f. Of course, in working with an unknown example, the composition of the checkerboard is 
unknown and t,herefore no accurate frequency weights may be assigned to the ADFGVX com- 
ponents in the cryptograms. 
However, it is still possible to arrive at some approximations for 
these weights in case there are several cryptograms available for study, as would normally be 
true in actual practice. 
How this can be done will be shown very soon, by studying an example. 
For the purposes of t,his study the set of 12 cryptograms given below will be used.

of so1ntion.‘-u. 
Since the initial letters of all 12 cryptograms are in the 
same class, that is, either initid 
or final components, they may all be combined into a single 
distribution. 
Furthermore, since it is certain that regardless of whether the transposition 
rectangle 
has an odd or an even number of columns the 3d, 5th, 7th . . . letters of the cryptograms are in 
7 This illustration 
uses the same cryptograms 
and follows quite closely along the lines employed in a tech- 
nical paper of the Signal Intelligence 
Service entitled 
General Solution for the ADFGVX 
Cipher, prepared by 
Messrs. Rowlett, 
Kullback, 
and Sinkov, in 1934.

130 
the same class as the first let,ter, the 3d, 5th, 7th . . . letters may be added to the distribution, 
so long as these odd letters come from the same section (column 1). It is, however, necessary 
to limit the number of letters taken from the beginning of any one cryptogram to a reasonable 
length of column, depending on the size of the cryptogram. 
Assuming it is known that the 
enemy is using transposition keys of not less than 15 nor more than 22 numbers, the latter could 
be taken as the maximum possible size. But to be on the safe side it will be here assumed that 
a transposition rectangle of not more than 25 columns is being used. Hence, so far as concerns 
cryptogram I, which has 212 letters, on the basis of a key of 25 numbers [(25X9)-13=212] 
there will be 12 columns of 9 letters and 13 columns of 8 letters. 
Since there is no way of telling 
which are long and which are short columns, it will be safer to work on the basis of columns of 
8 letters. 
Therefore, the first 8 lett,ers of cryptogram I are to be taken. 
In the case of crypto- 
gram II, with 108 letters, its first 4 letters will be taken, and so on, through the 12 cryptograms, 
the number of letters to be taken in each case being governed by the length of the cryptogram. 
The sections taken in the case of the 12 cryptograms are shown in figure 65.

b. The odd and the even letters of these 12 sections are then distributed separately, the 
results being shown in figures 66 and 67. A consideration of the mechanics of this system leads 
to the expectation that if the transposition 
rectangle has an even number of columns the two d&&i- 
butions will be similar; 
;;f it has an oak! number, they wiLJ be dijerent. 
The similarity or difference 
between the two distributions is usually discernible with as few as 20 or 25 letters.

c. Letters V and X are of high frequency in the odd positions (fig. 66) but of low frequency 
in the even positions (fig. 67), whereas the letter F is of low frequency in the odd positions and of 
high frequency in the even positions. 
There can be no question that the two distributions 
are 
dissimilar, and the indications are clear that the transposition rectangle involves an odd number 
of columns. 
d. Now the letters in figure 66 may be initial components, those in figure 67, final com- 
ponents, or the reverse may be the case. At the present stage of the study it is impossible to 
ascertain which of these alternative hypotheses is correct. 
immaterial at this stage. 
However, this information is really 
Suppose the letters in figure 66 are arbitrarily 
designated as class 1 
components, those in figure 67 as class 2 components. 
Class 1 components (fig. 66) are charac- 
terized by a predominance of V’s and X’s (over their frequencies in fig. 67); class 2 components 
(fig. 67) are characterized by a predominance of F’s (over its frequency in fig. 66).

e. The two distributions in figures 66 and 67 apply to the letters which come from column 1 
of the transposition rectangles for the 12 cryptograms understudy. 
In this column, the V’s and 
X’s fall predominantly 
in the odd positions, the F’s fall predominantly 
in the even positions. 
Therefore! beginning with position 1, the components in this column show an alternation of the 
type &-+ 9*+ 9,. 
By referring to figure 63 it will become clear that if class 1 components are 
initial components, then it must follow that column 1 occupies an odd position in the transpo- 
sition rectangle; but, if class 1 components are final components, then it must follow that column 
1 occupies an even posit’ion in the transposition rectangle. 
Which of these alternatives is true 
cannot be ascertained at the moment,. 
But the important point to be noted is that a definite reversal 
in the type of alternation 
of class 1 and class 2 components indicates the transit, in the transposition, 
from the end of one column to the beginning of the next column. 
That is, if it is found that from the 
beginning of the cryptogram the alternation of components is 01-+ @-, & and after a number 
of letters this alternation changes to &+ &-+ &, the point where this change occurs marks the 
end of column 1 and the beginning of the column 2. For the sake of brevity in reference, in the 
subsequent, paragraphs the type of alternation &+ &-J @I will be designated as the “ + type,” 
and this type of alternation characterizes columns which fall in the odd positions in the trans- 
position rectangle i. e., in the lst, 3d, 5th, P, 
. . . positions from the left. 
The other type, 
e2+@+& 
will be designated as the “ - type,” and this type of alternation characterizes columns 
which fall in the even positions in the transposition rectangle i. e., in the 2d, 4&, 6*, 8*, . . . 
positions from the left. 
f. With these principles in mind, let cryptograms III and XI, each containing 186 letters, be 
studied. 
They may be superimposed, since they have identical numbers of letters and therefore 
the columns end at exactly the same points in both cryptograms.

9. It has already been noted that beginning with the first letter of any one of the crypto- 
grams, the type of a.lternation for column 1 is +. 
It is therefore not astonishing to find, within 
the first 10 letters, an alternation of the + type. 
Sate bon- the V’s and X’s fall in the odd posi- 
tions, the F’s in the even. 
Thus: 
III. 
ZLEhZEtE% 
XI. 
lFDD!AXGDA 
It is seen that there are 2 V’s which fall in odd positions (1 and 5), but one V falls in an even 
position (10). 
There is an X, n-hich falls in an odd position (7) ; there are 2 F’s which fall in even 
positions (2 and 6). 
Unquestionably, 
then, the type of alternation, 
at least’ for the first 10 
letters in each of t,hese cryptograms, is f. 
h. Take the next section of 10 letters in these two cryptograms. 
The letters are as follows:

Here there are 4 F’s; 3 of them fall in odd positions (13, 17, If), and one falls in an even position 
(12). There are 2 X’s; one falls in an odd position (19)) one in an even position (16). 
There are no 
V’s among these letters. 
So far as the evidence afforded by the F’s is concerned, it would appear 
that this section of text shows the type 2 or “ - type” of alternation of components, since in 
type 1 or “ + type” t,he F’s occupy even positions and here the majority of them occupy odd 
positions. 
But so far as the X’s are concerned, the evidence is equally balanced: one X falls in an 
odd position, one in an even posit,ion. 
There being no V’s, no conclusions can be drawn from this 
letter. 
To be guided solely by the evidence afforded by the 3 F’s may be unwarranted. 
Is it 
not, possible to weight the frequencies of the letters so that it will be unnecessary t.o rely merely 
upon a few of them and the evidence afforded by all the letters can be taken into account? 
Khy 
not assign frequency weights according to t,he two distributions in figures 66 and 67? The figures 
then become as follows: 
Odd (lst, 3d, . , .) letters 
Even (2d, 4th, . . .) letters

Since the odd letters have a total frequency of 42, the even, a total frequency of 35, for purposes 
of equalizing the distributions 
in applying the weights it seems advisable to deduct one-sixth 
from the total when applying the weights to odd letters. 
i. NOW in applying these weights to the letters, it must be borne in mind that since a trans- 
position rectangle with an odd number of columns is involved, half of the letters are class 1 com- 
ponents, the other half are class 2 components. 
Hence, in finding the frequency value of the 
letters it is necessary to apply the weighted frequencies to alternate letters in the sections, as 
shown in figure 70.

These distributions, 
when evaluated in accordance with figure 69, “yield a tota. frequency value 
of 126; n-hen evalua,ted in accordance with figure 69 reversed, yield a total frequency value of 
143. The detailed calculations are as follows: 
On the basis of figure 69 normal (odd letters as &‘s, even letters as @‘s): 
0(3)+3(11)+3(3)+3(8)+0(11)+1(6)=72 
72 72

0(4)+3(10)+3(11)$3(5)+ 
0(4)+1(1)=79 
=79 
Total= 143 
j. Eow the frequency sums here obt.ained (126 VS. 143) indicate that an alternation of the 
type 92+@+02 is in effect, that is, if a beginning is made with position 11, t,he type of alterna- 
tion is “ - “. 
Since the type of alternation for the first 10 letters is “+” 
and for the second 
10 letters “ -“, 
the reversal in alternation would indicate that column 1 of the transposition 
rectangle ends somewhere near the 10th letter. 
This same sort of reversal takes place aft’er the 
20th letter, as show-n by the calculation in figure 71.

Beginning winth the 21st position, the alternation is of type EJ-+&-+@; hence it isof the” f” type. 
Again the reversal in type of alternation occurs in passing from the 2d set of 10 letters to the 3d 
set, and this indic.ates that’ column 2 of the transposition rectangle ends somewhere near the 20th 
letter. 
But, fortunately, 
this time the exact location of the break is definitely indicated: The 
simultaneous appearance of V and X in the sequent positions 22 and 23 leads to the idea that the 
22d letter marks the end of column 2 and the 23d letter marks the beginning of column 3. 
There is 
nothing of an absolute nature in this point: 
It is merely an indication based upon probabilities and 
does not constitute a conclusive proof by any means. Now if there is this definite break at the 
end of 22 letters it means that columns 1 and 2 must each contain 11 letters. 
The calculations 
have heretofore been based upon sections of 10 letters and the results are therefore modified as

X-. Sow if columns 1 and 2 contain 11 letters, and the total number of letters is 186, the 
transposition rectangle obviously has 17 columns, there being 16 long columns of 11 letters and 
one short column of 10 letters [ (17 X 11) - 1= 1861. 
1. There is another cryptogram which also contains but one short column, viz, VII, 
of 254 
letters [17X 15) -1=254]. 
The columns of this cryptogram contain 4 more letters than the 
corresponding columns of III and XI. 
Assuming, momentarily, that the last column is the short 
one, cryptogram VII may be added to the superposition of III and XI, provided these sets of 4 
additional letters are accounted for. 
This has been done in figure i2. 
In that figure the 4 
extra letters pert,aining to cryptogram VII are shown as falling under the last letters of the col- 
umns of cryptograms III 
and XI, but this is only an arbitrary 
placement. 
It is sufficient’ to 
place these extra letters in such positions as will make the first one of the series begin in an even 
position . 
m. Since the transposition rectangle is now known to be 17 columns wide, the data in figure 
69 may be enlarged to correspond to this information. 
For example, whereas in originally 
constructing figure 69 the first column of cryptogram I was assumed to have only 8 let.ters (to 
correspond to a key of 25 numbers), it may now be extended to a column of 12 letters, and so on. 
The additional portions used to make the distributions 
in figure 74 are shown underlined in 
figure 73.

‘Since the distribution

basis of figure 74 reversed, the type of alternation for the sixth section or column is e1+e2-+e1, 
or “ +“. 
T. But perhaps advantage should be taken of the availability 
.of additional cryptograms. 
For example, cryptogramV, of 202 letters, has 2 short columns [(17X 12)-2=202], 
whereas the 
cryptograms thus far dealt with each have but one. That is, cryptogram V has one short column 
in common with cryptograms III, XI, and VII,.and 
one additional short column not possessed 
by the latter. g Can this additional short column of cryptogram V be located? 
s. Suppose coiumn 1 of crypt,ogram V is the additional short column. 
Then the letters of 
column 2 would be F X F X F F F V A G F D. 
These letters when evaluated on the 
basis of figure 74 normal yield a total of 77; when weighted on the basis of figure 74 reversed, 
a total of 144. The calculation is as follows:

According to this calculation, column 2 of cryptogram V seems to correspond to the type of 
alternation e2-+e1-+e2, 
that is “ - “. 
But from previous work it is fairly certain that column 2 
is of the “ +” 
type. 
Hence, cohnnn 1 of cryptogram V is probably not the additional short 
column of that message. Assuming column 2 to be the extra short column, no such contra- 
diction is obtained, for the calculation is as follows:

Since the greatest total is obtained on the basis of figure 74 normal, the type of alternation 
is 
e1+e2+e, and column 3 is a “ +” column, which is consistent with the formula + + + - + for 
columns 1 to 5, as previously ascertained. 
If all the foregoing reasoning is correct, and column 2 is the additional short column for crypto- 
gram V, it must be the next to the last column of the transposition rectangle. 
Since it is a 
” +” 
column, the last column must be a “-” 
one; therefore, there are 9 ‘(-I’ 
columns and 
8 ” +” columns. 
This definitely determines that the “ -” 
columns are the odd ones, the “ j-” 
columns the even ones, since in an odd-width rectangle there is one more odd column than even 
columns. 
t. The single short column which is common to cryptograms III, XI, a.nd VII is one of the 
columns beyond column 5. Assuming each possibility in turn, there is obtained for the type of 
alternation in each column the distributions 
of “ +” and “ -” 
shown in figure 75.

u. The correct assumption must satisfy the following conditions: 
(a) There must be 9 “ - ” and 8 “ + ” columns. 
(b) The short column must be “ -“.

Only assumptions (3) and (51, in which column 8 and column 10 are short columns, satisfy these 
conditions. 
Therefore, column 2 is followed by either column 
8 or 10. Testing the combination 
2-8 for monoalphabeticity 
of bipartite 
pairs, the distribution 
shown in figure 76 is obtained. 
1Vhen combination 2-10 is tested, the distribution 
shown in figure 77 is obtained. 
Obviously, 
the 2-8 combination is the better.

0. It is possible by introducing 
cryptograms with additional short columns to determine 
more of the key. 
Thus, it was found by using cryptograms XII and VI that the first 3 numbers 
of the transposition key are 16-5-7. 
But the process of anagramming will yield the solution at 
least as rapidly. 
In this process, of course, advantage may be taken of the fact that the columns 
have been classified into the “ + ” and “ - ” types and no combinations of two “ + ” or two 
I( -“columns 
need be tested, since only combinations of the type“ + -“or“ 
- + “are permissible.

x. All the foregoing details concern a case in which the transposition rectangle has an odd 
number of columns. 
Now if the rectangle contains an even number of columns, this type of 
solution is, of course, still applicable, and in fact is easier, since t,he letters of the text of the re-

spective 
sections do not have to be distributed into odd and even letters. 
It is only necessary 
to identify 
a section as being composed of initial 
components or of final components. 
This 
analysis then protluces a series of sections correspondin g in number with the number of columns 
in the transposition rectangle. 
This number will, of course, be even. 
By a careful study of 
n-here alternations in composition of components (0, or &) occur, the division of the text into 
sections corresponding to long and short columns can be accomplished. 
The remaining steps

obvious and follow the lines elucidated in paragraph 39e-j. 
ZJ. The entire structure upon which this general solution rests is destroyed if the substitution 
checkerbooid has been consciously manipulated to equalize or flatten out the sums of the weighted 
frequencies of the letters in its rows and columns. 
For example, note the following checkerboard, 
which is not “perfect” 
but gives approximately 
similar frequencies in its rows and columns.8

44. Review of principles underlying the cryptographic method.-Several 
bifid fractionating 
systems have been explained in previous texts of this series.’ 
In certain of these systems four 
basic steps are involved, two of substitution 
and two of transposition. 
These steps may be 
briefly described as follows: (1) A process of decomposition (substitution), 
in which each plain- 
text letter is replaced by two components, 0: and @, of a bifid or bipartite 
alphabet; (2) a 
process of separation (transposition), 
in which the 8%; components originally 
paired together 
are separated; (3) a process of recombination 
(transposition), 
in which the separated compo- 
nents are combined to form new pairs; (4) a process of recomposition (substitution), 
in which 
each new pair of components is given a letter value according to the original or a different bifid 
alphabet. 
45. Example of a simple bifid cipher----u. One of the simplest bifid fractionating 
systems 
is that exemplified in the following subparagraphs. 
It will be employed to set forth certain 
principles in the general solution of systems of this and similar nature. 
b. Given the 25-cell substitution 
checkerboard shown in figure 80, let the message to be 
enciphered be ONE PLANE REPORTED LOST AT SEA. 
The first step is to replace the plain- 
text letters by the bipartite equivalents, the two elements or components being set down ver- 
tically beneath the plain-text 
letters. 
This represents the first two of the four processes re- 
ferred to in paragraph 44, the first being that of decomposition or substitution, 
the second, that 
of separation or transposition, represented by the manner in which the two bipartite elements 
are set down vertically 
(instead of horizontally), 
thus separating the two elements from their 
normal horizontal juxtaposition.

The third process, that of recombination or recomposition, also involving a transposition, is now 
to be performed and will consist in combining elements standing in diagonal relationship to the 
right, that is, as shown by the arrows below:

giving the pairs 21, 33, 34, 34, 11, 21, 33, etc. 
There are left, at the end of the process, one 
element in the upper line at the extreme left and another element in the lower line at the extreme 
right, yielding the pair 24, which may be placed at the head or tail of the resultant combinations, 
as preagreed. 
The last or fourth process, that of recomposition or substitution, is to replace the 
new pairs of components by letters from the original or a new checkerboard. 
If the same 
checkerboard is used, it yields the text shown herewith:

c. Another and perhaps more simple way of accomplishing the same process is to set down 
t.he bipartite equivalents horizontally

The results are identical with those obtained from the preceding manner of operation. 
The 
text is of course sent in 5-letter groups. 
d. Instead of using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as the bipartite components one can use the 
vowels A, E, I, 0, U, or any other characters that are deemed suitable. 
Perhaps digits are best 
as they are less likely to be confused with letters of the text. 
e. As intimated above, the checkerboard used for the recomposition may be different from 
that employed in the decomposition. 
But it will be shown that the additional safety afforded 
by using two different checkerboards is somewhat illusory, and is by no means as great as may 
appear on first consideration.

These five encipherments have in common a plain-text 
digraph EN. The fire cipher versions, 
however, have only a single letter in common, B. This is, of course, a phenomenon already 
encountered many times by t,he student and its cause is easily underst,ood by him: The mechanics 
of the system tend to reduce by one character the lengths of the repetitions in the cipher test, 
as compared with their lengths in the plain text, a trigraphic repetition in t,he plain test mnni- 
festing itself as a digraphic repetition in the cipher text, a tetragraphic one becoming a trigraphic, 
and so on. 
More will later be stated on this phase of the matter. 
b. But now study the individual 
cipher letter immediately preceding and succeeding the 
cipher letter which these five encipherments have in common. 
They are as follo&-s: 
Letters preceding B, ____________ 
N, X, E, P, R 
Letters succeeding B, ____________ 
H, E, D, B, K 
Reference to the checkerboard discloses t,he very interesting and important fact that the letters 
preceding the cipher repetition (B,) all come from the same column in the checkerboard, the letters 
succeeding the repetition 
all come from the same row in the checkerboard. 
How this phenomenon 
is brought about is quite simple to see. Take the first of the five examples, that in which 
C E N 0, produces N B H,. The N, is the result of combining the second component of the 
bipartite equivalent of C, with the first component bipartite equivalent, of E,, yielding the com- 
bination 13, which is N. No matt,er what the other three letters in the plain-text 
tetragraph 
may be, if the second letter is E&, the second component bified equivalent of the first letter of 
the cipher trigraph must be a 3. This means that this first letter of the cipher trigraph must 
come from column 3 of the checkerboard. 
Exactly which row this letter will come from is deter- 
mined by the identity of the second component of the bifid equivalent of the first letter of the 
f 
plain-text 
tetragraph. 
Hence, since the 5 tetragraphs in the example all have the same plain- 
t,ext letter in the second position, the initial letters of the cipher trigraphs all must come from 
the same column of the checkerboard. 
It is unnecessary to go through the reasoning, which is 
parallel, in the case of the third letters of the cipher trigraphs: these all must come from the 
same row of the checkerboard. 
c. A good understanding 
of the phenomenon just noted can certainly be employed to 
advantage in solving this and similar types of systems, for it becomes obvious that a careful study 
of the letters immediately 
preceding and following 
cipher repetitions should facilitate 
a reconstruction 
of the checkerboard employed in the substitution.2 
Indeed, if there were no other phenomena to 
disturb this very simple relationship, solution would be quite easy. All that would be required 
would be to study the prefixes and auf&es to all the A’s, B's, C's, . . . in the cryptogram, find 
the letters which belong in the same columns and rows of the checkerboard, and the reconstruc- 
tion of the latter would follow very simply. 
Unfortunately, 
however, there is a disturbing 
phenomenon which must now be considered. 
1 The principle involved in such recomtruction 
was, to my knowledge, first pointed out and successfully 
employed early in 1938 by Aaaociate Cq-ptanslyata 
5. Kullbsck 
and A. Sinkov.

in the corresponding positSion in the case of the first fiv(* c~nci~~l,t~rmc~~~~s;. 
b11t also tl;c+:tb two Icnttcrs 
are themselves in different columns. 
The, cause of tllis is not tlifhcult to see. It is mtbrc,ly that 
the second component of the P, and the second component of the R, happen to be identical, the 
first component of the U, and the first component of the M, also happen to be identical, thus 
producing the same cipher letter in both cases. This is a phenomenon which must happen by 
chance a certain number of times, a number which is dependent not only upon the mechanics 
of the system but also upon the exact composition of the checkerboard. 
Disregarding for t.he 
moment the latter factor, it is obvious that if the checkerboard is perfectly balanced, the bifid 
element 3, for example, should occur 20 percent of the time as the first or as the second element 
of a bifid pair, since there are 5 elements and each can t,heoretically appear an equal number of 
times. 
However, since the checkerboard is not perfectly balanced, the bifid element 5 can, in 
the case of figure 80, appear as a second component of the bipartite equivalent of a cipher letter 
only very rarely, since it corresponds to the first component, of the bifid equivalents of the letters 
V, W, X, Y, and Z, all of which are of low frequency. 
On the other hand, the bifid element 3, in 
the case of figure 80, can appear very frequently as a first component of the bifid equivalent of 
a cipher letter because it is the second component of the bifid equivalents for the high-frequency 
plain-text letters N, R, and E, which are all in column 3. However, since the exact composition 
of the checkerboard is unknown when cryptograms of this sort are to be solved, frequency 
weights can, of course, not be assigned to any of the components or bipartite elements and it 
will have to be assumed that each one has an equal probability 
of occurrence, that is, one-fifth. 
e. From the foregoing discussion it is obvious that it would be unwise merely to study the 
prefixes and sufhxes to identical single letters of the cipher text in an attempt to solve crypto- 
grams of this sort, for the disturbing effect of the accidental identities of certain cipher letters 
would be sufficient to retard solution. 
A few detailed examples of the type of study t,hat must 
be made in connection with repetitions in such systems as this will now be given. 
j. It was stated in subparagraph a that the mechanics of the system tend to reduce by one 
character the lengths of the repetitions in the cipher text. 
The expression “tend to reduce” 
aptly describes the situation, for not only can it happen that a 3-letter repetition in the plain 
text may appear to remain a 3-letter repetition in the cipher text, but also it can happen that 
a S-letter repetition in the plain text may even appear as a pseudo 4-let,ter repetit’ion in the 
cipher text.

(0 and

g. From a study of these phenomena the rule may be deduced that an n-letter repetition 
in the plain text is really reduced to an (n-l)-letter 
repetition in the cipher text, but it can happen 
fortuitously 
3 that the real repet’ition is extended on either or both ends of the repetition by a 
pseudo-repetitious 
letter. 
Hence, a 3-letter plain-text 
repetition may appear as a 2-, 3-, or 
d-letter repetition in the cipher-text. 
h. It is thcrefore possible to make wholly erroneous deductions from some repetitions, es- 
pecially if t.he latter are short.

as a basis:

Here are 2 sequences of 5 cipher letters, identical 
save 
in the central letter, and yet the g-letter 
plain text sequences have only 2 letters in common. 
This example is cited to show that the 
cryptanalyst 
must’ be very careful in respect to the deductions he may make in the case of short 
repetit’ions. 
In the example cited it happens that the accidental repetitions are such as to make 
the sequences as a whole almost appear to be identical. 
i. It is these pseudo-repetitious 
elements which complicate the solution of what would 
otherwise be a simple system. 
To illustrate what is meant, note that in case (1) of subparagraph 
f the letters W, and O,, the prefixes to the repetition RP,, do actually come from the same column 
of t.he checkerboard; the letters D, and K,, the suffixes, do actually come from the same row. 
But now note in case (2) that while the prefixes D, and T, come from the same column, the suf- 
fixes C, and L, do not come from the same row. 
Note also in case (3) that while the prekxes 
L, and T, do not, come from the same column, the stixes, 
D, and B,, do come from the same row; 
while in case (4) the prefixes turn out to be the same letter, T, (which c,onstitutes an example 
where the two prefixes come from the same column) but, the suffixes, M, and E,, come from differ- 
ent rows. 
Since the exact length of the real repetition, without its pseudo-repetitious elements, 
does not readily manifest itself in the cipher text (although in favorable cases it may be deduced 
by a careful detailed analysis and comparison with nearly similar repetitions) the nature of the 
dif%culties confronting the cryptanalyst 
become apparent. 
j. The nature of the detailed analysis and comparison of repetitions referred to above may 
require a few words of explanation. 
Suppose that a cryptogram shows many occurrences of 
RP, (= THE, in the foregoing examples). 
It would indicat’e a high-frequency plain-text trigraph. 
A few-repetitions of such cipher trigraphs as RPE,, DRP,, TRPB,, would lead to the surmise that 
the latter are of the type where pseudo-repetitious elements have crept into the picture and there- 
8 Strictly speaking, of course, not really fortuitously. It. depends upon the exact letters which precede or 
follow the plain-text repetition and the exact positiors these letters occupy in the checkerboard.

fore the cryptanalyst 
should be very hesitant to assume that the adventitious prefixed letters 
nrc in the same columns, or that the adventitious suffixed letters are in the same row. 
In fact, 
he would bc warranted in tentatively 
assuming the very opposite condition, that they are not 
in the same columns or rows, respectively. 
The conclusions derivable from a stud>- of short 
repetitions can be carried over to the longer ones. Sate the following four cases from which

First, the i-letter 
cipher sequence H I W 0 T Q C is common to all four cases; if only the cipher 
text were available, one could conclude that the plain-text repetition consists of 8 letters. 
Second, 
the letters H and Y probably come from the same column in the checkerboard, but as for 0, P, 
and T, they may or may not come from the same column, most, probably not. 
(Actually. 0 and 
T do, but P does not come from the same column as these 2 letters.) 
Third, the letters H and E 
probably come from t.hc same row in the checkerboard, but as for V, C, and M, they may or may 
not come from the same row, most probably not. 
(Actually, all 3 letters come from different 
rows. ) 
k. Kate the following cases of encipherment: The fact that the 7-letter cipher sequence is

The pseudo-repetit,ious lett,ers, I in the third position in cases (1) and (2), and t,he letters 
Y, and U, in corresponding positions in cases (3) and (4) mean that I, U, and Y, come from the 
same column of the checkerboard. 
The I, in posit’ion 2, in cases (l), (3), and (4) and the D, 
in the corresponding position in case (2) indicates that I, and D, are probably in different columns 
in the checkerboard. 
In position 11, the H,, BC, and D, give indications of being in the same 
row of the checkerboard. 
In position 14, WC and Y, likewise give indications of coming from the 
same row, 
But note now that, from position 1, 3 it may he deduced that W, A. and T come from 
the same column of the checkerboard. 
These are examples of tlie type of detailed analysis 
that, the student should follow in his att’empt to solve a problem of t.his sort. 
1. In general it may be said that when the repet,itions are numerous and fairly lengthy, that 
is when there is a good deal of traffic all in the same checkerboard, and repetitions of tetragraphs 
and better are plrnt,iful, solution should be relatively easy. In fact, with a fairly large amount 
of traffic, most of the work involved would consist in listing the 2, 3, 4 . . . letter repetitions. 
Then a chart would be drawn up to show the associations which the prefixes make among thcm- 
selves and t.he associations which the sufiixes make among themselves. 
For example : 
XABQ 
NABR 
ZABT 
NABQ 
LAB1 
ZGT 
Here it is noted that L, N, X, and Z appear as prefixes to repetitions. 
The letter X is “found in 
company” wit,h N twice; the “association value” of X and N is 2 units. 
The association value of 
Z and N is, however, 4 units, for the N occurs twice and so does the Z. The association value of 
LX or LZ is 1 unit; that of LN or LZ, 2 units. 
Thus, the association value for each combination 
can be studied in all the repetitions and, of course, when the value is high for a given combina- 
tion it indicates that the two let,ters really belong together, or in the same column of t,he checker- 
board. 
m. What can be done with but, one or two relatively 
short cryptograms depends largely 
upon their lengths, the number of repetitions they happen to have, the exact construction of 
the checkerboard, and the ingenuity 
and patience of the cryptanalyst. 
Once the letters that 
constitute the columns and the rows of the checkerboard employed in the recomposition arc 
known, the proper assembling of the columns and rows is a relatively simple matter. 
If a key- 
word has been used as the basis for the distribution 
or mixing of the letters, naturally the recon- 
struction of the checkerboard is much facilitated. 
If not, then either the original or an equiv- 
alent checkerboard may be reconstructed. 
Having the recomposition checkerboard at hand, 
the determination as to whether it is the same as that used in the decomposition follows directly. 
If not the same, the reconstruction 
of the decomposition checkerboard is a relatively 
simple 
matter.

According to the principles elucidated in the preceding paragraph, it would seem that the 
following tentative deductions may be made from the data contained in the columns of figure 82: 
(1 j From column 1: E, D, R. P, X belong in the same column of the checkerboard. 
(2) From column 10: W, I, N belong in the same row. 
(3) From column 14: D and G belong in the same column. 
(4) From column 16: B and H belong in the same row. 
(5) From column 16: H and L belong in the same column. 
(6) From column 21: Y, K: N belong in the same column. 
(7) From column 25: G and B belong in the same row. 
(8) From column 27: I and T belong in the same column. 
(9) From column 33: I and W belong in the same row. 
(10) From column 36: C and D belong in the same row. 
(11) From column 37: W and Q belong in the same row. 
(12) From column 40: Q and V belong in the same row. 
It would be most fortunate and unusual for all these tentative deductions to be correct, for the 
disturbing 
effects of accidental adventitious 
repetit.ions have not been taken into account as 
yet. 
But let an attempt be made to assemble the data tlcduced thus far, to st’(’ if they (‘MI all 
be reconciled. 
d. Tentative deduction (1) indicates that E, D, R, P, and X belong in the same column of 
the rccomposition checkerboard. 
If correct, the complete set of 5 letters of one column is ut 
hand. 
But tentative deduction (3) indicates that D and G belong in the same column and this 
would mean that the column has 6 letters, which is impossible. 
Further evidence will be rtl- 
quired to corroborate the hypothesis that E, D, R, P, and X are all actually in the same column. 
or that D and G are actually in the same column. 
For this purpose, further study must bc mudc, 
and it is convenient to compile an “association table” showing how often certain letters arc 
associated among themselves as prefixes to the repetitions. 
A similar association table is muclt 
for the suffixes. 
The tables may be combined in a manner similar to that shown in figure P:(, 
where the prefixes to repetitions appear at the left of the central alphabet, the suffisrs to the 
right. 
Take column 1 of figure 82, having D, E, P, R, and X as prefixes to a long repetition. 
A stroktl 
is placed in the E, P, R, and X cells of row D; a stroke is placed in the P, R, and X cells of row E; 
a stroke is placed in the R and X cells of row P; and finally a stroke is placed in the X cell of row R. 
Again, take column 16 of figure 82, reading B H H H L. 
The B need not be considered, since it is 
not a prefix to the repetition 
beginning 
K I R X Y . . ., but the H and L may be considcrcd. 
In the L cell of row H t,hree strokes are inserted to indicate that H and L are associated that 
many times. 
Each time a datum is obtained, it is added to this table. 
Figure 83 shows the 
appearance of the table after all the data obtainable from the repetitions listed in subparagraph b 
have been inserted. 
From even this small amount of mat,erial a few deductions can br made. 
For example, it is seen that the B line of the table for prefixes shows 5 strokes at G and 3 strokt>s 
at W, from which it would appear that B, G, and W may be in the same column. 
The let tctrs 
C and L likewise seem to be in the same column, as do H and L, making C, H, and L appear to 
be in the same column. 
Studying the table of suffixes, it would appear that B and H are in the 
same row; I and N are in a row. 
After the entire text has been examined and the prefixes and 
suffixes distributed in this way, the whole table is studied carefully with a view to eliminating 
the effects of the accidental or pseudo-repetitious letters, trying to locate those letters which 
represent the prefixes and suffixes of true repetitions.

(5) 
T, U 
The presumption that Q, V, X, Y, and Z are all in the same roiv Icatls to the assunlption that 
the mixing of the checkerboard is based upon a key word or key phrase. Following up this 
hypothesis, the data are assembled in the following manner:

L 
Ni 
k-i---i-i--i-- 
,f. Only 6 letters remain to be placed in the checkerboard. 
But there are enough letters 
alrcady placed to warrant an immediate attempt at decipherment. 
For example, take the 
first few groups of message No . 2 and replace the letters by their bipartite equivalents:

Substituting 
by means of figure 84:

Obviously the decomposition and recomposition checkerboards are different. 
But, the recon- 
struction of the former is not at all difficult, since the text is now in monoalphabetic form. 
The 
message begins with a group showing a repeated letter in the first and third positions: is the 
1st word E N E M Y? Probably it is, for message xo. 1 also contains the sequence W I L T. 
.it any rate, a transcription 
of the cryptograms into the bifid equivalents given by the nearly 
complete recomposition checkerboard (fig. 84) soon yields sufficient monoalphabetic 
text to 
permit of the complete reconstruction of both checkerboards:

h. The two cryptograms may now be deciphered directly from the checkerboards.

48. Special solution.-u. 
The preceding example of solution constitutesthegeneralsolution 
for this system, since no special conditions are prerequisite to the procedure set forth. 
An 
interesting solution, however, is that wherein the same message has been ctiyptographed by two 
different sets of checkerboards. 
b. Suppose, for instance, that in this system two cryptograms of identical lengths and plain 
texts but different cryptographic 
texts are available for examination. 
They are superimposed 
and appear as follows:

c. Sow consider the first few superimposed letters in these two cryptograms: 
So. l~~~~~---~-~ G C 0 D M G C E G . . . 
So. 2----------- 
W I L T G S I H W . . . 
Ta.kr the pair of superimposed letters GW. The G is the cipher resultant of the recombination of 
two bipartite numerical components that apply to the recomposition checkerboard. 
The actual 
identities of these numerical components are not known, but, whatever they be, the first of 
them determines the first half of G,, the second determines the second half of G,. Therefore, for 
cryptanalytic 
purposes, the actual, but unknown, numerical components may be represented 
by the symbols G, and Gz, the former referring to the row coordinate of the recomposition checker- 
board, the latter to the column 
coordinate. 
Vi&at has been said of the letter G applies also to 
the letter W, the equivalent of G in another checkerboard. 
It will be found that this manner of 
designating bipartite 
components by means of subscripts to the letters themselves is a very 
useful method of handling the letters. 
d. Let the first few letters of the two cryptograms be replaced by these same cipher letters 
with their subscripts to indicate components. 
Thus:

Sow from the method of encipherment it is clear that CzGl and 12W, represent the same plain-text 
letter, since both messages are assumed to contain identical plain texts. 
That is, C,G, of crypto- 
gram So. 1 =IzW1 of cryptogram x0. 2. 
Likewise G2C1=W212; 
C201=12L1; 02D1=L2T1; and so on. 
P. Let all the component pairs of the cryptograms be equated in this manner and let these 
pairs be distributed in a table, such as that shown in figure 86. It will be seen in figure 86 that, 
for example, A& of cryptogram so. l=T,I, 
and T2N1 of cryptogram So. 2. i’his means that 
I, and N, must represent the same row coordinate of the recomposition checkerboard for crypto- 
gram Xo. 2; in other words I and N must be in the same row in that checkerboard. 
Again, in figure 
86. it is seen that CzG1=GzWl and D2W1, which means that G and D must be in the same column in 
that checkerboard. 
Again, A2S, =WsA1=S2C1; this means that A and C are in the same row, W 
and S, in the same column, in the recomposition checkerboard for cryptogram No. 2. All these 
data in figure 86 are studied with the following results: 
In same row: 
In same column: 
(1) I, 
N, L, W

An attempt is now 
board for message 
made to bring together these results to reconstruct the recomposition checkcr- 
So. 2. This yields the following:

Q Y? 
Compare this with the recomposition checkerboard shown in figure 85 (B). 
Enough has bern 
shown to illustrate the procedure. 
If there were just a little more test, probably all 25 letters 
of the checkerboard could be definitely placed. 
j. By making a reciprocal table for equivalencies between component pairs in crypt’ogram 
No. 2, the data obtained would permit of reconstructing 
the recomposition checkerboard foi 
cryptogram No. 1. Having t.hese checkerboards completely or at. least partially reconstructed, 
the reconstruction of the decomposition checkerboards is a relatively 
easy matter and follows 
the procedure described in paragraph 47j. 
g. The complete solution of the two cryptograms, including the decomposition and recom- 
position matrices, is as follows:

1‘. It is seen that, the principles elucidated permit of solving this fairly good cipher system 
without recourse to frequency studies and detailed, difficult analytical research. \Vhat can be 
done with complete messages of identical texts will give the student a clue to what might be done 
when fairly lengthy sequences of identical plain texts (but not complete messages) are available 
for study. 
Alessages with similar beginnings, or similar endings will afford data for such 
reconstruction. 
49. Periodic fractionating systems.--a. 
Another type of combined substitution-transposition 
system involving fractionation 
is that in which the processes involved are applied to groupings 
of fixed length, so that the system gives external evidence of pcriodicity. 
One such system, 
commonly attributed 
to the French cryptographer 
Delastelle, is exemplified below. 
Let the 
bipartite 
alphabet be based upon the 2%cell substitution 
checkerboard shown in figure 80. 
Let the message to be enciphered be ONE PLANE REPORTED LOST AT SEA. Let it also be 
assumed that by preagreement between correspondents, periods of 5 lette‘rs will constitute the 
units of encipherment. 
The bipartite equivalents of the plain-textiett’ers 
are set dbwn vertically 
below the letters.

Recombinaticns are effected horizontally

the first period yielding the pairs 41, 34, 42, 33, 31. These pairs are then replaced by letters

b. A different checkerboard may, of course, be employed for the recomposition process. 
Also, periods of any convenient length may be employed; or, in a complicated case, periods of 
varying lengths may be employed in the same cryptogram, according to some prearranged key. 
50. General principles underlying the solution.-u. 
It will be noted that the periods in the 
foregoing example contain an odd number of letters. 
The result of adopting odd-length periods 
is to impart a much greater degree of cryptographic security to the system than is the case when 
even-length periods are involved. 
This point is worth while elaborating upon to make its crypt- 
analytic significance perfectly clear. 
Note what happens when an even period is employed:

Sow if each &letter cipher group is split in the middle into two sections and the letters are taken 
alternntcly 
from each section (Ex. L H L R E A=L 
R H E L A) the results are esactlp the 
same as would be obtained in case a simple digraphic encipherment were 
to be employed with the 2-square checkerboard shown in figure 88. 
For example, ON,=LR,; EP,=HE,, and so on. 
Encipherment of this 
sort brings about a fixed relationship between the plain-text diprnphs 
and their cipher equivalents, so that the solution of R tncssagc~ of this 
type falls under the category of thr cr~~ptan;d~sis of 21 ~RSC of simplr 
digraphic substitution, 
once the length of the period has been estab- 
lished.3 The latter step can readily be accomplished, as will be seen 
presently. 
In brief, then, it may be said that in this system when 
encipherment is based upon even periods the cipher text is purely 
and simply digraphic in character, each plain-text 
digraph having 
one and only one cipher-text digraph as its equivalent.

b. But the latter statement is no longer true in the case of odd 
periods. 
;“;ote, in the example under paragraph 49a, that the cipher 
equivalent of the first plain-text 
digraph of the first group, ON, is 
composed of the initial 
and final components of the letter L,, the 
final component of the letter 0,, and the initial 
component of the 
letter L,.

involved in the composition of the cipher equivalent of one plain-text

c. The foregoing examples fall into two classes. In the first, where the 0 of ON, falls in an 
odd posit’ion in the period, the first letter of the trigraphic cipher equivalent must be an L,, the 
second must be one of the 5 letters in the second column of the substitution checkerboard, the 
third must be one of t,he 5 letters in the t,hird row of the checkerboard. 
Therefore, L, may 
combine with 5X5 or 25 pairs of letters to form t,he second and t’hird letters of the 3-letter equiva- 
lent of ON,. In the other class, where the 0 of ON, falls in an even position in the period, the 
first letter of the equivalent must be one of the 5 letters in the fourth column of the checkerboard, 
the second must be one of the 5 letters in the first row, and the third letter must be &. 
There- 
fore, R, may combine wit,h 5X5 or 25 pairs of letters to form the first and second letters’of the 
3-letter equivalent of ON, in this position in the period. 
Hence, ON, may be represented by 50 
trigraphic combinations; the same is true of all other plain-text digraphs. 
Now if the system 
based upon even periods is considered as a simple digraphic substitution, 
the foregoing remarks 
lead to characterizing the system based upon odd periods as a special type of digraphic sub- 
stitution with variants, in which 3 letters represent 2 plain-text letters.

d. However, further study of the odd-period system may show that there is no necessity for 
trying to handle it as a digraphic system with variants, which would be a rather complex affair. 
Perha.ps the matter can be simplified.

Now suppose that. only the cipher letters are at hand, and that tbe period is known. 
The first 
cipher letter is L, and it is composed of two numerical bifid components that come from the first’ 
and second positions in the upper row of components in the period. 
These components are not 
known, but whatever they are the first of. them is the first component of L, the second of them 
is the second component of L. 
Therefore, just as in paragraph 48c, the actual but unknown, 
numerical components may be represented by the symbols L1 and Lz, the former referring to the 
row coordinate of the substitution 
checkerboard, the latter to the column coordinate. 
The 
same thing may be done with the components of the second cipher letter, the third, fourth, and 
fifth, t.he respective components being placed into their proper positions in the period. 
Thus:

By comparing the two diagrams it becomes obvious that Ll, Hz, and Ol all represent the co0rdinat.e 
4; Hl, El, Ez, and B1 all represent the coordinate 3, and so on. If this equivalency were known 
for all the 50 combinations of the 25 letters with subscript 1 or 2 there would be no problem, 
for the text of a cryptogram could be reduced to 25 pairs of digits representing monoalphabetic 
encipherment. 
But this equivalency is not known in the case of a cryptogram that is to be 
solved; basically the problem is to establish the equivalency. 
e. It is obvious that the vertical pair of components L 
02 represents O,, the vertical pair,; 
1 
represents N,, and so on. 
The complete example therefore becomes:

j. Note that a plain-text letter in an odd position in the period has its components in the order 
el@,; in an even position in the period the components of a plain-text letter are in the order 8&. 
For example, note the 0, in the first period 
and the 0, in the third period 
* This 
distinction 
must be retained since the component indicators for rows and columns are not inter- 
changeable in &is system. 
From this it follows that the vertical pairs of components represent-

ing a given plain-text letter are of two classes: 0102 and &el, and the two must be kept separate 
in cryptanalysis. 
g. Sow consider the equivalent of 0, in the first period. 
It is composed of z’ 
This is 
2 
only one of a number of equivalents for 0, in an odd position in the period. 
The row of the sub- 
stitution 
checkerboard indicated by L, may be represented hp 4 other components. sinrc that 
row contains 5 letters. 
8, 
Therefore the upper cornponc~nt of thca F) cquivnlc~nt of 0, rn,ly h13 ;:ny 
one of 5 letters. 
The same is true of tbc loat~r c*omponent. Henle, 0, in an odd position in the 
period may be represented by any one of 5X5=25 
combinations of vertical components in the 
sequence e1+e2. 
0, in an even posit,ion in the period may be represented by any one of a, similar 
number of combinations of vertical components in the reverse sequence, ez-Jel. 
Thus, dis- 
regarding the position in the period, this system may be described as a monoalphabetic sub- 
stitution with variant,s, in which every plain-text letter may be represented by any one of 50 
different component-pairs. 
But in studying an actual cryptogram in this system, since the 
position (odd or even) occupied by a cipher letter in the period is obvious after t,he length of the 
period has been established, a proper segregation of the cipher letters will permit of handling the 
cipher letters in the two classes referred to above, in which case one has to deal with only 25 
variants for each plain-text letter. 
Obviously, the 25 variants are related to one another by 
virtue of their having been produced from a single enciphering matrix of but 25 letters. 
This 
relationship can be used to good advantage in reconstructing the matrix in the course’ of the 
solution and the relationship will be discussed in its proper place. 
h. Now if the foregoing encipherment is studied intently several important phenomena may 
be observed. 
Note, for i.nstanc.e, how many times either the e1 or the e2 component coincides 
with the plain-text letter of which it is a part. 
In the very first period the 0, has an O2 under it; 
in the same period the E, has an Ez under it. 
The same phenomenon is observed in columns 
3 and 5 of the second period, in column 3 of the third period, and in column 1 of the fifth period. 
In column 5 of the third, fourth, and fifth periods the el component’s coincide with the respec- 
tive plain-text letters involved. 
There are, in this short example, 9 cases of this sort, giving 
rise to instances of what seems to be a sort of self-encipherment of plain-text letters. 
How does 
this come about? 
And is it an accident that all these cases involve plain-text 
letters in odd 
positions in the periods? 
i. If the periods in the foregoing example in subparagraph e are studied closely, the following 
observations may be made. 
Because of the mechanics of encipherment in this system the first 
cipher letter and the fist plain-text letter in each period must come from the same row in the 
substitution checkerboard. 
Since there are only 5 letters in a row in the checkerboard the proba- 
bility that the two letters referred to will be identical is l/5. 
(The identity will occur every time 
that the coordinate of the row in which the second plain-text letter stands in the checkerboard is 
the same as the coordinate of the column in which tbe first plain-text letter stands.) The same 
general remark applies to the second cipher letter and the third plain-text letter; as well as to 
the third cipher letter and the fifth plain-text 
letter: In these cases the two letters must come 
from the same row in the checkerboard and the probability 
that they will be identical is likewise 
l/5. 
(The identity in the former case will occur every time that the coordinate of the row in 
which the fourth plain-text letter stands in the checkerboard is the same as that of the column 
in which the third plain-text letter stands; in the latter case the identity will occur every time 
that the coordinate of the column in which the fu& plain-text letter stands is the same as that 
of the column in which the fifth plain-text letter stands.) 
The last of the foregoing sources of 
identity 
is exemplified in only 4 of the 9 cases mentioned in subparagraph h above. 
These

164 
involve the fifth plain-text letter in the third, fourth, and fifth periods. and the first letter in the 
fifth period, wherein it will be noted that the 8, component standing directly under the plain- 
text letter is identical with the latter in ea.& case. 
j. But how are the other 5 cases of identity 
brought about? 
Snnl-sis along the same 
lines as indicated above will be omitted. 
It will be sufficient to observe that in each of those 
cases it is the & component which is identical with the plain-text letter involved. and again the 
probability 
of the occurr’ence of the phenomenon in question is l/5. 
k. Since the probability 
of the occurrence of the event in question is 115 for Q1 components 
and l/5 for & components, the total probability 
from either source of identity 
is 2,‘5. This 
probability 
applies only to the letters occupying odd positions in the period, and it may be said 
that in 40 percent of all cases of letters in odd positions in the periods the one or the other of the 
two cipher components will be identical with the plain-t,est letter. 
1. As regards the plain-text letters in even positions, analysis will show why only in a very 
few cases will either of the cipher components coincide with the plain-test letter to which they 
apply, for the method of finding equivalents in the substitution 
checkerboard is to take the 
first component as the row coordinate indicator and the second component as the column indi- 
cator; a reversal of this order will give wholly different letters, except in those 5 cases in which 
both components are identical. 
(The letters involved are those which occupy the 5 cells along 
the diagonal from the upper left-hand corner to the lower right-hand corner of the checkerboard.) 
Now in every case of a letter in an odd position in a period the two vertical components are in 
the ele2 order, corresponding to the order in which they are normally taken in finding letter 
equivalents in the checkerboard. 
But in every case of a letter in an even position in a period, 
the two vertical components are in the order e2Ell, which is a reversal of the normal order. 
It 
has been seen that in the case of letters in odd positions in the periods the probability 
t’hat one 
of the components will coincide with the plain-text letter is 40 percent. The reasoning which led 
to this determinat.ion in the case of the odd letters is exactly the same as that in the case of letters 
in even positions, except that in the final recomposition process, since the components in the 
even positions are in the e&, order, which is the reverse of the normal order, identity between 
one of the components and the plain-text letter can occur in only l/5 of the 40 = 8 percent of 
the cases. It, may be said then that, in this system 48 percent’ of all the letters of the plain text 
will be “self-enciphered” 
and represented by one or the other of the two components; in the 
case of the letters in odd positions, the amount is 40 percent, in the case of letters in even posi- 
tions, it is 8 percent. 
m. Finally, what of the peculiar phenomenon to be observed in the case of the first column 
of the fifth period of the example in subparagraph e ? Here is a case wherein the plain-text 
value of a pair of superimposed components is unmistakably 
indicated directly by the cipher 
components themselves. 
Studying 
the cipher group concerned it is noted that it contains 
2 AC’s separated by one letter, that is, the A’s are 2 intervals apart. 
This situation is as though 
the plain-text 
letter were entirely self-enciphered in this case. Now it is obvious that this 
phenomenon will occur in the case of periods of 5 letters every time that within a period a cipher 
letter is repeated at an interval of 2, for this will bring about the superimposition of a el and e2 
with the same principal let’ter and therefore the pl8iIbteXt 
lett,er is indicated directly. 
Tbis 
question may be pertinent: HOW many times may this be expected to happen? 
Analysis along 
the lines already indicated will soon bring the answer that the phenomenon in question may be 
expected to happen 4 times out of 100 in the case of letters in odd positions and only 8 times out 
of 1,000 in the case of letters in even positions. 
In the latter cases the letters involved are those 
falling in the diagonal sloping from left to right in the substitution matrix.

R. Ul of the foregoing phenomena will be useful when the solution of an example is under- 
taken. 
But before coming to such an example it is necessary to explain how to asctbrtain the 
period of a cryptogram to be solved. 
51. Ascertaining 
the length of the periods--a. There are several methods available for 
ascertaining the length of the period. 
The simplest, of course, is to look for repetitions of the 
ordinary sort. 
If the period is a short one, say 3, 5, 7 letters, and if the message is fa.irly long, the 
chances are good that a. polygraph which occltrs several times within the messagr will fall in 
homologous positions within two different periods and therefore will be identically 
cnciphercJt1 
both times. 
There will not be many such repetitions, it is true, but factoring the intervals 
between such as do occur will at least give some clue, if it will not actually disclose the length of 
the period. 
For example? suppose that a 7-letter repetition is found, the two occurrences being 
separated by an interval of 119. The factors of 119 are 7 and 17; the latter is unlikely to be the 
length of the period, the former, quite likely. 
b. If a polygraph is repeated but its two occurrences do not fall in homologous positions in 
two periods, there will still be manifestat,ions of the presence of repetition but the repeated letters 
will be separated by one or more intervals in the periods involved. 
The number of repeated 
letters will be a function of the length of the polygraph and the length of the period; the interval 
between the letters constituting 
the repetition will be a function of the length of the period and 
the position of the repeated polygraph in two periods in which the t,wo polygraphs occur.

Here the plain text contains the trigraph END 4 times. 
The END, in the first period gives rise to

letters

this 
trigraph 
also produces

. N. 
.E. 
The interval between the N, and the E, is 3 in both cases. Two times this 
interval plus one gives the length of the period. 
In this case the initial let,ter of the repeated 
trigrnph falls in an even position in t,he period in both occurrences. 
The END, in the third period 
1234507’ 
gives rise to the cipher letters 
. . B . . . D; in the fourth 
period it’ also produces 
1 
234567 
.B.. 
.D: 
The interval between the B, and the D, is 4 in bot’h cases. Two times this 
interval minus one gives the length of the period. 
In this case the initial let’ter of the repeated 
trigraph falls in an odd position in the period in both occurrences. 
e. The foregoing properties of repetit,ions in t,his system afford a means of ascertaining the 
length of the period in an unknown example. 
First, it is evident that a repeated trigraph in the 
plain text produces two different pairs of cipher equivalents according to whether the initial 
letter of the trigraph occurs in an odd or an even position in the period. 
The two letters con- 
st.ituting the repetition in the cryptogram will not be sequent but will be separated by an interval 
of 1, 2, 3, . . . letters depending upon the length of the period. 
This interval, however, is half 
of the period plus or minus one.’ 
Conversely, if in a cryptogram there are repetitions of pairs of 
4 The student must remember that the text is here concerned only with cases in which the period is odd. 
In the case of even periods the interval 
separating the 2 letters is always exactly half of the length of the period.

letters separated hy an interval r, it is probable t.hat these repetitions represent repetitions of 
plain-text trigraphs which occupy homologous positions in the period. 
The interval r (between 
the letters constituting 
the repetition in the cipher test) then gives a good clue to the length of 
the period: p(length of period) =2rf 
1. 
d. A special kind of index is prepared to facilitate the search for repetitions of the nature 
indicated. 
If tabulating machinery is available, an alphabetically 
arranged indcs showing say 
10 succeeding letters after each A,, B,, C,, . . . Z, is prepared for the cryptogram. 
Then this 
index is studied to see how many coincidences occur at various intervals under each letter. 
For 
example, under A, one looks to set if there are 2 or more cases in which the same letter appears 
2, 3, 4, . . . intervals to t,he right of A, a record being kept of the number of such cases under 
each interval. 
The same thing is done with reference to B,, C,, and so on. 
The tallies represtbnt- 
ing coincidences may be amalgamated for all the letters A, B, C, . . . Z, only t’he intervals being 
kept segregated. When tabulating machinery is not available, the search for repetitions may be 
made by transcribing the cryptogram on two long strips of cross-section paper, juxtaposing the 
strips at A, B, C, . . . Z, and noting the coincidences occurring 1, 2, 3, . . . up to say 10 letters 
beyond the juxtaposed letters. 
For example, beginning with A,, t’he two strips are juxtaposed 
with the first A on one against the first A on the other. 
Xote is made of any coincidcncrs found 
wit,hin 10 letters beyond the A’s, and a record is kept of such coincidences according to intervals. 
Keeping one strip in position the other is slid along to t,he second A, and again coincidences are 
sought. 
All the A’s are treated in this way, then the B’s, C’s . . . Z’s. The record made of tile 
coincidences may consist merely of a tally stroke written under the intervals 1, 2, 3, . . . 10. 
That interval which occurs more frequently than all the others is probably the correct one. This 
interval times 2, plus or minus 1 is the length of the period. 
There are, therefore, only two altcr- 
natives. 
A choice between the two alternatives may then be made by transcribing the test or 
a portion of it according to each hypothesis. 
That transcription 
which will most’ oft,en throw 
the two members constituting 
a repetition into one and the same period is most likely to be 
correct. 
e. Finally, for ascertaining the period there is one method which is perhaps tllc most lnhori- 
ous but surest. 
It has been pointed out that this system reduces to one t.hat may be described 
as monoalphabetic substitution 
with variants. 
If the cipher text is transcribed into e1 and & 
components according to various assumed periods, and then a frequency distribution 
is made of 
the pairs of vertical components for each hypothesis, that period which gives the best approsi- 
mation to the sort of distribution 
to be expected for a system of monoalphabetic substitution 
with 25 variants for each letter may be taken to be correct. 
For in the case of an incorrect period 
the resultant vertical bipartite 
components are not the equivalents of the actual plain-test 
letters; hence such repetitions as occur are purely accidental and the number of such cases would 
be rather small. 
But in the case of the correct period the resultant vertical pairs of components 
are the equivalents of the actual plain-text letters; hence repetitions are causal and fairly frcl- 
quent. 
Were it not for variants, of course, the distribution 
would be perfectly monoalphabetic.

b. The long repetitions noted in the text (intervals=210 
and 35) indicate a period of either 
5 or 7. By transcribing several lines of test into their 0, and e2 components according to both 
of these alternatives and distributing 
the vertically 
superimposed pairs, it is soon found that a 
period of 7 produces many more repetitions than does a period of 5. The entire text is then 
transcribed into its 8, and e2 components according to a period of 7 (see fig. 89) and complete 
distributions 
of f3162 and e2e1 vertical pairs are made, the distributions 
being, of course, kept 
separate. 
They are shown in figures 90 and 91. The individual 
distributions 
show many 
repetitions and the distributions 
as a whole are very favorable for a period of 7.

c. The test now being transcribed into periods of 7, with the e1 and 8 components indicated 
by the cipher letters in each period, the vertical pairs of components are csamined to locate 
cases in which the basic letters of the e1 and e2 superimposed components are identical, where- 
upon the plain-text 
letters indicated are at once inserted into position. 
In this example 10 
such cases are found, one each in periods 14, 22, 26, 35, 36. 52, 59, 68: and two in period i4. 
All of these, of course, involre letters in odd positions in the periods. 
The plani-test letters 
thus inserted may serl-e as clues for assuming probable wortls. 
d. Sow if only a few equivalencies can be established betucvvl a ftsw of the 8, components, 
or between a few of the e2 components, or between a few 8, and eL components, a long step for- 
ward may be taken in the solution. 
Perhaps some information 
can be found by studying 
figures 90 and 91. A consideration of figure 90 will soon lead to thcb itlca that each row- of frc- 
quencies can indicate only 5 different plain-text letters, one of which coincides with the indicating 
letter at the left of the row. 
Moreover, in this same figure, ahilc there are 25 rows in all, there 
are really only 5 different categories 
of rows, each category corresponding to a row in the 
substitution checkerboard. 
e. To explain quite clearly what is meant and how the principle can be employed in this case, 
assume that figure 90, instead of applying to an unknown checkerboard, applied to a known 
one, say that show-n in figure 87. The bipartite coordinates and the letters which would occupy 
the cells are as seen in figure 92:

Kow consider the A row and the F row. 
The 25 letters in both rows of cells are, from the very 
nature of the system, identical in their sequence and there are only 5 difl’ercnt letters involved, 
each appearing 5 times. 
Therefore it would seem that frequency distributions corresponding to 
these rows should show definite charscteristics by means of which they could be compared 
statistically. 
Furthermore, 
the e1 coordinates applying to these two rows, Al and F1, indicate 
that A and F are in the same row in the checkerboard. 
What has been said of the A and F rows 
also applies to the M, N, and U rows, for the letters A, F, M, N, and U are all in the same row in the 
checkerboard (fig. 87). 
Perhaps a statistical test can be applied to ascertain u-hich rows of 
distributions 
in figure 90 are similar and this in turn may give clues to the letters which fall in 
the same row in the checkerboard applicable to the problem in hand. 
j. Again, consider the columns in figure 90. What has been said of the rows applies equally 
to the columns, and therefore the same sort of test may also be applied to the columns of figure 
90 for clues as to the composition of the columns of the checkerboard applicable to the problem 
under consideration. 
If there were sufficient test much of the labor of solving such cases would 
be reduced to a matter of statistical analysis. 
But what sort of statistical test should be used? 
Obviously it should be one based upon “matching” 
the distributions of figure 90, but specifically 
what should it be? Kate the distributions 
in rows D and M; they appear to be similar. 
Is it 
correct to apply the usual x-test for matching two frequency distributions? 
Consider the com- 
position of the rows of figure 90, and specifically consider the A and F rows, composed as follows: 
A __________________ 
A M M A N F F U U F M M N A N U N F A U M A N U F 
F . _ . . . _ _ . _ . . . . . . . . . AMMANFFUUFMMNANUNFAUMAKUF 
Here the letters in opposite cells are identical and there are only 5 different letters involved: 
A, M, N, F, and U. Of these only 3 are high-frequency letters in normal plain text; 2 are of medium 
to low frequency. 
But the high-frequency letters in the A row match those in the F row, the 
low.frequency letters in the A row also ma.tch the low-frequency letters in the F row. 
Hence, 
if frequency distributions 
corresponding to these rou-s are tested statistically, 
they should yield 
a fairly high index of coincidence. 
But should the constant .0667 (probability 
of monographic 
coincidence in normal English text) beused in the test? 
Obviously not, for this constant is derived 
from statistics based upon the normal frequencies of all 26 letters of the alphabet, whereas here 
only 5 letters are involved and the exact 5 involved in any example is determined by the compo- 
sition of the checkerboard. 
Again, consider the A and C rows of figure 90, composed as follows: 
A. -. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ AMMANFFUUFMMNANUNFAUMANUF 
C ________________ 
T C C T R G G I I G C C R T R I R G T I C T R I G 
Here is a case where, by chance, high-frequency letters stand opposite high-frequency letters 
(A and T, N and R); medium-frequency letters stand opposite medium-frequency letters (M and 
C, F and G). 
The only case of fairly ma.rked difference is in that of the pairing of U and I. 
Hence, a statistical matching of frequency distributions 
applying to these two rows u-ould be 
apt to yield a high index of coincidence. 
Yet, these two rows do not belong t,ogether and to 
assume that the letters A and C belong in the same row in the checkerboard would block or at 
least retard solution. 
In spite of the foregoing reasoning, there nevertheless remains the feeling 
that a statistical matching of the rows should be possible or should at least offer some clues as 
to the composition of the checkerboard. 
g. In applying the usual x-test for matching two distributions use is made of the important 
constant .0667, the probability 
of monographic coincidence for normal English text. 
This 
constant may be modified to meet the special conditions of the present problem. 
If it be assumed 
that the mixing of the letters in the checkerboard is fairly good, in normal cases it may be assumed

that there will be 1 high-frequency 
letter, 3 medium-frequency 
letters, and 1 low-frequency 
letter in each row and in each column of the checkerboard. 
Suppose the letters in each category 
be as follows:

A E 1 N 0 R S T 
Medium frequency ________________

Low frequency ____________________________________

times, and it is assumed that each row of the checkerboard contains 2 high-frequency letters, 2 
medium-frequency letters, and 1 low-frequency letter, the rows in figure 90 will be composed of 
10 high-frequency letters, 10 medium-frequency letters, and 5 low-frequency letters. 
Therefore, 
the sum of the squares of the average probabilities of the letters occurring in each row of figure 
90 is as follows: 
5X.0072=.0360 
15X.0008=.0120 
5x.00007=.0004 
Total = .0484 
This, then, is the constant that should be applied in the x-test for the problem under consider- 
ation. 
Suppose, for convenience, the approximation .05 is used. This is considerably less than 
the normal constant .0667 and means that in the case of this problem two distributions 
can be 
considered to “match” 
even if the number of coincidences (value of x) is considerably less than 
what would be expected in the case of the normal type of frequency distribution. 
However, it 
must be remembered that even if two distributions 
give an observed value for x that is close to 
or even greater than the expected, one can still not be certain that the two distributions 
apply to 
identical rows of lett,ers and indicate two letters in the same row in the checkerboard, since it 
may happen tha,t the composition of the checkerboard is such that two rows have letters of about 
the same frequency values, as pointed out above. 
h. With this reservation in mind, let figure 90 be examined. 
Take rows D and M, which on 
casual examination look a good deal alike, as seen in figure 93.

Applying the x-test, the observed value of x=34, the expected value is .05 (23X16)= 18. An 
excellent match is obtained, and the hypothesis that D and M are in the same row in the checker- 
board seems promising. 
Can any confirmation be found in the cryptogram itself? 
i. It has already been pointed out that this system reduces to monoalphabetic substitution 
with variants. 
This being the case it should be possible to find manifestations of equivalency 
between some of the variant forms of 01 
8 vcrticalpnirsin 
thecryptogram. 
If the student will think 
2 
over the matter he will quickly see that this manifestation of equivalency is but a reflection of 
the principle elucidated in paragraph 46, expressed in a little different way. 
In other words, 
establishing equivalence between two 8, components means that the two base letters involved 
belong in the same row of the checkerboard ; establishing equivalence betweeen two e2 compo- 
nents means that the two base letters involved belong in the same column of the checkerboard. 
Note the following instances of apparent equivalency between D1 and M,:

From the foregoing calculations it appears that A1 may be simiiar to the D, and the Ml distribu- 
tions, for the observed values, while not as great as expected for plain text, are higher than those 
expected for random text. 
Perhaps more conclusive evidence may be found if a search were 
made through the text to see if any equivalences between A,, D,, and M,, appear.

Note how Ml, A,, E,, D,, and S, all appear to be interchangeable. 
Are these the 5 letters which 
belong in the same row ? The probable equivalence among A,, D,, and M, has been established by 
noting cases of equivalency in the text. 
A further search will be made to see if E, and S, also 
show equivalencies with A,, D,, and Ml.

Here are indications that E, belongs to the same series, but not enough cases where S1 is inter- 
changeable with A, D, E, or M can be found to be convincing. 
But perhaps it is best not to go 
too fast in these early stages. Let it be assumed for the present that A, D, E, and M are in the 
same row of the substitution 
checkerboard. 
In period 16 there is the pair of vertical com- 
ponents D, E2. Since D1=EI this pair may be written E,E2, whereupon the plain-text letter E is 
immediately indicated. 
All cases of this sort are sought in the text and the plain-text letters 
are inserted in their proper places, there being 7 such instances in all, but these yield the im- 
portant letters, A, D, and E. 
k. In a similar manner, by an intensive search for cases in which components appear to be 
equivalent because they occur in repetitions which are identical save for one or two components, 
it is established that C, 0, M, and W are in the same column in the checkerboard. 
Note the bracket- 
ing of these letters occurring as G2 components in the 4th column of the first list of sequences 
in subparagraph j. 
Likewise, B, H, and N are established as being in the same row. 
Again 
the text is examined for cases in which plain-text letters C, 0, M, W, B, H, and N may be inserted. 
By carrying out this process to the full extent possible, the skeletons of words will soon begin 
to appear. 
1. Enough has been demonstrated to show this line of attack. 
Of course, if there is a large 
volume of text at hand, the simplest procedure would be to construct frequency distributions 
of the types shown in figures 90 and 91, and use the statistical method to match the individual 
distributions. 
For this method to be reliable it would be necessary to have several hundred 
letters of text, but this in actual practice would not be too much to expect. 
m. There is, however, another line of attack, based upon the probable-word method. 
It 
has been pointed out that, in the case of letters in odd positions in the periods, 40 percent of the 
time the plain-text letter involved is indicated by either its 8, or O2 component. 
This property 
affords a fair basis for assuming a probable word. 
For example, the cryptogram here studied 
shows the following two periods:

This word, if correct, yields the following equivalencies: Ht=X2=Ol;S1=02; 
T1=S2; Ll=T2; 12= 
L2=E,; X,=E2. 
Again the text is examined for cases in which the plain-text 
letters may now be 
directly inserted; but only one case is found, in period 44, where I, L2=Il 12=Ip. 
This is un- 
fortunate, 
so that additional 
words will have to be assumed. The 14th period shows a C, 
and the components after it suggest that the word CROSSROADS may be present.

A study of the equivalencies indicates that- 
(1) A, D, E, M belong in the same row. 
(2) B, H, N belong in the same row. 
(3) G, R, S, Q belong in the same row. 
(4) R, C, 0, M, W belong in the same column. 
(5) I, L, A, Q belong in the same column. 
(6) X, H, G belong in the same column. 
(7) The coordinates of R and A are identical and hence this letter occupies a cell along 
a diagonal sloping from left to right in the matrix. 
o. Since a row or a column can contain only 5 letters, it is obvious that A, D, E, M; B, H, N; 
and G, R, Q, S, fall in 3 Merent 
rows; C, 0, M, W, R and I, L, A, Q fall in different columns. 
A 
start may be made by an arbitrary placement of R in the position l-l, and since R1=01=C2=

M2=W2, this means that R, 0, C, M, and W form one column in t,he substitution 
checkerboard, as 
shown in figure 95-A. 
The data also indicate that R, G, Q, and S must be in row 1, A, D, and E

must be in row 4, H and X must be in column 3. This means that 0, for A, D, and E must be 4, 
and that OS for H and X must be 3. And since MI=12=L2, G2 for I and L must be 4. Substitut- 
ing in the test the coordinates for the known values, additional plain-text words soon become 
evident. 
For example, taking the periods with the word HOSTILE, it becomes possible to insert

the letters R, and 0, as the second and fourth letters after E,, suggesting that the word after 
HOSTILE is TROOP. Thisgives W, X2=Tp, which permits of placing T in position 5-3. 
Since T in 
HOSTILE=& 
Li, therefore S2=5 and L1=3. 
Since S is in row 1, and Z&=5, S must go in position 
l-5. 
Since Lz=4 and L,=3, L must go in position 34. 
Since 0, (the 1st 0 in TROOP)=X,R2 
and it is known that Op=3-1, therefore X must be in position 3-3. 
The checkerboard is now as 
shown in figure 95-B. 
From figure 94, XI=E2.

it is evident that E must occupy 
cell 4-3, as seen in figure 95-C. 
There are now only 2 possible 
rows for H, either 1 or 2. It is deemed unnecessary to give further details of the process. Suffice 
it to say that in a few minutes the entire checkerboard is found to be as shown in figure 95-D. 
It will decipher the entire cryptogram as it stands, but speculating upon the presence of W U T V Z 
in the last row, and assuming a key-word mixed sequence has brought this about, a rearrange- 
ment of the columns of the checkerboard is made to give T U V W Z, as shown in figure 95-E. 
The arrangement of t,he rows now becomes quite evident and the original checkerboard is found 
to be as shown in figure 95-F. 
It seems to be based upon the key phrase XYLOPHONIC BEDLAM.

Q. The steps taken in recovering the original substitution 
checkerboard demonstrate that 
cyclic permutations of a correct checkerboard will serve to decipher such a cryptogram just as 
well as the original checkerboard, 
In other words, a cryptogram prepared according to this 
method is decipherable by factorial 5 (5X4X3X2X1=120) 
checkerboards, all of which are 
cyclically 
equivalent. 
Even though the identities of the components will be different if the 
same message is enciphered by two different cyclically-equivalent 
checkerboards, when these 
components are recombined, they will yield identical cipher texts, and therefore so far es external 
appearances are concerned different checkerboards yield identical cryptograms. 
The reason

181 
that there are only factorial 5 cyclically-equivalent 
checkerboards and not factorial 10, is that 
whatever permutation is applied to the row coordinates must be the same as that applied to the 
column coordinates in order that the aforesaid relationship hold true. 
If two checkerboards 
have identical row coordinates but different column coordinates certain portions of the crypto- 
graphic test w-ill decipher correctly, others incorrectly. 
For this reason, in working with cryp- 
tograms of this type the cryptanalyst 
may successfully use a checkerboard which is incorrect in 
part, and correct it as he progresses with the solution. 
It may also be added that the actunl 
permutation of digits applied to the side and top of the checkerboard is of no consequence, so 
long as the permutations are identical. 
In other words, the permutation 
5-2-1-3-4 
will work 
just as well as 3-24-l-5, 
or l-2-34-5, 
etc., so long as the same permutation is used for both 
row and column coordinates. 
It is the order of the rows and columns in the checkerboard 
Rhich is the determining element in this system. 
Any arrangement (of the letters within the 
checkerboard) which retains the original order as regards the letters within rows and columns 
will work just as well as the original checkerboard. 
f. A final remark may be worth adding. 
After all, the security of cryptograms enciphered 
by the bifid fractionating 
method rests upon the secrecy inherent in a 25-tell matrix containing 
a single mixed alphabet. 
In ordinary substitution, a single mixed alphabet hardly provides any 
security at all. 
Why does the bifid system, which also uses only a single mixed alphabet, yield 
so much higher a degree of security ? Is it because of the transpositional 
features involved? 
Thinking about this point gives a negative answer, for after all, finding the length of the periods 
and replacing the cryptographic text by components based upon the cipher letters is a relatively 
easy matter. 
The transpositional 
features are really insignificant. 
Ko, the answer to the 
question lies in a different direction and may be summed up about as follows. 
In solving a 
simple mixed-alphabet substitution cipher one can attack a few cipher letters (the ones of greatest 
frequency) and find their equivalents, yielding fragment’s of good plain text here and there in 
the cipher text. 
Once a few values have been established in this manner, say 6 values, the 
remaining 20 values can be found almost from the context alone. 
And in establishing these 6 
values, the letters involved are not so interrelated that all 6 have to be ascertained simultane- 
ously. 
The cryptanalyst 
may establish the values one at a time. 
But in the case of the bifid system 
the equivalents of the plain-text 
letters are so interrelated 
that the cryptanalyst 
is forced to 
assume or establish the positions of several letters in the checkerboard simultaneously, 
not one 
by one. In other words, to use an analogy which may be only partially justified, the solution 
of a simple monoalphabetic substitution 
cipher is somewhat like forcing one’s way into an inner 
chamber which has a number of doors each having a single lock; the solution of a bifld fraction- 
ated cipher is somewhat like getting into a vaultthere 
is only one door which is provided with 
a complex 5-combination lock and all the tumblers of the lock must be positioned correctly 
simultaneously 
before the releasing lever can drop into the slot and the door opened. Funda- 
mentally, this principle is responsible for the very much greater security of the bifid system as 
compared with that afforded by the simple monoalphabetic system. 
It is a principle well worth 
remembering and speculating upon. 
53. Special solutions for bifid systems-o. 
The security of the bifid system is very con- 
siderably reduced if the situation in which it is employed happens to be such that two or more 
messages with identical beginnings, endings, or internal portions can often be expected to occur. 
For in this case it is possible to establish equivslencies between components and quickly recon- 
struct the substitution 
checkerboard. 
An example will be given to illustrate 
the steps in a 
speci& case. 
b. Here are two cryptograms transmitted 
by two coordinate units to a superior head- 
quarters at about the same time. 
They show certain identities, which have been underlined.

c. Apparently these two cryptograms contain almost identical tests. 
In order to bring the 
identities into the form of superimposed components, it is necessary to transcribe the texts into 
periods of i and to superimpose the two messages as shown in figure 96. 
d. The shifting of the second cryptogram 2 intervals to the right brings about the superim- 
position of the majority of 8, and G2 components and it may be assumed that for the most part, 
the texts are identical. 
Allowing for slight differences at the beginnings and ends of the two 
messages, suppose a table of equivalencies is drawn up, beginning with the eighth superimposed 
N1 
pairs. 
Thus, Q2= D,, 
N2* hence N,=N, and Q2=DI. 
N2 
h 
B =D ; hence N,=H, and B1=D2. Going through 
the text in this manner and terminating with the 4id siperimposed pairs, the results are tabulated 
as shown in figure 97. 
e. From these equivalencies it is possible to reconstruct, if not the complete substitution 
matrix, then at leest a portion of the matrix. 
For example, the data show that N, H, B, and I 
belong in the same row; E and F belong in the same row, * N, D, U, Y, and K belong in the same 
column, and so on. 
Experimentation 
to make all the data fit one checkerboard would sooner or 
later result in reconstructing the checkerboard shown in figure 95-F, and the two messages read 
as follows: 
1. SEVENTH INFANTRY IN POSITION TO ATTACK AT FOUR AM PLAN FOUR. 
2. TENTH INFANTRY IN POSITION TO ATTACK AT FOUR AM PLAN THREEX. 
f. The foregoing gives a clue to what would happen in the case of an extensive traffic in 
which long phrases or entire sentences may be expected to occur repeat’edly. 
By a proper 
indexing of all the mat,erial, identical sequences would be uncovered and these, attacked along 
the lines indicated, would soon result in reconstructing 
the checkerboard, whereupon all the 
messages may be read with ease. 
54. Solution of trifid systems.--a. 
In the t&d 
fractionating 
system the cipher alphabet is 
tripartite 
in nature, that is, the plain-text 
letters are represented by permutations of 3 com- 
ponents taken in groups of 3’s, thus forming a set of 27 equivalents, such as that shown below: 
A=111 
S=112 
c=113 
D=121 
*122 
F=123 
G=131 
H=132 
I=133 
J=211 
K=212 
L=213 
M=22 1 
N=222 
0=223 
P=231 
Q=232 
R=233 
s=311 
T=312 
u=313 
V=32 1 
W=322 
X=323 
Y=331 
Z=332 
?=333 
b. The equivalents may, of course, be arranged in a mixed order, and it is possible to use one 
tripartite 
alphabet for decomposition and a wholly different one for recomposition. 
One dis- 
advantage of such an alphabet is that it is a 27-element alphabet and therefore some subterfuge 
must be adopted as regards the 27th element, such as that illustrated in the footnote to paragraph 
57 of Special Text No. 166, Advanced M&tmy 
cryptography, 
wherein ZA stands for Z and ZB 
for the 27th character.

c. The various types of fractionation 
possible in bifid systems are also adaptable in trifid 
systems. 
For example, using the alphabet shown above for recomposition as well as dccom- 
position the encipherment of a message in periods of 7 is as follows:

d. The solution of a single cryptogram of this nature would be a quite difficult matter, espe- 
cially if there were nothing upon which to make assumptions for probable words. 
But a whole 
series of cryptograms could be solved, following in general the procedure outlined in the case of 
the bifid system, although the solution is, admittedly, much more complicated. 
The first step 
is to ascertain the length of the period, and u-hen this has been done, transcribe the cipher text 
into components, which in their vertical combinations then represent monoalphabetic equiva- 
lents, with, of course, many variants for each letter of the plain text. 
Then a study is made to 
establish component equivalents, just as in the bifid system. 
If the text is replete with repeti- 
tions, or if a long word or a short phrase ma.p be assumed to be present, a start may be made and 
once this sort of entering wedge has been forced into the structure, its further. disintegration and 
ultimate complete demolition is only a matter of time and patience. 
55. Concluding remarks on fractionating 
systems.-a. 
It goes without 
saying that the 
basic principles of fractionation 
in the bifid and trifid systems are susceptible to a great deal of 
variation and complication. 
For example, instead of having periods of fixed length through the 
message it. is possible to vary the length of the periods according to some simple or complex key 
suitable for this purpose. -Or t,he bifid and trifid systems may be combined into a single scheme, 
enciphering a text by the bifld method and then reenciphering the cipher text by the trifid 
method and so on. 
Systems of this sort may become so complex as to defy analysis, especially 
if the keys are constantly and frequently varied so that no great amount of traffic accumulates 
in any single key. 
Fortunately 
for the crypt.analyst, however, such complex systems as these, if 
introduced into actual usage, are attended by so many difhculties in practice that the enemy 
cryptographic service would certainly break down and it would not be long before requests for 
repetition, the transmission of the same cryptogram in different keys, and so on, would afford 
clues to solution, 
Could such systems be employed successfully in field service there is no doubt 
that from the standpoint of security, the cryptograms would be theoretically secure. But t,he 
danger of error and the slowness with which they could be operated by the usual cryptographic 
clerks are such that systems of this complexity can hardly be employed in t,he field, and therefore 
the cryptanalyst may not expect to encounter them. 
b. However, the simple bifid system, the ADFGVX system, and the like,are indeed practicable 
for field use, have been used with success in the past, and may be expected to be in use in the 
future. 
It is therefore advisable that the student become thoroughly familiar with the basic 
principles of their solution and practice the application of these principles as frequently as pos- 
sible. 
In this connection, the attention of the student is directed to the fact that there is theo- 
retically no reason why the bipartite components of the ADFGVX system cannot be recombined 
by means of the same or a different checkerboard, thus reducing the cryptographic text to a form 
wherein it consists of 25 different letters, and at the same time cutting the length of the messages

in half. 
The matter is purely one of practicability: 
it adds one more step to the process. But it 
must not be overlooked that this additional step would add a good deal of strength to the system, 
for it would shorten, mask, distort, or entirely eliminate similar beginnings and similar endings- 
the two most fruitful sources of attack on this system. 
56. Concluding remarks on transposition systems.--a. 
Simple transposition systems hardly 
afford any security at all; complex ones may in the case of individual or single messages afford a 
high degree of security. 
But just as soon as many cryptograms in the same key are transmitted 
the chances of finding two or more cryptograms of identical length become quite good and the 
general solution may be applied. 
b. Contrary to the situation in the case of substitution, in that of transposition wherein the 
letters of the plain-text itself are transposed (not code) the shorter the cryptogram the greater the 
possibility of solution. 
For, in the case of a message of say only 25 or 30 letters, one might shift 
.the letters about and actually reconstruct the plain text as one does in the case of the game called 
(‘anagrams.” 
Of course, several different “solutions” 
may thus be obtained, but having such 
“solutions” 
it may be possible to reconstruct the system upon which the transposition was based 
and thus “prove” one of the solutions. 
c. The text has confined itself almost entirely to cases of uniliteral transposition, in order to 
demonstrate basic principles. 
But there is inherently no reason why transposition may not be 
applied to digraphs, trigraphs, or tetragraphs. 
If longer sequences are used as the units of 
transposition the security decreases very sharply, as in t,he case of the ordinary route ciphers of 
the Civil War period. 
d. Transposition designs, diagrams, or patterns are susceptible of yielding cryptograms of 
good security, if they are at all irregular or provide for nulls and blank spaces. Such devices are 
particularly 
difficult to solve if frequently changed. 
e. Transpositions effected upon fixed-length sequences of plain text yield a low degree of 
security but when a transposition is applied to the cipher text resulting from a good substitution 
system or to the code text of cryptograms first encoded by means of an extensive code book the 
increase in the cryptographic security of such cryptograms is quite notable. 
In fact, transposi- 
tion methods and designs are frequently used to “superencipher” 
substitution 
text or code and 
play a very important role in this field. 
Their great disadvantage is that inherent in all trans- 
position methods: 
The addition or deletion of a single letter or two often makes the entire 
cryptogram unreadable even with the correct key. 
f. The clues afforded by messages with similar beginnings, endings, or internal portions, 
and by repetitions of incorrectly 
enciphered messages without paraphrasing the original text 
are often sticient 
to make a solution possible or to facilitate a solution. 
For this reason the 
cryptanalyst 
should note all cases wherein clues of this sort may be applicable and be prepared 
to take full advantage of them.
