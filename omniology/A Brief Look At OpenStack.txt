INTRODUCTION

The cloud computing revolution continues to change the way organi-
zations view their IT resources. OpenStack cloud software provides a 
common, open source platform that can be used by corporations, service 
providers, researchers, and anyone else that wants to deploy a cloud.
Understanding OpenStack

CHAPTER ONE

For some time now, critics have suggested that OpenStack may offer lower 
total cost of ownership, but fails to deliver on agility and uptime compared to 
other cloud services. 
A recent story on ReadWrite quoted industry insiders who suggested 
OpenStack is merely a way to “fool” senior management into believing that a 
company has moved to cloud computing. TechRepublic, meanwhile, stated that 
OpenStack remains too complex to offer real opportunities for innovation. 
We asked Sam Charrington, a cloud computing analyst and founder of St. 
Louis-based CloudPulse Strategies, how he would respond to these criticisms 
of OpenStack if he were making the business case. 
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
A User’s Perspective
The Arguments Every  
OpenStack User Must Make

Bright Computing: Why should organizations think about 
using OpenStack? 
Sam Charrington: It is all about achieving greater agility. [OpenStack] is great 
to address questions such as, “What could we do as a business if it took us 
minutes to provision resources and not weeks?” Or “What could we do as a 
business if we could cut the time developers waste on chasing down resources 
and focus that on more creative activity?” 
BC: How can you calculate return on investment (ROI) on an OpenStack 
implementation more accurately?
SC: Both private and public clouds should be looked at for transformation, 
including team, business, and industry transformation. That is the true 
opportunity. Not everyone, however, sees it as this. If you dramatically shift the 
way business is done, deliver capabilities faster, or do things that you couldn’t 
do otherwise, it is a softer ROI than being able to replace a bunch of VMware 
licenses with OpenStack. So you can get too focused on ROI and just look at 
cost savings, but that could mean you are missing out on more innovation and 
limit your options for bigger wins down the road. 
BC: What are some of the most common OpenStack implementation 
challenges?
SC: The issue is that ease of use continues to get in the way of OpenStack 
adoption – it is harder to get started than many people would like, and as the 
platform grows with adding new projects, it is also not getting any easier. 
Having multiple choices for storage and networking makes it harder to install, 
but this also creates a lot of flexibility and power too.

BC: Where is OpenStack weakest when compared to AWS or VMware?
SC: They are very different beasts. OpenStack is more of a private cloud to date, 
but as more hosted implementations happen on OpenStack, they could be more 
comparable. The strength of an OpenStack-based public cloud is portability, 
and in using its APIs in multiple places. There really are limited on-premises 
options with AWS, while with OpenStack you can run both on-premises and in 
the cloud. Also, the AWS API is supported by a lot of tools because of its market 
presence and it is a lot more mature. VMware hasn’t been successful in building 
its own public clouds and to make things more portable to date.
BC: Where do you stand in terms of the debate on public vs. private 
clouds?
SC: The typical enterprise is experimenting with both technologies. There still is 
a lot of confusion between virtualized environments and private clouds. And IT 
managers need to understand the degree of automation that is behind private 
clouds, such as provisioning, scaling, and management features. 

BC: If you aren’t an Internet-native corporation like Facebook or Google, is 
there still a role that OpenStack can play?
SC: Yes, but it isn’t because of your question’s implication. I tend to think of 
OpenStack as a more commercially acceptable version of what Google and 
Facebook are building for themselves. These companies have their own internal 
management platforms and put a lot of time and effort into things that aren’t 
really applicable for most enterprises. OpenStack tries to help enterprises that 
can’t build these tools and tries to replicate some of the elements in these 
platforms. We are starting to see enterprises look more carefully at continuous 
development, (although) there is a lot of waterfall development still being 
done. More of them are trying to transition to DevOps, but it requires a culture 
change that is significant. The big benefit here is to enable a higher degree of 
agility, and that makes them useful for enterprises that want to do this.

CHAPTER TWO

OpenStack’s Future
Why the Internet of Things 
Will Be Driven by OpenStack
The Internet of Things not only promises a plethora of devices, such as wear-
ables and connected cars, but also guarantees there will be a deluge of data 
that requires processing. That means cloud infrastructures must keep pace, 
which experts say provides enterprises an opportunity to leverage OpenStack.
OpenStack is a good foundation for any vendor or supplier of Internet of Things 
(IoT) platforms and services, according to René Büst, senior analyst and cloud 
practice lead at Crisp Research. 
In Büst ‘s opinion, an IoT platform provider could deliver enablement services, 
or ways to facilitate online connectivity, by offering OpenStack to a service 
provider or vendor of IoT products. Whereas large enterprises that have com-
prehensive experience running complex IT infrastructure could run their own 
OpenStack environments for IoT applications.
Still early days
Right now, enterprises adopting OpenStack to support the IoT are looking at it 
mostly as a means to develop services, said Büst. These include mobile backend 

services, event hubs for connecting devices such as sensors, streaming analytics 
services, machine learning services, and edge location services. 
“OpenStack is just an infrastructure base,” he said. “It gives you the liberty to basically 
run every type of owned software and service on it. The more (by default) value-added 
services that are provided by the OpenStack Project, the easier they are to build and 
deliver IoT projects.”
Büst said the OpenStack community can help the technology become a viable platform 
for IoT if they develop more high value-added services that encapsulate specific use 
cases, such as OpenStack Sahara, which is intended to provide an easier means of 
provisioning Hadoop clusters to analyze big data. 
In Predictions 2015: Software Platforms Drive Internet Of Things Adoption, published 
by Forrester Research in November 2014, the research firm predicted the IoT trend is 
about to enter a second stage in its development that will focus on software applica-
tion platforms that provide pre-built connectivity, security, management, and  
analytics capabilities. 
An emerging cloud standard
In addition, OpenStack APIs will be a cloud standard, writes Forrester analyst Lauren 
Nelson in State Of Cloud Platform Standards: Q1 2014, noting today almost every 
public, private, and hosted private cloud provider either already has developed or is in 
the process of developing varying levels of support for the OpenStack APIs because 
of its powerful ecosystem. There also has been enterprise adoption from reputable 
Fortune 500 companies, such as Fidelity, Comcast, and Best Buy. 

For instance, Comcast has exhibited a very high profile about embracing OpenStack, 
which Nelson told Bright Computing is one of the best examples of an enterprise 
using the platform to embrace IoT. Comcast has built a private OpenStack cloud to 
support video streaming applications and communication between its network and 
customer set-top boxes. 
But there are many other IoT scenarios that could be supported by OpenStack, such 
as transportation systems for tracking buses that also correlate with weather data.
Nelson said enterprises of all sorts are going to find themselves supporting IoT to 
varying degrees, depending on their business, and already should have started to 
set up cloud infrastructures to handle the coming influx of data that  
needs processing. 
Building a private cloud for targeted IoT projects is a great way to begin, and some 
organizations have built a secondary private cloud for that purpose. Organizations 
are wary of putting valuable data and intellectual property in a public cloud, 
although one avenue enterprises are pursuing is building out their own OpenStack 
environment, on premises, and processing some data in a public cloud and bringing 
it back inside.
The coming transformation
Adoption of cloud infrastructure such as OpenStack to support IoT, however, has 
not yet gone mainstream. Many organizations are just beginning the transformation 
to becoming more software-driven businesses and are doing little software  
developer enablement. 

Nelson continued, “They’re not realizing they have to make changes now or 
they will be left behind. Even if an organization starts small, it takes at least 10 
OpenStack engineers to create an environment—and there is a lack of available 
OpenStack expertise. They will need people who are dedicated to this and who 
can learn it.” Remember, even small, targeted IoT projects can escalate and 
become more expensive.
Enterprises should be aware of everything that needs to be considered before 
building or adopting a cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack for supporting 
IoT, including the architecture design and which IoT-ready and IoT-enablement 
services should be available. 
Organizations, especially smaller or midsize ones, should consider if they 
really want to run an OpenStack infrastructure completely on their own, since 
OpenStack is complex and the right skills are still hard to come by. Instead, 
they should leverage OpenStack from a service provider that is managed or 
OpenStack-ready.

What Consolidation in the OpenStack Sector 
Means For Private Cloud Adoption
If there’s one sign of OpenStack’s increasing maturity, it’s a flurry of merger and 
acquisitions that may have organizations rethinking the vendors with whom they 
partner in the future, according to Gigaom Research’s latest CloudTracker report.
“OpenStack is heading towards a huge consolidation,” said the report, which was 
released in early January, calling out EMC, which acquired Cloudscaling last year, and 
Cisco’s interest in MetaCloud as examples of a few large commercial amalgamations. 
However, while some industry watchers predict consolidation, the market won’t 
be satisfied with just a few, large players. All this opens the door to vendors who 
understand the platform and can guide customers through the confusion towards 
effective implementations. 
Beyond merger activity, there’s still a lot of cash being poured into other emerging 
OpenStack firms. According to the Funding Tracker section in Gigaom’s report, in the 
fourth quarter of 2014 alone, firms in the space raised between $10 million and 
$100 million from venture capitalists. That’s a good sign; it proves that there’s plenty 
of interest in enterprises adopting the technology.

Although that may make the choice of supplier more challenging for customers, it 
also suggests that because large organizations have made substantial investments 
into this technology, OpenStack has the potential to contribute to  
data center transformation. 
In fact, 451 Research said in its OpenStack Market Monitor & Forecast, which 
focuses on the key public and private vendors that directly provide OpenStack 
offerings, that the OpenStack market is expected to reach $3.3 billion by 2018.
“OpenStack has seen tremendous growth over the last four years in terms of in-
vestment and community expansion,” wrote Al Sadowski, Research Director for 451 
Research’s Service Provider channel, who authored the report. “The open-source 
platform is increasingly a consideration for private cloud deployments, and the 
business models within the ecosystem continue to evolve.”
451 Research is not the only one to make such bold forecasts. This year, predicts 
Ken Rugg, CEO of database-as-a-service vendor Tesora, the number of OpenStack 
projects in production or being planned will exceed the number of VMware clouds.
Gigaom didn’t go that far, but did suggest that public/private hybrid clouds 
would be a focus for cloud platform vendors in the first quarter of this year. An 
increasingly fragmented container market, as competitors rise to challenge Docker’s 
dominance, will nonetheless continue its move to the mainstream. And, to keep 
things interesting, Canonical is pushing its LXD and LXC, which is tightly integrated 
with OpenStack Nova, as an alternative to containers. 
Bright Cluster Manager for OpenStack brings a proven cloud / cluster management 
software solution to the OpenStack community, thereby making it even easier to 
deploy a complete cloud over bare metal and manage it effectively.

CHAPTER THREE

Many organizations are looking to build a private cloud infrastructure in their 
own data centers in order to reduce their dependence on expensive public 
cloud services. Using Bright’s OpenStack solution puts this capability in the 
hands of virtually any organization. Bright Cluster Manager for OpenStack can 
turn a rack of servers into a working cloud in less time than you’d imagine, 
leaving you free to start deploying services. Now you can choose to run appli-
cations in a public OpenStack cloud or your own private cloud.

becomes quick and easy.
Here Bright’s Status tab summarizes an OpenStack private cloud in terms of instances, tenants, 
flavors, software images, networks, users, and more.

CHAPTER FOUR

The release of OpenStack Juno in October added a slew of new features to 
the Nova component that include networking capabilities, but as work contin-
ues on the next-generation Kilo release, experts say users can expect more 
advanced features in a component called Neutron, with a migration path to 
integrate both.
Nova, the cloud-based fabric controller used to provide OpenStack infrastruc-
ture-as-a-service, was originally the sole networking piece within OpenStack. 
In 2011, however, the OpenStack Quantum project, renamed Neutron, was 
started as a dedicated effort within OpenStack to provide full Software De-
fined Networking (SDN) capabilities and as a possible replacement for Nova.
With OpenStack Juno, however, both Neutron and Nova have seen improve-
ments in networking features. This includes support for multiple networks 
while gaining visibility into network information by way of new data hooks. 
Juno also improved Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) in Nova with 
new multiple interface support. Meanwhile, Nova is poised to get a slew of 
updates with Kilo, the next version of OpenStack, including some additional 
networking features.
Nova and Neutron
What Every OpenStack Nova User  
Needs To Know

Nova’s clear direction
As Michael Still, project team leader for 
OpenStack Compute, outlines in this video, 
Nova is what allows you to build a virtual 
machine and gives you access to it. But to do 
that, Still notes, it might have to orchestrate 
other systems, which is where Neutron 
could be used for configuration purposes. 
Ultimately, Nova is what provides access to 
compute resources and ties in with the other 
OpenStack projects. Nova is likely part of the 
majority of OpenStack deployments, he added.
According to Still, the recent Kilo summit in 
Paris provided a clear direction as to where 
Nova should go, including the need for big 
architectural improvements. One new feature 
already available is the ability to create 
sub-Novas, which are called cells. Version 2 
of this feature already is underway, but not 
likely to be completed with Kilo. There also is 
a lot of interest in developing the scheduler. 
Another priority for Kilo is Nova-to-Neutron 
migration, which is close to reality. There is a 
plan, but it has yet to be implemented.
Donna Scott, an analyst with Cambridge, 
Mass.-based Gartner Inc., said Neutron is 
stealing some of the attention from Nova 
right now because it’s a newer project within 
OpenStack and provides more advanced 
networking capabilities that businesses are 
demanding, such as automated networking 
across multiple data centers and clouds. “It’s 
the (business) requirements that are pushing 
Neutron,” she said. “You need something more 
sophisticated, and Neutron lays the ground-
work for that.”
Scott expects that in terms of new capabil-
ities, networking updates probably will be 
implemented in Neutron, and said having a 
migration tool would be a good thing. “For 
anyone who starts an OpenStack deployment 
today, they would use Nova and Neutron 
together,” she said.

More integration,  
fewer challenges
Andreas Olah, research analyst for servers 
with IDC European Systems and Infrastructure 
Solutions, also expects Nova and Neutron to 
continue to co-exist. He said the research firm 
has not done any studies that contrast Nova 
with Neutron yet, but that Nova remains a 
core component for the compute service, with 
Neutron fulfilling networking, Swift providing 
object storage, and Cinder supporting block 
storage as the other major OpenStack compo-
nents that all need to be linked together.
Nova is considered the most complex compo-
nent of the OpenStack family, mainly due to 
its numerous processes and highly distributed 
nature. Nova controls the cloud computing 
fabric and, therefore, is at the core of the 
infrastructure service.
“As Nova is to continue in parallel with Neu-
tron, the focus will be on tighter integration,” 
said Olah. OpenStack consists of many 
different independent modules and there still 
are challenges, particularly for telecommunica-
tions customers, Nova integration with other 
components, such as Neutron. Olah continued, 
“The Juno release provided 342 new features 
and corrected more than 3,200 errors that 
were causing headaches for users of previous 
versions. NFV also is gaining importance in 
the community as the Nova Compute project 
provides advanced functionality, such as the 
Ironic bare-metal-as-a-service feature.”
Overall, as good business practice, end-users 
should follow a step-by-step approach for 
deploying less critical workloads on Nova/
OpenStack first, then extend to key business 
applications as the initial trial  
proves successful.

Migrating users from Nova to Neutron will be a big focus of OpenStack Kilo, and 
experts say enterprises that have not begun the switchover to meet their more 
advanced networking needs should start getting ready for the transition.
While Nova is still a core component of OpenStack, it will be used primarily 
for compute functions, with Neutron taking over as the project that keeps in 
line with industry trends in networking, according to analysts. These include 
software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV).
The work to close the functionality and feature gap between Neutron and 
Nova has been ongoing since Icehouse and Juno, but based on feedback from 
the Paris Design Summit, transparency and track priorities have been increased, 
and a significant amount of time is being spent on testing.
That doesn’t mean Nova is going away, said Lauren Foster, senior analyst 
focused on infrastructure at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. “It’s not 
Nova versus Neutron, per se,” she said. 
Instead, the advent of Neutron, previously known as Quantum, was driven by 
the realization that a separate project was needed to keep up with industry 
trends, such as SDN. 
What OpenStack Users  
Need To Know About Neutron

Time to move
Migration has been a hot topic of conversation among the OpenStack community, said Foster, 
and enterprises often don’t move directly from one release to the next because of the quick 
six-month release cycle. On the other hand, she does see almost all organizations adopting 
Neutron to some degree eventually.
René Büst, senior analyst and cloud practice lead at Crisp Research in Germany, said Kilo’s focus 
on migrating Nova-network installations to Neutron is a significant development, and that the 
Neutron team is working with the OpenStack NFV sub-team to integrate relevant features, 
such as better connections between hardware and Neutron Layer 2 segments. Ultimately, he 
said, Nova-network will disappear.
Büst also said enterprises and service providers that are new to OpenStack and have no legacy 
projects probably will be among the early adopters of Neutron, especially those that need to 
build and support complex network and SDN infrastructure.  
Cloud providers that have to deliver more value-added services, such as load balanc-
ing-as-a-service (LBaaS) or security-as-a-service (SECaaS), also should be looking at Neutron. 
“Nova-network is broadly used as the network-as-a-service component in most OpenStack 
deployments,” said Büst, “but it is old-fashioned since it only supports three kinds of network 
topologies: Flat, Flat DHCP, or VLAN.” 
Neutron allows setting up more complex topologies with routers, networks, subnets and 
ports, he said, enabling a huge variety of networking configurations per tenant. Neutron gives 
additional networking capabilities that are required by more complex future workloads  
and use cases.

Multi-tier applications
Büst said that since multi-cloud environments are becoming more prevalent, Neutron is being 
used to support the backend for multi-tier web applications, as well as LBaaS. With SECaaS 
becoming more important, meanwhile, he expects enterprises to look at Neutron to support 
more deployments of intrusion detection, as well as firewall and virtual private networks, all of 
them “as-a-service” in the near future. 
The distributed virtual routing introduced with Juno—by which routing functionality is distrib-
uted to each compute node—is a major milestone, since it is removing the need for a central 
Layer 3 network node, which will enable better high-availability architectures.
One analyst stated that the overall benefits of OpenStack are based on component systems, 
meaning if one fails, it doesn’t create a system-wide failure. However, its breadth can be 
confusing for some organizations.
There still is a significant lack of OpenStack knowledge in the market, said Büst, and Neutron 
is not the only component an enterprise needs to successfully run an OpenStack environment. 
“All components need to tightly work together.” 
He recommends that enterprises increase the internal OpenStack knowledge if they want to 
run their own environments rather than consulting external experts.
