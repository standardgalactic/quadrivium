RED TEAM VS. BLUE TEAM
EXERCISES WITH CHATGPT
The "Red Team" represents attackers, while the
"Blue Team" defends the organization.
Red Team vs. Blue Team exercises are not about
winning or losing; they're about continuous
improvement. 
ChatGPT can be a valuable asset on the Red
Team side. It can simulate various attack
scenarios, create convincing phishing emails,
and 
generate 
realistic 
social 
engineering
attempts.
