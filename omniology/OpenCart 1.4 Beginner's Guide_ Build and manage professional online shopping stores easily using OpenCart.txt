1
Installing OpenCart
Since OpenCart is a considerably new online shopping cart solution, many web 
hosting service providers do not have one-click installation for OpenCart yet. So, 
we will need to install OpenCart ourselves.
Installation of OpenCart is an easy task and follows a standard procedure like 
PHP and MySQL-based open source software. On the other hand, there are 
some important key points we should be careful at. 
In this chapter we shall:


Learn the system requirements needed to install OpenCart


Learn to download and upload OpenCart files to a web server


Learn to set file and folder permissions


Learn to create a MySQL database and user


Learn to complete installation with the OpenCart wizard
This chapter is suggested for reading even if you are a tech-savvy computer user, as you 
can eliminate the possible problems while installing OpenCart.
System requirements
By the time of the writing of this book, the latest OpenCart release is 1.4.7 and the 
system requirements are valid for this version. Previous versions can need the same 
or fewer requirements.
www.allitebooks.com

Installing OpenCart
[ 8 ]
We would suggest installing v1.4.7 and reading the book carefully. If there 
are new releases of OpenCart after the publication of this book, you can at 
any time download it from the OpenCart website and see the differences 
easily because you will already have a strong foundation in OpenCart after 
completing the book.
We must download and install OpenCart on our own or on a shared web hosting solution. 
OpenCart system can run on an Apache or Windows server. Currently, OpenCart supports 
only MySQL database. Overall, OpenCart was designed to work flawlessly on an ideal LAMP 
solution (Linux, Apache, MySql, and PHP), but it is also possible to run using a Windows 
server, MySQL, and PHP.
If you aim to run OpenCart on Windows, you can use WAMP Server. It is 
available for download at http://www.wampserver.com/en/.
The following screenshot shows the minimum system requirements for OpenCart for 
installation and running without problems.
You should contact your hosting provider if you are not sure whether these settings are 
set or not. 
If you want to take advantage of SEO URLs, your hosting should allow using 
mod_rewrite extension for Apache and permission to change .htaccess 
file
We will talk about SEO in OpenCart in Chapter 4, Configuring Store Settings.

Chapter 1
[ 9 ]
Installing OpenCart
Be sure that your web hosting solution meets the previous requirements before starting 
installation steps. The easiest way of determining this is to send a requirement list to web 
server technical support. We will complete installing OpenCart using the following sections:


Downloading OpenCart from http://opencart.com


Uploading OpenCart files to a web host


Creating MySQL database and a user for OpenCart


Using OpenCart installation wizard


Deleting installation files after completion


Browsing to online storefront


Making first login to OpenCart administration interface
Now, let's start to explore each section in detail.
Downloading OpenCart
Downloading the latest version of OpenCart is an easy and straightforward task. Let's see 
how we achieve downloading.
Time for action – downloading OpenCart
In this section, we are going to download OpenCart archive file. 
1. We browse to the http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=download/
download link. This page will list the latest OpenCart version. The download page is 
similar to the following screenshot.
We can see the full list of OpenCart versions on: 
http://code.google.com/p/opencart/.

Installing OpenCart
[ 10 ]
2. Let's click on the link and choose the Save File option to save it in the computer:
What just happened?
We have downloaded the OpenCart files as a ZIP archive file on our computer. Now we are 
ready to upload the files to the web host.
Uploading OpenCart files
There are two common methods for uploading files to a web host:


Using cPanel File Manager Utility


Using an FTP Client
We will learn both the methods with examples.
The first method is suggested because we can upload the installation files 
faster to the host. 
We suggest installing OpenCart on a directory, such as 
http://yourwebsite.com/store
By doing this, we will able to close the shop temporarily if we need to later, 
without affecting the root domain at http://yourwebsite.com.
Let's start with the suggested cPanel method.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Time for action – uploading OpenCart using cPanel 
File Manager
This is the first method of uploading OpenCart files to a web host. Many modern web hosting 
solutions include a control panel called cPanel, and we can use the cPanel File Manager 
utility to directly upload a ZIP file to web host and decompress the files there easily. 
In this example, we will install OpenCart on the store directory.
You can generally reach cPanel on http://yourwebsite.com/cpanel 
with the username and password which the hosting provider emailed to you 
upon registration.
1. Let's open File Manager utility at cPanel. 
2. It will choose the Web Root as default. We will continue with the Go button.

Installing OpenCart
[ 12 ]
3. Let's click on the Upload link.
4. Let's choose OpenCart ZIP file using the Browse button on the next screen. After 
the upload completes, we return back to the main cPanel File Manager screen.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
5. We will right-click on the file and select Extract.
6. It will open a pop-up window. Just press the Extract File(s) button to decompress 
the ZIP file into the root web folder.
All files were extracted into a folder named opencart_v1.7.
The default folder name depends on our OpenCart version.

Installing OpenCart
[ 14 ]
7. We will need to browse into this folder first. We see a folder called upload under it. 
We will need to rename it as store at first. 
Right-click on it and choose Rename from the menu.
8. Rename the directory as store, as in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
9. We will need to move the renamed store directory to the root. Let's right-click on 
the store directory and choose Move from the menu.
10. Change the destination directory as /public_html/ and click on Move File(s) button.

Installing OpenCart
[ 16 ]
What just happened?
OpenCart files are now on the web host in a subdirectory. Our online store will be reachable at 
http://yourwebsite.com/store after completion of all the remaining installation steps.
If you have completed uploading OpenCart files to a subdirectory using cPanel 
File Manager tool already, skip the following action and continue reading 
Setting File Permissions.
Time for action – uploading OpenCart using an FTP Client
This is the second method of uploading files to a webserver. 
If you have already used the first method (Uploading Files using cPanel) 
please skip this action and continue with Setting File Permissions. 
In this section, we will learn how to decompress the OpenCart files in a local folder and 
upload to the root of web server using an FTP Client. 
1. Right-click on the previously downloaded OpenCart file on your computer and click 
Extract Here option.
As a result, we will have a folder named opencart_v1.7 with the structured 
folders and files inside. 
Please note that folder name can be different depending on the OpenCart 
version we downloaded.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
2. We will create a directory named as store on the root of the website using the ftp 
Make Directory command.
3. Upload all the files and the subfolders in opencart_v1.7/upload folder to the 
web host in the/store folder. We use a free FTP client software called CoreFTP, 
which can be downloaded at http://www.coreftp.com/. Choose all the files and 
folders in the directory from the left panel and drag and drop into the right panel 
where the web root folder exists. In most cases, it is /www folder. So, our destination 
is /www/store.
The following screenshot shows the process before dragging and droping 
the files:
www.allitebooks.com

Installing OpenCart
[ 18 ]
And the screenshot after uploading the files to the folder named as store is 
as follows:
Notice that it is a time consuming process since there are many files in OpenCart 
system. Let's wait until all the files are uploaded to the web server.
What just happened?
We have uploaded all OpenCart files and subfolders to the store directory on the website 
using an ftp client. 
So, our online store will be reachable at http://yourwebsite.com/store after 
completion of all installation steps.
Pop quiz – Uploading OpenCart Files
Suppose that we have a very slow internet connection and want to install OpenCart on a 
web host without any possible interruptions on file transfer. Which upload method is more 
effective in terms of speed and reliability? 
1.	 Using an FTP Client program.
2.	 Using cPanel File Transfer Utility.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
Time for action – setting file permissions
OpenCart system uses its several directories dynamically to create, change, and delete the 
files when needed. Because of this, we have to be sure that the correct file permissions are 
applied on these files and folders. 
Now, let's see how we will set the permissions using cPanel File Manager:
1. We should be sure that the following directories and config files are writeable, 
meaning that their permissions are set to at least 755. We can check this by using 
cPanel file manager.


/store/image


/store/image/cache


/store/image/data


/store/system/cache


/store/system/logs


/store/download


/store/config.php


/store/admin/config.php 
Some hosting systems require 777 permissions for OpenCart to work properly. 
If the installation screens which we will soon learn give such unwritable 
errors, then we should set permissions to 777 and try going through with the 
installation screen again.
The following screenshot shows that all these directories are set to 755 properly, but 
config.php file is not set to 755:

Installing OpenCart
[ 20 ]
2. So, let's open cPanel file manager and right-click on config.php file. Let's select 
Change Permissions:
3. Set Permission level to 755. Click the Change Permissions button.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
4. We must repeat this process for all the folders listed below including the subfolders 
and files inside one by one if not set correctly to 755:


/store/image


/store/image/cache


/store/image/data


/store/system/cache


/store/system/logs


/store/download


/store/config.php


/store/admin/config.php 
What just happened?
We have set the needed file and folder permissions to 755. It was needed for OpenCart to 
install and operate correctly. Depending on our hosting provider's linux settings, we might 
need 777 as well.
Curious readers can learn more about server security on this http://www.
unix.com/unix-dummies-questions-answers/33137-chmod-
777-security-risks.html link.
Time for action – creating a MySQL database and user
This step is needed for OpenCart to connect and store all the data in a MySQL database. 
We will learn how to create a new database and user for this database. We will later use 
this information in OpenCart Installation wizard.
We will use MySQL Databases link on cPanel. Even though there can be slight differences 
on different cPanel versions, the main idea and the process is the same.
1. Click on MySQL Databases link on cPanel:

Installing OpenCart
[ 22 ]
2. Enter a name for the database. Here, we named the database as opencart. Then, 
click on the Create Database button.
If we are on a share hosting, a prefix will be added automatically to the name we 
provided. This is generally the username which we use to log in to the cPanel. So, 
your database name will follow the template of cPanelLogin_databasename.
Take a note of the database name including the prefix. 
3. Now, let's create a user and assign this user to our newly created database. We go 
back from database creation result page and jump to MySQL Users section.
Choose a username and password. Repeat the password on the last text box and be 
sure that the password is not very easy to guess for security preferably a mixture of 
letters and numbers.) We have chosen dbuser as the username. Click on the Create 
User button after filling all the required textboxes.
Please note that a prefix will be added to the user as well. Take a note of 
the username.

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
4. We need to add user to the database as the last step. Choose the newly created user 
and database for OpenCart, and then click the Add button.
5. In this step, we are going to assign privileges for the user in the database. Select 
the All Privileges option, and then press the Make Changes button to give all the 
privileges to the user.
Providing all MySQL privileges to a user can be dangerous on a production site. 
Optionally, you can remove unnecessary permissions such as create, drop, and 
alter tables after installation is complete. Also note that some plugins which 
we can later install can require create, and alter permissions. 
Depending on our knowledge and experience on MySQL permissions, we are 
free to choose an advanced or simplified privileges management.

Installing OpenCart
[ 24 ]
The following screenshot shows the result page after clicking the Make 
Changes button:
What just happened?
We have seen how to prepare a database for OpenCart. The steps include:
1.	 Choosing a name for the database.
2.	 Choosing a username and providing a secure password.
3.	 Adding user to the database.
4.	 Adding privileges to user for the database.
Now we are ready to continue our installation by using OpenCart Installation Wizard.
Time for action – using OpenCart Installation Wizard
1. Let's browse the domain name where we put OpenCart files. In our example, it is 
http://yourwebsite.com/store. You should use your own OpenCart path. 
We will be redirected to a License screen automatically. Click Continue to start.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
2. OpenCart will control several installation requirements, including PHP settings 
and extensions.

Installing OpenCart
[ 26 ]
3. Then, the permissions of several files and directories are checked. If there are no 
errors, all we have to do is click the Continue button.
If the system check finds any serious error, it will stop the installation temporarily 
and will not let us go further until we solve the problem. If it is the case, please 
check the requirements list section and file permission settings again carefully. 
If there is a need to make changes on the PHP settings and extension, please 
contact your hosting provider.
4. In this step, we will supply the database connection information to OpenCart 
system. First, we should provide the previously created MySQL user and password 
for User and Password fields. Then, fill the MySQL database name in the Database 
Name field. 
Finally, we should choose a Username, Password, and Email to be used to log in and 
manage the OpenCart system.
Let's ignore the Database Prefix option.

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
If we are allowed to create only one MySQL database for all applications being 
installed on hosting, it is a good idea to use Database Prefix option. It would put 
the shortened text in front of table names which will help us in differentiating 
tables in each application. oc would be a good prefix example. So, the tables 
would look like oc_tablename.
"After filling in all the required fields, click on the Continue button.

Installing OpenCart
[ 28 ]
5. Even though the following screen has informed us that we have finished, we actually 
have not! 
For security purposes, we must delete the installation directory. Then, we should 
check the online storefront and administration screens to be sure that everything 
is working in the default settings.
6. Let's open cPanel file manager again and browse to /store folder. Let's find install 
folder. We will right-click on it and choose Delete from the menu.
We could also use an Ftp client to delete, store, or install folder.

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
7. The next step is to confirm the deletion of the install folder. Let's click on the Delete 
File(s) button.

Installing OpenCart
[ 30 ]
8. Let's browse to http://yourwebsite.com/store, the online shop storefront. 
We can see a pre-populated sample store that is similar to the following screenshot:
Let's browse to the OpenCart administration screen at http://yourwebsite.
com/store/admin and log in by using our admin username and password.

Chapter 1
[ 31 ]
We will see an administration screen similar to the following screenshot:
Congratulations! Our OpenCart installation is now complete.
What just happened?
We have completed the installation using OpenCart wizard. The steps included the approval 
of license agreement, system checks (php settings, file permissions), providing database 
connection information, and deleting the install folder after completion of install. Finally, 
there are checking the storefront and administration screens.
We have now a sample running OpenCart system. 
Have a go hero – Adding another OpenCart instance
Now, it is time for testing your skills on installing another instance of OpenCart at the
http://yourwebsite.com/teststore folder. Later, will only be able to use this instance 
for testing purposes before applying some new things on the original store which we have 
together completed installing. Try to do the steps on your own without looking at the 
chapter sections at first. If difficulties occur, re-read the required chapter sections.

Installing OpenCart
[ 32 ]
Summary
As you see, OpenCart installation is very straightforward. The most important thing is to be 
sure that your hosting environment runs on an Apache server with (Linux or Windows) and 
PHP 5.0+ and MySQL is supported. If we want to SEO-enable our system, let's be sure that 
mod_rewrite extension for Apache and permission to change .htaccess file is allowed.
In this chapter, we learned how to install OpenCart on a web server. 
Specifically, we covered:


Requirements


Downloading and uploading files


Setting permissions


Creating MySQL database and user



We are ready to explore OpenCart categories and products and their options on the 
next chapter.

2
Categories, Products, and Options
An optimized organization of an online store mostly depends on the defined 
categories and subcategories. There are several ways to organize an online 
store. Before starting adding products, we should carefully plan how our store 
will be browsed by visitors using the categories and subcategories.
In this chapter we shall learn:


The terms category, product, and option.


Different possible scenarios when organizing a sample online shoe store


Deleting pre-populated store data


Adding categories and subcategories


Adding manufacturers (brands)


Adding a simple product with basic data


Extending the product with feature options


Adding extra images for a product
Category, product, and option
Before starting to add data for our store, let's understand the hierarchy amongst the terms 
such as category, product, and option. 
Products are the items that are sold in our online store. Categories are a classification of 
very closely related products in groups. Options are the values which further define the 
properties of a product. Options enable the customers to choose different features for a 
certain product.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 34 ]
For example, for our shoe store, a winter boot would be a product in men's shoes or 
women's shoes category. The color of the boot is a typical option for customers to choose. 
So, black color is a sample option value for a winter boot.
In OpenCart, a product can be listed under multiple categories and can get many options 
as well. 
Now, let's give four different sample category organizations for an online shoe store.
Category Organization #1
The following sample hierarchy shows a typical category organization for a large shoe store 
which sells every kind of shoe:

Chapter 2
[ 35 ]
Category Organization #2
The following organization can suit a women fashion shoe store better, if most of the 
customers who visit this store care about the brand rather than shoe type and start 
browsing for a certain brand. Notice that we have used several brands as top categories:
Category Organization #3
We could even define the size option as a category for a shoe store in addition to the typical 
categories. Note that it would complicate the backend management of the store since we 
would need to assign every size option for a shoe to a related shoe size category.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 36 ]
Category Organization #4
It is possible to make a category for a seasonal, very popular shoe brand. If your customers 
are heavily looking for UGGs, it is a good idea to make a category for it. For example, UGG 
brand shoes could even be a top category depending on the sales trends. We can later 
delete this specific category after the season finishes.
Overall, the correct store organization depends on how the majority of store visitors begin 
browsing on our store. The aim is to provide what they look for most, as easily as possible.
We will follow the traditional category organization throughout the book similar to the one 
in example #1.
Pre-installed store categories, products
As you can remember from Chapter 1, OpenCart installation had built a sample electronics 
store upon completion of installation. 
It is a good idea to delete all the data before starting a fresh online store which we will 
customize according to our needs.
Time for action – deleting pre-installed store data
In this section, we will delete all the old sample store data that we will not need for our 
new store. 
1. We browse to the OpenCart administration panel and make a login using the 
username and password we have created upon installation. The administration 
panel is available at http://yourwebsite.com/store/admin.

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
2. Let's click on the Catalog | Categories menu.
3. Let's choose all category items by using the checkbox on the top-left of the screen 
and then delete all categories. 
4. As a result, we have deleted all categories, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 38 ]
5. The next step is to browse a Catalog | Products menu.
6. We select all the products on the page by using the checkbox on the top-left of the 
screen and clicking the Delete button.
7. Do not forget to repeat this process for the second page to delete all products.
What just happened?
We have just finished deleting all categories and products on the pre-installed sample store.

Chapter 2
[ 39 ]
Have a go hero – deleting pre-populated manufacturer data
Now, it is your turn to delete all manufacturer data which was inserted automatically 
upon installation. 
Hint: It is under the Catalog | Manufacturers menu.
Categories and subcategories
Categories and subcategories determine what kind of browsing experience we will provide to 
the visitors. Let's start adding a sample classical shoe store category organization.
Time for action – adding a category and subcategory under it
In this section, we will add Men's shoes as a parent (top) category for our store. Then, we 
will add a Athletic subcategory under it.
1. Let's open the Catalog | Categories menu.
2. We will click on the Insert button next.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 40 ]
3. Let's fill in the general category data similar to the following screenshot by Category 
Name, Meta Tag Description, and Description. Then we will click on the Data tab.
4. We should choose the Default store name from the Stores list and click on the 
Save button. We can disable a category showing in our store by changing Category 
status. The default value is Enabled. We can also arrange categories in a way that 
they will appear in the order we want using Sort Order field. By default, it is 0.
We will talk about SEO Keyword field in one of the later chapters. Leave the other 
fields on their default settings.
We can run more than one store on a single OpenCart installation. We will 
explore the topic of creating new stores in later chapters. For this chapter, 
we will be doing operations on Default installed store.

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
5. We have finished adding the Men's shoes category. Now, let's click on the Insert 
button to continue adding the subcategory.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 42 ]
6. We fill in the general information for the Athletic subcategory similar to the 
following screenshot. Then, let's click on the Data tab.
7. We choose Men's shoes as Parent Category in order to place the Athletic category 
as a sub-category under Men's shoes. Let's choose Default store. We will click on 
the small icon on the Image field to add a new image for the category.

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
8. Image manager will be opened. We will see a list of pre-uploaded images for the 
sample store. Let's continue by clicking on the New Folder menu item. A pop-up 
box will be opened. Let's enter shoes as a new folder name and click on the 
Submit button.
9. We have now shoes directory under the image directory. Let's click on the 
Upload menu item.
10. After we upload an image from the local computer, we will see that the image 
is available for usage. Let's double click on the image.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 44 ]
11. Finally, we have attached an image for the category. Let's click on the Save button to 
complete the process.
12. Let's browse to our store and browse the Men's shoes category. Notice that some 
of the information we have provided for these categories have appeared: the 
description field for men's shoes and image for Athletic sub-category.

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
What just happened?
We have added a Men's shoes category and Athletic subcategory under it. Notice that we 
have carefully written, detailed text in the meta description field for both categories. It is 
important to not neglect this field because search engines use meta HTML tag data to help 
indexing the pages. Adding related images on subcategories also helps the website become 
visually more attractive. We could also optionally enable/disable a category at any time and 
decide the sort order of categories.
Have a go hero – adding more categories and subcategories
Now, add more categories and subcategories for the online shoe store. Try adding multiple 
level subcategories similar to a tree structure. Also play with the Sort Order field and see 
how it affects the appearance of categories.
Hint: Women's shoes | Boots | Platforms categories
Have a go hero – deleting pre-installed images
Now, free your image manager by deleting pre-installed images. You can do this either by 
deleting each image one-by-one using image upload screens or by using cPanel file manager, 
or alternatively FTP to delete all image files in OpenCart system under images/data directory.
Adding manufacturers (brands)
We can provide more information about a product to visitors by defining manufacturers 
(brands). The brands data also will be listed under product detail page and interested users 
can click on a brand name to browse all listed items under this brand. For our Athletic men's 
shoes category, we can use sample brand names like Adidas, Reebok, Puma, and so on.
Time for action – adding Reebok as shoe brand
We will now see how to add Reebok as a shoe brand on our store.
1. Browse the Catalog | Manufacturer menu in the administration panel and click on 
the Insert button.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 46 ]
2. Write Reebok as Manufacturer name and select the default store name from the 
available Stores list. Then, we can provide the Reebok logo as an image in a similar 
way as we did for categories previously. Finally, click on the Save button to finish.
What just happened?
We have finished adding a sample brand name for our store. It is a common practice to 
provide company logos as an image in many real online stores. This way, our store would 
also look more attractive and informative.
Have a go hero – adding more sample brands
Now, add Puma and Adidas as other brands for the shoe store.
Adding products
Adding a product for online store involves several steps. OpenCart product definition 
interface is very easy to use, and well planned in tabs to take the required data in groups. 
Time for action – adding a Reebok shoe model as a product
We will add a Reebok shoe model and assign it to Athletic sub-category under Men's shoes. 
We will also define all the basic data for the shoe model including price, main image, brand 
info, stock information, etc.

Chapter 2
[ 47 ]
1. Open the Catalog | Products menu and click on the Insert button.
2. We have to give a Product Name for our shoe model at first. Then, we can optionally 
provide meta tag description and description, which will appear on the shoe details 
page. Let's write Reebok Fuego Running Shoe for the product name. Then, click on 
the Data tab to continue.
3. We have to write a uniquely defined product for the mandatory Model field. We 
can write item no as the model value, as shown in the following screenshot. We 
can optionally provide SKU for the product. 
Basically, SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique identifier for each distinct product 
and service that can be purchased. SKUs are often used to refer to different 
versions of the same product. For example, a retail store carrying Guitar Hero 
3 might have six SKUs, two for each of the three platforms—one with and one 
without a guitar. 
Read more about SKU on:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-keeping_unit

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 48 ]
4. Then, we should provide the main image for the shoe. We already know how to 
use Image Manager. So, let's upload a suitable image for the product. Let's choose 
Reebok from the manufacturer option. Since our product is a physical one, we 
choose Requires Shipping option as Yes. 
Note that downloadable products will not require 
shipping.
5. Let's give 20 for the Quantity in the stock for this shoe model. We should give a 
sales Price. In this example, we have provided 45. Leave the other fields at their 
default settings for our example.
Optionally, we could change Date Available field which shows when the product will 
be enabled on the store. So, it is possible to define products which will be activated 
on a future date.
Out of Stock Status defines which message will be shown on product detail page to 
customers when the product goes out of stock. The default value is 2 - 3 days. We 
could also show Out of Stock, In Stock, Pre-order values as a message as well.

Chapter 2
[ 49 ]
By changing Status field, we are able to enable/disable a product from 
sitewide visibility.
We will talk about Tax Class in next chapter.
We could also provide more physical information about the product using the 
Length, Weight, Dimensions fields. This could be important for certain types of 
products. For example, with a marble block for decoration, a customer would 
certainly need to know about dimensions.
Notice that we didn't provide a currency ($, Euro, and so on.) for the price. We 
will return to this topic in later chapters.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 50 ]
6. We will choose the Men's shoes > Athletic subcategory for this product. Just 
because we currently have one store, we will select it from the Stores list. 
Since it is our first product, we can't choose any Related Products yet. 
The Related Products section helps visitors to browse for 
similar items on the product details page.
7. We will ignore the other tabs for now since we will review them later. Let's click on 
the Save button to complete a basic product; in this specific case, an athletic men's 
shoe model for our online shoe store.

Chapter 2
[ 51 ]
8. We now see the added shoe model in the products listings.
9. Let's browse into our shop interface and find the newly added shoe. As you can see 
from the screenshot, it is available for purchase:
What just happened?
We have defined a shoe model with the minimum essential data. Notice that we have just 
left some options on their default settings. We will talk about them later.
Notice that online store visitors can buy this shoe model, but they are not able to choose a 
color or a size. Without these purchase options, the store would not operate professionally.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 52 ]
Time for action – adding purchase options for customers
Now, let's learn how we can define different color purchase options for our Reebok Fuego 
shoe model.
1. Browse to Catalog|Products listings and click on the Edit button near the listed 
shoe model.
2. Let's open the Option tab and click on the Add Option button. As soon as we do 
this, a new section will appear under this button. We write Color for the Option 
field. Finally, let's click on the Add Option Value button.
3. A new section will be added under the Color option. Now we can add different color 
options. Let's add Black for Option Value and define that we have 10 of them in the 
stock by filling the Quantity field. As the shoes with the black color option are sold, 
the total stock amount will be decreased accordingly, since we have chosen Subtract 
Stock field as Yes by default. Then, let's click on the Color option in the list on the 
left-hand side.

Chapter 2
[ 53 ]
4. Let's define another color option, Blue, similar to the previous one. Finally, let's 
add a Special Design option value. Note that for the last option value, we have 
filled the Price field as 15. Notice the + in the Prefix field. Its purpose is to add 
this price to base price of the product if this option value is selected. So, if the 
Black shoe is sold for 45, the Special Design shoe will be sold for 45 + 15 = 60. 
This is the power of option values. 
Notice that we can remove any Option or Option Value using the Remove button. 
Let's click on the Save button to complete adding the Color option with three option 
values (Black, Blue, Special Design).

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 54 ]
5. Let's open the product details for this shoe again. Notice that we now Color in the 
Available Options list. Visitors had to choose one from the listed section. The Black 
color was selected by default because it is the first option we had added.
We could use Sort Order to arrange orders of the options 
and option values.
6. Let's choose the Special Design option from the list and click on the Add to 
Cart button.

Chapter 2
[ 55 ]
7. As you can see from the updated shopping cart, the final sub-total price for the shoe 
has increased to 60 because of additional +15 price coming from Special Design 
option. The shopping cart also put Color Special Design as a note under the product 
name in a format of Option + Option value.
What just happened?
We have learnt how to add more features to a product by using options and option values. 
This way, we can add as many features as we want for an item. The more such options we 
add, the more flexible customers will be to choose the item with the features they want.
Pop quiz – understanding option values
Suppose that we have a boots shoe model with anti-slippery feature by default. It is priced 
at 40. What should we do to sell the same boots shoe model without anti-slippery feature 
at 30.
1.	 We should add the same product twice, with the same photos, name them 
accordingly, and set the prices separately.
2.	 We should name the product as Boots Shoe Model with a price at 30. Then we 
should add thr Anti-Slippery feature as an option with +10 price.
Have a go hero – adding size option and its option values
A feature to select shoe size is essential for any online shoe store. So, it is now your turn to 
add a size option with several sample size option values, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and 9.5. Then, do 
not forget to browse the final shoe details page to see how it will look and check the added 
functionality for customers.

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 56 ]
Time for action – adding additional images for Reebok shoe
The more images we add for a certain shoe, the better they help a customer to decide about 
their final buying decision. 
1. Let's open the newly added shoe model in the Products listings page and browse to 
the Image tab. Then, let's click on the Add Image button.
2. We can add as many images as we want by using the small icon. After adding some 
sample images, click on the Save button to complete this process.

Chapter 2
[ 57 ]
3. We can see the other images of the shoe when we browse to the item details page 
and click on the Additional Images tab.
What just happened?
We have seen how easy it is to add additional images for a product. Generally, it is a better 
experience for customers browsing more images on an online shoe store and it increases 
the overall quality of the store. 

Categories, Products, and Options
[ 58 ]
Summary
Categories and product definitions are the core elements of a store. Being careful about 
designing a category, subcategory structure, and providing as much information as we can 
in product definition screens, all increases the effectiveness of an online store. If you have 
difficulties in organizing your store, just browse the Internet for similarly themed stores. This 
way you can get the base category structure and further customize according to your needs.
In this chapter, we learned how to organize categories and add categories, products. We 
have seen using the product options will positively affect customer browsing experience.
In the next chapter, we will learn about Tax Management, another essential part of an online 
store which affects the overall pricing policy of the store.

Tax Management
In most cases, the tax rate for an online order was simply calculated according 
to shipping location. OpenCart has an easy to use, simplified tax system which 
works according to geographic zones of customer shipping addresses.
In this chapter we shall learn about:


The basics of taxes according to shipping address


Types of OpenCart Geo Zones


Adding a Geo Zone


Assigning a Geo Zone to a tax class


Assigning a tax class to a product


Displaying prices without tax on storefront


How checkout pages change the final price according to different tax classes
OpenCart tax system
OpenCart currently only supports defining tax rates according to the shipping address. 
For this section, we will ignore taxes which can be applied specifically on the 
customer type (retail, business, and so on), product type (clothing, food, and 
so on), total order weight, and so on.

Tax Management
[ 60 ]
Let's assume that our online store is located in the UK (so, most of the customers are from 
the UK) and the store ships items to selected EU (European Union) addresses including the 
UK, Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. 
The following is a typical tax scenario for our shoe store (excluding shipping prices):
Understanding Geo Zones
Geo Zones represent the groups of countries or smaller geo sections under these countries. 
A Geo Zone can include countries, states, cities, and regions depending on the type of country. 
OpenCart uses Geo Zones to identify shipping and tax rate price regulations for a 
customer's order.
Here is an example:
In this chapter, we will solely need Geo Zones for tax calculations.

Time for action – adding Germany as a Geo Zone for taxes
In this section, we will add Germany as a Geo Zone for our store to be used in tax 
calculations. We will include all regions under Germany. 
1. Let's log in to the administration panel and click on the System|Localisation|Geo 
Zones menu item, as shown in the following screenshot. The administration panel 
is available at http://yourwebsite.com/store/admin.
2. The page will list the Geo Zone names that were added upon installation. Let's click 
on the Insert button.

Tax Management
[ 62 ]
3. Let's write Germany Tax Zone for the Geo Zone Name field. Next, let's write 
Germany Sales Tax Zone for the Description field. Then, we will click on the 
Add Geo Zone button.
4. We will select Germany and All Zones under it. Then, we click on the Save button to 
finish adding Germany as a Geo Tax Zone.
What just happened?
We have just finished adding Germany as a Geo Zone for taxes. 
We could select only a few regions from Germany if needed. Additionally, if we 
want to edit any Country and / or Zone definition in Geo Zones, we should visit 
System | Localisation | Zones menu in the administration panel.

Have a go hero – adding Rome, Milano / Italy as Geo Zone for taxes
Suppose that we only ship shoes to Rome and Milano in Italy and need to apply taxes for 
these regions. Define a new Geo Zone for these regions.
Tax classes
Tax classes include Geo Zones and they are connected to individual product items. A tax 
class can include more than one Geo Zone. You can think of a tax class as a connector 
between products and Geo Zones. 
Time for action – adding the Germany Geo Zone to the default 
tax class
In this section, we will add the Germany Geo Zone to the default tax class and will apply its 
tax rate price.
1. Let's open the System | Localisation | Tax Classes menu.

Tax Management
[ 64 ]
2. Taxable Goods tax class was listed. It was automatically created upon installation. 
Let's click on the Edit link.
3. As you can see from the following screenshot, this tax class includes UK VAT 
Zone by default in Geo Zone listings with a tax rate of 17.5%. Let's click on the 
Add Tax Rate button.
4. We select Germany Tax Zone from the available Geo Zone options. Let's write Sales 
Tax 19% for Description. We give 19 for Tax Rate. Finally, let's click on the Save button.

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
What just happened?
We already had a default tax class. It already included tax price for the UK Geo Zone. 
We have added the Germany Geo Zone as well and set its tax rate price.
Have a go hero – adding the Rome Milano Geo Zone to a new tax class
Now, it is your turn to add the Rome Milano Geo Zone to a new, separate tax class. Create 
a new tax class instead of using the default one.
Time for action – setting the tax class for a Reebok shoe
We will now see how setting a tax class for a product affects the overall price.
1. First, let's browse to the shoe example, which we added in the previous chapter, 
on storefront. Notice that the price is exactly the same as we had set in the 
administration panel in the previous chapter.
2. Let's open the administration panel and choose the Catalog | Products menu.

Tax Management
[ 66 ]
3. Let's Edit the shoe item on our store.
4. We browse to the Data tab, find, and change the Tax Class property to the 
Taxable Goods option. Do not forget to Save the changes.

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
5. We again browse to the shoe on the storefront and see that the price of the shoe 
has changed. The price increase is exactly the percentage of UK VAT rate, which 
was defined as 17.5%.
Now, carefully read the following section to understand why the UK VAT 
rate was applied automatically for this product even though there is also a 
Germany Sales Tax in this tax class.
What just happened?
An OpenCart store is installed by default according to the local settings for the United 
Kingdom and the products are shown on the online store with the inclusion of tax rate by 
default. This can be confusing for an international visitor. For example, a potential customer 
from Germany would see taxed UK price on the item properties page by default, which is a 
bad e-business practice. 
On the other hand, remember that some specific countries can forbid  showing 
prices without taxes for the customer. In this case, we have to show the tax 
value as well.
In a normal situation, we should better show the price of an item without tax rate on item 
pages and include the calculated tax rate on the final checkout screen.

Tax Management
[ 68 ]
Time for action – displaying prices without tax
We will now learn how to exclude tax prices from display on product pages.
1. Open the System | Settings menu.
2. Let's open the Options tab.
3. Notice the default Option settings for the store. We will select No for the Display 
Prices with Tax property. Then, let's click on the Save button.
4. We browse to the shoe information page and see that the price was set to without 
calculated tax rate. 

Chapter 3
[ 69 ]
5. A customer from Germany will see the corresponding Sales Tax 19% value only on 
the final checkout page. This is shown in the following screenshot: 
You can test this by registering a customer and setting the 
shipping address to somewhere in Germany.

Tax Management
[ 70 ]
6. On the other hand, a customer from United Kingdom will see another tax rate, 
which is valid for UK shipping addresses, UK VAT 17.5%.
What just happened?
We have changed Display Prices with Tax to No in our store settings. Using this method, all 
customers see the same price on product pages before going to checkout pages. They see 
the applied tax values only on checkout pages according to shipping address.
Pop quiz – understanding OpenCart taxes
Which of the following statements are true?
1.	 Each product can have more than one tax class in OpenCart.
2.	 We have to define a separate tax class for every Geo Zone we need.
3.	 Every product has to be assigned at least one tax class.
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned an essential part of an online store, tax management. Taxes 
directly affect the checkout price of a product. We have seen that OpenCart has a simplified 
tax management system that is based upon shipping address. 
In the next chapter, we will learn how to configure store settings and customize according to 
our layout needs.

Configuring Store Settings
Upon installation, a store was created with a default design and store settings. 
We need to change several settings for the store; it is especially important to 
change the store name, description, store logo, and welcome message. The 
store is not SEO optimized by default. We will need to change this as well.
In this chapter we shall learn:


Configuring General Store Information


Activating SEO support


Applying SEO for product pages


Applying SEO for categories


Installing OpenCart templates


Using Google Talk module for online help


Setting Information module for Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, etc.
General Store Information
General Store Information settings include store name, logo, welcome message, default 
currency settings, stock behavior options, several checkout, and price display options. 

Configuring Store Settings
[ 72 ]
Time for action – configuring General Store Information
In this section, we will learn how to configure the most essential general store information. 
1. Let's open the System | Settings menu. The General tab will be opened automatically 
and we will be able to provide essential general store information for our default 
store. We will fill the Store Name, Store Owner, Address, Email, and Telephone fields. 
Store URL is automatically filled in. We don't need to make changes on it.
2. We will now open the Store tab where we will fill Title, Meta Tag Description fields, 
lets not ignore these fields. These are included in HTML head section and help to 
improve on-site SEO. The single default template for the store is selected. We don't 
need to touch this section.

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
We will see Welcome Message section when we scroll down on the same tab page. 
We should certainly fill it. 

Configuring Store Settings
[ 74 ]
The welcome message is shown on the storefront, on the center, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
The welcome message field is a perfect place to inform 
visitors about the latest promotions and news about the 
store, as we can even use very advanced HTML designs 
here with images.
3. The Local tab determines how our site will behave for store visitors by default. 
We assumed that our store is California based and because of this, we changed 
Currency to US Dollar. We can choose the default Language for the store. Here, 
English is selected by default for both the storefront and administration panel. The 
Auto Update Currency option should be set to Yes if we have defined more than 
one currency. The values are retrieved from Yahoo Finance automatically each day.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
4. Let's continue with the Option tab. We want to show prices without tax value added 
on product pages. So, we have chosen to set the Display Prices with Tax option to 
No. This way, the final prices will be shown only on checkout pages. 
Please refer to Chapter 3, Tax Management for tax details. 
We have left Customer Group field in Default setting.
This is discussed in Chapter 9, Managing Customers and 
Users in detail.
It is logical to show prices all the time, not depending on whether a visitor has 
made a login or not. So, we have chosen No for the Login Display Prices feature. 
We preferred to automatically Approve New Customers by choosing No. This way, 
interested customers can buy immediately after registration without waiting. Finally, 
we have allowed Guest Checkout by choosing No. Some customers prefer to be able 
to shop without any registration process, immediately. 

Configuring Store Settings
[ 76 ]
5. For legal safety purposes, it is advised to show Privacy Policy and Terms & 
Conditions terms in account registration and before completing the checkout. It 
is a common practice on most professional online stores. The positive side is that 
no one actually reads them!
6. There are several Stock options we can set for a store. It is a common practice to 
not show the Display Stock quantity. We will show Out of Stock if the product is 
out of stock but also added Stock Status, stating that it will be available in 2-3 Days 
as default. It is advised to review an order before setting it to Completed status. So, 
when an order is processed, it will be set to Pending for our final review. If we want 
to track inventory, we would also use the Stock Subtract option.

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
7. The final tab is Image. We can change our Store Logo and use an Icon for web 
browsers. All uploaded images are automatically resized according to the following 
settings. So, we can change them according to our needs. Finally, do not forget 
to click on Save button. Please, remember that the Save button saves all the 
information on all tabs. If you forget it, you will lose all changes in all tabs.

8. This is how our store will look after setting several general store options:
What just happened?
We have just finished changing several general store settings. These included changing 
store name, logo, welcome message, default currency settings. Then we have changed 
several stock, price display, and checkout options. Finally, we have checked the main 
store page to see how these changes affected the overall look.
Have a go hero – testing store configuration settings
Now, register as a test customer to your store. Test every item in the Store Manager | 
Option tab to see how it will affect the customer experience by making sample orders. For 
example, Display Stock, Default Order Status, Subtract Stock, Showing Account Terms, etc.
OpenCart and SEO
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a group of processes which is applied for websites to 
increase their visibility in search engine results to get more qualified traffic. For an online 
store, it is very important to apply at least the basic SEO techniques.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
OpenCart system allows to provide a SEO URL for products with a keyword and inserts 
Title and Description Meta tags in HTML source of these pages. These are the minimum 
requirements for optimized SEO for most search engines.
For using SEO URL, we would require that our hosting solution has installed 
mod_rewrite Apache module and allowed us to change .htaccess file.
There is plenty of free information about SEO and SEO methods in Google. Just 
doing a search on these keywords will bring many useful sources.
Here are a few useful blogs about SEO:
http://www.seomoz.org/blog
http://www.seobook.com/blog
Time for action – applying SEO for product pages
In this section, we will learn how to activate SEO URLs and apply to products. 
1. Let's first browse to the product page and see how URL looks like before applying 
the SEO.
Notice that the default URL before SEO is parametric and this is not good for search 
engine crawlers.

Configuring Store Settings
[ 80 ]
2. Let's login to the administration panel and open the System | Settings menu.
3. We will jump to the Server tab and choose Yes for the Use SEO URLs option. Then, 
let's click on the Save button. 

Chapter 4
[ 81 ]
4. We will need to open cPanel and choose File Manager now.
5. Let's open the root folder of our store and choose the .htaccess.txt file there. 
Right-click on it and choose Rename.

Configuring Store Settings
[ 82 ]
6. We will delete the .txt prefix. Thus, we will write .htaccess for the final filename. 
Then, click on the Rename file button.
7. Let's return to the administration panel of our store and open the 
Catalog | Products tab.
8. Let's be sure that we have a nice, descriptive sentence(s) for Meta Tag Description. 
Most search engines take the first 160 characters of this field and show them in 
search engine results under the link to the page. 

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
9. Let's open the Data tab. We should only change the SEO Keyword field. Notice that 
we have used – sign between the words of the key phrase. Click on the Save button 
to finish.
10. Let's browse to the product page and see how URL was changed according to SEO. 
If you get an error displaying the page, you should 
apply the next step as well. If you see that the page is 
correctly shown, the SEO exercise is finished here.

Configuring Store Settings
[ 84 ]
11. Let's open the cPanel | File manager again and the Code Edit .htaccess file.
12. Just put a # sign in front of the RewriteBase / line. It will disable this line by 
commenting. Click on the Save Changes button.

Chapter 4
[ 85 ]
An alternative option is to include path information if we have installed OpenCart 
on a directory rather than root. In the following example, the installation path is 
/store directory:
13. Browse to the page again. You should see that the page is correctly displayed. Open 
the HTML source in your browser. Notice the following SEO tags are correctly set:
What just happened?
We have learned how to activate the SEO option in settings. We then activated the 
.htaccess file. We have added a SEO Keyword for a product and finally checked how 
it looked, both in store front and in HTML source. We have learnt how to apply another 
change in the .htaccess file if we get an error.

Time for action – applying SEO for categories
In this section, we will learn how to apply SEO for categories. Categories are also well 
indexed by search engines. So, it is also advised to apply basic SEO for them.
1. Let's edit one of the categories. You can reach the category listings under the 
Catalog | Categories menu. Be sure to fill in Meta Tag description.
2. Let's open Data tab and fill in SEO Keyword field. Be sure to put – sign 
between words.

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
3. Here is how the SEO applied category URL will look:
What just happened?
We have learned how to apply SEO for a category. 
It is very important to set a SEO Keyword for every category in the store. 
For example, if we apply a SEO Keyword for a category and forget the 
subcategories under it, the category browsing may not be working correctly! 
OpenCart and templates
Templates allow us to differentiate our store design. Some templates can also add 
new functionalities.
OpenCart has a very active developer and contributor community, which regularly releases 
new templates. There are both free and paid templates which we can use for our shop 
design. Here are some of the sources to find OpenCart templates according to the OpenCart 
version number which we use.
Be sure that you backup your files before applying any templates 
and choose the right version.

Time for action – installing an OpenCart template
In this section, we will learn how to upload an OpenCart template and activate it.
Note that it shows the very basic template installation. Some 
complicated templates need to make changes on main store 
codes as well. These changes are generally explained step by 
step in a readme file in the template package.
1. The following screenshot shows that we have uploaded a template zip file to the 
catalog/view/theme folder in our store. We should Extract it to this folder.

Chapter 4
[ 89 ]
2. Let's just click on the Extract File(s) button.
3. When we open Store Manager settings, we will now see that a new Template is 
listed. Let's choose it and Save the setting.

4. The following screenshot shows the main page after a new template was applied. 
Notice that there are only a few cosmetic changes to the design of the store.
What just happened?
We have just finished uploading and activating a basic template. 
We should not forget to backup our files beforehand if any code changes 
are required for templates in store codes.
OpenCart modules
In OpenCart, the left and right columns of the store are configurable by using modules. 
The following screenshot shows the Categories, Brands, Information, Shopping Cart, and 
Bestsellers modules:

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
OpenCart is installed with a bunch of default modules. You can add other free or paid 
modules according to your needs. 
www.OpenCart.com contributions and forum pages are the essential sources 
to find new modules and/or ask for new ones from developers. 
Time for action – installing Google Talk module for Online Help
In this section, we will learn how to install and activate the Google Talk module on the 
right-hand side. By using the Google Talk module on our store, the visitors can contact us 
at any time with any questions. It is a free and effective method of online help for a store.
1. Let's open the Extensions | Modules menu. 

Configuring Store Settings
[ 92 ]
2. We see that many modules were installed by default. We will need to click on the 
Install button near the Google Talk line.
3. The Google Talk module was installed. Let's click on the Edit button for 
further settings.
4. We need to paste Google Talk Code, choose the Position of the module, and set the 
Status to Enabled. Do not forget to click on the Save button.
You can get more information and install Google Talk

What just happened?
We have just activated the Google Talk module. Then, we inserted it on the top right of our 
store as an online help section. 
Information module
The Information module provides essential information about the store which includes the 
About Us, Privacy Policy, and Terms and Conditions pages by default. We can update these 
pages and add new ones if we need other informative pages on OpenCart.

Running Multiple Stores in a Single Installation
OpenCart allows us running multiple stores in a single installation. Now, let's learn how 
we can achieve this. 
Let's suppose that our first store is running at http://yourwebsite.com/store and 
we want to run the second store at http://store2.yourwebsite.com. 
Here are the brief steps to start running the second store.
We should first define the store2 subdomain using cPanel utility:
1.	 Open cPanel utility and browse to the Domain | SubDomain section.
2.	 We should fill SubDomain field as store2 as our store will run on 
http://store2.yourwebsite.com. 
3.	 We will need to change Directory Root field according to first running store's 
installation folder. In this case, it is /public_html/store folder.
4.	 Let's complete adding subdomain by clicking on the Create button.
The next part of setting up second store involves using OpenCart Admin panel:
1.	 Let's browse into System | Settings menu.
2.	 We click on Create A New Store button on the top.
3.	 We fill all the needed fields on all tabs to customize the second store 
with vital information like Welcome message, localization settings, etc. 
The most important setting is the Store URL field in which we should write 
http://store2.yourwebsite.com.
4.	 Let's click to Save to finish.
5.	 Now, we should assign individual products, categories by editing each of them.
Let's remember that we can only run multiple stores on different domains 
or subdomains. So, it would not be possible to run another store on another 
subfolder such as http://yourwebsite.com/store2.

Configuring Store Settings
[ 98 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how to change the basic store information. Customizing 
store settings and enabling SEO is top priority. Using the Welcome Screen effectively with 
a good template can also increase the overall quality of the store.
In the next chapter, we will continue by learning payment models which our store can 
accept. These will include PayPal, Cash on Delivery, Bank Transfer, and other popular 
payment gateways.

Setting Payment Models
Enabling a store to accept credit cards online and other alternative payment 
methods for customers is vital for high availability of an online store. 
In this chapter we shall learn:


The basics of online credit card processing


Merchant account


Payment gateway


PayPal as a payment method


The differences between several PayPal services


Bank Transfer, Cheque or Money Order, Cash on Delivery payment options
We should clearly understand the three core elements of accepting credit card payments 
for an online store before starting on the details of online credit card processing.
Shopping cart system
The shopping cart is special software which allows customers to add / delete products 
to a basket from a store catalogue and then complete the order. The shopping cart also 
automatically updates the total amount which the customer will pay according to product 
additions or deletions on the basket. 
OpenCart provides a built-in shopping cart system which provides all such functionality. 
So, you don't need to install or buy separate software for the shopping cart.

Setting Payment Models
[ 100 ]
Merchant account
A merchant account is a special account type which differs from a usual bank account. Its 
sole purpose is to accept credit card payments. Opening a merchant account requires making 
a contract with the credit card network providers. Authorized card payments on the store are 
transferred to the merchant account. Then, as a merchant we can transfer the amount from 
merchant account to bank account (checking account).
Since opening a merchant account can be a tiresome process for most businesses and 
individuals, there are various online businesses which can provide this functionality. 
We will learn about them in the next section.
Curious readers can learn the details of merchant accounts on the 
following links:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account
http://www.merchantaccount.com/
Payment gateway
A payment gateway is an online analogue of a physical credit card processing terminal that 
we can locate in retail shops. Its function is to process credit card information and return the 
results back to the store system.
You can imagine the payment gateway as an element in the middle of an online store and 
credit card network. The software part of this service is included in OpenCart but we will have 
to use one of the payment gateway services, which we will briefly review in the next section.
Understanding online credit card processing
The following diagram shows the standard credit card processing flowchart in detail. Note 
that it is not essential to know every detail in steps shown in a red background color. These 
parts are executed on behalf of us by the payment system which we will use, so it is isolated 
both from the store and customer. For example, PayPal is such a system, which we will learn 
about now in detail.

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
Let's explain the flowchart step by step to clearly understand the whole process:
1.	 A customer successfully enters into the checkout page after filling the shopping cart 
with the products. Then, he/she enters the credit card information and clicks on the 
Pay button. 
2.	 Now, the store checkout page sends these details along with the total amount to the 
payment gateway securely. 
3.	 The payment gateway starts a series of processes. First of all, the information is 
passed to the merchant's bank processor where the merchant account was 
opened before. 
4.	 The information is then sent to the credit card network by this processor. Visa and 
MasterCard are two of the most popular credit card networks. 
5.	 The credit card network processes the validity of the credit card and sends the 
information to the customer's credit card issuer bank. 
6.	 As a result, the bank rejects or approves the transaction and sends the information 
back to the credit card network. Through the same routing in reverse, the payment 
information is finally submitted back to the online store with a special code. All 
this is done in a few seconds and the information flow starting from the payment 
gateway is isolated from both the customer and merchant. It means that we 
don't have to deal with what's going on after sending information to the payment 
gateway. As a merchant, we only need the result of the transaction.

Setting Payment Models
[ 102 ]
After the information is processed by credit card network during Step 6; the transaction 
funds are transferred to the merchant account by the credit card network as shown in 
Step a. Then, the merchant can transfer the funds from the merchant account to the 
usual checking bank account automatically or manually, as shown in Step b.
OpenCart payment methods
The current OpenCart version supports many established payment systems, including PayPal 
services, Authorize.net, Moneybookers, 2Checkout, and so on, as well as basic payment 
options such as Cash on Delivery, Bank Transfer, Check/money order, etc.
We can also get more payment gateway modules on the OpenCart 
extensions section by searching in Payment Methods.
http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/
extension
We will now briefly learn the most widely used methods and their differences and 
similarities to each other.
PayPal
PayPal is one of the most popular and easiest to use systems for accepting credit cards 
for an online store. PayPal has two major products to be used in OpenCart through 
built-in modules:


PayPal Website Payment Standard


PayPal Website Payment Pro
Both of these payment methods provide both payment gateway and merchant account 
functionality. Let's understand the details of each now.
PayPal Website Payment Standard
It is the easiest method to implement accepting credit card payments on an online store. 
For merchants, a simple bank account and a PayPal account is enough to take payments. 
There are no monthly fees or setup costs charged by PayPal. The only cost is a fixed small 
percentage taken by PayPal for each transaction. So, you should consider this on price 
valuations of items in the store.

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
Here is the link to learn about the latest commission rates per transaction:
http://merchant.paypal.com
When the customer clicks on the checkout button on OpenCart, he/she will be redirected 
to the PayPal site to continue with the payment. 
As you can see from the following sample screenshot, a customer can provide credit card 
information instantly or log in to his/her PayPal account to pay from the balance in the 
PayPal account:

Setting Payment Models
[ 104 ]
In the next step, after the final review, the user clicks on the Pay Now button.
Notice that PayPal automatically localizes the total amount according 
to the PayPal owner's account currency. In this case, the price is 
calculated according to Dollar – Euro exchange rates.

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
After the payment, the PayPal screen shows the result of the payment. The screen doesn't 
return to the merchant store automatically. There is a button for it: Return to Merchant.
Finally, the website user is informed about the result of the purchase in the OpenCart store.

Setting Payment Models
[ 106 ]
The main advantage of PayPal Website Payment Standard is that it is easy to implement; 
many online people are familiar with using it. We can state one minor disadvantage. Some 
people may abandon the purchase since the payment gateway would leave the store 
temporarily to complete the transaction on the PayPal website.
PayPal Website Payment Pro
This is the paid PayPal solution for an online store as a payment gateway and merchant 
account. The biggest difference from PayPal Website Payment Standard is that customers 
do not leave the website for credit card processing. The credit card information is completely 
processed in the online store as it is the popular method of all established e-commerce 
websites. Even the customers will not know about the processor of the cards. Unless 
we put a PayPal logo ourselves, this information is well encapsulated.
Using this method also only requires a bank account and PayPal account for the merchant. 
PayPal charges a monthly fee and a one-time setup fee for this service. The individual 
transactions are also commissioned by PayPal.
This is a very professional way of processing credit cards online for a store but it can have a 
negative effect on some customers. Some customers can require seeing some indication of 
trust from the store before making a purchase. So, depending the on store owner's choice, 
it would be wise to put a remark and logo of PayPal stating that «Credit card is processed by 
PayPal safely and securely»
For a beginner OpenCart administrator who wants to use PayPal for the online store, it is 
recommended to get experience with the free Standard payment option and then upgrade 
to the Pro option.
We can get more information on PayPal Website Payment Pro service at:
http://merchant.paypal.com
At time of writing this book, PayPal only charges a fixed monthly fee ($30) 
and commissions on each transaction. There are no other setup costs or 
hidden charges.

PayFlow Pro payment gateway
If we already have a merchant account, we don't need to pay extra for it by using PayPal 
Standard or PayPal Pro. PayFlow Pro is cheaper than other PayPal services and allows us 
to accept credit card payments to an existing merchant account. 
Unfortunately, OpenCart currently does not support it as a built-in module 
but there are both free and paid modules. You can get them from the 
OpenCart official contributions page at:

In this section, we will learn how to configure PayPal Website Payment Standard 
on OpenCart. 
1. Let's open the Extensions | Payments menu in the administration panel.

Setting Payment Models
[ 108 ]
2. We will find the PayPal line from the available payment method listings and click on 
the Install button.
3. The next step is to Edit PayPal settings.
4. We provide our PayPal E-Mail address. Note that the payments will be made to this 
email address. So, be very careful to enter it correctly. We choose Test Mode as No. 

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
We could select Test Mode as Yes. If we do this, the online store will send the 
transactions on the checkout page to virtual test accounts, which we set on the 
PayPal developer system beforehand. Actually, we do not need to set Test Mode 
to Yes. There is an easy way to test the system with real transactions, as we will 
learn about soon.
We set Transaction Method to Sale. As a common practice, we set Order Status 
to Pending. Since fraud payments are common, we will have a chance to look at 
the details of the payment and the order, before announcing to the customer that 
his or her order is complete.
Set Geo Zone to All Zones and Status to Enabled. Finally, let's click on the 
Save button.
What just happened?
We have just finished enabling and setting up PayPal Standard Payment method. From now 
on, the customers can use PayPal or their credit cards to pay for the products online.
Have a go hero – testing PayPal Website Payment Standard method
Now, it is your turn to the test just-enabled PayPal Website Payment Standard method. All 
you need is to use another PayPal account with some balance on it and set some product 
prices as 0.01. This way, we can make tests on real PayPal transactions with small amounts. 
Register a customer and buy several products with this PayPal account on our store.

Bank transfer
We can easily achieve being able to accept bank transfer payments by activating a module 
in OpenCart. The order of the customer is held in pending status until the bank payment 
is confirmed.

2. Let's click on the Edit button.
3. We should provide our bank account information. The sample Bank Transfer 
Instructions are shown below. Set Order Status as Pending and Status as 
Enabled. Click on the Save button.
We could choose a specific Geo Zone to enable bank transfer solely for this zone. 
In our example, it is available to all customers worldwide. Notice that we can not 
have the same type but only separate payment options for different zones at the 
same time. It would require a third party module, which you can request or look 
for at the OpenCart extensions section.

Cheque / money order
With this payment option, we provide make cheque payable to information to the customer. 
The customer sends the cheque / money order to the store's default address by using this 
name. After we clear the check, order items are sent to the customer.
Cash on delivery
By using this option, the customer pays the money on delivery to the courier. We can use this 
option if we handle shipping with our own couriers. Some online stores also give the ability 
to customer to reject the order at the time of delivery. A common usage is with clothes and 
shoe stores. Customer tries the apparel and pays only for courier service if he/she doesn't 
like the product or it doesn't suit.
Have a go hero – activating cheque / money order and 
cash on delivery options
Now, it is your turn to enable check/money order and cash on delivery options. They are very 
similar to the bank transfer module and need similar fields.
Pop quiz – understanding online credit card processing
Which of the following statements are true?
1.	 PayPal does not provide a default merchant account. So, we have to open a 
merchant account before starting to use the PayPal Standard or Pro options.
2.	 To accept credit cards online, we have to make an agreement with a bank and/or 
credit networks such as Visa and Mastercard.
3.	 PayFlow Pro only provides payment gateway functionality. We should already have 
an opened merchant account before we start using it.
Summary
In this chapter, we have seen the essentials of online credit card processing and how 
a purchase is achieved as a result of complicated checks. Hopefully, we won't need to 
enter the details of credit card networks or merchant accounts. We have seen that 
payment gateways (with merchant account) like PayPal, Authorize.net can easily 
provide such solutions. We have seen how to enable PayPal and other basic payment 
methods for OpenCart.
In the next chapter, we will learn different shipping options and how to start using them.

Setting Shipping Methods
It is vital to provide the most affordable and high quality shipping service for 
customers. It is very common that many customers leave the checkout page 
just because the listed shipping method is very expensive. We should be careful 
that the sale price for items, plus shipping costs really cover our overall costs.
In this chapter we shall learn about:


Limiting orders to certain countries


Free shipping


Flat rate shipping


Per Item method


Weight-based shipping


UPS


USPS
Accepting orders from certain countries
It is logical to eliminate client registrations completely from the countries where our store 
will never ship the items. For example, if our store only ships the items to US, Canada, and 
selected EU countries, we would need to disable other countries showing in OpenCart. 
OpenCart has all the countries of the world enabled by default on installation. 

Setting Shipping Methods
[ 120 ]
Time for action – shipping items to selected countries only
In this section, we will learn how to disable country and zone definitions from OpenCart to 
allow registrations from certain countries only. Let's assume that we will ship products only 
to US, Canada, UK, and Germany.
There are two methods to enable/disable the countries for shipping.
Manual method
1. Let's open the System | Localisation | Countries menu. We will Edit the first 
country, which we will disable.
2. Let's choose Country Status as Disabled. Let's click on the Save button to finish. 

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
3. We should repeat this process for all pages of countries which we will not need, one 
by one. Note that it is a very time consuming process. 
Automatic method
1. We will take advantage of phpMyAdmin database administration tool which we can 
reach at cPanel. Let's open cPanel which the hosting service has provided for us. 
Let's click on the phpMyAdmin link.
We should be very careful when applying operations 
on phpMyAdmin. A wrong operation can damage the 
whole store structure.
2. We list the content of the database and see the tables in our OpenCart installation. 
The information for countries is in the country table. Let's click on the SQL link on 
the top menu.

Setting Shipping Methods
[ 122 ]
3. Let's write the following SQL statement and click the Go button to execute it:
update country set status=0
This SQL query will disable all countries in the database. 
4. Now, it is easy to enable just a few countries one by one at the administration 
panel. For example, we would enable the US like in the following screenshot. 
We will repeat this for the remaining countries—Canada, UK, and Germany 
in this case.

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
5. Now, if we try to register as a new customer, only enabled countries will be listed.
What just happened?
We have learned how to show a refined registration country listing for potential customers. 
Another alternative could be to also enable the countries which we plan to ship to in the 
future for registration. This way, we can retrieve the information of potential purchasers 
and send a newsletter stating that the store items are now shipped to their address.

For IT curious readers, here are the links for more information about 
phpMyAdmin and SQL queries.

Choosing a shipping method
The decision of which shipping method(s) we will use on our store is very important. 
OpenCart supports standard shipping methods including Free, Flat Rate, Per Item, and 
Weight Base Shipping and also enables us to use established shippers including UPS, 
USPS, and Royal Mail. We will cover the most important methods with examples.
Free shipping
In OpenCart, we can apply free shipping to an order. We can provide free shipping on all 
purchases without a minimum basket value or alternatively, a customer will see the free 
shipping option on the checkout page if his/her basket is bigger than our pre-defined value.
We should calculate the packing and shipping costs carefully before enabling free shipping 
since customers will not pay extra for it. Free shipping can be defined for all zones or only 
one zone. For example, free shipping for orders more than $200 for UK zone visitors. 
Currently, free shipping cannot be applied on multiple zones separately 
on the default free shipping module. For example, free shipping on 
$200 for UK, $250 for Germany and so on.
Time for action – configuring free shipping for 
all UK customers with orders of more than $100
Suppose that our store resides in the UK and we want to apply free shipping if the total order 
value is more than $100, no matter how many products a customer purchases. 
1. Let's open the Extensions | Shipping menu in the administration panel and click on 
the Install link near the Free Shipping item.

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
2. The next step is to Edit the free Shipping settings. Write 100 for Total, choose 
Geo Zone as UK Shipping, and Status as Enabled. Click on the Save button to 
enable Free Shipping.
3. In the following case, free shipping will be enabled since the customer shipping 
address is the UK and the order total is $180, which is bigger than the minimum 
free shipping condition of $100.

Setting Shipping Methods
[ 126 ]
4. In the following case, the customer did not get the free shipping option even though 
he/she is from the UK. The reason is that the shopping cart value is less than $100. 
An error was generated because there were no other shipping 
methods defined yet for the following situation. 
What just happened?
We have learned how to set up the free shipping method. Free shipping for orders more 
than a pre-defined value can encourage customers to buy more. Many established online 
stores use the free shipping method as a powerful tool for promotion and selling.
Flat rate shipping
Flat rate shipping is defined as when we don't want to deal with individual product or basket 
shipping rates. No matter the order amount, a fixed shipping charge is applied on it. As in 
the case of free shipping, it needs careful planning because some customers can order many 
products at once, leaving us with large shipping costs even though we only charge a flat rate 
for shipping. The common method is to secretly reflect the shipping and handling costs in 
each product price. Another alternative is to analyze sales and find the average order value 
and average shipping costs for the store. Then, a profitable flat rate shipping method is 
determined according to these values.

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
Time for action – configuring flat rate shipping for 
addresses in Germany
Let's apply $20 flat rate shipping for Germany addresses. 
1. Flat rate shipping is enabled by default on installation. If it isn't enabled, let's open 
the Extensions | Shipping menu in the administration panel and click on the Install 
link near the Flat Rate item. Then, we will Edit the flat rate settings. Write 20 for 
Cost, choose Tax Class as Taxable Goods, Geo Zone as Germany Tax Zone, and 
Status as Enabled. Click on the Save button to enable Flat Rate shipping.
2. As you can see from the following screenshot, a customer from Germany will have a 
flat shipping rate of $20 no matter the amount of the shopping cart. A $20 charge is 
applied in the same way for a $10 or a $1,000 order.

Setting Shipping Methods
[ 128 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to enable flat rate shipping for a certain zone. Remember that the flat 
rate shipping method value should be larger than average real shipping costs for the store.
Per item
When the per item method is applied, there is a shipping cost for each product in the basket. 
For example, if we apply a per item cost of $6, it would be $60 for 10 products in the basket 
no matter what the prices of the individual items. As in all shipping methods, it is possible 
to limit this shipping method on a Geo Zone.
Have a go hero – configuring per item method
Configuring the per item method is very similar to the flat rate method. Now, it is your turn. 
Define the per item cost as $6 for the US shipping zone and test the behavior on the client 
side by filling the shopping basket with several products.
Weight Based Shipping
Weight Based Shipping method applies to the overall weight of the order. The shipping cost 
is determined by ranges in OpenCart. 
A sample calculation would be:


If weight is smaller or equal to 1kg, shipping cost equals to $10


If weight is between 1 kg and 2 kg, shipping cost equals to $17


If weight is between 2 kg and 5 kg, shipping cost equals to $35


If weight is more than 5kg, shipping cost equals to $60
Time for action – applying weight-based shipping method 
for US customers
In this section, we will learn how to enable weight-based shipping solely for US customers 
with sample weight—price ranges.
1. Let's open the Extensions | Shipping menu. After this, install and edit Weight Based 
Shipping method. A general tab will be opened. We should choose the Enabled 
option in the Status field. After this, let's click on the US Shipping Zone tab.

2. Let's fill the Rates according to the following screenshot. After this, we choose 
Status as Enabled. Let's click on the Save button to finish.

3. Let's edit a product on the store now. The products are under the Catalog | 
Products menu. We click on the Data tab on the product information page.

4. Let's scroll down the  Data page until we find the Weight and Weight Class options. 
Change them according to the following screenshot:
5. Let's login to the storefront with a sample client with a US shipping address and 
create a basket with a weight of 1.50 kg. The Weight Based Shipping option for 
the US shipping zone with a value of $17.00 has appeared automatically, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
6. Now, let's increase the basket size to 3kg and check the page again.

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
What just happened?
We have enabled weight-based shipping for the US shipping zone with sample values. Let's 
understand the usage of rates clearly.
1:10.00,2:17.00,5:35.00,10:60.00
We should evaluate it like this: Up to 1 kg - $10; 1 to 2 kg - $17; 2 to 5 kg - $35 etc.
Pop quiz – Web Based Shipping Rates Usage
Suppose we are using 1:10.00, 2:17.00, 5:35.00, 10:60.00 as rates filed in Web 
Based Shipping method. 
1.	 What would happen on the checkout page if the client has added items to the 
basket that weigh more than 10 kg? 
2.	 Is it possible to enable web-based shipping for different zones at the same time? 
UPS
UPS (United Parcel Service) is the world's largest package delivery company and we can take 
advantage of using the integrated UPS module of OpenCart. Before doing this, we will need 
to register at the UPS Developer Kit website to get the username, password, and an XML key 
for communication of OpenCart with UPS.
https://www.ups.com/upsdeveloperkit
Click on the Register link to start.

Setting Shipping Methods

We haven't finished. Registering with the website is not enough. We should request an

Note that this would require either opening a UPS account or applying for a new one. 
You should contact UPS for opening an account if you don't have one.

Setting Shipping Methods

After getting the access key, we can set up UPS shipping on OpenCart.
We should continue working in Test mode until we are sure that everything works as 
we want, because we will be charged by UPS for every order in Production mode.

Chapter 6

USPS
USPS (United States Postal Service) is the official post office of the US government. 
OpenCart supports integration with USPS services. First, we should open an account 
using the following address:
https://secure.shippingapis.com/registration
After completion of registration, we will start working on the test server by default. Complete 
all tests there. After this, we will need to send an email to the email address which they sent 
us upon registration, stating that we need to change into production server.
After the change, we can offer USPS shipping for our customers.
Activating multiple shipping methods
OpenCart allows for activating more than one shipping option and customers can choose 
the most convenient one according to their needs. The following screenshot shows a sample 
checkout page with multiple shipping methods: 

Setting Shipping Methods
[ 136 ]
Customer Side – multiple shipping addresses
OpenCart allows customers to define more than one shipping address, but a customer can 
only use one shipping address per order. So, he/she has to order more than once to ship 
products to different addresses.
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how to enable standard shipping options and how to begin 
using established package delivery companies like UPS, and USPS. As you may notice, setting 
up shipping methods is not difficult; the real issue deciding which method(s) to apply. 
Shipping is generally the most problematic area for an online business and the success is also 
determined by the quality of the parcel service. The aim should be to minimize  the shipping 
problems to maximize the customer satisfaction.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to promote a store by using coupons, special bulk 
purchase discounts, item based discounts, etc.

Offering Coupons Discounts
There are many different promotion methods for an online store. The most 
effective methods are offering discount coupon codes on orders exceeding a 
defined value, setting discounts for certain products valid for a certain period 
of time, and even making discounts on wholesale bulk purchases. We will learn 
all the coupon and discount usages available in OpenCart.
In this chapter we shall learn:


Coupon types (percentage-based, fixed amount, with free shipping)


Applying discounts for certain products


Applying wholesale discounts for bulk purchases
Coupons on OpenCart
Coupons are one of the most effective promotion types for an online store. These are special 
short texts which customers enter on the checkout page to get discounts. 
For example, DISC100 could be a coupon code for a $100 discount, valid between the dates 
01.08.2010 and 01.10.2010.
OpenCart supports defining several different types of coupons. Let's learn about them 
with examples.
www.allitebooks.com

Offering Coupons Discounts
[ 138 ]
Percentage-based
Sample coupon code variants are:


Coupon code for 10 percent savings for all products


Coupon code for 15 percent savings for all products with a minimum basket value 
of $200


Coupon code for 4 percent savings on only a few selected products


Coupon code for 8 percent savings on only a few selected products with a minimum 
basket value of $200
Fixed amount
Sample coupon code variants are:


Coupon code for $25 savings for all products


Coupon code for $35 savings for all products with a minimum basket value of $200


Coupon code for $15 savings on only a few selected products


Coupon code for $5 savings on only a few selected products with a minimum basket 
value of $200
Free shipping
Additionally, we can offer free shipping and combine it with a percentage or fixed amount 
based coupon:


Coupon code for $25 savings for all products and free shipping if the order value is 
more than $300


Coupon code for 15 percent savings for selected products and free shipping if the 
order value is more than $200
Note that every coupon code is defined with a maximum usage value in OpenCart. For 
example, a $20 discount coupon which can be used maximum 50 times by customers. We 
can even limit the coupon usage per customer. For example, a coupon code which can be 
used only twice per customer, so for two orders only.

Time for action – defining a 10 percent discount 
coupon code for orders more than $200
In this section, we will learn how to define a 10 percent discount coupon code for orders 
more than $200. The coupon code will be available only for a month and will be limited in 
numbers, which is a maximum of 10 usages. Each customer will be able to use any number 
of them. The coupon will be valid for all products in the store.
1. Let's open the Sales | Coupons menu and delete all the coupons which were set 
upon installation by default.
2. Then, let's click on the Insert button to start defining a new coupon. On the coupon 
edit page, we will write 10% Off for Coupon Name; fill Coupon Description. Let's 
give the coupon Code as OFF10200, and choose Type as Percentage. Discount 
percentage will be 10 on Total Amount of 200. We will require that Customer Login 
before applying the coupon. We will not provide free shipping with the coupon. So, 
we select No for Free Shipping.

3. When we scroll down the page, we see that there are other important options. We 
don't select any specific Products. So, the coupon will be valid for any product in the 
store. We limit the coupon validity using Date Start and Date End options. In this 
case, it is exactly a month. 
We define that the maximum number of coupon usages is 10 by Uses Per 
Coupon field. 
A customer can even use all these maximum coupon 
number with 10 different orders. We have defined it 
with the Uses Per Customer field. 
Finally, we have chosen the Status field as Enabled. Let's not forget to click on the

4. The following screenshot shows before the application of coupon on the checkout 
page. Notice the Sub-Total value of $225.
5. And, after applying coupon code. Notice that the 10% Off coupon code only made 
a discount on the Sub-Total value. It did not affect the shipping method total.

discount was made on product Sub-Total value.
4. In the following scenario, we have tried to apply a coupon code to the shopping cart 
where the coupon code doesn't include the certain product we defined before. Let's 
emphasize that we could not apply a coupon, even though the total order exceeded 
is $150.

[ 146 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to define a fixed amount coupon with a minimum shopping cart limit 
to be activated on the customer side. Plus, applying a coupon requires putting at least one 
product which must be in the coupon coverage list into the basket. So, we should be very 
careful defining such conditional coupon codes because it can lead to customer confusion. 
It is wiser to create simple coupons.
Setting special discounts for selected products
Special discounts on certain products are like magnets for customers. They are encouraged 
to buy items with price saving opportunities. You will notice that almost all established 
online stores, including Amazon, apply this for a great range of products. See the following 
screenshot to understand how it looks on Amazon:

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
Time for action – applying a special low price for a product 
for a certain period
Now, let's learn how to apply discounts on specific products.
1. Let's open the Catalog | Products menu in the administration panel and edit one 
of the products. Then, we will need to change to the Special tab.
2. We will define two special discounts at once for this example, which will be run at 
different times. Let's notice that the first one will reduce the price to 15 for a certain 
period of time in April 2010. Later, it will be increased to the original price for the 
first 15 days of May. Then, it will be decreased again, this time to 30 after May 15.

Offering Coupons Discounts
[ 148 ]
3. The following screenshot shows how it looks on the store page. Notice that the price 
was decreased to $15 from $45:
4. In the following case, we applied the coupon code. 
Let's understand that coupon codes and discounts are totally 
independent from each other. So, a customer will be able to 
apply coupon code even after usual product discount.

Chapter 7
[ 149 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how easy it is to apply special discounts on products. We have also seen 
that we should be careful to apply discounts and coupon codes at the same time. It can 
lead to serious discounts on final shopping cart totals.
Discounts for wholesale
Another common practice is to apply discounts on bulk purchases. 
For example, if a product is normally sold at $50, we can offer to reduce the price of one 
item to $20 for orders of more than 30 in quantity.
In OpenCart, we can apply such discounts even at the customer group level.
Time for action – decreasing item price to $10 for 
order quantities more than 40 for special wholesale customers
We will learn how to change a customer's group, and define a wholesale bulk purchase for 
this group. For this example, we will decrease the item price to $10 for a order more than 
40 for this group.
1. Let's browse to the Sales | Customers menu and edit the information of a customer. 
We will change the Customer Group to Wholesale.

Offering Coupons Discounts
[ 150 ]
2. The next step is to open the Discount tab of a product. We will choose to apply the 
discount for Wholesale Customer Group for Quantity of 40. The discounted Price 
will be 10. Let's not forget to set the Date Start and Date End fields for discount 
validity limits. 
The priority  field determines which discount to apply if 
there are more than two discounts falling on the same 
period. The discount with highest priority is valid.
3. Let's investigate different customer scenarios now. 
Let's note that we should change the customer group of a 
sample registration to wholesale to make the following two 
samples work. We can do this by using the Sales | Customers 
menu and editing a customer's group to wholesale.
In the following case, the wholesale customer cannot get a discount because the 
quantity is under 40:

Chapter 7
[ 151 ]
4. In the following case, the unit price of the item was decreased to $10 since the 
shopping cart now has 40 of this item.
5. Let's remember that we defined another discount for Default grouped customers, 
which is $15. So, they will only see their own discounts assigned to the group, as in 
the following screenshot:
What just happened?
We have learned how to change the user group, and create a discount for a certain item 
which will be available only after a minimum quantity in the shopping cart. Let's also add 
it also that we are able to limit such bulk purchase discounts to only a certain group, as we 
have seen in our example.

Offering Coupons Discounts
[ 152 ]
Pop quiz – understanding coupons, and discounts
Decide whether the following statements are true or not:
1.	 We can create a discount coupon according to the geographical zone of 
the customer. 
2.	 It is possible to define different discount rates for a certain product for different 
customer groups. 
3.	 We can only offer discounts according to the total amount of the shopping cart.
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how to define and activate coupon codes. We created 
coupons with fixed amounts or percentages. We could limit the usage of coupons with 
numbers or according to the total amount of customer shopping cart. It is also possible 
to offer a coupon with free shipping.
We have seen that it is also possible to create discounts on selected products for a time 
period. OpenCart system also allowed us to define discounts for different customer groups, 
such as wholesale, VIP.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to handle orders, change order statuses, and inform 
customers about the order statuses.

Understanding Order Lifecycle
OpenCart order processing is much simpler than other commercial and open 
source software. Eventhough the features are not advanced, they are sufficient 
to manage the orders successfully without headaches.
In this chapter we shall learn:

Changing order statuses (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Completed)

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 154 ]
Order flowchart
Before starting the order processing details on OpenCart, let's understand what an order 
flowchart is. The following flowchart shows the main possible ways from the placement of an 
order by customer to the completion (successful shipment) on administrative side. We have 
especially neglected situations about payment frauds, cancelling orders, etc. for simplicity.
Briefly, as we can notice from the flowchart, we keep the order in Pending status until the 
payment is made (manually or automatically). If payment is made, we change the status 
to Processing. It means that we are packaging/collecting the ordered items. When we ship 
the order, the status changes to Shipped, and finally, we set it to Completed only after 
successful delivery.
This flowchart shows a typical order lifecycle. So, it is possible to change order 
logic, and delete/change/add new statuses according to website needs. We 
can edit order statuses using System | Localisation | Order Statuses menu.

Chapter 8
[ 155 ]
Placing the order
The order flowchart begins with the delivery of order information by the customer on 
checkout pages. First of all, we collect information about Shipping Method, Payment 
Method, Shipping Address, and Payment Address. As we can notice from the following 
screenshot, shipping and payment addresses can be defined differently. So, while shipment 
is made to an address, invoice can be sent to another (if needed).
We also get information about ordered products, their quantities, and the price on the order 
date. Note that all sub-totals are separately shown to the customer. In the following case 
there is a per item shipping rate, but it was cancelled by a $5 discount coupon applied with 
free shipping.
The customer can also apply a coupon code for the order.

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 156 ]
Finally, we also get extra comments which customer can provide us. In the following case, 
the customer stated that he or she needs the order after a defined date.
We have also provided information about payment. In the following case, it is a 
bank payment:
The customer is informed by the result of order confirmation on the screen: 
The OpenCart system generates an email according to the order and sends it automatically 
after the customer places the order. The following screenshot shows the sample order which 
the customer will get in the email box:

Chapter 8
[ 157 ]
On the administration side, we see a dashboard screen after the login where we can see 
the latest orders, total sales, total customers, etc. There is a statistics graph which is useful 
to have a look at the sales, and customer trends. This graph can be generated according to 
the ranges such as day, week, month, and year.

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 158 ]
We can edit an order directly from the dashboard or by using the Sales | Orders menu. 
OpenCart shows the order details in tabs for ease of management. The following screenshot 
shows the first tab. The Order Details tab shows the Customer name, personal information 
(email, telephone), order date, shipping method, payment method, order total, customer 
comment, etc. Let's note that the order website is also shown. As we already know, 
OpenCart allows for running multiple stores on a single installation. The most important 
section is Order Status. In this case, it is set to Pending for new orders. Let's remember 
that the default value can be arranged according to each payment type. In our case, we had 
arranged it as Pending for the bank payment option since we hadn't got the payment yet.
The next tab is Products. We see the details of ordered products and the sub-totals 
and total value:

Chapter 8
[ 159 ]
On the Shipping Address tab, we see the details of the shipping address: 
The Payment Address tab is similar to the Shipping Address tab. This is where we will send 
the invoice (if needed):

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 160 ]
Finally, we open the most important screen for order management. The Order History 
tab shows the original order date, and status. We will track all the changes made to Order 
Status in this screen. We will also use this screen to change the Order Status and inform the 
customer by email about the changes. 
Time for action – processing the order
In this section, we will learn how to complete an order step by step.
1. We have now got the payment with bank transfer. We will change the Order Status 
to Processing and inform the customer by checking the Notify Customer option. 
What we write in the Comment section will be emailed to the customer.

Chapter 8
[ 161 ]
The following screenshot shows what the customer will get in the email inbox:
This information was also recorded on the Order History page:
2. Suppose that we are ready to ship the order items. Now, it is time to Generate an 
Invoice ID. This is on the Order History tab as well. We can use this invoice as both 
a regular business invoice or/and a shipping invoice.

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 162 ]
3. Now, we can Print Invoice on the screen. Let's remember that an invoice is a legal 
document and shows the payment amount and purchase of the products.
The following screenshot shows the Invoice. Notice the information about our 
store and payment and shipment addresses, an the items in the shipment, are 
clearly shown:

Chapter 8
[ 163 ]
4. We should set Order Status to Shipped after real shipping is made. It is also a good 
practice to Notify Customer with a Comment in the email.
This is what a customer will see in their email about the shipping:

Understanding Order Lifecycle
[ 164 ]
5. Suppose that we have learned that our shipping was delivered by a parcel company. 
It is now time to Complete the order. We don't need to inform the customer since 
they have already got the products. 
6. We can trace all the steps on the processes of an order in detail on the Order 
History tab at the order details page.

Chapter 8
[ 165 ]
What just happened?
We have learned how to apply each order status step and inform the customer about it. 
The default order was Pending for bank payments. Step by step we have changed it to 
Processing, Shipped, and Completed. 
Have a go hero – placing an order and canceling it
Place an order as a fictional customer and suppose that you are already paid by Paypal. 
Cancel the order because you don't have enough stocks for the ordered items. Look at the 
pre-defined order statuses and change them accordingly on each step until you refund 
the customer. 
Pop quiz – understanding order flowchart
1.	 Why do we need two separate Order Status options, Shipped and Completed?
2.	 Can we generate an invoice and send to the customer before the payment is made?
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how we process orders. We have learned that the only 
screen we will use is the Order History tab at order details. We can change the status of 
orders, add extra information about order status as comments, and notify the customer 
by email if needed.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to group customers, change their information, and 
manage them.

Managing Customers and Users
A store can use the most advanced online store software, apply very good 
competitive prices, but still be unsuccessful due to insufficient customer 
relationship management. Thus, solving customer problems and grouping 
customers in segments are key for success.
An online store owner can need more than one login to manage different tasks 
on the store. For example, while a user takes care of orders, another can only 
enter and change information for products. OpenCart basically provides the 
ability to create new users with different permissions.
In this chapter we shall learn about:


Advantages of customer registration


Important customer settings

Managing Customers and Users
[ 168 ]
Advantages of customer registration
Although we have a chance to accept orders without any customer registration, there are 
very important advantages of storing customer information in the store both for the store 
owner and the customer.
Advantages for a customer
Once a customer orders from the store, it will be easy to track the status of the order on the 
website rather than contacting the store regularly.
A registered customer can view all the details of the previous and current orders online.

Chapter 9
[ 169 ]
It will be easy to order in the future after a simple login to the system, since a customer 
can create multiple addresses and select the needed shipping address instead of typing 
it each time.
If a customer is a regular buyer from the store, store administrators can notice the customer 
and apply special discounts. 
Advantages for the store
As a store administrator, we can analyze the customer behavior: find top paying customers, 
regular customers, and then apply coupons and discounts for them.
We can send regular newsletters and news about the hot deals on the store. This builds up 
the customer relationship.
We can group customers according to their behavior and shopping habits on the store.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 170 ]
Important customer settings
We have two vital settings in OpenCart which can affect the customer experience in our 
store, so we should consider them carefully.
The first option is whether we will require approval for new customer registrations or not. 
There is no email authentication system in the OpenCart system where a registration 
approval email is sent to customer and he/she clicks on it to approve the account.
Instead of this, if we required approval, a store administrator would need to approve each 
account one by one. As soon as the account is approved, an automated email is sent to the 
customer informing about them of the usage. Even though reviewed approvals can reduce 
spam registrations greatly, it can discourage customers from further using the store, so it is 
not a recommended method. 
The second option is whether to allow guest checkout or not. If we allow guest checkout, a 
customer can order from our store without registration.
Some customers still prefer guest checkout because it is faster and provides anonymity.

Chapter 9
[ 171 ]
Classifying customers in groups
There are two built-in customer groups in OpenCart, Default and Wholesale. By default, all 
new customers are linked to the Default group. We are able to add and delete new customer 
groups. The following chart shows a sample customer organization:
For example, if we determine that some customers are spending a lot, we can assign these 
customers to the High income level group and send them email messages about new, highly 
priced items in the store.
In another example, we can determine regular buyers and encourage them to spend more by 
sending special discount codes via email messages.
Time for action – creating a new customer group and assigning 
a customer to it
In this section, we will learn how to create a new customer group and assign a customer 
to it. By doing this, we will also cover the topic of how to edit and change a 
customer's information.
1. Let's open the Sales | Customer Groups menu and click on the Insert button.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 172 ]
2. We will write Customer Group Name and click on the Save button to 
complete the operation.
3. We can browse to customer listings under the Sales | Customers menu and edit one 
of them.
4. The new customer group now is enabled in the Customer Group option. Optionally, 
we can also edit other information such as whether the customer will get a 
newsletter or not. We can disable a customer from loggin in to the system without 
deleting from the database. We click the Save button to complete the operation.

Chapter 9
[ 173 ]
What just happened?
We have just learned how to create a new customer group and assign a customer to it. We 
have also seen that we can change important customer information such as Telephone, Email 
and whether a customer will get a newsletter or not.
Sending email newsletters
Email newsletter marketing is the backbone of an online store and it can greatly improve 
customer relationships. Offering useful product recommendations which customers can 
really think buying or sending product selection articles, guides is a common method. 
Research shows that opt-in newsletters have a high opening rate and convert better than 
traditional methods.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 174 ]
On the other hand, newsletters should be sent carefully because very 
frequent or irrelevant newsletters can be regarded as spam emails by 
customers. At the worst case, it can lead the customer to completely 
abandon the store for future purchases.
We can send messages to selected people by Search or all newsletter subscribers or all 
customers. Currently, OpenCart does not provide a function to send messages to selected 
customer groups.
Alternatively, we can use some open source, free software to 
manage email newsletters for customer groups. PhpList is one 
of the most popular ones. There  the details about it at 
http://www.phplist.com/.

Chapter 9
[ 175 ]
Adding customers manually
In some cases, we might need to enter customer information manually. We can achieve this 
by using the Sales | Customers menu and inserting a new customer. 
Let's remember that we are still not able to add or change customer addresses. 
Only a customer is able to do this by making a login to the store.
Have a go hero – creating a new customer group, assigning a customer to 
it, and applying a discount for this group
Start by creating a new customer group, and then assign a customer to this group. Finally, 
create a discount for this group and test it with sample orders.
Pop quiz – customer management
Decide whether the following statements are true or not:
1.	 As a store administrator, we are able to change customer addresses.
2.	 We are able to send email messages and newsletters according to customer group.
Users, user groups, and permissions
Users are people who do the administrative functions for our store, such as tracking sales, 
adding products, setting store options, and so on. They are different from customers and 
not related to them at all. 
Users are grouped in user groups in an OpenCart system. Each group can hold more than 
one user and each user can have different permissions inherited by user groups.
OpenCart operates in modules. It allows us to separately assign permissions at the 
module level. For example, we could assign access or modify permissions for a user 
on Catalog | Products and/or Catalog | Categories menu.
A user with access permission can view the module information but cannot change it.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 176 ]
The following diagram shows a sample user (login) organization:
According to this diagram, we can conclude the following sample permissions:


admin and admin2 logins can do anything on the store, including changing 
store settings, creating products, categories, changing order status, and defining 
payment models.


Since Julie is a manager, she can do everything except the things related to store and 
administration settings. 


Jack is only allowed to manage products. He can add, change, and view product 
information, but let's say that he cannot create a category or change order status.


On the other hand, Kate and Steve can only deal with the orders while they cannot 
change product information and cannot add new products.
Time for action – creating a new user group, Product Entry
In this section, we will learn how to create a new user group called Product Entry. This group 
will have only permissions to view, update, and create new products.
1. Let's open the System | Users | User Groups menu on the administration panel.

Chapter 9
[ 177 ]
2. OpenCart has a Demonstration user group which is created upon installation. 
We don't need this. Let's delete it from the user group listings.
3. After the deletion, click on the Insert button. Then, we will need to fill in the User 
Group Name field as Product Entry. We select catalog/product from the Access 
Permission listings. Let's do the same for the Modify Permission listings. Let's not 
forget to click on the Save button:
What just happened?
We have just learned how to create a new user group and assign permission to it. In this 
specific case, we have given permissions that are only related to product viewing, changing, 
and creating.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 178 ]
Have a go hero – creating a Manager user group
Similar to the previous section, create a user group called Manager. This group should have 
all functions (products, categories, coupons, discounts, sales, orders) except administration-
related items, that is, localization.
Time for action – creating a new user and assigning to a group
In this section, we will create a new user and assign this user to the newly created Product 
Entry user group. Finally, we will examine the user to be sure that the user can only reach 
product related menus on the administration panel.
1. Let's open the System | Users | Users menu.
2. Let's click on the Insert button. Then, we will fill in the user information. Let's choose 
User Group as Product Entry and do not forget to change the Status field to Enabled.

Chapter 9
[ 179 ]
3. We should now Logout from the system as we are using it as an admin.
4. Let's login to the administration panel with the user we have just created.
5. For example, let's try to open the Catalog | Categories menu.
6. As we can see in the following screenshot, we have got a Permission Denied error. If 
we try other menus except Catalog | Products, we will end up with the same screen.

Managing Customers and Users
[ 180 ]
7. Now, let's browse to the Catalog | Products menu. As we can see from the following 
screenshot, we are able to use this menu. Remember that we had assigned both 
access and modify permissions. This lets us not only view product information but 
also change it or insert new products.
What just happened?
In this section, we have learned to create a new user assigned to a user group. In this specific 
case, our Product Entry group user Jack could only view and change information under the 
Catalog | Products menu. The other menus are closed to this user and he gets a Permission 
Denied message if he tries to open them.
Have a go hero – creating a new user and assigning to the Manager 
user group
Create a new user and then, assign this user to the Manager user group which you previously 
created. Test the user functionality on the administration panel, especially on changing store 
level permissions, such as installing a new payment module.
Pop quiz – Users, user groups
Decide whether the following statements are true or not:
1.	 Each user can be assigned to more than one user group on OpenCart.
2.	 We can create a user with view-only access to all store administration panel menus, 
but without the ability to change anything.

Chapter 9
[ 181 ]
Reports
OpenCart currently provides very basic reporting functions under the Reports menu. 
These are as follows:


Sales Report, which shows the total sales between selected dates. We are able to 
filter out according to Date Start, Date End, Group By (days, weeks, months, years) 
and order statuses.


Products Purchased Report shows the best selling products with their quantity 
and total amount information. However, current OpenCart report version lacks any 
filters like date.


Products Viewed Report shows the most visited products by visitors in our store and 
their percentages compared to all visits. Again, it is a very basic one. 

Managing Customers and Users
[ 182 ]
We can ask for new report modules from experienced developers on OpenCart 
forums or specialized OpenCart module websites.
http://forum.opencart.com/
http://theqdomain.com
http://www.opencartmodules.com/
http://www.opencartstore.com
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned why we need to group customers. We have also learned the 
importance of newsletters and how we send them. We have seen how to open new user 
logins for the administration panel working on different permission levels. This helps us to 
share the workload of administration with multiple people.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to add new languages and currencies for our store 
using localization.

10
Localization
OpenCart is open to several local customizations. It enables us to operate an 
online store in selected languages and with selected currencies of our choice.
In this chapter we shall learn:


Finding and downloading a language pack


Uploading language pack files and inserting language definitions


Adding a new currency option


Arranging currency exchange rates as auto-updates from the Internet
OpenCart language packs
OpenCart language packs are free contributions from the user community. 
After major changes on the OpenCart system, users upload new language files 
to http://www.opencart.com/. We can browse this website to find latest 
language packs.

Localization
[ 184 ]
Time for action – installing a new language pack
In this section, we will learn how to install a new language pack in OpenCart. For our 
example, we will use Swedish.
1. Let's browse into http://www.opencart.com/ and click on the Extensions 
menu. Let's search the keyword swedish in the Languages section and then click 
on the Filter button:
2. We have found a Swedish Capitalize to fit with screenshot language pack. Let's 
browse into the Download tab and save the file in our computer by clicking on 
the Download button:

Chapter 10
[ 185 ]
3. Let's extract the contents of the swedish.zip file to the same folder on 
our computer:
4. As we can see from the following screenshot, we have now two folders extracted; 
admin and catalog:
5. Let's enter into the admin folder. We will notice a folder named swedish. Let's 
compress it as swedish.zip: 
6. We will do the same thing in the catalog folder. Let's compress the swedish folder as 
swedish.zip there:

Localization
[ 186 ]
7. Let's open File Manager in cPanel which our hosting solution has provided for us:
Alternatively, we could use a free ftp client to upload the files. Filezilla is just 
one of them, freely available on http://filezilla-project.org/
8. Let's first open the path admin/language in our OpenCart installation. We will see 
the already installed english folder. Let's click on the Upload button now:
9. We should upload the swedish.zip file which is found in the admin folder to the 
admin/language folder on the server. Be careful to upload the correct swedish.
zip file. After this, let's extract the contents of the swedish.zip file here by 
clicking on the Extract button:

Chapter 10
[ 187 ]
10. We will do the same thing for the catalog/language folder on the server. Open this 
server path and click on the Upload button:
11. We will upload the swedish.zip file from the local catalog folder to the catalog/
language path on the server. After uploading, choose the swedish.zip file, and click 
on the Extract button to extract the contents here:
12. Let's log in to the administration panel. We will open the System | Localisation | 
Languages menu:

Localization
[ 188 ]
13. We already have English installed there by default. Let's click on the Insert button:
14. We will need to fill in Swedish language information as shown in the following 
screenshot. You can copy and paste the following field values. Finally, do not 
forget to select the Status option as Enabled and Save.
The following information about Swedish can be found in the readme file 
in the archive file we had downloaded. Most language packs include such 
settings in a readme file as well.
Locale: sv_SE.UTF-8,sv_SE,swedish
        Image: se.png

Chapter 10
[ 189 ]
15. Let's browse into the store front and select language option as Swedish:
16. As we can see from the following screenshot, the store now operates in Swedish. All 
menu items and other definitions are changed to Swedish. Store visitors can do this 
at any time they want on the store front.
17. Additionally, we can arrange default local language settings in the System | Settings 
| Local menu in administration panel.

Localization
[ 190 ]
What just happened?
We have just learned where to look for different language packs for OpenCart. We have 
downloaded a language pack. We have separately arranged language files for admin and 
catalog folders. We have then uploaded them to their respective folders on the server. 
Finally, we have inserted the new language definition on administration panel.
Have a go hero – in running the store on your own language
Now, it is your turn to repeat these steps for your selected language. If you can't find an 
available language pack for your language, you can still write your own translations by 
editing language files on the server.
Time for action – editing the text in a language file
In this section, we will learn how to change the Manufacturer keyword into Brand on the 
product details page in the relevant English language file. The following screenshot shows 
the keyword which we will rename:
1. OpenCart has a very well designed MVC-L (Model-View-Controller-Language) 
based structure which helps us to easily change any files, including language files. 

Chapter 10
[ 191 ]
For coders who want to understand MVC-L software development 
principles more, try:

Other readers can continue reading the following section.
Every OpenCart URL shows the directory where related PHP files are located 
on web server. In our example, the product details URL is: 
http://www.yourstore.com/store/index.php?route=product/
product&product_id=49
What we need to do is look at the route parameter carefully. We see that 
it is product/product. This tells us that the language file which we will edit 
is located under the catalog/language/english/product directory on the 
web server and the file we should edit is product.php. The following 
screenshot shows this directory when opened by cPanel File manager. 
We will Edit this file.

2. The system will show us a dialog box to choose the correct encoding type to edit the 
file. For English and most European languages, it is not very important except special 
characters. In any case, we select utf-8 to not lose any characters: 
3. We find the line with Manufacturer text which we should replace: 

Chapter 10
[ 193 ]
4. We change it to Brand and click on Save Changes button on the top of the screen:
5. When we again browse into a product detail page on the storefront, we now see our 
new Brand keyword is there:
What just happened?
We have seen how to locate and edit OpenCart language files which we need to change 
according to the route parameter of the URL. 
English storefront language files are located under catalog/language/
english. In another language example, the path would be catalog/language/
italian for the Italian language. 

Localization
[ 194 ]
As another hint, the administration panel language files also follow the a 
similar pattern except that we need to browse into the admin/language 
folder instead of catalog/language.
Currency
OpenCart allows customers to choose from different pricing options if allowed by the store 
administrator. For example, you can run the store in USD, EUR, and CAD currencies.
Time for action – adding a new currency option
In this section, we will learn how to add the Canadian dollar (CAD) as a local currency option.
1. Let's browse into the System | Localisation | Currencies menu.
2. We will insert a new currency. Let's fill the needed fields according to the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 10
[ 195 ]
3. As we can see from the following screenshot, a customer can change the currency 
to CAD and all prices of products will be automatically converted according to the 
defined exchange rate:
4. We can also set the default local currency for the store in the System | Settings 
menu, in the Local tab. Let's notice that there is an Auto Update Currency option. If 
we enable it, all currency exchange rates will be updated to the newest values daily: 
OpenCart gets this information from Yahoo Finance 
website at the backend each day, automatically.

Localization
[ 196 ]
What just happened?
We have just learned how to insert a new currency option. In this specific case, we have 
added a CAD option and set the exchange rate to auto-update in local store settings.
Pop quiz – localization
Decide whether the following statements are true or not:
1.	 We can run a store in multiple languages in OpenCart.
2.	 We will have to update currency rates manually every day.
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned two essential localization options. By running an online store 
in multiple languages, we can both impress the customers and increase the availability of 
website to more people. Enabling multiple currencies also can help customers to evaluate 
prices correctly. It is true that a store running on the local currency is more attractive to the 
local customers.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to check updates and correctly update to the latest 
OpenCart version.

Upgrading OpenCart
It is wise to update our OpenCart environment to the latest version regularly. 
It protects our system against security vulnerabilities and allows us to use new 
features. It is also possible that the new OpenCart version will have several 
bug fixes.
Moreover, new versions can have new bugs. Because of this, it is a common 
practice to wait while a version with major changes matures and gets rid of 
serious bugs with minor release fixes.
In this chapter we shall learn about:


Making a backup of current OpenCart system


Downloading the latest OpenCart version


Uploading the new files to a server


Running the upgrade script


Checking whether everything works as expected or not


Restoring the OpenCart system if an upgrade fails or has serious problems
This chapter is suggested reading even for an experienced user. It will show us any 
possible problems that might occur while upgrading, so we can avoid them.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 198 ]
Making backups of the current OpenCart system
One thing we should certainly do is backup our files and database before starting any 
upgrade process. This will allow us to restore the OpenCart system if the upgrade fails 
and if we cannot solve the reason behind it.
Time for action – backing up OpenCart files and database
In this section, we will now learn how to back up the necessary files and database of the 
current OpenCart system before starting the upgrading processes. 
We will start with backing up database files. We have two choices to achieve this. 
The first method is easier and uses the built-in OpenCart module in the administration panel. 
1. We need to open the System | Backup / Restore menu.
2. In this screen, we should be sure that all modules are selected. If not, click on the 
Select All link first. Then, we will need to click on the Backup button. 

Chapter 11
[ 199 ]
3. A backup.sql file will be generated for us automatically. We will save the file on our 
local computer.
The second method to backup OpenCart database is through the Backup Wizard on cPanel 
administration panel which most hosting services provide this as a standard management 
tool for their clients. If you have applied the first method which we have just seen, skip the 
following section to apply. Still, it is useful to learn about alternative Backup Wizard tool 
on cPanel.
4. Let's open cPanel screen that our hosting services provided for us. Click on the 
Backup Wizard item under the Files section. 
5. On the next screen, click on the Backup button.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 200 ]
6. We will click on the MySQL Databases button on the Select Partial Backup menu. 
7. We will right-click on our OpenCart database file backup and save it on our local 
computer by clicking on Save Link As.
8. Let's return to the cPanel home screen and open File Manager under the 
Files menu. 

Chapter 11
[ 201 ]
9. Let's browse into the web directory where our OpenCart store files are stored. 
Right-click on the directory and then Compress it.
10. We will compress the whole OpenCart directory as a Zip Archive file. 
11. As we can see from the following screenshot, the compressed store.zip file resides 
on the web server. We can also optionally download the file to our local computer.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 202 ]
What just happened?
We have backed up our OpenCart database using cPanel. After this, we also backed up our 
OpenCart files as a compressed archive file using File Manager in cPanel.
New OpenCart version
Until OpenCart v1.4.7, we had to upgrade our system manually. Each new version included 
an upgrade.txt file to read first and apply upgrades manually. 
For example, this is a screenshot from the v1.4.6 upgrade.txt file:
Now, starting from v1.4.7, we are able to use a universal upgrade script without opening 
the phpAdmin tool to execute the SQL scripts manually. The web based script supports 
upgrading from any version later than v1.3.0 to v.1.4.7 directly. 
If we are using a version older than OpenCart v1.3.0, we will need to first upgrade all the 
versions in between until we reach 1.3.0. Then we can run this script. 
Now, let's learn how we will use the upgrade script.

Chapter 11
[ 203 ]
Time for action – downloading the latest Opencart files, 
uploading them to the server, and upgrading
We will now learn how to download the latest version of OpenCart and upload to our server. 
Then, we will run upgrade script. 
1. Let's browse into
http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=download/download 
We will save latest OpenCart zip file on our local computer.
2. Now, let's click on the Extract Here menu item to extract all the contents of a folder. 
3. We need to delete default, and empty the config.php file in the upload folder in our 
local computer.
Do not delete the config.php file on your web server 
by mistake.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 204 ]
4. We also delete the config.php file, which resides in the upload/admin folder in our 
local computer.
5. Now, let's add all the files in the upload folder into an upload.zip archive file on our 
local computer. 
6. Let's upload the upload.zip file where our store files are on the web server. Then, 
let's Extract all the contents to the same folder on the web server. We should allow 
re-writing of all files if we get a message about doing it.
The other solution would be deleting all files on the server 
except config.php and extracting the new files there.

Chapter 11
[ 205 ]
7. After the extraction is complete, let's browse into http://www.yourwebsite.
com/store/install/upgrade.php path. Here, we have assumed our OpenCart 
installation is under /store directory. If our store files are under root folder of the 
website, we should browse into
	
http://www.yourwebsite.com/install/upgrade.php.
The script will run and inform us about the result. The following screenshot 
shows the success page:
8. Let's browse into the storefront now and be sure that everything is working as 
expected. Also, let's open the administration panel and check the system settings. 
If there are any changes, let's apply them to the needed settings back.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 206 ]
What just happened?
We have downloaded the latest OpenCart version to our local computer. We have extracted 
the contents of the archive file and deleted two config.php files which reside in the 
upload and upload/admin folders. 
Then, we re-packaged all the upload folder content as upload.zip. The next step was to 
upload the upload.zip file to our webserver and extract this archive. We have re-written 
all files with the new versions. We have run the upgrade script and have seen the results of 
the upgrade process. 
Finally, we have controlled all functionality of the OpenCart system, both on the storefront 
and on the administration panel menus.
Have a go hero – exploring config.php files
Now, go and download the config.php files both from the store root and admin folders. 
Open them with any word editor and explore the contents. They include several path 
definitions which OpenCart uses and your database connection information.
Restoring to the original OpenCart version
No software is completely perfect, and OpenCart is no exception. Any upgrade process can fail 
partially or completely. This is especially true if we have manual changes on OpenCart system 
files, database structure, or have used several third party mods in the system. We will now see 
how we will use backup files to restore our OpenCart system when needed.
Time for action – restoring OpenCart system if upgrade fails
In this section, we will now learn how to replace OpenCart files and restore the database. 
1. Let's open File Manager in cPanel and find where our OpenCart files are located. In 
this case, they are in the store folder. Let's delete it.

Chapter 11
[ 207 ]
2. Let's upload our backup store.zip file here and extract the contents.
3. We now have old OpenCart files which are retrieved from the backup file, as we can 
see from the following screenshot:

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 208 ]
4. We can use the built-in Restore tool of OpenCart. Let's browse into the System | 
Backup | Restore menu. After that let's choose the backup.sql files which we 
have previously saved in our local computer. All we need to do finally is to click 
on the Restore button on the top of the screen.
If you have used the first method of restoring OpenCart database, you can 
skip the following section. Still, you can read it to increase your knowledge on 
cPanel Backup Wizard.
5. Let's open Backup Wizard on cPanel. It is under the Files menu.
6. We will need to click on the Restore button to continue. 

Chapter 11
[ 209 ]
7. Let's click on the MySQL Databases button on the Select Restore Type menu.
8. We will need to browse the OpenCart database backup file which we have already 
backed up before. After this, let's click on the Upload button.

Upgrading OpenCart
[ 210 ]
9. The restore wizard will run the contents of the SQL file in the archive. It will drop all 
tables in this database, recreate them, and reinsert all of the values. 
10. Now, we should check both the storefront and administration settings manually to 
be sure that every functionality works as expected. 
What just happened?
We first deleted all OpenCart files. Then, we have uploaded the backup file and xtracted 
the contents. So, we have finished restoring files. We have opened the Backup Wizard in 
cPanel and uploaded a database backup through the wizard. It has run and overwritten 
our database to old values which are retrieved from the SQL backup file.
Pop quiz – understanding OpenCart upgrade process
1.	 Suppose that we have accidentally overwritten current config.php files with the 
empty config.php files which are included in new OpenCart releases. What would 
happen if we run the upgrade wizard?
2.	 Can we upgrade any OpenCart version using the latest auto-update script which we 
can download on the official OpenCart website?

Chapter 11
[ 211 ]
Summary
As we can see, upgrading OpenCart is not a difficult task thanks to new upgrade script, 
but the upgrade process still needs a careful execution order. The most important thing 
is to back up files and the database beforehand. Also, we should be careful about not 
to overwrite working config.php files with the empty config files that come with 
new versions. 
In this chapter, we learned how to upgrade OpenCart on a web server and restore the old 
system if an upgrade fails.


Pop Quiz Answers 
Chapter 1
Uploading OpenCart Files
1
The correct answer is stated in b. Transfer utility is much faster and reliable since we 
need to send only one zip file and it will be extracted on server side just one click 
later. On the other hand, FTP client sends OpenCart files one by one and it increases 
the chance of interruptions on file transfer.
Chapter 2
Understanding Option Values
1
The correct answer is stated in b. It is logical to take advantage of options whenever 
possible. Adding a new product for every new feature would make both the 
management of our store and the customer experience harder.

Chapter 3
Understanding OpenCart Taxes
1
False. Each product can have only one tax class.
2
False. We can group several geo zones under one tax class.
3
False. Some products may not need any tax class. So, they can be defined as tax-free.
Chapter 4
Understanding SEO for online stores
a
True. It is wise to optimize the store for SEO and then submit to search engines for 
crawling. If we neglect the SEO practice for a long time and search engines already 
index the parametric pages; it can result in delays indexing new SEO optimized pages 
in good positions in search engines.
b
True. SEO URLs for categories work according to All-or-Nothing principle. This is 
especially true for category-subcategory relations. Forgetting to apply SEO keyword 
for a single category can break the store category navigation.
Chapter 5
Understanding Online Credit Card Processing
1
False. PayPal provides a merchant account for us.
2
False. We don’t need to put much effort to start accepting credit cards. Payment 
gateways which provide a merchant account will easily enable us accepting credit 
cards online. PayPal and Authorize.net are two of these popular services.
3
True. PayFlow Pro does not include a merchant account.

Web Based Shipping Rates Usage
1
OpenCart shows shipping cost as zero (0) in this case because it was not defined 
in Rates field. To overcome this problem, you can define Rates covering all possible 
user actions.
2
True. Weight Based Shipping method can be activated for every zone with different 
rates. Remember that multiple zone definitions were not possible with other methods 
like Flat rate, Free Shipping, Per Item etc.
Chapter 7
Understanding Coupons, Discounts
1
False. We can create coupons for all products or a selected list of products. In current 
version, it is not possible to create coupons according to geo zones of customers.
2
True. We can offer the same item at different prices according to customer group. 
OpenCart even allows us creating a new customer group. A common application 
would be a VIP list which buys regularly at the store. We can give more discounts for 
this group.
3
False. It is also possible to offer discounts according to shopping cart item quantity. It 
is especially used for wholesale customers who buy at bulk quantities.
Chapter 8
Understanding Order Flowchart
1
Suppose that we had shipped the orders and set Order Status as Shipped. But, what if 
the shipment doesn’t arrive to the customer due to a problem in customs clearance? 
So, Shipped status only shows that the items are shipped but not the results of the 
shipment. So, we need Completed as a way to differentiate the result. Furthermore, 
we can filter orders according to Shipped status to find the problematic shipments 
which didn’t change into Completed status after waiting for a long time.
2
It depends on what kind of scenario we will follow for our store. For example, we can 
generate the invoice before the payment and send the customer email address to 
inform about where to make the payment, for example in the case of check/money 
order.

Customer management
1
False. Only customers can change their own addresses.
2
False. We can send email to individually selected customers, newsletter subscribers 
or all customers. Current OpenCart system doesn’t support newsletter sending on 
customer group level.
Users, User Groups
1
False. Currently, each user can be a member of only one user group.
2
True. To achieve this functionality, we should create a group with all Access permission 
options but without any Modify permission options on User group creation screen. This 
method will achieve a global view-only behaviour.

Localization
1
True
2
False. There is an option to auto update currency exchange rates in settings.
Chapter 11
Understanding OpenCart Upgrade Process
1
The upgrade would certainly fail, plus OpenCart would stop running. Config.php 
files include path definitions and required for OpenCart running. Upgrade wizard 
would try to retrieve directory information from config.php files but would fail 
since the files are empty. So, we should not forget to have backup of config.php 
files under our hands in a safe place.
2
It is false. OpenCart automatic upgrade script supports versions higher than 1.3.0. If 
we have an older version, we will need to first apply all upgrades individually until we 
reach to 1.3.0. Then, it is possible to apply the universal OpenCart upgrade script.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order to 
continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, home 
to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering information 
to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open Source brand 
also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty to each Open 
Source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
