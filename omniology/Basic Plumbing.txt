BASIC PLUMBING 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
The simple skills required for basic plumbing are explained in
this project.  
  
It helps to have some metalworking experience.  
  
 
 
Take care when working with a blowtorch in loft spaces. Be 
aware that pipes take time to cool after exposure to the 
blowtorch flame. 
  
 
 
If you can undertake the basic work yourself, you save 
money and the inconvenience of waiting for a plumber. 
  
Basic plumbing repair needn't be a daunting task, all you 
need to get started are a few essential tools, a working 
knowledge of your system and an ability to identify 
problems.  
 
2  - Preparation  
Step 1: Familiarise yourself with the layout of your 
plumbing - this will enable you to identify the cause of a 
problem and shut off the water for servicing. 
 
 
 
Step 2: Locate the stopcock 
on the rising main - the pipe 
that brings fresh water into 
your home. The stopcock 
controls the flow of water a
is used to shut off the entire
supply in an emergency
stopcock may be found und
nd

the kitchen sink, beneath th
stairs or in the cellar or 
basement.  
e 
 
 
 
Step 3: Check if there are isolating valves on the low 
pressure pipes to taps, toilet cisterns and household 
appliances - these valves enable servicing to be carried out 
without turning off the mains. They are usually located next 
to the storage cistern in the loft.  
 
 
 
Make up a kit of basic plumbing tools and a set of spare 
washers to fit the taps and valves around the house.  
 
 
 
Keep your plumber's phone number handy in case you are 

faced with a serious problem.  
 
3  - Draining the system 
In order to repair a leak, run new pipes or service a toilet 
cistern, it is necessary to be able to drain various parts of 
the system.  
 
 
Water is supplied to a house under relatively high mains 
pressure. In most houses it is directed via the rising main 
pipe to a cold water storage cistern in the loft. A pipe 
connected to the rising main feeds drinking water directly to 
the kitchen sink. All other taps and fittings, including the hot 
water storage cylinder, are supplied indirectly by a low 
pressure gravity-fed system from the storage cistern.  
 
 
To drain the cold water kitchen tap and pipe: 
 
 
1. 
Close the stopcock on the rising main  
2. 
Open the tap to empty the short length of pipe.  
To drain cold water taps in the bathroom/to drain the 
cistern:  
 
 
1. 
Shut off the cold feed valve from the storage cistern
in the loft.  
2. 
Run the bathroom taps.  
or: 
 
 
1. 
If there is no 
isolating valve, shut 
off the supply of 
water to the cistern 
by tying the arm of 
the float valve to a 
batten placed across 
the top.  
2. 
Run the taps to d
the cistern. Use this 
method if you ever 
need to work on th
cistern itself.

6 - Cutting & joining pipes  
 
Most homes are plumbed with 15mm, 22
 
28mm diameter copper pipe. Joining pipework is basic to all 
opper pipes can be joined with brass compress
n fittings 
r soldered capillary joints. You can cut copper pipe with a 
hatever type of fitting you use, the pipe must first be cut 
erfectly square.  
To cut a pipe, lightly clamp 
the cutter on the pipe, with

If you accidentally drive a nail through a
the floor, you may not even notice for a while. The only 
indication is a faint hissing until, eventually, a damp patch 
appears on the ceiling in the room below.

8  - Thawing frozen pipes 
Uninsulated pipes exposed to freezing temperatures are likely to
become blocked with ice. This commonly occurs in cold 
uninsulated lofts. Garden taps are also prone to freezing. You 
may not be aware of the problem until the water refuses to flow 
when you turn on a tap.  
 
 
Old plumbing, especially the rising main, is invariably made 
from lead which, being a soft metal, has a tendency to split as 
the water freezes - call in a qualified plumber to deal with 
permanent repairs to lead pipework.  
 
 
Step 1: Trace the location of the blockage by following the run 
of frozen pipework.  
 
 
Step 2: Because copper is a good conductor of heat, you can 
usually thaw a pipe, using an electric hair dryer. Warm the pipe 
gradually, working back from the affected tap or valve. Treat 
old lead pipe in the same way, but warm the whole pipe evenly. 
If you cannot use a hairdryer, wrap the frozen pipe in hot 
towels.  
 
 
Step 3: Insulate vulnerable plumbing to prevent it freezing 
again. You can buy lagging bandage to wrap around the 
pipework, but the job is much easier using foamed plastic tubes 

split lengthwise to fit over standard size pipes. 
 
 
When insulating long straight runs, butt the ends of the tubes

At a bend, cut a series of wedges from the split edge to
together and bind them with self-adhesive PVC tape. Cut a tube
with a sharp knife to fill any gaps.

to bind and seal the tube in place.
