About the Author
Matt Krantz is a nationally known fi nancial journalist who specializes in invest-
ing topics. Krantz has been a reporter and writer for USA TODAY since 1999. 
He covers fi nancial markets and Wall Street, concentrating on developments 
affecting individual investors and their portfolios. His stories routinely signal 
trends investors can profi t from and sound warnings about potential scams 
and things investors should be aware of. 
In addition to covering markets for the print edition of USA TODAY, Matt 
writes a daily online investing column called “Ask Matt,” which appears every 
trading day at USATODAY.com. He tackles questions posed by the Web site’s 
giant audience and answers them in a plain-English and straightforward way. 
Readers often tell Matt he’s the only one who has been able to fi nally solve 
investing questions they’ve sought answers to for years. 
Matt has been investing since the 1980s and has studied dozens of investment 
techniques while forming his own. Before joining USA TODAY, Matt worked 
as a business and technology reporter for Investor’s Business Daily and was a 
consultant with Ernst & Young prior to that. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration at Miami University 
in Oxford, Ohio. 
Matt is based in USA TODAY’s Los Angeles bureau. When he’s not writing 
he’s either spending time with his wife and young daughter, running, moun-
tain biking, or surfi ng. 


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife Nancy, who has helped me do my best, my 
parents for urging me to do my best, my grandparents for inspiring me to do 
my best, and my daughter Leilani for giving me a reason to do my best.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Taking on a project with the size and scope as this book would have been 
overwhelming without the help of key people along the way. My wife, Nancy, 
is always there ready with an encouraging pat or a suggestion for the perfect 
word that is eluding me. My assignment editor, David Craig, and other USA 
TODAY editors have been supportive of my writing and journalism career from 
the start. Steve Minihan, a fi nancial advisor and professor for UCLA Extension, 
has provided invaluable instruction and analysis skills. Fane Lozman shared 
his options expertise. 
The team at Wiley has also been very supportive, including: Acquisitions Editor, 
Erin Calligan Mooney; Project Editor, Jennifer Connolly; and Technical Reviewer, 
Paul Mladjenovic. And again, a big thanks to Matt Wagner, my literary agent, for 
letting me know about this opportunity.
Finally, I wanted to thank my family for giving me the tools and determination 
to pursue my interest in writing and investing. My mom and dad taught all 
their kids they could achieve their goals if they always did their best and 
never stopped trying to get even better. And my grandparents are models 
of long-term success I continue to strive for.

Introduction
I
f someone gave you a dollar for every newfangled stock-picking method 
invented every year, well, you probably wouldn’t need a book on invest-
ing. You’d already be rich. 
Investors are constantly barraged with new ways to pick stocks and buy 
stocks. There’s no shortage of pundits, professional investors, and traders 
who all claim to know the best ways to invest. The trouble is, most of their 
advice is conflicting and often confusing. 
Maybe it’s this constant swirl of investment babble that tempted you to pick 
up this book. And if so, you made a wise decision. This book will help you 
get back to the basics of investing and understanding business. Rather than 
chasing hot stocks that whip around, Fundamental Analysis For Dummies will 
show you how to study the value of a business. You’ll then use that informa-
tion to make intelligent decisions about how to invest. 
While faddish stock-picking systems come and go, fundamental analysis has 
been around for decades. The ability to pore over a company’s most basic data 
and get a good idea of how a company is doing, how skilled the management 
team is, and whether or not a company has the resources to stay in business is 
a valuable skill to have. 
Fundamental analysis is best known as a tool for investors trying to get a 
very detailed assessment of what a company is worth. But you might be sur-
prised to learn you don’t have to be an investor to use fundamental analysis. 
If you buy a warranty from a company and want to know if the company will 
be able to honor it, that calls for fundamental analysis. If you just want to 
know “how well” a company is doing, you might also want to use fundamental 
analysis. And journalists, too, can use fundamental analysis to find stories 
that will interest readers. 
The aim of this book is to show you what fundamental analysis is and help 
you use it as a way to better understand business and investment.

Fundamental Analysis For Dummies 
About This Book 
Fundamental Analysis For Dummies is one of the most approachable texts 
to tackle this somewhat complex topic. Rather than bog you down with the 
nitty-gritty details that academics pull their hair over, I’ve attempted to lay 
out all the main topics and techniques you’ll need to apply fundamental anal-
ysis to a variety of business tasks. 
And while fundamental analysis is useful for anyone with an interest in busi-
ness, I appreciate the fact you are likely hoping to make some money from 
fundamental analysis. And for that reason, the book is largely targeted toward 
investors who are either hoping to use fundamental analysis to manage their 
portfolios or to enhance their current system of selecting stocks. 
As the author, I can share the tricks, tips, and secrets I’ve learned from a 
career writing about online investing for readers just like you. In the course 
of writing for USA TODAY, including a daily online column about investing 
called “Ask Matt” at USATODAY.com, I’ve answered thousands of reader ques-
tions that may be the same ones you have. 
Fundamental Analysis For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to access 
fundamental data, process them, and make decisions. The book, however, 
stops short at showing you how to actually buy or sell stocks by choosing 
a broker and entering orders. If you’re interested in the actual process of 
buying or selling stocks, that topic is covered exhaustively in my Investing 
Online For Dummies (Wiley). 
Conventions Used in This Book
I want to help you get the information you need as quickly as possible. To 
help you, I use several conventions: 
 
✓ Monofont is used to signal a Web address. This is important, since there 
are so many Web addresses in the book.
 
✓ Italics signal a word is a unique and important term for online investors.
 
✓ Boldfaced words make the key terms and phrases in bulleted and num-
bered lists jump out and grab your attention.
 
✓ Sidebars, text separated from the rest of the type in gray boxes, are 
interesting but slightly tangential to the subject at hand. Sidebars are 
generally fun and optional reading. You won’t miss anything critical if 
you skip the sidebars. If you choose to read the sidebars, though, I think 
you’ll be glad you did.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to read it from begin-
ning to end (any more than you have to read a dictionary from beginning to 
end to get what you need from it). If you’re in a hurry, you can even skip cer-
tain pieces of information and still get the gist of what you need. Here’s what 
you can safely skip: 
 
✓ Anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon: For more on this icon, 
see the “Icons Used in This Book” section, later in this Introduction. 
 
✓ Text in gray boxes, which are known as sidebars: Sidebars contain 
interesting — but not essential — information. 
 
✓ The copyright page: Sure, the publisher’s attorneys’ feelings will be 
hurt, but you can skip the fine print without missing out on anything 
important. Shh! I won’t tell. 
Foolish Assumptions
No matter your skill or experience level with investing, you can get some-
thing out of Fundamental Analysis For Dummies. I’m fully aware that for a vast 
majority of the public, the sight of tables of numbers in an annual report is 
boring at best — and scary at worst. The first part of the book is designed 
for you if you’re curious about fundamental analysis and wondering why it’s 
a common tool used by successful professional investors. Hoping to spare 
you from technical terms, I stick to plain English as much as possible. (When 
I have no choice but to use investing jargon, I tell you what it means.) But I 
also assume more advanced investors might pick up this book too, looking to 
discover a few things they didn’t already know about fundamental analysis. 
The book takes on more advanced topics as you progress through it, and it 
carefully selects online resources that will add new tools to your investing 
toolbox. 
How the Book Is Organized
All the chapters in this book are self-contained and can be read by them-
selves. If you’ve been dying to learn how to do a discounted cash flow analy-
sis, go on, skip ahead and dive in. Believe it or not, the discounted cash flow 
analysis is one of the most common things USA TODAY readers ask me about. 
Jump around. Flip through. Scan the index and find topics you’ve been dying

Fundamental Analysis For Dummies 
to read about for years. And don’t fear that you’ll get in over your head if 
you read the back of the book first. If there are concepts you need to know at 
any point, I’ve carefully added references to those pages in the book, so you 
can jump around. This book is a reference, and you shouldn’t feel as if you 
need to suffer through topics you already know or don’t care to know. With 
that said, though, the book is assembled in a logical order. My goal is to start 
simple, and then ramp things up as the book goes on. 
The book is divided into five parts, and the following sections give you a brief 
description of what you can find within each part.
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis 
Is and Why You Should Use It
If you’ve heard investors talk about fundamental analysis, but were never 
quite sure what it was, this part is for you. You’ll discover not only what fun-
damental analysis is, but also why it’s so powerful. You’ll even find out how 
fundamental analysis might help boost your investment success even if you 
have other methods of buying and selling stocks. After reading the chapters 
in this part, you should have a good idea of what’s entailed in fundamental 
analysis and how it can benefit you.
Part II: How to Perform 
Fundamental Analysis
Here’s where we roll up our sleeves and start getting into specifics. 
Fundamental analysis starts with the fundamental data companies provide 
about themselves. You’ll uncover what kinds of data companies generate and 
provide to the public, as well as what the numbers mean. And rather than set-
ting you on a wild goose chase to find the data yourself, I give you very spe-
cific instructions on the best ways to retrieve all the fundamental data you’ll 
need. In this part, too, you’ll get an understanding of how to start not just 
reading fundamental data, but digging in and gleaning insights from them. 
Part III: Making Money from 
Fundamental Analysis
Look. I’m not going to flatter myself and believe you’re reading this book 
because you want to read all my clever analogies. You’re probably interested 
in fundamental analysis because you want to make money or at least get a

 Introduction
better understanding on how to gauge the health and success of companies. 
Investors who use fundamental analysis to get a solid understanding of busi-
nesses and their values get a huge advantage over those who blindly chase 
stocks. In this part, you’ll get exposed to some of the more advanced tech-
niques fundamental analysts use to get insights about companies that aren’t 
apparent to some investors. 
Part IV: Getting Advanced with 
Fundamental Analysis
The chapters in this part take fundamental analysis even further, highlighting 
some of the more thorough techniques available. You’ll find how to analyze 
an industry, the broad economy, and even how to marry fundamental analy-
sis with other methods of evaluating investments. 
Part V: The Part of Tens
The tens chapters break down concepts in a top-ten list structure. You can 
discover what financial secrets fundamental analysis allows you to uncover 
(Chapter 20), you can zero in on the things you should look at when analyz-
ing a company (Chapter 21), and you can find out once and for all what fun-
damental analysis can’t do (Chapter 22). 
Icons Used in This Book
When you’re flipping through this book, you might notice several icons that 
catch your attention. That’s done on purpose. I use several distinct icons to 
alert you to sections of the book that stand out. Those icons are
 
These icons highlight info that you should etch on the top of your brain and 
never forget, even when you’re getting caught up in the excitement of 
fundamental analysis.
 
Read these sections to quickly pick up insider secrets that can boost your suc-
cess with fundamental analysis.

Fundamental Analysis For Dummies 
 
Some of the things covered in the book get a bit hairy and complicated. This 
icon flags such sections for two reasons. First, you may decide to avoid the 
headache and skip over them, since the info isn’t vital to your understanding 
of fundamental analysis. Second, the icon is a heads-up that the paragraph is 
probably loaded with investment jargon. Don’t be embarrassed if you need to 
read the section a second or third time. Hey, you didn’t want this book to be 
too easy, did you?
 
Avoid the landmines scattered throughout Wall Street that can decimate your 
good intentions at building wealth with these sections. 
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a new investor or just curious about fundamental analysis, you might 
consider starting from the beginning. That way, you’ll be ready for some of 
the more advanced topics I introduce later in the book. If you’ve already 
been using fundamental analysis or wondering if fundamental analysis might 
enhance a strategy you think is working for you, you might skip to Part II. 
And if you’re dying to know about a specific topic, there’s nothing wrong with 
looking up those terms in the index and flipping to the appropriate pages. 

Part I
What Fundamental 
Analysis Is and 
Why You Should 
Use It

In this part . . .
I
f you’re not sure what fundamental analysis is or how it 
can help you invest, this part is for you. In this part, I 
define fundamental analysis and explain how understanding 
how a company makes money can help you make money. 
You find out how fundamental analysis compares with other 
ways of investing and get a quick description of how some 
successful investors put fundamental analysis to work. 
Lastly, give you a quick rundown on the accounting that 
companies use to record their fundamentals for all to see.

B
efore you gulp down that neon-colored energy drink or pour yourself 
a bowl of super-sweetened cereal that looks like it was made by Willy 
Wonka himself, you probably do something first. More times than not, you just 
might take a glance at the nutrition label that spells out what’s in the box. 
You might not know what guar gum, guarana, or other ingredients that often 
show up on the labels of such processed foods are, but you can get a pretty 
good idea of what’s good for you and what’s not. If a bottle of apple juice, for 
instance, has a list of ingredients longer than your arm and is filled with stuff 
you can’t pronounce, you know you’re not drinking squeezed apples. Being 
aware of what’s in a food may or may not sway your decision to eat it, but at 
least you know what you’re putting into your body. 
Companies and stocks, too, come with similar labels. All companies that are 
publicly traded, or that lure money from the investing public, are required to 
disclose what they’re all about. Just as food processors must list all the ingre-
dients that go into their products, companies must tell investors what they’re 
composed of. 
Unfortunately, though, a giant multinational company can’t put all the infor-
mation investors need to know inside a tiny rectangle as food companies can. 
Instead, the key elements that make up a company are broken down at length 
in a series of financial statements and other sources of fundamental data. 

10
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Reading these critical financial statements and gleaning insights from them 
are the most basic goals of fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis is the 
skill of reading through all the information companies provide about them-
selves to make intelligent decisions. Just as you’d want to know what’s in that 
Frankenfood you’re about to bite into, you want to know what’s in an invest-
ment you’re thinking about adding to your portfolio. 
Why Bother with Fundamental Analysis?
You might wonder why you need to hassle with fundamental analysis. After 
all, at every family picnic there’s undoubtedly the loudmouthed relative 
who’s filled with all sorts of can’t-go-wrong stock tips. Why bother with tech-
nical things like net income or discounted cash flow analysis when you can 
just turn on the TV, write down a couple of stock symbols, buy the stocks and 
hope for the best? 
Similarly, you might figure learning how companies operate is just needless 
information. After all, you don’t need to know about fuel injection systems, 
suspensions, and car battery technology to drive a car. And you don’t need 
to know what’s going on behind the curtain to enjoy a play. Some investors 
figure they can just pick a couple of hot stocks, buy them, and drive off to 
riches. 
 
If the vicious bear market that began in 2007 taught investors anything, it’s 
that blindly buying stocks just because you might “like” a company or its 
products was hardly a sound way to tune up a portfolio. Chasing hunches and 
personal opinion about stocks is often not a great way to invest, as you’ll find 
out in Chapter 20. 
Some of the real values of 
fundamental analysis
Ever notice how there’s always a new wonder diet promising to make you 
skinny, and a new pill to make you healthier? More times than not, though, it 
seems these things never work. Getting healthy comes back to the basics — a 
balanced diet and exercise. 
The same goes with investing. Believe it or not, investing can be somewhat 
full of fads. There’s always a new investment pundit or economist with a new 
way to pick winning stocks. And just as an hour on the treadmill will do you 

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Fundamental Analysis
more good than a bottle full of miracle pills, successfully choosing stocks 
often comes back to fundamental analysis. 
Fundamental analysis is the classic way to examine companies and invest-
ments for a variety of reasons, including the fact it is: 
 
✓ Based on fact, not opinion: It’s easy to get caught up in general enthu-
siasm about what a company is doing or the products it’s selling. But 
fundamental analysis blinds you to this investment hype and gets you 
focused on cold-hard business realities. It doesn’t matter if all the kids 
in your neighborhood are buying a company’s products, if the company 
isn’t making any money at selling them. 
 
✓ Good at pinpointing shifts in the business’ health: If a company’s suc-
cess is starting to fade, you’ll see it show up on the fundamentals. No, 
there won’t be a giant sign saying “Sell this stock.” But there are clues if 
you know how to look, as you’ll discover in Chapter 18. Companies are 
required to disclose key aspects of their business, so if there’s a prob-
lem, a fundamental analyst will often be early at spotting some trouble. 
 
✓ All about execution: Companies’ CEOs are usually good at getting inves-
tors focused on the future and how things are going to get better next 
quarter. But the fundamentals are based in reality. Just think of children 
who say how hard they’re working at school. The report card is still the 
tangible evidence of how things are actually going. 
 
✓ A way to put price tags on companies: What’s a painting worth? What’s 
a used car worth? Just as with anything else with subjective value, 
the price is generally what someone is willing to pay for it. The stock 
market, an auction of buyers and sellers, does a good job putting price 
tags on companies. But fundamental analysis gives you another way to 
see just how much investors, by buying or selling stock, are paying for a 
stock. 
Driving home an example
One of the best recent examples of how fundamental analysis can help you 
and your portfolio is General Motors. For decades, GM represented the might 
of U.S. industriousness, know-how, and creativity. GM commanded a mas-
sive market value of $3.5 billion in 1928, says Standard & Poor’s. I’ll step you 
through what market value means in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, 
just know that GM was the most valuable company by far in 1928. 

12
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
For decades, investors figured a dollar invested in GM was money in the 
bank. The company slugged through upturns and downturns and was a last-
ing power that helped drive the U.S. economy. The company kept paying fat 
dividends and kept powering profits higher. 
But investors who blindly bet GM would remain a lasting force and ignored 
the fundamental signs of trouble suffered a brutal blow on June 1, 2009. On 
that day, which will forever remain one of the lowlights of capitalism, GM 
became the fourth-largest public company to seek bankruptcy protection, 
according to BankruptcyData.com. Shares of GM stock collapsed to just 75 
cents a share, down 97% from their level just three years before.
Fundamental analysis may not have helped you predict this shocking out-
come of GM. Concrete elements from the company’s financial statements, 
though, could have tipped you off to just how challenged GM was well before 
it became a penny stock. 
GM vs. Ford 
Even months before GM filed for bankruptcy 
protection, fundamental analysis could have 
served you well. 
Back in January 2009, seeing both GM and Ford 
facing intense financial strain, many investors 
wondered if either one was worth taking a bet 
on. Some helpful fundamental analysis tools, 
including an analysis of the statement of cash 
flows, could have determined whether you lost 
a fortune or enjoyed a big gain. 
I’ll show you how to read the statement of cash 
flow in detail in Chapter 7. But for now, I’m just 
giving you a real example of why fundamental 
analysis matters to whet your appetite. At the 
beginning of 2009, both Ford and GM were con-
stantly in the news. Both faced a tough busi-
ness climate and both had depressed stock 
prices: Ford began 2009 at $2.46 a share and 
GM $3.65. 
But a quick fundamental analysis showed Ford 
was the much better bet. Ford ended the quarter 
with $27.5 billion in cash and burnt $600 million 
in cash. Don’t let the numbers scare you at this 
point. I’m just exposing you to a basic free cash 
flow analysis, as you’ll learn about later. Just for 
now, know that at the quarterly rate, Ford had 
enough cash to last nearly 46 quarters. 
Over at GM, however, the company ended 
the quarter with just $15.9 billion in cash. 
Meanwhile, it burnt through $8.9 billion during 
the quarter. A fundamental analyst knew right 
away the company wasn’t going to make it 
through the year at that rate. That’s critical 
information to have known.
Knowing how to do this one type of fundamen-
tal analysis may make a world of difference 
for investors. In the following six months, 
shares of Ford jumped 149% to $6.13. Ford 
also did not accept government funding assis-
tance. Meanwhile, shares of GM crashed 79% 
to 75 cents. 
Makes you want to read the rest of the book, 
doesn’t it?

 Chapter 1: Understanding Fundamental Analysis
Putting fundamental analysis to work
It’s easy to get consumed with the fast-money trading aspects of stocks. 
Exciting TV reports about stocks on the move and companies that have new 
products practically turn investing into a sporting event. In fact, if you listen 
to some traders talk, they rattle off companies’ ticker symbols in rapid-fire 
delivery just as sports fans talk about teams. Flashing arrows and rapid trad-
ing can become an addiction for people who get into it. 
And it’s exactly the headache and insanity fundamental analysis is trying 
to help you avoid. After all, stocks rise and fall each minute, day, and week 
based on a random flow of news. The constant ups and downs of stocks can 
sometimes confound logic and reason. Many readers of my Ask Matt column 
at USATODAY.com are baffled when a stock falls even after the company 
reports what appears to be good news. Trying to profit from these short-term 
swings is a game for gamblers and speculators. It’s futile on a long-term basis. 
But that’s not to say investing is gambling. Remember that those stock sym-
bols you see flashing red and green aren’t dice, horses, or cards. They’re 
more than just the two, three, or four letters of their ticker symbol. 
When you buy a stock, you’re buying a piece of ownership in companies that 
make and sell products and services. You’re buying a claim to the companies’ 
future profits. Owning a piece of a real business over time isn’t gambling, it’s 
capitalism. 
 
Fundamental analysis forces you to focus on investing in businesses, not stocks. 
You’re not buying a lottery ticket, but a piece of ownership in a company. 
If jumping in and out of stocks at the right time isn’t the way to riches, then 
what is the trick to successful investing? The answer is to stop thinking of 
stocks as just symbols that gyrate each day. The goal of fundamental analysis 
is to help you step away from the short-term trading and gambling of stocks. 
Instead, you approach investing as if you’re buying a business, not rolling the 
dice. 
Fundamental analysis ideally helps you identify businesses that sell goods 
and services for more than what they paid to produce them. Fundamental 
analysis is your tool to evaluate how good a company is at turning raw mate-
rials into profits. 
Certainly, famed investor Warren Buffett is one of the best-known users of 
fundamental analysis. You will read more about how Buffett applies funda-
mental analysis to investing in Chapter 3. 

14
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
No matter how you choose investments currently, you can likely apply funda-
mental analysis. Even if you’re the kind of investor who likes to buy diversified 
mutual funds and hold onto them forever, called a passive investor, it can be 
helpful to understand basic financial characteristics of the companies. 
Knowing what fundamentals to look for
Knowing what makes a company tick isn’t as convoluted as it may sound. 
Companies are so regulated and scrutinized, all the things you need to pay 
attention to are usually listed and published for all to see. Generally, when 
you hear about a company’s fundamentals, the key elements to be concerned 
with fall into several categories including:
 
✓ Financial performance: Here you’re looking at how much a company 
collects from customers who buy its products or services, and how 
much it keeps in profit. Terms you probably hear quite a bit about, such 
as earnings and revenue, are examples of ways fundamental analysts 
evaluate a company’s financial performance. 
 
✓ Financial resources: It’s not enough for a company to sell goods and 
services. It’s not even enough to turn a profit. Companies must also have 
the resources to invest themselves and keep their businesses going and 
growing. Aspects of a business, such as its assets and liabilities, are 
ways to measure a company’s resources. 
 
✓ Management team: When you invest in a company, you’re entrusting 
your money with the CEO and other managers to put your cash to work. 
Fundamental analysis helps you separate the good managers from the bad. 
 
✓ Valuation: It’s not enough to identify which companies are the best. 
What’s a “good” company anyway? Definitions of “good” can run the 
gamut. You also need to consider how much you’re paying to own a 
piece of a company. If you overpay for the best company on the planet, 
it’s still likely you’ll end up losing money on the investment. You’ll read 
more about this in Chapter 10 and Chapter 11. 
 
✓ Macro trends: No company operates in a vacuum. A company’s perfor-
mance is highly influenced by actions of competitors or the condition of 
the economy. These broad factors need to be incorporated into funda-
mental analysis, as you’ll discover in Chapter 15 and Chapter 16.

Knowing what you need
One of the great things about running as a hobby is all you need is a pair 
of decent shoes. And basketball? Just grab a ball and find a hoop. No fancy 
equipment is required. The same goes with fundamental analysis. Much of 
the data you need is provided free by companies and can be accessed in sec-
onds from any computer connected to the Internet. 
Fundamental analysis can get pretty involved. But at its most basic form, 
there are just a few basic ideas behind fundamental analysis, including: 
 
✓ Awareness of the benefits of fundamental analysis: Since fundamental 
analysis takes some know-how and time spent learning a bit, you’ll want 
to know ahead of time why you’re going to the trouble. Chapter 2 and 
Chapter 3 highlight the payoff of fundamental analysis. Even if you’re a 
passive investor, or one who simply buys a basket of stocks and holds 
on, there are reasons why fundamental analysis might be worth your 
while. 
 
✓ Retrieval of financial data: Getting all the key data you need to apply 
fundamental analysis is easy, if you know where to look. Chapter 4 gives 
you quick tips on how to round up all the data you’ll need. 
 
✓ Basic math: There it is: The M word. There’s no way around the fact 
there will be some number crunching involved in some aspects of fun-
damental analysis. Don’t worry, I’ll guide you to help keep the math as 
painless as possible. One of the key tools you’ll need is for trend analy-
sis, which you will read about in Chapter 4. 
Knowing the Tools of the Fundamental 
Analysis Trade
You can read all sorts of books on home repair and even take a trip to your 
hardware store and buy lots of screws, nails and glue. But none of that effort 
will benefit you unless you have a tool-belt of hammers and the knowledge of 
how to get started and put your plan into reality. 
The same importance of execution is part of fundamental analysis. You may 
appreciate the importance of fundamental analysis and may even be able 
to download fundamental data from Web sites or from a company’s annual 
report. But you need to have the tools to analyze the fundamentals to get any 
real value from them.

Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Staying focused on the bottom line
If there’s one thing investors may agree is of upmost importance, it’s the 
company’s profitability. When it comes down to it, when you invest in a stock 
you’re buying a piece of the company’s profitability. Knowing how to read 
and understand how much profit a company is making is very important 
when it comes to knowing whether or not to invest. 
The income statement, described in full detail in Chapter 5, will be your guide 
when you’re trying to determine how profitable a company is. What might 
also surprise you is that the income statement can tell you a great deal about 
a company, in addition to just how much income it brings in. 
Sizing up what a company has to its name
During times of intense financial stress, investors often make a very impor-
tant mental shift. They’re not so concerned about making money as they are 
about just getting their money back. Similarly, when things get tough in the 
economy, investors are less interested in how profitable a company is and are 
more mindful of whether a company will survive.
When you’re trying to understand the lasting power of a company, fundamen-
tal analysis is of great value. By reading the company’s balance sheet, you can 
get a rundown of what a company has — its assets — and what is owes — its 
liabilities. Monitoring these items give you a very good picture of how much 
dry powder a company has to endure a tough period. Chapter 6 explores the 
balance sheet in more detail. 
Burn baby burn: Cash burn
One of the biggest killers of companies, especially smaller firms just starting 
out, is cash flow. While a company might have a great product concept, excel-
lent management, and even dedicated financial backers, timing is everything. 
If a company is using up cash to pay its bills and employees but not bringing 
in enough cold hard cash from customers, it can run into a giant financial 
headache very quickly. 
 
If there’s one thing I hope you pick up from this book, it’s how fundamental 
analysis helps you keep a close eye on how much cash is coming into and out 
of a company. Monitoring cash flow is critical to know if a company is running 
perilously empty on cash, which you’ll dig into in more detail in Chapter 7. But 
cash flow is also a very important way fundamental analysis helps you put a 
price tag on a company, as you will find out about in Chapter 11.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Fundamental Analysis
Financial ratios: Your friend in 
making sense of a company
As you flip through the book and jump around to different topics that interest 
you, you might be a bit bewildered by just how many pieces of data funda-
mental analysts must deal with. You’ve got the financial statements that mea-
sure just about every aspect of the company. It can be intimidating to decide 
what numbers matter most and which ones can be ignored. 
Financial ratios will be a great help here, as you’ll see in Chapter 8. These 
ratios draw all sorts of fundamental data from different sources and put them 
into perspective. 
Financial ratios are also important because they form the vocabulary of fun-
damental analysts. If you’re ever at a cocktail party where analysts are talking 
about gross margins and accounts receivable turnover, I want you to be pre-
pared. By the way, that sounds like a pretty boring party. 
I’ll show you a whole host of financial ratios in Chapter 8 that are the favor-
ites used by many fundamental analysts. You’ll soon be using seemingly unre-
lated pieces of financial data about a company to glean some very important 
conclusions about the company. 
Making Fundamental Analysis 
Work For You
Imagine a young child who memorized an entire dictionary, but can’t use 
a single word in a sentence. That’s a basic analogy of some investors’ fun-
damental analysis knowledge. You might, too, know some things about the 
income statement and balance sheet and have a great knowledge of what’s 
contained in the statements. But when it comes to applying your know-how, 
that can be a bit trickier. 
Putting fundamental analysis in action requires taking everything you know 
about a company and mixing in some estimates and best guesses about the 
future to arrive at a decent expectation of whether or not to invest in a company. 

18
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Using fundamentals as 
signals to buy or sell
Buying a stock at the right time is very difficult. But knowing when to sell it 
is even tougher. And while fundamental analysis won’t tell you the exact best 
time and day to buy or sell, it can at least give you a better understanding of 
things to look out for when it comes to making decisions. 
 
If you’re a passive investor and buy large diversified baskets of dozens of 
stocks, you can afford to buy and hold stocks. Even if one company runs into 
big-time trouble, it’s just one holding in a large basket of stocks. However, if 
you choose to invest in individual stocks, monitoring the fundamentals is criti-
cal. If you start noticing a company’s trend deteriorating, you don’t want to be 
the last investor to get out. 
The perils of ignoring the fundamentals
Blindly following a company and investing in its stock can be very dangerous. 
Table 1-1 shows a list of a few major U.S. stocks that were worth $100 a share 
or more at the beginning of 2000, but saw their share prices fall to below $10 
a share by the start of 2009. Ouch!

If there’s a primary goal of fundamental analysis, it’s avoiding stock disasters 
like the ones listed above. Losses that large are nearly impossible to recover 
from in a single person’s lifetime. You can read more about why avoiding 
investment disasters is so critical in Chapter 18.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Fundamental Analysis
Using fundamental analysis as your guide
As Table 1-1 shows, investing in individual stocks is very risky. Losses can be 
sizeable. That’s why you want to invest with your eyes wide open. Just as you 
probably wouldn’t dare fire a loaded weapon or jump out of an airplane with-
out proper training, the same goes with investing in individual stocks. 
Luckily, fundamental analysis provides investors with a host of very specific 
tools to help them protect themselves. And while the tools of fundamental 
analysts aren’t foolproof, as you will see in Chapter 22, they give investors 
guidance of when a stock might be getting a little dangerous or the underly-
ing trends might be changing. 
You’ll find complete explanations of some of the most powerful tools used by 
fundamental analysts in this book. Chapter 11, for instance, will be very valu-
able to you since it shows you how to use a company’s cash flow as a way 
to measure its value. And in Chapter 12, you’ll discover how the pros spin 
through the annual reports they receive from companies.

▶ Getting an understanding of what tools are needed to analyze an investment
T
ry to remember what it was like being a beginner at something you’re 
good at now. Whether it was karate, ballet, or basketball, as a beginner, 
you may have been tempted to bypass all the basics and go straight for the 
advanced techniques. For instance, it’s natural to want to try breaking boards 
with your bare hands or doing pirouettes or slam-dunks on your first day of 
trying something new. 
Good coaches, though, encourage you to slow down and start from the 
very beginning. It’s almost always best to start working on the basic karate 
stances, ballet poses, and basketball dribbling before even thinking about 
moving to the showy and advanced aspects of each sport.
Beginning investors often experience a similar overconfidence at first. Many 
hope they can skip mundane things — like reading accounting statements, 
understanding basic financial ratios, and calculating discounted cash-flow 
models — and get right to the exotic rapid-fire trading. It’s tempting to think 
you can trade complex securities, dabble in highly volatile stocks, and dart in 
and out of investments with ease right away. Sadly, though, investors usually 
lose money when they try to get too advanced too soon. And unfortunately, 
there’s no coach to cool off investors who are just starting out. 
So, consider this book to be your coach as you begin. Starting with this chap-
ter, this book will introduce you to the basic skills that make up fundamental 
analysis. The basics explained in this chapter will set you up for taking funda-
mental analysis to the next level in chapters deeper in the book. 

22
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
What Is Fundamental Analysis?
Ask 20 people how they choose their investments, and you’ll probably hear 
20 different methods. Some like to buy stocks recommended by a friend or 
broker. Others think it’s wise to invest in companies making products they 
personally enjoy and use. A few even consult with astrologers (seriously). 
What most people, though, have in common is that they feel they’re always 
paying too much for stocks and selling them when they’re too cheap. 
Perhaps you swing between different investment strategies like some folks 
switch diets to lose weight. Experimenting with different ways of picking stocks 
may have worked fine as stocks made breathtaking advances in the 1990s. But 
the crash of 2008 changed everything, making 2008 a harsh reminder that it’s 
possible to overpay for stocks. Not realizing that ahead of time can be hazard-
ous to your portfolio, and perhaps after losing money a few too many times, 
you’re looking for a method with a little more science behind it.
That’s where fundamental analysis comes in. Fundamental analysis is one of 
the most sound and primary ways to evaluate investments. As a fundamen-
tal analyst, you carefully and thoroughly study every aspect of a company’s 
operations. Much of your analysis will be focused on financial statements 
companies provide, as described briefly in this chapter and in more detail 
later in this book. 
Going beyond betting
If you’re like most investors, even the words fundamental analysis may turn 
you off a bit. Fundamental analysis sounds somewhat stuffy and academic. And 
it’s true that fundamental analysis finds much of its roots in academia. But you 
might be surprised to find you probably are using some basic forms of funda-
mental analysis in your life, perhaps even in places you wouldn’t expect. 
One of my favorite examples of where a type of fundamental analysis is used 
is at the horse races. Before a race, you’ll notice groups of bettors doing 
some serious work trying to pick the day’s winning horses. Some may pore 
over the life histories of horses in the race, getting to know the jockeys and 
their techniques, and even studying how wet or dry the track is. 
While investing isn’t exactly like horse racing, the analogy is a helpful way to 
understand fundamental analysis. For instance, some fundamental analysts will 
study a company like a bettor will study a horse. How successful has the com-
pany been recently, and is it healthy and well-cared for? Next, in fundamental 
analysis you might study a company’s management like a bettor would consider 

23
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
the jockey. Is the management experienced, and has it competed against expe-
rienced players? Lastly, you must evaluate the broad economic climate, just 
like a bettor will consider the weather and condition of the track. 
But here’s where things get even trickier. It’s not good enough to find the 
best company, or horse, to take the metaphor a little further. After all, if all 
the other bettors at the track did the same work and picked the same horse 
that you selected, you have a problem. The odds would be adjusted so that 
the payout on the favorite horse will fall. Bettors know that picking a favorite 
horse to win doesn’t pay off much. And you’re also taking a chance that the 
favorite will lose and cost you money. Similarly, if you invest in a company 
that’s widely considered to be a darling with other investors, your payoff is 
reduced for reasons you can discover in Chapter 3. 
Now that you see what fundamental analysis is, broadly speaking, consider 
how it can be applied to investing. Fundamental analysis is used to size up 
investments in several key ways: 
 
✓ Analyzing the financial statements: Fundamental analysts pore over 
public documents companies provide to understand how the business is 
performing. Many fundamental analysts’ starting point is digging into a 
company’s financial statements to see how profitable a company is, how 
rapidly it is growing, what kind of financial health it’s in, and whether it 
has the ability to withstand tough economic times.
 
✓ Getting an idea of how solid a company is: Many fundamental ana-
lysts are fixed-income investors. These investors have loaned money to 
companies, usually by buying bonds. Bond investors give money to a 
company in exchange for an agreed-upon payment each month, quarter, 
or year. Since bond investors get a fixed amount pay, they don’t care if 
a company is wildly successful. Bond investors, unlike stock investors, 
don’t get a share of future earnings and growth. Bond investors just 
want to know the company is healthy enough so it can keep paying inter-
est and return the money it borrowed. 
 
✓ Understanding the value of a company: Stock investors use fundamen-
tal analysis to gauge whether a company’s stock is a good deal or not. 
By studying financial statements, financial analysts determine whether a 
stock’s price undervalues or overvalues the company. 
 
✓ Going beyond the financials: Fundamental analysis goes beyond where 
accounting stops. While accountants wish to precisely measure business 
activity, fundamental analysts want to analyze it in a way to help make 
decisions. Using fundamental analysis, you will evaluate other factors 
that affect a company’s prospects. Common factors you might consider 
include sizing up a company against its rivals, determining how skilled 
a company’s management team is in navigating through boom and bust 
times, and understanding the broad economic climate. 

24
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
Fundamental analysts take all the intelligence they gather to arrive at an 
investment decision and to take action. The most common question funda-
mental analysts ask themselves is whether a stock, at its current price, is 
cheap or expensive. The answer to that question will determine whether you 
choose to invest or not. 
Understanding how fundamental 
analysis works
 
Fundamental analysts often dig well beyond a company’s financial statements 
and try to unearth things. Sometimes fundamental analysts might spot a trend 
forming before a company’s management acknowledges it. A fundamental ana-
lyst, for instance, might visit a retailer’s stores and see how crowded they are 
to get an idea of what earnings might be in the future. Similarly, the fundamen-
tal analyst may try to get an idea of future demand by considering how busy a 
company’s suppliers are. The goal of fundamental analysis is to measure how 
much a company is worth by using any shred of information possible.
The way you use fundamental analysis to understand what a company is 
worth gets down to the core essence of what a business is. With fundamental 
analysis, your goal is to monitor a company to see how it brings in money 
by selling goods and services to generate revenue. Next, you’ll determine 
how much of revenue a company manages to keep after paying its expenses. 
What’s left after paying all the bills is profit, or earnings. 
 
The fact that fundamental analysts take action on their research is what sepa-
rates them from accountants. Fundamental analysts compare what they think 
a company is worth with what other investors think. If the stock is underval-
ued, the fundamental analyst will buy the stock. Accountants, on the other 
hand, have the job of recording sales and revenue, but not trying to profit off 
their findings. 
Investing with the stars
Since there’s so much money to be made — or 
lost — with investing, it’s not surprising just 
about method to pick stocks has been tried . . . even 
astrology. In fact, during 2008, the best stock 
picker was Crawford Perspectives, up nearly 
43% by monitoring the movement of planets to 
make investment calls. Unfortunately, though, 
you’ll need more than just a clear telescope to 
make money on stocks. Crawford’s stock picks 
lost 1% a year between 1998 and 2008, showing 
that even the heavens can be wrong.

25
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
 
Fundamental analysis isn’t perfect. But as you’ll discover in this chapter, funda-
mental analysis is rigorous and rooted in understanding the most basic elements 
of business. So even if you have no plans to be a fundamental analyst, knowing 
how fundamental analysis works can only boost your investment success. 
Who can perform fundamental analysis?
You don’t have to be a high-powered investor to use fundamental analysis. If you 
have an interest in finding out more deeply about how companies work, you’re 
a candidate for learning about fundamental analysis. In fact, knowing how to 
read, analyze, and take action from information you glean about a company 
can be helpful for many users, including: 
 
✓ Stock investors: Those looking to take an ownership stake in a company 
have a great financial incentive to master fundamental analysis. What 
they find out about companies may help them to decide when a good 
time to buy or sell may be.
 
✓ Lenders: When you give someone a loan, you want to make sure they 
have the ability to pay you back. If you lend money to a company, per-
haps by buying bonds they issue, you’re more concerned about getting 
your money back than about making a killing on the investment. 
 
✓ Mutual fund investors: Even if you don’t pick individual stocks or bonds 
to invest in, you probably own mutual funds that do. Mutual funds are 
investments that invest in a basket of individual securities. Using fun-
damental analysis, you can investigate some of the stocks your mutual 
funds may own. You might take a look at the top holdings of your mutual 
fund and question why your mutual fund owns them. 
 
✓ Employees: Workers may be anxious about the health of their company 
for several reasons. Using the same techniques an investor would use, 
you can study your company’s financial resources and roughly estimate 
how likely it might be to pursue aggressive cost-cutting, like layoffs. 
Employees who depend on a pension paid by a former employer might 
also want to study the health of the company. 
 
✓ Board members: Whether you’re a board member of a large company, 
your local museum, or your condominium association, understanding 
how to understand the flow of money in and out can make you more 
valuable. Understanding fundamental analysis will help you be a solid 
watchdog of the organization’s management by looking at the facts, not 
the promises. 

26
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
✓ Donors: Even some nonprofit charities disclose their financial standing. 
Fundamental analysis will help you see where donations are being spent 
and whether or not money is getting to those in need or being soaked up 
by the bureaucracy. 
 
✓ Consumers: As a consumer, you might not think of yourself as investing 
in a company. And in most cases, you’re not. Sometimes, even when you 
buy a product, you’re forming a long-term relationship with a company. 
When you buy a car or an insurance product, you’re probably going to 
be connected with the company for many years. It’s a good idea to know 
how to analyze a company if you plan on relying on its products for a 
long time.
Certainly, a background in accounting can help you dig even deeper into the 
financial statements. And in this book, I’ll show you some examples of where 
you might not be able to take the financial statements at face value. But 
thanks to advances in accounting, even beginners can get pretty comfortable 
extracting and massaging the information they need to perform fundamental 
analysis. If you want more detail on the nitty-gritty of accounting, check out 
Reading Financial Reports For Dummies (Wiley). 
 
Fundamental analysts spend quite a bit of time looking at companies’ finan-
cial statements, as you’ll learn in Part II of this book. But skilled fundamental 
analysts do more than just pick apart financial statements. After all, if that’s 
all it was, fundamental analysis would be synonymous with accounting. 
Fundamental analysts use their findings to make investment decisions.
Following the money
One of the basic rules of investigative journalism is following the money. 
Tracing the movement of dollars through an organization will quickly show 
you the motives of the leaders, availability of resources, and vulnerabilities. 
Regulators will often follow the movement of money to pinpoint illegal car-
tels, Ponzi schemes, and other frauds. 
 
All this might sound very cloak-and-dagger. But there’s something to be 
learned from approaching fundamental analysis with the mind of an investiga-
tor. Your job is to take available information and attempt to dig up data your-
self to get a complete picture of a company and whether or not it’s a suitable 
place for you to entrust your money. Following the way money moves through 
a company will tell you more about it than just about anything else. 
While no two companies are the same, the basics of business are universal. 
That’s why fundamental analysis is such a powerful tool you can apply to 
high-tech companies, low-tech companies, and everything in between. 

27
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
 
Companies are merely in the business of selling things they acquire for more 
than what they paid. Sounds simple. But that can be easy to forget after you 
get mired in details like profit margins, earnings per share, and P-E ratios. 
The trade cycle begins with a business idea, but more specifically when a 
company raises money so it can buy the equipment it needs to get started. 
Money might be raised by borrowing it, called debt, or by lining up inves-
tors willing to bet their money for a piece of future profits, called equity. The 
money raised is then used to acquire raw materials, office space, or whatever 
the company needs. 
Next, the company tries to add value to the raw materials in some way and sell 
the product to customers. Typically, companies will also incur indirect costs, 
or overhead, to make all this happen. Overhead costs include everything from 
advertising, to research and development, to hiring skilled managers. 
Now here’s where fundamental analysis comes in. A few questions a funda-
mental analyst might ask when taking a look at a company: 
 
✓ After factoring in all the costs, did the company make money? 
 
✓ How much money did the company raise to get started?
 
✓ Is the company able to maintain itself without borrowing more or getting 
more investors? 
 
✓ Can the company create new products to keep buyers coming back? 
 
✓ Are competitors catching onto the idea and selling a similar product for 
less?
What Fundamental Analysis Isn’t
Fundamental analysis is a well-known way of choosing investments. It’s often 
the preferred method taught in business schools, largely due to its roots in 
things that can be measured and understood. But it’s not, by any means, the 
only method of choosing stocks. 
 
If you’re still a little foggy on what fundamental analysis is, comparing it with 
other ways of evaluating investments might clear things up for you. 

28
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
How fundamental analysis stacks 
up against index investing
If fundamental analysis seems like a lot of work, you can probably identify 
with index investors. Index investors think taking the time to pore over com-
panies’ financial statements is a whole lot of trouble for nothing. Index inves-
tors figure any information to be gleaned from company reports has already 
been extracted by other investors and acted upon. 
For instance, if a company’s stock was truly undervalued, other investors will 
have already recognized it and bought the stock. If enough investors buy a 
stock, they push the price up, and the shares are no longer undervalued. And 
thanks to the proliferation of electronic investing, analysts and investment 
firms with access to instantaneous information feeds can make such trading 
moves very quickly. 
For that reason, index investors think trying to buy and sell stocks at just the 
right time, or use market timing, is impossible. In addition, index investors 
say that if there is an edge to fundamental analysis, it’s wiped out by the cost 
and time consumed digging out the information. For that reason, index inves-
tors skip the fundamental analysis, and instead: 
 
✓ Diversify: Rather than trying to pick the companies and stocks that 
will do best, fundamental analysts buy small stakes in as many stocks 
as possible. Generally, index investors will buy mutual funds that own 
hundreds, if not thousands, of stocks. That way, if any one company 
stumbles badly, the loss is very small as a percentage of the portfolio. 
 
✓ Buy index funds: Since index investors don’t think fundamental analy-
sis gives investors an edge, they don’t see any reason to pay a mutual 
fund manager to pick stocks for them. Instead, they buy mutual funds 
that own all the stocks in popular stock indexes, such as the Dow Jones 
industrial average or Standard & Poor’s 500. The Dow mirrors the ups 
and downs of 30 large, well-known companies, and the S&P 500 mea-
sures the market’s performance using 500 of the largest companies’ 
shares. 
 
✓ Focus on costs: Index investors assume the best way to make money 
in the stock market is by keeping costs low. Index funds generally have 
low expenses. And rather than spend personal time researching stocks, 
index investors generally buy a diversified basket of stocks and then 
forget about the holdings. 

29
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
Comparing fundamental analysis 
with technical analysis
Like index investors, investors who use technical analysis shake their heads 
in disapproval when they see fundamental analysts poring over spreadsheets 
and financial statements. They, like index investors, see all the effort that 
goes into fundamental analysis as a waste of time and calculator batteries. 
That’s because technical analysts assume that any information worth know-
ing is reflected in a stock price. 
But technical analysts agree with fundamental analysts in one important way: 
They, too, think it’s possible to beat the stock market. Unlike index inves-
tors, who think that timing the market is futile, technical analysts think stock 
prices move up and down in observable patterns. Knowing how to recognize 
patterns in stock price movements can signal a technical analyst the best 
times to get in, and out, of stocks. Technical analysts may not even care what 
a company does, since they’re just looking at the price chart. To a technical 
analyst, buying and selling at the right time is more important than buying 
and selling the right stock. Technical analysts pay close attention to: 
 
✓ Stock price charts: Technical analysts focus on stock price charts, 
which are graphs that plot a stock’s movement over a period of time. 
These charts will show instantly whether a stock is rising or falling in 
addition to how many trades, or volume, are occurring. 
 
✓ Trading patterns: Much as an astronomer sees patterns of stars in the 
sky, technical analysts look for stock price movements that follow a 
pattern. For instance, if a stock price falls to a low level, rises a bit, and 
sinks back down to near that same low level, technical analysts call that 
a support level. A support is considered a point where demand for a 
stock is strong enough to stop it from sinking much further. 
 
✓ Moving averages: Technical analysts often pay close attention to a 
stock’s average price over a period of time, say 200 days. When a stock 
falls below its 200-day moving average, or its average price over the 
past 200 days, that means the stock is vulnerable to fall further, techni-
cians say. The idea is that when stocks fall below their 200-day-moving 
average, many investors who bought in within the past year are losing 
money and may be nervous and quick to sell. 
Using Fundamental Analysis
If you ever see the library of a fundamental analyst, it can be a pretty intimi-
dating sight. Inevitably, there will be a copy of Security Analysis (McGraw-Hill), 
a 766-page tome stuffed with gnarly formulas and arcane wording that makes 

30
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
your high-school algebra book look like a comic book. There will also be dog-
eared copies of books with words like “value,” “financial statements,” and 
“ratios.” You will see Fundamental Analysis For Dummies on the shelf as well. 
Shameless plug, I know. 
Fundamental analysis has the rap of being for people who wouldn’t be caught 
dead without a pen, mechanical pencil, and calculator in their shirt pocket. 
But even if you don’t walk around carrying such instruments, you too, can 
benefit from fundamental analysis. With an understanding of a few terms and 
basic techniques, fundamental analysis is within reach if you’re interested 
and willing to put in a bit of time. 
 
Who knows, maybe after reading this book you’ll want to dig deeper into fun-
damental analysis? After all, fundamental analysis is a bit like art: As you learn 
a little you naturally get curious and want to learn more. And financial analysis 
can get very detailed and precise. 
How difficult is fundamental analysis? 
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to be a math wizard to use funda-
mental analysis. Most of the math you’ll use is pretty basic arithmetic. And 
there’s no need to memorize formulas, since I’ll put most of the important 
ones all together for you in Chapter 8. You will need to know how to build 
some financial models, which try to forecast how much profit a company will 
make in the future. But to help you out, I’ll point out some online tools and 
calculators to crunch some of the more tricky stuff for you. 
 
Some of the more advanced techniques of fundamental analysis might require 
you to fire up a spreadsheet. If you want to get up to speed, Microsoft provides 
free help and tutorials for its Excel spreadsheet program at www.office.

Dummies (Wiley). 
Is fundamental analysis for you?
If you’re tired of trusting other people to tell you how a company is doing 
financially, you’re a prime candidate for fundamental analysis. Most likely, 
you might find yourself buying investments on a hunch or whim, only to find 
out later the company had some serious problems you didn’t know about. 
The whole premise of fundamental analysis is to reduce, if not eliminate, 

31
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
speculation and wild guesswork from investing. Fundamental analysis is 
rooted in the idea that you want to look at cold, hard data to make informed 
decisions on why an investment might be worth buying. 
Above all, fundamental analysis is ideal for people who want to approach an 
investment fully informed of the risks and with their eyes wide open. An in-
depth fundamental analysis on a stock will not only alert you to potentially 
troubling trends at a company, but also give you clues to whether a stock 
may be overvalued by investors who aren’t paying attention. An overvalued 
company is one that commands a stock price that well exceeds any possible 
profit it could generate for investors. 
In many ways, fundamental analysis is as much about helping you avoid poor 
investments as much as it about helping you find good ones.
The risks of fundamental analysis
Fundamental analysis, while it’s rooted in math and objective information, 
isn’t without its flaws. After all, if fundamental analysis was perfect, everyone 
would quit their day jobs, analyze stocks, and make bundles of money. That’s 
why it’s important to understand the shortcomings of fundamental analysis, 
which include: 
 
✓ Vulnerability to wrong data, including your assumptions: Fundamental 
analysis is heavily based in fact. But if a company incorrectly reports 
data or you misinterpret them, you’re going to have a false conclusion. 
Miscalculations are especially likely when making assumptions about 
things like a company’s future growth rate, future interest rates, or profits.
 
✓ Overreliance on past data: Perhaps the biggest knock against funda-
mental analysis is how much stock it puts in a company’s past perfor-
mance. There is some truth to that, since numbers companies report 
can be a month or more old. However, true fundamental analysis uses 
historical numbers to make an educated guess about the future. 
 
✓ Bad timing: Let’s say you do all the homework in researching a stock. 
You find a stock that appears to be a screaming buy, so you buy it. 
Guess what? A stock can remain a screaming buy for many years or even 
decades until investors come to the same conclusion. Fundamental ana-
lysts often have to be wrong for a long time before making money. 
 
✓ Betting against the market: If you buy a stock because you think it’s 
a steal, you’re in effect betting against thousands of the most sophis-
ticated trading desks around the world with access to the same data. 
If you think a stock is too cheap, you’re making the gamble that other 
investors are missing something you can see. 

32
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
✓ Concentrated positions: If you’re going to the trouble to meticulously 
study a company, you’re going to want to make sure you’re positioned to 
profit if you’re right. Unless you have a team of analysts working for you, 
when you find a stock that fits your fundamental criteria, you’re going to 
want to own a large chunk of it. As a result, investors who use fundamen-
tal analysis may have large exposure to individual companies. 
 
 This concept contradicts the idea of diversification, which is owning 
hundreds and hundreds of small pieces of many companies. With diver-
sification, you’re spreading your risk over many companies so if one has 
a problem, it doesn’t hurt so badly. Fundamental analysts, though, think 
that owning just a few investments that you know inside and out is actu-
ally safer than owning everything. 
Making Money with Fundamental 
Analysis 
Face it. You’re probably not reading this book because you have a deep yearning 
to understand how to read and analyze company information. You’re looking to 
dig into company reports for a reason, which is most likely to make money. 
 
Fundamental analysis can be profitable. If you’re able to find hidden value in 
a company or its stock and buy in before other investors discover what you 
know, you’ll cash in once the rest of Wall Street catches up to you. 
Putting a price tag on a stock or bond 
If you’ve ever wondered whether a stock is “cheap” or “pricey,” fundamen-
tal analysis can be a big help. Fundamental analysis helps you understand 
exactly what you’re getting when you buy an investment. 
Here’s an example to help you see what I mean. Let’s say you have the oppor-
tunity to buy a tree that literally grows dollar bills. How much should you 
pay for the tree? You might be tempted to pay millions of dollars, especially if 
others have their wallets out and start bidding. 
But, fundamental analysis can help you intelligently put a price tag on this 
amazing plant. By asking some questions and doing some due diligence, you 
can actually arrive at a correct price. The farmer tells you the tree grows 20 
one-dollar bills every month. He also says the tree will likely die in a year and 
then stop growing money. Lastly, the farmer promises to pay you $20 a month 
if, for any reason, the tree stops growing money in less than a year. 

33
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
Knowing these fundamental details, the tree can be priced. You now know the 
tree is expected to generate about $240. So, is the tree worth $240? Not so far. 
Remember, the tree won’t grow the $240 right away. You have to wait a year 
to get the whole wad of cash. Because you have to wait a year to get the $240, 
the tree is worth less than $240. So if there’s a bidding war for the tree that 
drives the price over $240, you know to walk away based on your fundamen-
tal research. 
Being profitable by being a “contrarian”
Being a successful fundamental analyst can be pretty lonely. If you’re trying 
to make money from studying a company and determine the company is 
worth more than its stock price, you’re betting that other investors bidding 
for the stock are wrong. 
Fundamental analysis, therefore, is at odds with the efficient market theory. 
Efficient market theory says that trying to beat the market by picking win-
ning stocks is futile. The strong form of the efficient market theory says that 
all information that’s knowable about a company is reflected in a company’s 
stock price. So, let’s say that after reading this book you dig through a com-
pany’s financial statements and find that a company has great prospects. 
Efficient market theory would suggest that you’re not the first person to dis-
cover this, and that other investors have already bid the stock up with the 
same information. 
But before you throw your hands up and give up on fundamental analysis, 
there are some caveats to the efficient market theory worth noting. Most impor-
tantly, while stocks may reflect all information over the long term, there can be 
short-term periods when prices might excessively rise or fall due to extreme 
and fleeting optimism or pessimism. For instance, many high-technology stocks 
skyrocketed during the late 1990s, as investors bid up share prices on the 
idea that they’d be worth a fortune in the future. Fundamental analysts, look-
ing at the fact many of the companies didn’t make money and never would, 
avoided the dot-com bubble. Eventually, the fundamentals caught up to them 
and many of the stocks collapsed 90% or more. In some cases, the companies 
completely failed. 
 
To profit from fundamental analysis, you have to be comfortable going against 
the crowd — or in Wall Street parlance — being a contrarian. When other 
investors are overly enthusiastic about a stock, they bid the price so high that 
it’s practically impossible for anyone to make money.

The Fundamental Analysis Toolbox 
One of the great things about fundamental analysis is that you don’t really 
need much to get started. If you have a computer and calculator, you’re 
pretty much set. 
Unlike technical analysis, which may require sophisticated and costly stock 
chart services, most of the data you need for fundamental analysis is pro-
vided free from nearly every company. Plus, many free online services offer 
increasingly detailed access to company financial data, making it easy for you 
to download and analyze. There are three key financial documents that are 
the cornerstone of financial analysis: the income statement, balance sheet, 
and statement of cash flows. 
Introducing the income statement
Want to know how much a company made or lost during a year or a quarter? 
The income statement is for you. This financial statement steps you through 
all the money a company brought in and how much it spent to make that 
money. If you’ve ever read news stories about how much a company earned 
during a quarter, for instance, the information was taken off the company’s 
income statement. 
 
The income statement is the financial statement containing data you probably 
hear the most about, including revenue, net income, and earnings per share. 
You can find out more about reading this important document in Chapter 5.
Balance-sheet basics
Want to know how much money a company has or how much it owes to 
others? That’s where the balance sheet comes in. This financial statement 
spells out all the cash a company has in addition to its debt. The difference 
between what a company owns (its assets) and what it owes (its liabilities) is 
its equity. Expressed slightly differently, the basic formula that applies to the 
balance sheet is:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
 
Sometimes it’s helpful to understand corporate-finance jargon by putting it in 
personal-finance terms. If you’ve ever calculated your personal net worth by 
subtracting all your loans from all your savings, you’ve essentially created a 
balance sheet. 

35
 Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
Getting the mojo of cash flows
One of the first things fundamental analysts need to understand is that earn-
ings aren’t necessarily cash. Accounting rules, for instance, allow companies 
to include in their earnings sales from products they haven’t actually col-
lected from customers yet. Yes, you read that right. A company might say it 
earned $100 million, even though it hasn’t collected a dime from customers. 
This method of accounting, called accrual accounting, is done for a good 
reason. Accrual accounting lets analysts see more accurately how much it 
cost a company to generate sales. 
But accrual accounting makes it critical for investors to monitor not just a 
company’s earnings, but how much cash it brings in. The statement of cash 
flows holds a company’s feet to the fire and requires it to disclose how much 
cold hard cash is coming into the company. The statement of cash flows lets 
you see how much cash a company generated from its primary business 
operations. The statement, though, also lets you see how much cash a com-
pany brought in from lenders and investors. 
Familiarizing yourself with financial 
ratios (including the P-E) 
While the financial statements are enormously valuable to financial analysts, 
they only go so far. Not only do companies tend to only give the information 
they’re required to, the data can only tell you so much. You didn’t expect 
companies to do everything for you, right? That’s how financial ratios can be 
very important. 
Financial ratios take different numbers from the income statement, balance 
sheet and statement of cash flows, and compare them with each other. You’ll 
be amazed at what you can find out about a company by mixing numbers 
from different statements. Financial ratios can provide great insight when 
applied to analysis. 
There are dozens of helpful financial ratios, which you can read about in 
more detail in Chapter 8. But at this point, you’ll just want to know the basic 
flavors and ratios and what they tell you, including: 
 
✓ Valuation: If you’ve ever heard of the price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E, 
you’ve used a financial ratio. The P-E is one of many valuation ratios. 
Valuation ratios help fundamental analysts find out if a stock is cheap or 
expensive by comparing the stock price to a basic piece of data about a 
company. For instance, the P-E ratio compares a stock’s price to its earn-
ings. The higher the P-E, the more richly valued a stock is. 

36
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
✓ Financial health: If a company is no longer a going concern and isn’t 
functioning, it’s not a great idea to invest in it. Some ratios, called liquid-
ity ratios, measure how easily a company is able to keep up with its bills. 
Fundamental analysts will look for red flags that a company might be 
about to face some tough times.
 
✓ Return on investment: If you’re going to give your money to a company, 
either as a loan or investment, you want to make sure you’re getting 
something in return. Return on investment ratios help you determine 
how well the company is putting your money to work. 
 
✓ Operating performance: The more a company can increase its sales, 
while at the same time lower costs, the more profitable it is. This balanc-
ing act is the essence of business. And the stakes for investors are huge, 
since the more profit a company generates, the bigger piece of the pie 
that’s left for investors. Operating performance ratios let you quickly see 
how well a company is managing its costs and increasing sales.

▶ Finding out how fundamental analysis can turn you into a better investor
▶ Discovering how some of the best investors put fundamental analysis to use
▶ Uncovering clues on when to buy or sell a stock 
▶ Applying fundamental analysis to buy-and-hold investment strategies
F
undamental analysis isn’t the easiest way to invest. There’s a bit of math 
involved. You’ll need to learn some terms. And to perform fundamental 
analysis, you need to ferret out and analyze somewhat arcane pieces of finan-
cial information. 
Why go to all this trouble? That’s the question you’ll find the answer to in 
this chapter. You’ll discover why the rigors of fundamental analysis, and the 
ultimate goal of not overpaying for stocks and finding cheap stocks to buy, 
can help you obtain better long-term success in investing. Meanwhile, you’ll 
see how some basic fundamental analysis can help you avoid making mis-
takes that will be difficult to recover from. 
Of course, no discussion of fundamental analysis is complete without explor-
ing its best-known master: Warren Buffett. Buffett is a hero in investing, 
thanks to his discipline and long-term ability to find and hold companies with 
attractive fundamental characteristics. 
Finally, in this chapter, you get a general taste of how fundamental analysis 
can give you cues on when you might consider buying or selling stocks. No 
method will work 100 percent all the time, but fundamental analysis can at 
least provide a guide and keep you from getting caught up in stock manias 
and bubbles.

Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Better Investing with Fundamentals
One of the biggest strengths of fundamental analysis is the fact it attempts to 
help you keep the emotion out of investing. While momentum investors chase 
after the hottest stocks hoping they’ll go higher, and day traders buy and sell 
every few minutes looking for a quick buck, fundamental analysis is more of a 
data-driven discipline. 
Fundamental analysts analyze investments by examining the business that’s 
behind a stock or bond. Even if you’re just looking to buy a few shares of a 
company, you approach the analysis with the same level of research, or due 
diligence, as if you’re thinking about buying the whole company. Fundamental 
analysis lets you approach a stock as an investor, not a speculator. 
 
Investors look to buy a stock because they believe the underlying com-
pany will generate profits in the future that exceed the price they’re paying. 
Speculators look to make money on an investment by simply finding someone 
else to sell it to for a higher price.
The careful consideration of a company’s fundamentals, such as revenue and 
earnings, is a key distinction of this approach from other methods of choos-
ing investments. The name fundamental analysis really says it all, as the 
approach gets down to the most basic aspects of a business, including the 
trade cycle, which is discussed in Chapter 2. 
Fundamental analysis is generally connected with value investors. Value 
investors tend to buy stocks they think are undervalued, or have stock prices 
below what they think the company is actually worth. But fundamental 
analysis can help you no matter how you invest. Perhaps you’re a technical 
analyst, who studies stock charts to find stocks to buy. Maybe you’re an index 
investor, who buys all the stocks in a broad stock market index, such as the 
Standard & Poor’s 500. No matter what kind of investing you prefer, funda-
mental analysis can help you find suitable stocks and investments. 
Picking stocks for fundamental reasons 
Value investors are often drawn to the idea that they can get an edge on other 
investors by doing their homework and studying a company’s financial state-
ments. These investors believe if they put in the time to understand a compa-
ny’s business, accurately forecast its future, and pay the right price, they can 
achieve greater upside and less downside than the market as a whole. 

39
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
There’s some truth to this. Academic studies have shown that stocks that are 
cheap, or value priced, tend to have strong long-term performance. 
 
Fundamental analysis can also help you protect yourself from your own specu-
lative juices. By studying the cold hard numbers of a company’s business, you 
can get a strong dose of reality while other investors get caught up in the hype 
surrounding a particular stock. Since fundamental analysis is based in the laws 
of business, it can give you a greater perspective on how much an investment 
is worth.
Many investors puzzle over how the price of a stock is determined. Knowing 
this is a key to seeing how fundamental analysis can help you. 
A stock’s price is determined by an auction, very similar to how the price on 
a Pez dispenser is set on eBay. Investors buy and sell stocks every trading 
day, pushing the price up and down based on how optimistic or pessimistic 
they are about a company’s future potential. Just as you can see a bidding 
war erupt over a Pez dispenser and push its value to extreme highs, the same 
can occur for a stock if many investors are willing to buy it. 
A great example of how fundamental analysis can help you spot a frenzy over 
a stock, causing its price to get out of line, occurred in March 2000. Shares of 
Palm Computing, a maker of the popular Palm electronic organizer (remem-
ber those?), soared 150% in their first day of trading to more than $95 a share. 
At that price, investors put a total price tag of $54.3 billion on the company 
and its 23 million shares. 
Just a little bit of fundamental sleuthing could have protected investors from 
the coming brutal collapse in the stock. Here’s how. Palm Computing was 95% 
owned by its parent company, 3Com, at the time. And the entire value of 3Com, 
including its 95% stock in Palm Computing, was just $28 billion. So why would 
investors be willing to pay nearly twice as much for a piece of 3Com? It’s kind 
of like paying $20 for a slice of pie when you can buy the whole pie for $10. 
Fundamental analysts knew something was a little off. And they were right. 
The stock lost more than 70% of its value in just seven months.
Uses for the index investor
Index investors don’t try to pick individual stocks or time the market. Index 
investors buy a broad basket of investments and hold it for a long period of 
time (see Chapter 2 for more on index investors). Many index investors think 
trying to choose stocks that will outperform the broad market is extremely 
difficult, if not impossible. As a result, index investors buy small stakes of 
hundreds of companies, so that trouble at any one firm won’t hurt much. 

40
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Index investors may often say fundamental analysis is a waste of time. Even 
so, many index investors apply some aspects of fundamental analysis. For 
instance, index investors routinely choose to invest in baskets of either value 
stocks or growth stocks. Value stocks are those that are largely ignored by 
investors and command low stock prices relative to their fundamentals, such 
as profits or asset values. Growth stocks, on the other hand, are the darlings 
of Wall Street and demand huge stock prices compared to their fundamentals.
In addition, index investors regularly parcel money between shares of large 
companies and small companies. These measures of size, again, are rooted in 
fundamental analysis. 
You’ll notice that even an index investor might boost returns by paying atten-
tion to fundamental factors. If you want to measure a company’s market 
value, you’ll need its number of shares outstanding, which comes from the 
balance sheet. Likewise, a stock’s book value comes from its balance sheet. 
Assisting technical analysts
Like fundamental analysts, technical analysts think they can beat the stock 
market by picking the right stocks at the right time. But unlike fundamental 
analysis, technical analysis calls for a close study of stock price movements 
over time. 
Why the “three factors” matter 
It’s rare that academic research can make you 
money. But one of the most influential pieces of 
academic research ever written about invest-
ing is certainly worth your time. 
Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French 
found that nearly 95 percent of stock price 
movements are explained by just three things, 
two of which are determined by a company’s 
fundamentals. The three factors that move 
stocks are: 
 ✓ Market risk: Movements of the broad econ-
omy have a large sway on how individual 
stocks perform.
 ✓ Size: Shares of smaller companies mea-
sured by market value tend to beat the stock 
market, in part, because they are riskier and 
less established. Market value, also called 
market capitalization or market cap, mea-
sures the total price Wall Street assigns to 
a company by multiplying a stock price by 
the total number of its shares outstanding. 
You can find out more about market capital-
ization later in this chapter. 
 ✓ Price or value: The lower a stock’s price, 
relative to its book value, the better it tends 
to do relative to the rest of the stock market. 
Book value is a key aspect of fundamental 
analysis, as you’ll read about in Chapter 8. 

41
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
Still, technical analysts can benefit from fundamental analysis, too. For instance, 
some technical analysts might look for companies that are increasing their 
revenue or earnings growth each quarter. This information is found on a com-
pany’s income statement. Similarly, technical analysts might look for the best 
company in an industry by looking for companies with the most attractive 
financial ratios. 
Dooming your portfolio by 
paying too much 
No matter what type of investor you are, there are several absolutes. Here’s 
one of them: If you overpay for a stock, you’re accepting a sentence of poor 
returns in the future. Your return on a stock is a function of how much you 
pay for it. By definition, the more you pay for an investment, the lower your 
return will be. 
Imagine you have the opportunity to buy a Laundromat. The Laundromat has 
been open for 30 years, and in each of those years, it generates a profit of 
$100,000. Since the Laundromat is in a strip mall that will close in five years, 
you figure the business will generate $500,000 in profit over the years and 
then will be shut down. 
 
To keep this example simple, forget about the role of inflation, or the decreas-
ing value of money each year, at this point. Also assume that your estimate 
was correct, and the Laundromat generated $100,000 a year in profit. 
Just imagine what would happen if you offered to buy this Laundromat 
for $200,000. Your gain would be 150%. You know this because your profit 
is $300,000 because that’s the difference between the Laundromat’s earn-
ings ($500,000) and what you paid ($200,000). Your return is your profit of 
$300,000 divided by the price you paid, $200,000. 
Now, what if you got into a bidding war with another person interested in 
buying the Laundromat? In the heat of the moment, you offered to buy the 
business for $400,000 instead of $200,000. Your return will take a big hit, 
now equaling 50%. Nothing changed with the Laundromat. It will function 
the same whether you paid $400,000 or $200,000. But your return is now the 
same profit of $300,000 divided by your purchase price of $400,000. 
The same goes for investments, including stocks and bonds. If you increase the 
amount you pay for a share of stock, for instance, you eat into your return. 

42
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
Overpaying for a stock is even more dangerous than increasing your offer for 
the Laundromat. If a company you invest in suffers a slowdown and its earn-
ings are smaller than expected, you’ll find your return to be very small, or you 
may not get back what you invested. 
Sitting through short-term volatility 
Sometimes the excitement of daily market activity can get intoxicating. Ticker 
symbols scrolling at the bottom of the TV screen during financial shows can 
make you feel as if the markets are constantly moving and changing. And 
that’s true; markets are constantly moving as investors trade shares back and 
forth and push stock prices up and down. 
But a fundamental analysis can help you block out a great deal of this noise 
and be a better investor as a result. An example is perhaps with your house. 
Imagine buying a home for $200,000, which you know is worth that much. 
After having an appraiser look at the condition of the roof, remodeled kitchen 
and bath as well as looking at the prices of identical homes in the area, you 
have a pretty good idea of what the house is worth. 
With this in mind, would you panic if you were sitting on the patio while a 
person walking by randomly offered you $100,000 for the home? Probably 
not. After all, you know the home is worth more than $100,000. Besides, 
you’re not in the market to sell anyway. 
Still, that’s what stock investors commonly do when they pay too much atten-
tion to day-to-day movements in stock prices. They may have felt great about 
buying a stock for $10 a share, but if the stock falls to $8 a month later, they 
panic and wonder if they should sell. 
 
One of the mantras of fundamental analysis comes from Benjamin Graham, the 
pioneer of the methods and mentor to Warren Buffett. Fundamental analysts 
will often say the market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing 
machine in the long run. In other words, stock prices can be kicked dramati-
cally higher or lower in the short term. But over the longer term, the underly-
ing value of a company will prevail, and its true heft will be recognized. 
Fundamental analysis helps you focus on a investment’s true value, or weight, 
using Benjamin Graham’s analogy. If you know you correctly analyzed a 
company and assigned the correct value to it, then you don’t need to be as 
concerned about whether or not a company is popular or not in any given 
day, month, or year. Having a fundamental grasp of a company gives you the 
peace of mind to hold an investment for a long period of time and resist the 
urge to sell at the wrong time. 

43
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
Relying on the Basic Info the Pros Use
It’s natural to think successful fundamental analysts have some kind of secret 
that’s beyond the reach of regular investors. Looking at the long-term suc-
cess of Warren Buffett, for instance, makes you think perhaps he has a super-
computer that’s able to forecast the future. Similarly, many analysts who 
study companies have deep insights about their businesses, which might 
lead you to think they have access to data you don’t.
But here’s the truth. Fundamental analysts, with a few exceptions, are using 
all the same financial statements you have access to. Even the professionals 
are looking at all the same things I’ll show you in this book such as: 
 
✓ The financial statements: The income statement, balance sheet, state-
ment of cash flows and ratios are the cornerstone of the analysis done 
by most fundamental analysts. 
 
✓ The financial ratios: These seemingly simple calculations put the num-
bers in the financial statements into perspective. That perspective helps 
you determine if stocks are cheap or expensive. 
 
✓ Industry analysis: Understanding the dynamics of the industry a com-
pany is in can help you do a better job investing. 
 
✓ Economic analysis: Investments can swing in value based largely on 
how the broad economy is doing. The influence of the economy became 
clear in 2008, when shares of companies having nothing to do with sub-
prime loans were dragged down with the financial debacle. 
 
Clearly, the pros do have distinct advantages. The large firms may employ 
armies of research experts to pore over the financial statements, allowing 
them to trade while you’re still downloading the results. And some of the pro-
fessional systems make fundamental analysis easier by automatically calculat-
ing growth trends and the financial ratios. Finally, experience can be a big help 
in helping a fundamental analyst spot things that a beginner might miss. 
What is the “Warren Buffett Way”?
For many fundamental analysts, Warren Buffett is the ultimate role model. 
And there’s no denying his success. For instance, shares of Buffett’s Berkshire 
Hathaway rose from $70,000 a share to $96,600 in the ten years ending 
December 2008 — an impressive 38% gain. During that same time period, the 
Russell 3000 index, which measures the performance of the stock market 

44
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
in general, lost 0.8% in value including dividends, according to Russell 
Investments. His longer-term record is strong, too. No wonder Buffett is 
called the Oracle of Omaha. 
Trying to figure out Buffett’s secret is the investment world’s equivalent of 
the search for the Holy Grail. Scores of investors make the pilgrimage to 
Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings in Omaha each year, trying to 
figure out how Buffett does it. Hour-long lunches with Buffett auction off on 
eBay for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And there are countless books on 
Buffett, most notably The Warren Buffett Way (Wiley). 
Interestingly, though, Buffett doesn’t make much of a secret of his techniques. 
Every year, in his letter to shareholders and also in Berkshire Hathaway’s 
“Owner’s Manual” he paints a picture of his approach. And much of his 
approach is based in key elements of fundamental analysis, including: 
 
✓ Invest as an owner, not a trader. Buffett is very clear that he looks at 
an investment not as a short-term trade, but a long-term relationship. 
Berkshire Hathaway will often invest in a company and hold it for a 
very long time, perhaps never selling the position. “Regardless of price, 
we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire 
owns,” according to Berkshire’s Owner’s Manual. 
 
✓ Consider carefully a company’s intrinsic value. Buffet repeatedly dis-
cusses intrinsic value, which is a measure of what a company is truly 
worth. Intrinsic value is how much cash a company is expected to 
generate over its lifetime, which is a good measure of what it’s worth. 
Buying a stock for less than its intrinsic value gives you a bit of a margin 
of safety. You’ll find out how to calculate a company’s intrinsic value in 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ Analyze management. Buffett routinely says even a seemingly ho-hum 
company can generate dazzling returns with a good management team 
at the helm. For that reason, Buffett will often leave the top officers and 
directors of a company in place, even after buying a company. 
 
✓ Stick with businesses you understand. The better you grasp how a com-
pany makes its money and operates, the more informed you’ll be after 
reviewing its financial statements. You’ll also know better what to look 
for, since every industry and company has unique financial traits. 
 
✓ Find businesses that have a real advantage. In capitalism, if a company 
has a good idea, other firms will try to copy it and steal away market 
share. Buffett combats that by investing in businesses with a strong 
brand or unique product, such as Coca-Cola.

 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
Investors who want to ride Buffett’s coattails could just invest in Berkshire 
Hathaway. But given his successful long-term investing record, it’s not surpris-
ing there’s an industry out of helping investors mimic him. There are more 
than 4,000 books with Buffett’s name in the title, according to Amazon.com. 
Others try to mimic what Buffett does. There’s a mutual fund called the 
Wisdom Fund, which attempts to mirror Buffett’s investments. Still others 
try to figure out what Buffett is investing in by reading Berkshire Hathaway’s 
annual report, a document that discloses all the firm’s large holdings. 
It’s never a good idea to blindly buy stocks just because another investor did. 
Still, reviewing the stocks that pass Buffett’s fundamental analysis might be 
a good place to start. The list of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in publicly 
traded companies can be found at www.buffettsecrets.com.
 
Blindly following moves of top investors isn’t an instant route to riches. That’s 
especially the case when trying to take cues from Buffett. Buffett constantly 
reminds his shareholders that he plans to hold investments for a long time. 
And his holdings can also suffer large losses. For instance, had you bought 
Tesco at the beginning of 2008 after seeing it was a top holding at the end of 
2007, you would have suffered a 75% loss.
Checking in on Graham and Dodd 
As much as Buffett is revered and admired, he, too was a student of funda-
mental analysis. Buffett has utilized and perfected the tools of professors 
Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, who are discussed at more length below. 
Graham and Dodd, whose names are synonymous with a method of investing 
called value investing, trace their roots to Columbia University, which Buffett 
attended. 
The origins of value investing
Value investing, along with the work of Graham and Dodd, is usually central to 
the work of fundamental analysis. Graham and Dodd explained that a stock is 
really a claim on the cash a company is expected to generate in the future, or 
its intrinsic value, as referred to above. Just know that if a stock is trading for: 
 
✓ Less than the cash it will generate, then it’s undervalued and may be 
bought. 
 
✓ More than the value of cash a company is expected to churn out, it’s 
overvalued. 

46
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Using fundamentals to see when a stock is priced right
But Graham and Dodd took things a bit further than just weighing whether 
stocks were over or undervalued. Other lessons from Graham and Dodd 
worth noting include: 
 
✓ Protecting yourself. Buy stocks well below what they are worth, or their 
intrinsic value. This extra cushion gives you a margin of safety in case 
the business runs into trouble and the stock price falls further. 
 
✓ Investing isn’t necessarily speculating. While it’s tempting to think of 
Wall Street as a giant casino, Graham and Dodd explained that wasn’t 
necessarily the case. If you’re buying stocks with little information about 
the companies’ business, then yes, you’re betting or speculating. When 
you speculate, you bet you can sell the stock to someone else for more. 
But with fundamental analysis, you can become more of an investor 
by understanding what you paid and what you can expect to receive in 
exchange. 
 
✓ Being cautious of companies with excessive debt. Companies that 
borrow heavily to finance their operations may face onerous debt pay-
ments during difficult economies. 
Figuring Out When to Buy or Sell a Stock
Most investors are frustrated by the difficulty of getting the timing just right. 
Even professional investors complain that while it’s hard enough trying to 
find the right investment and buy it at a good price, it’s even harder to know 
when to sell. Fundamental analysis can help you with this because you’ll 
learn how to estimate what a company is worth. As discussed above, know-
ing what a company is worth is very helpful, since you’ll know whether the 
current stock price is higher or lower than what you think the company’s 
value is. 
 
On the flip side, the discipline of fundamental analysis can help you evaluate 
when you might want to sell a stock. If a stock price is well below what you 
think the stock is worth, why would you sell at that price unless you had to? 
Looking beyond the per-share price
Many investors get obsessed with the per-share price of a stock. It’s easy to 
understand why. When you buy a slice of pizza, for instance, you might not 
think to calculate how much, based on the per-slice price, how much you’re 
paying for the entire pie. 

47
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
But one of the basic premises of fundamental investing is just that. You want 
to know how much you’re paying for your slice of a company, and how that 
compares to what it’s really worth. And if there’s one aspect of fundamental 
analysis you can use immediately from this chapter, it’s that the per-share 
price of a stock, by itself, doesn’t tell you much. 
 
Just looking at a company’s per-share price can lead you to make incorrect 
judgments. Some investors, for instance, have puzzled over how shares of 
Visa could trade for less than $60 a share while rival MasterCard commands a 
price of more than $160 a share, since Visa processes more credit card trans-
actions than MasterCard does. You might assume Visa is a better value than 
MasterCard, especially since MasterCard is a smaller company than Visa in 
terms of revenue. You will learn more about using revenue to compare the 
sizes of companies in Chapter 6. 
 
Fundamental analysis, though, will show you that Visa’s lower per-share price 
doesn’t mean it’s a screaming buy. And that’s due to the use of market value, 
perhaps the most basic thing fundamental analysts consider. Market value 
tells you how much investors are paying for an entire company based on the 
price of the single share of stock. Using the pizza metaphor, market value tells 
you what the price of the whole pizza is, based on the price of one slice. You 
can apply this information immediately to stocks, by using this formula: 
Market value = share price × number of shares outstanding
The key parts of market value are: 
 
✓ Share price: How much investors are willing to pay for a slice of own-
ership in a company. You can get a company’s share price from many 
sources, ranging from your online brokerage firm, investing Web sites or 
in the business section of your newspaper. 
 
✓ Number of shares outstanding: The number of slices, or shares, a com-
pany’s value is cut into. The number of shares outstanding is available in 
a company’s balance sheet, as described more fully in Chapter 6. 
Applying market value to Visa and MasterCard reveals much more than 
simply looking at their share prices does. The analysis shows that despite 
its lower per-share price, Visa is actually the company with the bigger total 
value. You figure this out by: 
Calculating market value of Visa:
$60 a share price × 846 million shares = $50.8 billion 
Calculating market value of MasterCard:
$160 a share price × 129.2 million shares = $20.7 billion

48
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
You can see that investors are in fact paying a greater amount for Visa than 
MasterCard. Whether or not they’re paying too much is another question and 
something you can explore in more detail in Chapter 8. But at this point, it’s 
important to understand how fundamental analysis goes well beyond just 
taking a look at a company’s share price. 
Seeing how a company’s fundamentals and 
its price may get out of alignment
You don’t need a long memory to remember how fundamental analysis could 
have helped your investing. During the tech-stock boom of the late 1990s, 
investors were so enamored with dot-coms, they were willing to pay bound-
less amounts for them. And just a few years later, in the mid-2000s, a housing 
boom drove up shares of homebuilders’ stocks. What’s remarkable is that 
there were two massive bubbles in just one decade. Fundamental analysis 
could have helped you sidestep the intense pain after both these bubbles 
inevitably burst.
Academics argue over why bubbles and manias occur with investing. And 
you can leave that heady discussion to them. Just know that sometimes, 
over-enthusiasm for stocks can drive their prices, albeit temporarily, to levels 
that aren’t justified by their underlying businesses. Fundamental analysis is 
one way to try to see when a bubble is forming and try to profit from it.
 
Even masters of fundamental analysis have difficulty timing bubbles just 
right. Many analysts had warned that tech-stocks were overvalued in 1998, for 
instance. These investors had to bear being wrong and missing out on huge 
gains as tech stocks continued to soar in 1999 and early 2000. 
Investors who pay attention to company fundamentals are often able to at 
least recognize when a bubble is forming. Weak fundamentals, for instance, 
were the tip-off for the dot-com bubble. More than a third of the 109 Internet 
companies that failed had business models that didn’t bring in enough 
revenue or had costs too high to ever make a profit, according to Boston 
Consulting. 
Fundamental analysis can help you recognize when stocks are rising too 
much, well beyond what’s justified by their businesses. Investors will often 
become charmed by story stocks, or companies that seem to have bound-
less potential. Consider the rise of satellite radio. Like many investment 
ideas based on promise, the story was irresistible. Subscribers fed up with 

49
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
commercial-filled FM radio were rushing to sign up for monthly subscriptions 
that gave them thousands of crystal-clear radio stations from satellites. Even 
automakers were installing satellite radio players in cars. The growth of satel-
lite radio companies looked unstoppable in 2000. 
And most investors certainly took the bait. Sirius Satellite Radio’s stock 
soared, racing to the point where it had a market value of $1.9 billion in 2000. 
While the company was losing money, it told investors customers were sign-
ing up at a rapid clip and that subscription fees would roll in. Meanwhile, 
the company continued to heavily spend on costly items, including paying 
personality Howard Stern $100 million a year for five years, plus issuing him 
nearly $200 million in stock. Investors continued to buy in. 
But eventually, the investors who took the time to read the company’s finan-
cial statements with horror were proven right. Eventually, Sirius bought rival 
XM Satellite in 2008, for form Sirius XM Radio, with hopes that it could gain 
an advantage through being larger. Still, fundamental analysts spotted two 
signs they routinely look for, including: 
 
✓ Lack of profit: Even as the company grew, it continued to lose more 
and more money. Losses at the company continued to surge, swelling 
from $226 million in 2003 to $5.2 billion during the twelve months ended 
September 2008. 
 
✓ Large debt burden: As of 2009, the company faced the prospect of a 
$1 billion pile of debt coming due. That’s the corporate equivalent of 
your mortgage lender telling you that you have to pay your entire mort-
gage balance back next year. 
Despite the glowing promises of the company, investors ended up suffering 
as those promises didn’t pan out. The company’s stock price collapsed 99% 
from the high in 2000 to less than 20 cents a share in February, as Sirius XM 
flirted with bankruptcy until receiving a costly bailout from Liberty Media. 
Fundamental analysis proved correct. 
Using buy-and-hold strategies 
with fundamental analysis
You might be thinking that fundamental analysis sounds like a good idea, but 
fear that doing so might cause you to constantly change your opinion on a 
stock. After all, companies report their earnings each quarter, and the new 
data, in theory, could cause you to change your opinion on the stock. 

50
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
But fundamental analysis doesn’t require you to constantly buy and sell 
stocks. In fact, many investors tend to do their homework, buy a stock, and 
hold on. They realize that constantly buying and selling stocks can be hazard-
ous for your portfolio because it may hurt you with: 
 
✓ Mounting trading costs: Every time you buy or sell a stock, it costs 
you something. Certainly, you can reduce commissions by opening an 
account with a deep-discount online brokerage, as described in Investing 
Online For Dummies (Wiley). But the costs are still a factor, including 
ones you might not notice. 
 
 There are two prices for stocks, the bid price and the ask price. The ask 
is the price you must pay when you buy a stock. The bid is the price 
you get when you sell. The ask is always higher than the bid, just like 
the price you get for trading in a car to a dealer, the bid, is less than the 
price the dealer will resell the car for, or the ask. When you buy a stock, 
you’re paying a hidden fee, which is the difference between the bid and 
ask, or the spread. 
 
✓ Unnecessary taxes: Flipping in and out of stocks can end up making 
Uncle Sam rich. If you sell a stock for a profit before you’ve owned it at 
least a year, it’s a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are 
taxed at your ordinary income-tax rates, which can be up to 35%. On the 
other hand, if you hold onto a stock for more than a year and sell it, the 
highest tax rate you pay is 15%. By just holding on a little longer, you can 
save a bundle on taxes. 
 
✓ Mistakes: It’s tempting to think that you’re never wrong. And after 
reading this book and applying fundamental analysis, you’ll be more 
informed than many other investors. Still, it’s easy to make a mistake if 
you sell too early. 
Looking to the long term
While it’s not always the case, investors who rely on fundamental analysis 
are often resigned to being patient. After all, when you’re counting on the fact 
that the stock market and its scores of traders, portfolio managers, and other 
investors are wrong, you can’t expect them to arrive at your way of thinking 
overnight. 
Fundamental analysis often works best when paired with a passive investing 
strategy. With passive investing, you do all your homework, pick your stock, 
and then wait. The stock might fall further. But it’s up to you to have the cour-
age to trust your research and wait until other investors see what attracted 
you to the stock. 

51
 Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
And because making money with fundamental analysis requires you to go 
against the crowd, you’ll often need to buy the stock when you think others 
are wrong. A few of the times where stock prices might, temporarily, under-
value a company include: 
 
✓ The wake of an accounting scandal: When investors can no longer trust 
a management team because the financial statements have been falsi-
fied, they might sell the stock indiscriminately. If the stock is adequately 
beaten down to a point where you feel the company’s not being properly 
appreciated, there could be opportunity. 
 
 Trying to buy a stock after it’s been “cooking the books” is extremely dif-
ficult. Since fundamental analysis is based on accurate financial account-
ing, making a decision based on false information is complicated and 
beyond the scope of this book. 
 
✓ Amid pending litigation or liability claims: Stocks will often trade at 
discounts, or below their true value, when investors are worried a com-
pany might face massive claims. This has happened with companies 
involved in tobacco and asbestos.
 
✓ Slowing growth: When a company matures, it may see the rate of increase 
in revenue and earnings slow. When that happens, growth investors, who 
buy growth stocks, may dump the stock so they can move on to the new 
darling. 
 
✓ Industry shifts: When there’s a major disruption to an industry, the 
stocks in the group might get seriously punished. Following the credit 
crunch, for instance, stocks in the financial sector lost 58% of their value 
as a group in 2008. Certainly, not all banks and financial firms deserved 
to be punished that badly. 
Being willing to step up and invest in a company others want nothing to do 
with can be lucrative. Beaten-down stocks that get rediscovered by investors 
can rally strongly. 
For instance, investors had to be brave and confident enough to buy stock in 
Tyco in June 2002. The diversified industrial supply company was mired in a 
scandal pertaining to alleged accesses by its CEO, Dennis Kozlowski. But by 
the end of 2002, the value of the investment soared more than 250% as inves-
tors figured they overestimated the trouble the company was in. 
Patience isn’t always a virtue
According to classic value investing, if you’ve done your fundamental analysis, 
you can practically buy your stocks and forget about them. Unless there’s a 

52
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
major change that warrants changing your opinion, which you can find out 
about in Chapter 10, value investors hang on and wait for the market to wake 
up. But the danger is, sometimes investors were right to dump the stock.
 
Overconfidence in fundamental analysis can turn a bad decision into a dev-
astating one. The brutal decline suffered by Lucent shareholders is a classic 
example. Lucent was born out of the technology arm of AT&T, which was 
known for innovative patents for telecommunication and computing. Lucent, 
considered a blue chip by many investors, routinely showed up on lists of the 
most popular stocks with individual investors.
But the stock’s downfall remains an example of the dangers of hanging on too 
long. The stock hit its all-time high of $85 a share in 1999 amid the technology 
boom. Many investors looking at the stock’s falling market value figured the 
company would come back. They kept thinking that as the stock fell to $75, 
$65, and $55. But it didn’t come back. The stock collapsed to $2.34, the price 
at which rival Alcatel offered to buy it in 2006.

Getting Your Hands on 
Fundamental Data
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what information companies must provide to investors 
▶ Getting a grasp on some basic accounting and math for fundamental analysis
▶ Discovering how to access fundamental data right when they are released by companies 
▶ Getting familiar with databases that allow you to access financial information 
You might have your financial calculator or spreadsheet fired up and 
ready to start analyzing fundamental data. There’s just one little 
problem: You need to get the data first. 
Luckily, when it comes to getting your hands on data, there’s never been a 
better time to be a fundamental analyst. You’re able to get data faster, at less 
cost, and with less technical expertise than ever before. The ability to obtain 
financial data almost immediately from companies allows fundamental ana-
lysts to closely monitor how a company is doing.
This chapter will show you what types of fundamental data companies pro-
vide to investors, what form they come in, and when you can expect to get 
them. You’ll also get a quick refresher on accounting basics you’ll need in 
order to understand what’s contained in the reports when they land. Finally, 
this chapter will show you how to obtain financial data, including a detailed 
look at the treasure trove of fundamental data provided by the nation’s top 
financial cop, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. 

54
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Getting In Sync with the 
Fundamental Calendar 
Companies you can invest in don’t get to decide whether or not to give you 
their financial information. And that’s a relief. Just imagine how haphazard it 
would be if companies could choose. What if they just weren’t in the mood to 
report their revenue or earnings in a quarter? If a retailer had a bad holiday 
selling season, for instance, it could tell investors, “Sorry, we’re not going to 
tell you how we did.” Such selective disclosure would be the corporate ver-
sion of letting your kids only bring report cards home if they got all A’s.
In reality, publicly traded companies agree to be somewhat transparent. 
Transparency is a popular buzzword in business, but it’s a noble goal. To be 
transparent, companies must adhere to strict rules about what financial infor-
mation they disclose, and must even meet deadlines. And this goes for nearly 
all publicly traded companies, or those that sell ownership stakes of them-
selves to the general public who buy the shares. Similarly, when companies 
borrow money from the public, they too, must disclose their financial results 
to the public. 
 
By taking the public’s money, companies agree to give investors quarterly 
updates on their financial progress. Access to current and accurate funda-
mental data is one of your most basic rights when you either invest in or lend 
money to a company. 
Which companies must report their 
financials to the public?
Just about any company you can invest in must follow financial reporting 
rules. That includes companies that are publicly traded, as explained above. 
But even some private companies, which haven’t sold stock, must provide 
some financial information if they have $10 million or more in assets and 
have 500 or more owners. 
Most major stock market exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange 
and NASDAQ, require their listed companies to provide quarterly and annual 
financial reports to investors. That includes foreign companies with shares of 
stock that trade on either exchange. 
 
Some private companies offering generous stock option programs to employ-
ees often find themselves eventually having to start filing financial reports. 
Internet search company Google, for instance, was private for roughly six 
years after it was founded in 1998. The company quickly hit the $10 million 

55
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
threshold for total assets, meaning it was required to provide financial state-
ments. At that time, Google decided it might as well become publicly traded 
and sell shares to investors in an IPO since it was going to have to report its 
financial statements. Google launched its IPO in August 2004. 
Kicking it all off: Earnings season
Sports fans wait all year for the beginning of football, basketball, or baseball 
season. And children can’t help but anticipate the holiday season. But it’s 
earnings season that fundamental analysts look forward to. 
Four times a year, shortly after the end of the quarter, companies will begin 
to report their financial results to investors. Since most companies are on 
a calendar year, the results generally start trickling out two weeks after the 
quarter ends. Four times a year, usually in January, April, July, and October, 
thousands of companies report their financial results en masse. These times 
of year are called earnings season. 
 
Aluminum maker Alcoa earned the unofficial designation as the company to 
kick off earnings season. The company’s advanced accounting system allows 
it to close its books very rapidly following the end of the quarter. Alcoa is the 
first stock that’s a member of the Dow Jones industrial average to report its 
earnings each quarter.  
No data is bad data
If a company claims to be publicly traded but 
doesn’t provide financial information, be highly 
skeptical. The lack of financial information is 
especially critical when dealing with stocks that 
trade on the largely unregulated markets known 
as the Pink Sheets or OTC Bulletin Board. 
Unlike regulated exchanges, like the NYSE and 
NASDAQ, stocks that trade on the Pink Sheets 
and OTC Bulletin Board are not required to 
provide any financial information to investors. 
You read that right. These companies may even 
have ticker symbols, but never disclose how 
much they made or even how much revenue 
they generated. Most of the stocks on these 
markets are lightly regulated, if at all. 
And the lack of financial information is a huge 
reason why investors, especially those who 
rely on fundamental analysis, are often best 
served by avoiding stocks that trade on the 
OTC Bulletin Board or Pink Sheets. These mar-
kets are infamous hangouts for so-called penny 
stocks. These stocks, which generally trade for 
a few pennies, are often just a name and little 
else. Sometimes penny-stock companies claim 
to have products and a management team, but 
don’t actually generate any money to speak of. 
Penny stocks are popular with speculators, 
who like to talk up a shell company’s prospects, 
get investors excited enough to buy in, and then 
dump the shares for a quick profit. 

56
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
Not all companies follow a calendar year. For instance, retailers generally 
bring in a vast majority of their sales each year during December. For that 
reason, many retailers close their books at the end of January, to give them 
time to tally up their performance in December and give a full report for the 
year. When a company ends its year, for accounting purposes in a month other 
than December, it’s called a fiscal year.
Getting the earnings press release
You don’t have to be a newspaper reporter to appreciate the earnings press 
release. Contrary to its name, the earnings press release is for all investors, not 
just the media. After the end of a quarter, companies will publicly announce 
their financial results by distributing the press release. The press release is 
usually, but not always, accompanied by a conference call for investors and 
analysts. During the call, the management team will go over the quarter or 
year, describe the information in the earnings press release, and answer ques-
tions from the analysts who cover the company’s stock for research firms. 
 
When you read or hear a company reported its financial results, the informa-
tion almost always comes from the company’s earnings press release. While 
earnings press releases are technically unofficial and preliminary, they’re usu-
ally accurate enough for investors, analysts, and the news media to use the 
numbers immediately. It’s important to remember, though, that the earnings 
press release is not reviewed by an accountant or auditor. 
When companies issue an earnings press release, they will often notify the 
regulators by filing a form 8-K. The 8-K filing is the official way to signal to the 
world that the company has released critical information. 
Regulators do not directly stipulate what companies must say in earnings 
press releases. But generally, earnings press releases contain several key parts: 
 
✓ Summary of the results: Most earnings press releases will give the num-
bers investors want most right at the top, maybe even in the headline. That 
includes the revenue and earnings the company generated during the quar-
ter and how much it grew (or shrunk) from the same quarter last year. 
 
 Be leery when a company brags about a quarter being a “record” quarter. 
Even if a company’s revenue rose to a record amount, its costs may have 
also run out of control and eaten into its earnings. 
 
✓ Management comment: A member of the management team will usually 
opine on how the quarter went. As you might imagine, these statements 
are generally very carefully crafted, overly optimistic, and not particu-
larly useful. 
 
✓ Description of major business events during the year: Companies 
might break down — and even provide succinct bullet points — of the 
major accomplishments during the period. 

57
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 
✓ Guidance for the future: Most companies will often provide earnings 
guidance, or an estimate on how much the company might earn in the 
upcoming year. This guidance is important since it lets you know what 
the company expects in the near future. 
 
✓ Financial statements: The earnings press release is the first glimpse 
investors will get of the company’s income statement and balance sheet. 
These statements are among the most critical documents for fundamen-
tal data you’ll get. 
 
It’s a good idea, when reading an earnings press release, to bypass most 
everything except the financial statements. While earnings press releases are 
intended to be honest representations of a company’s performance, compa-
nies use the first parts of the earnings press release to put their performance 
in the best light. In contrast, the financial statements are the purest and least-
biased parts of the press release.
Bracing for the 10-Q
Following the earnings press release, the next document to trickle from the 
company is the 10-Q. The 10-Q is the official financial report submitted by a 
company to summarize its performance during the quarter. 
Most companies have 40 days from the end of each fiscal quarter to produce 
and provide the 10-Q to investors. Generally, companies file the 10-Q a week 
or two after they provide the earnings press release. 
 
Both the earnings press release and 10-Q serve the same basic purpose: They 
tell investors how the company did, financially, during the quarter. But since 
the 10-Q is written primarily to satisfy regulatory requirements, it’s usually 
much more straightforward and contains less spin. 
The 10-Q must be filed with the chief regulator of the financial markets, the SEC. 
As a result, companies are careful to include the following key components: 
 
✓ Financial statements: Companies don’t waste any time getting straight 
to the point with the 10-Q. The key financial statements are presented 
right at the top, while they’re usually at the bottom of earnings press 
releases. 
 
 Don’t make the mistake of assuming since you read the earnings press 
release, you don’t need to bother with the 10-Q. A vast majority of com-
panies don’t include a statement of cash flows in the earnings press 
release. The statement of cash flows, however, must be included in the 
10-Q. As you’ll discover in Chapter 7, the statement of cash flows is an 
extremely important document used in financial analysis.

✓ Footnotes: Just as some books just don’t fit correctly in your bookshelf, 
some financial information doesn’t slip nicely into the financial state-
ments. Unusual or noteworthy financial events might require more 
description than will fit into the financial statements, and those are 
available in the footnotes. 
 
 Never skip the footnotes. Companies will often throw items in the foot-
notes, hoping you’ll miss them as an investor. Enron, for instance, stuffed 
much of the information about its cryptic partnerships in the footnotes. 
 
✓ Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition: This sec-
tion of the 10-Q is usually called the MD&A. In the MD&A, management 
steps investors through its financial results for the quarter. The narra-
tive is usually stripped down and, well, straightforward since executives 
know the SEC will review it. So they don’t want to say anything that may 
haunt them later. 
 
✓ Controls and procedures: The company will let investors know if they 
found any problems in the way they monitor their accounting and pres-
ent the information to investors. Following the accounting scandal at 
Enron, new rules from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 forced companies 
to make sure they had adequate controls in place over their accounting. 
 
✓ Other information: Here, companies can throw in other material that 
might be of note to investors. This may include any pending litigation or 
whether the company sold additional stock, or is having trouble paying 
interest on its debt. 
Many investors don’t realize a company’s 10-Q is not officially audited by a 
third-party accounting firm. That doesn’t mean you can’t necessarily trust 
the numbers; just know a little more skepticism isn’t a bad idea. 
Running through the 10-K
If you’ve ever run a 10-K race, you know that it can be pretty grueling if you 
haven’t trained properly. The same goes for companies looking to report 
their annual financial performance in the form called the 10-K. This docu-
ment is a monster, and producing it is one of the biggest financial chores a 
company faces. It’s also the most comprehensive piece of fundamental data 
you’ll get as an investor. Most companies are required to release their 10-K fil-
ings within 75 days from the end of their fiscal year. Some smaller companies, 
though, have 90 days to comply with the rules. 
 
Due to the complexity of producing a 10-K, there can be a significant delay 
between the end of the calendar year and the time the report gets released. 

59
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
The 10-K is kind of like a company’s annual review. The level of detail of the 
10-K is exhaustive, and unless you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to 
get lost in the hundreds of pages of tables and text. 
That’s why fundamental analysts rarely curl up with a 10-K and read it from 
start to finish like a novel. They just know how to skip around in a 10-K and 
look for these key elements: 
 
✓ Everything in the 10-Q, just for the whole year: All the data you get in 
the 10-Q for the quarter, you get for the year in the 10-K. That includes 
the financial statements and legal proceedings, but also, a more expanded 
MD&A where the management team explains more fully how the year 
progressed. The controls and procedures section may also be more 
fleshed out, since the 10-K has been checked over by the auditors. 
 
✓ Changes in accounting and disagreements with accountants: You might 
not expect to see conflict and intrigue in a company’s financial report, 
but sometimes you can find it here. Companies and their accountants 
will state in this section whether or not they didn’t see eye to eye on 
financial reporting matters. 
 
✓ Long-term financial data: Companies give you the financial results for 
the year that just ended. But you’ll also find data for the past three, five, 
or even ten years. These data are very useful when looking for trends, or 
changes in fundamentals like revenue and earnings. 
 
✓ Business summary: Here, the company lays out the nitty-gritty of what it 
does for a living. The company may break down its major business units 
and even, in some cases, tell you which parts of the business are the 
most profitable. You’ll find out how to study the profitability of a com-
pany’s units in Chapter 5. 
 
✓ Risk factors: Imagine showing up to pick up a date, but before you leave 
for the movies, he or she sits you down with a huge list of everything 
that’s wrong with themselves. That’s what companies must do in their 
10-Ks. If there’s a known factor that could impair a company’s fundamen-
tals, it is required to tell you about it here. 
 
✓ Auditor’s opinion: Close to the bottom of the 10-K, the accountants 
will need to sign off on the books to indicate they reasonably reflect the 
financial condition of the firm. 
 
When reviewing a 10-K, always read the auditor’s opinion. The statement from 
the auditor can be telling. While an auditor may not wave a red flag and tell 
you not to buy stock, you can read between the lines. For instance, if you see 
the word qualified, watch out. That means the auditor has some issues with 
the way the books are kept, so you should too. Also, be careful when an audi-
tor says a company may not be able to remain a going concern. That’s account-
ing talk for, “This company might not make it.”

Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Flipping through the annual report
If you visit a CEO’s office, you’ll surely see the annual report sitting on the 
coffee table. And to be sure, many companies’ annual reports are gorgeous, 
well, as much as financial documents can be. The annual report is essen-
tially the 10-K, magazine-style. There are lovely photos of smiling executives, 
employees, and customers. Even the financial statements are given a face-lift, 
usually printed on luxurious paper using an elegant font. The annual report 
is usually released several months after the 10-K is published, often landing 
around the time companies have their shareholders’ meetings. 
 
Unlike the 10-Q and 10-K, which you can download directly from the SEC’s Web 
site, the annual report is a paper-based document. If you call a company, most 
times it will be happy to mail you a copy. You can also usually view an electronic 
form of the paper annual report by downloading it from the company’s Web site. 
The annual report is the glossy and slick version of the 10-K. Companies pro-
duce the annual report mainly to hand out to employees and customers while 
courting them. 
The annual report is the management team’s opportunity to put its spin on 
how the year went. Most annual reports, for instance, begin with a letter to 
shareholders that is generally very hopeful, even after a dismal year. 
Annual reports: A corporate beauty contest
Some companies go to great expense creating 
visually stunning annual reports. Some truly 
are wonders of publishing, putting some maga-
zines to shame. Surfwear maker Quiksilver, for 
instance, produces annual reports containing 
full-color photos of surfers, exotic beaches, 
and colorful surfboards. By contrast, Warren 
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s is a boring-
looking document with no photos, but packed 
with wisdom and worth a read even if you don’t 
own the stock. 
Yet other companies try to make a state-
ment with their annual reports. Starbucks, for 
instance, in 2007 only put out a six-page full-
color annual report that was then bundled with 
a black-and-white printout of its 10-K. It said its 
sparse annual report was an effort to reduce 
paper waste. In fact, thinning annual reports 
is a growing trend as companies look to cut 
costs. Companies may produce just a few col-
orful pages, and slip the 10-K inside. This trend, 
which really began in 2006, will likely continue 
as more investors prefer to download compa-
nies’ financial information electronically.

61
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
There’s no proxy like the proxy statement
If you’re looking for the most salacious statement released by companies, 
that must be the proxy statement. The proxy statement is a document the SEC 
requires companies to distribute to shareholders ahead of the annual share-
holder meeting. It’s kind of like the absentee ballot you might get prior to a 
presidential election. 
Shareholder meetings happen every year as companies gather shareholders, 
usually in the spring, to go over their initiatives and goals. The proxy is some-
times known by its regulatory name, 14A, named after the portion of the SEC 
rules that stipulate what it must contain. 
The proxy statement is fascinating reading because it lays out all the most 
sensitive information most companies have to offer, including: 
 
✓ Executive compensation: Not only are the annual salaries of the top 
executives spelled out, but the amounts of their bonuses, too. 
 
✓ Corporate matters subject to a vote: Companies’ proxies contain a sec-
tion that looks almost like a ballot. There will be a number of measures 
that require shareholder approval. Usually, the items up for a vote 
include the selection of the auditing firm, and the board members stand-
ing for reelection on the board. 
 
✓ Shareholder proposals: If a company has any ill will with shareholders, 
it will become very clear in the proxy. Dissident shareholders may offer 
proposals to replace the management team. Other investors might lobby 
for the company to adopt more environmentally friendly manufacturing. 
 
✓ Related-party transactions: This is one of my favorite parts of the proxy. 
It shows whether any of the company’s officers or directors have busi-
ness relationships with it. Individuals that have business relationships 
with the company, in theory, may have trouble being impartial since 
there’s a potential conflict of interest.
 
The proxy is so important to fundamental analysis that you can explore it 
more fully in Chapter 9.
Getting up to Speed with the 
Basic Accounting and Math
Even if you hated math in high school and avoided accounting in college, 
you can still put fundamental analysis to use. In fact, the more you dig into 

62
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
the financials of companies and see how math and accounting can help you, 
who knows, maybe you’ll get curious to learn more. And if that’s the case, 
you might look into Business Math For Dummies (Wiley) or Accounting For 
Dummies (Wiley). 
But here, in this section, I’ll give you the basics of what you need to know 
about the concept of accounting. You’ll see that accounting is really just a 
way to condense millions of individual business transactions down to a form 
that makes it possible for you to analyze. 
When you’re studying financial statements, just remember there are three 
primary functions of business you’re trying to analyze: operating activities, 
investing activities, and financing activities. 
Finding smooth operators
A company’s operations get the most attention. Typically, when you hear a 
company is or is not “doing well,” that is a reference to the firm’s operating 
activities. 
Simply stated, a company’s operations are the process of converting raw 
materials into products that are, hopefully, sold to customers for a profit. 
Many elements go into operations, including effective new product develop-
ment, which generates revenue, in addition to cost control, marketing, and 
manufacturing. The income statement, explored more in Chapter 5, lets you 
see how well a company is operating.
You have to spend money to make money
Unless they’ve found a goose that lays platinum eggs, all companies, at some 
point, must put money back into their business. Equipment used to make 
products wears out and needs to be replaced. Companies outgrow their head-
quarters and must acquire a bigger building. And it’s common for companies 
to overhaul their computer systems to keep up with tracking their business. 
When companies spend money to make more money, they’re investing in 
their future. And while investing is a necessary part of doing business, it can 
also be done poorly. Companies might spend too much for equipment they 
didn’t need. Or worse, they might over expand, resulting in a glut of their 
product, which hurts their profits. You can read more about profit margins 
in Chapter 5. There are two key things for a fundamental analyst to monitor 
when it comes to investment: 

63
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 
✓ Is the return on the investment adequate? If a company is spending 
money to expand, and revenue and profit aren’t growing too, you might 
be throwing your money down the drain as an investor. 
 
✓ Is the company using the equipment it has bought? In business, having 
too much capacity is not a good idea. You don’t want to spend money 
renting a warehouse, for instance, if it’s usually empty. 
Getting in tune with high finance
So, you can understand how a company operates and how much it’s spend-
ing on itself. But who’s going to pay for all this stuff? That’s the final and criti-
cal element that accounting helps you with. 
Generally speaking, companies can finance, or fund their operations, in 
two ways. They can either rustle up investors, or they can borrow money. 
Investors provide money, called equity capital, to companies in exchange for 
a piece of the company. If all goes well, the company operates extremely well, 
profits soar, and investors are very happy since their share of the company 
will be worth more. When you buy stock in a company, you are an investor.
 
Some beginning investors incorrectly think money they use when buying a 
stock goes directly to the company. That’s not usually the case. Companies sell 
their stock to the public once, in a process called an initial public offering, or 
IPO. When those shares sell for that first time, the companies get that money. 
But after the IPO, the company doesn’t get additional cash. The shares and 
money are trading hands between other investors in the secondary market. 
When it comes to financing itself, a company may also look to borrow money. 
Companies may borrow money from a local bank or sell IOUs, called bonds, 
to the public. Investors who lend money to a company just want to get their 
money back, plus an amount of interest agreed upon ahead of time.
 
If a company fails, investors and lenders are treated very differently. And the 
difference has a big influence on whether or not you decide to buy a company’s 
stock or bond. 
If a company is unable to keep paying interest to its lenders, the company 
goes into default. Typically, at that point, the bondholders take control of 
the company. In the worst-case scenario, when a company cannot be saved, 
bondholders get repaid first. So, let’s say a company defaulted and had a 
giant garage sale to sell its desks and chairs. The money would be used to 
pay back debt holders before stock investors see a penny. That means, as 
stock investors, you’re accepting the possibility that you can lose your entire 
investment.

Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Learning a key fundamental math skill: 
Percentage changes
If you’ve noticed so far, I’ve tried to spare you from much ugly math in the 
first couple of pages. And hoping not to scare you off, I try to introduce math 
topics in this book gently and only when it’s relevant. 
But there’s one math skill that you’ll encounter so frequently in fundamental 
analysis, you might as well tackle it now. And that’s the concept of percentage 
change. Because fundamental analysis is infatuated with looking at increases 
and decreases in business factors, such as sales and revenues, the percent-
age change is a way to put gains and declines into context. For instance, if I 
told you that the price of a sweater rose $50 this year, that doesn’t tell you 
much. But if I told you the price was $50 before, then you know that the price 
doubled to $100. 
You calculate a percentage change this way: 
New number – old number ÷ old number × 100
Going back to the sweater example, the new price is $100 and the old price 
was $50, so: 
100 – 50 ÷ 50 × 100 = 100%
 
If a value rises by 100%, then it has doubled. Similarly, if a number rises 
by 200%, it has tripled and 300%, quadrupled. Some make the mistake, for 
instance, of seeing the 2 in the 200% and saying it has doubled when it has in 
fact, tripled. 
How to Get the Fundamental 
Data You Need
You might have the fastest car in the neighborhood, but if you don’t have any 
gas, you’re not going to get far. So goes fundamental analysis. You might build 
the fanciest financial spreadsheet, but it’s not going to do you any good if you 
don’t have the raw financial numbers to put in it. 
Until the dawn of the Internet, getting fundamental data could be a real 
hassle. You would have to call or write a company and ask it to mail — yes, 
mail — its 10-K, 10-Q and annual report to you. 

65
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 
Thankfully, the days of having to deal strictly with paper financial statements 
are over. But the skills of the fundamental analyst must keep up with the elec-
tronic age. In this section, you’ll find out how to quickly, and for no cost, get 
your hands on the fundamental data you’ll need to complete your analysis. 
Getting acquainted with 
the SEC’s database
You can spend thousands of dollars for access to Web sites that provide fun-
damental data. But really, to get started, you don’t have to spend a dime. 
The SEC’s website at www.sec.gov is a treasure trove for fundamental analy-
sis. You’ll find all the financial forms discussed above in this chapter, and 
then some. All the fundamental data are stored in the SEC’s Interactive Data 
Electronic Applications, or IDEA, database. You can use IDEA to look up any 
public company’s filings and even download the financial statements to your 
computer so you can do further analysis. 
 
You might hear or read references to the SEC’s EDGAR database. EDGAR was 
the SEC’s primary financial-form database prior to IDEA. EDGAR is still avail-
able on the SEC’s site, but it’s not worth the time. IDEA can do everything 
EDGAR could and adds additional information. 
Step-by-step directions on accessing 
company fundamentals using IDEA
Now that you know how powerful IDEA is, it’s time to dive in and discover 
how to get what you need from it. For the example below, I’ll show you how 
to get the 10-Q, 10-K and proxy statement for General Electric. Just follow 
these steps: 
 
1. Log into the SEC’s Web site at www.sec.gov.
 
2. Click the “Search” link on the upper right-hand corner of the page.
 
3. Enter the name of the company in the Company name blank. 
 
 It’s the first blank in the top of the blue-shaded box. Type in general elec-
tric for this example.
 
4. Scroll down and click the Find Companies button.

66
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 
5. Choose the company name. 
 
 Because General Electric has separate business units, you’ll see compa-
nies like General Electric Capital Assurance Co. But you want the main 
company, so click on the red numbers to the left of where it says General 
Electric Co.
 
6. Click on the form you want. 
 
 If you want GE’s 10-Q, scroll down until you see the form 10-Q listed and 
click on the “Documents” button. If you want the 10-K, choose 10-K, and 
the proxy is marked as 14-A.
 
7. Click on the red code under the document in the first line. 
 
 This line should have the form under the “Type” head, which in this case 
is the 10-Q. When you’re downloading the 10-K, the line should read 10-Q. 
 
When you’re scrolling down through the list of forms, you might notice that 
some have a blue button that says “Voluntary Interactive Data.” These forms 
are presented in a special format that computers can read, called eXtensive 
Business Reporting Language or XBRL. Financial statements available in 
XBRL can be easily processed and downloaded. If you click on the Voluntary 
Interactive Data button, you’ll be moved to an area of the SEC’s Web site that 
lets you view financial reports using XBRL. You can easily skip between the 
income statement and balance sheet without scrolling, for instance. XBRL 
also lets you easily download the financial statements to a spreadsheet. Since 
it’s not required to file using XBRL, only a handful of companies do. But that’s 
changing. 
 
Most of the major Web portals, such as Yahoo, at finance.yahoo.com, and 
MSN, at money.msn.com, provide summaries of companies’ primary financial 
statements. MSN Money also lets you access all the regulatory forms. Most 
companies, too, put their financial data on their Web sites. But as a fundamen-
tal analyst, it’s important to know how to get the data direct from the source: 
The SEC’s IDEA database.
Pulling fundamental data from 
Web sites into spreadsheets
Sometimes reading a company’s financial statements using the SEC’s IDEA isn’t 
enough. If you want to perform the analysis you’ll find out about in the next 
part of this book, you’ll likely need to download the data into a spreadsheet. 
 
If the company you’re analyzing provides XBRL data, it’s easy to download 
into a spreadsheet. 

67
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
Luckily, there’s a handy trick using Microsoft Excel all fundamental analysts 
should know about. While it’s possible to cut-and-paste the financial data 
from a company filing into a spreadsheet, the results can be a disorganized 
mess. Instead, use an Excel function that’s built to order. Here’s how: 
 
1. Open the filing. 
 
 Find the filing you’re interested in downloading using the steps above. 
Copy the Web address from the address bar in your browser by high-
lighting the address and holding the Control button and the C key.
 
2. Open Microsoft Excel.
 
3. Instruct Excel to find the filing.
 
 Choose Excel’s “Data” pull-down menu, and then select Import External 
Data and then New Web Query.
 
4. Provide the Web address of the filing. 
 
 Paste the filing’s address by holding down the Control button and 
choose the V key, in the address bar at the top. 
 
5. Import the filing.
 
 Click the Import button at the bottom of the page.
 
6. Select the relevant financial data.
 
 Scroll down until you see the financial data you would like to download. 
Click the small yellow arrow next to the data.
After you follow these steps, the financial information you want, such as the 
company’s income statement or balance sheet, will automatically appear in 
a spreadsheet. This will be a handy skill that can help you with the analysis 
you’d do later in the book.
Finding stocks’ dividend histories
Dividends are periodic cash payments some companies make to their share-
holders. The dividends are paid out of the company’s cash as a way of return-
ing profits to the shareholders. Dividends are a very important piece of your 
total return on an investment. 
 
Don’t ignore dividends. These cash payments, over time, account for about 
one-third of the total return investors make on the market, according to 
Standard & Poor’s. The remaining two-thirds of total return come from the 
stock price rising.

68
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
Dividends are also important ways to help value a company, as you will discover 
in Chapter 8. Companies that pay dividends generally pay them quarterly. 
The best way to look up a dividend history is on the company’s Web site. 
Going back to the GE example, go to www.ge.com and click on the investor 
relations link at the top of the page. Next, click on the Stock Information link 
on the left-hand side. You’ll see a link for Dividend History, which listed GE’s 
dividend payments going back for nearly a decade.
Getting stock-split information
When a company’s stock price rises dramatically and begins to approach $50 
a share or more, the executives might decide to split the shares. The theory 
goes that some naïve investors, who read too much into a stock’s per-share 
price, might assume a stock trading for $50 or more is too expensive. 
In a stock split, the company cuts its share price, say in half, by cutting the 
shares into multiple shares. For instance, let’s say you own 100 shares in a 
stock trading for $60 a share. If the company has a 2-for-1 split, you will sud-
denly have 200 shares, but they’ll be worth $30 apiece. Management feels some 
investors are more likely to buy stock in a company for $30 a share than $60.
 
Some investors assume that a stock split is a major boon since they suddenly 
have more shares. But, as discussed in Chapter 3, the per-share price of a 
stock doesn’t tell you much. The value of your shares is still $6,000, whether 
you own 100 shares at $60 or 200 shares at $30 a share. The company’s market 
value also stays the same. 
Understanding when stock splits occur is important for fundamental analy-
sis, though, since it can affect the number of shares outstanding, which is 
described in Chapter 3. You’ll need an accurate count of shares outstanding 
to do some of the fundamental analysis later in the book. 
Fortunately, many companies provide stock-split histories on their Web sites. 
For instance, if you follow the instructions above to get GE’s dividends, you’ll 
notice stock splits are listed on the same page. 
MSN Money also helps you look up if, and when, a company split its shares. 
Here’s how: 
 
1. Log into www.live.com.
 
2. Enter “quote:” in the search box followed by the stock’s symbol. 
 
 For GE, for instance, enter quote:GE and click the green icon that looks 
like a magnifying glass. 

69
 Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 
3. Click on the small stock chart that appears in the search results. 
 
 This will take you to MSN’s Charting feature. 
 
4. Click on the Download MSN Money Investment Toolbox link that 
appears in the chart. 
 
 This will download a small piece of software that will let you get 
advanced charts. You only need to follow this step once. 
 
5. Observe the chart. 
 
 If the stock has been split, you’ll see a small box that’s half white and 
half red. For instance, the chart tells you that GE last split its stock, by 3 
for 1, on May 8, 2000.

How to Perform 
Fundamental 
Analysis

In this part . . .
You may already know what fundamental analysis is, 
but you may not be clear on how to use this impor-
tant technique to evaluate investments. I’ve designed this 
part to step you through how to thoroughly analyze a 
company and dig into its key financial statements, includ-
ing the income statement, the balance sheet, and the 
statement of cash flow. I also show you how financial 
ratios can help you get quick and insightful information 
about companies. Lastly, you can discover how to unearth 
some of the more sensitive items about a company’s man-
agement by using the proxy statement.

Chapter 5
Analyzing a Company’s Profitability 
Using the Income Statement
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what a company’s profit is and how it’s reflected on the income statement
▶ Finding out why learning to analyze the income statement is key to fundamental analysis
▶ Digging into how to read an income statement and to understand a company better
▶ Discovering how to compare a company’s reported profit to what is expected
I
n everything from sports to school, you’ve probably been trained to 
measure results. At the end of the game or class semester, you either get 
a score or grade that determines how well or poorly you did, and how you 
measured up to expectations and ranked against your peers. 
When you measure the success of a company, you really don’t do anything 
differently than when you gauge the results of last night’s basketball game. 
Fundamental analysts carefully evaluate a company’s income statement to 
see how well the company did, examining how much money it brought in, 
how much it spent to operate, and the final amount of profit it generated. 
Companies lay out all of their critical information for you in their income 
statement. In this chapter, you dig into the parts of the income statement 
necessary for fundamental analysis. Better yet, this chapter gives you the 
tools to know how to read those parts, which is critical when you want to 
determine whether a company’s stock is cheap or expensive (see Chapters 10 
and 11 for more on determining a stock’s worth). Don’t let the cryptic appear-
ance of the income statement scare you. The pointers in this chapter prepare 
you to get everything you need out of the income statement.

74
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Digging Deep Into the Income Statement
When you invest in a company by buying its stock, you’re probably not doing 
it to be charitable. By buying shares of stock, you’re claiming a piece of the 
company’s future revenue and profits. If all goes well, the company will grow 
and your stake will become more valuable. 
The trick, though, is knowing how to make sure the company is keeping its 
end of the bargain by making money. That’s where the income statement 
comes in. Companies that have issued stock on a stock market exchange 
such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, or borrow money from the 
public, are required to issue an income statement. The income statement 
spells out in gory detail how the company did during each quarter and year. 
Fundamental analysis requires you to pay close attention to the income state-
ment for any sign the company isn’t progressing as it should or, conversely, 
doing better than many thought it could. 
Cutting through to the key parts 
Luckily for investors, the accountants have somewhat standardized the way 
companies must prepare the income statement. No two income statements 
look identical, and subtle differences can make comparing one company’s 
income statement with other companies’ problematic, (you can read about 
making comparisons more in Chapter 16). Income statements can also vary 
a bit depending on what line of business a company is in. Still, income state-
ments tend to follow the same basic structure. 
 
You can dedicate a great deal of time obsessing over every nuance of financial 
statements, including the income statement. If that’s of interest to you, check 
out Reading Financial Reports For Dummies (Wiley), which gets into the nitty-
gritty of financial reporting. In this book, though, you’ll get a look at the basic 
layout of the income statement and what you’ll need to do some serious fun-
damental analysis. 
The basic structure of an income statement includes these items:
 
✓ Revenue: This is how much money the company brought in by selling 
goods and services. Revenue is often called the “top line.”
 
✓ Cost of goods sold: It takes money to make money. Cost of goods mea-
sures what a company must spend to actually create the good or service 
sold. These are direct costs, meaning they are costs for items that may 
literally go into the products. Cost of goods sold, for many manufacturing

 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
companies, is the largest single cost of doing business. For instance, with 
an automaker, the cost of goods sold might include the cost of steel used 
to build the cars. 
 
✓ Operating expenses: Indirect expenses are incurred by companies as 
they conduct business, but may not go directly into the product. These 
costs are usually necessary or important, but peripheral. These indi-
rect costs are called operating expenses or better known as overhead. 
Operating expenses may include:
 
• Marketing expenses: Include advertising and other promotional 
expenses.
 
• Research and development: What a company spends to cook up 
new products or services to sell to customers. 
 
• Administrative expenses: Expenses connected with support 
staff, such as legal, human resources, and other functions that are 
directly tied to manufacturing the product. 
 
✓ Other income: Companies sometimes bring in money for things other 
than selling products and services. This income is recorded as other 
income. For instance, a company might win a legal settlement or sell a 
factory.
 
✓ Other expenses. Similarly to how other income doesn’t qualify as reve-
nue, other expenses do not qualify as normal operating expenses. Other 
expenses might include the cost to restructure a unit of the company, 
paying severance to lay off employees, or depreciation — accounting for 
wear and tear (see the sidebar, “Appreciating depreciation”). 
 
✓ Earnings before interest and taxes. After you subtract cost of goods 
sold, operating expenses, and other expenses from revenue, what you’re 
left with is earnings before interest and taxes. 
 
✓ Interest expense. Most companies borrow money to fund their opera-
tions or to buy inventory. Here, the company discloses how much it’s 
paying to borrow money.
 
✓ Taxes. Companies must pay taxes too. Here, companies disclose how 
much they they paid to Uncle Sam. 
 
✓ Net income. Finally, after paying all these costs and expenses, what’s 
left is the profit, or net income. This is how much the company earned 
during the period, based on accounting rules or GAAP.
 
Ever hear a company say it used GAAP? No I don’t mean that they used 
expense accounts to buy khakis and collared shirts at a popular clothing 
store. Instead, I’m talking about GAAP — Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles — painstakingly detailed rules that instruct companies on the right 
way to report results.

Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Taking in the Top Line: Revenue
For a fundamental analyst reading an income statement, revenue is a critical 
item because it tells you how: 
 
✓ Rapidly the company is growing (or shrinking): Comparing revenue 
generated during a year or quarter with revenue reported in the same 
period a year ago can be very telling. This simple comparison tells you 
whether the company’s growth is on an uptrend or downtrend.
 
✓ Strong demand is for a company’s products: Companies love to brag 
about how popular their products are. But revenue is where hype can 
be quantified. Strong demand for a product will show up in the revenue 
line, even if the company’s expenses are out of line and still losing 
money.
  
✓ A company ranks in sheer size next to its rivals: While there are many 
ways to measure a company’s size, such as number of employees, rev-
enue is as good a benchmark as any other. If you want to find out which 
company is the biggest in a competitive field, you should always check 
out revenue first. 
 
Fundamental analysts pay close attention to revenue for the reasons listed 
above, but there’s also reason to be skeptical. Accounting rules give compa-
nies a great deal of leeway in how and when they record or “recognize” rev-
enue. The most classic distortion may occur when a company books revenue 
before the product is actually bought or received by a customer. Regulators, 
for this reason, warned companies to be more conservative when booking 
revenue. The General Accounting Office, a unit of the government charged 
to study waste in both the private and public sectors, found that improper 
revenue recognition was to blame for more than a third of misstated financial 
statements. Always be skeptical of revenue. 
Appreciating depreciation
Accountants normally classify depreciation 
as an other expense. This can sometimes be 
a tough thing for nonaccountants to under-
stand. Depreciation is an accounting method of 
recording wear and tear on things like factories 
or equipment. Think of it this way. If you buy a 
car for $15,000, in a year’s time that car might 
only be worth $13,000. But while you’re out 
$2,000 in value, you didn’t actually have to write 
a check for $2,000 to anyone. The same applies 
to a machine a company might use to make 
products. The erosion of value of the machine 
is an expense that goes into the cost of making 
the product being sold.

 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
Breaking down a company’s revenue
Most companies will provide several revenue figures. Generally, there will be 
a total revenue line that totals up the money the company brought in from all 
its business units. But if the company is complex, it might break total revenue 
down into its component parts so you can see which units are performing best. 
Due to its large size and wide array of technology businesses, International 
Business Machines is a great example of how you can use the revenue line to 
peer deeply into a company’s operations. Below, in Table 5-1, is a breakdown 
of IBM’s 2008 results, to give you an idea of how digging into what makes up 
total revenue can be revealing about a business:

As you can see above, had you just looked at total revenue you would have 
missed a helpful breakdown in IBM’s business. Dissecting IBM’s revenue into 
units gives you several key findings, including a:
 
✓ Sense of a company’s business diversification. While IBM is best known 
for making large corporate computer systems, in reality the company 
gets its revenue from a swath of technology businesses. No single line of 
business accounts for more than 38% of total revenue. As a fundamental 
analyst, this is important information because it tells you whether IBM 
is overly concentrated in an area of technology you’re not optimistic 
about. Similarly, this analysis will tell you if the company exposes you to 
the area of technology you want to invest in. For instance, if you want to 
invest in technology hardware, IBM probably isn’t the best for you.

78
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Indication of the most important business at the company. Investors 
may not realize it, but IBM is more of a technology services firm than 
anything else. It got 38% of its revenue from services in 2008.
 
✓ Clue of reliance on noncore businesses. Over the years, it’s common 
for large companies to branch into businesses that are outside their core 
business. Several large companies, like General Electric and General 
Motors, have practically spawned banks as they extend credit to cus-
tomers buying their products. Straying from a core business is some-
thing you, as a fundamental analyst, need to pay close attention to. With 
IBM, you can see the company has a financing business that provides 
loans to customers. However, the financing business is a very small por-
tion of its total operation at about 3% of revenue.
 
If you want to figure out how large a unit of a company is, divide the unit’s rev-
enue by total revenue and multiply the result by 100. Using IBM’s financing unit 
as an example, divide the unit’s revenue of $2.6 billion by IBM’s total revenue 
of $103.6 to arrive at 0.025. Multiply 0.025 by 100 to convert the result into a 
percentage of 2.5%. 
Keeping tabs on a company’s growth
If there’s one thing many investors will agree on, it’s the importance for a 
company to keep growing. As the prices of raw materials rise, it’s critical 
for companies to keep up by increasing revenue either by raising prices or 
creating new products with higher price tags. Even if you’re investing in a 
mature industry, just looking for a stable return, you still want to see revenue 
increasing over time so the company’s earnings keep up with inflation. 
Finding out how rapidly a company is growing is simple if you know your way 
around the income statement. Here’s what you need to know: 
 
1. Download the historical revenue data. 
 
 You’ll first need to get your hands on the revenue data. The best way to 
do this is by downloading the income statement from an online source. 
You can review how to do this in Chapter 4. 
 
2. Pull out the revenue line item for several years. 
 
 In most cases, one of the very first lines in the income statement is total 
revenue. Pull out total revenue from the income statement and place it 
in a spreadsheet or write it down so you can do further analysis.
 
 Again using IBM as an example, Table 5-2 show you how to put IBM’s 
total revenue into a format you can further analyze.

79
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
 
3. Calculate the year-to-year percentage change. 
 
 Now that you have each year’s total revenue in one place, you can 
calculate the company’s revenue growth from year to year. Calculating 
percentage changes is covered in more depth in Chapter 4. But the way 
I like to remember this is that you subtract the “old” number from the 
“new” number, then divide by the “old” number and multiply by 100. 
 
 Consider an example calculating IBM’s 2008 revenue growth:
 
 $103.6 (2008 revenue, the “new” number) – $98.8 (2007 revenue, the 
“old” number) / $98.8 (2007 revenue, the “old number”) = 0.049. 
 
 Then multiply 0.049 by 100 to convert the number into a percentage, 
which is 4.9%. This analysis show you IBM’s total revenue grew by 4.9% 
in 2008. 
  
4. Repeat step 3 for each year so you can see a multiyear trend. 
 
 One year’s revenue change doesn’t really tell you much. The fact that 
IBM’s revenue grew 4.9% is of limited value unless you compare it with 
something else. You may compare IBM’s growth to its competitors’ 
growth, as you will read more about in Chapter 16. But for now, you will 
want to see how 2008 revenue growth compares with growth in past 
years. I’ll save you the trouble by calculating the percentage changes 
and presenting them in Table 5-3.
 
 Now that you have each year’s revenue growth, you can see just how 
rocky revenue can be, even at a large company like IBM. You’ll notice rev-
enue grew by as much as 9.7% in 2003, and shrunk by up to 5.4% in 2005. 
Understanding just how uneven revenue growth can be from year to year, 
is critical to the work of fundamental analysis because you can see if a 
firm is cyclical. A cyclical company is one that experiences large swings in 
revenue based on the health of the overall economy. As an investor, you 
might not be willing to pay as much for shares of a cyclical company if the 
economy is about to enter into a period of slower growth.
 
 Resist the temptation to take simple averages of revenue growth and 
assume that average growth will continue forever. For instance, if you aver-
aged IBM’s growth between 2001 and 2008 by adding up the growth num-
bers and dividing by the total number of years, you’d find the company 
grew, on average, by 2.6% a year. But fundamental analysts dig deeper and 
study year-to-year changes, to see how revenue ebbs and flows. 
 
 Don’t forget to also calculate the percentage changes of growth in the 
different business units. Taking the time to see how rapidly different 
parts of the business are growing can give you a peek into the com-
pany’s direction. At IBM in 2008, for instance, the software unit grew the 
most rapidly by rising 10.5% over 2007, while the systems and technol-
ogy unit shrunk by 9.5%. As a fundamental analyst, you might look into 
IBM’s software unit further for more explanation.

What are the company’s costs?
With very few exceptions, companies don’t keep all the money they collect 
from customers. A good portion of the revenue goes out to pay direct costs, 
such as raw materials, and indirect costs like overhead and advertising. All 
these costs are recorded in the income statement so investors may see how 
much a company spent to generate revenue. 

81
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
Digging into costs
If you’re beginning to notice a trend here, one of the biggest skills in fundamen-
tal analysis is the ability to tear apart the numbers and see what comprises 
them. Analyzing a company’s costs is a great example. While some investors 
just look at total expenses, or maybe consider cost of goods sold and operating 
expenses, there’s much intelligence to be had by digging deeper. 
To show you what I mean, let’s crack open the financial can on Campbell 
Soup. The income statement shows you how much it costs to make a can of 
soup, among the other products the company manufacturers, as you can see 
in Table 5-4.

Is a company an international player?
As companies find themselves competing glob-
ally, fundamental analysts need to understand 
how important sales outside the U.S. are to a 
company. Analyzing revenue will give you great 
detail on a company’s global footprint. 
Most companies will break out what percent-
age of their revenue came from different parts 
of the world, if not in the income statement, in 
the notes of an earnings press release issued 
to shareholders or in the regulatory filings. You 
can read more about where to get these docu-
ments in Chapter 4.

82
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Again, don’t let the table of numbers overwhelm you. Fundamental analysts 
rely on two simple but powerful techniques to convert a pile of numbers into 
meaningful data. With just a little math, you’ll be able to analyze the data and 
paint a picture that tells you a great deal about Campbell Soup. 
First, common-size the costs and expenses. Again, just looking at Campbell 
Soup’s costs and expenses don’t tell you much at first. You want to put them 
into perspective by comparing them with something. One of the best tricks 
used in fundamental analysis is common-sizing. Common-sizing is simply 
taking lines on financial statements and quantifying their size by comparing 
them to a total. When common-sizing is applied to the income statement, 
you compare each expense to revenue. That way, you can easily see whether 
the company’s expenses are growing at an alarming pace compared with the 
growth of the business. 
Best of all, common-sizing is simple. All you need to do is divide each cost 
and expense by total revenue and multiply by 100 to convert the number into 
a percentage. Start with Campbell Soup’s cost of goods sold in 2008. Divide 
the cost of goods sold of $4,827 by the company’s total revenue of $7,998 and 
multiply by 100. You should get 60.4%. In other words, the cost of making 
soup and other products cost 60.4 cents of every dollar of revenue. Next, 
follow the same directions for all the costs on Campbell Soup’s income state-
ment. Table 5-5 shows you what you’ll find when you’re done.
Table 5-5

Looking at the numbers above, you’ll probably notice that the percentages 
haven’t changed much from 2007 to 2008. That is likely a sign that the com-
pany is doing a good job keeping the growth of expenses in check and moving 

83
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
at pace with the business. The one very slight exception is the cost of goods 
sold. In 2007, the company spent 59.4% of revenue on costs to produce prod-
ucts. That went up very slightly in 2008. It’s a minor change, but points to an 
issue that’s worth digging further into. Perhaps the company’s raw materials 
costs rose slightly, or more customers are buying goods that cost slightly 
more to make. 
 
When you common-size an income statement, it’s often best to use several 
years of data so you can see the trends from year to year. If a company’s 
research and development budget is soaring, for instance, you’ll spot the 
trend. Often an unusual blip on the common-sizing will clue you into some-
thing worth looking further into. 
Next, measure the growth of costs and expenses. It’s also important to keep 
tabs on how rapidly costs and expenses are growing from year to year. 
Measure the growth of costs and expenses in the same way as measuring the 
growth in revenue above. 
What is the company’s bottom line? 
After paying all the bills, including all the direct costs, operating expenses 
and taxes, what’s left is the company’s net profit. 
The basic formula is as follows: 
Revenue – cost of goods sold – operating expenses + other income – 
other expenses – interest expense – taxes = Net Income
Net income is the end-all be-all for many investors. It’s the number that is 
used to see how a company did compared with the past and versus expec-
tations investors had. You will want to see how rapidly net income grew or 
shrunk compared with previous years. 
 
If you notice that a company’s net income is growing more slowly than 
revenue, that’s a quick tip-off that its expenses might be running amuck. 
An efficient way to see how net income is faring next to revenue is to calcu-
late the year-over-year percentage changes for revenue and for net income. 
By placing the growth of revenue and net income side-by-side, you’ll see, very 
quickly, how well the company is controlling costs as demand for its prod-
ucts rises and falls. 

84
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Calculating Profit Margins and 
Finding Out What They Mean
If you hear that a company made $400 million last year, you recognize that 
sounds like quite a bit of money. But, fundamental analysis requires taking 
things a step farther. Fundamental analysis gives you the tools to put net 
income into perspective and understand what it means for you as an investor. 
Differences between the 
types of profit margins
One of the best ways to size up a company’s profit is by studying profit margins. 
At its most basic level, a profit margin is how much a company has left after 
paying for its expenses. However, there are several ways to measure profit mar-
gins, all of which are instructive in fundamental analysis. There are three main 
types of profit margins fundamental analysts should be aware of, including: 
Gross profit margin
A company’s gross profit is one of the simplest ways to look at profitability. 
Gross profit is what’s left of revenue after subtracting direct costs, also 
known as cost of goods sold. Gross margin measures how much the company 
makes after paying costs directly connected with producing the product. 
The gross profit margin takes things a bit further by comparing gross profit 
with a company’s revenue. In other words, the gross profit margin tells you 
how much of revenue is kept, after paying direct costs, relative to sales. 
Here’s an example: Caterpillar. The maker of earthmoving and construction 
equipment reported revenue of $51.3 billion in 2008, and its cost of goods 
sold reached $39.6 billion. By subtracting $39.6 billion from $51.3 billion, you 
find Caterpillar’s gross profit was $11.70 billion. That’s great, but doesn’t tell 
you much. Here’s where fundamental analysis comes in. Divide the compa-
ny’s $11.70 billion gross profit by its total revenue of $51.3 billion and 
multiply by 100. This quick division tells you Caterpillar had a gross margin 
of 22.8%. 
What’s that mean in plain English? After paying for direct costs, such as steel 
and laborers’ time on the assembly line, Caterpillar kept nearly 23 cents of 
every dollar in revenue. Just to give you an idea what gross margins typically 
are, among the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the average 

85
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
gross margin is about 45.1, says Thomson Reuters. The fact Caterpillar’s 
gross margin is lower shows just how much of the firm’s costs are concen-
trated in raw materials and other direct costs. 
 
Gross profit margin is not as useful when studying software and Internet com-
panies. A vast majority of the cost of producing software is overhead, and not 
direct costs. That’s one reason why Microsoft has very large gross profit mar-
gins. For instance, Microsoft kept 81 cents of every dollar of sales after paying 
direct costs during its fiscal 2008 year, which ended June 30, 2008. But its 
operating margin, which reflects a more accurate picture of the cost to create 
software, is much lower, as we’ll discuss next.
Operating profit margin
A company’s operating profit is one step more sophisticated than the gross 
margin. Operating profit not only factors in a company’s direct costs, but 
indirect costs, too. Operating profit is what’s left of revenue after subtracting 
overhead costs.
Taking things a step further is the operating profit margin. The operating 
profit margin is calculated by dividing operating profit by revenue. It tells 
you how much the company keeps of revenue after paying direct costs and 
overhead. Operating profit margins are critical indicators for fundamental 
analysis, since they give a good idea of how profitable a firm is with respect 
to its core business. 
Going back to Microsoft shows clearly why for some businesses, the operat-
ing profit margin is more meaningful than gross profit margin. The operating 
margin includes the costs of research and development and advertising, for 
instance, which are important to generating successful software products. 
Table 5-6 shows you how operating profit margin is calculated.
Here you can see why Microsoft is considered to be such a profitable com-
pany, with its enviable 36.9% operating profit margin. This operating profit 
margin is about double the average 18% operating profit margin of companies 
in the Standard & Poor’s 500, says Thomson Reuters. 
 
Some fundamental analysts take issue with operating profit, because it 
includes some expenses that are not actual costs. For instance, operating 
profit subtracts depreciation from revenue, even though depreciation isn’t an 
actual bill the company must pay. For this reason, some fundamental analysts 
recommend ignoring some of these intangible expenses when understanding 
how much a company is worth, as will be discussed further in Chapter 11.

Net profit margin
A company’s net profit or net income is the most comprehensive measure of 
profitability. Net profit tells you how many dollars the company kept after 
paying all its costs and expenses. The net profit margin, which is net profit 
divided by total revenue, tells you how much of every dollar in sales the com-
pany keeps after paying all costs and expenses. 
Companies can lose money, too. When that happens, it’s called a net loss. 
At its simplest level, net profit is operating profit minus everything else. 
Finding out about earnings per share
You might be wondering by now, “Okay great, the company made millions of 
dollars. Wonderful. So, what’s in it for me?”
That’s exactly what earnings per share is all about. Usually, one of the last 
items listed on a company’s income statement is earnings per share, most 
commonly known as EPS. If net income tells you how large a pie is, EPS tells 
you, the fundamental analyst, how big your slice is. 
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding at 
the company. A company’s number of shares outstanding is the total number 
of shares that are owned by members of the public as well as restricted shares 
held by officers and directors of the company. Restricted stock shares are 
given to individuals with close connections to the company, such as the 
executive team of a company that was acquired. Restricted stock comes with 

87
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
strings attached, which may bar the owners from selling for a certain amount 
of time. The number of shares a company has outstanding is available on the 
balance sheet, to be discussed more fully in Chapter 6. 
Everything you really need to know, though, is right on the income statement, 
including: 
 
✓ Basic earnings per share: This measure tells you how much of a slice of 
the company’s net profit you’re entitled to as a shareholder. The formula 
in its simplest form is:
 
 Net income / number of shares outstanding
 
 Some companies have special classes of stock, called preferred stock. 
These dividends, if paid, should be subtracted from net income in the 
formula above when calculating basic earnings per share. 
 
✓ Diluted earnings per share: When you read in the newspaper about 
how much a company earned, you’re most likely reading about diluted 
earnings per share. Diluted EPS measures how much the company 
earned based on each share of stock. If you think of net income as a 
pizza, diluted EPS tells you how big of a slice you’re entitled to. Diluted 
EPS is commonly used because it’s the most conservative. It divides net 
income by the total number of shares that could possibly be outstand-
ing, including the impact of employees converting their stock options 
into real shares. 
 
Never underestimate the danger of employee stock options on the value of 
your claim to a company’s earnings. When employees are given options, and 
those options become valuable either because the employee works at the 
company for a set period of time or the stock rises, those shares can be con-
verted into real shares. The avalanche of shares can water down, or dilute, 
how much of a claim you have on the company’s earnings. This is called dilu-
tion, and is a big reason why you need to carefully compare basic EPS with 
diluted EPS. If diluted EPS is dramatically less than basic EPS, that’s a signal 
employees might be holding large baskets of options. 
Comparing a Company’s 
Profit to Expectations
Ever notice how a company’s stock price falls, even after the company posts 
a huge increase in earnings? You can learn more about how to use informa-
tion from the income statement to determine stock prices in Chapter 10. But 
it’s critical to realize that profits and earnings don’t always move in lockstep 
with stock prices. 

88
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
It’s true that over time, a company with rising revenue and earnings will likely 
see its stock price rise, too. And as discussed in Chapter 3, correctly forecast-
ing how to determine how much a company will earn and how much it will be 
worth in the future can be great for long-term success. Fundamental analysts 
can help you determine whether a stock is cheap or expensive relative to the 
company’s revenue and earnings. 
But in the short term, stock prices and earnings can seemingly have nothing 
to do with each other. And that’s where the skill, and a bit of luck, comes in 
when you try to match fundamental analysis with stock prices. The fact is 
that in the short term, stocks rise and fall largely based on how a company’s 
earnings compare with what’s expected. 
The importance of investors’ expectations
Remember, when you’re studying a company’s income statement, you’re not 
alone. There are hundreds, if not thousands of other investors looking at the 
same numbers and trying to place a price on the stock. They then buy and 
sell based on their fundamental analysis, to establish the current price. 
If the company’s revenue and earnings match what most people were expect-
ing, that means the current stock price was likely correctly set. Only if the 
other investors were way off will the stock move much higher or lower after a 
company releases its income statement. You will discover more on this topic 
later in the book. But the role of expectations for earnings is important to dis-
cuss now since it shows that just because you master the income statement 
doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily be a successful investor. 
Comparing actual financial 
results with expectations
Even before a company puts out its income statement, analysts and other 
investors have had a chance to guess what they think the company will earn. 
These earnings estimates are usually based on diluted earnings per share. 
These estimates are available online at many places, but below are instruc-
tions on how to find them at MSN Money. 
 
1. Log into MSN Money at moneycentral.msn.com/investor.
 
2. Enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in the box in the upper 
left-hand corner of the screen and click the “Get Quote” button.

89
 Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
 
3. Click on the “Earnings Estimates” option listed in the navigation bar 
on the left-hand side of the screen.
 
4. Find the earnings number in the “Average Estimate” row under the 
quarter you’re interested in. That’s the earnings estimate.
Once the company reports its earnings, you can then compare the actual 
earnings with the estimate.
It can be tricky to get an apples-to-apples comparison between the analysts’ 
EPS estimate and the actual reported EPS from the company. While analysts 
will usually forecast operating earnings, companies may sometimes include 
unusual and nonrecurring items that make comparison with the estimate 
problematic. For that reason, many companies attempt to help investors by 
offering pro forma earnings. Pro forma earnings don’t follow GAAP. Instead, 
adjustments are made by the company to make the reported EPS match the 
estimate. 
 
Pro forma earnings can be helpful when you’re trying to see if a company’s 
earnings beat, matched or missed earnings estimates. But pro forma earn-
ings can also be abused by companies. By not following GAAP, companies 
have great leeway in adding certain one-time gains and ignoring charges 
they’d rather you not see. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2002, 
for instance, said Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts departed from accounting 
rules and gave a misleading impression the company beat estimates when 
it reported quarterly results in October 1999. While the company told inves-
tors it was leaving out a one-time $81.4 million charge, it didn’t disclose it also 
added a one-time gain of $17.2 million to its results. Investors assumed the 
company beat estimates due to strong performance, the SEC said, when in 
fact, Trump’s numbers were lifted by the gain.

F
or many investors, following how companies are doing each quarter is 
almost a sport. Some investors may read about companies’ earnings and 
revenue, just as sports fans follow the track records of their favorite teams. 
And certainly, knowing how well a company is doing, or how strong its busi-
ness is operating, is an important part of fundamental analysis. But knowing 
about earnings and revenue is just the tip of the fundamental analysis ice-
berg. Fundamental analysts not only know how a company is doing, but what 
kind of financial shape it’s in. 
And that’s why it’s important for you to understand how to dig into a com-
pany’s balance sheet. The balance sheet is a financial statement that tells you 
if a company is financially healthy. A strong balance sheet, or one that’s rich 
in cash and low on debt, can help a company endure a severe but temporary 
downturn in its business. 
In this chapter, you’ll take a tour of the balance sheet and gain an under-
standing of how this financial statement can help improve the results of your 
fundamental analysis.

Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Balance Sheet
If you’ve ever calculated your personal net worth, you already have a pretty 
good understanding of what a company’s balance sheet is. When you tally 
up your net worth, you generally perform a quick calculation that might look 
something like this: 
Value of things you own – value of things you owe = net worth
Consider this simple personal finance situation: You bought a $200,000 house, 
put 20% down ($40,000) and borrowed the rest ($160,000). Meanwhile, you 
have $20,000 in your savings account. You would calculate your net worth 
like this: 
$200,000 (home value) + $20,000 (savings) – $160,000 (loan amount) = 
$60,000 net worth
Keep this example in mind as you learn about how a company measures its 
assets, liabilities, and equity, as explained next.
Separating your assets 
from your liabilities
Just as biologists classify living creatures by placing them in a genus and 
species, accountants attempt to put everything companies own and owe into 
three buckets. Those buckets are:
 
✓ Assets: Things a company owns. These might include tangible assets, 
such as physical manufacturing plants or raw materials sitting in a ware-
house. Assets, too, might be intangible. Intangible assets are things like 
patents and trademarks, which have value even though you can’t touch 
them. 
 
✓ Liabilities: Things a company owes. Usually, liabilities include debt the 
company is on the hook for. 
 
✓ Shareholders’ equity (or just equity): What’s left of a company’s assets 
after accounting for its liabilities. Technically, equity represents all the 
money put into the company by investors and the portion of the profits 
the company has held onto. When companies hold onto earnings, rather 
than returning them to shareholders (often in the form a dividend), they 
are called retained earnings. It’s the equivalent to your own net worth. 

93
 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
The most basic equation of business
Once accountants place a company’s assets and liabilities into the proper 
buckets, it’s possible to apply some basic math. And the calculation you use 
to measure your net worth is practically identical to how companies measure 
their shareholders’ equity. The formula companies use is just rearranged a 
bit and the terms are different. 
 
Companies don’t necessarily refer to net worth. Net worth is more of a term 
used in personal finance. Instead, the difference between what companies own 
and what they owe is called shareholders’ equity. 
So, here’s the most basic formula used in business and the fundamental 
building block behind the balance sheet: 
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
As you can see, this formula states a company’s assets must equal the sum 
of what it owes and what the shareholders own (shareholders’ equity). At all 
times, a company’s assets must equal the sum of its liabilities and equity. The 
fact that both sides of this equation must be equal, or balance, is where the 
balance sheet gets its name. Clever, I know. 
 
Some investors have an easier time understanding the fundamental formula 
used on the balance sheet by picturing it visually. For you right-brained read-
ers out there, below in Table 6-1 is a diagram that’s often scribbled on the 
blackboard in Accounting 101 classes. 
Understanding the Parts 
of the Balance Sheet
Now that you understand the basic structure of the balance sheet, it’s time 
to start picking it apart. To do this, first know assets, liabilities, and equity 
can each be broken down further into smaller, more telling components. 
Deconstructing a company’s assets, liabilities and equity can be extremely 
useful in understanding how a company funds itself and keeps paying the 
bills by managing its ready-and-available cash, called working capital. 
 
When you dissect a balance sheet, you begin to gain deeper knowledge about 
all the moving parts that make up a company. The balance sheet tells you 
what a company owns, what it’s borrowing, and where it gets the money to 
keep itself in operation.

Covering your bases with assets 
The best place to start exploring a company’s balance sheet is its list of 
assets. The portion of the balance sheet that records a company’s assets 
typically has the following parts:
 
✓ Current assets: A company’s current assets are things it owns that could 
theoretically be sold for cash within a year. These assets, also called 
short-term assets, are those the company can tap reasonable quickly to 
meet immediate cash obligations. Current assets can be further broken 
down into:
 
• Cash: This is the easiest asset to understand. Companies have sav-
ings accounts, too, and keep cash handy to pay bills. 
 
• Cash equivalents: Companies will sometimes invest cash that’s 
stockpiled in short-term and high-quality investments that can 
be quickly sold. These investments give companies liquidity, or 
access to cash, but allow them to earn a slightly higher return that 
just holding cash. 
 
 When many fundamental analysts refer to a company’s cash, they 
are usually including cash equivalents in addition to cold-hard cash.
 
• Marketable securities: Sometimes companies have cash available 
that they don’t need immediately, but expect they might need 
within a year. They might invest this cash in high-quality debt that 
matures in a quarter or two. These investments are relatively safe, 
but not as readily accessible as actual cash or cash equivalents. 
 
• Accounts receivable: When companies sell a product, they often 
don’t collect the cash right away. If you buy a book, for instance, 
you might use your credit card and the merchant isn’t paid imme-
diately. These short-term IOUs are called accounts receivable. 
 
• Inventories: Companies must spend money to accumulate the 
things they plan to sell. Nearly all manufacturing companies, for 
instance, must buy raw materials to make their products. The 
value of these assets show up in the inventories line. 
 
• Prepaid expenses. If a company pays a bill ahead of time, it has a 
credit with the supplier or merchant. That credit is an asset, since 
it reduces what the company must spend in the future. 

95
 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
 
✓ Long-term liabilities:
 
• Property, plant and equipment. Assets that cannot be turned 
into cash in a year are called long-term assets. One of the biggest 
groups of long-term assets include a company’s property, plant and 
equipment, nicknamed PP&E. These assets include buildings and 
other machinery and computers a company might own. For an oil 
company, for instance, PP&E might be oil rigs used to pull crude 
out of the earth. 
 
• Goodwill. Goodwill is an asset you can’t feel or touch, making it 
intangible. Goodwill usually appears on a company’s balance sheet 
after it buys another company. Goodwill is the amount paid for 
another company, above that company’s actual value according to 
accounting rules. The extra amount paid is considered an asset on 
the acquiring company’s balance sheet. 
 
• Other intangibles. Goodwill isn’t the only asset a company might 
have that can’t be touched or seen. Patents, brands and trade-
marks, for instance, have value even though they’re not physical 
items. 
 
• Total assets. All of the assets are added up to create a grand total 
of everything the company owns. This is called total assets and 
will be a number that’s used frequently in analysis, especially with 
financial ratios discussed in Chapter 8. 
 
Total assets is an important number on the balance sheet. It must, and will, 
match the total of the company’s liabilities and equity. 
Just to give you an idea of what to expect when perusing the asset section of 
a balance sheet, Figure 6-1 shows you the top section of Hershey Food’s 2007 
balance sheet. 
Getting in touch with a 
company’s liabilities
Just like it seems there’s always a bill in your mailbox when you open it, the 
same goes for companies. During the normal course of business, companies 
have hungry suppliers and service providers who demand to be paid for 
their products or services. But bills are just one form of liabilities companies 
have. The liabilities section of a balance sheet breaks down everything com-
panies owe into these parts: 
 
✓ Current liabilities: If a company has bills that are due within a year’s 
time, they’re considered to be current liabilities. Not paying these bills 
usually means trouble for a company. Current liabilities come in several 
flavors fundamental analysts need to be aware of:

96
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
• Accounts payable: Companies don’t typically have to pay right 
away for things they buy. Suppliers will usually extend trade credit 
to companies, giving them at least 30 days or even longer to pay 
for certain supplies, raw materials or services. 
 
•  Short-term debt: This is the amount of debt the company must pay 
back within a year.
 
• Current portion of long-term debt: Typically companies arrange 
to borrow money for many years. A portion of that long-term debt, 
though, is generally due within a year and is called the current por-
tion of long-term debt. 
 
• Other current liabilities. Here’s the catch-all bucket for liabilities 
that don’t quite fit anywhere else. 
 
✓ Long-term liabilities:
 
• Long-term debt: The costs of starting and maintaining a business 
can be massive. As a result, some companies turn to lenders to 
borrow money from, and if they’re lucky, they can line up long-term 
debt that doesn’t have to be paid for more than a year or longer. 
 
 Keeping an eye on a company’s long-term debt load is critical. 
While only the current portion is due within a year, the year of 
debt may come due shortly. If the company is unable to pay the 
debt or refinance it by borrowing from someone else, the company 
may default. When a company defaults, the lenders may threaten to 
take control of the company. 
 
• Other long-term liabilities: This includes liabilities, due in more 
than a year, that don’t fit in any of the other categories. A company 
will break down liabilities that are in here in the footnotes to the 
financial statements. The footnotes, typically available in a compa-
ny’s 10-Q or 10-K, provide a more detailed breakdown of liabilities. 
 
• Deferred income taxes: Companies must keep two sets of financial 
statements. There’s the version you see, which is presented in this 
book, and a version for tax purposes for the IRS. Sometimes the 
accounting for taxes can be quite different in the two sets of books. 
Deferred income taxes help reconcile the differences. If a company 
has deferred income taxes, that means it may owe taxes in the future.
The liabilities section of the balance sheet might often look like Figure 6-2, 
which is from Hershey’s 2007 10-K.

Taking stock in a company’s equity
Shareholders’ equity represents the total claim investors have on a com-
pany’s assets, free-and-clear of debt. That includes money investors injected 
into a company, in addition to profits that the company has held back, or 
retained. The equity section of many companies’ balance sheets include the 
following sections: 
 
✓ Preferred stock: Companies may issue ownership stakes that are kind of 
a blend between debt and equity. Like debt, preferred stock pays a cash 
payment that’s arranged ahead of time. However, as with common stock 
dividends, companies may suspend these preferred stock payments at 
any time. 
 
✓ Common stock: When you’re looking to buy a stake of a company, typi-
cally these are the shares you’re buying. When you look up a stock 
quote, most of the time you’re getting the price of a share of a compa-
ny’s common stock.
 
✓ Retained earnings: It’s up to a company whether or not to return its 
profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. If the company keeps 
earnings, it records the sum here. 
 
✓ Treasury stock: Sometimes not all of a company’s shares are available to 
bought or sold. A company might buy back its stock when it thinks it’s 
cheap, and put it aside. A company might also authorize to issue stock, 
but not actually issue it. Either way, the pool of unused shares are called 
treasury stock. 
 
✓ Total shareholders equity: The shareholders equity line of the balance 
sheet measures the value of shareholders’ stake in the company. 
A summary of the equity section of Hershey’s balance sheet appears below in

 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
Analyzing the Balance Sheet
Now that you understand the pieces and parts that make up the balance 
sheet, it’s time to start applying fundamental analysis. Just as you dug more 
deeply into the income statement in Chapter 5, in this section you’ll develop 
tools to glean insight from the balance sheet. 
Sizing up the balance sheet 
with common sizing
If you noticed while looking at Hershey’s balance sheet above, just looking at 
the numbers in isolation isn’t particularly useful. It’s helpful to put the assets, 
liabilities, and equity into perspective by comparing them with something. 
That’s why common sizing, a fundamental analysis tool applied with the 
income statement in Chapter 5, can be equally helpful when analyzing the 
balance sheet. 
When common sizing a balance sheet, you are attempting to show how sig-
nificant a company’s different assets, liabilities and forms of equity are to the 
entire firm. You only need three formulas to common size the entire balance 
sheet: 
 
✓ Assets: Divide each type of asset by the company’s total assets. 
 
✓ Liabilities: Divide each type of liability by the company’s total liabilities 
and stockholder’s equity. 
 
✓ Equity: Divide each category of equity by the company’s total liabilities 
and stockholders’ equity.
 
Multiply the results of the three items above by 100 to convert the figures into 
a percentage. 
Imagine if you wanted to see how much Hershey relies on borrowed money, 
versus money raised from stock investors, to fund itself. That’s a perfect 
reason to common size the liabilities portion of Hershey’s balance sheet. 
To do this, you start with Hershey’s accounts payable ($223,019) and divide it 
by total liabilities and stockholders’ equity ($4,247,113). The result is 5.3%, and 
I’ll explain what that means in a bit. First, you might want to finish common 
sizing the whole statement. Table 6-3 shows you the results of common sizing 
the key parts of the liabilities and equity portion of Hershey’s balance sheet.

Common sizing a company’s liabilities gives you an instant view of where 
Hershey gets the money to keep itself going, or its capital structure. 
Understanding a company’s capital structure is key to understanding how well 
it’s positioned to withstand an economic downturn or how profitable it will be 
during strong economic growth. 
Just by doing a few multiplication problems, you get a very unique funda-
mental look into Hershey. You can see Hershey receives its financing from a 
balanced number of sources, but leans toward relying more on debt. Hershey 
gets 20% of its financing from short-term loans, more than 30% from long-
term loans and 14% from equity. 
 
When companies rely on borrowed money to pay for their operations, it’s 
called leverage. Leverage can greatly enhance a company’s returns for stock 
holders as long as the company can comfortably keep up with its interest 
payments. Interest on debt is largely fixed, much like a monthly payment on a 
30-year fixed mortgage is static. Interest also has a tax benefit of being deduct-
ible. The question, though, is whether or not a company has borrowed too 
much. You can find out if a company is overleveraged by analyzing working 
capital, later in this chapter, and financial ratios in Chapter 8.
Looking for trends using 
index-number analysis
While balance sheets take a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities and 
equity at a set time of the year, the parts inside are constantly changing. 
When interest rates are low, for instance, a company may decide to leverage 
itself by borrowing more. Similarly, when stock prices are lofty, a company 
may choose to raise equity by selling stock. 

101
 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
 
Because assets, liabilities and equity are evolving, it’s important in fundamen-
tal analysis to pay attention to trends and changes between quarters and 
years. 
The index-number trend method is a great way to help you spot changes in a 
company’s capital structure over time. You can do an index-number analysis 
by choosing a year to be your starting point and then compare all assets, 
liabilities and equity to that point. 
For instance, if you want to start your analysis of Coca-Cola since 2005, you 
would first download the balance-sheet items for 2007, 2006, and 2005. In 
Table 6-4 you can see what some of the key parts of Coke’s balance sheet 
were in those years.

Certainly, you could eyeball the numbers above to get a general idea of the 
trends in the company’s assets and liabilities. But the index-number analysis 
is easy and will make the changes pop out. To create an index-number table, 
divide each line in the balance sheet by the corresponding value for the base 
year and then multiply by 100. 
 
For instance, to calculate the index-number value for Coke’s cash and cash 
equivalents in 2006, divide its cash and cash equivalents in 2006 ($2,590) by 
cash and cash  equivalents in 2005 ($4,767) and then multiply by 100. The 
result is 54.3. If you complete the analysis of Coke’s balance sheet, you get 
something that looks like Table 6-5.
The index-number value of the base year, 2005 in Table 6-5, will be 100. 100 is 
the baseline of our analysis.

After completing the index-number analysis of Coke, you can quickly see 
what’s going on with the company’s capital structure. The first thing that 
jumps out is the fact Coke started increasing its level of debt in 2006 and 
really ramped it up in 2007. In its 10-K, Coke acknowledged a greater use 
of leverage, primarily to pay for acquisitions such as Vitamin Water maker 
Glaceau and energy drink Fuze. As a fundamental analyst, you note this. After 
all, the company has been trying to broaden its lineup of beverages beyond 
Coke. That diversification, though, is coming with the expense of greater 
financial risk as the company must pay higher interest expense.
Appreciating working capital
When it comes to fundamental analysis, a key consideration is how prepared 
a company is to meet its short-term obligations. 
 
A company may have a very bright long-term future ahead of it, but if it can’t 
meet payroll and pay its bills in the next month, it might not survive long 
enough to reach its potential. 
Just as you would certainly pay your heating bill before putting money in a 
401(k), companies, too, must make sure they have enough cash to satisfy 
short-term obligations. 
How do you determine whether a company can handle its short-term bills? 
Analyzing working capital is one of fundamental analysts’ favorite tools to 
access a company’s immediate financial situation. Working capital tells you 
whether a company can access cash needed to pay its most pressing bills 
over the coming year. It’s a measure of short-term liquidity. 
Working capital will be discussed more in Chapter 8, along with the other 
financial ratios. But it’s important enough to start thinking about along with 
the balance sheet. The formula for working capital is: 
Working capital = Current assets – current liabilities 

103
 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
 
If a company has positive working capital and more current assets than cur-
rent liabilities, that gives a fundamental analyst a bit of comfort. However, if 
current assets are less than current liabilities — that means if a company’s 
business hits a snag — it may be forced to extreme measures to meet its bills, 
including selling off manufacturing plans or equipment in a fire sale. 
Analyzing here and now: The current ratio
Closely related to working capital, and perhaps of even more value in fun-
damental analysis, is a concept called the current ratio. The current ratio 
attempts to put a company’s current assets into perspective by comparing 
them with current liabilities. The formula is: 
Current ratio = Current assets / current liabilities
 
The higher a company’s current ratio, the better prepared it is to pay for lia-
bilities due within the year. Companies with high current ratios have a greater 
safety cushion in case business drops off. 
As a very general rule of thumb, fundamental analysts like to see at least a 
current ratio of 1, or even 1.5. The typical company in the Standard & Poor’s 
500 index had a current ratio of even more than that, 1.72 as of 2008. 
But because different businesses require different levels of short-term liquid-
ity, you should always compare a company’s current ratio to its industry. You 
can see what the typical current ratios for several industry sectors are by 
checking out www.reuters.com.
The Danger of Dilution
Just as it’s possible for a company to borrow too much, it’s also possible 
for it to sell too much of itself to shareholders. Remember, shares of stock 
are like slices of a pizza. If you have a large pizza that’s cut into eight slices, 
everyone gets a decent amount of food. However, if you cut that same pizza 
into 16 slivers, then you’re likely to start hearing complaints. 
When companies issue too many shares, they are in effect slicing their profits 
into smaller and smaller slices. This process of bringing in more investors is 
known as dilution. And since dilution can seriously water down the value of 
your investment, it’s something worth being aware of as a fundamental analyst.

You want to keep a close eye on company’s number of shares outstanding. This 
number tells you how much of a company’s profit you, as a shareholder, are 
entitled to by owning a share of stock. Most companies disclose their number 
of shares outstanding on the balance sheet. The more shares outstanding, the 
smaller the slice of profits you’re entitled to. 
How stock can be watered down
Dilution occurs when a company’s number of shares outstanding increases. 
A company may increase its number of shares outstanding for a number of 
reasons, including to: 
 
✓ Acquire another company using its stock. When a company’s stock 
price is high, relative to competitors’, it may use its shares as a currency 
for acquisitions. A company may issue new shares and use them to buy 
another firm. Stock deals can be popular with companies, since they 
don’t consume precious cash, and investors like them because they may 
be tax-free events. 
 
✓ Pay stock options to employees. Hoping to make the workforce feel like 
and act like owners, some companies may issue shares to employees 
and executives. Stock options allow employees to buy shares of stock at 
discounted prices, as long as the company’s stock rises. 
 
✓ Reduce leverage. Companies that have borrowed too much in the past 
and have a life-threatening brush with bankruptcy, may try to clean up 
their balance sheet by issuing stock and paying down debt. 
Paying for peanut butter with jelly
Many mergers have bad endings. But in what 
may be one of the most logical mergers since 
peanut butter and jelly first came together to 
create PB&J, was the J.M. Smucker acquisition 
of Jif peanut butter from Procter & Gamble in 
June 2002. Since it paid for the roughly $800 mil-
lion deal using stock, J.M. Smucker’s number of 
shares outstanding roughly doubled to nearly 50 
million shares. Was the deal successful, even 
though it cut the company’s profits into twice 
as many slices? After the deal was done, J.M. 
Smucker’s profits more than doubled in the year 
after the deal. 

105
 Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
Knowing how stock options 
can contribute to dilution
When companies dole out stock options to employees, that value of your 
stock can be seriously threatened. Stock options, a form of compensation 
for employees, are tied to the company’s stock price. If the company’s stock 
rises, employees may cash in the options in exchange for company stock, forc-
ing the company to sell additional shares to meet the demand for new shares. 
Dot-com companies handed out stock options so freely in the late 1990s that 
investors faced seeing the value of their shares shrivel up by 24%, according 
to a story in USA TODAY. The risk of dilution is why fundamental analysts 
should pay close attention to a company’s diluted earnings per share, which 
accounts for the potential dilution, as explained in Chapter 6.
Some companies periodically attempt to reduce the danger of dilution 
and make their shares more valuable by buying back shares. In a buyback, 
companies use their cash to take shares off the market. Stock buybacks, 
in theory, make each share more valuable because a company’s profits are 
sliced into fewer pieces. Some companies may buy back stock even if they 
haven’t issued options, if they think the shares are cheap. 
 
Stocks will often rally after a company announces a stock buyback. But funda-
mental analysts know better than to fall for this trap. For one thing, companies 
might buy back stock with borrowed money, which increases their interest 
costs and risk. Many companies also say they will buy back stock and never 
actually do. Other firms end up issuing more new shares than they bought 
back, all but erasing any benefit of the buyback.

Tracking Cash with the 
Statement of Cash Flow
In This Chapter

▶ Understanding how the statement of cash flows can give you a picture of a company’s 
finances

“S
how me the money!” Those words screamed out by Cuba Gooding’s 
character, a fictitious Arizona Cardinals wide receiver in the 1996 
comedy “Jerry Maguire,” captured one football player’s desire for cold hard 
cash. And that same line could just as easily apply to fundamental analysis 
and the statement of cash flows. 
Accounting rules can become so convoluted it’s hard to just see how much 
cash a company is bringing in. You might read through a company’s income 
statement and balance sheet and feel as if you have a pretty decent under-
standing of how the company is doing and what it owns. But revenue and 
profit are just numbers on a financial statement. It’s cash that really matters. 
It’s cash that pays the bills. 
The statement of cash flows, or cash-flow statement, is all about showing you 
the money. The statement meticulously tracks the flow of cold hard cash in and 
out of a company. There’s nothing more reassuring than knowing a company 
is bringing in cash. 
Fundamental analysts relish in the brutal honesty of the cash-flow statement. 
And while the statement has its limitations, in this chapter you’ll find how 
tracking the cash flowing in and out of a company can take your analysis 
skills to the next level. 

108
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Looking at the Cash-Flow Statement 
As a Fundamental Analyst
To understand why a company’s cash flow can be more revealing about a 
company’s performance, consider this simple example. Imagine your daugh-
ter has borrowed $10 from you to start a lemonade stand. The only stipula-
tion for the loan is that she reports back to you on how the business is going. 
Excited about being an entrepreneur, your daughter quickly spends the $10 
you lent her to get up and running. She buys lemons, sugar, cups, and stirring 
spoons. It’s a hot summer day, so it looks like a winning business idea. 
At the end of the day, you ask your daughter how she did. Hardly able to 
contain her smile, she beams that business was great and she completely 
sold out of lemonade. She estimates she sold 50 cups of lemonade at 50 cents 
a cup. You do the math quickly and determine her profit was $15. Constructing 
an income statement in your head, as explored in Chapter 5, you calculate she 
brought in revenue of $25 (50 cups of lemonade at 50 cents) and spent $10 to 
make the product. That’s a net income of $15. 
But when you extend your hand to ask for your $10 back, thinking you’d let 
her keep the $5 profit, she reports that she doesn’t have any cash at all. It 
turns out that she accepted IOUs for all the lemonade she sold. Suddenly the 
business isn’t necessarily looking so good, since there’s no cash flow.
This example is a gross simplification. But it gets to the point of why cash 
flow is critical to analysis. 
 
Accounting rules, even if properly followed, may give the impression a 
company is doing better than it really is. Profit, as measured by rules made 
by accountants, are subject to dozens of estimates, approximations and 
hunches. But cash is cash. You either have it or you don’t. 
Getting into the flow with cash flow
You might be wondering why you need to even bother with the statement of 
cash flows. After all, the income statement, explored in Chapter 5, tells you how
profitable the company is. And the balance sheet, discussed in Chapter 6, tells 
you how solid a company’s financial resources are. 
The statement of cash flows, though, deserves a spot in your fundamental 
analysis routine. The statement can provide valuable information when 
evaluating a company because it:

109
 Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
 
✓ Cuts through the optics of accounting. As you learned in Chapter 5, 
measuring a company’s profit is a pretty convoluted process. There are 
even more machinations going on behind the scenes, as accountants 
classify expenses and revenue. In contrast, cash is cash. You either make 
cash profits or you don’t.
 
✓ Links the different financial statements together. The income state-
ment and balance sheet are somewhat independent of each other, since 
they’re measuring different aspects of a business. The statement of cash 
flows, though, draws upon information from both the income statement 
and balance sheet to give you one, complete view of the company. 
 
✓ Highlights cash generated from actually doing business. The statement 
of cash flows makes it very clear how much of the cash coming into a 
business is the result of the company actually selling its products and 
services. It’s a helpful way to look past some one-time gains a company 
might receive, say, by selling assets.
 
Accounting standards were tightened in the early 2000s following the implo-
sion of Enron. Even so, the income statement is to be regarded with some 
healthy skepticism. The statement of cash flows can let you intelligently look 
for potential red flags in a company’s accounting, which is one of the hall-
marks of fundamental analysis. 
Consider the example of a company that offers customers, who agree to buy 
products or services now, a very lenient repayment schedule. Doing so would 
allow the company to book revenue now, boosting net income. The trouble, 
though, is that the company is essentially stealing net income from a future 
period. When companies do this, it’s referred to as channel stuffing, because 
the company is pushing product into the hands of customers prematurely to 
book sales now. The statement of cash flows, however, makes channel stuff-
ing easy to spot, since the company didn’t receive cash. 
Breaking the cash-flow statement
into its key parts
The way the statement of cash flows is organized tells you a great deal about a 
company. The statement is divided into three main sections. Cash coming into 
or going out of a company is placed into one of three categories, including: 
 
✓ Cash flows from operating activities. Here, investors can get a good 
idea of how much cash a company brings in, or uses, during its normal 
course of business. It counts cash coming in from customers as well as 
cash used to pay suppliers for materials, to the government for taxes, 
and to pay workers’ salaries. 

110
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Cash flows from investing activities. Companies keep careful track of 
money they’ve spent upgrading, or investing in, themselves. This section, 
for instance, counts the cash consumed buying new assets such as 
equipment or facilities. 
 
✓ Cash flows from financing activities. While companies are generally 
hoping to become self-sufficient and support their operations with the 
cash they generate from their business, sometimes they need cash 
injections. This section of the balance sheet tallies up how much cash 
is plowed into a company by lenders and investors. And on the flip side, 
this section accounts for cash used to pay cash dividends to investors 
or to pay down debts. 
 
Unfortunately, many companies aren’t as forthright with their statements of 
cash flows as they are with the balance sheet and income statement. When 
companies report their earnings using earnings press releases, a vast major-
ity do not provide a statement of cash flows. You can read more about what’s 
contained in the earnings press release in Chapter 4. You may need to wait 
for weeks after a company reports its earnings before getting the statement of 
cash flows. Companies are required to include the statement in their 10-Q or 
10-K filings. 
A few companies including Amazon.com, though, have started providing a 
statement of cash flows with their earnings press release. That’s a positive 
trend for fundamental analysts that other companies will hopefully follow.
Examining a company’s cash 
flow from operations
Typically, the first section of a company’s statement of cash flows deals with 
measuring how much cash a company brings in during its normal course of 
business. This key section, the first in the cash-flow statement, measures 
cash from operations, or formally called cash provided by / (used in) operating 
activities. The section tells you how much cash the company generated, or 
used, in the course of doing business. Table 7-2 shows you how much Kraft 
Foods generated in cash from its operations. 
 
Reading the statement of cash flows can get complicated because there are 
many lines in the statement. Adding to the confusion is the fact some of the 
lines are positive and some are negative. Don’t stress. Just remember that the 
statement of cash flows is really just converting a company’s net income into 
a number that represents a company’s cash flow.  Secondly, just remember 
when a number in the cash-flow statement is positive, that means the activity 
brought cash into the company. Similarly, when the number is negative, the 
item consumed cash. If you’re more of a visual person, Table 7-1 shows you 
how to think of these adjustments.

A few of those adjustments made to net income to arrive at a company’s cash 
from operations are described in the following sections.
Depreciation and amortization 
Usually, the biggest adjustment to net income to convert it into cash from 
operations is depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is an expense 
companies are required to include on their income statement, that doesn’t 
actually cost a company cash. Depreciation tallies the expense of the wear 
and tear on its equipment. Amortization, on the other hand, is the erosion of 
value of intangible assets, like patents or trademarks. 
 
Depreciation can be a somewhat difficult item for investors to understand. Think 
of it this way. Every year, the value of your car falls due to age, and wear and 
tear. It’s a real expense, since it is technically costing you money. But when 
your car depreciates, you don’t get a bill for it. You don’t have to write a check, 
and it doesn’t cost you cash immediately. As a result, depreciation is added 
back to net income when measuring a company’s cash flow from operations. 
Tax adjustments
Companies keep two sets of books. There’s one set for investors, which mea-
sures earnings according to the accounting rules. Then there’s a set required 
by the Internal Revenue Service for taxes. The different sets of books have 
different rules. As a result, a company may pay taxes to the IRS before the 
tax expense is recorded in the books monitored by accountants. Confused 
yet? Don’t worry. Just know that when a company actually writes a check and 
pays taxes, which aren’t recorded on the income statement, it must subtract 
the amount from net income. It’s subtracted since paying the taxes ate up 
some of the company’s cash. 
Gains on divestitures 
When a company sells a unit, it may add the profit on the sale to its net 
income. But remember, that profit didn’t result from the company selling 
products or services. Since the sale didn’t generate sales from operations, 
the amount is subtracted from net income.

112
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Asset impairments or losses on sales of discontinued operations
Believe it or not, companies sometimes make poor business decisions. They 
might try a new business concept, which flops spectacularly, or realize an 
asset they bought has lost its value. When companies are hit with these 
charges, accountants consider them to be costs and require the companies 
to take a hit to the income statement. However, savvy fundamental analysts 
know many of these flops don’t actually cost companies cash. And that’s why 
many of these charges are added back to net income to arrive at cash from 
operations. 
Accounts receivable
If you’re worried about a company claiming it’s doing better than it really is, this 
section of the cash flow statement is critical. As you discovered in Chapter 6, a 
company’s accounts receivable is a tally of how much its customers owe for 
products they’ve bought. If you see accounts receivable soar, that means 
customers are mostly buying on credit instead of paying cash. The increase 
in accounts receivable eats into a company’s cash because the company is 
essentially giving customers a credit card. 
 
If you’re worried a company might be stuffing the channel, pay close attention 
to the change in accounts receivable. A big jump in accounts receivable com-
pared to the increase of a companies’ revenue can be a tip-off. 
Accounts payable
When you buy something using a credit card, you get the asset without using 
cash. It’s the same concept with companies, who may buy supplies or mate-
rials on credit. They’re able to get their hands on the things they need to 
conduct business, without using cash. When a company’s accounts payable 
increases, it’s considered a boost to cash and added to net income. 
 
If you notice accounts payable is rising relative to a company’s cost of goods 
sold (discussed in Chapter 6), watch out. It might mean the company isn’t 
paying its bills on time, which may inflate its cash.
Inventories
If you’ve ever read about just-in-time manufacturing, you understand why 
companies go to great lengths to keep inventories low. Buying piles of mate-
rials needed for business consumes precious cash. So by keeping inventory 
levels down, companies can hang onto cash. You’ll see this immediately on 
the statement of cash flow. If inventories rise, the increase is subtracted from 
net income to measure a company’s cash from operations. Likewise, if a com-
pany uses up inventory, it’s a boost to its cash levels. 

113
 Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities
Here’s the end-all-be-all when it comes to measuring a company’s cash flow 
from its operations. After making all the painstaking adjustments to net 
income, to add back items that didn’t use cash and subtract those that did, 
you get a company’s cash from operations or net cash (used in) / provided by 
operating activities (see Table 7-2).
 
When net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities is positive, that 
means the company generated cash from its normal line of business. If the 
number is negative, that means the company burned cash. Some companies 
will put the negative number in parentheses while others make the number 
red in the financial statements.

Considering a company’s
cash from investments
When you buy a company’s stock, you want to make sure it’s making adequate 
investments in itself to keep things in working order. That’s where the section 
of the cash-flow statement, called the cash from investing or cash provided by / 
(used in) investing activities comes in. 

114
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
This part of the cash-flow statement lets you see how much cash the com-
pany is using to keep its factories humming or stores looking presentable. 
Generally, investments companies make in themselves can consume large 
amounts of cash for things including: 
 
✓ Updating stores to remain relevant. A retailer, for instance, may need to 
periodically remodel stores to keep them interesting to shoppers. 
 
✓ Enhancing capacity. A manufacturer that’s running full tilt may need to 
add warehouse space to handle increased demand. 
 
✓ Upgrading equipment. A hospital may be able to improve patient sat-
isfaction and reduce wait times by buying a state-of-the-art device that 
works faster or is more effective. 
 
✓ Acquisitions. Companies might decide it’s cheaper to buy a rival that’s 
already in an area of business, instead of trying to launch its own business. 
 
✓ Divestitures. When companies sell off a unit, they typically receive 
cash. That cash received isn’t from operations. It’s from investing; at 
least that’s what the accountants say. Even if a company technically lost 
money on a unit that’s sold off, if it gets at least some cash, that’s still 
considered a positive cash flow. 
 
For simplicity, companies will often lump all their investments in improving, 
enhancing or updating their facilities into a single item on the cash-flow state-
ment called capital expenditures, or cap ex for short. If you’re interested in dig-
ging more deeply into what capital expenditures a company made, the details 
will be provided in the footnotes in the 10-K. 
Below in Table 7-3 you can take a look at the investments Kraft Foods made 
to its business in 2007. Notice the huge drain of cash from acquisitions. Kraft 
Foods bought the global biscuit business of Groupe Danone for $7.6 billion on 
November 30, 2007.

 Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Getting into a company’s cash 
from financing activities
Companies are often like politicians: They seem to be constantly raising 
money. Instead of trying to line up financing for their campaigns, though, 
companies need funding to keep themselves going. 
A classic example would be a young retail company. The company may not 
have enough cash to buy all the shirts, pants, and shoes it needs to put into 
its store. The retailer, then, might borrow money to buy the merchandise, 
and plan to pay it back after the goods are sold. The money borrowed is con-
sidered a positive cash flow from financing activities.
A company’s financing activities may bring in or use up cash in a variety of 
primary ways. Generally, cash is brought in by borrowing money or selling 
stock to investors. All this is summarized right in the cash from financing 
activities section of the statement of cash flows. Table 7-4 shows an example 
using Kraft. The biggest uses or generators of cash from financing activities 
include: 
 
✓ Increasing or decreasing the company’s debt load: As you discovered 
while reading about the balance sheet in Chapter 6, companies can finance 
themselves by using their profits, by borrowing or by selling stock to 
shareholders. Each of these forms has its advantages and disadvantages. 
 
 Here, in this section of the statement of cash flows, you can see whether 
or not a company is generating cash by borrowing or using cash by 
paying back debt. If a company decides it has borrowed too much, for 
instance, it may choose to use cash to pay down its debt.
 
 Kraft’s cash-flow statement, in Table 7-3, distinguishes between its short-
term debt and long-term debt. Short-term debt is most pressing, as it’s due 
within a year, while long-term debt matures in more than a year. Kraft in 
2007 issued more than $12 billion in new long- and short-term debt. 
 
✓ Buying back the company’s stock: From time to time, companies might 
choose to buy their own stock. When they do this, they use cash to take 
shares out of the hands of the public by buying them. This reduces the 
number of slices a company’s profits are cut into, potentially making 
each share more valuable. 
 
✓ Paying out dividends to shareholders: Some companies, usually those in 
mature businesses with stable cash flow, might generate more cash than 
they need to run themselves. These companies generally will return cash 
to shareholders by issuing dividends. These payments consume cash. 

116
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities: After accounting 
for all the cash brought in by borrowing and issuing stock, and cash used 
by extinguishing debt, buying back stock and paying dividends, you get 
the final result. Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities, or 
cash from financing activities, shows you whether the company was a net 
gainer or user of cash after considering all money-raising events.

How Investors May Be Fooled by 
Earnings, But Not Cash Flow
Investors often pay very close attention to a company’s revenue and prof-
its. Too much attention, probably. Every quarter, during so-called earnings 
season, investors look at what companies said they earned, compare those 
results with their expectations, and either buy or sell the stock. 
The fact investors pay such close attention to earnings is not missed by com-
panies’ managements. There’s a huge incentive for companies to never miss 
earnings expectations, or how much investors think the company will make, 
since doing so can cause a stock price to fall precipitously. Adding to the 
incentive to not disappoint: Many executives’ pay packages are closely tied 
to the companies’ stock price. If earnings disappoint and the stock falls, there 
goes the Hawaiian vacation for the CEO.

117
 Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Meanwhile, due to the flexibility of accounting rules, there are ways for man-
agement to manage earnings. The term “manage earnings” describes a whole 
host of things management can do to even out net income and earnings each 
quarter, and reduce the chances of disappointing investors. 
 
Management’s ability to manage earnings largely stems from the way the 
income statement is constructed. Generally, financial transactions use accrual 
accounting. Accrual accounting records revenue when sales are made, and 
costs when they’re incurred. That is very different from cash accounting, 
which records revenue when sales are collected and costs are paid. 
When a company’s profit is widely different from the cash it’s bringing in, 
that’s something of great importance to a fundamental analyst. I’ll show you 
how fundamental analysts watch for this potentially disturbing trend later in 
this chapter. 
 
Companies can also inflate the cash. The most common way would be to 
avoid paying their bills. Eventually, though, this tactics will catch up with a 
company when its suppliers or other creditors threaten legal action or stop 
shipping supplies and raw materials.
A quick-and-dirty way to monitor 
a company’s cash flow
You can spend hours analyzing the statement of cash flows. And later in the 
book, I’ll share with you some financial ratios and other things you can do to 
analyze the cash coming into and out of a company. 
 
But here, I want to share with you one of the fastest and most effective funda-
mental ways to analyze a statement of cash flows. It’s such a simple form of 
analysis, it’s not a bad idea to do with any company you invest in or have an 
interest in. 
If you recall, profits certainly are important. But cash flow is king. You could 
have a company making giant profits according to the income statement, but 
without bringing in much cash. Remember the lemonade stand discussed 
earlier in the chapter? The answer: Compare a company’s net income with 
its cash from operations. It’s very simple fundamental analysis to do. All you 
need is the company’s statement of cash flows. 
If a company is generating as much cash as it’s reporting in net income, that 
can be a good indication it has high-quality earnings. High-quality earnings are 
those that are backed up by cold hard cash, not just smoke and mirrors made 
possible from accounting rules. 

118
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
If this analysis seems confusing, keep reading. Once you follow the steps 
below and practice a few times, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to com-
pare a company’s net income with its cash from operations.
Don’t assume the tightening of accounting standards in the early 2000s 
stomped out low-quality earnings. Certainly, many companies cleaned up 
their accounting in 2002 and 2003 in the wake of Enron. Even so, the number 
of firms with lower-quality earnings have been creeping up again. Table 7-5 
shows the number of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that reported 
net income that was greater than their cash from operations.

tions in 2007 and net income in 2007
Below I’ll show you how to perform this form of cash-based earnings-quality 
analysis on Kraft, with the following steps: 
 
1. Look up the company’s net income. As you learned in Chapter 5, a 
company’s net income is available on the income statement. But you 
can also take it from the very top line of the statement of cash flows. For 
Kraft, net income was $2.6 billion in 2007. 
 
2. Look up the company’s cash flow from operations. Cash flow from 
operations is how much the company generated from its business. It’s 
kind of like the cash version of net income. If you recall, Kraft’s cash flow 
from operations was $3.6 billion in 2007. 
 
3. Compare net income with cash flow from operations. You’ll want to 
see cash flow from operations be at least equal to, if not larger, than net 
income. That tells you that the company is generating as much cash as 
it purports to generate in earnings. Table 7-6 summarizes what you need 
to know. 
 
 For instance, at Kraft, the company brought in $1 billion in cash above 
its reported earnings in 2007, giving you decent confidence the company 
has high-quality earnings.

Table 7-6 
Sizing Up a Company’s Earnings Quality
If cash from operations is . . .
It means the company . . .
Greater than net income
Generates more cash than it reports to share-
holders as earnings. It has high-quality earnings.
Less than net income
Generates less cash than it reports to share-
holders as earnings. It has low-quality earnings
 
Just because a company’s net income is less than its cash flow from opera-
tions doesn’t mean it’s committing fraud. It just means a substantial portion 
of the profit it’s reporting isn’t materializing in cash. This might happen, for 
instance, when a fast-growing company sells goods so rapidly it must book 
profits before it can collect cash from customers. Still, when you see cash flow 
from operations that’s less than net income, it’s a reason to be concerned and 
dig further to determine the cause. 
Understanding the Fundamentals 
of Free Cash Flow 
Face it. Earnings may impress investors, but cash flow pays the bills. Even 
if a company posts remarkable revenue growth, if it can’t get money into 
the doors fast enough to pay its own bills, it’s toast. That’s where free cash 
flow comes in. Free cash flow tells you how much cash a company generates 
(or uses) during the normal course of doing business, including the cost of 
upgrading and maintaining its equipment and facilities. 
That’s a mouthful, I know. Just remember free cash flow is a relatively easy 
fundamental analysis tool that can tell you a great deal about a company’s 
generation or burning up of cash. Watching a company’s free cash flow is 
kind of like watching the fuel gauge when you’re driving. Just as you want to 
know when fuel is running low, you want to know when cash is drying up. 
 
There are many ways to analyze cash flow. Some analysts attempt to determine 
how much cash a company is throwing off by studying earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. EBITDA adjusts a company’s 
net income by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. 
EBITDA can be another way to study how profitable a company is and offers 
a rough idea of how able a company is to pay its interest costs. But don’t 
make the mistake of assuming EBITDA is a company’s cash flow, even though 
many analysts do. EBITDA doesn’t factor in the cash eaten up by inventory, 
extending credit to customers or used to buy new equipment. Trust me on 
this one. When you want to know how much cash a company is using up, rely 
on free cash flow as described in the section below. 

120
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Calculating free cash flow
The term free cash flow might sound pretty complex and academic. But you 
might be surprised at how easy it is to calculate a company’s free cash flow. 
Everything you need to measure free cash flow is available on the statement 
of cash flows. 
In fact, if you’ve followed the calculation of a company’s cash from opera-
tions in that part of the chapter above, you’re more than halfway to arriving 
at free cash flow. The formula for free cash flow looks like this: 
Free cash flow = Cash from operations – Capital expenditures
Again picking on Kraft as an example, you can calculate the company’s free 
cash flow by subtracting its capital expenditures of $1.241 billion from its cash 
from operations of $3.571 billion, to arrive at free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Kraft 
is generating cash. But that’s not always the case. In the next section of this 
chapter, I’ll show you how to analyze a company that’s burning through cash 
and find out how long it’ll take before it burns through its entire wad. 
 
Some beginning fundamental analysts are uncertain why capital expenditures 
should be subtracted from cash flow from operations to arrive at free cash 
flow. The idea is a company cannot continue very long without reinvesting 
and upgrading its infrastructure. The example of a manufacturing company is 
especially helpful. After a certain period of time, machinery that’s left with no 
maintenance will break down or not work properly. Putting money into keep-
ing up equipment is critical if a company is to remain in business.
Enron’s lack of earnings quality
The implosion of Enron left many investors 
flabbergasted. But for fundamental analysts 
who know how to measure a company’s earn-
ings quality, there were some huge red flags to 
warn them. When Enron’s stock price was still 
relatively lofty at $63 a share, the company’s 
financial statements showed shockingly low 
earnings quality. When the company published 
its earnings press release, it wowed inves-
tors with a better-than-expected profit of $425
million for the quarter. But fundamental analysts 
knew better. An examination of the company’s 
cash-flow statement showed Enron burned 
$464 million in cash during the same quarter it 
reported spectacular earnings. That was a huge 
warning signal, and a big reason how a funda-
mental analyst would have known to avoid this 
disastrous stock that ended up losing nearly its 
entire value. 

121
 Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Measuring a company’s cash-burn rate
One of the great reliefs of reality shows is that eventually, the contestants 
with no talent finally get the boot. Whether it’s the singer with the horrible 
voice in “American Idol” or the clumsy player in “Survivor,” eventually those 
that don’t belong are eliminated. 
The same brutal and harsh reality applies in the business world. Companies 
that run out of cash are often history (unless they’re able to get a bail-
out). And as a fundamental analyst, it’s important to understand how this 
Darwinism works. 
 
When a company relies on borrowed money, the death toll occurs when a com-
pany misses interest payments on its debt. At that point, lenders can take over 
the company and force it to restructure itself. But what if a company hasn’t 
borrowed? For these companies, the music stops when they run out of cash. 
And at this point, you have all the basic skills you need to measure when 
a company will run out of cash, or its cash burn. When you do a cash-burn 
analysis, you measure how long a company’s cash pile will last if it continues 
to consume cash at its current rate. 
Some of the best examples of cash burn occurred during the dot-com boom. 
Several Internet companies raised gobs of money during the boom. But after 
the Internet bubble burst, many were unable to either sell stock or borrow. 
That meant they only had the cash they’d saved to survive on. 
Since many Internet companies were losing money and burning cash at such 
a rapid pace, they stood to run out of cash before they could ever make 
a dime for investors. In April 2000, USA TODAY found that three of the 14 
largest online retailers would burn through their cash piles in less than 12 
months. All three ended up either filing for bankruptcy protection or being 
acquired by rivals for pennies a share, all but wiping out investors.
Fundamental analysis can help you steer clear of these situations. Here’s the 
formula you need: 
Year’s supply of cash = Cash and cash equivalents / free cash flow 
 
If the company burned cash, it will have a negative free cash flow. Convert it 
into a positive number before using the formula above. 
An example is Value America, an online retailer that was a darling on Wall 
Street during the Internet boom. During 1999, the company burned $109.9 
million in cash from operations. Value America spent an additional $16.3 

122
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
million for capital expenditures. Adding the two numbers together, Value 
America’s free cash flow was a negative $126.2 million. Meanwhile, the com-
pany ended 1999 with cash and cash equivalents of $52.1 million. 
So, using the formula: 
52.1 / 126.2 = 0.4
Think of yourself as a doctor telling a patient how many months they have to 
live. To convert the 0.4 into a time frame, multiply 0.4 by 12 to see how many 
months the cash will last. The result? Value America had just enough cash 
to survive just shy of five months. And guess what? The company filed for 
bankruptcy protection in 2000. Fundamental analysts pay close attention to 
companies’ cash-burn rates for this reason, since it’s critical for companies to 
generate enough cash to become sustainable.

T
he financial statements, by design, give off an aura of orderliness. All the 
items are neatly arranged in rows and columns, giving the impression 
that finding everything you need to know is just a matter of flipping to the 
correct page and reading the number. If only it was that easy.
While accountants do a great job of recording a company’s financials in a tidy 
way, extracting the information you need for fundamental analysis gets a little 
messy. Reading the financial statements from top to bottom only tells you so 
much. To really take your fundamental analysis to the next level, you’ll need 
to learn how to put items on financial statements into perspective. And that 
means taking a number from one financial statement and comparing it with 
another. Financial ratios are one of the best ways to do this. Ratios compare 
one financial measure with another to give you real insight into what the 
numbers mean. 
In this chapter, I’ll show you some of the most critical ratios of the financial 
statements and how to apply them. Because it’s such an important ratio, I 
describe the price-to-earnings ratio in the most depth. 

124
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Using Financial Ratios to Find Out What’s 
Really Going on at a Company
You might not realize it, but you’re probably already using ratios in your daily 
life. For instance, the fact you put 12 gallons of gasoline in your car doesn’t 
tell you anything about the vehicle’s efficiency. But if you look at how many 
miles you drove on those 12 gallons and examine miles per gallon, you can 
find out if your car is a gas-guzzler or not. Similarly, when remodeling your 
home, you may figure out which carpet or tile is the best buy by comparing 
the price per square foot, which is also a ratio. 
Financial ratios work the exact same way as these everyday ratios. By com-
paring a piece of data from one financial statement to another piece of data, 
often from another financial statement, you get fundamental insight into the 
company that neither number alone would provide. Financial ratios are help-
ful in fundamental analysis because they allow you to: 
 
✓ Compare several companies’ financials against each other. Financial 
ratios give you a relatively common basis in which to rank companies, 
usually in the same industry, against each other. 
 
✓ Draw conclusions from all the financial statements. By pulling num-
bers from the income statement and balance sheet, you can glean insights 
you’d never get by reading just one of the statements. 
 
✓ Get quick insights. With just a few division problems, you can get a 
pretty good idea at how skilled a management team is and how well the 
business is operated. 
 
Some ratios allow you to compare two numbers you might not think would 
have anything to do with each other. One of my favorite examples is one ratio 
that measures employee productivity. Just divide a company’s total revenue 
by its number of employees and you find out, on average, how much business 
each employee brings in. The higher the number, the more productive each 
worker is. You can then compare the company’s productivity to rivals in the 
same industry, as shown in Table 8-1.
ExxonMobil, for instance, reported total revenue of $477.4 billion in 2008. The 
oil company started 2008 with 107,100 employees. When you divide revenue 
by the number of employees, you find out that every employee, on average, 
generated $4.5 million in revenue. If you work at ExxonMobil, maybe it’s time 
to ask for a raise? 
 
When analyzing financial ratios, it’s most useful to compare a company with 
its competitors.  For instance, ExxonMobil and energy companies generate 
high revenue per employee since their businesses are so capital intensive. 
Capital-intensive businesses rely on machinery to generate a large portion of 
their revenue, which makes the employees look like productivity superheroes.

Which financial ratios you should 
know and how to use them
Financial ratios are kind of like vegetables. There are countless veggies, 
including some you may not have even heard of. And just to push this anal-
ogy even further, while some people love broccoli, others can’t even stand 
the sight of the stuff. The same goes with financial ratios. You could create an 
entire book just dedicated to financial ratios. Some fundamental analysts love 
some, like return on equity, while others find them to be misleading. I’ll give 
you my opinion on the ratios, but it’s up to you as a fundamental analyst to 
decide which ones are the best. 
 
There are hundreds of financial ratios because they’re just division problems, 
and there’s nothing to stop you from comparing just about anything on the 
financial statements with something else. The question, though, is whether or 
not the ratio is valuable. 
That’s why in this section, I’m going to step you through the greatest hits 
of financial ratios. These are the ratios you’re most likely to encounter, and 
those that are believed to have some value. 
Generally, financial ratios fall into one of five categories, including: 
 
✓ Profitability: These ratios allow you to put the profit, or loss, generated 
by a company into perspective. These ratios are typically called profit 
margins. But there are several kinds of profit margins, including gross, 
operating and net. These ratios are covered in detail in Chapter 5, so I 
won’t go through them again here. 

126
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Management effectiveness: Ever wonder if a CEO is doing a good or 
bad job? Many investors just look at the stock price to make that judg-
ment. But that’s somewhat unfair since the CEO can’t control the minds 
of investors. However, ratios like return on assets, return on equity and 
return on invested capital are affected by CEOs’ decisions. 
 
✓ Efficiency: When you invest or lend money to a company, you want 
to know your cash is being put to good use. And that’s the goal of the 
efficiency ratios, to indicate how wisely the company is managing its 
resources. 
 
✓ Financial condition: When you invest in a company, you want to know 
it has the resources it needs to endure. The current ratio, discussed in 
Chapter 6, introduced you to the idea of using ratios to check a com-
pany’s staying power. But there are more such tools at the fundamental 
analysts’ disposal. 
 
✓ Valuation: A stock’s per-share price, while the fixation of most investors, 
doesn’t tell you much about how expensive the stock is. It’s the stock’s 
valuation, or how much you’re paying for a company’s earnings, that 
matters. 
Using ratios to grade management
There’s something refreshing about the way the performance of athletes is 
measured. Runs, goals and baskets are all meticulously counted as part of 
keeping score. But in sports, individual’s performances are tracked even 
more closely, as everything from errors to misses and fumbles get tallied up. 
At the end of a game, there’s no doubt over how a player did. 
Fundamental analysis brings that same rigor to measuring companies’ lead-
ers, including the CEOs. CEOs, hoping to hang onto their jobs, are infamous 
for putting the best face possible on their companies’ results. But fundamen-
tal analysis lets you, the investor, look past the promises and spin to see 
how management actually did. Using Cisco Systems’ financials, I’ll step you 
through how to calculate the main ratios you’ll need to size up the manage-
ment. To save you time, I’ve pulled all the raw data you’ll need and put it all 
in Table 8-2.
 
All the lines you see in the table above come from the income statement 
or balance sheet. If any of these look unfamiliar, flip back to Chapter 5 and 
Chapter 6 to refresh your memory. 
Return on equity
For many investors, the key ratio to pay attention to is return on equity, or 
ROE. This measure tells you how much profit the company is generating from 
money entrusted to it from investors. The formula is: 
Return on equity = Net income / average shareholders’ equity

To measure Cisco Systems’ return on equity, you first need to calculate average 
shareholders’ equity. That’s shareholder equity from one year plus the previ-
ous year, divided by two. For Cisco, that’s $34,353 plus $31,480, divided by 2. 
Next, you divide the company’s net income ($8,052) by the average share-
holders’ equity ($32,917). The answer for Cisco is a very strong 24.5%. If you 
do the same analysis for other companies in the tech sector, you’d find an 
average ROE of about 20%. And to put this into perspective, companies in the 
S&P 500 generated an average ROE of 21% in the mid-2000s. 
 
Don’t assume that just because a company has a higher ROE than another, 
it’s a better company. A company’s ROE may be depressed because it has a 
large investment in assets. Those assets might give the company an edge over 
rivals in the long run. That’s why it’s best to compare one company’s ROE to 
another’s, in the same industry.

Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Return on invested capital
For savvy fundamental analysts, return on invested capital, or ROIC, is the 
ultimate gauge of a company’s profitability. It tells you how much money the 
company makes on all the money, including both debt and equity, that’s been 
entrusted to it. 
Calculating ROIC is very worthwhile, even though it takes a little math. To 
keep it simple, I’ve broken down the calculation into steps below. 
There are many variations on how to calculate ROIC; some are overly sim-
plistic and others are mind-numbingly complex. You’re essentially dividing 
a company’s cash income by its total debt and equity. Below, I give you the 
steps that will work for most fundamental analysis:
 
1. Calculate the company’s earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. 
This is a rough measure of the company’s cash profit, excluding the cost 
of paying interest expense and taxes. It’s a very rough estimate of how 
much profit the company has available to pay interest with. The formula 
looks like this: 
 
 (Revenue - cost of goods sold - SG&A - R&D - depreciation and 
amortization) 
 
 For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 ($39,540 – $14,056 – $10,387 – $5,153 – $499) = $9,445
 
2. Adjust EBIT for taxes. Multiply the answer from step 1 by (1 – tax rate). 
This adjusts EBIT for taxes.
 
 For Cisco, that’s:
 
 $9,445 * (1–0.375) = $5,903. That’s Cisco’s tax-adjusted EBIT.
 
3. Calculate the total capital possessed by the company for the most 
recent year. This measure tells you how much money, including debt 
and equity from shareholders, the company has at its disposal. If you 
need a refresher on the difference between debt and equity, review 
Chapter 6.
 
 (Total common equity + current portion of long-term debt + long-
term debt) 
 
 For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 ($34,353 + $500 + $6,393) = $41,246 for 2008
 
4. Calculate the total capital for the previous year. For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 ($31,480 + 0 + $6,408) = $37,888 for 2007

129
 Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
 
5. Take the average total capital. Add the two years together and divide 
by 2. 
 
 For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 $39,567 = ($41,246 + $37,888)/2
 
6. Calculate ROIC. Divide the answer from step 2 by the answer from step 5. 
 
 For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 $5,903/$39,567 = 0.149
 
7. Convert ROIC into a percentage. Multiply the answer from step 6 by 
100. For Cisco, that’s 0.149 * 100, or 14.9%.
For an ROIC, 14.9% is very strong. That means the company is generating a 
nearly 15% return on all the cash that’s entrusted to it. The average ROIC of 
S&P 500 companies was about 13 in the mid-2000s. But again, it’s best to com-
pare a company’s ROIC with other firms in the industry, and since the indus-
try average is 15, Cisco is right in line. 
 
When ROIC is lower than return on shareholders’ equity, that tells you part of
the company’s returns are the result of the use of borrowed money, or leverage. 
Borrowed money can boost a company’s returns when things are good, but 
sting when business slows. Meanwhile, during a credit crisis, if borrowing 
costs rise, a highly leveraged company will see its ROIC fall. 
Checking up on a company’s efficiency
When you invest in a company, you want to know it’s running a tight ship. 
You don’t want the company taking its time collecting money from customers 
or letting inventory sit in the warehouse. There are many ratios that can help 
you figure out how well a company is managing its affairs. 
Accounts receivable turnover
This ratio tells you how quickly a company is collecting its bills from custom-
ers. It’s helpful for many investors to convert this into the number of days it 
takes to collect the bills. Here’s how: 
 
1. Calculate the average accounts receivable. Add the first year’s 
accounts receivable to the second and divide by 2. For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 $3,905 = $3,821 + $3,989 / 2

130
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 
2. Divide the answer in step 1 by revenue. For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 0.099 = $3,905 / $39,540
 
3. Convert step 2 to days by multiplying by 365. For Cisco, that’s: 
 
 0.099 × 365 = 36
So for Cisco, the number above means it takes, on average, 36 days for the 
company to collect its bills from customers. You’ll want to compare this with 
the industry to see how it compares. 
 
It’s valuable to compare a company’s accounts receivable turnover and see if 
it’s getting larger over time. That can be a warning sign that the company is 
having trouble collecting from customers. 
Inventory turnover
Inventory turnover tells you how long its takes the company to clear out the 
goods sitting in the warehouse. The good news is calculating the formula 
works the same as accounts receivable turnover, except you substitute aver-
age inventories with average accounts receivable and cost of goods sold with 
revenue. 
The formula looks like this: 
Average inventory / cost of goods sold * 365
For Cisco, that’s: 
33.2 = Average inventory ($1,278.50) / cost of goods sold ($14,056) * 365
To get average inventory, add inventory from one year to the previous year, 
and divide by 2.
So, it takes Cisco 33.2 days to clear inventory from its warehouses. That’s 
pretty standard. You’ll want to be careful of companies if the days to clear 
inventory is rising at a rapid clip or stretches well above 40 days.
It takes longer to clear inventory in some industries than others. For 
instance, a shipbuilding company may hold inventory for a longer time 
before it’s sold. That’s why it’s important to track the company over time to 
see if the number of days to clear inventory is rising. 
Accounts payable turnover
With this measure, accounts payable turnover, you can find out how long 
a company is taking to pay its bills. You don’t want to invest in a deadbeat 

131
 Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
company that’s not paying its bills, since it might find itself getting cut off 
from suppliers. Here’s how to calculate accounts payable turnover, converted 
into days:
 
1. Calculate the average accounts payable. Add the first year’s accounts 
payable to the second year’s, and divide by 2. 
 
 For Cisco, that’s $827.5 = $869+$786 / 2
 
2. Calculate the increase, or decrease, in inventory. Subtract the previ-
ous year’s inventory by the first year’s to see if the company added or 
removed from its stockpiles. For Cisco, that’s: $1,235 – $1322 = –$87. 
That means Cisco drew down its inventory. 
 
3. Add the answer from step 2 to the company’s cost of goods sold. For 
Cisco, that’s $13,969 = -87 + $14,056
 
4. Divide the answer from step 1 by the answer of step 3. For Cisco, that’s 
0.059 = 827.5 / 13,969
 
5. Multiply the answer from step 4 by 365 to convert to days. For Cisco, 
that’s 21.6. 
So it looks like Cisco is a prompt payer of its bills. You should get worried if 
you see the number of days rising over time and heading considerably over 
35 days. 
 
A rapid accounts payable turnover ratio may indicate the company is comfort-
able with its short-term cash flows. If you see this slow down, it could be a 
sign the company is trying to bolster its short-term cash. 
Evaluating companies’ financial condition
No one wants to give money to a deadbeat. If your neighbor hits you up for 
money, you probably have no idea if you’ll ever get it back. But with a com-
pany, there are very concrete ratios that can indicate how able a company is 
to repay you. Some of those include the following. 
Debt to equity
The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most basic measures of a company’s 
debt load. It tells you, at a glance, how a company’s pile of debt compares 
with the amount of money it has raised from stock investors. The higher the 
number, the more loaded it is with debt relative to stock. The formula is: 
Current portion of long-term debt + long-term debt / total equity × 100
For Cisco, that’s 20.1 = ($500 + $6,393) / $34,353 × 100

132
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
So for every $20 that the company has borrowed, it has raised $100 from 
equity investors. That’s a very low level of debt, especially if you consider 
that during the mid-2000s, companies in the S&P 500 had borrowed $75 for 
every $100 raised from investors. Generally, you don’t want to see companies 
borrowing much more than $100 for every $100 raised from investors. 
Quick ratio
When you want to size up how well-equipped a company is to handle its 
short-term cash obligations, the current ratio does a great job. You can re-
read how to calculate the current ratio in Chapter 6. 
But some might think the current ratio is too lenient. After all, it includes the 
value of inventory. Some fundamental analysts think including inventory isn’t 
a great idea, since you can’t exactly sell off raw materials very easily to pay 
bills. That’s where the quick ratio comes in. It disregards inventory to help 
you really see how able a company is at meeting short-term obligations. The 
formula is: 
Cash and cash equivalents + investments + accounts receivable / current 
liabilities
For Cisco, that’s: 
2.2 = $5,191+ $21,044 + $3821 / $13,858
That means that the company has $2.20 in assets that are already cash or can 
be easily turned into cash to handle liabilities due in a year. That is a very 
strong position, given that in the mid-2000s, companies in the S&P 500 had 
$1.21 in very close-to-cash assets for every $1 in liabilities coming due in a 
year. You want to see this ratio be at least 1, and preferably higher. 
Interest coverage ratio
The interest coverage ratio helps you figure out how well a company is able 
to afford its interest payments. 
This ratio can be calculated in many ways. Generally, you compare the com-
pany’s profits before interest costs and taxes to its interest expense, to see 
how able it is to pay its bills. It’s similar to how you’re supposed to compare 
your monthly gross pay with your monthly mortgage bill to see if you can 
afford the house. Too bad more people didn’t do this ahead of the financial 
crisis, but I digress. 
Just divide EBIT by the company’s interest expense. For Cisco, that’s: 
29.6 = $9,445 / 319

133
 Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
Reflecting the fact it has very low debt, Cisco has a very high interest cover-
age ratio. It generates nearly $30 in available cash profits to pay for every $1 in 
interest due. Most companies, on average, only generated about $15 in avail-
able cash profits to pay their interest. The higher the ratio, the better. 
 
Some companies, including Cisco, list their interest expense as a footnote in 
their 10-K. After opening the 10-K, using the instructions in Chapter 4, just 
search for the words “interest expense” and you’ll turn up the amount. 
Getting a handle on a company’s valuation 
When you hear investors talk about whether or not a company is cheap, 
often times they’re referring to a stock’s valuation. There are dozens of valu-
ation ratios, sometimes called multiples, to help you figure out how pricey a 
stock is. 
More often than not, the ratio used to measure a stock’s valuation is the 
price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E. The P-E is so important, I dedicate the next 
section to it. But for now, below are some descriptions of valuation ratios 
other than the P-E.
Price-to-book ratio
Many serious fundamental analysts pay closest attention to the price-to-book 
ratio. This ratio compares a company’s stock price to its book value, or value 
of everything the company owes, free and clear of debt. The formula for 
price-to-book is: 
Price-to-book = Company’s stock price / (shareholders’ equity / number 
of shares outstanding)
To practice, let’s take the day that Cisco reported its fiscal 2008 results on 
July 28, 2008. The stock price closed at $21.98. So its price-to-book ratio was: 
3.94 = $21.98 / ($34,353 / 6,163) 
The higher the price-to-book ratio, the more investors are paying up for the 
companies’ assets. The ratio will rise and fall as investors get more confident 
or less confident about the company and the stock market. 
 
How do you know if a stock’s price-to-book is high or low? One easy way is 
comparing it with the price-to-book of stocks inside exchange-traded funds, 
or ETFs, which are baskets of stocks. iShares, for instance, has an ETF that 
tracks stocks with high, average and low price-to-book ratios. Stocks with low 
price-to-book ratios are called value stocks. And stocks with high price-to-book 
ratios are called growth stocks. There’s no set definition of what defines a high 
or low book value, and it changes over time.

134
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
You can look up the average price-to-book ratios of large value stocks by 
entering IVV in the Ticker or Keyword blank at ishares.com. And you can see 
the average price-to-book ratios of large growth stocks by entering IVW. In 
early 2000, stocks in the S&P 500 had an average price-to-book of 3.1, while 
stocks with high price-to-book ratios averaged 3.66. I’ll give you more point-
ers on how to do this in Chapter 10.
Dividend yield
The dividend yield tells you how much the company is paying out in cash 
dividends relative to the stock price. You can calculate a dividend yield by 
dividing the amount of dividends a company pays out in a year by its stock 
price, and then multiplying by 100. So if a company pays $1 a year in divi-
dends and has a stock price of $25 a share, it has a dividend yield of 4%. To 
put this dividend into perspective, remember large companies have paid an 
average dividend yield of 3.8% since December 1936, says S&P. 
 
In theory, the dividend yield is the cash payout you receive by holding onto a 
stock. Some investors are tempted to automatically buy stocks that pay large 
dividend yields. However, dividends can be cut with little notice. In fact, com-
panies with large dividend yields are often those under the most distress. 
Earnings yield
A company’s earnings yield tells you how much, as a percentage of a stock’s 
price, the company is generating in profit. The earnings yield gives you a way 
to compare a company’s profit generation with other investments. To get a 
stock’s earnings yield, divide a stock’s earnings per share over the past 12 
months by its stock price. When a stock’s earnings yield is well below the 
market or that of rivals, it might be a sign the stock is overvalued. I’ll touch 
on this topic more in Chapter 10. 
 
The earnings yield is especially valuable when trying to determine if the stock 
market is overvalued. You can get this by dividing the earnings generated by 
the S&P 500 over the previous 12 months by the value of the S&P 500. When 
the yield gets lower than what you can get by putting your money in safer 
securities, like government bonds, it’s a warning you’re not getting paid for the 
risk you’re assuming. 
Getting Familiar With the 
Price-To-Earnings Ratio
The granddaddy of all financial ratios must be the P-E. The P-E is an appeal-
ing ratio, because it’s relatively easy to understand and can be used to com-
pare the valuations of different companies with each other and to the market 
at large. 

135
 Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
How to Calculate the P-E
When people refer to a stock’s P-E, it’s almost as if it’s some sort of number 
that’s etched in stone. Nothing could be further from the truth. A stock’s 
P-E changes every day along with a stock’s price. The formula is deceptively 
simple: 
P–E = Stock price / earnings per share
The numerator, the stock price, everyone can pretty much agree on. That’s 
set by the stock market and can be looked up. However, the denominator can 
be many different things and is subject to some interpretation. And that’s 
why there can be several variants of the P-E including the: 
 
✓ Trailing P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by its net earnings per 
share over the past 12 months’ earnings, or trailing earnings, you get 
the trailing P-E. This is considered one of the most conservative ways 
to measure P-E, since it’s based on earnings that have actually been 
reported.
 
 Net earnings per share can be measured a few ways, as discussed in 
Chapter 5.  
 
✓ Current P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by what it’s expected 
to earn in the current fiscal year, that’s the current P-E. Typically, the 
forward P-E will be based on several quarters of earnings reported by 
the company, plus a few quarters of estimated earnings. This is a fairly 
common way to measure a stock’s P-E.
 
✓ Forward P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by what it’s expected to 
earn in the next fiscal year, you’re taking somewhat of a leap. Estimates 
can be pretty unreliable going out this far, meaning that investors should 
take the forward P-E with a handful of salt. 
 
✓ Operating P-E: When you divide by a company’s operating income, you 
are trying to get an idea of what investors are paying for the company’s 
profit, excluding unusual and one-time charges. Current and forward P-E 
ratios are usually based on operating income, since these rely on esti-
mates. There is usually no way to accurately forecast one-time charges.
 
✓ As reported P-E: When you divide by a company’s net income, which 
includes all charges and one-time items. Reported P-E tends to be higher 
than operating P-Es during times of economic stress, since companies 
take many charges for restructuring. 
 
If someone is trying to sell you on a stock by pointing to its “low P-E,” be care-
ful you know how it’s being calculated. Future P-Es are infamously too low, 
making a stock look cheap, since the denominator may be based on an overly 
optimistic estimate.  

136
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
What a P-E tells you about a stock
One of the beauties of the P-E ratio is its simplicity. With just one number, 
you can find out how much investors, on average, are willing to pay for a 
claim to $1 of a company’s earnings. 
The higher the P-E, the loftier the company’s valuation is. When you see a P-E 
get high relative to peers in the same industry, you might begin to wonder 
if investors are overvaluing the stock. Similarly, if you see a stock’s P-E fall 
below that of its peers, you might wonder if the company can make changes 
to its operations to win a higher multiple. 
 
The long-term average P-E of stocks is about 15. If a stock rises above that, you 
need to be aware that you might be paying up for the stock. Be sure you’re get-
ting something for that extra price, such as growth. The PEG ratio, discussed 
below, explores how to adjust P-E to factor in a company’s growth. 
Putting the P-E into perspective
Now that you know how to measure a stock’s P-E, the question is, what does it 
mean? The first thing you should do is compare a stock’s P-E against the P-E of 
other companies in the same industry. You can calculate the P-Es of industries 
yourself, or if you want to save yourself trouble, use Web sites that do it for 
you. Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks) has a powerful ratio calcula-
tor. Enter the stock’s symbol in the black, select the “Ratios” option and click 
the Go button. You’ll get the stock’s P-E based on trailing earnings, as well as 
the P-E for the industry and the S&P 500. This gives you something to com-
pare the stock’s P-E with, without having to do a single division problem. 
Taking the P-E to the next level: The PEG
It’s not uncommon for stocks with high P-Es to keep going higher. Many 
times, investors are willing to pay higher prices for companies that are grow-
ing more rapidly. Much of that has to do with the way the P-E is measured. 
Imagine a company, which earned $1 a share, is trading for $20 a share. It has 
a P-E of 20, which might seem lofty if the rest of the stock market has a P-E of 
15. But what if a year from now, the company’s earnings rise by 30 percent? 
If the stock is still $20 a share, that means it would have a P-E of 15, which 
would be in line with the market. So in a way, the stock wasn’t all that over-
valued because it grows into its valuation. 

137
 Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
The importance of a company’s growth rate is one reason for the PEG ratio. 
The PEG compares a stock’s P-E to its expected growth rate. You simply 
divide the stock’s P-E by the expected growth rate. You can estimate a com-
pany’s growth rate yourself by examining historical increases in revenue and 
earnings, as described in Chapter 5. Or you can read analysts’ reports, which 
forecast growth, as explained in Chapter 14. 
 
Investors generally consider a stock to be pricey if it has a PEG of 2 or more. 
Some investors also find a stock becomes attractive when its PEG falls below 1. 
Sometimes, patience can be a virtue when using the PEG. During the severe 
market contraction of 2008, even some of the market’s hottest stocks saw 
their PEG ratios plummet below 1. Internet darling Google surprised inves-
tors when its PEG fell below 1 in early 2009, as its stock price fell to $340, 
giving it a current P-E of 16. Meanwhile, the company’s expected growth rate 
was 18.4%. Divide the P-E of 16 by the expected growth rate of 18.4, and you 
arrive at a PEG of 0.87. Investors who avoided the hoopla and watched the 
PEG got a much better valuation on the stock. 
Evaluating the P-E of the entire market
One of the most valuable things about the P-E is that it is constantly evolving 
as stock prices move. Unlike other fundamental ratios, which are based on fun-
damental data from previous quarters, the P-E changes as stock prices move.

The P-E of a stock can also be compared against the constantly changing P-E 
of the entire stock market. Knowing the P-E of the market is very valuable, 
because it lets you see how pricey, or cheap, a company’s stock is compared 
with the market. You can get a general warning if the stock market might be 
overvalued and headed for a correction if investors are paying lofty amounts 
for earnings. Table 8-3 shows you how the P-E of the S&P 500 has changed 
over the years:

Mining the Proxy Statement 
for Investment Clues
In This Chapter
▶ Expanding your fundamental analysis to include items in a company’s proxy statement
▶ Comprehending how corporate governance works and what it means for your investment
▶ Weighing how to consider if corporate directors may have potential conflicts of interest
▶ Evaluating shareholder resolutions and executive pay
W
hen you think of fundamental analysis, you’re probably focused pri-
marily on the number-crunching aspect of it. And there’s no shortage 
of ratios and other quantitative measures to consider when evaluating an 
investment. 
But fundamental analysis really is as much of an art than a science in many 
ways. Even when it comes to interpreting financial results and valuations, 
there’s a great amount of judgment that goes into it. And judgment becomes 
even more important when considering the proxy statement. 
The proxy statement, or proxy, is one of the more interesting financial docu-
ments. Interesting financial reports, now there’s an oxymoron for you. But 
seriously, inside the proxy statement, companies lay out many of their deep, 
dark secrets that just don’t fit into the neat rows and columns of the financial 
statements. Some of these details include executive pay, composition of the 
board of directors, and even how much the accounting firm is paid to watch 
over the financial statements. 

140
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Getting up to Speed with What 
the Proxy Statement Is
Every year, public companies hold giant shareholder meetings. Annual share-
holder meetings give management the opportunity to lay out the company’s 
strategic plan going forward. 
 
The strategic plan is of upmost importance to shareholders because that will 
describe what kinds of products and services the company plans to push, and 
also how the company plans to finance  the production and selling of those 
products and services. Certain matters are also brought to a vote during the 
shareholder meetings. I discuss the annual shareholder meeting, and ways to 
analyze them, in more detail in Chapter 13. 
This section unearths the proxy statement, which is the document compa-
nies provide to shareholders before the shareholder meeting. The proxy is a 
key document that describes in detail the nitty gritty aspects of a company 
including its strategic plan and how it will achieve its financial goals.
Uncovering info in the proxy statement
The proxy statement is intended to brief investors on all the matters that 
are subject to a vote, in addition to other issues investors must be informed 
of. These documents are stuffed full of details that normally aren’t dis-
cussed, including sensitive topics of how much executives are being paid. 
Fundamental analysts may be focused on the company’s overall financial 
performance, but the proxy is worth paying attention to because it provides 
information about the: 
 
✓ Management’s experience: Fundamental analysts want to have a good 
handle on the people who are running the company. Detailed biogra-
phies of the management team are provided in the proxy. 
 
✓ Board of director composition: If you invest in a company, the board of 
directors is your watchdog. This group is assigned the task of watching 
over the management team and making changes to the people or overall 
strategy when needed. 
 
✓ Compensation: Want to know how much a CEO earns? It’s not a secret; 
it’s spelled out completely in the proxy. 

141
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
 
✓ Conflicts of interest: A conflict of interest occurs when someone in the 
role of watching over the company may have a reason not to be very 
vigilant. Such potential conflicts must be broken out in the proxy. 
 
✓ Ownership details: You can find out which officers or directors of the 
company are also big owners of the company’s stock. 
 
✓ General thinking of other investors: Shareholders may bring matters to 
a vote at the meeting. Sometimes these shareholder proposals get onto 
the proxy, allowing you to find out some of the concerns of other owners 
of the stock. 
 
You may not think the information contained in the proxy is all that critical to 
fundamental analysis. After all, who cares what college a CEO went to, as long 
as the income statement shows robust profit and growth? And it’s true that 
financial results are the crux of fundamental analysis. But getting a complete 
picture of a company’s future requires you to take the time to understand the 
motives and oversight of the people running it. 
Tyco’s telling proxies
If there’s a classic case of how the proxy state-
ment may have been even more telling than 
the financial statements, it’s Tyco International. 
The sprawling conglomerate dazzled investors 
through the early 2000s with stellar financial 
results for many years. Analysts and inves-
tors were certain the company’s diverse mix 
of businesses, ranging from home security to 
electrical parts and industrial supplies was an 
unstoppable cash-flow machine. And had you 
just looked at the income statement, balance 
sheet and statement of cash flows, it would 
have been hard to find any fault with the com-
pany or its management. 
But the proxy statements raised more than a 
few questions even before regulators called 
the company’s management practices into 
question. For instance, in Tyco’s proxy filed 
on January 28, 2002, the company disclosed it 
paid director Frank Walsh $10 million and gave 
another $10 million to one of his charitable foun-
dations in connection to his help brokering one 
of the company’s acquisitions. The only problem 
was that Walsh was also a member of Tyco’s 
board of directors, which is supposed to over-
see the company’s operations. Walsh later pled 
guilty to charges of trying to hide the fees he 
received.
Meanwhile, the proxy showed CEO Dennis 
Kozlowski continued to receive noticeable pay 
hikes in 2001, despite declines in Tyco’s stock 
price. His pay jumped 36% to $5.7 million that 
year, not including 43% higher stock grants of 
$30.4 million and stock options valued at $76.4 
million, according to a USA TODAY analysis 
of 2001 executive pay. And those were just a 
few of the alleged excesses at the company. 
Kozlowski and another top executive were 
accused in 2002 of looting the company of hun-
dreds of millions of dollars and using the com-
pany as a “piggy bank.” The stock cratered in 
2002, and Kozlowski was convicted of fraud in 
2005.

Getting your hands on the proxy
Before online access became so prevalent, you would normally need to con-
tact a company to get a copy of its proxy. Even today, most companies will 
mail shareholders a paper copy of the proxy or send it to your brokerage 
firm, which would forward the proxy to you. But now, whether you own a 
stock or not, it’s pretty simple to just download the proxy for free. The best 
way to obtain a proxy statement is by using the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s IDEA database. You can find step-by-step instructions on how 
to use the SEC’s IDEA system in Chapter 4. 
 
When using IDEA to access a company’s proxy, just remember that the system 
lists the proxy statement under its technical name, the definitive 14A. When 
you’re searching for a company’s proxy statement, you’ll want to scroll down 
for line item labeled “DEF 14A.” That’s the definitive proxy, and the document 
you will work with in this chapter. 
Expanding Fundamental Analysis 
Beyond the Numbers
The income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows are highly 
formatted financial statements. You can quickly analyze them by applying 
scientific formulas and ratios, discussed in Chapter 8, to get insights and 
comparisons. 
But the proxy statement is a little less rigorous. Certainly, rules and regula-
tions stipulate what information must be included. But the information is 
more textual, in many cases, and less tabular. That means you need to have a 
general awareness of what to look for in order to know that it deserves your 
attention. You’ll get that insight in this section of the book. 
Appreciating corporate governance 
If there’s one overarching theme of what to look for in the proxy, it’s cor-
porate governance. Corporate governance is a catch-all term to describe 
the safeguards a company has in place to make sure that the management 
of the company is acting in the best interest for the shareholders. It’s the 
way public companies deal with one of the greatest pitfalls of our financial 
system: the agency dilemma.

143
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
The basic idea of the agency dilemma is the fact that the people who own the 
company aren’t the ones necessarily running it. When you buy 100 shares of 
a company, for instance, you’re not given the right to tell the company what 
kinds of products it should sell. You’re surrendering those key business deci-
sions to the hired hands that run the business. And that includes the CEO 
and the rest of the management team, such as the chief financial officer and 
chief operating officer. 
Not surprisingly, when there are hired hands running an enterprise on behalf 
of the owners, there’s a potential for problems. And that’s the case with com-
panies, too. That’s where corporate governance comes in. Companies are 
required to have a team of business experts, called a board of directors, that 
are supposed to watch over the management team. If the board feels manage-
ment is making poor decisions with the company’s resources, it’s up to them 
to either reprimand or replace them. 
 
The agency dilemma has become even more of an issue with the rise of mas-
sive mutual funds. Large money management firms, which own a vast majority 
of companies’ stock, usually own a stock for less than a year, according to the 
Bogle Financial Markets Research Center. That’s down from six years in the 
1980s. What that means is that the big owners of stock are short-timers, and 
aren’t all that vested in making sure the company is being properly watched 
over the long haul. Many of these large owners are in to make a quick profit, 
and don’t have any reason to care whether the company is being run effi-
ciently and for the long run. That’s why it’s up to you, the fundamental analyst, 
to realize when companies have poor corporate governance, and to steer clear 
when they do. 
Getting to know the board
The board of directors is really your only advocate in the boardroom. Unless 
you own enough shares to get a direct hand on how a company is run, you’re 
leaving it up to the board to make sure your money is properly handled. You, 
the shareholder, get to vote on the board members, and the company pays 
them sometimes large sums to conduct the job as watchdog. 
 
So-called activist shareholders, like Carl Icahn, try to break through the agency 
dilemma by buying large blocks of shares and using the influence of a large 
position to force management teams to make changes. 
Boards of directors also have a number of committees, which take on special-
ized oversight roles. These roles are of upmost importance to fundamental 

144
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
analysts because they get to the core of how professionals are chosen to run 
the company and how much they’re paid. Those committees include the: 
 
✓ Audit committee: If there’s one board to pay most attention to, it’s this 
one. The audit committee is responsible for directly connecting with 
the accounting firm that checks over the company’s books and records. 
The members of the audit committee must be independent, meaning that 
they have no outside business dealings with the company. 
 
✓ Compensation committee: The board members on this committee 
have the job of determining how much to pay the people running the 
company. 
 
✓ Nominating committee: These board members evaluate candidates for 
key jobs at the company. 
 
Paying attention to corporate governance can be a critical part of understand-
ing what companies are worth investing in and which ones are best avoided. 
At 17 of the firms that suffered the biggest business problems and stock losses 
during the first part of the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, most had poor cor-
porate governance, according to research firm The Corporate Library. These 
firms had board members who received excessive compensation or who 
over-boarded by sitting on four or more corporate boards. Over-boarding is 
considered a corporate governance risk, since the directors are distracted and 
potentially unable to adequately watch over any one company. As a group, 
these 17 firms lost an average 80% of their stock value between mid-2007 and 
the end of 2008, twice the loss by the broader stock market. 
Stepping Through the Proxy
When you invest in a company, you’re entitled to vote on some of the com-
pany’s corporate matters, most importantly, on the slate of people who sit on 
the board. Think of the proxy statement as your guide to all the matters that 
will come up for a vote at the company. Generally, most proxy statements will 
include several key elements, as described below.
 
One of the primary purposes of the proxy is to break out how much the execu-
tives are getting paid. This is such a critical part of your analysis, it will be 
explored in more detail in the next section of this chapter. 

145
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
Getting to know the board of directors
Typically, the first section of a proxy provides fairly complete biographies of 
the members of the board of directors. You’ll usually see what kind of experi-
ence the members have, what kind of education they have, and what other 
corporate boards they sit on. 
 
Pay close attention to how many corporate boards the directors sit on. As 
described above, if you notice several members of the board are sitting on 
three, four or more boards, you might wonder how much time they’re able to 
dedicate to the company you’ve invested in. 
Analyzing the independence 
of board members
Most companies will reserve a spot in the proxy, usually below the list of the 
directors, to outline steps that have been taken to make sure the board of 
directors are proper watchdogs. One of the most critical ways to do this is by 
ensuring that most of the board members are independent, or have no direct 
business relationship with the company. 
Bringing good governance to light
General Electric, in its 2008 proxy for its 2009 
meeting, went to great lengths to assure inves-
tors that its board of directors were largely 
independent. At the time of the proxy, GE dis-
closed that 13 of its 16 directors were consid-
ered independent. 
But the company took things a step further by 
detailing the tests it applied to the board mem-
bers to determine whether or not they were 
independent. For instance, GE disclosed that a 
number of the board members were connected 
with companies that did business with GE. But 
the relationships were tested to ensure that 
none of the companies received more than 2% 
of their total revenue from GE.
GE, as required by regulations, further disclosed 
that none of the members of the audit commit-
tee received any sort of compensation from the 
company other than director fees. Director fees, 
or payments made to directors, will be explored 
in more detail later in this chapter. 

146
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Delving into the board’s committees
The key aspect of this part of the proxy is to highlight which board members 
sit on which committees. You’ll want to pay very close attention to who is 
sitting on the audit committee, since this is the group of people that’s suppos-
edly there to protect you from accounting fraud. 
 
When looking over all the directors on the board, you want to pay particular 
attention to the members of the audit committee. Make sure they are finan-
cially literate. A look at their biographies will give you a decent idea if they’re 
qualified for this extremely important job. 
In addition to the competence of board members, you want to look for 
involvement and participation. In this section of the proxy, companies will 
often disclose how many times the members of the board met during the 
year. You want to see the board meeting at least four times a year, or once a 
quarter. In 2008, GE disclosed the board met 22 times. 
You also want to make sure that the board members are actually showing 
up for the meetings. If you see multiple members missing 25% or more of 
the meetings, you might be concerned that they’re not paying close enough 
attention to the matters at hand. 
Finding potential conflicts between 
the board and the company
Most proxy statements will contain a section, often called related-person 
transactions or related-party transactions, which outlines any business relation-
ships board members have with the company they’re overseeing. 
 
If you don’t read anything else in a proxy, always check out the related-party 
transaction section. This is where a company must lay out any potentially 
sweet deals it has going with its officers and directors. Fundamental analysts 
who read this section of Enron’s proxy statements got an early warning of 
some of the strange dealings between the company and its chief financial 
officer, Andrew Fastow. While many of the key details were left out, accord-
ing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, there was enough of a vague 
description of the relationship between Fastow and the company to at least 
raise suspicions.

 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
Understanding how the board is paid
The board of directors isn’t overseeing the company you’ve invested in out 
of the kindness of its heart. The board members get paid, sometimes hand-
somely, for the service. Luckily, the payments received by directors are dis-
closed for all to see. 
 
Pay for board members is a delicate balance. On one hand, you don’t want 
to see board members receiving excessive compensation. If payment is over 
the top, the board members have an incentive to keep their mouths shut and 
not risk their gravy train by raising objections. However, qualified and savvy 
businesspeople aren’t going to take the risk of sitting on a board for nothing. 
Sometimes you get what you pay for. 
Just as you compare a company’s net income and profit to its peers, you 
can do the same with board members’ pay. For instance, the median board 
member at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 in 2008 earned nearly 
$200,000, says The Corporate Library. That was an increase of roughly 12%. 
Keep your eyes open for sudden increases of pay to board members. A big 
spike in pay might indicate the company is trying to ensure a very amicable 
board of directors. 
 
While it’s helpful to compare how much directors get paid with the average of 
companies in the S&P 500, it’s really best to compare against similar compa-
nies of comparable size. Sometimes disparities can be telling. For instance, the 
lead director at Freddie Mac, the lending entity that was essentially taken over 
by the government in 2008, was paid $100,000. That was well above the going 
rate of roughly $30,000 for directors at comparable companies, The Corporate 
Library says.
Sometimes board members are paid in cash. Sometimes they receive stock. 
Most of the time, though, they receive both cash and stock. And in some 
cases, companies may provide additional perks to board members. At GE in 
2008, for instance, board members were permitted to receive GE appliances 
and other products, take part in programs to give gifts to charity, and enjoy 
events for the directors and their spouses. 
 
While it might seem like a potential conflict of interest for the board members 
to take freebies from a company, just pay attention to the total amount of com-
pensation. Be sure that the company clearly discloses all the benefits direc-
tors receive, including the perks, and make sure they’re not excessive. 

148
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Auditing the auditor
While the board of directors is supposed to be your closest ally in the board-
room, luckily, even the board has someone watching it: the auditor. The 
auditing firm has the job of checking over the books and records of a com-
pany to make sure it’s representing everything accurately.
But it’s kind of up to you, again, to make sure the auditor is on your side. One 
of the biggest inherent potential conflicts with an auditing firm is the fact it is 
paid by the company to provide the audited results. That’s a conflict that you 
kind of have to live with, since that’s how the system works. 
 
If you see that the auditing firm is getting paid for all sorts of other services 
for the company besides conducting the audit, you should get concerned. You 
could imagine a situation where an auditing firm would get so reliant on these 
extra fees, it might not be as diligent as it should be. After all, Arthur Andersen 
had a very extensive relationship with Enron, which some say might have con-
tributed to the auditor not raising flags at the company. 
Luckily, the proxy makes digging up these kinds of details relatively easy. At 
the bottom of the proxy, the company must disclose all the fees it paid to its 
auditing firm. The fees are organized into:
 
✓ Audit fees: These are the direct costs the company pays to the audit 
firm for reviewing its books, including the 10-K. 
 
✓ Audit-related fees: These are fees generally connected to the audit pro-
cess, typically a review of the company’s financial controls. 
 
✓ Tax fees: Companies will often tap their auditing firm for tips on ways to 
manage their tax bills. 
 
✓ All other fees: Here’s the line item you want to pay close attention to. 
These “other” fees include consulting fees for information technology 
services and other advisory services that have nothing to do with the 
company’s audit. 
 
It’s usually best when a company has a minimal amount, if not $0, in the line 
for all other fees paid to the auditing firm. You want to make sure the auditor 
is looking out for you, not itself and its partners’ profits. In 2008, GE paid no 
fees outside of audit, audit-related and tax to its auditing firm, KPMG. GE also 
disclosed that the KPMG partners in charge of auditing it must be rotated at 
least every five years. That reduces the chances of the partners getting too 
cozy with GE management.

 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
Finding out about the other 
investors in a stock
When you look to buy a house, you may pay close attention to who your 
neighbors are. It’s helpful to find out what other people are investing in the 
same neighborhood and street. The same goes for stocks. The proxy will 
tell you which executives and directors are large investors in the firm. If 
you want to get a list of the biggest owners of a stock who aren’t officers or 
directors, that information is available elsewhere as I’ll describe in Chapter 
14. Furthermore, you can get an idea of what’s on the other investors’ minds 
by reading the shareholder proposals. You’ll find out how to check in on the 
other investors in the final section of this chapter. 
How Much Are We Paying You? 
Understanding Executive 
Compensation 
Some fundamental analysts might think examining executive compensation 
is a distraction. After all, the salaries of all a company’s employees, including 
the CEO and management team, are subtracted from revenue to arrive at net 
income. Certainly, if a CEO’s pay was completely outlandish, the profitability 
of the firm would fall and tip off fundamental analysts that way. 
Even so, a key part of fundamental analysis is understanding the motives and 
ethics of the management team. After all, you’re entrusting this team of men 
and women to take your money and invest it productively in ways to gener-
ate a return for you. If your money is being siphoned off for the big cheese to 
enrich himself, that’s a problem for a fundamental analyst. 
Studying executive compensation is a detailed science that could fill many 
books. And every year, major publications such as USA TODAY release com-
prehensive executive compensation reports that give you an idea of what’s 
reasonable or excessive. 
 
If you’re interested in learning more about how much CEOs get paid and what 
is generally acceptable, check out USA TODAY’s interactive graphic at www.

Figuring out how much executives earn 
If you’ve ever tried to find out how much a friend or coworker makes, you 
might get the answer, “It’s none of your business.” And that’s probably the 
case. But guess what. Since you’re technically paying the CEO’s salary, as an 
investor, it is your business to know what he or she is paid. 

151
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
 
CEOs don’t typically just get a paycheck every couple of weeks. Generally, 
they receive a base salary plus a number of bonuses and other incentives that 
become valuable if they meet certain performance milestones. That’s why 
most CEOs’ pay is broken into these parts: 
 
✓ Salary: This is the base pay received by the executive. 
 
✓ Bonus: These discretionary payments are generally awarded at the end 
of the year for meeting certain performance targets. 
 
✓ Equity awards: Top executives will often be given compensation that’s 
tied to the company’s stock price. These grants may become very valu-
able if the company’s stock price rises in the future. Equity awards are 
generally stock options or restricted stock, which are both described in 
more detail below. 
For instance, in 2008, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt received a salary of $3.3 million 
and equity awards of $2.0 million for total compensation of $5.3 million. GE is 
one of the few companies to meticulously outline the goals the CEO needed 
to meet in order to earn bonuses and other incentive pay. 
 
You can tell something about executives’ motives by the way they handle their 
bonuses. Immelt, for instance, asked GE’s board of directors not to pay him a 
bonus in 2008 due to the dramatic fall of the company’s stock price. The board 
accepted the suggestion, even though GE meet the operational targets that 
were conditions for the bonus. The denial of the bonus cost Immelt millions, 
since his bonus was $5.8 million in 2007. Immelt also declined a $11.7 million 
long-term performance award. 
On the other hand, former Merrill Lynch CEO Thain was subpoenaed to dis-
close details of more than $3.6 billion in bonuses that were handed to execu-
tives of that firm at the end of 2008. Those bonuses were paid just before the 
distressed investment bank was about to report a massive $27 billion loss for 
the year and was rescued by both taxpayers and Bank of America in a rushed 
merger. Interestingly, Thain was also the highest-paid CEO in 2007 according 
to Table 9-1 above. 
Checking out the other perks 
executives receive
Oh, to live the life of a CEO. In addition to the pay, CEOs receive other noncash 
bonuses. The more forthcoming companies will break out all these perks, too. 
These perks generally include personal use of the corporate jet, leased cars, 
tax-preparation counseling, and discounts or free products from the company. 

152
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Where the real money comes from: 
Options and restricted stock
Just as restaurants make most of their money on the drinks, not the food, 
CEOs don’t make most of their money from where you might think. Salaries 
for most executives, by and large, aren’t where the vast majority of CEOs’ 
Going beyond the proxy to find executive perks
Just as you might negotiate for access to child-
care or extra vacation time accepting a new job, 
the same goes for executives. Executives of large 
companies will very often seek non-monetary 
extras as part of their pay. These extras can 
range from a home-office setup to paid consult-
ing gigs after retirement, paid insurance premi-
ums or tickets to sporting events. 
It’s important for a fundamental analysts to 
pay attention to these perks, because they are 
a factor in determining an executive’s total 
compensation. 
When these extras are large enough the 
company should, in theory, disclose them in 
the proxy statement. But as you’ve probably 
noticed so far, companies go out of their way 
to keep details on executive pay as general as 
possible and not list or itemize specific perks. 
Most of these items are rolled up into a broad 
category in the proxy, usually called “other” or 
something vague. You can often find “other” 
pay listed in a table in the company’s proxy. 
Some companies go a bit further and break out 
the value of certain expected perks executives 
receive such as use of aircraft, cars or financial 
or tax planning. 
And that’s why keen fundamental analysts 
interested in executive pay often find they must 
look beyond the proxy. Don’t get me wrong, the 
proxy is extremely valuable and should be your 
starting point when researching executive pay. 
But remember companies will only go so far in 
listing details on perks executives are getting. 
And that’s why you need to know how to take 
your research one step further to get the full 
story on executive pay. 
The first place to check after the proxy are court 
documents. Lurid details about executive pay 
are often fleshed out in divorce papers, legal 
skirmishes with business partners or in other 
legal battles. 
One of the best examples of how you can get 
more details about all the benefits an executive 
is getting from the company occurred with GE 
and its former CEO Jack Welch. Court papers 
from Welch’s 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 
years revealed many never-before-seen details 
of perks Welch received from GE in retirement. 
Some of the perks included use of a multi-mil-
lion dollar New York City apartment, a limo and 
security for his homes. 
The case even got the attention of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and has 
set a precedent for what needs to be disclosed 
regarding perks. The SEC in late 2004 settled 
charges against GE. The SEC alleged GE didn’t 
adequately disclose the extent and details of 
perks given to Welch. 
The SEC said GE’s 1996 annual report didn’t go 
far enough in describing the perks Welch would 
receive in retirement, instead, vaguely calling 
them “facilities and services.” GE consented to 
the SEC’s order. You can read more about this 
case here: http://www.sec.gov/news/
press/2004-135.htm.

153
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
compensation comes from. Instead, it’s from stock options. Stock options are 
financial instruments that give their owners the right, but not the obligation, 
to buy a stock at a predetermined price. 
 
Options are common tools to incentivize executives. For instance, a CEO 
might get an option to buy 100,000 shares of a stock for $30 a share when the 
company’s stock price is $30. If the CEO is successful and the stock price rises 
to $50 a share, the CEO may exercise the option and buy 100,000 shares of 
stock worth $5 million, for $3 million. The difference, the $2 million, goes to 
the executive as compensation. 
CEOs might also receive restricted stock. These shares are given to an execu-
tive, but cannot be sold unless certain criteria are met, typically after a 
period of time has lapsed. Restricted stock is designed to dangle a carrot in 
front of the CEO as an incentive to keep them at the company and working 
hard to increase the stock price and returns to shareholders. 
Checking In on Your Fellow Shareholders
When you buy a stock, you don’t get a directory of all the other investors in 
the company. You’re free to attend a company’s shareholders’ meeting and 
do some glad-handing. But with that said, the proxy statement can be a useful 
tool in figuring out what executives are also big shareholders in the company. 
Finding out who else owns the stock
Determining other investors who own a stock can be somewhat telling. For 
instance, if you are a value investor, looking to buy stocks at low valuations, you 
might take comfort in seeing whether any well-known mutual fund managers own 
a stock. You’ll find out how to check in on these investors’ moves in Chapter 17.
But some investors take comfort when the officers and directors own large 
positions in a stock, since they have some skin in the game and therefore 
stand to lose personally if the stock price falls. 
The proxy is again your best friend in finding out whether the company’s 
management is willing to eat its own cooking, so to speak. Most proxy state-
ments contain a table, usually close to the bottom of the document, which 
spells out how many shares the officers and directors of the company own. 
 
Some officers and directors feel so strongly a company’s stock price is about 
to rise that they may buy the company’s stock with their own money. These 
types of buys are viewed as bullish signals, because executives are reaching 
into their own pockets to buy shares, rather than receiving handouts as part 
of compensation packages. 

154
Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
These purchases are often disclosed and summarized in the proxy state-
ment, described usually as open market purchases. GE’s Immelt, for instance, 
bought 317,000 shares of the company in 2008, and at the end of the year 
owned 1.6 million shares, the proxy says. Additionally, Immelt has not sold 
any of the shares he received connected to stock options. You can learn 
more about the importance of watching what insiders do with their stock in 
Chapter 17.
What’s on other investors’ minds: 
Shareholder proposals
The proxy lists all the items of business that are up for a shareholder vote. 
The items may be presented by either the company or shareholders. 
Generally, the issues presented by companies are pretty mundane. More 
often than not, they pertain to one of the following items: 
 
✓ Vote for board members up for re-election. Shareholders may either 
vote for each nominated candidate or withhold their vote. 
 
✓ Approve the company’s auditing firm. Often, this is just an exercise 
of going through the motions, since companies tend to use the same 
accounting firm each year. 
 
✓ Authorize the issuance of shares connected with stock incentive plans. 
 
The most interesting proposals in the proxy are almost always the ones 
brought up by shareholders, called shareholder proposals. Some shareholders 
will go to the time and trouble to add items to the proxy for other sharehold-
ers to consider. While many of the items can be frivolous, many times they can 
signal to you, the fundamental analyst, concerns that other investors might 
have. These items might direct you to do further analysis on some portion of 
the financial statements. 
Following the stock market crash in 2008, a number of shareholder propos-
als were directed at companies for issues ranging from excessive executive 
pay to concern about board with over-boarded directors. Many 2008 proxies 
raised the issue of say on pay, a proposal which would allow shareholders to 
directly approve the pay packages offered to executives. Shareholder resolu-
tions also often target golden parachutes, or lucrative payouts to executives 
after they lose their job, including following a buyout by another firm. These 
proposals might be a gentle nudge for you to expand your fundamental analy-
sis to check how reasonable the executives’ pay is.

155
 Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
 
Don’t discount and skip reading the shareholder proposals, especially the 
more outlandish-sounding ones. In the proxy, the company will generally urge 
shareholders to vote down such proposals and offer somewhat detailed 
insight on why the proposals are a bad idea. The defenses companies provide 
can offer useful insight for fundamental analysts. For instance, in GE’s 2008 
proxy, one investor called for the company to conduct a study on whether to 
cut itself up into four different businesses. The shareholder claimed the four 
separate companies housed inside GE would be worth 30% more than the 
combined GE. The company’s defense outlined a number of divestitures the 
company made to streamline itself. And in the course of rejecting the idea, GE 
went into detail on how its business model, which tied together seemingly dif-
ferent businesses, continues to work.

ouldn’t it be nice if newspapers or financial Web sites put a big red 
dot next to the stocks that are going to fall in the next six months 
and a green dot next to the ones that are going to rise? Investing would be so 
simple. 
Unfortunately, though, that’s not the case. Deciding whether to buy or sell a 
stock is an excruciatingly difficult thing to do. There are dozens, if not more 
variables that go into this very important decision. You not only need to size 
up the health of the business and evaluate whether or not it has enough cash 
to survive, but also consider whether the stock price is attractive. 
Fundamental analysis may not be a crystal ball. Cheap stocks can get 
cheaper and pricey stocks can soar. But fundamental analysis can at least 
give you some guidance on buying and selling. This section of the book 
explores some of the aspects of fundamental analysis that can help you intel-
ligently approach investing with your eyes wide open. You’ll discover how 
to apply many of the tools discussed in the early sections of the book to 
help you determine if you should be intrigued by investments, and when you 
should avoid them.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Looking For Buy Signals 
from the Fundamentals
When you go shopping for any big-ticket item, there’s probably not one single 
factor that makes your decision. Before you buy a car, for instance, you don’t 
just consider the color. You probably weigh all sorts of factors ranging from 
the reliability of the model to the quality of the interior and, perhaps most 
importantly, the price. 
The same multistep approach applies when you’re shopping for stocks. Very 
rarely is there a single factor that flashes a bright light to tell you that it’s 
time to buy. As a fundamental analyst, you need to consider a variety of traits 
that, together, might give you an idea if it’s worth taking a shot on a stock. 
Fundamental analysts often concentrate on a few aspects of a stock, which 
might make it an attractive investment, including: 
 
✓ Staying power: You want to make sure a company has the financial 
resources to endure a downturn and come out on the other side. 
 
✓ The trajectory of the fundamentals: Since a stock price, over time, is 
connected to a company’s revenue and earnings, fundamental analysts 
try to see improving trends in the company’s revenue and profit. Trend 
spotting will be discussed at more length in Chapter 17.
 
✓ Evidence of skilled management: A management team with experience 
navigating through the ups and downs of a business may give the funda-
mental analyst more confidence in the company’s future. Skilled manag-
ers can protect their company’s business from competition with strong 
brands, service or quality. 
 
✓ Valuation: Even if a company is performing poorly, the stock can still 
be a good investment if the bad news is already reflected in the price. 
Fundamental analysts spend a great deal of their time comparing a 
company’s current stock price to its real value, based on what they 
think it’s worth. You discovered how to use the P-E as a valuation tool 
in Chapter 8, and in this chapter you’ll find out about the earnings yield. 
Fundamental analysts also look for good values using the discounted 
cash-flow model, explored in Chapter 11. 
 
✓ Dividend payments: These seemingly small cash payments can quickly 
add up and become a significant consideration for a fundamental ana-
lyst. Fundamental analysts also use these dividends as a way to measure 
the attractiveness of some stocks, as will be discussed at the end of this 
chapter.

Finding companies that 
have staying power
Let’s face it. Capitalism isn’t pretty. There are times of tremendous affluence 
when companies are reporting stellar profits. Fundamental analysis may help 
you find the companies that stand to steal away business from rivals during 
these boom times. 
But, as a normal part of the ups and downs of business, or the business cycle, 
there will eventually be a downturn. And it’s often during these tough times 
that companies demonstrate their lasting power. Since many investors give up 
on companies when they’re down or out of favor, that can present tremendous 
Now it’s time for a disclaimer 
Before you get too far into this chapter, it’s a 
good time for a big fat disclaimer. Here goes. 
Fundamental analysis doesn’t guarantee that 
you’ll always make money on stocks by buying 
and selling at the exact right times. I know, 
that’s not the kind of statement that’s going to 
make this book a best-seller. 
Just remember there’s a paradox to using fun-
damental analysis as a tool to tell you when to 
buy or sell stocks, and you need to be mindful 
of it from the start. You’re not the only one with 
instant access to a company’s financial state-
ments and performance. Scores of mutual fund 
companies, hedge funds, and other large inves-
tors get the same fundamental data you do and 
comb through them with armies of analysts and 
computers. If they see a stock that’s underval-
ued, they may move quickly and push the stock 
price up. And when a stock moves up, other 
investors may pile on and push it higher. 
All this means that many investors who try to 
buy and sell individual stocks at just the right 
times are often unsuccessful. And that’s why 
it’s often best for many investors to simply buy 
every stock on a stock market index, such as 
the Standard & Poor’s 500, through an index 
fund, rather than try to time the market. Even the 
king of fundamental analysis, Warren Buffett, 
wrote in his 1996 letter to shareholders: “Most 
investors, both institutional and individual, will 
find that the best way to own common stocks 
is through an index fund that charges minimal 
fees.” 
Despite the warning above, fundamental analy-
sis is still extremely valuable for many investors. 
There’s no harm in understanding how invest-
ments you own are valued. And the market 
certainly has periods of indigestion. During 
asset bubbles, for instance, market prices can 
get pushed to extremes relative to their funda-
mentals. The 2000s have provided extraordinary 
examples of bubbles, including the dot-com 
bubble, tech-stock bubble and housing bubble. 
Fundamental analysis can be a tool of reason, 
helping you to at least recognize when inves-
tors appear to be paying more for an asset than 
they have historically or are betting on an overly 
optimistic future. Fundamental analysis is that 
one tool that may help save you from falling 
prey to a bubble, too. 

162
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
opportunity to you as a fundamental analyst, too. If you take the time to find 
companies that are just down, and have the ability to recover, you can pick 
up good companies for low prices. 
Typically, when you’re looking for companies that have the resources to sur-
vive, you want to consider some key elements. 
Liquidity: Cash is king
If you’re trying to buy into a company on the cheap, you want to make sure it 
has the ability to weather the difficult times. And that calls for a close exami-
nation of liquidity, or ready access to cash. Make sure you pay close atten-
tion to a company’s current ratio, as described in Chapter 6. This is a good 
approximation of whether a company will be able to raise enough cash to pay 
its bills due in a year. 
 
There’s a very important pecking order to investing you need to be very aware 
of. When you buy stock in a company that’s on the decline, you’re playing a 
bit of a game of chicken. In the case that the company defaults, or fails to pay 
its interest back to lenders, there’s a chance that the company may be restruc-
tured or sold off. And if that happens, as a stock holder, you’re the very last 
one in line at the asset buffet. Stock investors come behind everyone, includ-
ing employees owed their salaries and bond holders, for any money that’s left 
over. That’s why when you invest in a company that is dangerously faltering, 
you must be absolutely sure that you’ve carefully measured whether or not it 
has enough liquidity to keep going. 
Low debt loads and big piles of cash 
When you’re looking for cheap stocks of companies that may survive, be 
certain to consider the companies that have little to no debt. Companies 
that don’t have an enormous amount of money to repay can tread water and 
get their operations in order before they have to worry about meeting oner-
ous interest costs. Pay close attention to a company’s interest coverage ratio, 
described in Chapter 8. The lower this ratio, the better the company will be 
able to handle a downturn. And make sure the total amount of debt a com-
pany owes is reasonable. Again, Chapter 8 will help you access this by con-
sidering the debt-to-equity ratio. 
Don’t think it’s possible to run a company without borrowing? Believe it. 
Table 10-1 shows some of the largest U.S. companies in the S&P 500 that had 
no long-term debt at the end of 2008 and that also saw their shares outper-
form the market. Many of these companies were in relatively strong financial 
shape going into the brutal market correction of 2008 and 2009.

Just because a company has no debt doesn’t mean the stock will rise. That 
point is painfully clear in what you don’t see in Table 10-1. There were plenty 
of companies with no debt that saw their shares fall. Apple and Google, for 
instance, had no debt at the end of 2008, but still saw their shares fall 57% 
and 56%, respectively. Again, I stress, there’s no single indicator to tell you 
whether or not to buy a stock. 
 
One trick that some fundamental analysts use to get a decent idea of the finan-
cial bedrock of a company is to compare its stock price to the amount of cash 
per share it has. Sometimes stocks get beaten up so badly, the company actu-
ally has more cash in the bank than its value in the stock market. This analysis 
is a good complement to studying a company’s price-to-book ratio, which also 
considers how much debt a company has, as discussed in Chapter 8.
To compare a stock’s price to its cash per share, follow these steps: 
 
1. Obtain a company’s total cash and cash equivalents. These data are 
available on a company’s balance sheet. If you’re not sure how to get 
this information, there are detailed instructions in Chapter 6.
 
2. Divide the number from Step 1 by the number of shares outstanding. 
You can get a company’s number of shares outstanding from the balance 
sheet, too. The step gives you the company’s cash per share.
 
3. Divide the answer from Step 1 by the answer in Step 2. If the answer 
is a negative number, that means the company has more in cash than its 
value in the stock market. Some consider this to be a potential sign the 
stock is undervalued.

164
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
 
When a stock price falls below a company’s cash per share, don’t assume it’s a 
screaming buy. Sometimes a stock price gets beaten below cash levels due to 
excessive debt. In that case, the cash doesn’t really belong to the company, 
but to the lenders. That’s why the price-to-book ratio is so helpful, since it 
considers the role of debt. A stock with a low stock price to debt might also 
indicate investors have no confidence in the management team. 
Stable cash flows 
If a company is in a stable business where demand is relatively reliable, 
it may generate ample cash flow to undo many of the challenges it faces. 
You can discover how to measure a company’s cash flow in Chapter 7. 
Unfortunately, many companies with stable cash flow feel inclined to boost 
their profitability by borrowing. Unfortunately, though, these piles of debt 
can haunt companies if business slows. Fundamental analysts may look for 
companies that have stability and the discipline to avoid excessive debt. 
Case study of a survivor: Cisco
Sometimes it’s helpful to consider history to see 
how fundamental analysis can help you identify 
attractive opportunities. Think back to 2002. A 
“Beautiful Mind” won the Best Picture in the 
Academy Awards. The soundtrack from “O 
Brother, Where Art Thou?” won a Grammy. But 
a less- pleasurable development was the brutal 
bear market in which technology stocks were 
suffering. The Nasdaq composite index, which 
is loaded with technology stocks, crashed 78% 
between March 10, 2000 and Oct. 9, 2002. Many 
investors gave up hope on technology stocks, 
figuring they were just overinflated fluff. 
But fundamental analysts who took the time 
to find companies with staying power benefit-
ted. One tech stock that fit the bill was Cisco 
Systems. Cisco was one of the darling stocks 
during the Internet bubble and suffered, too, as 
a result. As companies cut back on the amount 
of gear they bought, Cisco went from making a 
profit of $2.7 billion in fiscal 2000, ended in July, 
to losing $1.0 billion in fiscal 2001. And revenue 
dropped off 15% to $18.9 billion in fiscal 2002. 
The stock was punished brutally as investors 
questioned the industry’s future.
Fundamental analysts, though, knew better. 
Thanks to cost-cutting, the company still 
reported a profit of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2002, 
during the industry’s darkest days. In addition, 
Cisco had a pile of cash and no debt during 
the entire tech crisis in the early 2000s, mean-
ing it had no interest expense to deal with. And 
Cisco’s cash flow from operations, discussed in 
Chapter 7, actually increased during the tech 
crisis between fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2002. 
Fundamental analysts who decided in 2002 
that Cisco would be a survivor were richly 
rewarded. Investors who bought Cisco in late 
July 2002, after the end of the company’s fiscal 
year, ended up seeing their investment rise in 
value by nearly 120% over the next five years, 
nearly twice the return of the S&P 500.

 Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
Looking for a company on the rise
If there’s one thing many investors can agree on, it’s that they want to see a 
company they’re investing in is stable, if not growing. Companies with growing 
earnings and revenue can be attractive investments if the price isn’t too high. 
Fundamental analysis can be extremely helpful in pinpointing companies 
where the earnings and revenues are in an upswing. Some investors, called 
momentum investors, like to buy into companies when they’re reporting faster 
and faster growth. These investors are betting they can grab on to a company 
with lots of good things going for it. But even value investors, who try to buy 
stocks on the cheap, are betting that a company will eventually start to do 
better, and the stock will catch up. 
Finding companies that are growing rapidly is usually done using trend analy-
sis, which is described in detail in Chapter 17. 
Betting on the brains behind the operation
When you invest in a company, you’re not just investing in its brands, prod-
ucts, and assets. You’re having faith that the management team is properly 
equipped to best manage the company to deliver outstanding results. 
Return on equity and return on capital, both discussed in Chapter 8, are the 
best and quickest ways to figure out how well a company is managed. But 
many fundamental analysts dig even deeper by dissecting return on assets. 
Return on assets, by itself, is a helpful thing for fundamental analysts to con-
sider. It tells you how much profit the company is generating from the assets 
it has under its control. Return on assets helps you see how well a company 
is running itself without any financial distortion caused by the use of debt. 
If you compare a company’s return on assets to that of its peers, using the 
same techniques applied to return on equity in Chapter 8, you get a good 
idea of how well the company is managing your money.
But dissecting return on assets into parts can reveal even more about a com-
pany’s management. To show you want I mean, first consider the formula for 
return on assets: 
Return on assets = Income / Assets
 
Income, in the numerator of the formula above, means different things to dif-
ferent fundamental analysts. Some use net income, since it’s easily obtained 
from the income statement. Yet others use earnings before interest and taxes, 
or EBIT, instead of net income to measure return on assets. You can refresh 
your memory about the advantages and disadvantages of both net income and 
EBIT in Chapter 8.

166
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
You might try testing out return on assets on industrial company 3M, using 
the company’s 2008 financials summarized in Table 10-2. 
Plugging in the numbers in Table 10-2, you determine 3M’s return on assets to 
be 13.8%:
Return on assets ( 0.138) = Income ($3,455) / assets ($25,121)
 
You can convert return on assets into a percentage by multiplying the answer 
above by 100 to get 13.8%. 
Certainly, knowing 3M generated a 13.8% return on assets is helpful. That is 
a tremendous return, compared with the rest of the stock market and other 
industrial conglomerates. During the early 2000s, the average company in the 
S&P 500 generated a return on assets of 5.8%, and a 3% return was the norm 
for industrial companies as a group, Reuters says.

It’s one thing to know 3M has a high return on assets. But fundamental analy-
sis helps you figure out why. You can do this analysis by breaking return on 
assets into its pieces. Bear with me as I present to you yet another formula. It’s 
return on assets broken into its component parts: 
Return on assets = Profit margin × asset turnover
And let’s cut that formula down even further to say: 
(Income / assets) = (Income / revenue) × (Revenue/ assets)
Once your eyes stop glazing over, you’ll recognize the power of this formula. 
What it’s telling you is that a company’s return on assets is a function of its 
profit margin and its asset turnover. A company’s profit margin is how much it 
keeps in profit from every $1 in sales, discussed at length in Chapter 5. And 
the asset turnover is how much revenue a company earns from its assets. 

167
 Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
 
Breaking down the return on assets clearly shows you the two levers a com-
pany can pull to boost its return on assets: profit margins and asset turnover. 
When you plug the numbers from Table 10-2 into the formula, you can see 
that return on assets for 3M breaks into these pieces: 
($3,455 / $25,121) = ($3,455 / $25,269) × ($25,269 / $25,121)
I could have spared you from these formulas. But just as doing your own per-
sonal taxes helps you understand how your actions affect your tax bill, break-
ing down return on assets lets you see how a company’s management can 
boost returns to shareholders, which is of great importance in fundamental 
analysis. Just know that when looking for stocks to buy, find those that are: 
 
✓ Boosting their profit margins: Profit margins, however you measure 
them, are a key component to a company’s future. 
 
✓ Putting their assets to full use: The more revenue a company can gener-
ate from its assets, the better the returns. 
 
✓ Doing everything simultaneously: Even a small improvement in profit 
margins and a modest improvement in asset use can have an explosive 
effect on a company’s returns. 
Minding the earnings yield
There aren’t many things in life that are as useful upside down as they are right-
side up. Many a child has shed a tear over an upside down ice-cream cone. 
But the price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E, is one of the few things that can be 
of value upside down. In Chapter 9, you found how the P-E is a key tool to 
understand a stock’s valuation and whether it’s an attractive investment. 
When you flip the P-E ratio over, and look at the reciprocal, you get what’s 
called the earnings yield. While the P-E gets all the attention, the earnings 
yield can also be easier to understand. The earnings yield tells you how much 
in earnings a company is generating for you. 
Let’s keep things simple and use 3M’s net income during 2008 and stock 
price at the end of 2008 for an example. 3M’s stock ended the year at $57.54 a 
share, and the company reported diluted earnings per share of $4.89 a share. 
Dividing the price by the diluted earnings per share, you arrive at a P-E of 
11.8 times. If you’d like to review how to calculate a P-E ratio, flip back to 
Chapter 8, where it’s described in detail. 
But now, try instead, dividing the diluted earnings per share by the price and 
multiplying by 100 to convert it into a fraction. Go ahead, it won’t hurt. You find 
out that the company is generating earnings of 8.5% on every dollar invested in it. 

168
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
 
The earnings yield is so useful because it puts the P-E into a form that is easily 
understood and compared with other investments. For instance, if you could 
get 8.5% in a savings account, then the 8.5% earnings yield from 3M wouldn’t 
be all that attractive. You’ll want to make sure the extra risk is worth it, for 
instance, if you’re convinced the company’s earnings will skyrocket.
Knowing When to Bail Out of a Stock
If you thought trying to pick the right time to buy a stock was hard, that’s 
nothing compared to trying to sell at the right time. Inevitably, when you sell 
a stock it ends up taking off and doubling; at least it feels that way most of 
the time. At the same time, you may have been in a situation where you held 
onto a stock and it just kept falling. 
 
Knowing when to sell is tremendously important when you buy and sell indi-
vidual stocks. When you buy individual stocks, as opposed to buying broad 
index funds, you’re taking on company-specific risk.  Not only are you subject 
to the normal ups and downs of the market, but you’re adding the risk that the 
individual company will make mistakes. For that reason, you need to be very 
disciplined about when you part ways with a stock. Some investors who apply 
technical analysis (discussed in Chapter 19), urge you to sell a stock once it falls 
10% from your purchase price. This will prevent you from taking any large losses. 
Breaking down some top reasons 
to say bye to a stock
There are many reasons why a fundamental analyst might decide to part with 
a stock. Some of the major ones include: 
 
✓ Decelerating earnings or revenue growth: When you start noticing a 
company’s growth is stalling out, that can be a warning sign of trouble. 
Flip ahead to Chapter 17 on ways to isolate trends at a company. 
 
✓ Deteriorating financial ratios: When companies start taking a dramati-
cally longer time to collect cash from customers or pay their bills, that 
can tip you off to trouble. See Chapter 8 for more details on this. 

169
 Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
 
✓ Poor corporate governance or questionable management: If the motives 
of a company’s executives get out of line from those of investors, that can 
be a problem. Chapter 9 will show you how to do this analysis. 
 
✓ Overvaluation: Even good companies can get overvalued. As hard as it 
is sometimes, you might be best off selling a stock when the company 
seems like it can do no wrong and the stock price is soaring to unsus-
tainable heights. There are many ways for a fundamental analyst to 
measure valuations. The earnings yield, discussed above, is one way; 
another is the dividend discount model, discussed below. But don’t 
forget about the P-E and PEG, discussed in Chapter 8, and the discounted 
cash flow analysis covered in Chapter 11. 
 
✓ Rising risk of default: If you have any questions at all whether a com-
pany can pay its debt, sell first and ask questions later. Perhaps the first 
way to sense this is by analyzing a company’s interest coverage ratio, as 
described in Chapter 8. But you also want to scour the annual report for 
the words going concern from the auditors. If the auditors are worried, you 
should be petrified. I’ll show you where to look for this in Chapter 12. 
 
✓ Chronically missing expectations: Wall Street analysts routinely fore-
cast how much they expect a company to earn in a given quarter or 
year. Companies that miss these expectations are sometimes giving you 
a heads up that either the stock is too high or the company is struggling. 
You can read more about this in Chapter 14. 
 
✓ Your appetite for risk has changed: Perhaps you have recently changed 
jobs or think you’ll need your money sooner than you’d thought. You 
might consider selling some of your smaller or more speculative stocks, 
since they tend to be riskier over time. 
Why selling stocks everyone 
else wants can be profitable
There are many aspects of investing that just don’t make any logical sense. 
One thing that often perplexes investors is the fact that sometimes the best 
time to sell a stock is when it seems everyone else wants to buy it. 
 
A good company’s stock may turn out to be a bad investment if you overpay 
for it. 

170
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
There are a few telltale signs that show too many investors are piling into a 
stock, perhaps making it overvalued and a candidate to be sold, including: 
 
✓ Inflated price-to-book ratio: The price-to-book ratio, described in 
Chapter 8, is your first tip-off when a stock is getting driven up too 
much. The ratio compares the stock price to the value of a company, 
according to the accountants. The most basic way to think of book value 
is the total of a company’s assets minus its liabilities. When you see a 
stock’s price-to-book pull ahead of its industry peers, you might con-
sider selling.
 
✓ Lofty price-to-earnings ratio: Unfortunately, there’s no concrete defini-
tion of when a P-E is too high. But one thing’s for sure. When a compa-
ny’s P-E gets high relative to the other stocks in the industry, you ought 
to be concerned and consider selling. Also, if the stock market’s P-E is 15 
and your stock’s P-E is above 100, you might consider selling a bit. 
Data have proven how investors are often best served avoiding the stocks 
that other investors are clamoring to buy, and stick with the ones that are 
being largely ignored. Table 10-3, for instance, shows how growth stocks, 
those with the highest valuations, have performed worse than value stocks 
with low valuations and the market in general. It’s another reminder that 
when others are talking (or bragging) about a stock at a cocktail party, you 
might consider selling.

What Dividends Can Tell You about 
Buying or Selling a Stock
Companies can, and often do, put their best spin on their financial reports. 
As discussed in Chapters 5 through 7, there are things companies can do to 
put their results in the best possible light. But there’s one thing companies 
just can’t fake: dividends. 

171
 Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
Dividends are typically cash payments companies make to their sharehold-
ers. These payments are tangible. You can actually spend them. Dividends 
are real money that gets deposited into your account. Companies that pay 
large dividends often get popular during financial scares, as investors take 
comfort in the fact they’re getting real cash from the company. 
These cash payments, while seemingly small, are very important to the over-
all profit you can expect to reap from an investment.
 
Don’t confuse a company’s dividend with the interest you might get from a 
bond or a certificate of deposit. Dividends are not for sure. Companies can, 
and often do, slash their dividends to conserve cash. General Electric in 
February 2009, for instance, stunned investors when it cut its quarterly divi-
dend by 68% from 31 cents a share to 10 cents a share.
Calculating the dividend yield
When you hear that GE, for instance, pays a 10-cents-a-share dividend, it 
doesn’t tell you much. Sure, that means that you might expect to earn 40 
cents in dividends in the year, but that’s about it. 
That’s why the dividend yield is such a key aspect of fundamental analysis. 
The dividend yield tells you how much cash you’re getting in the form of divi-
dends for every $1 you’ve entrusted to the company. If the stock price were 
to remain flat and do nothing, the dividend yield would be your investment 
return. The formula for dividend yield looks like this: 
Dividend yield = Annual dividend / Share price
 
Fundamental analysts measure the annual dividend in several different ways. 
Some add the actual dividends paid over the past year, while others annual-
ize the current quarterly dividend, or convert the quarterly dividend into an 
annual one by multiplying by 4. When a company has recently cut its dividend, 
it’s best to use the annualized current dividend.
Using GE as an example: 
Dividend yield = (Current quarterly dividend × 4) / Share price × 100
On Feb. 27, 2009, the day GE cut its dividend, the stock price was $8.51. That 
means the dividend yield was 4.7%, measured this way: 
4.7 = (.10 × 4) / 8.51 × 100
At 4.7%, GE’s dividend yield, even after the cut, was slightly higher than the 
S&P’s dividend at the time. 

172
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Knowing if you’re going 
to get the dividend
Investors who are investing in a company need to pay close attention to the 
timing of the dividends. Companies are meticulous about which shareholders 
receive the dividend, and there are several key dates to know about: 
 
✓ Ex-dividend date: This is the date that you must already be a share-
holder or buy the stock by in order to make sure you get the dividend. 
 
✓ Date of record: This is the date that the company looks at its records to 
see who its shareholders are and determines who’s getting the dough. 
If you bought or own the stock by the ex-dividend date, you’ll be on the 
list on the date of record. 
 
✓ Payable date: This is the date you actually get your dividend. 
Making sure the company 
can afford the dividend
It might be tempting to look for stocks with the biggest dividend yields. Some 
investors get dollar signs in their eyes, thinking about dividends as their 
portfolio’s version of money for nothing. There’s just one problem, though. 
There’s no law saying a company must continue paying the dividend. And if 
the dividend gets cut, you may be sorely disappointed. 
There’s no for-sure way to know whether a company will cut its dividend. 
However, there are some telltale signs. For instance, if you see a dividend 
yield creep dramatically above the average for the S&P 500, that can be a tip-
off a cut could be on the way. GE’s dividend yield before the February 2009 
cut was 14.1%, definitely lofty when the average for the S&P 500 was 3.1% at 
the end of 2008, S&P says. 
 
When you start seeing a company’s dividend yield creep up well above the 
rest of the market, that’s a signal to you that either the dividend yield is about 
to get cut or the company is in a deeply distressed situation. Keep in mind, 
though, dividend yields are best compared to like companies. Utilities and 
banks, for instance, have historically paid larger-than-average dividends and 
need to be compared to one another. 
Fundamental analysts will often use some financial footwork, called a divi-
dend payout ratio, to see how affordable a dividend is to the company paying 
it. The formula is: 
Dividend payout ratio = Annual dividend / Diluted earnings per share * 100

173
 Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
To calculate GE’s dividend payout ratio, for instance, divide its annual divi-
dend of 0.40 (40 cents) by the $1.72 a share the company earned in 2008 and 
multiply by 100 to arrive at 23%. In other words, 23 cents of every $1 in earn-
ings are paid out as dividends. A 23% dividend payout ratio is reasonable, but 
you don’t want to see it creep much higher than that since most companies 
need to retain some cash to reinvest in themselves. 
 
Investors need to be very suspicious when a dividend payout ratio gets to 50% 
or higher. A dividend payout ratio that high might mean the company will not 
be able to increase the dividend or might have to cut it. 
 
Some real-estate companies, including those structured as real-estate invest-
ment trusts or REITs, are required to pay out 90% of their earnings as a divi-
dend. REITs are a special case, and the dividend payout ratios do not apply. 
Using dividends to put a 
price tag on a company
You can tell a great deal about a company by its dividend policy, or track 
record of either paying a dividend or not. When a company doesn’t pay a 
dividend, for instance, it’s telling shareholders it still has plenty of profitable 
ventures to plow its extra cash into. 
But using fundamental analysis, you can get even more information from a 
company’s dividend. Using a technique called the constant dividend model, 
you can get a rough idea of what a company’s stock price should be based on 
the dividends the company pays. The formula looks like this: 
Value of a stock = (Next year’s dividend) / (Required return – dividend 
growth rate). 
 
You’ll need to make a number of assumptions to use the constant-dividend 
model. First you need to approximate what you think the company’s dividend 
will be next year. Secondly, you need to estimate what return investors are 
demanding in exchange for providing their cash to the company. This is a 
complicated analysis I’ll discuss in more detail in Chapter 11. Lastly, you must 
guess at what rate the company will increase its dividends in the future. 
At this point, let’s just assume GE plans to pay an annual dividend next year 
of 40 cents a share, investors will demand a return on their money of 11%, 
and dividends will grow by 8% a year. You can measure the value of the GE’s 
stock this way: 
Value of stock ($13.33) = 0.40 / (0.11 – 0.08)

174
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
If all your assumptions come true, GE’s stock price on February 27 of $8.51 
would appear to be undervalued. 
 
If you haven’t noticed, the assumptions you make can dramatically alter the 
results of the constant-dividend model. For instance, if you assume dividends 
will grow by 3% a year, instead of 8%, the value of the stock falls to $5, which 
would make the current price appear overvalued. 
Also, the constant-dividend model only works on companies that pay a divi-
dend. Many smaller or faster growing companies do not pay dividend. With 
those types of companies, you’ll need to use the discounted cash-flow model, 
as explored in Chapter 11. 
Dividends are not money in the bank 
Many investors make the grave mistake of 
thinking dividends paid by companies will keep 
rolling in year after year. In fact, some inves-
tors ask me if it’s safe to replace their savings 
accounts, which often pay low interest rates, 
for dividend-paying stocks. 
There’s certainly a case to be made for divi-
dend paying stocks. Even if you’re an income 
investor, or someone looking for regular cash 
payments from your investments to pay bills, 
dividend paying stocks can make sense. Not 
only do dividend paying stocks give you a shot 
at making extra money if the stock’s price rises, 
very often, companies might increase their divi-
dends over time. The chance at getting extra 
cash is a good thing as you try to preserve your 
nest egg from the ravages of time and inflation. 
But I cannot stress enough that even dividends 
paid by massive companies or even seem-
ingly stable businesses are not guaranteed. 
Dividends are not to be considered a replace-
ment for interest you receive through savings 
vehicles such as certificates of deposits, money 
market funds or bonds. 
If the financial crisis that began in 2007 taught 
investors anything, and it did teach several 
painful lessons, is was just how fleeting divi-
dends could be. As the financial crisis worsened, 
company after company slashed or downright 
eliminated their dividend payments. Even 
companies that had been paying dividends for 
decades were forced to slice their dividends to 
preserve precious cash. For some companies, 
cutting the dividend was the first thing to do as 
financial pressures mounted. 
The dividend cut-fest reached historic propor-
tions in 2009 as companies, especially banks 
that usually pay fat dividends, cut deeply. In 
fact, dividend payments from stocks in the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 fell by 32% in July 2009 
from their level in 2008, says S&P. That brutal 
decline made July 2009 the worst July for divi-
dend payments since 2002. And as of July 2009, 
S&P estimated investors would get $61.5 billion 
less in dividend payments than they did in 2008. 
Talk about a financial hit.
And that’s why, if you’re angling for dividends, 
you need to be very mindful of which compa-
nies are most likely to protect their dividend 
payments. Again, fundamental analysis can be 
your best friend when you’re trying to predict 
which companies are likely to keep paying their

dividends. If you flip ahead to Chapter 17 you’ll 
learn about computer-screening tools, which 
will help you pinpoint companies that have 
been paying dividends for a long time and have 
the financial strength to keep it up. 
But if building a computer screen to find solid 
dividend payers sounds like too much effort, 
don’t worry. I have a very valuable shortcut that 
will handle much of the heavy lifting for you. 
A great place to identify the predictable dividend 
payers is S&P’s Dividend Aristocrats list. To 
make this prestigious list, a company must have 
boosted its dividends every year for at least 25 
consecutive years and be a member of the S&P 
500 index. The S&P 500 is a much-followed list 
of 500 of the largest U.S. companies. You can 
download an Excel spreadsheet containing 
all the stocks on the S&P Dividend Aristocrat

Yes, I know. I can already hear you poking 
a potential hole in this list. Yes, it’s true that 
during the financial crisis even some compa-
nies that increased dividends for decades cut 
their dividends. To help protect you further, you 
might want to find companies that not only have 
a long track record of dividend increases, but 
also have solid earnings so they can afford the 
payments. S&P has a list for this, too, called the 
Dividend Starting Place list. To make this list, 
companies must increase their dividend pay-
ments for 10 or more years and earn at least 
twice what they pay in dividends.
That list is harder to find. But I can tell you that 
in mid-2009, the stocks that made the list and 
had the highest dividend yields appear in Table 
10-4. Remember, though, these aren’t neces-
sarily stocks to buy. Be sure to do your own 
homework, applying all the lessons in this book 
before deciding to buy a stock or not.

Finding a Right Price for a Stock 
Using Discounted Cash Flow
In This Chapter
▶ Delving into what a discounted cash-flow analysis is and what it can tell you 
about a stock price

“I
s this stock cheap?” Those might be the four most commonly uttered 
words by the typical investor. Perhaps you even picked up this book 
hoping to find out ways to answer that burning question. 
Certainly, fundamental analysis can help a great deal when putting a price tag 
on a stock. By evaluating everything from a company’s profitability and debt 
load to its cash flow, you can get a pretty good window into a company and 
help form an educated opinion on its future. Looking into a company’s valu-
ation using common ratios like the price-to-earnings ratio, can help you figure 
out how much investors are paying for a stock. 
But while all these tricks of fundamental analysis can help you find stocks to 
buy or even sell, one of the favorite tools of all might be the discounted cash 
flow analysis, or DCF. The DCF analysis brings an almost scientific approach 
to putting a price tag on a company. If you can perform a DCF, you’ll be miles 
ahead of investors who simply buy an individual company’s stock and hope it 
goes up.

How to Stop Guessing How 
Much a Company Is Worth
If you’ve ever watched a group of kids playing, you’ll quickly learn some 
slightly unpleasant traits of human nature. The room could be filled with 
thousands of toys of all kinds. But, almost inevitably, if one child picks up a 
toy to play with, it’s not long before the others notice and decide they must 
have that same toy. A chorus of “mine” quickly breaks out. 
That same playground mentality often reaches Wall Street too. There are thou-
sands of stocks available. But, quite often, just a few hundred stocks will get all 
the attention while the rest will get ignored. It’s not unheard of for just a hand-
ful of stocks, for whatever reason, to become must-own stocks or story stocks. 
These are shares of companies that seem to do everything right. Investors buy 
into the company’s promises and push the stock price to lofty valuations, only 
for the company to disappoint and the stock to fall back to earth. 
 
It’s very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to know when a stock is over or 
undervalued until after the fact. Complicating things further, even if you’re 
able to determine a stock is undervalued, other investors probably will too. 
And if they do, and buy the stock before you, they will push the price higher, 
and the stock will no longer be undervalued. 
But don’t let the fact that trying to find undervalued stocks is difficult dis-
courage you completely. If you’re going to try to outsmart other investors 
and traders, you’ll need to know how to do a DCF analysis. 
Before getting to that, though, it’s helpful to first consider how the value of 
a stock can be measured. There are two main ways to look at what a stock is 
worth, including the: 
 
✓ Market value: An investment’s market value is what most investors 
primarily pay attention to. A stock’s market value is the price investors 
have attached to a company. Market value is measured by multiplying 
a stock’s price per share by its number of shares outstanding. You can 
review Chapter 3 to learn more about how market value is calculated. 
The constant tug of war between buyers and sellers pushes a stock up 
and down to settle at a price where the demand for the stock equals the 
supply of share. 
 
 When you sell a stock, remember there’s another investor who has just 
bought it from you. That other investor thinks the stock you’re dumping 
is selling for a good price. Does this other investor know something you 
don’t? Before selling a stock, it’s not a bad idea to remind yourself that 
someone else finds it attractive.

179
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
 
✓ Intrinsic value: A stock’s intrinsic value, sometimes called its fundamental 
value, isn’t based on what other investors think it’s worth as is market 
value. Instead, a stock’s intrinsic value is based on all the fundamental 
data you’re been reading about so far in the book, namely earnings, cash 
flow and dividends. A stock’s intrinsic value is based on how much money 
the company is expected to earn over its lifetime. 
 
The difference between an investment’s market value and intrinsic value is 
best understood with an example. Imagine an inventor is auctioning off a 
machine that spits out a gold bar worth $1,000 every year for 10 years. As 
you might imagine, some bidders might be so enamored with the machine 
they might offer hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. Perhaps the bidders 
think they can tinker with the machine to make it spit out two gold bars a year 
instead of one. But in its current form, the machine’s intrinsic value is $10,000, 
not adjusting for inflation, since that’s the value of its output of 10 gold bars 
worth $1,000 apiece.
How minding intrinsic value can help you
One of the best ways to be successful in an auction is knowing what price 
you’re willing to pay before even entering a bid. If you ever find yourself in a 
heated bidding war over a Pez dispenser on eBay, for instance, you’d better 
know how much that dispenser is really worth by consulting a price guide. 
Not knowing the value of a collectible can be perilous if you wind up losing 
your head and overpaying for it. 
The same caution applies to stocks. You might pick up a newspaper and 
keep reading about how great a company’s goods or services are. You might 
chat with your barber or cousin about a promising company. All these things 
might tempt you to be that person bidding up a stock’s price and overpaying. 
“Buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business,” wrote Warren Buffett in 
his 1999 letter to shareholders.
Knowing a stock’s intrinsic value, though, keeps you honest. If you know how 
to determine how much cash a company is expected to generate over its 
lifetime, you know roughly what its stock is worth and can bid only when it’s 
priced right. Going back to the gold-bar machine example, you want to buy 
the machine when you can get it for less than $10,000. 
 
Warren Buffett is famous for paying close attention to a stock’s intrinsic 
value before buying it. He’s constantly searching for stocks that, for whatever 
reason, are trading at or below their intrinsic values. By buying a stock well 
below its intrinsic value, he gets a bit of a margin of safety, or a bit of protec-
tion if the stock price were to fall further.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Getting up to speed for the
discounted cash flow
Now that you know what intrinsic value is, the question is how do you mea-
sure it? There are several methods of calculating intrinsic value, but the DCF 
analysis is one of the top methods used by fundamental analysts. 
In the next section, I’ll show you how to do a discounted cash flow analysis. 
But first, it’s important to understand some of the most basic parts of how it 
works, including: 
A company’s cash flow
Companies brag about their earnings, but it’s cash flow that really matters. 
Unlike earnings, which are a measure of profits based on accounting rules, 
a company’s cash flow is the amount of cold hard cash it generates. You can 
remind yourself of the importance of cash flow in fundamental analysis in 
Chapter 7. 
But to save you from having to flip back in this book, just know that there are 
many ways to define a company’s cash flow. Still, fundamental analysts often 
focus on what’s called free cash flow. Generally speaking, a company’s free 
cash flow is the amount of cash it throws off from its daily business, minus 
any cash it needs to spend on self-improvement, or capital expenditures. 
 
All the information you need to calculate a company’s free cash flow is available 
on the statement of cash flows. The formula for free cash flow looks like this: 
Free cash flow = Cash from operations – capital expenditures
Being able to calculate a company’s free cash flow is the first step in building 
a DCF analysis. The entire analysis is based on the company’s free cash flow. 
Understanding the time value of money
The term discounted cash flow analysis might sound strange. When you think 
of a discount, you probably think of that sweater that just went on sale at the 
mall. But in finance, discount means something different. 
A discount in fundamental-analysis-speak is a way to describe the phenom-
enon that a dollar received in the future isn’t worth as much as a dollar 
received today. If someone offered to give you $100, you wouldn’t want to 
wait around 100 years for it. You’d want it now.
There are a number of reasons why a future dollar is worth less than a dollar 
now, including inflation and risk. Since prices generally rise every year, a dollar 
won’t buy as much in the future as it would today, known as its present value. 

181
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
Most years, inflation eats into the purchasing power of currency. In addition, 
there’s a risk you won’t actually get the dollar in the future. A dollar bill in your 
possession now is more valuable than the vague promise you’ll get one in the 
future. 
 
This matter of the present value of a dollar is critical to the DCF analysis. For 
instance, let’s say you correctly forecasted how much cash a company will gen-
erate in its lifetime. Here’s the problem: You don’t actually get all that cash now. 
You need to wait many years to collect cash as it’s generated by the company. 
Unless you have a time machine and can collect the future dollars, you’ll 
have to rely on some good old-fashioned fundamental analysis to tell you 
what those dollars in the future are worth today. Sounds pretty Twilight Zone, 
I know. But measuring the present value of a company’s future cash flows is 
exactly what a DCF analysis does. 
There are many ways to measure present value, but we’ll start with the basic 
formula to show you how all this works. Trust me; it looks scarier than it is: 
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time
 
The ^ is the way to designate an exponent. Must calculators have a key, yx, 
which will allow you to take a number to a power. 
It’s easiest to get your head around this whole present-value concept with a 
simple example. Imagine you win $1 million in the lottery. Now, imagine the 
state makes you an offer. You can either get the whole $1 million in five years, 
or the state will pay you $950,000 right now. What’s a better deal? 
At first, you might feel like it’s a no-brainer. Why accept just $950,000? You 
wouldn’t even be able to call yourself a millionaire. 
But guess what? Using the concept of present value, you quickly find out 
you’re actually better off taking the $950,000 now. Let’s say interest rates are 
3% and expected to remain there for the next five years. Using the present-
value formula, you calculate that $1 million received in five years is only 
worth $862,608 in present value. Here’s what I mean: 
Present value ($862,608) = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.03) ^ 5
In the example above, the future value of the problem is $1 million. That’s 
what you’re receiving in the future. 
I’ve only subjected you to the torture of the present-value formula to show 
you how it can be calculated by hand. Most fundamental analysts, though, 
aren’t so masochistic and tend to use financial calculators or spreadsheets to 

182
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
calculate present value. It’s a very good idea, if you plan on doing DCF analyses, 
to invest in either a financial calculator or a copy of Microsoft’s Excel. 
 
Using a financial calculator, such as Hewlett-Packard’s HP 12c, the problem 
above is a snap. Simply enter 5, then press the n key for the number of years. 
Enter 3, then hit the i key, for the interest rate. Lastly, enter 1,000,000 and 
the FV key for future value. When you press the PV key, you’ll get the answer 
instantly. 
Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software can also handle the problem pretty 
easily. You would just enter a function that looks like this: 
=PV(interest rate, number of periods, number of interim payments, 
future value)
Or, in this example: 
=PV(0.03,5,0,1000000)
Performing a Discounted 
Cash Flow Analysis
Now that you understand what a discounted cash flow analysis is and why it’s 
critical to fundamental analysis, it’s time to do one yourself. To perform a dis-
counted cash flow analysis, you’ll need a few pieces of information, including 
the company’s: 
 
✓ Current free cash flow: This is how much cash the company generated 
during the most recent year. 
 
✓ Number of shares outstanding: This is the number of shares a company 
has put into shareholders’ hands. A company’s number of shares out-
standing is available from the annual report. 
 
✓ Expected growth rate in the intermediate term: You will need to esti-
mate how rapidly a company’s cash flow is likely to grow over the next 
five to 10 years. You can either estimate this yourself or get it from finan-
cial Web sites.
 
✓ Expected perpetual growth rate: Over time, most companies mature 
and start to grow at the pace of the economy. Over a company’s very 
long term, this more moderate growth rate is assumed to continue into 
the future. 
 
✓ Discount rate: This is how much return investors, in exchange for 
providing their cash to the company, expect to receive.

183
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
 
You’re about to start one of the most math-intensive chapters in this entire book. 
Calculating a stock’s intrinsic value using the DCF analysis requires several 
formulas and steps. Don’t get frustrated if it seems confusing at first. Just 
reread the Chapter and practice, and soon, it’ll make sense. It can also be 
helpful to build a spreadsheet, so you can see how all the calculations fit 
together. This chapter will calculate the intrinsic value of a well-known con-
sumer products company, Procter & Gamble. 
Starting out with free cash flow 
Before you can measure all the cash a company is expected to generate in its 
lifetime, you need to know how much cash it generated in the just-completed 
period. This is the base of the DCF analysis. 
Take P&G’s 2008 results, for instance. During fiscal 2008 ended June 30, P&G 
generated cash from operations of $15.8 billion and spent $3.0 billion on capi-
tal expenditures. Subtract the $3 billion cap ex from the $15.8 billion in cash 
from operations and you determine the company had free cash flow of $12.8 
billion in 2008. 
Financial analysts love the ’80s 
Ah. The 1980s. You might think of legwarmers 
and New Wave music when you think of the 
decade of Flashdance and Duran Duran. But 
for fundamental analysts, the decade wasn’t all 
lost. In 1982, Hewlett-Packard introduced the 
HP 12C financial calculator, which revolution-
ized fundamental analysis. Even to this day, in 
the age of laptops, an HP 12C is almost required 
equipment for any self-respecting fundamental 
analyst. You’ve probably seen the calculators, 
which have a retro look to them, kind of resem-
bling something used to launch the Apollo 
spacecraft. The 12C is hard to miss with its 
industrial style and gold metal band at the top. 
Lore has it that fundamental analysts snapped 
up the HP 12C, in part, because it’s used hori-
zontally, unlike most calculators that are used 
vertically, making it look like a miniature com-
puter. HP still sells the calculator today, making 
it the company’s longest-selling calculator. If 
you’re curious, you can download and read the 
HP 12C’s owner’s manual, which is actually an 
excellent primer in business math. It’s avail-
able for free at http://h10032.www1.
hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00363319.
pdf. 

184
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Getting the company’s shares outstanding
A company’s number of shares outstanding tells you how many pieces a 
company’s ownership is cut into. The number of shares outstanding is read-
ily available in a company’s annual report, or closely related 10-K, and the 
quarterly reports, or the related 10-Qs. At the end of fiscal 2008, P&G had 3.03 
billion shares outstanding. You can review what data are in the 10-K and 10-Q 
in Chapter 4. 
Estimating the company’s 
intermediate-term growth
Up to this point, the data you need to do a discounted cash flow analysis 
are based in fact. A company’s free cash flow last year, for instance, is in the 
financial statements in black and white. The number of shares outstanding is 
also a matter of fact. 
But in this step, you’ll need to start making some guesses. Clearly, there’s no 
way to know for sure how rapidly a company’s cash flow will grow in the next 
five years, much less 10. You’ll need to estimate this future growth rate. 
There are two main ways to estimate a company’s future growth, including: 
 
✓ Historical trend analysis: A company’s historical growth rate is a good 
place to start when trying to see how fast it will grow in the future. If the 
company is in a pretty stable business, looking at its historical growth 
trends can be a good way to forecast the future. After all, consumers will 
generally buy P&G’s toilet paper, detergent and soap in the bad times, 
and they probably won’t stock up during the good times. Using a histori-
cal trend analysis, explored in more detail in Chapter 17, you can get an 
idea of how quickly a company’s cash flow has grown over the years. 
 
✓ Listening to the analysts’ forecasts: The second method of estimating 
a growth rate is by considering what analysts say. Most stock analysts’ 
reports will provide an expected long-term growth rate. Many financial 
Web sites also provide an average of the analysts’ earnings growth fore-
casts, which can be a good proxy for guesses at the company’s future 
cash flow growth. P&G was expected to grow by 10% a year over the 
next five years, according to MSN Money as of early 2009. I will use 10% 
for this example. 
 
 The difficulty in estimating expected future growth rates is a big reason 
why, as a fundamental analyst, you might stick with companies that sell 
products that have stable and steady growth. They are much easier to 
forecast growth for. 

185
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
Going way out: Forecasting 
long-term growth
Companies are like rock stars. Even the great ones slow down over time. Even 
outstanding companies eventually succumb to the gravitational pull of capi-
talism when competitors crowd into their markets and drive down profits 
and eat into market share. 
It’s unrealistic to expect even a good company to keep growing at a double-
digit pace forever. Generally, fundamental analysts assume a company’s 
growth over its lifetime will moderate to the economy’s growth. Over time, 
that super-long-term-growth rate is about 3%. 
Measuring the discount rate
If you thought estimating a company’s intermediate growth rate was tough, 
just wait until you try to estimate the discount rate, sometimes called a com-
pany’s cost of capital. The discount rate is what you’ll use to measure the 
present value of the company’s future cash flows. 
Measuring a company’s discount rate can be an extremely complex calcula-
tion that could keep a supercomputer busy for a couple of days or weeks. 
I’m going to assume you don’t really want to get into the gory details. If you 
do, “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies” (Wiley) will 
delight you and your pet supercomputer. 
For our purposes, though, it’s important to get in the ballpark for the dis-
count rate calculation. There are two primary ways to do this, including: 
Taking a cue from bond investors
One way to estimate the discount rate is by taking the yield being paid on 
some of the company’s bonds that mature in five years or longer. The yield 
is the return investors would get if they bought the bond at the current price. 
The current yield on thousands of companies’ bonds are available for free at 
brokerage firms’ Web sites. Bond yields are also available on the free corporate 
bond tracking system, TRACE, which is operated by securities regulator FINRA 
at cxa.marketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter. Here’s how to get a bond yield from 
TRACE in four easy steps: 
 
1. Enter the stock’s ticker symbol in the “Symbol” blank, located under 
the light blue bar that says “Quick Bond Search.”
 
2. Choose the Corporate option next to where it says “Bond Type:”.
 
3. Select 5 to 10 years in the Maturity space.
 
4. Click the Search button.

186
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
You’ll see a list of the company’s bonds and their yields, giving you an idea 
of what returns bond investors are demanding. In early 2009, the average on 
P&G bonds was about 4.5%. 
 
Don’t assume that a bond’s yield is equal to the discount rate for a stock. After 
all, you’re taking more risk buying a company’s stock than a bond investor 
is taking, since you don’t get a guaranteed return. As a result, you must add 
anywhere between one to three percentage points to arrive at a discount rate. 
In this example, you might assume the discount rate to be 7%. The riskier the 
company, the more you’ll want to add to this yield. 
Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
So, are you sorry you started reading this chapter yet? Hang in there. 
You might not like using a bond yield to approximate a discount rate. After 
all, bond buyers are taking much less risk, since they’re guaranteed a return 
and get first dibs on the company’s assets in case of trouble. 
That’s where the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, comes in. This formula
states a company’s discount rate should be relative to the risk taken by inves-
tors and what return they could get for taking no risk. The formula looks 
like this: 
CAPM discount rate = risk free rate + (expected market return – 
risk free-rate) × stock’s beta
That’s a scary-looking formula. But it’s not bad if you break it down into its parts: 
 
✓ Risk-free rate: This is the return you’d get for taking very little risk with 
your money. Generally, this is the yield on U.S. securities maturing in 
10 years. This yield is available on nearly any financial Web site. Yahoo 
Finance (finance.yahoo.com) lists it on the top left-hand side of the page 
next to the label, 10 Yr Bond (%). The yield was 2.819% in early 2009.
 
✓ Expected market return: This is the return investors generally expect 
from investing in stocks. Generally, investors use the stock market’s 
long-term return of 10% as a reasonable long-term expectation. 
 
 If you don’t like using the 10% long-term average, you can consider mea-
suring the expected market return by adding the dividend yield to the 
earnings yield. If you’d like to find out how to measure dividend yield 
and earnings yield, that’s covered in Chapter 8. 
 
✓ Stock’s beta: Some stocks are riskier than others. Beta is a statistical 
tool used to quantify how risky a stock is relative to the market. When 
a stock’s beta is greater than 1, the stock is considered to be riskier, or 
more volatile, than the market. When a stock’s beta is less than 1, it’s 
thought to be less risky. 

187
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
 
You can get stocks’ betas from nearly all financial Web sites. For instance, 
using MSN Money, money.msn.com, enter the stock’s symbol in the blank in 
the upper left-hand corner of the screen and click the Get Quote button. You’ll 
see the stock’s beta on the right-hand side of the screen. In early March, P&G 
had a beta, for instance, of 0.63. 
Still with me? If so, it’s just a matter of doing some plugging and chugging. 
The discount rate for P&G looks like: 
0.0730 = 0.02819 + (0.1-0.02819) × 0.63
If you multiply 0.073 by 100, you can convert it into a percentage: 7.3%. 
 
When using the CAPM to calculate a discount rate, you must convert all the 
interest rates into decimals before inserting them into the formula. You can 
do this by dividing the interest rate by 100. For instance, 10% is 0.1, or 10 
divided by 100. 
Putting it all together
Now that you’ve gathered all the raw data, it’s time to put them into a full-
fledged DCM. The primary objective is to estimate a company’s future cash 
flows and then figure out what those cash flows would be worth today. This 
section will show you do to do this. 
Forecasting the cash flows for the first five years
You’ll start by creating a table of what the company’s cash flows will look 
like in the future. All you need is the company’s free cash flow from the just-
completed year and its expected growth rate. 
Going back to the P&G example, start with the company’s 2008 free cash flow of 
$15.8 billion. To estimate what the following year’s free cash flow might be, multi-
ply the previous year’s figure by 10%, or simply by 1.1. So, to estimate 2009’s free 
cash flow, multiply 2008’s ($15.8 billion) by 1.1 to get $17.4 billion. And for year 
two, just repeat. Multiple the estimated 2009 free cash flow of 17.4 billion by 
1.1 to arrive at an estimated 2010 free cash flow of $19.1 billion. Keep repeating 
this procedure for five years until you get something that looks like Table 11-1.

Forecasting the cash flows for years five and beyond
You might be wondering how long you have to keep multiplying by 1.1. After 
all, P&G will likely be around a very long time. Luckily, though, yet another 
formula will bail us out and help us figure out how much the company is 
expected to earn in perpetuity, known as its residual value. The formula looks 
like this: 
Residual Value = Cash flow in year 5 × (1 + long-term growth rate)/
(Discount rate – long-term growth rate)
For P&G, that’s $608.42 billion, as calculated by just plugging the variables 
into the formula like this: 
= 25.4 × (1 + 0.03)/(0.073 – 0.03) 
Discounting all the cash flows to current value
At this point, you’ve estimated how much cash the company is expected to 
generate in its lifetime. There’s just one problem. Those cash flows will be 
received in the future. And as you discovered above, a cash flow received in 
the future is worth less than one received now. 
To solve this mind-bending dilemma, you’ll need to discount the future cash 
flows using the discount rate. That’s right. That’s a big reason why this whole 
tortured exercise is called a discounted cash flow analysis. All you need to 
do now is determine the present value of all the future cash flows you’ve 
estimated. Starting with the first cash flow, $17.4 billion, you would use this 
formula:
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time 
By hand, you would calculate the answer, $16.22 billion, by inserting the num-
bers in the present value formula like this:
Present value = $17.4 / (1+0.073) ^ 1 
Had enough of all these formulas and prefer to let your calculator do the 
work? Using an HP 12C calculator, you would follow these steps: 
 
1. Set the number of years. Enter 1 and the n key.
 
2. Set the discount rate. Enter 7.3 and the i key.
 
3. Enter the future cash flow. Enter 17.4 and the FV key.
 
4. Calculate the present value. Press the PV key.
If Excel is more your speed, the following formula will do the trick for you: 
=PV(0.073, 5, 0, 17.4)

Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
Be sure to calculate the present value of all five of the years. And when you’re 
done with that, don’t forget to calculate the present value of the residual 
value. When you calculate the present value of the residual year, in this exam-
ple, it’s considered to be in year five. 
You should get something that looks like what you see in Table 11-2: 
Table 11-2

value
$16.2
$16.6
$17.0
$17.4
$17.9
$417.8
Finally, you add up all the present values to arrive at an intrinsic value of 
$502.9 billion. This number can then be compared with the market value to 
see whether the stock is cheap or expensive based on intrinsic value. 
Comparing intrinsic value to market value
Many investors like to think of stocks in terms of their per-share stock prices. 
And now that you have the stock’s intrinsic value, you can finish the analy-
sis by estimating what its intrinsic value, per share, is. To do this, simply 
divide the intrinsic value of $502.9 billion by the number of shares outstand-
ing, which you figured at the beginning of this section to be 3.03 billion. The 
answer: P&G’s intrinsic value is $165 a share. You then compare the stock’s 
intrinsic value to the current stock price, using the rules in Table 11-3: 
Table 11-3 
Sizing Up Intrinsic Value
If a stock’s intrinsic value is . . .
. . . the stock may be . . .
Greater than the current stock price
Undervalued
Less than the current stock price
Overvalued
At the time this chapter was written, amid the bear market of 2008 and 2009, 
P&G’s stock price was $45.71. Using the discounted cash flow analysis, that 
would make the stock appear to be very undervalued. 
 
Don’t assume that just because a stock looks undervalued using the DCF anal-
ysis, you should run out and buy it. The DCF analysis is highly reliant on the 
multiple assumptions and estimates you’ve made, as I’ll explain more at the 
end of the chapter. Fundamental analysts use the DCF analysis as one of many 
tools before deciding whether or not to buy a stock.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Making the Discounted Cash Flow 
Analysis Work for You
Perhaps your brain shut down as soon as you hit the first formula above. 
Certainly, the discounted cash flow analysis is one of the more math-intensive 
things you’ll do with fundamental analysis. 
Don’t let the parade of formulas, though, discourage you from using the 
theory of the discounted cash flow analysis. Many people, fearing they’re 
paying too much for a stock, love how the discounted cash flow model gives 
a framework to measure a reasonable value for a stock. But the math just 
scares them away. 
And that’s one reason I recommend beginners to use a variety of Web sites 
that will help them do the analysis for you.
 
If you’d like to practice doing another DCF analysis and read through another 
explanation, I’ve made one available here: http://www.usatoday.com/
money/perfi/columnist/krantz/2005-06-29-cash-flow_x.htm.
Web sites to help you do a DCF 
without all the math
Given just how much calculation goes into the DCF analysis, it’s not surprising 
you can just let a computer do all the work for you. A couple of sites worth 
checking out include: 
 
✓ Moneychimp’s Cash Flow Calculator (www.Moneychimp.com/articles/
valuation) attempts to turn the DCF analysis into a matter of plug-
ging in the data. The site asks for you to enter a company’s earnings. 
However, the analysis works the same if you enter the company’s free 
cash flow instead, if you’d prefer. After you fill in the blanks, click the 
Calculate button, and the site will calculate the intrinsic value. 
 
✓ Valuation Technologies’ Discounted Cash Flow (www.Valtechs.com/
r2.shtml) takes more of a tutorial approach. There’s quite of bit of text 
that coaches you on what to enter, and the site does the calculations for 
the DCF analysis. 
 
✓ KJE ComputerSolutions’ Business Valuation tool (www.dinkytown.
net/java/BusinessValuation.html) is made with a fundamental 
analyst in mind. You can enter items from the statement of cash flow, 
and the site helps you process the data to arrive at the intrinsic value. 

191
Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
 
✓ Damodaran Online’s spreadsheet templates (Pages.stern.nyu.
edu/~adamodar). If you click on the Spreadsheets option on the left-hand 
side of the screen, you’ll find a treasure trove of financial spreadsheets. 
There’s a section on the site, called Focused Valuation Models, which 
offers a variety of pre-made valuation tools. 
 
✓ TransparentValue (www.transparentvalue.com) takes a unique 
approach with the DCF model. Rather than analyzing a company’s cash 
flow, and indicating what the stock price is worth, Transparent Value 
tells you how many products a company must sell to justify its current 
stock price. For instance, you can find out how many iPods Apple must 
sell to justify its valuation, based on the DCF model. 
 
✓ Newconstructs.com (www.newcontructs.com) provides an extremely 
powerful DCF tool designed for professionals. The system automatically 
calculates companies’ cash flow, so you don’t even have to crack open a 
10-K. While the system is designed for professionals, individual investors 
may buy reports the company generates using its methodology. 
Knowing the limitations 
of the DCF analysis
Ever hear the expression, “Garbage in, garbage out?” That’s really the best 
way to describe the DCF analysis. While the analysis gives the impression 
that you’re measuring a stock’s intrinsic value to the penny, it’s highly based 
on the few assumptions you’ve made. 
For instance, you can get just about any stock to look cheap if you jack up the 
discount rate. And while the discount rate seems like it’s based in science, 
that, too, is subject to estimation.

Chapter 12
Using the Annual Report (10-K) to 
See What a Company Is Worth
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what data fundamental analysts should be on the lookout 
for in the annual report
▶ Getting a game plan on how to logically read an annual report and find 
the things that matter
▶ Pinpointing seemingly minute details that have large meaning for fundamental analysis 
▶ Tuning into valuable information auditing firms share about companies
M
ail carriers around the country know exactly who the fundamental 
analysts in the neighborhood are. The tip-off? Every spring, hundreds 
of companies publish and mail out the annual report to shareholders, which 
are hefty documents full of just about everything fundamental analysts search 
for. The annual report to shareholders and the closely related official annual 
report called the 10-K, for many fundamental analysts, are the single most 
important documents a company provides to investors all year. Think of these 
annual reports as the company’s printed State of the Union Address, a source 
of information of where the business was and where it is headed. And just as 
the State of the Union Address is a chance for the president to stir up hopes for 
the nation, the annual report is a company’s chance to do a bit of flag-waving 
for itself, too.
The annual report to shareholders and the 10-K annual report are so impor-
tant that I’m dedicating an entire chapter to them. While the 10-K has been 
touched on in previous chapters in the book, this chapter will give you a road 
map on how to read these massive documents when they arrive. 
I’ll share with you techniques used by fundamental analysts to skip past 
the fluff in the 10-K and get to the meat. You’ll also find out how to find the 
subtle, but important pieces of data buried in annual reports. After reading 
this chapter, I hope that you’ll know exactly what to look for when delving 
into these sometimes intimidating documents. 

194
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Annual Report
Plunk. The annual report to shareholders for the company you own shares of 
has just arrived in your mailbox or in your e-mail. You’ll probably notice scores 
of colorful photos and pictures of happy executives and employees at the front 
of the document. But if you flip through pages long enough, you’re sure to hit 
the meat of the report, which is a pile of financials, legal disclaimers and seem-
ingly endless footnotes. You might feel tempted to stuff the document back into 
the mailbox or delete the e-mail and pretend you never got it. 
But while it would seem you need some sort of decoder ring to make any 
sense out of the annual report to shareholders and 10-K, after a little guid-
ance you’ll know exactly what to do. And if you’re already experienced at 
reading annual reports, it’s a good idea to know what kinds of things compa-
nies can easily bury in these documents and hope nobody notices. 
First, a word on the difference between 
the annual report and the 10-K
The term annual report is somewhat of a misnomer. When investors mention 
the annual report, they are either confusing or grouping together two separate 
documents that have similar purposes. There’s the annual report to share-
holders, which is usually just called the annual report, and the annual report 
required by regulators, usually referred to by its legal name, the 10-K.
You may notice most fundamental analysts use the terms annual report and 
10-K somewhat interchangeably. And that’s usually okay, since both the 
annual report to shareholders and 10-K generally contain the same informa-
tion; they just look different. 
 
When the term annual report is mentioned in this chapter, you can assume I’m 
referring to the 10-K unless I state otherwise. 
Introducing the 10-K 
The 10-K is the annual statement companies are required to file with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. These closely monitored documents 
are required as a result of a company being publicly traded, or having shares 
of stock trading on a major market exchange. Companies that have more than 
500 shareholders may also need to file a 10-K. 

195
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
The 10-K is a document giving investors and regulators an update on the 
company’s financial standing each fiscal year. The 10-K isn’t much to look at. 
The document is almost always printed entirely in black and white, and is 
very sparse when it comes to graphics and other pretty stuff. The 10-K is the 
document both regulators and auditors look over to make sure the company 
is disclosing, or informing, investors of all the material, or important, facts 
about its business. 
Highlighting the annual report to shareholders
The document known as the annual report to shareholders is essentially the 
glam version of the 10-K. The annual report to shareholders is usually a slick, 
highly produced document companies mail out to investors every year to 
kind of show off a little bit. Many companies make an online version, which 
features fancy graphics and interactive pages. Generally, the printed version of 
the annual report to shareholders looks almost like a magazine, with the first 
few pages covered with photos of beaming employees and giddy customers all 
beside themselves with happiness about using the companies’ products. 
 
Some companies are trying to remove confusion between the annual report to 
shareholders and the 10-K. A growing number of companies are simply using 
the 10-K as their annual report to shareholders, a move that is also saving 
companies money. But companies, such as Coca-Cola, appear to be making 
the annual report to shareholders more of a high-level and highly readable 
summary for investors. Coke, for instance, calls its annual report to share-
holders its annual review.  In addition to pages of beautiful people in many 
countries drinking soda, Coke’s annual review summarizes the financials in a 
bird’s-eye view. 
If you’ve ever read an annual report to shareholders, you’ll notice there’s 
kind of a Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. The first part of the annual report is 
colorful and fun. Keep reading, though, and the back half gets pretty serious 
and no-nonsense. In fact, the back portion of the annual report to sharehold-
ers is very often a carbon copy of the 10-K, but printed on nicer paper and in 
a more hip font. And in an increasingly common trend, many companies are 
simply putting a colorful promotional folder around the 10-K, called a 10-K 
wrapper, to create a less expensive annual report.
 
Some fundamental analysts say the annual report to shareholders is a worth-
less marketing document. That’s probably a bit of an overstatement, though. 
Certainly, the 10-K is where you want to spend most of your time as an analyst. 
But the marketing portion of the annual report may contain some useful back-
ground to help you understand a company. Just know that the annual report to 
shareholders is written to be flattering toward the company and its executives. 

196
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Getting your hands on the 10-K
Obtaining a copy of the 10-K annual report is surprisingly simple. The document 
is available in several formats, depending on what you’re most comfortable 
with, including: 
 
✓ Downloading from the Securities and Exchange Commission: The most 
direct way to get the 10-K is from the SEC’s IDEA database. This is the 
official database of corporate filings required by the SEC. Downloading 
the annual report from IDEA assures you that you’re looking at the same 
document as the regulators. You can get step-by-step directions on navi-
gating IDEA in Chapter 4. 
 
✓ Downloading from the company: Most companies will put an electronic 
version of their annual report to shareholders on their Web site. You can 
either view it online or download a PDF file. Many companies will also 
provide access to the 10-K. 
 
✓ Requesting a paper copy from the company: If you’re the kind of person 
who likes to take a pencil to paper, you can either call or e-mail most com-
panies’ investors relations departments and request a copy of the annual 
report to shareholder or 10-K, or both. Some brokerage firms will 
automatically send paper copies of these documents to shareholders. 
Dissecting the main sections 
of the annual report
Most 10-Ks follow a pretty standard list of things to be covered. While 10-Ks 
are usually slightly different, and some may contain different items, usually 
you’ll find most include the basic items listed below.
Business
Here, the company describes in excruciating detail exactly what it sells, where 
it sells, and how it makes money. Even if you think you know what a company 
does, taking a spin through the business section of the 10-K can be eye-opening. 
For instance, did you know that Coke sells Kildevaeld mineral water in Denmark?
 Now you do. 
The business section also gives you, the fundamental analyst, a high-level 
view of the company’s business model. Coke, for instance, primarily sells 
beverage concentrate to bottling companies. It’s up to the bottling companies 
to deal with actually turning the concentrate into drinkable beverages, and 
get the bottles and cans to the stores. 

197
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
 
Understanding the specifics of a company’s business model is critical to fun-
damental analysis. For instance, since Coke doesn’t actually bottle many of its 
beverages, a fundamental analyst might be careful before comparing the com-
pany with another beverage company that does its own bottling. The bottling 
businesses requires large investments in machines and trucks, which tend to 
be less profitable than selling concentrate. And speaking of competitors, in the 
10-K’s business section, companies will usually spell out all the companies 
they deem to be their rivals. This list of rivals is very helpful for fundamental 
analysts, since it’s a list of comparables, or other companies to benchmark 
against each other. 
Companies will also state, in the business section, who their key suppliers 
are. Fundamental analysts pay attention to suppliers, checking to make sure 
they’re sound and able to keep providing materials the company needs. Also, 
sometimes it can be a better idea to invest in a company’s suppliers than in 
the company itself. Since the suppliers aren’t as well-known, they might have 
a lower valuation than the company itself.
Risk factors
Cigarettes contain health warnings as do roller coasters and even some food. 
The same goes for stocks. Companies must clearly spell out everything that 
possibly could go wrong. Many of the risks are boilerplate, meaning cut-and-
pasted legalese, but sometimes the warnings can be useful in fundamental 
analysis. 
 
Ignoring the risk factors in companies’ 10-Ks can be a big mistake. The risk fac-
tors section in the 10-K filed by Lehman Bros. in January 2008 was stunningly 
clear. The first risk stated that Lehman stood to suffer if real-estate values 
were to continue to fall. Lehman also pointed out that being unable to borrow 
would “impair our liquidity.” The risks were prescient as the housing market 
fell further and a credit crunch occurred, and Lehman was unable to borrow, 
causing it to collapse just a few months later in September. 
Unresolved staff comments
If the SEC has a problem with any way the company handles its accounting, 
you’ll see the details described here. 
Make sure this part of the 10-K is blank. If the SEC disagrees with a company’s 
books, you should probably find another stock to invest in. 
Properties
Here you’ll get a rundown of all the major property the company owns and 
where it’s located. Coke, for instance, gives the square footage of its 35-acre 
office complex in Atlanta, as well as discussing facilities it leases in Georgia. 

198
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Legal proceedings
You can’t go into business without getting sued, a fact that’s painfully clear 
from this section of the 10-K. Here, you can see all the lawsuits that are pend-
ing against the company and the company’s own estimate of the odds of win-
ning or losing. 
If you’re interested in a company’s environmental record, this is a great place 
to look. You can see whether or not a company has been sued for violating 
environmental rules. 
Executive officers
Curious who’s running the company? You’ll get a rundown here, with bios of 
all the major executives of the company. 
Market for registrant’s common equity
Investors have gotten so used to getting stock information from financial Web 
sites, they often forget the company itself provides some basic, but some-
times useful stock price information. In this section of the 10-K, companies 
generally provide a chart showing how high and low their stock price got in 
each quarter of the year, and the value of dividends paid. The company also 
provides an estimate of how many investors own the stock. 
Some companies even tell you how many shares of their own stock they 
issued, or bought back. Information on stock buybacks is extremely valuable, 
since you can find out whether a company is using its cash on the bet that 
its stock will rise. The importance of stock buybacks to fundamental analysis 
will be covered in more detail in Chapter 12. 
 
Sometimes, investors need to find out a stock’s price after it no longer trades. 
For instance, a stock you own may have been acquired, or bought, by a rival. 
After a company is bought, you can no longer look up its stock price on most 
investing Web sites because it no longer actively trades. The Market for 
Registrant’s Common Equity section of the 10-K can help you get a ballpark 
estimate of a stock’s value in the past. 
Selected financial data
Here, you’ll find a handy reference to the company’s most important financial 
data over the past five years. There may also be some comparative data for 
the industry. This section of the 10-K is very important for trend analysis, 
which is covered in more detail in Chapter 17.
Management’s discussion and analysis
Imagine the CEO of a company was put on the witness stand to discuss, with 
little embellishment, what the company does and what its future looks like. 
That’s the tone of this critical section of the 10-K, often called the MD&A. The 

199
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
company spells out in very plain language what the current standing of the 
business is. 
 
Pay careful attention to the wording used in the 10-K. When a business devel-
opment is called “challenging” in the MD&A, that’s a clue to fundamental 
analysts to dig deeper. 
Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
There are many risks a company faces that go beyond the business risks 
listed above. Companies face the risks of rising and falling currencies, and 
commodity prices, for instance. Some companies sell a great deal of product 
in foreign countries. That means these companies may be exposed to the risk 
of falling overseas currencies, which could hurt the bottom line when the 
profits are brought back home and converted into dollars. 
Financial statements and supplementary data
Here you’ll find the real meat of the 10-K. The company presents all the 
required financial statements, including the income statement (Chapter 5), 
balance sheet (Chapter 6) and the statement of cash flows (Chapter 7). At the 
bottom of the financial statements, you’ll find a further description of each 
of the line items in what are called the financial footnotes. Some companies 
may also disclose in these footnotes if they used a slightly unorthodox way of 
calculating any of the items on the financial statements. 
 
Some of the most important portions of the 10-K are stuffed into the footnotes. 
These various odds and ends are vitally important to fundamental analysis. 
Here, the company will disclose all the financial information that is either too 
specific or unusual to fit neatly into the rows and columns of the financial 
statements. In either case, you’ll want to pay very close attention to the foot-
notes, as I’ll show you later in the chapter. 
Changes in and disagreements with accountants
Just as getting into a tiff with your boss or teacher is generally not a great 
idea, the same goes when it comes to a company and its auditor. If a company 
and its accounting firm has a, shall I say, difference in opinion over the finan-
cials, you’ll find it here. As a fundamental analyst, you want to see this part of 
the 10-K blank, and it usually is. 
Controls and procedures
After the accounting debacles of Enron and Worldcom, regulators leaned on 
all companies to improve the quality of their financials. One of the key areas 
of new financial regulation had to do with a company’s financial controls and 
procedures. It wasn’t good enough for a company to have faith that its finan-
cial reports were accurate. But companies had to take the extra step to say 
whether someone could easily cook the books if they wanted to. Companies 
are required to have safeguards in place to stop fraud from even occurring. 

200
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Corporate governance
This part of the annual report is really just a placeholder for things you can 
find the in the proxy statement. This section pretty much refers you to the 
proxy statement, covered in Chapter 9, which is where a company lays out 
how well the company’s board of directors is watching over the company, and 
how well everyone’s getting paid. 
Exhibits and financial statement schedules
Anything that doesn’t quite fit into any of the categories above is stuffed 
into this part of the 10-K. Interesting items to look for here include the juicy 
employment contracts given to top executives. 
Executive sign-off
All the top executives sign off on the 10-K. And in a somewhat new develop-
ment, in the wake of Enron, a rule called Sarbanes-Oxley requires the CEO 
and CFO to certify that the books and records are accurate, as far as they 
know. 
Auditor opinion
The company’s accounting firm is required to give the company the Good 
Housekeeping Seal of Approval, or not. The auditor’s opinion of the compa-
ny’s books will be covered in more detail later in this chapter.
What was that again? Restatements 
One of the dirty little secrets of accounting 
is the fact that companies make mistakes in 
their financial statements. Mistakes are pretty 
common, actually. It’s not unheard of for a com-
pany, many months or years after reporting 
revenue and earnings, to tell shareholders the 
numbers are wrong and need to be changed. 
When this happens, it’s called a restatement. 
Restatements are one of fundamental analysts’ 
worst enemies. When you analyze a company’s 
fundamentals, you’re forced to somewhat take 
the company’s word on the truth of the finan-
cial statements. When financials are restated, 
that throws into question all the work you did 
analyzing the company. Just see how common 
restatements are by checking out how many 
companies issued restatements in the follow-
ing years (source: AuditAnalytics.com):
 ✓ 2008: 778
 ✓ 2007: 1,111
 ✓ 2006: 1,565
 ✓ 2005: 1,403

 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
How to Tackle a Massive Annual Report
When slogging through a company’s annual report, you might start think-
ing War and Peace wasn’t so long after all. Not only are annual reports usu-
ally around 200 pages long, they’re stuffed with technical language, tables, 
and detailed footnotes that will make you wish you were reading about the 
Bezukhovs and the Bolkonskys instead of revenue and earnings. 
But as a fundamental analyst, reading the 10-K is one of those things you’ll 
quickly master. Don’t worry. You don’t need to be an accountant to get what 
you need from the annual report. In this section, I’ll step you through things 
you should be looking for in the annual report. 
Starting from the bottom up: The footnotes
Reading an annual report is very different than reading a book. With a novel, 
you probably wouldn’t read the back of the book first, in case you ruin the 
surprise ending. But fundamental analysts hate surprises. Perhaps that’s why 
many start reading the annual report near the bottom with the footnotes. 
By reading the footnotes before reading anything else, you can quickly find 
out about all the unusual items going on at the company. It’s usually the 
unusual items that might have the most sway over your final opinion on a 
company’s future or health. 
 
Some fundamental analysts intentionally do not read any of the commentary 
from the management until they’ve reviewed the footnotes of the annual 
report. Management’s discussion, in both the MD&A and in the preface of the 
annual report to shareholders, will be full of positive spin. You don’t want your 
unbiased opinion toward the company to be tainted until you have a chance 
to figure out what questions you have. 
When reading the footnotes, you’ll want to pay special attention to areas 
described in the sections that follow. 
Assets and liabilities that aren’t on the balance sheet
One of the strangest things about accounting rules is companies are allowed, 
for various reasons, to keep certain assets or liabilities off the balance sheet. 
As you can imagine, this is a huge issue for fundamental analysts. The bal-
ance sheet is one of the key financial statements fundamental analysts use to 
assess a company’s debt load and access to cash. 

202
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Sometimes, what isn’t on the balance sheet is more important than what is 
on it. Consider American International Group, or AIG. This massive insurance 
company all but collapsed until the government plowed tens of billions of 
dollars into the company. How could an insurance company be brought to its 
knees? 
The answer was contained in a footnote buried in the company’s 2008 annual 
report: credit default swaps, or CDS. CDS are extremely complicated financial 
instruments that are essentially insurance policies to protect investors from 
bum investments. Just as an insurance policy protects a homeowner from 
a loss from fire, a CDS would protect an investor, say, if a borrower couldn’t 
pay back a loan. AIG made quite a bit of money selling CDS contracts to other 
investors and collecting premiums from them. But fundamental analysts who 
paid close attention to the footnotes saw that AIG was exposed to huge liabil-
ities that weren’t on the balance sheet. 
 
Fundamental analysts who paid attention to AIG’s footnotes saved themselves 
a bundle. When the 10-K was filed on Feb. 28, 2008, AIG’s stock price was still 
trading for more than $50 a share. By the end of 2008, once other investors 
understood the risks of the CDS contracts, the stock cratered to $1.57 a share. 
Understanding pension liabilities
One of the biggest landmines faced by many companies is the huge pension 
benefits they owe to their retirees. During the 1950s, many companies attracted 
talented workers by promising to pay them big portions of their salaries well into 
their golden years. Those promises have come back to haunt many companies. 
 
The size of the pension obligations are disclosed in companies’ footnotes. 
Pension costs can take a big bite out of profit remaining for shareholders. 
When a company’s pension is underfunded, for instance, it is required to 
divert some of its profit to fund its pension plan. Not only can big pension 
shortfalls eat into a company’s profits, they can also cut into how much a 
company can afford to invest in new products, which may dent future growth. 
It gets even trickier. Companies invest much of their pension funds. That 
means if the stock market takes a big nosedive, as it did in 2008, companies 
not only may see their business falter but also be forced to pony up money 
to put into the pension fund to cover the investment losses. For instance, in 
2008, pension plans at the largest U.S. companies were nearly 18% short of 
the funding they need to cover future expenses, says S&P. 
This shortfall of $459 billion is a direct hit on companies’ profitability. During 
2009, for instance, large U.S. companies may need to contribute an estimated 
$70 billion to the pension plans in 2009, up from just $10 billion in 2008, says 
consulting firm Mercer. Table 12-1 shows how companies’ pension liabilities 
change over time. Notice how the shortfall in 2008 got so large, the pension 
deficit was larger than companies’ total profit.

Pension expenses can severely curtail companies’ profitability. If companies 
do contribute $70 billion into pension plans in 2009, that would reduce the 
profitability of the largest U.S. companies by 8%, Mercer estimates. 
Changes to accounting and inventory
Companies have a certain amount of leeway in deciding how to keep their 
books and records. That flexibility is part of the U.S. accounting system. But 
as a fundamental analyst, you want to keep a close eye on when companies 
make a change to their accounting rules. You should always ask yourself why 
a company might decide to change its accounting treatment. It’s also a good 
idea to compare a company’s accounting treatment with other companies in 
the same industry. Watch out when a company uses accounting methods that 
make its earnings look better. 
 
Be extremely suspicious if you see that a company changes the way that it 
accounts for inventory. First in, first out, or FIFO, allows the company to con-
sider the oldest goods in its warehouses to be the ones it sold first. In a period 
of rising prices, the oldest goods will have been the cheapest, so the compa-
ny’s cost of goods sold under FIFO will be lower, and profits higher. 
Under LIFO, or last in, first out, companies consider that the newest inventory 
is sold. When prices are rising, LIFO tends to decrease profits. Be suspicious 
when a company voluntarily switches from LIFO to FIFO, since that’s a quick 
and easy way to artificially boost the bottom line. 
Debt repayment timeline
During the credit crunch of 2008, it became clear that some homebuyers and 
companies simply borrowed too much money. 

204
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
A key part of fundamental analysis is understanding whether a company has 
borrowed too much. And an important part of assessing this is knowing when 
a company’s debt matures, or is due. When a company’s debt matures, sud-
denly it must either pay off the debt with cash, or refinance, by replacing the 
debt with a new loan at the higher current interest rates. 
Chapter 6 shows you how to use the balance sheet to find out how much of 
a company’s debt load is due in more than a year, or long-term debt. But the 
footnotes provide even more detail on when a company must repay its debts. 
If you notice in the footnotes that a big chunk of a company’s long-term debt 
is due in 13 months, and interest rates have risen, that’s a tipoff that the com-
pany’s profits going forward might be lower. If a company doesn’t pay off the 
debt, it may have to replace the older debt with newer debt carrying higher 
interest rates. 
Effects of tax rates
You might assume U.S. companies pay the standard 35% tax rate. But in reality,
 very few companies pay that much. Here, companies must state what their 
actual effective tax rate was and why it differed from the standard 35% tax rate. 
Typically, the effective tax rate might be decreased if a company does a large 
portion of its business in countries with lower tax rates.
It’s critical when sizing up a company’s earnings to compare the tax rate the 
company told investors it would use to the one it actually used to measure 
its profit. It’s possible for companies to artificially boost their earnings by 
using a lower tax rate than investors are expecting. Fundamental analysts, 
too, should pay attention if the result a company’s tax rate is lower is due to 
a temporary reason, such as a short-term tax incentive to open a plant in a 
certain country. If the tax rate rises in the future, the company’s profitability 
might take a hit. 
See what management has to say for itself
The MD&A is one of the most clearly written portions of the 10-K. It’s where 
management spells out, in English, all the important factors facing the com-
pany and summarizes all the key elements investors should be aware of. 
 
For beginning fundamental analysts, the MD&A is a good place to start read-
ing the 10-K. Management will step through many of the portions of its busi-
ness that are of most interest to fundamental analysts. A few of the things 
you should be looking for in the MD&A include the:

205
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
Forward-looking information
If there’s one knock against financial statements, it’s that they are historical 
documents. The income statement and balance sheet, for instance, tell you 
what the company did, not what it’s going to do. And as an investor, you’re 
more concerned about a company’s future than its past. Stock prices tend to 
rise when a company does better in the future than people expect. Look for 
any indication from the company about how it expects to perform in the 
following year.
 
Don’t expect to see the words, “This is what our business will do next year” in 
big, bold letters. Management signals this kind of thing more subtly. 
An examination of the real risks
There’s an entire discussion of the risks a company faces inside its MD&A. 
Many investors assume this is just a duplication of the dedicated risk section 
in the 10-K. But that’s not always the case. 
In the dedicated risks section, the company spells out every single possible 
thing it could imagine going wrong. Some might even say the CEO could get hit 
by lightning. (I’m kidding about that, but some companies go almost that far). 
Many of the risks are pretty generic and probably cut-and-pasted from other 
places. 
But in the risks section of the MD&A, management highlights a few of the 
risks and provides more detail on why they’re so scary. These risks, I’ve 
found, tend to be more of the high-level things that might keep a forward-
thinking CEO up at night. 
 
Don’t get tripped up over whether you agree the risks highlighted in the 
MD&A are really the biggest concerns. What’s important is that management 
thinks these risks are significant. Knowing what keeps the CEO up at night 
gives you a look into the decision-making of a company. For instance, the risks 
of obesity and changing tastes go a long way in explaining why Coke paid 
about $4.1 billion to buy rival Glaceau in 2007. The company was a leading 
competitor in less sugary drinks, such as Vitaminwater, perceived by some 
consumers to be healthier than soft drinks. 
Comparing a company’s promises with reality
One of the top secrets of many fundamental analysts is to always have last 
year’s annual report handy when reading this year’s. By comparing the two 
reports side-by-side, a fundamental analyst might pick up some interesting 
information about how well a company executes on its promises. 

206
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
 
Company executives love to make big claims about the future. Especially in 
the glossy annual report to shareholders, a company might say that it’s invest-
ing big-time in its future. Fundamental analysts, though, have long memories 
and the ability to check the facts. When a company, for instance, claims in 
2007 it’s going to invest in its future, you can find out what really happened by 
reading the 2008 10-K. Simply look up the company’s research & development 
spending and see how its compares with 2007 levels. 
Johnson & Johnson is a good example. In the CEO letter at the front of its 
2007 annual report to shareholders, the health care company stated “We con-
tinue to invest aggressively in research and development.” But interestingly, 
in 2008, J&J actually reduced its research expense by 1.3% to $7.6 billion. 
Certainly, $7.6 billion is a huge amount of R&D spending. But the fact R&D 
spending fell reflects a slightly different reality than indicated in the letter to 
shareholders. 
Being aware of legal skirmishes
Since companies seemingly get sued all the time, it’s easy to get jaded about 
lawsuits. A vast majority of legal claims get dismissed with little cost to the 
company, other than the time of the legal staff. 
However, if you’re investing in a company involved in an industry that’s espe-
cially vulnerable to legal action, you want to pay attention to this section. 
Altria, the parent company of cigarette maker Philip Morris, is named in so 
A Coke and a risk 
While much of Coke’s annual review focused on 
the exciting things going on with the company, 
Coke’s 10-K highlights some of the real risks the 
company faces. 
The dedicated risk section of Coke’s 10-K pro-
vides a laundry list of concerns. But perhaps 
interesting for fundamental analysts is seeing 
which risks the company decides to focus on in 
the MD&A. The MD&A discussion pulls out four 
distinct risks that the company calls its “four 
key challenges.” Those include obesity and 
inactive lifestyles, which the company in not so 
many words says could lead to closer scrutiny 
of where high-calorie sugary soft drinks may 
be served. Secondly, water quality and quan-
tity. The company points out water is its primary 
raw material and expresses concern about its 
availability in the future. Next is evolving con-
sumer preferences, something the company 
learned in the 2000s as many younger consum-
ers started drinking new sodas instead of the 
traditional brands their parents consumed. 
Lastly, is increased competition. 

207
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
many lawsuits that it provides a table of the number of suits and what type 
they are. Altria also breaks down how many of the verdicts have been ruled 
in its favor. 
 
If you’re going to invest in a so-called sin stock, or a company that makes prod-
ucts deemed to have a potentially harmful effect on society, you’ll want to 
understand the litigation risks it faces. 
Paying close attention to amended 10-Ks
You might assume the 10-K is practically chisel onto stone and preserved for 
the ages. But many fundamental analysts are surprised to find out that compa-
nies periodically modify numbers that appear in the 10-K and other financial 
documents for that matter. This is very important for you to remember, since 
it’s possible, that data on an old 10-K is outdated and has since been revised. 
You must monitor such changes since they can greatly affect your opinion on 
a company and its stock.
Revisions and restatements are more common than you might think, as you 
read above. And even large companies have been known to go back and 
change numbers in the 10-K either to fix errors or update numbers with more 
accurate data that became evident after the 10-K was filed. 
General Electric, for instance, made a number of modifications to its past 
financials between 2005 and 2008. Much of the changes pertained to changes 
in the way the company accounted for complex financial instruments called 
swaps as well as sales from locomotives and aircraft engines. 
When you see a company making changes to financial data that appeared in 
the 10-K, you need to pay close attention. As a fundamental analyst you want 
to be sure you understand why the changes were made, how significant the 
changes are and whether the modifications indicate any more serious issues 
at the company. Most importantly, you want to get an idea of whether or not 
the company may have padded financial results in order to make itself look 
good and keep its stock price moving higher. 
Fundamental analysis who paid close attention to GE’s restatements, for 
instance, were right on the money. In August 2009, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission charged GE of fraudulently misrepresenting its 
financial performance in 2002 and 2003 in order to make sure it topped the 
expectations of investors. GE paid a $50 million penalty to settle the charges 
without admitting or denying guilt. 

208
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Examining What the Auditor’s 
Opinion Means For Investors
Investing takes a bit of faith. After all, you’re not permitted to stroll into the 
headquarters of a company and look over its financial books and records, 
even if you’ve invested in the company. The role of oversight is left to the 
board of directors, as discussed in Chapter 9. But the other key watchdog for 
you, as an investor, is the auditor. This auditing firm’s job is to look over the 
company’s 10-K and ensure the books accurately represent the financial 
condition of a company. 
 
While the auditing firm is your watchdog inside the company, keep in mind 
there is a potential for conflict, too. The auditing firms are paid by the compa-
nies, as discussed in Chapter 9, so there’s a risk an auditing firm will not want 
to upset a big client. That’s why if you see any red flag raised by an audit firm, 
that’s a giant warning and should not be ignored. 
Paying attention to tiffs between 
a company and its auditors
When a company and its auditors disagree in large degree, the squabble 
must be disclosed in the Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on 
Accounting and Financial Disclosure section. Generally, you really don’t like 
to see a company getting into a fight with its auditor. For an auditor to dis-
agree to the point of putting the dirty laundry into a public filing, it must be a 
pretty big deal. 
 
Keep a watchful eye if a company abruptly announces it’s replacing its auditor. 
Some companies, which disagree with their auditor, go auditor shopping and 
try to find an accounting firm that’s willing to sign off on the books. Replacing 
an auditor before the 10-K is put out helps a company get a clean audit opinion, 
as described below. Companies are required to file a Form 8-K stating they’ve 
replaced the auditor and whether or not there was a disagreement at the time. 
Understanding the importance 
of financial controls
Both the board of directors and the auditing firm are required to assess the 
company’s financial controls. You may need to check two places in the 10-K to 
get the board’s take on controls as well as the auditor’s take. You will find the 
board’s verdict on internal controls in the Controls and Procedures section of 

209
 Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth
the 10-K. And many times, the auditing firm will attach a separate page called 
the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting. 
The 2007 10-K for computer maker Dell gave a lengthy discussion of the prob-
lems with financial controls at the company that year. The board of directors 
went a step further and described to investors changes that were made to 
accounting to prevent such problems in the future. 
Reading the audit opinion
The Enron debacle put a new fear into the hearts of accountants everywhere. 
The alleged mistakes and omissions made by Arthur Andersen in the audits 
of those giant companies ultimately took the accounting firm down with it. 
Ever since the fall of Arthur Andersen, auditing firms have been even more 
vigilant before signing off on a company’s financial statements. And that sign-
off, called the audit opinion and found in the Report of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm section of the 10-K, is critical for fundamental analysis. 
In this section, the auditing firm will say it gives its blessing to the books, 
usually using wording like “fairly represent the financial position” of the com-
pany. Don’t just stop reading there, though. The auditing firm may point to 
some accounting changes made by the company it thinks investors should be 
aware of. 
 
Always scan the audit opinion for the words going concern. Usually an 
accounting firm doesn’t make a commentary on a company’s prospects. The 
auditor is just in charge of making sure the books are accurate. So when an 
accounting firm has doubts a company may continue as a “going concern,” 
that’s a gigantic red flag to fundamental analysts that investing in this com-
pany is highly speculative.

Comments and Statements

 analysts and investors
▶ Finding out how to evaluate the importance and value of news coming 
from company executives 
▶ Uncovering what happens at annual shareholder meetings 
▶ Parsing through news about individual companies and stocks in media reports
U
nless you belong to an exclusive country club, are in a Rolls Royce 
collectors’ club, or jet out to Davos for the World Economic Forum 
every year, you probably aren’t on a first-name basis with the CEOs of the 
companies you invest in. In fact, you might never have heard the CEOs’ 
voices, even though you’re entrusting them with your money. 
With very few exceptions, most individual investors won’t get a chance to sit 
down face-to-face with a company’s CEO to discuss the future of the business. 
The relative unavailability of management to investors is one reason why a 
vast majority of fundamental analysis is based on closely examining a com-
pany’s written financial reports and regulatory filings. 
There are times, though, when members of a company’s management team 
speak to investors. The most substantive meeting top-level executives have 
with investors is typically during analyst conference calls at the end of each 
quarter. These meetings, usually available to all investors on a limited basis, 
can contain critical pieces of information fundamental analysts need to be 
aware of. There’s also the shareholders’ meeting, an annual gathering of a com-
pany’s executives and investors. These meetings are mostly marketing events, 
but can be worthwhile for fundamental analysts to monitor. Finally, companies 
may release important fundamental data while appearing in the media. 

212
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
In this chapter, you’ll find out how to extend your fundamental analysis 
beyond the financial statements to include monitoring conference calls, 
shareholders’ meetings, and media appearances. 
Using Analyst Conference Calls as a 
Source of Fundamental Information
Every quarter, investors eagerly anticipate when companies they’re interested 
in will report their financial results. As soon as the results are available, fun-
damental analysts start poring through the quarterly earnings press release, 
as discussed in Chapter 4, to get an idea of how the company did during the 
most recent three months. 
And while the earnings press release is pretty complete and usually provides 
the income statement, balance sheet, and sometimes the statement of cash 
flows, fundamental analysts still may have plenty of questions. Some analysts 
might wonder, for instance, why certain costs rose but can’t find a reason for 
the increase in the earnings press release. Other fundamental analysts might 
notice a surprisingly large decline in cash. 
That’s where the analyst conference call comes in. Usually, shortly after the 
earnings press release is disseminated, the company sets up a telephone call 
for Wall Street analysts, who cover the stock, to call in and listen to a discussion 
about how the quarter went. 
 
While most companies’ analyst conference calls are designed for Wall Street 
analysts, that doesn’t mean you should ignore them. I’ll show you, later 
in this chapter, how you can listen into analyst conference calls and even 
access transcripts when they’re over.
Understanding the purpose of 
analyst conference calls 
Analyst conference calls aren’t a chance for the CEO to trade recipes and golf 
stories with Wall Street analysts. While some of these calls sometimes seem 
oddly chummy, they are supposed to serve several primary purposes including: 
 
✓ Discuss and summarize the company’s performance during the quarter. 
Typically the CEO and chief financial officer will read key parts of the 
earnings press release and point out items of note.

213
 Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
 
✓ Field questions from Wall Street analysts. All the analysts who cover 
the company are usually permitted to ask questions about the quarter’s 
results. Many of the analysts also try to extract more forward-looking 
information from the CEO, to get an idea of what the next quarter’s 
results might look like. 
 
 Some companies are trying to give regular investors greater ability to 
ask questions during the analyst conference calls. Morningstar, a market 
research firm, for instance, allows any investor to e-mail questions to 
management. The questions are then collected and answered by the 
management team each month. It’s a good idea to see if a company 
you’re analyzing will allow you to pose questions. 
 
✓ Provide future guidance. One of the most widely watched aspects of 
the analyst conference call is whether the company will indicate what it 
expects to happen in the immediate future. This tip-off to what the 
company thinks is likely for future financial results is called guidance. 
The dimming guiding light of guidance
Some investors are initially surprised to hear some companies provide earn-
ings guidance. It might seem somewhat strange to think CEOs would be will-
ing to make promises to investors about the future, when the future is far 
from certain. And you might think that, if a CEO says the next quarter will be 
strong, that you can quickly make a profit by jumping into the stock. 
But guidance isn’t as mysterious as it might seem. For one thing, many com-
panies have a pretty good idea of what their book of business, or expected 
deals with customers, will look like months in advance. And that’s why when 
CEOs give guidance, they might not be taking as much of a leap as you’d 
think. Some CEOs, too, might give guidance they think will be easy to beat. 
That way, even if the quarter was just as expected, investors might view the 
financial results as better-than-expected and buy the stock. 
 
Just because a company issues positive earnings guidance and says the future 
is bright doesn’t mean investors have a license to cash in. Many times, by 
boosting investors’ expectations, if the company either misses the guidance or 
sometimes doesn’t top even the lofty expectations, the stock price can suffer. 
Some companies, seeing the often perverse way some investors use earn-
ings guidance, are not giving it out anymore. Companies including Berkshire 
Hathaway, Google, Coke, Citigroup and Ford have, at one point or another in 
recent years, stopped giving earnings guidance to investors. 
If a company suddenly stops giving earnings guidance, there’s reason to 
pay attention. Generally, investors assume companies stop giving earnings 

214
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
guidance when they foresee a rough future. And for that reason, typically, a 
company’s stock price will suffer around the time it stops giving guidance, 
according to an academic research report called “Is Silence Golden? An 
Empirical Analysis of Firms that Stop Giving Quarterly Earnings Guidance.” 
Also, when a company stops giving guidance, the growth forecasts from ana-
lysts for the company may be all over the map. You will want to keep in mind 
whether or not a company provides guidance when using analysts’ forecasts 
for earnings, as described in Chapter 17. If you’re interested, you can read 
more about earnings guidance here: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.

Unique things to look for in 
analyst conference calls
During a conference call, you’ll want to make sure the management team 
adequately steps through and describes the just-completed quarter’s results. 
That’s really the most basic reason for the call. But as a fundamental analyst, 
some of the others things you should watch for in the analyst conference call 
include the: 
 
✓ Tone of the executives: Be on the lookout for CEOs and top management 
who act like it’s their company instead of the investors’. One warning sign 
that a management team doesn’t understand it’s beholden to the public 
is if executives act agitated when answering questions from analysts or 
investors. 
 
 The classic case study of what you don’t want to hear happen in an ana-
lyst conference call occurred while Enron was discussing its quarterly 
results in April 2001. Prior to the discovery of the massive accounting 
scam, one analyst pressed executive Jeff Skilling for reasons why the 
company continued to provide scant financial details in the earnings 
press release. Skilling fired back angrily, directing profanity toward the 
analyst. That’s not a good sign.
 
✓ Lack of availability: While nearly all companies conduct an analyst 
conference call, they are not required to do so by regulators. Regulators 
only require the timely filing of regulatory documents, including the 
financial statement. It’s up to the company to decide whether or not to 
hold an analyst conference call.
 
  However, when a company doesn’t provide a conference call with ana-
lysts, that lack of dialogue is somewhat problematic for the fundamental 
analyst. Some analysts also grouse when companies only provide highly 
scripted and pre-recorded conference calls. 
 
 Wells Fargo, one of the largest U.S. banks, only provided a recorded 
statement and offered no opportunity for investors to ask questions when 
the company reported fourth-quarter 2008 results in January. Some found 

215
 Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
the lack of an opportunity for investors to ask questions amid the finan-
cial crisis to be problematic. That prompted some fundamental analysts, 
such as Gradient Analytics, to call attention to a “troubling lack of trans-
parency.” Transparency is an industry term to describe how forthcoming a 
company is with its financial information.
 
✓ Completeness of answers: If you start noticing the management team 
is constantly deflecting questions, refusing to answer queries or provid-
ing very canned answers, your fundamental analysis radar should start 
flashing. Company management should be forthcoming in providing 
information to shareholders.
How to access the analyst conference calls
Now that you’ve read about the analyst conference calls and discovered how 
they can tell you things you can’t pick up from the financial statements, you 
might wonder how to get access to them. 
 
Investors are increasingly demanding to be included in the analyst conference 
calls. And fairly recent regulations, especially Regulation FD, described in 
more detail below, prohibit companies from only sharing material information 
with Wall Street insiders and analysts. 
Most companies make their analyst conference calls available to all share-
holders in a variety of ways including: 
 
✓ Dial-in numbers: Some companies provide a toll-free telephone number 
for anyone to use to listen in on the analyst conference call. Typically, 
though, unless you’re an analyst, you are not able to ask questions. 
The phone numbers are available on the bottom of the earnings press 
release or on the company’s Web site.
 
✓ Web-streams of calls: A growing number of companies allow investors 
to listen to conference calls using their computers. Typically, you’ll find 
the links to the online audio broadcasts by visiting the investor relations 
section of companies’ Web sites. Some companies, including General 
Electric, are also offering streaming video of the calls with investors. 
Can’t listen to the call while it’s going on? No problem. Some companies 
also let you download or stream previous analyst conference calls. 
 
 If you can’t find a link to a company’s conference call on its Web site, don’t 
assume it’s not available. Yahoo Finance provides many analyst conference 
calls, too. Log onto finance.yahoo.com, enter the company’s ticker symbol 
into the blank in the upper left-hand corner and click the “Get Quotes” 
button. Next, click on the Company Events link on the left-hand side of the 
screen. And if you don’t see an analyst conference call there, you can try 
BestCalls.com, a site dedicated to analyst conference calls.

216
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Transcripts and FAQ: Another popular way for companies to share their 
analyst conference calls with investors is by offering a typed transcript 
when they’re over. These transcripts are typically posted on a company’s 
Web site in the investors relations area shortly after the call is completed. 
Some companies, such as Morningstar, provide written answers to 
questions posed by all investors and analysts. 
Companies will often conduct analyst conference calls before the stock 
market opens at 9:30 a.m. Eastern or after it closes at 4 p.m. Eastern. This is 
done intentionally to give companies a chance to fully explain their results 
before investors rush to conclusions and either buy or sell the stock.
 
Be highly skeptical when a company decides to release its earnings after the 
market closes on Friday. It’s highly unusual do to this, since it leaves investors 
all weekend unable to buy or sell the stock during normal stock market hours. 
Generally, companies with very bad news try to slip it through late Friday and 
hope, I guess, that investors won’t notice. 
If you’re not sure whether what’s being discussed on the analyst conference 
call is good or bad, always check after-hours trading. Most financial Web 
sites will show you how the stock is behaving in special electronic trading 
that occurs after the stock market exchanges close at 4 p.m. But don’t think 
you need to start trading after hours yourself. Since the amount of stock 
being traded after hours is much lighter than during the regular hours, you 
might end up paying more for a stock you’re buying or getting less for a stock 
you’re selling than you would if you’d waited.
Getting In Tune with Fundamental 
Information from the Media
There’s no question you get a bulk of your nutrients from your breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner. Those three core meals deliver most of what your body 
needs to get through the day. Even so, there’s a chance that your diet might 
be lacking in some nutrient, which is why some people choose to supplement 
their meals with vitamins. 
You can think of media reports as vitamins that some fundamental analysts 
take. Certainly, the regulatory filings and financial reports filed by companies 
provide most of the data a fundamental analyst need. But still, there might be 
some details that aren’t fleshed out or are buried in the massive documents. 
That’s how financial media can supplement and potentially enhance your 
knowledge about a company.

 Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
Bolstering your fundamental 
analysis with media reports
As you’ve probably noticed reading this book, there’s not really one source 
of information that gives fundamental analysts everything they need to do 
their work. Getting a complete understanding of a company and its stock’s 
valuation requires digging through many documents, looking for trends, dis-
crepancies, and other anomalies. Media reports, available on financial Web 
sites, in newspapers, magazines and on TV and radio can help flesh out your 
fundamental analysis of a company. Some of the things media reports can 
assist you with include: 
 
✓ Breaking news: Since financial wire services and newspapers are vigor-
ously competing with each other, there are hordes of reporters covering 
companies and looking to get any bit of information first. Sometimes, these
pieces of breaking news can have a significant impact on a company and 
its stock price. 
 
✓ Interpretation: Since many reporters are either assigned to a specific 
company or trained to study financial statements, they may notice 
something about a company announcement that you missed. Many media 
outlets also have access to professional-level fundamental analysis tools, 
The fundamental investor’s friend: Reg FD
For decades, analyst conference calls were 
almost completely closed off to individual 
investors. Wall Street analysts got top access 
to the executives of companies, and therefore 
had the best information. Analysts could often, 
for instance, get superior information about a 
company and its stock by being tipped off early 
on earnings guidance. 
But in the 1990s, individual investors and fun-
damental analysts began to grouse about the 
one-sided nature of analyst conference calls. 
After all, if it was possible for individuals to 
execute trades electronically over the Internet, 
why were these important calls with manage-
ment off-limits? 
All that changed after the Securities and 
Exchange Commission passed Regulation Full 
Disclosure, more commonly called Reg FD, in 
2000. This rule clearly stated if a company gives 
out material, or important information to ana-
lysts, it must be given to the public, too. 
All of a sudden, those one-on-one calls between 
the CEO and his pet analyst at a Wall Street firm 
were essentially over. One important caveat, 
though, to remember is that company execu-
tives are still permitted to share nonpublic infor-
mation with the media, since the press’ mission 
is to distribute information widely to the public. 
And that’s one reason why fundamental ana-
lysts should make it their business to monitor 
media reports, as described below, since there 
can be nuggets in the press you might not get 
elsewhere. 

218
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
so they might be able to put numbers into context using data you might 
not have. 
 
 Media reports, too, might make it easier for you to quickly assess 
whether a company’s quarter was considered to be better or worse then 
expected. Reporters who follow a company generally know ahead of 
time what analysts were forecasting for the company. 
 
✓ Deeper understanding of companies and the people who run them: 
Some executives, hoping to get their messages out, might sit down with 
a reporter and more clearly spell out their companies’ objectives or 
goals. Executive profiles might also give you more of an insight into the 
personalities of the people running the company you’ve invested in. 
 
 Some publications routinely provide profiles of company executives. It’s 
important to recognize when these profiles are just CEO adulation, and 
when they’re analysis. 
 
✓ Industry insight: Just reading the financial statements doesn’t really 
give you the buzz about a company or its products. Financial media, 
dedicated to specific industries, might give you a good early indication 
on how a company’s new product, for instance, might be perceived. 
Some large companies, too, might have a Web site that’s dedicated just 
to them. Reading these, and comments from other readers, might give 
you things to look for when analyzing a company. 
 
Technology media can be especially helpful to fundamental analysts looking 
at tech companies. For instance, following the video-game industry’s main 
conference in 2005, media were gushing over Nintendo’s Wii game console. 
At the time, the concept of a game console operated with a motion-sensitive 
controller seemed odd. But the video-game press glowed over the device, and 
ultimately the console proved to be a big success and helped push Nintendo’s 
profits higher. 
What fundamental analysts 
look for in the media
Given the barrage of information available to fundamental analysts, it might be 
overwhelming to think that you need to read every financial Web site, news-
paper and magazine in addition to studying a company’s regulatory filings. 
But savvy fundamental analysts know how to put the media to work for them. 
Rather than reading everything, much of which is duplicative, fundamental 
analysts use the media to zero in on developments such as: 
 
✓ New products: One of the most difficult factors for fundamental analysts 
to deal with is a company’s new products. With little financial track 
record to guide them, fundamental analysts may find it tough to figure 

219
 Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
out which new products are potential blockbusters and which ones are 
money-sucking duds. Media reports can help by offering comments from 
industry experts who can put the new products into perspective. 
 
✓ Bad news: One thing that amazes me as a financial reporter is just how 
deft company executives are at spinning bad news. I’ve interviewed 
executives of companies at death’s door, and the CEOs try to tell you 
how everything is fine. Good financial journalism, though, will help you 
look past the corporate spin and get a good grip on when a company’s 
woes are alarming. 
 
✓ Availability (or over-availability): Ever notice some companies’ CEOs 
are constantly in the press while others’ never are? As a fundamental 
analyst, it’s important to monitor this kind of thing even through there’s 
no way to qualify it. When you notice CEOs seem to be on TV a couple 
times a week, you really need to wonder why they feel so inclined to be 
constantly telling their story. But at the same time, you might wonder if 
an executive is being overly secretive, too. 
When to be skeptical of executives’ 
claims in the media
Just because an executive makes a claim in the media, don’t assume it’s true. 
Sometimes the media outlet, or reporter, isn’t qualified or prepared to call 
out or correct an executive who makes a false or exaggerated statement. 
This point was made clear when the CEO of Amplidyne, Devendar Bains, 
made a series of claims about the Internet company’s products on finan-
cial TV in 1999. Bains said the company tested a new product to speed up 
Internet transmission over a 50-mile distance and the company was ready to 
sell it, a complaint from the SEC says. But the SEC alleges Amplidyne never 
field-tested the products and the company, in fact, didn’t even have finished 
products ready to sell. 
 
Fundamental analysts should be especially cautious of companies that seem 
to be in the business of issuing press releases. Some companies, especially 
those that trade on the largely unregulated Pink Sheets market, attempt to 
stoke interest in their stocks by constantly putting out promising-sounding 
press releases. If trading is light in the stock, meaning there aren’t many buyers 
and sellers, a stock’s price can be fairly easily manipulated by seemingly 
positive press releases. 
 
If you’re afraid of missing when a company or its executives appear in the media, 
you can set up electronic alerts so you will be e-mailed notifications. Go to 
news.live.com, for instance, and click on the “News alerts” link located to the 

220
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
right of the search blank. You can then enter the name of a company or execu-
tive you want to track, and you’ll be e-mailed when any news breaks that men-
tion those keywords. If you’re interested in learning more on how to efficiently 
scan online news for information about a company, you can get some pointers 
in my book, “Investing Online for Dummies.” How’s that for a shameless plug? 
Knowing When to Pay Attention 
at Shareholders’ Meetings
If you’re a U2 fan, you probably swear by the live show put on by the band’s 
four members: Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr., and Adam Clayton. Or perhaps 
you’ve seen endless photos of Germany’s Neuschwanstein Castle, but there’s 
nothing quite like seeing the towering spires in person. 
For some fundamental analysts, the annual shareholder meeting is the face-
to-face chance to interact with a company’s management team. 
 
Getting tickets to a U2 concert may practically require you to hock your wife’s 
wedding ring. Luckily, getting into an annual shareholders’ meeting is much 
easier. As long as you own at least one share of a company’s stock, you get a 
ticket to attend a company’s annual shareholder meeting. 
What to expect during a company’s 
annual meeting
The annual shareholder meeting is kind of like a corporate version of show-
and-tell. Nearly all these meetings are held in large conference halls or audi-
toriums, and not on the companies’ premises. The companies often use these 
meetings as a chance to showcase all the products they offer. You can find 
out when and where a company’s shareholder meeting is held usually in the 
proxy statement, which is discussed at length in Chapter 9.
 
While companies generally don’t conduct their annual meetings at their head-
quarters, you might be a little concerned if a company seems to go out of its 
way to hold it somewhere it knows might be difficult to visit. 
Annual shareholder meetings often follow a script like this: 
 
✓ Flashy introduction: Many meetings kick off with a flashy slideshow or 
video presentation showcasing just how cool the company’s products are. 
There’s very little value to these shamelessly promotional presentations. 

221
 Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
 
✓ Presentations from company management: The CEO and perhaps chief 
financial officer and chief operation officer might give a speech outlining 
their goals for the company in the year ahead. 
 
 There’s rarely any new information released at the annual shareholder 
meetings. Anything of material interest has already been disclosed in the 
proxy statement or the 10-K, which is explored in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Shareholder question-and-answer period: Some companies allow share-
holders to stand up and ask the management team questions. Other 
companies require questions to be submitted ahead of time and will 
only be posed to management if they are selected. In some cases, inves-
tors who have put proposals for a vote on the proxy are permitted to 
give a presentation of their views. 
Putting the “Fun” in fundamental analysis
Typically lacking substantive information, the annual shareholders meet-
ings are generally designed to make investors get a warm fuzzy feeling about 
being investors. Generally speaking, that’s the kind of feeling you, as a funda-
mental analyst, don’t want to have. 
 
It’s dangerous to get so attached to a stock that you lose your objectivity. 
Falling in love with a stock, as it’s called, may cause you to stop asking the 
tough questions when owning a stock. Remember, stocks don’t love you back. 
A few companies are especially famous for their annual shareholder meetings. 
Shareholder meetings of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway are especially 
legendary. Scores of Berkshire investors descend on Omaha (the Qwest Center 
was the location of the 2009 meeting) to try to get close to the Oracle of Omaha. 
The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting is such a big deal it’s almost like a 
weekend getaway. At the meeting in 2009, events included Warren’s Western 
Cookout, dinner at a steakhouse, and tours of corporate planes sold by a 
Berkshire company called NetJets. There are also plenty of opportunities 
to buy and try products sold by Berkshire companies ranging from See’s 
Candies to Borsheim’s Fine Jewelry. Buffett usually refers to the event as the 
“Woodstock for Capitalists.” 
 
Don’t feel like you need to attend an annual shareholders’ meeting or you’ll 
be out of the loop. You can vote on all the important items by mailing in your 
proxy statement form or by voting online. Also, most companies provide the 
presentations from the shareholders’ meeting on their Web site after the event.

undamental analysts generally don’t travel in packs or flocks. 
Fundamental analysts, almost by nature, approach investing as a solitary 
pursuit. Some fundamental analysts even fear getting the input of too many 
people, as biases might distract them from financial ratios and numbers and 
cause personal opinions to taint pure objectivity. 
With that said, though, part of the job of fundamental analysts is to survey 
the financial landscape for any information that might affect the value of a 
company or change its future prospects. And that’s where it can be worth-
while to look into the fundamental research done by others. Fundamental 
analysis from Wall Street brokerage firms and credit-rating agencies can pro-
vide details that you might have missed in your own work. Similarly it can be 
helpful to find out which other investors are buying a stock you’re interested 
in and what they’re saying about it. 
Certainly, as a fundamental analyst, you shouldn’t let the moves of others 
dictate what you do. But the findings of others can provide fresh information 
for you or act as a check against yourself to make sure you don’t miss anything 
critical in your analysis. 

224
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Reading Analysts’ Reports for 
Fundamental Analysis Clues
It might seem strange to suggest you take a look at research reports from 
others in a book about doing fundamental research on your own. After all, 
perhaps you’re interested in learning how to analyze stocks because you’ve 
gotten bad investing advice from a broker or analyst in the past. 
You’re wise to be skeptical of research coming from anyone else, including 
Wall Street brokerage firms. Often times analysts get paid by companies, either 
directly or indirectly, to generate research to convince others to buy a stock. 
In 2003, for instance, the nation’s biggest brokerage firms were ordered to pay 
$1.4 billion to settle charges that they misled investors with biased research. 
With all that said, research from professional analysts can provide you with 
very helpful information to accompany your own fundamental analysis. You 
just need to know how to read analyst research reports and how to extract 
genuinely helpful information from them. And that’s precisely what I’ll show 
you how to do in this chapter. 
Why reading analysts’ reports 
can be worth your time
Sadly, most investors fixate on the wrong thing when reading analyst reports. 
Nearly all the time, investors will look at the top of an analyst report for the 
stock rating and see if the stock is deemed buy, hold, or sell. The simplicity 
of those ratings makes them irresistible, and investors may feel tempted to 
follow them. Unfortunately, many investors get themselves into trouble and 
risk losing a large sum of money when they blindly follow the ratings they 
read in analyst reports. 
 
The stock ratings from analysts are infamously poor. During 2008, for instance, 
just 49% of the stocks with buy ratings from the top five analysts rose, according 
to analyst tracking service Investars.com. That means even if you buy a stock 
recommended by a top analyst, you still have a coin-flip chance of losing money. 
Despite their problems, though, analyst research reports can contain some 
solid information. Some of the reasons why you might want to take a look at 
analyst reports include: 
 
✓ A way to double-check your own analysis: Most of the analysts who 
write these reports are highly trained financial professionals who know 
how to do everything from discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis (as 
covered in Chapter 11) to) to advanced valuation measurement. You 

225
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
might want to compare the results of your DCF model with those created 
by professional analysts to see if they’re in the same ballpark. 
 
✓ Industry insight: Many times the analysts assigned to cover an industry 
either have studied that field for a long time or even worked at a com-
pany in the business. This in-depth industry experience can help you 
improve your analysis of an industry, as discussed in Chapter 16. 
 
✓ Dissenting point of view: If you’re convinced a stock is a screaming buy, 
it might make sense to seek out analyst reports that are less bullish on 
that stock. Perhaps the bearish analyst will point out things you didn’t 
notice in your own analysis. 
 
Analysts’ reports are infamously overly bullish. For a variety of reasons, 
research reports from Wall Street brokerage firms tend to rarely slap a 
dreaded sell rating on a stock, as you can see in Table 14-1. The table, though, 
shows how analysts have been getting more skeptical in recent years. Even 
so, the fact so few companies get a sell rating underscores why you need to 
remember that when a Wall Street firm rates a stock a hold, that’s actually a 
fairly negative recommendation you might consider to be a sell.

Understanding the types of firms 
that put out stock research
Not all analyst research reports are created equal. While the term analyst 
report is a catch-all used to describe nearly all investment research generated 
by professional analysts, there are many flavors of research to be aware of. 

226
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
The first way you should differentiate research in your mind is based on the 
source. Knowing where research is coming from, and how the person or firm 
generating the report gets paid, is vital to understanding what the potential 
biases and shortfalls in the research might be. Typically, research reports are 
put into one of two categories based on their source, including: 
Broker research
Research generated by the analysts at large brokerage firms, such as Bank of 
America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and UBS, is usually what investors think 
of first when its comes to analyst research. These large firms hire armies of 
analysts who have a coverage universe, or set group of stocks, to constantly 
monitor.
 
Never overlook the potential conflict of interest when it comes to broker 
research. Many of the same Wall Street firms that put out research on com-
panies also have large investment banking arms. The investment banking 
portions of these Wall Street firms get lucrative fees performing services for 
companies, such as selling stock or bonds to investors. If a brokerage firm 
were to put out negative research on a company, it could risk upsetting man-
agement and jeopardize the future investment banking business. 
Luckily, if you pay attention you can spot signs of potential conflict in broker 
research. At the bottom of broker research reports, you’ll find a number of 
key disclosures. In one section, the brokerage firm must tell you whether or 
not the firm receives investment banking business from the company covered 
in the report. Analysts, too, must tell you if they personally own shares of the 
Giving analyst reports a bad rap 
It’s long been understood by those familiar with 
investing that the ratings given to stocks by 
Wall Street analysts are to be ignored at best 
due to the conflict mentioned above. 
But the potential for significant conflicts of 
interest became very clear in the early 2000s, 
when 10 investment banks agreed to a sweep-
ing $1.4 billion settlement with regulators for 
allegedly putting out misleading research 
reports to investors. Some individual analysts 
were also penalized. Henry Blodget, a former 
managing director at Merrill Lynch who made 
a name for himself publishing glowing reports 
on Internet companies, was barred from the 
industry and hit with a $4 million monetary 
punishment by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 2003. The SEC concluded that 
these firms and analysts routinely published 
reports that encouraged investors to buy stocks, 
giving them “buy” or “strong buy” recommen-
dations, despite knowing the companies being 
recommended had fundamentals that were not 
sound. Investors who trusted the research and 
followed the recommendations, in many cases, 
lost large amounts of money. These charges are 
more reason why you want to know how to do 
your own fundamental research, rather than 
rely on the work of others. 

227
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
company’s stock. And the company must disclose what percentage of all its 
ratings are buy, hold, or sell. Clearly, if a company only gives out buy ratings, 
you know to take a double dose of salt when reading that firm’s reports. 
Independent research
Wall Street firms aren’t the only firms that provide research on stocks. 
Analysts not connected with a big Wall Street firm are typically grouped into 
the category called independent research. 
By definition, independent research is considered to be analysis that comes 
from a firm that doesn’t have an investment banking unit. As you read above, 
the co-existence of research and investment banking has been problematic at 
times in the past. 
Independent research often comes from boutique research firms, which may 
be operated by one analyst or a team of analysts who may have specific expe-
rience, such as a particular industry or type of fundamental analysis. Other 
independent research comes from quantitative research firms, which create 
automated computer programs to study different stocks using a series of tests. 
But not all independent research comes from small research firms. In fact, 
one of the largest providers of independent research is Standard & Poor’s, an 
investment research company that provides data and information on stocks, 
bonds and other investments. S&P’s research is considered to be indepen-
dent because the company does not do investment banking. 
 
But just because research comes from an independent research firm, don’t 
assume it’s better than the research from a brokerage firm. In fact, after 
the settlement with Wall Street firms, the quality of some brokerage firm’s 
research improved markedly. Similarly, some of the research from indepen-
dent firms has been way off the mark. You should judge whether or not to 
listen to analysts’ research based on how good the research has been in the 
past, not by whether it is independent or not. 
Keying into the main types 
of analyst research
Just as there are many types of books, there are many types of analyst 
research reports. As a fundamental analyst, there are two main types of 
reports you need to concern yourself primarily with, including: 
 
✓ Idea reports: Idea reports are usually lengthy pieces of research an 
analyst publishes to lay out everything investors need to know about 
the company, industry and the stock. These reports are often released 
when an analyst initiates coverage of a stock, or begins to regularly 

228
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
follow a company. Some analysts often publish idea reports every year, 
where they take a comprehensive look at the just-completed year for the 
company and forecast what might happen next year. These idea reports 
are usually chock full of industry statistics, which might come in handy 
when you dig into how to do industry analysis in Chapter 16. 
 
 Idea reports can be excellent ways for fundamental analysts to get up to 
speed on a company or industry they hadn’t been aware of before. 
 
✓ Maintenance reports: If idea reports are long and comprehensive, main-
tenance reports are just the opposite. Analysts usually dash out quick 
maintenance reports following major events at a company, such as the 
release of earnings or the announcement of a significant new product. 
 
 Maintenance reports are kind of like an episode of a soap opera: Unless 
you’ve been following along (and reading earlier reports) you might not 
be able to follow what’s going on in a just-released maintenance report. 
It can be a good idea to review an analyst’s idea report on a company 
along with the maintenance report. 
How to read between the lines 
of an analyst report
After you determine whether or not a research report is an idea or main-
tenance report, it’s time to start reading more closely. Since I urged you to 
essentially ignore the stock rating on most research reports, you might be 
wondering what you’re supposed to pay attention to instead in the report. 
Some of the key pieces of data you should be on the lookout for in an analyst 
report include: 
 
✓ Savvy comparisons of a company to its peers: Analysts most frequently 
will be assigned to cover an entire industry, including both the large stal-
warts in the business and the small up-and-comers. Sometimes analysts 
are able to pinpoint a company’s strengths and weaknesses that aren’t 
readily apparent from studying the financial statements. 
 
✓ Deep analysis of demand for a company’s products: The better ana-
lysts perform what are called channel checks. In a channel check, an ana-
lyst will call up a company’s customers and suppliers to see how well a 
particular product is flowing through the distribution channel. Analysts 
might find out, for instance, that retailers are slashing prices on a com-
pany’s products just to clear them off the shelves. That’s not a good 
sign. On the contrary, a supplier might say a company is ordering a great 
deal of raw materials, which could indicate the company is ramping up 
production. 

229
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
 
✓ Forecast for long-term growth: One of the most difficult aspects of fun-
damental analysis is getting a realistic expectation for the future. I’ll give 
you some pointers on how to estimate a company’s expected growth rate 
for the next five years in Chapter 17. But it’s not a bad idea to check ana-
lyst research reports to see what five-year growth forecasts they have. 
 
✓ Exploration of a stock’s valuation: Understanding how to measure 
whether a stock is cheap or expensive is one of the top things investors 
try to do. There are many ways to attempt measuring a stock’s valua-
tion, including looking at price-to-earnings ratios (Chapter 8) and per-
forming the discounted cash flow analysis (Chapter 11). Both of these 
analyses, though, are subject to numerous assumptions and educated 
guesswork. 
 
 Sometimes it can be helpful for you, then, to examine the valuation 
assumptions and results determined by professional analysts. Even if 
the results don’t agree with your findings, you can compare what they 
measured to what you measured, see why there’s a difference and adjust 
your model if needed. 
 
If you’re looking for help with the discounted cash flow model, stock reports 
from Standard & Poor’s can be useful. A vast majority of the stock reports from 
S&P, which can be obtained using the directions I’ll give you below, provide the 
stock’s discount rate and terminal growth rate. The discount rate is the rate of 
return investors demand in exchange for putting their money at risk by giving 
it to the company. And the terminal growth rate is how much the company’s 
earnings and cash flow are expected to grow in the very long term. Both the 
discount rate and terminal growth rate can have a major effect on the results of 
the DCF analysis, and both are somewhat difficult to calculate yourself. 
 
Analyst research reports can be very helpful when their insights help you 
tweak your own fundamental analysis for the better. But, there’s an ugly under-
side to analyst reports, too, especially when the authors are cheerleading or 
touting a stock. It can be difficult, until it’s too late, to know when an analyst 
report is being more promotional than insightful. A few things to watch out 
for, though, include reports that attempt to say recent bad news isn’t that ter-
rible, without justification. Also, be suspect of analyst reports that try to say a 
company is so well-managed or well-positioned that it’s not subject to the ups 
and downs of the economy. As you’ll discover in Chapter 15, all companies are 
subject to the typical ebb and tide of the broad economy. 
Getting your hands on analyst reports
By now you’re probably tired of reading about analyst reports and ready to 
get your hands on some. Accessing analyst reports is very easy, and may 

230
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
even be free depending on which brokerage firm you use. There are four 
primary ways to get analysts reports, including: 
 
✓ Your brokerage firm: If you’re a client of the big Wall Street firms, one of 
the perks you receive is access to the firm’s analysts’ reports. You might 
be able to access the reports yourself, or you may be able to ask your 
individual broker for a copy. 
 
 What if you’re with a low-cost online discount broker? You’re still in luck. 
A vast majority of the online brokerage firms provide you with research 
from both the Wall Street firms and from independent research firms. 
Charles Schwab, for instance, provides access to S&P research reports, 
as well as access to its own quantitative research model called Schwab 
Equity Ratings. 
 
✓ Directly from research providers: Most boutique research firms and 
even the larger independent research providers will sell their research 
to you. You can buy S&P’s stock research reports, for about $35, from 
this Web site: www.sandp.ecnext.com/coms2/page_industry2.
 
✓ Research resellers: A number of companies have created Web sites that 
let you shop for and order a variety of analyst research reports. Both 
Reuters and Yahoo Finance, for instance, allow you to enter a stock’s 
ticker symbol to see what analyst research is available and purchase 
it if you choose to. Reuters provides its analyst-report bazaar here, 
https://commerce.us.reuters.com/purchase/default.do, and 
Yahoo Finance offers reports for sale here: http://screen.yahoo.
com/reports.html. Most reports cost between $10 and $100, but they 
can be free or cost more. 
 
✓ Analyst research summary Web sites. Several Web sites let you look 
at the high-level summaries of analyst reports. Most of these sites give 
you the average recommendation of all the investors who follow a stock, 
which may be more valuable than just the opinion of one analyst. For 
instance, MSN Money, at http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/
invsub/analyst/recomnd.asp lets you look up the breakdown in 
stock ratings for individual stocks. 
Interpreting Credit-Rating Agencies’ 
Reports For Fundamental Analysis
Stock investors commonly forget the fact that they’re not alone in bankrolling 
a company. Generally, companies obtain the cash they need to operate from 
both stock investors and bond investors. And while stock investors look at 
analyst research reports, bond investors pay even closer attention to credit-
rating agencies’ reports. 

231
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
Credit-rating agencies, including Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch 
Ratings, look at companies very differently than stock analysts do. The role 
of the credit-rating agencies is to access how capable companies are of repay-
ing the money they’ve borrowed by selling bonds. 
The role of reports issued by 
credit-rating agencies
If you’ve ever compared a credit-rating agency’s report with a stock analyst 
report, even for the same company, you might be surprised at how differ-
ent they are. Certainly, both the credit and stock reports will take a look at 
popular financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio and various interest 
coverage ratios, discussed in Chapter 8. 
But while stock analyst research reports try to help investors make money, 
the credit-rating agencies reports are primarily concerned with helping inves-
tors just get their money back, with interest. 
 
Bond investors are very different from stock investors. They are lending money 
to a company, and get no piece of the upside if the company does better than 
expected. Bond investors simply want to get their money back from the com-
pany that borrowed from them. And for that reason, credit analysts look at 
companies very differently than stock analysts do. For instance, credit analysts 
have very little interest in a company’s stock valuation. Bond investors don’t 
care if a stock is overvalued, as long as they get their money back. 
But while the credit-rating companies are serving a different investor, the 
bond holders, fundamental analysts interested in a company’s stock can ben-
efit from the reports. Some of the aspects of credit-rating agencies’ reports 
that might be especially valuable include: 
 
✓ The credit rating: The credit-rating agencies assign various letter grades 
to companies. These letter grades attempt to give investors a quick way 
to determine how likely it is for a company to repay its debt, or, on the 
contrary, to default or miss an interest payment. Table 14-2 summarizes 
the credit ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, and what they mean. 
 
 Just as you should never take too much stock in a stock analysts’ rating, 
you should also exercise discretion when looking at a company’s credit 
rating. Since the credit-rating agencies are paid by the companies to pro-
vide their ratings, there’s long been suspicion that credit ratings give com-
panies a great deal of leeway. It’s the analysis behind the rating, instead of 
just the rating itself, that has the most value for fundamental analysts.
 
✓ Analysis of how much and how often the company is borrowing: The 
credit-rating agencies take interest, and sometimes concern, when a com-
pany borrows more money by selling additional bonds. New bond issu-
ances are monitored and explored in most credit-rating agencies’ reports. 

232
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Risk assessment: While companies themselves pinpoint the risks facing 
their businesses in their annual reports, as described in Chapter 12, it’s 
often better to get this information from a credit-rating agency report. 
Bond investors are a pretty nervous bunch, since they’re petrified of 
not getting their money back. As a result, credit-rating agencies spend a 
great deal of time investigating things that could go wrong at a company 
instead of what could go right.

The death of the AAA-rated company 
Just as consumers have largely gone on a 
credit-binge since the 1980s, so too have com-
panies. The borrowing boom by companies is 
extremely evident in how the number of com-
panies with the coveted AAA credit rating has 
continued to dwindle. General Electric, which 
had its AAA rating from Standard & Poor’s 
since April 26, 1956, saw its credit rating get 
cut one notch to AA+ in March 2009. GE’s 
downgrade was a stunner, since it had the 
AAA rating longer than any currently operat-
ing company. 
After S&P took GE down a notch, only five 
U.S. non-financial firms were still rated AAA 
by S&P, including Automatic Data Processing, 
Microsoft, Pfizer, ExxonMobil and Johnson & 
Johnson. Table 14-3 shows how the number of 
AAA companies has been in free fall. 
There are many hypotheses on why AAA-rated 
companies are vanishing. Perhaps one of the 
best explanations for a fundamental analyst is 
how companies have increasingly elected to 
borrow more, or leverage themselves up. By 
using more borrowed money, companies can 
increase how profitable they appear to inves-
tors who study return on equity. You can find 
out how a company can use debt to goose its 
profitability in Chapter 8.

Getting your hands on the credit rating 
If you thought getting stock analyst reports was convoluted, that was simple 
compared with getting a credit-rating agency’s report. Generally speaking, you’ll 
need to contact your broker directly to get a copy of the credit-rating report. 
However, there are some online resources that will help you get what you 
need from the reports, including the: 
 
✓ Credit-rating agencies’ sites: Both Moody’s site, www.moodys.com and 
S&P’s site, www.standardandpoors.com will let you look up the rating 
on most stocks for free. You just need to register, which is free. If you 
need the full reports, you’ll need to contact the agencies yourself. 
 
 Both Moody’s and S&P provide free access to some of their broader 
analysis on trends in the credit market. These reports can be helpful 
with fundamental analysis of stocks, too, since they pinpoint many of 
the concerns bond investors have with the economy in general. 
 
✓ Media reports: Most major news outlets have real-time access to the 
credit-rating agencies’ full reports and routinely issue stories on them. 
News outlets also have access to personnel at the rating agencies and 
can ask questions that go beyond what’s contained in the reports. For 
instance, when GE’s credit rating was cut by S&P, there were many 
media reports providing a summary of the key information in the report. 
If you want to review how to use news reports to bolster your fundamen-
tal analysis, flip back to Chapter 13.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Knowing when a company’s 
credit rating is suspect
It’s never a good idea to take any analyst’s report on a company as fact. 
Analyst reports are based on a heavy dose of estimation. But when it comes 
to credit-rating agencies’ reports, and credit ratings, there’s a good way to 
know when bond investors themselves don’t believe what they see. 
 
Companies’ debt, including their bonds, trade during the day just like stocks. 
Just as stock investors buy and sell shares all day, bond investors buy and sell 
companies’ debt securities. The constant back-and-forth determines the price 
of bonds, just as trading determines a stock’s price. 
Savvy fundamental analysts know how to check the price of a company’s debt 
and compare that to the prices of debt issued by other companies with similar 
credit ratings. If the prices on a company’s bonds are dramatically lower than 
those on debt issued by companies with the same credit ratings, fundamental 
analysts know investors think the company’s credit rating is too high. 
 
If you’re investing in a company’s stock, why should you care if its debt rating 
is too high? If a credit-rating agency ultimately decides to lower the credit 
rating on a company, or downgrade it, that could potentially increase the 
company’s borrowing costs in the future. And higher borrowing costs could 
increase a company’s interest expense and decrease its net profit in the future. 
And net profit, as you discovered in Chapter 5, is critically important to funda-
mental analysts. 
There are several ways to see how a company’s bonds are trading to deter-
mine if investors think the credit rating might fall. 
 
One method to see if bond investors trust the credit ratings is to look up bond 
prices using the Web site, called TRACE, operated by the securities regulator 
called Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. You can enter any 
company’s name and see the prices on its bonds here: http://cxa.mar-
ketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter/Default.aspx.
 
A much easier way, though, to find out whether investors trust a credit rating 
is by using Moody’s own site. It’s free; you’ll just need to register. Below are 
step-by-step instructions on how to see if bond and stock investors agree or 
disagree with a credit rating: 
 
1. Log into moodys.com.
 
  You will just need to enter your username and password.
 
2. Search for the company’s rating.
 
  Change the “search by” pull-down option in the upper right-hand corner 
to “Ticker.” Enter the company’s ticker symbol and click the “go” option. 

235
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
 
3. Locate the company’s name. 
 
  Look through the list of company names until you find the one you’re inter-
ested in. If there’s a gold-colored icon to the right of the company’s name, 
continue to step 4. If not, the analysis is not available for this company. 
 
4. Hover your mouse arrow over the golden icon.
 
  When you do this, a small box titled “Market Implied Ratings” will pop up. 
 
5. Interpret the results. 
 
 The first line, called Moody’s Senior Unsecured or Equiv, will show you the 
official credit rating from Moody’s. For GE, that rating in early 2009 was 
Aaa, as Moody’s hadn’t yet downgraded the company’s debt as did S&P. 
 
 Below the line with the official credit rating, you’ll see a line called bond-
implied. This line tells you what bond investors think GE’s debt should 
be rated, based on the current price. That rating on GE was Baa in early 
March 2009.  Next, check out the “Equity-Implied” line. This line tells you 
what stock investors think the company’s credit rating should be, based 
on a methodology used by Moody’s. In early 2009, GE’s Equity-Implied 
rating was Ba. 
 
 Doing this analysis tells you that neither bond investors nor stock inves-
tors thought GE deserved the Aaa rating Moody’s was giving it in early 
March 2009. That’s crucial information for a fundamental analyst. And it 
was telling. Weeks later, on March 23, Moody’s cut its rating on GE’s debt 
to Aa.
Finding Fundamental Data about 
Companies Using Social Investing
Up to this point in this chapter, you’ve learned how to pick up fundamental 
analysis from professionals. The analysts who write both stock research 
reports and the reports that go with credit ratings tend to do this type of 
thing full-time. 
But there’s growing interest in using the so-called wisdom of crowds, or the 
collective opinion of a large group of investors and analysts, to learn more 
about companies and investments. The idea is that one analyst may make an 
incorrect assumption or may be influenced by bias. If you pool together the 
opinions of hundreds of analysts, consumers, and others interested in a com-
pany, though, the hope is the collective wisdom will be valuable. 
And that’s where social investing comes in. Social investing is the financial 
version of social networking sites, like Facebook, Linked In, and Windows 
Live Spaces. Just as social networking allows you to meet new people and 

236
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
share photos and ideas, social investing is an Internet-based way to connect 
with other investors and share ideas, including fundamental analysis.
The origins of social investing
Social investing traces its roots to the late 1990s with the rather primitive and 
crude concept of stock message boards. These online sites allowed investors 
to anonymously share ideas and hunches about stocks. When stock message 
boards started, they were a unique opportunity for investors to congregate 
and share ideas. 
However, the obvious problems with these stock message boards quickly 
turned them into the investing equivalent of locker room gossip. Touts, or 
investors who try to artificially promote a company, would talk up a com-
pany’s future with the hope of dumping their holdings at a profit to naïve 
investors. Likewise, shorts, or investors betting a company’s stock would fall, 
could easily spread false rumors about a company and try to drive the stock 
price down. 
 
Stock message boards are filled with all the things you, as a fundamental ana-
lyst, are trying to avoid. Rather than analysis based on fact, data and analysts, 
the boards are stocked with amateurs just trying to spread false rumors and 
baseless allegations about stocks. Such rumor-mongering in stock message 
boards is especially problematic with stocks that don’t trade on a major stock 
market exchange.
Social investing has since evolved quite a bit. Today, there are social net-
working sites, which I’ll discuss in a bit, that let you see actual trades make 
by other investors. These sites allow you to find other investors that have 
similar investing strategies, such as fundamental analysis, and trade notes 
and ideas. There are other types of social networking sites that compile the 
investment ideas of many other investors into a single report, which I’ll dis-
cuss in this section, too.
Why it might be worth paying 
attention to non-professionals
It might seem counterintuitive and even a little amateurish to pay any atten-
tion to what lay investors think about a stock. And that’s mostly true. But, as 
a fundamental analyst, you want to make sure you have examined a company 
and stock from every direction. And if a non-professional can direct you to a 
gap in your fundamental analysis, you might be better off as a result. 

237
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
Some of the areas where social investing may be worthwhile for a fundamental 
analyst include: 
 
✓ Local demand information: Some social networking sites allow investors 
to share potentially valuable information, such as how crowded a restau-
rant chain’s locations are in various cities or how busy a retailer’s stores 
are. This type of information, if reliable, may serve the same purpose as 
an analyst’s channel check. 
 
✓ Industry insight: Sometimes, investors who participate in social invest-
ing sites may work at companies that buy gear from a company you’re 
interested in. Their comments on the quality of a company’s products or 
demand for the products can be useful. 
 
✓ Employee’s dirty laundry: Sometimes, employees will log into social 
investing sites and provide data that may be helpful in fundamental 
analysis. For instance, between 1997 and 2001, there were more than 100 
posts on a stock message board about Enron, many that outlined poten-
tial problems at the firm, according to research from James Felton and 
Jongchai Kim in their article “Warnings from the Enron Message Board.” 
Some were startlingly prescient, including one in April 2001 that said 
Enron “is nothing more than a house of cards.” At the time of that post, 
most Wall Street analysts rated Enron a “buy” or “strong buy.” 
How to plug into social networking
Unlike financial statement analysis, getting started in social networking 
doesn’t require any training. You just log into a Web site and get started. A 
few types of stock message boards and social networking sites to consider 
include: 
 
✓ Stock message boards: The more popular stock message boards include 
those hosted by Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com), Raging Bull 
(ragingbull.quote.com) and Silicon Investor (siliconinvestor.
com). Again, these stock message boards are filled with misinformation, 
so it’s caveat emptor. 
 
✓ Broker-operated sites: Online discount brokerages TradeKing and 
Zecco.com are some of the leaders in allowing their members to share 
investing ideas with each other. What these sites offer, which make them 
more credible than stock message boards, is that you can see the actual 
holdings of the members. That way, if an investor is talking up a stock, 
you can see if the person owns or is buying the stock. You can also see 
how successful an investor that person is. 
 
✓ Compilation sites and dedicated social networking sites: Some sites try 
to spare you from having to read through thousands of messages posted 
by various members of social networking sites. For instance, if you enter

a stock symbol at USATODAY.com’s Money section (money.usatoday.
com), you’ll find a summary of fundamental analysis performed by other 
visitors of the site. 
Following the moves of big-time investors
If monitoring the fundamental analysis by amateur investors isn’t all that 
appealing, you might still be curious what the Warren Buffetts of the world 
are doing. 
Using financial documents, you can extend your fundamental analysis to 
find out what other famous investors are doing with their money. And yes, 
you can find out if a stock you’re interested in is owned by famous investors 
including Warren Buffett or well-known portfolio managers of mutual funds 
that use fundamental analysis.
Finding out who a company’s biggest investors are
Some companies list all the investors who have the biggest stakes in their 
companies in their 10-K, or annual report filing that’s required by regulators, 
as discussed in Chapter 12. Others may include the information in their proxy 
statement, discussed in Chapter 9. Both of those places are worth checking. 
But if nothing turns up, it’s time to find out about a regulatory filing called a 
13F-HR. Large institutional investors are required to file 13F-HR filings when 
they take significant stakes of publicly traded firms. 
 
Following 13F-HR filings from your favorite investors can be a great way to find 
out what kinds of stocks they are buying. Many investors make a pastime out 
of following Buffett’s investments, for instance, by watching the 13F-HR filings 
from his Berkshire Hathaway. 
You can access 13F-HR filings, for free, from the SEC’s IDEA database. You can 
find step-by-step directions on how to extract filings from IDEA in Chapter 4.
Following famous investors moves using Morningstar
Perhaps you’re interested in finding out what some of your favorite mutual 
fund managers, who use fundamental analysis, own. Maybe you’d rather not 
deal with navigating the SEC’s Web site to find out the moves of other funda-
mental analysts. 

239
 Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
 
Investment research company Morningstar makes it very easy to look up who 
the biggest owners of a stock are, as well as the largest investments by big 
money managers. 
To look up the largest owners of a stock, log onto Morningstar.com, enter the 
stock symbol of the company you’re interested in and click the Go button. On 
the left-hand side of the screen, click the Insider Trading option. Finally, click 
on the Concentrated Fund Owners tab at the top of the list to get details on 
the biggest owners of a stock. 
What if you want to find out what your favorite mutual fund manager owns? 
It’s the same basic procedure. Just enter the name of the mutual fund or 
enter the fund’s symbol at Morningstar.com and click the Go button. Next, 
click on the “Portfolio” option on the left-hand side of the screen. Lastly, click 
on the “Top 25 Holdings tab” at the top of the screen. 
 
Monitoring the buying and selling of stock by a company’s officers and directors 
can also be telling. You can read more about such legal insider trading, and 
how that can be incorporated into fundamental analysis, in Chapter 17.
When a CEO can’t resist social investing
Don’t assume the only people hanging out in 
stock message boards are frustrated stock 
analysts and investors. Back in the late 1990s, 
John Mackey, the co-founder and CEO of natu-
ral food store Whole Foods Market, started to 
post in the Yahoo Finance message board dedi-
cated to the company. But he didn’t announce, 
“Hi everyone, I’m the CEO.” Instead, Mackey 
responded to posts using the pseudonym 
rahodeb, or his wife’s name, Deborah, spelled 
backwards. Mackey’s comments ranged from 
responding to questions or critiques about the 
company to some critical comments about Wild 
Oats Market, a rival firm Whole Foods ended up 
buying. 
After Mackey’s posting were discovered, the 
matter was looked into by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. No punishment was 
recommended. But, since that time, Mackey, 
like many CEOs, maintains a blog on the com-
pany’s Web site to give his point of view on mat-
ters. Mackey’s blog is available here: www2.

Performing “Top Down” 
Fundamental Analysis
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing how the economy’s condition can be a factor in your fundamental analysis
▶ Understanding how the cycles of the economy play a role in a company’s profitability
▶ Analyzing and accessing key economic data released by the government
▶ Using “leading” economic indicators to help you gain a better idea of
a company’s future
E
ven the best company or investment can be tripped up by a lousy econ-
omy. This truth was demonstrated in brutal fashion during the stock 
market decline that began in 2007, as prices of all sorts of stocks were pun-
ished, with little regard to what fundamental analysis would tell you.
The harsh reality that companies are subject to the vagaries of the broad 
economy is a major reason why you may consider expanding your fundamental 
analysis skills beyond looking just at the health and prospects of individual 
companies. Understanding the ups and downs of the economy, and the 
resulting business cycle, is what’s known as top-down analysis. And top-down 
analysis is a critical adjunct to fundamental analysis, helping you make sure 
you’re investing in the right companies for the right price at a good time.
This chapter will show how the health of the broad economy is a factor in 
the health of individual companies. You’ll also discover how changes in the 
economy may cause you to tweak the way you apply fundamental analysis. 
I’ll show you what some of the most important pieces of economic data are 
and even how some, called leading indicators, may help forecast the future. 
Broadening Out Fundamental Analysis 
to Include Monitoring the Economy
There’s no question that with fundamental analysis, the primary goal is often 
to deeply understand the inner workings of individual companies. Investors 

242
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
who practice fundamental analysis are attempting to find those companies 
that stand to benefit the most given the current economic environment. 
 
It’s critical to recognize that changes in the economy may have big effects 
on companies and dramatically alter your fundamental analysis. A large eco-
nomic downturn, for instance, can cause a company’s revenue and earnings to 
plummet, turning all your expectations for the company upside down. 
How the economy has an overriding 
effect on a company
The recession that started in late 2007, as painful as it’s been, has provided a 
startling reminder to fundamental analysts of just how captive a company’s 
fundamentals are to the economy. 
When the economy slows down, and consumers and companies cut how 
much stuff they buy, companies’ financial statements take a direct hit. Less 
spending by consumers and businesses translates directly into less revenue 
and earnings for companies. And revenue and earnings are precisely the 
things that fundamental analysts spend their time looking at. 
Sometimes, a drop in business activity can be swift and vicious, as was the 
case in 2007 and 2008. Table 15-1 shows how the earnings per share of some 
members of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell by startling amounts in 2008 
as the recession ravaged the economy and their businesses.

 Chapter 15: Performing “Top-Down” Fundamental Analysis
Ways the economy can alter 
your fundamental analysis
Considering the economy’s health in your fundamental analysis might seem 
like a pretty daunting task. After all, how can you consider something as 
grand as the U.S.’ economic growth when you’re poring over one company’s 
financial statements? 
Still, it’s important to recognize that the economy can have big-time effects 
on business, especially in regard to a company’s: 
 
✓ Ability to service its debt: A company’s level of debt might look very 
manageable during normal economic times. In fact, as pointed out in 
Chapter 8, companies carrying a bit of debt will generate higher returns 
for stock investors. But that debt can come back to haunt companies 
when the economy slows. 
 
 It might be easier to understand how a poor economy can turn debt into 
poison for a company by thinking about a plain old mortgage. Let’s say a 
young couple making $50,000 a year takes on a $1,000-a-month mortgage 
payment. That’s really not too ridiculous. But if one breadwinner in the 
family loses a job, and the couple’s annual income falls to $25,000 a year, 
suddenly that mortgage payment is going to be a big nut to deal with 
When the economy tripped up Buffett 
It might be tempting to think your deft funda-
mental analysis skills are so bulletproof, you’ll 
be able to find stocks that defy gravity and do 
well even when the economy is lousy. And it’s 
true. There were a handful of stocks that rose 
even during 2008, when the S&P 500 index 
crashed 38.5%. 
But before you think your fundamental analy-
sis can lift you above the woes of the economy, 
consider that even Warren Buffett faced prob-
lems during 2008. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway 
posted a 9.6% drop in its book value, the com-
pany’s worst year in its history dating back to 
1965. Book value is the difference between the 
value of the company’s assets and liabilities, 
and the way Berkshire Hathaway investors 
tend to evaluate performance. 
And investors in Berkshire Hathaway’s stock 
weren’t spared, either. The value of Berkshire 
Hathaway stock fell 31.8% during 2008, as 
the per-share price of Berkshire Hathaway’s 
Class A stock dropped from $141,600 a share to 
$96,600. Ouch. 
Buffett, in his 2008 letter to shareholders, clearly 
explains how troubles in the broad economy 
can translate into a slowdown for businesses, 
even those with outstanding fundamentals. “By 
the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled 
with tumbling home and stock prices, had 
produced a paralyzing fear that engulfed the 
country. A free fall in business activity ensured, 
accelerating at a pace that I have never before 
witnessed.” Well said.

244
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
every month. The same concept goes for a company. If the economy 
causes net income to fall, what had been a manageable level of debt 
might become pretty difficult to handle going forward. 
 
 Capacity to borrow: During the credit crunch, which intensified in 
2008, many companies were no longer able to borrow at favorable inter-
est rates or to borrow at all. That unavailability of capital caused many 
companies to have to finance, or pay for, their expenses and needed 
improvements out of their cash balances. What if they didn’t have much 
cash? Welcome to bankruptcy court. 
 
 During severe economic contractions, the companies with access to large 
sums of cash are often able to make moves to improve their position 
when the economy ultimately heals. Some companies, for instance, may 
use their cash to buy weaker competitors, giving them greater market 
share when the economy improves. 
 
✓ Cost structure: Some companies are able to adjust their costs and 
expenses rapidly during a downturn, unfortunately, usually by laying off 
workers. Yet other companies, which are capital intensive or reliant on 
large and expensive facilities, may have a more difficult time reducing 
their overhead costs. Closing a plant or facility may take longer than just 
giving a bunch of workers pink slips. 
 
✓ Reliance on a strong economy: Some industries are more subject to 
the health of the economy. For instance, companies that make durable 
consumer goods such as homes, appliances and automobiles, usually 
see the largest drop-off in business as spending on such big-ticket items 
cools. Companies with profits that are closely tied to the economy are 
described as being cyclical. The concept of cyclicality in business will be 
discussed at more length in Chapter 16. 
How interest rates can alter 
what companies are worth
The condition the economy is in can have profound effects on how much a 
company — or its stock — is worth. As shown above, companies’ earnings 
and cash flow may be held hostage by the ups and downs of the economy. 
Valuations of companies are based in large part on how profitable a company 
is, as you found out in Chapter 5. 
But there’s another factor you need to be aware of when it comes to incorpo-
rating the economy’s health into fundamental analysis: interest rates. Perhaps 
you’ve puzzled over why stocks often jump when the Federal Reserve, or the 
nation’s central bank, reduces short-term interest rates. If the reduction in short-
term interest rates, or the rates banks usually charge each other to borrow 

245
 Chapter 15: Performing “Top-Down” Fundamental Analysis
money overnight, prompts interest rates on longer-term loans to fall, that can 
affect how much companies are worth. 
 
Most people assume lower interest rates are good for stocks because the 
companies can borrow money at a more affordable rate. And that is true. 
Lower interest rates may reduce a company’s interest expense, and boost 
profit. Companies might also borrow more money to expand their operations 
or build new stores, which might increase future profits. 
But fundamental analysis shows a more sophisticated reason why interest-
rate changes affect the value of stocks. Remember that one way to measure 
the value of a stock is the discounted cash flow model, or DCM, which is cov-
ered in detail in Chapter 11. 
If you recall, the value of a stock today, or its present value, is a function of its 
expected future cash flows in today’s dollars. Go ahead. Read that sentence 
one more time; I won’t mind. Believe it or not, it’s easiest to explain why inter-
est rates are critical in fundamental analysis using the formula you discov-
ered in Chapter 11. It looks like this: 
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time
If you haven’t read Chapter 11 yet, some of the explanation of interest rates 
might seem pretty technical. If you read Chapter 11, that will help, I promise. 
Imagine that you invest in a company you know will generate $10,000 in cash 
20 years from now. And consider for a moment that interest rates on savings 
accounts are 5%. That means you might reasonably demand an 8% return in 
exchange for investing your hard-earned cash in the company. The present 
value of the company is $2,145 right now, using a formula that looks like this: 
Present value ($2,145) = $10,000 / (1+0.08) ^ 20
Now imagine the economy starts to sputter, and the Federal Reserve cuts 
interest rates. The interest rate for money in a savings account falls to 1%. 
You might now demand a return of 4% on your money invested in the com-
pany. Just this one seemingly small change in interest rates makes the com-
pany worth $4,564, or more than double its value when interest rates were 
higher. 
Be careful not to confuse the short-term interest rates set by the Federal 
Reserve with long-term interest rates set by investors and lenders. While 
short-term interest rates affect long-term interest rates, they don’t always 
move in lockstep.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Analyzing the Key Measures 
of the Economy’s Health
When it comes to analyzing a company, you can zero in pretty precisely. 
Companies’ financial statements allow you to dig into a company’s operations 
and get a good idea of what’s going on. 
But when it comes to the economy, where can you start? After all, when 
analyzing the economy, you’re not just examining the performance of a single 
company, but scores of businesses, consumers, and many other variables. 
And that’s why you might think of the economy as a lab specimen. Doctors, 
trying to understand the creature, might put probes and sensors all over the 
specimen to try to get in tune with its vitals. Economists and investors, too, 
try to closely monitor the economy’s health by tracking a variety of indica-
tors that all reveal clues. 
Being aware of the business cycle
Booms are inevitably followed by busts. After things get so bad, smart com-
panies and entrepreneurs inevitably launch new ideas, and the economy gets 
going again before it overheats all over. This constant boom-to-bust is char-
acteristic of the capitalist system, and is called the business cycle. It makes 
things interesting, don’t you think? 
Fundamental analysts generally break the business cycle down into five 
primary phases, including: 
 
✓ Expansion: At this point, the economy is starting to pick up steam. 
Economic activity is heating up, perhaps following a recession, and 
sometimes powered by lower interest rates. 
 
✓ Peak: The economy is running at full tilt. Hotels and airplanes are full. 
Companies are pumping out as much product as they can handle. 
 
✓ Contraction: Uh oh. Business activity begins to slow from the unsustain-
able peak levels, due to some negative event. Companies begin slash-
ing costs, often by laying off workers. In 2007, business activity began 
to slow down after lending to home buyers started to slow and home 
prices fell, making consumers feel poorer. 
 
✓ Trough: When it seems like there’s bad news about the economy and 
things are only getting worse, the economy may have hit rock bottom. 
 
✓ Recovery: Eventually, demand hits bottom, and consumers and busi-
nesses start spending. Improved demand for products allows companies 
to hire back workers and increase production. And so the cycle starts all 
over again. 

247
 Chapter 15: Performing “Top-Down” Fundamental Analysis
Using government statistics to track 
the economy’s movements
When it comes to economic statistics, sadly, there isn’t a single number or even 
source that will give you everything you need to know. Until an economist starts 
Economic Indicators ‘R Us, it’s up to you, as a fundamental analyst, to know 
which economic data are important and where to get them. Below is a checklist 
of some of the important measures of economic activity, or economic indicators, 
you’ll want to be aware of. 
 
✓ Gross domestic product, or GDP: GDP is arguably the most popular mea-
sure of a country’s economy. GDP measures how much action an economy 
has going on by tallying up the amount of consumption, investment, gov-
ernment spending and difference between exports and imports within a 
nation’s borders. The GDP of the U.S. is available from the U.S. Department 
of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis at www.bea.gov.
 
✓ Inflation: Have your grandparents ever told you how they were able to 
buy a carton of milk for a penny? The reason that carton of milk now 
costs $1 or more is inflation, or rising prices. Inflation is critical to fun-
damental analysis since it is connected to interest rates. For instance, if 
inflation starts rising uncontrollably, the Federal Reserve may need to 
increase short-term interest rates to slow down demand, which could 
hurt the value of companies. 
 
 Key measures of inflation include the Consumer Price Index, Producer 
Price Index, and wages. Those measures track how much prices of 
It’s not a recession until NBER says so 
How do you know if the economy is in a reces-
sion or worse? The old rule of thumb was if your 
neighbor was out of a job, the economy was in 
a recession, and if you were out of work, it was 
a depression. Fundamental analysts, though, 
need a better indication. 
And that’s where the National Bureau of 
Economic Research, or NBER, comes in. The 
NBER is a private and nonprofit organization, 
founded in 1920, that researches the health 
of the economy. One of the NBER’s roles is 
to officially pronounce when a recession 
begins and ends. You can see when every U.S. 
business expansion and contraction started 
here: http://wwwdev.nber.org/
cycles/cyclesmain.html.
While the NBER is extremely helpful, it has its 
limits. One of the biggest criticisms is that the 
NBER doesn’t officially pronounce the begin-
ning of a recession until the economy has been 
contracting for some time. For instance, the 
NBER didn’t determine that December 2007 was 
the peak in economic activity until November 
2008. Gee, thanks guys. And that’s why, as a fun-
damental analyst, you can’t rely solely on the 
NBER to signal when tough times are coming. 

248
Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
consumer goods, industrial goods, and employee wages are rising. 
Deflation occurs when prices fall. Each of these measures is available from 
the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics at stats.bls.gov. 
 
✓ Interest rates: You’ll want to keep at least one eye on interest rates at all 
times while performing your fundamental analysis. The Federal Reserve 
lets you see where short-term interest rates are, based on the intended fed-
eral funds rate, at www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm.
 
✓ Regional economic activity: Sometimes it can be useful to see which 
parts of the country are doing better — or worse — than others. That 
type of regional economic activity is provided by the Federal Reserve in 
its Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions, commonly 
known as the Beige Book. You may access these reports here: www.
federalreserve.gov/FOMC/BeigeBook/2009/.
Getting a Jump on the Future Using 
Leading Economic Indicators 
While fundamental analysts may appreciate the value of economic indicators, 
there’s a major problem. Nearly all economic indicators are backward-looking, 
meaning that they reflect what has happened, rather than what is likely to 
happen in the future. Successful fundamental analysis is all about accurately 
forecasting what might happen to a company’s profits and revenue over the 
next years to decades. You’ll want to pay close attention to leading economic 
indicators, or those that are more revealing about how the economy might 
look in the future. 
Paying attention to the Conference 
Board Leading Economic Index
Trying to figure out what’s wrong with the economy is kind of like determin-
ing why a baby is sick. You might know the baby isn’t well, judging by a 
103-degree fever, but it’s not like you can ask what hurts and get a coherent 
answer. 
Similarly, determining what ails the economy, or trickier yet, what might 
make it sick in the future, is equally problematic. The economy may show 
signs of illness, with weakness in many of the indicators discussed above, but 
it can be difficult to pinpoint the source of the issues. 
 
Don’t feel bad if you’re not very good at predicting when the economy is fall-
ing apart or when it’s improving. Even leading economists routinely make bad 
forecasts about the economy’s direction.

249
 Chapter 15: Performing “Top-Down” Fundamental Analysis
The Conference Board Leading Economic Index attempts to give everyone a 
way to see what’s hurting the economy and whether or not things are getting 
better or worse. The indicator gets a forward-looking read on the economy 
by examining the following 10 factors:
 
✓ Real money supply: The number of dollars in the economic system ready 
to be lent and spent. Money supply is kind of like the lubrication of the 
economy. Money supply serves the same role as motor oil in a car engine. 
 
✓ Interest-rate spread: This measures how costly it is to borrow money. 
When consumers and businesses can borrow at an affordable rate, eco-
nomic activity tends to pick up. 
 
✓ Consumer expectations: When consumers are worried about their jobs and 
financial futures, they cut their spending. That slows down the economy. 
 
✓ Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods: If companies 
are feeling better about the future, they may purchase new equipment 
and plan to expand. 
 
✓ Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials: 
Companies ramping up production need to buy more ingredients to feed 
into their factories. 
 
✓ Average weekly initial claims for unemployment: Companies slash 
jobs when they don’t see economic activity getting better. Plus, more 
people out of work means fewer consumers to buy goods and services. 
 
✓ Building permits: Companies must get permits to construct new proper-
ties, so a slowdown in permits indicates a less bullish view of the future. 
 
✓ Average weekly manufacturing hours: Large manufacturers may ask 
workers to cut back their hours if they need to trim costs or have 
employees work overtime if they expect a boom in demand. 
 
✓ Stock prices: Investors will generally start buying stocks if they expect 
the economy to recover within six months or so. Watching the stock 
market’s moves is such a valuable, early predictor of economic cycles. 
I’ll discuss it more fully below.
 
✓ Index of supplier deliveries: One of the first things companies do when 
they expect things to get better is place orders with their vendors. 
 
The Conference Board makes its Leading Economic Index available for free, as a 
press release, here: http://www.conference-board.org/economics/bci.

Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Using the stock market as your 
economic early warning system
If you’re looking for an early tip-off to when the economy is either headed 
for the toilet or about to improve, it’s tough to beat the stock market. Since 
investors are always looking to the future, traditionally, the stock market 
will signal roughly three to six months ahead of time, in what direction the 
economy will head. 
 
Again, the stock market demonstrated its predictive power in 2007. The 
Standard & Poor’s 500 set its bull-market peak on October 2007, and started 
sliding dramatically from that point. Investors who noticed the stock market 
topped in October 2007 were tipped off that the economy was struggling more 
than a year before the NBER made the formal announcement. 
If you’re interested in finding out more about using the stock market indexes 
to help you see where the economy is headed, check out Chapter 19, where I 
go over the techniques used by technical analysts.

Analysis

In this part . . .

fter you study more companies, you’ll get more profi-
cient and start looking for ways to take fundamental 
analysis to the next level. This part covers some of the more 
advanced aspects of fundamental analysis worth taking a 
look at once you’re comfortable with the basics. I show you 
how important it is to understand a company’s industry and 
how to spot trends developing in a company’s business. 
Because often the way to be a good investor is by sidestep-
ping financial land mines, I show you how to spot companies 
with danger signs that are worth noting.

I
f you want to know what your kids are up to at school, just look at their 
friends and you’ll get a pretty good idea. It’s also common for employees 
at a company to adopt similar behavior, called corporate culture. 
As strange as it might sound, you can learn quite a bit about companies, too, 
by examining what other companies they’re lumped in with. Oftentimes, com-
panies in the same line of work, or industry, have similar financial character-
istics and idiosyncrasies. The industry a company is in can also contribute to 
its stock price performance. 
Understanding what kind of company a company keeps is an important piece 
of the fundamental analysis puzzle. While you may understand an individual 
company by reviewing its financial statements, it’s vital to understand the 
environment that company operates in and the industry dynamics at work. 
You’ll discover the ins and outs of industry analysis in this chapter. Not only 
will you see how a company’s industry can influence its value, but you’ll also 
see how a company’s fortunes may rise and fall along with the business cycle. 
Another key aspect of industry analysis is determining how well a company is 
doing relative to its peers. And the crucial topic of market share is discussed, 
as it shows how smaller companies can benefit if they can successfully steal 
away business from their larger and more entrenched rivals. 

254
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Realizing How a Company’s Industry 
Can Influence Its Value
The rise and fall of companies and industries follows a pretty standard script. 
Generally, things kick off when entrepreneurs get frustrated with the prod-
ucts that don’t seem to fit some kind of need they might have. By tinkering 
on the kitchen table or in the garage, these entrepreneurs may create a proto-
type of a product and often literally sell them out of the back of their cars. 
Before you know it, this little company grows and, for whatever reason, the 
product might get so popular it threatens the survival of the companies that 
sold the undesirable products in the first place. Entire industries are born, and 
sometimes destroyed, by this constant upheaval in our economic system. 
 
You want to be aware when a company you’re investing in might be threatened 
by a game-changing company or new technology. Almost overnight, all the rev-
enue and earnings on the financial statements might not be meaningful if the 
business model, or way the company makes its money, is turned upside down. 
The constant assault against established industries is part of our capitalist 
system. Remember air travel threatened railroads, personal computers 
threatened large mainframe systems used in business, and the Internet is an 
attack on traditional media. The battle for companies, and entire industries, 
to remain relevant in light of new ways of doing things is something you need 
to account for in your fundamental analysis. 
The rise and fall of industries
One of the biggest threats to fundamental analy-
sis is the constant danger someone will come 
along with a groundbreaking new business that 
threatens the old way of making money in the 
industry. One of the classic examples of this is 
what has happened in photography. Eastman 
Kodak became a blue chip company, thanks to 
its dominance of photography, which relied on 
costly chemical processing and film. Rivals that 
tried to take on Eastman Kodak had difficulty 
competing. 
But in the early 1990s, Kodak saw its industry 
get turned virtually upside down. Suddenly, 
giant consumer electronics firms elbowed 
their way into the photography business with 
digital technology. At first, the photo qual-
ity of digital cameras was very poor. But that 
quickly changed and by 2008, 65% of U.S. 
households had at least one digital camera. 
Chemical camera sales became just a sliver of 
the market. Suddenly Kodak faced dozens of 
new competitors, such as Sony and Casio, it 
had never faced before. 

255
 Chapter 16: Digging into an Industry’s Fundamentals
What’s in an industry? 
If you tell someone in Los Angeles you’re in “the industry” they might assume 
you’re in the movie business and try to get you to look at their script. In 
Detroit, people in the Motor City industry are involved in making cars. 
But when it comes to fundamental analysis, the term industry has a pretty 
precise meaning. At its most basic level, a company’s industry is the line of 
work it’s in. But that’s not a scientific enough definition for fundamental 
analysts; they’re pretty precise folks, if you haven’t noticed already. 
Instead of just saying, for instance, Ford is in the auto industry, fundamental 
analysts break things down into more detail. Most fundamental analysts use 
a classification standard called the Global Industry Classification Standard, 
or GICS, to put companies into their places. GICS puts every industry into 
a sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry. GICS was co-created by 
Standard & Poor’s and MSCI Barra, two companies that specialize in creating 
ways to classify companies. 
If you’ve ever seen Russian nesting dolls, or matryoshka dolls, you already 
know exactly how GICS works. The sector is the largest classification, inside 
of which fit the industry group, industry and sub-industry. Just as you open 
the largest Russian nesting doll and find a smaller one and so forth, the same 
goes with GICS. Once you see what sector a company is in, you can then see 
which industry group, industry and sub-industry it’s in. All these classifica-
tions fit neatly inside of each other. 
Ford is a good example of how all this GICS stuff works. The company falls into 
the Consumer Discretionary sector, which contains all sorts of industry groups 
that make big-ticket items consumers buy, such as consumer durables. Digging 
further, you find Ford goes into the Automobiles & Components industry 
group, which contains the auto components and automaking industries. Next, 
Ford fits into the Automobiles industry, which includes two sub-industries: 
automobile manufacturers and motorcycle manufacturers. And Ford makes 
cars and trucks, so it goes into the Automobile Manufacturers sub-industry.
The GICS system is pretty comprehensive. Table 16-1 shows you how many 
sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries there are.

Just as scientists periodically change their classifications to make room for 
new developments regarding heavenly bodies, the same goes for industries. 
I’m still shocked scientists stripped away the planet title from Pluto in 2006. 
The GICS changes a little over time, too. Sometimes industries, for instance, are 
added, deleted or merged to reflect changes in the economy. Sometimes indi-
vidual companies, too, are moved from different industries or sub-industries. 
 
It’s probably easiest to see how all these GICS sectors, industry groups, 
industries and sub-industries fit together by looking at a table. There are liter-
ally thousands of sub-industries, but Table 16-2 gives you a very small sum-
mary of what the basic structure of the GICS looks like.

Following the ups and downs of industries
Just as the economy expands and contracts along with the business cycle 
as discussed in Chapter 15, industries also have their ups and downs. Some 
sectors, for instance, tend to see their business rise and fall along with the 
economy. These are called cyclical companies, and includes industries such 
as the automakers. Then there are sectors that tend to be noncyclical, mean-
ing that their performance tend to not be all that connected to the economy’s 
shape. The health care industry is a good example of a sector that’s usually 
noncyclical. 
 
Some fundamental analysts use industry analysis to clue into what point of the 
business cycle the economy is in. By paying attention to which industries (or 
sectors) are posting the best results, or the strongest stock prices, you can get 
a hint as to where the economy is head. 
You can see how different sectors and stocks tend to outperform during the 
different parts of the business cycle in Table 16-3.

You can review the different phases of the business cycle in Chapter 15. 
How to Track How Sectors Are Doing
If you want to find out how an individual company or its stock is doing, it’s 
relatively simple. A company’s financial statements, as described in Chapter 4, 
can be dug out pretty easily. And you can get stock quotes on just about any 
company from your brokerage firm or from financial Web sites. 
But what if you want to know which sector is leading the economy or stock 
market? That’s what I’ll show you next. 
Keeping tabs on a sectors’ fundamentals
If you wanted to tally up how companies in a sector are doing, you could, in 
theory, do it by hand. You could get a list of all the companies in a sector and 
open each company’s financial statements and add everything up. But, man, 
that would be a great deal of work you can avoid. 
It’s much easier to get fundamental data on sectors from companies that track 
these types of things very closely. S&P is one of the companies with massive 
databases dedicated to tracking all the earnings reported by companies and 
compiling them into a resource you, as a fundamental analyst, may use. All 
the earnings for the companies in all 10 sectors are compiled and provided to 
you here: http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/

 Chapter 16: Digging into an Industry’s Fundamentals
You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can process the sector data from hun-
dreds of companies using the S&P’s data. For instance, you can not only see 
how quickly earnings in the 10 sectors rose or fell in the past couple of years, 
but you can also monitor how rapidly analysts expect the sectors’ earnings 
to rise or fall in the future. S&P also provides data showing the average price-
to-earnings ratio of companies in the sector. You can review how to interpret 
the P-E ratio in Chapter 8. Some of the sector data you can obtain from S&P 
looks like what you see in Table 16-4:

When evaluating the profit and growth of individual companies, as discussed 
in Chapter 5, it’s a good idea to compare the results to that of the sector. This 
might help you identify companies that are pulling ahead of their peers. 
Tracking the stock performances of sectors
Studying sectors’ fundamentals, such as earnings growth, is just one part 
of industry analysis. To get a full picture of how the sectors are faring, it’s 
important, too, to monitor their stock price changes.

Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
 
The stock market can give you an early signal to where the economy is headed 
three to six months in the future, as shown in Chapter 15. You can apply the 
market’s same early-warning signal to industry analysis. When you start to see 
stocks in a sector rising or falling, for instance, that tells you investors think 
the sector’s fundamentals will follow. 
If you really want to keep yourself busy an entire weekend, you could get 
price quotes for every stock in a sector. But why go to all that trouble if 
someone else makes it so easy? There are a few sources that provide helpful 
industry performance data, including:

provides the performance of all 10 of its sector indexes on a daily, 
monthly, quarterly and year-to-date basis. You can download the data

Using exchange-traded funds to 
monitor sectors and industries
Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are one of the more exciting things to happen 
to the investment business. Investors who want to invest in a basket of 
stocks, for instance, can buy just one ETF and spread their money over 
dozens, hundreds or even thousands of individual stocks. 
But what do ETFs have to do with fundamental analysis? ETFs are excellent 
tools to get real-time information on industries and sectors. Since most ETFs 
track various stock indexes, or mathematical calculations that measure the 
value of a group of stocks, they can be tremendously useful when tracking 
industries, too. 
The beauty of using ETFs as a way to see how a sector or industry is doing is 
that you can get real-time stock quotes on ETFs as you would with any stock. 
Just enter the ETF’s stock symbol into a financial Web site to get a price. The 
prices of ETFs show you how sectors are doing. Many financial Web sites will

also provide fundamental details about the ETF, giving you a deeper look at 
how things are going in the industry. Table 16-5 lists some ETFs that track all 10 
sectors.

Adding Industry Analysis to Your 
Fundamental Approach
You may have hated it when teachers announced, on the first day of class, 
that they were planning to use the dreaded curve. The curve is pretty brutal, 
since getting a 90% on a test doesn’t automatically mean you get an A. If half 
the class gets a 90% too, you could very well end up with a C. 
The same curve-like mentality applies in industry analysis. Sometimes it’s not 
good enough for a company to post strong revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
If the rest of the industry is doing just as well or better, even a seemingly out-
standing performance by a company may not be impressive. 
Companies cannot be analyzed in isolation, but rather, relative to their peers. 

262
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Sizing up a company’s financials 
relative to its industry’s
Whenever you look up a piece of financial data, the first thing that should 
pop into your head as a fundamental analyst is “what does this mean?” 
Generally, no single piece of financial data is meaningful by itself. Financial 
ratios, covered in Chapter 8, are especially irrelevant by themselves. 
Traditionally, fundamental analysis requires you to either compare a com-
pany’s financial data with its historical results or against other companies in 
the sector or industry. 
Virtually any piece of financial data you can extract from the financial state-
ments can be compared against other companies in an industry. You can 
also compare financial data to industry averages to give you a better idea of 
where a company stands in its respective field. 
Comparing a stock’s valuation, or measure of how pricey or cheap it is com-
pared to its fundamentals, is one of the easiest things for investors to do. 
After you measure a stock’s P-E, you can then compare the P-E against the 
valuation of the industry or the stock market to get an idea of how richly 
valued a stock is. 
You can even evaluate statements made by a company’s management using 
industry analysis. Here’s an example. For many years, Dell Computer often 
talked about just how efficient its factories were. Industry analysis lets you 
see if the company’s claims are true. 
 
One way to verify a company’s efficiency is by comparing its inventory turn-
over in days, or how rapidly a company clears out inventory from its ware-
houses, to the industry. A more efficient production system would have a 
rapid turnover, so the inventory turnover in days should be a small number. 
The formula is: 
Inventory turnover in days = Average inventory / cost of goods sold * 365
Dell in 2008 churned through its inventory every 7.5 days. You know that 
because inventory turnover in days is: 
7.5 = Average inventory ($1,024) / cost of goods sold ($50,144) * 365
How does Dell’s inventory turnover in days compare with the industry? It’s 
excellent. The computer hardware industry turns over its inventory every 
34 days using 2008 data, according to Thomson Reuters. So it seems Michael 
Dell does know a thing about running a tight ship. 
You don’t have to calculate the financial ratios for all the companies in a 
sector to get a comparison basis. Thomson Reuters provides industry data 

263
 Chapter 16: Digging into an Industry’s Fundamentals
for you at www.reuters.com/finance/stocks. All you need to do is enter 
the stock symbol of the company you’re studying, select the Ratios button 
and click the Go! button. 
One thing to keep in mind, though, is sometimes you need to convert 
industry ratios generated by systems like Thomson Reuters to match your 
calculation method. For instance, Thomson Reuters doesn’t convert inven-
tory turnover in days, as I did above. For the computer hardware industry, 
Thomson Reuters gives a turnover rate of 10.69 for the industry. To convert 
that into inventory turnover in days, just divide 360 by 10.69 to convert the 
industry number into days. 
Find out who a company’s competitors are
Sometimes you might find yourself getting interested in learning more about 
an industry or a sector. Perhaps you want to perform fundamental analysis 
on several companies that are competitors to one you’re looking into. 
There are several ways fundamental analysts can get a list of the other com-
panies in an industry, including the: 
 
✓ The 10-K: Most companies will provide a list of all the companies they 
deem to be their archrivals in their 10-K, or the annual report required 
by regulators. Flip back to Chapter 12 to refresh your memory on where 
this information is located in the rather lengthy financial document. 
 
✓ Web-based research tools: Several leading financial Web sites will give 
you a list of all the companies that compete with each other in a given 
industry. Enter any stock symbol at Yahoo Finance, at finance.yahoo.
com, and click the “Get Quotes” button. Next, click on the “Competitors” 
link on the left-hand side of the page and you’ll find a list of the top 
rivals and some of their fundamental data. 
Considering industry-specific data
Financial ratios are among the favorite tools used by fundamental analysts. 
You can quickly determine whether or not a company has borrowed too much, 
wastes too much money or isn’t growing very fast by studying financial ratios. 
Most of the popular ratios that will work most of the time are discussed in 
Chapter 8.
But, when performing industry analysis, sometimes the off-the-shelf ratios 
aren’t enough. Some industries might have unique characteristics, which 
requires additional analysis. 

264
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Companies in the financial sector are an excellent example of how industry 
analysis may need to be tweaked to handle different industries. Most of the 
traditional free cash flow measures and cash burn techniques, discussed in 
Chapter 7, just don’t apply to financials. Banks and brokerages, often, have 
cash on deposit from their customers. That cash cannot be used to fund 
operations. 
Due to the special way fundamental analysis must be applied to certain 
industries, analysts often adopt unique methods. Such industry-specific finan-
cial measures can help you better analyze some of the oddities of certain 
industries.
 
Again, the financials are a great example. Many financial analysts know to truly 
see how strong a bank is financially, they must examine both its Tier 1 and Tier 
2 capital. Tier 1 is considered to be a much more reliable measure of financial 
staying power than Tier 2 capital. Banks must disclose how much Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 capital they have, but getting that information requires digging into the 
footnotes to the financial statements. 
Fundamental analysts who specialized on financial companies also study 
industry-specific measures such as a bank’s level of loans that are 90 days 
past due, loans that have been completely written off, and the level of 
reserves a bank has taken to cover loans if they go bad.
Some of the fundamental analysts who took the time to do industry-specific 
analysis saw that many of the banks were less solid than the traditional ratios 
implied. 
Taking stock of raw material costs
Much of fundamental analysis dwells on the end result. You assess a compa-
ny’s bottom line and see how many assets and liabilities it ends up with after 
selling goods and services to customers. 
But industry analysis encourages you to examine a company, almost the way 
the executives running the firm would. And that includes paying attention 
to how much a company must pay for its raw materials. As you know from 
analyzing income statements, the amount of money a company spends to 
buy raw materials used to make products is considered a direct cost, and is 
included in its cost of goods sold, or COGS. The more a company pays for raw 
materials, the higher its COGS, and the lower its profit. 
 
Sometimes, increased demand for a commodity, such as energy or agricultural 
products, can drive the price of raw materials up. As a fundamental analyst, if 
you see the prices of raw ingredients rising, that might be a tip-off a company 
or industry that buys those ingredients might see its future profits fall.

265
 Chapter 16: Digging into an Industry’s Fundamentals
Bloomberg keeps an up-to-date list of prices of many commodities companies 
use as raw materials. You can access this information, for free, here: http://
bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/cfutures.html.
Remember, just because the prices of a commodity a company relies on is 
rising doesn’t mean profits will take a hit immediately. Many companies use 
hedging, or complex financial instruments that let them lock in raw material 
prices for many months, or even years. You can find out if, or how, a com-
pany is hedging the risk of higher commodity prices in the 10-K. 
It’s mine! Paying attention 
to market share
One of the most dramatic ways of paying attention to what’s going on in a 
company’s industry is market share. Market share tells you how much of a 
certain line of business a company controls. 
You can measure a company’s share of either large industries or smaller 
sub-sets of the industry. For instance, if you’re studying a software company, 
you might want to find out what the company’s share of the overall software 
industry is. Or, you might drill down, and find out what percentage of the 
Web-browser software market a company has. 
While market share may be measured on very precise markets, that level of 
industry analysis usually requires analysis that goes beyond what’s available 
in the financial statements. Sometimes, you need to consult with specialized 
market research firms if you want to know what percentage of total sales of a 
product type a company has.
For instance, going back to the software example above, the leading makers 
of Web browsers, including Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla (Firefox), 
Google (Chrome) and Apple (Safari) may or may not disclose what they esti-
mate their market share to be. There are firms that estimate market share for 
this type of software. 
Still, using routine fundamental analysis, you can get a pretty good idea when 
other companies are eating each others’ lunches, so to speak. You can use 
the financial statements to monitor changes in revenue, for instance, to see 
who is benefitting from the weakness of some of the players in the business. 
Market share analysis demonstrates the counterintuitive fact that a company 
may be able to increase profit, even in a tough economic environment, if it’s 
able to steal business from rivals. 

266
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Table 16-6 presents a simple demonstration on how you can see whether one 
company in an industry may be taking business away from other players. The 
table shows total revenue reported by three large computer makers, Hewlett-
Packard, Dell and Apple. 
Examining this chart shows you how Apple, which is a smaller PC maker 
than the other two, may have profited by cutting into the computer busi-
ness. Apple’s slice of the total revenue generated by the big three PC makers 
doubled between 2000 and 2008 to 15.3%. Meanwhile, Dell saw its total share 
of revenue fall a bit to 29%.
Using total revenue to measure a company’s market share is kind of a blunt 
financial analysis instrument. Companies may generate revenue from many dif-
ferent businesses. The companies listed in Table 16-6, for instance, don’t just 
make computers. HP has a large computer services business, and Apple sells 
music downloads. But the analysis can give you an idea of the shifts between 
the industry players and how this type of industry analysis is performed.

Pinpointing Trends Using 
Fundamental Analysis
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why financial trends are an important aspect of fundamental analysis 
▶ Discovering several popular methods to pinpoint trends in a company’s fundamentals
▶ Spotting trends in legal insider trading information and what they indicate
▶ Using computerized screens to help spot notable company and industry trends
P
art of what you’re trying to do, as a fundamental analyst, is to under-
stand what a company’s future might look like. You’re not poring 
through all of a company’s financial statements because you enjoy it. Well, 
maybe you do. But the end game of all the work you’re putting into funda-
mental analysis is to try to get an understanding of how profitable companies 
might be next year or beyond. That information will, hopefully, help you 
determine whether an investment is worth buying. 
Monitoring financial trends is an important aspect of trying to forecast a com-
pany’s future. Studying how a company has done, while not necessarily an 
ironclad predictor of its future, can give you a decent idea of what to expect. 
At least it’s a place to start. 
This chapter will drill down even further into how you can analyze a com-
pany’s historical fundamentals to get a decent expectation for the future. 
Specifically, you will examine how to build a long-term index-number trend 
analysis and a moving average analysis. You’ll also discover whether insiders 
are signaling a trend by either buying or selling shares of their companies’ 
stock. And lastly, you’ll get an introduction into computerized stock screening 
tools, popular databases used by fundamental analysts to find investments 
that might have potential and be worth more study.

Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Understanding Why to Consider Trends 
Historians like to say that while history may not repeat itself, it definitely 
rhymes. And that’s the same idea when it comes to searching for trends, or 
patterns, in a company’s fundamentals. Companies that experience high prof-
itability and have large barriers to entry are often able to protect themselves 
against the ravages of competition and deliver solid results to investors 
over time. Fundamental analysts who track a company’s long-term record, 
or trend, can then get a decent estimate of what the future might hold. Trend 
analysis, therefore, can be a key part of fundamental analysis.
 
Businesses that are very difficult, or very costly, to start up from scratch are 
said to have high barriers to entry. Barriers to entry might also be the regula-
tory hurdles that must be cleared before a new company can get into busi-
ness. Another barrier might be the existence of a company in the field with a 
dominant brand name or technology. Companies that enjoy barriers to entry 
tend to have financials that are more stable and predictable, since competition 
is less of a threat. 
When trends can be very telling 
about a company’s future
Everyone has a bad day once in a while, if not a bad month or even year. The 
same goes for companies. It’s not uncommon for a company to hit a rough 
patch, perhaps due to an unexpected economic slowdown. A company’s net 
income or revenue or both might take a big hit in any given year. 
But when is a bad year something to get worried about? Investors who don’t 
perform trend analysis might make the common error of placing too much 
focus on the latest data from a company. If a company reports a bad quarter, 
for instance, some investors might rush to conclusions and assume it’s game 
over for the company, and its profits are about to go into free fall. 
 
Trend analysis can save you from myopic and short-term thinking. Sometimes 
it’s best to consider an example. Rewind back to 2002. Just to refresh your 
memory, that year, technology companies were suffering a dramatic downturn 
in their business. Technology spending fell off a cliff in 2002 as companies cut 
back. Technology stocks started to crash in 2000 and continued falling for 
years as investors figured the industry’s best days were over.
Oracle, a dominant maker of corporate software, wasn’t spared by the tech 
downturn. After years of delivering strong profit growth, Oracle stunned 
investors on June 18, 2002 with uncharacteristically weak financial results for 
the fiscal year ending May 31, 2002. The company posted operating income, 
or income excluding one-time charges and taxes, of $3.6 billion. That was a 

269
 Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis
decline of 5.5% from the $3.8 billion the company posted in fiscal 2001. Some 
investors, buying into the tech-is-dead argument, didn’t like what they saw. 
 
But fundamental analysts who took the time to examine Oracle’s long-term 
trend were unfazed. If anything, 2002 results were the anomaly, a disruption 
in what had been many years of steady growth. By studying Oracle’s previous 
five years of operating income, fundamental analysts saw the company had 
grown by an compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 30.6% between fiscal 
1997 (ended May 31, 1997) and fiscal 2001 (ended May 31, 2001). Table 17-1 
below shows how steady Oracle’s operating income had been leading up to 
the 2002 slowdown.

Hopefully you’re wondering how I just calculated the CAGR, because I’m about 
to show you. CAGR is calculated using the same present value formula you dis-
covered in Chapter 11, just rearranged a bit. The formula looks like: 
CAGR = (Last amount / starting amount) ^ (1 / number of years) 
Yikes. I know what you’re thinking: That’s one ugly-looking formula. You’re 
right: it’s not going to win any beauty contests. But using the Oracle data as 
an example, it won’t be so bad. All you need to know is the: 
 
✓ Last amount: This is the financial result for the latest year that you’re 
studying. For Oracle, this is operating income for fiscal 2001, or $3,777. 
 
✓ Starting amount: Here is the starting financial amount. For Oracle, this 
is operating income for fiscal 1997, or $1,299.8. 
 
✓ Number of years: The sum of the years you’re calculating the average 
return. This is a little tricky. While we’re analyzing five years of Oracle’s 
financial history, there are really only four full years of growth: from 1997 
to 1998, from 1998 to 1999, from 1999 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2001. 

270
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
The resulting formula looks like this: 
CAGR = (3777 / 1299.8) ^ (1/4) – 1
After you run these numbers, you should come up with 0.306. To convert that 
into a percentage, 30.6%, simply multiply by 100.
 
The ^ symbol tells you to take the number in the previous set of parentheses to 
a power. Most calculators will help you do this using a key, usually labeled yx.
If you and math just don’t get along, this might be another reason why you 
might want to invest in a financial calculator such as Hewlett-Packard’s HP 
12C. The calculator can crunch these present-value problems down with just 
a few keystrokes. 
Attempting to forecast the 
future using trends
Trying to forecast what a company might earn in the future is extremely dif-
ficult. Many Wall Street analysts get paid big bucks to attempt to forecast 
future revenue and profit. 
 
Historical trend analysis can be a helpful way to approach this extremely dif-
ficult task of forecasting. Sticking with the Oracle example, you can see how 
trend forecasting could be used to get a decent idea of how things would turn 
out after the 2002 tech decline. 
It turns out fiscal 2002’s disappointing results were followed by another dif-
ficult year. Operating income fell another 3.7% in fiscal 2003, pretty much 
cementing the doubters’ beliefs that even the biggest technology companies 
had finally hit a wall, and the growth was gone. 
Trend analysis, though, would help you know that growth wasn’t gone. It was 
just moderating a bit. Imagine that in 2002, when things looked bleak, you 
decided Oracle’s days of increasing operating income by 30% might have 
ended. But what about half that? Wouldn’t 15% growth be doable? 
While 15% growth isn’t 30%, that’s still outstanding growth for a company of 
Oracle’s size. A forecast of 15% growth, at a time when tech companies were 
struggling in 2002, would have seemed outlandish. But in reality, you would 
have been very close to what actually happened. Oracle’s actual compound 
average annual growth rate between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2008 was 18.4%, as 
shown in Table 17-2.

Paying close attention to Oracle’s financial trends could have been very prof-
itable for you. Had you invested in Oracle’s stock on June 18, 2002, right after 
it announced the lower earnings, and held through the end of its fiscal 2008 
(ended May 30, 2008), you would have gained more than 150%. The market 
during that same time period gained just 40%. 
 
When forecasting a company’s future profit, it’s often best to use operating 
income, as I did in the Oracle example above. Operating income strips out 
one-time charges and gains, which are impossible to forecast, aren’t repeated 
and can muddy up a historical analysis. 
Attempting to forecast the future 
using index-number analysis
Following the tremendous downturn in business when many companies 
suffered in 2008, fundamental analysts began wondering about the value of 
forecasting based on trend analysis. After all, how can you trust a historical 
analysis when one bad year can come along and knock the whole model to 
smithereens?
One way to make sure your fundamental analysis has a long-term time horizon 
is by using index-number analysis. Despite the fancy name, index-trend analysis 
is just a way to see how a company’s financial results are changing over time. 
This analysis includes recent drastic ups or downs, but also lets you see the 
broader, long-term trend. You found out how to apply index-number analysis 
to the balance sheet in Chapter 6. 

272
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Index-number analysis, though, can also be applied to the income statement to 
help forecast a company’s growth rate into the future. The analysis attempts 
to help you put short-term declines in business into perspective. 
 
To perform an index-number analysis, you just need to choose a year to act as 
a starting point, or base year. You then divide each year’s results by the base 
year and multiply by 100 to get the index number for the year. 
For instance, imagine using Oracle’s fiscal 2000 operating income, $3,080, as 
the base year. To calculate the index number for fiscal 2001, simply divide 
that year’s operating income of $3,777 by the base year of $3,080, multiply 
by 100, and you get 122.6. Table 17-3 shows you how the index analysis puts 
Oracle’s downturn in fiscal 2002 and 2003 into perspective. Despite the down-
turn, the Oracle’s operating income kept chugging along.

Applying moving averages 
to fundamental analysis
Another technique used in long-term forecasts in fundamental analysis is the 
moving average. With this analysis, investors attempt to smooth out unusual 
bumps in a company’s results. A moving average serves the same role as 
your seatbelt when your airplane hits turbulence. 

273
 Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis
 
Moving averages may be applied to annual results or to quarterly results, 
based on how volatile the company’s profits are. 
To conduct a moving-average analysis, you first must choose how many 
years you want to incorporate. A common time period would be three years. 
You add up the company’s results over three-year chunks and then divide by 
the number of years, or 3. Table 17-4 shows you what a three-year moving-
average analysis on Oracle’s operating income would look like. 
Table 17-4

2006
$4,418 
2007
$5,156 
2008
$6,367
Using this analysis, you can see that the company’s compound average 
annual growth rate based on five moving-average periods is 15%. That might 
be a reasonable basis with which to make a forward-looking growth forecast. 
A word about restated results and trends
Whenever you perform long-term trend analy-
sis, as you’ve been practicing in this chapter, 
it’s imperative to pull all the data from a com-
pany’s most current annual or quarterly report. 
And that’s due to a dirty little secret known as 
restatements. 
From time to time, companies may come out and 
say, oops, remember when we said we made X 
in 2007? Scratch that. We actually made Y. If the 
restatement, or change in past financial results, 
is large enough, or material, the company may 
issue a formal statement. But other times, if 
they’re small changes, a company may simply 
alter the numbers in the latest financial state-
ments. 
Restatements are another reason why the 
annual report required by the regulators, or 
10-K, is one of your best friends in fundamen-
tal analysis. The portion of the 10-K called 
Selected Financial Data is a very useful source 
of the freshest data, including any restatements. 
Most companies provide the most up-to-date 
numbers for key elements of the income state-
ment, including revenue, operating income, net 
income and balance-sheet items going back at 
least five years. 

274
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Finding Trends in Insider 
Trading Information
In what’s one of the harsh realities of fundamental analysis, no matter how 
carefully you examine a company’s financial statements, you’ll probably 
never know more than the CEO does. After all, the CEO is in constant contact 
with the company’s customers, suppliers and employees, and has access to 
financial data you’ll never see. 
And that’s why you’ll want to know how to watch trends in what top execu-
tives are doing when it comes to their company’s stock. Officers and direc-
tors of a company are permitted to buy and sell their stock, called legal 
insider trading, as long as they follow specific disclosure rules. Looking for 
trends in the transactions of executives, though, can sometimes tip you off to 
issues. 
 
Legal insider trading is very different from illegal insider trading. When a com-
pany’s officers or directors use knowledge of material, nonpublic information, 
or important financial data that have not been shared with everyone, they run 
the risk of committing illegal insider trading. Many executives try to avoid the 
appearance of illegal insider trading by instructing their brokers to sell the 
company stock they own at a prescheduled time each year. 
When a CEO is bullish, should you be, too? 
Ever go to a restaurant and notice the workers are eating the restaurant’s 
food, too, on their lunch break? There’s something kind of comforting about 
seeing the people in charge of a company using its products. 
Fundamental analysts carry that same idea when looking at companies. It’s 
often considered to be a positive sign when a company’s top management, 
including the CEO, is buying shares of the company. If nothing else, it’s com-
forting to at least know that the CEO stands to lose money, too, if things don’t 
work out. 
 
Even CEOs aren’t perfect. Sometimes CEOs’ own optimism can lead to not-so-
great investments in their company’s stock. In 1998, then-dominant PC seller 
CompUSA began reporting softening earnings, and the stock price was skid-
ding. But James Halpin, an experienced retailer and CEO of CompUSA at the 
time, couldn’t have been more bullish about the company. He spent $3 million 
of his own money buying 200,000 shares of the company’s stock. “I didn’t wake 
up one morning and say, ‘Gee, I have this $3 million … what am I going to do 
with it?’ ” Halpin told Investor’s Business Daily in 1998. “People (insiders) sell 
stock for a lot of reasons. But they buy for only one.” 

275
 Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis
Turns out, though, the company’s future wasn’t all that bright. The company 
replaced Halpin just a few years later, says Hoovers.com. Eventually the com-
pany wound up selling most of its stores and was ultimately sold. 
Paying attention to when a company 
buys its own stock
Some investors think the ultimate bullish signal is when companies announce 
they’re buying back their own stock. What could be more bullish than a com-
pany investing in itself, right? From time to time, when a company feels espe-
cially flush with cash and deems its stock price to be too low, it might plan to 
buy outstanding shares. 
 
Turns out, though, companies have had pretty lousy timing when it comes to 
buying their own shares. Companies spent a record $158 billion buying back 
their stock in the second quarter of 2007, only to pay peak prices ahead of the 
market’s gigantic swoon. As companies were paying up for their stock, the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 hit its bull-market peak on Oct. 9, 2007 and proceeded 
to fall into one of the worst bear markets since the Great Depression. So 
much for good timing. Table 17-5 shows you how much companies have spent 
buying back their stock in recent years.
2007 wasn’t the first time companies had lousy timing buying their own stock. 
Stock buybacks surged in the first quarter of 2000 ended in March, just when 
the market was peaking and about to collapse.

Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
There are additional risks to stock buybacks other than bad timing. When 
companies use cash to buy their own stock back, that is cash that wasn’t 
used to invest in future products or even to reduce the company’s debt load. 
Watching when the insiders are selling
When insiders sell stock, it almost instantly gets everyone’s attention. 
Investors might fear the executives know something they don’t when there’s 
a great deal of selling going on. 
 
Don’t assume just because the management team is selling shares that you 
should dump your holdings, too. CEOs may sell their stock for lots of reasons, 
such as paying for junior’s college or a new car or home renovation. But when 
you see a flurry of selling at a company, or an industry, it pays to be extra 
skeptical. 
Many investors were shocked and surprised by the dramatic meltdown of the 
real-estate business and of homebuilders’ stocks starting in 2005. Everyone, 
that is, expect the top executives at major homebuilding companies. Many 
of these executives, as a group, sold 4.8 million shares in July 2005, says 
Thomson Reuters. That was the largest level of selling in the industry since 
Thomson started keeping records in 1990. The timing couldn’t have been 
better, since the homebuilders’ stocks hit their peaks on July 20, 2005. 
How to track insider selling
Now that you’ve seen how watching what the insiders are doing can be some-
what telling, you probably can’t wait to get started. Here’s the problem. You 
probably can’t call or e-mail the CEOs of companies you’re investing in and 
ask them if they’re buying or selling. 
Fundamental analysis, again, is your way to get the full story. There are two 
main ways to track the insider buying and selling at companies, including from: 
 
✓ Companies’ regulatory filings: Given how sensitive the topic of insider 
selling is, you can imagine how regulated it is. There is a whole array 
of filings executives must provide to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission when buying or selling company stock. 
 
 The most common form containing insider-selling activity is Form 4. 
When an executive buys or sells stock, that activity must be reported on 
Form 4 within two business days. Form 4 documents are available in the 
SEC’s IDEA database. Flip back to Chapter 4 if you want to refresh your 
memory on how to get regulatory filings from IDEA.

277
 Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis
 
✓ Financial Web sites: Several financial Web sites spare you the trouble of 
having to dig up Form 4 filings yourself and compile all insiders’ buying 
and selling in one place. 
 
 The Nasdaq’s Web site provides comprehensive insider-trading data. At 
Nasdaq.com, enter the stock’s symbol and click the Info Quotes button. 
Next, click the Holdings/Insider option located toward the middle of the 
page. You’ll get a summary of how much insider buying and selling is going 
on. You can also drill down and get the names of the executives doing the 
buying and selling. 
Designing Screens to Pinpoint Companies
With thousands of stocks and companies to choose from, it can be intimidating 
for a fundamental analyst to choose which stocks to start studying. After all, 
it could take hours to completely analyze just one company and stock. It’s 
not humanly possible to analyze every company available. 
Fundamental analysts often use stock screening tools to help them scan through 
thousands of companies’ financial statements, literally, with the push of a few 
buttons. These screening tools scan through massive databases of fundamen-
tal data on stocks to select those that meet characteristics you’re looking for. 
 
Stock screening tools help fundamental analysts find stocks much like online 
dating services help singles find potential mates. With online dating services, 
you can enter what particular eye color or hobbies you want your mate to have. 
The system then pulls up a list of people with those traits. Stock screening 
tools aren’t nearly as romantic, unless you think calculators are cute. But 
they’re just as useful. If you’re in search of stocks with returns on equity 
greater than the industry average, for instance, the stock screening tool will 
show you with stocks fit the bill. 
Examples of what screening can tell you
Screening is fundamental analysts’ way of narrowing down the search for 
companies that have all the traits they are looking for. By carefully instructing 
the screening tool to filter out the universe of all stocks for only those with 
certain characteristics, fundamental analysts can get a shorter list of strong 
candidates that deserve closer attention. 

278
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Typically, stock screens fall into one of several categories, including those 
that look for: 
 
✓ Cheap stocks: By searching for stocks with low valuations relative to 
their industry, such as price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios, 
investors can pinpoint potential bargains. 
 
✓ Fast-growing companies: Investors who like to find companies that 
seem to have momentum on their side often seek out those with strong 
earnings or revenue growth. 
 
✓ Efficient companies: Pinpointing companies with strong efficiency ratios, 
such as accounts receivable turnover, are often the ones handling their 
resources effectively. Chapter 8 discusses efficiency ratios and other 
ratios you may decide to include in a screen.
 
✓ Well-managed companies: Ratios like return on equity and return on 
assets, especially compared against peers, can give fundamental analysts 
an idea of which companies have an able set of hands behind the wheel. 
 
✓ Financial strength: Companies with excellent balance sheets, filled with 
cash and light on debt, may be well-positioned to endure an economic 
downturn. 
 
You may build screens that find companies that score well in all the areas 
listed above. Some professional fundamental analysts screen for companies 
based on dozens of criteria.
Step-by-step instructions on 
building a sample screen
Now you’re ready to stop reading about screens and start building them. 
I’ll give you an example of a basic screen in this section: A list of the largest 
companies, based on market value, in the S&P 500 that have return on equity 
that’s greater than the average in their industries. 
 
I’ll be using MSN Money’s Deluxe Screening tool for this example, but this is 
not the only stock screening tool that is available to you. Several Web sites 
offer screening tools; some are free and others require a subscription. You can 
read more about what stock screening tools are available in Investing Online 
For Dummies. 
Building this sample screen requires taking these steps:
 
1. Log into the screening system. You can try MSN Money at money.msn.
com. Scroll down and click on the “Stock Screener” option on the left-
hand side of the page. 

279
 Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis
 
2. Make sure you’re running the Deluxe Screener. If you haven’t used the 
MSN Money stock screener before, you will be prompted to install the 
MSN Investment Toolbox. It’s a small program that won’t hurt your com-
puter. 
 
3. Set your first criteria. Here you tell the screener to only find the compa-
nies with the largest market capitalizations. You can review what market 
capitalization is in Chapter 3.
 
 In the first row of the screen, you can instruct the screener to filter its 
results for companies with market values of $3 billion or more. Click in 
the first block under where it says Field Name, choose Company Basics, 
and then choose Market Capitalization.
 
 Next, change the Operator to >=, which means greater than or equal to. 
Finally, change the Value block to read 3,000,000,000, which is $3 billion.
 
4. Set the second criteria. Here you want to limit your list to companies 
with better-than-average return on equity. Change the next blank, Field 
Name block, to Investment Return and then Return on equity. Set the 
operator to >=, for greater than or equal to. Lastly, click on the Value 
column and choose Investment Return, and then Industry Average 
Return on Equity. 
 
5. Set the third criteria. To limit your search to companies in the S&P 500, 
go to the third row and change the Field Name column to Company Basics 
and S&P Index Membership. Next, change the Operator column to =. 
Lastly, change the Value column to S&P 500. 
 
6. Run the screen. To see the results of your screen, just click the Run 
Search button. The results should look something like what you see in 
Table 17-6, but with updated numbers.

n many sports, not messing up can be the best way to win. In tennis, for 
instance, mistakes you make yourself are called unforced errors. Too 
many unforced errors usually give your opponents an easy victory, even if 
they’re not all that good. 
Reducing the number of errors you make is also important in investing. As 
you’ll discover in this chapter, making too many unforced errors in picking 
the wrong investments can sink your returns. Fundamental analysis, while 
not perfect, can be a vital tool in allowing you to avoid at least some colossal 
disasters. 
Making big mistakes in investing can dig you into a hole that’s extremely dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to climb out of in a timely fashion. If fundamental 
analysis prevents you from making just one blunder, it’s well worth your time. 
Part of the process of avoiding mistakes is steering clear of companies whose 
fundamentals just aren’t right for some reason. Sometimes you might not know 
for sure that a company is about to implode. But fundamental analysis can 
give you the tools that may signal to you, at least, that something about the 
company’s financial reporting doesn’t smell right or displays some common 
red flags. By sticking with companies that have high quality of earnings, or 
reported results that accurately reflect the businesses’ health, you can go a 
long way in avoiding the many landmines that are so easy to step on. 

282
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Uncovering the Dangers of Not 
Using Fundamental Analysis
It might seem like a cheap marketing gimmick in a book about fundamental 
analysis to claim that not using fundamental analysis might be dangerous. 
Maybe the word dangerous is a bit strong. After all, you probably won’t die if 
you don’t read a company’s income statement or balance sheet before 
investing in it. 
But, if you’re assuming the risk of picking and investing in individual com-
panies, not having a knowledge of fundamental analysis can expose your 
portfolio to some trouble. Buying individual stocks because you believe the 
company’s prospects are strong may prompt you to pay sky-high valuations 
for untested companies with shaky fundamentals. And that’s a recipe for 
poor returns, as you will see by reading this chapter.
Why investing in individual 
companies is risky business
By investing in individual companies, you’re exposing yourself to specific risk, 
or unique business challenges faced by companies. Specific risk is very differ-
ent than systematic risk, or risk faced by all stocks.
For instance, if there’s a credit crisis, as there was in 2008, that’s a systematic 
risk that will (and did) hurt just about every stock. However, if you own a 
company that makes widgets, and it’s found that those widgets cause cancer, 
that’s a specific risk to that one company. 
By using fundamental analysis to choose individual companies to invest in, 
depending on what else is in your portfolio, you may be exposed to specific 
risk. In other words, if a company you’re invested in makes a misstep, you 
will suffer a loss other investors won’t. Table 18-1 shows you how investment 
risk, measured by a statistical measure called standard deviation, is much 
higher when investing in individual stocks rather than a broad index such as 
the Standard & Poor’s 500.
 
By investing in a broad mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which owns hun-
dreds of different companies, you can reduce or diversify away your exposure 
to specific risk. If fundamental analysis seems like too much trouble, you’re 
probably best off investing in a diversified mutual fund with low expenses. 
Most investors get the best results investing in diversified index funds, or 
funds that own all the stocks in popular stock market indexes.

Standard deviation is a statistical method used to measure how risky a stock 
is by measuring how much it tends to rise and fall. The higher the standard 
deviation, the riskier the stock is. You want to make sure you’re getting the 
highest amount of return for the amount of risk you’re taking. 
Ignore the fundamentals at your own risk
It’s easy to get enamored with a stock. You might buy a pair of shoes, like them, 
and decide to invest in the company that makes them. Some fundamental 
investors believe it’s a good idea to invest in companies that make things 
they like or understand, for that reason. And there’s no question that having 
an in-depth understanding of an industry, as discussed in Chapter 16, can be 
a vital part of fundamental analysis. 
 
Just because you invest in a company that makes products you understand 
or even use, doesn’t mean you will make money. One of the great examples of 
the danger of buying what you know is Crocs, a maker of plastic clog shoes. 
During 2006 and 2007, these shoes, typically used by gardeners to keep their 
feet relatively clean, caught on with fashionistas. You’d see Hollywood celeb-
rities and their kids wearing Crocs around, and soon they became  popular, 
especially with little kids. 
Investors, betting Crocs might be the next Nike, snapped up shares of the com-
pany when they were first offered to the public in an initial public offering in 
2006. Shares closed on their first day of trading in February 2006 for about $14. 
And for a while, the investment looked like a real winner, and investors chased 
the stock all the way up to nearly $75 a share by October 2007. 
But investors who ignored the fundamental signs showing Crocs’ earnings growth 
wasn’t going to last suffered greatly. The stock began to falter in late 2007 and 
crashed to less than $1 a share in March 2009. The company’s auditing firm, 

284
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Deloitte & Touche, warned in March 2009 it had “substantial doubt” about the 
company’s ability to stay in business. The importance of auditor warnings is 
covered in Chapter 12. 
 
Curious what the fundamental warning signs of Crocs were? I’ll consider Crocs, 
and ten other real-life examples in Chapter 20, where I discuss how fundamen-
tal analysis could have helped you avoid big blow-ups.
Why digging out of a hole is so difficult
One of the top reasons why you want to use fundamental analysis is that 
investment mistakes are incredibly difficult to recover from. Many times 
when companies start to stumble, they have a tough time regaining control. 
When you invest in an individual stock, you’re betting that the company’s 
corporate governance, covered in Chapter 9, will be strong enough to kick out 
the failing management team before things get out of hand. But you also need 
to have faith the board of directors will bring in a qualified replacement to fix 
the company. 
And that’s just the business risk of making an investment mistake. Don’t forget 
the mathematical cruelty when it comes to digging out of an investment hole. 
Table 18-2 shows just how hard it is to make up for drastic losses. 
Table 18-2 
Digging Out of a Hole Is Hard to Do

Since large losses can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover from, some 
fundamental analysts borrow techniques from technical analysis and cut their 
losses. Technical analysis, covered in more detail in Chapter 19, often calls 
for investors to sell a stock if it falls 10% or more from their purchase price to 
avoid devastating losses. 

285
 Chapter 18: Avoiding Investment Blow-Ups with Fundamental Analysis
The dangers of initial public offerings
If there’s a time when investors often turn off 
their reasoning and fundamental analysis skills, 
it’s with IPOs. With an IPO, a company that had 
been private offers its shares to the public 
for the first time. There’s often a great deal 
of hoopla and excitement when a company’s 
shares are in the public’s grasp. 
Some investors love to buy IPOs, practically 
sight unseen. And it’s not because there’s a lack 
of information on IPO. Companies going public 
for the first time must provide everyone inter-
ested in investing with a regulatory filing called 
the prospectus. A prospectus is a gigantic file 
of regulatory disclosures that are kind of like 
the 10-K, 10-Q and proxy statement all rolled 
into one. Prospectuses contain all the financial 
statements you could ever want. 
But often, new companies coming public have 
such a positive story, investors can’t seem to 
help themselves. Here’s a startling fact: A huge 
number of companies aren’t even profitable 
when they’re launching their IPOs. In 2008, for 
instance, 43% of all companies launching an 
IPO lost money, says Jay Ritter, professor of 
finance at the University of Florida. And get this: 
Back in 2000, 80% of the companies that sold 
stock to the public weren’t profitable. Investors, 
though, ignored the fundamentals and bought 
these IPOs anyway. 
As you’re probably guessing already, investors 
who buy IPOs with no understanding of the 
fundamentals are usually sorely disappointed. 
Investors who bought IPOs between 1980 and 
2005, and held the stocks for three years, wound 
up lagging the rest of the stock market by 20.3%, 
Ritter says. 
Some IPO wipeouts are especially stunning. 
One that comes to mind is Blackstone Group, a 
private-equity firm that sold shares to the public 
for the first time in June 2007. Private-equity 
firms were the hot thing on Wall Street in the 
mid-2000s, as they bought companies with bor-
rowed money and sold them for a profit. Since 
private-equity firms had a cachet to them, many 
common investors couldn’t wait to get a piece 
of Blackstone’s stock. Blackstone closed its 
first day at $35.06. But, again, investors doomed 
themselves by paying top dollar for a risky busi-
ness. The credit crunch hit, and Blackstone 
shares sank to $6.53 at the end of 2008 for a 
crushing 81% loss for investors. 
Avoiding bubbles and manias
From time to time, stock investors lose sight of the fundamentals. Bubbles, or 
periods of time when prices of investments get disconnected from their fun-
damental value, are a reality in a market economy. When the public is allowed 
to set the prices on assets in a free-for-all auction, it’s inevitable that some-
times prices in the short term are pushed to levels that are difficult to justify 
with reason. 
 
When you start hearing other people who don’t know how to study a company’s 
earnings and revenue telling you what stocks to buy, the market may very well 
be in a bubble. Caveat emptor.

286
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Sometimes the entire stock market enters a bubble. Sometimes a particular 
part of the stock market gets bubbly. And sometimes, just a few stocks or 
types of stocks see their prices shoot up to the stratosphere. Having the self-
control to avoid these investments with inflated prices is extremely difficult, 
since everyone around you who is buying them keeps making money. But 
fundamental analysis can provide a few things to watch out for as a warning 
prices might be getting ahead of themselves.
Price-to-earnings ratios getting inflated
When investors start to lose their discipline and begin chasing stocks, you 
might start to notice P-E ratios are getting inflated. The long-term average 
for P-Es is generally 15, so when you notice a company’s P-E get dramatically 
higher than that you’ll want to take notice. You’ll want to analyze a stock’s 
valuation, including its P-E and PEG ratios, to get an understanding of how 
rich the price is.
 
If you’re interested in trying to figure out when an individual stock’s P-E is 
starting to get lofty, one approach is suggested by BetterInvesting, a large 
group for investment clubs. BetterInvesting provides electronic software and 
forms that help you measure how lofty a stock’s P-E is relative to earnings 
forecasts and its historical P-E. A stock is considered to be a “buy” when its 
P-E falls into the lower one-third of its historical range. Stocks are considered 
a “sell” when the P-E lands in the upper one-third of the historical range. The 
methodology gives you a way to evaluate P-Es using a company’s historical 
valuation. 
Dividend yields sagging
A stock’s dividend yield, or annual dividend divided by the stock’s price, can 
give you a heads-up on a stock that may be part of a bubble. When a stock’s 
dividend yield drops well below the average in its industry, or what’s paid by 
other companies, you might start to wonder whether investors are paying up 
too much for promises. Similarly, you might be suspicious if one company is 
the only one in an industry not to pay a dividend.
The more investors pay up for a stock, the more the dividend yield drops, 
making the dividend yield a decent indicator to pay attention to. You can look 
up dividend yields paid by other companies to see what the norm is. 
 
Dividend yields often get very low when investors get too bubbly about the 
prospects of the stock market, as they did in both 2007 and 2000, as shown in 
Table 18-3. Don’t assume, though, when a stock’s dividend yield gets unusu-
ally high that it’s a screaming buy. When a stock’s dividend yield gets very 
high, that may be a signal the company is about to cut the dividend or run into 
some serious financial difficulties.

Price-to-book ratios skyrocketing
If you ask an investor and an accountant how much a company is worth, 
they’d approach the question very differently. The accountant might start 
counting up all the assets, or things the company owns, and subtract all its 
liabilities, or things it owes. By subtracting the liabilities from the assets, the 
accountant would come up with the book value of the company. That, the 
accountant would attest, is the company’s value. 
Investors, though, approach the valuation question very differently than 
accountants. Investors might try to figure out how much someone else would 
be willing to pay for the company. The price at which a company would sell, 
the investor might say, is how much the company is worth. 
 
What happens when the accountants and investors disagree? You’ll see it in 
the price-to-book ratio, which is covered in more detail in Chapter 8. If investors 
and accountants agree on the value of a firm, the stock’s price-to-book ratio 
will be 1. If investors think the company is worth more than what the accoun-
tants are saying, the price-to-book will be greater than 1. And if investors 
think the value of the company is less than what the accountants claim, the 
price-to-book ratio will be less than 1. 
When you see a company’s price-to-book soar, sometimes it can be a tip-off 
its stock is in a mini-bubble. Google, for instance, was a stock that could do 
no wrong in 2006 and 2007. Investors drove the company’s price-to-book ratio 
to about 10, as shown in Table 18-4, in 2007. Investors, though, found out the 
hard way that buying pricey stocks can be dangerous.

Here’s one of the biggest problems with using fundamental analysis to avoid big 
stock declines: timing. Stocks’ valuations can remain inflated for some time and 
correct with little warning. Consider Google. In 2004, the Internet search com-
pany’s price-to-book ratio was nearly 20, but the stock still proceeded to nearly 
quadruple over the next three years. This is another reason why no single fun-
damental indictor can be completely relied on. And it’s another reason why for 
many investors, stymied by the timing needed to pick stocks, might be best off 
simply buying and holding a diversified basket of many stocks.
Profitability becomes meaningless
When you start noticing companies that lose money hand-over-fist posting 
huge stock-price gains, it’s time to be on bubble watch. A company’s fun-
damental value is based on its earnings and cash flow, as you discovered 
in Chapter 11. Using that logic, if a company doesn’t have any earnings, it 
doesn’t have any fundamental value. Unless by performing industry and 
trend analysis, you can be confident the company can generate profits, you 
should steer clear. 
We’ll likely find out in a few years or so whether or not Buffett was right and 
Treasuries were actually in a bubble. But the lesson still applies: Bubbles can 
inflate in any corner of the financial markets, not just the places where the 
fast-money crowd hangs out. 
Finding and Avoiding 
Financial Red Flags 
It’s a sad reality that despite all the protections provided to investors, buying 
stock is still largely a buyer-beware endeavor. That’s especially the case when 
buying a large stake in a single individual company. If the company’s 

289
 Chapter 18: Avoiding Investment Blow-Ups with Fundamental Analysis
management makes a mistake, whether honestly or dishonestly, shareholders 
may end up paying the price. 
 
I cannot stress this enough. When you buy common stock in a company, you’re 
last in line for any assets that might be left over if the company is sold off. 
Employees and bondholders are paid first, often leaving the stock investors in 
the failed company with nothing.
Bubbles can come from unlikely places
There’s certainly a “type” of stock that ends 
up being caught in a bubble. Most of the time, 
bubble stocks come from an industry that 
seems boundless with possibilities that cap-
tures the imagination of the uninformed public. 
The Internet stock bubble of the late 1990s was 
the classic example of the type of stock with 
the potential to become a bubble. Investors 
had endless optimism for what the Internet, 
and companies taking advantage of it, could 
accomplish. There’s no question the Internet 
itself proved to be a giant innovation and has 
completely changed global business. But most 
of the Internet companies investors bet on 
either suffered massive stock crashes or van-
ished completely. 
Some investors, though, incorrectly figure they 
can avoid bubbles if they just steer clear of the 
overhyped stocks that are on the front pages 
of the newspapers or the favorite playthings of 
day traders. But that’s simply not the case. It’s 
not the type of investment itself that determines 
whether it’s in a dangerous bubble. Any stock, 
bond, collectible or commodity can find itself 
in a bubble. It’s the valuation, or price you’re 
paying, that determines whether or not you’re 
one of the investors helping to inflate an invest-
ment bubble.
One of the best examples of an unlikely bubble 
occurred in 2008. Investors got so worried 
about the health of the banking system during 
the financial crisis they piled into debt sold 
by the U.S. government, called Treasuries. To 
show you just now strange this situation was, 
Treasuries are just about the least exciting 
investment you can buy. It’s odd to even have 
the words Treasuries and bubble in the same 
sentence. Treasuries usually pay relatively 
low rates of interest and watching their prices 
change is akin to getting front row seats for a 
turtle race. The lure of Treasuries is that they’re 
backed by the U.S. government, and therefore, 
are considered a super-safe place to stash 
money.
But you have to remember the level of panic in 
2008. Investors were practically stuffing cash 
under their mattresses, Treasuries became all 
the rage since they were seen as the last safe 
place to put money. Investors bought Treasuries 
with such ferocity they arguably pushed their 
prices to bubble-like levels. At one point in 2008, 
the prices on Treasuries were at such nose-
bleed levels investors were getting negative 
returns. In other words, investors were willing 
to buy Treasuries and lend the government $1, 
just so they could be sure they’d get 99 cents 
back in a few years. 
The bubble prices of Treasuries even caught 
the attention of famous investor Warren Buffett. 
In his 2008 letter to Berkshire Hathaway share-
holders, he wrote: “When the financial history 
of this decade is written, it will surely speak 
of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and 
the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the 
U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be 
regarded as almost equally extraordinary.”

A real-life pattern for suit-worthy 
shenanigans
All sorts of shenanigans, both those that are pushing the limits and those that 
are outright fraudulent, often leave investors feeling cheated and caught off 
guard. Many investors, feeling there’s no other recourse, may band together 
to sue a company or its management team in a securities class-action lawsuit. 
Table 18-5 shows how the number of federal securities class-action suits 
tends to spike amid a bear market for stocks, such as in 2001 and 2008.

The rationale behind shenanigans
The temptation to cook the books, or make financial statements look better 
than reality, is very big. Management teams running companies have a tre-
mendous amount at stake when it comes to the financial results. One disap-
pointing quarter could erode investors’ confidence in the company’s plan 
and knock the stock price down. And since executives and members of the 
board of directors often own big chunks of company stock, they don’t want 
to see the value of their holdings fall. A vast majority of executives’ pay is 
often tied to their company’s stock price. If the stock falls, they just took a 
massive pay cut. 
 
Flexibility in the accounting system may give executives the leeway they need 
to legally add a penny or two a share to earnings, helping them to make sure 
they meet Wall Street’s ever-increasing demands. Some executives figure just a 
few pennies here or there won’t hurt anyone. 

291
 Chapter 18: Avoiding Investment Blow-Ups with Fundamental Analysis
Financial smoke-and-mirrors used by management teams can be very diffi-
cult for investors to detect, unless they get tipped off and know exactly what 
to look for in the financial statements. And the ability for management to 
manage earnings, or tweak financial statements to make them look more posi-
tive, is a huge issue fundamental analysts must contend with. 
Red flags that signal shenanigans
In Part II, you’ll find all sorts of troubling things that might show up in the 
individual financial statements. In this section of the book, though, I spotlight 
a few of the more common warning signs you need to be particularly vigilant 
to watch for. 
 
Some of the red flags discussed below aren’t illegal. But they all can cause 
financial results to be manipulated to the point that your fundamental analysis 
might be compromised.
Swelling accounts receivable 
If you start seeing the accounts receivable item on the balance sheet sky-
rocket to the point where it’s outpacing revenue growth, that can be a bad 
thing. The accounts receivable line item grows when a company sells product 
to a customer, and accepts an IOU in exchange. If you see accounts receiv-
able growth outpacing revenue growth, you might wonder if the company 
is pushing product onto customers to boost revenue. The way a company 
decides when to book revenue, called revenue recognition, may have a pro-
found influence on its results.
For instance, Internet software company PurchasePro in late 2000 reported 
a $13.2 million quarterly jump in accounts receivable to $23.4 million. That 
should have caught fundamental analysts’ attention, since the company’s rev-
enue was just $17.3 million for the period. The company a year later restated 
results, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ultimately accused 
company executives of committing fraud. 
Overvalued intangible assets
When you think of a company’s assets and read about them in Chapter 6, 
actual property the company owns that can be touched or seen probably 
comes to mind. But those types of assets, called tangible assets, are only one 
part of what a company owns. Companies also have what are called intan-
gible assets, or items believed to have value that cannot be seen or touched. 
When intangible asset values are inflated, fundamental analysts might believe 
a company to be worth more than it is in reality. 

292
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
 
Many fundamental analysts completely disregard intangible assets when mea-
suring the book value of a company. Since many of these assets probably 
couldn’t be sold if the company were to be liquidated, it’s often safe to leave 
them out of your analysis. 
Massive big-bath and “one-time” charges 
One commonly used trick by companies is the so-called big-bath restatement. 
When a company is about to report a poor quarter, it makes it really bad. 
A company’s management writes down the value of assets or pays some 
expenses ahead of time, which makes the current results look really bad. But 
by getting all this bad news out, the company sets itself up for the illusion of 
a better future. Best of all, some investors automatically look past one-time 
charges, assuming they’re just unusual events. But the fact is, these restate-
ments can have a profound effect on inflating a company’s future profits. 
 
Be especially skeptical of companies, sometimes called chronic restaters, 
which seem to be regularly declaring big one-time charges. One-time charges 
are supposed to be just that. If you see them occurring frequently, you should 
wonder why.
Low “Quality” earnings
Accounting rules are supposed to make a company’s financial statements 
more reflective of reality. For instance, companies are expected to book rev-
enue when a sale is made, not necessarily when cash is received on the sale. 
Booking revenue this way ensures that the revenue is matched up with the 
costs incurred to generate that revenue. 
But this accounting technique, while of merit, can open the doors to manipu-
lation. Companies can push the limits of accounting by padding the financial 
statements with revenue and earnings that have no connection whatsoever 
to cash actually received or spent. Companies that do this are considered to 
have earnings of low quality. The statement of cash flows is a fundamental ana-
lyst’s best weapon in finding and steering clear of companies with low-quality 
earnings. I give you complete instructions on how to perform this quality of 
earnings detection analysis in Chapter 7.
Increasing borrowing, or leverage
If the bear market and credit crunch that began in 2007 taught investors any-
thing, it’s the danger of borrowing too much. The same lesson was learned by 
investors. Some companies, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros., had 
so much exposure to debt, or leverage, they were unable to hold themselves 
together when business turned south. 

293
 Chapter 18: Avoiding Investment Blow-Ups with Fundamental Analysis
And while entirely legal, debt can also distort some of the popular measures 
fundamental analysts consider when evaluating companies’ profitability. 
Return on equity, a commonly used financial ratio used to measure the effec-
tiveness of a management team, is especially vulnerable to distortion from 
the use of debt. You can read about return on equity, and how it’s skewed by 
debt, in Chapter 8.
 
General Electric is an example of how some investors may not have fully 
understood how debt can have a big-time influence on fundamental analysis. 
GE’s return on equity in March 2009, based on its financial returns from the 
previous 12 months, was a respectable 16.3, says Thomson Reuters. That was 
right in line with the industry’s average of 17.8. 
But if you look at the company’s return on assets, a financial ratio which strips 
away the effect of leverage, you get a different picture. GE’s return on assets 
during the same time period was 2.3, well below the industry’s average return 
on assets of 5.2. GE’s use of debt caused return on equity to be relatively 
high, even though its return on assets was relatively low at the same time.
Again, nothing is illegal about borrowing, and I’m not suggesting at all that it 
is. Debt can be a critical portion of a company’s total capital structure, since it 
tends to be cheaper to borrow than to issue stock. But it’s a crime for a fun-
damental analyst not to pay attention to the effect of a company’s debt.

uying the right stock at the wrong time is often worse than buying the 
wrong stock to begin with. Many beginning investors get frustrated 
after studying a stock’s financial statements, the analysts’ and media reports, 
and valuation information, only to end up losing money anyway. 
And that’s the big drawback of fundamental analysis. Just because a stock 
might appear to be cheap doesn’t mean it will rally anytime soon. And just 
because a company’s historical fundamentals look strong doesn’t mean its 
business can’t deteriorate and put the company in jeopardy. On the flip side, 
sometimes companies that look like real dogs can turn things around and sur-
prise investors on the upside. Don’t forget, too, that no matter how good you 
might be performing fundamental analysis, your assumptions might be off, 
leading to poor investment decisions. 
These complications of fundamental analysis are big reasons why some 
investors consider adding a dose of technical analysis to their technique. 
Technical analysis, the study of patterns in stock prices, is used by investors 
who think they can use the opinions of other investors to see something in a 
stock’s future. 
Marrying technical analysis with fundamental analysis, in some ways, is 
like trying to mix oil and water. They’re very different approaches. But even 
fundamental analysts may improve their understanding of the way a stock 
behaves by taking a closer look at its technicals, or indicators technical ana-
lysts pay attention to. 

296
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Understanding Technical Analysis
If you’ve ever seen an investors’ desk that’s covered with all sorts of charts 
with squiggly lines or computer screens displaying graphs, you may have 
found a technical analyst.
Technical analysts are often called chartists because they spend their time 
poring over stock price charts. These charts show where a stock price has 
been over time and how many investors have bought or sold the stock. 
Technical analysts believe historical patterns in a stock price’s movement 
can give solid clues about where the stock might be headed in the future. 
 
It’s important to remember many academics take strong exception to techni-
cal analysis. Studies have shown a stock price’s movement in the short term is 
tied to news events, which are random. Stock price charts, academics say, tell 
you nothing other than what a price was in the past. Longer-term stock prices 
respond to a company’s earnings and cash flow, which are not predicted by 
anything on a stock price chart, many academics insist.
Sometimes it does seem technical analysts get a bit carried away with the 
art of their craft. Some technical analysts read stock price charts almost like 
a clairvoyant studies the lines on a client’s palm. With that said, technical 
analysis is often mentioned by investors, so it’s worth knowing a bit about. 
More importantly for fundamental analysts, though, is that some of the meth-
ods used by technical analysts may be useful for investors who are focused 
on revenue and earnings. 
Reading the stock price charts
The primary tool used by technical analysts is the stock price chart. These 
charts, available on just about any financial Web site, usually plot a stock’s 
closing price every day. Charts usually come in several forms, including the:
 
✓ Line: Most of the stock price charts you see are usually line charts. Line 
charts, as their name implies, are simply a connect-the-dots line linking 
the closing prices of a stock each trading day. 
 
✓ High-Low-Close: Line charts are simple, but they do obscure some of 
the relevant data from trading. If you look at a line chart, there’s no way 
to know how high or low stock prices got each day. The High-Low-Close 
chart, shown in Figure 19-1, attempts to solve this shortcoming of line 
charts. On each trading day, there’s a vertical bar, with the top portion 
representing a stock’s high price and the bottom, the low. Then there’s a 
line through the middle of the bar showing the price at which the stock 
closed. 

297
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
 
✓ Candlestick: Candlestick charts pack even more information than line 
or high-low-close charts. Candlestick charts not only show you a stock’s 
high, low and close, but also its open price. A stock’s open price is the 
very first price in a trading day that buyers and sellers agreed upon. The 
indicator on a candlestick chart looks like a rectangle with a vertical line 
protruding from the top, to mark the stock’s high, and from the bottom, 
to mark the low. You can take a look at a sample in Figure 19-2.

What technical analysts are 
looking for in the charts
If you’ve ever heard a technical analyst speak, it might seem like a bit of 
voodoo. Usually, technical analysts have a pen or marker in hand, start scrib-
bling all over a price chart and talk about all sorts of patterns that they see. If 
you’ve ever been to a star-gazing presentation at an observatory, you probably 

298
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
get an idea of what it’s like hearing a technical analyst describe a stock chart. 
Technical analysts try to connect dots on charts to find patterns they say can 
be revealing about a stock’s future. Technical analysts are looking for several 
things in the charts, including: 
 
✓ Price patterns: If there’s one thing that technical analysts fixate on, 
it’s the shape of the charts. Technical analysts think investors, being 
human, follow predictable cycles of fear and greed. These emotions 
cause stock prices to follow predictable scripts, or patterns, that may 
indicate where the stock is headed. 
 
✓ What other people see: Even if you do all the fundamental research pos-
sible, you can still be dead wrong. Technical analysts attempt to look 
at a stock chart to either confirm or deny their belief about a stock’s 
future. If a stock is in free fall, technical analysts would assume other 
investors know something they don’t and would avoid it. 
 
✓ Support and resistance levels: Through the constant tug-of-war 
between buyers and sellers, a stock attempts to settle at a price inves-
tors agree upon. Sometimes a stock will have difficultly breaking beyond 
a high point, or resistance level, and will routinely bounce off a low point, 
called a support level. 
 
✓ Momentum: Technical investors often try to capitalize on the tendency 
of some stocks to gain steam either going up or heading down. If a stock 
starts to rally, technical investors take notice and assume those in the 
know expect the company to report something positive. 
A technical analysts’ dictionary
If you ever find yourself speaking with a tech-
nical analyst, I’ll warn you, you might need to 
bring a decoder ring. Technical analysts use all 
sorts of sometimes funny sounding words and 
terms to describe certain patterns that might 
appear on a stock-price chart. These terms 
are extremely useful for technical analysts 
because they can, very quickly, describe the 
ups and downs of a stock in a way that others 
can instantly picture and know what they’re 
talking about. 
These terms remind me a bit of the names of con-
stellations in the heavens. If someone points at the 
Big Dipper in the sky, you know to look for a cer-
tain pattern of seven stars that looks like a soup 
ladle. Similarly, when a technical analyst says a 
stock pattern is showing a head and shoulders 
pattern, you know to look for a stock that has risen 
and fallen three times in a way that appears like a 
person’s shoulder, head and other shoulder. 
Just as there are countless names for constel-
lations, there’s practically an endless supply 
of terms to describe patterns in stock prices. 
Besides head and shoulders, there’s the cup 
and handle, neckline and throwback, just to 
name a few. All these terms mean very spe-
cific things to the technical analyst. If you’re 
interested in finding out more about these pat-
terns, and what they mean, you might check out 
Technical Analysis for Dummies (Wiley).

 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
How technical analysis differs 
from fundamental analysis
Technical analysts and fundamental analysts are diametrically opposed to 
one other. Get enough fundamental and technical analysts together in one 
room, and a fight is sure to break out. Technical analysts believe all informa-
tion about a stock that’s worth knowing is reflected in its stock price. Taking 
the time to study a company’s fundamentals is a waste of time, a pure techni-
cal analyst would argue, because everyone else has access to the same infor-
mation and has either bought or sold the stock already. 
Fundamental analysts, on the other hand, claim technical analysts fall victim 
to groupthink and fixate over changes in stock prices that tell investors noth-
ing about the future. What’s more, fundamental analysts claim stock prices 
can get overvalued when investors become too optimistic about a stock and 
push its price above or below the company’s intrinsic value. You can learn 
how to calculate a stock’s intrinsic value in Chapter 11. 
Blending Fundamental 
and Technical Analysis
While fundamental and technical analysis couldn’t be more philosophically 
opposed to each other, there are ways to marry the two approaches together. 
In fact, the shortcomings of both fundamental and technical analysis, in some 
ways, balance each other out. 
A few ways to potentially boost your fundamental analysis success using 
techniques from technical analysis include: 
 
✓ Cutting your losses: One of the fatal flaws of many pure fundamental 
analysts is stubbornness. Fundamental analysts urge investors to do 
their homework, buy a stock and hold on for dear life no matter what 
happens. But during the ugly bear market that kicked off in 2007, many 
fundamental analysts learned the hard way that stocks can go to zero, or 
at least get very close. 
 
 One thing technical analysts are often very good at is cutting their 
losses. When technical analysts buy a stock, they often have a stock 
price in mind that they’ll sell at if things go south. Knowing how to cut 
your losses short can be vital when investing in individual companies’ 
stocks, which is a risky endeavor. Some technical analysts suggest inves-
tors sell a stock if it falls 10% or more from their purchase price. 

300
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ Improving your timing: Some fundamental analysts like to buy stocks 
and just hang on. But sometimes stubbornness can be expensive. For 
instance, you might be sitting on a stock that’s not moving, while the 
rest of the stock market charges ahead. Technical analysis attempts 
to help you avoid sitting still when there’s money to be made in other 
stocks. 
 
✓ Helping you to spot manias: Because technical analysis is so focused 
on what other investors are doing and what they’re paying for a stock, 
it can help alert a fundamental analyst to manias and bubbles. Knowing 
when other investors are getting overly enthusiastic about a stock can 
be a good clue to explain why a valuation might be getting overly lofty. 
Using stock prices as your 
early-warning system
Even a lifelong fundamental analyst, who looks at technical analysis as glo-
rified palm reading, may still benefit from the art of reading charts. When 
forecasting how a company’s revenue or earnings might look like a year from 
now, fundamental analysts need to take educated guesses at what shape the 
economy or the company’s industry will be in. 
Watching stock prices can be useful in helping a fundamental analyst form 
an opinion about the future. Since stock prices tend to foreshadow economic 
reality three, six or nine months in advance, paying attention to stock price 
movements may tell fundamental analysts something about what the econ-
omy might look like. 
 
Monitoring industry sectors, as described in Chapter 16, may be especially 
helpful. If you start noticing shares of companies that make durable goods, 
or high-ticket items like houses and cars, falling, that may very well be a tip-
off that investors expect the economy to slow. That’s useful information you 
might consider when forecasting a company’s future earnings growth. 
Looking up historical prices
Even if the technical analysis tools discussed in this chapter seem a little too, 
well, out there for you, you can still benefit from charts and historical stock 
price data. Oftentimes, you might find yourself wanting to know what a stock 
price was in the past. Perhaps you want to look up your cost basis in a stock, 
or how much you paid for it when you originally bought it. You’ll need to 
know your stock basis to measure your capital gain or loss for tax purposes.
You may also want to know what a stock price was, say, a year ago so you can 
measure how well or poorly a stock has done. 

301
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
When you want to look up a historical stock price, it’s time to break out the 
stock price chart. Most online Web sites let you plot stock prices going back 
in history so you can see what a stock price was in the past. All the major 
financial Web sites let you pull up historical stock charts. 
Since so many investors ask me for tips on looking up historical stock prices, 
I’ll step you through one way to accomplish this task. If you’re looking to get 
a stock’s price in the past, here’s how you’d do it using the Money section of 
USATODAY.com: 
 
1. Log onto the Money section of USATODAY.com.
 
 Enter money.usatoday.com into your Web browser.
 
2. Enter the stock’s ticker symbol. 
 
 Scroll down a bit until you see an area to enter the stock symbol on the 
left-hand side of the page. Click the Go button. 
 
3. Launch the historical stock quotes engine. 
 
 Click on the “Historical quotes” option on the green navigation bar. 
 
4. Choose the date you’re interested in. 
 
 Enter the date into the blank and click the Get Quote button. The system 
will tell you the stock’s high, low and closing price on that day. 
The Primary Tools Used 
by Technical Analysts
Just as fundamental analysts pore over financial ratios and statements, tech-
nical analysts have indicators they examine as well. Many of the indicators 
technical analysts focus on are tied directly to a company’s stock price or 
trading history. You might review some of the items that technical analysts 
pay attention to and determine how to best implement them in your funda-
mental strategies. 
Getting into the groove 
with moving averages
One of the first things most technical analysts plot on a stock chart is the 
moving average. The moving average tells you what a stock’s average price 
has been over a set period of time. Moving averages can be calculated for any 
period of time, but technical analysts usually use the following time periods:

302
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
 
✓ 10-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past two weeks. 
 
✓ 50-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past quarter. 
 
✓ 200-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past year.
Technical analysts compare a stock’s current price to its moving average. If 
the stock price is greater than the moving average, that’s considered to be a 
bullish signal for the market. If the current stock price is less than the moving 
average, that’s a bearish signal.
If you’re going to choose a moving average to pay attention to, you should 
go with the 200-day. Technicians get very cautious when a stock price falls 
below the 200-day moving average, and may wait on the sidelines before 
buying back in until the stock rises above the 200-day moving average. When 
a stock falls below the 200-day moving average, that means that every inves-
tor who bought the stock within the past year, on average, is losing money. If 
the stock creeps upward, many of these disappointed investors are eager to 
dump the stock, making it difficult for the stock to rise.
Keeping an eye on trading volume
Technical analysts are very interested in a stock’s price and the trend of the 
price. But most technical analysts also pay close attention, too, to how much 
trading volume is occurring. Trading volume measures how much investors 
are buying or selling a stock. If buyers and sellers are furiously trading shares 
back and forth, then trading volume is considered to be high, or active. 
When trading volume is active, technical analysts figure they can trust the 
price movement to a greater degree. For instance, imagine a stock that soars 
to break into new high ground, but on low trading volume. A technical analyst 
would be skeptical of the move higher, since a relatively small group of inves-
tors powered it. Similarly, if trading volume is heavy, that tells the technical 
analyst there’s a great deal of volume, or conviction, behind the trade. 
Table 19-1 summarizes the way a fundamental analyst might couple reading 
volume with price movements.

 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
Your next question, though, might be how you can determine whether trad-
ing volume is higher or lower. The major stock market exchanges, including 
the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, provide trading volume for the 
day and the average daily volume to most of the financial Web sites. Technical 
analysts compare a stock’s trading volume for the day with its average daily 
volume to determine whether buying and selling is active or not. 
Using MSN Money’s site, you can obtain a stock’s daily and average daily 
volume following these steps: 
 
1. Log into MSN Money at money.msn.com.
 
2. Enter the stock’s symbol in the blank and click the Get Quote button.
 
3. Read and interpret the volume.
 
 You’ll find the stock’s volume, as well as its average daily volume over 
the past 13 weeks, listed on the page. When the day’s volume is consid-
erably higher than average, then you can use that insight to analyze the 
significance of the stock price’s move.
The ABC’s of Beta
Beta, or the beta coefficient, is one of those rare market indicators that both 
fundamental and technical analysts can agree has value. Beta is a statistical 
measure of how volatile a stock is relative to the stock market at large. You 
might recall, from Chapter 11, how beta is used in the capital asset pricing 
model used to build a discounted cash flow model. 
 
While beta is based on a somewhat complex statistical technique, as an inves-
tor, most of what you need is pretty simple. If an individual stock has a beta of 
1, that means it is equally volatile as the general stock market. If beta is less 
than 1, then the stock tends to swing up and down less than the market. And if 
a stock’s beta is greater than 1, it is less volatile than the market. 
A technical analyst might look at beta to provide clues on how wild to expect a 
stock’s ups and downs to be. Beta is available from nearly all financial Web sites.
The long and short of short interest
It might seem strange, but there may be other investors who are hoping, and 
betting, that a stock you own will go down. These investors, called short sell-
ers, use a series of maneuvers to position themselves to profit if a stock falls. 

304
Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Investors short a stock by first borrowing shares from another investor who 
owns them. The short seller, then, turns around and sells the shares imme-
diately, pockets the proceeds and waits. The short seller then must buy the 
shares, hopefully at a lower price, and return them to the investor they bor-
rowed from. If the stock falls, the investor makes money by buying the shares 
back at a lower cost than they sold them for. 
You might never decide to bet against a stock yourself. But it may be useful 
for a fundamental analyst to know just how many people are shorting a stock 
they do own. There are three things to pay attention to when it comes to 
short interest: 
 
✓ Short interest: A stock’s short interest is a measurement of how many 
shares of a company’s stock have been sold short. 
 
 Just looking at short interest doesn’t tell you a whole lot. A company 
with more shares outstanding, or shares in investors’ hands, would natu-
rally have more short interest than a company with fewer shares out-
standing. You’ll want to compare short interest with another measure to 
get proper perspective, as I describe below.
 
✓ Average daily share volume: Remember volume, mentioned above? 
This data will be helpful again in interpreting how significant short inter-
est is by putting short interest into perspective. 
 
✓ Days to cover: Days to cover tells you how large a company’s short inter-
est really is. Days to cover is calculated by dividing a stock’s short inter-
est by its average daily volume. This statistic indicates how many days 
of typical trading it would take for the number of shares being shorted 
to trade hands. 
 
The higher a stock’s days to cover is, the more heavily shorted it is. Fortunately, 
all three types of shorting data described above are available at Nasdaq.com. 
Just enter a stock’s symbol into the site and a window will pop open. Click on 
the Short Interest option listed below where it says “Fundamentals.” 
Determining what short interest means to a fundamental analyst is bit tricky. 
Some fundamental analysts actually like to see a stock that’s heavily shorted. 
If you’re completely confident in your fundamental analysis and know what a 
company is worth, and believe the stock is undervalued, heavy short interest 
can actually be a good thing. When stocks are heavily shorted, if the com-
pany delivers solid earnings, investors who shorted the stock may scurry to 
buy back the stock. 
 
A rush by nervous short sellers to buy back a stock they wrongly bet against 
is called a short squeeze. Short squeezes can cause powerful stock rallies. 

305
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
But fundamental analysts tend to view a heavily shorted stock as a warning 
sign. After all, an investor who shorts a stock is exposed to a theoretically 
infinite loss, since there’s no real limit to how high a stock can rise. If inves-
tors are that confident a stock is going to fall, you want to make absolutely 
sure you’ve done a complete job with your fundamental analysis. 
Keeping a Close Eye on Options 
To be sure, fundamental analysis is all about knowing how to study a com-
pany from top to bottom and understand what it’s really worth. A classic 
fundamental analyst only pays attention to a market price for a stock when 
deciding whether it’s undervalued and should be bought, or overvalued and 
should be sold. 
And for the most part, looking at the stock’s current price is enough to tell 
you what the market measures a stock’s value to be. A stock price is the 
result of a vigorous back-and-forth between buyers and sellers. Through an 
auction, conducted largely over vast and rapid electronic trading networks, 
a stock’s price rises and falls until buyers are satisfied with the price they’re 
paying, and sellers are OK with the price they’re getting. 
But there’s an entirely separate layer of trading that takes place beyond the 
buying and selling of the stock itself in the options market. Options are finan-
cial contracts that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or 
sell stocks at a prearranged price at a set time in the future. 
 
Watching the prices of stock options can give you a better idea of not only 
what investors are willing to pay for stocks now, but their belief of where a 
stock might be in the future. You might want to factor in the prices of options 
in your fundamental analysis.
Understanding the types of options
Options come in two most basic forms, put options and call options. Put 
options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a 
predetermined price at a set time in the future. Call options, on the other 
hand, give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a pre-
determined price at a set time in the future. 
Investors may buy and sell both put and call options, driving their prices up 
and down, just as they would trade stocks. Table 19-2 shows you the four 
most basic options strategies, which you’ll want to understand in order to 
know how to interpret prices on options.

Paying attention to put 
and call price levels
If you want to get an idea of what investors are expecting from a stock, you’ll 
want to take a look at its option chain. An option chain tells you how much 
investors are paying for both put and call options that expire, or come due, at 
different times in the future. 
Option chains are usually sorted by strike price, or the price at which the 
option kicks in. For instance, imagine you bought a call option for stock ABC 
at a strike price of $25 that expires in December. That means you have the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at $25 a share in December. 
Fast-forward to November. Imagine the stock is now trading at $100 a share. 
Suddenly, having the right to buy a $100-a-share stock for just $25 a share 
is valuable, or in the money. However, if instead of trading for $100 a share, 
what if the stock is trading for $2.50? Not many people would want the right 
to buy a $2.50 stock for $25. At that point, your option is considered to be out 
of the money.
 
If you start noticing the price of call options with strike prices above the cur-
rent market price going up, that’s an indication investors are expecting good 
things from the stock in the future. 
 
Some technical analysts also pay attention to the volume, or level of trading 
activity, in options, too. In fact, the amount of trading in put and call options 
is the basis of another thing technical analysts watch, the put-to-call ratio, dis-
cussed below. 
Watching the put-to-call ratio
Now that you understand what puts and calls are, you might wonder how 
you might put the information to use. Again, as a fundamental analyst, you’re 
much more concerned about a company’s revenue and earnings rather than 

307
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
short-term trading noise. But, monitoring the level of puts and calls can tell 
you how many other investors either agree, or disagree, with your assess-
ment of a company’s value. 
The put-to-call ratio gives investors a quick look at how bullish or bearish 
investors are on a stock’s prospects. The ratio is simply the number of puts 
(which are bearish) divided by the number of calls (which are bullish). 
The higher a stock’s put-to-call ratio, the more pessimistic investors are 
about a stock’s future. 
You could calculate a stock’s put-to-call ratio yourself, but it’s easier to use 
online resources that do it for you. You can get the put-to-call ratio from 
Schaeffer’s Investment Research at www.schaeffersresearch.com. Enter 
the stock’s symbol in the upper right-hand corner and click the ‘get quote’ 
button. Scroll down and click on the Put/Call Open Interest Ratio option, and 
you’ll see the put-call ratio plotted for you.
Using the market’s fear gauge: The Vix
One of the great strengths of fundamental analysis is that it gives you a frame-
work to assess how much a business is worth. That way you can make an 
intelligent decision on whether the stock’s price is higher or lower than the 
business’ value. Fundamental analysts, in fact, often get their best deals when 
other investors are afraid to buy stocks and push stock prices down. Warren 
Buffett, in his 1986 letter to shareholders, put it this way: “We simply attempt 
to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are 
fearful.” 
 
One of the biggest reasons why fundamental analysts might choose to pay 
attention to technical analysis and options is that they may help you see when 
other investors are feeling greedy and when they’re feeling nervous. And when 
they’re nervous, you can be greedy.
There are many ways to get an idea of when other investors are fearful, which 
is valuable information for fundamental analysts. One popular indictor of 
investors’ fear is based on options trading. This indictor, called the Chicago 
Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index or Vix, is often looked at as a pretty 
valuable measure of investors’ fear. When the Vix is rising, that means inves-
tors are getting increasingly nervous. And when the Vix is falling, that means 
investors are getting complacent. 
You can obtain current values of the Vix from the CBOE at http://www.
cboe.com/data/mktstat.aspx. Historical values of the Vix are available 
at http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/historical.aspx. Most financial 
Web sites will also let you plot the Vix, if you enter the symbol. For instance, 
if you enter $vix.x in MSN Money, you can view its value over time.

Applying Technical Analysis Techniques 
to Fundamental Analysis
As you’ve probably picked up from earlier in the chapter, fundamental ana-
lysts and technical analysts take very different approaches when checking 
out stocks. If you put technical analysts and fundamental analysts in a room, 
while a fight not break out, there certainly would be some dirty looks being 
exchanged. 
Perhaps you’re reading this book because you disagree with technical analy-
sis for the reasons highlighted above. Maybe you’ve tried technical analysis 
before and gotten burned. Still, even if you’re primarily interested in a com-
pany’s fundamentals, don’t assume this chapter doesn’t apply to you. While 
technical analysis is often a dirty word among fundamental analysts, there 
are some techniques used by technical analysts that can easily be carried 
over to fundamental analysis. 
In the sections above, you find out how to add technical analysis to your 
investment style. You may have skipped that section, figuring you want noth-
ing to do with technical analysis. 
But in this section, I attempt to show you ways to some tricks and techniques 
used by technical analysts directly to fundamental analysis. This isn’t as 
strange as it might seem. After all, realize one of the most valuable things 
technical analysts do is turn mountains of complex numerical data into 
charts and graphs. Numbers that are indecipherable in huge spreadsheets 
can suddenly become enlightening when turned into a chart. Suddenly, 
charts can help investors quickly spot trends in data they might have other-
wise of missed. 
Even if you’re a die-hard fundamental analyst, there is something to be said 
about placing investment data on charts that can be closely studied. In fact, 
the technical analysts are onto something when it comes to a few of their 
techniques, which can be applied to fundamental analysis. 
 
One of the great drawbacks of fundamental analysis is timing. A cheap stock, 
based on fundamental analysis, can get even cheaper if it has technical trends 
working against it. By applying some of the tricks of the technical analysis 
trade to fundamental analysis, you might spot trends you might have over-
looked if you were just focusing on the income statement and balance sheet. 

309
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
Giving fundamental data the technical 
analysis treatment
Some technical analysts love charts so much, they might even plot out some 
data that are traditionally considered to be for fundamental analysts. Even 
if you’re not onboard with technical analysis, there’s no question that some-
times, seeing fundamental data presented graphically may help you spot 
trends. 
 
Plotting fundamental information, rather than just looking at table stuffed 
with data, may give you a unique perspective and help you to spot trends you 
didn’t notice before. 
Price-to-earnings ratios, or P-Es, and dividend yields are two of the fundamen-
tal pieces of data that technical analysts most often will place on a chart. 
Looking at how P-E ratios are rising, or falling, over time can help you deter-
mine whether or not investors are getting overly giddy or cautious about a 
stock. You can read about the P-E ratio in more detail in Chapter 8 and the 
dividend yield in Chapter 10. 
Slapping fundamental information on a chart may bring to light trends your 
eyes glanced over. And there are online tools that make this pretty easy to 
do. Nasdaq.com, for instance, provides a free charting service that allows 
you to plot both P-E ratios and dividend yields. You can do this by following 
these steps. 
 
1. Log onto Nasdaq’s site at www.nasdaq.com.
 
2. Enter the symbol of the stock you’re interested in.
 
 After you enter the stock symbol into the blank, click on the Company 
Charts button. 
 
3. Select the fundamental data you would like to see plotted. 
 
 Hover your mouse pointer over the Technical Indicators button, then 
choose Lower Indicators, and then P/E ratio. If you want to plot dividend 
yield instead, choose dividend yield. 
 
4. View the data. 
 
 The data are then plotted for you in a rectangle below the stock’s price 
chart.

Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Following the momentum of fundamentals
Technical analysts are often interested in following the momentum of stock 
prices, meaning the prevalent trend either upward or downward. Just as col-
lege basketball teams often get momentum during big games and start going 
on a hot streak, technical analysts believe stocks can turn hot and have the 
gust of investor enthusiasm at their backs. Momentum investors hope to pile 
into a stock while it’s still soaring, grab a quick gain and get out. 
Classic momentum investing is contrary in most ways to fundamental analy-
sis. But fundamental analysts might consider borrowing a bit from this con-
cept, as strange as it sounds, when examining fundamental data. 
 
By watching for momentum in a company’s fundamentals, you might get a tip-
off that something meaningful is taking place at a company.
One way to apply the concept of momentum to fundamental analysis is by 
studying earnings acceleration. Here, you’re not just looking for companies 
that are increasing their profitability every quarter or year. You’re being even 
pickier. You want to find companies that are increasing the rate at which 
earnings are growing. 
 
Fundamental analysts generally use quarterly earnings as their gauge for a 
company with momentum. Momentum, by its nature, is short-term focused so 
it makes sense to use short-term data.
To perform an earnings-acceleration analysis, you just need to have a com-
pany’s earnings growth rate for the last few periods. While it’s usually done 
using quarterly results, the analysis can be done using quarters or years. 
Below is an example of how you might do this analysis using Oracle’s net 
income for four past years, shown in Table 19-3. 
Table 19-3 
Oracle’s Annual Net Income
Fiscal year
Net income ($ millions)

311
 Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
Your first step is calculating the growth rate between each period. A growth 
rate is the difference between the most recently reported quarter and the 
same period in the previous year’s quarter. You can review how to calculate 
growth rates in Chapter 4. Once you measure each year’s growth, you get a 
chart that looks like what you see in Table 19-4. 
Table 19-4 
Oracle’s Annual Net Income Growth
Fiscal year
Annual Growth
2008
29.2%
2007
26.4%
2006
17.3%
As you can see from Table 19-4, what’s interesting is that Oracle’s annual 
growth rate is accelerating. In other words, the growth of the most recent 
period is greater than the one before it. This is the kind of trend that a funda-
mental analyst, looking for momentum, would be on the search for. 
 
Fundamental analysts often look for quarterly earnings momentum, for instance, 
when trying to figure out how successful a new product is. New products can be 
critical to a company’s sustained earnings growth. And if something a company 
introduces is catching on with customers, an earnings-acceleration analysis 
might show something exciting is going on at the company.

(Chapter 22).

L
et’s face it. Curling up with a warm cup of coffee and a stack of financial 
statements just isn’t quite as appealing as cracking open a great book. 
Sure, you might find some salacious details in some company reports -- some 
are even famous, including one financial statement discussed in this chapter. 
Overall, though, a company’s annual report filed with regulators, called the 
10-K, probably isn’t going to be something you pass around in your next book 
club meeting. 
But, with that said, reading financial statements is still worthwhile. I’ve found 
that investors appreciate the importance of reading financial reports when 
they see real-life examples of how they could have pinpointed major issues at 
companies well before they were known to the public.
This chapter highlights several actual examples of how investors could have 
been tipped off to important developments at a company by reading the 
financial statements. A couple of the examples in the chapter are fraud. And 
certainly, knowing when a company is cooking its books is important, since 
that means you cannot rely on the financials. 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
But a vast majority of the time, fundamental analysts aren’t looking for execu-
tives that are lying. Rather, fundamentals analyst are looking for numbers 
that are lying. Sometimes, the numbers might be completely accurate but 
don’t paint a true picture of the condition a company is in. This chapter 
shows you how to closely analyze a company’s fundamentals by using easy-
to-follow examples. 
Spotting One-Time Charges That Aren’t
Spotting outright corporate fraud using just the publicly available financial 
statements can be very difficult. If a company lies to you and fabricates por-
tions of the financial statements, you are at a huge disadvantage as a funda-
mental analyst. Fortunately, corporate fraud, while more common than I’d 
like to see, still remains rare overall. 
What’s much more common, though, are companies that pad results using 
perfectly legal tricks you need to watch out for. 
 
My top suggestion on detecting when a company is using little tricks to boost 
earnings is by comparing a company’s net income with its free cash flow. I step 
you through this very important analysis, in detail, in Chapter 11. If you didn’t 
read that section during the first swing through this book, you might want to 
flip back and check it out now. 
Another thing to be aware of as a fundamental analyst is when companies 
routinely take so-called one-time or restructuring charges. By classifying a 
charge as one-time or nonrecurring, some analysts might overlook the costs, 
assuming they are unusual and not indicative of the company’s core busi-
ness. But when you see a company constantly taking one-time charges, be 
careful. 
One of the companies that seemed to make one-time charges a regular phe-
nomenon was technology firm, i2 Technologies. As of late 2001, the company 
made reporting one-time charges a quarterly event. And these charges were 
significant. In fact, at some points the company’s nonrecurring charges were 
larger than its revenue. 
 
Detecting companies reporting incessant one-time charges can tip you off to 
an overly aggressive management team. 
And certainly at i2, the chronic one-time charges were a red flag worth paying 
attention to as they were symptomatic of deeper problems. In June 2004, 
the company agreed to pay $10 million to wronged investors for a pattern of 
misstating its results for a five-year period ended in 2002, according to the 

317
 Chapter 20: Ten Examples of Unearthing Financial Secrets
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company’s improper accounting 
techniques gave investors the impression the company’s revenue and profits 
were rising, when in fact, its results were “increasingly negative,” the SEC says.
 
You can spot a company reporting excessive one-time charges yourself in the 
earnings press release or the income statement, as described in Chapter 5. 
But MSN Money, a Web site that consolidates financial information, makes it 
even easier to find one-time charges. Enter a stock symbol at money.msn.com, 
click the Get Quote button and choose the Financial Results option, and then 
Statements.  You’ll see a row called “Total Extraordinary Items.” If that item is 
consistently high relative to revenue, be wary. 
Spotting Financial Distress a Mile Away
There are many ways to protect yourself from buying a car that’s a lemon. 
You can look up the company’s history and even get a warranty. When it 
comes to avoiding a dud in investing, though, fundamental analysis is one of 
your best weapons. 
The best way to know whether a company is unlikely to survive is by care-
fully studying the financial statements, covered in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 and the 
financial ratios, discussed in Chapter 8. 
There’s a shortcut, though, to finding whether a company is unlikely to make 
it. It’s called the Altman’s Z-score. The Z-score is a long formula that crunches 
down many of the things you look for and puts it into a single number. 
Z-Score = (0.717 * A) + (0.847 * B) + (3.107 * C) + (0.42 * D) + (0.998 * E)
Where: 
A: (Current assets – current liabilities) / total assets
B: Retained earnings / total assets
C: Earnings before interest and taxes / total assets
D: Shareholders’ equity / total liabilities
E: Revenue / total assets
 
Calculating the Z-score is just a matter of mostly pulling the data off the financial 
statements and plugging them into the formula. You can find out how to obtain 
all the data listed above from a company’s financial statements in Chapters 5 
through 7. But to make it easy, I’ve listed their locations in Table 20-1.

Once you calculate the Z-score, you might wonder what it means. One of the 
beauties of the Z-score is that you just see where it fits on a chart, as shown 
in Table 20-2, and get a quick interpretation.
Table 20-2 
Reading the Z-Score
If a company’s Z-Score is . . .
. . . Then it’s considered . . .
Less than 1.2
Highly likely to fail
Between 1.2 and 2.9
In so-so condition
Higher than 2.9
Unlikely to fail
Consider the example of Nortel Networks. The telecommunications com-
pany stunned many long-term investors who figured the company was too 
big to fail, when it became the second largest public company bankruptcy in 
January 2009, says BankruptcyData.com. 
But fundamental analysts monitoring the Z-score saw this colossal wipeout 
coming. Nortel’s Z-score dipped below 1.2 in the second quarter of 2001, 
coming in at a -1.74, says Capital IQ. The Z-score never pulled above 1.2 again. 
Talk about a huge warning. 
 
The Z-score is really a quick-and-dirty way to assess a company’s health. Don’t 
rely on it solely when making a financial decision, instead, be sure to fully ana-
lyze the company’s health.

Sidestepping the Financial Crisis
Every once in a while, perhaps once every generation, there comes a shock 
to the financial and economic system so severe, you really don’t want to get 
caught in the middle of it. The banking crisis that began in 2007 with the sub-
prime mortgage crisis was one of those brutal economic events you didn’t 
want to have anything to do with. 
The crisis stunned many investors because much of the damage hit shares 
of banks, which for many years, had been considered safe and steady invest-
ments. While the severity of the crisis caught many investors off guard, there 
were some clues available to fundamental analysts that at least showed there 
were problems brewing. 
 
A good place to have noticed the financial crisis gaining steam was reading 
the risks section of the 10-Ks filed by top financial institutions. Chapter 12, 
for instance, shows how AIG was taking blatant risks that caused the firm to 
implode.
But there were other tip-offs for fundamental investors. Consider the fate of 
Cleveland’s National City Corp. The regional bank, founded in 1845, grew into 
one of the nation’s largest originators of mortgages. National City’s dividends 
and earnings were all steady. So was the stock for many years, as it marched 
to nearly $37 a share at the end of 2006. 
Turns out the steady results were a mirage. National City was eventually 
bought by rival bank PNC in a distress situation in 2008, for just $1.92 a share. 
Investors were shocked at how a seemingly strong bank could weaken so 
quickly. 
But they shouldn’t have been so surprised. Basic industry analysis pro-
vided a clue, had investors picked up the regulatory filings released by 
National City’s nearby Akron, Ohio-based rival FirstMerit. As far back as 2003, 
FirstMerit, which serves many of the same communities as National City, con-
stantly alerted investors it was aware of some shaky mortgages on its books 
and was taking action to get rid of them. 
Back in 2003, FirstMerit told investors it was selling off some of its most risky 
loans. And again, in the 2006 letter to shareholders, the CEO of FirstMerit said 
the company was actively identifying potentially problematic loans and deal-
ing with them immediately. All these warnings came well before the mortgage 
crisis hit in force in 2007. 
But even as FirstMerit was paring troubled assets, National City’s 2006 annual 
report to shareholders was glowing. “Our competitors face the same issues 

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
as we do, but we believe we’re better-positioned than most in this tougher 
environment,” then-CEO David Daberko wrote in a letter to shareholders in 
the 2006 annual report. 
 
Savvy fundamental analysts might have wondered why FirstMerit was making 
such a dramatic effort to reduce its risk, while nearby rival National City 
hardly made a mention of troubles until it was too late.
Seeing Companies with Potential 
Environmental Issues
Rising concerns about the environment are increasing awareness by consum-
ers, regulators and investors about how companies are treating the planet. 
Without getting into the ethical issues connected with how companies use 
natural resources, investors need to be aware of the potential for financial 
risk connected with pollution or other environmental factors. Companies 
might face large fines or consumer backlashes if caught violating environmen-
tal rules and regulations. 
 
Don’t expect a company to give you a nice neat list of all the potential sites 
they may have polluted that could come back to haunt it. However, again, the 
10-K can give fundamental analysts a head’s-up of potential environmental 
concerns. 
My favorite example of this is Pacific Gas & Electric’s 1994 10-K. Buried deep 
in this filing are the allegations from a lawsuit claiming the company’s power 
station in San Bernardino County, California, was causing serious contami-
nation. The suit alleged the plant was exposing residents to chromium. The 
company also disclosed a number of environmental measures that would 
cost it up to $55 million over five years. Does this sound familiar? Well, these 
allegations were the basis of the movie Erin Brockovich. Of all the 10-Ks in the

Staying Away from Investment Fads, 
Like the Dot-Bombs
Up until the financial crisis, the biggest implosion of the financial markets 
had to be the Internet bubble. Investors ignoring the fundamentals of com-
panies rushed to buy stock of companies that didn’t make any money and 
sometimes didn’t even have revenue. 

321
 Chapter 20: Ten Examples of Unearthing Financial Secrets
Even to this day, the absurdity of the dot-com bubble remains one of the 
best reasons why anyone who buys individual stocks should take the time to 
understand the fundamentals. Investors who blindly jumped into technology 
and Internet stocks blindly got a beating of a lifetime. 
 
More than 117 dot-com companies collapsed between September 1999 and 
October 2000, according to Boston Consulting Group. Of those, 12 of the fail-
ures resulted in bankruptcies, 63 shut down their Web sites completely, and 
the rest struggled in various forms. But in each case, investors lost nearly all, 
if not all, their money. 
Online pet supply store Pets.com, in hindsight, provides some of the best 
lessons on how fundamental analysis can help you avoid getting sucked into 
investment fads. The company’s story sounded great. The site allowed con-
sumers to buy things they needed for their pets over the Internet. Great, right? 
But fundamental analysis revealed the true story. Turns out the company’s 
survival was nearly impossible. Pets.com lost 19 cents on every $1 in revenue 
it posted in the third quarter of 2000, reported USA TODAY. And that didn’t 
even include overhead costs. In other words, the more product the company 
sold, the more money it lost. You can’t do that very long before going out of 
business. And it didn’t. Pets.com liquidated itself roughly one year after going 
public. 
 
It turns out that Pets.com wasn’t alone. Nearly 60 of the 729 Internet compa-
nies in late 2000 were selling products for less than what they paid for them, 
USA TODAY found. If you want a telltale sign of a mania, this is it.
Pinpointing Companies Fooling Investors
When trying to detect accounting fraud, there’s only so much a fundamental 
analyst can do. After all, you have to believe the numbers to some degree, 
since you don’t have the authority to go inside a company to verify its books 
and records yourself. 
But there are some aspects of accounting that are so commonly abused, they 
are worth constantly being on a lookout for. So-called channel stuffing would 
be at the top of my list of early fraud warnings. 
 
A company can boost its revenue and profit by enticing customers to buy 
products now, even thought they don’t want them yet, in order to boost 
results in the short term. Often, a company might cut customers slack in how 
quickly they must actually pay for the merchandise. That way, the company 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
may book the revenue, even though no cash is collected. Clearly, this practice 
causes a problem for the company in the future, since consumers don’t order 
because they have more than enough product. 
Sunbeam is a classic example of alleged channel stuffing. The SEC accused 
the company’s management of providing customers with lucrative deals in 
1997 to coax them to buy product ahead of time. And the channel stuffing 
technique wasn’t enough to keep the fraud going, so the company resorted to 
even more aggressive means to prop up results, the SEC says. 
Again, techniques in this book could have at least shown you something was 
amiss. Fundamental analysis of the company’s accounts receivable turnover in 
days, discussed in Chapter 8, would have provided clues. This financial ratio 
tells you how many days it takes for a company to collect amounts owed to it 
by customers. In 1996, Sunbeam collected its accounts receivable in 79 days. 
But that period shot up to 92 days in 1997, which was a gigantic red flag. 
 
Always be suspicious when you see accounts receivable turnover in days 
jump up like that.
Seeing through Distortions Caused 
by Stock Buybacks
Stock buybacks occur when a company uses its cash to buy back shares 
of its own stock. There are many reasons why companies might do this, as 
explained in Chapter 18. 
But these buybacks can create enormous distortions to financials. While 
there’s nothing nefarious about stock buybacks, investors might come to 
false conclusions unless they use fundamental analysis. Since buybacks 
reduce a company’s number of shares outstanding, they can inflate a com-
pany’s earnings per share. Remember earnings per share is calculated by 
dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding. So if the number of 
shares falls, the denominator falls, and the earnings per share rises. 
 
The distortions caused by stock buybacks to a company’s earnings per share 
aren’t fraudulent. They’re merely the result of mathematics. Still, the effect can 
dramatically alter how investors perceive a company’s results. 
Take, for instance, Automatic Data Processing. The company has been finan-
cially strong for a long time, and is one of the few nonfinancial firms to earn 
the coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor’s. The company had 

323
 Chapter 20: Ten Examples of Unearthing Financial Secrets
been long known for its unstoppable consistency. Back in January 2003, the 
company touted it had extended its “streak” of posting higher earnings per 
share for 166 straight quarters. ADP’s streak gave it the reputation of being a 
solid and dependable generator of consistent growth. 
But fundamental analysts who took a closer look saw that while the company 
was telling the truth, there was more to the story. Certainly, the company’s 
earnings per share indeed rose 2% to 43 cents a share during the December 
2002 quarter. However, that increase in earnings per share was largely due 
to the fact the company reduced its number of shares outstanding by spend-
ing $80 million buying back 2 million shares of its stock during the quarter. 
Stripping out the effect of buybacks, by looking at net income, tells the real 
story. ADP’s net income fell 1.1% in the quarter to $262 million. No, it wasn’t a 
big drop, but the number puts ADP’s streak into more context. 
Knowing a Trend Will Come to an End
It never fails. Every couple of years, there’s a company that captures the 
imagination of investors. Crocs, the maker of plastic shoes that had been 
used mainly by gardeners and boaters, became that new darling. After debut-
ing its shares as an initial public offering in February 2006, the company 
could do no wrong. 
Crocs’ revenue soared at a neck-turning pace, rocketing from just $1.2 million 
in 2003 to $847.4 million in 2007. And investors didn’t miss a step, driving 
shares from their first day’s closing price of $14.28 in Feb. 2006 to $74.75 on 
Oct. 31, 2007. Investors figured the company could expand into all sorts of 
new footwear and keep up the growth. 
Fundamental analysts, though, knew better. For one thing, Crocs’ compound 
average annual growth rate of 415.5% between 2003 and 2007 wasn’t sustain-
able, just by using logic. If Crocs were to grow keep growing that fast, it would 
have exceeded the revenue of Nike in two years. You can find out how to cal-
culate compound average annual growth rates in Chapter 17.
But fundamental analysis also gave investors clues the momentum at Crocs 
was petering out. As early as the first quarter of 2007, the company’s revenue 
and earnings growth both fell, breaking a streak of quarterly increases in 
growth. Even if investors missed this first sign of trouble, there were more, 
including when the company posted a net loss of $4.5 million in the first quar-
ter of 2008. Even at that time, fundamental investors could get out, as Crocs’ 
stock was still trading for $17.47 a share in March 2008. 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
But ignoring the fundamentals proved to be very hazardous. While Crocs 
posted a small profit in the second quarter of 2008, it swung to large losses 
in the third and fourth quarters. At the end of 2008, Crocs shares fell to $1.24. 
And then, in 2009, the company’s auditor publicly questioned whether Crocs 
could survive as the company’s revenue fell to $126.1 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, down from $224.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. 
Separating the Strong 
from the Weak Players
Savvy fundamental analysts know economic downturns can be as much as an 
opportunity as it is a threat. 
If a company can survive, while its key rivals do not, it will likely be better off 
once the economy heals. A great example of this occurred in the consumer 
electronics business in 2008. Clearly, the slowdown in the economy caused 
consumers to cut back their spending on big-screen TVs and MP3 players. 
And that caused a big problem for archrivals Circuit City Stores and Best Buy. 
But fundamental analysis removed any doubt which company would survive. 
A free cash flow analysis, as described in Chapter 11, told the story. During 
the fiscal year ended Feb. 2007, Circuit City’s free cash flow was just $34 mil-
lion, and it actually burned $355 million in cash in the fiscal year ended Feb. 
2008. Considering the company only had $296.1 million in cash in February 
2008, fundamental analysis told you Circuit City had a big problem. Circuit 
City filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 10, 2008, making it the 13th larg-
est public company bankruptcy in 2008, says BankruptcyData.com. 
Contrast Circuit City’s standing with the situation at Best Buy. Best Buy had a 
sizeable chunk of cash, $1.4 billion, in the bank at the end of its fiscal year in 
March 2008. And while Best Buy felt the negative impact of the economy, as 
did Circuit City, it still generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in its fiscal year 
ended March 2008. Clearly, Best Buy was in a position to survive. 
 
Correctly choosing which company can withstand a tough economic period 
can be lucrative once the weaker rivals drop off. With Circuit City out of the 
way, Best Buy reported better-than-expected 9.7% revenue growth in the quar-
ter ended Feb. 28, 2009.

Watching for Market Saturation
When companies start out, investors can’t help but expect limitless growth. 
Many of the most successful stocks in history include brand-new concepts 
for stores, such as Home Depot and Starbucks, which seemed to have no end 
in sight as to where they could open stores. 
Guess what? There were limits. Especially in retail, investors at first get 
overly optimistic about how many cities and communities can support a new 
concept. Investors rush into the stock, assuming its blistering pace of open-
ing new stores will never end. But inevitably, as fundamental analysts know, 
it’s possible to build one too many locations. After time, market saturation 
sets in. 
Starbucks remains a classic example of a chain which has tremendous growth 
prospects, but there were still limits. Since being founded in 1971 with its first 
store, Starbucks seemed able to open as many stores as it wanted, and then 
open even more. The company added hundreds of stores a year starting in 
1994 and by 2007 there were nearly 16,000 Starbucks locations worldwide. 
But in July 2008, the first signs of market saturation become apparent when 
the company said it would close about 600 company-owned stores in the U.S. 
Investors, used to Starbucks turning coffee into liquid gold by constantly 
opening new stores, didn’t like what they heard. Shares of Starbucks fell 
nearly 40% from the July announcement through the end of 2008, trailing the 
rest of the stock market by about 10 percentage points amid a tough time for 
the economy.
Fundamental analysts, though, saw this market saturation coming. And it 
didn’t take any fancy financial formulas to spot these warnings. In the quar-
ter ended March 2008, Starbucks reported its largest decline in net income 
growth, 28%, since 1998. 
And even more alarming, the company’s return on assets fell to an unchar-
acteristically low 7% for Starbucks. That was half the return the company 
earned on its assets in the quarter ended Dec. 2007. It was clear the company 
wasn’t getting the kinds of returns it traditionally did from its stores and 
assets.

hen you see that pile of dirty dishes in the sink, you probably feel a 
tinge of guilt telling you that you really should wash them. But you 
just might not be in the mood. 
And that same sense of reluctant obligation might also apply to your portfo-
lio. You might own some individual stocks and realize you really should be 
analyzing their fundamentals, but other things just seem more interesting. So 
the annual reports and proxy statements just pile up. 
Certainly, performing a complete financial analysis of a company takes time 
as you run through all the financial statements, calculate dozens of financial 
ratios and study the industry, just to name a few things. Fundamental analy-
sis can take a bit of effort, seeing that Wall Street analysts and credit rating 
experts get paid to do this kind of thing all day long. 
Just because you might not have time to do a complete financial analysis 
doesn’t mean you should let your financial dishes sit in the sink. This chapter 
will tell you what ten types of fundamental analysis you should always make 
time for. You’ll find out which types of fundamental analysis you should pri-
oritize for when looking to dig into a company’s financials but have limited 
time. If you conduct these ten aspects of fundamental analysis, you will be 
well ahead of many investors who just blindly buy stocks on a whim.

Measuring How Much of a Company’s 
Earnings Are “Real”
If you’re not a full-time fundamental analyst, and you own more than a hand-
ful of stocks, it would be a full-time job to constantly monitor in real-time 
every bit of financial data you’ll want to be aware of. 
So here it is. My suggestion on the one form of fundamental analysis you 
should never skip is the measurement of a company’s quality of earnings. As 
soon as you can get your hands on a company’s income statement and state-
ment of cash flows, you want to make sure a company’s cash from operations 
is greater than or equal to its net income. When a company is generating 
cash flow, you have some proof the earnings are real, not just smoke and mir-
rors allowed by accounting. You can review how to conduct this analysis in 
Chapter 11.
 
Comparing a company’s cash from operations to its net income only takes a 
few moments. The payback for this small investment of time is huge. If you 
avoid investing in companies with weak cash flow relative to their net income, 
you may sidestep many bum investments or even outright frauds. 
Considering How Much Cash 
the Company Has
It would be pretty rude to ask strangers you meet at a cocktail party how 
much money they have in their savings accounts. But you don’t have to 
worry about such etiquette when it comes to companies. Before you invest 
a dime in a company, you want to make sure you not only know how much 
companies have, but also what they owe. You should know: 
 
✓ How much cash a company has on the balance sheet.
 
✓ How much the company owes to lenders in the short term and long 
term.
 
✓ How much cash a company generates.
Paying close attention to these four variables will help you avoid plunking 
your money down in a company that may not survive.

329
 Chapter 21: When Analyzing a Company
 
Looking for a quick way to see if a company’s survival is in question? Don’t 
forget to calculate the company’s Altman’s Z-score, described in Chapter 20.
Making Sure You Don’t Overpay
Investors are constantly surprised when they spend hours and hours analyz-
ing a company’s fundamentals, only to buy a stock and still lose money. 
There are countless forces at work to determine a stock’s price. Remember, 
stock prices are set by the constant tug of war between buyers and sellers 
trading shares back and forth until settling on a price everyone can agree 
upon. And that’s why it’s critical for you to not only evaluate how solid a 
company is, but also how profitable it is and whether it has staying power. 
It’s imperative not to pay too much. 
 
Studies have shown that growth stocks, or shares of companies with the high-
est valuations measured by price-to-book ratios, are often the biggest disap-
pointments for investors. This means that the more you pay for a stock, the 
lower your future return is likely to be. 
Evaluating the Management Team 
and Board Members
As an investor in a company’s common stock, or the shares issued to the public 
representing standard ownership in the company, you’re at the mercy of 
the management team to make the correct decisions with your money. And 
you’re counting on the board of directors to keep a watchful eye on the man-
agement team. If you can’t trust the management team and board of directors, 
you shouldn’t trust them with your investment. 
 
If you don’t look at anything else in the proxy statement, always be sure to 
look for related party transactions between executives or board members 
and the company. These are side business dealings with the potential to cor-
rupt the ability of executives or board members to represent the interests of 
investors like you. And even if a CEO is doing an excellent job, be watchful of 
excessive pay packages. CEOs that aren’t ashamed to lavish themselves with 
excessive pay probably aren’t afraid to take other liberties with your money. 
Review Chapter 9 for tips on how to dig into the proxy statement.

Examining the Company’s Track 
Record of Paying Dividends
Day traders used to scoff at investors who paid attention to dividends. During 
stock market booms, these small cash payments some companies pay to 
their shareholders seem almost insignificant. 
But fundamental analysts know better. For one thing, dividend payments 
account for a big portion, roughly 4 percent, of the returns generated by 
stocks over time. Miss out on those payments, and you’re leaving quite a bit 
of cash on the table. Also, steady dividends can make sure you’re earning 
something on your money even if a stock is flat. Dividend payments can also 
be helpful in helping you decide how much a stock is worth, as described in 
Chapter 10. 
Lastly, while companies can fudge or pad their earnings, dividends can’t be 
faked. Dividends are usually actual cash payments you can deposit in a bank 
account or spend. Companies paying dividends are at least showing you a 
tangible sign of their profitability. 
Comparing the Company’s Promises 
with What It Delivers
It’s easy to simply take a company management’s word as gospel. Financial 
television is especially infamous for practically turning corporate CEOs into 
royalty and taking everything they say at face value. 
That’s not to say you, as a fundamental analyst, need to treat CEOs as crooks 
or liars. But it is up to you to verify claims made by a CEO. If a company’s 
CEO says a new product is selling like crazy, take the time to look at its rev-
enue growth and also the accounts receivable turnover in days to ensure cus-
tomers are buying and actually paying for the goods. If a company claims to 
have posted record profits, it’s up to you to not only verify the claim, but also 
make sure it wasn’t the result of accounting puffery.
 
Always compare the promises made by a CEO in one year’s annual report to 
shareholders with the reality delivered in the following year’s financial state-
ments. Professional fundamental analysts often read a company’s latest 10-K 
with the previous one, side-by-side.

331
 Chapter 21: When Analyzing a Company
Keeping a Close Eye on Industry Changes
Fundamental analysis is powerful, but there is a great deal of emphasis 
placed on financial statements. And the big weakness of financial state-
ments is that they’re historical documents telling you how a company did, as 
opposed to how it will do. 
Trend analysis, described in Chapter 17, is one way fundamental analysts look 
beyond historical numbers to assess the future. But you need to be especially 
mindful of game-changing technologies or new ways of doing things in busi-
ness that can render a company’s way of making money, or business model, 
obsolete. 
 
The constant danger that a new technology may wipe out a company is one 
reason why some fundamental analysts stick with easy-to-understand and 
basic businesses, where consumers keep coming back. Consumer products 
companies, for instance, don’t have to worry that people will stop buying 
deodorant (at least your nose hopes so). 
Understanding Saturation: Knowing 
When a Company Gets Too Big 
Eventually, for most companies, the early days of easy growth evaporate as 
the product and business matures. A product, which might have been so new 
that everyone had to buy one, eventually becomes so prevalent that growth 
slows. And when a company expands so much, it becomes more difficult to 
grow further. These growing pains and maturity present great challenges to 
both management teams and fundamental analysts. Companies often struggle 
with the transition from a fast-growth company to a slower growth one, and 
sometimes need to change their entire strategies. Fundamental analysts, too, 
much change the way they evaluate a company and measure its valuation. 
 
Keep a close eye on a company’s operating profit margin, or how much of rev-
enue the company keeps in profit after paying direct and indirect costs. When 
you see the operating profit margin deteriorate, that can be a heads-up that 
the business’ glory days are fading.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest in 
a mature business. In fact, the contrary is often true. But you need to be aware 
that the business’ fundamentals have changed. Review Chapter 5 for methods 
on how to monitor profit margins. 

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Avoiding Blinders: Watching 
the Competition
It’s often tempting to buy stock in a company you think is the best in a busi-
ness, and assume that your work is done. But companies are constantly 
changing and evolving. Sometimes a company’s rival might rise up from near 
death with a killer product and pose a huge threat. Meanwhile, the valuations 
of so-called leading stocks are often driven up so high that its future returns 
are often disappointing. 
 
When looking to invest in a company, take the time to read statements and 
documents released by a rival company you might consider to be weaker. 
Paying attention to statements made by the CEO of a rival company in a letter 
to shareholders, for instance, might tip you off to industry trends the CEO of 
the leading company may not have noticed yet. 
Watching Out When a Company 
Gets Overly Confident
Some athletes get themselves into trouble when they decide to showboat. 
The temptation to do that one extra and unnecessary back flip or victory 
dance sometimes lets a quiet competitor sneak up and steal the win. 
Companies, too, can sometimes get full of themselves. Figuring that their fat days 
will never end, some companies build opulent headquarters, send employees on 
overly lavish business trips or even spend cash on vanity promotions.
 
Perhaps one of the ultimate forms of business vanity is when a company pays 
millions of dollars for the right to slap its name on a professional sports team’s 
stadium.  During the 1990s, it became fashionable for companies to pony up 
millions of dollars to sponsor venues hosting a professional team in sports 
including football, baseball and basketball. Several academic studies, though, 
have shown there to be very little to no benefit to companies, on average, for 
making these large investments. One of these studies lists a number of the 
classic examples of companies that ran into extreme financial difficulty after 
paying to put their names on sport facilities, including Adelphia, Enron and 
PSINet, which all filed for bankruptcy protection. You can read the full study

’d love to tell you fundamental analysis will make you instantly rich 
beyond your wildest dreams. Heck, I’d love to tell you that fundamental 
analysis will make you look 15 years younger, too.
And certainly, fundamental analysis is a very valuable tool. It can be used by 
all sorts of investors, or even by employees, members of the public, or just 
about anyone interested in knowing how to gauge the health of companies. 
But, fundamental analysis also has its limitations. And rather than trying to 
ignore the shortcomings of fundamental analysis, it’s important to recog-
nize upfront what they are and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you don’t 
approach fundamental analysis with reasonable expectations and knowing 
what the risks are, you may certainly be disappointed with the results. 
In this chapter I outline some of the primary drawbacks to fundamental anal-
ysis. I hope you don’t let these shortcomings turn you off completely from 
fundamental analysis. After all, understanding how companies work, how 
stocks are valued and how to measure how profitable a business is are skills 
that can only benefit you. But again, you need to know what fundamental 
analysis can do, and what it cannot, before making ill-informed decisions. 

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Ensure You Buy Stocks 
at the Right Time
The biggest knock against fundamental analysis is that it doesn’t necessarily 
help you time your investment decisions just right. You might do a beautiful 
job analyzing a company’s financials, identify an undervalued stock, buy it and 
wait to make money. And then, 10 years later, you’re still waiting and waiting. 
 
Just because a stock is fundamentally cheap doesn’t mean it must soar in value 
anytime soon; in fact, it can become even cheaper. Sometimes a stock is cheap 
for a reason that will reveal itself in its financial statements in the future. 
Guarantee You’ll Make Money
I wish I could tell you that if you use fundamental analysis, you’ll make money 
on every stock you buy. But the fact is, during a bear market, even the most 
skilled fundamental analyst will likely suffer losses, at least on paper. During 
times of extreme stock market stress, some investors might wonder why they 
even bothered with fundamental analysis. 
One investor, who submitted a question for my daily Ask Matt investment 
column at USATODAY.com, stated this frustration very well. “I’ve learned how 
to read the fundamentals, including earnings per share, price-to-earnings, 
return on equity and the stock price chart. But I’m still losing money. How are 
you supposed to research stocks anyway?”
 
Hopefully this book shows you that fundamental analysis requires taking a 
close look at many aspects of a company. And even after this, fundamental 
analysts can make mistakes. 
Being wrong from time to time is just one of the aspects of fundamental anal-
ysis you need to be aware of and live with. Don’t beat yourself up too badly 
when you make a mistake. Consider some of the admissions made by Warren 
Buffett in his 2008 letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. Buffett bought a 
large position in oil company ConocoPhillips during the year, when oil and 
gas prices were near peak levels. Buffett was thinking energy prices would go 
higher. But in the letter, he wrote “I have been dead wrong.” He added: “Even 
if (energy) prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase 
has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.” 

335
 Chapter 22: Ten Things Fundamental Analysis Can’t Do
Save You Time When Picking Stocks
Some investors like to refer to fundamental analysis as an art. There’s at least 
one key difference, though, between art and fundamental analysis. After an 
artist is done chiseling a statue or creating a painting, he or she is done. The 
work stands as a completed masterpiece of enduring value. 
Fundamental analysis, though, doesn’t age well. Even after you spend hours 
completely studying all public information about a company, its stock and 
industry, you’re not done. New information continuously flies at you and may 
have an influence on your analysis. If fundamental analysis is art, it’s defi-
nitely a work in progress. 
Performing fundamental analysis takes time, patience and determination. 
You’ll need to take the time to gather, analyze and process new financial 
information as it comes in. Fundamental analysis can be somewhat time-
consuming, as you’ll need to make sure you are studying every aspect of a 
company that you possibly can.
Reduce Your Investing Costs
There’s no question the cost of buying and selling individual stocks has fallen 
dramatically. If you open an account with an online discount brokerage firm, 
you might expect to pay $10 a trade or less as a trading commission. And cer-
tainly, at $10 a trade, the trading commissions you pay won’t make a big dent 
in your portfolio’s return. 
But many investors make the mistake of assuming the trading commissions 
are the only tolls you pay when you buy and sell individual stocks. Other 
costs include: 
 
✓ Your time: Imagine if you decided to invest $100,000 in 10 different 
stocks using fundamental analysis. And presume that you need to spend 
at least an hour a week researching each stock. If you’re very good, you 
might happen to pick ten great stocks that wind up beating the market 
by two percentage points a year. Sounds great. But that additional return 
works out to $2,000 a year, which means you’ve only made about $4 
an hour for all the work you put in, according to an analysis by Mark 
Hebner of Index Funds Advisors.
 
✓ Research: It’s true you can obtain a vast majority of the data you 
need for fundamental analysis for free. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission, for instance, provides free access to companies’ regulatory 
filings. And there’s no shortage of helpful, free sites that provide funda-
mental data on companies. 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 But if you really get into fundamental analysis, you might be tempted to sub-
scribe to fundamental data and research services that will cost you money.
 
✓ Being wrong: By taking on fundamental analysis, you’re saying you think 
you can outsmart the market. By using your ability to read financial 
statements and make intelligent forecasts, you may load up on shares of 
individual companies. And if you choose correctly, then you may benefit. 
However, being wrong can be costly. Remember that large U.S. stocks, 
on average, gained 9.2% a year between January 1928 and December 
31, 2008, says IFA.com. If you pick the wrong stocks or buy or sell at the 
wrong time, you might sabotage the nearly 10% return you could have 
had for just buying a diversified basket of stocks and holding on. 
 
✓ Tax hits: Buying and selling individual stocks may generate tax events, 
which could eat into your return. You can read more about the role taxes 
play below.
 
While fundamental analysis has its costs, picking your own stocks could 
actually save you money versus investing in actively managed mutual funds. 
Actively managed mutual funds employ professional money managers who 
select stocks and decide when to get in and out. Some of these mutual funds 
charge large fees. These fees, disclosed as part of a mutual fund’s expense 
ratio, can cost you 1% of your investment a year or even more. If you’re con-
vinced you don’t want to put your money in a low-cost index fund, and instead 
are invested in a fund that charges a large expense ratio, it’s possible you 
might save money by picking stocks yourself. 
Getting started with investing
In this book, I assume you’re already familiar 
with setting up a brokerage account or may 
already have a relationship with a broker-
age. But if you don’t already have a brokerage 
account, don’t underestimate the importance of 
this decision. In fact, choosing the right type of 
account to use for investing can be as important 
or even more important than choosing stocks 
using fundamental analysis. 
The first thing you need to decide is whether 
you plan to do your investing from a taxable 
account or a retirement account. When you buy 
and sell stocks in a taxable account, you will 
need to pay attention to rules on capital gains 
and losses. For instance, if you sell a stock for 
a profit inside a taxable account, you may need 
to pay tax on that gain. However, if you trade 
from inside a retirement account, such as an 
individual retirement account or IRA, you may 
defer your gains when you sell winning stocks. 
You’ll also want to make sure you take the 
time to fully investigate what kind of broker-
age firm is right for you. Some brokerage firms 
charge rock-bottom commissions, but you’re 
completely on your own when it comes to han-
dling your accounts. Other firms charge more 
for commissions, but provide you access to 
branch offices and financial advisers, if that’s 
something you’re interested in. 
You can read more about how to choose the 
type of account and brokerage firm that’s right 
for you in my other book, Investing Online For 
Dummies.

 Chapter 22: Ten Things Fundamental Analysis Can’t Do
Protect You from Every Fraud
There’s no question fundamental analysis is one of your biggest shields from 
getting sucked into the next Enron or Sunbeam accounting scandal. As you 
discovered throughout this book, there are tricks and techniques to funda-
mental analysis that help you spot suspicious activity going on at a company. 
And while you may not be able to pinpoint the specifics of a fraud using a 
company’s financial statement, you’ll probably see enough red flags to make 
you suspicious of the company and the way it operates. 
With that said, fundamental analysts must accept, to a certain degree, the 
fact they must take financial statements somewhat at their face value. If a 
company completely fabricates the numbers on the financial statements 
while the board of directors and auditing firm aren’t paying attention, there’s 
only so much a fundamental analyst can do. 
Easily Diversify Your Risk 
over Many Investments
Given the costs of fundamental analysis, discussed above, generally you will 
need to focus your efforts on a few stocks. It’s true that even fundamental 
analysts have tools that allow them to scan many companies. For instance, 
you can sift through thousands of companies’ fundamentals using computer-
ized stock-screening tools, as described in Chapter 17.
But generally speaking, if you’re going to go to the trouble and expense of dig-
ging into the bowels of individual companies, you will likely only be able to 
keep up with so many stocks. In fact, if you own too many stocks, you might 
miss some important fundamental details and derail your success. 
Being concentrated in a few stocks, though, presents risks, too. A big and 
unexpected decline in revenue or earnings at one of the companies you’re 
invested in could depth-charge your returns. Worse yet, a massive decline by 
one of your holdings might make a dent in your portfolio that will be difficult 
to overcome. 
Predict the Future
Fundamentals can be poor indicators of the future. Financial statements are 
backward-looking, meaning they tell you how a company did in the past, not 
necessarily how it will do in the future. 

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The easiest way to understand the lagging nature of fundamentals is by 
studying the collective earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 
500. Fundamental analysis rarely signals a recovery in stock values or the 
economy. In fact, fundamentals continue to deteriorate for an average of five 
months even after the stock market bottoms, according to S&P data. 
Rewind back to October 11, 1990. Stocks had been falling for more than a 
month in what had been a nearly 20% pullback. October 11, 1990, though, was 
the market’s bottom and the beginning of a powerful rally. But you wouldn’t 
have known it by looking at the fundamentals. Companies’ reported earnings 
would remain weak for another 15 months after October 1990. Investors who 
waited for the fundamentals to improve before getting back into the stock 
market would have missed a powerful bull market. 
 
Fundamentals, though, can sometimes be decent predictors. During the bear 
market that ended in October 2002, companies’ earnings actually started to 
heal nine months ahead of the stock market’s bottom, S&P says. This was a 
pretty unusual occurrence, though. Companies’ fundamentals have been poor 
predictors of market and economic recoveries in eight of the past 10 down-
turns, S&P says. 
Make You the Next Warren Buffett
Giving the success Warren Buffett has enjoyed at the helm of Berkshire 
Hathaway, it’s natural to want to take a page from his playbook. And clearly, 
Buffett is a master at using fundamental analysis to identify businesses that 
generate strong returns over the long term. There are many things to be 
learned from Buffett’s long-term and patient approach. 
But don’t assume that just by reading about fundamental analysis, you can 
expect to have the same kind of success. Remember, Buffett has an army 
of analysts to assist him in studying companies. Also, know Buffett’s cache 
allows him to get deals on stocks you, as an individual investor, would never 
get. For instance, in 2008, General Electric gave Buffett the opportunity to 
invest $3 billion in the company and get preferred shares generating 10% 
annual returns. If only you and I could be so lucky. 
Protect You from Your Own Biases
The discipline of fundamental analysis can keep you relatively level-headed 
when it comes to your investing. Instead of blindly following stock tips from 
a neighbor or from a guru on TV, fundamental analysts take the time to do 

339
 Chapter 22: Ten Things Fundamental Analysis Can’t Do
their own due diligence. By scanning through a company’s financials, you can 
get a pretty decent idea of a company’s intrinsic value and how healthy the 
company is. 
And because fundamental analysis is rooted in business and mathematics, 
it portrays a sense of precision. After all, some of the formulas in this book 
might look like something Einstein scrawled on a blackboard. How could 
those lead you astray?
 
There’s still a healthy dose of judgment and estimation that goes into funda-
mental analysis. 
In trend analysis, for instance, it’s up to you to determine whether or not an 
interruption in a company’s long-term earnings track record is a major shift 
or just a short-term blip. And when it comes to valuation, including using the 
discounted cash flow analysis, the answer you get largely depends on assump-
tions that you make. 
Some may say the fact that fundamental analysis allows for human judgment 
makes it more flexible than some sort of computer program that spits out a 
generic opinion on a stock. That’s true. But it’s also important to keep in mind 
that your own biases can work their way into your fundamental analysis. 
Overcome the Danger of Thinking 
You’re Always Right
One of the things that has always surprised me about investors is how most 
assume they’re skilled at choosing stocks, even when they don’t have any fac-
tual basis to believe that. Many investors buy and sell individual stocks, and 
conveniently remember their winners while somehow forgetting about all the 
bum investments they’ve made. 
Fundamental analysis can give some investors, sadly, even more ammunition 
to pad their imaginary stock-picking track records. You might, for instance, 
accurately forecast a company’s future earnings, which is pretty difficult to 
do. You might, in hindsight, applaud your excellent trend analysis, and some-
how forget that you actually lost money on the investment because you over-
paid for the stock. 
And that’s why if you’re going to attempt to pick individual stocks using fun-
damental analysis, you owe it to yourself to also learn how to track your per-
formance. Every year, you should know how to calculate what your portfolio’s 
return was and how much risk you took on in order to achieve that risk. 

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Being able to measure your portfolio’s return and risk and compare it against 
the stock market is critical. If you’re spending lots of time and money search-
ing for stocks, and lagging the stock market, you might want to try a different 
strategy. 
How to measure your portfolio’s return
Measuring your portfolio’s return is pretty straightforward. Assuming you 
didn’t add any fresh cash to the account during the year, simply subtract 
your portfolio’s value at the end of the year from its value at the start of the 
year. Divide that difference by your portfolio’s value at the beginning of the 
year and multiply by 100, and voila, that’s your percentage gain for the year. 
Table 22-1 provides a simple example of returns. 
Table 22-1 
Here’s a Sample Portfolio
Quarter ended
Portfolio value
December 2008
$10,000
March 2009
$10,050
June 2009
$10,500
September 2009
$10,501
December 2009
$11,000
Using Table 22-1, you would measure your portfolio’s return this way: 
($11,000 – $10,000) / $10,000 = 0.10. Multiply by 100 to convert the answer 
into a percentage, or 10%. That is your annual return.
 
Be sure to compare the return of your portfolio to that of the Standard & 
Poor’s 500 or another stock market index to find out if you’re beating, or get-
ting beaten by, the market. 
How to measure your portfolio’s risk
Putting a number on your portfolio’s risk is a little trickier than measuring 
your return. You’ll need to figure out how volatile your returns are using a 
statistical measure called standard deviation. 
To calculate your portfolio’s standard deviation, you will first need to tabulate 
the percentage changes for each period. You can do this analysis based on any 

341
 Chapter 22: Ten Things Fundamental Analysis Can’t Do
period of time, but since Table 22-1 is quarterly, you can practice with that. You 
just use the formula above and calculate the returns for each quarter. When 
you’re done, you’ll see a table that looks like what you see in Table 22-2.
Table 22-2 
Sample Portfolio of Returns
Quarter ended
Return
March 2009
0.5%
June 2009
4.5%
September 2009
0.01%
December 2009
4.8%
Lastly, you’ll need to calculate the standard deviation. If you want to under-
stand the gory details of standard deviation and how to calculate it by hand, 
check out Statistics For Dummies (Wiley). 
Otherwise, you’ll want to enter the row and columns into Microsoft Excel just 
as you see it in Table 22-2. You can then use the “=stdev” function. For more 
help on ways to use your computer to calculate standard deviation, espe-
cially when returns are negative, that’s also covered in Investing Online For 
Dummies (Wiley). 
 
If you have an HP 12C financial calculator, you can enter each return followed 
by the Sigma + key. When you’re done entering all the returns, press the g key 
and the s key to see your portfolio’s quarterly standard deviation. The answer 
you get is 2.55 percentage points. 
You’re almost done. You must now convert the quarterly standard deviation 
into an annualized number. You do that by multiplying the period’s standard 
deviation by the square root of the number of periods in a year. Yikes, I know. 
But in this case, since you are measuring quarterly standard deviation, there 
are four quarters in a year. That means you take the square root of 4, which 
is 2. So to convert your quarterly standard deviation to an annualized figure, 
just multiply the 2.55 standard deviation by 2. 
Sizing up your portfolio’s risk and return
Just knowing your portfolio’s return and risk doesn’t tell you much. It’s 
important to compare those data with a benchmark, or a set of investments 
that you want to size yourself up against. The IFA Risk and Return Calculator 
(www.ifa.com/portfolios/PortReturnCalc/index.aspx) lets you 

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
see the returns and standard deviations of several measures of stocks to see 
how you’re doing. 
Be careful of drawing too much from just one year. Don’t assume that if you 
had one good year your luck will continue. 
If all these measurements just give you a headache, but you still want to 
see how you’re doing with fundamental analysis, there are Web sites that 
do much of the crunching for you. A few performance tracking sites include 
RiskGrades (www.riskgrades.com), Icarra (www.icarra.com), and 
Stockalicious (www.stockalicious.com).
