Foreword
A definition of the main subject of this book, electronic warfare, is “a set of mea-
sures and actions performed by the conflicting sides to detect and electronically 
attack enemy electronic systems for the control of forces and weapons, as well as 
to electronically defend one’s own electronic systems and other targets.” Electronic 
warfare (EW) was first applied in an extensive manner during the Second World 
War, mainly to defeat new electronic instruments such as radar and identification 
friend or foe (IFF) proving to be very effective, especially in night operations. A 
well-known example is the passive, most secret anti-radar technique then called 
Window ( by Allied forces) or Düppel (by German forces), and now called Chaff, 
first—and very successfully—used on 24 June 1943 during the night bombing raids 
on Hamburg to disturb the main sensor of the German air defense, which was the 
54-cm Würzburg radar.
EW is aimed to negate or at least reduce the effectiveness of a wide class of 
enemy systems, not only radar but also infrared sensors/seekers, radio communi-
cations and navigation equipment. Therefore, today’s EW systems are essential to 
protect all military platforms when operating in hostile environments.
 A vast topic such as EW can be treated in many ways that can be roughly cat-
egorized either as “top-down” or as “bottom-up” approaches, depending on the 
main starting point: operations and system architectures, the former, and technol-
ogy, the latter. The former choice has been rather natural to the author, Dr. Ing. An-
drea A. De Martino, an internationally well-known scientist and systems engineer 
with more than two decades of experience in radar systems analysis, evaluation, 
and design; as well as two decades of experience in the EW domain. He is presently 
Chief Technology Officer of one of the main (third in the world’s rank) companies 
in this area, the Italy-based Elettronica S.p.A.
Dr. De Martino’s book starts with operational aspects and scenarios, analyzes 
their relevant emitters and their signals, continues with the topics of emitter detec-
tion and classification/identification as well as the very demanding aspect of preci-
sion emitter location and ends with the different electronic measures used against 
the hostile emitter/platform. Some basic, needed elements are suitably dealt with 
in four Appendixes, i.e.: signal detection, estimation theory and methods, array 
antennas, analog modulation; a fifth appendix treats the effects of jamming in fre-
quency shift keying radio.
Such an organization makes the book of interest to both operational and tech-
nical people, probably with more emphasis on this latter class of readers. As a 

xii

Foreword
matter of fact, there are significant aspects of this book that provide real added val-
ue compared to others published on the same topic until about ten years ago. The 
first is the genuine system engineering approach, as discussed before. The second is 
the updated treatment of the most recent (and powerful) methods, techniques and 
technologies for EW systems (such as: phased array antennas for both reception 
and jamming, digital RF memories, signal acquisition by direct RF /IF sampling, 
fast digital signal processors, and advanced detection and estimation techniques for 
emitters identification and localization, including the low-probability-of-intercept 
techniques). The third and last benefit is the thoroughness of the text, with detailed 
and deep discussions of items not frequently treated in most EW books. These 
topics include the intercept and jamming of radio communications, of infrared sys-
tems, of laser systems, as well as the electronic actions against the main weapons 
of the so-called asymmetric warfare, i.e. against the improvised explosive devices 
(IED), and portable weapons (man pads, rocket propelled grenades).
To conclude, I’m pleased to welcome this significant and very useful addition 
to the technical literature, and expect it will benefit EW engineers and users, as well 
the broader group of operators and designers in the electronic defense, and attack 
arena.

Introduction
Modern warfare is largely based on electronic systems (such as sensors, actuators, 
communications equipment, data processors and displays) which constitute the 
bulk of the information operation system and of the weapon systems.
Information is essential to successfully accomplish any military mission, both 
defensive as well as offensive, and to ensure the survivability of one’s own human 
resources and assets/weapons.
Information operation is performed through the acquisition, transmission, 
storage of information and data in order to understand the enemy’s intentions, and 
to make the right decisions about subsequent actions involving the use of weapons 
and human resources. The above cited process is represented by the so-called Ob-
serve-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop that is required to be performed as quickly 
as possible to gain superiority with respect to the enemy.
Weapon systems effectiveness is completely dependent on the identification of 
the target/threat and the provision of its position and kinematics data with high 
accuracies, all provided by the electronic eystems.
Within the above systems is electronic warfare (EW) playing an important role 
in modern warfare as the passive components of those systems can enhance the 
acquired information about the emitter threat by adding its identity, achieving an 
excellent situation awareness, while the active components of those systems can 
dispense countermeasures according to an optimized strategy, both for the protec-
tion of one’s own military human resources and assets as well as for offensive ac-
tions against enemy defenses.
This book focuses on modern EW Systems and is composed of six chapters.
Chapter 1 describes both the symmetric and asymmetric conflict scenario. In 
the first scenario all the threats to own assets (i.e. the weapon systems of ground, 
air, space and sea surface platforms, such as missiles and guns) are driven by elec-
tronic sensor systems (such as radars and/or IR/EO sensors). In the second scenario 
the threats are constituted by terrorist troops/snipers and small weapons such as 
short range IR missiles and improvised explosive devices (IED). In both scenarios 
the EW systems have the tasks of threat detection and their countering, although 
it will be shown that they are quite different in terms of frequency band and type.
Chapter 2 deals with the evolution of the signal emitters (to address how mod-
ern systems such as Radar, RF and Laser guided weapons, and communications 
equipment differ from those in the past) and IR/EO sensors, which both consti-

tute threats of the symmetric conflict scenario and also partially of the asymmetric 
conflict scenario.
In Chapter 3 the main challenges of the Passive EW RF Band Systems, called 
electronic support measure (ESM) are discussed through a description of the re-
quirements and the increased performances of the novel passive EW equipment 
architectures, based on high speed digital processing solutions with respect to the 
recent equipment architectures
Chapter 4 deals with the modern RF direction finding (DF) and emitter loca-
tion techniques and technologies, as employed in ESM systems.
Chapters 5and 6 deal respectively with the modern RF and IR active counter-
measure equipment requirements, architecture and employed technologies (such as 
digital RF memories [DRFM] and solid state active wide band phased arrays) and 
with the main generic (i.e. effective against many types of similar threats) counter-
measure techniques against both RF active equipment (radars, RF missile seeker 
heads and communication equipment) as well as IR/EO missile seeker heads.
The appendixes provide brief introductory concepts about signal detection in 
sensor receivers (Appendix 1), estimation theory to assess sensor measurement ac-
curacies (Appendix 2), antennas and phased arrays employed in RF equipment 
(Appendix 3), analog modulation methods employed in communication system 
(Appendix 4) and evaluation of the bit error rate (BER) increase for noise and CW 
tone jamming in communication systems employing BFSK modulation(Appendix 
5).

Introduction to Electronic Warfare 
Scenarios
1.1  Definitions and EW Role in the Military Field
The formal military terminology [1] defines electronic warfare (EW) as a military 
action whose objective is control of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). This ob-
jective is achieved through offensive electronic attack (EA), defensive electronic 
protection (EP), intelligence gathering and threat recognition electronic warfare 
support (ES) actions. These current definitions give each function a broader scope 
with respect to terminology used previously, which was, respectively, electronic 
countermeasures (ECM), electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), and elec-
tronic warfare support measures (ESM).
The new EA function definition includes, in addition to the previous ECM 
function, the use of direct energy weapons (DEWs), antiradiation missiles (ARM), 
and electromagnetic and nuclear pulses (EMP and NEMP) to destroy enemy elec-
tronic equipment.
The new EP function definition includes, in addition to the previous ECCM 
function, the use of electromagnetic emissions control (EMCON), the electromag-
netic hardening of electronic equipment, EW frequency conflict removal, and com-
munications security (COMSEC) actions.
The new ES function definition is not very different from the previous ESM 
definition as both include near-real-time threat recognition in support of immediate 
decisions relevant to EA, EP, weapon avoidance, and targeting actions.
The classification of the EW functions is shown in Figure 1.1.
EW is one of the military actions of command and control (C2) warfare, whose 
objective is to obtain C2 superiority by breaking the connectivity of the adversary 
C2, thus leading to success in military operations. C2 systems are, in fact, the links 
through which the commanders’ decisions, based on the information and intel-
ligence that flow through those systems, are communicated to battlefield forces. 
A C2 system is a network of nodes, each consisting of a number of subsystems, 
such as sensors, navigation systems, command and data fusion centers, and com-
munication links. A critical node is an element whose disruption or destruction

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
immediately degrades the ability of a C2 system to effectively conduct combat 
operations.
C2 warfare (C2W) consists of five military actions, which are integrated in 
both C2 protection and C2 attack actions:
•• Operation security (OPSEC);
•• EW;
•• Psychological operations (PSYOPS);
•• Military deception;
•• Physical destruction.
Usually OPSEC and military deception are most effective during the so-called 
“competitive phase,” which is the introductory phase to a military conflict, but all 
five actions are essential to war.
OPSEC is the process of denying the enemy any information about our own 
capabilities and intentions by controlling and hiding information about our mili-
tary planning. PSYOPS is a planned process of conveying influential messages to 
enemy groups in order to convince them to perform actions that are beneficial to 
own forces.
Deception operations are meant to degrade the accuracy of hostile intelligence 
gathering, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) so that 
the adversary will draw misleading conclusions about our forces’ capabilities and 
disposition.
EW supports deception operations with electromagnetic deception on intel-
ligence collection, communications, and radar systems. 
Physical destruction of a critical node is the most desired and effective option. It 
involves the use of weapons and of targeting and battle damage assessment (BDA) 
functions, which are usually accomplished by electronic and optical imagery equip-
ment. EA also participates in the destruction process by the use of ARMs against

radar and communication sources and by DEWs in the disruption or burnout of 
adversary electronic equipment.
In conclusion, in the military field (and namely in the C2W framework), EW 
plays an important role in that EA supports C2W attacks for combat operations, 
EP contributes to C2W protection against enemy electronic attacks, and ES pro-
vides information that can be used to plan our own C2 attacks and to assess battle 
damage of the involved sites, thus providing feedback on the effectiveness of the 
C2W plan.
Section 1.2 gives a brief description of the principles of operation of the main 
weapons systems that are driven by electronic sensors and, thus, potentially prone 
to EW actions. We then discuss EW applications during symmetric conflicts (Sec-
tion 1.3) and asymmetric conflicts (Section 1.4).
1.2  Main Weapons Systems of Interest to EW
The armed forces of each country and its alliances are usually comprised of at least 
three main groups: army, navy, and air force (marines are considered here to be a 
navy army), each tasked with different missions with respect to the defense of the 
country/alliance territory and to any war actions in enemy foreign territories. In the 
execution of those missions, the armed forces have at their disposal a number of 
different platforms employing weapons systems, such as munitions, guns, and mis-
siles, whose task is the destruction of enemy assets. 
Destruction of enemy assets is preferably accomplished from a distance in or-
der to prevent any harm to our own assets: The larger the distance, the safer our 
own assets, because the probability of effective retaliation by the enemy is reduced. 
Modern weapons are being conceived to reach targets at ever longer ranges and to 
cover such distances at ever higher speeds, so as to reduce the time for an effective 
enemy defensive reaction, thus increasing the probability of success of the weapon. 
The provision that the weapons systems have sufficient aiming accuracy at long 
distances is ensured by electromagnetic sensors (with electronic equipment) that 
detect and accurately track targets at long distances, thus allowing for accurate 
bombing and accurate guidance of artillery fire or missiles toward the target. A 
pictorial representation of the various air attack to ground assets is reported in 
Figure 1.2 [2].
The air force mission is to ensure air/space superiority and air defense over 
the territories of interest. The accomplishment of those tasks is performed by an 
integrated air defense system (IADS) comprised of a number of assets, such as the 
following:
•• An air defense system, composed of ground and airborne early warning ra-
dars, C2 centers for surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and antiaircraft artillery 
(AAA) for defense of important sites and airports;
•• Air superiority (or counter-air) fighter aircraft (A/C);
•• Intruder/strike A/C.

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
The objective of EW is to control the EMS in order to gain superiority for our 
own armed forces and to operate against enemy sensors, both by locating them 
and by performing actions aimed at reducing their performance. This is done by 
amplifying the enemy’s problems and limits in order to dilute the effectiveness (i.e., 
the kill probability) of their associated weapons systems.
In the brief notes that follow, the operating principles of the main weapons 
systems are discussed. A detailed discussion about their operation and the limits of 
their driving sensors is deferred to Chapter 2.
The main weapons systems employed by the armed forces are of the following 
types:
1.	 Early warning surveillance systems, either ground/shipboard or airborne. 
Early warning systems consist of long-range (in excess of 400 km) surveil-
lance radars mainly operating in the lower radar RF band (from 100 to 
3,500 MHz).
2.	 Missiles systems of various types:
•	 Antiaircraft SAMs;
•	 Antiaircraft AAMs;
•	 Antiship or antiground value target missiles, either launched from the air 
(ASM) or from the surface (SSM).
	
All the above types of missiles can be guided either by radar or by an in-
frared (IR) seeker in accordance with the stand-off range (i.e., the range of 
the flight from the launch platform; IR-guided missiles usually have short-
er ranges than the radar-guided ones). Antiship missiles are mostly radar 
guided, but some have hybrid guidance (radar + IR). Additional types of 
missiles are:

•	 Antitank systems, mostly wire or IR laser guided, but some guided by 
millimeter-wave (MMW) radars,
•	 Antiradiation missiles (ARM);
•	 Ballistic missiles (types of attack capabilities are shown in Figure 1.3).
	
Typical ranges of the various types of missiles are reported in Figure 1.4.
3.	 Artillery systems, such as radar-guided AAA.
4.	 Precision guided munitions against tanks or buildings, consisting of projec-
tiles guided by optical/IR trackers and laser range finders.

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
5.	 Communication networks, which are the backbone of all military opera-
tions, providing combat situation information to the C2 and handling com-
mands from it.
1.2.1  Artillery Systems
Artillery systems usually consist of guns of various calibers that shoot projectiles 
against fixed or mobile targets and are driven by commands from a fire control 
system (FCS). The FCS computes the projectile trajectory to the target on the basis 
of target parameters, projectile and gun parameters, and atmospheric conditions.
For mobile targets, usually aircraft, the AAA fire control system is provided 
with tracking radar that, on receipt of a 2-D data (dimensions: range and azimuth) 
designation from surveillance radar, starts an acquisition search at the elevation of 
the designated target. As soon as the target is acquired, the tracking radar continu-
ously provides the FCS with accurate 3-D (range, azimuth, and elevation) target 
coordinates, which allow it to determine the kinematics data of the target. With 
these data and from an extrapolation of the target’s trajectory, we can determine 
the interception point of the fired projectile with the target as shown in Figure 1.5.
A number of shots must be fired in order to achieve the required kill probabil-
ity. During the shooting period, the tracking radar measures the miss distances of 
Figure 1.5  Intercept point on the target trajectory of an AAA engagement.

1.2  Main Weapons Systems of Interest to EW

the shot projectiles from the aircraft in order to enable the FCS to correct the gun’s 
aim and the computed projectile’s trajectory. In the case of a successful hit, the 
tracking radar also provides the kill assessment of the target engagement.
The kill probability of the AAA is mainly dependent on the measurement accu-
racy of the target kinematics and trajectory data as provided by the tracking radar 
and somewhat dependent on the lethal radius of the projectile.
1.2.2  Missile Systems
Artillery systems are very effective at short ranges, when target kinematics and tra-
jectory measurement are quite accurate (especially if the target is not maneuvering) 
and the flight time of the projectile is also short. For long ranges, which require a 
longer projectile flight time, the target gains the opportunity to invalidate the com-
puted interception point by performing a moderate maneuver.
The increases intercept point range is achieved by missiles that belong to two 
classes: those that attack fixed locations using inertial or global positioning system 
(GPS) guidance up to the target [ballistic missiles and terrain contour matching 
(TERCOM)], and those that are guided to a moving target even if the target is ma-
neuvering during the engagement period (i.e., guided missiles).
The latter class of missiles has, in turn, two subclasses, which differ in terms 
of the type of guidance employed: command guidance or seeker guidance. Indeed, 
a missile can be guided to its target by being commanded either by a remote sen-
sor (radar, IR, or EO head), which tracks the target and the missile, or by a sensor 
(called a seeker) internal to the missile. 
A guided missile is constituted [3] by an airframe usually consisting of the fol-
lowing equipment:
•• Either a receiver that demodulates the command data transmitted by the 
remote sensor or 
•• a seeker (radar, IR, or EO head), enclosed in an ogival radome/IR dome, 
which tracks the target and generates the command signals to the guidance 
system.
•• A warhead containing the explosive material used to damage the target. The 
explosive material is usually ignited by a proximity fuse, which allows the 
target to be hit anywhere within the warhead’s lethal radius. 
•• A guidance system or autopilot that converts the command signals from the 
seeker into the positions of the control fins, hence guiding the missile toward 
the interception point with the target.
•• An engine, fueled by propellant, which provides the thrust to the missile and 
feeds the power supply needed by both the seeker and the guidance system.
A schematic representation of a missile and of its seeker/guidance operation is 
shown in Figure 1.6.
Missile weapons systems have search radar that reports to a C2 in case of 
ground or shipboard systems, or to the main computer in the airborne case, which 
evaluates the threat and designates the tracking radar and associated missile

launcher of the weapons systems, which is usually able to launch multiple missiles 
in a quick sequence. 
Missile systems are of various types, from the very-long-range ballistic missiles 
and long-range cruise missile systems designed to attack fixed locations in enemy 
territory, to the local-area medium- to long-range (50- to 150-km) missile systems 
designed to defend a relatively wide area (both at ground and at sea) and to the me-
dium- to short-range (5- to 50-km) battlefield missile systems designed to defend/
attack high-value targets such as ships, airfields, and military ground assets.
Missiles can employ many different guidance systems, from short-range com-
mand and beam-riding guidance to medium- to long-range semiactive and active 
homing missiles. Very-long-range and long-range missiles usually employ active 
homing only in the terminal part of their flight to the target; during the rest of their 
course they are guided by an inertial or satellite navigation system or by recorded 
terrain data.
Command missiles are guided by commands transmitted from the command 
link of the ground/shipboard missile weapons systems, which is provided with two 
tracking radars: a target tracking radar (TTR) and a missile tracking radar (MTR). 
The missile is usually provided with a beacon in order to ease the tracking of the

MTR. The two tracking radars are managed by a common C2 center that evalu-
ates the data received from them and computes the commands to be sent to the 
missile. The use of two independent tracking radars ensures that the best possible 
trajectory-to-target interception is selected for the missile. Alternative command 
guidance is constituted by a single tracker for both the target and the missile. In this 
case, called command-to-line of sight (CLOS), the missile has to stay always within 
the radar beam aimed at the target.
Because the angular target tracking accuracy σθ is a fraction of the radar beam-
width θB (usually σθ = 0.01 to 0.05 θB), the miss distance md from the target of the 
missile, which is supposed to be aligned with the radar boresight, increases with the 
distance R of the target from the tracking radar, that is, md = Rσθ. For this reason 
command missiles are used for short ranges. The advantages of these systems are 
that the missile is a simple one and that the available high effective radiated power 
(ERP) of the tracking radars employed on ground/ships provides a good ECCM 
feature.
Beam-riding missiles have an on-board receiver that senses whether or not the 
missile is aligned with the tracking radar boresight and provides that data to the 
missile guidance system, which commands the missile to stay aligned with it. As 
shown in Figure 1.7, the missile is forced to follow a trajectory that requires strong 
accelerations in the terminal phase of the engagement even in the absence of target 
maneuvers. Therefore, this type of missile guidance is mostly exploited against 
slow nonmaneuvering targets, for which only weak accelerations are required.
Semiactive homing missiles are provided with an RF seeker that has a receiver 
capable of passively tracking in angles the scattered signal from a target when 
this is illuminated by a powerful continuous wave (CW) or interrupted continuous 
wave (ICW) tracking radar. The advantage of this type of missile is the absence of 
an onboard transmitter, which is usually quite expensive. This type of missile, simi-
lar to the active pulse Doppler (PD) missile, has the ability to discriminate between 
the target and clutter by using Doppler frequency signal processing. The angle 
tracking signals are processed within a very narrow bandwidth (on the order of 1 
kHz, thus also achieving a high receiver sensitivity), which is positioned at the Dop-
pler frequency fd relevant to the closing speed vc (i.e., fd = 2vc/λ = 2(vt + vm)/λ, where

target.

λ is the transmitted wavelength and vt and vm are, respectively, the projections of 
the target and missile speeds along the target–missile line, as shown in Figure 1.8.
The missile angular tracking accuracy in the terminal phase of the engagement 
no longer depends on the distance from the tracking/illuminator radar because the 
seeker is now close to the target. Because there is no more need for the missile to 
stay within the illuminator beam, the missile can exploit the proportional guidance, 
which is depicted in Figure 1.9.
The missile is launched toward the predicted interception point, while the 
seeker antenna tracks the target. With reference to Figure 1.7, in which the missile 
engagement with the target is reported and the angle parameters are defined, we 
can show that the correction commands to the missile velocity vector (i.e., only a 
lateral acceleration alm, as the missile is flying at constant velocity vm in modulus) 
are applied only through its rotation rate dγ/dt, which is made proportional to the 
measured rotation rate of the seeker boresight dα/dt in accordance with the select-
ed navigation constant (dimensionless) N = k(vt/vm), where vt is the target velocity 
and k is a constant (usually assumed to be between 2 and 4):

which means that the lateral acceleration impressed to the missile is proportional to 
the target lateral acceleration alt . With this type of guidance, no lateral acceleration 
is impressed on the missile in order to intercept a target flying on a constant course. 
So the full available acceleration of the missile can be spared and impressed on the 
missile only in the case of an evasive maneuver by the target. This ability provides 
the missile with a longer intercept range and available residual acceleration in the 
terminal phase of the engagement with the target.
Semiactive missile systems are very effective and constitute the majority of the 
medium- to long-range SAM population. The major disadvantage of this type of 
guidance is that constant target illumination is required during the entire time of 
flight of the missile, which can be dangerous in the case of an air-to-air engagement 
because the launching platform has to keep on the approach to the target, thus 
becoming subject to possible retaliation from enemy aircraft.
1.2.3  Active Homing Missiles 
Active homing missiles are provided with a seeker that is a complete tracking radar; 
that is, it is equipped with a transmitter that can engage its target autonomously 
without any further assistance from the launch platform. For this reason it is called 
a “fire-and-forget” missile.

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
Medium- to long-range active homing missiles are provided with a dual guid-
ance system: an inertial or command guidance in the first phase of the flight toward 
the target, which is then switched to active homing proportional guidance on the 
target on arrival at some distance from the target. 
Due to the presence of a transmitter of this type, the missile is quite expensive.
1.2.4  Track via Missile Systems 
Track via missile (TVM) systems [4] employ a mix of command and semiactive 
missile guidance principles in order to achieve improved medium- to long-range 
performance at a reasonable cost. 
They require a ground illuminator and a semiactive radar sensor on board the 
missile. However, the angular tracking data are not processed within the missile; 
they are instead sent via a downlink to a powerful central processor at the launch 
platform on the ground. Here the trajectory data of both the target and missile are 
processed, and accurate guidance commands are sent back to the missile via an 
uplink.
Modern systems use multifunction radar based on phased array technology 
(Patriot, PAAMS, etc.), which provides them with the ability to engage many tar-
gets simultaneously, regardless of which type of missile is use: semiactive and TVM 
(with the use of ICW illuminators), active seeker, or command guidance. A single 
missile system provided with a phased array fire control radar may launch and 
track simultaneously in time-sharing mode many missiles against several different 
targets. In the case of semiactive and TVM guidance, the phased array fire control 
radar illuminates the targets in ICW mode, thus providing both tracking of the 
target and the missile as well as target illumination. This type of weapons systems 
is shown in Figure 1.10.
Figure 1.10  A TVM weapons systems.

1.2.5  Passive IR-Guided Missiles 
Passive IR-guided missiles are provided with an IR seeker that autonomously tracks 
the heat signature of the target and provides commands to the proportional naviga-
tion guidance system during its approach to the target. Thus they also are of the 
“fire-and-forget” type.
These types of missiles are extensively used both as medium-range AAMs, due 
to the relatively lower propagation attenuation at high altitude and their high ma-
neuverability (because they are lightweight), and also as short-range SAMs, due to 
the higher propagation attenuation at low altitude. They are most often portable 
and shoulder-launched missiles (in fact, they are called MANPADs) for the defense 
of ground troops and armored vehicles (and, unfortunately, in current periods, also 
by terrorists).
Descriptions of the various types of IR seekers are discussed in Section 2.6 of 
Chapter 2.
1.2.6  Sea-Skimming Missiles 
This type of active homing missile is dedicated to ship attacks and flies at a very low 
altitude over the sea surface as if it is skimming the waves. It can be launched from 
long distances either from aircraft or ships/littoral sites and is usually provided with 
a dual guidance system (inertial along the cruise phase and active homing on the 
target during the terminal phase) in the horizontal plane and with an altimeter to 
keep a constant height in the vertical plane. A pictorial representation of maritime 
missile attacks is reported in Figure 1.11.
Ship targets present both a problem and an advantage for these missiles. The 
problem is constituted by the large angular glint fluctuations (see Section 2.3.8 
Figure 1.11  Types of maritime missile attacks.

14

of Chapter 2) produced by the extended length of the ship that require robust 
angular data filtering to smooth them. The advantage is constituted by the large 
ship’s radar cross section (RCS), which provides large target returns that exceed the 
sea clutter ones, thus allowing the missile seeker to operate in superclutter condi-
tions [i.e., with a high signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) and signal-to-clutter (S/C) 
power ratio on a single radar pulse].These conditions permit the use of large car-
rier frequency pulse-to-pulse agile radar waveforms with very short pulse widths, 
which constitutes a big challenge to the ECM ship defenses (as discussed in Section 
6.2 of Chapter 6).
1.2.7  Antiradiation Missiles 
An antiradiation missile (ARM) is provided with a passive seeker that is similar 
to a small wideband superheterodyne ESM receiver (see Section 3.4 of Chapter 
3), which is capable of acquiring and tracking in angles the signal transmitted by 
a selected surface radar or communication source and to home on it with high 
precision. ARMs are mostly of the ASM type and are installed on board aircraft 
dedicated to the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions.
The ARM seeker is cued by the airborne ESM system of the A/C, which, upon 
interception, identification, and location of the victim radar, provides the ARM 
with all of the emitter data and verifies that the ARM is locked on to that emitter.
Once launched, the ARM seeker, through the use of highly accurate phase 
direction-finding (DF) antennas, computes from the received emitter signals (in a 
similar way as for the active homing missiles) the angular commands to be sent to 
the guidance system in order to home on the victim radar.
The ARM is a typical example of a stand-off “fire-and-forget” weapon because 
it can be launched from long distances without any further assistance from the 
launching platform. Many ARMs have been developed that cover the complete 
radar bands from 0.5 to 18 GHz. The only protective actions that the victim radar 
can use are to stop transmitting (this does not, however, ensure survival as the mis-
sile can home on it on the basis of memorized coordinates) or to activate nearby 
decoy transmitters that emit waveforms similar to those of the victim radar.

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
In this section we expand on the description of the EW (ES, EA and EP) actions 
that play an important role in C2W. 
C2W depends on all sources: timely intelligence about the adversary’s capabili-
ties, objectives, and operational concepts. Intelligence sources are the means used 
to provide such information. Signal intelligence (SIGINT), an ES function, is one of 
those sources. SIGINT systems collect, analyze, identify and locate emitter signals 
throughout the entire communications and radar band. Usually they are composed 
of two dedicated systems: COMINT and ELINT.
Communications intelligence (COMINT) systems are concerned with the activ-
ity detection, collection, classification, identification, and DF of communications 
systems (both voice and digital), data links, satellite communications, and cellular 
phones. Location of emitters for real-time targeting is usually performed through 
signal time differential of arrival (TDOA) and differential Doppler frequency (DD) 
techniques applied in a multiple aircraft systems [5]. 
Electronic intelligence (ELINT) systems measure direction and time of arrival 
(DOA and TOA) along with all of the radar waveform signature parameters, such 
as carrier frequency, pulse width, signal bandwidth, and pulse repetition interval. 
These data are used both to upgrade the database on the adversary’s radars and their 
associated weapons systems, called ELINT parameters limits (EPLs), and to provide, 
after comparison with the data in the database, the electronic order of battle (EOB), 
that is, the disposition of the adversary’s weapons systems on his territory. The EPLs 
are provided to our own ESM equipment in order to allow emitter identification 
whenever they come in contact with them. Emitter location is accomplished through 
the methods described in Chapter 4, which include triangulation, trilateration, with 
time difference on arrival (TDOA), and frequency difference on arrival (FDOA).
ES is largely present in the C2W in the form of radar warning receivers or ESM 
on board aircraft to warn them of the presence and direction of radar threats. 
EA is usually performed by aircraft penetrating the adversary’s territory for 
SEAD purposes or by ships and ground assets during self-protection or mutual 
protection actions against an air attack.
The adversary’s territory is usually protected by an IADS made up of surveil-
lance, acquisition, and tracking radars, the latter providing the guidance to the 
weapons systems (AAA and missiles) as described in the previous section. A typical 
EW scenario during symmetric conflicts and its relevance to multirole A/C is shown 
in Figure 1.12.
EA performed by aircraft penetrating the adversary’s territory against search 
radars is performed either with jamming, with the goal of preventing or delaying 
their target designation to the associated weapons systems, or with ARMs, with the 
goal of destroying the radar. Common jamming modes are discussed next.
Active self-protection jamming (SPJ) is performed either by noise jamming, 
with the purpose of denying range, velocity, and angle information about its plat-
form, or by the generation of a large number of false targets, with the purpose of 
producing confusion to both the radar operator and the automatic detection and 
tracking processing system.
Chaff is launched to effect jamming. Chaff consists of a large volume cloud 
composed of thousands of elemental radar reflectors that provide a very large 
amount of volume radar reflection with respect to the echo of the protected air-
craft, thus preventing target detection. Chaff effects may persist for a relatively 

1.3  EW in Symmetric Conflicts 
17
long time (tens of minutes). Because chaff is relatively inexpensive, it is one of the 
most used EA techniques. A Typical SPJ operation is shown in Figure 1.13.
Support jamming (also called mutual protection) includes stand-off jamming 
(SOJ); escort jamming (EJ), which usually operates in the search radar antenna’s 
sidelobe region, as shown in Figure 1.14 or stand-in jamming (SIJ), which has the 
same purpose as the SPJ but applies to the entire raid of intruders. 
Support jamming can employ noise jamming, deceptive electronic counter-
measures, or deployment of corridors of chaff. SOJ missions are conducted by an

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
aircraft loitering outside the lethal zones of hostile weapons systems in order to 
hide the radar echoes of the friendly intruder aircraft, thus preventing their expo-
sure to the hostile fire of air defense systems triggered by the designation from the 
search radar.
EJ missions are conducted by aircraft that accompany the intruders as they 
penetrate the enemy’s territory. As the EJ aircraft is penetrating the combat zone, it 
is vulnerable to enemy weapons and needs to be provided with self-protection jam-
ming capabilities like those of the intruders. EJ aircraft are generally used when the 
intruder aircraft does not have a sufficient payload to protect itself.
EJ missions are usually conducted by multiple EJ aircraft, widely spaced among 
them, in order to provide confusion in the enemy’s defense systems, which are 
trying to determine the intruder attack direction through jamming strobes. The 
confusion that is generated helps in delaying the air defense system response, thus 
increasing the probability of success of the intruder attack.
SIJ missions are conducted by unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), 
which come nearer to the victim radars and exploit a lower jamming power to 
perform the same mission as the EJs. 
EA performed by aircraft penetrating the adversary’s territory is used primarily 
against target tracking radars (TTRs),which are used to guide the weapons systems 
(both defensive as well offensive) by locking on to the target and providing accu-
rate direction (i.e., azimuth and elevation), range, and velocity data. The velocity 
data are used to predict the future position of the target and to point the weapon to 
the lead direction (as shown earlier in Figure 1.5). EA against TTRs is performed 
in a manner similar to that used for the search radars with jamming and ARM 
launches.
Figure 1.14  Intruder aircraft attack with intruders supported by SOJ, EJ, or SIJ.

1.3  EW in Symmetric Conflicts

SPJ ECM systems are employed to counter the tracking radar through the use 
of deception techniques (DECM) that attempt to cause the tracking radar to break 
lock. Noise jamming is rarely employed against missiles, because most seeker heads 
can track the ECM radiation in angles (track-on jam), which is sufficient for many 
types of missiles (e.g., the semiactive missile) to lock on the target.
Illustrations of intruder aircraft attacks on an enemy’s highly defended terri-
tory are shown in Figures 1.13 and 1.14 for, respectively, attack with intruders only 
provided with SPJ and with intruders supported by SOJ, EJ, or SIJ.
EA is also performed by ships when attacked by air raids or by sea-skimming 
missiles. In the first case noise and deception jamming are performed in order to 
deny range and position information, thus preventing either the launch of ASMs 
or an accurate bomb release. In the latter case a combination of noise jamming, 
launch of chaff, and deception jamming is performed in conjunction with the ship’s 
close-in weapons systems (CIWS) operation to divert the missile from the ship or 
to destroy it.
EA is performed in a similar way for a ship (with the exception of chaff launch-
es) in the defense
of ground assets against air raids with launch of RF-guided ASMs or ARMs.
EA is also performed against communications networks in C2W operations. 
The primary objective in military communications jamming is to disrupt the net-
work communication links so as to separate the C2 from its asset nodes. EA in the 
communication bands is conducted against combat net radios, tactical data links, 
and military satellite communications.
Combat radio nets, which provide short- and medium-range voice communi-
cations in the 30- to 88-MHz VHF band and operate with digital messages in the 
frequency hopping (FH) mode, can be somewhat jammed with broadband noise 
jamming or frequency-follower jamming.
Tactical data links are used to provide connectivity among distributed ground, 
sea, and air mobile nodes. They are conceived to be nodeless, which means that 
no communication center is needed because all users transmit to everyone else and 
operate in very fast FH mode, thus preventing frequency-follower jamming. Only 
tone jamming can have some effect, as will be discussed in Chapter 6.
Satellite communication systems (SATCOMs) provide worldwide connectivity 
at high data rates among forces that are quite distant from each other. Old SAT-
COMs operate in the UHF band (250 to 400 MHz). More recent SATCOMs oper-
ate in the SHF band (7 to 8 GHz) or EHF band (20 to 44 GHz).
UHF communications have the advantage of using a simple antenna that can 
be easily installed in mobile platforms such as aircraft, small ships, and small land 
vehicles. But because of the large antenna beamwidth they can be easily disturbed 
by ground jammers. SHF and EHF communications are harder to jam, and only 
tone jamming can provide some effect.
EP is strongly present in all radar and communication receivers and signal pro-
cessors with a number of very effective ECCMs, as will be described in Chapters 2 
and 6, thus rendering the contest between EA and EP a sort of chess match where 
each move of a player is met with a countermove by the other player.

Introduction to Electronic Warfare Scenarios
1.4  EW in Asymmetric Conflicts
Asymmetric warfare occurs when the two opponents have highly unequal military 
capabilities and the weaker one uses methods of attack such as sabotage, terrorism, 
or insurgency that avoid contact with military forces in areas where the opponent 
is stronger. Conceptually, it is similar to guerrilla warfare or to Special Forces op-
erations. The weapon usually employed by the weaker opponent in the above-cited 
actions are light gunnery and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
In the asymmetric conflicts EW is strictly limited to the communications bands, 
and it is used only by the stronger opponent and employed in slightly different 
modes in the two areas into which a territory can be divided: rural areas and urban 
areas.
In rural areas EW essentially performs detection of hostile communications 
and communication intelligence from an adversary’s messages using CESM and 
COMINT equipment (which is the same as that employed for symmetric conflicts), 
EW also involves countering a radio-controlled IED (RCIED) with some appropri-
ate counter-RCIED jammer (CECM). 
RCIEDs are triggered by an RF signal to initiate their explosive charge. They 
offer the user the advantage of flexibility because there is no physical proximity 
between him and the device. RCIEDs are used in ambushes of military convoys and 
patrols as they traverse roads. The RCIED is usually planted in locations where the 
convoy/patrol cannot go off-road to avoid the device. The RCIED user is located 
in an observation point where he can see the approach of the convoy/patrol to the 
device and is able to send the triggering message to the planted device at the right 
time. The radio link used is usually a short-range one, with the exception of the use 
of mobile phone systems, such as GSM, where existing networks are available. In 
the latter case the trigger command may be sent from up to a few kilometers away.
The following EW actions are applied to defend against RCIEDs:
•• Detection of an adversary’s communications in the interested area (which 
may be performed by stand-off systems such as UAVs patrolling the area for 
reconnaissance and intelligence collection in the days prior to the passage of 
the convoy),
•• Preemptive initiation of the explosive device before its intended use by using 
a high-power jammer,
•• Force protection jamming around the convoy/patrol to create an RF shield.
The counter-RCIED methods and jammer devices are discussed in Section 6.3.4 
of Chapter 6.
EW actions in urban areas employ CESM and COMINT equipment in the same 
way as for the rural area to provide, respectively, targeting for the EA equipment of 
the adversary’s communication links and the usual communication intelligence on 
the adversary’s information exchanged through those links. EW actions, however, 
differ in the type of CECM equipment employed because in this case they are part 
of an offensive information operation, called electronic isolation, where the CECM 
action to deny the adversary’s exchange of information through the radio links (by 
injecting noise or some appropriate signals into the target receivers) is accompanied 

1.4  EW in Asymmetric Conflicts 
21
by a computer network attack and is extended to prevent all adversary’s communi-
cation with civilians, such as television. radio, mobile phones, wireless connectivity 
(Wi-Fi or Wi-max), and satellite communications.
An important consideration to be made regarding the use of EW attacks in ur-
ban areas is the collateral effects on friendly and neutral services. So these attacks 
need to be carefully planned.
Needless to say, in addition to the above–mentioned electronic isolation ac-
tions, urban combat requires the use of counter-RCIED jammers by every combat 
vehicle and dismounted patrol. The type of jammer required is the responsive type 
(also called a signal-initiated jammer) in order to allow our own radio links to be 
able to operate unaffected.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
2.1  Introduction
The objective of EW systems is the protection of military troops, assets, and plat-
forms (which we will call generically targets) from the electromagnetic (EM) threats 
present in the environment. EM threats are realized by means of weapons systems 
provided with sensors that can guide gun projectiles, launched munitions, and mis-
siles from long distances.
Sensors that operate in the EM spectrum can transform the radiated energy im-
pinging on them into electrical signals that are subsequently processed by electronic 
devices. Sensors are used for detection, tracking, recognition, and identification 
of targets. Some sensors provide their own source of target illumination, such as 
microwave, millimeter-wave, and laser radars. Such sensors are called active sen-
sors. Other sensors depend on natural conditions for target illumination, such as 
electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) systems, which use, respectively, the reflected 
light energy from the target or the radiated heat energy of the natural background 
and of human-made engines and objects. These types of sensors are called passive 
sensors. Active sensors are equipped with both a transmitting and a receiving unit; 
passive sensors consist only of a receiving unit.
This chapter merely provides an introduction to modern available sensor tech-
nologies and techniques at the depth necessary to understand the requirements of 
the EW equipment described in the following chapters that is relevant to the inter-
ception, classification, and jamming of signals and receivers.
In Section 2.2 we discuss sensors features that are relevant to their operational 
wavelength: their dimensions and signal propagation characteristics, especially 
within the atmosphere. Three of the book’s appendices also deal with the subject of 
sensors: Appendix A covers the signal detection capabilities of receivers, which can 
be impaired by the receiver noise produced by any electronic device and by other 
environmental disturbances; Appendix B provides information about the accuracy 
of sensors as derived from the concepts of estimation theory; and Appendix D pro-
vides a discussion of relevant analog modulation methods used in communications.
In Section 2.3 we tackle the principal active sensor in the EW domain: the radar. 
First we consider the capabilities offered by the tremendous evolution of the wave-
form generation and novel signal processing techniques with respect to maximum

target range detection, range, range rate (i.e., radial velocity), and angular measure-
ment accuracies, and then we review the some important types of radars.
Other active sensors that are of interest to EW systems are the communica-
tion systems (which are considered in Section 2.4) and the navigation systems 
(which are considered in Section 2.5). Both systems have enormously enhanced 
operational capabilities thanks to the evolution of signal processing techniques and 
technologies.
Finally, in Sections 2.6 and 2.7 we discuss, respectively, the most important 
passive sensors such as IR sensors and missile seeker heads and, in continuity with 
the IR band of the EM spectrum, the description of the capabilities of active laser 
systems. 
2.2  Sensor Electromagnetic Spectrum and Atmospheric Propagation
Sensors can be classified in accordance with their wavelength because their com-
ponent units (such as transmitters, receivers, apertures, and detectors) are sized 
proportional to the wavelength. 
Table 2.1 compares microwave, millimeter wave (MMW), and EO/IR sensors 
characteristics.
An important component of any sensor is its aperture, where the energy enters 
(reception) and/or leaves (transmission) the sensor. Microwave and MMW sen-
sor apertures are antennas, whereas EO/IR sensor apertures are optical lenses and 
mirrors.
The directivity GD of antennas and lenses is defined as the ratio of the full 
spherical solid angle (4π sterad) to the solid angle in which the transmitted or re-
ceived energy is primarily concentrated . For a rectangular aperture of solid angle 
with –3-dB beamwidths θB and φB, we have:

As an example, for a microwave radar antenna operating at λ = 3 cm with 
diameter D = 1m = 100 cm, we have qB = 1.13 × 3/100 = 0.035rad = 35mrad = 2° 
and GD=4p/(0.35)2 = 10314 = 40.1 dB, while, for a CO2 laser operating at λ = 10.6 
μm and a lens with diameter D = 10 cm, we have 
 	
qB = 1.13 · 10.6/10 · 10–4 rad = 0.119 mrad = (6.9 · 10–3)°	
From the preceding numerical examples, we can deduce that the EO/IR sensors, 
because of their very short wavelengths, have the highest resolution characteristics, 
which are useful for imaging and target identification. In contrast, the microwave 
and MMW radars, due to their large beamwidths, are useful for volume search, 
tracking, guidance, and cueing of EO/IR sensors.
The theoretical values expressed in (2.1) to (2.4) are always in excess of actual 
values and have to be corrected by an efficiency factor η on the order of 0.6 to 0.7 
depending on the physical structure and EM properties of antennas and lenses. 
As an example the gain of a microwave antenna is expressed as G = ηGD, where 
the antenna efficiency factor is assumed to be η = 0.6 to 0.65 for a good antenna 
design.
The frequencies of the EW sensors are reported in Table 2.2 for the radar mi-
crowave and MMW bands and in Table 2.3 for the IR spectrum.
An important consideration in the design of any sensor system is that of atmo-
spheric effects such as rain, fog, and dust, which can degrade their performance, 
as well as the atmospheric attenuation vs. frequency. Figures 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 il-
lustrate, respectively, the one-way atmospheric attenuation (dB/km) vs. frequency, 
the attenuation due to rain and fog, and the atmospheric transmission coefficient 
at IR wavelength for high-frequency sensors. 
From the above figures it is evident that visible and IR sensors performances 
are significantly reduced under adverse atmospheric conditions and also MMW 
radar are strongly affected.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types
The name radar was assigned early on (prior to World War II) as a contraction of 
the words radio detection and ranging. The basic radar principle was developed by 
many nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Italy, 
France, and Russia. It was developed primarily for the frequency bands from 25 
to 500 MHz [3]. This development accelerated during WW II. The U.K. develop-
ment of the magnetron led to major advances in microwave radar that took place 
in parallel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Radiation Laboratory and 
elsewhere in the United States and United Kingdom after 1941.
Modern radars can usually extract much more information from the target 
than just the range. They can extract angle, radial velocity, pointwise or distrib-
uted extension, aspect changes, jet engine vs. propeller modulation, and so forth. 
However the measurement of range (i.e., the distance to a target) is still the most 
important radar function. The basic radar principle is shown in Figure 2.4.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
A transmitter (Tx) generates a RF signal, usually a train of narrow pulses mod-
ulating a sine wave carrier, that is radiated into space by an antenna. A portion of 
the transmitted energy is intercepted by the target and scattered in many directions, 
including back toward the radar antenna. The backscattered signal is fed to the 
receiver (Rx), which processes it to detect the presence of the target and to deter-
mine its location—range and direction. The direction is provided by the narrow 
beamwidth of the antenna. Range R is obtained by measuring the delay Δt from

by the radar signal to travel at the speed of light c = 3 × 108 m/s to the target and

Each microsecond (μs) of round-trip travel corresponds to a distance of 150m.
Once a pulse is radiated into space by a radar, sufficient time must elapse to 
allow for all echo signals to return to the radar before the next pulse is transmitted. 
The rate at which the pulses are transmitted is therefore determined by the longest 
range at which targets are expected. If the period Tp between pulses is too short, an 
echo signal from a far target may arrive after the transmission of the next pulse and 
thus can be associated in error with an echo of the latter pulse than to the former 
one. These echoes are called second-time-around echoes (or even multiple-time-
around echoes if they are relevant to earlier pulses) and provide ambiguous range 
measurements because the echoes would appear at much shorter distances than the 
actual ones. The range beyond which targets appear as second-time-around echoes 
is called the maximum unambiguous range Run and is expressed as:

where Tp is the pulse repetition interval (PRI) and fp = 1/Tp is the pulse repetition 
frequency (PRF).
The simplest and typical radar pulse waveform of Figure 2.4 is characterized 
by a high peak power Pt, a pulse width (PW) τ, and a small duty cycle d, this last 
defined as the ratio of the average transmitted power Pav to the peak power Pt, that 
is, d = Pav/ Pt = τ/Tp.
A short-duration pulse waveform is attractive because the transmitter is not 
radiating when the weak echo signal is being received and because it provides a 
good resolution of the measured distance; that is, it can discriminate between two 
targets that are not very far (>τ) between them. A short-duration pulse waveform, 
however, requires a very high peak power Pt in order for the radar receiver to be 
able to obtain sufficient energy to detect small targets at long ranges. Different ra-
dar waveforms will be considered after the introduction of the radar equation and 
the structure of a typical radar.
2.3.1  Radar Equation 
The radar equation relates the detection range of a radar to the characteristics of 
its architecture (i.e., transmitter, receiver, antenna, and waveform), as depicted in 
Figure 2.5, and of the target and the environment. As such the equation is a funda-
mental tool in radar system design.
If the transmitter peak power Pt(W) is radiated by an isotropic antenna, the 
power density PDi at a distance R(m) from the radar is:

radar is useful for target detection. This reradiated power density PDr at the radar

is determined by an equivalent (fictional) reflecting area σ, the RCS, which is not

The radar antenna captures a portion of the PDr in accordance with the ef-

physical area size A by the relationship Ae = ηA, where η < 1 is the antenna aper-
ture efficiency as well as to the receiving antenna gain Gr by the relationship Gr = 
4πAe/λ2. Usually, in monostatic radars (i.e., radars with colocated transmitter and 
receiver) the same antenna is used both for transmission and reception, making the 
antenna a reciprocal device and, thus, Gt = Gr = G. Therefore, the received power 
at the radar receiver input is:

The detection of the target return power, which is impaired by the receiver 
noise power N (proportional to the bandwidth Br of the radar waveform), is per-
formed by setting a threshold (see Appendix A) well above this value in order to 
significantly reduce the probability of occurrence of false detections (called false 
alarms and hence the probability is called probability of false alarms, Pfa) produced 
by noise spikes Usually Pfa is required to be <10–6.The target return power must 
largely overcome the above threshold in order to ensure a high detection probabil-
ity Pd (usually >0.9) .To achieve the above-mentioned detection conditions (Pd,Pfa), 
the ratio of the target power to the noise power [which is called the signal-to-noise 
power ratio and indicated with (SNR)] must be larger than the minimum SNR0 
value that satisfies the detection conditions, that is, SNR>SNR0. The target return 
power therefore must have a minimum power Smin = SNR0 · N in order for the 
target to be reliably detected.
The maximum range Rmax of a radar is the distance beyond which the target 
cannot be detected at the required detection conditions (Pd, Pfa ). This occurs when 
the received power Pr is equal to the minimum detectable signal power, Smin, which 
depends, as mentioned earlier, on the radar waveform and the structure of the re-
ceiver (which both determine the receiver noise power) and the required SNR0 for 
detection conditions. Thus Rmax is expressed from (2.10) and (2.11) by substituting 
Pr with Smin:

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
As will be discussed in Chapters 5 and 6 one of the principal EW countermea-
sure techniques against radars is the transmission of noise-like waveforms that are 
meant to increase the noise power at the receiver to a level that significantly reduces 
the maximum range of target detection.
2.3.2  Radar Structure
The operation of a traditional (vintage) pulse radar can be described with the aid of 
the simplified block diagram of Figure 2.5(a).The structure of modern radar there-
after evolved as represented in the block diagram of Figure 2.5(b). Radar system 
evolution is discussed in the following paragraphs.
The radar signal is produced at low power by a waveform generator (WFG) and 
is fed to the power amplifier, which constitutes the radar transmitter. In the past, 
low duty waveform power oscillators, such as magnetrons, were used as transmit-
ters. Currently, because modern radars require larger duty coherent waveforms, a 
power amplifier is preferred. The power amplifier can be a crossed-field amplifier, 
a klystron, a travelling-wave-tube (TWT) or a solid-state (SS, i.e., transistor) ampli-
fier. In most power amplifiers, except for the SS ones, and in power oscillators, a 
modulator turns the Tx on and off in synchronism with the input pulses from the 
WFG.
The output of the Tx is delivered via a duplexer to the antenna, where it is ra-
diated into space. The duplexer acts as a switch and allows for a single antenna to 
be used on a time-shared basis between transmission and reception. The duplexer 
is generally a gaseous device that produces a short circuit (an arc discharge) at 
the input of the receiver when the transmitter is operating, so that the high power 
flows to the antenna and not to the receiver (thus protecting it). On reception the 
duplexer directs the echo signal to the receiver and not to the transmitter.
The high-gain (directive) antenna can consist of mechanically steered parabolic 
reflectors, mechanically steered planar arrays, or electronically steered phased ar-
rays (see Appendix C).
The rotation of a surveillance radar antenna through 360° in azimuth is an 
example of an antenna scan. Typical scan rates range from 5 to 6 revolutions per 
minute (rpm) for long-range surveillance radar up to 30 to 60 rpm for medium- 
and short-range surveillance radars.
The receiver is almost always superheterodyne (SHR). The RF input is ampli-
fied by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) to achieve high sensitivity and then down-
converted to an intermediate frequency (IF), usually 30 or 60 MHz in past radars, 
where it is further amplified by an IF amplifier. The signal bandwidth of a SHR 
is determined by the bandwidth of its IF stage, which in the case of radar equip-
ment is the one of the matched filters (see later discussion), that is, the filter that 
maximizes the output peak SNR. For the widely used rectangular pulse shape, the 
matched filter is approximated by conventional receiver filters with a bandwidth 
BIF ≈ 1/τ, that is, the inverse of the pulse width.
The IF amplifier is followed in legacy radars by an envelope detector, which is 
traditionally called a demodulator, whose task is to extract the signal modulation 
from the carrier. The chain composed of IF amplifier, demodulator, and video am-
plifier acts as an envelope detector (see Appendix A) to pass the pulse modulation 
(envelope) and remove the IF carrier frequency.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
33
At the output of the Rx, a decision is made about whether or not a target is 
present. The decision is based on the amplitude of the receiver video output with 
respect to a predetermined threshold, set in order to reduce the false alarm cross-
ing rate due to noise to a tolerable level. For a case in which, instead of receiver 
noise, external noise (such as unintentional interference, deliberate noise jamming, 
or clutter echoes) becomes the dominant cause of false alarms, the threshold has to 
be varied adaptively to maintain a constant false alarm rate by means of a constant 
false alarm rate (CFAR) receiver. 
A radar usually receives many echo pulses from a target. Summing these pulses 
to achieve a larger SNRout before the detection decision is called integration of 
pulses. The integrator is part of the signal processor, whose function is to pass the 
desired echo signal, but reject the unwanted signals, noise, or clutter before the 
detection decision is made.
Modern radars are also provided with a data processor that performs automatic 
target tracking by using previously measured locations of the target to establish its 
track (i.e., its past trajectory) and forecast its location at the next scan of the radar.
In modern radars matched filtering, detection, signal, and data processors are 
implemented with digital techniques.
2.3.2.1  Radar Clutter Signal Processing
The basic principles of radar discussed in the previous section illustrated only the 
detection capabilities of targets in the presence of noise. This situation occurs only 
with targets flying at high altitudes and at distances where the antenna beamwidth 
is not affected by echoes from the natural environment. In the vast majority of situ-
ations, however, radar target detection is severely impaired by the natural environ-
ment such as land, sea, and weather echoes, which are called clutter, since they can 
“clutter” the radar display and prevent the detection of desired targets (aircraft, 
ships, or moving vehicles). Clutter echoes can be many orders of magnitude larger 
than target echoes and when they both are present in the same resolution cell the 
target is undetectable, unless proper signal processing is applied.
The most powerful method for detecting a moving target in the presence of 
clutter is by taking advantage of the differential Doppler shift and in general the 
different spectrum of the target echo from the clutter echo. CW radar target de-
tection processing is essentially based on differential Doppler shift filtering. Pulse 
radars that employ the differential Doppler shift for detecting are the moving target 
indicator (MTI), Doppler filter banks and moving target detection (MTD), air-
borne MTI (AMTI), and pulse Doppler (PD) radars. These types of radars are 
briefly discussed after we introduce the concept of coherent radar detection.
The Doppler frequency shift fd consists of the frequency change with respect to 
the transmitted frequency impressed to the echo of a moving target by its relative 
radial speed v with respect to the radar. Its evaluation can be deduced from the 
total phase change φ with time in the two-way propagation path from the radar to 
a target in motion, initially placed at a distance R. 
Total phase change φ can be expressed as:

Note that the preceding expression is valid for two-way propagation, which is 
typical of a monostatic radar. In the case of one-way propagation (i.e., reception 
from a passive receiver) the Doppler frequency shift fd with respect to the transmit-
ted frequency ft is half of the above value. 
Note that an approaching target (i.e., dR/dt < 0) produces a negative Doppler 
shift, whereas a receding target produces a positive one.
To exploit the Doppler shift of the moving targets, the radar receiver must be 
coherent (i.e., it needs to have a stable transmitted frequency generation) and use a 
phase detector instead of an amplitude detector (as discussed in the previous para-
graphs and in Appendix A) following the IF stage (which is designed as a matched 
filter). The structure of the radar is thus modified as shown in Figure 2.7
It can easily be shown from the above scheme that the echo signal from a mov-
ing target (fd ≠ 0) produces time-varying output, whereas the echo from stationary 
clutter (fd ≈ 0) produces a constant output. This consideration is applied in radar 
Doppler signal processing, for which the earliest and simplest development was the 
MTI.

and its modulus vs. frequency is shown in Figure 2.9.
A detailed discussion about MTI processing is beyond the scope of this book 
and we recommend that interested readers refer to [3]. Suffice it to say here that, 
as can be noted from Figure 2.9, the single delay-line canceller actually cancels the 
clutter response at zero Doppler shift, but unfortunately also the echoes of the tar-
gets moving with a Doppler shift fd = k/Tp (i.e., at multiples of the PRF = 1/Tp), for 
which the corresponding velocities vr = kλ/2Tp are called blind speeds. From this 
last expression note that, in order to increase the velocity range, unless operating 
at long wavelengths, the usable methods consist of using high PRFs (and this is the 
case for the PD radar) or a number of different PRFs. 
The rationale of this second method is that the blind speeds that occur with 
one PRF are generally different from those occurring at a different PRF. So targets 
that are strongly attenuated with one PRF may easily be detected with a different 
PRF. Usually to increase the value of the first blind speed, a number of PRFs are 
employed, with the ratios between them being expressed with large prime numbers.
The PRFs can be either changed from batches to batches of pulses or from 
pulse to pulse (this case is called staggered PRF), which has been popular for air 
traffic control radar (ATCR) and surveillance radars. Staggered PRFs provide an 
important waveform signature for the radar identification process operated by 
ESM systems.
As an example [3], consider the increase of the first blind velocity obtained by 
selecting the staggered PRFs as k1PRF1 = k2PRF2 = …. = krPRFr, where the num-
bers {ki} are relatively prime integers and among them (as an example, 25, 30, 27, 
31) is v1 = 28.25 vav.
With the evolution of high-speed digital technology, MTI processing is cur-
rently performed in complete digital fashion, as shown in Figure 2.10 with the 
following advantages:
•• Compensation for “blind phases,” by using in-phase and quadrature (I and 
Q) processing,
•• Greater dynamic range,
•• Better achievement of the required filter characteristics.
Doppler Filter Banks
A Doppler filter bank is a set of narrowband contiguous filters for detecting targets, 
as shown for the case of N = 8 in Figure 2.11. With respect to MTI filters, it has the 
advantages of:

•• Separation of undesired moving clutter (rainstorms or birds) with non-zero 
Doppler shifts,
•• Raw measure of target radial velocity, the ambiguity of which can be resolved 
by changing the PRF,
•• Provision of coherent integration at the output of each filter.
With the evolution of high-speed digital technology, the filter bank is now im-
plemented via fast Fourier transform (FFT). 
2.3.3  Radar Signal Processing Fundamentals
Radars must not only detect the presence of a target in the environment but also ex-
tract a number of pieces of information about it, such as location (range, azimuth, 
and possibly elevation), radial velocity, and even target recognition.
Moving target detection and extraction of target information is impaired by 
the presence of noise, echoes from the natural environment such as land, sea, and 
weather clutter and by intentional (jamming) and nonintentional interference. 
Methods for the detection of the desired echo signal and rejection of undesired 
noise, clutter, and other types of interference are called radar signal processing, and 
they are discussed in the following sections after introduction of one basic theoreti-

cal radar signal process—the matched filter—and one important radar waveform 
design tool—the ambiguity function.
2.3.3.1  Matched Filter
The matched filter has the task of maximizing the output peak SNR of the radar 
receiver so as to maximize the detectability of a target. Let us consider, as shown 
in Figure 2.12, a signal with finite energy E whose complex envelope is s(t) and its 
Fourier transform S(f) at the input of a filter with transfer function H(f)1. These as-
sumptions are formally expressed as:

which shows that the impulse response of the optimum filter is (except for an am-

having used in the last integral the variable λ = t0 – τ. 
The last integral in (2.31) has the same form of the cross-correlation between 
the transmitted signal s(t) and the received signal x(t), thus we can conclude that 
the output of the matched filter is the cross-correlation between the transmitted 
and the received signal.
From (2.28) and (2.31) it is clear that, for a pulsed radar signal s(t) of duration 
T, the matched filter is a causal one [with a waveform as shown in Figure 2.13(b)] 
and the output of the matched filter is the cross-correlation of the two waveforms, 
as shown in Figure 2.13(c).
When the SNR is large, x(t) ≈ s(t) and the output signal from the matched filter 
ym(t )is approximated by the autocorrelation function of the transmitted signal s(t).
The above considerations show that it is possible to implement the matched fil-
ter as a correlation receiver in which the input signal x(t) is multiplied by a delayed 
replica of the transmitted signal  s(t – t0), where t0 is an estimate of the time delay 
of the target echo signal. Because the cross-correlation receiver and the matched 
receiver are mathematically equivalent, the choice as to which to use in a particular 
radar application is determined by which is most practical to implement.
In practice, the matched filter cannot always be perfectly implemented. In Ta-
ble 2.4, derived from Skolnik [3], some practical matched filter approximations are 
reported, together with their efficiency (i.e., the SNR loss with respect to the true 
matched filter).

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
41
The matched filter receiver (or its approximation for large SNR, the autocor-
relation receiver) makes the detectability of signals a function only of the received 
signal energy E and the input noise spectral density N0 = kT0F. Thus, the maximum 
detection range of the radar is not dependent on the shape of the transmitted signal 
or the receiver bandwidth, which can therefore be selected to optimize the extrac-
tion of the information relevant to the target, as shown in the following sections.
2.3.3.2  The Ambiguity Function
The previous section demonstrated that for large SNR the matched filter output can 
be considered as the autocorrelation function of the transmitted signal, that is, the 
noise can be neglected. However, when delayed, the received signal has a Doppler 
shift, its carrier frequency is different from the transmitted one, and the matched 
filter output can no longer be considered to be the autocorrelation function of the 
transmitted signal. In this case the matched filter output, always for large SNR,

must be considered as the cross-correlation of the received Doppler-shifted signal 
and the transmitted signal.
From the shape of the matched filter output as a function of both time and 
Doppler frequency, it is possible to understand many properties of the transmitted 
radar waveform with regard to range resolution, ambiguities in range and radial 
velocity, range and velocity measurement accuracies, and the response to clutter (an 
environmental echo at the same speed of the radar).
As seen from (2.31) the output of the matched filter [always neglecting the 
noise contribution to the received signal, that is, x(t) ≈ sr(t)] is:

The “ideal” ambiguity diagram would consist of a Dirac’s impulse [as shown 
in Figure 2.14(a)], which has no ambiguities both in range and Doppler frequency. 
Its infinitesimal thickness at the origin would permit a determination of both time 
delay and target radial velocity to the desired accuracy, to resolve two very closely 
spaced targets and reject all clutter (except at the origin). However the Dirac’s im-
pulse does not satisfy properties 1 and 5 above, which state that both the maximum 
of the ambiguity diagram and the total volume should be 1. 
An approximation of a good ambiguity diagram is shown in Figure 2.14, in 
which the waveform has a single peak and no ambiguities in the (τ,fd) space. How-
ever, the single peak might be so wide along either time or Doppler frequency axes 
in the spread of the matched filter response, which introduces an ambiguity as to the exact range when a 
Doppler shift is present [11].

or both that it might provide poor measurement accuracy and resolution in one or 
both domains. 
In what follows only the projection on the plane (τ,fd) of the ambiguity diagrams 
of some practical waveforms will be reported. So the interested reader is referred to 
[4] for deeper insight into the ambiguity diagrams of most radar waveforms.
Figure 2.15(a) shows a two-dimensional projection on the plane (τ,fd) of the 
ambiguity diagram for a single pulse of sine wave of width T. Figures 2.15(b) 
and (c), respectively, show the shape of the ambiguity function along the time and 
Doppler frequency axis. In part (a) the darkened shaded area indicates the region 
where the ambiguity function is large (greater than –6 dB), the lightly shaded area 
indicates the region where it is small (less than –6 dB), and no shading indicates 
the area where the ambiguity function is zero. As can be seen in Figure 2.15(a), 
the simple pulse presents the limitations that if range resolution is improved by 
reducing width T, the Doppler frequency accuracy is worsened and vice versa if 
width T is increased. The short pulse waveform is Doppler tolerant in that, as can 
be noted in Figure 2.15(b), the response of a matched filter to a moderate Doppler 
frequency shift does not change too much with respect to the response to zero Dop-
pler frequency. 
Figure 2.16 shows the two-dimensional projection on the plane (τ,fd) of the 
ambiguity diagram of a linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) rectangular pulse of 
width T over a bandwidth B.
Let us evaluate the ambiguity function of a LFM pulse of bandwidth B and

Note from this equation that along the time axis (fd = 0) the first zero crossing 
is at ατ = π, that is, (T – τ)kτ = 1, which becomes τ = 1/kT = 1/B for τ << T; and 
along the Doppler frequency axis (τ = 0) the first zero crossing is at αf = π, that is, 
πTfd = π or fd = 1/T. Further note that for τ = T/2 we have fd = B/2 and thus the 
total frequency excursion is fd = B.
As can be noted from Figure 2.16, the time-delay measurement accuracy is 
proportional to 1/B and the Doppler frequency accuracy is proportional to 1/T. 
since the pulse width T and the bandwidth B can be chosen independently, the two 
above-mentioned accuracies can both be obtained.
Because the selected radar waveform affects target detection, range and Dop-
pler frequency measurement accuracy and resolution, ambiguities and clutter rejec-
tion, its ambiguity diagram is very useful in the radar design process to assess quali-
tatively the achievement of the above-mentioned capabilities. A noise waveform, 
such as pseudorandom variations of phase or frequency, has an ambiguity diagram 
called a thumbtack, as shown in Figure 2.17. This waveform has the advantage 
that the time-delay and frequency measurement accuracies are independently de-
termined, respectively, by the bandwidth of the modulation and the duration of the 
pulse.
The shape of the thumbtack shows that there are no ambiguities, and it re-
sembles the approximation of the ideal ambiguity diagram shown in Figure 2.14(a) 
with the exception of the plateau on which the main response rests. This plateau

extends over a dimension 2T along the time axis and 2B along the frequency axis. 
When the product BT is large, the volume under the peak response is small and 
almost all of the volume is in the plateau, which hence has a height h = (volume/
plateau area) = 1/(4BT). 
2.3.3.3  Information from Radar Signals
Knowing that a target is present (detection) in the environment is of no use if more 
information on the target is not obtained. A radar obtains information about a 
target by comparing the received echo signal with the signal that was transmit-
ted. From a single received echo, the radar obtains range, radial velocity, azimuth, 
sometimes the elevation of the target, and, in the case of a high-resolution radar, 
can assess whether it is a point target or a distributed target (with respect to the 
dimension of the radar resolution cell).
After several observations of a moving target over a period of time, the target 
trajectory or track is obtained, thus estimating also the two components of the 
target’s velocity (radial and tangential). The value of any measurement resides in 
its accuracy, which is the estimate of the error between the unbiased measurement 
of a parameter and its true value (see Appendix B). In the following paragraphs we 
discuss the radar’s measurements accuracy, taking into account that receiver noise 
is the fundamental limitation to accurate radar measurements and, hence, because 
the measurements are samples of a statistical parameter estimation the accuracy 
will correspond to the root-mean-square (rms) error value.
The expressions of the theoretical accuracies of the radar measurements (as-
sumed unbiased) are valid for large values of SNR, since it has already been shown 
that radar detection conditions (Pd and Pfa) require large SNR and detection is a 
precondition for the measurement. 
A further assumption is that the measurement error associated with a particu-
lar parameter is independent of the errors in any other parameter and the accuracy 
is limited only by receiver noise. With the above assumptions the theoretical rms 
error ΔM of a radar measurement M has the following expression:

where k is a constant, E is the received signal energy, and N0 is the noise power per 
unit bandwidth (two sided).
Theoretical radar accuracies can be derived by a variety of statistical methods 
and also by simple geometrical relationships among the signal, the noise, and the 
parameter to be measured. The latter is the method followed by Skolnik [3], which 
affirms that this method, for a rectangular pulse, gives results similar to those for 
the more rigorous statistical methods.
The derivation of the expressions are beyond the scope of this book. In the fol-
lowing we report on only the expressions and make some comments about their 
implications. We recommend to the interested reader the books from Skolnik [3] or 
Galati and Crescimbeni [5] for gaining deeper insight into the matter.
Range Accuracy
Range is measured by the round-trip time delay TR = 2R/c. Thus the range accuracy 
is given by ΔR = cΔTR/2, where ΔTR is the accuracy of the time delay. This accu-
racy can be evaluated through the shift in time of the leading edge (affected by the 
receiver noise) of the detected video pulse (which has a trapezoidal shape) at the 
threshold crossing . Thus ΔTR = tr /(2S/N)1/2, where tr is the pulse rise time and S is 
the signal power. Because the rise time of the video pulse is limited by the spectral 
bandwidth B of the rectangular-shaped IF filter, we have tr ≈ 1/B. Remembering that 
S = E/τ, where τ is the pulse width and N = N0B, we have:

 about its mean, which is assumed to be at f = 0, where S(f) is the video 
spectrum with both negative and positive frequencies. The effective bandwidth 
is different from all other bandwidths encountered in electronic engineering 
because it is not related to either the noise bandwidth or the half-power band-
width. In fact, the more the spectral energy is concentrated at the two ends of 
the bandwidth, the larger is β and the more accurate is the measurement of the 
time delay TR. For a trapezoidal pulse of finite bandwidth Bs (±Bs/2 around f =

The error expressions discussed above apply to a single observation. When n

factor n1/2.
From the above expressions relevant to the effective bandwidth β and effec-
tive duration α relevant to the employed waveform s(t), note that by applying the

This equation, which is a consequence of the Fourier transform relationship

striction on the accuracy with which a radar can simultaneously locate the position 
of a target and determine its velocity. In fact, if we take the product of the two ac-

accuracies, as small as desired, can be achieved. Note that a large αβ product re-
quires waveforms with long time durations and wide spectral widths.

This equation states that the shorter the wavelength λ and, more important, the

that can be achieved in simultaneous measurement of range and radial velocity.
Angular Accuracy
In a similar way to the time waveform, there is a Fourier relationship between the 
illumination A(x,y) of an antenna aperture and its complex radiation pattern g(θ,φ). 
For simplicity we will show only the one-dimensional case. The one-dimensional 
electric-field strength radiation pattern in one plane is expressed as follows, where

2.3.4  Automatic Detection
Automatic detection is digital processing that is run on the radar video signal. The 
radar video signal performs the detection process, which is presented both to the 
operator and to subsequent data processors associated with the radar. Automatic 
detection involves the following steps:
•• Quantization of the radar coverage into range and angle resolution cells;
•• Sampling in time the radar signal at a rate of two samples per range resolu-
tion cell;
•• Analog-to-digital conversion of the above samples with an adequate number 
of bits in accordance with the selected signal processing to remove as much 
noise, clutter echoes, and interference as practicable (see below) before the 
detection decision is made;
•• Integration of the available data samples at each resolution cell in order to 
improve SNRout and achieve the required detection conditions in terms of 
PD and PFA;
•• Perform CFAR processing in order to keep the false alarm rate in the pres-
ence of clutter and interference residues from the signal processing, with 
threshold detection to present the target echoes to the subsequent automatic 
detection and tracking (ADT) processing (see Section 2.3.7).
The first three steps are common to all digital signal processing and data pre-
sentations and as such they do not need to be discussed here. In what follows we 

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
51
discuss mainly the improvement of the SNR due to pulse signal integration and the 
achievement of a constant false alarm rate in the presence of clutter and interfer-
ence residues that either Doppler (see next section) and/or ECCM (see Chapter 5) 
processing had been unable to remove.
2.3.4.1  Integrator 
As mentioned in the previous sections, a point target when illuminated by a radar 
beam, either steady or scanning, provides the radar with a number n of successive 
echoes at the PRF rate, where n is limited either by the data processing bandwidth 
of the receiver (in the case of a steady beam) or by the so-called time-on-target 
(TOT, or observation time within the scanning beam). The TOT is determined by 
the beamwidth θB (rad) and the scanning speed of the beam w (rad/s) as follows 
(and as also shown in Figure 2.18):

where PRI = 1/PRF is the pulse repetition interval.
As an example, for a scanning surveillance radar antenna rotating at a speed w 
= 6 rpm = 0.63 rad/s = 36°/s with beamwidth θB = 2° = 35 mr, and PRF = 0.5 kHz, 
we have: 
Figure 2.18  Number of pulses in the TOT.

52 
�����������������������������������對�����
Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
TOT = 55.5 ms and nscan = 28 pulses
As discussed in Appendix A, the integration of the n available echo pulses 
can be performed either coherently or incoherently. Coherent integration is more 
efficient, but until advances in digital processing became available, continuous in-
coherent integration of the last n pulses belonging to the same range resolution cell 
will be performed by the so-called moving window integrator (MWI), whose block 
diagram is shown in Figure 2.19. 
In a current digital processor it might be possible to apply weights to the tap 
outputs, based on the two-way gain of the antenna pattern. This would help to im-
prove SNRout. In practice, uniform weighting is applied giving a loss in the SNRout 
of about 0.5 dB (with respect to the optimum weighting ) [3].
The MWI operates according to the double-threshold detector logic or m out 
of n detection logic, which means that it is sufficient to achieve m primary detec-
tions within the n available pulses to declare the detection of a target pulse.
The primary threshold Th1 can be set at a low probability of false alarm (e.g., pfa 
= 10–2) to obtain a primary pulse detection with a low SNRin. The output of m ≥ 
n/2 detections provided by the crossing of the second threshold Th2 = m provides a 
target detection (at the usual number n > 10 within the beamwidth) at probability 
conditions3 PD ≥ 90% and PFA ≤ 10–6 with an SNRin = 5 dB. (Remember that for the 
same probability conditions the single pulse SNRin ≥ 13 dB.)
The angular estimate can be obtained by taking either the angular value of the 
maximum of the running sum (and then correcting it for the bias n/2 or θB/2) or the

mean angular value between the first and the last crossing of the primary threshold. 
The standard deviation (angular rms error) of these estimators is about 20% higher 
than the optimal estimate specified by the Cramer-Rao bound (see Appendix B and 
relevant references). 
The MWI is a relatively simple robust automatic detector that is less sensitive 
with respect to the other detectors to the effects of a single interference or clutter 
pulse, regardless of how large it is, because it converts any detection only into a 1 
in the sum. 
2.3.4.2  CFAR
In many situations a detection threshold that is set according to the receiver noise 
level can be easily crossed by clutter echoes or hostile noise jamming, which usually 
have much larger response levels than the receiver internal noise. This produces 
many harmful false alarms to the ADT function. In the ADT function, false alarms 
might strongly degrade the computer capacity to recognize and discard the false 
targets; therefore, it is necessary to add a CFAR processing step at the output of the 
radar receiver, before a target detection is declared, in order to keep a constant false 
alarm rate. CFAR processing does not provide any improvement in the signal-to-
clutter ratio (SCR); instead, it produces some loss in the SNR.
The usual form of CFAR processing is constituted by the cell-averaging (CA) 
scheme reported in Figure 2.20. Two tapped delay lines sample the echo signals in 
range into a number of M reference cells (each of the same size as the range resolu-
tion) located on both sides of the range cell of interest (the test cell). The output of 
the test cell is compared with an adaptive threshold derived by the averaged sum 
(multiplied by a factor K) of the output of the reference cells. If the radar output 
noise or clutter is described by a Rayleigh probability density function (pdf), the 
factor K can be determined by means of classical detection theory (see Appendix 
A). When the clutter statistic is described by some other pdf, the factor K has to be 
estimated by simulation.
Figure 2.20  CA scheme for CFAR processing. The operator can be sum, greater of, or other.

The greater the number M of reference cells, the better the estimate of the back-
ground clutter or jamming noise and the less loss in detectability (or SNR loss) of 
the target.
The scheme shown in Figure 2.20 illustrates the situation in which the edges 
of a patch of clutter are exceeding the threshold (which is evaluated taking into 
account that most of the reference cells contain the clutter). The threshold crossing 
of clutter edges is reduced by determining a further threshold that is obtained by 
summing separately only the leading and lagging reference cells and by using the 
greater of the two sums as the CFAR processing threshold. This method is called 
G-greater of the two sums or GO-CFAR and introduces a further SNR loss of 
about 0.3 dB.
A further CFAR method is the so-called clutter map (CM), where the radar 
coverage is subdivided into range-azimuth cells and the measured clutter echo of 
each cell is stored in it and used as the detection threshold for that cell. Since the 
clutter echo can change with time, the value of the clutter echo in each cell is up-
dated periodically upon average on a number (on the order 10) of successive scans. 
The CM-CFAR has the advantage with respect to CA and GO-CFAR that it is not 
affected by nonhomogeneous clutter and to the clutter edges.
A much used CFAR processing technique that is quite effective against impulse-
like and broadband noise jamming is the Dicke-Fix or hard-limiter processing. It 
consists of the cascade of a broadband IF filter (of bandwidth BL) followed by 
a hard-limiter (set to a level about 10 times below the receiver noise) and a nar-
rowband matched filter (of bandwidth BIF << BL) as shown in Figure 2.21. The 
method is used with pulse compression waveforms, where the matched filter pro-
vides the pulse compression gain needed for target detection. This method cannot 
be effectively used with MTI radar processing because it would strongly reduce its 
obtainable improvement factor (see Section 2.3.2.1). Moreover, the dynamic range 
downstream of the pulse compression is equal to the compression ratio regardless 
of the dynamic range upstream from the pulse compression.
2.3.4.3  Space-Time Adaptive Processing
When greater clutter attenuation is required in phased array radars on board mo-
bile platforms, then adaptivity in both antenna pattern and Doppler processing 
can be applied. Indeed in a phased array antenna with N elements, it is possible to 
adjust, through a control loop, the amplitude and phase at each element in order 
to place one or more antenna pattern nulls in the directions of external noise, jam-
ming, or clutter for the purpose of reducing or eliminating unwanted signals. The 
adaptive phased array antenna is thus acting as a spatial filter.
Figure 2.21  Hard-limiter CFAR. 

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
55
After the adaptive antenna has minimized the clutter echo received from the 
antenna sidelobes, an adaptive Doppler filter can operate on the main beam by 
adjusting, through a control loop, its weights in order to shape its frequency re-
sponse so as to maximize the S/C ratio at its output on the basis of the input clutter 
spectrum. This process of selecting weights corresponds as an example in placing 
the zeroes of the adaptive MTI filter [6] at the Doppler frequencies of the regions 
occupied by the clutter spectrum.
The combination of the two adaptive techniques is called space-time adaptive 
processing (STAP) and it provides the following advantages for a radar:
•• Reduction of clutter in the main beam through the adaptive Doppler filtering,
•• Reduction of clutter and jamming from the sidelobes through the adaptive 
antenna,
•• Adaptive selection of antenna weights to provide platform motion 
compensation.
Of course, the larger the number of antenna elements, the number of pulses 
within a coherent processing interval (CPI), and the number of zeroes of the adap-
tive Doppler filter, the better is the performance of interference reduction. In prac-
tice, however, there is a limit on the number N of adaptive elements and K pulses. 
In fact, it is unusual to have a fully adaptive phased array (the elements are usu-
ally hundreds or thousands) so the elements are grouped in order to have M << N 
subarrays and only their combined outputs are connected to the adaptive control 
loop. The number of pulses is limited by the beam dwell time in a direction and the 
selected PRF to resolve range ambiguities. A notional schematic block diagram of 
STAP is shown in Figure 2.22.
2.3.5  Pulse Compression
Simple short pulse waveforms were used in the early radars in conjunction with 
the high peak power transmitters to achieve target detection at long ranges with 
moderate range accuracy. But high peak power transmitters have a serious techni-
cal limitation because at high powers voltage breakdown (arc discharge) may occur, 
especially at high frequency, where the waveguide dimensions are small, and at high 
altitudes, where the air density is lower.
The need to transform the radar from a simple target detection system to a 
source of accurate information on the targets in order to assess their dangerous-
ness, such as their radial velocity, their route, and their separation in a highly dense 
target environment (thus involving also good radar resolution), required a reduc-
tion in the pulse width (or, in other terms, an increase in the signal bandwidth) to 
achieve good range resolution.
Because the detection capabilities are dependent on the energy of the signal (i.e., 
the product of the peak power times the duration of the signal), high peak power 
can be reduced by increasing the duration T of the signal(long pulses), but modu-
lating it either in frequency or phase so as to increase the signal bandwidth B and 

56 
�����������������������������������對�����
Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
hence the range resolution4. The long modulated pulse width is then compressed 
in the matched filter to achieve a short pulse width τ = 1/B. Pulse compression thus 
allows a radar to achieve the energy of a long pulse and simultaneously the resolu-
tion of a short pulse, without requiring high peak power. The pulse compression 
ratio (PCR) is defined as the ratio of the long pulse width T to the compressed pulse 
width τ (also called a subpulse), that is, PCR =T/τ = TB
In the past, two classes of pulse compression waveforms were used: the linear 
frequency modulation (LFM; also known as “chirp”) and the binary phase-shift 
code or key (BPSK). In more recent times, further classes of pulse compression 
waveforms were added, such as:
•• Polyphase codes, whose phase quantizations are  rad, with n = 1, 2, …;
•• Costas code, in which the frequencies of each subpulse are selected in accor-
dance with a rule;
•• Nonlinear FM (NLFM);
•• Complementary codes.
These compression waveforms are discussed briefly in the following subsections.
4.	
Amplitude modulation, which also increases the signal bandwidth, is not generally used because good 
transmitter efficiency requires constant saturated power output.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
57
2.3.5.1  Linear FM
The FM waveform is generated at low power and then amplified by a power am-
plifier to be transmitted. The transmitted waveform consists of a rectangular pulse 
of constant amplitude A and duration T. The carrier frequency either increases 
linearly within the pulse from f1 to f2 (up-chirp) or decreases linearly from f2 to f1 
(down-chirp).  On reception the LFM signal is passed through the pulse compres-
sion filter, which is a delay line whose velocity of propagation is proportional to 
the frequency (up-chirp) or inversely proportional to the frequency (down-chirp). 
In the case of an up-chirp, it speeds up the higher frequencies at the trailing edge of 
the pulse relative to the lower frequencies at the leading edge of the pulse and hence 
compresses the signal to a width , where B = f2 – f1. The pulse compression filter is 
a matched filter; hence, its output envelope is the autocorrelation function of the 
input. Its analytic expression (derived earlier) is of the type sin(
)/(
)
B
B
π τ π τ . The peak 
power of the pulse is increased by the PCR, where PCR = T/ after passage through 
the filter. The LFM transmitted waveform and the output from the matched filter 
are shown in Figure 2.23.
Figure 2.23  LFM transmitted waveform and the output from the matched filter.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The ambiguity diagram for a LFM pulse compression waveform shows that a 
large Doppler shift in the echo signal can indicate a range that is not the true range. 
This effect is known as the range-Doppler coupling . In many cases, the range error 
due to the Doppler shift is small and can be tolerated. If the range is large, the ef-
fect of the Doppler shift error can be compensated for by averaging the two range 
indications obtained with an up-chirp and a down-chirp waveform of the same 
bandwidth.
The  envelope out of the matched filter of a LFM waveform has relatively high 
peak time sidelobes of –13.2 dB adjacent to the main response. This is usually not 
acceptable because it may be mistaken for further targets or mask some nearby 
weaker target. The amplitude of the time sidelobes can be reduced on reception by 
applying an amplitude weighting within the matched filter. The filter is thus mis-
matched and provides some loss to the SNR. Table 2.5 reports the first peak time 
sidelobe level and the relevant SNR loss and widening of the mainlobe response 
due to some weighting functions.
2.3.5.2  Binary Phase-Code Pulse Compression
An increase in signal bandwidth can be achieved by dividing a long pulse of dura-
tion T in N subpulses of duration and by changing the phase of each subpulse (the 
change of phase with time is a frequency). The simplest form of phase change is 
binary phase coding in which the phase of each subpulse can be selected as either 0 
or π rad according to some specified criterion. If the selection of the phases 0,π is 
made at random, the waveform approximates a noise-modulated signal, which has 
a thumbtack-like ambiguity diagram. 
The output of the matched filter is a compressed pulse of width  and amplitude 
N times greater than that of the long pulse. The PCR is thus PCR = N = T/τ, and 
the enlarged bandwidth is B = 1/τ.
The matched filter output (the autocorrelation function) is extended from –T 
to +T with respect to the peak response. Time sidelobes are always present, and 
if the selection of the phases is made at random the expected (power) maximum 
sidelobe (SLL) is about 2/N below the peak of the compressed output. So random 
selection of phases is not the favored criterion.
A better criterion is the selection of codes that provide equal (minimum) time 
sidelobes and these are the Barker codes, which are listed in Table 2.6. As can be 
noted from Table 2.6, the Barker codes have a maximum length of 13 and the sid-
elobe (power) level is 1/N2 that of the peak signal. The Barker code matched filter

is constituted by a tapped delay line as shown in Figure 2.24 for the Barker code 
of length N = 7.
Larger PCRs than those provided by the Barker codes can be obtained by an 
N-stage binary shift register with feedback and modulo 2 adder such as the one 
depicted in Figure 2.25. The actual sequence obtained depends on the feedback 
connections and the initial loading of the shift register. An N-stage binary device 
like the one depicted in Figure 2.25 has a total of 2N different possible states, with 
the exception of the state in which all the bits are 0. So it can generate a sequence 
of 2N – 1 bits, called the maximal length sequence or pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, 
after which the sequence will be repeated. 
There can be more than one maximal length sequence depending on the feed-
back connections. With the device of Figure 2.25, up to eight different maximal 
length sequences of length 31 can be generated. With the proper code, the highest 
(power) sidelobe level can be about 12 to 18 dB (or 1/2N to 2/N, with average 1/N) 
below the peak response (which achieves a PCR of N2 = 30 dB).
2.3.5.3  Polyphase Codes 
When more than two phase quantizations are applied to the subpulses of a long 
pulse the waveforms are called polyphase codes. In general, these codes produce 
lower sidelobe levels and are more tolerant to Doppler frequency shift than the 
binary phase codes.
An example of polyphase code is the Frank code of length M2, which is gener-
ated by an M × M square matrix. Each element of the matrix is defined as:

The Frank codes can be retained as approximating a stepped-LFM waveform, 
as shown in Figure 2.26.
The ambiguity diagram for a polyphase code is similar to that of a LFM wave-
form, but it can show a loss of about 3 to 4 dB in the signal at Doppler frequencies 
that are odd-integer multiples of π rad per subpulse. 
The highest time sidelobe of a polyphase code, relative to the peak of the com-
pressed pulse, is 1/(π2M2). In the example given above (M2 = 16 = 12 dB), the peak 
sidelobe is about –22 dB below the peak response.
Further polyphase codes are the so-called P codes, presented by Lewis and col-
leagues [7],which are also stepped approximations to LFM (P1 and P2 codes) or 
directly LFM (P3 and P4 codes).
Lewis [8] has also shown that the time sidelobes of the polyphase codes can 
be significantly reduced (by about 10 dB) by introducing at the output of the pulse 
compression filter a two-sample sliding window subtractor (in the case of Frank 
and P1 codes) or a two-sample sliding window adder (in the case of P3 and P4 
codes). 
With this additional processing, the time sidelobes of a polyphase code of 
length N are uniform and are at a level where SLL = 4/N2 relative to the peak. The 
width of the compressed pulse, however, is doubled (i.e., width = 2τ) and the PCR 
is N/2.For example in the case of a Frank code of N = M2 = 100 elements, the PCR 
= N/2 = 50 = 17 dB and the SLL = 4/N2 = –28 dB below the peak output. This is the 
SLL that would be achieved if a Barker code of 50 elements existed.
The importance of polyphase coding is that such codes increase substantially 
the code length, thus achieving large PCRs, while decreasing the time sidelobe level 
of the autocorrelation function (i.e., the matched filter output).

2.3.5.4  Costas Codes
The waveform, a frequency-hopping code, is generated by dividing the long pulse 
width T into a series of M contiguous subpulses of width τ, each at a frequency 
selected within a bandwidth B, as shown in Figure 2.27. The frequencies are sepa-
rated by the reciprocal of the subpulse width (i.e., Δf = 1/τ = M/T) and the band-
width B ≥ MΔf. Because the frequencies are selected at random, the ambiguity 
diagram has the thumbtack shape. The PCR is BT = MΔf · T = M2, but it is reached 
with only M = (BT)1/2 subpulses instead of the BT subpulses required for binary 
phase-coded pulses.
Not all combinations of M frequencies produce an ambiguity diagram with 
low sidelobes in time and frequency domains. Costas [6] has suggested a procedure 
for selecting the order of frequencies to achieve a nearly thumbtack ambiguity dia-
gram with a sidelobe level of 1/M2 relative to the peak power level in those regions 
of the ambiguity diagram away from the central peak and a SLL up to 4/M2 near 
the central peak.
The waveforms based on the Costas criterion are described in Chapter 6 of [3]. 
We recommend the interested reader consult that reference for deeper insight into 
these codes.
2.3.5.5  Further Coding
Nonlinear Frequency Modulation
NLFM offers the advantage over LFM of producing low time sidelobes, because the 
nonlinear rate of change of frequency has the same effect of amplitude weighting 
of the spectrum. In fact, if less time is spent over some part of the spectrum, this 
is equivalent to reducing the amplitude of that part of the spectrum. Further, there 
is no significant widening of the compressed pulse. When a symmetrical NLFM 
is used, the ambiguity diagram is that of a thumbtack, but as such is not Doppler 
tolerant. A nonsymmetrical NLFM waveform presents the classical ridge in the 
Figure 2.27  Costas code: (a) waveform time representation, (b) waveform frequency band, and (c) 
an example of transmitted waveform.

ambiguity diagram and has some of the range-Doppler coupling characteristics of 
the LFM.
Complementary Codes (Golay Codes)
Complementary codes are binary codes widely used in LPI radars, especially in air-
to-ground waveforms [9]. They are defined as a pair of equal length codes, called 
A and Ã, which have the property that the time sidelobes of the autocorrelation 
function of one code are equal in amplitude but opposite in sign with respect to the 
code’s complement. Therefore, if the autocorrelation functions of two complemen-
tary codes of length N are added, the resulting peak is 2N and the time sidelobes 
are identically zero, as shown in Figure 2.28.
By alternately transmitting the two codes and summing bin by bin, an infinite 
peak-to-sidelobe ratio can be achieved. In practice, implementation errors limit this 
performance to a high value better than 30 dB. Furthermore, good performance is 
also obtained for very long codes.
Golay [10] found complementary codes of length N = 2n, where n is an integer, 
and Welti [2] found complementary binary “D-codes” of length N = 2n that are 
formed from shorter complementary codes. More details on these codes can be 
found in [9].
The large variety of complementary codes used in LPI radars compels the ESM 
interceptors either to have a large number of parallel decoders or to use a square 
law detector across the entire radar operating bandwidth. The latter gives a detec-
tion loss of N1/2 with respect to the pulse compression of the emitter. This loss can 
be substantial when code lengths are larger than 104 (i.e., loss > 20 dB).
Complementary codes are not much used because they have two main weak-
nesses: (1) The uncancelled time sidelobes are present at fd = PRF/2 and (2) they are 
not Doppler tolerant, like all binary and polyphase codes.

2.3.5.6  Combined or Compound Barker Codes
Longer binary codes can be created as products of Barker codes. The inner Barker 
code of chip τ can be phase modulated by an outer Barker code, whose chip T is 
equal to 13τ. Thus, we can achieve a code length of 169 chips with a PCR of 169. 
The code and its autocorrelation function are shown in Figure 2.29. As can be noted 
from the autocorrelation function, the central peak is surrounded on each side by 
12 peaks of height 13, of which 6 are in the central region. These time sidelobes are 
quite high and it is necessary to introduce a sidelobe suppression filter [9], even at 
the expense of some loss in SNR (Table 5.2 of [9]  reports a SNR loss of –1.1 dB).

2.3.6  Surveillance Radars
2.3.6.1  Automatic Detection and Tracking with Surveillance Radars
Tracking with air-surveillance 2D radar with a mechanically rotating antenna is 
performed at a much lower data rate (i.e., the inverse of revisit time) between ob-
servations of the same target than a single target tracker. The latter has revisit times 
of less than a tenth of second, while the former can have revisit times of from one 
to many seconds (this is inversely reflected in the measurement tracking accuracy). 
The advantage of the surveillance radar is that it can track up to many hundred 
targets within its spatial coverage. Such a large amount of tracked targets requires 
automatic methods for target detection and coordinate extraction for track initia-
tion and tracking (i.e., track update and filtering) and this is what ADT does.
ADT is possible if the surveillance radar is able to eliminate clutter echoes, 
so the radar, in addition to Doppler processing (described in Section 2.3.3), must 
employ CFAR techniques to completely eliminate clutter echoes, even if CFAR 
techniques introduce some inconvenience (such as some limited detection loss and 
the suppression of weaker targets in the vicinity of a stronger one).
Automatic Detection
The coverage area (radius = maximum detection range) is quantized in range (range 
quantization is the equivalent pulse width range cτ/2, called a range bin) and in azi-
muth (usually the beamwidth). At each range-azimuth quantization cell, the pulses 
received during the TOT are integrated and a detection decision is made. CFAR is 
incorporated before the decision process. The pulse integration is performed in some 
sort of automatic integrator, such as the MWI, which examines continuously the 
last n pulses and announces the presence of a target if at least m out of n (secondary 
threshold) of the pulses exceed the primary threshold. MWI is thus determining an 
azimuth measurement, whose accuracy depends on the number of pulses available 
and their SNR. A rough rule of thumb is that the accuracy of azimuth measurement 
is about θB/5 at high SNR (see the discussion of MWIs in Section 2.3.2).
Track Initiation 
In principle, a track can be initiated from the above range-azimuth information on 
two successive scans of the radar. (The first detection initiates the process and the 
second one allows the computation of velocity and prediction of the third range-
azimuth detection.) In practice, however, to prevent false track initiation in the pres-
ence of a large number of echoes within the spatial coverage, target information is 
needed from three or more successive scans. The time elapsed after a detection to 
initiate a track can be too long for a quick defensive reaction and usually military 
radar have a look-back beam directed to the angle of the original detection. This 
can be achieved easily with a rotating phased array radar, or by providing a me-
chanically rotating radar with an additional look-back beam in order to get a quick 
second look of the detected target and to initiate a track.
Track Association
When a new target is detected, an attempt is made to associate it with an existing 
track. This is done by establishing for each track a predicted small area (or gate) 

66 
�����������������������������������對�����
Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
within which the target should appear at the next scan. To take into account a pos-
sible target maneuver initiated within the scan period, a larger area is also estab-
lished. When an echo is not found within the nonmaneuvering gate, the larger gate 
is then searched. Sometimes, due to signal fading, a nonmaneuvering target may not 
appear in the predicted position, while a further target is appearing in the larger 
(maneuvering) gate. To avoid the problem caused by a target fade and a false indi-
cation in the larger gate, the track can be divided into two tracks (this is known as 
bifurcation of the track): One is the old track with no detection in the smaller gate 
and the other is the new track based on the target found in the larger gate. After 
receiving the target detection on the next scan of the radar, a decision is made as to 
which of the two tracks should be dropped.
Track Smoothing (Filtering)
Two track smoothing methods are available: the α-β tracker and the Kalman filter. 
The former method is very effective for a linear target’s motion (constant velocity 
vector) and was used in the past because of its relative low computational complex-
ity. The latter filter, although more complex computationally, can inherently pro-
vide for maneuvering targets and is the most used currently thanks to the enormous 
computing capability of modern processors.
The discussion of the above two methods is beyond the scope of this book; we 
recommend the interested reader refer to [11].
2.3.7  LPI Radars
The low probability of intercept (LPI) requirement for a radar was generated in 
response to the increased capability of modern intercept receivers to detect and 
locate a radar emitter. The interception of a radar transmission can quickly lead to 
it either being jammed or being destroyed by means of precision guided munitions 
(PGMs) or ARMs [12].
The classical radar concept of using simple high-peak-power pulsed waveforms 
to achieve long detection ranges and good range resolution therefore turned into 
the modern radar concept of using:
•• Low sidelobe antennas,
•• Low-peak-power, CW type of transmission,
•• Power management (in the case of stealth applications),
•• A wideband modulation technique that achieves good range resolution,
•• Frequency agility waveforms with large compression ratios,
•• Infrequent antenna scan modulation or use of antennas with a broad non-
scanning Tx beam combined with a stationary set of high-gain Rx beams.
All the above features are conceived to make it difficult for an intercept receiver 
to achieve a detection range advance factor (RAF; see Chapter 3), as well as to clas-
sify the radar type and to identify the parameters of its waveform.
The change of waveforms exploits to the maximum degree the dependence 
of the detection capability of a radar on the energy collected by the receiver as 

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
67
backscattered by the target RCS. Energy is the product of the average transmitted 
power and the collection (or observation) TOT.
The typical duty cycle (or the ratio of average to peak transmitted power) of a 
classical coherent pulsed radar is 1% (or less) to 10%, while the typical duty cycle 
of modulated CW signals as used by modern LPI radars is 100%. This allows the 
LPI radar to use a substantially lower transmitting power to maintain the same 
detection capabilities of the classical coherent pulsed radar. LPI radars, therefore, 
transmit large–bandwidth, periodically modulated CW signals with incrementally 
variable transmitting periods.
The typical LPI waveforms are of the following types:
•• LFM and NLFM,
•• Phase modulation (PSK),
•• Frequency hopping (FSK),
•• Combined PSK/FSK,
•• Pseudorandom noise (PRN) modulation.
All these types of modulation have been discussed in previous sections because 
they are also used in coherent pulsed radars. In the following discussion we will 
first highlight, according to [13], the differences in the use of the above waveforms 
in an LPI radar and then discuss, as an example, the FMCW radar.
2.3.7.1  Phase-Coded CW Radar
The block diagram of a phase-coded CW radar is shown in Figure 2.30. The trans-
mitted signal is generated by a direct digital synthesizer (DDS). Various phase mod-
ulations can be used from time to time.
The target echo signal is amplified by a LNA, downconverted using a local 
oscillator (LO), and digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The

digitized samples are then processed by a digital compressor, which cross-correlates 
the transmitted code with the received signal.
The phase-coded CW waveform of duration T is constituted by a number Nc 
of subcodes of period tb, so the cross-correlation achieves a compression ratio (also 
called processing gain) 
PCR = T/tb = Nc. Further noncoherent integration of N codes is also performed 
by the digital processor to increase the processing gain by a factor of >N/√2.The 
phase-coded CW waveform is shown in Figure 2.31, where P > N indicates a larger 
number of periods than the noncoherently integrated ones. 
All of the LPI waveforms are further coded on transmission by a spreading 
code, called the reference signal, which is used to avoid detection and identification 
by noncooperative intercept receivers. The reference signal can take the form of an 
LFM, a FSK, or a PSK.
Due to the physical constraints, such as the illumination time and the size of 
the receiver’s correlation processor, which is constituted by FFT processors (for the 
FMCW waveforms) and finite duration coherent correlators (for PSK waveforms), 
only a portion of the continuously transmitted CW waveform is processed to ex-
tract the target information.
The LPI receiver correlates (or compresses) the received signal using the stored 
reference signal, which has a duration NT in order to perform target detection. So 
the correlation receiver is the “matched receiver” for portions of the received signal 
aligned to the reference signal (i.e., same duration as the latter) as shown in Figure 
2.32.
The LPI receiver can be modeled as a coherent correlation processor of finite 
duration NT as shown in Figure 2.32. The echo signal is received by the correla-
tion receiver, which performs a cross-correlation between the received signal and 
the stored reference signal, which is the complex conjugate of N periods of the 
transmitted signal with N < P. Before correlation the echo signal is first processed 
by a filter matched to the subcode of duration tb, which demodulates the subcode 
and provides a 0 or 1 bit relevant to the binary phase code of the waveform. The 
demodulated signal is the piped through a tapped delay line with delays D = tb. The 
signal in the tapped delay line is multiplied by the reference signal, and summed 
separately for each of the N code periods, thus performing the cross-correlation.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The output of the sum block can then be weighted by coefficients C1 to CN. If the 
coefficients of the first stage are all equal to 1, then the output represents the au-
tocorrelation function, which is the response of the receiver for zero Doppler shift 
(fd = 0). 
The responses of each of the successive M – 1 stages of the correlation proces-
sor, which constitute a Doppler filter bank, are the responses of the receiver to 
Doppler shifts kΔfd,( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., M – 1) as each bit of the echo signal is progres-
sively multiplied at each stage by a weight qi, where i = 0, 1, 2, …, NM – 1 and q = 
exp(j2πΔfdtb) and then passed to the corresponding element of the successive stage.
In phase-coded CW radar systems, the echo signals with Doppler shift do not 
correlate perfectly because the Doppler shift changes the phases of the code across 
its period and this effect has to be analyzed through the ambiguity function. Pace 
[13] listed the properties of the ambiguity function of the usable LPI waveforms by 
analyzing for each of them the (1) periodic autocorrelation function (PACF) and (2) 
periodic ambiguity function (PAF).
Further discussion of these properties is beyond the scope of this book, there-
fore we recommend the interested reader to refer to [13] for deeper insight into this 
topic.
2.3.7.2  FMCW Radar 
The two essential parameters required from a radar are the detection range (with 
defined statistical conditions Pd and Pfa, usually Pd ≥ 90% and Pfa ≤ 10–6) on a 
target with a defined RCS and the range resolution. The further target location 
parameters, the azimuth and elevation angles, are provided by the beamwidth of 
the receiving antenna.
For a CW radar that uses the same receiving antenna as a pulsed radar to pro-
vide the required parameters at the same level of a pulsed radar, it is necessary to 
transmit in sequence (or simultaneously) at least two CW waveforms at different 
carrier frequencies f1 and f2, separated by Δf = f1 – f2. The phase shifts of the echo 
signal with respect to the transmitted one at the two frequencies from a target at 
distance R are, respectively:

As an example if Δf = 10 kHz, we have Run = 15 km.
If instead of two frequencies a number n + 1 frequencies are used, spaced be-
tween with Δf (the so-called stepped frequency waveform), where fi = f0+i Δf, with 
i = 0, 1, 2, …., n, thus covering a bandwidth ΔF = f0+n Δf – f0 = n Δf, we can have 
a range resolution ΔR:

So, as an example by selecting Δf = 10 kHz and ΔF = 15 MHz, that is, n = 
1,500, we can have Run  = 15 km and ΔR = 10m.
Another way to achieve a large bandwidth and the accompanying benefits of 
good range resolution and unambiguity is to use the LFM (such as a sawtooth) CW 
waveform (FMCW) as depicted in Figure 2.33, which is characterized by a sweep 
of duration Tm and a frequency excursion ΔF.

which is called beat frequency and is proportional to the range R. Of course, the 
targets of interest for a radar are not only steady targets for which the measurement 
of the echo delay is sufficient, but also mobile targets, for which echoes are modu-
lated by the Doppler frequency.

that is, the steady target beat frequency less the usual Doppler frequency shift fd =

unambiguous interval is fdmax = 1/Tm and there is no range migration. Its resolution

thus providing a range-independent measure of the radial velocity.
To evaluate the angular coordinate of the target, a number of solutions can be 
adopted depending on whether two separate antennas are employed for transmis-
sion and reception (in case the power coupling is too high and can impair recep-
tion) or only one antenna is used for transmission and reception. In the first case 
the Tx antenna could be (1) either a directive (pencil beam ) or a (2) floodlight 
antenna. In this case the Rx antenna should be of the same type and aligned to the 
Tx one when scanning over its required spatial coverage. In this second case, the 
Rx antenna could be either a directive (pencil beam) antenna or a couple of broad 
beam antennas providing the measurement angle through the monopulse technique 
(see Section 2.8) based on either amplitude or interferometry (of course in the latter 
case taking into account that the distance between the two antenna phase centers 
is ≤λ/2) and that the receivers should be amplitude and phase matched. The block 
diagram of the FMCW radar is shown in Figure 2.35.
The processing gain of a radar is defined as PGR = SNRout/SNRin. In the case 
of an FMCW radar, the PGR = ΔFTm. The simplest FMCW radar receiver is the 
homodyne receiver, whose block diagram is depicted in Figure 2.36, in which a 
single antenna is used for Tx and Rx.
The appealing concept of FMCW radar had in the past a number of technologi-
cal problems that have since been solved, such as the following:

stant range and therefore also a degraded range resolution. The new technol-
ogy of a DDS-based open-loop and closed-loop frequency generator solved 
this problem. 
•• Single-antenna homodyne receivers were affected by power leakages (i.e., 
reflected power at the antenna) at the circulator and mixer stages, which 
reduced the receiver sensitivity. Currently a reflective power canceller, whose 
block diagram is shown in Figure 2.37, is available that provides better than 
30-dB cancellation.
•• A separate Tx and Rx antenna with increased isolation (up to 60 dB) so as to 
allow the introduction of a LNA in the Rx path.
To complete the discussion on FMCW radar, let us make a performance com-
parison between a coherent pulse radar and a FMCW radar based on two distinc-
tive parameters: detection range and range resolution.
The detection range equations of the two radars in terms of single-pulse SNRout 
are as follows:

Then let us assume that the second factor is equal in both expressions. The

Because the two parameters ΔF and Tm can be selected independently in the 
FMCW waveform, we can select a normal value such as Tm = 1 ms and ΔF = 20 
MHz (to achieve a range resolution of 7.5m with τ = 0.05 μs). The get the product 
TmΔF = 2 × 10–3 × 107 = 2 × 104 = 43 dB. This means that if we assume that the 
pulse radar needs a peak power Pp = 100 kW = 80 dBm to achieve a given detec-
tion range R, the FMCW radar needs only an average power Pav = 37 dBm = 5W. 
The big advantage of the FMCW radar is with respect to it intercept receiver, 
because if we assume that the pulse radar is intercepted at a distance R0, the FMCW 
will be intercepted at a distance R′/R0 = (Pav/Pp)1/2 = –21.5 dB = 0.707 × 10–2.
Table 2.7 compares the features of the FMCW and pulse/pulse Doppler radars.
2.3.8  Pulse Doppler Radars
In Section 2.3 when we discussed MTI Doppler processing, which is largely used 
in ground surveillance radars operating at relatively low frequencies, we showed 
that the PRF, which limits the nonambiguous Doppler shift range, was mainly se-
lected to avoid range ambiguities and hence tolerates some blind speeds (which 
were then removed through the PRF stagger). Also when discussing the AMTI, we 
discussed the need to not only compensate for the clutter not being any greater at

zero Doppler shift but also to compensate for the widening of the clutter spectra 
due to the antenna scanning during the platform motion.
For the case of high-speed aircraft, such as a fighter A/C, where the need for 
a compact antenna compels the use of high frequencies (around 9 GHz), we can 
immediately see that the PRF must be high in order not to reduce the Doppler shift 
range too much. The increased PRF immediately bears range ambiguities. Thus, 
there are three different types of pulse radars that use Doppler shift processing:
•• The MTI radar operating at low PRF with no range ambiguities and many 
Doppler ambiguities;
•• The high PRF (HPRF) PD with just the opposite: no Doppler ambiguities and 
many range ambiguities;
•• The medium PRF (MPRF) PD with some range and Doppler ambiguities.
In the past there were also differences in the structures of the three radar types, 
but current technology allows the use of a similar structure in which the differences 
reside in the transmitted waveforms and in the higher clutter power content in 
the PD radars (because of the foldover in the range of clutter echoes when range-
ambiguous PRFs are employed).
2.3.8.1  HPRF PD
Let us consider the geometry of an airborne radar when the A/C is flying straight 
and level (i.e., constant speed va and altitude ha) as shown in Figure 2.38. As the 
radar transmits a train of pulses of duration τ at the PRF = fp, it has a line spectrum 
(with envelope of the type sin πfτ/πfτ centered around the carrier frequency f0) with 
the separation between the spectral lines equal to the PRF. The clutter spectrum

around the carrier frequency is shown in Figure 2.39. At the carrier frequency f0 
there is a large return due to echoes received directly from below (altitude return), 
which is at zero relative speed to the aircraft. Because of the aliasing, the altitude 
line is repeated, (as well as any other contribution is at frequencies), f0 ± nfp (with 
n integer). 
The antenna sidelobes illuminate the clutter over a large number of incidence 
angles (from 0° to 90°), so that clutter echoes can extend almost for ±2vr/λ around 
the carrier frequency. For convenience , the shape of the sidelobe clutter is shown 
as being nearly uniform, but in reality it is not uniform.
The sidelobe clutter in a HPRF PD is large because there are many range-am-
biguous pulses simultaneously illuminating the clutter. To detect A/C targets within 
the sidelobe clutter, a bank of narrowband Doppler filters with adaptive thresholds 
can be used. To keep the sidelobe clutter sufficiently limited, the airborne radar 
antenna must have exceptionally low antenna sidelobes (on the order of better than 
–40 dB). The clutter echo seen by the main antenna beam can be large in amplitude 
and it lies somewhere within the sidelobe clutter region. Because the antenna scans 
in angles, the main beam center frequency varies.

quency of a HPRF airborne radar. (Reproduced with permission from G. Morris [14].)

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The presence of a clutter-free region is an important advantage of HPRF ra-
dars, because this region corresponds to viewing nose-on approaching targets (es-
pecially if detection of high-speed closing targets at long ranges is desired). If the 
relative velocity of the target is low (such as when the targets are viewed tail-on or 
when the target is on a crossing trajectory), the echo can fall within the sidelobe 
clutter region and its detectability is much less than that of a high-speed target in 
the clutter-free region.
The PRF of an X-band (around 9 GHz) HPRF PD radar for military use ranges 
from 150 to 300 kHz. With such a high PRF, the pulse width PW is usually short 
and in the order of 0.3 to 0.5 μs. By assuming a PRF of 200 kHz (i.e., Tp = 1/PRF 
= 5 μs) we have a duty d = PW/Tp = 10%. The PRF is selected on the basis of the 
maximum ground speed of the target and radar platform. In fact, by inspection 
of Figure 2.39 if we want the target be in the clutter-free region its Doppler shift 
should be at least 2(vA + vT)/λ far from f0 and 2vA/λ far from f0 + fp; thus fp > 4vA/λ 
+ 2vT/λ, where vA is the radar platform speed and vT is the target speed.
Eclipsing Loss
Because the pulse Doppler radar cannot receive when it is transmitting, the high 
duty cycle can result in an eclipsing loss if the echo signal arrives when a pulse is 
being radiated and the receiver is gated off. This effect produces holes in the range 
coverage, which are by their nature temporary because the relative motion of the 
target and platform will make the target appear after a short time (on the order of 
few hundreds milliseconds) at a shorter range. Eclipsing losses longer than 1 sec are 
not acceptable during tracking of a target; therefore, several PRFs are provided to 
reduce the effects of the eclipses.
2.3.8.2  MPRF PD
The MPRF mode has become one of the most important modes for modern air-
borne PD radar, primarily because of the capability it provides to detect slow clos-
ing rate targets from high-speed platforms. 
The equations for unambiguous velocity (vun = λPRF/2) and unambiguous 
range (Run = c/2PRF) are both functions of the PRF and therefore cannot be in-
dependently chosen. However, they are related at the X-band (λ = 3.3 cm) by the 
relation vun Run = λc/4 = 2.5 km2/s, which represents a hyperbola in the plane vun, 
Run and is shown in Figure 2.40.
Note from the curve of Figure 2.40 that between the two operating points 
that define, respectively, the maximum value of PRF that permits LPRF operations 
(PRFL ≤ 2 kHz) and the minimum PRF that permits HPRF operations (PRFH ≥ 150 
kHz) there is the domain of MPRF operations, which are characterized by ambigui-
ties in both range and velocity. The method for resolving both ambiguities employs 
the range-Doppler space relevant to a PRF and the use several PRFs in a dwell and 
it is drawn from [14], to whom we address the interested reader for deeper insight 
into the matter.
The criterion for resolving range and Doppler ambiguities of a target detected 
in a clear region of the range-Doppler space is that the target must be detected on 
at least two PRFs to resolve the range ambiguity. Usually the radars are designed to 

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
79
require detection on three PRFs to ensure proper range ambiguity resolution in the 
case for which two targets at different ranges may produce some ghosts (this will 
be shown later). Targets detected on fewer than three PRFs are discarded.
In Figure 2.41 the blind zones for two PRFs are represented. The unambiguous 
range is inversely proportional to the PRF as Run = c/2PRF. The blind region in the 
range dimension corresponds to the transmitted pulse width (Rblind = cPW/2) when 
the receiver is turned off. The unambiguous Doppler frequency fun is equal to the 
PRF. The blind region shown is the area in which main-beam clutter is expected, 
because it is here assumed (as used in early designs) that the carrier frequency is 
locked to the main-beam clutter frequency and a notch filter of width equal to the 
maximum width5 of the main-beam clutter is centered at the locked frequency. 
Currently MPRF signal processors translate the spectrum to center main-beam 
clutter at zero frequency. Target returns falling within the first shaded area  are 
detected unambiguously. Target detections falling within all of the shaded areas  of 
the range-Doppler domain are ambiguous in range or Doppler or both.
Range ambiguities are solved with the following considerations on the Figure 
2.42, which shows the target returns respectively at two PRFs. The true delay time 
of the target is Tt, and Ta1 and Ta2 are the apparent delays at PRF1 and PRF2, re-
spectively. The true delay Tt can be computed as a function of T1 = 1/ PRF1 and T2 
= 1/ PRF2 in that:
5.	
The spectral width of main-beam clutter varies with the speed of the aircraft and with the radar pointing 
angle.

Ideally the equations can be solved by finding the proper couple of values m 
and n. In practice, the delay measurements are corrupted by interference, quantiza-
tion errors, and noise, and no exact solution of m and n is possible. Rather a value 
of Tt that minimizes the difference is selected.
 A simple algorithm for determining Tt is as follows:
1.	 Compute trial values of Tt using (2.65) for increasing m and n.

2.	 The true value of Tt is the one that produces the minimum error by both 
equations of the set.
This simple algorithm is implemented in the resolving digital circuit depicted 
in Figure 2.43.
Usually the PRFs are selected in accordance with the following criterion: 
1.	 Select Rus, the desired system unambiguous range after range resolving.
2.	 Determine p PRFs, which are multiples of PRF0 = 1/2 Rus; that is, PRF1 = 
K PRF0, PRF2 = (K+1) PRF0, and so on until PRFp = (K + p) PRF0.
As mentioned, the resolution of range ambiguities requires the use of three 
PRFs, and the reason is the resolution of ghost targets, which are still possible from 
the detections of two targets in a two-PRF scheme.
Doppler ambiguities are resolved with the same method.
MPRF PD Search Mode
Because the target is generally ambiguous in both range and Doppler domains on 
any single PRF, several PRFs (usually seven to nine) are transmitted during a single 
antenna beam dwell on the target. Target detection on each PRF dwell is performed 
with use of a CFAR circuit. After resolution of range and Doppler ambiguities as 
shown previously, only targets for which an unambiguous range has been deter-
mined (upon detection by three or more PRFs) are declared detections and dis-
played. A typical display is shown in Figure 2.44 in which the vertical axis scale 
is the unambiguous range Rus. A typical MPRF radar search mode is hereafter 
reported [14]. A set of N PRFS to be transmitted, each comprising >2n valid pulses 
for Doppler analysis, is selected in order to reduce as far as possible the blind zones 
of the range-Doppler domains and to achieve an unambiguous system range Rus. 
The round-trip propagation time is Tp = 2Rus/c (ms) and therefore PRF0 = 1/Tp

(kHz). So the N PRFs can be selected in order to span a bandwidth ranging from 
PRF1 to PRFN at step 1/Tp kHz. The overall waveform timing during a beam dwell 
in one direction is reported in Figure 2.45 for the case N = 8 and beam dwell time 
TD = 40 ms.
The typical MPRF PD radar receiver processing is constituted by a bank of 
range bins in order to cover Tp,max: Each range bin is provided with a bank of Dop-
pler filters. The block diagram for MPRF PD radar receiver processing is shown 
in Figure 2.46. A picture of the GRIFO MPRF PD radar is shown in Figure 2.47.

In conclusion, Table 2.8 lists the principal characteristics of the three PRF 
modes of airborne PD radars, which can be performed by a multimode radar.
2.3.9  Tracking Radars
The tracking radar is an essential component of weapons systems for its ability to 
provide accurate target location information in range, azimuth, and elevation. Its 
continuous observation of the target over time can provide the target’s trajectory 
or track and predict where it will be next. This information is used by the weapons 
systems for precision aiming of guns and for missile guidance.
At least four types of radars can provide tracks of targets:
1.	 Single target tracker (STT),
2.	 Automatic detection and tracking (ADT),
3.	 Track-while-scan (TWS),
4.	 Phased array tracking.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types

STT radars are designated by a search radar that has detected the presence of 
a threat and designated it with approximate coordinates (at least range and azi-
muth). Upon target designation the STT performs a rapid search around the des-
ignated target’s location to acquire the target within its narrow beamwidth. If the 
designation is 3-D, the STT can almost immediately acquire the target; otherwise, 
it performs a search in elevation and over a narrow azimuth sector. Figure 2.48 
shows a typical STT acquisition scan.
As soon as the target has been acquired, the STT passes into tracking mode 
and provides the associated weapon system with the target’s precise location coor-
dinates. The required precision of an STT is on the order of 0.2 to 0.5 mr (rms) in 
angles and 1 to 5m in range. The smaller figures apply to gun’s fire control systems.
STT types differ in angular precision, complexity, and cost and are listed here 
in increasing order:
1.	 Conical scan, 
2.	 Lobe switching,
3.	 COSRO (conical scan on receive only),
4.	 LORO (lobe switching on receive only),
5.	 Monopulse.
STT types 1 through 4 use sequentially a single time-shared beam in at least 
four positions (more for types 1 and 3) to obtain an angle measurement in two 
coordinates. Type 5 (monopulse) uses the equivalent of four simultaneous beams 
to perform 2-D angle tracking.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
2.3.9.1  Conical Scan
In this type of radar, the beam axis is not aligned with the antenna boresight, but 
nutates around it, describing a cone of width 2θq (where θq is called the squint an-
gle) as shown in Figure 2.49. A target along the axis of the cone will be illuminated 
by a constant gain, even if it is not the maximum, while targets located off-boresight 
will be illuminated by a gain that is modulated at the conical scan frequency fs = 
Ω/2π as shown in Figure 2.50.
The depth of modulation and phase of the maximum with respect to two refer-
ences (azimuth and elevation) provide the amplitude and the direction (in azimuth 
and elevation) of the angular error ε(t), whose expression is:

(2.66)
The depth of modulation ksΔθt depends on the ratio θq/θB, where θq is the 
squint angle and θB is the 3-dB antenna beamwidth as shown in Figure 2.51. The 
selection of the squint angle θq is a trade-off between the increase in the angular 
sensitivity ks and the gain losses, which reduce the SNR and hence the detection 
capability. Usually θq is selected to be between 0.3 and 0.4 θB.
When in tracking mode the STT radar places a gate on the range axis of the 
receiver so as to allow output signals only within this gate of width approximately 
equal to the pulse width. The signal amplitude within the gate is controlled by an 
automatic gain control (AGC) loop. The gate is then automatically positioned at 
the target range by means of an automatic range-tracking closed loop, whose input 
is provided by the split-gate discriminator operating on the output video signal. 
This discriminator splits the video signal into two gates: an early gate and a late 
gate, where the two signals are integrated and then subtracted to produce the dif-
ference error signal as shown in Figure 2.52. The sign of the difference indicates 
the direction the two gates have to be moved in order to have the pair straddle the 
echo. The amplitude of the difference determines how far the pair of gates is from 
the center of the pulse (sometime called the centroid). When the error signal is zero, 
the two range gates are centered on the pulse and the position of the gates gives the 
target’s range. The automatic range tracking loop is usually a second (or higher) 
order loop capable of range tracking in range maneuvering targets with accelera-
tions in range on the order of some g (g = gravity acceleration = 9.8 m/s2). A typical 
range tracking second-order loop is shown in Figure 2.53.
An ECCM method widely used by STT-type missile seekers, especially the ones 
on board sea-skimming missiles, is to use frequency agility pulse to pulse and dif-
ferent weights to the early-late gates of range tracking. By assigning a weight α to 
the early gate and β to the late gate, with α > β, the range tracking is positioned in 
the front of the received pulse, thus reducing the effect of a possible range decep-
tion from a jammer (because the jammer pulse is always delayed with respect to 
the echo signal by the frequency setting time due to the frequency agility). This 
ECCM is called leading-edge tracking or antirange gate stealing and is very effec-
tive when applied with a logarithmic receiver. This ECCM will be further discussed 
in Chapter 6.
The video signal within the tracking gate at the output of the receiver is also 
sent to a coherent detector, which determines—after processing the amplitudes of 
many received pulses—the depth of modulation and the phase of the modulated 
signal with respect to two reference (azimuth and elevation) sinusoidal signals at 
scan frequency but 90° out of phase with each other. As mentioned earlier the 
maximum received amplitude indicates the amplitude of the angular error, while 
the phases of the maximum received amplitude with respect to the two reference 
signals indicate the direction (azimuth and elevation) of the error. This information 
is fed to the automatic servo loops that control azimuth and elevation of the an-
tenna boresight in order to reduce to zero the angular error relevant to the target. 
The schematic block diagram of the conical scan STT is shown in Figure 2.54.
By using a second central fixed feed for transmission and using the notating 
feed only on reception, it is possible to avoid the amplitude modulation on trans-

mission, which can be used by a jammer to produce angular errors to the STT. This 
arrangement characterizes the COSRO STT.
2.3.9.2  Lobe Switching 
By switching a beam sequentially over four positions (two in azimuth and two 
in elevation), the error signal from a target not located on the switching axis (the 
boresight ) can be determined by the difference between the received amplitudes at 
the two switched positions for each angular coordinate, as shown in Figure 2.55
The direction in which to move the beam in order to bring the target along the 
boresight is given by observing which beam position provides the larger amplitude. 
When the echo signals in the two beam positions are equal, the target is along the 
boresight direction. The lobe-switching radar thus is constituted by a square cluster 
of four feed horns illuminating a single reflector antenna. Each feed is illuminat-
ing the reflector in sequence, thus proving its squinted beam with respect to the 
antenna boresight. 
Figure 2.53  Range tracking loop.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
A cluster of five feed horns can also be used, with a central feed used for trans-
mission and the four outer feeds used for reception on a sequential basis. This 
arrangement, which characterizes a LORO STT, is used to avoid the amplitude 
modulation on transmission, which can be used by a jammer to produce angular 
errors to the STT. 
Range tracking and angular tracking methods in these types of STT are the 
same as those for the conical scan STT.
2.3.9.3  Monopulse
A monopulse tracker obtains the information concerning the angular location of a 
target by comparison of signals received in two or four simultaneous beams. Angle 
measurement with simultaneous signals improves measurement accuracy because 
it avoids the degradation that results from signal amplitude changes (fluctuations) 
with time. The monopulse angle method is used in STT to provide an angle error 
signal in two orthogonal angle coordinates that are used to feed the closed-loop 
servo system to keep the boresight positioned in the direction of the moving target.
Two general methods are used to exploit monopulse angle measurement: am-
plitude-comparison monopulse and phase-comparison monopulse. They are dis-
cussed next.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
91
Amplitude-Comparison Monopulse (ACM)
The concept of the ACM method is easily explained in only one angle coordinate 
by considering two overlapping antenna patterns with their main beams pointed in 
slightly different directions (squinted beams) as in Figure 2.56(a). The beams can 
be generated by two feeds slightly displaced in opposite directions from the focus 
of a parabolic reflector. The ACM method employs both the sum and the difference 
of the two squinted beams as shown in Figures 2.56(a) and (b). The sum pattern is 
used on transmission, while both the sum and the difference patterns are used on 
reception. The signal received with the difference pattern provides the magnitude of 
the angle error. The direction of the angle error is found by comparing the phase of 
the difference signal with the phase of the sum signal as can be derived from Figure 
2.56(c). 
By adding two more feeds in order to form a square cluster of four squinted 
feeds (two for each angle coordinate), the sum pattern is formed by the sum of the 
four squinted patterns, while two difference patterns are formed: one relevant to 
the azimuth and the other relevant to the elevation as shown in Figure 2.57. The 
comparator shown in Figure 2.57 is the circuitry, composed of hybrid-T waveguide 
components, that performs the addition and subtraction of the feed horn outputs 
to obtain the monopulse sum and difference signals
Almost all high-class monopulse STTs employ the Cassegrain reflector an-
tenna, whose principle is shown in Figure 2.58. Its implementation as a Selex SI 
RTN 30X is shown in Figure 2.59. The introduction of this type of antenna with 
a polarization twist technique at the subreflector allowed the microwave circuitry 
to be placed behind the parabolic reflector and eliminated the antenna blockage 
problem.

Signals received from the sum and difference patterns are amplified separately 
and combined in a phase-sensitive detector to produce the angle-error signal. The 
sum signal also provides target detection and range measurement. 
A simplified block diagram of a conventional monopulse STT is shown in Fig-
ure 2.60. As can be seen from the figure, the AGC loop and the range tracker are 
similar to those of a conical scan STT. The main difference here is that the AGC 
from the sum channel is fed back to control the gain of all three channels (Σ, Δaz, Δel) 
so as to provide the STT with a constant angle sensitivity independent of changes 
in target cross-section fluctuations or changes in range and, most important, with 
immunity to amplitude jamming modulations in order to introduce angular errors.

As can be noted from the monopulse STT block diagram, the sum signal Σ is 
used to demodulate coherently the two Δ signals and to provide the angle-error

where Σ and Δ denote the phasors of the respective signals, and the scalar product is 
used to determine both the normalized amplitude as well as the phase relationship 
between the two phasors and hence the sign of the Δ signal. The division by Σ2 is 
achieved by means of the AGC as discussed above.
The ACM angular error sensitivity is dependent (similar to the conical scan 
method) on the ratio of the squint angle θq to the beamwidth θB of each squinted 
pattern, in that the greater the squint angle, the greater will be the slope of the 
error. However, as the squint angle increases, the on-axis gain of the sum pattern 
decreases and thus a trade-off has to be made between these two diverging require-
ments. The optimum value for squint angle θq was evaluated in Figure 4.7 of [3], 
assuming that the shape of the squinted beams can be modeled by a Gaussian func-
tion. The optimum squint angle was found to be θq = 0.31θB. This corresponds to 
a crossover of 1.2 dB down from the Σ beam peak.
The comparison of the slopes of the ACM and conical scan STT, as reported in 
Figure 4.7 of [3], shows the superior angular error sensitivity of the ACM, which 
can achieve angular accuracies on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mrad (rms).
Phase-Comparison Monopulse (PCM)
In the PCM method two antenna beams are used to obtain an angle measurement in 
one coordinate, as for the ACM method. The two beams are parallel and cover the 
same region of space. The amplitude of the received signals are the same, but their 
phases are different by an amount Δφ = 2πd sin θ/λ, where d is the spacing between 
the two antennas and θ is the direction of the arrival with respect to the normal to 
the baseline of the two antennas. The measurement of the phase difference of the 
two received signals provides the angle θ to the target. The overall antenna used to 
achieve the two angle coordinates is thus an array of four antennas arranged in two 
rows and two columns. 
Angle information can be extracted by employing sum and difference patterns 
and processing the signals similarly to the ACM method. To get at the output of the 
phase detector, an error signal whose amplitude is a function of sin θ a 90° phase 
shift has to be added to the difference signal as shown in Figure 2.61, which also 
shows the block diagram of a conventional PCM STT (in one angle coordinate).
The PCM method can be affected by the grating lobes (see Appendix C) of an 
array with two elements (θgrating = sin–1(λ/d)), where d is the separation (which is 
also the diameter of each antenna) between the two antennas. Thus, the separation 
d should be smaller than λ, but this in turn implies a low antenna gain. Due to this 
limitation the PCM STT has had very few applications in comparison to the ACM 
STT.
2.3.9.4  Limitations to Tracking Accuracy
Three types of error sources affect the angular and range accuracies of a STT:
1.	 Target-caused errors, such as amplitude fluctuations of the target (not af-
fecting the monopulse STT); glint, which affects both range and angle ac-
curacies; and Doppler scintillation and spectral lines;
2.	 External causes of error, such as multipath in low-angle tracking;
3.	 Internal sources or errors, such as receiver thermal noise.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
95
Of the above angular error sources, in this section we discuss only target glint 
and multipath in low-angle tracking because some ECM techniques (discussed in 
Chapter 6) tend to exploit the above limitations to increase the monopulse tracking 
errors to cause an angular break-lock to the STT. 
2.3.9.5  Glint
Glint is the term commonly used to describe the fluctuation of a complex tar-
get’s RCS, when it is composed of many scattering centers within the resolution 
cell of the radar. Each scatterer response arrives at the antenna with slightly dif-
ferent wave tilts, and these tilted wavefronts add vectorially across the aperture 
to give a composite disuniform and distorted wavefront with respect to the ideal 
planar wavefront coming from a single scatterer target. This produces an error on 
the angle-of-arrival measurement. Furthermore, the measured angle of arrival can 
sometimes cause the boresight of the tracking antenna to point outside the angular 
extent of the target, which can cause the radar to break track. The greater the ex-
tent of the target in angle as seen by the radar, the worse will be the angle measure-
ment—which constitutes a major cause of angle errors at short ranges. Glint affects 
all types of STT radars.
Qualitative effects of angular glint can be derived by the dumbbell target mod-
el, constituted by two independent isotropic scatterers separated by an angular 
distance α as measured from the radar. In this discussion we apply the same sym-
bolism of Section 6.3 of Chapter 6 in order to ease the reader into the evaluation 
of the cross-eye ECM technique 
The two scatterers are symmetrically located (at ±α/2) with respect to the an-
tenna boresight, as shown in Figure 2.62. The relative amplitude of the echo signals 
is assumed to be a ≤ 1 and the relative phase φ ≤ π rad. Differences in the phase of

the two scatterers might be caused by slight differences in range between the two 
scatterers. The angular error Δθ as measured from the larger of the two isotropic 
scatterer is given by [17] (and will be also derived in Chapter 6) as:

The equation is plotted in Figure 2.62. The larger of the two scatterers is lo-
cated at ε/α = 0 and the smaller at ε/α = +1. Positive values of ε correspond to the 
angular region to the left of the larger scatterer, and negative values of ε correspond 
to the angular region to the right of it. When the echo signals from both scatterers 
are in phase (φ = 0), we have ε/α = a (a +1), sometimes called the center of gravity 
of the two scatterers. When the two echo signals are at the same amplitude (a = 1) 
and the phase difference is φ = π rad, (2.67) indicates ε/α → –∞; that is, the antenna 
is driven well outside the bounds of the dumbbell target. Equation (2.67) has been 
derived for small angle errors; hence, it is not applicable for angular errors as large 
as ε/α → –∞. Nevertheless the simple dumbbell target model describes the behavior 
to be expected by a STT radar subjected to glint from a complex target.
Equation (2.67) indicates that the tracking error ε is proportional to the angu-
lar extent of the target α as seen by the radar. This implies that the error becomes 
larger as the range becomes shorter.
A slightly more complex model than the two-scatterer target considers many 
individual equal RCS scatterers aligned uniformly along a line of length L per-
pendicular to the line of sight from the radar. The resultant RCS of such a target 
is assumed to behave according to the Rayleigh pdf and there is a probability of

13.4% that the apparent direction of the target measured by the radar is outside of 
the target region. A commonly used design equation is to consider the rms angular 
error σg due to glint to be σg = 0.3L/R, where L is the extent of the target and R the 
range to the target.
Glint also affects range tracking. By assuming a two-scatterer target model 
similar to the one used for angular glint with a separation in distance cΔT/2, the 
error ΔTR due to range glint relative to the center of the two scatterers (where the 
early-late range-tracker should be centered) is:

Also in this case the rms range error σgR due to glint can be assumed to be σgR 
= 0.15LR where LR is the span of the target in range.
The methods used most often to reduce glint are frequency agility and pulse 
compression. A change of frequency results in a change in the relative phase of 
the scatterers and hence in ε and ΔTR. The frequency change must be sufficient 
to decorrelate the phase measurement (the phase must change for more than 2π 
rad) and thus must be on the order of Δf > c/D (where c is the speed of light and 
D is the dimension of the target in the relevant axis). A number n < 4 of frequen-
cies are sequentially transmitted. Then the relevant angle and range measurements 
weighted in accordance with their SNR and averaged, thus reducing the glint error 
by a factor >n1/2.A better result is achieved by taking only the measurements at the 
frequency that results in maximum SNR, because this reduces the single-frequency 
glint by a factor n. The drawback of this remedy is that MTI or pulse Doppler 
processing cannot be used.
Range and angle accuracy are highly improved by pulse compression, which 
reduces the range cell resolution and hence the number of scatterers within it. High 
range resolution can be used in conjunction with MTI or pulse Doppler processing.
2.3.9.6  Receiver Noise
All theoretical expressions for the rms value of the error of a radar measurement 
are inversely proportional to the square-root of SNR. Because the maximum detec-
tion range of the radar is inversely proportional to SNR1/4, the rms error values are 
therefore proportional to R2. Receiver noise is a major factor limiting the accuracy 
of radar at long range where the SNR is small. The rms error in angle measurement 
has been given by [12] and is:

θB is the –3-dB beamwidth,
ks is the slope of the angle-error signal at the boresight and is dependent on the 
measurement method (ks = 1.57 for a good four-horn feed, and ks = 1.5 for an 
optimized conical scan),
B is the signal bandwidth,
τ is the pulse width (Bτ ≈ 1).
SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio per pulse,
fp is the pulse repetition frequency,
βn is the servo bandwidth (fp/2βn is the number of pulses integrated).
The contributions of glint and receiver noise to the accuracy of both angular 
tracking methods (conical scan and monopulse) for STT radar as a function of 
range were evaluated by Barton [12] who showed that tracking accuracy deterio-
rates at both long and short ranges with the best accuracy occurring at the inter-
mediate ranges.
At short ranges the prevailing error is due to the glint with an error that var-
ies inversely with range; at large range the prevailing error is due to receiver noise, 
which causes the error to vary as the square of the range. The conical scan tech-
nique is affected by amplitude fluctuations, whereas the monopulse method is not.
2.3.9.7  Low-Angle Tracking 
A radar that tracks at low elevation angles illuminates the target via two paths as 
shown in Figure 2.63. One is the direct path from radar to target and the other is 
the path with a reflection from the Earth’s surface. It is as if the radar were illumi-
nating two targets: the real one above the surface and its image below the surface. 
The situation is similar to the two-scatterer target model discussed with regard to 
glint, and in this case errors in elevation angle occur, which can be very large. Fur-
ther, at low grazing angles, over a perfectly smooth reflecting surface (as can occur 
with a calm sea), the complex reflection coefficient r = ρ exp (jψ) is nearly ρ = 1 
in amplitude and ψ = π rad in phase, so that the signal reflected from the surface 
(and reaching the target image) is nearly equal in amplitude and out of phase with 
respect to the signal following the direct path to the target.
This situation is equivalent to the undesirable condition for the angle error due 
to glint. For this reason the tracking of targets at low elevation angles is subject

2.3  Radar Principles and Types

to significant errors in the elevation angle; they can even cause loss of the target’s 
track. The surface-reflected signal is also called a multipath signal, and the glint 
error due to low grazing angle tracking is called a multipath error. Multipath er-
rors affect both radar guidance of missiles to targets low on the sea as well as the 
tracking of surface and shipboard STTs used for defense against low-altitude cruise 
missiles or sea-skimming missile attacks.
Howard [16], following the dumbbell target approach, expressed the target 
glint error as ]similar to (2.67)]:

where e is the error (m), h is the height of the target (m), ρ is the amplitude of the 
reflection coefficient, and φ is the relative phase determined by the geometry of the 
direct and surface-reflected signal paths.
The effects of multipath signals depend on what part of the antenna pattern 
hits the Earth’s surface. Howard [16] identified three regions in relation to eleva-
tion angle γ:
1.	 Sidelobe region, where only near sidelobes in elevation illuminate the sur-
face. This occurs when the tracking is at close range. The angle accuracy 
begins to be degraded when the elevation angle γ < 6θB above the horizon. 
The expression of the rms multipath error in this region, which shows a 
cyclic behavior, is given by Howard [16]:

Gse(peak) = power ratio of the tracking-antenna sum pattern to the error 
pattern peak sidelobe level at the angle of arrival of the image signal.
	
  The cyclic behavior of the error is due to the maxima and minima deter-
mined by the combination of direct and surface-reflected signal paths in 
accordance with the geometry.
2.	 Main beam region, where the multipath effects begin to be severe because 
the elevation angle is about γ ≈ 0.8θB.
3.	 Horizon region, where elevation angle γ ≈ 0, and the multipath error be-
comes very severe.
Many methods for reducing the large elevation angle error caused by the  
multipath signals at low angles have been demonstrated, but not a single method 
was shown suitable for all the applications where low-angle tracking is required, 
because each has its limitations. The methods discussed next, dealing mainly with 

100 
�����������������������������������對�����
Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
the elimination of the large errors that occur when the main beam illuminates the 
surface, have had application.
Narrow Beamwidth
The reduction of the beamwidth θB reduces the situations in which the antenna 
beam illuminates the surface, but requires either larger antennas or higher frequen-
cies. Both solutions are not always practicable. The method has been successfully 
adopted by employing two radars, one at the X-band (9 GHz) and the other at the 
Ka-band (35 GHz) using a single antenna system to provide operation at the two 
frequencies. Because the lower frequency radar has a longer detection range, it is 
used for target acquisition. Then precision low-altitude tracking is performed by the 
higher frequency radar.
Similar solutions have been applied with short-range STTs by adding on the 
same radar antenna pedestal some optical or IR sensors that have far better angle 
resolution. In these solutions the low-angle tracking is performed by the EO/IR sen-
sor and range tracking by the radar. 
Illogical Target Trajectory
Because aircraft or missile targets will not likely go below the surface of the Earth 
and are limited in their ability to accelerate in elevation (either upward or down-
ward), radar tracking data indicative of unreasonable target behavior can be rec-
ognized and rejected. In some situations, the target might be flying so fast and the 
inertia of the antenna so large that the angle-error excursion caused by the mul-
tipath signal (usually at short ranges) is dampened. 
Off-Boresight Monopulse Tracking
We can determine when the target is in the low-angle region by sensing large ele-
vation-angle errors. Hence, the antenna can be locked at a small positive elevation 
angle (usually about 0.7 to 0.8θB) while continuing closed-loop azimuth tracking. 
With the beam fixed at a positive elevation angle, the rms tracking accuracy is 
worsened to typically 0.3θB, but wide swings of the antenna and loss of track are 
avoided.
2.3.9.8  Track While Scan in a Limited Sector Scan
This type of radar rapidly scans a relatively narrow angular sector, usually both in 
azimuth and elevation, performing search and track functions. Scanning may be 
performed with a narrow-beamwidth pencil beam that covers a rectangular sector 
in raster fashion or with two orthogonal fan beams, which scan the azimuth and 
elevation sector, respectively. TWS radars have been used in airport landing radars, 
airborne interceptors, and air defense systems.
With respect to the STT, there is no closed-loop positioning of the antenna, 
and the angle output is directly provided to the data processor as described for the 
surveillance radars. Hence, the TWS radar can provide simultaneous tracking of 
many targets within its sector of coverage, albeit with less accuracy than a STT.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types 
101
In airborne-interceptor applications the TWS might be preferred when multiple 
targets are to be tracked with accuracy sufficient to launch fire-and-forget missiles, 
which contain their own guidance systems for homing in on the target. 
TWS radars have been used in precision approach radars (PARs) or ground-
controlled approach (GCA) systems to guide aircraft to a landing. In the past con-
trol of aircraft landing involved the use of TWS radars that had electromechanical 
scanners that scanned fan beams over a narrow sector of 20° azimuth and 7° eleva-
tion at a rate of twice per second. Current TWS radars have phased array antennas 
that use monopulse angle measurements.
In the air defense systems TWS radars have been used, especially by the former 
Soviet Union, for the control of weapons in SAM systems for both land- and ship-
based systems. TWS radars that perform continuous regular scanning of a sector 
are vulnerable to angle jamming.
2.3.9.9  Tracking with a Phased Array Radar 
Tracking with a phased array (PA) radar is more like that of a TWS radar or auto-
matic tracking with a surveillance radar than the continuous track of a STT. The 
advantage of a PA radar is that it can have a much higher data rate than radars with 
mechanically scanned antennas and it can simultaneously track multiple targets 
within a large sector by time sharing a single antenna beam. This is possible because 
of the rapid inertialess (electronic scanning) beam positioning, which allows for 
switching of the direction of the beam in a couple of microseconds. Angle measure-
ment is monopulse.
2.3.10  Synthetic Aperture Radars
Airborne and spaceborne SARs have become a highly used application to provide 
high-resolution ground mapping that is capable of allowing recognition of topo-
graphic features and objects (almost fixed) of interest on the ground or sea (such as 
buildings, tanks, armored vehicles, and ships).
The quality of the ground maps produced by radar is determined by the resolu-
tion cell size, which in the case of SAR, which is an airborne radar, has two com-
ponents: range and cross-range. Because the features of the terrain may be oriented 
in any direction, ideally the two resolution dimensions should be equal, making the 
resolution cell a square pixel.
Although it is possible through pulse compression techniques (discussed in Sec-
tion 2.3.4) to obtain very high range resolution, the achievement of a fine cross-
range resolution requires a very large antenna on the order of tens to a hundred me-
ters, which is not feasible on an aircraft. In lieu of an actual antenna, the required 
resolution is achieved through a synthetic aperture (or an array of equivalent re-
quired width) obtained by the forward motion of the airborne radar.
The SAR concept is illustrated in Figure 2.64, in which an airborne radar, with 
an antenna of diameter D and thus with a beamwidth θB = kλ/D (rad), transmits 
pulses with a period Tp. Each time a pulse is transmitted, the radar occupies a posi-
tion a little further (Δx = v Tp) along the flight path (x-axis). By summing coher-
ently the return from successive pulses, it is possible to synthesize a very long linear 
array.

102 
�����������������������������������對�����
Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The fundamental difference between a real array and the synthetic one is that 
in the former the return from each scattering point is received simultaneously by 
all elements of the array, whereas in the latter the return is collected by the real 
airborne antenna sequentially over the period of time the radar takes to traverse 
the array.
The returns from a scattering point at distance R from the radar can be col-
lected during the period T = RθB/v in which the point is illuminated by the antenna 
beam. Thus, the dimension of the synthetic array is LSAR = vT = RθB . With such a 
dimension for the array, the equivalent beamwidth is θ = kλ/(2LSAR), where the fac-
tor 2 takes into account that the phase contributions to the coherent sum (integra-
tion) are relevant to the two-way path radar to scatterer. Therefore, the cross-range 
resolution of the SAR is:

and the SAR cross-range resolution is independent of range and wavelength and 
only proportional to the size D of the real antenna of the radar.
However, to achieve the preceding result, which is called focused resolution, 
some corrections have to be added to the phase of the returns due to the geometri-
cal variation of the range of the point scatterer along the integration period T. The 
variation is shown in Figure 2.65, from which we derive the following corrections. 
These corrections have to be applied to the returns integration process in order to 
obtain a focused resolution:

Thus, we can observe that the cross-range (azimuth) Doppler history has the 
same behavior as a chirped pulse (but on different time and frequency scale) and 
that SAR azimuth compression is similar to the pulse compression technique. As 
can be seen from Figure 2.65 the focusing algorithm applies to the linear region of 
the Doppler frequency history.
SARs have two main modes of operation (see Figure 2.66): either swath or 
strip-map mode or spotlight mode. In the former mode the antenna is fixed on one 
side of the aircraft and provides the image of a swath along the flight path. In the 
latter mode the antenna is always pointed to a specific area during the flight path. 
Spotlight mode provides more accurate images of the illuminated area than does 
swath mode. 
SAR processing is a very intensive computational task. Real-time imagery re-
quires very fast computing hardware that is not always available on board aircraft; 
hence, the alternative is to downlink the raw data to a processing center on the 
ground. In practice, real-time processing is always “near-real-time” because there 
is a small delay (seconds) between the collection of data and the display of the 
image.
SAR systems nowadays are used more often on small aircraft or UAVs that 
present an unstable platform motion; therefore, it is necessary to restore SAR im-
age focusing and geometric accuracy. Corrections can be approached either on 
motion measurements using both inertial navigation systems (INSs; i.e., gyroscopes

and accelerometers) and GPS or with autofocus algorithms (i.e., error estimation 
from SAR data). 
Additional SAR systems are the polarimetric SAR and the interferometric SAR. 
The polarimetric SAR exploits alternate transmission in H and V polarization. 
The returns are collected by two receiving channels in H and V polarization and 
processed (after being recorded) in both amplitude and phase difference in four 
channels: HH, HV, VH, and VV. The data from the scattering polarization matrix 
provide a more complete description of the targets: better contrast, discrimination 
between even and odd bounces of the terrain, and thus enhanced classification of 
them. 
The interferometric SAR uses a couple of antennas at a distance Δx from each 
other placed on the belly of the aircraft. Through the differential phase measure-
ment of the scatterer returns at the two antennas, it is possible to measure the rela-
tive height of the target (with respect to the terrain) as shown in Figure 2.67. Very 
accurate measurements of aircraft positions and movements are required to obtain 
a height map. 
A further use of the SAR technique is exploited by fixed radars as a nonco-
operative target identification technique. Indeed, using the SAR algorithm to ex-
ploit the various returns of the target along a pass-course trajectory (in each return 
the target presents a different aspect to the radar, that is, a rotational movement 
around the vertical axis; see Figure 2.68) can provide a good image of the target. 
This technique is called inverse SAR (ISAR).
2.3.11  Bistatic Radars
A bistatic radar is, by definition, one in which the transmitter and receiver are 
deployed at two separate locations, which can change with time. The base length 
between the two sites is usually comparable to the ranges to the targets of interest. 
With this consideration over-the-horizon (OTH) radars, notwithstanding Tx and

Rx that are separated by hundreds of kilometers, are considered monostatic as their 
range is thousands of kilometers. Bistatic radars have been designed, developed, 
and deployed for military, commercial, and scientific applications. Typical military 
applications include air and space surveillance and traffic surveillance. They are, 
however, niche applications.
Bistatic radars can operate with dedicated transmitters, which are designed 
for bistatic operation and controlled by the bistatic radar, or with transmitters of 
opportunity, that is, transmitters that are designed for other purposes, but found 
suitable for bistatic operation even when not controlled by the bistatic radar.
When the Tx of opportunity is from a monostatic radar, the bistatic radar is 
called a hitchhiker.
When the Tx of opportunity is from a broadcast station or a communication 
link, the bistatic radar has been called by many names such as passive radar, pas-
sive bistatic radar (PBR), passive coherent location (PCL), and parasitic radar. In 
military scenarios transmitters of opportunity are designated either cooperative, if 
it is an allied or friendly Tx, or noncooperative, if the Tx is hostile or neutral.
Multistatic radars are composed of a number of bistatic pairs or they can use 
triangulation of the scattered energy from a Tx illumination by taking direction-
of-arrival (DOA) measurements from multiple receiver sites, as used by a SPASUR 
(space surveillance of noncooperative satellites) system.
The big advantages of the bistatic radar concept come from its immunity to 
countermeasures.
In conflicts that involve the intrusion of hostile aircraft, surveillance and track-
ing monostatic radars will be attacked with a wide range of countermeasures such 
as barrage and deception jamming, chaff, ARMs, and stealth (i.e., reduced RCS) 
aircraft.
The Tx is, of course, still vulnerable to direct physical attack, but a bistatic 
receiver can operate with target illumination by any of several Txs of opportunity 
and it is immune to ARMs. 
In fact, when operating with dedicated Txs, the bistatic receivers are not vul-
nerable to jamming signals that are not incident upon them but directed toward 
their Txs. The use of adaptive nulling of the antenna pattern further reduces the 
incident jamming. Also, dedicated Txs may use a higher PRF than the usual surveil-
lance radar, thus allowing Doppler processing to achieve discrimination of targets 
concealed within chaff clouds and corridors. 
Bistatic and multistatic radars achieve good detection performance against 
stealth A/C because they can be deployed to benefit from the energy reflected away 
from its cone of silence. Also active stealth is ineffective because the correct nulling 
signal cannot be achieved at an unknown receiver location. 
The location of the target in bistatic radars is determined by the signal delay 
measurement along the Tx-target-Rx path RT + RR with respect to the signal TOA 
along the path Tx-Rx L and the Rx antenna bearing and elevation, respectively, 
relative to the baseline to the Tx and to the vertical axis.
The 3-D locus of the time delay is a prolate spheroid (with a horizontal cut 
that is an ellipse) with Tx and Rx as foci (Figure 2.69). The equation of the ellipses 
of constant time delay (or isodelay contours) is evaluated by assuming L to be the 
length of the base and T  = (RT+ RR )/c to be the delay along the Tx-target-Rx, and 
is:

The angles θT and θR are, respectively, the look angles or line of sight (LOS) to 
the target, which are taken as positive when measured clockwise with respect to 
the x-axis (the baseline). The bistatic angle β = π – (θR+ θT) is the angle between the 
two LOS at the target. A useful relationship is that the bisector of the bistatic angle 
is orthogonal to the tangent of the ellipse at the target. The tangent is often a good 
approximation to an isodelay contour.
The equation for the free-space bistatic radar detection range is derived straight-
forwardly from the monostatic radar’s one:

The free-space bistatic radar’s benchmark range is a circle of radius RM just as 
in the monostatic case (i.e., when the base length L = 0). For the general bistatic 
case, where L > 0, the free-space maximum detection contour becomes the familiar 
oval of Cassini. This oval provides a useful view of bistatic range coverage and it 
can be of four types in accordance with the ratio of base length to benchmark range 
L/RM, as shown in Figure 2.70:
Benchmark [Figure 2.70(a)]: L = 0, monostatic case. Area = πR2M. 
One oval [Figure 2.70(b)]: L<2RM. Area = π (R2M– (L2/8 RM)2). Max (min) range 
= (R2M+L2/4)1/2±L/2.
Lemniscate [Figure 2.70(c)]: L = 2RM. Area = 3πL2/16. Max (min) range = (√2±1) 
L/2.
Two ovals [Figure 2.70(d)]: L>2RM. Area = πR2M(R2M/L2). Max range = R2M/L, 
on RX oval. For L>3 RM the ovals are approximated as circles with radius RRav 
= R2M/L.
Expressions for receiver (and transmitter) ranges on the opposite oval are read-
ily calculated through mirror-image symmetry.
Also note that the area of every bistatic oval is always less than the monos-
tatic circle. Further the volume within which a bistatic radar can have both LOS

from the Tx and Rx to the target is severely affected by the wave propagation 
over Earth’s curvature.  In the case of a monostatic radar, the maximum horizon

where all dimensions are in kilometers, Ht is the height of the target, HR is the

In the case of a bistatic area, the corresponding surface area for the same target 
at height Ht is provided by the overlap of two circles (as shown in Figure 2.71), one

tion of baseline length L and target height (assuming HT = HR) is reported in [19].
2.3.11.1  Bistatic Radar Applications
The ovals of Cassini can be used to define three operating regions for bistatic radar: 
co-site (L < 2RM), Rx centered, and Tx centered (respectively, in one of the two 
ovals for L > 3RM). 
By adding to the above classification the type of transmitter (dedicated, coop-
erative, and noncooperative), we arrive at Table 2.9.
A number of problems are encountered by radar hitchhiker operation (i.e., 
with the cooperative Tx of a monostatic radar) such as beam-on beam scan and the 
synchronization aspects. Indeed the hitchhiker receiver has to be able to reproduce 
the timings and frequencies of the Tx waveforms before it can measure accurately 
the time delays and Doppler shifts of target echoes. This is done by re-creating as

a reference the Tx signal frequency and its modulations at the Rx site. Obtaining 
re-created frequency accuracy and stability of the reference signal for Doppler co-
herent processing requires frequency synthesizers locked to the rubidium atomic 
standard (stable to one part in 1011 per month). The block diagram of a typical 
hitchhiker radar is shown in Figure 2.72.

2.3  Radar Principles and Types

In beam scan-on-scan, when high-gain, narrow-beam scanning antennas are 
used by both Tx and Rx sites, inefficient use is made of the radar energy because 
only the volume common to both beams can be observed by the receiver at any 
given time (see Figure 2.73). The remedies to mitigate this problem are as follows:
1.	 Step scanning. This consists of fixing the Rx beam and waiting for the Tx 
beam to scan through the surveillance sector. The Rx beam is then stepped 
one adjacent beam for the next Tx beam scan and so on, until the Rx beam 
has stepped across the full surveillance sector. This remedy increases the 
surveillance frame time and is usually not acceptable for large-area sur-
veillance. The remedy can be applied in situations when the base length is 
small and the Tx and Rx form a pseudo-monostatic geometry, as is the case 
for BRWL. 
2.	 Floodlight beams. A floodlight beam can be used with either the Tx or 
Rx. The floodlight transmitter remedy obviously requires a dedicated Tx 
antenna to flood the surveillance sector continuously, while the Rx scans 
the sector with a high-gain antenna. This remedy achieves fair surveillance 
time frames. The floodlight receiver remedy can be used by a hitchhiker to 
flood a sector scanned by a high-gain Tx beam and to achieve as well as 
above a fair surveillance time frame.
3.	 Multiple beams. A bistatic receiver can use multiple simultaneous fixed Rx 
beams to cover the surveillance sector, which again restores the surveillance 
time frame. If the beams of the antennas all have the same gain, range per-
formance is also restored. This remedy increases the cost and complexity 
Figure 2.73  Volume common to both the Tx and Rx beams, which can be observed by the receiver 
at any given time.

112

of the receiver since a beamforming network and one signal processor per 
beam are required. The multibeam Rx can be used with any type of trans-
mitter, including the floodlight Tx, where the reduced Tx gain can be com-
pensated to increase the detection range by an increase of the dwell time on 
target from the multibeam Rx antenna. 
2.3.11.2  Noncooperative Air Surveillance 
Most passive bistatic radar (PBR) developments exploit broadcast transmitters as 
their source for radar illumination. Frequency modulation (FM) and high-definition 
television (HD-TV) terrestrial broadcast transmitters are the most attractive due to 
their high-power, noise-like, and relatively wide bandwidth signals for supporting 
air surveillance, otherwise assigned to VHF/UHF monostatic radars. 
The 1985 trials of the Crystal Palace TV transmitter have dictated the require-
ments for the type of signal modulation to be used by subsequent broadcast trans-
mitters: Doppler exploitation of stable, narrowband carrier lines in TV transmis-
sion and range/Doppler exploitation of the wider band, noise-like spectrum of FM 
transmission
The surveillance is covert, because even the transmitter is unaware it is being 
exploited, and provides counterstealth capabilities due to unavoidable A/C reso-
nances in the VHF/UHF region. In this case the PBR has no control over their trans-
mission and waveform properties, such as effective radiated power, transmission 
schedule, modulation type and content, and so forth.
The PBR’s receiver provides target detection through a cross-correlation of the 
returned echo signal with a segment of the direct signal coming from the Tx. The 
cross-correlation is performed over the range of expected target echo time delays 
and Doppler shifts. Because the modulation content of many broadcast transmit-
ters changes as a function of time, this complicates the matched filtering by the 
PBR’s receiver. Indeed, a related modulation content inconvenience is provided by 
dead air, where no information is broadcast and the broadcast transmitter modu-
lation is missing, thus increasing range measurement errors without limit. Dead 
air is a pause in modulation that can occur quite frequently (on the order of 1 Hz) 
when broadcasting a talk show or classical music. Consequently, once a track has 
been established, a nonlinear tracking filter may be needed to remove large error 
spikes. Further, especially in urban and suburban areas, the PBR can be affected by 
interference from the host emitter and other emitters, which can seriously degrade 
PBR performance.
In situ measurements of VHF and UHF bands in dense urban environments 
have shown an increase of up to 45 dB over the thermal noise. Normally it is about 
25 dB (after spectral cancellation). The noise figures of the receivers are significant-
ly higher than those obtained by the monostatic VHF/UHF radars and constitute a 
detection penalty for exploiting broadcast transmitters of opportunity.
The interference from the exploited Tx is called direct-path breakthrough and 
becomes particularly severe when the receiver is located in direct LOS of the trans-
mitter, which must occur when surveillance of low-altitude air targets is required. 
If this direct path signal is not sufficiently attenuated, the received target signal 
becomes masked in range and often also in Doppler. 

2.4  Communications 
113
Direct-path breakthrough effects are similar to those of a spot noise jammer 
and can be characterized by an increase in the system noise temperature Ts = F T0, 
where F is the receiver noise figure and T0  = 290°K is the standard temperature. 
To avoid the increase of Ts, it is necessary to provide an adequate decoupling (or 
attenuation) to the direct path signal. Typical required decoupling is on the order 
of 90 to 100 dB. This amount can be achieved by a combination of Earth masking, 
antenna shielding, and spatial and spectral cancellation. A brute-force remedy is to 
physically block the Tx signal from the receiver with a shroud or structure. Not-
withstanding these masking and shielding techniques, spatial and spectral filtering 
always have to be added. 
A typical modern air surveillance PBR is the CORA (COvert RAdar) developed 
by the Fraunhofer Institute (formerly FGAN), which operates with DAB and DVB-
T transmitters of opportunity.
2.4  Communications
RF communications enable the exchange of information between two distant enti-
ties. As such, they play a vital part in the military field, which is based on real-time 
information reception at the headquarters from the battle area and distribution 
of commands from the latter to the deployed troops/assets in the battle area. This 
section provides an introduction to modern available communications technologies 
and techniques only to the depth necessary to understand the requirements for the 
EW equipment described in the following chapters that is relevant to the intercep-
tion, classification, and jamming of hostile signals and receivers.
Military communication systems are either broadcast or netted. In broadcast 
communications information is generated at a single place (source node) and sent to 
many receivers (sink nodes). In netted communications, information is exchanged 
among the nodes of the net: Each node may act as a source or a sink (see Figure 
2.74).
In tactical mobile networks there is often one node in the network that is re-
ferred to as the net control station (NCS). Usually this node is associated with the 
person responsible for the network and, hence, there is often more communication 
Figure 2.74  (a) Broadcast and (b) netted communication.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
traffic from this node with respect to the other nodes. This is a feature that can be 
exploited by communication intercept equipment to identify the NCS.
The information is transported between radio equipment by modulating (i.e., 
modifying) a carrier signal. Modulation methods are of two types: analog and digi-
tal. The objective of the various available modulation techniques is to achieve spec-
trum efficiency; that is, to achieve a large amount of information within a given 
amount of bandwidth so as to make available the maximum number of channels 
within the bandwidth assigned to a service.
Three fundamental analog techniques are used to modulate a carrier signal, 
each of which is applicable to one of the basic parameters of a sinusoidal signal:

•• Amplitude A(t)         (amplitude modulation, AM)
•• Frequency fc           (frequency modulation, FM)
•• Instantaneous phase Φ(t)  (phase modulation, PM) 
Because both frequency and phase are the argument of the cosine, the relevant 
modulations are also referred as angle modulations. The signal that is modified 
by modulation is called the carrier signal, whereas the information-bearing signal, 
which performs the modification, is called the modulating signal and is denoted by 
m(t).
The analog AM and FM communication techniques are not very spectrum ef-
ficient; the PM techniques, especially in digital form, are more spectrum efficient 
and are therefore used in modern communication systems.
Digital modulation techniques are rapidly replacing, both in the military and 
civilian domains, the older analog communications. Digital techniques are more 
spectrum efficient and hence the precious VHF/UHF spectrum can be used to sup-
port more communication channels. Digital communications further satisfy the 
above requirement because they are operated at the higher frequency ranges of the 
spectrum and can meet two currently increasing demands.
Increased data volumes at higher data rates and larger occupation bandwidths.
The use of secure communications, which require modern encryption 
technologies.
Modern military communication systems employ digital modulations. Howev-
er, in asymmetric conflicts it is still possible to come across communication systems 
that employ traditional analog modulation methods and therefore it is beneficial to 
the scope of this book to provide some brief notes about them.
At the receiver site the modulated carrier signal has to be demodulated to re-
trieve the information content, usually expressed with symbols. The two types of 
demodulation are noncoherent (in which no carrier phasing is used) and coher-
ent (in which the carrier phase information is used). Coherent demodulation is 
more efficient than one noncoherent in recognizing the transmitted symbols of 
digital signalling, although at the expense of requiring more complex hardware 
implementations. 

2.4  Communications 
115
All demodulation techniques need to recover the symbol clock. The coherent 
PM demodulation techniques further need to know where the reference carrier 
phase is located in order to synchronize the receiver with the incoming signal.
Communications services are spread virtually all over the RF spectrum, the 
bands for which are shown in Table 2.10.
In the following subsections (and in Appendix D, in which the analog signal 
modulation techniques are described), the principal methods of digital signaling 
and coding will be tackled, followed by a discussion of secure communications 
systems entailing spread-spectrum and frequency-hopping techniques and a short 
description of the Military Information Distribution System (MIDS).
2.4.1  Access Methods
The use of a communication channel is ruled by the access methods of the commu-
nication systems. There are three principal access methods and each takes its name 
from one characteristic of the communication waveform:
1.	 Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), in which the available fre-
quency channels are divided among the users. Each user normally keeps 
the assigned channel until it needs to send messages and then it leaves it to 
a subsequent user. The FDMA scheme is shown in Figure 2.75(a).
2.	 Time-division multiple access (TDMA), in which the same channel is shared 
in time among many users. Switching among users happens so fast that the 
users do not perceive that the channel is shared. The TDMA scheme is 
shown in Figure 2.75(b). TDMA has a number of implementation schemes 
such as ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, CSMA, DAMA [20].
3.	 Code-division multiple access (CDMA),in which direct synthesis spread-
spectrum (DSSS) or frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) techniques 
are used to share among the users all of the frequencies of the commu-
nication system band. Each user is assigned a different spreading code.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
Examples of CDMA will be given when discussing the typical military 
communications system at the end of Section 2.4. 
2.4.2  Digital Signaling
In recent years digital signaling techniques have become the preferred signal modu-
lation communication techniques because they are more spectrum efficient than the 
analog ones. The analog signal containing the information to be transported by the 
communication system is sampled at some rate, and each sample is amplitude con-
verted in digital form by ADCs. The digital representation of the signal is called the 
pulse code or pulse word. Pulse code modulation (PCM) is obtained by modulating 
each pulse code onto the carrier. PCM can be accomplished in many forms, among 
which the most used ones are (1) differential PCM (DPCM) and (2) adaptive dif-
ferential PCM (ADPCM).
PCM assigns a number of digital bits to the amplitude of each digital sample 
of the analog signal. If the signal is not changing too rapidly from one sample 
to the next, there will be a redundancy of bits in the digitized amplitudes of the 
samples. To avoid such redundancy, DPCM encodes only the difference in ampli-
tude between the two samples. Frequently there is only 1 bit difference between the 
samples: +1 bit if the next sample amplitude is larger than the current one; –1 bit if 
the next sample amplitude is smaller.
In a case where the signal amplitude may experience abrupt changes from one 
sample to the next, ADPCM senses such a difference over a limited number of 
successive samples and reacts by providing a larger number of bits to compensate 
or exceed the signal amplitude until the amplitude difference between samples is 
restored (i.e., amplitude tracking is accomplished and usual DPCM applies).
The most used digital modulations are:
1.	 Amplitude shift key (ASK), in which the amplitude of the signal is changed 
between two (or more) levels [see Figure 2.76(a)].
Figure 2.75  Principles of (a) FDMA and (b) TDMA access methods.

2.4  Communications 
117
 2.	 Frequency shift key (FSK), in which the carrier signal is changed between 
two (or more) frequencies [see Figure 2.76(b)].
 3.	 Phase shift key (PSK), where a number of methods are used:
•	 Binary PSK (BPSK), which uses two phase states (0 and π radians) 
corresponding to symbols 1 and –1 (or 0). The implementation of the 
modulation is as simple as multiplying the carrier by +1 (carrier phase 
unchanged) and –1 (which is the same as shifting the phase by π radians) 
[see Figure 2.76(c)].
•	 Quadrature PSK (QPSK), in which two data bits are combined to form 
a single symbol, as shown in the relevant constellation of four states [see 
Figure 2.76(d)].
•	 Offset QPSK (OQPSK), which also uses a four states constellation but 
they are offset by π/4 radians with respect to QPSK.
Note from the Figures 2.76(c) and )d) that there are amplitude variations in 
the BPSK and QPSK modulations where there are phase discontinuities, with maxi-
mum amplitude variations at phase shifts of π radians. This feature is not appro-
priate in implementations where the amplifiers are operating in saturation (such 
as in satellite and cellular phone communications) because the input amplitude 
variations produce intermodulated signals. The inconvenience has been rectified 
Figure 2.76  (a) ASK digital amplitude modulation. (b) FSK digital frequency modulation. (c) BPSK 
digital phase modulation. (d) QPSK digital phase modulation.

by using the π/4 OQPSK where only π/4 and 3π/4 phase transitions are allowed, 
preventing the signal states on the I-axis, where the amplitude crosses the zero.
Upon each symbol transition the constellation shifts counterclockwise by π/4 
radians (which gives the prefix “offset” to this modulation). So the symbol which 
at clock period iTc is at π/4 radians, and might correspond to data bit 00, at clock 
period (i+1)Tc, is at π/2 radians which still correspond to data bit 00. OQPSK 
modulation is used in some second-generation cellular phone systems such as the 
European Tetra.
A FSK modulation, called minimum shift key (MSK), is implemented with a 
frequency shift (f2 – f1) = 1/2Tc (i.e., one-half of the modulating signal bit rate), 
which is the smallest shift that can maintain phase continuity. The MSK technique, 
with the application of a filter with a Gaussian transfer function of the type H(F) 
= exp(–μf2) to the modulating signal (therefore the technique is called GMSK), is 
applied in the European second-generation cellular phone systems called Global 
System Mobile (GSM).
Further PSK techniques, the so-called 2nPSK, combine n bits to form higher 
types of constellations for transmission. Current available techniques can be imple-
mented up to n = 8.
One modulation technique that permits transmission of n bits per symbol is 
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) . This technique modulates both I and Q 
amplitudes in addition to the phase modulation. The I and Q values are transmit-
ted as two simultaneous data streamed using the quadrature modulation scheme

shown in the previous paragraph. In Figure 2.77 the constellation for QAM with 
3 bits is shown (23 = 8 symbols). QAM modulations are more bandwidth efficient 
(i.e., they have higher data rates per unit bandwidth) and are used extensively for 
terrestrial radio links. However, because QAM techniques use more amplitude lev-
els, they require linear amplifications on transmission, which are not suitable for 
satellite communications. 
One high-speed (several megabits per second) modulation technique used for 
mitigating the typical negative effects experienced by mobile communication chan-
nels, such as multipath, interference, and impulsive noise, is orthogonal frequency-
division multiplexing (OFDM), also called discrete multitone (DMT). In this FDM 
technique the adjacent channels are orthogonal to each other, but the overlapping 
sidebands on the adjacent channels do not affect the effective signaling of each 
channel. Thus, although each channel may carry a relatively low bit rate, the bunch 
of channels together may achieve a high bit rate.
As for any communication, signaling noise, either externally or internally in-
duced, can cause a received symbol to be in error. The bit error rate (BER) of 
digital signaling is a function of the postdetection or demodulated SNR. The SNR 
required of most common digital modulations to achieve a BER of <10–2 ranges 
from 8 dB (for BPSK) to 12 dB (for FSK) [20].
2.4.3  Secure Communications
Secure communications must resist unintentional and intentional (jamming) in-
terference, detection by an adversary, and unauthorized extraction of information 
from a transmitted waveform. Spread-spectrum techniques are used to provide 
these secure communications requirements. 
There are two fundamental spread-spectrum techniques: frequency hopping 
(FH) and direct sequence (DS). In the former, the transmitted carrier frequency of 
the signal is changed periodically, or “hopped,” at a high rate, and covertness is 
achieved because only the associated receiver knows to which frequency the signal 
Figure 2.77  8QAM constellation.

has hopped. In the latter the energy in a relatively narrowband information signal 
is spread over a much larger bandwidth, so that in any narrowband portion of the 
spectrum occupied by the signal there is very little energy (frequently below the 
level of thermal noise present) in order to make the signal undetectable. Again, 
only the receiver knows the despreading key required to recover the narrowband 
information signal.
The principles and applied means of spread-spectrum (SS) techniques are used 
also in modern LPI radars and are discussed in the relevant previous sections, so 
that discussion is not repeated here. In the following sections, examples of SS com-
munication systems are discussed. Namely, an example of a DSSS communication 
system (the Global Navigation Satellite System) is illustrated in Section 2.5 and an 
example of a FHSS communication system (the Joint Tactical Information System) 
is illustrated in Section 2.4.6.
2.4.4  Coding of Communication Signals
Coding is implemented either to remove redundancy in the source information (e.g., 
speech or images), in which case the coding is referred to as a data compression 
technique, or to improve the reliability of the communication (i.e., the probability 
that the correct message is received), in which case the coding is referred to as an 
error control technique. 
Data compression techniques are used to reduce the content of any informa-
tion to the minimum total number of bits to be transmitted. For example, in text 
or speech applications, the Huffman encoding technique is used in the allocation 
of the number of bits to represent a symbol because it assigns fewer bits to the 
symbols that are more frequently used. Further, phrases that are often repeated are 
addressed using pointers to previously sent phrases. These techniques are called 
lossless because no information in the transmitted message is lost. They can typi-
cally achieve a compression ratio on the order 10:1 [20].
Higher compression ratios are achieved in image transmission and storage tech-
niques, which are widely used in both civilian and military domains. Redundancy 
in video signals comes both from the spatial redundancy within a single image as 
well as from the temporal redundancy from one image to the next. 
Spatial redundancy in still pictures is addressed by the Joint Pictures Expert 
Group (JPEG) standard, which applies both the discrete cosine transform (DCT) 
method to transform a segment of 64 pixels of the picture (each pixel should be 
normally represented by a 10-bit word) and Huffman encoding to all the various 
segments to reduce the number of bits to represent the picture. The result is ex-
tremely efficient coding (called intraframe coding) of single images.
Temporal redundancy from one picture to the next comes from the fact that, at 
the speed of motion pictures, the objects in the image do not move much. Tempo-
ral redundancy is addressed by interframe coding such as the standards developed 
by the Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) and called MPEG1,MPEG2, and 
MPEG4. More details on this subject can be found in [20]. 
The data rates of image transmission codes (except for the MPEG4 standard) 
require larger bandwidths (usually available at quite high carrier frequencies) than 
those used by military tactical radios in the battle area. Higher frequency equip-

ment, however, is available at division and above levels, which make use of image 
communications.
2.4.4.1  Channel Coding
Channel coding is normally performed in communication and data storage systems 
for error control, because no electronic system is immune from noise generated 
either externally or internally to the system and noise bit errors inevitably occur. 
Some types of communications, such as digital speech, can tolerate a large number 
of bit errors before the speech message becomes unintelligible; other types, however, 
such as computer-to-computer exchanges, must be performed almost error free. In 
some cases it is sufficient to detect errors in order to discard the data containing 
the bit error and to request the data to be resent; in other cases, the data must be 
encoded so that, up to a certain extent, it is possible to correct them at the receiver. 
Error detection methods are discussed next.
Parity Bit Addition 
One bit is added to the data word so that the number of 1’s in a word is even (or 
odd). A parity check at the receiver immediately checks if one data word contains 
a bit error. The bit addition can also be applied when the data words are organized 
into a matrix, in which each element is constituted by a single bit of a word. In this 
case the parity bit is added to each row and to each column of the matrix, so that 
if a single error occurs, the bit in error is not only immediately detected (because a 
row and column in error identify a single bit at their crossing) but also corrected.
Cyclic Redundancy Check 
The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) coding technique for error detection is widely 
used for automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes, because it is easy to implement 
in hardware (and in fact there are integrated circuits available that compute the 
CRC). It is based on the notion that binary data streams can be treated as binary 
polynomials where the ordered bits ci of the data word are the coefficients of the 
polynomial d(x), which is called a frame:
	
0
( )
n
i
i
d x
c x
= ∑
	
To each frame d(x), a frame check sequence (FCS) is added on transmission. 
The FCS is constituted by the product of the remainder polynomial r(x) obtained 
from the division of the frame polynomial d(x) with a particularly selected poly-
nomial g(x):

On reception T(x) is divided by g(x) and if there are no errors in the transmis-
sion, then the remainder of this division is zero. 
This code effectively detects bit errors and it has been estimated that when us-
ing a 17-bit polynomial the probability of 1 bit error undetected is 10–14 [20].
Checksum
With the checksum method, the set of data words (each word corresponds to a 
value <2n, where n is the number of bits in the word) is summed together, without 
worrying about overflow, thus obtaining the checksum (modulus 2n). The checksum 
is attached to the data, becoming part of the data set. When the set of transmitted 
data is summed on reception, the result is zero (modulus 2n) unless there is an error.
This method provides a good probability of error detection. In fact, it has been 
evaluated that when summing a set of data words of 16 bits the probability that 
the checksum is not declaring an error in the presence of an inaccurate data set is 
(1/64) × 10–3 ≤ 2–16.
Error correction is performed by two techniques: ARQ and forward error cor-
rection (FEC). The ARQ method, as seen previously for the CRC error detection 
method, adds extra bits to the transmitted data stream so that the check at the 
receiver can detect an error in the data stream. If that happens, a request to resend 
the data (NACK = not acknowledged) is made. This method of error correction is 
very ineffective for cases of low SNR in the received data; once a NACK response 
is sent, the probability of receiving a further data stream with an error is high and 
thus the channel can quickly get clogged resending messages received in error.
FEC methods add some bits to each digital word prior to conversion into the 
transmitted symbols in order to correct errors at the receiver. The bit addition 
reduces the bandwidth efficiency, so to send at the desired data rate, an increased 
bandwidth is required. This in turn implies that the noise power density is in-
creased and the SNR lowered, thus increasing the BER. The goal of FEC design, 
therefore, is to reach an optimum trade-off between the number of bits to be added 
versus the bandwidth required to transmit the code words.
There are three major types of FEC:
1.	 Block codes, which encode large blocks of data at a time; the encoding 
depends only on the current block of data.
2.	 Convolutional codes, which encode a block of data, but the encoding de-
pends not only on the current block of data but also on prior blocks of 
data.
3.	 Cyclic codes, where all code words are permutations of one original code 
word. Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and Reed-Solomon 
codes are examples of them.
A discussion about the performance of the preceding codes is beyond the scope 
of this book. We recommend the interested reader refer to [20, 21] for deeper in-
sight into the matter.
The advantages of coding in terms of BER vs. SNR for several coding methods 
are described in [20], in which it is reported that very good performance is possible 
for low SNRs over uncoded data streams.

2.4.5  Typical Military Communication Systems
Military communication systems operate in allocated bands and are of three types 
[22]:
1.	 Combat net radios, which provide short- and medium-range voice (digit-
ally modulated) communication and operate in the VHF band (28 to 88 
MHz);
2.	 Tactical data links, which are used to transfer data within a C2 system from 
one node to another. They operate in two different bands, either UHF (225 
to 400 MHz) or D-band (formerly the radar L-band, 960 to 1215 MHz 
(with some holes);
3.	 Satellite communications, which provide very-long-range data exchange 
between users.
These systems operate in different bands, such as UHF(225 to 400 MHz), SHF 
(7 to 8 GHz), and EHF (20 to 44 GHz), with different frequencies relevant to up-
links and downlinks.
Most combat net radios (CNRs) employ the FH technique, which can be of 
two types: slow FH (SFH) and fast FH (FFH), in accordance with the number of 
bits transmitted per frequency hop. The SFH technique is characterized by one or 
more bits transmitted within the same frequency hop, whereas the FFH technique is 
characterized by one or more frequency hops per transmitted bit. Both techniques 
cover the entire allocated bandwidth with a number of channels of bandwidth Bch, 
which is 25 kHz in the VHF band and 50 kHz in the UHF band.
FH systems use a set of stable frequency synthesizers or direct digital synthesiz-
ers (DDSs) in both transmitting and receiving stations. The sequence of transmitted 
frequencies is generated on the basis of a PN code, which is known to both users. 
Demodulation of the transmitted message is accomplished after the receiver has 
accomplished the acquisition and synchronization phases of the transmitted code. 
Current CNR systems such as SINCGARS-V, Jaguar-V, and its successor Panther-
2000-V operate in SFH mode with hopping rates ranging from 100 to >1,000 
hop/s.
The principal tactical data link (TDL) in the NATO Alliance is the Military 
Information Distribution System, also known as Joint Tactical IDS (JTIDS) in the 
United States or Link 16. This system was developed at the end of 1980s to pro-
vide an interoperable, secure, digital communication system among the whole al-
lied military network. MIDS operates in the 960- to 1215-MHz bandwidth, with 
some bandwidth holes allocated to other services (e.g., IFF and GPS). The available 
number of hopping frequencies within this bandwidth is 51 with a spacing of 3 
MHz between them. The hopping frequencies are selected in accordance with a PN 
code with the rule that two adjacent transmissions must be separated by at least 
30 MHz.
The TDL operates using the TDMA method, so that each user is assigned one 
or more adjacent timeslots to transmit its message to the network. The TDMA tim-
ing is periodic. Each period is called an epoch and has a duration of 12.8 minutes 
The epoch is composed of 64 frames, each with a duration of 12 sec. The frame is 
in turn composed of 1536 timeslots, each with a duration of 7.8125 ms. Thus the 
number of timeslots within an epoch is 98,304.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
Each time slot is composed of:
•• A jitter, which is a variable dead time used to make interception more difficult.
•• A synchronization preamble followed by an identification band in which the 
receiver determines whether it is interested in the content of the message. The 
duration of the synchronization preamble is 0.936 ms.
•• A message, which is spread over 109 information packets. Each packet 
is composed of 5 bits, which are mapped on 32 chips in accordance with 
2-CPFSK digital modulation (thus applying internally to the message the DSS 
method), each having a duration of 200 ns, for a total duration of 6.4 μs. 
After each transmitted packet a dead time of 6.6 μs is applied. Thus, each 
message has a duration of 13 μs and the instantaneous bandwidth occupied 
by the message is 10 MHz. The total time of transmission is 109 × 13 = 1.417 
ms.
•• A propagation guard-time (on the order of 2 or 4 ms in accordance with 
the selected normal (300-nautical-mile [nm]) or extended (700-nm) network 
range. 
A representation of the MIDS timing is shown in Figure 2.78.
Figure 2.78  Representation of the MIDS timing.

2.5  Satellite Navigation Systems

Potentially, by employing the total guard-time to transmit on another “stacked 
net,” the MIDS could operate at a frequency hop rate of 109 × 1/(1.417 × 10–3) ≈ 
77,000 hop/s. In Figure 2.79 the actual hop rates are reported. Military satellite 
communications (SATCOM) operate in various bands: UHF (250 to 400 MHz), 
SHF (7 to 8 GHz), and EHF (20 to 44 GHz). In the past SATCOM required the use 
of a constellation of communication satellites, but currently the use of commercial 
low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites is prevailing with special slots or services dedi-
cated to the military (e.g., the use of INMARSAT commercial satellites for voice 
traffic).
The recent military satellite system MILSTAR makes use of geostationary-
Earth-orbiting (GEO) satellites provided with uplinks at EHF (44 GHz) and UHF 
(300 MHz) and downlinks, respectively, at SHF (20 GHz) and UHF (250 MHz).
Cross-links between satellites are provided at 60 GHz. These satellites practically 
operate in the LPI mode because of their narrow beamwidth at EHF and the use of 
FFH SS techniques.
2.5  Satellite Navigation Systems
Navigation refers to being able to determine the position and velocity of a moving 
platform or body with respect to a known reference. In this section, after briefly 
recalling the principles of operation of some radionavigation systems of interest in 
the military domain, we will focus on satellite navigation systems, which with their 
very accurate 3-D position measurements have become a powerful guidance system 
for unmanned weapons systems and munitions.
There are five basic radionavigation techniques:
1.	 Marker beacons: the reception of a beacon’s signal indicates that the plat-
form is in the vicinity of the transmitter.
2.	 Bearing and elevation technique, such as VOR (VHF omnidirectional radio 
range) or ILS (instrumented landing system), in which the reference sta-
tion broadcasts a signal that varies with the direction of transmission, thus 
enabling the receiving platform to obtain a measurement of bearing and el-
evation to the reference station without the need for a directional antenna. 
3.	 Passive ranging, or TOA system, such as the various GNSS (global naviga-
tion satellite systems), in which the reference station broadcasts a timing 
signal from which the platform can deduce its range from the transmitter. 
This requires that both transmitter and receiver clocks be synchronized.
4.	 Two-way ranging systems, such as DME (distance measuring equipment) 
in which the platform transmits a call to the reference station, which then 
transmits its signal back at a predetermined interval. This avoids the need 
for clock synchronization but introduces, limitations to the number of us-
ers and repetition rate.
5.	 Hyperbolic ranging system, such as LORAN (long-range navigation), in 
which the platform receiver measures the time difference (TD) between 
the received signals from two reference stations, removing the need to syn-
chronize the receiver clock. The locus of platform position from the TD 
measurement is a hyperbola.

GNSS is the collective term for those navigation systems that provide the user 
with a 3-D positioning solution by passive ranging via radio signals transmitted 
by orbiting satellites. A number of those systems are currently available, but only 
three of them provide complete Earth coverage: GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo. The 
most well-known of them is the Navigation by Satellite Timing and Ranging (NAV-
STAR) GPS, owned and operated by the U.S. government.
A description of the architecture, services, and determination of the user posi-
tion and velocity from ranging measurements is beyond the objective of this book; 
we recommend interested reader refer to the book by P. Groves [23] for deeper 
insight in the subject. Here we are interested only in the structure of the GNSS 
signals, because they constitute a good example of a modern spread-spectrum 
communication system. Spread-spectrum modulations are used to obtain accurate 
range measurements (on the order of 2 to 6m rms) at receivers near the ground 
from weak received signals (as they are transmitted from satellites at a couple of 
tens of thousands of kilometers); thus, they are prone to severe interference. 
GNSS signals are broadcast in a number of frequency bands within 1.1 to 1.6 
GHz and are usually transmitted with quadrature modulation (see Appendix D). 
Right-handed circular polarization (RHCP) has been used for all GNSS signals. 
GNSS signals combine a carrier with a navigation data message D(t) and a spread-
ing or ranging code C(t), both using BPSK modulation. The overall transmitted 
signal is expressed as:

where P = signal power; fc  = carrier frequency, φc = phase offset, and both C and D 
have an amplitude of ±1, varying with time. 
The data message rate fd typically varies between 50 and 500 chip/s (the dura-
tion of the message bit is Td = 1fd), while the spreading code rate ν varies between 
0.511 and 10.23 Mchip/s (and its duration is Tc = 1/ν). The energy per bit is thus 
E = PTd.
The spread-spectrum communication scheme is represented in Figure 2.79 
where j(t) represents an interfering signal (unintentional or intentional, i.e., a 
jammer).
The spreading code C(t) consists of a PRN sequence, which is known to the 
receiver. The effect of the spreading code is to increase the double-sided bandwidth 
of the navigation message to twice the spreading code chipping rate, while propor-
tionately decreasing the power spectral density. The representations of the involved

signals D(t), C(t), and x(t) are shown in Figure 2.80, where it is assumed that the 
interference is at the same carrier frequency of the signal.

is multiplied first by a replica of the signal from the transmitter oscillator (cos(2πfct+

The first term is just the correlation of the spreading signal and, as the two 
PRN generators are synchronized C2(t) = 1 for all t, it is the message signal mul-
tiplied by a constant, while the second term is the interference signal j(t) spread 
over the much larger bandwidth of the spreading signal. Thus, its energy in the

message bandwidth Bd = 1/Td is quite low (if Pj is the power of the interference 
in a bandwidth Bj, then at the output of the receiver it is Pj/ν). The changes in the 
signal spectra along the complete modulation and demodulation process are shown 
in Figure 2.81.
If the signal and receiver-generated spreading codes are different, the correla-
tion between them is much lower than if they are the same and aligned. Therefore, 
a number of different signals with different spreading codes may be broadcast si-
multaneously on the same carrier frequency, thus exploiting the channel CDMA 
technique.
The receiver selects the PRN spreading code relevant to the desired satellite 
signal. If the phase of the receiver-generated PRN code is not aligned with the 
transmitted signal, the receiver adjusts the phase so that all phases of its generated 
PRN code are searched until the correlation peak is found. This process is called 
acquisition of the transmitted signal. Once acquisition is complete, the receiver can 
operate at a lower SNR than acquisition because it is possible to vary the receiver-
generated code phase slightly to reacquire the correlation peak. This process is 
called tracking of the transmitted signal. Also the carrier component of the GNSS 
signal is tracked to enhance the two processes of acquisition and tracking of the 
PRN code.
Many of the newer GNSS signals use FEC techniques for the data message 
D(t). This introduces redundancy into the data and, although a higher symbol rate 
must be used to keep the message transmission unchanged for the duration, the 
data message can be successfully decoded in a poorer SNR environment.
Most newer GNSS signals use binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation instead 
of BPSK. This adds an extra component to the signal, the subcarrier G(t), a square-
wave signal at frequency fg, which spreads the signal into two sub-bands, centered 
at fc ± fg. The expression of the signal is:

BOC modulations can be used to minimize interference with BPSK signals 
sharing the same carrier frequency.
To separate the mainlobes of these sidebands, fg must be at least equal to the 
spreading code chipping rate; that is, fg ≥ ν. Usually the selection is fg = 2ν. BOC 
modulations can be of two types: sine phased, in which case the subcarrier transi-
tions are in phase with the spreading code transitions, or cosine phased, in which

case the subcarrier transitions are a quarter of the subcarrier period out of phase 
with the spreading code transitions. BOC modulations are denoted as BOCs(fg,ν) if 
sine phased or BOCc(fg,ν) if cosine phased subcarrier functions, where fg and ν are 
usually multiples of 1.023 MHz. Representations of BOCs(fg,ν) and BOCc(fg,ν) are 
shown in Figure 2.82.
2.6  Electro-Optical Thermal Imagers
EO thermal imagers are passive systems operating at wavelengths of 3 to 5 μm and 
8 to 12 μm that exploit the temperature variation or gradient of the object scene to 
produce TV-like images at night as well as during the day. For this reason they are 
also called night vision devices.
The two types of EO thermal imagers are the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) 
systems and the infrared search and track (IRST) systems. FLIR (or EO imagers) 
are used for surveillance and target detection and classification in the presence 
of ground reflections. IRSTs are employed mainly in ground-to-air or air-to-air

operations to detect “hot spots” in large volume searches with high angular ac-
curacy and subsequent tracking in angle (either in lock-on or TWS mode) of desig-
nated targets such as airborne and spaceborne targets against sky backgrounds. IR 
missile and IR munition seekers can be considered special types of IRSTs.
The basic FLIR and night vision systems are composed of the following major 
parts, as shown in Figure 2.83: optical lens, scanners/detectors, signal processing, 
and display. Electromagnetic radiation from the source is collected by the optical 
lens and conveyed to the detector, where it is converted into an electrical signal. 
The conversion performed in the detector can be either by change of the resistivity 
(photoconductive detector) or by generation of an electric current (photovoltaic 
detector). The electrical signal is then processed to enhance the SNR and to define 
the target position within a reference frame.
The detector part can be constituted by a single detector, a linear array, or a 
2-D array of detectors. With a single detector the object space has to be scanned 
by a couple of scanners, one rotating horizontally and the other rotating vertically. 
They scan the scene in two dimensions and reproduce sequentially the image of the 
object plane on the display. Typical scanning modes are raster or rosette as shown 
in Figure 2.84.
With a linear array of detectors the object space can be scanned in pushbroom 
or circular fashion.
For a 2-D detector array, more resolution cells are mapped in parallel into a 
mosaic of detectors, called a focal plane array (FPA),which is used to stare at the 
entire scene. Staring FPAs are used in surveillance and tracking applications that 
require higher resolution, such as air-to-ground or air-to-air combat.
The IR system detection performance (and relevant SNR) is evaluated through 
the following equation, in which—momentarily and for simplicity—the atmo-
spheric and equipment losses are neglected and will be reintroduced later.
Let Jt (W/sterad) be the radiation intensity of a point source at distance R from 
the optical lens of the IR system. The irradiance Ht (W/cm2) at the entrance aper-
ture of the optics is:

The detectivity is one of the primary parameters that characterizes the detector 
material. It is defined as the reciprocal of the noise equivalent power (NEP) of the 
detector, where NEP is the incident power at the detector that produce a SNRrms = 
1 at the detector output for a specified frequency bandwidth.
For a given material, the detectivity varies with the temperature of the focal 
plane (generally increasing at lower temperatures) and is selective as to the wave-
length bandwidth at which energy is detected. Detector detectivity is proportional 
to the square root of the detector area Ad and the square root of the bandwidth Δf 
of the filter in the detector output. To remove the dependence from the detector 
area and filter bandwidth and to derive a performance parameter that is dependent 
only on the properties of the detector material, the detector detectivity (also called 
the specific detector detectivity) D* is normalized with respect to Ad and Δf, both 
of which are assumed to have unit dimensions (1 cm2 and 1 Hz). Thus,

Table 2.11 lists the operating parameters of selected IR detectors.
The bandwidth of the signal Δf is approximately the inverse of the time dura-

equal to the frame time TF when the total solid angle coverage Ω (sterad) of the 
sensor is divided by the IFOV αd of each detector. Hence, Ω = nαd or, if a single 
detector of IFOV αd is used, τd = TF/n = TF αd/Ω. Therefore as Δf = 1/τd the SNR can 
be evaluated from (2.80) and (2.82) and becomes, for a single detector,

the various system losses that are dependent to the system (i.e., they are due to 
optics, electronics, detector, monitor, scanning, and bandwidth) and is called the 
modulation transfer function (MTF). Each of the above-mentioned causes provides 
a loss factor 0.5 < ki < 1 and therefore typically Ls =

The atmospheric attenuation La is quite severe in this part of the spectrum and 
strongly reduces the detection range. Typical attenuation losses vs. range in the 
8- to 12-μm bandwidth [2] are on the order, respectively, of 0.2 to 0.9 dB/km for 
clear weather conditions (visibility range > 4 km) and of 3 to 4 dB/km for foggy 
conditions (visibility range ≈ 1 km).
Equation (2.85) calculates the point target detection performance of an IRST 
relevant to “hot spots” against a clear background and is used to determine the 
minimum resolvable temperature (MRT) in the thermal imaging systems; that is, 
from the SNR value above and the detection curves reported in Appendix B, the 
two detection conditions—Pd (detection probability ) and Pfa (false alarm probabil-
ity)—can be evaluated once one of the two conditions has been selected.
The emissive signature of objects is ruled by Planck’s radiation law Wb(λ,T), 
which describes the energy radiated at all wavelengths by blackbody objects (ideal 
emitters with emissivity ε = 1) as a function of the temperature of the object:

For a given blackbody temperature, the wavelength, at which the maximum 
power is emitted is found by equating to zero the partial derivative of (2.86) with 
respect to the wavelength λ, which provides the Wein’s displacement law for the 
wavelength λM at which the maximum power density occurs:

The radiation intensity Jt of a target can be evaluated using Stefan-Boltzmann’s 
law, which states that the radiated power density W (W/cm2) from a unit surface is 
proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature T:

An important detection performance parameter of optical systems operating 
against a background is the noise equivalent temperature (NET), which is defined 
as the difference in temperature of the background that produces a variation of the 
background-to-noise ratio of unity, that is, Δ(C/N) = 1.
When reproducing the object scene on the display of the equipment, the local 
variation of C/N from the surrounding background is important to detect the pres-
ence of a warmer target.
The parameter NET can be obtained from the above considerations by using 
the data of Table 2.12 to evaluate the differential background spectral emittance 
ΔW(λ,T), which is, from (2.90):

The NET parameter is very useful in the design and evaluation of the perfor-
mance of IRST systems. For FLIR systems, which are reproducing an object scene, 
a better parameter for the evaluation of performance is the minimum resolvable 
temperature, which is discussed in the following section. 
A typical airborne IRST, the PIRATE, installed on board the European Ty-
phoon is shown in Figure 2.85(b).
2.6.1  Minimum Resolvable Temperature
If we want a target resolution distance Tx from an observation point at distance R 
we need an IFOV expressed in mrad (see Figure 2.86):

By inspection of Figure 2.86 the spatial frequency fs can be considered to be the

Since the NET of the target is calculated per the detector resolution cell  
d

This expression for MRT, which includes all system losses in the term Ls, is 
called the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the system (which also can be 
expressed as a function of the spatial frequency fs [2]). The MRT is an important 
parameter in the design and evaluation of the performance of FLIR systems. The 
MRT is, in fact, generally defined as the required threshold temperature difference 
between a square target and the background in order for an observer to perceive 
the target through the EO sensor.
The MRT, therefore, includes the effects of sharpness, contrast rendition, and 
SNR as a function of the spatial frequency fs.
Johnson [25] determined through experiments with observers the number of 
line pairs of pixels required by an observer to detect, determine symmetry and ori-
entation, recognize or classify, and identify tactical targets. These discrimination 
levels are reported in Tables 2.13 and 2.14. From these tables it can be observed 
that only one line pair across the minimum target dimension is required for detec-
tion, while for the target recognition, which is the most frequently used observa-
tion, up to four line pairs are required, as shown in Figure 2.87.

2.6.2  IR Missile Seekers
IR missile seekers are passive, and use heat energy emitted by the target in the IR 
spectrum to track the target. As already shown in the previous section when dis-
cussing Planck’s law for the blackbody spectral emittance, the hotter an object, the 
larger the energy it emits, and the lower the wavelength.
The hot engine parts of an A/C are typically at temperatures ranging from 
1300 to 2000 K with peak energy emission wavelengths ranging from 2 to 4 μm. 
First-generation IR missiles used uncooled lead-sulfide (PbS) detectors that have a 
peak detectivity at 2 μm. This type of missile is therefore limited to stern engage-
ments, since the missile seeker must track the hot turbine in the engine tailpipe of 
the target A/C.
More sensitive cooled detectors, based either on an indium-antimonide (InSb) 
material, which has a peak detectivity in the range of 3 to 5 μm, or on a mercury-
cadmium (HgCd) material, which has a peak detectivity in the range of 8 to 12 μm, 
were later introduced, which allowed for successive IR missiles to achieve all-aspect 
track capability of a target A/C (from engine exhaust to the warm skin of the A/C).
Along with the detector spectral diversity, the successive generations of IR seek-
ers are using a variety of techniques to find and track targets in the presence of flare 
countermeasures as shown in Table 2.15 for the four generations of IR seeker listed 
there.
Early seekers (first and second generation) used a spinning reticle of various 
shapes in front of the detector to reject the background radiation and encode the 
target position. In the successive generations the reticle is gradually being replaced 
by techniques that either sequentially scan the target with small IFOV detectors or 
stare at the target with a mosaic of detectors in a FPA configuration, which acts as 
an imager.
Further, bicolor discrimination techniques, using two sets of detectors, each re-
sponding in a different spectral band, allow through the ratio of the two responses 
at the seeker for discrimination between a decoy (flare) or a real target aircraft (see 
Figure 2.88). Table 2.16 lists the characteristics of some IR missiles.

2.6.2.1  Types of Seekers and Reticles
There are many types of reticles for seeker and in the following subsections only the 
principle of operation of five of them will be illustrated.
Seeker with Rotating Reticle
Figure 2.89 illustrates a seeker with a wagon wheel type rotating reticle. The spin-
ning reticle in front of the detector chops the detected long continuous signal into 
a series of pulses. Phase information in the chopped signal indicates the angular 
direction of the point target from the seeker axis, while its amplitude indicates the 
magnitude of the error 
A spinning reticle with only half the disk transparent (Figure 2.90) tends to 
produce a nearly steady signal on extended radiation sources such as clouds, while 
retaining the pulse signal from the target point source. The target signal can be 
extracted using a simple filter tuned to the reticle scan rate.
Seeker with Stationary Reticle and Rotating Lens
Another types of seeker is one with a stationary reticle and rotating lens displaced 
with respect to the seeker, as shown in Figure 2.91).
Conical Scan Seeker
Figure 2.92 shows a conical scan seeker. In this seeker, the reticle is fixed and a 
secondary mirror is tilted and spun. The target image produces a circular path 
around the outer edge of the reticle. If the target is centered in the seeker scan, the 
detector gives a constant frequency square wave. If the target is not centered, the 
circular path is somewhat offset and the detector gives a FM square wave, which 
has a depth of modulation that is directly proportional to the angular error from 
the center of the seeker. The error signal is demodulated to provide the input to the 
target-tracking servo.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The conical scan optics are usually designed to spin the target very close to 
the edge of the reticle. In this way the largest FM depth for a given angular er-
ror is provided and thus a more accurate tracking loop is achieved. Resistance to

flare is achieved because the flares tend to drop off the reticle much faster than the 
spin-scan period.
Rosette Scan Seeker 
This seeker belongs to the pseudo-imaging type that does not build an image but 
instead uses the spatial information from the scan to isolate the target from the 
background or the flare.
In this seeker the detector is fixed and aligned with the optics boresight axis, 
while the seeker FOV is scanned by a smaller IFOV that is rotated by means of a 
couple of prisms at two slightly different rotations speeds Ω1 and Ω2.The shape of 
the small IFOV path within the seeker FOV is similar to the petal of a flower, hence 
the name of this seeker, which is illustrated in Figure 2.93.
When the seeker boresight is aligned with the target, the position of the two 
rotating prisms at the detection time t0 indicates the two target angular errors θ and 
φ (azimuth and elevation), evaluated as follows:

This type of seeker is practically immune to jamming produced by AM IR 
lamps or lasers and further it allows for determination of the position of different 
targets within the FOV, thus discriminating, by means of kinematics filtering, the 
target from flare decoys.
Imaging Seekers
This type of seeker uses a FPA of detectors that stare at the scene and provide a TV-
like spatial map. Imaging seekers are inherently resistant to flares, because flares 
simply do not look like an extended aircraft with exhaust plume.
The most difficult aspect of imaging seekers is their image processing, because 
a typical FPA of 128 × 128 pixels with 10 bits each and a sampling rate of 100 Hz 
provides about 16 Mbit/s data throughput. 
2.6.2.2  IR Missile Detection Range
The IR missile seekers have the same behavior as an IRST relevant to detection per-
formance, in that the latter depends on several factors such as the target’s tempera-
ture, the atmosphere transmittance, the system optics, and the detector’s sensitivity. 
The main targets of the IR SAMs or AAMs are the exhaust nozzle and plume 
of the jet engine of the aircraft. Currently, IR seekers are also used in sea-skimming 
antiship missiles to support the microwave seeker in providing better tracking ac-
curacy and resistance to countermeasures. In this case the main target is the ship’s 
engine nozzle. The temperature of the A/C tailpipe is on the order of 1,000  to 
2,000 K, while the plume temperature can range from 700 to 1000 K. When the 
A/C’s afterburner is operational, the plume temperature can approach that of the 
hot tailpipe.
A secondary target is the aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin. The skin’s 
temperature depends on the aircraft speed according to the following expression:
	
T = T0(1 + 0.164M2)  (K)
where M equals the Mach number, which is the aircraft speed/sound propagation 
speed in the air, and T0 is the standard temperature, which is assumed to be 250 K. 
Typical supersonic A/C skin temperatures range from 250 K (M ≈ 1) to 500 K(M 
= 2.5).
Figure 2.93  Rosette scan seeker. (Adapted from [15].)

2.6  Electro-Optical Thermal Imagers

The temperature of the target establishes the wavelength of the emissions, 
which peaks in accordance with (2.86) in the 2- to 5-μm range for tailpipe detec-
tion and in the 8- to 12-μm range for A/C skin detection.
From (2.86) and (2.87), by assuming a tailpipe temperature Ttp of 700 K, a 
nozzle area of 1,600 cm2, and emissivity ε of 0.9, we obtain a radiation intensity 
Jt = 693 W/sterad and by assuming a skin temperature Tsk = 414 K (A/C speed M 
= 2), an A/C area A = 10 m2 = 105 cm2, and emissivity ε = 0.05 for aluminum, we 
obtain Jt = 255 W/sterad.
The atmospheric attenuation (dB/km) for 23-km visibility at the midband for 
the 3.5- and 10-μm-wavelength bandwidths is reported in Table 2.17.

where all the parameters have already been discussed and need only to be selected 
in order to get the IR missile detection range for a high-speed fighter aircraft. This 
equation has been written as the product of five terms:
•• The first is relevant to the target and has been evaluated above for the two 
bandwidths where detection is maximized.
•• The second term represents the atmospheric loss, which is dependent on the 
range and therefore the above equation has to be solved iteratively. As shown 
in Table 2.17, the atmospheric attenuation decreases with altitude, therefore 
the detection ranges are larger in an air-to-air combat than in a ground-to-air 
combat.
•• The third term is relevant to the optics of the seeker and its parameters define 
the IFOV of the seeker.
•• The fourth term is D* (cm Hz1/2/W), the detectivity, measured with the band-
width of 1 Hz, of a detector with a square aperture of 1 cm2. Its value depends 
on the detector material and the selected cooling method. As an example, the 
current preferred IR missile detector material InSb requires cooling to liquid-
nitrogen temperatures (77 K) to be sensitive in the 3- to 5-μm bandwidth 
with D* ≈ 9 × 1010 (cm Hz1/2/W).

•• The fifth term is relevant to the parameters of the system, such as the system 
losses Ls, the overall FOV Ω, the frame period TF, and the required SNR for 
the detection conditions (Pd,Pfa).
Typical modern IR missile detection ranges are 6 to 12 km for an A/C plume 
and 4 to 6 km for an A/C skin, depending on the altitude.
2.6.2.3  IR Missile Seeker Counter-Countermeasures
Except for the first-generation IR seekers, successive generations have employed 
CCMs against the most used countermeasure: flares, the operation of which will be 
described in Chapter 6.
In general, IR CCMs operate in two phases: The first phase is the detection of 
the flare within the seeker’s FOV and the second phase is the actuation of some 
method to reject the flare.
A variety of techniques can be used to detect flares:
•• Rise-time measurements: An abrupt, sharp rise-time increase in received en-
ergy indicates the presence of a flare in the seeker’s FOV.
•• Two-color detection:  A sudden change in the ratio of the received energies 
in the two bandwidths indicates the presence of a flare in the seeker’s FOV.
•• Kinematics filters: In a beam-aspect engagement, these filters can sense the 
sudden change in the LOS rate when trying to track the flare due to the rapid 
deceleration that flares incur (as a result of their high aerodynamic drag) as 
soon as they are dispensed from an aircraft. 
Once the presence of the flare has been detected within the seeker’s FOV, the 
rejection of the flare consists of exploiting the effect that the flares separate to the 
rear of the aircraft and two hot spots are distinguishable on opposite sides of the 
FOV. The rejection methods that can be used are:
•• Use of a memory technique: The seeker rejects its freshly detected track and 
keeps its motion relative to the target, waiting for the flare to leave its FOV.
•• Biasing gimbals: Biasing of the seeker gimbals will drive the seeker in the 
direction of the target motion. This action causes the flare to leave the FOV 
earlier.
•• Use of an attenuation filter: An attenuation filter is placed in the quadrant 
of the FOV below and to the rear of the target in order to reduce any energy 
received from the flare. If the attenuation amount is sufficient, the seeker will 
continue to track the target.
•• Use of FOV gating: In a rosette scan seeker, some time after the flare is 
dispensed, the target and the flare will be no longer in the same lobe of the 
scan. By computing the relative motion of the target, the missile is able to 
determine on which lobes the target should appear. Thus, information from 
all other lobes can be ignored, allowing the missile to keep its track on the 
target.

2.6.3  Missile Approach Warner
MAWs supplement radar warning receivers (RWRs) in tactical aircraft EW systems, 
because both have to warn the aircraft of an approaching missile and provide its 
direction of arrival and possibly its time to impact. RWRs alert aircraft to the ap-
proach of radar guided missiles, whereas MAWs warn aircraft of an approaching 
short-range IR/EO guided missile attack. Tactical aircraft must have access to an-
gular and raw distance information in order to counter the missile attack by either 
dispensing flares or employing active countermeasures (see Chapter 6).
MAWs may be either passive or active. The former can operate either in the IR 
or ultraviolet (UV) band to detect the exhaust plume signature from the missile’s 
rocket engine and to provide the missile’s direction of arrival. The latter is in gen-
eral a pulse Doppler radar that detects and tracks missiles by means of their skin 
return. 
The radar has the advantage of providing all-weather range and range-rate 
data that enable the evaluation of the time to impact. Disadvantages involve the 
difficulty of discriminating a small RCS target from strong clutter returns and the 
possibility that, when operating in continuous mode, the radar will act as a bea-
con for an ARM. The latter disadvantage can be dealt with by having a passive 
MAW to cue any radar operation. Therefore, in some cases the two types of sensors 
are combined in an integrated MAW system, which provides the benefits of both 
sensors.
Passive MAW sensors, either IR or UV, detect the missile’s exhaust plume at 
some point prior to burn-out6. They are in general staring systems, which use a 
mosaic of detectors to generate an image of the target scene and provide accurate 
angular data, on the order of 1°, and a rough range estimate on the basis of the 
received signal energy. 
IR MAWs are susceptible to background (clutter) false alarms; therefore, in 
recent systems two-color FPA detectors have been used in order to exploit spectral-
spatial-temporal clutter rejection techniques.
UV detectors are designed to detect the burning of solid rocket propellants. De-
tection can be accomplished with low false alarms in the “solar blind” region be-
tween 0.22 and 0.28 μm, because the Earth’s ozone layer (usually from 30 to 50 km 
from the Earth’s surface) absorbs most of the solar radiation in this band. Thus, at 
altitudes below the ozone layer (and below, say, 20 km) the signature of the burn-
ing of solid rocket propellants is detectable above an extremely low background.
Discussion of active MAW sensors, which are pulse Doppler radars, is included 
in Section 2.3.7. 
2.7  Laser Radar Systems
Laser radar systems operate like microwave radars but at a much higher fre-
quency—on the order of 20 to 200 times higher. The higher frequency has the 
beneficial effect of smaller components and of an extremely high angular accuracy. 
6.	
In fact, the missile, after the launch boosting phase and midcourse phase, where it produces an energetic, 
highly detectable signature, may have exhausted its engine such that in the approaching phase the aircraft 
may have no more plume.

Evolution of Signal Emitters and Sensors
The atmospheric attenuation, however, is significant at these high frequencies and 
hence laser radars built to operate on the ground have a limited range (about 10 
km). Spaceborne laser radars, exploiting the absence of atmospheric attenuation, 
may have ranges of thousands of kilometers. 
Laser radars, due to their very narrow beamwidth (on the order of 1 mrad), are 
not apt for volume searches; that task is better accomplished by IR passive systems. 
The coarse angular position of the detected target provided by the latter is used to 
cue the laser radar, which provides the range and radial velocity of the target.  
Laser radars, primarily because of atmospheric transmittance windows (see 
Figure 2.3) and the availability of detectors and laser sources, operate in general at 
two wavelength bands: around 1 μm (1 μm  = 10–6 m) with solid-state (semiconduc-
tor) lasers and around 9.2 to 10.8 μm with gas (CO2) lasers.
The military applications of laser systems are:
•• Designators, which illuminate targets with a laser beam so to guide muni-
tions against them;
•• Rangefinders, which measure with a high accuracy the distance of the target 
from an observer;
•• Radar seekers, which are integrated within munitions (or missiles) to identify 
and autonomously guide the munitions to the desired target;
•• Target speed measurements, which are taken when used in a heterodyne re-
ceiver configuration to determine the Doppler frequency shift of the target.
•• Differential absorption measurements (differential absorption laser, DIAL) in 
nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) operations, which measure the con-
centration of a particular gas in the atmosphere through the differential at-
tenuation of the transmitted signal at two wavelengths. The first wavelength 
is tuned to the absorption line of the selected gas, and the second wavelength 
is far from the first one. The amount of attenuation is proportional to the gas 
concentration in the atmosphere.
The two last applications are conducted with CO2 gas lasers that can be tuned 
over the large bandwidth mentioned earlier.
2.7.1  Laser Target Designation and Ranging
Target designators are used in ground battlefield scenarios either on board aircraft, 
such as in the LANTIRN (Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red System 
for Night) system, or on ground-based equipment to provide range and bearing 
information to the munitions launched against a target. Laser target designators 
are relatively large and heavy systems (up to 20 kg) that have a range of about 10 
km. Some air-launched special munitions such as the Maverick laser-guided bomb 
and the Hellfire missile contain laser seekers that locate and guide the weapons to 
the target.
Laser rangefinders are smaller (about 3 to 4L) and lighter in weight than the 
designators. They resemble a pair of binoculars and have an effective range of 
about 1 km. Most of the currently available laser target designators and rangefind-

ers are operating at the 1.064-μm wavelength (Nd: YAG), which is not a complete-
ly eye-safe wavelength [20] because the human eye is sensible from 0.4 to 1.2 μm.
The recent advent of small, rugged, and uncooled mid-IR band semiconductor 
laser diodes has shifted the usable wavelength bandwidth beyond 1.4 μm, which is 
the limit wavelength for unsafe human eye operation.
Typical semiconductor laser materials are:
•• Ho:YAG, emitting at 2.09 to 2.10 μm,
•• Tm:YAG, emitting at 2.32 μm,
•• Er:YAG, emitting at 2.94 μm,
•• Dy:YLF, emitting at 4.34 μm,
where Ho = holmium, Tm = thulium, Er = erbium, Dy = dysprosium, YAG = yt-
trium-aluminum garnet, and YLF = yttrium-lithium fluoride.
In military applications the laser radars locate and classify targets and guide 
munitions to them. In general, they use three types of imagery to perform their task: 
•• Range images, by processing the backscattered signals from the target 
scatterers;
•• Elevation images, which delineate the height profile of the scene within the 
FOV;
•• Intensity images, which are produced by the differences in the reflectivity of 
the objects within the FOV.
2.7.2  Laser Radar Receivers
The two types of receivers are direct and heterodyne. Direct receivers are similar to 
the EO detectors, with the difference that they measure the backscattered energy 
from the target. The schematic block diagram of a direct receiver is shown in Figure 
2.94, which illustrates both the imaging functions as well as the servo-mechanism 
for scanning the mirrors of the optics to acquire the target within its FOV.
In a heterodyne receiver a portion of the laser transmitted beam is diverted into 
the frequency shifter. The shifter provides a local oscillator frequency to mix with 
the received laser signal, which is then translated to a lower frequency where it can 
be amplified to enhance the receiver’s sensitivity. The schematic block diagram of a 
laser heterodyne receiver is shown in Figure 2.95. This scheme allows for coherent 
laser radar operation, which not only provides intensity and range information but 
also the Doppler frequency shift proportional to the target radial velocity. Coherent 
laser operation is based on a CO2 laser at 10.6 μm, which produces a very stable 
long-term frequency.
2.7.3  Laser Radar Range Equation
The signal power received by a laser radar from a target at range R can be derived 
in a very similar manner to that used for microwave radar (as described in Section 

150

2.2). We will use the same symbolism as used there but recalling that in the IR do-
main lenses and optics are used instead of antennas.
The received signal power Pr can be expressed as the product of five terms as 
follows:

Figure 2.95  Heterodyne laser radar receiver.

The first term expresses the distribution of the point source laser power Pt over 
a spherical area 4πR2. The second term expresses through the gain Glens the focus-
ing effect of the lens, which directs the laser power in the direction of the target and 
not isotropically over 4π sterad. The gain of the lens can be expressed also as Glens 
= 4π/(πθB
2/4), where the beamwidth θB provided by the lens is multiplied by the 
factor (√π/4) to take into account the uniform illumination of the aperture (which 
is narrowing the beam). The third term expresses the portion of the incident power 
intercepted by a point target and isotropically reirradiated (the so-called RCS). The 
fourth term describes the capture area of the receiving aperture (usually a circle of 
diameter D0), and the fifth factor represents both the losses incurred in the two-
way atmospheric path as well as the system losses.
The main difference with respect to the microwave radar equation is with the 
RCS of the target. A first consideration is that in the microwave domain the radar 
range equation is applicable in the far field of the antenna, which is defined as: 
	
2
2
/
FF
R
D λ
=
	
(2.101)
where RFF (m) is the far-field distance, D (m) is the larger dimension of the antenna, 
and λ (m) is the transmitted wavelength. In the case of the laser domain for λ = 1 
μm = 10–6 m, even for a small dimension of the lens diameter such as D0 = 0.05m, 
we have RFF = 5,161m. Therefore, taking into account that the actual lens diameter 
can be two to three times larger, we have to understand that laser radar operation 
is always conducted in the near field of the lens.
A second consideration is that of the extremely narrow beam of the laser radar, 
which is proportional to the ratio of the wavelength to the lens diameter:

(2.102) 
which means that for D0 = 0.05m and λ = 1 μm, a beamwidth θB = 0.0176 mrad.
With such a beamwidth, at a distance of 10 km the beam produces a spot of 
diameter d = RθB = 0.176m, which is usually much less than the dimension of any 
useful target.
The last consideration implies that an actual target is never completely irradi-
ated by the laser beam and therefore the backscattering cannot be isotropically 
radiated over a full sphere but only in the forward hemisphere of the target, that is, 
no more σ/(4πR2) but σ/(2πR2). Hence the RCS is defined as:

where ρ is the target reflectivity [i.e., the complement to 1 of the emissivity ε(ρ = 
1 – ε)]. As an example, unpainted metal is much more reflective at the mid–IR band 
than the reflected background.

Another often-used assumption relevant to the distribution of backscattered 
power from the target is that of Lambertian scattering, which states that the reflect-
ed flux per unit solid angle is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the 
direction of interest and the normal to the surface. So the total backscatter power 
is not distributed over 2π sterad but only over π sterad, because it can be deducted 
from Figure 2.96, which brings us to the following computation:

except for the consideration of Lambertian scattering (which produces a reduction

In the case of the laser target designator, the laser beam at target distance R1 is

of the target) and the laser receiver is positioned at a distance R2 ≠ R1. Therefore,

2.7.4  Target Detection
As shown in the case of microwave radar, the detection of a target is impaired by 
the presence of noise in the receiver. In what follows we report on the noise level of 
the two types of laser receivers discussed earlier. 
In the case of direct detection, the laser backscatter energy impinges directly on 
the detector, whose noise level is (as shown in Section 2.6.2)

chanics, which indicates that the power spectral density of an ideal amplifier can

Laser radar targets can be divided into two general categories: (1) speckled 
targets, in which case they are composed of many similar reflectors; and (2) glint 
targets, in which case they have a dominating reflector. The two types of targets 
correspond, respectively, to the scintillating targets and fluctuating targets studied 
in microwave radar detection theory (see Swerling models 1 and 3) and indeed they 
follow the same probability density distribution of their echo value: The speck-
led targets follow a Rayleigh distribution and the glint targets follow a Gaussian 
distribution.
Having determined the ratio Pr/N = SNR and the target category, the probabil-
ity of detection is evaluated through the usual detection curves (Swerling models of 
microwave radars) after having fixed a threshold over the noise power level in ac-
cordance with achieving a selected probability of false alarms due to noise samples 
only.
Relevant to the measurement of target kinematics parameters the laser radar 
operates in a manner that is identical to that of microwave radars and all of the 
considerations developed in this chapter about radar waveforms and signal pro-
cessing also apply to laser radars.

Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor 
Systems
3.1  Introduction
EW RF band sensors are those systems capable of detecting, classifying, identifying, 
and locating the RF band emitters of surveillance systems, weapons systems, and 
communication links of the military systems present in the environment.
Typically the radar-type emitters of surveillance and weapons systems operate 
at high frequencies (usually >1 GHz) to exploit directive antennas for target direc-
tion measurements. They also use phase- or frequency-modulated waveforms either 
of the periodic pulse type or CW type to exploit pulse compression techniques on 
reception to obtain accurate measurements of target distance. The carrier frequen-
cy of the signal waveform can be changed pulse to pulse or by a group of pulses ( 
in accordance with the required pulse coherent integration performed by the radar 
receiver) within a large bandwidth, called the frequency agility bandwidth, to pro-
vide an ECCM technique. Currently there is some revival in the Western world of 
the use of lower frequency radar emitters (usually <1 GHz) to exploit antistealth 
and passive covert radar capabilities. 
The communications-type emitters of the communication links typically oper-
ate at lower frequencies (usually <1 GHz), although currently they are expanding 
to higher frequencies to exploit larger signal bandwidths and the number of chan-
nel bandwidths. They usually transmit quite long (with respect to the radar emitter 
ones) amplitude/phase/frequency-modulated CW waveforms, seldom pulse bursts, 
and exploit spread-spectrum (SS) and FH techniques, which are the equivalent 
communications terms for the pulse compression and frequency agility techniques 
of radar, only both are exploited as anti-interference or ECCM techniques.
Until recently (and still currently in ground-based systems), sensors devoted 
to radar-type emitters and those devoted to communications-type emitters had a 
substantial difference based on the characteristics of the emitter waveforms (as 
just described and shown in Chapter 2) with regard to sensor architecture, the 
techniques employed, and their operation. The use of new technologies allows us 
to exploit, for airborne and shipboard applications, a common architecture for 
the EW sensors of both types of emitters, thus providing a so-called EW spectrum

sensor. This chapter is therefore split into sections that deal with radar EW sensors, 
communications EW sensors, and EW spectrum sensors. 
3.2  EW Radar Band Sensors
The architecture of the EW radar band sensor is different from that of the EW com-
munications band sensor in accordance with the radar signal waveforms (usually 
periodic short-duration pulses) and the main functions performed by the sensor, 
which have to be executed in a very short time due to the extreme rapidity with 
which a weapon system becomes a threat. The functions and classifications of the 
relevant sensors are as follows:
•• A radar warning receiver (RWR) warns of the presence of threat emitters and 
gives an indication of the direction of arrival (DOA) within the sensor spatial 
and frequency coverage.
•• An electronic support measurement (ESM) receiver detects DOA and clas-
sification of all the radar emitters within the sensor spatial and frequency 
coverage. 
•• An electronic intelligence (ELINT) receiver provides prolonged and accurate 
measurements of all of the characteristics of a radar emitter (waveform and 
antenna patterns) in order to provide the data necessary for its analysis and 
modeling of the associated weapon system as well as for its identification to 
be logged in the emitter libraries of the two previous sensor types
The typical architecture for these past generation sensors is briefly discussed 
next in order to provide the reader with some information about the sensors’ struc-
ture before introducing the main challenges to be faced by EW sensors, which 
include the following:
•• Receiver sensitivity, that is, the minimum signal power level at which signal 
detection and its parameter measurements are achieved by the sensor;
•• Probability of interception (POI) of all of the emitters (or only the threat 
emitters) present within the sensor spatial and frequency coverage within a 
predefined time period (time of interception, TOI).
•• The ability to discriminate the various emitters within the spatial and fre-
quency coverage and thus to classify the radar emitter mode (i.e., the char-
acteristic parameters of its waveform and antenna scan type) in order to 
identify the emitter and its associated weapons system. 
The architecture of the past generation EW radar band sensors is discussed 
in Section 3.5.1, before proceeding to a description of the architecture of the new 
generation of EW radar band sensors that are considered in detail in this chapter.

3.2  EW Radar Band Sensors

3.2.1  RWR Architecture
Basic EW passive surveillance equipment used in applications that do not require 
high sensitivity is represented by the RWR. Its task is the provision of an alarm to 
the aircraft pilot/platform commander relevant to the main-beam illumination of 
an emitting threat in the surrounding environment. The following functions are 
performed by the RWR: 
•• Detection of the threatening emitter,
•• Coarse measurement of the DOA of the emission relative to the platform 
longitudinal axis (this measurement requires many directional antennas with 
associated receiver channels in a monopulse fashion),
•• Measurement of the instantaneous threat signal parameters,
•• Deinterleaving and sorting of the threat signal within a not highly dense 
signal environment, 
•• Identification of the threat signal by comparison with properly prepared data 
libraries. 
The typical schematic block diagram of a wide-open (WO) RWR (i.e., complete 
RF coverage of the required threat emitter spectrum), which is the most commonly 
used RWR architecture, is shown in Figure 3.5 (refer to Section 3.4 for greater 
Figure 3.1  Typical WO receiver for EW applications.

detail). In this architecture the crystal detector (which usually acts as a square-law 
detector) channel allows detection over the entire RF bandwidth as limited by the 
input RF filter, but removes any information relevant to the frequency and phase 
of the emitter waveform. The video filter performs a smoothing in order to enable 
the detection of pulses having from a given (minimum) PW to larger PWs. A crystal 
detector channel is associated with each directive antenna of the equipment, and 
the relative measured pulse amplitudes are processed to provide the following in-
stantaneous emitter pulse parameters:
•• Pulse amplitude (A),
•• Pulse width (PW),
•• Direction of arrival (DOA),
•• Time of arrival (TOA).
The RF signal, before detection, is also sent to an instantaneous frequency 
measurement (IFM) device (see Section 3.5), which provides the signal frequency 
estimation (frequency F). The IFM is usually a quite expensive device due to the 
very large bandwidth required and the microwave circuitry involved. Most early 
WO RWRs were without IFM.
All of the measurements of the instantaneous emitter pulse parameters are gath-
ered within a pulse descriptor word (PDW), which is used in the pulse deinterleav-
ing process (clustering of all the received PDWs belonging to each of the various 
emitters present in the environment) and emitter sorting process, which provides 
the evaluation of long time emitter signal parameters such as the pulse repetition 
interval (PRI), antenna scan type (AST), and antenna scan relevant period (ASP).  
These two processes are provided by the equipment processor (not shown in Figure 
3.1), which also performs threat identification through comparison of the sorted 
emitter data with the threat emitter data available within the mission threat library. 
3.2.2  ESM Architecture
In applications such as ESM equipment, in which in addition to the provision of 
threat warning a high sensitivity is required to detect both mainlobes and sidelobes 
of all type of emitters present in the environment (and accordingly a very dense sig-
nal environment is expected), a superheterodyne (SH) receiver or a mixed SH + WO 
receiver architecture can be used. The architecture of an ESM employing a SH stage 
is shown in Figure 3.2. In this architecture the overall RF bandwidth is divided in a 
number of sub-bands that are individually shifted into a fixed IF bandwidth by one 
of a number of local oscillator (LO) frequencies as generated by a synthesizer or a 
comb generator that can sweep the overall RF bandwidth. The required selectivity 
provided by this architecture has to be traded off against the requirement of a very 
high POI against all types of emitters present in the environment. The trade-off 
is usually performed by adopting a large IF bandwidth (larger than the available 
radar frequency agility bandwidth) and by rapid LO switching schemes. This type 
of receiver is usually quite expensive. So to reduce the cost of a complete SH archi-
tecture, also applied to the many monopulse DOA measurement channels, the latter 
are based on the WO architecture. 

3.3  EW Sensor Sensitivity 
161
3.2.3  ELINT Architecture
The third type of EW passive surveillance equipment is the ELINT receiver. The 
task of this equipment is to selectively acquire and analyze, both instantaneously as 
well as long term, the signal characteristics of an emitter in order to gather sufficient 
data to provide to the data libraries of RWR and ESM equipment for its identifica-
tion by those equipment.
The ELINT equipment, as shown in Figure 3.3, is based on the SH receiver 
architecture but with a number of selectable IF bandwidths. IF filters, coupled to a 
high-gain directive antenna, are able to achieve the very high sensitivity required to 
analyze the signals also transmitted from the far lobes of the radar antenna. The se-
lectable IF bandwidth is also required to analyze peculiar intrapulse and interpulse 
signal modulations, which may provide individual emitter identification (emitter 
fingerprinting).
3.3  EW Sensor Sensitivity
 The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the minimum received signal power at 
which the signal is detected and its relevant instantaneous parameters are measured. 
A radar-type EW sensor is required to detect a radar emitter (airborne or surface) 
well before the latter can detect the EW sensor platform (aircraft or ship) or site

(with its associated weapon system). This requirement is measured by the range 
advantage factor (RAF) and was quite easily met in the past until the advent of the 
so-called low probability of intercept radar [1], which has required a number of 
technological innovations of the radar-type EW sensor architecture.
The RAF is defined as the ratio of the range Re at which the sensor detects the 
radar emitter to the range Rr at which the radar detects the EW sensor platform, 
characterized by its RCS:

(3.1)
To protect its platform, the required excess sensor range aRr = (Re – Rr) is 
dependent on the product of the closing velocity vc, which is the sum vc = ve + vr 
of the relative velocities of the two platforms (sensor and radar), and the warning 
time Tw, which is the time allotted to the EW sensor platform commander to be 
prepared to react against the radar threat; that is:

(3.2) 
With the above conditions in mind, the required radar-type EW sensor sensitiv-
ity can be evaluated through the range equations of both the radar and sensor as 
relevant to the engagement situation depicted in Figure 3.4 in which the EW sensor 
is placed on a ship (a platform with a large RCS) and the radar emitter is placed on 
an aircraft moving toward the ship with a velocity almost equal to vc.
The radar detection range equation expresses [2] the received signal power Sr at 
the radar as the product of three terms: the first representing the radar transmitted 
power propagating to range R in the form of a spherical wave, the second repre-
senting the backscattered power from the target RCS propagating back to the radar 
at range R in the form of a spherical wave, and the third representing the radar 
receive aperture Ar = Grλ2/4π:

Lt = factor expressing the radar losses from the transmitter to the Tx antenna,

From Chapter 2, we know that radar detection occurs when Sr exceeds, by an 
amount dependent on the required probability of detection PD (usually ≥90%), a 
threshold set above the video detected radar noise power floor in order to get a 
false alarm (detection produced by a noise sample), probability PFA (usually <10–6). 
Let us define this power value as Sr0.
The EW sensor detection range equation expresses, in a manner similar to that 
above, the received signal power Se at the EW sensor as the product of two terms, 
the first representing the radar transmitted power propagating to range R in the 
form of a spherical wave and the second representing the EW sensor receive aper-

Gt  = gain of the radar Tx antenna,
Ge =gain of the EW sensor Rx antenna,
λ = wavelength (m), 
Le = factor expressing the EW sensor losses from the Rx antenna to the receiver.
The detection of a signal in sensors is performed by setting at the output of 
the receiver detector a threshold above the receiver noise power level N in order to 
achieve a false alarm probability PFA (usually <10–6) and a probability of detection 
PD (usually ≥90%) of a signal of sufficient power S. Let us define this power value 
as Se0.
To evaluate the RAF, as well as the sensitivities of the two involved types of 
equipment, we have to remember from detection theory (see Appendix A) that for 
the assumed values of the two probabilities (PD = 90%, PFA = 10–6) the SNR rel-
evant to a nonfluctuating signal power is

Actually for an EW sensor to get a full reliable signal with instantaneous pa-
rameter measurement a larger SNR is required (e.g., the SNR required for a fair 
DOA estimate is >18 dB). However, for the considerations that we will develop we 
can consider SNR0 to be valid for both types of equipment.

To gain insight into this equation, let us make some assumptions that have been 
shown to be valid in many cases:
•• Gt = Gr (i.e., the radar Rx antenna gain is the same as the radar Tx antenna 
gain, which is the case for a single-beam Rx antenna),
•• Lt = Lr (i.e., the radar receiver losses are nearly the same as the radar trans-
mitter losses),
•• Fe ~ 5Fr (i.e., the EW sensor receiver noise figure is much larger than the ra-
dar one, due to the wider receive bandwidth),
•• Le ~1 dB = 1.2,
•• SNR0 = 13 dB = 20.
With the above assumptions and rearranging (3.12), we have:

where K = [(Fr /Fe
2 Le
2)(1/(kT SNR0))] = 83 dBm/MHz.
Let us now evaluate the RAF in some typical cases.
Case 1: Past generation ground surveillance radar and past generation EW sen-
sor (WO preamplified crystal detector of sensitivity class –60 dBm) on an aircraft. 
The radar parameters are:
Pt = 100 kW = 80 dBm; Gt = Gr = 35 dB; Bt = 1 MHz = 0 dBMHz;
λ = 0.1m = –10 dBmt; Gp = 13 dB; Fr = 3 dB; Lt = Lr = 2 dB; RCS = 5 m2 = 7 dBm2
With the above parameters the radar detection range evaluated with (3.9) is:
Rr = 22.75 dBkm = 188.4 km = 101.8 Nm
The EW sensor parameters are:
Ge = Gpe = 0 dB; Bv = 20 MHz; BRF = 16000 MHz; Fe = 10 dB; Le = 2 dB
Be = (2 Bv BRF)1/2 = 800 MHz = 29 dBMHz 
With these parameters the EW sensor detection range evaluated with (3.10) is:
	
Re = 35.5 dBkm = 3548 km = 1916 Nm
and from (3.10′) in the case of Gte = Gt/SLL = 0 dB, the EW sensor detection range 
is:
	
R′e = 18 dBkm = 63 km = 34 Nm

3.3  EW Sensor Sensitivity 
167
Thus, the RAF on the radar mainlobe and sidelobes is, respectively, RAFML = 
18.8 and RAFSL = 0.33, which means that in any case the EW sensor platform is 
well warned in advance only of the mainlobe of the radar emitter.
A similar evaluation shows that an even much simpler past generation EW sen-
sor (non-preamplified WO crystal video detector of sensitivity class -–45 dBm) can 
provide RAFML = 2.64 and RAFSL = 0.046 against the same radar emitter.
Case 2: New generation LPI radar and past generation EW sensor (WO pre-
amplified crystal detector of sensitivity class –60 dBm) on a frigate ship. The radar 
parameters are:
Pt = 100W = 50 dBm; Gt = Gr = 35 dB; Bt = 500 MHz = 27 dBMHz; λ = 0.03m 
      = –15 dBmt; 
	Gp = 30 dB; Fr = 3 dB; Lt = Lr = 2 dB; RCS = 1,000 m2 = 30 dBm2
With these parameters the radar detection range evaluated with (3.9) is:
	
Rr = 16.0 dBkm = 40 km = 21.6 Nm
The EW sensor parameters are the same as for case 1 above:
	Ge = Gpe = 0 dB; Bv = 20 MHz; BRF = 16000 MHz; Fe = 10 dB; Le = 2 dB
	
Be = (2 Bv BRF)1/2 = 800 MHz = 29 dBMHz 
With these parameters the EW sensor detection range evaluated with (3.10) is:
	
Re = 15.5 dBkm = 35.5 km = 19.2 Nm
and from (3.10′) in the case of Gte = Gt/SLL = 0 dB the EW sensor detection range is
	
R′e = –2 dBkm = 0.63 km = 0.34 Nm
Thus, the RAF for the radar mainlobe and sidelobes is, respectively, RAFML = 
0.88 and RAFSL ~ 0, which means that the EW sensor platform is not warned in 
advance of the presence of the radar emitter. The situation for the EW platform 
is even worse in the case of a very low probability of intercept radar (VPLIR) [1], 
which decreases its transmitted power and modifies its waveform to keep a con-
stant received echo power while approaching the target (i.e., Re ~ 0 km).
Case 3: New generation LPIR and new generation EW sensor (a number of 
large band digital receivers connected to a wideband high-gain phased array an-
tenna of sensitivity class –90 dBm) on a frigate ship. The radar parameters are the 
same as those of case 2 above:
Pt = 100W = 50 dBm; Gt = Gr = 35 dB; Bt = 500 MHz = 27 dBMHz; λ = 0.03m = 
      –15 dBmt; Gp = 30 dB; Fr = 3 dB; Lt = Lr = 2 dB; RCS = 1000 m2 = 30dBm2
With these parameters the radar detection range evaluated with (3.9) is :
	
Rr = 16.0 dBkm = 40 km = 21.6 Nm

168

Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
The EW sensor parameters are as follows:
	Ge = 15 dB; Gpe = 5 dB; Be = 20 MHz = 13 dBMHz; Fe = 10 dB; Le = 2 dB
With these parameters the EW sensor detection range evaluated with (3.10) is:
	
Re = 33.5 dBkm = 2239 km = 1209 Nm
and from (3.10 ′) in the case of Gte = Gt/SLL = 0 dB, the EW sensor detection range 
is
	
R′e = 16 dBkm = 40 km = 21.6 Nm
Thus, the RAF for the radar mainlobe and sidelobes is, respectively, RAFML = 
30.2 and RAFSL = 1, which means that the EW sensor platform is warned well in 
advance about an attack from the radar emitter platform and insufficiently warned 
of the presence of the radar emitter in the environment.
3.3.1  Conclusions
From (3.13) we note that good RAF can easily be achieved by a small RCS EW plat-
form against past generation radars (high Pt and low Gp) even with very wide noise 
equivalent bandwidth WO receivers (see case 1 above) while the RAF is difficult to 
be achieved as shown in case 2 if:
•• Detection has to occur on the sidelobes of the radar (Gte/Gt) < –30 dB.
•• The radar transmitter power Pt is very much decreased (on the order of 1W 
or less for the new generation of stealth or VLPIRs) and consequently also 
the radar processing gain Gp is highly increased.
•• The radar frequency is increased (λ is decreasing).
•• The EW sensor platform has a large RCS.
The directions along which the new generation of EW sensors are moving in 
order to regain the RAF are as shown in case 3:
•• Increasing the antenna gain Ge through adoption of phased array antennas,
•• Reducing the equivalent noise bandwidth Be by using new architectures 
based on large-bandwidth channelized digital receivers,
•• Adoption of new algorithms that provide fair detection processing gain Gpe 
on the LPI radar waveforms.
3.4  Probability of Interception
The first task to be accomplished by EW equipment on board a platform when 
accessing a new territory is the interception of the threat emitters present in the 

3.4  Probability of Interception 
169
environment. Interception is fundamental to the warning function of EW equip-
ment and it comprises signal detection and measurement of the signal parameters 
and DOA of the threat emitter signal, followed by the identification of the emitter 
(and hence of its associated weapons system) and possibly a rough estimate of its 
distance from the defended platform, in order to assess its dangerousness. Pres-
ence and DOA of a peculiar or unexpected threat emitter can induce the platform 
commander either to divert the platform route, so as to avoid engagement with the 
threat, or to keep the original route if the platform is provided with sufficient ECMs 
to tackle the threat.
Let us consider three simple EW equipment architectures to introduce the eval-
uation of a sensor’s POI:
1.	 An omni wideband (WB) antenna, covering the complete azimuth plane 
(with some extent in the elevation plane) and an associated WB receiver 
covering the complete required RF bandwidth. A simple modified archi-
tecture envisages, in lieu of the omni antenna, for or more WB directional 
antennas that cover the complete azimuth plane, but provide through the 
differential signal amplitude, as received from the antennas, a rough DOA 
estimate.
2.	 A WB antenna of the above type associated with a SH narrowband (NB) 
receiver that is swiftly swept across the whole WB.
3.	 A rotating high-gain WB antenna associated with either a WB receiver or a 
SH NB receiver. This solution offers high sensitivity and is in general used 
in ELINT equipment to provide emitter detection and continuous param-
eter measurements at the emitter antenna sidelobes. 
At first glance interception may seem an easy task to be accomplished because 
it would be sufficient to provide the EW platform with a WO receiver, capable of 
instantaneously surveying the whole azimuth and threat frequency band. Indeed, 
this was the solution for the RWR in the early days of EW (say, the years 1950 to 
1970) when there were few radar threats in the environment and most of them 
used low-duty-cycle and high effective radiated power (ERP). (Duty cycle d is de-
fined as the ratio of pulse duration or PW to the PRI, i.e., d = PW/PRI and ERP is 
the product of transmit power Pt and Tx antenna gain Gt, i.e., ERP = Pt Gt). New 
threats are characterized by a higher duty cycle and, hence, lower peak power and 
ERP for a given level of detection performance (which depends on average power). 
Further, the current environment is characterized by a largely increased number of 
radar threats. Increased numbers of more modern radars have led to environments 
with high pulse densities, measured as M pulses per unit time:
	
r
av
M
N PRF
=
	
(3.14)
where Nr is the number of radars present and PRFav is the average PRF, which can 
approach 100 kHz when HPRF radars are present. Thus, M can reach values of mil-
lions of pulses per second. In addition, the use of long pulses leads to overlapping 
of threat pulses such that low-level pulses can be masked, and reception of long-du-
ration waveforms can be interrupted by high-level pulses from other radars. Pulse 
masking in turn presents a large difficulty for the WB receiver in the evaluation of 

170 
�����������������������������������對������

the PRI and in the determination of PRI law (i.e., the time behavior of the PRI), 
which characterizes the radar emitter and allows its identification.
A way to solve this problem is the adoption of a SH NB receiver for which 
band Bs is swiftly shifted in steps of duration Td (the dwell time in milliseconds) 
within a scanning period Tscan (fraction of a second) across the complete required 
RF coverage. This solution offers the advantage of strongly reducing the instanta-
neously received pulse density and pulse overlapping as well as providing a higher 
sensitivity with respect to the WB open receiver. The drawback of this solution (be-
yond some detection of quite large out-of-band spurious signals to be solved with 
the adoption of a WB large signal detector) is the detection of scanning emitters, 
which do not illuminate continuously with their main beam the EW sensor but only 
periodically (ASP) and in accordance with their scanning law (AST). Most of the 
surveillance and target acquisition radars are of this type and thus both ASP and 
AST are important parameters for the identification of the radar emitter. 
To evaluate the POI of any of the two types of periodic EW sensor scan tech-
niques (either stepped center frequency sweeping of a bandpass filter or the con-
tinuous rotation of the antenna 3-dB beamwidth) with respect to radar scans, we 
can schematize the problem, following the approach of [2], as the evaluation of 
the time coincidences (windows overlaps) between two periodic pulse trains, as 
depicted in Figure 3.5: 
1.	 The radar signal window width, sometimes called the time on target, is 
given by τR = TRθR3dB/2π, where TR is the radar antenna scan period and 
θR3dB is the radar beamwidth;
2.	 The EW sensor window width is either the dwell time of the sensor band-
pass, given by τE = TEBE/BS, or τE = TEθE3dB, where TE is the sensor scan 
period, BE is the bandwidth of each frequency step within the scanned 
bandwidth BS, and θE3dB is the sensor beamwidth.

3.4  Probability of Interception 
171
Before solving the general case of different window durations τE ≠ τR, let us 
assume that τE = τR = T and assume this duration as the unit time, so that TE = kT 
and ΤR = hT are the periods of the EW sensor and radar scan, respectively, and

Equation (3.15′) can be solved using the theory of linear congruencies, which 
states that a solution exists if, given three integers a, b, and c, the greatest common 
divisor (gcd) of two integers (a,b) [i.e., gcd(a,b)] is a factor of the third integer; that 
is, it divides the third integer c. Furthermore, if there is a solution, many additional 
solutions can be obtained from the first one by adding to it multiples of the least 
common multiple (lcm) of (a,b) [i.e., lcm(a,b)]. Let’s clarify this statement by con-
sidering the following three integers:
	
k = 12, h = 15, and p = 6
Then gcd(12,15) = 3, which is a factor of p = 6, and lcm(12,15) = 60. The first 
solution for (3.15′) gives m = n = 2 and the following ones are mi = ni = 2 + 60i. Go-
ing back to (3.15′) we can therefore state that a coincidence occurs only if gcd(k,h) 
is a factor of p, and if there is a coincidence, then multiple coincidences will occur 
periodically with a period equal to lcm(k,h). The fraction of time C, called the co-
incidence fraction, for which the two pulse trains coincide is:

(3.16) 
where Tp = lcm(TE,ΤR)is the coincidence period of the two windows.
As for the evaluation of the POI, we are interested in examining the coincidence 
fraction C over long periods of time. So we can consider without loss of exactness 
the phase Τx between two pulse trains as Τx = 0 (e.g., by selecting the reference time 
as the one of the first coincidence). 
The case of different window durations τE ≠ τR can be deduced from the previ-
ous simple case by defining a unit window duration such that:

and considering the two original windows as decoupled respectively into α and β

fore, we now have to consider the coincidence fraction c by exhaustively examining 
αβ pairs of elementary pulse trains and counting the number of such pairs that have 
coincidences within the period Tp.

Reference [2] also treats the case of triple pulse train coincidences as if it is 
the case of an EW sensor (ELINT) searching for a scanning radar by means of a 
high gain antenna, rotating at high speed, connected to a stepped frequency scan 
receiver.
To achieve a reliable POI with pulse trains providing small coincidence frac-
tions, it is intuitive that it is necessary to use an observation period that lasts for 
many Tp. A good approximation for the evaluation of POI versus observation time 
(although not strictly valid for periodic pulse trains as reported above) can be de-
duced according to [2] with the following assumptions:
•• The probability of a coincidence p(t) is independent from one time to the 
next.
•• The probability of a coincidence at time t + Δt [i.e., p(t + Δt)] is increased with 
respect to p(t) by the ratio of the increment in time Δt to the mean period 
between coincidences Tp, that is:

	 which has a solution of the type p(t) = A + Be –αt, where the constants A, B, 
and α can be evaluated from the boundary conditions as follows:
•• p(0) = A + B = C as at any instant of time and thus also at t = 0 the probability 
of coincidence is equal to C.
•• p(∞) = 1 = A; that is, after a long time the probability of coincidence should 
approach unity and consequently B = C – 1.
•• Further by substituting (3.21′) into (3.21), we have α = 1/ Tp.

As mentioned earlier, this equation is only approximately correct for the case 
of perfectly periodic pulse trains as the coincidences occur either periodically at 
multiples of Tp or not at all and in particular for them p(Tp) = 1, while (3.22) gives 
~0.63 for small C.
Equation (3.22) allows us to determine in many practical cases (where perfect 
periodic pulse trains are not present) the time required to achieve a specified value 
of POI as a function of the coincidence fraction c. This time, when a POI = 90% is 
specified, is also called the time to intercept (TOI). Indeed by expressing (3.22) in

Plots of (3.23) as a function of c are reported in [2].
To provide insight into the theory discussed, let us work out two numerical 
examples of POI evaluation.
Example 1: An EW sensor with a WB antenna (so that it is not necessary to 
search in azimuth) and a very fast stepped scan frequency receiver able to cover a 
1,000 MHz bandwidth in search steps of 100 MHz at a 10-ms duration is used to 
intercept a surveillance radar with an antenna of 2° azimuth beamwidth rotating 
at 10 revolutions per minute (rpm). The EW sensor pulse train is characterized by 
	
τE = 10 ms and TE = (1000 MHz/100 MHz) 10 ms = 0.1 sec 
while the surveillance radar is characterized by
	
TR = 6 sec and τR = (2°/360°) 6 sec = 0.033 sec = 33.3 ms
In accordance with (3.18) to (3.20) we have the coincidence fraction 
	C(TE,ΤR) = τRτE/( TEΤR) = (0.0333 × 0.01)/(0.1 × 6) = 0.55 × 10–3

174 
�����������������������������������對������
Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
the mean period between coincidences
	
Tp = TEΤR / (τR + τE) = (0.1 × 6)/(0.0333 + 0.01) = 13.86 sec
and the average duration of the coincidences is
	
τP = τRτE/ (τR + τE) = (33.3 × 10 × 10–3)/(33.3 + 10) = 7.7 ms
and from (3.23) we get that the TOI = 2.3Tp = 31.9 sec.
If the EW sensor receiver above had a lower frequency step, such as 10 MHz, 
its pulse train would be characterized by τE = 10 ms and T′E = (1000 MHz/10 
MHz) 10 ms = 1 sec, so that C′= 0.55 × 10–4; T′p = 138.6 sdc; τP = 7.7 ms; and TOI′ 
= 2.3T′p = 319 sec.
Example 2: An EW sensor with a WB receiver (so that it is not necessary to 
search in frequency) and with a narrow azimuth beamwidth of 1°, rotating at 60 
rpm, is used to intercept a surveillance radar with an antenna of 2° azimuth beam-
width rotating at 10 rpms. The EW sensor pulse train is characterized by 
TE = 1 sec and τE = (1°/360°) TE = 2.8 ms
while the surveillance radar is characterized by 
TR = 6 sec and τR = (2°/360°) 6 sec = 0.033 sec = 33.3 ms
In accordance with (3.18) to (3.20), we have the coincidence fraction 
C(TE,ΤR) = τRτE/( TEΤR) = (0.0333 × 0.0028)/(1 × 6) = 9.2 × 10–5
the mean period between coincidences 
Tp = TEΤR / (τR + τE) = (1 × 6)/(0.0333 + 0.0028) = 167.6 sec
and the average duration of the coincidences is 
τP = τRτE/ (τR + τE) = (33.3 × 2.8 × 10–3)/(33.3 + 2.8) = 2.6 ms
and from (3.23) we get that the TOI = 2.3Tp = 385.5 sec.
From example 1 we can deduce that the parameters of a stepped scan receiver 
have a large impact on the EW sensor reaction time (that is, the time employed by 
the sensor to declare that it has detected a scanning threat). To reduce the employed 
time to the reaction times usually required by military services (TOI on the order 
of 2 to 5 ARP), receivers are designed and developed with a larger overall receiver 
bandwidth and are capable of searching with large frequency steps at very fast 
stepped scan speeds.
In practical equipment a number of frequency scan strategies, which have an 
impact on the sensor architecture, can be exploited to reduce the TOI to the re-
quired values. A strategy used in receivers that exploit fixed frequency steps within 
the entire RF bandwidth consists of performing a couple of fast stepped frequency 

3.5  EW Radar Band Sensor Architectures 
175
scans over the entire required RF bandwidth and, after having intercepted all of 
the steady (i.e., nonscanning) emitters, then performing slower stepped frequency 
scans, but allocating within each dwell time at a frequency step a small fraction 
of the dwell time to visit the bandwidths where, in accordance with pre-mission 
information, a scanning radar emitter may be present. The fraction of dwell time 
required is limited to a couple of PRI of the possible emitter and is sufficient to as-
sess the presence of the main beam of the emitter.
Upon this detection the receiver dynamically reprograms its stepped frequency 
scan strategy in order to allocate a longer dwell time at the emitter frequency at 
about a time TR apart so as to perform complete and reliable acquisition of all of 
the emitter waveform parameters. Once this result has been achieved, the stepped 
frequency scan strategy is unchanged until a new detected scanning emitter requires 
further reprogramming.
Of course, any stepped frequency scan strategy is effective if the assumptions at 
its base are valid and verified through many runs of simulated scenarios mimicking 
the real expected ones. It is recommended that a sensor architecture be adopted 
that can support an adaptive frequency scan strategy that is capable of coping with 
the dynamic changes of the scenario and providing high POI on all the emitters 
present in the environment.

3.5.1  Architecture of Past Generation Intercept Receivers
In the EW domain five basic configurations for intercept receivers were used in the 
past to cover the required wide radar threat frequency band. Those configurations 
are listed here in decreasing order of diffusion:
1.	 Crystal video receiver (CVR), either WO or WB channelized;
2.	 Superheterodyne receiver (SHR), either swept NB or swept WB;
3.	 Channelized receiver (CHR), where the required WB frequency coverage is 
divided into a large number of high dynamic range NB receiver channels;
4.	 Transform receivers (TR), such as microscan, Bragg cells, or compressive 
receivers;
5.	 Cued receivers, which are hybrids of the previous configurations.
In all of the WB receiver configurations, an IFM receiver (see next section) is 
employed to provide the signal carrier frequency data to the EW sensor.
In this section the above listed frequency receiver configurations are assessed 
in terms of:
•• Instantaneous bandwidth coverage,
•• Sensitivity,
•• Handling of simultaneous signals,
•• Dynamic range,
•• Instantaneous signal parameter measurements and relevant accuracies,

176

Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
•• Configuration complexity.
The assessment summary of the above configurations is reported on in Table 
3.1.
3.5.1.1  The Instantaneous Frequency Measurement Receiver
The IFM receiver had an important role in the EW equipment of the past generation 
and is still applied in current generation equipment, although the tendency is to re-
place it with a digital receiver (DRx). The IFM receiver concept can be understood 
from looking at Figure 3.7.
The RF input si(t) = A cos(ωt), where ω = 2πf and f is the instantaneous fre-
quency carrier, is hard-limit amplified and then split in two equal amplitude sig-
nals, one of which is delayed with respect to the other through a delay line of length 
, which provides a time delay τ = /cp (cp is the EM wave propagation speed in the 
delay line medium). The two signals are then applied to a phase detector network 
(composed of a phase correlator, four diode detectors and two differential ampli-
fiers [4]).
The signal amplitudes at the output of the network can be shown to be:

which can be represented in a xy plane as the two components of a vector of ampli-
tude B and angle j = ωτ with respect to the x-axis. Because τ is a constant, the angle 
j is a measure of the signal carrier frequency f

The bandwidth BW of the IFM device is limited by the length  of the delay 
line; in fact, the bandwidth is determined by 
	
(ωmax – ωmin) τ = 2π or BW = fmax – fmin = 1/τ = cp/	
The frequency measurement accuracy is dependent on the time delay τ as can 
be shown by taking the derivative of (3.24):

(3.25)
in which Δj is the phase measurement accuracy, which is dependent on the phase 
correlator design and usually about 10 degrees. Because, however, τ is selected small 
to achieve a large BW, the frequency accuracy Δf becomes very broad. 
Good frequency measurement accuracy is obtained by using in parallel several 
phase correlators, each with time delay τn larger than the multiple of the time delay 
τ1, which is selected to achieve a large BW. The most used configuration is the har-
monic configuration where the time delays τn are 2n–1 multiples of the time delay 
τ1. Usually up to four time delays are selected, whereas the shorter time delays are 
used to resolve the frequency measurement ambiguities and the largest time delay 
τ4 = 8τ1 provides the fine frequency measurement accuracy Δf4 = Δf1/8.
Of course, the largest usable time delay must be shorter than the minimum PW 
that the equipment is required to measure, otherwise the delayed and undelayed 
portions of the minimum PW signal will never overlap within the phase correlator 
with the largest time delay. 
The functional block diagram of the harmonic IFM configuration and its op-
erational characteristics are given in Figures 3.8 and 3.9, respectively.
In the above-mentioned configuration, the higher the number of bits a correla-
tor generates in the frequency measurement, the higher the required SNR, as the 
increased quantization of the signals cos(ωτ) and sin(ωτ) encompasses small quan-
tized amplitude steps, which can be affected by noise.
The usual frequency measurement accuracy of octave bandwidth multiple cor-
relator IFM receivers is on the order of 2 to 10 MHz (in accordance with the fre-
quency band).
The IFM receiver provides good signal sorting in low-density signal environ-
ments and can handle wideband modulation if high-speed sampling of the output 
signal is applied. Its major disadvantage is its limited dynamic range, which pro-
duces a confused frequency measurement in the case of overlapping pulses of dif-
ferent amplitudes and frequencies, as shown in Figure 3.10.

The evaluation of the IFM frequency measurement error in the case of overlap-
ping signals is derived in a straightforward manner from (3.24) by considering that 
amplitude limiting does not affect the phases of the two input signal phasors, which 
are respectively:
 
α1 = 2πf1τ
and

α2 = 2πf2τ
The resultant phasor, the sum of the two input phasors, has a phase α = 2πfτ, 
which can be derived by inspection of Figure 3.10. The resultant phasor has the 
following coordinates in the xy plane: 
	
cos α = (A1/A2) cos α1 + cos α2
	
sin α = (A1/A2) sin α1 + sin α2
Therefore, 
 
α = tan–1(((A1/A2) sin α1 + sin α2 )/((A1/A2) cos α1 + cos α2))	
and 
	
f = (tan–1 α)/(2πτ )	
3.5.1.2  Crystal Video Receivers 
CVRs are the most common past generation EW receiver. They are used primar-
ily in RWR equipment because they cover either a WB, such as the I- or J-band or 
both of them, or the complete RF radar threat band ranging from the D- to J- or 
Ka-band. In this latter case they are defined as wide-open receivers.
Old CVRs were characterized by low sensitivity, adequate to provide RAF for 
a high ERP threat emitter mainlobe. In the early time of electronic warfare, the en-
vironment was characterized by few low-duty threat emitters transmitting pulses at 
audio band PRF, so the emitter was recognized or identified by its pulse train PRF. 
Figure 3.10  IFM measured frequency vs. amplitude ratio A1/A2 (dB) for the case of overlapping 
pulse signals.

Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
Threat emitter PRF was reported as an audio alarm to the pilot’s earphones. With 
the increasing number and technological evolution of threats in more recent times, 
threat carrier frequency became essential to provide threat identification. Current 
generation CVRs show both a higher sensitivity due to the addition of an amplifier 
in front of the detector and a frequency measurement ability due to the addition of 
an IFM receiver.
The block diagrams of a modern WO CVR used as RWR equipment and of a 
WB CVR used as medium-class ESM equipment are shown in Figure 3.11.
The CVRs can measure the following signal (pulse) instantaneous parameters:
•• Pulse amplitude (A),
•• Pulse width (PW),
•• Direction of arrival (DOA),
•• Time of arrival (TOA),
•• Frequency (F).
Because the CVR is small, usually it is installed very close to the antenna in the 
DOA channel.
Because the video amplifiers following the detector are usually ac coupled (to 
avoid bias levels) a detected CW signal would produce a dc voltage that will be not 
passed by those amplifiers. A common solution to detect CW signals is to add an 
amplitude on/off RF modulator in front of the detector that, when activated, pro-
duces pulsed video signals of long PWs that pass through the ac-coupled amplifiers. 
The associated processor provides emitter deinterleaving and sorting and com-
putes through the collection of emitter streams of pulses the following further pa-
rameters of the emitter:

•• ASP and its behavior along time (AST),
•• Frequency behavior along time (frequency type).
Typical performance for a WO CVR and a WB CVR plus IFM receiver is re-
ported in Table 3.2.
3.5.1.3  Scanning Superheterodyne Receiver
The SH receiver is the most commonly used receiver in communications and radar 
equipment for its high sensitivity and frequency selectivity. In EW applications, NB 
SHs are used primarily in ELINT equipment to isolate an emitter signal from the 
environment and measure its fine-grain information without any interfering signal, 
whereas large band (LB) scanning SHs are used to search for and detect threat emit-
ters in highly dense pulse scenarios because their selectivity strongly reduces the 
received pulse density.
Current SH receivers use a digitally controlled preprogrammed (in accordance 
with mission data) scanning strategy over a number of bandwidths across the RF 
coverage (the bandwidths may also be adjacent so as to cover the required RF cov-
erage). Usually the dwell time in a bandwidth is longer in dense threat bandwidths 
and shorter in bandwidths where there are few threats.
SHs are characterized by a high sensitivity (due to its reduced instantaneous RF 
bandwidth with respect to the CVR one) but, because they are time multiplexed, 
they have intercept limitations on the scanning emitters, unless appropriate scan 
dynamic programming is applied.
The schematic block diagram of a NB and of a LB SH is depicted respectively 
in Figures 3.12 and Figure 3.13.
3.5.1.4  Channelized Receivers
This receiver architecture covers the required RF bandwidth through a number of 
parallel contiguous channels, which have an elementary bandwidth that roughly 
matches the expected threat emitter spectrum (order of magnitude from 50 up to 
200 MHz). Each channel is provided with all of the instantaneous pulse signal pa-
rameter measurement devices.

This architecture is very complex and bulky, thus it has been used only on 
ground-based and large transport aircraft ELINT equipment [1]. The important 
advantage of this architecture is its ability to handle multiple simultaneous threat 
signals that overlap in time (as is the case in highly dense RF band segments) and 
produce the poor performance of IFM devices. This situation is depicted in Figure 
3.14, in which two simultaneous signals fall in separate high dynamic channels and

are accurately processed. Accurate processing occurs even if the signals fall in two 
adjacent channels, thanks to the very sharp bandwidth roll-off of each channel.
Practical configurations of the channelized architecture (in terms of reduced 
complexity and volume) were implemented by exploiting SAW filter channeliza-
tion at the IF output of a WB SHR, to be used in the dwells at very crowded RF 
band segments along the frequency sweep to cover the complete required frequency 
coverage.
3.5.1.5  Transform Intercept Receivers
This type of receiver, which was implemented with various technologies (such as 
Bragg cells or microscan compressive receivers), approximates the operation of a 
Fourier transform. The Bragg cell receiver, which is depicted in Figure 3.15, exploits 
the acousto-optical characteristics of some materials, such as a crystal of lithium 
niobate (LiNb). In these crystals an incident beam of coherent light is generated by 
a laser source. Upon interaction with a sound wave, while traveling transverse to 
the light beam generated by a piezoelectric transducer fed by the input IF signal, it 
is deflected at an angle proportional to the input IF.
The underlying physical principle is as follows: The sound wave, which propa-
gates in the LiNb crystal at a very short wavelength λB = vB/fIF (as the propagation 
speed vB of acoustic waves in the medium is much smaller than the propagation 
speed in the air), produces a compression and rarefaction of the medium (and 
hence of its index of refraction of the light) at step λB. With the laser beam inclined 
with respect to the normal to the crystal according to the so-called “Bragg angle,” 
the diffracted light produced by the modulated (at wavelength λB) index of refrac-
tion consists of only two component beams: an undeflected (and hence useless) 
beam (called of order 0) and a deflected beam (called of order 1) by an angle β 
(proportional to fIF ) with respect to the incident laser beam.
Through a proper optical lens arrangement, the deflected beam is focused in its 
focal plane, where a number of adjacent CCD photodetectors are placed and for

nelized receiver.

which the output amplitude is proportional to the power spectrum of the incom-
ing IF signal. In this respect the Bragg cell operates like an instantaneous spectrum 
analyzer in that it reproduces (according to a scale factor) the incoming IF signal 
spectrum, thus discriminating the various simultaneous emitter signals present at 
the input of the receiver.
The Bragg cell receiver had a period of great use in the 1980s, especially in 
ground applications, but its use was quickly abandoned as its performance became 
impaired by the vibration environment of mobile platforms. Typical Bragg cell re-
ceiver performance is covered in Table 3.3.
3.5.2  Architecture of New EW radar Band Sensors
The tremendous evolution of electronic high-speed digital technologies in terms of 
sample and hold (S/H) circuitry, ADC, and DSP devices has produced in all sensors 
and actuators, but particularly in EW ones, serious changes in their architecture.

These changes have provided better equipment performance and efficiency and 
have reduced volume and power consumption [5].
In the case of EW sensors, the novel device at the base of the new architecture 
is the digital receiver (DRx). A typical DRx block diagram is shown in Figure 3.16. 
The “basic” structure of a DRx is composed of the following:
•• An ADC, which provides discrete amplitude levels at discrete “time instants.”
•• A “processing engine” implemented on an application specific integrated cir-
cuit (ASIC) or field programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA has the 
advantage of being reprogrammable according not only to application needs 
but also to “mission” needs.
•• A “storage memory” for signal samples recording. This option allows off-
line software processing to performed by a processor not hosted on the DRx. 
To allow multichannel operation, the following functions are required to per-
form differential measures of phase, amplitude, and TOA: 
•• A synchronizer that aligns the samples and the processing between different 
DRx channels,
•• Some I/O devices for exchanging data.
A DRx board is shown in Figure 3.17. 
DSP operations implemented within a DRx depend on the requested applica-
tion; however, some basic techniques can be individuated. First, consider the con-
cept of IF sampling, which means that the signal is sampled not at the baseband 
but at a proper IF. As an example, given a sampling frequency RSAMP of 1 GHz, 
the frequency range 500 MHz ÷ 1000 MHz can be selected instead of the 0 ÷ 500 
MHz one. This technique is an extension of the Nyquist theorem. In fact, the actual 
sampled bandwidth is always 500 MHz, even if it is allocated above one-half of the 
sampling frequency. A proper anti-aliasing (AA) filter should be provided to select 
the interested frequency range.

The concept of operation of IF sampling is shown in Figure 3.18. The incoming 
signal is filtered in the IF bandwidth, which ranges from RSAMP/2 to RSAMP. The 
sampling creates replicas in the 0÷RSAMP/2 bandwidth, and finally the digital pro-
cessing provides the complex baseband signal, for example, composed of in-phase 
(I) and in-quadrature (Q) components. 
The main advantages of IF sampling are as follows:
•• IF sampling is performed in IF, so it saves an analog conversion stage.
•• Downconversion, carried out with digital techniques, avoids the “tradi-
tional” analog I/Q mixing, which poses heavy constraints of phase/amplitude 
matching.
•• Operation in the bandwidth RSAMP/2 to RSAMP avoids the presence of 
second order and higher harmonics within the useful bandwidth. 
The ADCs employed in IF sampling are required to not only have the ability 
to work with high sampling frequencies but also with a wide analog bandwidth 
(which leads to a small time aperture jitter) in order to simplify the IF stages. 
One of the most important techniques that is often used in modern digital 
receiver architectures is the uniform filter bank based on the discrete Fourier trans-
form (DFT), which is usually implemented by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
algorithms. The use of a uniform filter bank is very important in a number of EW 
applications. The implementation cost, which is quite high with analog devices, is 
lowered when digital processing is used. The actual implementation of a uniform

filter bank, as shown in Figure 3.19, is achieved by downsampling (by a factor 
M) and multiplexing in M parallel flows of the incoming wideband digital signal. 
Then, after proper weighting, the samples are sent to an M-point FFT. In this way 
M complex signals are obtained but just M/2 are retained since, being the real input 
signal, the first M/2 FFT outputs are the complex conjugates of the second M/2. 
The generic kth complex signal is the complex envelope of the signal having 
a bandwidth equal to RSAMP/M and centered on the frequency k × RSAMP/M.
Details on uniform filter bank implementation in digital circuits can be found in 
[3]. Advantages of this FFT-based technique are modularity and simplicity. Further, 
if a higher value of M is required, the rate at which the FFT has to be computed

decreases (is equal to RSAMP/M), which means that the clock speed can remain 
the same, while the overall complexity increases a little due to the additional stages 
needed to evaluate a longer DFT. This type of processing is most useful when a 
large bandwidth has to be monitored (ESM and RWR systems).
When the carrier frequency of a digital signal is known (together with a rough 
indication of its bandwidth), it can be demodulated with a digital downconverter 
(DDC), which acts as an analog downconverter but with the obvious advantage of 
programmability in both frequency and bandwidth. A numerically controlled LO 
and a variable-bandwidth filter are needed to do that.
The disadvantage of digital filters is their cost because they often require a large 
computational effort to actually be made by a number of multipliers, even if they 
are designed with finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR).
In contrast, the use of the so-called cascaded integrated comb (CIC) filters 
avoids all multiplications; they actually do only differences and sums combined 
with downsampling. The reader can find an interesting treatment in [3]. CIC filters 
are very useful in wideband digital processing techniques where the use of compu-
tational resources has to be minimized. They can be used together with FIR filters 
to reduce the sampling frequency as far as the filter bandwidth decreases. A CIC-
based DDC is shown in Figure 3.20.
The output of a DDC is always a complex baseband signal sampled at a given 
rate. Until now, the described processing was needed for signal filtering, either in 
the case of “surveillance” (e.g., when the signal frequency is not known and the 
full bandwidth has to be exploited) or in the case of “cueing” (e.g., when the signal 
has been detected and proper downconversion and filtering are needed in order to 
do a “fine” demodulation).
The algorithms employed in the treatment of signals can be divided into detec-
tion algorithms and parameter estimation algorithms. Both types of algorithms 
can be applied either to the signal amplitude or to its phase. Amplitude-based pro-
cessing has been traditionally adopted by EW receivers and phase processing has

became the selected solution of coherent DRx. Detection/estimation problems are 
quite easy to treat due to the availability, within the DRx, of the complex baseband 
signal. One of the most used algorithms in treating complex digital signals is the 
CORDIC (coordinate rotator digital computer). The CORDIC algorithm (see [5]) 
is a very tricky operation to do “rotations” of a complex number. The CORDIC 
is mainly used for rectangular-to-polar conversions, but it can also be used to per-
form other nonlinear operations. 
The implementation of detection algorithms has been made easy by DSP. Opti-
mum detection strategies are quite easy to implement; as an example, the detection 
scheme illustrated in Figure 3.21, is based on the likelihood function (see [3]) and 
can be summarized in a nonlinear operation (the evaluation of the likelihood func-
tion) followed by a threshold device. This approach can be easily implemented in a 
digital system when nonlinear transformation is implemented using LUTs.
Estimation algorithms are as easy to implement as are the detection algorithms: 
averages, filtering, and nonlinear operations can be easily performed via digital 
techniques, so estimation problems are well suited for digital implementations. In 
addiction, the theoretical Cramer-Rao bounds on signal parameters are achievable 
starting from discrete-time observation, as reported in [3]. DRx devices find appli-
cation in all kind of EW receivers.
The architecture of a WO Rx, based on the so-called “monobit” DRx, is shown 
in Figure 3.22. A monobit DRx employs a 1-bit ADC, which allows ultra-wideband 
sampling (on the order of tens of gigahertz). One-bit analog-to-digital conversion 
performed on an IF signal is equivalent to bandpass hard-limiting; this operation, 
well known from the literature (see [4]), does not affect the signal phase. So, after 
digital channelization (performed with the techniques described in Section 3.5.3 
above), we can extract the carrier frequency and the phase information. A monobit 
DRx has the following two main advantages with respect to traditional IFM:
•• The device cost is much lower with respect to an analog IFM, which involves 
state-of-the-art RF technology and usually has to cover the 0.5- to 18-GHz 
bandwidth.

•• Phase resolution may be better than with analog IFM, so phase processing 
can easily detect modulation-on-pulse (MOP) as Barker or Frank codes and, 
in general, PSK modulations. 
The architecture of an ESM SH receiver that uses digital technology is depicted 
in Figure 3.23. A variable LO sweeps the overall RF bandwidth. The IF bandwidth 
is channelized with digital techniques so as to allow multiple emitter processing. 
To show the capability of a DRx-based ESM, a scenario with three simultaneous 
pulsed emitters is shown in Figure 3.24. An oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer pro-
vides, respectively, only time- or frequency-domain representation.
A SH DRx provides, thanks to digital channelization, a time-frequency repre-
sentation, as depicted in Figure 3.25 since: 
•• The complex of digital channels, all taken at the same time lag, provides a 
frequency description. 
•• Each channel output, along the sequential time lags, gives the time history of 
signals present in its spectrum portion. 
A fully digital implementation of an ELINT receiver is shown in Figure 3.26.
The aim of a detection function is to start the fine analysis on the selected 
signal. To this purpose, signal recognition must be performed in the detection func-
tion. The detection can be performed either after channelization or before, depend-
ing on the traffic level and/or the required sensitivity (taking into account that the 
ELINT receiver can have a very high sensitivity).

Once the detection has occurred a coarse frequency should be provided to 
LO2 (numerically controlled) in order to extract the selected signal. The analysis 
performed in the last block of Figure 3.27 typically provides the following data:
•• Distribution of received pulses within a time frame, 
•• PRI and PRF agility data, 
•• Modulation on pulse (MOP) analysis,
•• Unwanted modulation on pulse (UMOP) analysis. 
All of these data are stored in order to recognize the class of the radar or even 
the specific radar (UMOP analysis). The block diagram of a double-channel SH

receiver is shown in Figure 3.27. The double-channel architecture is fundamen-
tal for differential measurements: they can be carried out in amplitude, phase, or 
time, depending on the application, as will be discussed in Chapter 4, relevant to 
direction-finding techniques.
3.5.3  DSP Technologies 
The development of digital receivers is strictly related to semiconductor technology. 
Actually the choice between a digital receiver and a Bragg cell receivers (see Appen-
dix A) was driven by the improvement of semiconductor technology. Technology 
made available some characteristics of the key component; mainly ADC and FPGA, 
which allows high-performance DRxs to be built. These characteristics are: 
•• High-speed sampling,
•• Large bandwidth and spectral purity of the ADC,
•• High-speed systolic processing with large computation resources (FPGA),

•• High-speed connectivity.
In the following discussion we refer mainly to the channelized SH receiver be-
cause it is the most demanding.
The maximum sampling frequency is the main characteristic of the ADC. It is 
directly related to the DRx theoretical bandwidth that is one-half of the sampling 
frequency. As shown in the previous section, the bandwidth of a DRx with a sam-
pling frequency RSAMP is RSAMP/2. This band can be allocated not only from 0 
to RSAMP /2 (baseband), but from RSAMP to 1.5 RSAMP, and so on. 
To select the band, a filter is required. This filter (the antialiasing filter) re-
duces the DRx bandwidth; in fact, its transition bandwidth should be deducted 
from RSAMP/2. Usually the transition bandwidth is 10% of the cutting frequen-
cy, which means that if a DRx works with a maximum input frequency of fs, its 
bandwidth will be 40% of fs; if, however, the RDx works up to 2 RSAMP, its ban-
dwidth will be 30%.
Other limitations to the high-frequency operations come from the input stage 
of the ADC. This stage amplifies the input signal and holds it during the conversion 
process. The requirements of this section are:
•• Large analog bandwidth,
•• Flatness, 
•• Spectral purity.
The first two items influence the maximum input frequency of the DRx, where-
as the third one restricts the dynamic range. 
A high input frequency is preferable for two reasons: (1) to increase the band-
width of the DRx and (2) to sample the signal directly in IF or even in RF, thus 
simplifying the microwave section. At present the performances of the ADC allow 
a DRx bandwidth of almost 1 GHz to be reached; with a dynamic range of 40 to 
50 dB, the input bandwidth could be allocated from RSAMP/2 to RSAMP.
In the following an example of ADC will be given. The device is the e2v 
AT84AS004 shown in Figure 3.28. It contains not only a 10-bit flash converter

with maximum sampling frequency of 2 GHz, but also a demultiplexer (DEMUX) 
that reduces the speed of the samples in order to allow a connection with the FP-
GAs that are usually employed to perform the signal processing.
Figure 3.29 plots the performance of a typical ADC. The first plot of Figure 
3.29(a) shows the flatness of the device. Note that the analog bandwidth is 3 GHz 
and the flatness from 1 to 2 GHz is almost 1 dB. The effective number of bits 
(ENOB) vs. the input frequency is shown in Figure 3.29(b): the ENOB in the band 
from RSAMP /2 to RSAMP is better than 7 bits. Figure 3.29(c) shows the spurious 
free dynamic range (SFDR) vs. the input frequency. This parameter evaluates the 
spectral purity of the device; it is the ratio between the signal power and the high-
est spurii at the output of the ADC. The SFDR gives an upper bound to the DRx 
dynamic range; in fact, the minimum detectable signal should be above the spurii 
level in order to avoid false alarms. The plot shows that the SFDR is always around 
55 dB, and, taking into account a safety margin of 5 or 10 dB, a dynamic range of 
45 to 50 dB can be reached. 
Also a monobit ADC could be characterized by its analog bandwidth and its 
sampling frequency. At present, these devices can sample at a maximum rate of 
10 to 12 GHz. Thus, they have a maximum bandwidth of <6 GHz. A number of 
monobit DRxs are used in parallel with proper clock shifts in order to cover the 
required band from 2 to 18 GHz.
The vast success of the DRx is due to the improvement of the processing devices 
used in its architecture. Indeed, the data rate produced by the ADC is not manage-
able by any general-purpose DSP, so ad hoc processors have been developed. Two 
possible HW platforms are available for these processors: the ASIC and the FPGA. 
The main differences between them are the speed and the programmability. The 
ASIC can reach higher processing speeds than the FPGA, but the FPGA is repro-
grammable. With respect to costs, the ASIC has a big nonrecurring cost, whereas 
the FPGA shows a higher recurring cost (cost per unit). The choice between the two 
HW platforms depends on a number of factors:
•• The number of receivers to be built, 
•• The need to reprogram the device,
•• The required processing speed. 
In the following discussion, we refer mainly to the evolution of the FPGA but 
we expect that the performance trends of both the FPGA and ASIC will be similar.

The three items that distinguish a processing device are:
•• Computational power,
•• Memory,
•• Connectivity.
The FPGAs are substantially systolic devices, which means that they are com-
posed of a number of simple elements (cells) that can be configured and connected 
to obtain a complex net. The characteristics of these devices are:
•• Number of cells,
•• Complexity and processing speed,
•• Connections between them.
Moreover the latest families of FPGAs contain embedded special functions 
(called DSPs or MACs) that are mainly composed of multipliers and adders. These 
functions allow FIR filters, correlators, and so on, to be built. The introduction of 
these functions within the FPGAs have specialized these devices in signal process-
ing. Both cells and embedded special functions contribute to the computational 
power of the FPGA.
The DRx memory can be used as computational element (LUT) or as memory 
to store data and parameters. The connectivity between different devices (even if on 
different boards) can be performed via high-speed serial transceivers. The new sili-
con technologies increase the density of the FPGA and consequently increase both 
the memory and the computational power. The connectivity improves the preced-
ing characteristics by increasing the speed of the serial transceiver (up to 6.5 Gbps).
At present, the Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA can contain one complete channelized 
DRx with 1 GHz of bandwidth. The new Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA family improves 
on that performance by a factor of 3 (based on a comparison between the V5 SX95 
and the V6 SX315; see Figure 3.30).

•• To improve the signal processing algorithms in order to enhance DRx perfor-
mance in terms of sensitivity, number, and accuracy of measurements (e.g., 
frequency resolution). 
•• To increase the storage capacity in order to record signals to be subsequently 
analyzed.
•• To use the connectivity improvements to communicate among several 
DRx channels in order to enhance direction-finding (angular estimation) 
techniques.
In conclusion, the silicon devices are constantly improving and this in turn in-
creases the DRx bandwidth, sensitivity, and signal parameter measurement accuracies, 
providing a large improvement in the performance of next-generation EW equipment.
3.6  Detection and Classification of LPI Radars
 LPI radars are characterized by [6]:
•• Very low transmitted power,
•• Low sidelobe antennas,
•• Transmitted waveforms spread over a wide frequency BW and over long time 
intervals (long pulses or even CW-type transmissions),
•• Coherent integration processing on reception of a high number of pulses or 
time intervals. 
Many WB modulation techniques are currently available that provide LPI 
waveforms, such as:
•• Linear (i.e., chirp) and nonlinear frequency modulation (LFM-NLFM);
•• Discrete phase coding modulations (PSK) such as generalized Barker codes, 
Frank codes (which provide a good stepwise approximation of LFM), poly-
phase codes and polytime codes;
•• FH modulations such as the Costas codes;
•• PN waveforms.
We recommend the interested reader refer to [6] for more insight into the struc-
ture of these modulation techniques.
The classical filtering method widely adopted in current ESM DRxs is based on 
FFT processing (as shown in Section 3.5). This approach, which provides excellent 
detection performance in the case of nonmodulated or limited BW (i.e., BW nar-
rower than the FFT frequency bin size Bn) modulated pulses, is no longer effective 
in case of large BW modulated pulses (BW > Bn) and thus more sophisticated filter-
ing procedures are needed.
Two distinct signal processing approaches are relevant to either the case where 
we simply need to detect the presence of an LPI radar signal in the environment 
or the case where we also need to classify the emitter by measuring its parameters

(for ELINT or analyses to select the best jamming program to counter that emit-
ter). Obviously the two approaches can be used in sequence in highly sophisticated 
ESM equipment.
To detect only LPI radar signals, a cross-correlation technique can be used [7] 
that provides the processing gain PG = SNRout/SNRin at the output of the receiver 
scheme shown in Figure 3.31.

ted for the following LPI PSK signals:

•• CW signal obtained by repeating a Barker 13 (implemented with B-PSK mod-
ulation) with Tchip = 100 ns and repetition period equal to 1.3 μs. 
•• CW signal obtained by repeating Frank 64 (8-PSK modulation) with Tchip = 
100 ns and repetition period equal to 6.4 μs. 
The following parameters are used for cross-correlator processing:
•• Bn = 80 MHz  TC = 12.5 ns. 
•• NCORR = 800  TCORR = 10 μs. 
•• SNRin (which represents the SNR at the output of the channelizer, e.g., over 
Bn = 80 MHz) ranging from –20 dB up to 30 dB).

For the classification of the LPI radar signals, several filtering methods are 
available in the literature and have been analyzed in [6] and [8], such as :
•• Filtering methods based on the cyclostationary signal properties such as the 
FFT accumulation method (FAM), for which the processing block diagram 
is shown in Figure 3.33.
•• Strip spectral correlation analysis (SSCA), for which the processing block

the quadrature mirror filter (QMF), for which the processing block diagram 
is shown in Figure 3.35.

The output of the methods above are matrices, and each method is peculiarly 
effective with respect to some LPI waveform. A comparison of the detection ef-
fectiveness of the above processing methods with respect to three different LPI 
waveforms (LFM, Frank code, and Costas code) was performed in [8], where the 
probability of detection was further maximized by applying a noncoherent inte-
gration of N maximum detection outputs (NIMD) for each filtering method.  The 
relevant results are herewith reported (by permission of the authors) in Figures

waveforms.
A word of caution must be mentioned in that the above-quoted results were 
evaluated in the absence of any interfering signals, a circumstance that never hap-
pens in real environments. Therefore, the methods must discussed have to be ap-
plied in conjunction with interference mitigating procedures (e.g., narrow beam 
spatial selectivity or adaptive beam pattern nulling).
Finally, a recommendation from Section 12.2 of [6] should be mentioned here: 
In terms of the classification of the LPI waveforms, that classification should be 
performed by employing in parallel a number of methods each followed by its own 
neural network (NN) that is trained to recognize the signal modulation among the 
numerous LPI modulations through the time-frequency or bifrequency images.
3.7  Emitter Deinterleaving and Sorting
Current EM scenarios are constituted by a very dense and complex mixture of dif-
ferent types of simultaneous signals, for which the amplitude and frequency are 
distributed over very wide ranges of values as shown in Figure 3.40. As soon as 
an emitter signal (usually a pulse) is detected, a number of its instantaneous pa-
rameters are measured and transformed into digital words in order to form a pulse 
descriptor message (PDM), which will be used within the sensor processor for the 
deinterleaving process, a process constituted by knowledge-based algorithms run-
ning on high-speed digital hardware, which discriminates and groups the PDMs of 
the pulses belonging to the same emitter, as received within a time frame TF, thus

extracting them from the PDMs received by the other emitters. In earlier sensor gen-
erations, this process performed by specialized digital processing boards capable of 
high processing speeds, but currently it is performed by common processor boards, 
due to the availability of high processing speeds and throughput with these boards.
The instantaneous pulse parameters usually employed for deinterleaving are as 
follows:
•• Amplitude (A),
•• Direction of arrival (DOA, usually only azimuth),
•• Carrier frequency (FREQ),
•• Time of arrival (TOA, usually the time at which a pulse detection occurs),
and for sophisticated deinterleaving also:
•• Pulse width (PW),
•• Modulation on pulse [MOP, an indication that can be either the simple pres-
ence of a modulation within the pulse or the very type of the modulation 
(phase or frequency)].
The deinterleaving process operates on all of the PDMs received within TF by 
producing tri-dimensional histograms along the DOA, FREQ, and PW axes (see 
Figure 3.41). PDMs grouped within a cell, which has dimensions that are related to 
the pulse instantaneous parameter measurement accuracies of the sensor, are likely 
to belong to the same emitter. To take into account the possible frequency agility of 
the emitter, a rapid check is usually performed on equal DOA and PW and different 
TOA in order to add the relevant PDM to the cell.

The PDMs associated with a cell are further checked according to MOP (oth-
erwise they are discarded from the cell) and then ordered, according to increasing 
TOA, to determine the PRI and the PRI law of the emitter by using various algo-
rithms appropriate to each known PRI law. Sometimes, if available from the EW 
platform mission data, templates of the PRI law of known emitters are compared 
with the TOA ordered PDM file of the cells in order to determine the matching to 
known emitters. This above-described process is called emitter sorting, because it 
provides at its completion a list of potential emitters detected within TF.
Both of the processes just described are as much as possible independent of 
intelligence data and make intensive use of clustering algorithms on all received 
PDMs, using all of the signal parameters provided by the receiver architecture 
(DOA, RF, PW, PRI, MOP) in order to deinterleave and sort both known as well 
as unknown emitters. 
At the completion of the emitter sorting process relevant to a time frame, a 
synthetic emitter file is provided to the EW processor, which updates its track file 
of previously sorted emitters with fresh emitter data and introduces new emitter en-
tries in the track file. The emitter track file is then compared with the data available 
in the emitter mission library in order to perform the identification of the emitter 
mode and then associate it with the relevant weapons system.
A schematic block diagram of the pulse deinterleaving and emitter sorting pro-
cesses is shown in Figure 3.42.
3.8  Emitter Identification
After an emitter has been sorted and reported in the active emitter file (AEF) of the 
ESM system, it has to be compared with the emitter data recorded in the library 
(relevant to known emitters) in order to determine its most likely identity. As men-
tioned in the previous section, a sorted emitter is reported in the AEF with a set of 
measured data, including the four measured primary parameters (RF, PRI, PW, and 
ASP) and relevant notations
•• RF notations: FIX, HOP, BST, SLD, AGL, CPX, and so on;
•• PW notations: FIX, HOP, BST, SLD, AGL, CPX, and so on;
•• PRI notations: FIX, STG, SWT, JIT, SLD, COD, CPX;

and the emitter secondary parameters, relevant to the presence of MOP, and rel-
evant notations, which are:
•• FMOP: CHIRP, SAW, TRI, SIN, and so on;
•• PMOP: BARKER, FRANK, UNK;
•• AMOP.
The comparison of each of these parameters is performed with the correspond-
ing parameter of each likely recorded emitter of the library. Likely recorded emit-
ters are those that have passed through a frequency filter (which rejects all of the 
recorded emitters outside the frequency carrier interval of the measured emitter) 
and the notation filter (which rejects all of the recorded emitters that have nota-
tions different from the corresponding ones of the sorted emitter). This comparison 
produces for each primary and secondary emitter parameter, which we will generi-
cally designate as i, a score, called Scorei,j, relevant to the corresponding parameter 
of the j recorded emitter of the list of likely recorded emitters. 
Scorei,j is evaluated as the percentage overlap between the measured parameter 
interval and the corresponding parameter interval of the recorded emitter, incre-
mented by the parameter measurement accuracy of the actual receiver. As an ex-
ample, let us consider the parameter PRI and assume that:
•• The sorted emitter measured PRI interval is IPRI (IPRI = PRImax – PRImin). 
••  The j recorded emitter PRI interval is LPRI,j. 
•• The measurement PRI accuracy of the receiver is ΔPRI. 
The PRI parameter score of the j recorded emitter is therefore:

which achieves the maximum total score. This identification process is depicted in 
Figure 3.43.

3.9  Communications ESM
Today’s military operations are characterized by the need for robust and secure 
communications networks that can transfer multimedia information in real time 
to fixed and mobile stations, thus providing all the elements of the network with a 
capillary fast command chain and an updated complete situation awareness. 
Communications intercept systems are termed CESM (communications ESM) 
if they have to provide quickly emitter signal information to combat troops or 
COMINT (communications intelligence) if they have to analyze the signals over an 
extended period of time in order to provide intelligence on the emission character-
istics and contents.
The tasks of CESM equipment are the search for, interception of, classification 
of, identification of, and direction finding of communications signals in the sur-
rounding environment in order to activate further EW operations (such as emitter 
location, signal analysis, or jamming of the relevant network). These tasks are 
made difficult by the presence of a multitude of friendly and civilian communica-
tions and by the adoption by modern military communications equipment of LPI 
techniques, such as SS direct synthesis of digital coded signals (mostly encrypted) 
and frequency hopping.
The tasks of COMINT equipment is to record the emitter signals for subse-
quent possible decryption of its contents and for the analysis and evaluation of its 
LPI characteristics and ECCM features in order to identify the most appropriate 
jamming techniques.
3.9.1  CESM
Communications services are virtually spread all over the RF spectrum. Table 3.4 
lists the frequency band denominations.

3.9  Communications ESM 
209
To cope with the extremely crowded communications band characterized by 
many simultaneous fixed frequencies, burst type, modern FH, and SS signals, the 
CESM equipment architecture can be implemented either with a number of wide–
bandwidth channelized receivers covering the required frequency bands or with a 
number (equal to the number of receiving antennas) of wide-bandwidth SH chan-
nelized receivers, whose band is rapidly stepwise scanned over the interested RF 
bands. This latter architecture is the most used in practice and will be described in 
the following discussion.
HF band CESM equipment, due to the large wavelength dimension in this 
band, needs very large antennas (usually an array of antennas displaced over a 
large area) in order to obtain an accurate AOA. The employed DF algorithms are 
either the Watson-Watt method with use of Adcock-type antennas [i.e., four equal 
vertical elements (monopoles) displaced at the vertexes of a square and intercon-
nected in pairs along the diagonals] or the correlative phase method (see Section 
4.3.1) reinforced with some MUSIC algorithm to solve the multipath DF ambigui-
ties [9].
Thanks to refraction by the ionosphere of the HF signal through the measure-
ment of the elevation AOA, and assuming the height of the refraction layer (D, 
E, F1, or F2) is known, it is possible to evaluate the distance of the emitter on the 
ground, thus implementing a single-site emitter location.
The architecture of the HF band CESM equipment is much similar, with the 
exception of the type and number of DF antennas and of the size of the IBW to 
be swept across the HF band, to the one of the CESM equipment operating in the 
VHF/UHF bands (30 to 3000 MHz), which is illustrated in Figure 3.44. 
The CESM equipment is composed of the following units:
•• An antenna group, composed of a number of sub-band antenna arrays; usu-
ally three sub-bands are used such as 30 to 300 MHz, 300 to 1000 MHz, and 
1000 to 3000 MHz;
•• Antenna front-end receiver and sub-band antenna arrays switching matrix;
•• RF receiver;
•• Processor and interfaces;
•• Auxiliary units (HMI, databases and emitter libraries, recording devices).

Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
The CESM equipment when operating in ground sites is usually composed of 
a GPS receiver in order to provide its site geographical coordinates and to be syn-
chronized with the other CESM sensors of the emitter location network (see also 
Section 4.5). 
The employed DF method is usually the correlative DF method (as reported in 
Section 4.3.1) as applied to the sub-band uniform circular arrays (UCAs) with an 
odd number of vertical dipoles (to reduce the number of phase measurement ambi-
guities due to harmonic frequencies and thus increase the measurement bandwidth 
of each sub-band array). Typical AOA accuracy is on the order of 1° to 2° rms over 
each sub-band.
In Figures 3.45 and 3.46, respectively, the principle of the correlative DF meth-
od (as reported in Section 4.3.1) and the picture of a typical CESM antenna group 
are shown.
The antenna front-end (AFE) and sub-band arrays switching matrix provide 
the equipment with  preselector filtering and first low-noise amplification of the 
received RF signals from each antenna of the UCA before they are translated to IF 
in the relevant RF receiver via mixing with a proper LO signal. In theory, it would 
be possible for the correlative phase DF measurement to use only two channels at 
a time and then switch sequentially the two RF receiver channels over the other 
pairs of antennas of the UCA. This DF scheme was used in the past to reduce the 
cost of the equipment, but the current increased FH rate of modern emitters made 
it ineffective, because monopulse DF is essential in classifying this type of emitters.
Of the various features of the analog part of the RF receiver, the important ones 
are as follows:

•• The tuning time of the synthesizer determines the stepwise sweeping speed 
of the receiver IBW (on the order of >40 MHz) over the whole frequency 
coverage bandwidth. The shorter the tuning time, the higher the probability 
of intercepting burst transmissions. Current values for this parameter are on 
the order of tens of microseconds.
•• The instantaneous dynamic range (IDR) enables discrimination of small-am-
plitude signals in the presence of very-large-amplitude signals (mostly close 
to the equipment site). Usually IDR > 60 dB.
•• The noise figure of the RF chain (from antenna to the IF input) is on the order 
of 8 to 10 dB across the frequency coverage bandwidth.

The IF signals of each receiving channel are digitally converted through a 12- 
to 14-bit ADC (in order to achieve an effective IDR > 60 dB) and processed by a 
number of FPGAs, which provide detection (uniform filter bank) and phase mea-
surement algorithms. The schematic block diagram of two adjacent (in the UCA) 
channels is shown in Figure 3.47. The figure also shows the windowing applied 
to the digital data stream to reduce the sidelobes of the subsequent FFT detection. 
The IBW is swept stepwise at high tuning speed across the required frequency 
band in order to achieve a high POI and to determine the distribution of the emit-
ters with frequency. The IBW tuning speed is controlled by the mission data, so 
that either the IBW dwell times can be increased at frequencies where FH emitters 
are envisaged (to correlate frequency detections at the same angle along the dwell 
time) or the number of frequency bins in the IBW can be increased/reduced in ac-
cordance with the envisaged signal bandwidth at some frequencies (to approximate 
the matched filter bandwidth of those signals). Figure 3.48 shows a typical steady 
IBW frequency scanning strategy.
After detection, with frequency carrier and DF measurements of the emitter 
signal, the CESM equipment has to perform signal classification to help determine 
the adversary’s EOB by indicating which type of communication equipment is in 
use.
Signal classification encompasses many types of processing, such as:
•• Signal type recognition (e.g., analog or digital);
•• Modulation recognition if analog (e.g., AM, FM, PM);
•• Type of digital signal (e.g., BPSK, QPSK);
•• Type of multiplexing (e.g., FDM, PPM).
Two algorithmic approaches can be applied to perform signal classification [4]:
1.	 Signal feature extraction followed by pattern recognition processing based 
on neural networks, which are able to discriminate among signal types;
Figure 3.47  Two DRx channels performing multichannel signal detection and differential phase measure-
ment from two antennas within the IBW equipment. 

3.9  Communications ESM 
213
2.	 The decision theoretic approach, which determines the signal type on opti-
mization of the established likelihood ratios based on statistical properties 
of the signals.
Among the signal classifiers of both approaches, here we simply cite a few 
and invite the interested reader to deepen his knowledge by reading Chapter 10 
of [4] and the relevant literature reported in its references. For pattern recognition 
processing:
•• Nandi-Azzouz classifier, which is applicable for discriminating among 13 
analog and digital modulation types: AM, FM, MFSK, MASK DSB, LSB, 
USB, MPSK, VSB, and combined (amplitude and phase) modulation. Figure 
3.49 shows the flow diagram of this classifier and Table 3.5 defines the pa-
rameters used in the figure..
•• Assaleh-Farrell-Mammone classifier, which is applicable for discriminating 
among digital modulation types.
For the decision theoretic approach:
•• Kim-Polydoros classifier, which is applicable for discriminating between 
BPSK and QPSK;
•• Sills classifier, which is applicable for discriminating among three types of 
PSK signal (BPSK, QPSK and 23PSK) and among three types of QAM signal 
(24QAM, 25QAM, and 26QAM).

The advantage of the decision theoretic approach classifiers with respect to the 
pattern recognition processing ones is the possibility of operation at lower SNR 
than >15 dB as requested by the latter ones.

Signal feature extraction, however, is required to perform identification of the 
emitter, which is accomplished in the same manner as described in Section 3.8 for 
the radar emitters: by matching each feature with the relevant ones of the likely 
emitters in the database and assigning a score to each match. The emitter that ac-
cumulates the highest total score over the emitter features is considered the emitter 
identity.
Typical emitter features to be extracted are as follows:
•• Signal classification,
•• Frequency(ies) of operation,
•• RF bandwidth,
•• Type of modulation,
•• Power level.
3.9.2  COMINT
The task of COMINT equipment in military operations is to record the content 
of the adversary’s communication systems (for subsequent listening and/or analy-
ses) to provide accurate data about their location, their signal structure, and their 
ECCM features, in order to support mission planning, which may consist of jam-
ming in order to disrupt the adversary’s command chain. Analysis of COMINT 
data is essential for the design of jamming waveforms to be transmitted and for the 
selection of the CECM equipment to be employed. The main ECCM features of the 
adversary tactical data links that the COMINT equipment has to measure for the 
FH emitters are the hop time and the hop bandwidth, and for the SS emitters, the 
processing gain.
COMINT equipment is also used in civilian applications for spectrum moni-
toring applications, such as the surveillance of proper broadcast channel widths 
and received signal quality evaluation in areas of broadcast and wireless services.
COMINT equipment is usually not provided with DF antennas covering 360° 
azimuth, so their high-gain antennas (to achieve an increased sensitivity and hence 
a higher SNR for more accurate emitter parameter measurement) are designated in 
angle by the associated CESM.
The main COMINT functions are:
•• Signal acquisition and feature extraction,
•• Signal classification,
•• Signal demodulation,
•• Voice signal demodulation and listening,
•• Signal recording,
•• Signal reproduction for fine analysis (bit-stream decoding, transmission stan-
dard recognition, and speech and speaker recognition).
The COMINT received signal processing flow is shown in Figure 3.50.

216 
�����������������������������������對������
Electronic Warfare RF Band Sensor Systems
The architecture of COMINT equipment is very similar to that of CESM 
equipment, with the 360° azimuth DF being substituted by a high-gain antenna, 
and with a large additional number of processors, recorders, and software tools to 
ease the analysis tasks performed by the operators. The block diagram of a typical 
COMINT station served by many operators is shown in Figure 3.51. This kind of 
station is able to operate in the HF band and, thus, thanks to ionospheric refrac-
tion, it can intercept and analyze communication emitters located thousands of 
nautical miles from the station. Typical operator displays showing the capabilities 
of the available software tools are pictured in Figure 3.52.
3.10  SIGINT
SIGINT (signal intelligence) is currently only a definition that refers to the combi-
nation of COMINT and ELINT activities. The current need to introduce modern 
large-bandwidth communication services pushed these to occupy large available 
spectral regions in the SHF band. In contrast, the introduction of stealth technolo-
gies applied to military platforms has pushed radar designs within the low UHF 
and VHF bands, where detection is made easier for the resonance of objects of 
comparable size to the wavelength. The mixing of communication and radar signals 
within the same bandwidth suggests the use of receiving equipment that exploits 
common antennas to feed two separate receivers, dedicated to the radar and to the 
communications signals’ interception and classification.
Figure 3.50  COMINT acquired signal processing flow.

3.11  Conclusion 
217
This new type of equipment, a real type of SIGINT equipment in that it com-
bines COMINT and ELINT tasks within an integrated piece of equipment, pres-
ents substantial advantages in military platforms such as ships and aircraft where 
reduced volumes are a premium. An example of such equipment is the ELT 819 
Airborne SIGINT equipment. Its schematic block diagram is shown in Figure 3.53.
3.11  Conclusion
In this chapter the principles of operation (interception, parameter measurement, 
and emitter classification) as well as the adopted technologies and techniques of 
modern passive (i.e., receivers) EW equipment have been described. We have shown 
how they cope with the challenges provided by the evolution of radar and com-
munications equipment transmitted waveforms, previously illustrated in Chapter 
2. No particular emphasis was given to the host platform of the described equip-
ment, although the effort in the development of these technologies was addressed 
to airborne equipment because the aircraft environment is the most demanding in 
terms of volume, power dissipation and consumption, vibration levels, and thermal 
conditions.

RF Direction-Finding and Emitter 
Location Techniques
4.1  Introduction
The information about the direction of arrival (DOA) of an emitter signal is of the 
utmost importance both from an operational aspect (i.e., in what direction with 
respect to the platform the threat is present and which evasive or engagement ma-
noeuvre the platform can perform) and from a deinterleaving and sorting aspect. 
Deinterleaving and sorting are performed by EW sensors, and DOA is the only 
stable emitter signal parameter acquired within the relatively short emitter acquisi-
tion period (time frame) of an EW sensor.
EW sensors employ many different direction-finding (DF) techniques, either 
individually or in combination with similar sensors, to achieve the required DOA 
and localization measurement accuracy. The basic concepts related to estimation 
accuracy and its lower bound, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), are discussed 
in Appendix B. Of course, regardless of the DF technique used, the choice of sensor 
antennas is fundamental to the DF function. A basic introduction to antennas and 
array of antennas is given in Appendix C.
DF techniques are classified in accordance to the interval of time in which the 
DOA information is achieved. The measurement can be either instantaneous (i.e., 
within the emitter pulse or a short sample of its waveform in the case of long wave-
forms, in which case the technique is a monopulse technique and requires more 
than one antenna) or sequential in time by means of a movement (usually a rota-
tion) of the sensor’s antenna with respect to the DOA of the signal.
The monopulse DF techniques exploit the differences of one instantaneous 
emitter parameter (such as amplitude or phase or time of arrival) as received by 
two or more antennas, whereas the sequential DF techniques usually exploit only 
the emitter signal amplitude as modulated by the movement of the single measur-
ing antenna.

RF Direction-Finding and Emitter Location Techniques
4.2  Amplitude Comparison DF Methods
In principle, the DOA of an RF signal can be determined from amplitude measure-
ments performed during scanning (usually a rotation at high speed in the azimuth 
plane) of a high-gain parabolic dish antenna with low sidelobes across the direction 
of the emitter. The signal amplitude, which is supposedly steady within the scan-
ning period ΔT of a high-gain antenna mainlobe, is modulated by the antenna pat-
tern, and the mainlobe peak determines the signal DOA. This method is depicted 
in Figure 4.1 and a photo of a typical antenna (ELT 888) is shown in Figure 4.2. 
This method can provide highly accurate DOA measurements (error <1° all over 
the 2- to 18-GHz band) by associating a RF monopulse beamformer (see later) with 
the antenna.
This method was applied with antennas scanning in both azimuth and elevation 
planes to determine bidimensional DOA measurements. Although the approach of 
a rotating antenna is conceptually simple and can provide DF accuracy on the 
order of 1°, it is inherently a low POI approach with respect to angle scanning 
emitters, so it is not widely used in ESM equipment. Currently the only application 
of this method is in ELINT equipment, in which the high antenna gain, coupled 
with a high sensitivity receiver (narrow/midband receiver), allows DOA measure-
ments at the antenna sidelobes of the scanning emitter, thus bypassing the low POI 
relevant to its mainlobe. Further, most of these types of antennas can be stopped or 
brought to the DOA of the emitter to acquire long samples of the emitter signal for 
subsequent signal analysis.
The most common approach to amplitude comparison DF is to use four low-
gain steady antennas, displaced 90° from each other, in order to provide four an-
gular quadrants of azimuth coverage. This arrangement is commonly used in most 
RWR equipment. The concept of operation is to compare the amplitudes of the 
RF emitter signal as received by each antenna. Because amplitude comparison is 
performed instantaneously, this DF method is often referred to as amplitude mono-
pulse. The arrangement of the four antennas and the relevant CVR block diagram

are shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. The antennas usually employed in 
RWR equipment are planar spiral antennas as shown in Figure 4.5. 
The gain pattern of a spiral antenna is reasonably well approximated by a 
Gaussian function, which in the azimuth plane can be expressed as:

where 
Ai is the composite antenna/receiver amplitude gain at peak. [Recall that because 
the CVR used in the scheme of Figure 4.2.4 uses square-law detectors followed by 
a lowpass filter, the amplitudes are measured as power levels (Pi = Ai
2).]
θB is the half power (–3 dB) beamwidth of the antenna pattern (usually for a 
four-antenna configuration, θB = 90° at the lower frequency end of the covered 
bandwidth).
k2 = –ln(1/2) = 0.693.
α is the “squint angle,” that is, one-half of the angle between the boresight direc-
tion of any two antennas (α = 45° in the four-antenna configuration of Figure 
4.3).
The beamwidth θB is nominally selected as 90°; however, actual antennas can 
exhibit beamwidths that vary with frequency from 110° at the lower end to 70° 
at the upper end of the bandwidth. Furthermore, the squint angle α can vary con-
siderably with frequency. Both of the above-mentioned pattern variations can sig-
nificantly affect the accuracy of wideband DF equipment. Typical spiral antenna

4.2  Amplitude Comparison DF Methods 
225
The measurement of the emitter DOA (i.e., θ) is accomplished in two steps: 
First, the two antennas that receive the strongest and the next strongest signal 
amplitudes have to be selected (P1 and P2 in Figure 4.3) and thereafter the ratio 
of these two power levels after the logarithmic amplifiers has to be evaluated. The 
ratio R (expressed in decibels) of the two power levels after the logarithmic ampli-
fiers is simply the difference between the two outputs:

Therefore, the ratio RdB between the two strongest signals is proportional to 
the emitter DOA, apart from a bias introduced by the gain mismatch of the two 
receiving channels as dependent on frequency, which has to be corrected via a LUT.

4.2  Amplitude Comparison DF Methods 
227
There are several potential sources of error in an amplitude comparison DF 
system. One significant source of error arises from the gain mismatches between 
the channels that is quickly varying with the frequency and cannot be totally com-
pensated for by a LUT, which corrects the mismatch at fixed frequency steps. Typi-
cally, the DF system is designed so that the maximum imbalance is limited to ±1 
dB. Therefore, the peak angular error for a system with θB = 90° is, from (4.5), Δθ 
= 3.75° ΔRdB = ±3.75° or σθ = 2.16° rms.
Errors are caused, as mentioned before, by the variations with frequency of the 
beamwidth and the squint angle of the antennas, but these are generally compen-
sated for with the data provided by the LUT. However the rms error due to further 
causes can be evaluated similarly as shown before, and these errors add to the one 
evaluated above.
Assuming no correlation among the various errors, the total error caused by 
variations in the antenna parameters can be expressed as:

A further important error is caused by the receiver noise present in the chan-
nels, which affects the measured signal amplitude in each channel, and can be eval-
uated by expressing the change in the ratio R of (4.2) due to amplitude variations:

SNR1 = SNR2 = ½(SNRM), where SNRM is the SNR at the antenna pattern peak, 
thus giving:

As can be seen from (4.13), the rms angular error is a function of the squint 
angle α, so it is worth knowing which α is the optimum α that gives the least an-
gular error. For a Gaussian antenna pattern, it can be shown [13] that αopt = θB/
[2(ln2) 1/2] = 0.6θB and σθmin = 0.425/(SNRM)½. As an example, in the case where 
we select α = 45°, the beamwidth should be θB = 75° and, assuming SNRM = 20 dB 
= 100, we have σθ = 3.75°.
From (4.5) we can see that by increasing the number of antennas to cover the 
complete azimuth (i.e., by reducing θB and accordingly α = θB/2) the DOA accuracy 
is strongly improved. This is shown in Table 4.1 in which (4.13) is tabulated for 
two values of SNRM, having taken into account the further contributions of (4.6).
In early RWR equipment, the amplitude comparison DF was performed by a 
method derived from the x-y display of an oscilloscope. With reference to Figure 
4.4, the selector is substituted by two differential ���������������������������������
amplifiers, each of which is con-
nected to a pair of antenna channels that are looking in opposite directions (refer 
to Figure 4.3) and that can be called, respectively, according to geographic coordi-
nates north (N) and south (S), east (E) and west (W). Two signals are obtained N-S 
and E-W that represent the resultant amplitudes along two orthogonal axes (see 
Figure 4.7).
It can be shown that the measured emitter DOA is obtained as

The errors relevant to variations of antenna patterns have been evaluated with actual data and the error relevant to SNR is 
evaluated in accordance with (4.13). Note that a well-calibrated LUT can reduce significantly the errors relevant to variations in 
antenna patterns.

This method, therefore, was able to avoid the selection of the strongest and 
second strongest amplitudes to perform the ratio RdB.
4.3  Phase Comparison Monopulse DF Measurement Methods
In phase comparison DF the DOA of a single-frequency (or narrow-bandwidth) RF 
waveform emitted by a source that is a long distance away is determined by measur-
ing the phase differences between the signals received by a set of antennas displaced 
in various ways (along a line, a circle, a lattice, and so on). With reference to Figure 
4.8, a set of n + 1 receiving antennas is displaced along a line, thus forming a linear 
array, at distances d1, d2, ..., dn from a reference antenna. The phase differences 
can be expressed as

and can be measured by means of a phase correlator, for which the schematic block 
diagram is depicted in Figure 4.9.
The accuracy of the phase measurement is directly proportional to the errors 
in the baseline (Δdi) (which is in general negligible except at millimeter waves), in 
the measurement of the carrier frequency (Δf) as well on the effects of the thermal 
noise. The dependence on the thermal noise can be evaluated from Figure 4.10, 
which shows the incremental phase change ΔΨ due to a noise disturbance.

Phase comparison interferometers are the preferred choice for systems that re-
quire high DOA accuracy in that the error can be reduced with large d/λ. However, 
to reach this goal two important factors have to be taken into consideration: the 
coning error and the phase difference ambiguity.
The coning error is present in a linear array in that the phase difference Ψi in a 
2-D angular world (azimuth θ and elevation φ) must be expressed as

The coning error is graphed in Figure 4.11 as a function of true azimuth θ with 
elevation angle φ as a parameter. 
The coning error limits the selection of a linear array for DOA (azimuth) up 
to elevation ≤10° (i.e., nearly at the horizon). The coning error can obviously be

removed by using a planar array antenna or two orthogonal linear arrays capable 
of measuring the elevation angle φ.
The phase difference ambiguity, which comes from the periodicity modulo [2π] 
of the phase Ψi,, can be usually solved for a large-bandwidth (more than one oc-
tave) DF measurement either by adopting the smallest base length d1 (also called 
the elementary base length) of the array, such that at the upper end of the band-
width λmin = c/fmax we have:

The elementary base length is exploited either for linear harmonic arrays (i.e., 
arrays in which the base lengths are di = 2i–1 d1) or for nonharmonic linear arrays 
in which the base lengths are prime number multiples of it (as an example, for a 
two-base array D1 = 2 d1 and D2 = 3 d1 ) and the phase ambiguous measurements 
are solved through the use of the Chinese remainders’ method. 
Harmonic linear arrays are selected whenever the coverage bandwidth is not 
larger than one octave because with the multiple bases they can provide highly ac-
curate DF. In contrast, nonharmonic linear arrays are selected whenever the cover-
age bandwidth is larger than one octave [1, 2]. 
4.3.1  Correlative Phase DF
Communications signal DF in the VHF/UHF bands over the complete azimuth 
coverage either on ground/shipboard or in aircraft CESM equipment is usually

performed by exploiting phase DF applied between the vertical dipoles of a uniform 
circular array (UCA). An odd number (3, 5, or 7) of dipoles is selected in order to 
avoid DOA ambiguities with frequency and thus increasing the measurement band-
width. In what follows we consider, without loss of generality to a different odd 
number of dipoles, a five-dipole UCA, which is shown in Figure 4.12 together with 
its geometrical coordinates.
A circular array can provide both amplitude and phase measurements, which 
are exploited in the extended phase interferometry (EPI) technique as shown in [3], 
which offers the potential of applying high-resolution DOA techniques on multiple 
signals (based on the MUSIC algorithm) although at the expenses of some com-
putational burden at each receiving channel. In this book we consider the results 
relevant to phase measurements only, which are the most commonly used in CESM 
equipment. 
The signals received by each antenna of the array can be compared in any of 
several ways. For example, one antenna can be used as a reference and all of the 
other received signals can be compared to the one received by the reference antenna 
[3]; or we could simply measure the differential phase between adjacent antennas. 
Here, we use this second method, which provides the following phase measure-
ments vector:

RF Direction-Finding and Emitter Location Techniques
θ is the azimuth angle with respect to the radial axis from the center of the UCA 
to one element (element 1),
φ is the elevation angle with respect to the vertical axis passing from the center 
of the UCA,
n k + 1, n k are the thermal noise contributions to the phase measurements in the 
relevant receiving channels.
Because the phase responses of the antennas can be very different from the 
theoretical ones, it is necessary to estimate/measure during the equipment setup 
the nonideal behavior of the actual antennas and take it into account in the de-
termination of the DOA, through a “correlation” technique, hence the name cor-
relative DF. The correlative DF technique consists of two phases: correlation and 
interpolation.
4.3.1.1  First Phase: Correlation
This phase involves execution of a calibration procedure in which an RF signal 
is sent to the antenna receivers from a set of positions, displaced at regular steps 
Δθ in azimuth (and possibly also in elevation at steps Δφ). This procedure is re-
peated at regular steps Δf in frequency within the whole coverage bandwidth of the 
equipment.
The measured data (i.e., differential phases and amplitudes in case of EPI) are 
stored in a calibration table, where each entry relevant to a frequency step is a vec-
tor v(i Δθ; k Δφ) (dimension 5 × 1) for which the lth component can be represented 
as Bl 
(i,k) exp(jpl,l + 1
(i,k)) for l = 1, 2, ..., 5.
The DOA estimate is performed in two steps during equipment operation. The 
first step is the comparison (correlation) of actual measured RF signal differential 
phases (and amplitudes in case of EPI) with the stored data of the calibration table. 
We represent the RF signal measured amplitudes and differential phases with the 
vector u as follows:

Then the first task is the search for the entry that has the data that are most 
similar to the above vector. Because phase measurement accuracies are dependent 
on SNR, the measured amplitudes of the received signal must first be normalized 
(i.e., each amplitude Ai is divided by the modulus of the vector ||u|| = √∑k A2 k to 
perform a good comparison with the entries of the calibration table).
The normalized received signal vector, u′ = u/||u||, whose lth component can 
be expressed as Cl exp(j p(m)l,l + 1), is then correlated with the likely entries of the 
calibration table:

The entry v (i Δθ; k Δφ), which maximizes Corr (u′, v (i Δθ; k Δφ)), determines 
the estimate DOA* = (i Δθ; k Δφ). 
It can be shown that, as the distance of two vectors is defined as

the entry v(i Δθ; kΔφ) that maximizes the correlation also minimizes the distance 
between the two vectors (i.e., it is the most likely representation of the measurement 
vector). 
The correlation function becomes increasingly rippled as L/λ increases and, 
if Δθ and Δφ are not properly selected, its maximization could provide incorrect 
DOA* estimates. Hence the necessity of the second step discussed next.
4.3.1.2  Second Phase: Interpolation
Once the estimated DOA* = (i Δθ; k Δφ) has been obtained, an interpolation is per-
formed between the adjacent entries of the calibration table along two orthogonal 
cuts (azimuth and elevation) using polynomial interpolation, as shown in Figure 
4.13, in order to minimize the systematic error due to the quantization steps of the 
calibration table between the true DOA(θe, φe) and the estimated DOA*, that is, to 
minimize the following errors in azimuth and elevation:

It can be shown [3] that in proximity of its maximum (i.e., DOA*) the cor-
relation function of phase interferometry vectors is constituted by two terms: a 
deterministic term and a statistical term ζ(i,k) due to the thermal noise in the five DF

As is evident from (4.28), the correlation function does not depend on φe and 
an azimuth error can be produced by the contribution of εkφ, which has to be mini-
mized through the polynomial interpolation in both azimuth and elevation cuts.
The cuts of the function F [4] in azimuth are shown in Figure 4.15 versus the 
elevation error with a fixed azimuth error of 5° and in Figure 4.16 versus elevation 
with no elevation error and parameter θe. 
After the above procedure the DOA estimate is affected mainly by the error 
contribution due to thermal noise, which can be expressed as

4.4  Time-Difference DF
The principle of time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements is depicted in Fig-
ure 4.18 where two strictly synchronized receiving antennas/channels are placed at 
a distance B, called the base length, from each other. The emitter signal wavefront, 
with the emitter supposedly at elevation 0° and at a distance R that is much larger

than the base length, is a plane wave tilted at an angle θ with respect to the baseline 
of the two receiving channels. In these conditions the delay Δt = TDOA with which 
the wavefront arrives at the far antenna with respect to the near one is:

where c is the light speed (c = 3 × 108 m/s). For example, assuming B = 14m and θ 
= 45° [i.e., sin (θ) = 0.707], we have Δt = 33 ns. By inverting (4.33) we can immedi-
ately derive the angle θ as follows:

(4.34)
The difference between the arrival time of the same signal at two widely sepa-
rated (airborne or ground-based) sites has been exploited in many radionavigation 
aids because the TDOA measurement establishes an isodelay curve (a hyperbola) 
on the surface of the Earth that passes through the emitter location. 
The accuracy of the angle measurement is derived from (4.34) by taking the 
derivatives of both terms, and indicating with Δ(x) the error in the measurement of 
the parameter x:
	
( / cos( ))

(4.35)
As can be seen, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the projected base 
length B cos(θ) and proportional to the accuracy of the TDOA measurement. In 
the past, with quite a large ΔΔt error (on the order of hundred of nanoseconds), the 
technique was used with large base length B.
The current availability of digital receivers, which operate at very high sam-
pling rates (larger than 1 GHz), allows a Δ Δt error of less than 1 ns to be achieved. 
Therefore, the technique can currently be used on board platforms such as ships, 
large-body A/C, and even ground stations with base length B on the order of 10m. 
As an example, by assuming ΔΔt = 1 ns, B = 10m, and θ = 22.5°, we obtain from 
(4.35) Δθ ≈ 1.9°. This error can be further reduced by some smoothing algorithm 
applied on a number of successive TDOA measurements.
The advantage of the TDOA measurement technique in achieving a moderate 
DOA accuracy is its independence from the signal carrier frequency and hence the 
absence, when covering the complete RF bandwidth, of the number of antenna ar-
rays required by the phase DF measurement technique. 
An example of implementation of the TDOA measurement technique is shown 
in Figures 4.19(a) and (b), which show, respectively, the block diagram of a double-
channel SH receiver and a photograph of a dual DRx board with a common clock. 
The double-channel architecture is fundamental for differential measurements; 
such measurements can be carried out in amplitude, phase, or time, depending on 
the application, as discussed later relevant to further DF techniques. An antenna ar-
rangement on board a ship that provides TDOA measurements over the complete 
azimuth and frequency coverage is shown in Figure 4.20.
Equation (4.35) is strictly valid in the case where elevation = 0°, which provides 
a reasonable azimuth estimate for emitters that are very far away from the baseline. 
Of course, when applied on a single platform that can come near the emitter, the

coning error, due to emitter elevation ≠ 0°, largely worsens the azimuth measure-
ment accuracy. Reduction of the coning error can be achieved with an additional 
orthogonal baseline, either vertical (in order to measure the elevation angle) or a 
further equal horizontal one as shown in Figure 4.20. In this latter case, by per-
forming a TDOA measurement from each baseline we obtain, as shown in Figure 
4.21, the following:

Thus, in order to achieve a fair DOA accuracy over the whole azimuth cover-
age, four orthogonal baselines, forming a square of side B, are provided. This ar-
rangement uses also the two diagonals (with baselines B√2) and provides good rms 
azimuth (on the order of 1°) accuracy for the entire frequency coverage. 
Two methods can be employed for the TDOA measurement, depending on the 
type of emitter signal: (1) leading edge TDOA (LE-TDOA) in the case of pulsed 
emitters, thus exploiting the differential between the pulse rise time; and (2) signal 
correlation (SC-TDOA) in the case of CW-type emitters.

The principle of the LE-TDOA method is depicted in Figure 4.22, which shows 
that Δt is measured during the rise time Tr of the pulses received from each antenna 
at half of the maximum amplitude A0/2.

For conventional pulse radars [6] Tr = 1/Bopt, where Bopt is the bandwidth of 
the matched filter to the transmitted pulse. In the case of the ESM receiver, the 
reception bandwidth Br is different from Bopt because it has to be appropriately se-
lected for the reception of the pulses from many emitters, as shown in Figure 4.23.

RF Direction-Finding and Emitter Location Techniques
At very low sensitivity levels the SC-TDOA technique is prone to multipath 
close to the receiving antennas as well as to spurii signals generated by the receiver 
channels, which can produce erroneous DOA estimates.
Application of super-resolution techniques based on the MUSIC (Multiple Sig-
nals Correlation) algorithm allows for discrimination of interfering signals and 
ensures the SC-TDOA technique’s accuracy. An example of this application on a 
chirped signal with a 2-MHz bandwidth at low SNR is given in Figure 4.27. 
4.5  Emitter Location
Determining the geoposition of emitters is a fundamental function of EW systems, 
because knowledge about their location indicates the disposition of adversarial 
forces in their territory (electronic order of battle, EOB). In this section we focus 
on the physics of the measurement methods available with EW systems, following 
the approach given in [5] and recommending that the interested reader who desires 
deeper insight into the topic review the new computing methods described in [9]. 
Determination of the location of an emitter, called a position fix, can be per-
formed using either of the following methods:
1.	 Measurement of the line of bearing (LOB) of the emitter (in practice, only 
the azimuth angle of arrival of its signal) from two or more EW intercept 
sensors. This technique is referred to as triangulation. 
2.	 Measurement of the TDOA of the signal at two or more EW intercept sen-
sors. This technique is referred to as trilateration. Usually, if the sensors are 
placed on mobile platforms, in addition to the TDOA, a differential Dop-
pler (DD) measurement can also be performed, providing better location 
accuracy.
The trilateration and DD methods have been known for a long time and they 
were executed with intercept sensors placed at very far distances from each other,

so as to form large baselines that could provide very good location accuracy by 
overcoming the poor accuracy of the measurements of the time and Doppler fre-
quency differences. Currently, the evolution of electronic technology has allowed 
highly accurate time and Doppler frequency difference measurement methods to be 
implemented, which in turn allows for emitter geolocation within a single mobile 
platform to be provided, as discussed in the following sections. Also discussed is 
the locating of an airborne emitter from a steady or slow-moving platform.
4.5.1  Triangulation 
The DOAs relevant to the same emitter, as provided by two or more EW intercept 
sensors placed at a distance B (the baseline) from each other, allow for the determi-
nation of the geolocation of that emitter through basic triangle geometry (hence, the 
name triangulation). The principle of the method is shown in Figure 4.28.
The geoposition of emitter E can be evaluated in a straightforward manner as 
follows:

Because the DOA determinations from the intercept sensors are affected by a 
DF error, for ease of treatment we assume they have zero mean and variance (or 
standard deviation) σθ. The bearing lines do not determine a single point but rather 
an area (the hatched area in Figure 4.28). Indeed, if more than two intercept sen-
sors are used, their DOAs do not meet at a single point, but instead form a triangle 
of error that assumes quite different shapes across the plane xy. Hence, the need for 
mathematical methods that determine the center point or position fix (PF) within 
the triangle of error as the location that minimizes the mean squared error from 
the three DOAs (Stanfield method [10]); some other method could also be used to 
find the optimum [9].
Coming back to the case of two intercept sensors, it is important to determine 
the size of the hatched area around PF. To this end, we assume a Gaussian distribu-
tion of the bearing error with zero mean and standard deviation σθ. The PF will 
therefore be located within an elliptical area that defines the percentage of location 
fixes at its interior; usually either 50% (1σ) or 90% (2σ) ellipses are taken into 
consideration.

and as depicted in Figures 4.29(a–c), which show, respectively, the geometry of the 
triangulation method, the error ellipses within a square area of side equal to the 
base length, and the error ellipses outside the previous area. We can see that the two 
axes of the ellipse are proportional to Bσθ/sin(Φ), where Φ is the bistatic angle of 
the triangle formed by the baseline and the position of the emitter (and is shown in 
Figure 4.28). Further, the ellipses of minimum size at any distance from the baseline 
are along the axis of the baseline (as can also be intuitively deduced). Indeed, along 
the axis of the baseline, we have θ2 = π- θ1 and Φ = θ2- θ1 = π-2θ1. Thus by solving 
(4.44) we have the dimensions of the two axes of the elliptical error probability at 
50%:

The normalized location performance (CEP/B) of the triangulation along the 
axis of the baseline versus the normalized distance (R/B) from the baseline is re-
ported in Figure 4.29 with the angular variance as a parameter. 
4.5.2  Trilateration
Emitter location can also be obtained also by measuring the TDOA of the same 
signal at several sensor sites. As discussed earlier in this chapter, two methods are 
available: (1) LE-TDOA, with the addition of DD in the case of pulsed emitters, and 
(2) SC-TDOA, with the addition of DD in the case of CW-type emitters.
The LE-TDOA method is based on the measurement of the TOA of the signal 
pulse at an intercept sensor and on the computation of its difference (TDOA) with 
respect to the TOA of the same pulse at a further intercept sensor placed at a dis-
tance B (on the order of 10 km) from the first one. The two sensors are obviously 
synchronized by some GNSS clock and constitute a baseline. The TDOA measure-
ment establishes an isodelay curve (a hyperbola) on the surface of the Earth that 
passes through the emitter location. By adding a second baseline that is aligned 
with the previous one, by means of a third intercept sensor at a distance B2, the 
TDOA2 computed as the difference between the TOAs of the signal pulse at the 
second and at the third intercept sensor establishes a second isodelay curve. The

intersection of the two isodelay curves determines the geolocation of the emitter. 
The mathematical formulation of the method as well its measurement accuracies 
are described in Appendices B2 and B3 of [5]. In this section we report only the 
main results; interested readers should refer to [5] for more insight into the method.
The geometry of the trilateration is depicted in Figure 4.30. The expressions of 
the two isodelay curves are as follows:

The tangent angle to the isodelay curves at the PF (emitter geolocation) is the 
bisector of their respective bistatic angles (i.e., Φ1/2 and Φ2/2, respectively). Fur-
ther, the minimum position error due to an error ΔTDOA (as an example in the 
TDOA1 measurement) can be shown to be along the normal to the tangent curve 
at PF and of amplitude Δs = (cΔTDOA)/(2 sin(Φ1/2)), that is, inversely proportional 
to half the relevant bistatic angle.
The performance of the trilateration technique is graphed in Figure 4.31 (taken 
from [11]), which shows the normalized CEP to the baseline versus the normal-
ized distance from two equal baselines with the TDOA standard deviation as a 
parameter. 
As can be seen by comparing Figures 4.29(a) and 4.31, the latter provides a 
more accurate PF, albeit at the expense of a more complex ESM equipment archi-
tecture and network synchronization and data links requirements. It does, how-
ever, cope with the following problems: 
•• For CW signals, the TDOA measurements have to be performed through 
signal cross-correlation. This imposes heavier requirements on the data links 
Figure 4.30  Geometry of the trilateration technique.

250 
�����������������������������������對�����������������

between the stations because they have to exchange the complex signal sam-
ples, instead of the synthetic data usually exchanged for pulsed emitters.
•• All of the intercept sensors must be simultaneously in sight of the emitter to 
allow for TDOA measurements on the same signal among the different ESM 
sensors.
•• For short PRI emitters, such as high pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) radar 
waveforms, some ambiguity problems need to be solved.
The trilateration technique is much requested nowadays, especially for ground 
applications such as a passive emitter tracker (PET) network, which is becoming an 
essential complement to the radar network in an IADS for these reasons:
•• Passive ESM sensors have a lower cost, due to their receiving-only architec-
ture, with respect to an additional radar in the relevant network.
•• The PET network is undetectable, thanks to the passive based detection 
strategy.
•• A higher detection range (RAF) of attacking aircrafts can be obtained (and 
thus really early warnings) because the PET network exploits the one-way 
signal attenuation. 
•• The system has the capability not only to detect, but also to identify targets 
by means of a priori information stored in the emitter library.
•• The system has the ability to operate in very dense environments, using a 
high number of measured emitter waveform parameters to discriminate and 
classify airborne emitters. 
•• The system can exploit the specific emitter identification (SEI) techniques to 
identify in a unique way the emitters pertaining to a specific platform.

A typical layout of a PET network is shown in Figure 4.32, and its tracking 
performance is reported in Figure 4.33.
4.5.3  Frequency Difference on Arrival Passive Location Technique
Historically passive location of ground-based emitters from flying platforms was 
performed using the methods described in the previous sections, such as triangula-
tion and multilateration [5]. Currently, the electronics technology evolution has 
allowed the development of techniques based on measurement of the Doppler fre-
quency differential within two antenna/receiver groups installed within the same 
flying platform. This technique provides very accurate location estimates. Because 
the differential measurements are taken instantaneously on the arrival of the signal 
wavefront at the platform, the technique is called frequency difference on arrival 
(FDOA). The advantage of this technique is the short time required to perform 
Figure 4.32  Typical layout of a PET network.

emitter location, which is on the order of a radar switch-on period when in the 
EMCON condition.
The location technique combines DOA and FDOA measurements as reported 
in Figure 4.34, which illustrates the principle of this technique. The motion of an 
A/C at velocity v with respect to ground induces a rotation of the LOS θ of the 
radar emitter. The LOS angular velocity ω depends on the tangential component 
(i.e., orthogonal to the LOS) of the velocity, called vT, and the distance R between 
the A/C and the emitter:

σFDOA = (2√3/(2π)) (1/Tp)(√ (1/(M SNR)) where M is the number of FDOA mea-
surements required to provide an estimate, as shown in Figure 4.35, and Tp is the 
period at which successive measurements are taken.
As can be seen from (4.50), the accuracy of the range estimate is strongly de-
pendent on the geometry (the angle DOA, the orientation α of the baseline with 
respect to the A/C velocity vector, and the range of the emitter, which affects the 
SNR), but it is improved by the length of the baseline, the speed of the A/C, and 
the frequency of the emitter (i.e., this technique cannot be exploited at the VHF 
communication frequency band). A sample of the performance of this technique is

with the orientation of the baseline orthogonal to the A/C velocity vector, as shown 
in Figure 4.37.

4.5.4  Inverse Passive Location
FDOA can be also exploited, similar to the passive location performed by airborne 
ESM equipment, with a technique developed by Elettronica, called IPL, that pro-
vides a passive location estimate of flying emitters from single steady stations on 
the surface (either ground or sea surface). Obviously, this result may be easily and 
more accurately obtained by a network of ESM equipment that exploits the TDOA 
technique described in Section 4.5.2. However, on some occasions stand-alone ships 
or mobile armored vehicles that are operating in EMCON mode (i.e., radar and 
communications silence) and without the aid of airborne early warning A/C or 
surveillance satellites (not all armed forces are provided with those means) need to 
be warned about the intentions of an approaching A/C emitter.
The principle of operation of the IPL technique is depicted in Figure 4.38. 
This technique requires the measurement of the following three parameters of an 
emitter:
•• The TDOA or, equivalently, the DOA,
•• The Doppler frequency differential in angle FDOA,
•• The Doppler frequency difference with time DFD.
The first two parameters mentioned above are obtained as differential mea-
surements between two antenna/receiver channels placed at the extremes of a base-
line of length B, while the third parameter, which consists of the derivative of the 
received frequency with time, is measured by a single antenna/receiver channel 
designed with stringent requirements that are especially relevant to phase noise.
With reference to the geometry of Figure 4.38 and the considerations already 
exposed in Section 4.5.2, it is possible to evaluate the above two first parameters 
as follows:

where ω = d (LOS)/dt = vT/R = (v sinθ)/R is the LOS angular rotation speed.
The FDOA measurement is insufficient to determine the range because ω is 
dependent on both the transversal component of the velocity of the aircraft vT as 
well on the distance R, thus an estimate of the velocity value is needed and can be 
obtained through the measurement of the time derivative of the radial component 
vr = v cosθ of the velocity of the aircraft as shown in Figure 4.39. The radial com-
ponent of the velocity can be measured as the Doppler frequency difference (DFD) 
with time (provided that the emitter carrier frequency is constant, i.e., a coherent 
emitter).
The above measurement corresponds in kinematics to the determination of the 
radial acceleration of the A/C, in that

4.6  Conclusion 
259
The Doppler frequency difference with time DFD can be measured in two 
modes: (1) as the second derivative of the initial phase of the pulses within each 
burst (intraburst mode) and (2) as the first derivative of the Doppler frequency 
measured from the bursts that exhibit the same carrier frequency (interburst mode). 
The interburst mode, which uses longer observation times with respect to the first 
mode, provides a better location accuracy. The normalized IPL accuracy σR/R, 
which is dependent on the frequency f, DFD, DOA, and FDOA measurements, can 
be expressed as:

The accuracy of the technique, as with all of the measured parameters, is obvi-
ously dependent on the input SNR (i.e., on the radar ERP) and the PD waveform 
(number of pulses in the burst and the number of bursts that have the same carrier 
frequency within the observation time).
The technique presents some drawbacks:
•• No measurement is possible along the direction of the baseline. But this in-
convenience can be removed by introducing further baselines at an angle 
with the first, forming a polygon. The domains of validity of the measure-
ment, which are dependent on direction from the baseline are reported in 
Figure 4.41.
•• The DFD and FDOA measurements are ill conditioned for cases that involve 
nearly radial trajectories with respect to a fixed platform. In these conditions, 
however, the ESM equipment provides a warning to the platform to switch 
on the on-board radars and designate the associated weapon systems.
The normalized IPL accuracy σR/R is reported in Figure 4.42 for the case of an 
A/C emitter flying transverse to the steady platform.
4.6  Conclusion
In this chapter the main passive DF techniques were presented. These techniques ex-
ploit the instantaneous signal parameters of RF emitters, such as amplitude, phase, 
and TOA, to provide warning and/or cueing of ECM systems for subsequent threat 
countering. The techniques discussed, supported by the evolution of novel elec-
tronic technologies, were also shown to be capable, when operating in differential 
mode either within the same platform or within a group of similar sensors, of pro-
viding emitter location either on the ground/sea surface or in the air.

Electronic Countermeasure Systems
5.1  Introduction
The objective of ECM systems is to reduce or suppress the effectiveness of enemy 
defense systems and their relevant weapons systems through soft-kill actions such 
as confusion, distraction, deception, or seduction. In the absence of electronic coun-
termeasure (ECM) systems, the kill probability of the current generation of weap-
ons systems is very high and could produce a high attrition rate (i.e., large number 
of casualties and destroyed assets) during a combat mission.
ECM systems cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum and are named in 
accordance with either the wavelength/bandwidth in which they operate or the 
equipment function against which they operate. Hence, we have communications 
ECMs (CECMs) that work against communication systems, radar ECMs (RECMs) 
that work against radar systems (often simply called ECM), and infrared ECMs 
(IRCMs) that work against the IR systems.
Although CECM systems are only of the active type (i.e., they provide their 
countermeasure through appropriate signal transmission), both RECM and IRCM 
systems can be either of the active or passive type. The latter type, namely, chaff in 
the RF band and flares in the IR band, provides the countermeasure without any 
signal transmission, usually a seduction through the concealment of the real target. 
The classification of the ECM systems is diagrammed in Figure 5.1. 
Typical applications of RECM systems are for self-protection and for the mu-
tual protection of mobile platforms. CECMs are primarily used only in the latter 
application. The block diagram of a typical self-protection jammer (SPJ) is shown 
in Figure 5.2. A JPS uses on-board countermeasures (i.e., the jammer) along with 
off-board countermeasures, which are intended to divert the attacking missile from 
its target. These systems consist of (1) dispensed expendable devices (i.e., chaff and 
flares), (2) propelled active devices, and (c) towed devices (some of which can be 
recovered and reused).
The use of off-board and on-board IRCMs implies the use of a missile warning 
system (MWS) that detects the attacking missile and triggers the countermeasure 
(CM) in the appropriate direction. If the MWS is constituted by a short-range pulse 
Doppler radar, called missile approach warner (MAW), then it can also trigger 
the off-board action at the appropriate time, thus providing a more effective CM.

Before describing the architecture of the integrated self-protection system, we recall

5.1  Introduction 
263
5.1.1  Typical RECM Requirements and Missions
Basically two types of radars are countered by RECM systems: surveillance and 
tracking radars. The surveillance or search radar functions are designed to locate 
and automatically track targets within a large volume. This allows the defense cen-
ters to perform threat evaluation and weapon assignment (TEWA). Because surveil-
lance radars have to detect targets at long range, they are usually operating at low 
RF (C to G, according to EW band nomenclature, or VHF to C band according to 
the standard designation). Low-RF operation is used in order to exploit the low 
atmospheric attenuation (see Section 2.1) of these bands.
These radars are usually characterized by a rotating antenna, either the para-
bolic-plus-cosecant-square (cosec2) type, which provides 2-D target location, or the 
phased array type, which provides 3-D target location. In both cases, the anten-
nas have a narrow main-beam antenna that scans the search volume and sidelobe 
beams that are illuminating (and receiving from) all directions. The sidelobe level 
(SLL) with respect to the peak of the main beam is dependent on the type of em-
ployed antenna and is classed as ordinary (SLL = –13 to –30 dBpeak), low (SLL = 
–30 to –40 dBpeak), or ultra-low (SLL < –40 dBpeak) [1]. The typical transmitted 
waveforms are pulse-compression signals with 3-D radars showing also some form 
of waveform agility in the elevation scanning.
The tracking radars are the high-priority threats that need to be countered by 
RECM equipment because they are associated with the engagement of a weapon 
system, especially in the terminal phase. When a tracking radar is locked onto a 
target, the associated weapon is also expected to be directed at the target. The task 
of the RECM system is to cause the tracking radar to break lock, which in turn 
removes the guidance information used by the weapon to converge on the target. 
Figure 5.3  Functional block diagram of an integrated self-protection system.

���������������������������������
Electronic Countermeasure Systems
The tracking radars are characterized by a narrow beam supported by a relatively 
small dimension antenna, usually operating at high RF frequencies (I to Ka band, 
according to EW band nomenclature, or X to K­ band according to the standard 
designation). Each aircraft or ship that can be engaged by a weapons system has to 
be sufficiently protected by RECM systems capable of providing for its self-defense.
In the airborne case it is generally desirable to supplement the strike aircraft’s 
self-protection system with either an escort jammer/close support jammer (EJ/CSJ) 
or stand-off jammer (SOJ) system. These systems are carried on escort platforms. 
Escort/close support jamming involves a dedicated aircraft carrying high-power 
jammers that accompanies the friendly strike force and provides a protective RF 
jamming shield in support of the entire strike force. Stand-off jamming involves a 
platform that stands at some distance beyond the effective range of the weapons 
that defend the target. Sketches of typical EJ/CSJ and SOJ mission profiles are given 
in Figure 5.4.
The SOJ has the advantage of carrying a large dedicated RECM payload. It has 
the disadvantage, however, of requiring a very large jammer ERP because it oper-
ates far away from the victim radars and because its jamming transmissions are for 
most of the time into the sidelobe pattern of the victim radar, as discussed next. 
5.1.2  EW Radar Jamming Equation
The objective of jamming is to inject an interference signal into the victim radar re-
ceiver so as to mask the actual target. The interference signal can be either a random 
noise waveform or a manipulated replica of the radar waveform. The amount of 
transmitted jammer power required to achieve this result can be evaluated through 
the jammer-to-signal power ratio (JSR) at the output of the radar receiver as follows:
The target signal power S received by the radar is (see also Section 2.3) is:

Grj = radar antenna gain in the direction of the jammer (i.e., Grj = Gr SLL),
Rj = distance of the jammer from the radar (m),
Lj = jammer transmission losses.
In the presence of a jamming signal the radar detection is impaired by the re-
ceiver noise and the jamming signal spread over a bandwidth Bj >Br, thus provid-
ing in the receiver bandwidth Br an equivalent noise power N′ = N(1+ J/N). If we 
assume that J >>N (which is usually the case) we have N′ ≈ J and hence the cases 
discussed next.
5.1.2.1  Self-Protection Jammer
For a SPJ, R = Rj and Grj = Gt = Gr. By indicating with ERPr = PtGt/Lt the effective 
radiated power of the radar, and with ERPj = PjGj/Lj the effective radiated power of 
the jammer, we have (by ignoring the term La, which is negligible):

and hence the self-screening range Rj,ss; or equivalently the maximum target (i.e.,

achieve a sufficient self-screening range against a given radar.
5.1.2.2  Mutual Protection Jammer
For a mutual protection jammer we have Grj = GrSLL and by assuming Gr = Gt we 
can determine from (5.3) the burn-through range Rtmax,j (i.e., the maximum target 
detection range in presence of jamming), which is:

This equation shows that the ratio ρ is increasing with short wavelengths, low 
SLL (i.e., ultra-low sidelobe antennas), and high radar processing gain (propor-
tional to Bj/Br). The factors that produce a reduction of the ratio ρ are the increase 
in the effective radiated power of the jammer ERPj and the decrease of the jammer 
distance Rj from the radar (i.e., escort jammer) In Figure 5.5 the typical required 
effective radiated power of the jammer ERPj vs. frequency for the various jamming 
roles on aircraft and ships are shown.
5.2  Radar ECM Architecture
Modern military platforms, such as aircraft (whichever their role: strike or air su-
periority) and ships, operate in high pulse density symmetric conflict scenarios. 
Pulse density is generated by the large number of radar-controlled weapons systems 
deployed in any given operational area. Chapter 2 showed that modern radars 
transmit sophisticated waveforms that constitute a challenge to the interception, 

268 
���������������������������������
Electronic Countermeasure Systems
detection, classification, and identification of the emitters discussed in Chapter 3 
relevant to RESM systems as well as to the selection of appropriate and effective 
countermeasures to be delivered against them by the RECM equipment.
Further, in such scenarios the platform is most likely attacked by many simul-
taneous threats of different types, and because each is provided with some specific 
type of ECCM, the RECM is required to deliver an ECM that is appropriate and 
effective against each of the simultaneous threats. The tailored ECM against each 
identified threat is implemented on the basis of intelligence data gathered about 
the threat. These data are coded and loaded prior to any platform mission into the 
threat library file of the RECM. The tailored countermeasure to a threat is usually 
constituted by a sequence or combination of elementary ECM techniques (which 
will be discussed in Chapter 6) with programmable parameters, which are part of 
the large inventory of available techniques of the RECM equipment. The sequence/
combination of programmable ECM techniques relevant to a given threat is called 
a jamming program.
A RECM system architecture that meets the above requirements [2] is illus-
trated in Figure 5.6 and has to perform the following functions in sequence:
1.	 Interception, identification, and prioritization of the simultaneous threats 
on the basis of their dangerousness,
2.	 Association of the appropriate jamming program with each threat,
3.	 Allocation of jammer resources to implement the selected jamming 
programs,
4.	 Continuous tracking of DOA and threat signal parameters during engage-
ment with the threat,

5.	 Declaration of a ceased engagement after the threat is no longer locked 
onto the platform or when a sufficient safe distance from the threat emitter 
is achieved.
Function 1 is usually performed by ESM equipment, which provides threat 
designation in terms of identification, DOA, and current threat emitter parameters 
(i.e., the so-called “radar mode”). Some ESM equipment also provides the threat 
emitter’s distance from the RECM platform (as discussed in Chapter 4) which is 
very useful to function 5.
Function 2 is provided by the system processor that, upon threat designation, 
updates the list of engaged threats in accordance with priority rules based on threat 
dangerousness. It also manages the execution of the appropriate jamming program 
associated with the threat in the threat library file of the RECM. As will be shown 
later, this function is performed through a dynamic and adaptive resources man-
agement program (called power management), which envisages the selection of an 
alternative jamming program (always coded in the threat library file and associated 
with the threat emitter) in a case in which some required resources are completely 
busy with a higher priority threat emitter.
Function 3 from the preceding list is executed by the system resources, which 
can be either constituted by a number N of identical independent jamming chan-
nels with N being equal to the maximum number of simultaneous threats, or by 
a limited number n < N of highly flexible and powerful jamming channels, which 
counter the simultaneous threats on a fast-switching time-sharing basis.
A jamming channel is composed of the chain of a wideband receiving antenna, 
a frequency receiver tuned to the threat emitter’s frequency with a bandwidth larger 
than the radar waveform one, a jamming RF waveform synthesizer called an excit-
er that is capable of producing either noise waveforms or manipulated threat signal 
replicas, a wideband high-power amplifier, and a wideband transmitting antenna 
as shown in Figure 5.7.
For most platforms, but especially aircraft, on-board equipment that has lim-
ited mass, volume, and power consumption are highly desired and hence any solu-
tion that adopts a limited number of highly flexible jamming channels (like that 
shown in Figure 5.6) is the preferred one. Highly flexible jamming channels capable 
of swift tuning over the entire threat frequency bandwidth and rapid beam steering 
over the complete required spatial coverage have been made available as a result

of the use of modern technologies such as wideband multibit digital RF memories 
(DRFMs) and wideband solid-state Rx/Tx phased arrays or travelling wave tube 
(TWT)–based transmitters, as discussed next.
In Figure 5.6 a low-band (LB) section (from D or E to G band) is shown in 
addition to the high-band (HB) section (usually from G to J band).The LB section 
may be present only in airborne self-protection jammers (ASPJs), whereas the HB 
section is used by all of the platforms (aircraft, ships, and armored vehicles) for 
defense from aircraft attacks.
Because most radar threats are constituted by tracking radars of the single 
tracking target (STT) type, the architecture of the system is based on adaptive time-
shared exploitation of the above-mentioned powerful and quickly switches (from 
one threat to the next) resources as commanded by a bank of time-of-arrival pre-
dictor circuits (PTOA; i.e., predictor of time of arrival), each assigned to a threat. 
The PTOA operates on the PRI measurements of its assigned threat emitter and 
generates time-gates (PTOAG) centered at the next pulse TOA with a sufficient 
width that takes into account the threat emitter PW, the type of PRI changes, and 
their tolerances and jitter (both measured and checked with the available intelli-
gence data loaded in the threat emitter file of the equipment), as well the duration 
of the jamming response. This arrangement allows assignment of a complete jam-
ming channel (like that shown in Figure 5.7) to each threat during the correspond-
ing PTOAG as shown in Figure 5.8. A number of best practice system resources 
management routines are applied by the system processor; their discussion is be-
yond the scope of this book [3].
Thus, a number of jamming channels (virtual channels) equal to the number 
of simultaneous threats is made available to counter the threats. As a consequence, 
the time occupation of one actual channel is basically dependent on the duty cycle 
of the threat emitter and of the jamming program associated with the threat. The 
number of actual parallel channels of the RECM is therefore evaluated on the basis 
of the estimated time occupation of the channel resources during an engagement 
with the maximum envisaged number of simultaneous threats, of their waveforms, 
and of the selected jamming responses. A good rule of thumb is to use at least two 
actual jamming channels in a high-quality RECM. The functional block diagram 
of a modern ASPJ based on the above-described architecture provided with high-
gain linear active phased arrays (covering a large spatial sector by steering a narrow 
azimuth beam) is shown in Figure 5.9.
In the next sections, after discussing the jamming channel resources mentioned 
above (namely, the DRFM and the transmitter solutions), we will deal with the

5.3  Digital Radio-Frequency Memory
As shown in Chapter 2, the vast majority of modern radars employ Doppler and 
pulse compression techniques, which must be countered by coherent jamming re-
sources that can replicate and manipulate the signals of the radar threats against 
which they are directed. Only through coherent jamming can RECM equipment 
overcome the significant advantage of 30 to 50 dB gained by the above techniques 
being employed in radar signal processing with respect to noise jamming waveforms.
The concept of a DRFM is simple and it began to be applied in the late 1970s, 
but its implementation required a number of technological advances before it could 
become an effective device. Its function is the coherent storage (ideally, for an infi-
nite amount of time) of the threat signal so it can be reproduced and manipulated 
(in time delay and frequency content) by means of digital techniques in order to 
provide deceptive returns to the threat. 
The DRFM has many applications in the EW domain, such as these:
•• Radar/communication signal storage for subsequent ELINT/COMINT 
analyses,
•• Deception of covert communications,
•• Jamming operations,
•• Anti-ARM decoys replicating radar signals,
•• Radar signal generation for simulation and test equipment.
The block diagram of a single-sideband (SSB) DRFM is shown in Figure 5.10.
The DRFM receive path is very similar to a conventional superheterodyne re-
ceiver with regard to the rejection of spurious signals. At the device RF input, a 
bandpass filter (BPF) followed by an amplifier is used to pass and amplify only the 
signals of interest. The RF intercepted signal is downconverted to baseband by a 
LO. A lowpass filter (LPF) removes the aliasing frequency components above the 
Nyquist rate and the unwanted mixer intermodulation products. At the output of 
the LPF, the signal is sampled with a high rate clock and digitized by an ADC with 
≥4 to 6 bits. The higher the number of bits, the larger the dynamic range but also 
the slower the conversion process. The bandwidth of the device is  (the Nyquist 
rate), with k < 1, due to the presence of both the BPF and LPF.
Figure 5.10  Block diagram of a SSB DRFM.

5.3  Digital Radio-Frequency Memory 
273
The digital samples are recorded into a high-speed dual-ported memory, so 
that the stored signal can be replayed simultaneously through memory control. 
Recording in the dual-ported memory usually requires the use of serial-to-parallel 
circuitry at input to reduce the conversion data rate, so as to match the dual-ported 
memory’s input bandwidth. Replay of the stored signal vice versa requires parallel-
to-serial circuitry at output to match the dual-ported memory’s output bandwidth.
The digital signal retrieved from memory is fed to a digital-to-analog converter 
(DAC) followed by a LPF in order to reproduce the analog signal. The baseband 
signal is then mixed with the same LO used in the downconversion in order to 
reconstitute the RF signal. The RF output is then passed through a BPF to pro-
vide the transmitter section with only the desired signal spectrum. The retention 
of the phase of the intercepted RF signal is achieved with a double-sideband (DSB) 
DRFM, the block diagram for which is shown in Figure 5.11.
The input RF signal phase retention is provided by the digitization of the two 
channels (I and Q) at the output of the quadrature IF modulator, which also down-
converts the RF input signal into baseband by mixing it with the LO frequency.
The block diagram of the DSB DRFM configuration of Figure 5.11 also shows 
are the memory controller (MC) and high-speed (HS) dual-port memory. The MC 
manages the storage of the data by assigning the memory address functions as well 
as the retrieval of the signal data and the relevant delay/recall operations.
The dual-ported memory size determines the maximum duration of the emit-
ter signals that can be stored. Because the memory is nondestructive, the DRFM is 
capable of reading out a stored signal within a period of 10 to 20 ns (which is an

important feature in some CM techniques, as will be shown in Chapter 6). Recall 
that the signal can be stored for an indefinite period of time and read out as many 
times as desired or until the threat signal is cancelled from memory.
The operation of the DRFM against coherent radars is limited by the long-term 
stability of the LOs used in the down-up frequency conversion process. Current LO 
frequencies are produced by highly stable frequency synthesizers, based on direct 
digital synthesis (DDS) oscillators and phase-locked control loops (PLLs).
Note that the DSB DRFM has, at the expense of a more complex architecture, 
the advantages of a bandwidth that is double that of the SSB DRFM, using the 
same clock rate (i.e., BDSB = ±) and the retention of the intercepted RF signal phase.
The wideband DSB DRFM has become the essential device of RECM systems 
for its flexibility in replicating any threat signal within its frequency coverage, in-
cluding wideband frequency and pulse-compression radar signals. Therefore, it is 
benefiting from serious technological research efforts to improve the high-speed 
multibit ADC, which is the fundamental device of the DRFM architecture. Mul-
tiple bits are required to reduce spurious responses due to the ADC quantization, 
to prevent small-signal suppression in a simultaneous multithread intercept, and to 
implement a number of sophisticated ECM techniques. The dynamic range (DR) 
of the DRFM is dependent on the number n of the ADC bits as is DR ≈ 6n (dB). A 
recent GaAs technology ADC provides a greater than 1-GHz instantaneous band-
width with up to 6 to 8 bits. Spurious signals in the DRFM are produced for the 
following causes:
•• An imbalance between the quadrature channels, which causes image frequen-
cies as shown in [3, 4].
•• Quantization process: a DRFM with n bits has 2n–1amplitude levels that are 
usually equally divided into positive and negative levels. This arrangement 
produces only odd harmonics. The spurious levels generated by quantization 
have been evaluated by Pace [4, Chapter 7, Section 7.7]. Typically a 2-bit 
DRFM has the worst spurious level of about –18.1 dB below the peak, and 
a 4-bit DRFM has a worst spurious level of about –34.4 dB below the peak.
•• Intermodulation products due to the simultaneous presence of two or more 
intercepted signals. 
5.3.1  Phase-Sampled DRFMs 
 Phase sampling of the intercepted signal is a much used technique in a DRFM 
alternative architecture, because the radar signal information is mainly carried in 
the angle (and hence phase) modulation. In a phase-sampled DRFM, the amplitude 
information is discarded and the instantaneous phase is sampled and quantized. 
The block diagram of a 4-bit phase-sampled DRFM is shown in Figure 5.12.
After the LO downconversion, the signal is hard limited so that the phase can 
be sampled and quantized by the analog comparators. Both I and Q signals are 
first split and phase shifted by π/4 rad (45°) forming I45 and Q45 signals. The 
four signals—I, Q, I45, and Q45—are then further split and phase shifted by π/8 
rad (22.5°) thus forming the following four further signals: I22.5, Q22.5, I67.5, and 
Q67.5. These eight signals are again split into 16 signals, with 8 of the 16 channels 

5.3  Digital Radio-Frequency Memory 
275
further phase shifted by π rad (180°). The 16 channels are then compared two by 
two to determine the 4-bit binary output representation of the phase. This particu-
lar binary code is called an n (n = 4) bit Johnson code, which has 2n = 16 states, 
being coded with only 2n–1comparators (C), as shown in Figure 5.13. Note that 
4-bit amplitude DRFM requires 15 comparators and a precision resistor string, 
which is amplitude sensitive. Relevant to the hardware implementation of a phase 
DRFM, the phase-shifted signals are manipulated using symmetrical resistor rings 
and ring demodulators [3]. At the output the I and Q components are synthesized 
from memory and mixed with the LO to reconstruct the signal for retransmission.
The advantages of phase-sampled DRFM include similar performance to the 
amplitude DSB DRFM, but the storage required is for only half the number of 
bits (as shown with the Johnson code for n bits). Also, harmonic suppression is 
improved over amplitude DRFM due to the hard limiting at the I and Q channel 
inputs. Further, phase modulation can be applied directly at the output signal.
The disadvantages are relevant to the simultaneous signal processing, because 
small signals are suppressed by up to 6 dB and spurious intermodulation products 
are generated. Further in applications such as the straight repeater jammer an ad-
ditional subsystem is required to re-create the missing amplitude information.
The performance comparison between amplitude and phase DRFM reported in 
[3] shows that a 4-bit amplitude DRFM and a 4-bit phase DRFM have, respective-
ly, worst spurious levels of –35.9 dBc and 23.5 dBc and a total amount of spurious 
signals of 0.27% and 1.28%. Note that the advantage of the phase approach over 
the amplitude approach diminishes as the number of bits increases.

The reconstruction of the I and Q signals for the 4-bit system is performed by 
phase shifting the eight digital inputs in π/8 rad (22.5°) increments. The DRFM 
output can be directly phase modulated by appropriate rotations of the eight inputs 
before reconstruction of the I and Q channels.
Examples of typical jamming programs implemented by modulators associated 
with a phase-sampled multibit DRFM and a photograph of a complete DRFM with 
associated modulators are shown in Figures 5.14 and 5.15, respectively.
5.4  Radar ECM Transmitters
Modern RECM transmitters are composed of an RF chain of a wideband, solid-
state, high-gain amplifier (SSA), which drives a wideband, high-power output am-
plifier (HPA). There are two types of HPAs, based on either vacuum tubes (valves) 
technology or on SSAs, each one driving an element of a phased array antenna. A 
RECM wideband vacuum tube HPA is usually made of TWT amplifiers of the helix 
type and are constructed as shown in Figure 5.16.
The principle of operation of the TWT, which was invented by R. Kompfner 
at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, in 1943 (and later improved 
by him at the Bell Labs), is the amplification of an electron beam provided by an 
electromagnetic field. The EM field is produced by current modulated at RF that 
is circulating in a helical slow-wave circuit wrapped around a tube where elec-
trons are extracted from an anode (also called an electron gun) and accelerated 
along the tube by a high-amplitude electric field applied between the anode and the 
cathode (also called the collector). The electrons deliver a high power that is RF 
modulated. TWTs, due to their helical structure can be implemented in a practi-
cal size only in the microwave bandwidth and are used in many electronic systems 
beyond EW equipment such as radars and communication links (especially satellite 
transponders).

5.4  Radar ECM Transmitters

Wideband TWTs are available in two types: either with a CW power output in 
the range of 100 to 400W or with pulsed power output in the range of 1 to 2 kW 
with decreasing duty cycle (from 10% to 4%). The typical power output pattern of 
a wideband TWT has a parabolic shape with the maximum at midband and nearly 
equal lower values (on the order of 1 dB) at the two extremes of the bandwidth.

Electronic Countermeasure Systems
The efficiency (i.e., the ratio of output power to the power consumption of the 
device) of wideband TWTs is inversely proportional to the width of the covered 
band and ranges from 15% to 25%. Of course, one disadvantage is that the high 
delivered power output is achieved by utilizing additional high-voltage power sup-
plies to provide voltages on the order of 4 to 10 kV between the two electrodes. 
The higher the voltage, the higher the danger of arcing in the presence of humidity 
or at high altitudes due to the low air density.
A further disadvantage of wideband TWTs is their limited life (due to cathode 
poisoning), which is usually less than 2,000 hours of operation. Also, as TWTs 
become operative, they need a warm-up period (usually on the order of <10 sec), 
so they must be kept in a constant standby state for the duration of a platform

mission, which can rapidly exhaust their operational lifetime. Spare TWTs in stor-
age must be briefly switched on with a periodicity recommended by the manufac-
turer (the so-called “refresh operation”) to prevent the loss of their vacuum due to 
the permeability of the metal parts used on TWTs. 
TWT technology has largely improved over the years with increasing efficien-
cy and decreasing volumes. With regard to volume they have evolved from midi-
TWTs (around 1 liter) to mini-TWTs (about 0.2 liter) and finally to microwave 
power modules (MPMs). MPMs have been developed by a number of U.S. firms 
under a program started by the Naval Research Laboratory in 1990. A MPM is 
composed of a mini-TWT that is driven by a high-gain, high-power SSA and en-
closed within a small size unit (on the order of 1 to a couple of liters depending on 
the power output), comprising also a high-density power conditioner (connected to 
the platform’s mains) and a conduction cooling package. Due to their limited size, 
MPMs have been used as transmitters in towed decoys. A sample MPM is shown 
in Figure 5.17. Typical TWT performance statistics are listed in Table 5.1. 
The power output of wideband TWTs is sufficient to implement the transmitter 
of a SPJ by connecting the TWT output to a wideband, wide-spatial-coverage horn 
antenna either with a low-loss power cable if the connection length is on the order 
of 1m or a waveguide if the length is longer. 
When larger power outputs are required, TWTs can be combined through 
phase shifters at their input and by means of a Butler matrix (which is microwave 
network composed of 90° and 180° hybrids) at their output as shown in Figure 
5.18 for the case of a Butler matrix of order 2. It is used to connect two anten-
nas: depending on the phase setting at the input of the TWTs, the whole power 
can be concentrated in one of the two antennas. A further combination method 
is achieved by employing a Rotman lens, instead of the Butler matrix, as a beam-

forming network. By operating the TWTs in linear mode it is possible to produce 
multiple simultaneous beams, overlapped in time.
In recent years advances in semiconductor technology relevant to microwave 
power generation have allowed for the implementation of small, medium-power-
output solid-state (i.e., semiconductor instead of vacuum tubes) amplifiers, that, 
appropriately driven in phase and coupled directly with the radiating elements of 
an array antenna, transform the array into an active phased array antenna capable 
of steering a high-power beam within a large spatial coverage. If in addition to the 
transmitting path a receiving path is also implemented within the same module 
connected to the radiating element of the array antenna, the phased array antenna 
becomes a transmit/receive (T/R) antenna very similar to the ones employed by 
modern radars.
Active phased array T/R antennas (APAs) constitute a highly efficient solution 
for integrated EW systems that comprise RECMs compliant with the operational

requirement of countering many simultaneous threats. The main advantages of 
APAs are as follows:
•• Maximum ERP is delivered to each threat to be countered, through their 
angular selection and tracking. 
•• ERP generation is efficient with reductions in mass, volume, power consump-
tion, and dissipation.
•• The use of high-voltage power supplies is avoided.
•• If a T/R module fails, system performance degrades gracefully.
•• The integrated EW system’s sensitivity is increased because of the higher 
phased array antenna gain, which is useful for countering LPI radars.
•• Highly accurate direction finding (HADF) is possible with many techniques 
(amplitude monopulse and phase interferometry).
The basic characteristic of a phased array antenna is the ability to change the 
peak direction of its radiation pattern without mechanical displacement of its radi-
ating aperture. The phased array aperture produces a planar wavefront, whose an-
gular direction of propagation can be changed electronically by imposing a suitable 
phase relationship among the radiating elements that form the array. A conceptual 
block diagram of a linear phased array antenna is shown in Figure 5.19.
The steering of the beam in a given direction θ is obtained by shifting the phase 
of the Tx/Rx signal of each T/R module by an amount ΔΨ = (2πd/λ) sinθ (where d is 
the spacing between two elements of the array and λ is the wavelength) with respect 
to the preceding module in the array. This can be achieved by means of a digitally 
controlled phase shifter. With reference to Figure 5.19, a signal wavefront can be 
transmitted in the direction θ0 with respect to the array by applying the following 
phase shift to the ith T/R module:

where gel(θ, φ) is the voltage gain of the single radiating element of the array in the 
direction (θ, φ) with respect to the array broadside. The beamwidth of the single 
element must be equal to the required spatial coverage. The radiating element also 
provides the polarization feature to the phased array antenna. To meet the require-
ment of no blind polarization against all type of radars (which use linear or circular 
polarized antennas), the jammer antenna elements are linearly polarized either at 
a 45°slant or double linear (horizontal and vertical) with instantaneous selectable 
polarization to maximize the delivered ERP to the victim radar. Sometimes, due to 
space limitations, as in the case of towed decoys, circular polarization (either RHCP 
or LHCP) is also used. The most commonly used radiating elements are cross-
printed notch elements (Vivaldi) that provide double linear polarization or sinuous 
spirals polarized at a 45° slant. Simple vertical-printed notch elements are used with 
a 45° polarizer in front of the array.

Expression (5.11) implies that the maximum receive gain of the phased ar-
ray antenna is obtained by giving to each module a phase shift that depends on 
the knowledge of the direction of arrival and the wavelength of the emission. The 
beamwidth of the phased array as shown in Appendix C is dependent on the type 
of complex illumination (amplitude and phase) impressed on the array elements. In 
case of uniform illumination per (5.10), the beamwidth expressed in degrees is θB 
= 51λ/Nd. The beamwidth is inversely proportional to the length of the array Nd. 
When the beam is scanned to an angle θ0, the projected length of the array in that 
direction is reduced by a factor cosθ0 and, hence, the beamwidth is increased by 
the same factor; that is, the scanned beamwidth is θB,scan = θB/cosθ0. As reported in 
Appendix C, one negative characteristic of the phased array in terms of the depen-
dence of the ratio of the distance of the elements on the wavelength d/λ is the ap-
pearance of grating lobes in the visible space when the beam is scanned toward its 
maximum scan angle. The appearance in visible space of grating lobes is negative 
on transmission because it subtracts power from the main beam and on reception 

5.4  Radar ECM Transmitters

as is can provide an erroneous DOA of the emitter. The avoidance of grating lobes 
in the visible space is obtained by selecting a spacing between the elements on the 
order of d/λmin = 1/2.
The effective radiated power of a phased array is the product of the antenna

The efficiency in ERP generation achievable with phased arrays can be demon-
strated by comparison with the ERP generated by a TWT connected to an antenna 
having the same spatial coverage as the phased array. In this case the antenna gain 
Gant is the same as the gain of the single radiating element of the array gel, and the

This result shows that, to provide the required ERP, an APA must have an in-
stalled power Parray that is 1/N the required installed power from a TWT. This fac-
tor is somewhat reduced taking into account the current lower efficiency of GaAs 
technology amplifiers (about 10%) with respect to TWTs (about 20%), but in any 
case a large advantage is gained from the active phased array solution in terms of 
mass, power consumption, and dissipation.
A typical architecture for a linear APA is shown in Figure 5.20. The APA is 
composed of a set of radiating elements directly connected to a set of active solid-
state T/R modules. The modules are connected to a beamforming network where 
the signals are processed at RF level to provide both the bearing error signals (in ac-
cordance with the monopulse technique) to the receiver unit as well as the emitter 
signal to a DRFM for the subsequent generation of jamming signals. An interface 
module, called the control interface (shown as selector) in the figure, allows for re-
ceiving and actuating the commands necessary to swiftly steer the APA beam to the 
threat direction as well as to manage the APA receiving and transmitting phases.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth (in dependence to the array length) and 
to the platform and threat kinematics, the commands that steer the unit toward 
each threat have to be constantly updated to ensure that the threat angle tracking 
is correct. Bearing error signals processed by the beamformer receiver are subse-
quently processed at the video level by means of a closed-loop control system, as

depicted in Figure 5.21, which compensates for platform maneuvers by receiving 
the platform navigation data.
The swift beam switching (tens of nanoseconds) among the various threat di-
rections is performed, on issuance of a PTOAG command, by the control interface 
board in which the updated directions of the M tracked threats are memorized. In 
addition, the relevant phase shift commands (depending on the threat frequency 
measurement) are evaluated and distributed to each T/R module. A typical imple-
mentation of a wideband moderate CW power output T/R module is shown in 
Figure 5.22.
Generally, a linear phased array is constituted by only one array of radiating 
elements, but other arrays of radiating elements can be added, as shown in Figure 
5.23. They are added either to achieve complete 360° horizontal coverage or to 
increase the elevation coverage by introducing an equivalent number of switchable 
outputs to the T/R module as shown in Figure 5.22. A typical implementation of 
an airborne, fan-cooled linear APA is shown in Figure 5.24.
Whenever very large ERPs are required, planar phased arrays can be employed. 
As shown in Appendix C, the lattice selected can be either rectangular or triangular 
(with spacing dx and dy, respectively, along the two-axis x and y of the array) and 
the steering of the beam in two dimensions is achieved by impressing to each ele-
ment i,j a phase shift ΔΨi,j of the type:

have a very large RCS (about 20 to 30 dB above the fighter aircraft one) and for 
mutual protection systems, both airborne (such as SOJ and EJ systems, as discussed 
in Section 5.1) and shipboard.

failure, MTBF), and mission criticality. Note that the APA’s performance degrades 
gracefully: the failure of 10% of the T/R modules results in less than a 1-dB loss 
in ERP. Note also from the table the further APA advantage of an increase in the 
integrated EW system’s (i.e., ESM/ECM) sensitivity and HADF capability due to its 
monopole beamformer network.
A large ERP wideband APA for ship self-protection is shown in Figure 5.25. 
Large planar APAs can produce multiple independent beams, both on reception as 
well on transmission, by using an appropriate complex beamforming network or 
by partitioning the planar array into subarrays. Overlapped transmitting beams 
require that the output T/R module amplifier operate in linear mode, and this mode 
strongly reduces the beam ERP. If a small number of simultaneous, even overlapped 
in time, beams have to be produced, the partition of the planar array into subarrays 
is convenient and also reducing the complexity of the beamforming network. Fig-
ure 5.26 shows an implementation of four independent beams from a planar APA 
that uses a monopulse measurement beamforming network.
The architecture of a large ERP RECM, such as the SOJ or the EJ, is very simi-
lar to the SPJ one described above. A schematic block diagram of an EJ configura-
tion is shown in Figure 5.27. SOJ equipment can be installed either internally in a 
wide-body aircraft or within the belly pod of a large fighter aircraft. In the latter 
case, the pod has to be autonomous; that is, it has to be provided with cooling and 
an electrical power generator, powered by a ram air turbine generator, because a 
fighter A/C usually cannot cope with such large incremental requirements. To pro-
vide a jammed corridor for the intruder aircraft, the SOJ usually has to loiter about 
the direction of the intruder corridor. Therefore, the SOJ is composed of two large 
planar APAs, one on each longitudinal side of the pod and each covering a spatial 
sector. The spatial section is quite wide in azimuth but narrow in elevation, due to 
the far distance of operation of the SOJ aircraft with respect to the victim surveil-
lance radars. The two APAs, usually operating in the low-frequency radar band

typical of surveillance radars, are switched on and off alternatively in accordance 
with the side looking at the intruder corridor. The large, wide azimuth sector and 
smart types of maneuvers performed by the aircraft while performing 180° turns 
help to minimize the jamming silence periods.
EJ equipment as well is usually installed in the belly or pylon pods of fighter 
aircraft that penetrate the adversary’s territory together with the intruder aircraft. 
Because the EJs are within this territory, they usually need complete azimuth and 
radar frequency band coverage. Due to the large number of threats to be countered

5.5  Chaff 
289
during their mission, EJ systems are provided with a large number of jamming re-
sources (DRFMs and simultaneous APA beams) to counter threats. 
5.5  Chaff
Chaff is a form of volumetric radar clutter composed of a very large number (up 
to millions) of small, metallized and shorted tuned dipole antennas. The dipoles 
are cut at about λ/2 to achieve the maximum ratio of RCS to weight of used mate-
rial. These antennas are dispensed into the atmosphere to confuse or disrupt radar 
operation. Chaff is used either to create a corridor in the air space controlled by a 
surveillance radar to conceal some intruder aircraft penetrating into enemy territory 
or to provide self-protection to aircraft or ships when subject to illumination by 
tracking radar, such as anti-aircraft artillery, SAMs, or AAM seekers.
A complete discussion about the creation of chaff corridors and the relevant 
chaff characteristics is given in [14], which we recommend to the interested reader. 
Here it suffices to recall that chaff is dispensed at high altitudes (higher than 10 km) 
and at a steady rate along quite a long path, so as to fill a large clutter volume that 
persists for many hours due to the small fall-down rate of the dipoles. Average chaff 
fall rate is on the order of 0.6 m/s for aluminized glass chaff dipoles, which are the 
most used type for this application. But the rate can be much higher depending 
on weather conditions or lower, mainly because of wind conditions. In fact, when 
chaff is launched from an airborne dispenser, the drag is much greater than gravity 
so that the chaff foils move at the air mass velocity, and the chaff cloud grows in 
volume under the effects of prevailing winds and air turbulence.
In the chaff cloud the λ/2 dipoles are randomly oriented with respect to the 
illuminating radar polarization, and the average RCS of N randomly oriented di-
poles in the radar resolution cell is [6] σav = 0.15Nλ2. Schleher [6] shows that it is 
not difficult to produce a sufficient chaff RCS (RCSc) to conceal a large intruder 
aircraft of RCS0, say, RCSc ≥ 10RCS0, within the radar resolution cell of volume V 
= R2θBφB cτ/2, where R is the distance from the radar; θB and φB are, respectively, 
the azimuth and elevation –3-dB antenna beamwidths; c is the light speed; and τ is 
the subpulse duration of the pulse compressed waveform used by the radar. This 
concealment is not difficult as the required number of dipoles constitutes a low 
weight and hence are easy to dispense. Note that due to the turbulence produced 
by the prevailing winds during fall-down of the dipoles, the dipoles can assume any 
orientation in the chaff cloud. The dipoles that remain vertical (due to gravity) fall 
more rapidly than the dipoles whose original vertical orientation has changed to a 
horizontal one, leaving them subject to the forces of the wind. Hence, some time af-
ter dispensing, two chaff layers are formed with different prevailing polarizations: 
an upper layer in horizontal polarization and a lower level in vertical polarization. 
Because, however, the chaff fall-down rate and prevailing wind speeds are quite 
low, the chaff cloud can be assimilated to a nearly stationary clutter, which can be 
easily removed by either medium PRF (MPRF) PD or adaptive MTI Doppler signal 
processing, both of which are often used in current surveillance radars [1]. Note, 
however, that cancellation of chaff prevents the use of frequency agility in long-
range surveillance radars and this can be exploited by repeater jammers producing 
false credible targets (see Chapter 6). Even so this type of airborne chaff application 

290 
���������������������������������

is not used as much today1 and the use of chaff by airborne platforms is almost 
exclusively for self-protection.
Self-protection chaff is used both by aircraft and ships, although with quite 
different characteristics with regard to blooming time, useful life, and the required 
producible RCS. For aircraft the size of a dispenser cartridge is 30 × 30  × 15 mm 
(i.e., a volume V = 1.35  × 10–7 m3. The size of a cylindrical chaff foil resonant at 
λ = 0.03m is v = ( λ/2) (πd2/4) where the diameter d is usually 1/1000 of the dipole 
length. Hence, v = 3.375 × 10–13 m3. Therefore, the number of chaff dipoles within 
a cartridge, assuming a high packing density of 50%, is N = 0.5V/v = 20 × 106. This 
produces a RCSc = 0.15Nλ2 = 765m2. Because the aluminum density is 2.5 kg/dm3, 
the weight of the dipoles in a cartridge is only about 16.5g. 
Chaff payload is usually a mix of different individual dipole lengths. This mix 
allows for a response over a large range of radar frequencies. A single length re-
sponds effectively to its resonant frequency at its second and third harmonics.
The most common method of dispensing chaff rounds from aircraft is by 
means of a small explosive charge (squib) placed at the base of the cartridge, with 
the chaff foils contained in a plastic case. The chaff cartridge’s squib is electrically 
initiated, and the gases produced by the explosion eject the chaff out of the aircraft. 
The initial thrust provides a distance of a few meters and then the chaff dispersion 
is provided by the airflow conditions and the turbulence within the wake of the 
aircraft.
Aircraft self-protection chaff is used to produce a break-lock to the STT. The 
break-lock is achieved by creating a number of false targets in proximity to the ac-
tual target within the radar resolution cell (RRC) of volume V = R2θBφB cτ/2. The 
false targets are produced by a series of chaff bursts (called a salvo) within a short 
time (tens of microseconds) due to the high aircraft closing speed to the STT and 
the reduced size of the resolution cell at least in range (ΔR = cτ/2) due to the radar 
waveform pulse compression technique. The short times of the salvo are made 
possible by modern digitally controlled dispensers, which are called chaff and flare 
dispensers (CFDs) because they are also used to dispense flares, see Section 5.7.1). 
The dispensing of the chaff salvo is usually accompanied by an aircraft maneuver 
in order to orient the aircraft speed at 90° with respect to the radar beam boresight, 
both to reduce the cancellation capabilities of radar Doppler signal processing (the 
target signal is now competing with the stationary clutter) and to exploit the large 
cross-range of the RRC [7].
In ship self-protection chaff is dispensed both to distract as well to dilute the 
RRC. Distraction is used during the acquisition phase of the STT by creating a num-
ber of false targets at locations different from the one of the protected platform. 
Chaff dispensing is coordinated with the action of a noise jammer that produces 
a range-gate break-lock to the STT. Dilution involves a large chaff RCS (much 
higher than the ship’s RCS) within the same RRC in order to lock the RRC to the 
chaff cloud, which is moving at the speed of the wind (much closer to the ship’s 
speed) while the ship is maneuvering to get away from the RRC. Chaff for ship

In the era after World War II, chaff corridors were used primarily by the Soviet Union, which no longer 
conducts large-scale defensive or offensive exercises with countermeasures. Extensive attacks in which 
chaff is combined with noise jamming are quite effective because the available ECCM techniques (see 
Chapter 6) that are effective against one countermeasure tend to be ineffective against another.

self-protection is dispensed in large quantities (on the order of a few kilograms) by 
means of rockets that can reach long distances from the ship. 
5.6  Communication ECM Systems
The main objective of CECM systems is to deny, over a defined area and by means 
of jamming, the transportation of information performed in symmetric conflicts 
through the RF links of an adversary’s communication systems, and in asymmetric 
conflicts through the broadcasting communication services (FM radio and analog 
and digital TV).
The most important adversarial RF links to be jammed are the ones that are 
connected to the command and control centers (C2). As discussed in Chapter 2, 
modern communication systems use mostly digital modulations, but a large num-
ber of legacy communication systems that employ analog modulations are still 
available, especially in the battlefield area. In the descriptions of the architecture 
and jamming techniques of CECM systems that follow, both types of modulation 
are taken into account.
The effectiveness of a jamming action against communications (i.e., the denial 
of the information) is measured by the ratio of jammer (J) to signal (S) power, J/S 
or JSR, at the input of the victim receiver and, in general, that ratio is required to 
be JSR > 1. In the case of analog-modulated signals (usually voice communication, 
either FM or AM), Poisel [8] has shown that to make a voice message unintelligible 
it is sufficient either to jam at JSR > 1 for about 30% of the duration of the mes-
sage or to jam continuously along the duration of the message with a JSR ≥ –15 dB 
for AM voice and JSR ≥ –6 dB for FM voice. Because the number of simultaneous 
channels in a battlefield is large, it is usually convenient to jam in time sharing three 
channels.
For digital modulations the unintelligibility of the transmitted message is 
achieved by increasing the bit error rate (BER) of the channel, which is usually 
rather low (<10–3) to >10–1. This can be accomplished either by jamming a continu-
ous broadcasting digital signal for more than 10% of the time or by using some 
type of modulations (such as BFSK) with JSR ≥  –5dB as discussed in [1, 8].
When discussing JSR it is important to underline the big difference between 
the ratios of RECM ERP to the victim radar one and of CECM ERP to the victim 
communication link. This difference is related to the type of propagation used by 
their victim sensors: Radars use two-way propagation, whereas communication 
links use one-way propagation. To evaluate this difference, let us consider  typical 
CECM operation in free-space as depicted in Figure 5.28, where the communica-
tion transmitter (Tx) and the CECM are, respectively, at a distance RTR and RJR 
from the receiver. The signal power received at the communication receiver (Rx) Pr, 
t from its transmitter can be expressed as:

where PtGt = ERPt are, respectively, the transmitted power, antenna gain, and ef-
fective radiated power of the transmitter; and Gr is the receiver antenna gain in the 
direction of the transmitter. Correct operation of the RF link is the reception of the 
transmitted signal with SNR = Pr,t/N > 20 dB, where N = kTBrF is the noise power 
within the receiver channel bandwidth Br, which is usually a very low power level.

where PjGj = ERPj are, respectively, the transmitted power, antenna gain, and ef-

direction of the jammer. Thus, in the presence of jamming, the signal power S must 
compete with the jamming power J, which is much larger than the noise power level 
N. The condition in which the jamming is effective is expressed by JSR > k, depend-
ing on the type of modulation, which means:

where Bj > Br is the jammer signal bandwidth. From this expression it appears that 
usually Gr,j < Gr (that is the case with directive receiver antennas) and the ratio Br/
Bj is always less than 1. Unless the jammer is much closer to the receiver than the 
transmitter, the ERPj must be larger than ERPt (that is seldom the case for effective 
RECM). 
The above considerations are further reinforced by taking into account that 
at low frequencies (up to a few hundred megahertz) and low heights for the Tx,

CECM, and Rx, the propagation model no longer has an attenuation on the order 
of R–2 (i.e., spherical); instead it is on the order of R–4 to R–6 [8]. This is because of 
the many reflections that can occur when the transmitter and/or receiver are close 
to the Earth’s surface.

of the points whose path difference is λ/2 from the two above antennas, which are 
the foci ) first touches a point of reflection on the ground. Indeed, after reflection 
from the ground, the reflected ray amplitude assumes a constant π radians shift of 
phase that may provide a destructive contribution to the direct ray at the receiver.

Although in (5.21) the receiver power is independent of frequency, both the 
gain Gr and Gt (embedded in ERPt) are dependent on frequency. Table 5.3 reports 
distance D1(km) for various antenna heights vs. frequency.
Due to the relative short effective jamming range, as shown earlier, CECMs are 
mainly employed in ground battlefield applications and are of the following types:
•• Ground jammers, 
•• Expendable jammers, 
•• Stand-in jammers (SIJs) on board unmanned aerial systems (UASs).
Expendable jammers are usually small units with a limited operational life 
(that of their batteries) and with a small ERP. They are placed close to the victim 
receiver by either commando troops or by being launched by artillery and switched 
on by an RF command.

Electronic Countermeasure Systems
SIJs installed on board UASs are the most effective CECMs because they are 
very near the victim receiver and are not affected by the strong R–4 attenuation due 
to their operational height. Further, their proximity to the receiver allows them 
to use many effective jamming programs (such as a follower jammer; see Chapter 
6), which is not possible with CECMs at a far distance from the victim receiver. 
Airborne SIJs cannot be provided with a large ERP. Usually, the transmitter pow-
er is about 100W for power consumption and heat removal constraints and no 
high-gain antennas appropriate to the VHF/UHF bands can be installed on board 
aircraft. For these reasons when jamming is required over large areas, ground jam-
mers, even if provided with low-height antennas, are favored because they are ca-
pable of being providing a high ERP on the order of 20kW with the employment 
of high-gain antennas. 
CECM operations in the battlefield must be accurately planned and synchro-
nized because the spectrum occupation is so dense that the use of large bandwidth 
jamming may result in fratricide. For this reason the architecture of the CECM has 
to envisage the presence of a complete CESM, which can be either integrated with 
the CECM or functionally connected to it to allow the correct (i.e., not fratricide) 
jamming operation.
The schematic block diagram of the CECM is depicted in Figure 5.29. It is 
composed of four main blocks: 
1.	 The processor manages the system resources (power management) and is 
connected to the CESM equipment, which provides continuous monitoring 
of the environment spectrum (in order to avoid fratricide jamming). 
2.	 The exciter is composed of a frequency synthesizer, which provides the 
carrier frequency of the jamming signal, and technique modulators, which 
provide jamming modulations (e.g., PRN FM). The exciter operates at a 
low power level and is sometimes called the low-power RF section. Cur-
rent synthesizers are either based on DDS oscillators or a PLL controlling a 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).
3.	 The power amplifier has at least two sections, each dedicated to a band-
width of the CECM. Each section has either a number of parallel solid-state 
basic power amplifiers, usually operating in Class AB and combined in 
Figure 5.29  Typical architecture of a CECM.

output, or a series of basic power amplifiers, each providing a gain contri-
bution to the chain. Both solutions are capable of providing a large power 
output.
4.	 The antenna is usually made of a couple of log-periodic antennas capable 
of covering the complete RF bandwidth from 30 to 3000 MHz. Additional 
antennas and power amplifiers are required to cover the HF (3- to 30-
MHz) band.
5.7  Infrared ECM Systems
The current prime threat to aircraft, also called the “90% threat” since 90% of all 
aircraft losses in battle in the past 35 years were caused by them, is the IR sensor-
guided missile. They have become the current prime threat to aircraft only because, 
for the past 35 years, most large-scale air operations have been conducted after 
intensive SEAD operations have neutralized radar-guided SAMs. Before suppres-
sion of radar-guided SAMs was achieved, flying low to avoid them made aircraft 
vulnerable to MANPADS. After they were suppressed, the residual IR weapons 
continued to take their toll over subsequent protracted operations. IR missiles are 
much more important in asymmetric warfare, where the enemy has no radar-guided 
SAMs. But in any major air war, the longer-range radar-guided SAMs and AAMs 
remain the prime threat. IR missiles are not only employed against aircraft; they 
also constitute a threat to armored vehicles and ships (see the description of antiship 
missiles in Chapter 1).
IR missile technology has evolved rapidly over the years and can be classified 
into three early generations up to the current fourth generation. The vast major-
ity of the IR missiles being deployed belong to the first (spin scan reticle) and 
second generations (conical scan reticle), which, as discussed in Section 2.6.2, use 
a relatively simple IR seeker capable of providing target angular tracking through 
appropriate rotating reticles. The principle of operation is based on the transforma-
tion by means of the rotating reticles of the IR energy from the target as collected 
by the seeker optics into an AM or FM electrical signal at the seeker IR detector. 
This signal, when compared with the reticle angular reference signals, provides the 
target angular information with respect to the optics boresight and is provided to 
the missile guidance system to home in on the target.
The subsequent third generation adopted a pulse position modulation (PPM) 
through a rosette scan reticle to provide the target’s angular information. The fourth 
generation uses an imaging focal plane array to provide the two targets’ angular 
coordinates to the missile guidance system. For a general description of reticles and 
IR missiles, further to the discussion Section 2.6.2, we recommend Ref. [9].
The initial period countermeasure (against the first- and second-generation IR 
missiles) was the use of expendables (flares). These were launched from the de-
fended platform in order to seduce the IR seeker toward a more radiation intense 
and appealing target. The development of more intelligent IR seekers, such as the 
last seekers of the second generation and third- and fourth-generation seekers, that 
can discriminate the targets from the flares has motivated the development of ac-
tive jamming systems, such as IRCMs.

296

Electronic Countermeasure Systems
Because IR seekers are purely passive, it is not possible to determine in which 
IR bandwidth its receiver operates. However, because IR seekers are primarily sen-
sitive in the 2- to 5-μm (mid-IR) wavelength band (i.e., the wavelength regions of 
aircraft engines’ and exhaust gases’ energy radiation), the active IRCMs have to be 
provided with simultaneous multiband high-intensity flash lamps or laser sources 
operating in the same bandwidth.
Two jamming principles are employed by an active IRCM: deception and satu-
ration/destruction of the IR missile seeker detector, both of which provide the IR 
missile’s angular tracking break-lock. Table 5.4 reports on the efficiency of the two 
jamming techniques vs. the various IR missile generations.
Deception is achieved by generation of an IR signal of higher intensity than 
the target IR signature (i.e., a jamming to signal ratio >>1), but with different 
AM or FM at the same scanning rate of the reticle to provide an angular error to 
the IR detector. This deception technique (a wobbled waveform) is very similar to 
the angular pull-off technique applied by the RECM against the COSRO tracking 
radar, as described in Chapter 6. Deception is provided either by a number of high-
intensity flash lamps that instantaneously cover a wide spatial coverage (the flash 
lamps are usually preventively activated during the take-off and landing phases of 
the defended aircraft) or by a lower intensity directionally radiating flash lamp or 
laser source aimed against the incoming IR missile through an angular closed loop 
tracking that is guided by an IR detector very similar to the IR missile one. This 
latter type of jammer, called a directional IR countermeasure (DIRCM), has to be 
activated upon the angular designation provided by a missile warning or approach 
system (see Section 2.6.3) about the approach of the attacking IR missile.
Saturation of the IR missile detector and its AGC loop (also called dazzling) is 
achieved through a high-power laser DIRCM. Damage to or destruction of the IR 
missile sensor detector or even the frosting of the IR dome that encloses the seeker 
optics is achieved by a very-high-power laser DIRCM. The required laser power 
levels are reported in Table 5.5
Antisensor laser DIRCMs exhibit advantages over flash lamps due to their 
laser-directed energy (small laser beam divergence) and the laser source wavelength 
tunability in the IR missile seeker bandwidth. The latter is obtained by combining a 
laser with wavelength conversion devices, usually exploiting the second-order non-
linearity of a crystalline material, such as lithium niobate (Li NbO3), to accomplish 
optical parametric generation (OPG), that is, the generation of two signals at larger 
wavelengths than the input or laser pump signal. Fiber lasers are the most used 
source due to their high efficiency, absence of water cooling, compact and robust 
package, and human eye–safe radiation levels.

From this equation we can see that the required laser power for deception is 
independent of distance R and dependent only on the target radiation contrast, 
provided that the missile optics off-axis rejection is moderate; that is, the DIRCM 
angular tracking loop is quite accurate.
The schematic block diagram of a laser DIRCM is shown in Figure 5.30. The 
laser/flash lamp DIRCM system is composed of three main functional blocks: the 
missile warning system (MWS), the system processor, and the laser/flash lamp tur-
ret. Some DIRCM systems also have flare dispenser that is activated by the system 
processor.
Figure 5.30  Schematic block diagram of a laser DIRCM.

5.7  Infrared ECM Systems 
299
The angular threat designation to the laser/flash lamp DIRCM is provided by 
the MWS (see Section 2.6), which is composed of either an IR sensor (which detects 
the heat energy produced by the missile plume) or an UV sensor (which detects the 
energy of the spectral lines of missile propellant). On receipt of the angular designa-
tion, the processor addresses the laser/flash lamp turret to the designated angular 
direction. The turret has pointer/transmitter optics that track and jam the incom-
ing IR missile. The pointer is provided with an IR detector focal plane array that 
performs very fine DF measurements of the heat energy produced by the missile 
plume. These measurements serve as the inputs to the servo-loop of the turret driv-
en by the processor. The laser/flash lamp generator is provided with a multiband 
energy source that produces the AM jamming IR energy (usually a wobbulated AM 
high prf waveform), which is delivered to the transmitter optics.
The missile engagement by a DIRCM lasts a very short period—just a few 
seconds, as shown in the graph of Figure 5.31—so all DIRM functions have to be 
swiftly accomplished, especially the slewing of the turret to the missile DOA and 
the transmission of the wobbled jamming waveforms. An ELT 572 laser DIRCM 
turret is shown in Figure 5.32.

5.7.1  Flares
Flares are expendable IR decoys that are deployed by aircraft and ships to seduce 
the attacking IR missiles to a position safely distant from the defended platform. 
On-board aircraft flares are deployed from the same cartridge dispenser used for 
aircraft self-protection chaff. The flares have a cartridge size (50 × 25 × 200 mm) 
known as MJU7B in the United States or 218 in the United Kingdome that is identi-
cal to that of chaff cartridges. Other nations use different sizes for their cartridges, 
but the dispenser for both expendables is the same and is called a chaff and flare 
dispenser (CFD). Due to their low relative cost with respect to the on-board active 
ECMs, CFDs are always present on board aircraft and frequently they constitute 
the only aircraft ECM.
Flares employ the same type of electrically initiated squib as is used in chaff 
cartridges, but because the flare pellet is mainly composed of a magnesium (which 
immediately ignites in presence of oxygen in the atmosphere) and aluminum/Teflon 
powder bonded together by the binder material Viton (hence, the acronym MTV 
for magnesium-Teflon-Viton), the ignition mechanism is quite different from the 
chaff mechanism in order to prevent inadvertent or precocious ignition of the flare 
within the aircraft. In fact, the flare pellet is contained in a can and is activated by 
a sequencer/shutter mechanism that is composed of a piston placed at the base of 
the pellet. Upon squib ignition, the expanding gases move the piston, which drives 
the pellet and the sequencer out of the can. When out of the can, the shutter is re-
moved, allowing the magnesium to ignite.

5.7  Infrared ECM Systems 
301
Because most IR seekers can distinguish magnesium flares, the composition 
of modern flares is being changed to mimic the spectrum of the aircraft they are 
defending. The main characteristics of aircraft flares are as follows:
•• Radiation intensity (W/sr) in the seeker bandwidth (ranging from hundreds 
of watts per steradian to kilowatts per steradian depending on the aircraft to 
be defended—helicopters or fighter aircraft), 
•• Activation or rise time (usually a few tens of milliseconds to reach the peak 
radiation intensity),
•• Persistence of radiation (usually 3 to 6 sec).
The IR threat is currently also present in some antiship RF missiles, which are 
starting to incorporate IR homing seekers in order to provide a more accurate final 
phase of flight to the target. The principal sources of IR energy in a ship are the en-
gine room and the stack, which in most warship designs are placed at the center of 
the ship and thus the center of the ship constitutes the most appealing position for 
missile impact. The seduction of IR missile homing to a position far from the ship 
is provided [10] either by a series of flare subrounds that detonate progressively at 
increasing range from the ship (a sort of walk-off technique, which is discussed in 
Chapter 6) or in addition to the first technique by a number of subround floating 
smoke pots (on the sea surface) deployed from the same previous subrounds, which 
allow the buoying of decoys above the sea surface. Both techniques are performed 
by the NATO decoy launching system Sea Gnat. The Sea Gnat launches rounds 
from an Mk 36 deck-mounted multibarrel launcher. A pictorial representation of 
the countermeasure is shown in Figure 5.33.
Naval IR rounds differ from aircraft ones in the use of phosphorous-based 
materials because of their size when they bloom, which needs to nearly equate to 
the defended ship’s size, and for their persistence, which is on the order of 30 to 60 
sec (larger than the period of a missile engagement). Further the naval IR rounds 
are required to radiate in both the mid-IR band (3 to 5 μm) as well as the far-IR 
band (8 to 14 μm) with the proper radiant intensity ratio between the two bands to 
counter the bicolor seeker discrimination technique [10].

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
6.1  Introduction
The active ECM systems discussed in the previous chapter are placed on board mili-
tary platforms (aircraft, naval surface craft, ground vehicles, and even buildings) 
and, through the use of RF or IR transmissions, are meant to disrupt the operation 
of hostile threat radars and IR guided missile systems and to inhibit communica-
tions among forces. 
The techniques used by active ECM systems can be classified as either jam-
ming or deception techniques. Jamming is defined as “the intentional and deliber-
ate transmission of signals with the purpose of disturbing, masking or otherwise 
degrading the reception of the useful signal by the sensor system” [1]. Deception is 
defined as “the intentional and deliberate transmission of signals with the purpose 
of misleading in the interpretation or use of the information by the sensor system” 
[1]. Active ECM systems generally have a set of jamming and deception techniques 
that are fixed or set on a mission basis. In some modern systems sophisticated DSP 
can even make selections and set parameters in real time in accordance with the 
threat/platform engagement situation.
In this book ECM techniques are described to the extent needed for an under-
standing of active ECM effectiveness, and the parameters of the waveforms associ-
ated with the techniques are based on the general physics of the engagement rather 
than on countering a specific sensor (radar or IR seeker or communication receiv-
er). In this chapter we first deal with the ECM techniques applicable against radar, 
which is the key sensor in most modern weapons systems employed on land, sea 
surface, and air platforms. We begin with a discussion of the ECM techniques used 
against surveillance radars and follow that up with the techniques used against the 
tracking radars and RF-guided missile seekers. We also discuss the effects of the 
many ECCM techniques employed in the two above-mentioned radar types and the 
applicable modifications to the ECM techniques to cope with them.
In the second part of the chapter, the discussion covers the ECM techniques 
that are used against modern communication systems, beginning with digital tacti-
cal data links and their relevant ECCM techniques and following with RF-initiated 
improvised explosive devices.

6.2  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Surveillance Radars 
and Related ECCMs
As discussed in Chapter 2, a surveillance radar’s functions are to detect and locate 
the position of a target within a large coverage volume. In Chapter 2 we discussed 
the basic structures of such devices, ranging from the basic 2-D search radar type 
to advanced 3-D and phased array radar types. We also discussed a surveillance 
radar’s signal processing techniques, including coherent transmission modes (and 
relevant Doppler signal processing, up to the airborne PD technique) and pulse 
compression techniques (up to the use of LPI waveforms). Coverage of this material 
was preparatory to the discussions about the interception, classification, identifica-
tion, and direction finding by ESM systems, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. In this 
chapter we discuss the ECCM techniques introduced in these radars to resist the 
ECM techniques employed by the RECM systems discussed in Chapter 5.
Conceptually, we can model a surveillance radar as a rotating antenna with 
either a wide beam (2-D) or multiple beams (3-D) in elevation, whose narrow main 
beam sequentially scans the complete azimuth (or a sector) while its sidelobes re-
ceive responses from all directions. In accordance with this model, jamming can be 
produced by RECM systems through the continuous transmission of noise wave-
forms into the radar antenna that increase the receiver noise level, thus strongly 
reducing the target SNR and possibly even completely masking the target (depend-
ing on its distance from the radar as shown by the jamming equations of Chap-
ter 5). Similarly, deception can be performed by RECM systems by using replicas 
produced by DRFMs of the actual radar waveform. This produces a large number 
of false targets that saturate the radar automatic detection and tracking (ADT) 
processing [2]. Deceptive false targets are competing only against the radar receiver 
noise and hence can be generated at a relatively low jamming power.
Modern surveillance radars, in addition to the signal processing techniques 
discussed in Chapter 2, employ a number of ECCM techniques to reduce the ef-
fects of the above-mentioned ECM techniques. They are discussed in the following 
subsections.
6.2.1  Frequency Agility in Transmission
When applied in pulse-to-pulse mode, the jamming noise bandwidth can be com-
pelled to equate the complete radar frequency agility bandwidth (usually on the 
order of about 10% of the central frequency), thus spreading the jammer power 
into a barrage noise bandwidth and reducing the target masking effectiveness, as 
shown in Figure 6.1. Similarly, it compels the deceptive false targets (the replicas) 
to be produced only at distances beyond than that of the jammer, identified as RJ 
in Figure 6.2.
6.2.2  PRI Agility
PRI agility has the same effect as frequency agility with respect to the deceptive false 
targets.

6.2.3  Ultralow Sidelobes
Ultralow sidelobes are the sidelobe levels far from the mainlobe (on the order of 
–20 dB with respect to the isotropic level). They strongly reduces the noise jamming 
level coming from the sidelobes and compels the RECM equipment to strongly in-
crease its ERP to produce effective deceptive false targets.
6.2.4  Multiple-Sidelobe Cancellers
The sidelobe canceller (SLC) is an additional receiving adaptive antenna system 
capable of strongly reducing the continuous noise jamming power received in the 
sidelobes of the radar antenna. This reduction is achieved by controlling the over-
all (i.e., radar antenna and additional antenna system) receiving antenna pattern 
and placing a null in the direction of the jammer(s). Usually an additional antenna 
system such as this is implemented with a linear array of elementary radiators (di-
poles), each connected to a receiving channel in which both the gain and the phase 
shift are adaptively controlled, as shown in Figure 6.3. Suboptimal results can be 
achieved with phase shift only control. The basic principle of the adaptive array can

where E(·) denotes the expected value operator (or time average in the case of sto-
chastic processes) and nk and nr are the receiver noise samples taken at the same 
time in the kth and rth receiving channels. The matrix element mk,r is therefore an 
index of the spatial correlation of the noise jamming samples received by the cor-
responding receiver channels, and M–1 is the inverse of such a matrix.
Hence, the procedure to determine the optimal weights for the cancellation of 
the received noise jamming power consists of three steps:

308 
��������������������������������
ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
1.	 Estimation of the spatial correlation of the signals received by any two ele-
ments of the array. The estimation process is performed in a period long-
er than the receiver noise correlation period and the time duration of the 
transmitted waveform, in order to avoid the cancellation of the desired 
signal.
2.	 Computation of the inverse covariance matrix M, which can be quite time 
consuming depending on the size m of the array.
3.	 Multiplication of the matrix M–1 by the vector s*.
In the past, the most often used methods for the determination of optimal 
weights were time iterative methods, also called closed-loop methods such as the 
Applebaum-Howel-Brennan (AHB) method [3]. Currently, due to the increase in 
computing capabilities, methods for computing the inverse of the covariance ma-
trix directly are being employed. These methods are called open-loop methods.
In any case the evaluation of the optimum weights for noise jamming cancel-
lation requires a transient time for the estimation of the spatial correlation of the 
signal received at the elements. This transient time lasts a number of durations of 
the transmitted waveform. Reference [4] reports typical noise jammer cancellation 
ratio (JCR) values on the order of 30 dB, seldom up to 40 dB. 
Examples of typical performances for the AHB method, whose basic principle 
is shown in Figure 6.4, are reported [2] in Figures 6.5 and 6.6.
6.2.5  Sidelobe Blanker 
The sidelobe blanker (SLB) is an additional receiving channel. It is provided with 
an auxiliary antenna (usually a semi-omni antenna) whose function is to prevent 
the detection of strong targets and interfering jammer pulses (as they might appear 
after pulse compression) entering the radar receiver through the antenna sidelobes. 
The schematic block diagram of a SLB is shown in Figure 6.7.
By properly selecting the auxiliary channel gain Gaux, any pulse coming from 
the sidelobe region is received by the auxiliary channel with a level exceeding that 
of the same signal as received by the main antenna and thus can be suppressed. 
The SLB acts on a single-pulse basis and for each radar range bin. Only signals 
entering through the radar’s main beam are allowed to proceed along the further 
radar signal processing. The target detection performance of the SLB in terms of 
PD and PFA vs. the SNR and JNR have been analyzed in [4], to which we address 
the interested reader.
A further fix implementation in modern search radars is the use of a range filter 
map (RFM) associated with each channel (radar and auxiliary). The RFM is a 2D 
map that collects the radar echoes of all range cells (after pulse compression) and 
all Doppler filter outputs of a radar burst. The two independently collected RFMs 
are then compared in order to compare, in the case of overlapping range cells, the 
Doppler contents and thus discriminate the target from the false target produced 
by a RECM.
The joint cascaded operation of a SLB and SLC, as shown in Figure 6.8, is 
indeed a very powerful ECCM and cannot be defeated with the employment of 
a single ESJ. A number of ESJs (at least three) operating in synchronous mode 
through the use of a proper triggering link among the aircraft is required. Each ESJ

upon synch-command should alternately transmit a noise waveform of sufficient 
length (in terms of radar waveform width τ) while the other(s) should transmit 
large-amplitude false credible targets (i.e., replicas of the radar waveform with the 
correct Doppler shift, so as to deceive the above-mentioned RFM).
6.2.6  Adaptive Arrays 
In this type of radar the principle of jammer cancellation is similar to that of mul-
tiple SLC operation, but, with respect to the latter, multiple SLC offer the capabil-
ity of enhancing the target signal while canceling the disturbance. To achieve this

waveform duration (in this case, a pulse).

capability, space-time adaptive processing (STAP; see also Chapter 2) is employed 
that combines receive beamforming and Doppler filtering.
The operation of STAP involves the use of N antennas in the beamforming 
(which theoretically provides N – 1 degrees of freedom; i.e., theoretically it can 
suppress up to N – 1 displaced jammers) and M transmitted coherent pulses to 
allow Doppler filtering. Fully adaptive phased arrays are not practically possible 
because a phased array radar needs a large number of receiving elements (on the 
order of thousands), so usually the elements are grouped in a reasonable number 
of subarrays, which feed the adaptive processor. The scheme and description of a 
phased array radar constituted by N = 24 subarrays is shown in [4].
The various ECCMs potentially available in surveillance radars and the func-
tions they enhance in order to remove or reduce the jamming and deception actions 
are shown in Figure 6.9 [2].
6.2.7  Noise Jamming
The objective of noise jamming is to produce an interference signal that masks the 
target signal completely. In principle, the optimal jamming signal should have the 
characteristics of receiver noise, that is, it should be as close as possible to a white 
Gaussian noise (WGN).
Noise jamming is classified by the ratio of jamming bandwidth Bj to the radar 
waveform bandwidth Br (which pulse compression techniques, if any, further re-
duce in accordance to the radar processing gain Gp). If the ratio Bj/Br is large, the

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
noise jamming is called barrage noise jamming; otherwise, if the ratio is small (on 
the order of 3 to 5) the noise jamming is called spot noise jamming. 
In theory, a large power WGN could be produced by power amplification of a 
low-power WGN produced by a bandpass-filtered electronic device (this technique 
is called direct noise amplification, DINA). Unfortunately, due to the deeply satu-
rated operation of power RF amplifiers, the large noise fluctuations of WGN will 
be clipped by the saturation level, thus eliminating the noise peaks that produce the 
false alarms in the victim radar receiver.
The usual way to produce a nearly WGN with large spiky fluctuations is to 
use a random frequency or phase-modulated waveforms that are not affected by 
the power amplifier saturation level. Note, however, that this is less effective in 
JNR because the radar azimuth correlation processing, such as the moving window 
integrator, strongly reduces its false target effects as shown in Figure 6.10. If this 
technique is used with the addition of a digital noise generated by regenerative shift 
register techniques, it can potentially be synchronized to the victim’s radar wave-
form, thus removing the above-mentioned advantage of the radar azimuth correla-
tion processing. This technique, when coupled to the generation of false random 
targets, produces a jamming technique, called smart jamming, that is resistant to 
the rejection provided by the SLB and SLC ECCM techniques [1]. Indeed the pulse-
type signals cannot be rejected by the SLC due to its short duration with respect to 
the SLC time constant (loop transient time), and the excessive number of random 
false targets would excessively blank the radar main-beam target returns as oper-
ated by the SLB. 
6.2.8  False Targets
This technique is applicable against search radars with constant antenna scan pe-
riod (ASP) and type (AST). It consists of replicas of the radar waveform sent within 
each PRI of the main beam (the so-called time-on-target, TOT) with two time de-
lays, τ1 and T1, both variable in time, that are applied, respectively, to: 
•• The received radar waveform in order to simulate a radial displacement of 
the false target,

ECCM techniques.

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
313
•• The initial time of the replica in order to simulate an azimuth displacement 
within the main beam (until the SLB does not blank the replica).
This technique is meant to produce a number of credible false targets to the 
radar ADT function and is enhanced by the combined synchronized operation of a 
couple of jammers slightly displaced in angle (on the order of one radar beamwidth). 
6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and 
Related ECCMs
Tracking radars, such as the single target tracker (STT) or multifunctional phased 
array radar (MFR), that perform multiple simultaneous target tracking, as shown in 
Chapter 2, are used to determine the polar coordinates [range R and both angular 
(θ, j)] of a target of interest with respect to the radar position, which is assumed 
to be the reference. The relevant measurements, which are performed at a high 
data rate (nearly continuously), have to be accurate to a fraction of its pulse width 
τ (transformed in length) and of its beamwidth θB and are used to plot the target 
movement and accurately derive its rate of change with respect to time  in order to 
guide the weapons systems to the successful interception of the targets.
Some types of tracking radars, such as those used for the command guidance 
of missiles or as illuminators for semiactive homing guidance, need only measure 
angular coordinates in order to maintain the target within the beamwidth of the 
radar antenna. Tracking radars achieve these required accuracies by using narrow 
beamwidths (θB < 2°) and pulse widths (or compressed pulse widths) on the order 
of a fraction of a microsecond (i.e., range accuracies on the order of 10m). Further

they improve the resolution and the accuracy of the future target positions by mea-
suring continuously or with a very high data renewal rate the position and motion 
of the tracked target.
Range tracking is performed through the early-late (E-L) gate tracking loop, 
which drives the early and late gates to a position where the energy levels in both 
gates are equal (this position corresponds to the peak amplitude of the matched fil-
ter to a rectangular pulse). Such tracking loops are usually designed to operate also 
with memory, which allows them to coast at the last measured range rate during 
periods of lost data (either due to jamming or signal fading).
During the tracking phase the range tracking loop bandwidth is on the order 
of a few tens of hertz (i.e., time constants on the order of tens of microseconds) 
in order to achieve the required measurement accuracies and protect the tracking 
from sudden interferences (e.g., such as that produced by chaff as discussed in 
Chapter 5).
Further, recall that to prevent any interference (even other targets) located at 
ranges different from the tracked range, the tracking gate generator must provide a 
tracking gate that has a width that is slightly larger than the total width of the E-L 
gates so as to isolate the return of the target of interest from any other signal. This 
tracking gate also determines which signal enters both the angle tracking gate as 
well as the AGC loop, which adjusts the gain of the receiver’s amplifiers to a level 
commensurate with the received power level of the tracked signal.
Therefore, the RECM jamming program must be capable of entering the radar 
receiver at the time dictated by the position of the radar range tracking gate in 
order to be effective.
From the above discussion it is evident that the jamming programs used by the 
RECM of the defended platform are different in the case of self-protection from 
those used for mutual protection. In the case of self-protection, the jamming signal 
has to be transmitted with a negligible delay after the interception of the radar sig-
nal at the jammer antenna.
The usual self-protection jamming program is a sequence of techniques per-
formed in order to deceive first the radar range tracking loop and in a second step 
the angular tracking loop, with the aim of producing a radar break-lock and hence 
delaying or avoiding the guidance of the weapons system associated with the STT 
or MFR.
6.3.1  Range Tracking Loop Deception 
Range tracking can be deceived by the range-gate pull-off (RGPO) technique, also 
called the range-gate walk-off (RGWO) technique. The objective of the RGPO tech-
nique is to move the range tracking gate away from the true target position to a 
position at which only the jamming signal is present. This implies that the RECM 
has to initially transmit the jamming signal as coincident as possible in time with the 
target return signal. This is accomplished within the RECM by placing the DRFM 
repeater as near as possible to its receiving antenna and by synthesizing a replica 
of the incoming pulse to be transmitted either by a separate transmitting antenna 
(quite isolated from the receiving one) or by the same receiving antenna switched 
to transmission. In the latter case the DRFM reconstructs the radar RF pulse from 
a small slice of the incoming pulse by transmitting (after the reception switch-off) a 

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
315
number of contiguous slices, to which a head-to-tail phase correction is applied in 
order to avoid the so called moding effect, which may provide severe JSR losses if 
the retransmitted slices are out of phase between them. This technique is called slice 
repeater mode. The schematic block diagrams of the two possible RECM configu-
rations are shown in Figure 6.11.
The immediate RECM replicas are transmitted for a sufficient period to cap-
ture the radar AGC to the level of the replicas (progressively higher than the target 
returns). Thereafter, the replicas are moved according to a pull-off rate from the 
actual target position (i.e., a progressively increasing range from the radar; or a less 
decreasing range, mimicking a decelerating target maneuver).
The pull-off rate has to be within the design capabilities of the tracking loop; 
that is, it has to be similar to a possible deceleration of the target. Otherwise, if it 
is larger, the tracking loop is unable to follow the walk-off and the tracking gate 
will return to its memorized position, which is the position of the actual target. The 
pull-off rate for an airborne RECM usually mimics a deceleration <3g (30 m/s2).
The range difference with respect to the actual target range is expressed as:

(6.8)
where t = 0 is the instant at which the pull-off rate is impressed after the capture of 
the AGC level.
The delayed replicas are synchronized with the arrival of the incoming radar 
pulse, and the false target movement is provided with elementary delay time steps 
(with a resolution on the order of <2 ns). Also the phase shift of the transmitted 
signal is corrected in accordance with the delay rate.
The time evolution of the RGPO program is shown in Figure 6.12. In Figure 
6.12(b) the impressed delay to the replica is shown. Typically, the maximum delay 
is designed so that Δrmax/(cτ/2)≥4, i.e., aT2 ≥ 4cτ, which for a pulse width of τ = 0.5 
μs and an acceleration a = 3g provides a total time of the program T = 6.3 sec and 
a distance Δrmax ≈ 600m.
Once the range gate is sufficiently distant from the actual target (i.e., a delay 
of more than one pulse width), angular deception techniques can be applied to the 
RECM signal. If the RGPO program were unable, for any reason, to capture the 
Figure 6.11  Schematic block diagrams of the two possible RECM configurations for the RGPO 
program.

��������������������������������
ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
radar range tracking gate, the subsequent RECM transmissions and modulations 
would be outside that gate and hence ineffective.
Because there is no means for the RECM system to determine that the RGPO 
program was successful in capturing the radar range tracking gate, the RGPO pro-
gram has to be recycled from the true target position to make another attempt at 
gate capture. The recycling of the program may be initiated as soon as the delay Δ 
of the first cycle is Δ ≥ 2τ. The first RGPO cycle, when it has reached its maximum 
delay, continues to transmit a replica from that position. Therefore, the RECM is 
transmitting two pulses for each intercepted pulse from the victim radar: One is in 
accordance with the RGPO recycling and the other is continuously positioned at 
the outer range of the RGPO program. This latter false target is referred as a hook 
or hold-out target. Without the hook target, the pull-off recycling may in some 
cases make useless angle jamming modulations, which are instead continuously 
applied to the hook target. This means that when the radar range tracking gate 
hooks onto it, the radar angle tracking loop is continuously exposed to the errone-
ous angle modulations.

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
317
A number of ECCM techniques are employed by the tracking radars to counter 
the RGPO technique. The most used is leading-edge (LE) range tracking, which is 
performed either by increasing the weight assigned to the early gate received power 
with respect to the late gate’s received power or by differentiating1 the incoming ra-
dar pulse and applying the E-L gate technique to the differentiated LE of the pulse. 
Both techniques track the target at the beginning of the early gate, thus strongly 
reducing the received power from the jammer due to its inherent retransmission de-
lay, which causes it to appear only at the late gate. To increase ECCM effectiveness, 
the tracking radar may also use jittered PRIs and, if possible, frequency agility or 
diversity in transmission, in order to prevent the prediction of the next pulse TOA 
and its carrier frequency.
Another much used ECCM technique is the addition of range guard gates on 
either side of the range tracking gate. The early and late gates are meant to assess 
whether a large noise cover pulse is present and the late gate only whether a RGPO 
program is in place. In both cases, for a limited period, the radar can keep track of 
the previous position of the true target and then pass to track-on-jam if the jam-
ming persists.
These ECCM enhancements are countered by the RECM with the transmis-
sion of a dual-mode jamming technique consisting of the overlapped transmission 
of a barrage noise cover pulse of duration equal to the PRI maximum jitter and of 
a pulse radar replica at the same radar carrier frequency. The jammer noise signal 
prevents the operation of any form of E-L gate tracking (because the E-L gate is 
floating within the cover pulse), while the second signal appears as an appealing 
target. To this pulse is applied the RGPO program, while the noise cover pulse is 
stopped as soon as the delayed replica is at a distance of 2τ from the actual target 
position. At the same time, the angle jamming modulations are applied to the radar 
pulse replicas.
Some PD fire control radars employ range tracking to provide a more accurate 
measurement of target range. They use a modified range tracker operation at the 
narrowband detection Doppler filter and thus the RGPO technique must be ap-
plied in conjunction with Doppler signal compensation. This technique is called 
velocity and range-gate pull-off (VRGPO).
In the case where the RECM has to counter an STT for mutual protection pur-
poses, the only applicable jamming technique is noise cover pulse. Noise jamming 
has to be applied for a short period—the required time for the protected platform 
to perform a rapid maneuver; otherwise, the jamming platform may be subject to 
track-on-jam by a weapons system or home-on-jam by a missile.
1.	
The use of an E-L gate applied to differentiated pulses compromises the performance of the radar range 
tracking because the received energy in each processed pulse is much lower with regard to the regular pulse 
due to the reduced target signal energy received and to the increase in the noise power level. Furthermore, 
as shown in Chapter 2, the position of the effective center of the target RCS is fluctuating due to the range 
glint and thus the LE can jitter in position by more than the transmitted delay of the RECM. In general, this 
technique is applied only in the presence of a very large RCS as is the case for an antiship missile seeker that 
is attacking a large ship. Simple calculations can be used to show that the decrease in the jammer power 
processed at the radar receiver, due to the RECM use of a barrage noise cover pulse, is partially compen-
sated for by the above incurred losses to the target radar signal.

6.3.2  RECM Techniques Used Against Radar Doppler Tracking
Doppler radars, either CW or PD, use Doppler filtering of the incoming target re-
turns to eliminate all other signals that may be at the same angle or even within the 
same range interval and to reduce any interference, intentional or nonintentional, 
that lies outside the target Doppler filter bandwidth. Target tracking is also per-
formed through Doppler frequency tracking by using a similar EL mechanism (now 
in the Doppler frequency domain) for the range tracking based on TOA as shown 
in Figure 6.13.
In the above scheme the VCO is properly set by the control loop at the fre-
quency that provides a zero output from the amplitude (i.e., the energy content) 
difference of the E-L Doppler filters. The Doppler tracking must be initialized after 
having measured in the target acquisition phase the Doppler frequency relevant to 
the target’s velocity and acceleration relative to the radar (f0 in Figure 6.13).
The extraction of the Doppler frequency information in PD/CW radars re-
quires the use of coherent processing intervals (CPIs) on the order of a few to 
many milliseconds, which typically include many pulse interval times of the radar 
transmission. RECM techniques exploit the CPI duration to generate signals at 
Doppler frequencies by phase modulating the incoming signal and retransmitting 
it either with the content of a number of Doppler frequencies (multiple false Dop-
pler targets, MFDT) in order to confuse the radar’s target acquisition or with the 
VGPO technique.
The objective of the VGPO technique is to capture the Doppler tracking gate 
away from the true position up to a position several filter bandwidths away (which 
is achieved with a false Doppler target of energy providing a JSR > 3 dB) and then 
apply the angle modulation pull-off techniques. As for the case of the range track-
ing gate, the pull-off rate of the false target must be within the design capabilities 
of the Doppler tracking loop, because the pull-off program represents either an 
accelerating or decelerating target with respect to the true target. Like the RGPO 
technique, due to the lack of knowledge, if the first cycle of the technique was suc-
cessful, the VGPO program is recycled, while a hook target is kept at the maximum

(or minimum) reached closing speed. The time evolution of the VGPO program is 
shown in Figure 6.14.
Because the rate of change of the Doppler frequency represents an acceleration 
[i.e., dfd/dt = k·dvc/dt = k a(t)[ and the closing speed is expressed as vc(t) = a(t)·t+ 
vc0, care must be taken that the final value of acceleration a(T) does not exceed the 
maximum acceleration value that can be developed with a target maneuver (i.e., 3g 
for an A/C with pilot, 15g for an unmanned A/C such as an AAM). As an example, 
consider a false target mimicking a manned aircraft maneuver characterized by a 
parabolic increase of the closing speed vc. With a final acceleration value of 3g we

which corresponds, assuming the radar carrier frequency to be ft = 10 GHz (or λ 
= 0.03m), to a Doppler frequency increase Δfd = 2·Δvc/λ = 6 kHz. Because radar 
Doppler tracking bandwidths are on the order of 1 kHz, the VGPO program would 
have produced a pull-off of almost six filter widths.
Note that the Doppler frequency change impressed by the VGPO program is 
in addition to the Doppler frequency already provided by the closing speed and 
acceleration of the defended platform, so the RECM is required to select the ad-
ditional acceleration of the VGPO program, taking into account the instantaneous 
kinematics parameters of the platform.
The ECCM techniques relevant to the VGPO program that the radars can put 
in place are as follows:
•• Coherency check. The phase modulation impressed to the replica also pro-
duces relatively strong spurious signals that may be identified by detectors 
placed in the Doppler filters close to the filter containing the true target Dop-
pler frequency. In this case the radar may coast on the true target Doppler 
filter, ignoring the new more appealing signals.
•• Velocity guard gates. The gates are placed on either side of the true target 
Doppler filter to monitor the insurgency of false targets and make the radar 
coast on the true target Doppler filter (i.e., keep the tracking on the previous 
position of the true target for a limited period) and then pass to track-on-jam 
if the jamming persists. 
As recalled at the beginning of this discussion, the objective of both RGPO and 
VGPO techniques is to provide a larger JSR for the subsequent angle deception 
techniques (which may require a JSR > 30 dB when competing with the true target 
signal). This is achieved by removing the target signal from the tracking gate.
Because most modern tracking radars employ some Doppler signal processing 
(MTI, LPRF PD), it is necessary to add to the delayed replicas of the RGPO pro-
gram (which is a time modulation technique) the relevant Doppler frequency shifts 
due to the false target deceleration (usually a few kilohertz when mimicking an 
A/C). This VRGPO program is efficiently produced by modern DRFMs.
6.3.3  RECM Techniques Used Against Radar Angle Measurement
Angle measurement and tracking provided by STT or MFAR radars are the essen-
tial target position parameters required to achieve effective interception of intruders 
into defended territories (including military ships), because target angle position 
alone can in many cases provide interception from radar-guided weapons (i.e., 
through track-on-jam or home-on-jam techniques).
Because of the importance of STT angle measurement and tracking, much effort 
has been spent by radar designers on protecting this capability and by RECM de-
signers on denying it through the development of effective systems and techniques. 
As discussed in the previous paragraphs, the RECM techniques used against radar 
range tracking are only the initial part of a jamming program meant to ease the suc-
cess of the following part of the program in which techniques against radar angle 
tracking are employed.

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
321
As discussed in Chapter 2, old tracking radars (some of which are still present 
in many of the legacy systems of some nations) used sequential lobbing techniques 
to provide angle measurement, among which the most effective was the conical 
scan technique. In this technique angle measurement is achieved by nutating the 
antenna main-beam pattern around the boresight of the antenna parabolic dish 
reflector and by measuring the amplitude modulation of the target returns. This 
index becomes a measure of the target angular offset from the antenna boresight. 
The angular tracking loop of the STT is able to completely correct the angular off-
set, which is achieved when the AM index is zero, that is, when the radar antenna 
boresight is aligned to the target direction, as shown in Figure 6.15.
The RECM applied technique is an amplitude modulation as near as possible 
to the nutation frequency, so as to be accepted within the angular tracking loop 
bandwidth (centered at the scanning frequency fs). Typically this band is a few 
hertz.
Even though the target return signal may be overwhelmed by the RECM sig-
nal, unless the AM frequency is within the above-mentioned bandwidth, the radar 
angle tracking loop will coast on its prior data or continue to extract the correct 
target position from the RECM signal (which is modulated at fs by the nutation 
of the receiving feed). The self-protection RECM, therefore, first measures the fre-
quency of the amplitude modulation (which is available until the radar antenna 
boresight is not aligned with the target direction) and then locks onto it through a 
PLL. As soon as the scanning frequency is locked, the RECM starts transmitting a 
signal at the radar carrier frequency that is modulated with a square wave (which 
produces the maximum index of modulation) at the scanning frequency but with a 
phase shift of π radians with respect to the received radar amplitude modulation. 
This technique is called inverse gain and is shown in Figure 6.16.
As can be noted from Figure 6.16(a), which displays the combined target plus 
jammer responses (i.e. in the case that RGPO or VGPO programs were not success-
ful), the target modulation is still present and a large JSR would be required to pull 
Figure 6.15  Principle of operation of the conical scan angle tracking loop.

322 
��������������������������������
ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
off the target angular tracking loop. In Figure 6.16(b) only the jammer response 
is shown, which would produce the pull-off of the radar angle tracking from the 
target position in the case of successful RGPO or VGPO programs.
The first ECCM technique employed by the conical scan tracking radars was 
to adopt a two-antenna system: one transmitting antenna with a fixed beamwidth, 
centered at the parabolic dish boresight, and one receiving antenna with a nutating 
beamwidth at frequency fs around the boresight of the transmitting antenna. This 
technique is called conical scan on receive only (COSRO) and is also applied to 
lobe switching angle measurement schemes (see Chapter 2), where the technique is 
called lobe on receive only (LORO).
Because with the COSRO technique the radar transmitting antenna is not nu-
tated any more, the RECM is unable to measure the angular scanning modulation 
fs. A different RECM technique is therefore employed, called swept-square-wave 
(SSW), in which the frequency of the amplitude modulation is slowly but continu-
ously varied, as shown in Figure 6.17, over the expected range (fs,min to fs,max) of 
the nutation frequencies that may be used by the radar. The above range is usu-
ally comprised from 20 to 300 Hz. The sweep rate has to be slow enough that the

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
323
amplitude modulation at the radar scanning frequency fs persists for a sufficient 
period T in order to produce the pull-off of the angle tracking.
Because the angle tracking loop bandwidth is typically very narrow (a few 
hertz), the required period T is a fraction of a second and hence the coverage of the 
complete conical scan frequency interval (about 280 Hz) would require more than 
50 sec. This sweeping frequency period is too large, especially in a missile engage-
ment. However, because the employed amplitude modulation (the on-off square 
wave) is rich in odd harmonics (especially the third and fifth harmonic, which are 
attenuated, respectively, by 10 and 14 dB with respect to the fundamental), it is suf-
ficient to sweep the fundamental square wave from 20 to 60 Hz in order to cover 
the complete conical scan frequency range. In this case the sweeping period can be 
4 to 5 sec and the effective jamming period is T = 0.25 sec, sufficient to induce the 
angle tracking pull-off.
The use of an inverse gain or SSW technique requires [5] a JSR of about 10 to 
20 dB when the signal has to compete with the true target return. Therefore, the 
technique is always preceded by the RGPO or VGPO program, which usually re-
quires only a JSR of > 3 dB. 
To reduce the total frequency sweep period, modern RECMs employ the jog 
detection technique, which is based on monitoring the amplitude variations of the 
tracking radar along the frequency sweep. In fact, during the frequency sweep, 
if the dwell time at a certain frequency is insufficient to disrupt the radar angle 
tracking, it may yet be sufficient to induce momentary perturbations to the angular 
tracking loop. These small angular movements of the transmitting antenna (and 
hence the relevant variations of received amplitude at the RECM) can be detected, 
and the relevant RECM transmitted frequency provides an indication of the 
radar’s conical scan frequency on reception only. With this indication the RECM 
stops the SSW frequency sweep and begins a fine SSW frequency sweep around the 
above indicated frequency. 
The SSW technique is also applied in IR jamming (by flash lamps or DIRCMs) 
of the rotating reticles of the IR missile seekers, albeit with a different scale of rota-
tion speeds and tracking loop bandwidth due to the smaller moments of inertia of 
the small IR reticle with respect to the nutating RF antenna feed.
Modern tracking radars employ the monopulse technique (either amplitude 
or phase version) for angle measurement. This technique avoids the need for am-
plitude modulation, because it can extract the needed angular information from a 
single return by measuring its amplitude differences or phase difference as received 
at two or more displaced elements of the radar antenna (see Chapter 2).
The RECM techniques used against monopulse angular tracking are cross-po-
larization, cross-eye, countdown, ground bounce, chaff illumination, and expend-
able and towed decoys. These techniques are discussed in the following subsections.
6.3.3.1  Cross-Polarization
Some radar parabolic reflector antennas show one potential vulnerability to the 
amplitude monopulse technique for the presence of an antenna pattern in orthogo-
nal (cross) polarization although at a level of less than –25 dB with respect to the 
design polarization. In the cross-polarized antenna pattern, the nulls occur where 
the design polarization pattern shows the maxima; that is, where the two polarized 

324 
��������������������������������
ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
beams show interchanged patterns as shown in Figure 6.18. Therefore, when the 
amplitude difference of the two beams is performed (as required by the amplitude 
monopulse technique), the two error signal patterns are out of phase. 
The net result is that for the same position in angle relative to the boresight, 
the cross-polarized pattern drives the tracking loop to the opposite direction with 
respect to the one relevant to the design polarization. Thus, the RECM has to 
transmit at orthogonal polarization with respect to the received one in order to 
produce a steady angular error. The transmitted polarization is required to have an 
accuracy of about 1° with respect to the cross-polarization in order to be effective 
as shown with the following consideration. Let us assume that the tracking radar is 
designed with vertical polarization and its cross-polarized (i.e., horizontal polariza-
tion) response is –25 dB with respect to the isopolarized gain. An error of ε deg in 
the transmitted signal with regard to horizontal polarization will produce a verti-
cally polarized jamming component in the response with a power

If ε ≈ 3°, sin2ε = –25 dB and this means that the transmitted signal is producing 
a vertical component of the same level as the cross-polarized one. Thus the cross-
polarized signal should be accurate to <1° with regard to horizontal polarization 
in order for its vertical component to be less than –30 dB and for the technique to 
be effective. 
Due to the difficulty of reaching such an accuracy, the RECM employs a feed 
of a parabolic dish reflector that is rotated at 90° with regard to the received

polarization, and then slowly swept across this position of ±2° in order to provide 
a kick to the angular tracking loop when the transmitted signal is at the actual 
cross-polarization.
Another RECM method is to use a large active phased array antenna with N 
radiating elements in double polarization (H and V). Once the received polariza-
tion is measured with the same accuracy as above, the transmitting elements are 
selected in the proper ratio nH/nV (where nH + nV = N) in order to produce the 
cross-polarized jamming signal with the required accuracy.
The cross-polarization technique is not used much for the following reasons:
•• It requires many antenna fixes, such as the application of polarization filters 
to the receiving feeds and application of a polarization twist to the Casseg-
rain antenna subreflector, which drastically reduces its effectiveness (see the 
pictures of the tracking radars NA30 and NA25 reported in Chapter 2). 
•• There is no inherent reason why the radar receiving antenna must be de-
signed at the same polarization as the transmitting one because the target’s 
scattering power is uniformly distributed at all polarizations.
The behavior of the phase monopulse radar technique relative to cross-polar-
ization is very similar to that of the amplitude monopulse radar technique in that 
the cross-polarized RECM signal produces a π radians phase shift between the two 
monopulse receiving antennas (or the two semi-arrays of a phased array antenna) 
of this technique as shown in [5], thus providing a distortion in the error signal 
pattern that feeds the radar angular tracking loop.
6.3.3.2  Cross-Eye
The cross-eye technique exploits the angular glint error produced in the angular 
tracking loop by a target composed of a large number of independent reflectors 
as discussed in Chapter 2, where the case of two reflectors (the dumbbell model, 
analyzed by Howard [6]) is reported.
In practical applications of this technique, the two independent reflectors, 
spaced at a distance L, called the base length, are exchanged for two coherent jam-
mers, which transmit a power ERP2 and ERP1 = a2ERP2 where a ≤ 1 is an attenu-
ation factor. Its signals arrive at the radar victim antenna at a distance R from the 
base length, with a phase shift φ. Under these conditions, for which the geometry is 
shown in Figure 6.19, it can be shown [6–9] that the radar monopulse network is 
subject to an angular error ε as follows:

where α = (L · cosγ)/R is the angular extent of the base length as seen by the radar

direction to a segment to the base length and the radar antenna boresight.

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
Equation (6.13) is valid as long as the angular error ε is within θB/2(i.e., ε ≤ 
θB/2), where θB is the radar –3-dB sum beamwidth. Beamwidth vs. phase shift φ is 
plotted in Figure 6.20 using the power ratio a2 = J1/J2, where J1 and J2 are the jam-
mer powers transmitted by the two jammers and received by the victim radar at a 
distance R. Jammer powers J1 and J2 are proportional to the respective transmitted 
jammer ERP through the same proportionality factor k = (ERP/4πR2)(Gλ2/4π), 
where G is the radar antenna receiving gain.
As shown in Figure 6.20, the maximum of the error is achieved when the two 
signals reach the radar antenna out of phase (φ = π radians) and the peak error is 
expressed as

where D is the apparent position from the center of the base length and is aligned 
with the base length of the “ghost” jammer (the combination of the two jammers).
To implement practical jammer systems, some important considerations have 
to be made relevant to the preceding angular error expression:
•• The phase shift of nearly π radians between the two coherent jammer signals 
is the one arriving at the radar antenna. To achieve this relationship in most 
engagement geometries, a retrodirective jammer architecture like that shown 
in Figure 6.21 must be used.
•• The phase shift accuracy becomes more stringent the lower the ratio of a 
relevant to the amplitude between the two signals that provides the larger 
distance of the “ghost” target from the defended platform.
•• The lower the ratio a, the higher the required jammer ERPj of the two coher-
ent sources to compensate for the jammer power loss ΔJ at the radar receiver 
due to the out-of-phase condition for the effectiveness of the technique. Jam-
mer loss is expressed as follows:

dB.

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
The preceding considerations imply that practical jammers should implement 
amplitude ratios a < –1 dB in the presence of the target return or perform the cross-
eye technique after a RGPO/VGPO program has succeeded in capturing the range 
tracking gate as for the previously discussed angular gate deception techniques. 
Notwithstanding the expression of (6.13) is evaluated in terms of an angular error 
to the radar angular tracking, the induced glint error, as shown in (6.14), is pro-
duced by an apparent source of the return signal at a distance D from the center of 
the base length.
The plot of the maximum angular cross-eye error vs. the inverse of the distance 
R from the radar is shown in Figure 6.23 with the ratio a as a parameter. From 
this figure note that at large distances [i.e., where αB = α/(θB/2) = L/(RθB/2) < 0.01,

small angular extent of the base length with regard to the radar beam] where large 
JSRs are available, the angular error is negligible. At shorter distances of αB > 0.05, 
as the angular extent of the base length is increased with respect to the beamwidth, 
the angular cross-eye error decreases as the imbalance a of the jammer signals is 
increased by the different antenna gain values at which the two jammer signals are 
received. This means that as the jammer approaches the radar, the closer it gets, the 
larger is the imbalance applied to the jammer signals by the antenna gain and the 
smaller is the distance D of the apparent source from the base length.
Large angular errors at short distances can be achieved by keeping constant the 
jammer signals imbalance as seen by the radar. The additional imbalance produced 
by the radar beamwidth is compensated via a tracking closed loop performed by 
the retrodirective jammer architecture. This second method is called constant gain 
cross-eye (CGCE) and is the one implemented by modern RECMs employing active 
Rx/Tx phased array antennas. This implementation has the further advantage (as 
for the jog detection) of being able to assess the effectiveness of the jamming tech-
nique. As the jammer is in a closed loop with the radar beamwidth, then, through 
the measurement of the received unbalance increase produced when the latter aims 
at the ghost target, the jammer is able to increase the transmitted power unbalance 
from its two sources in order to keep a constant unbalance between the signal pow-
ers received by the radar (as weighed by the radar beamwidth).
The normalized cross-eye gain of the CGCE method vs. the inverse of the dis-
tance R, with the initially impressed imbalance a as a parameter, is shown in Fig-
ure 6.24. The same figure also shows the normalized cross-eye gain of the CPCE 
method for comparison. Note from the figure that when the distance of the radar 
from the target is on the order of αB = α/θB/2 > 0.1 (i.e., L/RθB ≥ 0.05), the CGCE 
method induces a resonance of the angular tracking error dependent on the mono-
pulse characteristics of the radar antenna. This refers to the angular distance of 
the Δ beamwidth peaks from the antenna boresight or Σ beamwidth peak. This 
resonance has been verified in experimental trials. Due to the kinematics of the 
missile engagements with a target, this resonance error produces a large miss dis-
tance to the missile in the last phase of the engagement. Some simulation results 
of active missile engagements against fighter aircraft defended by a CGCE jammer

are graphed in Figure 6.25. On the bottom left side of this figure, the model of the 
aircraft (with four independent scatterers to simulate its RCS and glint because the 
jammer technique is performed without any RGPO) and the model of the jammers, 
with the initial differential amplitude of the two jammers (placed at the wingtips 
in order to achieve the maximum base length of L = 10m in the forward and rear 
sectors of the aircraft) are set to achieve a miss distance on the right side of the 
aircraft. On the top left side of the figure a pictorial view of the AAM/aircraft en-
gagement is shown with two distances reported: Rswitch-on, representing the start 
of the engagement from the radar, and RCE-on, representing the start of the CGCE 
jamming technique. On the right side of the figure, two engagements are reported 
with the aircraft and missile kinematics data and the achieved miss distances calcu-
lated from the extremes of the wingtip. 
The experimental verification of the monopulse characteristics of the radar an-
tenna have removed the limitation attached to (6.13) of the maximum cross-eye an-
gular error being less than half the radar –3-dB beamwidth (i.e., ε < θB/2). Indeed, 
whenever the cross-eye produced distance D is sufficiently large, either because the 
base length L is large (so that α = L/R > θB/2) or the imbalance a is very small, a 
break-lock is produced. This condition can be exploited in many engagements. An 
example is given later when discussing the ground bounce technique.
The cross-eye technique described here produces a warped phase front just at 
the victim radar antenna. This warped phase front introduces an angular error in 
all types of angular tracking. This error is applied to antennas that tend to align 
their boresight normal to the incoming (supposedly) planar phase front (single tar-
get within the tracking gate).

6.3  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Tracking Radars and Related ECCMs 
331
Two important considerations must be mentioned that are relevant to possible 
ECCM techniques used against the cross-eye technique as applied to active missiles:
•• The cross-eye SPJ is in most cases not affected by the burn-through range of 
most SPJs (as discussed in Chapter 5 when dealing with the jammer equa-
tion). This is because the missile seeker beamwidth is pointed toward the 
ghost target. It illuminates the actual target and receives target returns only 
from the skirts of the main beam. This two-way antenna-gain reduction pro-
duces an increase in JSR that partially compensates for the R–2 target signal 
S increase due to the approaching distance. This compensation is larger, the 
narrower the radar antenna beamwidth, as shown in Figure 6.26.
•• If the cross-eye technique is applied in the presence of the target return (i.e., 
within the range tracking gate, which results in quite short base lengths for 
achieving the minimum retransmission delay by the jammer), only radars em-
ploying super-resolution techniques (and hence array antennas) would have 
the ability to continue with the angular tracking of the actual target.
Simple methods applicable to monopulse antennas such as the complex indi-
cated angle method [10, 11], which computes the complex monopulse ratio Δ/Σ 
(both the real and imaginary parts of the ratio, whereas the usual monopulse meth-
od computes only the real part of the ratio), can only indicate the presence of jam-
ming without providing any angular indication relevant to the target [12]. 
6.3.3.3  Countdown
Angle tracking loops operate with a narrow servo bandwidth, that is, they require a 
large number of pulses to extract the angular error. After application of the RGPO 
Figure 6.26  JSR increase in the terminal phase of the engagement.

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
or VGPO program and shifting of the tracking gate to the hook false target posi-
tion, it is possible to reduce progressively the fraction of pulses to which the re-
peater responds (hence, the name countdown for this technique) and are within the 
tracking gate. This reduction continues until the number of pulses is insufficient 
for extracting an accurate angle error. This technique also affects the AGC loop, 
which has an amplification level that tends to keep constant the operational level 
of the successive circuits. A reduction in the number of integrated pulses decreases 
this level, so the AGC increases the amplification level toward the saturation level 
of the amplifiers, thus introducing nonlinearities that further worsen the angular 
tracking accuracy.
6.3.3.4  Ground Bounce
The ground bounce technique can be used by the RECM of a low-flying aircraft 
against an AAM provided with a PD or semiactive CW tracking radar seeker. It 
transmits replicas of the radar waveform toward the underlying terrain in a manner 
such that the transmitted energy is scattered toward the tracking radar. Two neces-
sary conditions have to be met in order for this technique to be effective:
•• The direct jammer energy aimed toward the seeker must be lower than that 
reflected from the terrain. This poses a sidelobe level limit to the jammer 
antenna or the use of a dedicated jammer antenna, pointed to ground, to 
perform such a technique.
•• In the case of an attack from a PD radar, the geometrical conditions of the 
reflection should allow a minimum delay with respect to the target echo; 
otherwise, the radar will continue to track the aircraft. This implies that the 
technique must be activated when the missile is quite far away so that both 
the target signal and the jamming signal reflected by the terrain are within the 
same resolution cell of the radar.
Suppose an aircraft is flying at constant speed va and height ha, while the mis-
sile is diving from a height hm as shown in Figure 6.27. The initial distance between 
the missile and the aircraft is R0. To allow simple calculations, let us suppose that 
the kinematics of the engagement is contained in the elevation plane and we have

From (6.24), using typical maximum values for the terrain reflectivity (σ0 ≈ 
–20 dBm
2/m
2) and the usual target RCS and large jammer beamwidth, the required 
jammer antenna gain G′ in the direction of the missile has to be more than 40 dB 
below the jammer antenna gain Gj, practically a null in that direction. Therefore, 
the employment of the ground bounce technique requires the adoption of a sepa-
rate jammer antenna looking at ground and isolated toward the upper hemisphere 
by the aircraft structure.
A more effective jamming technique that exploits the multipath produced by 
the terrain is the low altitude cross-eye (LACE) technique [13]. This technique can 
be exploited by aircraft flying at low altitude against radars provided with angular 
tracking loops in both polar angular dimensions (θ, φ) (i.e., typically AAM or AAA 
against a low-flying attack helicopter). The technique uses two jammers in the ver-
tical plane (although separated by a moderate base length) and exploits the terrain 
reflection, which produces images of the two cross-eye jammers within the missile 
beamwidth. The large virtual base length (double the flight height) produced by 
the flight generates break-locks to the angular tracking of the radar. The geometry 
of the engagement is shown in Figure 6.28 and the simulation results of a LACE 
engagement relevant to a low-level flight by a helicopter against a tracking radar 
with 2° beamwidth are shown in Figure 6.29. The technique has been experimen-
tally verified.

6.3.3.5  Chaff Illumination (CHILL)
In Chapter 5, when discussing chaff, we described a technique capable of produc-
ing a radar break-lock. This technique involved a maneuver that consisted of flying 
an aircraft at nearly 90° with respect to the radar boresight in order to exploit the

launch of chaff, which immediately produces a large RCS clutter at nearly zero 
Doppler and cannot be discriminated by radar Doppler signal processing.
Break-lock can also be achieved without any aircraft maneuvering by the illu-
mination of the chaff launched at the back of the aircraft through a proper replica 
by the on-board RECM of the radar waveform. The replica is transmitted accord-
ing to a VRGPO program (or simply VGPO in case of CW radar). This technique is 
very effective against coherent radars that exploit Doppler information to discard 
static targets and is very convenient because it exploits a relatively cheap off-board 
decoy.
6.3.3.6  Expendable and Towed Decoys
With respect to passive decoys, such as chaff and corner reflectors (the latter used 
in the defence of ships), the ejection of an active decoy from a defended platform 
provides more flexibility against an approaching radar-guided missile because its 
transmitted signal can be modulated to produce more realistic or confusing target 
parameters to the victim radar.
In the airborne case, expendable decoys are most often used against semiactive 
CW missiles because a low-power RECM is sufficient for their countering. The ex-
pendable decoy takes the shape of a minimissile, with a payload very similar to that 
of a repeater jammer. In addition to being angularly separated from the defended 
target, the expendable decoy transmits a deceptive VGPO. 
After having been launched in the direction of the incoming missile, the decoy 
rapidly decelerates and begins to fall (slowly if a small parachute has been de-
ployed). Therefore, its transmitted signal has to be modulated with a VGPO pro-
gram in order to produce a credible false target for a long period of time (usually 
the life of its battery).
Shipboard expendable decoys are launched by an on-board decoy launching 
system with a ballistic trajectory in the direction of the incoming missile but at 
some angular offset with respect to the ship to missile direction. In this way the 
decoys can lure the missile leading-edge range tracking loop. Their operational life 
is increased by being suspended in the air by a small parachute and by a large size 
battery.
The towed decoy (TD) is used to defend both ships and aircraft. Naval TDs 
normally float above the water at long distances from the defended ship and are of 
the repeater type. Airborne TDs can be either of the repeater type or RF fed at low 
power via a fiber-optic cable. The advantage of the airborne TD is that its jamming 
signal is inherently provided with the same Doppler content of the aircraft target, 
thus it is sufficient for its transmitted energy to exceed the target return in order to 
lure the CW semiactive missiles’ tracking gates.
Fiber-optic TDs have a remote transmitter (usually a mini-TWT power amplifi-
er) for which both RF modulating signals (via fiber-optic cables) and a high-voltage 
power supply (via the inner core of the cable; generated internally to the towing air-
craft) are provided via the same towing cable. As such they are able to exploit the 
large variety of jamming programs available from an on-board RECM technique 
generator (see Chapter 5) and are able to counter more advanced threats than just 
those from CW semiactive missiles. An illustration of the deployment from aircraft 
of expendable and towed decoys is shown in Figure 6.30.

6.4  Conclusions About RECM Techniques 
337
The TD technique presents two conical regions within which an approaching 
missile will fuse on and destroy an aircraft. They result from the fact that the mis-
sile, while tracking the decoy signal, can pass close enough to the aircraft to fuse on 
and destroy it, either before or after passing the decoy. Both cones have the vertex 
on the decoy and an aperture α = 2 tan–1((rl+W)/L), where rl is the lethality range 
of the fuse, W is the aircraft fuselage width (usually negligible with regard to rl), 
and L is the towing cable length. The cone aperture is usually small in dependence 
of the large towing cable length. Indeed, if the aircraft and the TD are aligned with 
respect to the direction of arrival of the missile in the forward sector of the aircraft, 
the missile will prevalently home on the aircraft and its Doppler-based fuse system 
will explode in proximity of it. In the aircraft rear sector, if the missile is homing 
onto the TD, but for any reason is not exploding in its proximity, it may continue 
its course and explode in proximity to the aircraft. The geometry of the above situ-
ation is shown in Figure 6.31.
To avoid such inconvenience, as soon as a missile lock-on is detected the pilot 
performs a “gentle weave” maneuver (so as not to dramatically increase the air-
craft RCS as viewed by the missile) to prevent the aircraft and the TD being aligned 
with the DOA of the missile. Because the missile’s fuse is activated by the TD body, 
it is possible that the missile explosion may damage or destroy the TD. In such a 
case the aircraft is usually provided with at least one further decoy, which is im-
mediately deployed to protect the aircraft against a second attack. 
As discussed above the airborne TD is very effective against CW semiactive 
missiles but is less effective (unless provided with a much larger ERP) against AAA 
tracking radars, which can exploit frequency agility and LE range gate tracking.

ECM Techniques and Sensor ECCMs 
electronically scanning array radars, were discussed. The most effective ECM tech-
nique against surveillance radars is a combination of short noise cover pulses (phase 
modulated at the pulse compression chip rate) capable of masking the jamming 
aircraft and use of a large number of credible false targets (within the radar main 
beam, possibly performed by a small number of synchronized ESJs) at ranges be-
hind the ESJ in order to overcome the PRI jitter and frequency agility exploited 
by the radar. In most cases, it is necessary to first apply an ECM technique that 
pulls the tracking gate off the target before attempting angle deception. Among 
the techniques used, the most effective against active missile seekers is the cross-
eye technique, which can provide a number of break-locks. When applied in the 
presence of the target return (i.e., within the range tracking gate), it is difficult to 
discriminate. The most effective technique against semiactive missiles is constituted 
by the towed decoy. 
Many ECM techniques have been reported in the literature against SAR and 
bistatic/multistatic radars, but until now no experimental results have been avail-
able to assess their effectiveness. 
6.5  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Communication 
Systems 
In earlier times militarily, more value was associated with listening to the adver-
sary’s conversations and exchanging data via radio links than with jamming its 
transmissions. The widespread use of modern digital and encryption techniques 
in communication systems has greatly reduced the ability to quickly extract in-
formation from an adversary’s exchanged messages. So jamming the nodes of the

adversary’s communication network has become of primary importance because it 
allows the commander to be separated from his forces and limits the enemy’s situ-
ation awareness by disrupting the exchange of information within its network. A 
further important aspect of jamming to communication networks in military op-
erations is the following consideration by W. Perry, reported in [14]: “If we jam an 
enemy radar, we remove one weapon from our attack, but if we jam a C2 system 
we disrupt an arsenal of weapons.”
As discussed in Section 2.4, military communication systems are of three types:
•• Combat net radios, which provide short- and medium-range voice (digitally 
modulated) communication;
•• Tactical data links, which are used to transfer data within a C2 system from 
one node to another;
•• Satellite communications, which provide very-long-range data exchange be-
tween users.
The main ECCM (or antijam) characteristics of modern digitally modulated 
communication systems are given in Figure 6.32. The two types of FHSS com-
munication waveforms—slow (SFH,  more data bits per hop) and fast (FFH, more 
frequency hops per data bit)—for the data bit BFSK modulation are shown, respec-
tively, in the Figures 6.33 and 6.34.
Modern communication waveforms require two types of circuitry in their re-
ceivers: demodulation circuitry and synchronization circuitry. Demodulation cir-
cuitry operates the correlation of the received waveform with the code available at 
the receiver matched to the transmitted one, thus decoding the information content 
of the transmitted message. Synchronization circuitry allows the above-mentioned 
correlation function by aligning the two codes. ECM techniques can therefore be 
aimed at either causing errors to the content of the received messages or preventing

the synchronization of those messages. Both options have to be considered when 
selecting a jamming technique. The idea is to determine which technique provides 
the higher vulnerability to the victim communication system. The main ECM tech-
niques discussed in this section are listed in Figure 6.35 [14]. The discussion will 
follow the path indicated by Poisel [15], who analyzed the susceptibility of the 
communication techniques reported in Figure 6.32 with respect to the ECM tech-
niques of Figure 6.35.

6.5.1  Noise Jamming
The noise jamming technique modulates the jamming carrier frequency with a 
random Gaussian noise waveform with a bandwidth that may vary from the one 
relevant to a single communication channel (narrowband or spot noise) to the en-
tire spectrum occupied by the digital SS communication [wideband or barrage (or 
partial band) noise].The objective of this technique is the insertion of noise into the 
receiver to increase the BER and deny the information content of the communica-
tion, as discussed in Appendix E. 
Broadband noise (BBN) is useful against all types of SS communication tech-
niques, but it requires a very large jammer power with a limited effect, propor-
tional to the jamming power received by the bandwidth of a single channel; that 
is, a ratio equal to the processing gain of the SS techniques, Gp = Bss/Bch for DSSS, 
where Bss is the entire communication bandwidth and Bch is the bandwidth of a 
single channel, or Gp = NT for FHSS, where NT is the total number of channels of 
the communication.
BBN is also effective in jamming the synchronization phase of a SS communica-
tion when the receiver is trying to align with the transmitter PN code sequence. The 
50% probability of no synchronization of a FHSS communication (where coarse 
acquisition is accomplished with the matched filter approach or serial search code 
acquisition approaches) under BBN jamming is evaluated in Chapter 6 of [15] and 
shown in Table 6.1. Note that such a JSR level for a BBN jammer operating in the 
full VHF range (30 to 90 MHz, with a channel bandwidth Bch = 25 kHz) relevant 
to a FH combat net radio (such as Jaguar-V) would require a jammer transmitting 
power on the order of a few kilowatts, which is possible only with a large ground-
based jammer.
Partial band noise (PBN) places noise energy across a number (but not all) of 
the channels of the victim communication system. PBN performed with an optimal 
bandwidth fraction γ > 0.3 (where γ = Bj/Bss is the fraction of the spread-spectrum 
communication bandwidth Bss occupied by the jamming waveform of bandwidth 
Bj) can be even more effective than BBN for some SS jamming techniques.
Narrowband noise (NBN) jamming places the jamming energy within a sin-
gle channel. As in the case of BFSK jamming shown in Appendix E, the jamming

bandwidth can be either the data signal one, the complementary signal one, or 
both. This type of jamming can be applied in a jammer follower against a SFH 
communication system, taking into account that the BER produced by the JSR has 
to be modified by the fraction α < 1 of the presence of the jammer within the hop 
time at the receiver:

where pnoise is the probability of error in the presence of receiver noise only and 
pjammer+noise is the probability of error in the presence of combined jammer and 
receiver noise.
The tone jamming technique involves the placement of one or more jamming 
tones in appropriate channels of the communication system’s spectrum. Single-tone 
jamming, which is ineffective against FHSS, is somewhat effective against DSSS 
when the tone is close to the carrier frequency [15, Chap. 8]. Multitone jamming 
can be performed by distributing m tones across the spectrum against FHSS and 
DSSS. Against FHSS the m tones have to hop randomly to attempt to hit as many 
FH channels as possible. Against DSSS more effective jamming is achieved if the m 
tones are placed at integer multiples of the data rate [15, Chap. 6]. In both cases 
the achievable BER is lower than 10–1. Multitone jamming can be effectively ap-
plied against FHSS synchronization with an appropriate number of tones (at JSR 
= 0 dB) larger than the number of correlators of the acquisition receiver of the FH 
communication system. The spectrum coverage of these is shown in Figure 6.36.
Swept noise jamming is achieved by sweeping a relatively large band Bsj, com-
prising many contiguous FH channels, across the entire FH bandwidth with a dwell 
time and JSR in each transmitting channel that are high enough to generate the 
required BER. Let us assume that the bandwidth to be swept is Bss and the in-
stantaneous jamming bandwidth is Bj = nΔf, where Δf is the bandwidth of a com-
munication channel. Assume further that the victim communication system is an 
SFHSS with h hop/s and data rate R kbps to achieve a BER ≥ 0.1 and that we want 
in order to jam M = R · BER bps. Because each hop contains R/h bits, the number 
of hops k that has to be hit in T = 1 sec is k · R/h = M = R · BER (i.e., k = h · BER). 
So the number of sweeps that Bj has to perform within the bandwidth Bss in T = 1 
sec is k and the sweep rate is ω = kBss (MHz/s) with a sweep period of T1 = T/k = 
1/k. The dwell time in each channel of width Δf is τ = Bj/ω = Bj/k Bss = Bj/(h · BER 
· Bss). Because the dwell time must be a fraction γ ≥ 0.3 of the hop time, we have τ 
= γ/h and hence Bj = γBER Bss.

6.5  ECM Principles and Techniques Used Against Communication Systems  
343
As an example if we assume Bss = 60 MHz (the entire VHF combat net radio 
communication range) and a data rate R = 20 kbps spread over h = 100 hop/s, we 
have to jam 2,000 bps. Therefore, we would need to sweep a noise bandwidth Bj ≥ 
0.3 × 0.1 × 60 MHz = 1.8 MHz for 10 time/s in order to provide a jamming time τ 
= Bj/ω = 1.8/600 = 3 × 10–3 = 3 ms in each channel of width Δf. 
The time representation of the swept jamming technique is shown in Figure 
6.37.
Recall that jamming a voice transmission for more than 30 percent of its dura-
tion significantly degrades the intelligibility of the message so as to deny the trans-
fer of information. For digital communications the criterion to determine the effec-
tiveness of a jamming waveform is to consider changing the BER from the design 
value of 10–2 to 10–4 in the presence of noise only (the baseline case) to values above 
10–1 [15]. The reader should consider the basic BER evaluation of BFSK modula-
tion when affected by a jamming noise or CW tone as discussed in the Appendix 
E then review Table 6.2, which lists the main results of an analysis performed by 
Poisel [15] on the effectiveness of the jamming techniques listed in Figure 6.35.
6.5.2  Follower Jammer
As discussed in Chapter 5, a follower jammer, also called a repeater or repeat-back 
jammer, is composed of a CESM, which measures the angle and frequency at which 
the SFHSS system is currently transmitting and, after some processing of duration 
Tj performed to recognize the emitter, commands the jammer to transmit the new 
received frequency. This jammer response has to meet a necessary condition in or-
der to be effective, which is constituted by the fraction of hop period αTh (where α

geometry of the propagation and by the processing time at the jammer to provide 
the narrowband jamming waveform centered at the hop frequency. This condition

From this equation note that for the usual modern jammer processing times on the 
order of 1 to 2 ms, the follower jammer (either on ground or on board an UAS) 
constitutes the preferential jamming technique to be employed against SFHSS sys-
tems. For FFHSS systems the follower jammer technique can be applied only by an 
UAS close to the receiver.

modern surveillance, tracking, and multifunction radars were discussed by illustrat-
ing their operating concepts and describing their effects.

Appendix A 
Signal Detection in Sensor Receivers
The main factor limiting the sensitivity of an electronic receiver is the noise, which 
is unwanted electromagnetic energy that impairs the receiver’s ability to detect the 
desired signal. Noise may originate within the receiver itself, as is the case with ther-
mal noise generated by the thermal motion of the conduction electrons in the re-
ceiver input stages, or it may enter via the receiving antenna along with the desired 
signal. Except for very sensitive receivers, like those applied in radioastronomy or 
in long-range surveillance radars, the dominant noise component in receivers is a 
result of thermal noise.
The thermal noise power N (W) generated by a receiver of bandwidth B (Hz) 
at temperature T (K) is equal to:
	
N
kT B
=
	
(A.1)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant (k = 1.38 × 10–23 J/K), T is the temperature (usu-
ally assumed to be 290 K), and B is, with good approximation for the purposes of 
this book, the 3-dB bandwidth of the receiver. Equation (A.1) is usually expressed 
in logarithmic form through the decibel [i.e., XdB = 10 log(x/xref)] with the refer-
ence power expressed in milliwatts (mW = 10–3W) and the reference bandwidth 
expressed in megahertz (MHz = 106 Hz). Hence, it becomes:

In the EW domain two basic types of receiver are considered: the superhetero-
dyne and the amplified crystal video. Both can be schematized with regards to the 
mechanics of signal detection by an envelope detector as depicted in Figure A.1, 
where the amplifier/filter boxes are ideally considered to provide a gain to the input 
signal and noise within a rectangular filter of the same bandwidth as the receiver.
The output noise power Nout of practical RF receivers is always larger than 
that for the ideal case GNin because noise is introduced from each component of 
the receiver. The additional noise power is taken into account by the noise figure 
F, which is defined as:

The difference between a superheterodyne receiver and an amplified video re-
ceiver is that the first type of receiver converts the RF signal into a lower frequency 
fIF­­, because band BIF is much narrower than fIF (i.e., fIF >> BIF). The radar sensors 
are usually of the superheterodyne type with BIF ≈ 2 · Bv.
The input noise power at the video detector of Figure A.1 can be expressed as:

The video detector converts the noise within the RF bandwidth BX to baseband 
bandwidth Bv. The video noise is computed by the convolution of a bandpass filter 
of width 2Bv with the noise of the RF bandpass having a width BX. This process 
is schematically illustrated in Figure A.3 for the case of BX/2Bv = 3 where three in-
dependent noise samples (of Rayleigh distribution with 2Bv bandwidth) are added 
to the baseband. 
The effective or equivalent noise bandwidth of the receiver chain of Figure A.1

The distributions of noise alone (Rayleigh distribution) and signal plus noise 
(Rice distribution) at the output of the Rx chain are shown in Figures A.4 and A.5 
[1].
The detection of a signal in the receiver chain of Figure A.1 is based on estab-
lishing an amplitude threshold VT at the output of the envelope detector. If the 
signal amplitude is strong enough to cross the threshold, a detection occurs; if it is 
not strong enough, no detection occurs. 
The video output of the envelope detector can be represented as shown in 
Figure A.6. Note that its fluctuating appearance is due to the random nature of 
the receiver noise. With reference to Figure A.4, if the threshold is lowered, there 
would be more threshold crossings, most of them due to large fluctuations of noise, 
which produce false signal detections or false alarms.
The receiver noise at the input of the detector is described by a Gaussian pdf 
with zero mean value and variance

By itself, the probability of false alarms does not give a good indication of the

Note that in the case of a radar that on reception uses a matched filter (i.e., a 
filter that maximizes the SNR) as its bandwidth, BRF is equal to that of the trans-
mitted signal: BRF/2Bv = 1. The postdetection SNR gain is achieved by integrating 
along time n successive video detected pulses [2]. This procedure encompasses less 
demanding Pfa and Pd (and hence a lower SNR) than for a single pulse detection.

A target, even if illuminated by a scanning antenna, provides a number n of echo 
signals. The process of summing all of the radar echoes from a target is called 
pulse integration. Integration can be performed in a coherent way, by preserving

the phase of the echo pulse signals so as to add in phase their phasors without any 
loss. This can be accomplished only before the detector, hence, coherent integration 
is also called predetection integration.
Integration can also be performed in a noncoherent way, by adding the pulse 
amplitudes after the envelope detector (hence, noncoherent integration is called 
also postdetection integration). The operation of both types of pulse integration in 
shown in Figure A.7. 
The result of coherent integration of n pulses having the same SNRin is
	
SNRout = n SNRin	
Because SNRout is the required value to meet the final Pd and Pfa conditions, 
the single pulse required SNR is n times less SNRin = SNRout/n. The result of non-
coherent integration can be expressed as: 
	
( )

where the factor efficiency Ei(n) < 1 takes into account the envelope detector losses. 
The integration improvement factor Ii(n) = nEi(n) as a function of n, Pd, and Pfa 
was evaluated by Marcum shows and reported in Figure A.7. Inspection of Figure 
A.7 indicates that when only a few pulses are integrated (and thus they need to 
have a large SNR) the postdetection improvement is nearly equal to the predetec-
tion one, whereas when a large number of pulses is integrated (and thus their SNR 
is not large) the postdetection improvement differs significantly from the predetec-
tion one.
A.2  Coherent Detection
Most radars apply coherent processing to the received echo signals in order to take 
into account the Doppler phase variation from a pulse to the next induced by the 
target motion. Coherent detection is applied in modern digital signal processing 
with an I,Q detector (see Figure A.7). In this detector the narrowband IF signal

Thus, the two channels together provide the amplitude and phase modulations 
of the input signal. If the outputs of the I and Q channels are squared and summed, 
then the square root of the sum is the envelope A(t) of the envelope detector shown 
previously. 
The digitized signals are obtained through sampling and A/D conversion of the 
two components to produce a series of complex digital samples I + jQ. Sampling 
must be performed at least at the Nyquist rate (i.e., twice the input signal band-
width B) in order to faithfully reproduce the signal. Because there are two channels 
in the I,Q detector, the ADC in each of the I and Q channels needs only to sample 
at the rate B sample/s. With this rate there is a SNR loss of about 0.6 dB compared 
to continuous sampling, since the sampling is not guaranteed to occur at the peak 
output of the matched filter. In practice, by sampling at a rate 2B samples/s much 
of the above SNR loss is recovered.

Introductory Concepts of Estimation 
Theory
The detection of a signal in a sensor is generally followed by the estimation of signal 
parameters that are related to some interesting information about the emitter such 
as its amplitude, time, angle of arrival, and carrier and modulating frequencies. 
Because the received signal is corrupted by disturbances of various types, we often 
desire to obtain a valid estimate u of the unknown parameter u starting from statis-
tical information about the signal and its disturbances (e.g., noise).
In this appendix, we briefly describe two widely used methods of parameter 
estimation: maximum likelihood estimation and the least-squares method. Before 
we do so, however, we have to introduce a very important boundary in defining the 
performance of any estimating method: the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). A 
demonstration of the CRLB is beyond the scope of this book. Interested readers are 
referred to [1] for deeper insight into the topic.
Let us assume that we collected N measurements of a random variable y, which 
is related to the unknown parameter u. The measurements can be represented by 
a vector yT = [y1, y2, …, yN] and we define an estimate of the parameter u as u = 
φ(y), where φ(.) is a suitable function that represents mapping from the samples to 
the estimate. Let us further assume that the vector of measurements y provides a 
sufficient statistic (i.e., it provides enough information about the observations to 
make a proper decision) and has an exponential pdf of the form: 
	
( | )
exp[ ( ) ( )
( )] ( )
p y u
A u q y
B u h y
=
+
	
(B.1)
As an example the Gaussian pdf with mean μ and variance σ2 is of the expo-
nential type with respect to both parameters μ and σ2.
The probability density function (pdf) of the estimate u depends on the un-
known parameter u and is expressed as p(u|u) (which can be either the Bayesian 
conditioned pdf (also called a likelihood function) or a pdf depending on the pa-
rameter u.
The efficiency of an estimator is given by the distance of the estimate u from 
the unknown parameter u, that is, by how much the relevant pdf p(u|u) is clustered 

358 
Appendix B
around the value u. This distance is defined in the theory of measurements by two 
parameters:
•• Estimator accuracy, that is, the ability of the estimator to provide an esti-
mate u whose expected value E(u|u) is as close as possible to the parameter 
u , where:

A sufficient estimator that satisfies the relationship E(u|u) = u is called unbiased 
and is surely an accurate one. However, it is not necessarily the best estimator, be-
cause the efficiency of the estimator is also dependent on its precision, that is, the 
minimum variance around the mean value.
The theorem of Cramer-Rao states that there is a lower bound, the CRLB, to 
the conditional variance of any scalar estimator. Therefore, if we can find an un-
biased estimator whose variance is equal to the CRLB, it will be the optimum one 
and it is called an efficient estimator.

B.1  Maximum Likelihood Function Estimator
The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) method is quite simple and powerful 
and requires a minimal amount of a priori information about the parameter to be 
estimated. The property for which uMLE is said to be the maximum likelihood esti-
mation of an observation y is that:
	
ˆ

(

(

That is, uMLE maximizes the likelihood function p (y|u) or, in other words, 
uMLE is the value of u that most likely caused the observed values y to occur. As an 
example let us consider a case where we have N noisy measurements of a param-
eter u:

So the estimate uMLE does not depend on the noise variance and it is unbiased 
because the expected value of uMLE is E(uMLE|u) = u, which is also the expected 
value of the observation x.

cause it equates the CRLB.
The example above about how to apply the MLE method has led to a solution 
in closed form. However, in most practical cases the application of the method 
involves much more complicated and nonlinear mathematical relationships that 
can be solved either numerically with iterative methods or by linearization around 
some working point.
B.2  Least-Squares Method of Estimation
The least-squares method (LSM) of estimation is derived from the general least-
squares method, which has the goal of estimating a number N of parameters from 
a larger number M > N of measurements. The method assumes that there is a linear 
dependency among the parameters measured.
Let z(M × 1) be the vector of the measured values, x(N × 1) the vector of the 
parameters, and A(M × N) the matrix that represents the linear dependency be-
tween the measured values and the parameters. The relationship among them is 
expressed as: 
	
z
Ax
=
	
(B.2)
The system of equations represented by (B.2), being M > N, does not have a 
unique solution. We are interested in finding a particular solution xLS that mini-
mizes the square norm of the error

equating to zero the derivative of q with respect to the vector x, taking into account 
the following identities valid for any square matrix B:

Antennas and Phased Array Antennas
The antenna is a reciprocal transducer between free-space propagation and the 
transmission line internal to the EW equipment. The term reciprocal refers to the 
fact that it can operate in either the Tx or Rx mode. The function of the antenna 
during transmission is to concentrate the radiated energy within a shaped beam in 
the direction of its boresight. On reception, the antenna collects the energy coming 
within its beam from the free space and delivers it to the receiver.
Antennas normally used in the radar bands have shaped, highly directive pat-
terns that can be mechanically scanned in one or two angular directions (azimuth 
and elevation) through the movements of one or two pedestals on which they are 
installed or by electronic means such as in the phased array type of antenna. The 
vast majority of past generation radars used parabolic reflectors in various forms. 
Most current generation designs employ planar phased arrays. Antennas used in 
the communication bands are usually designed for omnidirectional coverage, with 
the exception of those used for point-to-point transmission (i.e., radio links), which 
are similar to those used in the radar bands.
The ability of an antenna to concentrate energy in a particular direction is 
called directive gain GD. The directive gain is defined as the ratio between the max-
imum radiation intensity per unit solid angle, which occurs within the main beam 
having dimensions θB and φB (the half power beamwidth in radians, respectively, in 
the two orthogonal planes), to the average radiation intensity over the whole solid 
angle (4π steradians). Assuming P to be the total power radiated by the antenna, 
this definition can be expressed as follows:

The definition given above does not provide the effective power radiated by 
the antenna but merely its ability to concentrate the radiated energy within the 
main beam. To take into account the effect of the antenna losses, a power gain G 
is defined that provides a measure of the effective power radiated within the main 
beam and is proportional to the directive gain through the antenna efficiency factor 
η (typically η = 0.55 to 0.65 for good antennas):

From antenna electromagnetic theory [1], an antenna can be considered a pla-
nar aperture of different shapes provided with an illumination (or current distri-
bution) I(x,y) over the aperture that in the far-field region of the antenna (i.e., at 
distances R > RFF = 2D2/λ, where D is the maximum size of the aperture and λ is the 
wavelength) produces an electric field vector intensity pattern E(R,θ,φ):

is equivalent to the normalized power radiation pattern P(θ,φ) of the antenna.
Usually the aperture illumination I(x’,y’) can be assumed [2] to be of the type 
I(x’,y’) = I1(x’)I2(y’), that is, the product of two independent distributions along the 
two aperture coordinates. Equation (C.5) then becomes:

Uniform illumination is the most efficient aperture distribution (so ρa = 1 for 
this illumination), but presents a first sidelobe amplitude of only –13.2 dB with re-
spect to the peak amplitude. The beamwidth, as measured between the half-power 
points, is θB = 0.88λ/a (rad) or θB = 51λ/a (deg). The reduction of the first sidelobe 
level is achieved by tapering the illumination at the extremes of the aperture at the 
expense of aperture efficiency (ρa < 1) as reported in [3].
A special case is constituted by a circular aperture whose radiation pattern, due 
to the symmetry in the aperture plane, is a solid of rotation only dependent from 
the angle θ with respect to the boresight. The radiation pattern for a uniformly il-

C.1  Antenna Types 
One of the most widely used radar antennas is the parabolic reflector. The geo-
metrical properties of the parabola provide that the path lengths of any ray coming 
from the focus, where the feed is placed, and reflected from the parabolic surface, 
are the same to a plane perpendicular the parabola axis. Thus, the point energy 
source placed at the feed is transformed into a plane wavefront at the output of the 
parabola.
Among the various reflector antenna types used in the radars we mention here 
only two: the Cassegrain reflector, which is often used in tracking radars, and the 
cosecant-squared reflector, which is largely used in 2D surveillance radars.
The principle of the Cassegrain antenna is shown in Figure C.3. The feed is 
placed at the vertex of the parabolic reflector in front of a hyperbolic subreflector. 
The plane wavefront coming from a target at long distance is transformed into a 
convergent beam at the feed (which is the real focus of the antenna) by the subre-
flector (which acts as a secondary focus). The Cassegrain reflector antenna has the 
advantages of reducing the axial dimension of the antenna and providing an easy 
connection of the feed to the radar Tx/Rx lines. A photograph of the Selex SI NA30 
tracking radar, which uses a twisted polarization Cassegrain reflector, is shown in 
Figure 2.59 of Chapter 2. 
Figure C.2  Radiation pattern of uniform (light grey) and cosine (black) aperture illumination.

Appendix C 
367
The cosecant-squared reflector antenna is used in surveillance radars in order 
to shape the large elevation beam in accordance with a pattern proportional to 
cosec2ε, where ε is the elevation angle. This produces a constant power echo signal 
from a target flying at constant altitude H as shown in Figure C.4.

Appendix C
C.2  Array Antennas
An array antenna consists of a number n (n ≥ 2) of individual radiating elements, 
suitably spaced with respect to one another in a lattice. The relative amplitude and 
phase of the signals applied to each of the elements are controlled to obtain the 
desired radiation pattern from the combined action of all (or part of) the elements. 
The array can be considered to be an aperture with a discrete number of radiators 
instead of an infinite number as is the case for a full radiating surface. As such, the 
array is characterized by the same parameters as an antenna, such as gain, polariza-
tion, beamwidth, and sidelobe levels, but with the exception that the parameters 
need to be determined as a function of the scan angle of the beam.
The array elements themselves dictate many of the array properties such as the 
array polarization, spatial coverage, operating bandwidth, and mutual coupling of 
elements within the array lattice. The array elements can consist of dipoles, slots, 
spirals, and wideband flared notch (Vivaldi) radiators. Three geometrical forms of 
array antennas are of interest in the EW domain: the linear array, the planar array, 
and the conformal array. A linear array consists of elements arranged along one 
straight line. A planar array is a 2D configuration of elements arranged to lie in a 
plane. A conformal array is a 1D or 2D configuration of elements arranged to lie 
along a curved line or a curved surface.
Relevant to the direction of the maximum radiation, the array can be classi-
fied as a broadside array or an endfire array when the direction of the maximum 
radiation is, respectively, perpendicular or parallel to the line or plane where the 
elements lie. Endfire arrays have not been widely used in the radar bands. Endfire 
linear arrays are more commonly used in the communication bandwidth when 
medium gain and large beamwidth are required.
The performance parameters of a phased array [1] can be directly derived from 
(C.3) by considering the far-field radiation pattern of the nth element of the array 
shown in Figure C.5, which is:

where
gn(u,v) = a vector quantity, normalized to unity at its peak, that represents the 
far-field pattern of the radiating element, including polarization and taking into 
consideration the effects of mutual coupling with the other array elements;
an = complex weight (i.e., amplitude and phase); also called excitation of the nth
element in the array;
the other symbols are the same as those defined for (C.3).
In the determination of the array radiation pattern, we can omit the factor 
e–jkR/R, which is a factor common to all of the elements of the array, and follow 
the approach of (C.3), which in this case in lieu of the integral extended to the

This general expression is valid for any type of array. Let us now consider some 
more simple expressions relevant to regular linear and planar arrays, that is, arrays 
that show a periodicity in one or two dimensions.
In the case of a regular linear array, the elements are spaced at a distance dx 
from each other, and the distance ρ’ = x’x0 = ndxx0 so that the exponential in (C.10) 
becomes exp(jkndxu). Further, we can assume that the element radiation pattern is 
the same for all of the array elements and hence (C.10) becomes:

which shows that the linear array radiation pattern can be expressed as the product 
of the vector element pattern g(u,v) (assumed the same for all elements in the ar-
ray) and a scalar algebraic term Fa(u). This term can be defined as the array factor 
when the peak value is normalized to a unity value. If the phases ψn of the element 
excitations are assumed to be ψn = 0, the peak value of Fa(u) is reached for u = 0.
An important consideration can be drawn from (C.11) by considering that if 
the phases ψn of the element excitations are assumed to be ψn = –knu0 then the 
argument of the exponential becomes jkndx(u – u0) and the array factor becomes 
Fa(u – u0). That is, the pattern peak is shifted to u = u0 and the radiation pattern 
plotted in the u coordinates does not change its shape (i.e., beamwidth and sidelobe 
level) for that shift.

An important special case occurs when all excitation amplitudes are the same 
and can be assumed to be |an| = 1 for all n. In such a case the array factor has an 
explicit expression, by recognizing that the summation is in effect the summation 
of the terms of a geometrical series of ratio exp(jkdxu), which gives

(C.12)
The array factor of  (C.12) at the wavelength λ for a regular linear array of 16 
elements spaced as dx = 0.5λ and uniformly excited is shown in Figures C.6(a) and 
(b), respectively, for the beam pointing at u(0°,0°) and u0(60°,0°).
From Figure C.6(a) we can determine that the –3-dB beamwidth θB at broad-
side (θ = 0°,φ = 0°) is θB0 = 0.866λ/N dx, whereas when scanned to u0(θscan°,0°) it 
becomes θB,scan = θB0/cosθscan; that is, it widens with the scan angle.
From the preceding expression of the –3-dB beamwidth, we can see that as the 
frequency changes the pattern broadens at lower frequencies and narrows at higher 
frequencies as shown in Figure C.7.
Similarly to that shown for aperture illumination, the uniform excitation of the 
elements results in the highest gain for the array but it provides a first sidelobe of 
only –13.2 dB with respect to the peak , with the other sidelobes decaying asymp-
totically as 1/(n+1/2) for large n. 
A further consideration relevant to the shift of the array beam to the direction 
u0 by impressing on each element a phase shift ψn = –knu0 is that a change of the 
frequency from f0 = c/λ0 to f0+Δf = c/(λ0 – Δλ) with no change in the element phase 
shifters setting provides a further shift of the beam-pointing from u0 to u = u0f0/
(f0+Δf); the beam is squinting toward the broadside if Δf > 0 and away from broad-
side if Δf < 0. It can be shown that a 3-dB loss in signal reception is incurred when 
the frequency shift Δf is such that:

This equation indicates a limit in the phased array system bandwidth that is 
more stringent the larger the number of elements in the array (i.e., the narrower is 
its beamwidth). The above limit is overcome if the phase impressed to each element 
by the excitation is provided through time-delay lines (whose phase is invariant 
with the frequency). The beam squint due to frequency variation of 5% is shown 
in Figure C.8 for a 16-element linear array pointing at (30°,0°) (element spacing 
0.75λ).
From  (C.12) note that when scanning the beam to u0 at the increase of the 
width of the spacing dx with respect to the wavelength λ (i.e., an increase of the 
ratio dx/λ), the scanned beam is accompanied by the appearance of a new lobe, 
called a grating lobe, in a direction opposite to the scanning direction, as shown in 
Figure C.9.

The grating lobe conditions for a linear array at wavelength λ can be deter-
mined from the exponential of the terms in the summation of the scanned array 
factor Fa(u – u0), which is jkndx(u –u0).
Due to its periodicity the exponential has a zero value for every direction ug

Equation (C.15) defines a set of beams displaced from the main scanned beam

1 are real radiation beams, whereas the ones that appear in the “imaginary space” 
|ug| ≥1, are not radiating energy.

The condition of avoiding grating lobes in real space while scanning the beam

Note that small arrays, as commonly used in the EW domain, might have a

imaginary space, they can still have a contribution in the real space. Therefore, for 
these relatively small arrays it is useful to select the spacing dx such that the grating 
lobe is at least one-half beamwidth, θB/2, beyond the imaginary space boundary:

The triangular lattice allows for elements to be saved with respect to the square 
lattice in a planar array of given area size. This can be noted from Figure C.12 for 
the case of an equilateral triangular lattice where within an area A = dx·2dy we 
count six elements for the rectangular lattice and five elements for the triangular 
lattice (i.e., a spare of 16.6% in the number of elements).

Analog Modulation Methods
D.1  Amplitude Modulation
The AM technique is shown in Figure D.1 where the carrier c(t)= cos2πfct is modu-
lated by the signal m(t). The spectrum of finite bandwidth Δf is shown in Figure 
D.1(a) at baseband and in Figure D.1(b) when translated by the carrier. 
The shape of the spectrum can be easily deducted by considering a modulat-
ing signal constituted by a single tone m(t) = cos2πfmt with fm < fc. In this case the 
output signal of Figure D.1 is

Because the AM is linear, the bandwidth of the spectrum reproduces the one at 
baseband. The modulation method reported in Figure D.1(c) is relevant to the case 
of double-sideband (DSB) AM. Further AM methods perform (1) suppression of 
the carrier using a method called DSB-SC (suppressed carrier) and (2) suppression 
of one sideband, using a method called single sideband. In particular, if the sup-
pressed bandwidth is indicated by a 1 in the figure, it is termed upper sideband; if 
indicated by a 2, it is termed lower sideband. One of the bands can be suppressed as 
each of the sidebands contains the same information, thus increasing the efficiency 
of the modulation method.

An effective and simple FM modulator is constituted by a VCO, in which the 
output frequency of oscillation is controlled by the input voltage m(t) (provided 
that is slowly changing with respect to the oscillator frequency, which in our case 
is fm << fc). 
The derivation of the PM spectrum can be conducted in the same manner as 
that for the FM spectrum. We consider the modulation signal m(t) to be a single 
tone m(t)= M cos2πfmt with fm << fc. The same results apply. In particular Carson’s 
rule is the same as (D.4) above (with the exception that now β = PM modulation 
index = Δf/fPM, where fPM is the largest modulating frequency). 
D.3  Quadrature Modulation
Two pieces of data, A and B, normally associated with digital communications, can 
be transmitted at the same time if they are modulating the carrier frequency with 
orthogonal or quadrature waveforms, such as  and . The quadrature modulation 
method is depicted in Figure D.3.
The transmitted signal  is processed in the upper branch of the receiver. The 
relevant integrator, which integrates over a number p of periods T = 1/fc, produces 
a signal y1(t) at the output:

Following the same calculations as above, it can be shown that the output of 
the lower branch of the receiver is y2(t) = kB .
The quadrature method shown in Figure D.3 requires that the transmitter and 
the receiver LOs be synchronized in order to be coherent in phase with one another 
and that the integration be performed in exactly a period pT. If that is not the case, 
the outputs can be different from kA and kB. This is why the quadrature modula-
tion method is utilized only in digital communications; because the expected out-
put from the upper receiver can be either kA or –kA and it is easier to assign the 
more likely expected value is the output is different fromkA.

Evaluation of BER Increase for Noise and 
CW Tone Jamming in Communication 
Systems Employing BFSK Modulation
The most common form of frequency modulation is binary frequency shift key 
(BFSK) modulation, where two tones f1 and f2 are used to transmit, respectively, 
a binary symbol “0” or “1.” By using 2n frequencies (MFSK), it is possible to 
transmit n binary bits per frequency. The FSK method allows noncoherent detec-
tion techniques in the receiver, which allows for the use of oscillators that do not 
need to maintain phase coherency over large frequency changes as is required by 
MFSK modulation or FFH communication. Those oscillators are, however, capable 
of maintaining coherency within a hop of a SFH communication. The schematic 
block diagram of a MFSK communication transmitter is shown in Figure E.1.
To evaluate the effect of jamming on BFSK communication, let us consider 
the mechanics of superheterodyne detection. The receiver detector structure for 
noncoherent BFSK detection is shown in Figure E.2, where the channel level can 
be recognized as the identical structure used for the radar noncoherent detection 
analyzed in Appendix A.
The signals xi(t) after the two bandpass filters, centered, respectively, at f1 = fc 
– δf and f2 = fc + δf, are ideally expressed as follows, where the indexes i and k are 
used so that the two channels can be considered generic:

the receiver.

The envelope detector outputs r1(t) and r2(t) are the ideal envelopes of the nar-
rowband input x1(t) and x2(t), respectively. The output symbol z(pT) of the receiver 
is based on the larger envelope sample between the two channel outputs at each 
signaling interval T.
By expressing the narrowband noise and jamming processes in terms of quadra-
ture components, we get

average power N. Because there is no bandwidth overlap between the two passband 
filters, then nci and nck (and similarly nsi and nsk) are also statistically independent 
processes. With these assumptions let us assume that the symbol “1” is transmitted 
with frequency f2.. The probability density functions (pdfs) of r1(t) and r2(t), in the

In the presence of jamming two possibilities have to be considered: (1) The 
jammer places an extra noise of power J in each of the two channels or (2) the 
jammer places its extra noise of power J in one channel only. In the first case the 
probability of error is easily evaluated by considering in (E.7) the total noise power

In the second case the noise power in the two channels is different; in one we 
have only N and in the other N + J. With some mathematical passages similar to 
the earlier ones and with the same assumption about the a priori probabilities of 
sending the two symbols ,we have:

the tone may have at the same frequency of the bandpass channel a random phase φ 
that is uniformly distributed in [0.2π]. Reference [1] shows that this phase provides 
an important multiplicative contribution (because it is independent of the other 
factors) to the probability of error. This is especially true if it is in the same data 
channel, because it may reinforce the signal rather than produce an error.
The probability of error, with both pdfs now being Rician, can be expressed [2] 
in terms of the Q-function, which is defined as:

About the Author
Dr. Andrea De Martino graduated (Laurea) in nuclear engineering (electronic track) 
in 1970 and began his career as a researcher in the field of large systems theory 
and automatic control at the Electronic Engineering Institute of the University of 
Rome (1970–1971), where he then achieved a Ph.D. in automatic control systems 
in 1977. After completion of military duty as lieutenant in the Italian Air Force 
(1971–1972) he joined Selenia S.p.A—Rome/Pomezia, from 1972 to 1985,where 
he was involved in radar systems holding positions from radar system designer 
to chief engineer, ranging from surveillance and tracking radars to multifunction 
phased arrays radars, and he was then appointed as head of the land and shipboard 
EW systems department.
 In 1985 he joined Elettronica S.p.A–Rome where he covered a number of de-
partment head positions ranging from new EW products, microwave to EFA-DASS 
(now Praetorian) equipment, and since 1999 he has held the position of chief tech-
nical officer. He was also appointed as technical director of the Euro-DASS Con-
sortium, which comprises Selex Galileo (UK), Indra (Sp) and EADS (Ger), keeping 
that position from 2002 to 2009.
Dr. De Martino is holder of several patents, and author of many technical pa-
pers on radar and EW equipment techniques and technologies presented at various 
classified/unclassified conferences and appearing in specialized magazines.
