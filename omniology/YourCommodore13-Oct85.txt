ACTIVISION HAS PRODUCED A COM-
prehensive range o f  games f o r  t he
autumn varying from a simulation of the
Tour de France to the discovery of a tiny
being living inside your M.
The company has signed up world
champion boxer, Barry McGuigan, t o
endorse its new boxing game. Released at
the end of August, Activision claims that
the game "incorporates his ﬁghting style
and u n iq u e  s k ills  r ig h t  i n t o  t h e
gameplay."
The Great American Cross Country
Race is a driving simulation which takes
you on a coast to coast trip across the USA.
Terrain, time of day, weather reports and
distance must all be taken into account so
there's plenty to think about. You must
also watch your fuel and look out for
police speed traps.
Somebody's in  M y  Computer is a
totally new idea in games. According to
Activision, a little known fact is that there
is a  tiny  person liv ing inside every
computer. Ac tiv is ion n o w  has  t h e
technology to enable you to see and make
contact with this little friend. You can tell
him to do things, take care of him or just
watch as he goes about his business. And
no two are the same.

image packaging routines.
According to Stem Computing, there
are numerous uses for  the product:
pattern recognition, security, spatial
measurement and education.

too down to earth for you then one of
Activision's other offerings may be your
cup of tea. Rescue on Fractutus is a space

Goin has been delving into its
secrets for your
l
.
THE QUALITY OF C64 GAMES HAS IM-
proved in sophistication over the past
year, mainly as a result of the American
invasion of the British market. Now our
own software houses are ﬁghting back.
William W o b b l e r  b y  Wiz a r d
Development's T ony  Crowther illu-
strates this upward curve by exhibiting
not only graphical complexity but also a
well planned gaming system.
The hero of this new action adventure
is an odd looking, slinking character who
shufﬂes across the screen in search of
small pieces o f  a  larger puzzle, the
solution of which carries a prize worth
£1000. The only way to ﬁnd out what the
prize will be is to buy the game and solve
the puzzle because the pieces form a
picture of the prize.
William's wor ld is  a  labyrinth o f
tunnels and passages which are entered
by jumping down hollowed out tree-
stumps. There are 10 stumps in all laid out
across the length o f  almost as many
screens. As  William walks his  head
wobbles up and down and although he
can duck under ﬂying frogs and falling
rocks his  head has a  nasty habit o f
wobbling back up quite quickly so timing
is vital.
On entering a hole at the beginning of
the game the way is often blocked by a
droid which can only be destroyed by the
glowing orb hidden in the only droidless
hole in the game. The pathway to the orb
G a m e  O f  T h .  M o n t h

MONTH
is punctuated with small pools of water
and stepping stones which William must
jump if he is to succeed. Touching the
water literally makes him fall to piecesand
as if that wasn't enough, there are falling
rocks to be ducked.
The only way to enter another hole
after negotiating your way back from the
orb's hiding place is to jump down an exit
hole to the lower passageway which is
inhabited b y  ﬂying frogs and snakes
which mean instant disintegration for
William if he's not careful. At the end of
this passage is a rope to climb but players
will also see a signpost marked 'Save
Game'. Following along in the direction
of the sign brings William to a disk drive
which allows you to save your position to
tape but ﬁrst you must ﬁnd the disk which
operates the drive. Nothing is easy in this
game.
On reaching t h e  surface again,
William has to get down another tree-
stump without being hit in the back of the
neck by a pesky bluebird or by being
clobbered by the club carried by his irate
mother-in-law.
When William needs any object which
he has collected, it appears automatically,
demonstrating whether or not the thing
you are facing is dangerous or not. Or
does this mean the object has to be picked
up?
This is the major difﬁculty because you
only get one life per game and a fatal

choice means the loss of all your objects
and a restart to the game, unless you have
found the disk which does not appear
until you have ventured well into the
maze. There is also an object in one of the
caves w hic h w i l l  mak e y o u  d r o p
everything, you are carrying and replaces
them where they were originally.
One of the problems to be overcome
would make Indiana Jones cringe. A
gigantic red ball rolls towards William,
totally blocking the tunnel. There is a way
to pass this point but I'm not allowed to
divulge the secret, however I will say that
there is a key object hidden on the other
side of the ball.
Some of the tunnels end in doorways
which are always locked and frequently
booby trapped. The trap could be on the
outside or the inside and the keys are
hidden elsewhere in the labyrinth. For
example, one key hangs from the roof of a
cave. To reach it William must have a
piece of pipe but its retrieval blocks off
the only exit. To escape he must shoot at a
target but this implies the ownership of a
gun. No gun, no chance.
Scattered liberally through the caves
are the dues for the competition and a
tally is kept of the number found on a
wobbly scrolling scoreboard a t  t h e
bottom of the screen.
This game makes full use of the 64 and
it is rumoured that their are only a handful
of bytes lef t  unused i n  this  mega-
adventure which will become an essential
addition to any gameplayer's library.

GREETINGS, ACTION FANS! WE BOUNCE
back this month with some fabulous tips
and tricks for your own arcade games
programs, plus a gander at some of the
latest offerings to hit the shops, and
strategies for some new games.
Poke in the eye dept.
Here are some interesting POKEs for you
to use in your games programs, to clobber
the chances of any unscrupulous person,
i.e. me, from cracking your game and
stealing it.

Transatlantic Preview
Track and Field (Konami/Atari) is the best
sports game I've played since Daley
Thompson ﬁrst threw a javelin. This is a
conversion from the real arcade machine
which started the whole sports game
fetish in the ﬁrst place. You can play
against the computer or a real opponent,
with a split screen depicting each player's
progress, a lot like Pitstop II.
I think it's the best, but that's just my
opinion. Try it yourself, when it comes out
over here!
Bob's yer uncle
I've been playing Bounty Bob Strikes Back
(Big Five/US Gold) lately, and I have
achieved a certain competence; that is to
say I breached the elusive 30,000 score,
which t o  m y  mind constitutes a
reasonable score on most games (good
rule of thumb, that). My current hi-score
is 46,880, and I got to Bob's Playroom as
well (Level 4, I think!),
I like this game for several reasons. It
plays well, the music is entertaining and
not in the least irritating, and it has the
most amusing hi-score table I've ever
seen. The sort routine to enable the little
birds to pick up the letters and place them
in the table is an awesome piece of
programming, and that is before you even
get to the game. A lot of games claim
"arcade quality", but Bounty Bob has it.
I'd happily push my 10 pences into this
one.
Let's do the time warp again II
I keep mentioning the Rocky Horror
Show, as I've had the  Spectrum
(arrrrghhhhl Pass the Cruciﬁx!) version
for some time. All my observations on the
game had until now been based on this
altogether inferior version. I can report
with pleasure that the new C64 version is
better! It's more difﬁcult to complete.
the music is what a friend of mine would
call fazz (good), and the sound effects are
more than appropriate. BUT (and as you
can see, that's a big but) the sprites let it all
down a  bit. I've seen multicoloured
sprites that would knock yer eyes off, but
these are chunky to say the least, and
more multicoloured lo-res to say the
most. Otherwise a  super game and
certainly well worth a bash.
Hot tips
Bounty Bob: The way the joystick controls
Bob can be very precise. To jump onto a
close platform push the ﬁre button and
just nudge the joystick in the desired
direction on his way down. Ignore the
mutants and only kill them if they're
getting in your way. Highest scoring
settings: difﬁculty on medium, bonus at
10,000, and lives four.
Strangetoop: Tricky this one. Best
advice I can give you is to blast all the
swarf in every room before you move on.
to make sure it can't multiply again.
Rock'N'Bott: Make good use of the
Practise Mode (unlimited lives) to suss
the levels out before you begin a game
Better luck next time dept.
Past ﬁnder (Activision) promised to be
a really good game. The graphics ain't bad
and the sound is fairly good...but it's so
ﬂippin' boring! Who cares whether you
make it to the top of the screen or not?
Activision should really make the senarios
more entertaining, as I really couldn't
bear to play this game for more than 10
minutes before I reset and loaded Bounty
Bob again. Try it out in the shop before
you buy it, and see what you think.
Breakdance (EPYX/CBS) should be
very good, but I couldn't shake the feeling
of playing a sort of breakdancing space
invaders, and paying a lot of spons for t he
privilege! Technically a  very good
program, but largely uninteresting and, I
suspect, just a  piece of bandwagon
hopping. Epyx doesn't need to do this. It's
a good enough company to make much
more original games, without this kind of
cheap shot.
Ooops! my mistake dept.
My profuse apologies to English Software.
Last month I featured Henry's House in
my Transatlantic Preview spot. I  was
misinformed as they are actually a bunch
of Mancunian lads, revealing a trap I for
one always fall into; just because a piece
of software has superb state-of-the-art
graphics doesn't mean that the said piece
of software comes from across the
Atlantic. There is a great deal of World
Leading programming talent on this little
island (lots that we don't know about yet
too!) and I promise I won't forget that
from now on. (Take 100 lines, Flippo—Ed.)
I reiterate my appraisal of last month:
Henry's House is a very good game.
Support your local programmers.

Listings will be much easier to
enter with our new systemll
COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
For this reason Your Commodore
started to precede any control characters
with a REM statement on the previous line
that explained exactly what the black
blobs were meant to be. Unfortunately
the graphics characters w er e n o t
documented and these still cause some
confusion_ For this reason we are starting
to use a new method for marking the
control and graphic characters in our
listings.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT] means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.

Maths Part Two
LAST MONTH WE LOOKED AT HOW THE
C64 along with some software, can help
the pre-school child get to grips with basic
number learning.
Once this, the most important hurdle,
is over and the child is at school, the
computer must take a secondary role in
his education. This is not because there is
no suitable software available - quite the
contrary - but because the child should
be doing sufﬁcient at school without extra
work being thrust upon him at home.
However, if your child is slipping behind
with his work or i f he shows a real
enthusiasm and wants to do extra, there
are numerous programs to look at.
Let's start by looking at some programs
which re-cap the four basics of arithmetic
- addition, subtraction, multipliction and
division. There are numerous programs
which deal with this aspect of number
work, it is also the easiest to get wrong.
Some programs are straightforward teach
and test and can be very dry and boring.
These can do more harm than good.
Others use the capabilities of the 64 to
'create eye-catching graphics which grab
the child's attention and hold it so the
child is learning without really being
aware of it. At any age, more learning is
done in an atmosphere of fun than by
having it force fed. Several Publishers
have recognised this and in consequence
have produced some fun to play games
which also teach and/or test.
Shards Software has a lovely program
in the Fun to Learn series. Monster Maths
is a collection of programs which cover
size estimation, mental arithmetic, multi-
plication tables and logic. Each game has a
different format but is written to give
maximum fun whilst still helping the user
to learn. In one game the player feeds in a
friend's name and then tries to answer
three questions correctly in a speciﬁed
time. If the player is successful his friend is
eaten by a monster, if not he himself is
eaten.
Another part of the tape covers multi-
plication tables - one of the bugbears of
education. I believe they are an essential
part o f mathematical training. Should
your child's school be one where they are
not taught there are some packages on
the market to help.
Collins produces Know Your Tables.
This is a cassette and booklet set which
works steadily through tables up to 10.
The booklet has lots of related exercises
and shows the user the
by the numbers.
McGraw-Hill has just released a
collection called Ladders to  Learning.
Included i n  this series are cassettes
dealing with addition, subtraction and
problem solving. There are also titles
dealing with multiplication and division.
The child is led through the maze of learn-
ing tables by a cartoon character, Henry
Hilo, and his friend a number machine.
Once multiplication is mastered division
can be tackled, and this time Henry shows
that if the child can do subtraction and
mtiltiplication he can divide.
My overall favourite for learning and
using basic number rules is Number
Tumblers b y  Fisher-Price. This i s a '
cartridge based game in which you have
to bounce a ﬁgure around a grid using the
numbers and operators to make a series of
totals. The game can b e  played b y
children a n d  adults alike as th e
parameters can be set to a very simple or
extremely difﬁcult level. The game can be
fast and furious and calls for quick
thinking especially when playing against
the computer.
These basic four rules cover many other
topics: telling the time, using money,
fractions, decimals and graph work.
Collins and Good Housekeeping both
have packages dealing with telling the
time. M r  T Tells the Time uses the
computers graphics to create pictures to
teach the position of the numbers on the
clock face and the rudiments of telling the
time, Collins' What's the Time uses a
cassette and booklet approach to learning
patterns formed
about the quarter hours, half hours and
hours. It uses both analogue and digital
clocks in its examples.
For a completely different approach
look at A.S.K.'s Time Trucker. This consists
of three games in which the player guides
a truck around a map collecting fruit and
vegetables and taking it to market. In the
ﬁrst game, every time the driver stops to
collect produce he has to clock in;
however the clock on the screen is an
analogue clock and the time has to be
entered in a digital form. All good fun and
very educational.
Fractions, decimals and graph work
are all covered by the Ladders to Learning
series. There is also a cassette which
explains algebra. They follow the same
formula as the previously mentioned
Ladders to Learning series. Henri Hilo
explains simply and logically each subject
making fu l l  use o f  th e  graphics
capabilities o f  th e  machine. Test
questions are set to see if the child is
understanding everything.
This sort of program should not be
used as matter of course at home. If your
child is having problems at school or
wants to do extra work, see the class
teacher involved before deciding to
purchase anything and then try to have a
good look at the programs available in
your local shops. Whatever you do, don't
force your child. You may put them off
mathematics and thus defeat the object of
the exercise. Numbers can be magic and
your Commodore can help you show
your child the fun.

In the ﬁrst of a new series,

HOW M A N Y  T IMES H A VE Y O U
thought how nice it would be to have a
Basic command to perform a particular
function? The kind which would normally
require a convoluted piece of Basic code,
or a short machine code routine called by
a SYS command. Adding extra commands
to Basic on the C64 is not difﬁcult and can
make writing Basic programs a lot quicker
and easier.
There are of course a considerable
number o f  commercially produced
extended Basic packages. But, being able
to add and create your own commands is
much more fun and allows the commands
to be tailored to your particular needs.
This article is the ﬁrst of a series which
will include the code for adding a whole
range of very useful commands to your
Basic interpreter. This article includes the
code for the all-important control wedges
which allow the new Basic commands to
work. It is essential that these routines are
in memory before any attempt is made to
add command routines.
The following routines are the start of
the Basic extension code. These are the
main control routines which patch the
extra commands into the C64's Basic. They
should be used in the order they appear in
this article and the accompanying listings.
Initialisation
This section of code contains the initial-
isation routines and the table of added
commands an d  t h eir vectors. T h e
commands are initialised by calling the
cold start (SFFC2 - 64738) which simulates
a standard power-up. The routines cannot
be used with a cartridge in place as they
take up the same locations and are
designed to be capable of being placed
on a cartridge ROM if required.
The routine labelled 'COLD' is the
power-up routine an d  t h e  routine
labelled 'WRST' is the NMI routine. The
NMI routine makes sure that the function
key and lister wedge routines are not
disabled. Note that the table of added
commands and their addresses can be
changed and added to by the user. The
commands given in the table refer to
commands which will be added to this
package later in the series. Any reader
assembling this portion of the code will
get a 'Label not present' error from the
CADDR table unless a dummy routine is
set up for every added Basic command
which has not yet been implented. This
routine simply takes the following form:
XXXXXX JMP SAHIB
Crunch to Tokens
where XXXXXX is the label. Thus, since the
ﬁrst two commands are included at the
end of this article a total of 30 dummy
routines are required at this stage, which
can b e  removed as the appropriate
commands are added. Such a  set of
dummy routines is shown in the ﬁle. LIB
DUMMY at the end of the listings.
This routine is wedged into the Crunch-
token link at locations $0304-$0305 (772-
773). Crunch to tokens will take the input
line and convert all command words to
one (normal) o r two (Extended) byte
token values. This does exactly the same
as the original Basic version except that
the extended keyword table is checked
before the normal Basic table.
Crunch to tokens is done directly after
the warm start routine e.lcounters a
carriage return. It makes no difference
whether the command is direct mode or
for entering or deleting a line in memory.
Tokens to Text
This routine is wedged into the Print-
token link at locations $0306-50307 (774-
775). Tokens to text is used in the list
command only to convert any token value
(greater than 127 for Basic or preceded by
SEE - 238 for Extended Basic) back into the
copmmand word and print it to the
output device.
Execute Statement
This routine is wedged into the Start new
Basic code link at locations S030840309
(776-777). This is the control part of the
main Basic interpreter loop and takes a
token value and executes the routine via
the vector table in the initialisation,
There is a special case routine for
PRINT which uses the same token as in
normal Basic but the routine has been re-
written to allow the CIL command.
Execute Arithmetic
This routine is wedged into the Arith-
metic link at locations $030A-030B (778-

779). This routine is called by Evaluate
expression and transfers control to one of
the four arithmetic routines included in
this package. I f  t h e  Extended Basic
command i s  n o t  o n e  o f  t h e  f our
arithmetic routines, 'syntax error' is
Output.
Function keys
This routine is wedged into the keyboard
table set-up vector at locations $028F-
$0290 (655-656). The routine checks if the
computer is in direct or program mode. If
in direct, the normal routine is executed,
if in program mode, the quotes ﬂag is
checked and if set, the normal routine is
executed.
The current key pressed is checked for
one of the four function keys and the shift
key. If it is a function key, the text for that
key is read from behind the Basic ROM
and put into the keyboard buffer until all
eight characters or a zero byte terminator
is found. If not a function key, the normal
routine is executed.
Program Lister
This routine is wedged into the INPUT
vector at locations $032440325 (804-805).
It exactly simulates the normal input
routine. First the input device is checked
for keyboard. If not found, the normal
routine is executed. Direct mode is then
checked for and if not found, the normal
routine is again executed.
The next part of the routine is copied
directly from the kernal routine except
that the cursor down key is checked for
and, if found, then the cursor position is
checked. I f  the cursor is not on the
bottom line of the screen, the cursor
down character is printed. If the cursor is
on the bottom line, instead of printing
cursor down, the next line number is
found and that line listed (any output
device).
NOTE: there is no check for quotes so if
you're entering a line on the bottom line
of the screen, the line will be wiped out
and a line listed if you press the cursor
down key even from within quotes.
When the last line of the program is
listed, the cursor will remain at the end of
the line, cursor down again will produce
the message:
Print
END OF PROGRAM
after this, the program will start listing
from the beginning again.
The purpose of this routine is to PRINT
characters t o  the open C MD  output
channel (usually value three -  screen).
This version of PRINT does exactly the

same as the Basic PRINT except that a
check has been made f o r  the CTL
command to be included. The syntax for
this modiﬁed command is exactly the
same as that of the Basic PRINT command.
The First Extended Basic
Command
CIL
Abbreviated entry: C(shift)T
Affected Bask abbreviation: none
Token: Hex SEE,S02 Decimal 238,2
Modes: Direct, program, and in PRINT
statements
Purpose: To replace cursor and colour
characters, screen and border pokes, thus
improving the ability t o  position the
cursor anywhere on the screen. If the
value is not speciﬁed, the current value is
used_
Syntax: CTL ([x][,[yib[cc]i,[sc][,[bcll,[cls
Where x is the column position of the
cursor (0-39), y is the row position of the
cursor (0-24), cc is the cursor colour, sc the
screen colour. bc is the border colour (0-
15), and cls is a ﬂag for clearing the screen
(0 - no, 2 - yes).
Erros: Syntax error - if the syntax is not as
above.
Illegal quantity-if the values are out of
range.
Use: CTL i5 a powerful screen handling
routine. Cursor, screen, and border
colours can be set with a number (0-15),
and t h e  cursor c an b e  positioned
anywhere on the screen by entering the x
position (0-39). There is also a screen clear
ﬂag that, if set to 1', will clear the screen
before positioning the cursor. To make it
easier t o  describe, her e ar e a  few
examples and what they do.
CTL (20) positions cursor at middle of
current line
CTL (0,0) moves cursor to 0,0 (home
position)
CIL („1) sets cursor colour to white
CTL („,0) sets screen colour to black
CTL („„0) sets border colour to black
CTL („,„1) clears screen leaving cursor at
current position
CIL (20,12,5,0,11,1) clears screen (1), sets
screen to black (0), border to medium
grey (11), cursor colour to green (5), and
cursor position to column 20, row 12.
To print something at a speciﬁed location
on the screen:
PRINT CTL (x,y)"text"CIL(x1,y1)"more
text"
Routine entry point: $88AB
Routine operation: The current settings
of the ﬁve parameters are read and the
screen clear ﬂag is set to O. The open
brackets character is scanned past and
each of the six values is read if present,
checking t o  see i f  there is a closing
bracket. When the closing bracket is
found, the screen is cleared if the ﬂag is
set to 1, and the other values are stored in
their own locations.

Dave Crisp has been looking
at serious business software
from Gemini — here's his
verdict.
THIS LITTLE OFFERING COMES FROM
Gemini a company purporting to be the
home of  "serious software". The title
suggests that Gemini has more business
goodies in the pipeline arid the "serious
software" slogan bears some thinking
about. Looking u p  "serious" i n  my
dictionary gives me synonyms such as
"grave" -  perhaps a  portent o f  the
consequences of running the software!
Anyway brass tacks ﬁrst...
Business Pack N o  1  contains a
Cashbook system, a VAT ﬁle facility and a
Final Ac c ounts package. A  pr etty
comprehensive tr io o f  programs f o r
anyone who needs to keep accounts.
The pack comes complete with three
manuals/user guides. These are quite well
presented if a little light on content and
obviously devised b y  someone w h o
knows accountancy and computers a
great deal better than he does the users.
My accountant was quite impressed
with the facilities offered by the package,
but threw up his hands in horror when I
explained that it was designed for use by
small businesses with little or no expertise
in e it h e r  book - k eeping o r  d a t a
processing.
The review copy came on disk and
loaded painlessly enough, albeit slowly.
The tape-based version comes on three
separate cassettes and, presumably takes
long enough to LOAD to allow you to
pop down to the Dog & Diskdrive for
pint.
Finding a  spelling mistake in  the
opening paragraph o f  the operating
instruction notes  does  nothing t o
improve sagging conﬁdence, but plough
on regardless...
Each session begins by requesting you
to enter a date. Remember its accuracy is
vital t o  t he end result. The system
calculates the day of the week for you -
but take care!
Various prompts appear to assist you as
the session progresses. Obviously when
setting the system up from scratch there
are functions to carry out which won't be
required again until the start of a new
accounting year. The ﬁrst of these (and
potentially t h e  mos t dangerous) i s
prompted by "Initialise a new ﬁle?". A
"V" response requests conﬁrmation. At
this stage if you respond in the afﬁrmative
all account balances are cleared down -
not much fun if you are halfway through
your ﬁnancial year!
Cashbook entries are restricted to 25
transactions per batch, whilst analyses and
posting totals are only allowed to ﬁve
B u s i n e s s

F
separate accounts. If you are inputting a
lot of data it is wise to do some pre-
processing analysis of your own (i.e. sort
different types o f  transactions in t o
separate piles). G emini recommends
labelling each batch w ith a  header
containing details o f  t h e  entries -
imperative if you are to have any check
against t he various totals which will
eventually appear o n  y our  pr inted
reports.
Each of the three systems gives you a
menu. T h e  options  obviously vary
according to the particular service you
wish to access. Every conceivable alter-
native is included, but be sure you fully
understand the implications of the actions
you take particularly at the Journal entry
stage. Single entry journals are frowned
on by many accountants. To make sure
your's is happy be sure to keep plenty of
documentary back-up and remember
that there is no automatic entry to Control
or VAT memo accounts. Always err on the
side of caution.
There are enough report options
available to satisfy the most critical of
accountants and the output from the VAT
File system should be sufﬁcient to allow
you to complete your returns without any
problem.
The ususal dangers stalk the night §o
far as printers are concerned -  a general
problem. Don't switch off in the wrong
sequence or while a program is running.
Also, i f  y ou us e anything except a
Commodore printer (who doesn't?) you
will need to change the ASCII code for L
The relevant code should appear in your
printer handbook.
I would strongly recommend that you
purchase one of the ''Accounting Made
Easy" type books and have a good read
before using this package.
Until you have some grasp of  the
principles of double entry book-keeping
you will have untold problems. Gemini
advises t h a t  y o u  appr oac h y o u r
accountant prior to preparing proﬁt & loss
account and balance sheet sounds like a
good idea.
Two particular aspects of the package
are especially poor.
Firstly. paraphrasing the section of the
manual referring to data saving (I didn't
have the nerve to test it) " if  an error
occurs while you are saving data, type
GOTO 340 and try again" - how polished
and professional can you get! When I was
a gr een y oung programmer i f  I ' d
suggested to my project leader tht such a
statement should appear in the operator's
instructions, I would have been ﬂayed
alive with a wire brush.
Secondly i f  y ou accidentally h i t
RUN/STOP and RESTORE simultaneously
you automatically lose any data input
during the session.
I ﬁnd i t  difﬁcult t o  recommend
Combination Business Pack No 1 as there
are a  number of  better and cheaper
alternatives. G emini s till has  thr ee
important lessons t o  learn: D o  more
market research; when the "basic" ideas
work - convert them to a faster medium
such as machine code; employ good
systems analysts and a technical author.
Roll on No 2.
The best part of this particular issue is
the lovely lady who appears, smiling, on
the front cover. If only someone would
plug her C64 into the TV monitor for her.

Fed up with the speed of
I Basic?

Do you ﬁnd machine code
too complicated?

David Janda takes a look at I
Forth. It may solve your
1
problems.
FORTH IS A REMARKABLE LANGUAGE.
Not only is it the fastest language available
for home micros, but it is also very easy to
implement. Just about everything is
unique to this language, and many people
have used it for various applications.
To get an idea of Forth it is worth
looking at its history. Forth was developed
in the late 60s by one man called Charles H
Moore. Moor e was working a t  t he
National Radio Astronomy in Kitt Peak
Arizona, and was very frustrated with the
limitations o f  existing programming
languages.
Over the years. Moore developed a set
of programming tools which he could add
to when he pleased. H e decided t o
develop his tools into a control language,
and Forth was borne. Since then, there
have been numerous versions of the
language, but basically the choice is
between two Forth-77 and Fig-Forth.
The ﬁrst point to note about Forth is
that i t  does n't us e instructions o r
commands lik e  Basic. Neither is  i t
restricted t o  the number o f  facilities
it possesses when purchased. Instead,
Forth uses words. Every version comes
with a set of words that make up the
nucleus of the language.
The set of Forth words is stored in what
iscalled the dictionary. Just like Basic (but
more ﬂexible) a  Forth program can
consists of any number or combination of
words. VLIST is a Forth word. Its purpose is
to display the contents of the dictionary.
About the only other similarity between
Basic and Forth is that the latter has an
immediate mode where single commands
(sorry, words) can be executed. For larger
programs, an editor of some sort is used to
enter the source code.
The real reason why Forth stands head
and shoulders above the rest is its facility
to allow the user to add to it. The analogy
of someone opening a  d o o r  w i l l
demonstrate this point as well as show the
structure of a Forth program:
: GRASP GRASP HANDLE;
: TURN TURN HANDLE;
: OPEN PULL DOOR TOWARDS YOU;
: ENTER WALK THROUGH;
: DOOR GRASP TURN OPEN ENTER;
L a n g u a g e s
wGCO1110
F
In this example, there are four words,
grasp, turn, open and enter. Each new
word consists of a number of Forth words
which are terminated by the semi-colon.
Finally, a word called DOOR has been
deﬁned whic h consists o f  the other
four words. So, to perform the four words
I would simply enter DOOR.
The Stack
Forth has been described by many as the
high-level low-level language. The reason
for this is because Forth offers such high-
level control structures, yet requires the
user to maintain the stack. As a matter of
fact, the stack (and understanding how to
manipulate it) is probably the single most
important aspect o f  lear ning t h e
language.
The reason f o r  this  i s  because
practically every Forth word alters the
contents of the stack in some way. So it is
entirely up to the user to maintain the
stack, as there is no error checking, bound
checking or such like. Even though it is a
difﬁcult concept to handle at ﬁrst, stack
manipulation does have its rewards. In
Forth's case it produces programs that can
run at 80% of the speed of machine code
programs!
The stack itself is an area of memory
that is used as a temporary storage space
for numbers, data, and such like. I t
operates on a ﬁrst-in last-out basis, and
numbers can be added to it (pushed) or
removed (popped).
To put the number six on the stack in
Forth in immediate mode, the following is
done:
6 RETURN
This places six on the stack. Adding more
words is simple:
5 2 9 34 21 RETURN
Removing the numbers from the stack
can be done in a number of ways. By far
the simplest is to print them, and thi., is
done with the dot command',', which
removes one item from the stack and
displays it:
RETURN
would print:
21
34
9
2
5
6
The reason for the 'backwardsness' is
because the ﬁrst number placed on the
stack will be at the bottom, and hence the
last out.
The two methods of placing numbers
on the stack are in the immediate mode
(as above), or within a colon deﬁnition (a
program). Here, a word called ADD has

been deﬁned which adds two and seven
and prints the result:
: ADD 2 7 +
By simply entering ADD, the number nine
will be displayed. This is not a very good
way to add two numbers, so like Basic,
Forth can get the two numbers at run-
time:
: ADD + „
To add two numbers the following is
entered:
2 5 ADD
7 Ok
Notice the 'ok' which is the equivalent of
Basic's Ready prompt.
Reverse Polish Notation
Forth requires that numbers t o  b e
operated upon should be on the stack
prior to the operator. In other words, to
perform a mathematical function, it is
necessary to place the operand(s) before
the operator(s), and not mix them as we
humans do:
3 7 + is the equivalent of 3 + 7
We humans perform our calculations in
inﬁx notation, but Forth does it in postﬁx
notation, k now n as  reverse polis h
notation. H er e ar e s ome algerbraic
expressions in  inﬁx notation (normal)
with their postﬁx (Forth) equivalents:
Normal 
F
o
r
t
h
A+B-C 
A
 13 + C -
(+B)*C 
A
 B + C •
A*13-Cid+E A B * C D / - E +
It looks confusing at ﬁrst, but i t  is
surprising how easy it is to adapt.
The reason why postﬁx notation is
used is because computers ﬁnd it easier.
As a result, this also contributes to Forth's
speed.
Deﬁnitions
In Basic programs words are written, but
in Forth words are deﬁned. To inform the
micro that you are deﬁning a Forth word,
two Forth words ' : '  and ' ; '  are used
together with a name for that word:
: name forth-words;
Once the deﬁnition is entered, it is placed
within the dictionary and can be used just
like any other Forth word. Other Forth
words could use other deﬁnitions.
One of the great advantages that Forth
has over conventional procedure librarys
is that it is possible with many versions of
Forth to inform the package that you wish
to make your words part of the language
itself, Thus the next time you load Forth
your own deﬁned words will be part of
the language!
Finally, t h e  following Basic Forth
speed comparison demonstrates the
speed of Forth. The two programs are
identical in operation, and perform the
following:
Clear the text screen
Fill the colour map with the value 1, i.e.
white.
POKE to the screen display 26 complete
screenfuls.
The result is that a screenful of A's will be
displayed, then B's and so on. In BASIC
the test took 115 seconds to complete,
and in (Melbourne) Forth it took 10,23
seconds!

Reviews
It is very easy to implement Forth on a
micro-especially one like the 64. As a
result, there are at least seven implemen-
tations of the language available in the
UK.
As you can see from the list, the prices
of Forth packages differ. The features
offered also vary, and it is a good idea to
think about why you need the package. If,
for example, you wish t o  expand an
existing Forth, with a no-frills package,
then Fig-Forth could be what you are
looking for. On the other hand, White
Lightning fr om Oasis Software offers
many extensions. Another very good
version is Forth+ from Melbourne House.
With this package it is possible to produce
your own stand-alone programs with
ease.
Reviewed here are just four of the
packages currently available.
Fig-Forth
Romik Software
Tape only — i14.95
Although this version is one of the
cheapest, and offers no 'extras' at all, it is a
great package!
This is because of the way in which the
package has been implemented. Romik
Forth offers the user a true ﬁg-Forth
environment without any additions of any
kind. This has its advantages. First, it leaves
memory free that would otherwise be
used for extensions that the user may not
want in the ﬁrst place. And secondly, the

L a n g u a g e s
M E M
user can expand and customise the
package without having to worry about
workspace t h a t  m a y  b e  us ed b y
extensions.
This said, I  wouldn't recommend
Romik Forth for the absolute beginner.
Forth is unfriendly by nature, and Romik's
version, an exact implementation, reﬂects
this!
In use, the Romik Forth proved very
fast, even compared with other Forths.
The only slow aspect was the screen
output. I believe the authors have made a
CALL to the Basic/kernal ROMS and used
the same routines as Basic for screen
output. This is a pity, as it is possible to
optimise this routine., thus speeding it up.
Being an accurate implementation of
Fig-Forth, Romik Forth uses the same
editor as most Forths -  and a horrible
editor it is too!
When Forth was designed, no method
was speciﬁed for inputting source code, A
US member of the Forth Interest Group
(hence Fig) designed a crude but practical
line editor_ published in the user groups
newsletter, T h e  author suggested i t
should be used until someone designed a
better one. Unfortunately, everyone
(including the software houses) decided
to use it, and it's still being copied in Forth
implementations today!
Forth-64
Audiogenic
Cartridge only—L29.95
The standard editor used in Fig-Forth
is not the only 'off-putter' about the
language. SAVEing and LOADing to and
from a backup device is also complicated.
However, in  this case, there is a
justiﬁed reason, Forth was designed to use
dynamic storage meaning that memory is
treated as the backup device. The idea
behind this is to speed-up SAVEing and
LOADing. Only when you physically wish
to store or LOAD the data (at the start or
end of an editing session perhaps) would
you FLUSH the data to disk or tape. In
other words, dynamic store is a  go-
between the memory and tape/disk.
But managing the Ramdisk is a tricky
business in standard Forth. Audiogenics
Forth-64 gets round this problem by
offering easy to use Forth words for saving
and loading program screens. Not only
that, but the IEEE bus is fully supported, so
it is possible to control (with some ease)
any device bolted on the back of the 64.
Audiogenic's Forth is  supplied o n
cartridge thus SAVEing the user the
drudgery of LOADing from tape to disk.
Not only that, but being on cartridge frees
memory for more source screens which is
quite important.
Numerous words cover tape/disk I/O
and the IEEE bus, but there are no graphic
or sound extensions on the 64 version. But
it should be noted that the Vic-20 version
does have a word for changing the border
and screen colour as well as loading the
sound registers.
The editor used in this version is based
around the original, but makes good use
of the Commodore function/cursor keys.
What is a bit unusual is that the screen
used for direct mode is a Forth editing
screen. This means that when the end of
the screen is reached, it is necessary to
clear it before continuing. This is quite
awkward, and takes away some of the
immediacy of direct execution.
However, screen (as i n  editing)
management is very well organised with a
lot of the mundane tasks being done
automatically. A screen is selected, and
after the program source has been edited,
it can be loaded into main memory and
run_ To actually save or load a number of
source screens, a ﬁle is speciﬁed in the
SSAVE/SLOAD command, and Forth will
save or  load the required number of
blocks - simple!
White lightning
Oasis Software
Tape-119.95, disk-129.95
White Lightning is quite simply the best
value for money you can get. For the
price, y o u  n o t  o n ly  g e t  a  g o o d
implementation of Fig-Forth, but you also
get a graphics development system.
White Lightning is a fairly complex
package that can be used to develop
commercial programs. The package is
Forth based and includes a Fig-Forth
nucleus. Built around this is a graphics
development shell called IDEAL which
contains numerous sprite and sound
words which are used i n  the Forth
program. As well as this, it is possible to
access Basic within a White Lightning or
machine code. Once the program has
been developed and debugged, it  is
possible to save it in a stand alone version
that can be freely distributed.
Both dis k  and tape versions are
available, but the 'serious' programmer
should opt for the disk version as it is
necessary to save and load sprite data as
well as the Forth source if a graphics
program is being developed.
As mentioned it is possible to include
Basic statements within the Forth source.
This will mean that the program will not
run as fast as it would in Forth only, but it is
a great help when starting off with the
language.
FORTH+
Melbourne House
Tape—CW.95
Although only recently released, Forth+
has a long and interesting history, This Fig-
Forth bas ed package was  initially
developed f o r  t he Z X Spectrum b y
Abber soft.
Forth+ is supplied on cassette which is
recorded in the Pavlova format and takes
under three minutes to load. Disk users
will be relieved to hear that the package
can be transferred to disk with just two
simple commands, Once saved to disk,
the package takes 40 seconds to load and
uses the disk as the main backing device.
Supplied with the cassette is a (grotty)
36 page manual which covers the bare
essentials of the package. There are a
number of features within the package
that are not documented in the manual,
but I understand that Melbourne House
will be releasing a full length manual in
the near future.
Forth+ is based around Fig-Forth and
offers a number of interesting extensions.
First, the screen editor has been adapted
to make use of the CIA's editor. Source
code can be entered into any of the nine
screens in a free format, and an edit
session can be aborted if desired. One
point missing from the editor is the ability
to delete carriage returns. This may not
sound important, but when editing in a
free for mat (such as  t h e  example
program) this becomes essential.
Another interesting feature is  the
ability to produce stand-alone programs
with the package. After your masterpiece
is created, ZAP followed by the name of
the word will save a machine code ﬁle
which can be SYSed from Basic. However,
the code that is saved is as large as the
Forth itself (50 blocks), and probably
contains most of the package. There are
more elegant methods of achieving the
same thing.
Screen modes included within the
package are:
MCM Multi-colour mode
NCM Normal colour mode
ECBM Extended background c olour
mode
NBCM Normal background colour mode
HRG High-res mode
LRG Low-res mode
All the normal colour functions such as
border, i n k  a n d  bac k ground a r e
supported, together with plot and draw.
Sixteen sprite commands are included as
well as 16 sound commands.
In use, Forth+ proved to be excellent.
Even a  semi-fatal crash could be re-
covered from re-SYSing back into the
main c o d e .  T h e  p a k  cage i s  n o t
overwhelmed w it h features, b u t  t h e
facilities which it does have are perfectly
adequate.

Nick Hampshire brings you a I
I detailed look at the C-16
1
Operating System variables
I
ANYONE WISHING TO DO EXTENSIVE
machine code programming on the C-16
or Plus-4 will require two essential pieces
of information.
The ﬁrst, is a list of the operating
system variables, their  location and
function. This is essential if fatal interac-
tion with the system software is not to
occur. It is also important to know where
to place variables when using any of the
system subroutines.
The second essential piece of informa-
tion is a memory map. This contains the
entry points to the operating system and
Basic ROM routines. The use of such
routines within a program can save a
considerable amount o f  t im e  a n d
program space, an important considera-
tion with the C-16.
I have included both these pieces of
information in this article.
Unfortunately. Commodore has not
previously produced any of this data and
it has therefore been necessary to use the
experience gained w i t h  pr ev ious
Commodore machines to deduce the
location and function of both variables
and routines. All the locations discovered
have been thoroughly checked and I have
no reason to doubt that they are correct, I
would however be very interested to hear
from a n y  readers w it h  additional
information.
The operating system variables are, in
common with all Commodore machines,
stored in the bottom area of memory
extending from location $0000 up to the
bottom of the screen colour memory at
WOO, a total of 2K of memory. All the
important variable locations are shown in
Table 1. It should be noted that locations
$00 and $01 are an I/O port located on the
processor chip and cannot therefore be
used for variable storage.
A memory map of the ROM based
operating system and Basic routines is
shown in Table 2. Many of these routines
are usable to some degree, and some are
extremely valuable. Most of the routines
and variables ar e similar, o r  ev en
identical, in function, if not in location, to
those on the C64.
Readers wishing to gain an in depth
knowledge of the routines, functions and
operations are recommended to consult
one of the advanced books on the 64. The
64 Revealed series by Nick Hampshire,
published by  Collins is recommended,
especially Advanced Commodore 6 4
Basic Revealed.

This month A.P. and D.J.
Stephenson provide the key I
to Basic and devie into the
mysteries of keywords.
SOME READERS WH O  HAVE BEEN
following this series may have found the
last few articles a little tough. This month,
we thought it would be nice to pause for
breath and go over some of the lesser
used BASIC keywords in detail.
The Basic language, as implemented in
the C64, employs a variety of keywords
which are sufﬁcient to cope with most
situations. A good proportion of the total
are in constant use and have been treated
and used in earlier articles in this series.
For various reasons we have neglected
some of them altogether. A few others
have been us ed without adequate
description. Although all keywords are
deﬁned in the user manuals, alternative
treatments can often lead to a better
understanding.
The vocabulary o f  any language is
seldom utilised to the full. Indeed, in
everyday speech, we only use a fraction of
the total number of words we know. It is
the same with programmers. However
rich the Basic vocabulary, it is easy to get
into a  r ut by  sticking only t o  those
keywords which are easy to understand or
use. Unfortunately, t h e  most ardent
admirer of the CM or Vic 20 would be
forced t o  admit that the Basic voc-
abulary in these machines is, to say the
least, sparse. Because o f  this, i t  is
particularly important that we know how
to make efﬁcient use of every keyword.
Before dealing with them individually, it
pays to classify them into order.
Types of keyword
A keyword i s  any  combination o f
characters, chosen for their mnemonic
value, recognised by the interpreter as an
order to be carried out. They fall into one
of three classes, -statements or functions.
Commands are keywords which have
an overall effec t o n  t h e  complete
program. They are more often employed
outside a  program i n  direct mode.
However, they will also work within a
program under a  line number. The
following k ey w or ds  a r e  d i r e c t
commands: CONT, LIST, LOAD, NEW,
RUN, SAVE, VERIFY.
Statements a r e  keywords w hic h
perform some particular action within a
program. Most keywords are statements.
Functions are specialised statements
which perform a standardised operation
on a  variable. Functions c an b e
P r o g r a m m i n g

recognised by the brackets which enclose
the variables. The following complete list
of Commodore functions uses X or Y as
example numberic variables and AS for
string variables: ATN(X), CHRS(X),
COS(X), EXP(X), FRE(X), INT ( X) ,
LEFTS(AS,X), LEN( AS) , L O G ( X) ,
MIDS(ASX,Y), PEEK(X), PO S( X) ,
RIGHTS(ASX), RND(X), SIN(X), SPC(X),
SQR(X), STR(X), TAB(X), TAN(X), USR(X),
VAL(M).
TI and TIS are exceptional in that
Commodore classiﬁes them as functions
although they do not require brackets
round the variable. Numeric variables
used i n  functions ar e often called
arguments. The arguments in two of the
functions, POS and FRE, are dummies,
meaning that some number must be
entered to avoid triggering a syntax error
although it doesn't matter what number
you chose within the range 0 to 255.
The command RUN
RUN clears all variables when it starts a
program from the ﬁrst line number. It is
possible to start a program from lower
down the program by using RUN X, where
X is the starting line number. RUN X will
often lead to error conditions because
variables created under previous line
numbers are cleared from memory.
If you want to restart the program a
second time at some lower point, it is
better t o  use GOTO X  which leaves
previously created variables unharmed.
The main danger with using GOTO X is
triggering a 'REDIM'D ARRAY' error if a
DIM line is re-encountered.
The command CONT
A program comes to a halt under any one
of the following conditions:
(a) T he RUN/STOP k ey  has  been
pressed.
(b) The program has reached either a
STOP or END statement.
(c) T he program has reached the last line
number.
(d) The program has encountered a
standard error condition.
The program can always be restarted
from the beginning or, by typing RUN X,
started from line X. However, RUN or
RUN X  always clears variables fr om
memory which were created by the last
run. Only the program is retained.
The command CONT can provide a
powerful weapon for snifﬁng out bugs in
a program during the development stage.
It is  usually possible, providing t he
dev elopment h a s  p r o c e e d e d i n
accordance w ith guidelines o f  good
structure, t o  recognise certain critical
points in a program.
To check the value of variables at these
critical p o in t s ,  t empor ar y  STO P
instructions can be inserted. When the
program is RUN, it will halt at the ﬁrst
STOP and you can check the state of the
variables by printing out their value. If the
values are different to what you expected
there is little point in proceeding with the
rest until the reason for the discrepancy
has b e e n  f o u n d .  As s uming t h a t
everything is  O K, you can allow the
program t o  carry o n  w ith t he next
segment by again using CONT.
Unlike RUN, which always starts the
program afresh, CONT allows it to carry
on fr om where i t  was stopped and
preserves t h e  value o f  a ll variables
reached u p  t o  t h a t  point .  These
temporary STOPs act as 'break points' in
the program, enabling the status to be
investigated and faults remedied in  a
series of easy stages.
To take full advantage of break points,
the program should use ﬁxed, easy to use,
values so the results of calculations can
easily be checked manually at the end of
each one. Remember that CONT will not

work if the program has halted due to an
error condition. If you try it. the response
will be 'CAN'T CONTINUE.
The command NEW
As far as Basic is concerned, the command
NEW w ill clear t he entire memory,
including any  pre-existing program.
Although NEW is usually entered in direct
mode, you may include it within the
program under a line number, If you start
on a new program when the previous one
or its remnants are stil in memory, be
prepared for some unexpected results.
Switching OFF and ON again will clear
everying but entering NEW is  more
elegant.
Authorities disagree on the wisdom of
repeatedly switching the power on and
off mor e than absolutely necessary.
Repeated use of the main switch may
even reduce the life of some of the more
sensitive chips_
The command LIST
This is probably the most overworked
command in Basic. Although the default
listing is to the screen, a previously active
CMD statement can be used to output the
listing t o  a  printer or  other suitable
peripheral.
You may  inc lude LIST within a
program under a line number but, after
the listing, the program will always revert
to command mode and t he READY
message, Unless it is placed at the line
immediately pr ec eding t h e  E N D
 statement, it is difﬁcult to imagine what
purpose LIST can serve within a program
other than saving you the trouble of
entering LIST afterwards. But then you
don't always want a listing after every run!
The command SAVE
This command can only be used to save
programs. It saves on tape by default or on
disc by quoting device number eight after
the program name. The Commodore
method of saving on tape is slower than
some other machines, partly because two
copies are always saved so that read errors
on playback are easily pinpointed by
discrepancies between the versions.
If SAVE is used within a program under
a line number, the program is halted
while the tape or disk is being recorded.
On completion of the save operation, it
carries on with the rest of the program. In
this way, it is possible to save a program
and run it in one go, although you'll pro-
bably never need to do this.
Th L OAD command
When you load a program using LOAD as
a direct command, all variables are
cleared fr om memory including any
ontose -I

resident program which may be there. If
LOAD is used as a statement within a
program, although the existing program is
cleared, t h e  existing variables a r e
untouched and a  RUN automatically
follows. Used in  this way, the LOAD
command acts as a 'chain' command so
that several programs on tape or disk can
be chained together. This allows large
programs whic h w ould exceed t he
bounds of memory, to be entered in parts
small enough t o  b e  accommodated
within the memory space available. Each
s ubs equent p r o g r a m  ﬁn d s  a n
environment already  prepared b y
previous programs. The individual smaller
programs must be carefully designed to
ensure that, apart from their use o f
existing variables, they are self sufﬁcient.
For example, one program cannot
GOTO a line number of another because
it would n o t  b e  i n  t he computer's
memory. The program bytes are normally
loaded into a block of memory starting at
address 2048 (0800 hex) onwards.
The VERIFY command
Pessimists use VERIFY immediately after
they have saved a program on tape. It
takes a long while to save a large program
and just as long to verify it afterwards so it
is a precaution which many programmers
neglect to take. In any case, the most
likely reason for failing to LOAD is an
error during playback rather than during
record.
However. VERIFY does have one
additional advantage. Because it leaves
the t a p e several inc hes  after  t h e
program's end it is safe to receive another
program immediately without worrying
about overlap.
POKE and PEEK
These two statements are best considered
together because they occupy a grey area,
midway between Basic and the inner
workings of the machine. In traditional
Basic, the individual pigeon holes in
memory are of no consequence because
the interpreter takes care of all memory
assignments.
PEEK(X) enables us to have a look at
the byte currently occupying memory
address X .  T o  av oid a n  'ILLEGAL
QUANTITY' message, X must lie within
the range 0 to 65,535, (There is no memory
outside this range).
POKE X,Y allows us  t o  store the
number Y in address X. Since a memory
location can only hold one byte of data, Y
must be within the range 0 to 255, and it
must be a positive number.
To PEEK a  number can never be
harmful but an indiscriminate POKE can
turn sour. Poking the right number into
the wrong address or vice versa crash a
program. The results of a crash vary but it's
usually either a screenful of  dazzling
screen characters or a stoney indifference
to all keyboard activity. The crash will
almost certainly occur if  a number is
poked into one of the workspace areas
used by the operating system.
You should regard t he operating
system with respect as it's capable of
withdrawing all co-operation if crossed.
Providing care is taken in choosing
memory addresses, POKE can be used to:
Assign date bytes directly. For
example, if we want to store numbers
less than 256 in memory, it can be
done far more economically by using
POKE than by assigning the number
to a  Basic variable. I t  is not so
convenient o r ﬂexible as normal
assignments but worth bearing in
mind when a lot of small numbers
have to be manipulated.
(b) As  one of the elements in graphic
work.
(c) Passing parameters to machine code
surroutines called from within Basic.
(d) I n  spite of the warning regarding a
POKE into operating system areas,
there ar e a  number o f  special

P r o g r a m m i n g
locations which can be POKED in
order to modify certain effects.
To control colours. POKE 53282,8 will
set background colour to orange.
It is possible to operate on selected
bits of a memory byte by using the
AND or OR operators in conjunction
with POKE and PEEK. For example, bit
4 in location 53270 decides whether
the multi-colour character mode is
on (bit 4=1) or off (bit 4-'9). To ensure
the off condition, use
POKE 53270,PEEK(53270) AND 239
This may seem a triﬂe obscure unless you
are familiar with the bitwise features of
AND.
The AND statement
It should not be difﬁcult to understand
the meaning of AND and OR when used
in c onjunc tion w i t h  t h e  IF/THEN
structure. For example,
100 IF A- B AND C D  THEN PRINT XS
The syntax is almost self explanatory and
clearly means that both conditions must
be true. However, there are other, less
obvious, qualities lurking beneath the
surface which ar e known as bitwise
operations. Study the following series of
operations:
Assume this pattern 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
Now AND it with 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
The result is 
1
1
0
0
1
0
1
1
Note that the result is the same as the
original pattern except where the AND
pattern had a 0 in that position. The AND
pattern, known as a mask, is calculated
thus: Use '0' in the mask when you want
'O's in the result, otherwise use
let's try a practical example. Suppose a
certain memory  location holds  t h e
following bit pattern:
1 0 0 1
Let's also suppose that we wish to clear bit
4 or 0 without disturbing the others. (Bits
are numbered 0 to 7, from right to left so
bit 4 is the ﬁfth bit from the right). The
correct AND mask w ill b e  11101111.
Unfortunately, there is no provision in
CM Basic for entering bit patterns direct.
We have to use decimal so we must
convert the bit patterns in the AND mask
to decimal before it can be accepted. The
above example required an AND mask of
11101111.
Working laboriously in decimal, this
becomes 1+2+4+8+323+64+128 = 239. Pity
Commodore does n't pr ov ide h e x
numbers -  this would make AND mask
calculations dead easy.
We are now in a position to return to
the problem we left in the last section.
You will remember that the following line
was supposed to clear bit 4 in location
43270 to 0:
POKE 53270,PEEK(53270) AND 239
We are poking the same bit pattern back
into the location after we have ANDed it
with 239. We know that 239 decimal is
11101111 which is the correct AND mask
for clearing bit 4 in the original location.
To consolidate, conﬁrm that the following
apparent absurdities are in fact quite true:
247 AND 251 = 251, 7 AND 8 = O.
The OR statement
This, l i k e  t h e  A N D ,  has  bitwis e
connotations. As we have seen, ANDing is
used when we want to clear certain bits to
0 but ORing is used when we want to set
certain bits tol. The rule for the OR mask
is a follows: Use i n  the mask where bits
are to be o t h e r w i s e  use 'O's.
Suppose we start with 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
Then we OR it with 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
The result is 
1
1
0
1
1
0
1
1
Note that the result is the same as the
original except in the position where
there was a 1 in the OR mask.
Let's return to our previous example
once again but this time, assume we want
bit 4 in location 53270 to be a 1. The OR
mask must be 00010000, which in decimal
is 16. Our POKE line then becomes:
POKE 53270,(PEEK 53270) OR 16
To consolidate, conﬁrm the following: 7
OR 7 = 7, 5 OR 2 =7.
The NOT statement
This is the third member o f  the trio
capable o f  bjtwise operations. Before
describing its action, we must ﬁrst deﬁne a
few terms: To ﬂip, means to change a 1 to
0 or  vice versa. The bit complement
(logic al c o m p l e m e n t  o r  o n e ' s
complement) is the bit pattern formed by
ﬂipping a l l  t h e  bits . T h e  tw o's
complement is  the same as the bits
complement except that an extra 1 is
added. Example:
Starting with
Bit complement is
Two's complement is
10010
01101
01101001
The NOT statement forms the two's
complement of a bit pattern which can
lead t o  rather mysterious results. For
example, NOT 1 = 255. To see why, note
that 1 =00000001 so the two's complement
is 11111110 + 1 = 255.
The mystery clears up when we learn
that a negative number, as far as the
computer is concerned, is really the two's
complement for m o f  the equivalent
positive. When we NOT something, we
are really asking for the negative version.
All this information on the bitwise
operations of AND, OR and NOT is really
crossing the border between Basic and
machine code. The same thing can be said
regarding the next item.
The SYS command
It is possible to mix Basic with machine
code in  the one program. There are
several situations where such a mix may
be justiﬁed. The execution speed of Basic
is sufﬁcient f o r  some purposes b u t
intoler able f o r  other s . A n o t h e r
disadvantage of Basic is that memory is
not used economically. For example, in
Basic, the memory set aside for numbers is
ﬁxed, irrespective of their magnitude. it
takes just as many bytes to store the
number three as it does to store 3000.
Machine code programs can arrange for
memory storage t o  be mor e closely
tailored to magnitude.
However, mac hine c ode i s  n o t
everyone's idea of the good life so, as far
as possible, most of the program may
continue to be written in the tranquil
environment o f  Basic, with only  t he
occasional leap into and out of machine
code. Figure 13.1 shows how such leaps
can be performed using the keyword SYS.
Note from the ﬁgure that we can only
jump to a machine code subroutine if we
happen to know where it is located in the
memory map. in other words, we must
know the starting address. I f  you've
written the machine code there's no
problem but you may want to use some of
the ready made versions already residing
in the ROM. These are free, providing you
ﬁnd out the starting address by consulting
the Programmer's Reference Guide or
employing some crafty detective work.
Remember you can always PEEK locations
in ROM.
There is one obstacle that can arise in
the use of SYS. Many subroutines only
work if information is provided. To quote
a simple example, a subroutine to ﬁnd the
square of a number obviously can't work
unless it is supplied with the number to be
squared. When such a  subroutine is
written, it will assume the number to be
already residing in a particular memory
location. The address will form part of the
accompanying documentation.
Therefore, before w e call o n  the
subroutine by means of SYS, we must
poke this information in the required
address. Thus a typical call might look like
this:
100 POKE 34520,16
110 SYS 34500
The data location is 34520 and the number
16 has been poked into it. The subroutine
is assumed to start at address 34500.
The machine code subroutine must end
with RTS (Return f r o m Subroutine)
otherwise control will not come back to
Basic.

Our resident expert
answers your
programming queries.
Most computers with function
keys enable you to redeﬁne the
keys in Basic. I have been trying
to do this for some time on my
C64 b u t  with o u t t o o  mu ch
success. Could you possibly tell
me how this could be done?
Norman Doyle
Cleveland
Unfortunately, as you have no
doubt found out, there is no
simple way to deﬁne the CM.
Most Basic extension packages
(see our August and September
issues) have a command which
allows you to program keys by
means of a new keyword. It is
however quite simple to use
these keys i n  yo u r o w n
programs without having to go
to any expense. Take a look at
the following short program
10 GET AS
20 IF A$ CHR$(133) THEN 10
30 IF A$ CHR$(140) THEN 10
40 A=(ASC(A$)-132*2-1:1E A '8
THEN AA-7
50 PRINT "FUNCTION KEY
";A;" IS PRESSED"
60 GOTO 10
This short routine will scan for
all eight function keys. By
adding the following line it is
also possible t o  ad d  four
function keys b y using the
Commodore key as an extra
shift key.
45 I F  PEEK (653)=2 THEN
A=A/2+8
Reading the function keys in
this manner is extremely simple
as each of the keys returns a
unique number to the GET
instruction in line 10.
Below is a program which
will allow you to actually store
strings of characters on each
key, the strings can either be
keywords or strings of your
own choosing.
Sixteen re-deﬁnable keys
are catered for and these are
obtained by pressing F1,F3,E5
and F7 with no shift, the Com-
modore key o r the control
key.
The whole program is based
on interrupts and can b e
switched on by:
SYS 49152
and off by:
SYS 49155
When the program is ﬁrst
loaded the keys are set to:
El SYS 49158
F2 SYS 49155
F3 RUN + RETURN
F4 POKE
E5 LIST
F6 PEEK(
F7 LIST + RETURN
F8 ?PEEK(
F9 M i n
F10 LEFT(
Ell RIGHTS(
E12 LEN(
El3 53248
F14 54272
F15 LOAD
116 SAVE
The function of each key
can b e  changed b y either
pressing F1 or typing SYS 49158
followed b y  t h e  t ext  i n
quotation marks, a comma and
then the key number. The text
stored on each key can be no
more than 10 characters and
the key number no greater
than 16. Fl and F2 cannot be
changed since they hold the
important SYS calls.
Here are a few examples:
SYS 49158 "P[s 0]53281,0",7
This will POKE 53281 with O.
SYS 49158 "LOAD"+CHR$(34)-+
"S"+CHR$(34)+"8
This will type LOAD "$",8 and
execute a return.
If you wish to add a RETURN
onto the end of any function
you must put a left hand arrow
as the last character in the text
when deﬁning the function.

FRANKIE COMES TO CRICKLEWOOD,
or anywhere els e f o r  that matter,
packaged in a smart box with a free live
recording of the band performing their
hit song Relax so you can boogie while
you plan your next move in the game.
As programs go, this has a lot to offer
and the inclusion of games within games
reminds me slightly of Terminal's Lazy
Jones but this has all the whistles and bells
that Jones lacks. It is streets ahead of any
opposition and that's not just because it's
set amongst the houses of Mundanesville.
The idea is to reach the title screen, a
typically contrary Hankie-style idea, to do
this you have to visit all the houses in
every street of Mundanesville to ﬁnd
objects which will help you to complete
the mini games. Really the things people
keep in their draws! Old ﬁsh, pleasure
pills, pistols and video cassettes.
Talking of videos, these play a vital part
in the story. Place a cassette in a handy
video machine and it reveals a portion of
one of the mini games. You are then free
to enter the screen. .but I'm giving away
the plot.
A SKULL, SCORPIONS AND SPIDERS, A
ghostly graveyard and gorillas, knights in
castles and chests are some of the things
you will encounter in the Lands of Havoc.
Sador (the player), a reptile in the
shape of a man, has come to save the land
of Haven from the Dark Lords. His ﬁrst
quest is to seek the Book of Change
hidden deep in the village. The Book will
reveal the whereabouts o f  the chest
which contains directions to the Dark
Lords.
Sador will have to ﬁght and kill to
collect the means to protect himself, such
as a Talisman from the Mystics and a key
from the Garden, before he can enter the
Skull in the Wild Wood and destroy the
Dark Lords. If he strays into the Wild
Wood too soon he will become paralysed

Why do you have to enter the mini
games? What is the ﬁendish purpose
behind it all? Before you can enter the
ﬁnal screen you must complete your
personality. For the purpose of the game,
personality is composed of four facets:
pleasure, war, love and faith. Each facet is
represented by a symbol at the right hand
side of the superb 3D graphic screen and
each pleasure pill looks like the symbol to
which it relates. As the game progresses
you gain points in one or more of the
- end of game! Only after many hours of
play will the ﬁnal secrets of the Dark Lords
be revealed.
This maze type game is of the Sabre
Wulf variety. Nine cards map out the
maze when laid in sequence (2000 com-
binations). Half the fun is ﬁnding the aim
of the game add the other half re-
arranging t h e  cards i n  t h e  correct
sequence at the beginning of each game
(this happens very often until y o u
become experienced). The bottom right-
hand corner of the screen has the initials
of each card in the pattern they are set out
on the table. The redeﬁned character-set
makes them almost indecipherable and
the pattern is unclear as two of the cards
have the same initial.
Once defeated the player is informed
of his  percentage through the game
before being included in the Hall of Fame
(if he's lucky). The game loads in under
three minutes and has  high quality
graphics. There are eight levels of play,
each with an easier/difﬁcult option. The
music is  excrutiating and should b e
turned off immediately using the F3 key.
Here's your chance to get
some help from the experts
on how to spend your hard
earned pocket money.
screens for successful results and lose
points for failure in the mini games. This is
shown by growing and shrinking columns
above the relevant symbols. Points are
also awarded for various ﬁnds in the
houses. Occasionally, Frankie w i l l
interrupt with a comment which tells you
how your personality is developing as a
percentage just to cheer you along.
One of the rooms has a locked door
which is the entrance to the Corridors of
Power forming the Pleasure Dome. This is
where the mini games are located and
once y ou hav e unlocked t he door,
mapped the maze and fully developed
your personality the ﬁnal door will be
found here, but be careful the maze of
corridors is full of traps for the unwary.
In one of the houses there has been a
murder and once you have discovered
the body you are given clues to the
murderer's identity and you must not re-
enter that room until you have discovered
who the felon is. Each time you play the
game you will ﬁnd a different corpse and a
new killer.
I will not reveal the nature of the mini
games except to say that there are more
than 10. Ocean claims that there are 60
problems to solve in all and I believe
it. After hours of  searching and bat-
tling the best rating I achieved was 60%

should rank alongside the best C64 titles

HERE WE HAVE A SUITE OF FOUR PRO-
grams intended to give four to eight year
olds practice in distinguishing left, right,
up and down - a concept young children
ﬁnd difﬁcult. A n  element o f  route-
planning is also involved. The popular Mr
Men ar e used throughout and t h e
graphics, though s imple, ar e v er y
effective.
In Mr Tickle's Jigsaw Puzzle the U,D,L
and R keys (or the function keys) are used
to move doorways in the sides of a box
until they are lined up with pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle which stand outside. When
the alignment is correct the pieces move
in and build up a picture of Mr Tickle. The
jigsaw pieces are very small and do not
line up centrally with the doorways, so the
printing, Special commands are accessed
logically and easily using the CTRL key,
and most of them work very well, A slight
problem is that only whole lines of text
can be highlighted and moved, but I did
not ﬁnd this a major drawback, Tabs,also,
were a bit quirky at times.
Part of the machine's memory is set
aside as a "clipboard" or workpage, so
that chunks of text can be merged at will,
and there is  an option f or  printing
globally, so that whole documents may be
linked together in  sequence. A  wide
range of printing options is provided,
including centring and justiﬁcation.
These are accessed through the familiar
"format lines". There are also built-in
commands f or  underlining and italic
printing, available on Epson and similar
printers, though these are misprinted in
the manual.
The database is about the easiest to use
that I have seen though it is somewhat
limited. The program will not sort records
into alphabetical or numerical order. Nor
is it possible to scan through an entire ﬁle,
unless you set aside one o f  the 17
permitted ﬁelds as a dummy, used just to
game becomes harder than need be.
Children whom I asked to try it soon
found it tedious.
Mr Tickle and Mr  Grumpy on the
other hand, is excellent and quite the best
of the four games. Mr Grumpy is inside
the box with the same four doorways and
Mr Tickle's extending arm needs to reach
in t o tickle him. To achieve this, the
doorways can be moved as before, then
Mr Tickle must be programmed with a
sequence of instructions for moving his
arm along the required route. On later
levels, chairs appear in the doorways,
adding to the challenge. If preferred, the
directions for movement can be given
individually.
In Mr Lazy the idea of branching to left
or right is introduced as you guide a worm
up a tree to a red apple. If you are
successful he will drop the apple into the
mouth of Mr Lazy, who is sleeping below.
Another good game.
Mr M e n  versus M r  Tickle is  the
poorest of the games in that it is almost
impossible to lose I You control four Mr
Men, moving on a draughts board, who
try to trap Mr Tickle. It could be quite
good, b u t  unfortunately M r  Tickle's
movements are often rather stupid and he
rarely wins.

good, though nothing special. I t  is

access the records. Nevertheless, as a
simple address book or similar database it
is very good and has a  particularly
versatile procedure for print formatting.
The spreadsheet, or ﬁnancial planning
section o f  the program is  excellent,
although it is here that the novice would
ﬁnd most difﬁculty i n  following the
manual. A  rather involved system o f
relative addressing is used when entering
formulae, and the explanation given is
very thin indeed,
All the sections of the package are fully

wordprocessor documents. I f  you run
into difﬁculty, a "help" key is provided,
which puts an explanatory window on the
screen. The information given, however,
usually just duplicates the inadequate text
of the manual.
With proper documentation, tutorial
and sample ﬁles this package would
warrant ﬁve stars. As it stands, it is still very
good., especially when you consider that it
is only  a  quarter o f  t h e  pric e o f

I HAD TO BORROW TWO CASSETTE
players before I ﬁnally managed to get this
game to load -  and then only from one
side! It's a slow loader (very) so there
doesn't seem to be any real reason for
this, However, I succeeded in the end, so
here goes!
You are deep in the heart of a system
of caves, from which y ou are trying
desperately to escape before your energy
is exhausted, The caves are infested with
bug-eyed monsters, bottomless lakes and
pits ﬁlled with what look like sharpened
stakes, contact with which spells instant
death! Fortunately you have nine lives,
like a cat, but I guarantee that you will
need every one of them.
To escape you will need to run, jump,
shin up ropes and shoot aliens- in fact it is
a fairly standard platform game, with a
scrolling screen display. The controls are
rather unusual, as you jump only after
you release the ﬁre button -  the height
varies according to the length of time you
held the button down. Shooting presents
no problems, as you ﬁre automatically in
whichever direction you are moving.
There are eight levels, with six caves in
each level, and getting through is really
challenging!
The graphics are excellent, though the
colours are rather muted, Some of the
aliens are especially good and move very
smoothly, almost like sprites. The title
page displays the three highest scores and
gives the option of restarting at the level
reached i n  the previous
accompanied by a rendering of The Star-
Spangled Banner in very erratic tempo.
Generally, the sound effects are poor - I
ended up turning the volume right down.
The game is quite good, but doesn't
really shine in any way, and I quickly tired
of it.

I'M A "BLAST THE GRIEF OUT OF ANY-
thing that moves" addict, so when I was
asked to review this adventure I thought
the intergalactic battle was over. So you
can imagine that I  loaded Mordon's
Quest with some trepidation, especially as
there wasn't even the slightest hint of any
graphics. I was in for a more than pleasant
surprise.
Mordon's Q ues t, b y  Melbourne
House, has been written by Peter (don't
you dare give my  phone number to
anyone) Morland, who also wrote Classic
Adventure.
It is said by the publishers' to be "an
extremely complex text adventure". They
were dead right about it being text but
they were deﬁnitely being underhand by
using the word "complex". I could think
up much more graphic superlatives to
describe its twists, turns and generally
dastardly tricks and absolutely mind-
bending puzzles. As I said, I could be
much more graphic in my description, but
this is supposed to be a family show!
Like any other text game the computer
acts as your eyes, ears and hands and is
only limited by the 500 words which it
understands; which, when you come to
think about i t ,  is  a n  awfully large
vocabulary. However, this  has been
accomplished by using that well known
"text compression" system allowing the
author to be very descriptive as you travel
through the 150 locations which have
been cleverly mapped to look like.. .but
that would be telling. Typing in 'help' will
point you in the right direction.
The game starts with you, as the
possible answer t o  any  Jack-the-lad
wizard's prayer, falling out of bed. Your
quest is to save the universe, as if you
hadn't guessed already.
On y our  journey y ou w ill c ome

who are heavily into magic mushrooms,
and loin cloth clad, human apes, with a

young and foolish Bostafer who is bent on
immortality at the expense of our total

 destruction.
you could be forgiven for believing that
you're actually there. I kid you not, this

D.E.
SOFTWARE THAT GIVES A  LIMITED
amount of  French lessons is the latest
offering from Activision. Based on the
Tour de France bicycle race the game
boasts some interesting and well planned
graphics. I was particularly impressed with
the bicycle movements which allow pixel
to pixel movement in any direction as the
route demands, W i t h  eac h s light
movement the sprite appears to change
shape accordingly giving an extremely
convincing 3D effect, probably the best I
have seen.
The game is complex to load because
you are given the choice of completing
the full Tour or selecting individual stages
which are then loaded from data sections
on the tape. This means that once you
have completed your chosen selection a
new game involves reloading the whole
program again. Not knowing how the
program was written I do not understand
why it is not possible to be able to rewind
the data section of the tape and reload a
new selection. No doubt there is a reason
but I  would have preferred it  to be
otherwise.
Another little quibble relates to the
fact that although t he race c an b e
controlled by the keyboard, the selection
of bicycle and country of the player must
be made with a joystick. Surely a small
amount o f  extra thought could have
released the user from the need to use the
joystick at all. I found that the response
from the keyboard was better than that
from the joystick and that the control of
the bicycle was easier.
Having got those gripes off my chest I
shall continue with my description of the
game. Up to six players can enter the race
but each must complete a section in turn.
Why t h e  programmer bothered t o
include the option for a practice mode I
do not understand because once practice

without any prior knowledge o f  the
language and who knows you may learn a
thing or two.
At the beginning of each etape (stage)
a screen is given which allows you to
select keyboard or joystick operation and
it also permits you to select another bike.
Each bike has different qualities but it is
up to the user to ﬁnd out what these are.
This means that if you want to change
your mode of control or try a new vehicle
in mid-race you can do so at the next rest

how the multi-player game could become

THIS GAME HAS AN UNUSUAL STORY-
line in that you start off dead! You play the
part o f  Kelok  -  n o t  t h e  cornﬂake
manufacturer but the well-known warrior
of the Eastern Region. No, you don't work
for Anglia Television either!
You have been killed by Xorphas, a
warlock of the worst kind, and he has
stolen your heart away. "Have a heart!"
you said, and he just took it, doubtless to
use in some of his unnatural practices!
So you are doomed - doomed to wander
forever in the Abyss of Death, doomed to
the torment o f  death without peace.
Somewhere in the succession of eerie
caverns lies your lost heart, which you
must regain if you are ever to ﬁnd rest.
To help you in your quest, you are
armed with the famous Sword of Destiny.
A strange sword, this, as it hurls bones at
people -  o r  per haps  t h e y  a r e
thunderbolts. You use it to despatch the
vile guardians of death, an assorted bunch
of bats, ghosts and grinning skulls, and by
sending them packing you replenish your
energy a  little. Collect any  ﬂashing
artefacts and you open up further cave
sections, but do watch your energy, or
astral power level. You only have one life,
or rather death, to play with.
To sum up, you must run about and
jump fr om level t o  level, collecting
anything which ﬂashes and bumping off
ghosties, ghoulies and things that go
bump in the night, trying to ﬁnd your
poor bruised heart. The task isn't easy - it
took me several attempts before I even
qualiﬁed for the high-score table - but at
least you get some help from the hot-air
ﬂues, which enable y ou t o  leap t o
amazing heights!

from Gremlin Graphics - it's well worth
buying.

also a 'ﬁne tune' which allows you to
make last minute adjustments t o  the
strength and direction of the shot as your
golfer swings his club through the air.
You can then watch the ball ﬂy across
the screen and land on the fairway, or the
rough, o r  the bunker, o r  the water
hazards or even go out of bounds! The
usual everyday frustrations o f  t h e

the consolation that if you miss a two foot

DORKS, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, COME
from Dorking, but this one is far from the
heart of rural Surrey. His spaceship has
crashed on the planet of the Zobwats and
is scattered to the four winds, or at least to
the 25 mazes. "What is  a  Zobwat?"
I hear you ask. Elementary, my dear
Watson -  it  is  nothing more than a
Tawboz spelt backwards, but it can take
many forms, all of them nasty!
If you are wondering whatever I am
dorking about, let me explain. The aim of
the game is to collect a piece of spaceship
from each o f  the 25 chambers, then
reassemble them. T o  c ollec t these
components, all you need to do is to kill a
minimum of 10 Zobwats in each chamber.
The method of killing is easy. You drop a
bomb when they are close to you, then
you dork out of the way pretty sharpish!
The trouble with Zobwats is that they tend
to surround you in a corner, so you can't
get away after dropping a bomb. You have
four lives, however, so it isn't as bad as it
sounds. Some of the chambers are rather
cramped, m a k in g  i t  d if ﬁc u lt  t o

work out a technique for dealing with
each one.
Gremlin Graphics has  produced
some really excellent games for the C16
and Plus/4, and this is no exception.
Complete with high score table, joystick
or keyboard options, sound on or off, it is
a thoroughly professional piec e o f
programming. The graphics are colourful
and varied, and the sound effects are just
right.
The game i s  entertaining, and
challenging enough to maintain interest,
One word of advice - don't rush around
too much, but be patient and you can
achieve a very high score.
P.R.B.
cap players alike will relish the chance of
pitting their  wits  against a n  open
championship course. Even those of you
with n o  golﬁng experience should
quickly learn enough of the rudiments of
the game to play many enjoyable hours
trying to hit a small white ball into a small
white hole. This game is easy to learn but,
like real golf, it's difﬁcult to master. Holes
in one, eagles, birdies and pars are all
attainable but beware -  bogey's abound
in plentiful supply for the unwary.

Thing on a Spring

C64 + joystick
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE WE HAVE SEEN
any CM games from the stable of such
classic games as Monty Mole and Potty
Pigeon. However, Gremlin Graphics has
now returned with vengeance with what
is sure to be its latest chart topper - Thing
on a Spring.
As ever your mission is to rid the World
of some evil that has been unleashed
upon it. This time, however, it's not the
usual mad scientist or the Warsaw pact
that you're out to stop, it's an evil goblin
who is trying to rid the world of all its
treasures.
This time you don't play the role of a
tank commander or a superhero instead
you ﬁnd yourself quite simply as a Thing
on a Spring_
Platform games have certainly become
as common as Space Invaders, and it's
quite a surprise that Gremlin Graphics has
released yet another one onto the market.
Don't worry though, this isn't your run of
the mill platform game it's far superior to
most that have been launched recently.
Controlling Thing is  n o  easy task,
being a spring he tends to bounce around
quite a lot, if you're not careful you'll ﬁnd
him bouncing right into the clutches of
some evil monster who will reduce the
amount of oil on his spring. Too little oil
and guess what happens!
Hidden around the numerous rooms
in the Goblin's lair are ﬁve switches. Thing
needs to collect these before he can get
around all of the complex. Finding the
switches and ﬁnding out what they do
turns what could have been a normal
platform game into a  real arcade
adventure. It took me an hour to get out
of the ﬁrst room.
Thing on a Spring has some superb 
E
graphics and sound. Gremlin's claim that
Thing is 'cute and everso lovable' isn't that
far from the truth.
Rush out and buy it, you'll love it!S.C.

INHIRILINURD HAS A  PASSION FOR
collecting things. TV sets, grapes, toy
yachts or candelabra have such a strong
pull on his acquisitive nature that he will
risk life and limb to reach them.
Our hero lives in a dangerous world of
mazes which are guarded by snakes and
small round creatures with antennae.
Whirlinurd must collect as many objects
as possible avoiding contact with these
creatures and can ﬂy by using a rotor
blade ﬁtted to his head.
The ﬁrst few mazes are fairly straight
forward but the complexity increases as
you mov e f r o m screen t o  screen.
Eventually, you reach mazes in which you
must ﬁnd keys which ﬁt in locks of the
same colour. Placing a key in a lock opens
up another part o f  the maze which
contains one of the sought after objects
but also releases another creature to add
to your problems.
found this game quite challenging to
play but I  can't say that it was more
exciting than the host of other games in
the same vein. Like most of these games,
once you work out a pattern to follow
each maze can be traversed without a
great deal of difﬁculty. One good feature
is the ability to start at a higher level,
preventing the need to start from the
beginning every time.

ALLITERATIONS ARTFUL AID  ASSISTS
another attempt at aggregating akkers for
US Gold. Unfortunately, I don't think that
it will, not because it is a bad game but
because it offers nothing more than the
majority of ladders and platform games
currently available.
After a rather crude (by US Gold
standards) loading sequence the title
screen gives way to a view outside the
brewery where we ﬁnd our pot-bellied
SOMETIMES PROGRAMMERS CAN GO
overboard with special effects at the
expense of what could otherwise be a
superb game. A View to a Kill is one such
example.
Based closely on the plot of the ﬁlm,
the game is split into three parts, or four if
you c ount the title sequence which
merely computerises the familiar opening
sequence to all the Bond movies.
The ﬁrst scene picks up the story
where Bond is chasing the hang-gliding
villainess May Day. He has requisitioned a
taxi for this purpose and he must avoid
collisions with the buildings and the mad
motorists of Paris if he is to intercept May
when she touches down. To help, you are
faced with a rather complex screen which
shows a 3D view from the front window of
the car, a bird's eye view of Paris and a
gauge which tells you how far away May
is.
Although this is an excellent piece of
programming, I  would prefer a larger
view of Paris so that I could see instantly
where the hang glider is, Control of the
car whilst looking at all the other displays
is virtually impossible and you can't tell if
the street you are on is a cul-de-sac or if
you will end up driving yourself in Seine.
The nex t t w o  parts ar e ac tion
adventure games. The ﬁrst is set in the San
Francisco City Hall and you must rescue
the beautiful Stacey from the lift shaft
where arch-villain Max Zarin has trapped
you both after setting ﬁre to the building.
As the ﬁre creeps from room to room you
hero standing outside three doors. The
doors are marked Control, Production
and Shipping but as the game is similar no
matter which door you enter we shan't
linger on the signiﬁcance of these labels.
On entering one of the rooms you are
faced with a scene of part of the brewing
factory. There are doors on most of the
levels and one or two of the ﬂoors have
exit signs. Somewhere on the screen is a
key which unlocks the way to another
room and it is Bert's aim to grab the key
and move on.
Ventilation ducts blast air upwards and
if Bert stands on one of these he is carried
by the draft up on to the next ﬂoor. To
escape from some of the rooms the air
blast provides the only pathway to the
exit.
Occasionally one of the doors opens
must t r y  t o  obtain t h e  necessary
equipment not only to rescue Stacey but
able to use to escape from the building.
Using a  'duck shoot' menu y ou can
examine or use the objects which you
ﬁnd, command Stacey to follow or wait
behind and if you go desperately wrong
you can quit and start again.
The ﬁnal part is set in the mine in
which Zorin has placed the device which
will soon explode to make sure that the
occupants of Silicon Valley have had their
chips. Before you can defuse the bomb
you must search the mine for suitable gear
so that May Day can help winch you down
to do your work. This section is very
similar to the previous one, though in my
opinion it is the better of the two.
Each section of the game relies on
success at the previous section to enhance
your chance of being able to complete it.
For example, a geiger counter is hidden in
the City Hall which will help to locate the
bomb in the mine. This gives a theme by
which the three parts hang together as a
whole but it also detracts from the full
enjoyment of the individual parts.
My advice is to spend your money on
Bond but make sure that it is a Premium
Bond, you have more chance of success
and it may prove more rewarding.
J.G.
and a mean little character appears. He
walks up and down like a security guard
and will ﬁre the odd pot shot at Bert who
must dodge or die, Bert is also armed and
he can retaliate with a well-aimed shot
which will kill his opponent who then
disappears only to re-appear from behind
another door.
Some of the rooms are linked and the
only possible means of escape is to enter
the other room and face its perils only to
reappear on the desired level o f  the
original room to make his escape.
For my money. this is not as good as
the Bounty Bob games which US Gold
markets but as you go from room to room
the challenges increase in number and
variety and I found that it at least held m‘
interest.

This month Runecaster delves
into the secrets of Exodus:
Ultima III and encounters
elves, dwarves hobbits and
fuzzies!
Oh boy.. .oh boy!
ARE YOU A FRUSTRATED BARBARIAN
with your sword rusting on the wall?
Perhaps, a mace bearing cleric resting
between quests. Did you want to play
Dungeons and Dragons.. but couldn't
ﬁnd anybody else to join you at the right
time or place - and, for the hours (days!)
necessary for a worthwhile quest?
Get down that sword, oil the hiking
boots, get in a goodly store of victuals and
prepare for an extended period away
from the daily rat-race.
If you haven't got a C64 complete with
disk drive, now is the time to invest.. .and,
while you're at it, get a copy of Exodus:
Ultima I l l  by Origin Systems Inc.,
distributed in the UK by US Gold. This is
such an interesting ﬁnd that for the ﬁrst
time I shall be looking at only this one
subject. I  hope you like role playing
games!
In the Past
Some four years ago there was The Valley,
where you could choose your character
type (ﬁghter, cleric, wizard etc.) and set
off adventuring — battling a host of
monsters, ﬁnding treasure and casting the
odd spell. At the time it was quite a hit but
with limited graphics and designed for the
161( PET, it now looks a little pale!
There have been several attempts to
bring genuine 'free ﬂowing 'role playing
games to the C64, notably perhaps the
Dungeonquest series which included The
Temple o f  Aphsai. They have been
partially successful but have nearly all
been for single adventurers (no teams) or
have not really had that spark of
'alternative reality' that makes for total
player involvement.
Presently Available
Other computers, especially in America,
have had good role playing games written
for them. Wizardry for the Apple is one
that immediately springs to mind. Now, at
long last C64 users in the UK have their
turn!
Ultima III could well prove to be a
game which adventurers will spend many
thousands of hours playing. Sadly, it is disk
based only, with no real hope of a cassette
version ever appearing.
The operating system f or  the
adventure comes on one side of the disk,
with a program for creating a separate
'scenario disk' on the other side. Before
you can venture forth you must create this
separate scenario disk.
This creation routine takes some
time (about 12 minutes!). When
cheating to start with even though you
will be fretting to get going. Make up two
scenario disks! Make sure you format the
disks with exactly the same 'disk name'
and I.D.
We are now almost ready to start! Load
the operating system.. .up come the main
titles.. press the SPACE Bar...whirr,
whirr: not long to wait now.. .insert your
scenario disk when told to.. .we're there!
The initial screen displays a moving
vignette of a team travelling around in
Sosaria ﬁghting monsters and generally
complete you have to switch off the
computer (and disk drive) and reload
the operating system before you can
play. The sole difference in 'playing'
and 'creating', is whether you press the
SPACE bar or 'C', once the main titles
appear. Don't make a mistake, as even
loading the operating system takes
several minutes!

This isn't a game to be played lightly. it
takes time to set up and even more time to.
get over the initial learning period - what
keys do what, which is the best way to'
make up your team of adventurers (you
can control up to four in a party).
For this reason I could suggest a little

enjoying themselves. You could watch
this for longer. ,but what about your own
team?
Pressing SPACE gives you three
options: Return to the moving vignette;
organize a party; journey onward. You
cannot choose the third without ﬁrst
creating your characters and forming a
party so, your initial choice is determined
for you.
Again a menu, giving the option to
examine the main characteristics of
existing characters, creating new
characters, forming or dispersing a party,
removing (terminating) characters and
ﬁnally returning to the previous menu.
Vital Statistics
Initially you must create a selection of
characters -  at least four. You can go
adventuring with less than four but this is
not recommended, especially to begin
with!
You may have up to 20 characters 'in
store' and in creating each one, you must
deﬁne their roster number (1-20), name,
sex, race (human, elf, dwarf, bobbit or
fuzzy). Each racial type has different
potential abilities - dwarves are strong,
elves are dexterous etc. You must bear
this in mind - you wouldn't want a clumsy
thief would you!
Next, you have t o choose the
character type - barbarian, thief, wizard,
ranger etc. There are 11 possibilities given
and this choice must be made carefully.
Not only do you want a balanced Party
that can deal with whatever it meets along
the way but you must also allocate points
(up to a total of 50) to your character's
strength, dexterity, intelligence and
wisdom. This, together imith race and
type, will modify a character's capabilities.
The permutations possible are quite
enormous but after a few forays into the
unknown you will start to get some idea of
a viable Party's requirements. You will
probably 'zero in' on a toughie of some
sort - preferably one that can also use a
little magic.
Then you'll need someone who can
use prayers (cleric, druid etc), if only
because they can heal injured friends and
also magically examine treasure chests for
traps. Thieves seem to be very useful -
personally I like the female, elven variety!
Then perhaps the pure wizard type or
even your original red blooded barbarian.
Study the table that gives the
characteristics for each profession, this
will tell you what weapons, armour and
spell type each may use and what
compromise is made (if any) for the use of
C
64 magic.
Make notes of  each character's
attributes as you type them in. This is quite
important, because once created but
before setting forth, you cannot check
such attribute points as strength,
dexterity, intelligence and wisdom.
You may always call up a character's
status during play but once the adventure
proper has started you cannot return to
the creation stage. When you have
created sufﬁcient characters then 'Form a
Party', entering the four characters you
have chosen, then return to the main
menu and Journey Onward.
Cheat!
If you want to 'cheat a little' press 'Q',
which allows you to save your position,
remove the scenario disk and switch
everything off! Now, reload the program
operating system but this time put in the
second scenario disk you created.
Go through the character creation
and party formation routines, giving
exactly the same information as you did
the ﬁrst time. The scenario disk records
all your characters' changing data as the
game progresses.. including their death.
As this is quite likely to happen fairly
often to start with one of your cheat
disks should be kept as 'clean' as
possible. Use this one when you start
each time and 'save your position' to
the 'clean' one as your characters
gradually improve their standing.
It is almost impossible to get away
without somewhat corrupting these disks
as you continue but at least it will
eliminate a fair amount of time being
spent creating characters when you
would rather be learning how to play!
At Large in Sosaria
You are there at last, with the wind in your
hair, standing with open rolling plains
behind you and a small walled city in front

of you. The display shows a plan view,
with one character indicating the position
of your party. water is shown to the right
of the map and two buildings represent a
castle and the small town. You can see
some woods to the west.
To the right of the map is a 'vital signs'
display of your four characters. This gives
you at a glance, such information as their
food remaining, hit points (0w-cleath),
magic points (spell casting ability) and
their Level (all start at Level 1).
Further status information can be had
by typing 'Z' (ztatus!), this will tell you
how much gold they have, what weapons
or artefacts they are carryinE and their
present strength, dexterity etc.
Naked into the World...
Each character starts with a dagger and
cloth armour (I) but you must tell them to
'Ready the dagger for use and 'W'ear the
cloth armour.. .otherwise they will enter
battle using their bare hands and in their
skins!
They are also provided with 200 pieces
of gold. The sensible thing to do next is
'E'nter the town and visit either the
weapons shop or the armoury. Weapons
may be bought and sold at the listed price
(no haggling!) as also may be food when
you need it, from the grocers.
Just a Quick One...
There is also a pub where useful (?) gossip
may be heard (bought!). In some towns
you may also ﬁnd other useful places, but
you always need to search for these very
carefully. You can even talk to the various
people you meet in the streets.
You are now kitted out to the limit of
your purses and leave the safety of the
town. You have of course read the
instructions that came with this gateway
to another world but you won't have
absorbed all they had to say, and will
perhaps have noticed just some of the
omissions -  like, there is a list of 32
spells...but only one is explained!
The spells have intriguing names such
as REPOND, MITTAR, PONTORI,
SANCTU, LORUM etc. Use of these
depends upon the number of magic

points a character has, these in turn
depend upon character type and how you
allocated those original 50 points. Only by
playing, can you begin to understand how
to achieve a workable balance.
Spell That Again
Try the spells at various times - whilst
walking along, in battle, lost underground
etc. See if you can work out what they do
(I don't know, I've only been playing for
about 30 hours so far!) MITIAR and

SANCTU are both very useful and may be
cast easily by Level 1 characters.
When you meet any other being
outside in the wilds, it (or they) are
naturally bloodthirsty (yours!) and
aggressive. It is occasionally possible to
evade them but...
When combat occurs, the display
shows a larger scale map, with the four
members of your party towards the
bottom and the evil one(s) towards the
top. Once conﬂict has begun there is no
retreat.. and the losers are dead!
Battle at a distance is possible with a
bow (unlimited arrows...great!), magic or
even by throwing a dagger. Usually in the
early stages, hand to hand combat takes
place. Your team may swing their swords,
maces, hands etc. only to the north, south,
west or east. The enemy may also strike on
the diagonal.
Each time a member of the team is hit
their 'hit points' decrease. If they go to
zero, they're dead. Once over the initial
stages of 'ﬁnding out what to do', I found
the combat and magic 'balance' one of
the best I have come across.
Every time a member of your party kills
one of the monsters, points are added to
his or her 'experience points'. The greater
the number of these, the higher the
'Level' the character becomes and the
more effective that person is at everything
attempted.
No Clock Watching
There is a 'real time' element throughout
the game that is acceptable and although
you must act fairly quickly, you do not
have to be crazy fast as in some games.
Having won your victory, the
vanquished foe leaves behind the
proverbial treasure chest. Someone has to
open it to collect the spoils. Needless to
say they are often booby-trapped with a
variety of unpleasant surprises.
If you have a clerical type amongst
your party then all is solved by invoking
APPAR UNEM. If this spell (prayer?) fails
then it is worth trying again. No priestly
type - then the next best thing is a thief,
they can sometimes (!) spot a trap.
If it has been a costly battle then do not
be in a hurry to open the chest.. .a spot of
'healing' (also performed by your clerical
type) may be worthwhile - the baddies
have a habit of appearing at quite the
most inopportune moments!
Monsters come in a variety of different
guises, from renegade wizards, orcs,
trolls, ghouls, zombies, giants, bradles to
daemons, grifﬁns, dragons, devils,
balrons and even sea serpents, to mention
but a few!
A Life on the Ocean
There are also pirates who can ﬁre at you
from their ships at sea. If you happen to be
at sea (yes, your party can board and sail
the occasional ship), there is even ship to
ship combat. If you are at sea then watch
the way the wind is blowing - you cannot
sail into wind, you must tack!
After you have suffered a loss of hit-
points during combat, they will gradually
come back as time passes. The same goes
for any magic points extended in casting
spells. There are also said to be places of
healing in remote areas with restorative
powers which may be purchased - at a
price.
There are any number of towns dotted
around the lands of Sosaria but most are
not laid out in such a simple fashion as the
one from which we started! In fact some
are pure and simple mazes., so keep
pencil and paper handy.
This really goes for the whole game, as,
although you think you know where you
are, all is not quite as clear as it seems.
There are many, many times when the
terrain precludes you seeing much
further than a few metres - in mountains
or thick woods for instance. There is even
one town I've come across like that!
In the States you can buy The Secrets
of Sosaria which maps towns, castles,
dungeons and magic realms. It  also
includes other useful information. Where
can I get a copy?
Be careful what you rE'nter. Dungeons
are shown as a 3-D maze, the four keys
you've been using as 'move N,S,W,E' now
mean forward, retreat and turn left or
right. The problem with dungeons is that
they are dark!
Let There be Light
It is possible to light your way magically
but the spell lasts only a short time and can
only be  considered as a  stop-gap
measure. You have to ﬁnd/buy (?) a lamp
or torch.
There are also a few hidden 'Moon-
Gates'. Travelling through these will
teleport your party "to many glens of the
old knowledge". These 'portals' are
affected by the twin moons of Sosaria -
Trammel and felucca - and to help you in
your understanding of the working of
these, the phases of the moons are
included in the main display!
To stop playing, press 'Q', to save your
Party's present status and simply remove
the disk - but only after disk drive has
stopped running of course - and switch
everything off.
On your next visit to Sosaria, you may
either carry on where you left off, or
disband the party and form another one.
New characters may also be introduced at
this time perhaps to be taken under the
wing of more experienced adventurers!
This program is really the most
complex and rewarding I've been
fortunate enough to play for ages. It even
includes the option for regular adventure
verb commands in special situations, such
as 'KISS PRINCESS' or 'JUMP CLIFF'! In
fact there is a lot more to this game than
can possibly be covered here.
There is an underlying plot to Ultima
In addition to being a ﬁrst class role
playing adventure. It is concerned with
events that took place in a previous
adventure: Siege Perilous. A ny
knowledge o f  this is  completely
unnecessary, it merely sets the scene for
this vastly uprated descendant.
The basic story-line is the rising power
of evil and the call by Lord British to
would-be adventurers, to rid the land of
an as yet unspeciﬁed malignant evil entity.
There are some clues that may or may not
help one of which is the word Exodus
scrawled in blood, found on a derelict
merchant ship.
Perhaps I  might get round to the
deeper meanings of Ultima lii in a month
or six, but for now my rusty sword has
been cleaned and honed to perfection,
my boots have new nails and I've just had
my last cigarette. Be seeing you.. .in
Sosaria.
Foot Note
Unfortunately, U S gold, the  U K
distributor, has only included in the
package the game disk, the book of play
and the reference card omitting the map
and additional booklets describing the
spells available to the clerics and mages.
Since these will be vital to your success in
the game, Computer Gamer will be
publishing the vital mission material in its
September issue.

THIS PRODUCT IS A VERY INTERESTING
combination for the C64 user. It is both a
motherboard to  enable u p  to  three
cartridges to be installed simultaneously
and also an IEEE interface.
If you own an earlier Commodore
machine you may already own a disk
drive. The early models used the IEEE 488
parallel bus normally known as the "I-
triple-E" bus. This was a slight variation on
the original design by Hewlett Packard.
When the Vic 20 arrived. Commodore,
to many peoples amazement, changed to
a Serial system. This resulted in data being
passed along the line with the bits
following one another rather than eight
bits going in parallel. Obviously, this
slowed down the data transfer rate and
the 1541 disk drive used on the Vic 20 and
the 64 has been slated for its slow
performance ever since. This same
process has been adopted on the CI6 and
the Plus/4.
The faithful Commodore user must
buy some form of interface to make the
4040, 8050, 8250, 1001, and 2031 drives
work with the 64. Oxford Computer
Systems Interpod - happily still available -
solves this problem but enables these
disks to communicate with the 64 at only
the same speed at the 1541.
What the average user wants is to be
able to take advantage of the maximum
speed of which the disk drive is capable.
Generally speaking th e  interfaces
which are available rely on placing some
machine code in the memory. of the 64.
This sometimes conﬂicts with memory
demands made by advanced packages.
There are difﬁculties when it comes to
connecting a number of cartridges to the
64 and switching between them. Many
and more ingenious manufacturers are
putting protection into their cartridges
which creates problems.
Handic's approach was to supply an
IEEE interface board enabling the user to
choose between three cartridges plugged
in at once, whilst at the same time being
able to use Commodore disk drives at full
speed. In addition, the product has a
Reset button.
This was an interesting aspect of the
design because i t  combined three
desirable features. It is frustrating to plug
in another board in order to use your
cartridges only to ﬁnd that you cannot use
your disk drives.
The Superbox is a Swedish product
and seems very durable. The rigid metal
case looks as if you could drive a car over it
without damage.
The only protrusions are the edge
connectors. One for your IEEE cable and
the other for plugging into the cartridge
slot on the machine. There are rubber feet
on the bottom to make sure that the box
will lie ﬂat. No RAM in the 64 is used and
this avoids any memory conﬂict.
In order to pick up the necessary
signals it is necessary for you to connect a
crocodile clip to a single resistor on the
C64 board. This is not a difﬁcult task to do
but nervous and ham-ﬁsted users may
prefer to get their dealer to do this for
them. Fortunately you can remove the
box, should you need to do so, whilst
retaining the connection.
The switching has been very pleasantly
designed indeed. At the far end of the
box, is a set of ﬁve switches. As you switch
on one cartridge slot the other switches
pop up: the only way you can accidentally
have two cartridges in the circuit at once is
by pushing two buttons simultaneously.
The IEEE button will connect you to
your parallel IEEE device. The Reset
button is a great advantage because the 64
unlike its successors, the C16 and the
Plus/4, had no reset button whatsoever.
By pressing this red reset switch a "Cold
start" is performed which leaves the
contents in RAM unaffected, if the system
has "hung" use of this button may get you
out of trouble without losing any data.
In Use
Testing the box with a variety of cartridges
showed that most of them would work
perfectly OK. Certain types of cartridge
however would not function correctly.
There is a somewhat startling warning
in the brief A4 sheet manual saying that if
an IEEE u nit is connected to the board and
not switched on when the machine is
running, th e  Superbox 6 4  may b e
damaged. Inquiries o f  Handic UK,
conﬁrmed that this was merely an
example of Swedish caution and not to be
taken too seriously.
You are warned not to connect more
than two IEEE units at the same time and to
make sure that all units connected are
switched on before running the system. I
was not tempted to test this out with a
variety of extra IEEE units!
Conclusion
At E69, the superbox 64 is not a cheap
product in fact if you compare it directly
with another mother board you will ﬁnd it
extremely highly priced. However you are
really getting two products for the price of
one! Highly recommended.
The only difﬁculty likely t o  b e
experienced in using the Superbox arises
because of its all-or-nothing approach to
life. You are expected to be using either
all Serial or all Parallel IEEE devices. An
addendum to the manual gives a partial ﬁx
for this.
By PEEKing ﬁve memory locations and
recording their content manually, you
enable the use o f the Reset button
without the loss of a Basic program. Thus,
you press the button to switch between
IEEE Serial and Parallel in either direction
and then press the Reset button. Finally,

PART 1 OF THIS SERIES DEALT ONLY
with decimal and hexadecimal codes
because they are the most popular for
general purpose use. However, there is
another method of representing binary
known as Binary Coded Decimal, (BCD
for short). The 6502 microprocessor is
particularly well equipped for handling
this type of code, The common arithmetic
processes of addition and subtraction are,
by default, carried out in normal two's
complement binary. I t  is  possible t o
change this by using the instruction SW
which is the mnemonic for SEt Decimal
mode. Once the machine has executed
SED, (op-code F8 hex) all subsequent
arithmetic is carried out in BCD until
cancelled by CLD (op-code D8) which is
the mnemonic for CLear Decimal mode.
The BCD code
Before considering the areas where BCD
might be useful, we must understand the
mechanism o f  t h e  underlying code.
Perhaps the easiest way to start is by
examining the following byte, artiﬁcially

understanding:
If this was interpreted in terms of absolute
(unsigned) binary, it would represent 146

signed binary (two's complement) i t
would represent -110in decimal. Finally, if
interpreted in BCD, it would represent
the decimal number 92, In fact, the space

understanding of the mechanism behind
BCD. Each nibble should be thought of as
a separate black box, the right-hand box
represents the units column and the left-
hand box represents the tens column.
Here are some BCD examples;
1000 0111 = 87.
0110 0001 = 61.
0111 0111 = 77.
0101 0000 5 0 ,
Redundancies
Apart f r o m  t h e  d i f f e r e n c e  i n
interpretation, the BCD code has, what
the code bofﬁns are pleased t o  call,
redundancies. W e  can see what this
means when we consider the number of
possible ways in which 8 binary bits can be
arranged. For simplicity, let's start with two
bits. These can only be arranged in four
ways, 00,01,10 and 11. Three bits can be
arranged in 8 ways, 000,001,010,011.100,
101,110 and M .  So for two bits, there are
four ways (2
eight ways (2)) so we can deduce from this
that the general formula for knowing the
number of ways of arranging N bits is 2N.
Now, in the case of an eight bit byte, we
shall expect that there are 2a = 128 ways of
arranging the bits. Normal binary and
hexadecimal codes use all these combina-
tions but BCD doesn't. In fact, as the
following table shows, there are six illegal
combinations (redundancies) i n  each

As you can see, the illegal combinations
are those greater than 1001. These are the
combinations normally represented by
the letters A to F in hexadecimal.
We c o n c lu d e  t h e r e f o r e  t h a t

inefﬁcient because, out of 16 possible
combinations, only  1 0 are used. I n
percentage terms, this represents an
efﬁciency of only (10/16) x 100= 62.5%. As
far as memory usage is concerned, we
need about 30% extra memory space to
store numbers of BCD form because a full
nibble is still required for each BCD digit
in spite of the combinations which remain
unused. We can represent efﬁciency in a
more obvious way by comparing BCD
with unsigned binary in respect of the
largest number capability. The largest
legal combination in BC[) is 1001 1001,99
in decimal, whereas in unsigned binary
the largest is 255 decimal,

BCD addition
Since w e  mustn't us e combinations
greater than 1001, what exactly happens
when we add 1 to 9 in BCD? Under normal
binary conditions, the addition would be
quite straightforward:
0000 1001
add 0000 000l
0 0
But, the right hand nibble now has an
illegal combination! However, if the 6502
had been previously instructed (by means
of SED) to perform the addition in BCD, it
would perform as follows:
000
add 0000 0001
0001 0 0
Note that adding the 1 has resulted in a
premature carry fr om the right-hand
nibble into the left-hand nibble. It is
called the 'half carry' to distinguish it from
the normal carry out from the msb end.
Note carefully that t h e  total (10 in
decimal) is correct in BCD format, How
does the microprocessor perform this bit
of trickery? Actually, the answer is simple.
It performs the addition in normal binary
and then tests the result. If the right-hand
nibble is illegal it then adds a further six.
This may seem mysterious but is quite
logical when you think about it because
there are six illegal combinations which
must be skipped. Examine the following
example, using the previous ﬁgures:
0.0
add 0000 0001
0000 1010 illegal, so
add 6 0000 0110
0001 0000 result correct in BCD
What use is BCD?
Program 12.3 Convert hex Aga to ASCII.
You should try out this trick with various
combinations to convince yourself that it
works every time.
Since BCD has been demonstrated to be
inefﬁcient, the obvious question is what
do we get in return? One answer, not the
most important, is  simplicity. O nly  a
cursory glance at the contents of a BCD
byte is sufﬁcient for most of us to convert
into the equivalent decimal. However, a
more substantial reason for  including
BCD i n  a  computer is  t o  make i t
compatible w ith external equipment,
particularly the vast army of  digitally
controlled instruments. Most instruments
of this form are equipped to either accept
BCD formatted inputs or deliver BCD
outputs. For example, a digital voltmeter

computer.
It is  realised, o f  course, that the
majority of readers may not have access to
such equipment in  which case these
facilities may be of little interest. But, we
should remember that any computer has
vast potential. It is possible that addiction
to games, entertaining though they may
be for a time, may not last for ever and
many users may feel the urge to exploit
their machines in other directions. We
should bear in mind that the input output
bus in Commodore machines, ever since
the days of the original PET 2001, have
been based o n  an industry accepted
standard known as the IEEE bus protocol.
True, the Commodore employs a slightly
modiﬁed version o f  the bus but, in
general, it is reasonably compatible. We
have no space in this article to discuss the
details of the bus although we should
point out that BCD is the accepted code
used for passing numerical data between
computer arid external equipment.

stone for other conversions.
Code conversions
The above discussion on BCD raises the
general question of conversion between
codes. It is often required to convert
information from one code to another,
either f o r  reasons o f  efﬁciency o r
convenience. The conversion can b e
achieved by  short program segments,
preferably written in machine code. For
the most part, they are short so instead of
the usual practice o f  presenting a n
additional hex dump. we shall present
them in full assembly form which includes
the equivalent op-codes in hex.
Convert BCD digit to  ASCII
(See Program 12.1)
Program 12.1 Convert BCD digit to ASCII
For the beneﬁt of those who do not have
an assembler, the columns, reading from
left t o  r ight, hav e t h e  following
signiﬁcance:
Column 1 is a line number, used for
reference pruposes only. (You can't jump
to a line number like we do in BASIC).
Column 2  is the hex address o f  the
location which stores the ﬁrst byte of the
current instruction.
Column 3 is the instruction in terms of
machine code hex digits.
Depending on the instruction, there may
be one, two or three pairs of hex digits.
The ﬁrst pair will always be the op-code
and the remaining pairs, if any, will be a
single or double byte operand.
Column 4 is the label ﬁeld. That is to say, it
will contain arbitrarily chosen labels for
branch destinations. II no labels are used,
the column is left blank.
Column 5 is the instruction in assembly
language, consisting of  the mnemonic
code and operand.
Those without an assembler will have to
place Column 3 machine code bytes in
the data statements of the hex loading
program given in part 3 of this series
(December issue). Taking program 12.1 as
an example, the data statements would be
entered as follows:
DATA 18.A5,EB,69,30,85,F13,60
Description of program 12.1
Line 10 starts with I so it is simply a remark.
Line 20 tells the assembler to locate the
program starting at the address $C000. (In
our assembler. $ means hex, not string).
Line 30 tells the assembler that the address
$F13 is to be known by the symbolic name
MEM. I t  is  assumed that the current
contents of MEM is holding the BCD digit
to be converted.
Line 40 dears the carry ready for the later
addition.
Line SO loads the accumulator with the
BCD digit.
Line 60 uses immediate addressing to add
hex 30 (decimal 48) to the BCD digit.
Suppose MEM originally held 3. When 48
is added, it would hold 51 which is the
ASCII code for 3.
Line 70 stores the converted number back
in the original location. The program can
be used as a subroutine called from within
a BASIC program by using SYS 49152.
This simple program has been treated
in extra detail because the full assembly
format may be new to some readers. It is
hoped that the programs which follow
can be understood without resorting to a
similar line by line analysis.
Converting ASCII to BCD digit
(See Program 12.2)
Program 12.2 Converting ASCII to BCD
digit
This is virtually the mirror image of the
previous program, the only difference is
that $30 is subtracted instead of being
added. However, we should note that the
carry has to be set, using SEC, before a
new subtraction instead of being cleared
by CLC.
Convert hex digit to ASCII (See
Program (12.3)
Program 12.3 Convert hex digit to ASCII
Line 60 compares the value of the hex
digit with 10 decimal. If the carry is clear in
line 70, it signiﬁes that it was less than 10 so
a branch is made to line 90 which adds hex
30 to lift it into the ASCII band.

showed that the hex digit was 10 or
greater, an extra six is added to allow for
the gap of seven between the ASCII code
for 9 and the ASCII code for A. Note that
the carry is always set before the ADC 6
instruction so, in effect, we are adding 7.
Coverting ASCII to hex digit
(See Program 12.4)
Program 12.4 Convert ASCII to the hex
digit.
This program is almost a mirror image of
the previous one, except of course that
subtraction of hex 30 is involved instead of
addition which is why line 40 sets the
carry. Notice that, this time, the full 7 is
subtracted (the gap between ASCII '9' and
ASCII 'A') since the SBC instruction is
entered with the carry set.
Addition of BCD numbers (See
Program 12.5)
Program 12.5 Add two BCD numbers and
display result
The program is intended only as a guide to
the general procedure of adding in BCD.
Because of this, the simple constants Band
9 have been used for the two numbers.
The result, 17, is arranged to be printed
out o n  t h e  screen using the R O M
s ubroutine CHRO UT . ( W e  m u s t
remember that CHROUT will only print
the character corresponding to the ASCII
code i n  t h e  accumulator.) Practical
versions will, of course, be more likely to
supply the numbers as variables.
How the program works
Lines 3 0  t o  60 assign t h e  symbolic
addresses NUMBER1, NUMBER2 and
RESULT together with the ROM character
output subroutine at address FFD2 hex.
Line 80, by use of the instruction SED,
makes use of the 6502's ability to perform
all following arithmetic in BCD.
Lines 90 and 120 store the arbitrary con-
stants for later use.
Lines 130 to 160 performs the addition of
BCD, the add-6 operation is carried out
automatically by SED.
Lines 170 and 180 store the result and
then call on OUTPUT. The machine is
then reset for normal binary arithmetic by
use of CLD. The subroutine OUTPUT is
used t o  prepare the accumulator for
action by CHROUT.
A copy of the raw data is ﬁrst placed on
E

The accumulator is then shifted right 4

places in order to position the higher
order digit at the right:
The addition of 30 hex is then added to lift
the number into the ASCII band. the
accumulator will now contain:
0011 0001 (31 hex, 49 decimal)
This is the ASCII for the digit '1' so when
the subroutine CHROUT is called, this will
appear as the ﬁrst digit result on the
screen. The original raw data is pulled
back from the stack using PLA so the
accumulator now holds, as before:
0001 0111 ( 17 BCD)
We now AND with:
0000 1111 ( O F  hex)
which produces:
0000 0111
As you can see, the accumulator now
holds only the least signiﬁcant digit (7) of
the original BCD result, The usual 30 hex is
then added to convert to ASCII so the
accumulator n o w  holds  3 7  hex  ( 55
decimal) which is the ASCII code for 7.
The accumulator is then sent to the screen
via another call to CHROUT for displaying
the second digit of the result.
Displaying contents of location
in hex (See Program 12.6)
Program 12,6 Displaying contents o f
location in hex.
This program does not justify detailed
explanation since it is broadly similar to
the previous one. This time, SED is not
used, we expect that somewhere along
the line, we have to add six, (see line 170).
Summary
This article has attempted to show some of
the various techniques which can be used
for code conversion. Consequently, the
programs should be interpreted only as
guide lines to be introduced in practical
subroutines.

I and Basic.
1
IF YOU WRITE MACHINE CODE JUST TO
improve y our  Basic programs, there
comes a time when you M/C routines
cannot stand alone and need values
passed to them from Basic. The simplest
way to achieve this is by POKEing the rele-
vant values into memory and picking
them out using your routine, if you do this
the best locations to use are those used to
store the 6502's registers which are acces-
sed during a SYS call, they are as:
780 Accumulator
781 X register
782 Y register
783 Status register
Perhaps the best known example of this
method is a basic program to PRINT AT
using the KERNAL routine PLOT:
10 POKE 781„ROW
20 POKE 782,COLUMN
30 POKE 783,0
40 SYS 65520:REM call PLOT routine
50 PRINT "Pretty cumbersome though
isn't it?"
Unfortunately, this method only allows
you to use integers from 0-255.
If you need to use a bigger number a
better method is to use the Basic USR
function I've never seen this used in a
program which is probably due to the lack
of documentation about it in the manuals.
E
The USR function enables the passing of
74 o n e  ﬂoating point number in the range 0-
65535 to your m/c program. The function
takes the value converts it  to ﬂoating
point and places it in the ﬂoating point
accumulator 1 and then activates the M/C
routine pointed to by the low/high bytes
P r o g r a m m i n g
at 785/786. All your WC  routine needs is
to use the routine CONN at $ BM  which
converts a  ﬂoating point number in
FPACC11 to an integer in $14 and $15.
10 R EM set USRADD to $CAAA
20 POKE 785,170
30 POKE 786,202
40 P=USR(65535):REM evaluates 65535
to FPACC1 then executes routine at
$CAAA
M/C routines:
CAAA JSR $137F7
LDA $ 1 4
TAX
IDA $ 1 5
'convert PA-
CC1 to integer
in $14 and $15
'save low byte in
X-reg
CAB2 T A Y  ' s
a v
e  high byte
in Y-reg
The third method is  slightly more
complicated but is deﬁnitely the best,
that is, extending the SYS call to pass
values as well e.g. SYS addr. value 1, value
2, etc. This can only be done at machine
level and needs the use of a number of
ROM routines.
The ﬁrst o f  these is  C H  ARGET.
Although this resides in ROM, a copy of it
can be found located in ZERO-PAGE at
location $0073. I t  is used by  Basic to
collect bytes of the current instruction
(and is, therefore in zero-page for speed),
in fact we only need a part of it called
CHARGOT at $0079. This collects the
current byte without ﬁrst updating the
pointer, otherwise the point at $007B
would be updated and we would miss the
ﬁrst parameter. The second routine is
CEKCOM at $AEFD. This checks for a
comma after the address, if it does not
ﬁnd one a 'SYNTAX ERROR' is generated.
The third routine is EVAL at $AD8A this is a
complex routine whic h evaluates an
expression and converts it  to ﬂoating
point and then places it in FPACC1. The
last routine CINT at St37F7 I have already
described.,
To illustrate how to use these routines
I've written a small program which is a
M/C version of listing 1 i.e. it sets the cur-
sor position for PRINT but without all the
POKEs, just one SYS call.

As you can see, the process is repeated for
each paramter except that CHARGOT is
only used once. Also, the advantage of
using EVAL at $A08A, is that expressions
such as 5*C0S(10) or  variables can be
used. Finally, to use the routine:

Barry Miles plugs into the
iviW350 Printer Graphics
citerface, which makes a
larger selection of printers
available to Commodore
users.
ADVANCED BUSINESS PROGRAMS FOR
the CBM 64 use the entire memory of the
machine. This entails conﬂict over the use
of the same memory area. Micrographics'
MW350 Printer Graphics Interface for the
Commodore 64 and VIC 20 has its own
power supply and, therefore, solves this
probleml
Initial impressions
On the top surface of the attractive little
box there is a reset button and six dip
switches which enable you to conﬁgure
your interface to match quite a long list of
printers, including Epson. Nec and Oki.
Other manufacturers' models are catered
for where they have similar characteristics
to one of those listed. The ﬁve-foot cable
leading to the computer is sturdy, rubber
covered and ends in a no-nonsense metal
Din connector with a sp:ing protecting it
from being bent at too sharp an angle. The
ribbon cable is long enough to connect to
a fairly distant printer.
The additional connection t o  the
cassette port is optional, because some
printers will supply a ﬁve volt electrical
supply to pin 18 of the 36 pin connector,
Connecting up
You are advised to ensure that all the
peripherals are powered up before the
computer is switched on and sends a reset
signal to initialise the disc and printer. If
the printer scrolls one line upwards, the
interface is working. If it does not, you
may ﬁnd that the printer is not on line,
possibly because the pa per-end detection
device is working.
Conveniently, the printer interface
will produce a status report to show you
what's what. The status report is quite
informative. For example, it tells you
which printer you have set your interface
to work with, or whether your line feed is
in operation,
Documentation
The documentation is  very thorough.
However, it is printed in green and in
rather small ty pe! A  very detailed
introductory section runs to six chapters.
Five chapters o f  reference material
follow.

In operation
As supplied the MW350 will function
with virtually all printers. To get the best
out of your system, you set up the three
dip switches to match the printer type
which you are using. I used an Epson MO.
The Universal setting will enable you to
use a Daisywheel printer, although of
course the graphics capability is then lost.
Switch 5 controls the ASCII character
conversion, Switch 6 selects the device
number. If you change the switch settings
after power-up you must press the Reset
button.
Commodore 1525 emulation
When dipswitch number 5 is in the off
position, you obtain an exact simulation
of the 1525's performance. If you send the
appropriate control codes you will be
able to do double-width printing, or have
columnar tabs up to 80 print positions
available by sending CHR$116) followed
by 2  numbers wh ich  specify th e  start
column. You can also set up yo u r own
user-deﬁnable character and can even do
dot tabulation, taking your print head to
any one of 480 dot positions. There is a
Graphic Repeat function which repeats a
single graphics character.
In the Emulate mode, you are also able
to use additional commands which are
peculiar to the MW350. By opening a ﬁle
to your printer with a secondary address
of 1, you arrange that all the commands
which normally result in a reverse ﬁeld
character appearing w hen a  BASIC
program is listed, are now translated into
readable mnemonics. This makes your
listings transparently obvious, even if you
have not memorised the Commodore
symbols.
In this mode you are not able to print
Commodore graphics as graphics. What is
printed instead is the key which would be
struck o n  the keyboard in  order t o
produce that graphic symbol. This is
particularly helpful f o r  printing o u t
programs which use vertical or horizontal
bar graphics symbols, which are very
difﬁcult to distinguish from one another.
You can also set the left and right hand
printer margins to leave plenty of space
for notes o r to perforate the sheets for
ﬁling purposes.
Sending control codes
The Transparent mode o f  operation
enables you to send codes to your printer
which control various special features.
You merely open the ﬁle to the printer
with a secondary address of ﬁve, Once
this is done all print commands are sent
literally. Problems could arise i f  you
wanted to send commands to the printer
while you were already in Emulate mode.
The Commodore 1525 itself reacts to
certain escape sequences. However this
has been catered for by arranging that the
control sequence w i l l  b e  correctly
transmitted to your printer if you precede
it by an extra ESCAPE character.
The MW350 has a number of extra
features to make life easy. You will ﬁnd it
useful to keep the interface close at hand,
because the switches and buttons are
likely to be in continuous use. The push
button initialises the interface. If you are
using single sheet mode, the printer
pauses at the bottom of each page. You
simply press the button once to continue
printing. There is a monitor which is used
to check whether the interface is working
satisfactorily. You can defeat the right
margin of 80 columns if your printer has a
wide platten and you need to use that.
There is  a  'skip-over perforations'
feature, which is disabled on power-up.
This is combined with a form length
setting command which enables you to
accommodate different sized sheets of
paper.
Conclusions
This interface h a s a  w i d e  ra n g e  o f
capabilities, is very easy to use and ﬁlls a
substantial need. Whilst quite expensive,
its versatility, in  offering Commodore
users a wider selection of printers, justiﬁes
the price. And,  t h e  Emulate mode
prevents the frustration of not being able
to use Commodore printer-orientated
software. The MW350 is well designed,
robust and is highly recommended.

Are your ﬁles in a
mess? Get them
sorted out with this
program by Les Allan.
WHEN SAVING FILES TO DISK,
it is nice to retain an orderly
sequence so as to keep a group
of ﬁles together. However,
when a ﬁle is scratched from
the disk a 'gap' is left in the
directory such that the next
SAVE is made to that location.
This means that if a number of
associated ﬁles are being made
the sequence is jumbled.
Utilities exist on the market
such as a disk dissector that
enables a tidy routine to be
applied to the directory but
again the sequence can be lost
as t h e  routine used is  a n
alphabetic s ort and n o t  a
manual one.
D•INS•K
ORDERLY
With this utility the order
can be decided upon by the
user simply by swapping any
two locations at a time until the
desired sequence is obtained.
OK! I t  m a y  t ak e several
operations to get the directory
sequence but i t  works and
works well.
The utility works by reading
the directory contents into
several arrays t o  store t h e
name, track and sector, ﬁle
type and ﬁle data which is then
displayed o n the screen for
editing. Due to the limitation of
the screen t h e  max imum
number of entries allowed is
40. Simply  select t h e  t w o
locations t o  b e  swapped,
repeating the process for as
long as necessary, and select *
or N to write the new directory.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT were very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because—
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX,
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card
