Preface 
The discovery of Raman scattering unfolded during a period of profound shifts in the 
perspectives of researchers. Classical physics, once the dominant deterministic 
framework, was yielding ground to the probabilistic realm of quantum theory. 
During this transformative period, reluctance to relinquish familiar concepts led to 
the establishment of new postulates put forward by Niels Bohr. These postulates 
were expected to restore predictability and comprehension in the ever-evolving 
landscape of physics. 
Yet, the unquestionable validity of these new postulates was not immediately 
apparent, leading to a greater reliance on mathematical manipulations rather than 
intuitive physical insight. With time, it became apparent that these new postulates 
held true only under speciﬁc conditions. Interestingly, quantum descriptions 
remained applicable even when these seemingly steadfast conditions were violated. 
This extension of the theory revealed that classical and quantum viewpoints were not 
as divergent as their mathematical frameworks might have suggested. 
This cognitive evolution ﬁnds a parallel in the development of theories 
concerning the scattering of electromagnetic waves. Various studies of optical 
phenomena within the classical physics framework provided only partial insights 
into observed phenomena. For instance, Rayleigh’s theory explained the elastic 
scattering of light as the radiation of a dipole induced on a molecule by incident 
radiation, shedding light on the color of the sky. However, this classical theory fell 
short in explaining the spectral line narrowness observed in the Sun’s spectrum, 
which hinted at the resonant nature of these lines. It was only through the lens of 
quantum mechanics that a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of this 
phenomenon emerged. 
Certain light scattering phenomena ﬁnd their explanations exclusively within the 
realm of quantum mechanics, and these are not conﬁned to obscure phenomena only 
known to narrow specialists. A prominent illustration is Raman scattering, a funda-
mental technique for investigating molecular vibrations. Classical explanations have 
consistently fallen short in their attempts to unravel this phenomenon. To truly
v

comprehend its intricacies, the application of quantum mechanical concepts is 
essential from the very outset.

Preface
Understanding Raman scattering necessitates the embrace of quantum mechani-
cal concepts like photon absorption and stimulated emission, governed by the 
interaction of quantized vibrational energy levels with the quantized light ﬁeld. 
This coupling leads to characteristic inelastic scattering events, manifest as Stokes 
and anti-Stokes shifts in the scattered photon energy, directly providing a ﬁngerprint 
of the molecule’s vibrational spectrum. The inability of classical models to predict 
these shifts underscores the fundamental quantum nature of the interaction. There-
fore, a thorough comprehension of Raman scattering necessitates a ﬁrm grasp of 
quantum mechanics, utilizing tools like the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and the 
vibrational state of molecules. 
This book delves into a contemporary exploration of various phenomena in the 
ﬁeld of light scattering without diving into the historical evolution of light scattering 
theory. Whenever feasible, we provide insights into both quantum and semiclassical 
approaches to these phenomena. 
In our descriptions of all optical phenomena, we adopt a uniﬁed conceptual 
platform—the fundamental premise that, for an atom to emit photons, it must interact 
with an electromagnetic wave and a reservoir of free-state modes. This approach 
allows us to treat the systems under consideration as open systems, facilitating our 
understanding of light-scattering phenomena. 
Effectively describing open systems requires a meticulous deployment of math-
ematical and physical tools, including the Heisenberg-Langevin equations and 
master Lindblad equations. While we have aimed to ensure that the book remains 
accessible to graduate students and newcomers to the ﬁeld, we have not shied away 
from including mathematical details where necessary. As a result, some sections of 
the book contain lengthy derivations and complex formulas. To balance this, we 
have placed some derivations within problems. This approach serves a dual purpose: 
allowing readers to assess their comprehension and mathematical proﬁciency while 
keeping the main text uncluttered. At the conclusion of each part of the book, we 
provide comprehensive solutions to all the problems presented. 
Throughout the book, we draw from various concepts in electrodynamics, quan-
tum mechanics, and condensed matter physics. Some of these concepts are not 
essential for a basic understanding of the text; hence, we have segregated them 
into Remarks. Omitting these remarks should not hinder reader’s comprehension of 
the core text. However, for readers seeking a deeper grasp of the subject, we 
recommend reading the remarks in conjunction with the primary text. 
Central to our study is the thorough examination of the interaction between 
molecular electrons and the vibrations of molecular nuclei. We have established 
that this interaction has a form of the Fröhlich electron-phonon interaction, a concept 
well established in solid-state physics. This facilitates the bridging of the quantum 
interpretation of Raman phenomena with its classical counterpart. 
Our approach marks a departure from the conventional spectroscopic description, 
which predominantly operates within the Schrödinger picture. Instead, we pivot to

the Heisenberg picture, which allows for interpreting Raman phenomena as driven 
by external force oscillations of a quantum system. 
Preface
vii
Numerous excellent texts and reviews examine various aspects of open quantum 
systems, exploring topics ranging from quantum thermodynamics and the Lindblad 
equation to Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations. They offer comprehensive 
insights into ﬁelds as diverse as laser theory, quantum cryptography, and entangled 
states. However, the application of these advanced approaches has grown increas-
ingly challenging, especially for young researchers aiming to navigate their research 
domains effectively. 
The primary objective of this book is to serve as a bridge between various 
methodologies for describing the interaction of light with the material environment. 
It aims to dispel misconceptions and eliminate folklore that has accumulated around 
the interpretation of light-scattering phenomena. In particular, this book seeks to 
elucidate the connection between the traditional “spectroscopic” optics based on 
Fermi’s golden rule and contemporary concepts. 
We hope that this book will serve as a resource for a diverse audience, including 
young scientists embarking on the path of exploring the intricacies of light scattering 
physics, engineers and researchers who employ Raman scattering techniques in their 
practical work, and experimenters seeking a deeper comprehension of the latest 
developments in the theory of Rayleigh and Raman scatterings.

Part I 
The Rayleigh Scattering

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
Probing materials with various particles and analyzing the resulting scattering 
patterns is a fundamental technique for investigating their internal structure. In 
studies of the structure of atoms and molecules, photons are usually used as probing 
particles. The origins of this method can be traced back to the groundbreaking work 
of Tyndall in 1869 [1], who experimentally observed the light scattered by very 
small particles. 
The theory that explained Tyndall’s experiments was developed by Rayleigh [2], 
who considered the problem of the elastic scattering of an electromagnetic 
(EM) wave by a subwavelength particle. Rayleigh’s theory, employing the princi-
ples of classical electrodynamics, attributed the scattering phenomenon to the forced 
oscillations of the induced polarizability of a subwavelength particle. The developed 
theory explained the blue hue of the sky by assuming that light was scattered by 
density ﬂuctuations of a uniform medium [3]. 
Rayleigh’s approach to light scattering encountered some problems. The emer-
gence of new experimental data revealing narrow dark lines in the sun’s spectrum [4] 
did not ﬁt into this theory. These lines suggested an underlying resonance phenom-
enon, while classical electrodynamics does not predict any resonances when light is 
scattered by subwavelength particles. This and many other problems were success-
fully resolved by quantum mechanics, which emerged at the dawn of the twentieth 
century. 
In 1913, Bohr [5] proposed his planetary model of the atom, in which, in the 
absence of external radiation, electrons can only move along a set of stationary 
elliptical orbits or shells. Each orbit has a certain energy, and an electron can only 
have the energy associated with one of the orbits. This starkly contrasts classical 
electrodynamics, in which electrons moving around the atomic nucleus form a time-
varying dipole moment, emit EM waves, and lose energy. In fact, Bohr postulated 
the existence of discrete stationary states characterized by their own energies. Only 
under the inﬂuence of incident light can an electron transition between orbits by 
absorbing or emitting a quantum of light. According to Bohr’s assumption, the 
energy of the atom-ﬁeld system is conserved. Consequently, the energy of the

quantum of emitted light should precisely match the energy difference between the 
initial and ﬁnal states, ħω = Ei - Ef. This explains dark lines in the solar spectrum. 
Bohr’s work was the beginning of quantum mechanics, which emerged as a widely 
recognized scientiﬁc discipline in the early 1930s. Later, such a vision developed 
into a whole direction in molecular optics – spectroscopy [6].

Introduction
From the principle of correspondence of quantum-mechanical operators to clas-
sical quantities, it follows that in quantum mechanics, the interaction of light with an 
atom may have a dipole character, as in the classical Rayleigh theory of light 
scattering. 
The quantum operator of the dipole moment is antisymmetric with respect to the 
change in the sign of the coordinates; therefore, its expectation value of the interac-
tion operator is nonzero only if the initial and ﬁnal states have different parity. 
Rayleigh scattering is an elastic process in which the atom must return to its original 
state after an act of scattering. Thus, the parity of the initial and ﬁnal wave function is 
the same, and from the quantum mechanical point of view, the Rayleigh scattering 
cannot happen. To obtain a nonzero result, the light scattering is treated as a 
sequence of acts of photon absorption and emission [7, 8]; i.e., it is assumed that 
during the Rayleigh scattering, the atom passes from the ground state to some 
intermediate, excited state and then returns to the ground state [9]. 
The main difﬁculty of this approach lies in its limitation to the resonant case, 
where the energy of the incident photon precisely matches the energy difference 
between the atomic levels, ħωext = ΔEif. Generally, a molecule has no eigenstate 
separated from the ground state by the energy that equals to ħωext. To resolve this 
difﬁculty, virtual states and virtual transitions were introduced artiﬁcially [7, 8, 
10]. Throughout the book, we refer to such an approach as the spectroscopic 
approach. 
While the spectroscopic approach to scattering provides a vivid conceptualization 
of the phenomenon, it harbors an internal inconsistency. As experiments show, the 
Rayleigh scattering, as an elastic process, after which the atom reverts to its original 
energy state. To reconcile the theory with experiment, the virtual level should have a 
very narrow linewidth or an exceptionally long lifetime, which contradicts the 
assumption of rapid photon reemission [7, 8]. This is why evidence of the existence 
of virtual states has never been found. In this book, we show that modern quantum 
mechanics allows us to describe the light-scattering phenomena without employing 
the concept of virtual states. 
Rabi [11] and Jaynes and Cummings [12] works marked the emergence of a new 
view on the atom interaction with EM radiation. It was shown that an atom 
resonantly interacting with a monochromatic mode of incident light neither absorbs 
nor emits photons – there is only periodic motion from one stationary state to 
another. This motion involves a continuous, endless energy exchange between the 
incident ﬁeld and the atom. This means that the resonant harmonic ﬁeld cannot cause 
the atom transition between stationary states. 
The theory of open quantum systems showed that an irreversible state change 
may only happen in an open quantum system, i.e., the system interacting with a 
reservoir of an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom [13–18]. In the scattering

problem, it means that in addition to the interaction of an atom with incident light, we 
have to take into account the interaction with the reservoir of free space modes, 
which are not included in the incident ﬁeld. The dynamics of an open quantum 
system cannot be described by either the Schrödinger equation or the Heisenberg 
operator equations. Instead, one has to use the Lindblad equation or the Heisenberg-
Langevin operator equations.

Introduction

In this book, we develop a theory of light scattering by atoms, which is based on 
ideas of open quantum systems. To simplify the math and gain insight into the 
physical picture of the atom-photon interaction, we model the atom by a two-level 
system (TLS). This commonly used approximation is valid if only two atomic 
energy levels involved in the phenomenon under consideration are essential [19]. 
In Chap. 2, we consider the behavior of a TLS interacting with classical and 
quantized ﬁelds (the Rabi and the Jaynes-Cummings problems, respectively). In 
both cases, we deal with “closed” quantum systems described by time-dependent 
Hamiltonians. To describe these systems, we use the following approaches: the 
“dressed” atom approach, in which the uniﬁed states of the atom with a single 
mode of the EM ﬁeld are considered [20], and the Bloch formalism based on 
Floquet’s theorem [21]. We show that if the atom interacts with a single monochro-
matic mode of light, whether the light is classical or quantized, the transition of an 
atom from one state to another does not occur. Only the endless periodic energy 
exchange between the atom and the ﬁeld is possible in such systems. 
The third chapter is devoted to “open” quantum systems. In particular, we 
consider transitions between stationary states of an atom. We show that these 
transitions are irreversible only if the atom interacts with a reservoir with an inﬁnite 
number of degrees of freedom. Interaction with such a reservoir is a necessary 
condition for the atom’s transition from one state to another. This is illustrated 
with the exact Weisskopf-Wigner descriptions of the spontaneous emission of an 
excited atom [22]. Since it is difﬁcult to deal with a reservoir with many degrees of 
freedom, approximate approaches need to be used. We discuss the two most popular 
approaches. 
First, in the Schrödinger picture, we introduce the density matrix concept and 
obtain the Lindblad equation. Using this approach, we consider Fermi’s golden rule 
for the probability of transitions between atomic levels. 
Second, in the Heisenberg picture, by eliminating the reservoir variables, we 
derive the non-Hermitian Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations. These equations 
contain both dissipative and noise terms but only include the dynamic variables of 
the system (in our case, it is a dressed atom). Therefore, the equations are much 
simpler than the initial Hermitian Heisenberg equations for the system and reservoir 
variables. Using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations allows us to show how an 
excited open quantum system radiates. To describe this phenomenon, ﬁrst, we 
study the relaxation of the systems due to the interaction with the reservoir; then, 
we ﬁnd the spectrum of the system dipole moment oscillations and, ﬁnally, solve the 
Heisenberg equations for the free space modes excited by the dipole moment of the 
system. The perturbation of the reservoir modes is considered as the system’s 
radiation spectrum.

Introduction
In Chap. 4, we discuss the concept of light coherence. To establish a closer 
analogy between quantum and classical theories, we consider the correspondence of 
quantum coherent states of light to coherence of classical EW waves. 
In Chap. 5, we employ the Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations to consider a 
semiclassical description of the Rayleigh scattering. The incident ﬁeld is treated as 
classical in this description, but a scatterer is assumed quantum. This leads to the 
appearance of the off-resonant Mollow triplet. 
Finally, in Chap. 6, using the Lindblad master equation, we study the Rayleigh 
scattering of a quantized ﬁeld for several formulations of the problem. We start with 
an incident mode having only one photon. This case corresponds to the Berestetskii-
Lifshitz-Pitaevskii approach [8]. Then, we focus on the elementary act of scattering 
in which the number of photons in the incident mode changes by unity. Placzek [7] 
was the ﬁrst to state such a problem. Next, using the Jaynes-Cummings model [12], 
we consider the CW scattering of a single mode of a quantized ﬁeld. Finally, we 
study scattering of light in a coherent state.

Chapter 2 
Exactly Solvable Problems of Atom 
Interaction with External Electromagnetic 
Field 
In this chapter, we show that in closed Hermitian systems comprised of a ﬁnite 
number of subsystems, each subsystem cannot be in a stationary state. In particular, 
due to the coupling of an atom with light, the new hybrid states—dressed atom 
states—arise. In these states, neither the energy of the atom nor the energy of the 
photons is conserved separately. In a dressed state, there is continuous energy 
exchange between the atom and the ﬁeld, and no energy escapes from the system. 
We illustrate this behavior through the analysis of two exactly solvable problems for 
forming the dressed atom. These are the interaction of an atom with a single mode of 
a classical EM ﬁeld (the Rabi problem [1]) and of a quantized ﬁeld (the Jaynes-
Cummings problem [2]). 
The dressed atom is the simplest quantum system that adequately describes the 
atom interaction with light. It has become common in quantum optics.

The Schrödinger and Heisenberg Pictures

In this section, we discuss two main approaches describing an atom interaction with 
an EM ﬁeld. The ﬁrst one uses the Schrödinger picture. This is a formulation of 
quantum mechanics in which the dynamics of a closed quantum system can be 
described by a wave function ψ(r, t) obeying the Schrödinger equation:

Remark 2.1 In quantum mechanics, a system is described by a wave function 
ψ(r, t); jψ(r, t)j2 has the meaning of the probability density of the particle to be 
at the point r at the time t. The initial condition ψ(r, 0) belongs to a space of 
normalized, square-integrable functions. An inner product of the wave func-
tions ψ(r, t) and φ(r, t) is deﬁned as

If ^A = ^A 
{ , an operator is referred to as a Hermitian or self-adjoint operator. 
Further, in quantum mechanics, a Hermitian operator is assigned to any 
classical physical quantity such as position, momentum, or energy of a 
particle. 
The full set of the eigenfunctions {ξk (r)} of a Hermitian operator forms the 
basis of the corresponding Hilbert space [3]. The value of a physical quantity 
observed in an experiment is equal to one of the eigenvalues of the 
corresponding operator. The averaged value of the physical quantity observed 
in a set of identical experiments is equal to the expectation value of the 
corresponding Hermitian operator. 
In quantum mechanics, each physical quantity corresponds to a certain quantum 
operator (see Remark 2.1). In particular, the energy of the system corresponds to the

Hamiltonian. In the Schrödinger picture, operators do not depend on time.1 In this 
picture, values of physical quantities measured in experiment are eigenvalues of the 
corresponding operator. If the quantum system is in some state described by the 
wave function ψ(r, t), the average (expectation) value of a physical quantity 
f corresponding to the quantum operator ^F is deﬁned as

The second approach uses the Heisenberg picture, in which the system’s time 
dependency is incorporated into operators. In the Heisenberg picture, expectation 
values are also deﬁned by Eq. (2.1.2), but now the wave functions are time-
independent, while operators depend on time. 
2.1
The Schrödinger and Heisenberg Pictures for Description of Quantum Systems

Using the Heisenberg picture facilitates the physical interpretation of phenomena. 
For example, in classical physics, when considering the radiation of light, we deal 
with the time evolution of a dipole moment. In the Heisenberg picture, we consider 
the time evolution of the operator of the dipole moment (see Remark 2.2). 
Remark 2.2 The Heisenberg quantum mechanical equation for the time-
evolution operator is constructed similarly to the evolution equation for 
classical quantities. In a classical system characterized by the Hamiltonian 
H(x, p, t), the coordinate x and the momentum р are connected via the 
Hamiltonian equations dx/dt = ∂H(x, p, t)/∂p and dp/dt = -∂H(x, p, t)/∂x; 
therefore, for an arbitrary function f(x, p, t), one can obtain time-evolution 
equations by calculating its derivative over time:

quantities to quantum operators, one must replace the Poisson brackets with 
the commutator of respective operators:

After such a replacement, the equations (the Heisenberg equations), which 
govern the time dependence of operators, become similar to the corresponding 
Hamilton equations, which govern the dynamics of classical quantities. More-
over, the dynamics of the expectation values of observable quantities are 
governed by the same equation (the Ehrenfest theorem [4]):

In quantum mechanics, Dirac’s bra-ket notations (see Remark 2.3) are often used to 
describe the system’s states. Below, we often employ these notations. 
Remark 2.3 Dirac’s bra-ket vectors. At the beginning of Sect. 2.1, we  
introduced the Hilbert space in which all wave functions are determined. As 
a basis of this Hilbert space, we can use a set {ξk(r)} of eigenfunctions of any 
Hermitian operator. Therefore, any wave function ψ(t, r) belonging to this 
Hilbert space can be represented as a linear combination of {ξk(r)}: 
ψ t, r
ð
Þ =
ψk tð Þξk rð Þ: 
The complex functions ψk are called probability amplitudes because P = ψkψ*
k 
is the probability of ﬁnding the system in the state described by the function 
ξk(r). 
Dirac introduced convenient notations for describing a quantum system— 
bra-ket vectors [5]. A column ket vector jψ(t)i has components ψk(t), while a 
row bra vector hψj is deﬁned as ^T ψ
j i*, where ^T is the transposition operator. 
The scalar product of the bra and ket vectors is deﬁned as 
φ tð Þ

One should distinguish the scalar product hφ(t)jψ(t)i from the tensor product 
jψ(t)ihφ(t)j, which is a direct product of ket and bra vectors and comprises a 
matrix whose dimension equals N × N, where N is the dimension of the Hilbert

Hamiltonian of a Two-Level System 
In this section, we consider the interaction of an atom modeled by a TLS and a 
classical monochromatic EM wave having the frequency ωext. 
The functional space of TLS wave functions is two-dimensional. We can choose 
the excited jei and the ground jgi eigenstates as basis ket vectors. In the matrix form, 
jei and jgi can be represented as 
ej i = 
1 
0 
and
gj i = 
0

ð2:2:1Þ 
Then, the wave function of the TLS can be written as 
ψ tð Þ = ψ tð Þ
j
i = ce tð Þ  ej i þ cg tð Þ  gj i:
ð2:2:2Þ 
where ce(t) and  cg(t) are amplitudes of the probabilities. It is often convenient to 
represent jψ(t)i as a column vector: 
ψ tð Þ
j
i = 
ce tð Þ  
cg tð Þ  : 
Similarly, there are wave functions hψj, which are the Hermitian conjugates for the 
functions jψ(t)i (see Remark 2.3). These Hermitian conjugate wave functions can be 
written as

are the bra vectors, which form a basis for the TLS wave functions hψj.

Hamiltonian of a Two-Level System

In the Schrödinger picture, the operators corresponding to physical quantities are 
time-independent. Any linear operator acting on the TLS wave function can be 
represented as a 2 × 2-matrix of c-numbers, which can be decomposed into a linear 
combination of the Pauli matrices: 
^σ1 =

and the unit matrix ^I =

 . Often, instead of matrices ^σ1 and ^σ2, it is more 
convenient to use their linear combinations, which, together with the identity 
operator, form a basis for operators

ð2:2:4Þ 
Note that in the literature on quantum mechanics, the notations ^σ3 or ^σz are usually 
used instead of the notation ^D, while in the literature on laser physics, we encounter 
the notation ^D. In the basis of states {jei, jgi}, the operators ^σ{ , ^σ, and ^D can be 
represented as 
^σ{ = ej i  g
h j, ^σ = gj i  e
h j, 
^D = ej i  e
h j - gj i  g
h j, I = ej i  e
h j þ gj i  g
h j:
ð2:2:5Þ 
From these equations, it follows that ^σ{ gj i = ej i  and ^σ ej i = gj i. It implies that the 
operator ^σ{ increases and the operator ^σ decreases the number of excitations of the 
TLS by one, respectively. Therefore, these operators are often referred to as raising 
and lowering operators of a TLS. Comparing Eqs. (2.2.4) and (2.2.5), one can see 
that the set of operators 
ej i  e
h j, gj i  g
h j, gj i  e
h j, ej i  g

ð2:2:6Þ 
forms a basis for operators in the TLS Hilbert space. Operators (2.2.6) are called 
transition operators. 
Due to the orthogonality of jei and jgi, we have: 
^σ^σ = ^σ{ ^σ{ = 0:

checked by using deﬁnition (2.2.4) of the matrices ^σ and ^σ{ .

Operators (2.2.4) satisfy the commutation relations of the Pauli matrices: 
^σ{ , ^σ = ^D,
^σ{ , ^D = - 2^σ{ , 
^σ, ^D = 2^σ
ð2:2:8Þ 
where square brackets denote a commutator ( ^A, ^B = ^A^B - ^B^A). 
Wave functions jgi and jei satisfy Schrödinger equations ^HTLS gj i = Eg gj i  and 
^HTLS ej i = Ee ej i, where  Eg and Ee are energies of the TLS ground and excited 
eigenstates, respectively. Using vectors (2.2.1), one can see that in the  basis {jgi,jei}, 
the matrix of ^HTLS has a diagonal form:

The Hamiltonian of the Two-Level System Interaction 
with External Electromagnetic Field 
In 1788, Lagrange formulated classical mechanics based on the stationary-action 
principle δS = 0. The action S = 
t2 
t1 Ldt was deﬁned through the Lagrangian L = K -
U, where K and U are the kinetic and potential energies of the system. In 1833, 
Hamilton reformulated classical mechanics in terms of the total energy of the system. 
He introduced the Hamiltonian, H = K + U, which depends on canonical variables— 
momenta and generalized coordinates. 
EM ﬁelds can be described either by four-dimensional tensors or by a single four-
dimensional vector comprised of scalar and vector potentials. The latter description 
is more convenient for forming scalars that could be used to build either Lagrangian 
or Hamiltonian. The term that describes the interaction between a charged particle 
and an EM ﬁeld can be written as a scalar product of the four-dimensional vector 
comprised of the EM potentials with the four-dimensional vector of the current 
density of the charged particle [6]. Historically, Hamiltonian mechanics served as a 
link between classical and quantum mechanics. 
To obtain the quantum Hamiltonian of a charged particle interacting with an EM 
ﬁeld, following Bohr’s correspondence principle, we replace the physical quantities 
with the corresponding operators: 
^H = 1 
2m ^p - e

where ^p = - iħ∇is the operator of the momentum, the operator ^V is the potential of 
a static force, e.g., the Coulomb force, ^ϕ and ^A are scalar and vector potentials of the 
EM ﬁeld, and e is a particle charge. 
Below, subscripts in the EM operators indicate their gauges. 
Remark 2.4 Gauge transformation of EM ﬁelds. The operators of the 
vector-potential ^A and the scalar-potential ^ϕ do not correspond to any 
measurable quantities because they are deﬁned up to the gauge transformation 
with any Hermitian operator ^f :

The gauge transformation changes Hamiltonian (2.3.1) (see Remark 2.4) because 
new terms that explicitly depend on the gauge operators appear. Consequently, the 
Schrödinger equation also changes. However, after such a Hamiltonian transforma-
tion, the new wave function should still correspond to the state physically equivalent 
to the one described by the unchanged Hamiltonian. In particular, the probability 
density P(r, t) = ψ(r, t)ψ*(r, t) = jψ(r, t)j2 must remain unaffected. Thus, the abso-
lute value of the wave function also should not change. The latter implies that the 
gauge transformation may only change the wave function phase so that the 
transformed wave function is obtained by multiplying the initial wave function by 
a factor exp i^χ r, t

Our next step is ﬁnding the transformation in which the local interaction Hamilto-
nian is written in the gauge-invariant form, - ^d . ^E [8]. Such a gauge means that we 
deal with a dipole approximation, assuming that at the atomic scale, the electric ﬁeld 
varies in space slowly (ωra/c ≪ 1), where ra is a Bohr radius; we also take into 
account that at distances comparable to ra, we can neglect retardation and consider 
the optical EM ﬁelds as quasistatic.

performs such a transition we denote as ^f dE

where in the last step, we use that in the dipole approximation E(r1, t) ≃ E(r0, t) and

Now, in product (2.3.11), one can change the order of the factors and treat operators 
as c-functions. 
The size of an atom rat is much smaller than the optical wavelength λ. Therefore, 
for the interaction Hamiltonian of the TLS with an external ﬁeld, in the leading order 
of the small parameter rat/λ, we can use the dipole approximation ^Hint = - ^E . ^d 
(details of the derivation can be found in Ref. [3]), where ^d is the TLS dipole 
moment 
operator. 
The 
parity 
of 
the 
states 
jei 
and 
jgi 
warrants 
that 
deg = hejdjgi = hgjdjei = dge, while dee = dgg = 0. Thus, the matrix for the dipole 
moment operator is off-diagonal and symmetric. Using matrices (2.2.4), we can 
express this operator as 
^d = deg^σ{ þ dge^σ 
or
^d = deg ^σ þ ^σ{
ð2:3:23Þ 
To summarize, in the dipole approximation, the interaction Hamiltonian of 
the TLS with an external classical ﬁeld of the frequency ωext (Eext(exp(-
iωextt) + exp (iωextt))/2) is

2.4 
The Rabi Cycle in the Heisenberg Picture 
In classical mechanics, it is impossible to create two identical objects, while in the 
quantum world, it is commonplace. All electrons and protons are identical among 
themselves. This is possible only if the parameters that determine a micro-object 
have discrete values. In particular, two unexcited hydrogen atoms are identical, just 
as two excited to the same levels. Consequently, the frequencies characterizing 
transitions between ground and excited states of identical atoms are also identical. 
According to this, it may seem that quantum mechanics is doomed to only study 
transitions between discrete states. However, Rabi showed that the population of the 
excited state of the TLS, under the action of an external monochromatic ﬁeld, can 
perform smooth oscillations. The solution to this problem in the Schrödinger picture 
can be found in many textbooks on quantum mechanics (see also Problem 1.1). 
Below, for pedagogical purposes, we present the solution to this problem in the 
Heisenberg picture. 
The transition from the Schrödinger picture to the Heisenberg picture can be done 
by applying unitary transformation (2.1.4). It is important that the evolution operator 
U(t, t0) commutes with the Hamiltonian. It means that Hamiltonians are the same in

]

the Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures. We illustrate this by considering the 
reduced Hamiltonian describing the TLS interaction with the classical ﬁeld.

Recall that ^d = deg ^σ þ ^σ{ . In what follows, we assume that the dipole polari-
zation of the atom is of spherical symmetry. Then, the polarization direction is the

Operators ^σ{ and ^σ change under transformation (2.1.6). In the Heisenberg picture, 
these operators depend on time, and their dynamics is determined by Heisenberg 
equation (2.1.7). Unlike the Schrödinger picture, in the Heisenberg picture, these 
operators evolve with time; therefore, in both pictures, they are identical in the initial 
moment only. So, in the Heisenberg picture, the operators ^σ{ 
H tð Þ  and ^σH tð Þ  do not 
have the form of Eq. (2.2.4) in an arbitrary moment of time. However, any linear 
operator can still be presented as a linear combination of the operators 
^σH, ^σ{ 
H ^DH,^I . 
Now, we discuss the TLS interaction with the classical ﬁeld within the framework 
of the Heisenberg picture. This discussion is mainly instructional. 
The Hamiltonian of a TLS interacting with an external classical ﬁeld is equal to 
the sum of Hamiltonians (2.2.11) and (2.3.24); therefore, the Heisenberg equations 
take the form (see Problem 1.2):

Further, throughout the book, we use the rotating wave approximation, in which 
the terms proportional to exp(±2iωextt) are neglected. This approximation is justiﬁed 
when jωext - ωσj ≪ ωext, ωσ and Ωext ≪ ωσ. When the latter inequality is satisﬁed, in 
Eqs. (2.4.6)–(2.4.8), the terms proportional to exp(±2iωextt) are fast-oscillating 
compared to all other terms. It can be shown [9, 10] that these terms give

contribution to the solution of Eqs. (2.3.30)–(2.3.32) that is of the order (Ω/ωσ)2 (the 
so-called Bloch-Siegert shift) compared to the contribution to the solution coming 
from non-oscillating terms. When jωext - ωσj ≪ ωext, ωσ and Ωext ≪ ωσ, this shift 
can be neglected. Neglecting the terms proportional to exp(±2iωextt) results in the 
following equations:

(2.4.8) is equivalent to neglecting the terms proportional to ^σH exp - iωextt

As we mentioned in the introduction, Rabi analytically showed that for Δ = 0, a 
single monochromatic mode of a classical EM ﬁeld cannot irreversibly excite an 
atom. Instead of the atomic transition to the excited state, the atom state oscillates 
between ground and excited states with the doubled Rabi frequency. During this 
process, the amplitude of the classical EM wave is assumed to be unchanged. 
Tracing the energy exchange between the atom and the ﬁeld is difﬁcult. The atomic 
energy is not conserved during the Rabi cycle. This is not surprising because 
Hamiltonian (2.4.12) depends on time.

For nonzero detuning Δω ≠ 0, system (2.4.9)–(2.4.11) can also be solved. The

Now, we have to ﬁnd the expectation values of these operators. Since, in the

Equations (2.4.16)–(2.4.18) show that the solutions for the expectation values of the 
operators ^σH tð  Þ, ^σ{ 
H tð  Þ, and ^DH tð  Þ  have no stationary states. The time evolution of a 
TLS placed in the external classical ﬁeld is reduced to the driven oscillation on the 
frequency of the external ﬁeld, which is modulated with the frequency 2Ωext. These 
solutions describe the Rabi oscillations of the population inversion with the fre-
quency 2ΩΔ.

It is worth emphasizing that the problem of the atom interaction with a single EM 
mode is considered by using the Hermitian Hamiltonian while radiation losses are 
disregarded. The radiation processes in this formulation cannot be considered 
because this would require expanding the system by adding the reservoir of emitted 
photons, which does not belong to the primary Hermitian system. Therefore, as a 
result, we obtained only the periodic time evolution of the Hermitian system. 
To conclude, in a closed system of a single incident mode of the classical EM 
ﬁeld and an atom, neither an excitation of an atom due to the absorption of a photon 
nor its relaxation with photon emission can be described correctly. In other words, a 
single mode of an external ﬁeld cannot cause atomic transitions from one stationary 
state to another, as studied in spectroscopy. The spectroscopy approach implies a 
hidden assumption about the system’s interaction with a reservoir of emitted pho-
tons. In particular, the concept of the stationary state lifetime can be introduced 
phenomenologically.

The Interaction of a Two-Level System with a Single 
Mode of Quantized Field (The Jaynes-Cummings 
Approach) 
2.5.1 
Quantization of Electromagnetic Fields 
In the previous section, we discussed a TLS interaction with a single mode of a 
classical EM ﬁeld. According to Planck’s theory, the radiation energy should be 
quantized; after the quantization, the problem becomes more complicated. However, 
the main conclusion does not change: the TLS and the incident ﬁeld evolve period-
ically, forming a uniﬁed Hermitian system [2, 14, 15].

where the last equation is a periodic condition for functions um(r). The length L is 
the size of the quantization box.

eigenfunctions um is complete, and they can be made orthogonal with respect to 
the scalar product: 
V 
um0 . u*mdV = Vδmm0:
ð2:5:8Þ 
Substituting series (2.5.6) into Eq. (2.5.5) and employing Eq. (2.5.8), we can show 
that each mode amplitude Em(t) satisﬁes the following equations:

Equation (2.5.7) imposes the following restrictions on the values of km:

kmzL = 2πnz: 
ð2:5:11Þ 
Here nx, ny, and nz are integers satisfying condition (2.5.10). In the k-space, the 
allowed values of the wave vectors form a grid with the spacing of (2π/L), and each 
k-state occupies the volume (2π/L)3 . At the end of the calculations, we have to take 
the limit L →1, after which the vector km can point in any direction. 
Similarly, for magnetic induction B, we can obtain: 
B = 
m k - 1 
m Bm tð Þwm,
ð2:5:12Þ 
where wm satisﬁes Eq. (2.5.7). To determine wm, we substitute Eqs. (2.5.6) and

m Em tð Þ∇× um r

Thus, we can use wm = (km)-1 ∇ × um, because these functions satisfy Eq. (2.5.7).

Usually, the ﬁeld quantization is performed by analogy with the quantization

In accordance with the quantization method [3] (see also Remark 2.2), operators 
^Qm and ^Pm should have the commutation relation: 
^Qm, ^Pm = iħ
ð2:5:21Þ 
For the quantum harmonic oscillator, we can introduce the creation ^a{ and annihi-

are ωmn = ωm(n + 1/2), n = 0, 1, 2, . . .  with corresponding eigenstates jni, which are 
called Fock states [12] (see Problem 1.4). The number n, which determines the 
energy of the eigenstate, is interpreted as a number of quanta ħωa contained in the 
eigenstate jni. 
The operator ^a acting on the state with n quanta, jni, transitions this state to the 
state jn - 1i with n - 1 quanta; for this reason, it is called the annihilation 
(or lowering) operator; the operator ^a{ moves the state jni with n quanta to the 
state jn + 1i with n + 1 quanta and is called the creation (or rising) operator. 
Mathematically, this can be represented as (Problem 1.4):

The zero level of energy can be set arbitrarily. This is because for any operator ^A, the 
Heisenberg equation of motion is determined by the commutator of the operator with 
the Hamiltonian. The commutator is not changed if we add a constant to the 
Hamiltonian (the identity operator ^I commutes with any operator). For future 
consideration, we subtract ^Iħωa=2 from ^H = ħωa ^a{ ^a þ ^I=2 
turning it into the 
Hamiltonian becomes ^H = ħωa^a{ ^a. The ground state of the harmonic oscillator 
corresponding to the latter Hamiltonian has zero energy.

Eigenfunctions of the Jaynes-Cummings Problem 
In Sect. 2.4 we have considered the Rabi oscillation of excitations of an atom placed 
in a classical monochromatic ﬁeld. Since the classical plane wave has inﬁnite energy, 
it is impossible to correctly describe the energy exchange between the atom and the

Þ
ﬁeld. Therefore, in this section, we consider the behavior of an atom placed in the 
ﬁeld of a quantized mode.

Exactly Solvable Problems of Atom Interaction. . .
As before, we model an atom interacting with a quantized external ﬁeld by the 
TLS with the transition frequency ωσ. Thus, the TLS Hamiltonian, ^HTLS, is equal to 
ħωσ^σ{ ^σ (see Eq. (2.2.11)). We focus on the problem in which the TLS is placed in a 
resonator, and only one resonator mode is in resonance with the atomic transition 
while other modes are off-resonant. Thus, we conﬁne ourselves to considering only 
one resonator mode, which has the frequency ωa. The Hamiltonian of the resonant 
mode, which we consider as a quantum oscillator, is 
^HE = ħωa^a{ ^a
ð2:5:27Þ 
The Hamiltonian of the interaction between the TLS and the mode is written in the 
dipole approximation ^Hint = - ^d . ^E. As in the previous section, the operator of the 
dipole moment can be expressed via the transition operators between ground and 
excited states, ^d = deg ^σ{ þ ^σ . The operator of the electric ﬁeld mode ^E can be 
expressed as ^E = E0 ^a{ þ ^a , where E0 is the electric ﬁeld “per one photon” (see 
Eq. (2.5.25) and Remark 2.4). In what follows, we assume that the atom is isotropic 
and that the induced dipole moment is parallel to the external ﬁeld. This allows us to 
transition from vectors to scalars, deg . E0 = degE0. Thus, the interaction Hamiltonian 
has the form: 
^Hint = - ^d . ^E = ħΩa ^a þ ^a{

with 
Ωa = - deg

Note that for quantized ﬁelds, the constant Ωa plays the role of the interaction 
constant of the atom (TLS) with the mode characterized by the frequency ωa. 
In the absence of the interaction (Ωa = 0), eigenstates of Hamiltonian (2.5.29) are 
the direct products of the eigenstates of an isolated atom and a mode containing 
n photons jg, ni ≡jgijni and je, ni ≡jeijni, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . The eigenvalues 
corresponding to these eigenstates are the sums of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of 
the isolated atom and the Hamiltonian of the mode, i.e., nħωa for the state jg, ni and 
ħωσ + nħωa for the state je, ni. Moreover, these eigenstates are also eigenstates of the 
operator of the total number of excitations in the system, ^N = ^a{ ^a þ ^σ{ ^σ, namely,

Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (2.5.29) commute with the operator ^N = ^a ^a þ ^σ ^σ 
(see Problem 1.5). It means that these operators share the eigenstates. Although the 
states je, ni ≡jeijni and jg, ni ≡jgijni are eigenstates of the operator ^N = ^a{ ^a þ ^σ{ ^σ, 
these are not eigenstates of the interaction operator ħΩa ^σ{ ^a þ ^σ^a{ 
and, conse-
quently, of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. Below, we ﬁnd the true eigenstates. 
The structure of the interaction operator prompts us that the states je,ni ≡jeijn - 1i 
and jg,ni ≡jgijni have the same number of excitations. Moreover, the interaction 
Hamiltonian transforms the je, n - 1i state into the jg,ni state: 
ħΩa ^σ{ ^a þ ^σ^a{ e, n - 1

ð2:5:31Þ 
Thus, under the action of the interaction operator, the number of photons in the mode 
increases or decreases by one, respectively, while the number of the atom excitations 
changes in the opposite way. Thus, although the interaction Hamiltonian changes the 
number of excitations in the atomic and/or photon subsystems, the total number of 
excitations is conserved. 
For ﬁxed n, the normalized linear combinations of the vectors je, n - 1i and jg, ni 
determine the two-dimensional Hilbert subspace spanned on these vectors. Thus, the 
Hilbert space of the wave functions of Hamiltonian (2.5.29) becomes the sum 
of such subspaces. The matrices of both the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian 
and the operator ^N = ^a{ ^a þ ^σ{ ^σ become block-diagonal. In particular, in the basis

According to these equations, the energies form the equidistant pairs {ħω+, n, ħω-, n}, 
with the energy difference between the states inside the pair equals to ħΔa = ħωσ - ħωa, 
while the energy difference between pairs (ħω+, n - ħω+, n - 1 = ħω-, n - ħω-, n - 1) 
is equal to ħωa. Thus, if  ħωa > ħωσ - ħωa, the energy ħω-, n is higher than the energy 
ħω+, n - 1.

The Bloch Vector Formalism Based on Floquet’s Theorem
37
To conclude, since Jaynes-Cummings states (2.5.34) and (2.5.36) are the system 
eigenstates, if, initially, the system was in one of these states, it would remain in the 
same state. Thus, the Jaynes-Cummings description of an atom interacting with a 
single-mode quantum EM ﬁeld conﬁrms the conclusion of the previous section that 
in such a closed system, electronic transitions between the Jaynes-Cummings 
eigenstates cannot occur. 
2.6 
The Bloch Vector Formalism Based on Floquet’s 
Theorem 
In the previous section, we have found the eigenstates of the time-dependent 
Hamiltonian in which the interaction term depends on time harmonically. Now, 
we consider a general approach to this problem. 
To describe the evolution of a system whose Hamiltonian depends on time 
periodically, the Bloch vector formalism has been developed in Refs. [10, 14, 16, 
17]. This approach is based on Floquet’s theorem [18] (see Remark 2.5 for detail); it 
is analogous to the approach used in solid-state crystals, in which Bloch vectors 
describe the motion of electrons in a periodic lattice. In this section, we illustrate this 
formalism by considering the Rabi oscillations of a TLS. In this simple case, Bloch 
and Rabi frequencies coincide. 
Remark 2.5 Floquet’s theorem. According to Floquet’s theorem, for a 
system of M equations dx/dt = A(t)x, where A(t) is an  M × N matrix that 
depends on time periodically with the period T, a general solution can be 
expanded over the full set of N Floquet’s functions { exp - iωα 
Ft Φα tð Þ
j
i}, 
where ωα 
F (α = 1, . . ., N) do not depend on time. These quantities are called 
quasi-energies (or quasi-frequencies, or Floquet’s frequencies); the state vec-
tors jΦα(t)i = jΦα(t + T)i periodically depend on time. 
Let us describe a TLS by the unperturbed Hamiltonian ^HTLS (Eq. (2.2.11)). We 
assume that time-dependent Schrödinger wave functions of excited and ground 
states ψSchr 
k 
= exp - iEkt=ħ
ð
Þ
 
ψk
j
 i
 are known (here, jψ1i = jgi and jψ2i = jei are 
wave functions of ground and excited states, respectively). Since ^HTLS is time-
independent, its eigenfunctions also do not depend on time. Thus,

ð
^HTLS ψk
j
i = Ek ψk
j
i:
ð2:6:1Þ 
We assume that the TLS is under the periodic perturbation ^V tð Þ = ^V t þ T
ð
Þ
 
of a 
classical EM ﬁeld. In particular, this perturbation may be harmonic with the period 
T and the frequency ωext = 2π/T. Then, the Hamiltonian of the system is 
^HdTLS = ^HTLS þ ^V tð Þ: 
We also assume that ^V tð Þ  is deﬁned by external conditions that are not affected by 
the system states. 
38

Exactly Solvable Problems of Atom Interaction. . .
We expand the wave function jψ(t)i of the Hamiltonian ^HdTLS over the basis jψki 
of the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian ^HTLS:

k = 1

ð2:6:2Þ 
where the subscript k = 1 corresponds to the ground state jgi and k = 2 corresponds 
to the excited state jei. 
Now, let us substitute expansion (2.6.2) into the Schrödinger equation and scalar 
multiply the obtained equation by hψkj. As a result, we obtain a system of two linear 
differential equations for the functions ck(t):

where Vkl ψkj^Vjψl . The coefﬁcients of this system periodically depend on time. 
According to Floquet’s theorem, the solution of this system is a superposition of 
Floquet’s functions that can be represented as 
cF tð Þ = f tð Þ exp - iωFt
ð
Þ,
ð2:6:4Þ 
where 
cF tð Þ =

f tð Þ =

f 2 tð Þ  = f t þ T
ð
Þ

is a vector function that depends on time with the same period as the operator ^V tð Þ; 
ωF is yet unknown frequency, called Floquet’s frequency. As it follows from the 
general theory [19], ωF is deﬁned with the accuracy up to an additive nωext, which 
does not affect cF(t) but replaces the periodic part f(t) with f(t) exp (inωextt). In other 
words, the frequencies ωF + nωext and ωF correspond to the same Floquet’s function. 
When the atom is modeled by a TLS, the number of Floquet’s frequencies is two.

Exactly Solvable Problems of Atom Interaction. . .
To conclude, in this section we have illustrated that an atom interacting with a 
single classical EM mode forms a dressed atom—the closed Hermitian system with 
stationary states. If the atom interacts with a classical external ﬁeld, the system state 
may be described as the Rabi oscillations of the population inversion. When an EM 
mode is quantized, the atom and the mode perform an endless periodic exchange of 
energy quanta (the Jaynes-Cummings states). For several modes, we observe a more 
complicated collapse-revival motion. In any case, the transition of an atom from one 
stationary state to another does not occur. This is the general property of closed 
Hermitian systems.

Open Quantum Systems 
In this chapter, we show that to achieve a stationary state, a quantum system must 
interact with a reservoir of a continuum of modes. Dirac was the ﬁrst to put forward 
this idea, which Fermi later used to derive a formula describing the probability of 
beta decay [1, 2]. This formula is known as Fermi’s golden rule and is widely used in 
describing various quantum transitions. Since Fermi’s golden rule results from using 
the ﬁrst order of time-dependent perturbation theory, in speciﬁc cases, its application 
implies inevitable limitations, which are not always obvious and may lead to 
seeming contradictions to more detailed theories. Below, we clarify these 
limitations. 
We begin with the Weisskopf-Wigner theory [3] of spontaneous emission, which 
shows that the interaction with a continuum of modes instead of a single mode 
prevents the endless periodic energy exchange. We will see that an excited atom 
interacting with empty reservoir of free space modes transitions irreversibly to the 
ﬁnal state (the atom is in the ground state, and the reservoir of free space modes has 
one photon). The Weisskopf-Wigner theory predicts the dissipation rate in the initial 
moment and the frequency shift of the emitted radiation. 
To consider the dynamics at larger times, we have to solve an inﬁnite number of 
differential equations, which cannot be done without approximations. As mentioned 
in the Introduction, at large times, there are two ways to avoid dealing with an 
inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. These are using the Lindblad master equation 
and the Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations. These methods are outlined in this 
chapter. 
At the end of the chapter, we show that the light emission of a quantum system is 
caused by the interaction with the reservoir of free space modes, and the spectrum of 
this radiation is associated with the perturbation of the reservoir.

3.1 
Spontaneous Radiation of a Two-Level System: 
Weisskopf-Wigner Approach 
To consider spontaneous radiation, we follow the Weisskopf-Wigner approach. The 
approach assumes that a TLS interacts with the reservoir of free space modes. 
Moreover, the TLS and the reservoir form a closed Hermitian system with the 
Hamiltonian: 
^H = ħωσ^σþ^σ þ 
k 
ħωa,k^aþ 
k ^ak þ 
k 
ħΩa,k ^aþ 
k ^σ þ ^ak^σþ :
ð3:1:1Þ 
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (3.1.1) represents the TLS Hamiltonian (2.2.11). The second 
term is the Hamiltonian of the quantized free space modes, which have 
eigenfrequencies ωa, k: 
^HE = 
k 
ħωa,k^aþ 
k ^ak,
ð3:1:2Þ 
and the third term is responsible for the interaction of these modes with the TLS: 
k 
ħΩa,k ^aþ 
k ^σ þ ^ak^σþ
ð3:1:3Þ 
Ωa,k = 
2πωa,k=ħV ek,α . deg is the coupling constant of the atom located in the 
point r0 with the photon mode, which has the eigenfrequency ωa, k and the wave 
vector k, where jkj = ωa, k/c. 
Let us assume that at the initial moment, t = 0, the TLS is in the excited state 
je, 0i, and there are no photons in the free space. Then, at subsequent moments of 
time, the wave function |Ψ(t)i of the system, which includes the TLS and photons in 
free space modes, can be represented in the form: 
Ψ tð Þ
j
i = Ce tð Þe - iωσt e, 0
j
i þ 
k 
Cg,k tð Þe - iωa,kt g, 1k

ð3:1:4Þ 
where Ce(0) = 1, Cg, k(0) = 0, and jg, 1ki is the system state in which the TLS is in 
the ground state, while there is one photon with the wave vector k in free space. 
Our goal is to ﬁnd the states of the TLS and the photon after a certain time t when 
the TLS emits a photon. Substituting Eqs. (3.1.1) and  (3.1.4) into the Schrödinger 
equation and scalar multiplying by h0, ej and h1k, gj, we obtain the equations of 
motion for the probability amplitudes Ce(t) and Cg, k(t):

To eliminate the variables Cg, k(t) from Eq. (3.1.5), we integrate Eq. (3.1.6) over time

Thus, we replace inﬁnite system of differential eqs. (3.1.5)–(3.1.6) with single 
integro-differential eq. (3.1.9) from which all the variables Cg, k(t) are excluded. 
Equation (3.1.9) for Ce(t) is still exact; it cannot be solved analytically. To obtain a 
solution to this equation, we use the Markov approximation, which allows for the 
substitution of Ce(t - τ) by  Ce(t) in Eq. (3.1.9). Then, Eq. (3.1.9) reduces to a simpler 
equation:

Consequently, the probability of an atom being in the excited state, Pe(t) = jCe(t)|2 ,

To evaluate the values γ(rad) and Δω-1 from Eq. (3.1.17), we need to calculate the 
coupling constants Ωa, k of the interaction of an atomic dipole moment with the

(3.1.19). This leads us to the following expression (see Problem 1.6):

This is the Lamb shift of the TLS transition frequency (the frequency of the center of 
the emission line). In Eq. (3.1.25), the integral diverges. This divergence arises due 
to the inapplicability of the nonrelativistic Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian at high 
frequencies when the photons emitted by TLS can produce virtual electron-positron 
pairs with the energy ħωa, k ≈ 2mc2 , where m is the mass of the electron. (This 
process is often called “knocking out from the vacuum.”) An accurate calculation of

the Lamb shift can only be carried out by using methods of quantum electrodynam-
ics that allow for taking relativistic and radiation corrections into account [5]. Nev-
ertheless, an estimation for Δω could be obtained by cutting off the integral in 
Eq. (3.1.25) at the frequency ωa, k ≈ ħ-1 2mc2 . The resulting expression,

differs from the prediction of quantum electrodynamics by a numerical factor only 
(see Problem 1.6). The Lamb shift lies in the microwave range, Δω ~ γ(rad) ≪ ωσ. 
This justiﬁes the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. 
Thus, the probability of ﬁnding a TLS in an excited state decreases exponentially:

with the characteristic lifetime τ = 1/γ(rad) . Equation (3.1.27) shows that the initial 
excitation dissipates into the reservoir of free space modes. In accordance with the 
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, the presence of dissipation requires that, along with 
dissipation, a noise term is introduced into eqs. [6]. To obtain such a term, much 
more complicated calculations are required. These calculations are discussed in 
Sect. 3.2. 
To summarize, in this section, we have shown that the presence of a continuum of 
reservoir modes with a given energy and all possible directions of wave vectors is a 
sufﬁcient condition for the irreversibility of the transition of an atom from an excited 
state to a ground state. The summation of the feedback of the continuum of modes 
shows the decay of the excited atom state (see Eq. (3.1.14)). The integral in this 
equation has a real part, which is responsible for the irreversible relaxation. 
It is generally recognized that if a reservoir has a Hamiltonian with a discrete 
spectrum, the population of the excited level of a TLS is quasi-periodic in time [7] 
and does not have a limit as t →1. However, if the Hamiltonian spectrum contains 
continuum parts, the population of the excited level can tend to a limit state. 
In Refs. [8–10], by using a simple model, it was also shown that in systems with 
discrete spectra, the complicated quasiperiodic oscillations start after a characteristic 
time τH. Before this time, the system exhibits overdamped oscillations and quasi-
exponential decay of excitation. The time τH increases as the spectrum becomes 
denser. When continuum regions appear in the energy spectrum, the evolution 
operator becomes non-unitary and τH tends to inﬁnity. In this sense, the motion of 
such systems can be termed “irreversible.” Thus, for a transition of an atom from one 
state to another with loss or absorption of a quantum of energy to be irreversible, the 
ﬁnal state should belong to a reservoir with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. 
Generally, one cannot solve an inﬁnite number of Heisenberg or Schrödinger 
equations, which include all reservoir variables. Therefore, to describe the systems, 
we should obtain new equations, which only include essential variables belonging to 
the atom and incident photons. Such a subsystem is called open.

52

Open Quantum Systems
For this purpose, we should eliminate the reservoir variables from the complete 
set of the Heisenberg or Schrödinger equations. The resulting equations differ from 
the Heisenberg and Schrödinger equations. In particular, as shown below, such 
equations are not Hermitian and contain dissipation and noise terms. The latter 
terms reﬂect the coupling of the open system with the reservoir. We show that 
eliminating the reservoir variables can be achieved when the Markov and Born 
approximations are applicable. 
3.2 
Application of the Lindblad Equation for Radiation 
Problem 
In the previous section, we showed that spontaneous emission is possible if a TLS 
interacts with an inﬁnite reservoir of free space modes. We also mentioned two 
methods to deal with a system interacting with a reservoir with an inﬁnite number of 
degrees of freedom—the method of Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations in the 
Heisenberg picture and the Lindblad equation in the Schrödinger picture. 
Although the derivation of the Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations is rather 
transparent, the solution of the equations and interpretations of the results may 
require substantial effort because we should transition from operators to c-numbers, 
i.e., to expectation values of operators. In this sense, the Schrödinger picture is 
preferable. 
In the next subsections, we discuss a practical approach to dealing with an open 
system that employs the Schrödinger picture. 
3.2.1 
The Density Matrix: von Neumann Equation 
Suppose we can divide the total system into two subsystems—a small subsystem 
(an open system) and a large subsystem (a reservoir). We denote the set of coordi-
nates of the small subsystem by x and the set of coordinates of the reservoir by q. In  
the Schrödinger picture, information about all properties of a closed Hermitian 
system is contained in the wave function Ψ(x, q). We are interested in some physical 
quantity f of the open system. The quantum operator ^f x, which corresponds to f, acts 
on the variables x only. 
The expectation value ^f x 
can be found by the usual formula for total closed 
systems:

^f x = 
dq

ð
Þ,
ð3:2:2Þ 
which depends on the coordinates of the small subsystem but also contains infor-
mation about the reservoir. We show that knowing ρ(x, x' ), we can calculate the 
expectation values of any physical property f of a small subsystem. 
3.2

ð3:2:3Þ 
Certainly, ^f x 
depends on the state of the reservoir. This is why we call the small 
subsystem open. 
If the subsystem and the reservoir do not interact, the wave function Ψ(q, x) of the 
total system is the product ΨOS(x)ΨR(q), and the density matrix is reduced to

subsection.

3.2.2 
Derivation of the Lindblad Equation for the Density 
Matrix of an Open System 
Now, we return to our problem in which a closed system is separated into the open 
system S and the reservoir R. The Hamiltonianofthe closedsystem H = HS + HR + HSR 
consists of the Hamiltonians HS, HR, and HSR describing the open system, the 
reservoir, and the interaction of the subsystems, respectively. 
We analyze the evolution of the open system S by using its density matrix ρS. To  
ﬁnd ρS, we need to average the density matrix of the closed system over the reservoir 
states ^ρS tð Þ = TrR ^ρ tð Þ
ð
Þ. The matrix ^ρS tð Þ depends on the system degrees of freedom 
only. Then, the expectation value of any operator ^FS, which acts on S only, is simply 
expressed as 
^FS = TrS ^ρS ^FS . However, due to the interaction of the system 
S with the reservoir, the density matrix ^ρS tð Þ = TrR ^ρ tð Þ

Þ
 
is not governed by the 
von Neumann equation in which only the system Hamiltonian is taken into account: 
∂^ρS 
∂t = - 1 
iħ HS, ρS
½
]: 
Our task is to derive the equation of motion for ^ρS tð Þ, which is usually referred to as 
the Lindblad equation. 
If the quantum system S is closed, its dynamics is described by the Schrödinger 
equation. When the system interacts with an environment, e.g., with the reservoir R, 
the system becomes a subsystem of the closed system that includes the reservoir. The 
ab initio approach for calculating the dynamics of the system S has to use the 
solution to the Schrödinger equation for the whole closed system averaged over 
the reservoir variables. In practice, such an approach often cannot be realized 
because the number of degrees of freedom of the reservoir is typically very large. 
Hence, the question arises as to whether it is possible to construct a closed equation 
that would only describe the system S dynamics. This can be done in the Born-
Markov approximation (see Remark 3.1 and Refs. [11–13]). Below, using the 
apparatus of the density matrix, we derive the corresponding equations [7, 14]. 
Remark 
3.1 Born-Markov approximation. The 
Born 
approximation 
assumes that when an external force is exerted on a system, the force does 
not change. In other words, we neglect the feedback effect of the system on the 
impact. In particular, while considering the interaction of a system with a 
reservoir of a large number of degrees of freedom, we assume that the reservoir 
state does not change. 
The Markov approximation assumes neglecting the entire history of the 
system’s evolution up to a given moment, and the immediate future state of the 
system is completely determined by its present state.

3.2
Application of the Lindblad Equation for Radiation Problem
55
The dynamics of an open system S can be described by the density matrix ^ρS. It is  
also convenient to describe the dynamics of the closed system by the density matrix 
^ρ. The latter obeys the von Neumann equation for the density matrix ^ρ [13, 15]: 
∂^ρ tð Þ  
∂t 
= - i 
ħ 
^HS þ ^HR þ ^HSR, ^ρ tð Þ  :
ð3:2:6Þ 
We conﬁne ourselves to the interaction Hamiltonian of the following form: 
^HSR = ħκ^S^R,
ð3:2:7Þ 
where ^S and ^R are operators that only depend on the dynamic variables of the system 
and the reservoir, respectively, and κ is the coupling constant of the system with the 
reservoir. In what follows, the operators ^S and ^R are dimensionless, and Planck’s 
constant in the expression for ^HSR is introduced so that the coupling constant κ has 
the dimension of frequency. Though this is not the general form of the interaction 
Hamiltonians, all the Hamiltonians we use in Part I of this book have this form, e.g., 
the interaction Hamiltonian of a TLS with the reservoir of the free space modes or 
with the reservoir of phonons. We assume that the operators ^S and ^R correspond to 
some observable physical quantity and are Hermitian. 
Since we imply that the interaction is of the EM nature, the coupling constant κ is 
small compared to the atomic eigenfrequencies; the typical ratio of these quantities is 
proportional to the ﬁne-structure constant α ≈ 1/137 ≪ 1 [16]. Thus, κ ≪ ΔωS, 
where ΔωS is the characteristic frequency difference between the system eigenstates. 
It means that the dynamics of open system S is described by two different time

inside the system, and a long time scale ~1/κ that characterizes the relaxation of the 
system S. We are mainly interested in the processes that happen at the time scale:

As has been mentioned above, to study the dynamics of the open system S, we  
exclude all variables belonging to the reservoir from Eq. (3.2.6). For this purpose, we 
use the interaction picture: 
ρ tð Þ = exp i ^HS þ ^HR t=ħ ^ρ exp - i ^HS þ ^HR t=ħ : 
In this picture, the density matrix ρ tð Þ  satisﬁes the equation: 
∂ρ tð Þ  
∂t 
= - i 
ħ HSR tð Þ, ρ ,
ð3:2:9Þ 
where

HSR tð Þ = exp i ^HS þ ^HR t=ħ ^HSR exp - i ^HS þ ^HR t=ħ : 
Note that 
^S, ^R = 0 and 
^HS, ^HR = 0. The operators ^S and ^R, as well as the 
Hamiltonians ^HS and ^HR, commute because these operators correspond to different 
degrees of freedom. Then, in the interaction picture, the operator ^HSR = ħκ^S^R can be 
rewritten in the form: 
HSR tð Þ = ħκS tð ÞR tð Þ
ð3:2:10Þ 
where 
S tð Þ = exp i^HSt=ħ ^S exp - i^HSt=ħ 
and 
R tð Þ = exp i^HRt=ħ ^R exp - i^HRt=ħ : 
The coupling constant in the interaction operator HSR tð Þ  is still equal to κ.

Equation (3.2.9) may be recast as

It is worth emphasizing that in the interaction picture, both operators and wave 
functions may depend upon time. Equation (3.2.11) shows that in the interaction 
picture, when κ = 0, the density matrix does not depend on time, ρ tð Þ = constant.

where Δt is a characteristic time of the order of ~t - t0. 
In the limit n →1, the last term tends to zero. Indeed, if the operator HSR tð Þ  is 
bounded i.e., for any moment of time, in any basis, the absolute value of any matrix 
elements of HSR tð Þ  is limited from above by a ﬁnite value Hmax. Then, by deﬁnition, 
the evolution operator is also always bounded. (This is correct until the times 
considered are smaller than the time of returning of excitation from the reservoir 
to the system [17, 18].) Consequently, the last term in Eq. (3.2.15) can be 
evaluated as1

To move forward, we make additional assumptions. First, we use the Born approx-
imation, assuming that, at any moment in time, the reservoir density matrix does not 
change with time. Physically, this approximation means that the reservoir is so large 
that interaction with the system cannot change its temperature. Second, we assume 
that the reservoir is in thermal equilibrium with the temperature T, i.e., the proba-
bility of having the energy ER is proportional to exp(-ER/T) (this assumption is 
often called the Gibbs ansatz). According to the Gibbs ansatz, in the thermal 
equilibrium, the reservoir density matrix ^ρth 
R has the form: 
^ρR 0
ð Þ = ^ρth 
R = 
exp - ^HR=T 
Tr exp - ^HR=T 
: 
Thus, in the Born approximation, ρ tð Þ = ^ρS tð Þ^ρth 
R . Then, the operators ρ1 t0 þ Δt

Þ = 0, and 
in Eq. (3.2.24), only the second-order term in κ remains. 
To calculate the time integrals in ρ2 tð Þ  (see Eq. (3.2.23)), we need to know an 
explicit expression for S tð Þ. It can be obtained explicitly only if the eigenstates of the 
system Hamiltonian ^HS are known. Otherwise, the described procedure does not 
work, and other methods for calculating of S tð Þ  should be used [20]. 
If we know the eigenstates jki of the Hamiltonian ^HS, we can expand the operator

On the right-hand side of Eq. (3.2.26), only the exponential factors are time-
dependent. This allows us to calculate integrals in Eqs. (3.2.22) and (3.2.23). 
According to Eq. (3.2.8), (ΔωS)-1 < Δt < 1/κ; therefore, this integration plays the 
role of time averaging over fast oscillations. This is the key moment in the procedure 
of eliminating the reservoir variables, allowing us to obtain the explicit time depen-
dence S tð Þ. 
To avoid repetitions, we only discuss the procedure for evaluating the ﬁrst term in 
Eq. (3.2.23). After substituting Eq. (3.2.26) into Eq. (3.2.23), we arrive at the

characterizes the correlation of the

correlation function. The function changes over time with a characteristic scale τR. 
The time τR can be roughly estimated as ħ/kBT~10-14 s [21], where T is the reservoir 
temperature. In our case, τR~1/ΔωS, where ΔωS = min 
k ≠k0 Δωkk0 
is the minimum 
frequency interval between different nondegenerate states. 
To calculate time integrals in Eq. (3.2.27), we note that only oscillatory exponents 
are present in the integrand. Also, since we chose the time interval Δt in such a way 
that it greatly exceeds all the characteristic times of the system, 1/ΔωS ≪ Δt. 
Therefore, in Eq. (3.2.27), the integration limits can be extended to inﬁnity. As a 
result, we can calculate the integrals in Eq. (3.2.27) as

all possible frequency differences ωk0k00.

The further consideration is valid for systems with high-quality factor (γk0k00 ≪ΔωS). 
For low-Q systems, instead of using the Lindblad equation, one has to use other 
methods. 
For 
high-Q 
systems, 
we 
can 
choose 
Δt 
from 
the 
interval 
1=ΔωS ≪Δt ≪1=γk0k00. Such a choice means that Δt is much smaller than any 
characteristic time 1=γk0k00 of the system. Consequently, the difference in the left-
hand side of Eq. (3.2.31) can be replaced with the derivative. The obtained equation 
is called the Lindblad equation for the density matrix ρS of the system:

employing the Lindblad equation, we have to check that the inequality

is satisﬁed. The right-hand side of Eq. (3.2.32) deﬁnes the Lindblad superoperator 
^L ρS tð Þ  . One can show that if the reservoir is in thermal equilibrium with temper-
ature T (so that ρR = exp (-HR/T)/Tr(exp(-HR/T))), then the function γkk0 satisﬁes 
the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation [13, 22, 23]: 
γk0k00=γk00k0 = exp ħΔωk0k00=kT
ð

3:2:33Þ 
where T is the reservoir temperature (see Problem 1.8). 
3.2
Application of the Lindblad Equation for Radiation Problem
63
The integration procedure in Eqs. (3.2.28) and (3.2.29) requires that the integra-
tion time Δt be greater than the characteristic inverse frequency 1/ΔωS of the system, 
Δt ≫ 1/ΔωS. However, the integration time Δt should not be too large so that 
expansion (3.2.15) for the evolution operator holds. From Eqs. (3.2.31) and (3.2.32), 
we can see that the latter requires that the condition γk0k00Δt ≪1 must be satisﬁed. 
Thus, the criteria for the applicability of the described procedure for eliminating the 
reservoir variables are the conditions γk0k00 ≪ΔωS and 1=ΔωS ≪Δt ≪1=γk0k00. 
Having the density matrix in the interaction picture, we can obtain ^ρS tð Þ  in the 
Schrödinger picture by the inverse conversion of ρS tð Þ: 
^ρS tð Þ = exp - i^HSt=ħ ρS tð Þ exp i^HSt=ħ ,

Remark 3.2 Rate equation. The approach of the rate equation is often used to 
describe laser dynamics. In relation to the TLS model of an atom, such an 
approach is developed based on the simple notion that there should be a 
balance between the number of atoms undergoing transitions from the ground 
(excited) to the excited (ground) state and the change in the number of photons 
being annihilated or created. The simplest mathematical equation describing 
this process is the rate equation, which relates the time derivative of the photon 
numbers to the imbalance of the transitions. In our case, it is important that 
when one photon is absorbed or emitted, the total population of the levels 
remains unchanged. 
Equation (3.2.39) describes the dynamics of the off-diagonal elements of the 
density matrix. One can see that each off-diagonal element evolves independently 
from the other density matrix elements. Thus, each off-diagonal element oscillates 
with the frequency ωi - ωf and decays exponentially with the rate: 
γσ = 1 
2 
k 
γki þ γkf :
ð3:2:41Þ 
The quantities γkk0 have the meaning of the transition rates between the system 
eigenstates. Note that, according to Eq. (3.2.30), γkk0 depends not only on the density 
of states of the reservoir f(ω) but also on the matrix elements k0
h j^S kj i. If these matrix 
elements change, e.g., due to changing system eigenstates, the transition rate γkk0 also 
changes even when the reservoirs remain the same. This fact plays an important role 
in considering Rayleigh scattering in Chap. 6. 
To illustrate the application of the apparatus of the density matrix, in the next 
subsection, we consider a well-known result of spontaneous emission of an excited 
atom into the reservoir of free space modes (see also Sect. 3.1.) 
3.2.4 
Transverse and Longitudinal Decay Times 
at Spontaneous Emission of an Excited Atom into 
the Reservoir of Free Space Modes 
To see how the master equation works, we use Eq. (3.2.35) to reproduce the 
description of the spontaneous emission process of an atom into the reservoir of 
the free space modes. In Sect. 2.1, this process was considered by employing the 
Weiskopf-Wigner theory.

Radiation into free space. We start with TLS Hamiltonians (2.2.11) and the

where V is the mode volume. The frequency ωa, k is the eigenfrequency of the free 
space mode with the wave vector k (see Eq. (3.2.30)). For simplicity, we assume that 
the dipole polarization of the atom is of spherical symmetry. Under this assumption, 
the polarization of the electric ﬁeld in the free space mode is immaterial, and we can 
ignore the vector character of deg, writing ek . deg = deg, as we did in Sect. 2.4. 
In interaction Hamiltonian (3.2.42), the system is represented by the operator 
^S = ^σ þ ^σ{ . In the interaction picture, this operator has the form (see Eq. (3.2.26)):

are interested in optical frequencies, ħωσ~2eV, and room temperature, kT~0.026eV; 
therefore, exp(-ħωσ/kT)~10-17 , and we neglect spontaneous transitions from the

Usually, for the relaxation rate of the off-diagonal elements, one introduces the 
notation: 
γσ = γ rad

ð3:2:50Þ 
Since the expectation value of the dipole moment is 
d
h i ~ dge ^σ
h i = ρgedge (see 
Eq. (2.3.23), the relaxation time of the dipole moment is equal to γσ. 
The rate of energy relaxation (relaxation of the diagonal element ρee) is often 
referred to as the rate of longitudinal relaxation. The longitudinal relaxation is 
characterized by the longitudinal decay time τk = τ1 = 1=γ rad
ð

of the dipole moment (relaxation of the off-diagonal elements) is referred to as the 
rate of the transverse relaxation characterized by the transverse decay time

In the dipole approximation, for the interaction between the atom and the 
reservoir deﬁned by Eq. (3.2.42), we have found that γσ = γ rad
ð
Þ
 
D

physics, we see the same relationship because the rate of energy loss is proportional 
to the time derivative of the square of the dipole moment. 
We obtain that τ2 = 2=γ rad

. However, in most situations, e.g., in 
colloidal quantum dots, dye molecules, and superconducting qubits, τ1 > τ2. To  
understand the reason for this, we consider another type of interaction between the 
atom and the reservoir. 
Remark 3.3 In both Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures, we obtain 
that without a dephasing reservoir, γ rad
ð

D

this 
relationship 
by 
using

Indeed, 
from 
the 
assumption 
that

it

When considering the TLS interaction with a dephasing reservoir, we should 
transition from the wave function to the density matrix description. In the latter 
case, the decay rates of diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the density 
matrix are γ rad

and γσ, respectively. If there is no dephasing, we have γD = 2γσ

(continued)

Remark 3.3 (continued) 
γσ = γ rad

Heisenberg picture, in which the operators ^σ{ and ^σ decay with the rate γσ
while the operator ^σ{ ^σ decays with the rate γD (see Sect. 3.2.3). Obtaining 
γ rad
ð

D

terms caused by the dephasing reservoir. When this is done, we arrive at the

=2 þ γdeph. The latter result arises because in the equation 
for ^σ{ ^σ , the emerging additional terms like ^F

The interaction with dephasing reservoir. This interaction only leads to the 
dephasing or decoherence of the system but does not change the TLS energy. 
Examples are the broadening of the emission line due to collisions with surrounding 
gas molecules and the elastic interaction with phonons of the substrate on which 
tested molecules are deposited. The dephasing rate can exceed the energy dissipation 
rate by several orders of magnitude (τdeph

time τ*

n κn are the 
effective coupling constant and the operator representing the dephasing reservoir in 
Eq. (3.2.7). 
Since Hamiltonian (2.2.10) commutes with ^S = ^σz and with Hamiltonian (3.2.52), 
the TLS energy is conserved. Thus, Hamiltonian (3.2.52) describes the elastic 
scattering of the reservoir excitations on the system. In this case, Eq. (3.2.26) takes 
the form: 
S tð Þ = exp i^HSt=ħ ^S exp - i^HSt=ħ =

Thus, the interaction with the dephasing reservoir causes the vanishing of the

Eq. (3.2.58)). More precisely, while the energy, which is proportional to the square 
of the dipole moment, is conserved (Eq. (3.2.56)), the off-diagonal elements of the 
density matrix vanish. This is why this process is called the dephasing process. 
Naturally, both types of relaxation are present in real systems, and the dipole 
moment dissipates with the rate:

The considered dephasing reservoir only contributes to the transverse relaxation rate 
only (see Eq. (3.2.58)) and does not contribute to the longitudinal relaxations. This 
happens because dephasing Hamiltonian (3.2.52) commutes with the Hamiltonian of 
the TLS and conserves energy. 
3.2
Application of the Lindblad Equation for Radiation Problem

As shown above, in the optical range, the interaction with the reservoir of free 
space modes leads to energy dissipation and gives the ratio of the times of longitu-
dinal and transverse relaxations equal to 2 (see Eq. (3.2.50)). Since, in a real system, 
this ratio can reach 105 while modeling such systems, it is necessary to use both a 
reservoir describing energy relaxation and a dephasing reservoir.

Schr and take the trace over the system variables. 
The application of the obtained correlator to the TLS problem. Let us illustrate 
the application of the algorithm for the TLS interacting with a reservoir of free space

The Lindblad master equation for the TLS density matrix (see Eq. (3.2.47))

Fermi’s Golden Rule 
In practice, to quickly obtain an estimate for the probability amplitude for a transition 
between states, one can resort to Fermi’s golden rule. This rule is discussed in almost 
every textbook on quantum mechanics (see, e.g., Refs. [15, 28–30]) in connection 
with the transition of a quantum system from a discrete stationary state to a quasi-
continuum of states. Besides beta decay, Fermi’s golden rule is used in the theory of 
ionization and spontaneous emission. In most cases, this is a transition from a 
discrete state to a continuous spectrum state. 
Below, we show that Fermi’s golden rule can only be derived for transitions in 
which the ﬁnal state belongs to the continuous spectrum. Usually, for an atom 
interacting with a single mode of an EM ﬁeld, Fermi’s golden rule is derived 
using the standard perturbation theory. 
Suppose that the Hamiltonian of the system can be represented in the form 
^HS = ^H 
0
ð Þ  þ ^V tð Þ, where ^H 
0
ð Þ  is the Hamiltonian of an atom and ^V tð Þ  is the 
perturbation caused by a single mode of the time-dependent classical ﬁeld. The 
wave function for this system obeys the Schrödinger equation. We assume that the 
eigenstates ψ 0
ð Þ  
i 
of the Hamiltonian ^H 
0
ð Þ  are known, and their time dependence is 
given by exp(iωit). The wave function jψ(t)i can be searched for as a linear 
combination of the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian ^H

ð3:3:1Þ 
Suppose that at the initial moment, the atom is in the state jψii. It means that 
ai(0) = 1, while al(0) = 0 (l ≠ i). Since the perturbation ^V tð Þ is small, jai(t)| ≫jal(t)|, 
so we can still assume that for l ≠ i, al(t) = 0. Therefore,

tð Þ increases linearly with time. The perturbation theory is correct only 
when 
ψf ^V ψi

it ≪1; therefore, there is not only a limitation on the magnitude of 
the external inﬂuence but also on the time of observation. In particular, for 
t > 1= ψf ^V ψi
j
it , we cannot conﬁne ourselves to the ﬁrst order of the perturbation 
theory but have to consider higher orders of the perturbation. In this case, we should 
take into account transitions between other states that lead to complex behavior, 
which spectrum contains all ωl. This motion does not have a stationary state with the 
ﬁxed energy because the Hamiltonian ^HS = ^H 
0
ð Þ  þ ^V tð Þ  is time-depended, and the 
energy is not conserved. In the case of a TLS, for t > 1= ψf ^V ψi
j
it , the system 
performs Rabi oscillations (see Sect. 2.4 for details).

We have obtained the probability of ﬁnding the system at the moment t in a given 
state. However, this probability diverges with time: p tð Þ 1

~ t2; hence, as mentioned 
above, such an approach is applicable only for short time intervals. Therefore, we 
cannot consider p tð Þ 1
ð Þ  
fi 
given by Eq. (3.3.6) as the transition probability. 
Below, following the Weisskopf-Wigner approach, we show that replacing the 
ﬁnal state of a reservoir with a continuum of states allows one to ﬁnd a correct 
solution for the problem. 
Usually, one considers an ensemble of systems with slightly different ﬁnal states 
in the frequency interval Δωf ≪ ωf [15, 31]. Then, physical quantities should be 
averaged over this ensemble by using the density of ﬁnal states Π(ωk) (see 
Eq. (3.1.20)).

Open Quantum Systems
The meaning of this procedure is that the problem of the electron transition 
between discrete atomic levels is replaced by the problem of the transition from a 
discrete state to a continuum of states. Fermi’s theory of the transitions to some 
discrete state with lower energy is close to the Weisskopf-Winer theory, while the 
transitions with an increase in the eigenenergy Fermi considered ionization [2], e.g., 
transitions to a reservoir with the continuum of eigenstates. Thus, the ensemble of 
ﬁnal states considered here plays the role of a reservoir. Then, instead of Eq. (3.3.6), 
we obtain:

This equation constitutes Fermi’s golden rule. It shows that, even in the ﬁrst order of 
the perturbation theory, the probability per unit time p(1) (t)/t to ﬁnd the system in the 
ﬁnal state has a constant value. 
Another derivation of Fermi’s golden rule is based on considering incident light, 
the frequency spectrum F(ωext) of which has a ﬁnite line half-width Δωtxt. To deal 
with probabilities instead of amplitudes of probabilities, we should assume that there 
is no interference between different frequency components and describe such a 
spectrum with the density of states [32, 33]. 
Averaging probability (3.3.6) over the spectrum of incident light, we obtain:

That is identical to Eq. (3.3.8). 
This approach can also be used when the ﬁnal state is a single excited state. In this 
case, we have to take into account that Eq. (3.3.8) is obtained using the perturbation 
theory. Consequently, it is valid at times smaller than the longitudinal decay time. 
Thus, the time interval for applying Fermi’s golden rule is limited from above by 
1=γ rad
ð
Þ
 
D 
. On the other hand, integrating probabilities over the frequency interval in 
Eqs. (3.3.7) and  (3.3.9) means that we disregard all interference phenomena. Such a 
consideration is reasonable for times greater than the transverse decay time 1/γσ, in  
which diagonal elements of the density matrix vanish (see Eq. (3.2.49)). 
Thus, our consideration is reasonable at times 1=γσ ≪t ≪1=γ rad

. This is opposite to the 
former inequality, and therefore, such an approach cannot be used. Fortunately, the 
dephasing reservoir exists in most experiments [34–38]. The interaction with this 
reservoir makes 1/γσ ≪ 1/γD (see Sect. 3.2). Thus, applying Fermi’s golden rule also 
requires an interaction of a quantum system with some dephasing reservoir of the 
continuum of modes. 
Without such an assumption, we are left with formula (3.3.6), which is the ﬁrst 
term in the expansion of the perturbation theory series. However, the complexity of 
applying Fermi’s golden rule to calculating the transition probability is hidden in 
higher-order terms. If we take into account the interaction with only one mode, then 
when considering all terms, we obtain the Rabi oscillations. If we account for a 
reservoir with a continuum of states, formula (3.3.9) becomes valid. If the number of 
states is countable, then the revival phenomenon can occur, and the system returns to 
a state in which the contribution of the excited state is of the order of O(1). 
Moreover, we can lengthen the observation time if the atom interaction with the 
reservoir does not involve revival. To conclude, regardless of whether an atom 
absorbs or emits a photon, it should be viewed as an open system interacting with 
some dephasing reservoir of continuum modes [3, 6, 7]. 
3.4 
Heisenberg-Langevin Equations 
In Sect. 2.4, employing the Heisenberg picture, we have considered the dynamics of 
a closed Hermitian system consisting of a TLS and a single classical EM mode. In 
the current section, we move further by taking into account the interaction of the 
system with a free space mode reservoir, described by the Hamiltonian 
^HE = 
α, k 
ħωa,k^aþ 
α,k^aα,k. As in Sect. 3.1, we assume that the reservoir is so large that

ð
it is always in the state of thermal equilibrium (the Born approximation). Below, we 
eliminate the variables of the reservoir of free space modes. 
78

Open Quantum Systems
In the Heisenberg picture, the TLS is described by the Hamiltonian (3.1.1) 
employed in the Weisskopf-Wigner approach to describe spontaneous emission. 
This implies that the reservoir consists of free space modes only. The Heisenberg 
equations of motion for atomic and free space ﬁeld variables have the form:

In deriving Eq. (3.4.6), we have not yet used any approximations; however, to 
solve this equation, we should use the Markov approximation described in Sect. 3.1 
(see the transition from Eq. (3.1.9) to Eq. (3.1.10)). Using this approximation results 
in neglecting the system memory and assuming that ^σslow t - τ

Finally, using the density of states of free space modes, we can move from the 
summation over k to the integration over ω. The integration can be performed 
analytically using the Sokhotski formula (see Eqs. (3.1.15) and (3.1.16)). In the

ð3:4:10Þ 
In Eq. (3.4.10), the transition from summation to integration reﬂects the “continuity” 
of the reservoir spectrum. The last equality is valid since we consider the reservoir of 
free space modes. This equality coincides with the one obtained in the Schrödinger 
picture (see Eqs. (3.1.18) and (3.1.21)). In the Schrödinger picture, we deal with the 
probability amplitude Ce(t), which relaxes with the rate γσ, and with the probability 
Ce tð Þ
j
j2 = Ce tð ÞC*
e tð Þ, which relaxes with the rate γD, while in the Heisenberg 
picture, we deal with the operator ^σH tð Þ, whose relaxation rate is γσ, and with the 
operator of the population inversion ^DH = 2^σH 
{ σH -^I. In both pictures, the relax-
ation rate of the product of operators is double of that of each operator. In reality, 
however, the elastic coupling with the thermal reservoir may lead to the inequality 
γσ ≫ γD [34–38] (see Remark 3.3). 
Thus, we have shown that similar to the Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontane-
ous radiation, after the exclusion of the reservoir variables from Eqs. (3.4.9) and 
(3.4.10), the terms describing the TLS interaction with the reservoir of the inﬁnite

number of modes are transformed into the terms describing dissipation (spontaneous 
emission) (Eq. (3.4.10)), and noise (Eq. (3.4.7)). 
80

Open Quantum Systems
In Eq. (3.4.9), the dissipation term - γσ^σH slow is responsible for the system 
reaching the stationary state, while the noise term ^Fσ tð Þ  determines the correlation 
of time-ﬂuctuation properties of the state. Both these terms are due to the interactions 
of the TLS with free space modes. These interactions are described by coupling 
constants Ωk, α, which are directly included in the expressions for noise (Eq. (3.4.7)), 
and dissipation (Eq. (3.4.10)). The presence of these terms is the manifestation of the 
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem that links the emergence of noise with dissipation 
and vice versa [6, 39]. 
Now, we come back to fast-oscillating variables. Performing a similar procedure 
for Eqs. (3.4.2)–(3.4.3), we arrive at the equations for the operators ^σH tð Þ, ^σ{ 
H tð Þ, 
and ^DH: 
d^σH

ð3:4:13Þ 
Since we set the reservoir temperature to zero, we should assume ^D0 = -^I. 
Equations (3.4.12) and (3.4.13) are called Heisenberg-Langevin equations. 
In these equations, the noise terms are obtained similarly to the term ^Fσ tð Þ  in 
Eq. (3.4.7). These terms have the form:

lution of a TLS in the presence of radiation losses.

Heisenberg Picture of Dynamics of Two-Level System 
Driven by External Field 
In the previous section, we considered the emission of an excited TLS interacting 
with a reservoir in the absence of an external ﬁeld. Now, we take into account the 
external ﬁeld. We consider the TLS, the reservoir of free space modes, and the

external ﬁeld as a closed Hermitian system. For the description of the dipole
interaction of the TLS with the modes of the EM ﬁeld, we employ the rotating
wave approximation (see the text above Eq. (

following Hamiltonian:

These equations describe an open system (the TLS and the incident ﬁeld), which is a 
part of the closed system described by Hamiltonian (3.4.14). Using these equations, 
we can describe the effect of light radiation on the atom’s dynamical spectrum. In the 
end, we obtain the spectrum of emitted photons connected with the spectrum of the 
TLS oscillations [6].

Calculation of such correlators is much easier if the system of Eqs. (3.4.19)–(3.4.21) 
can be rewritten as a linear system of ﬁrst-order ordinary homogeneous differential 
equations with time-independent coefﬁcients. Indeed, in this case, for an arbitrary 
operator column vector x(t) that obeys the equation 
d^x tð Þ  
dt 
= M^x tð Þ,
ð3:4:23Þ 
where M is a square constant c-number matrix, the two-time correlation function

If the equation for ^x contains an external source ^F tð Þ  (as systems (3.4.19)–(3.4.21) 
do), in the equation for the two-time correlation function, the external force acquires 
the dependence on ^x even if ^F tð Þ  is ^x-independent:

i. However, if the sources are Markov-
ian, then according to the quantum regression theorem (see Refs. [6, 21] and 
Problem 1.12.), we can still use Eq. (3.4.24). Therefore, our goal is to reduce the 
matrix of system (3.4.19)–(3.4.21) to a time-independent matrix in the desired form. 
To make the coefﬁcients in Eqs. (3.4.19)–(3.4.21) time-independent, the 
approach of slowly varying amplitudes can be applied:

The next task is to exclude the non-Markovian source -γD ^I in Eq. (3.4.28). For this 
purpose, we resort to considering the expectation values of the operators. Since the 
system of Eqs. (3.4.26)–(3.4.28) is linear, these values obey the following system of 
equations:

When all transient processes are ﬁnished, and the system reaches its dynamic 
equilibrium, the stationary values of slowly varying amplitudes of system 
(3.4.26)–(3.4.28) become time-independent:

The ﬁrst of these equations shows that the stationary behavior of the expectation 
value is a forced oscillation at the frequency of the external ﬁeld.

Now, we are ready to exclude the source - γD ^I from Eq. (3.4.28). For this 
purpose, we transition to new variables:

The ﬁrst term in this expression gives the δ-shape contribution to the spectrum. 
Usually, this term is considered to be responsible for the coherent elastic Rayleigh 
scattering at the frequency of the external ﬁeld ωext. For this reason, it is often called 
the coherent or elastic part of the oscillations. 
3.4
Heisenberg-Langevin Equations
85
The second term in Eq. (3.4.39) is the contribution due to quantum ﬂuctuations in 
the TLS. This is not only noises but also terms appearing due to the noncommutative 
properties of the operators (see Eq. (2.4.13)). From matrix eq. (3.4.35), it follows that

 depends on τ as exp(-γστ). 
Thus, the last term in Eq. (3.4.39) determines the spectrum width. This term can be 
called the incoherent or inelastic part of the TLS oscillations. 
The spectrum of the TLS oscillations is determined by the Wiener-Khinchin 
theorem (Eq. (3.4.22)). Using Eqs. (3.4.25) and (3.4.39), we can divide the spectrum 
into coherent and incoherent parts:

The contribution of the incoherent term becomes signiﬁcant if the amplitude of the 
incident ﬁeld is large enough so that, Ωext > γD (see Refs. [6, 7] and the discussion 
below). 
The term 
Δ^σ{ 
slow tst þ τ
ð
ÞΔ^σslow tst
ð
Þ
 is often considered as an inelastic contri-
bution [7] because the corresponding Fourier transform differs from the delta-
function. However, in the literature on Raman scattering, the contributions at the 
Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies are called inelastic, while the contributions to the 
spectrum near the frequency of the incident ﬁeld (even with a ﬁnite linewidth) are 
called elastic. In this book, we follow the terminology customary for the literature on 
Raman scattering and call inelastic only those contributions to the spectrum arising 
from 
the 
coupling 
with 
vibrations 
of 
nuclei 
in 
a 
molecule. 
The

 is referred to as incoherent. 
To conclude this subsection, we have found the dynamics of the TLS, which is 
driven by the external monochromatic ﬁeld and radiates into free space. In the next 
subsection, we show that the spectrum of the emitted ﬁeld up to a constant coincides 
with the spectrum of TLS dynamics. 
3.4.2 
The Radiation Spectrum of Driven Two-Level System 
in the Heisenberg Picture 
There are two experimental methods for determining the spectrum of radiation. One 
is passing light through an optical prism or diffraction grating to obtain the Fourier 
harmonics of the signal. Then, one can separately measure the light intensity of each 
Fourier harmonic. In such experiments, the measured quantity is proportional to the 
average number of photons nk tð  Þ = ^a{ 
k tð  Þ^ak tð  Þ  in the mode with the given wave 
vector k and the polarization α (to simplify the notations, below, we drop the 
subscript α).

3.4
Heisenberg-Langevin Equations
87
To ﬁnd nα, k(t), we assume that, ﬁrst, the TLS exhibits forced oscillations of the 
dipole moment caused by the external ﬁeld and, second, at any time, the average 
number of emitted photons is much less than unity. This means that the excitation of 
the free space mode does not affect the TLS radiation rate. In other words, we neglect 
the back action of the radiated photons on the TLS. 
Using Hamiltonian (3.4.14), we can write the Heisenberg equation for the 
annihilation operator ^ak: 
d^ak tð Þ

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (3.4.46) is the number of thermal photons of free space. The 
second term is proportional to the stationary value of the induced dipole moment of 
the TLS, 
^σst

j2 . This term arises due to the coherent forced oscillation, and it 
corresponds to the Rayleigh scattering. The third term corresponds to the incoherent 
ﬂuorescence accompanying the coherent Rayleigh scattering (the Mollow triplet), 
which is discussed in the next section in detail. 
The second method of measuring the light spectrum uses an interferometer. In 
this method, incident light with the amplitude E(t) passes through a beam splitter. 
The obtained two beams with amplitudes ^E1 tð Þ  and ^E2 tð Þ  run along two different 
optical paths, say r1 and r2. As a result, one of the beams gains the retardation time 
τ = (r1 - r2)/c, so that ^E1 tð Þ = ^E2 t þ τ
ð
Þ. The beams converge on the detector, 
which measures the intensity of the incident light. Knowing the total intensity and 
the intensities of both beams, one can obtain the correlator:

ð3:4:47Þ 
The Fourier transform of this correlator is proportional to S(ω) given by Eq. (3.4.42).

The radiation spectrum appears as a perturbation of the free space modes. The 
perturbation is determined by Eq. (3.4.43) and, up to a constant factor, coincides 
with the spectrum S(ω) of the dipole moment oscillation of the TLS (see 
Eq. (3.4.42)). Thus, to calculate the radiation spectrum, it is sufﬁcient to calculate 
the oscillation spectrum of the atomic dipole moment. 
To conclude Chap. 3, we summarize the obtained results. We have seen that the 
irreversibility of the transition of an atom from an excited state to a ground state 
occurs when the atom interacts with a continuum of reservoir modes with a given 
energy and all possible directions of wave vectors. For photon radiation, this 
reservoir is the reservoir of free space modes, while for photon absorption, this 
reservoir is the ensemble of ﬁnal atomic states. In the former case, the lost energy is 
distributed among the reservoir modes. If we deal with a ﬁnite number of reservoir 
modes, the modes should be included in the uniﬁed Hermitian system, which loses 
no energy and does not reach a stationary state.

Coherent Light 
Before proceeding to the quantum theory of Rayleigh scattering, we must clarify 
what we mean by coherence. In the literature, there are two approaches to describing 
coherence. The ﬁrst approach treats the light as a classical EM ﬁeld [1], while the 
second deals with quantized ﬁelds [2]. Generally speaking, interpretations of the 
concept of “coherence” given by these approaches are not identical. 
In classical physics, the coherence of two signals is understood as their ability to 
generate an interference pattern. To assess the coherence of a light beam, it can be 
split into two beams, and their potential for interference is examined. To achieve this, 
the beams must go through different optical paths from the point of separation to the 
point where their combined intensity is recorded. The contrast of the interference 
pattern quantiﬁes the degree of coherence. In this sense, a monochromatic plane 
wave is perfectly coherent. 
Deﬁning coherence for quantum ﬁelds is more complicated; we discuss it below. 
In many experiments, EM ﬁelds behave as a composition of quanta of the EM ﬁeld 
(photons). To describe photons, amplitudes of classical EM ﬁelds are replaced with 
operators. While classical EM ﬁelds are characterized by directly measurable 
c-functions, the quantized ﬁelds are characterized by the wave function or quantum 
states. In experiment, one can measure the expectation values of the operators 
corresponding to EM ﬁelds. 
It is usually assumed that the transition from the quantum description to the 
classical one occurs when the number of photons is large. Unlike classical quantities, 
the operators corresponding to the EM ﬁelds may not commute. However, since 
commutators of the ﬁeld operators are proportional to the Planck constant, we can 
treat these operators as c-numbers. The expectation values of the ﬁeld operators 
become almost continuous variables of the number of photons. The quantization 
becomes immaterial, and we can set ħ = 0. 
The quantum nature of light is most clearly manifested when describing the 
quantum states of light using Fock states—the states having a ﬁxed number of 
light quanta (photons). However, in doing so, we encounter some problems with 
the transition to the classical description.

Coherent Light
First, a Fock state with a single-photon incident on two holes in a screen does not 
produce an interference picture on the plane of a receiver behind the screen. Only by 
repeating this experiment many times can we see the interference pattern. The 
situation changes dramatically if we consider a Fock state with two incident quanta. 
There is a possibility that we will not observe the interference picture at all (Hong-
Ou-Mandel effect) [3]. Thus, the more quanta a Fock state has, the more difﬁcult it is 
to interpret its coherence according to the classical deﬁnition. That contradicts our 
expectations of the transition to the classical description with an increase in the 
number of photons. 
Second, even for a Fock state with many photons, the expectation values of the 
creation and annihilation operators and, consequently, the expectation values of the 
ﬁeld operator E zð Þ = E0 zð Þ  a{ þ a 
are zero. 
We can expect that the contradiction between classical and quantum approaches 
to coherence is due to using the basis of Fock states, for which the expectation values 
of the ﬁeld are zero—using a different basis should ﬁx the problem. This basis 
should be such that the expectation values of the electric ﬁeld are not equal to zero. 
Below, we show that the eigenstates jzi of the annihilation operator a (a zj i = z zj i) 
meet this requirement, and in quantum optics, they are considered as coherent states 
[4]. We discuss the properties of the states which justify such a name. In particular, 
we show that though the annihilation operator is not Hermitian, its eigenfunctions 
can build a basis. However, since the operator a is not Hermitian, this basis is not 
orthonormal and is overcomplete. 
To describe the properties of such eigenstates, it is convenient to use a unitary 
operator of a shift in the phase space (Problem 1.14): 
D zð Þ = exp za{ - za = exp 
a{ - a Re z þ i a{ þ a Imz 
= exp i p0Q - q0P =ħ = D q0, p0
ð
Þ: 
ð4:1:1Þ 
Here the operators Q and P are quadrature operators used for the quantization of the 
EM ﬁeld in Sect. 2.5, q0 = 
2ħ=ω Re z and p0 = 
2ħω
p
Imz. One can see that 
D{ (z) = D-1 (z)D(-z). The expectation values of the quadrature operators Q and P 
in a coherent state are 
zh jQ zj i = 0
h jD 
{ zð ÞQD zð Þ  0j i = 0
h jQ - q01 0j i = q0 
and 
z P z  = p0, respectively (see Problem 1.15). 
Thanks to the operator D zð Þ, further analytical calculations become easier. 
Particularly, the coherent state can also be determined as a result of the action 
of the operator on the vacuum state: 
zj i = D zð Þ  0j i:
ð4:1:2Þ 
Indeed, the coherent state deﬁned in this way is an eigenfunction of the annihilation 
operator. This can be seen from the equality chain:

j i
j i
0 = D zð Þa 0j i = D zð ÞaD
- 1 zð Þ  zj i = a - z1 
zj i,
ð4:1:3Þ 
in which a 0j i = 0 0j i  is taken into account (see Problem 1.16). Equation (4.1.3) 
indicates that the coherent state is the eigenfunction of the annihilation operator, 
a z  = z z  .

As shown in Problem 1.17, the coherent state can be expanded over the Fock 
states [2]:

(see Problem 1.18). 
It is worth emphasizing that at jhzjz′ij →1, the states become orthogonal, while 
at jhzjz′ij → 0, they are almost the same. This feature is inherent to classical ﬁelds. A 
small difference in photon numbers weakly inﬂuences the ﬁeld structure. 
After the Hermitian conjugation, we obtain zh ja{ = z zh j. Then, if we search for 
the expectation value over the coherent state of the normally ordered product of any 
real and analytic functions of the creation and annihilation operators (i.e., in the 
product, all the creation operators are on the left of the annihilation operators), the 
expectation value is reduced to the product of the function:

ð4:1:8Þ 
This property relates the quantum concepts of coherence to the classical one. To see 
this, we consider the process of photon detection. 
In most experiments, photon detection is reduced to registering the current of 
electrons arising due to the ionization of an atom absorbing a photon. It is assumed 
that the system of the atom-EM ﬁeld is initially in the state ψi which has a photon 
that can ionize the atom and the atom in the ground state.

Semi-Classical Description of Rayleigh 
Light Scattering 
In classical electrodynamics, the dipole moment of a subwavelength particle behaves 
like a linear oscillator. In particular, the forced oscillations of the induced dipole 
moment always occur at the frequency of an external force. Consequently, when 
such particles scatter a monochromatic EM wave, the frequency of the scattered light 
remains the same as the frequency of the incident light. Thus, classical theory 
predicts that the spectrum of the Rayleigh scattering is a delta-function. 
In Chap. 2, we have seen that if a TLS interacts with a single mode of a classical 
monochromatic ﬁeld, it performs the Rabi oscillations without emitting or absorbing 
photons. In particular, employing Eqs. (2.4.13)–(2.4.15) for σ{ 
H tð Þ and σH tð Þ, we can 
ﬁnd an estimation for the correlation function:

As was mentioned in Sect. 3.4, the radiation spectrum of the TLS oscillations is 
determined by the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. In particular, the spectrum is propor-
tional to the Fourier transformation of this correlation function. For the correlation 
function determined by Eq. (5.1.1), the spectrum contains three delta-functions at the 
frequencies ωext and ωext ± 2Ωext. This contradicts Rayleigh’s theory. 
More rigorous calculations are required to consider a TLS as an open system 
interacting with a reservoir of the free space modes. The dynamics of σ{ 
H tð Þ  and 
σH tð Þ  is described by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. The correlation function 
σ{ 
H t þ τ

can be found by employing the quantum regression theorem 
(see Sect. 3.4). 
Following this way, in the next subsections, we show that for strong coupling 
(Ωext ≫γD), one can distinguish three characteristic frequencies (the Mollow triplet), 
while for weak coupling, only one delta-function arises.

Semi-Classical Description of Rayleigh Light Scattering
Special attention will also be paid to the TLS interaction with reservoirs, the 
properties of which can signiﬁcantly differ from the properties of the reservoir of free 
space modes. For example, light scattering by colloidal quantum dots, dye mole-
cules, and superconducting qubits can be accompanied by processes that do not 
change the system energy but break the phase coherence of oscillations. These 
processes are called dephasing or decoherence processes. In particular, they lead 
to the collisional broadening of the emission line of gases [1]. As shown in Sect. 3. 
2.4, the dephasing rate can exceed the energy dissipation rate by several orders of 
magnitude [2–5]. In these cases, γσ > γD/2 (see the discussion at the end of Sect. 3. 
2.4). 
5.1 
The Mollow Triplet 
First, we start with the resonant case, in which the frequency of the external ﬁeld is 
the same as the TLS transition frequency, Δω = ωext - ωσ = 0, and consider the 
interaction with the reservoir of free space modes with no dephasing, so that γσ = γD/ 
2 ≡γ/2 (see Eq. (3.2.50)). Though this is an idealization and describes experiments 
only qualitatively, it allows us, following Mollow’s pioneering work [6], to deter-
mine the radiation spectrum analytically. 
To calculate the scattering spectrum, we bring the Heisenberg-Langevin equa-
tions to the form that is convenient for using the quantum regression theorem. For 
this purpose, we use variables deﬁned in Eq. (3.4.34), which, for convenience, are 
reproduced here: 
ΔσH slow tð Þ = σH slow tð Þ - σ
h ist 
slowI, 
Δσ{ 
H slow tð Þ = σ{ 
H slow tð Þ - σ{ 
st 
slow I, 
ΔDH tð Þ = DH tð Þ - D 
st 
IÞ 
Further, to ﬁnd the correlation functions, we should solve the system of differential 
equations Eq. (3.4.35)) in which, for Δω = ωext - ωσ = 0 and γσ = γ/2, the matrix 
M is replaced with 
M =
- γ=2
0
- iΩext 
0
- γ=2
iΩext 
2iΩext

If the Rabi frequency is small, Ωext ≪ γ, instead of the Rabi oscillations, we observe 
aperiodic evolution of the TLS, and the spontaneous emission spectrum has the form 
of a single Lorentz line (Fig. 5.1a).

When the Rabi frequency is high, Ωext ≫γ, the spontaneous emission spectrum is 
incoherent, forming three Lorentz lines. Such spectrum is usually referred to as the 
Mollow triplet shown in Fig. 5.1b, by blue lines. Indeed, in this limit, we have:

Note, that at γ → 0, the spectrum is reduced to the sum of three delta-functions

delta-function says nothing about its intensity. To make it easier to compare 
the contributions of Scoh

and Sincoh

, we suppose that the external ﬁeld has a 
ﬁnite coherence time so that the δ-like Rayleigh peak is “smeared” over a small

This equation coincides with Eq. (5.1.1) obtained for the non-dissipative Rabi 
problem. Note that such a response becomes coherent if γ = 0 and should be 
shown with additional red picks. For arbitrarily small γ, the response is incoherent 
and should be shown with blue lines. 
It is worth emphasizing that the ﬁrst term in Eq. (3.4.39) is responsible for the 
coherent elastic Rayleigh scattering at the frequency of the external ﬁeld ωext = ωσ. 
In the limit γσ/Ωext → 0, the total intensity of the Rayleigh scattering (red line) is 
much less than the intensity of the Mollow triplet (blue lines). Indeed, the intensity of 
the Rayleigh scattering is proportional to 
σst

limit γσ/Ωext → 0 is proportional to

(see Eq. (3.4.33)). Thus, the sharp 
peak on the frequency ωext, in the Rayleigh spectrum, is a part of the Mollow triplet. 
Let us consider the energies of the coherent Wcoh (Rayleigh) and incoherent 
Wincoh (Mollow) parts of the spectrum. These energies are the areas under the lines 
Scoh and Sincoh, and they can be calculated directly:

 are determined by Eqs. (3.4.33) 
and (3.4.36). 
In Fig. 5.2, the dependencies of Wcoh and Wincoh on the Rabi constant Ωext are 
shown. We see that for a small Rabi constant, the main part of the energy supplied by 
the external ﬁeld belongs to coherent-driven oscillations of the TLS. For a large Rabi 
constant, the main energy contribution is due to the incoherent TLS oscillations, 
while the energy of the coherent Rayleigh response tends to zero. 
In Fig. 5.2, the black points mark the values of Wcoh and Wincoh at Ωext = 0.25γD. 
These values, according to Eqs. (5.1.9)–(5.1.10), are equal to the areas under the red 
and blue curves in Fig. 5.1a. In this case, Wcoh > Wincoh, while at Ωext = 7.5γD, the 
green points in Fig. 5.2. the values of Wcoh and Wincoh equal the areas under the red 
and blue curves in Fig. 5.1b and Wcoh < Wincoh.

green points denote the values of Wcoh and Wincoh at Ωext = 7.5γD 
According to Eqs. (3.4.32) and  (3.4.36), the incoherent contribution Wincoh 
increases at strong ﬁeld, while Wcoh decreases (see Fig. 5.2).

Beyond the Mollow Approximation 
When dephasing is substantial, γσ = γD/2 + γdeph ≫ γD/2, or the scattering is not 
resonant, Δω = ωext - ωσ ≠ 0, system (3.4.35) for correlator functions and, 
consequently, their Fourier spectra, Eq. (3.4.22), can only be analyzed numerically.

green points denote the values of Wcoh and Wincoh at Ωext = 7.5γD 
shows that the spectrum shape changes. In the resonant case, this change is only 
quantitative (compare Fig. 5.3a, b to Fig. 5.1a, b) – the linewidth is reduced from 
γD/2 to γσ. 
In Fig. 5.4, the dependencies of Wcoh and Wincoh on the Rabi constant Ωext are 
shown in the case of dephasing. For Ωext = 0.25γD and Ωext = 7.5γD, the values of 
Wcoh and Wincoh are shown by the black and green points. These values, according to 
Eqs. (5.1.9)–(5.1.10), are equal to the areas under the red and blue curves in 
Fig. 5.3a, b, respectively. Qualitatively, the behaviors of Wcoh and Wincoh are the 
same as if there is no dephasing.

Semi-Classical Description of Rayleigh Light Scattering
Thus, the dephasing reservoir lives up to its name: the interaction with it reduces 
the coherent response of the TLS. 
5.2.2 
The Off-Resonant Case with Dephasing 
Now, we consider a nonresonant scattering, Δω ≠ 0, which has received much less 
attention in the literature. This case, however, corresponds to the most common 
experimental realization. 
Once again, we emphasize that even when the frequency of the incident ﬁeld 
differs from the TLS transition frequency, the dipole moment of the TLS performs 
harmonic oscillations precisely at the frequency of the incident ﬁeld. Indeed, from 
Eq. (3.4.32), it follows that in the limit of large detuning Δω, in the stationary regime 
( σ
h ist ≠0), we have: 
d 
= Re deg σ
h ist = - Ωext 
Δω cos ωextt
ð
Þ:
ð5:2:1Þ 
In other words, the dynamics of a TLS under the action of a coherent classical ﬁeld is 
reduced to forced oscillations. There is no photon absorption or emission. Note that, 
now, the matrix M in Eq. (5.1.2) changes to 
M = 
iΔω - γσ=2
0
- iΩext 
0
- iΔω - γσ=2 
iΩext 
2iΩext
- 2iΩext
- γD 
Let us consider the spectrum shape when the detuning is large, Δω ≫ γσ, γD, Ωext, 
and the external ﬁeld is weak, γσ ≫ Ωext. As shown in Sect. 2.4, the Rabi frequency 
of TLS oscillations in an external ﬁeld is equal to 2ΩΔ = 2 
Ω2 
ext þ Δ2 
ω=4, which 
becomes ΩΔ ≈ Δω/2 at large detuning. When the conditions of strong coupling, 
|Δω| ≫ γσ, γD, Ωext, and ΩΔ ≫ γσ, are fulﬁlled, we can expect that the TLS radiation 
spectrum has three peaks at the frequencies ωext and ωext ± 2ΩΔ. Since at |Δω| ≫ γσ, 
γD, Ωext, we have ΩΔ ≈ Δω/2; then, the frequencies of these peaks equal ωext, 
ωext + Δ = 2ωext - ωσ, ωext - Δω = ωσ. This is conﬁrmed by computer simulation 
employing Eqs. (3.4.35) and (3.4.42). The results of the simulation are shown in 
Fig. 5.5. 
The spectrum has three picks at ωext (the red line) and ωext ± 2ΩΔ ≈ ωext ± Δω 
(the blue lines). As shown in the previous subsection, the resonant Mollow triplet 
also has three peaks centered at the frequencies ωext and ωext ± 2Ωext. Thus, when 
frequency detuning is large, we have a modiﬁed Mollow triplet. For γσ = γD/2, the 
graph of Ssr(ω) is shown in Fig. 5.5a. The linewidths of incoherent response (blue 
curves) are determined by γD/2. The red line represents the coherent Rayleigh 
scattering spectrum.

Fig. 5.5 The TLS spectrum S(ω) for Ωext = 1.5γD, γσ = γD/2 = 0.5 . 10-4 ωσ (without dephasing) 
and small detuning (a) ωext - ωσ = - 20γD ≈- 0.002, (b) ωext - ωσ = 20γD ≈ 0.002. The 
frequency ωext corresponds to the Rayleigh scattering shown by red lines 
Fig. 5.6 The TLS spectrum Ssr(ω) for Ωext = 1.5γD, γσ = 2γD = 2 . 10-4 ωσ (the same case as in 
Fig. 5.5 but with dephasing) (a) ωext - ωσ = - 20γD, (b) ωext - ωσ = 20γD 
For γσ ≫ γD/2 (γdeph ≠ 0), the spectrum becomes nonsymmetric (see Fig. 5.6). 
The maximal amplitude of the spectrum is achieved at ω = ωσ, while the other lines 
are suppressed. 
Figure 5.7 shows the dependencies of Wcoh and Wincoh on the rate γσ at ﬁxed 
Ωext = 1.5γD and ωext = ωσ + 20γσ. The black and green points denote the values of 
Wcoh and Wincoh at γσ = γD/2 (no dephasing) and γσ = 2γD (high dephasing), 
respectively. These values are equal to the areas under the red and blue curves in 
Figs. 5.5 and 5.6, respectively. One can see that the incoherent part of the energy 
Wincoh increases with an increase in dephasing. For this reason, the amplitude of the 
incoherent part of the spectrum in the case of dephasing is larger than without 
dephasing (see amplitudes of blue lines in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6). 
The off-resonant scattering, |ωext - ωσ| ≪ ωσ, and the high dephasing rate, 
γσ ≫ γD/2, are usually realized in experiments in which light scatters on molecules. 
Therefore, the form of the spontaneous emission spectrum is close to a single 
Lorentz line at the atom transition frequency (see Fig. 5.6) with a linewidth of 
about γσ. Near the frequency of Rayleigh scattering ωext, the spectrum has a

background due to luminescence at the atom transition frequency and a weak peak 
due to spontaneous emission at the external ﬁeld frequency. However, the ratio of 
the amplitude of this peak to the background tends to zero at large detuning 
(Fig. 5.5). By using numerical analysis, one can show that the amplitude of the 
background is of the order of Ω2 
extγ2 
σ=Δ4 
ω, and the linewidths of two latter peaks are 
smaller than γσ.

γσ/γD = 0.5 and γσ/γD = 2.0 
Remark 5.1 Background spectrum in experiments on off-resonant 
Raman scattering In the second part of the book, we discuss the spectrum 
of spontaneous Raman scattering. We demonstrate that Raman scattering 
arises from the modulation of coherent oscillations of the TLS dipole moment 
by incoherent oscillations of nuclei. These coherent oscillations are initiated 
during Rayleigh scattering. In experiment, the Raman spectrum manifests as 
peaks against a background (see Ref. [7]). This background stems from the 
low-frequency wing of the incoherent Mollow triplet. This background does 
not interfere with the formation of the Raman spectrum. In experiment, the 
background is automatically accounted for and subtracted from the total 
spectrum. 
To summarize, in the limit Δω ≫ γσ ≫ Ωext, in the radiation spectrum near the 
external ﬁeld frequency, there is a δ-peak of Rayleigh scattering and the background 
from the spontaneous emission at the atomic transition frequency.

We have shown that the quantum consideration of the scattering of an EM wave 
by a TLS explains both the coherent Rayleigh response at the frequency of the 
external ﬁeld and the incoherent spontaneous emission, which has the form of the 
Mollow triplet. Note that when the frequencies of the external ﬁeld and the TLS 
transition are different, the intensity in the Mollow triplet is distributed in such a way 
that it has a maximum at the transition frequency of the atom. Often, this maximum 
is associated with ﬂuorescence (see Remark 5.1).

Quantum Description of Rayleigh 
Scattering of Quantized Electromagnetic 
Field 
In this chapter, we study the scattering of photons belonging to a selected free space 
mode by a quantum atom. Below, we refer to the selected mode as incident mode. 
We assume that the frequency of the incident wave is incommensurable with any 
frequency of inter-level atomic transitions. We model the atom as a TLS with the 
transition frequency ωσ. All free space modes except the selected mode are consid-
ered to be a thermalized reservoir having zero temperature. This implies that such 
EM ﬁeld modes are empty. 
We consider a quantum system, one part of which consists of an atom and a 
selected mode, and the other part is the reservoir of free space modes (the Hermitian 
properties of these parts are discussed in Sect. 2.2). The eigenstates of the ﬁrst part 
are entangled states of the atom and incident photons. Such a system is often called a 
dressed atom. These states are generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings states for the 
quantized incident light. The two parts are coupled via the interaction of the atom 
with both the modes of the reservoir and photons of incident mode. 
The scattering process is considered to be the spontaneous emission of the 
photons of the incident mode into the reservoir of free space modes. Additional 
excitations of the reservoir modes, which arise during the relaxation, are treated as 
scattered light. Such a consideration corresponds to experiments in which the 
incident ﬁeld has a narrow frequency spectrum, as in lasers. 
6.1 
The Lindblad Equation for Rayleigh Scattering 
We solve the scattering problem in two steps. First, we consider the subsystem of a 
TLS interacting with an incident EM mode, which contains n0 quanta. In the next 
step, we consider the evolving in time dipole moment of the atom as a cause for the 
perturbation of the reservoir of free space modes. It is the excitation of free space 
modes that is treated as scattering.

Quantum Description of Rayleigh Scattering of Quantized Electromagnetic Field
The ﬁrst step is the Jaynes-Cummings problem, the solution to which has been 
discussed in Sect. 2.5. Thus, after the ﬁrst step, the problem is reduced to the 
spontaneous relaxation of the Jaynes-Cummings solution. 
Now, we focus on the second step. The Hamiltonian of free space modes and the 
Hamiltonian of interaction of the considered system with these modes have the 
forms (3.1.2) and (3.1.3), respectively. Note that only the atom interacts with the free 
space modes, therefore, the interaction Hamiltonian of the considered system with 
the reservoir is the same as for a single atom in free space (see Sect. 3.1). 
Below, to describe the relaxation of the subsystem, we follow the general 
procedure developed in Sect. 3.2. Recall that to derive the Lindblad master equation, 
one has to expand the operator of the interaction between the system and the 
reservoir over the system eigenstates (see Eq. (3.2.26)). The atom interacts with 
the reservoir via its dipole moment determined by the operators S = σ and σ{ (see 
interaction Hamiltonian (3.1.3)). The system eigenstates are the Jaynes-Cummings 
eigenstates described by Eqs. (2.5.34) and (2.5.36). These eigenstates comprise a 
complete basis {|ki} = {|g, 0i, |-, ni, |+, ni} of the system states in the 
corresponding Jaynes-Cummings Hilbert space. Similarly to the TLS Hilbert 
space, where the basis for operators is formed by the transition operators, using 
the Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates for the basis of Jaynes-Cummings Hilbert space, 
one can form a basis for operators from the transition operators Sk0k00 = k0
j i  k00

 (see 
Eqs. (2.2.5) and (3.2.25)). 
One can show (see Problem 1.19) that the operator σ can be represented in terms 
of the following set of transition operators:

Knowing the Jaynes-Cummings-eigenstates, we can exclude free space mode vari-
ables except for the selected mode. Since we deal with optical frequencies, we may 
neglect relativistic effects. Following the standard procedure (see Sect. 3.2.),1 we can 
exclude the reservoir variables and obtain the Lindblad master Eq. [1–3] for the 
system density matrix. In basis (6.1.1), the equation looks as (see Problem 1.20)

Recall that the dissipation rate between eigenstates is determined by the frequency 
difference between eigenstates (see Remark 3.3). For this reason, the rates in 
Lindblad equation (6.1.4) differ from the radiation rate of a TLS in free space by 
the factor ω ± ,n 1 - ω ± ,n 
3 =ω3 
σ (see Problem 1.20). 
1 It is important to note that the frequency of the scattered photon changes by ωext. In the expression 
for γD, the density of states at the frequency of the emitted photon is included as a factor. This differs 
from the Rayleigh scattering, in which the scattering frequency is not ωσ, but ωext, as in the case of 
spontaneous radiation.

Quantum Description of Rayleigh Scattering of Quantized Electromagnetic Field
Equation (6.1.4) is obtained after averaging the Hamiltonian HSR over degrees of 
freedom of the reservoir. This is rather cumbersome but has a clear physical 
interpretation. Speciﬁcally, each term in Eq. (6.1.4) having 2SρS

as a factor describes the system transitions between the eigenstates {|g, 0i, |+, ni, |-, 
ni}, n = 1, 2, . . . . The explicit form of the S-operators is given by Eq. (6.1.1). We 
emphasize again that it is the interaction of the Jaynes-Cummings system with the 
reservoir of free space modes that leads to a transition between the eigenstates of this 
subsystem (see Problem 1.21). 
Rayleigh scattering is not resonant; therefore, for simplicity, we consider a large 
frequency difference, 
ωσ - ωa

One can see that in the limit Δa ≫Ωa 
n, the eigenfrequencies ω-,n (see Eq. (6.1.6)) 
coincide with the eigenfrequencies nωa of the selected mode with the accuracy 
Ω2 
an= Δa
j
j2 ≪1, and the difference between the frequencies of the levels |-,ni and 
|-,n + 1i is equal to ωa - Ω2 
a= Δa
j
j, which coincides with the frequency of the 
selected mode ωa. 
Since the transitions occur due to the interaction with the reservoir of free space 
modes, and the temperature is assumed to be zero, only transitions with a decrease in 
energy may occur. Thus, we may expect that a photon with a frequency ωa is emitted 
during the transition between eigenstates |-, ni and |-, n - 1i. In this consideration, 
the states with the transition frequency ωa arise naturally, and there is no need to 
introduce an additional virtual level. 
It can be shown (see Eq. (22.3) in Problem 1.22) that in the limit Δa

As was mentioned, the spectrum of the system oscillation S(ω) is the Fourier

example, in the dipole approximation, to calculate the radiation spectrum of a TLS, 
we need to know the correlator

Thus, we have described the algorithm for calculating the spectrum of the Rayleigh 
scattering. For this purpose, we consider scattering as a relaxation of an interacting 
atom and a photon from the selected mode to the reservoir of the other free space 
modes. We obtain the master equation for the system dynamics (Eq. (6.1.4)) and 
simplify this equation when the difference between the frequency of the selected 
mode and the atomic transition frequency is large (Eq. (6.1.8)). Note that all 
frequencies of the Jaynes-Cummings levels, determined by Eq. (2.5.33), correspond 
to real system frequencies, and there is no need to introduce a virtual level.

Rayleigh Scattering of Quantized Fields: Various 
Problem Statements 
In this section, we discuss elastic photon scattering considered by Placzek [4], 
Berestetskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii [5], and Glauber [6]. Below, we show that the 
model of a dressed atom interacting with the reservoir of free space modes repro-
duces the elasticity of the Rayleigh scattering, and if the initial state of a photon from 
the selected mode is coherent, it yields the same results as the theory in which an 
incident photon is described as a classical ﬁeld. 
Strictly speaking, to solve the problem of scattering of N photons, it is necessary 
to solve system of Eqs. (6.1.8) which takes into account the transitions between all 
Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates (6.1.6). However, usually, we only need to consider a 
transition in which the number of photons in the selected mode changes by one. We 
do this in this section within the framework of the theory developed above. 
We consider four speciﬁc cases of the scattering problem distinguished by initial 
conditions. First, we discuss the initial condition with one photon in the selected 
mode. This case corresponds to the Berestetskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii approach. This 
approach assumes that the scattering is a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step, the atom 
absorbs a photon; in the second step, it radiates a photon back into free space. We 
demonstrate that even in this case, there is no photon absorption but only damped 
Rabi oscillations. This case is difﬁcult to realize in experiment, and we only discuss 
it to clarify the physics of the phenomenon. 
Second, we study a more realistic situation with n0 incident photons and the 
transition to the state with n0 - 1 photons in the selected mode. This case corre-
sponds to Placzek’s formulation of the problem. We show that, in this case, a narrow 
spectral line arises. However, to solve the problem of scattering of n0 photons, it is 
necessary to solve system of Eq. (6.1.8), which takes into account the transitions 
between all eigenstates (6.1.6). 
In the third example, we consider the scattering of n0 photons, taking into account 
a cascade of transitions between the Jaynes-Cummings states. We show that this case 
reproduces almost all experimental features of Rayleigh scattering, including the 
narrow spectral line and the quasistationary occupancy of the atom states. However, 
the dipole moment of the atom is zero. 
Finally, to reproduce a coherent response of the atom with a nonzero dipole 
moment, we consider the case of a coherent initial state of the selected mode. We 
obtain both a narrow spectral line and a nonzero quasistationary dipole moment of 
the atom.

6.2.1 
Single-Photon Scattering: The 
Berestetskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii Formulation 
First, we assume that initially, in the selected mode, only one photon is present, i.e., 
the initial condition is n0 = 1. Such a setting was considered by Berestetskii, Lifshitz, 
and Pitaevskii [5] as a physical model for Rayleigh scattering. In this subsection, we 
show that single-photon scattering differs from classical Rayleigh scattering. 
As mentioned in Sect. 2.3, in a system consisting of an atom and a photon, 
without the interaction with the reservoir, the atom’s probability of being excited is 
σ{ tð Þσ tð Þ  = pe, and the mean number of photons is nph tð Þ ≡
a{ tð Þa tð Þ  . Such a 
system exhibits Rabi oscillations. 
Our computer simulation shows that due to the interaction of the system with the 
reservoir of free space modes, both pe(t) and nph(t) become small compared to the 
background of the Rabi oscillations (see Fig. 6.1). These terms, therefore, vanish 
from Eq. (6.1.8). From the numerical simulation, we conclude that there are two 
characteristic times in the system dynamics –

tions means that the photon from the selected mode is not absorbed.

the excited state reaches the value

Thus, when the system is far from the resonance, ωσ - ωa

n, the 
single-photon scattering is not elastic. The scattering spectrum has a narrow emis-
sion line. However, this narrow line corresponds to extremely slow radiation. 
Further, the total detectable energy emitted by the atom is ~ Ω2 
a= Δa
j
j2 , i.e., in the 
limit considered, it is also extremely small. 
We have shown that in the case of one incident photon, this photon is not 
absorbed by the atom. Namely, instead of photon absorption, at the initial stage of 
the scattering, the Rabi oscillations of both excited state population and photon 
number occur because the initial state |g, 1i is not the Jaynes-Cummings eigenstate. 
On expending |g, 1i in the sum of Jaynes-Cummings, the states |-, 1i and |+, 1i 
arise. The Rabi oscillations are described by the off-diagonal element of the

corresponding density matrix ρ(‐, 1)(+, 1). This element relaxes with time (see Problem 
1.20). After the density matrix ρ(‐, 1)(+, 1) relaxes, the system mainly occurs in the 
state |-, 1i. This state has a nonzero dipole transition with the ground state and can 
radiate interacting with the reservoir of free space modes. However, because the 
Rabi frequency tends to zero as 1= 
V
p 
, the time of radiation in the limit V →1 tends 
to inﬁnity. This contradicts experiments where the scattering process happens during 
a ﬁnite time. In the next subsection, we see that this discrepancy can be ﬁxed if one 
considers the scattering of many photons.

6.2.2 
Placzek’s Approach 
In the approach developed by Placzek, a single transition process in which the 
number of photons is changed by unity is considered. To reproduce the result of 
this approach, in system (6.1.8) we need to retain only one equation that describes 
the dynamics of the initial state |-, n0i. We assume that the initial state of the system 
is pn0 0
ð Þ = 1. Other states are assumed to be empty all the time, i.e., for 1 ≤ n < n0 
pn(0) = pn(t) = 0,. After such simpliﬁcation, the system of Eq. (6.1.8) reduces to 
d 
dt pn0 tð Þ = - γn0 pn0
ð6:2:5Þ 
The solution to this equation is pn0 tð Þ = exp - γn0 t . Using Eq. (6.1.10), for the

Quantum Description of Rayleigh Scattering of Quantized Electromagnetic Field
However, the results of the described approach differ from experimental results 
and the results of the problem formulated with the classical ﬁeld. In experiment, with 
time increase, the population of the excited state of an atom reaches the stationary 
state so that at each moment of time, some energy is radiated and some is absorbed 
from the external ﬁeld. Then, in the dependence of the population inversion on time 
disappears (or time can be set approaching inﬁnity, and the population remains 
ﬁnite). In Placzek’s result, the population of the excited state, given by Eq. (6.2.6), 
exponentially depends on time, / exp - γ rad

j2 t , and it tends to zero 
when time increases. This signiﬁes that the system transitions from the state with n0 
photons to the state with n0 - 1 photons, involving the emission of a single photon, 
and then the process stops. To ensure the correct behavior, as previously mentioned, 
one has to account for subsequent processes involving transitions between 
eigenstates and photon radiation. This is done below. 
Consider the same limit as in the previous case, Ωa ~ 1= 
V →0, n0~V → 1, 
and Ωa 
n0 
p 
→const. Above, we have taken into account only the transition between 
the states |n0, -i and |n0 - 1, -i, and have solved equations for pn0 and pn0 - 1 from 
system (6.1.8). Now, we solve the full system. 
If n0 ≫ 1, the rates of transitions between states for which |n - n0| ≪ n0 are 
approximately the same, γn = γ rad

. The number 
of photons increases with time. This reﬂects that the system has reached dynamic 
equilibrium and emits photons continuously. 
Let us compare the dynamics of the process obtained here with the dynamics in 
Placzek’s theory. In the latter, it is assumed that the system transitions from the 
initial state to a given ﬁnal state, but subsequent transitions are not considered. In the 
approach developed here, the system makes a cascade of transitions between the 
entangled states |-, n , until the system reaches its ground state |g, 0  . 
Thus, we show that when all possible transitions between the eigenstates are 
taken into account, the population inversion of the atom reaches a quasistationary 
value that does not change until a large number of photons remain in the 
selected mode.

Quantum Description of Rayleigh Scattering of Quantized Electromagnetic Field

Coherent State of the Jaynes-Cummings Modes: 
Coherent Rayleigh Scattering 
Experiments with incident laser light can be adequately described if the incident light 
is considered classical [8]. Such a description implies nonzero electric ﬁeld ampli-
tude and induced dipole moment. 
Below, we assume that the incident ﬁeld is quantized. Up to now, we assumed 
that the incident quantized light is in the Fock state, for which the expectation value 
of the electric ﬁeld operator E = 
4πħωa=V a

When we consider the ﬁeld as classical, we assume that the ﬁeld is coherent and the 
amplitude of the electric ﬁeld is nonzero, E ≠ 0. Consequently, the induced dipole 
moment has nonzero amplitude, σ ≠0 (see Eq. (3.4.32)). 
To resolve the discrepancy between Eq. (6.2.13) and the requirement E ≠ 0, we 
should design such quantum states of the incident light that are most similar to the 
classic light and reproduce the results on Rayleigh scattering of classical light 
considered in Chaps. 3 and 4. These quantum states are the coherent states discussed 
in Chap. 5. We should consider the coherent quantum state of the ﬁeld as the initial 
condition, i.e., instead of ρ 0 = g, n0 
g, n0 , take ρ 0 = g, α g, α , where

we suppose that during the time interval

Let us compare this result with the one obtained for the classical ﬁeld, which 
amplitude does not change with time (see Eq. (3.4.33)). When the difference 
between the frequency of the external ﬁeld and the TLS transition frequency, ωext -
ωσ, is much larger than the dissipation rate γσ, Eq. (3.4.33) simpliﬁes to Eq. (6.2.16):

Note that Ωaα = - deg 
4πωa=ħVα = - deg E
h i=ħ and, therefore, corresponds to 
the classical value Ωext =
- degE/ħ. Thus, Eq. (6.2.16) reproduces the result 
obtained for the classical ﬁeld. The spectrum of oscillations given by Eq. (6.2.16), 
S(ω) = (2π(Ωaα)2 /|Δa|2 )δ(ω - ωext), reproduces the spectrum of Rayleigh scattering 
of classical ﬁeld (the red vertical line in Fig. 5.4). 
To conclude, in Chap. 6, we have shown that an incidence of the quantized ﬁeld 
gives a result different from the Rayleigh scattering described classically. Namely, 
due to quantum ﬂuctuations, scattered light has a ﬁnite linewidth. Although the 
linewidth of the scattered ﬁeld is ﬁnite, it is nevertheless much narrower than the 
spontaneous emission line. 
The inelastic scattering of a quantized ﬁeld is caused by the fact that in order to 
radiate, a quantum system must interact with a reservoir of free space modes. It is this 
interaction that can change the frequency of emitted photons. In classical physics, 
the inﬂuence of this interaction on the external ﬁeld is neglected, and the scattering is 
elastic. This inﬂuence is especially strong in the single-photon scattering, in which it 
leads to the disappearance of the incident ﬁeld. If the number of incident photons is 
ﬁnite, even if only one photon is scattered, we have a ﬁnite linewidth. Moreover, 
when an incident wave is coherent, a ﬁnite linewidth arises due to a decrease in the 
total number of photons in the incident state.

Chapter 7 
Summary of Part I 
Often, photon scattering is considered as a particular case of the spectroscopic theory 
of absorption and emission of photons during the transition of an atom between its 
states. This theory assumes that the transitions are caused by the incident ﬁeld. In the 
ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory, according to Fermi’s golden rule, the proba-
bility of the transition between initial and ﬁnal states, which is caused by the dipole 
interaction V = - d  E, is proportional to 
ih jV fj i
2 
[1]. For elastic scattering, the 
matrix elements of the dipole moment between the same atomic states are zero, 
ih jV fj i
2 
= 0; therefore, one usually employs the second order of the perturbation 
theory. The resulting formula interprets the elastic scattering of light as a two-step 
process. In the ﬁrst step, the atom in the ground state absorbs an incident photon and 
transitions to an excited state, which is a superposition of excited atomic states. In the 
second step, the excited atom emits a photon. 
In Part I, we have shown that such an often-used scheme, in which transitions 
between states of a quantum system are caused by an external resonant ﬁeld, is not 
applicable to Hermitian systems. Indeed, if an atom and a single mode of incident 
light comprise a closed interacting Hermitian system (a dressed atom), we observe 
the endlessly repeating energy exchange between the atom and the mode [2, 3]. To 
study such an exchange, we cannot restrict ourselves to the ﬁrst or second orders of 
the perturbation theory but should consider the whole series. 
Our approach is based on the fact that continuous energy exchange within the 
dressed atom does not require an exact match of the energy difference between 
eigenstates and the photon energy. Radiation or light scattering by the atom occurs; it 
introduces a new participant—a photon in the mode distinct from the incident one. 
Moreover, in this part, the irreversible radiation of a photon requires a continuum of 
additional modes. 
To conclude, we consider the illuminated system (atom or molecule) and 
scattered (incident) mode of light as an open quantum system interacting with the 
reservoir of free space modes. The problem of light scattering becomes much more

complex than the problems solved in Bohr’s scheme. To avoid dealing with an 
inﬁnite number of reservoir states, in Part I, we search for the solution to the 
scattering problem in two steps. First, following well-known algorithms [4, 5], we 
describe the interaction with the reservoir by introducing dissipative and noise terms. 
As a result, the dynamics of the dressed atom has to be described by the Lindblad 
equation or the Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations. In physical terms, this 
implies that scattering is achieved through interaction with a reservoir of free space 
modes.

Summary of Part I
As demonstrated in Sects. 12.2 and 12.3, the scattering spectrum is interpreted as 
a perturbation of the reservoir of free space modes. The associated damping con-
stants and noise amplitudes are found while excluding the reservoir variables from 
the equations for a closed system comprised of the dressed atom and the reservoir of 
free space modes. 
Subsequently, we solve the resulting equations, but the solution only describes 
the evolution of the dressed atom. Because we utilize the Born approximation to 
exclude the reservoir variables, the radiation spectrum cannot be found at this step. 
To ﬁnd the spectrum, we solve the problem of photon emission by the dressed 
atom. We imply that the perturbation of the reservoir modes is induced by the dipole 
moment of the dressed atom, which is found in the previous step. In our case, this is 
the reservoir of free space modes that do not include the incident ﬁeld.

Problem 1.1 
Show that in the Schrödinger picture, a TLS interacting with a single mode of a 
monochromatic external ﬁeld is in the regime of Rabi oscillations.

The unperturbed TLS is described by the time-independent Hamiltonian H0 with 
only two orthogonal eigenstates:

which correspond to the excited state with the wave function jei having the energy 
Ee = ħωe and the ground state with the wave function jgi, whose energy is Eg = ħωg.

Problem 1.4 
Find the matrix elements of the operators ^a and ^a{ in the Fock basis.

Let us consider a 1D harmonic oscillator which Hamiltonian has the form:

:
ð8:4:1Þ 
where coordinate and momentum operators satisfy the commutation relation 
^Q, ^P = iħ
ð8:4:2Þ 
It is convenient to introduce the annihilation operator ^a and the creation operator ^a{ 
as linear combinations of the coordinate and momentum operators: 
^a = 
mω^Q þ i^P

ð8:4:3Þ 
^a{ = 
mω^Q - i^P

ð8:4:4Þ 
Using Eq. (8.4.2) one can see that 
^a, ^a{ =^I

We also have the inverse transformation: 
^Q =

2mω ^a þ ^a{ ,
^P = - i

ð8:4:6Þ 
In terms of operators ^a and ^a{ , the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator can be 
rewritten as 
^H = - 1 
4 ħω ^a - ^a{ 2 þ 1

2 ħω ^a{ ^a þ a^a{ = ħω ^a{ ^a þ 1

Next, we introduce the operator of the number of quanta: 
^N = ^a{ ^a:
ð8:4:8Þ 
Using Eq. (8.4.5), we obtain the following commutation relations for the involved 
operators: 
^N, ^a = ^a{ ^a, ^a = ^a{ ^a^a - ^a^a{ ^a = ^a{ ^a - ^a^a{ ^a = - ^a 
or 
^N^a = ^a^N - ^a

For the eigenfunction of the operator ^N, ^N νj i = ν νj i, we have: 
^N^a νj i = ^a^N - ^a νj i = ^a ^N - ^1 νj i = ν - 1
ð
Þ^a νj i:
ð8:4:11Þ 
This means that if ^a νj i ≠^0, then ^a νj i  is the eigenvector of the operator ^N with the 
eigenvalue (ν - 1).

h j^a{ ^a νj i = ν
h j^N νj i = ν ν
h νj i ≥0
ð8:4:12Þ 
we see that all the eigenvalues of the operator ^N should be nonnegative. 
After each application of the operator ^a, we decrease the eigenvalue of the 
operator ^N by 1. At some point, we encounter a negative value; this, however, is 
impossible because, according to Eq. (8.4.12), ν ≥ 0. Therefore, to preserve the latter 
condition, we must assume that there is such a vector, the action of the operator ^a on 
which gives zero. We denote such a vector by 0 
^a 0j i = 0j i, 
^N 0j i = 0
ð8:4:13Þ 
Similarly, 
^N^a

h νj i > 0:
ð8:4:15Þ 
Thus, the vector ^a{ νj idiffers from j0i and is the eigenvector of ^N with the eigenvalue 
(ν + 1). The application of the operator ^a{ to an eigenvector obtained in the previous 
step turns this vector into an eigenvector whose eigenvalue is increased by 1. The 
ﬁrst eigenvector to which the operator ^a{ should be applied is j0i, which has a zero 
eigenvalue. This implies that the spectrum of the operator ^N consists of the numbers 
0, 1, 2, . . .  . Denoting the orthonormal eigenvectors of the operator ^N by jni, 
we have: 
^N  nj i = n nj i, 
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
ð8:4:16Þ 
In particular, the vector ^a{ ν should be proportional to n + 1 :

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (8.5.1) do not change the number of excitations. The last 
term, as shown in Eq. (8.5.7), also does not change the number of excitations. Thus, 
we have

The primitive cell of the volume in k-space is (Δk)3 = (2π)3 /L3 and 
Δω = cΔk = c/(2πL), then in the limit V → 1, the frequency difference of the 
adjacent modes tends to zero, and in Eq. (8.6.1), we can replace the summation over 
k by integration using the standard summation rule:

If the problem has spherical symmetry, and calculated quantity does not depend on

has the meaning of the density of states of free space modes of EM ﬁeld. 
The problem under consideration, however, depends on the polarization 
and does not have spherical symmetry because the Rabi interaction constant 
Ωk,α = 
2πωk=ħVek,α . deg depends on the direction of the electric ﬁeld polariza-
tion. Thus, we cannot directly use this density of states. Instead, we should perform 
explicit integration over solid angle and sum up over possible polarization directions 
the quantity Ωk, α. 
To do it, we ﬁrst change the sum in Eq. (8.6.1) to the integrals over the wave

where (φ, θ, k) are the polar coordinates in k-space and k = ω/c. 
To obtain an analytical expression, we, ﬁrst, perform the summation over

{e1, e2, n}; e1 and e2 are possible vectors of linear polarization, n = k/jkj:

This value is the Lamb shift of the TLS transition frequency. This shift arises due to 
the interaction of the TLS with vacuum ﬂuctuations of free space modes. Formally, 
integral (8.6.15) diverges. The physical meaning of this divergence is caused by the

inapplicability of the nonrelativistic Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian at high frequen-
cies, when photons emitted by the TLS are capable of producing virtual electron-
positron pairs with energy ħωk ≈ 2mc2 , where m is the electron mass. An accurate 
calculation of the Lamb shift ΔLω can be carried out only by QED methods, taking 
into account relativistic and radiative corrections.

First, we consider the properties of the solution to the Lindblad equation. We start 
from the initial density matrix in the form: 
^ρ 0
ð Þ = ^ρS 0
ð Þ ⊗^ρth 
R ,
ð8:9:1Þ 
where ^ρS tð Þ  is the system density matrix; ^ρth 
R = exp - ^HR=kT is the density matrix 
of the reservoir, which is in thermal equilibrium; and ⊗denotes the direct product of 
matrices. In the Schrödinger picture, the total density matrix ρ(t) satisﬁes the von 
Neumann equation: 
∂^ρ 
∂t = - 1

^HS þ ^HR þ ^HSR , ρ , 
and therefore, it can be presented as

ð8:9:2Þ 
In the framework of the Born-Markov approximation, we assume that the reservoir is 
in thermal equilibrium and its density matrix obeys Gibbs distribution. For the 
system density matrix, we obtain the Lindblad master equation, which takes into 
account dissipation due to interaction with the reservoir through the interaction 
Hamiltonian ^HSR = ħκ^S^R(see Eq. (3.2.7) from Sect. 3.2 and the discussion following 
this equation). This means that the density matrix of the system and reservoir has 
the form:

where ^PL t2; t1
ð

is the propagator of the Lindblad master equation. In the Born 
approximation, the reservoir density matrix is constant, and we can use Eq. (8.9.3). 
Moreover, in this approximation, we suppose that Eqs. (8.9.3) and (8.9.2) are 
equivalent (see Sect. 3.2 of Раrt I), i.e.,

Solution 
As we show in Sect. 3.4, in the dipole approximation, the Hamiltonian of the 
interaction of the TLS with the reservoir of free space electromagnetic modes can 
be written as 
^H = ħωσ^σ{ ^σ þ ħ 
k 
ωk^a{ 
k^ak þ ħ 
k 
Ωk ^a{ 
k^σ þ ^σ{ ^ak
ð8:10:7Þ 
Here ^ak and ^a{ 
k are operators of annihilation and creation of the mode with the wave 
vector k and frequency ωk; Ωk = - dTLS . Ek/ħ is the coupling constant of the TLS 
dipole moment dTLS and the k-th mode electric of the ﬁeld Ek. Recall that ^d = deg 
^σ 
^σ{ (Sect. 2.1, Eq. (2.3.23)). 
Using the Heisenberg equation 
d^A 
dt = ∂^A 
∂t þ i 
ħ 
^H, ^A , 
we can obtain the Heisenberg equations for the operators of the TLS dipole moment 
^σ, the TLS inversion ^D = ^σ{ ^σ - ^σ^σ{ , and the ﬁeld amplitude in the k-th mode ^ak:

This is the rate of spontaneous radiation that has been calculated in Problem 1.6. 
Now, let us show now that the correlation properties of operators ^Fσ, ^Fσ{, ^FD are 
similar to those for white noise. To do this, we need to compute the average of the 
simultaneous and two-time average values of the operators. We assume that the 
reservoir at all times is in the state of thermal equilibrium and its density matrix has 
the form: 
^ρth 
R = exp - ^HR=kT =Tr exp - ^HR=kT

According to Eq. (8.11.3), ^σ{ ^σ does not depend on time, so that ^σ{ τð Þ^σ τð Þ = 
^σ{ tð Þ^σ tð Þ = ^σ{ ^σ; thus, while calculating the integral, ^σ{ ^σ can be factored out. After

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side can be approximately evaluated with the help of 
the Markov approximation. Namely, the function exp(iωm(t - τ)) is fast oscillating 
except for the point in the vicinity of the upper limit of the integral, τ = t. Thus, only 
the neighborhood of this point makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the integral. For 
this reason, we can expand the lower limit to negative inﬁnity:

p0 ^Q - q0 ^P , ξ = 1, and ^X = ^Q, the left-hand side of Eq. (8.14.4) becomes 
eY ^Qe - Y; then, employing the Lie product formula, we obtain: 
eY ^Qe - Y = ^Q þ Y, ^Q þ ^Y, ^Y, Q

One can see that for the dynamics of the diagonal elements, only transitions with a 
decrease in energy are possible. This is a consequence of our assumption that the free

Since the transitions occur due to the interaction with the reservoir of free space 
modes, and the temperature is assumed to be zero, only transitions with a decrease in 
the energy (in the n) are possible (see Eq. (8.20.2)). The change in the value of the 
matrix element ρ þ,n0,
ð

þ,n0

can occur due to transitions with greater n. Therefore, 
since at the initial moment we have ρ(±, n)(±, n)(0) = 0, n > n0, the matrix element 
ρ

dynamics of the amplitude of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix is 
found; see Eqs. (8.20.5)–(8.20.10). Particularly, the amplitude of the off-diagonal 
element j-, n - 1ih-, nj evolves according to Eq. (8.20.8). Using this equation, we 
can write the solution to the Lindblad equation with the initial condition (8.22.2) in

In expansion (8.23.1) of the density matrix over eigenstates, there are all kinds of 
off-diagonal elements. Equation (6.1.2) from the main text shows that to calculate 
the average dipole moment, we need to know the dynamics of not all off-diagonal 
matrix elements, but only ρ(g, 0)(+, 1), ρ(+, n - 1)(+, n), ρ(-, n - 1)(+, n), and ρ(-, n - 1)(-, n).

Problems for Part I

The Raman Effect

Chapter 9 
Introduction 
In the ﬁrst part, we considered the elastic scattering of light by atoms. Our approach 
is based on the concept that a scatterer (an atom or a molecule) and incident photons 
belonging to the selected EM mode form a closed system—a “dressed” atom with its 
own stationary states. Without interacting with the reservoir of free space modes, the 
dressed atom can neither emit nor absorb additional photons. It is the EM ﬁeld of free 
space modes that causes transitions between the dressed atom eigenstates. 
We also have seen that only a continuum of degrees of freedom of the reservoir 
makes irreversible transitions between the states of an atom possible. Therefore, we 
focus on reservoirs containing a continuum of modes. 
The reservoir modes can couple with each other via the atom. Since dealing with a 
continuum of unknowns is difﬁcult, we split the problem into two parts. First, we 
study the variables belonging to the atom. The system of equations for these vari-
ables is not closed because the dressed atom interacts with the reservoir of free space 
modes. At this stage, we assume that the reservoir is in equilibrium. After excluding 
the reservoir variables, we obtain new equations for the atom variables. Depending 
on whether we work in the Heisenberg or Schrödinger pictures, these are either 
Heisenberg-Langevin or Lindblad equations. In these equations, the action of the 
reservoir on the atom is described by dissipative and noise terms. The solution to the 
resulting equation describes the relaxation of the dressed atom state. Second, we 
focus our attention on the reservoir. During the relaxation, the dressed atom 
exchanges photons with the reservoir of free space modes. Substituting the dressed 
atom variables obtained at the ﬁrst step into equations for free space modes, we 
calculate the disturbances of the modes, which represent a spectrum of scattered 
radiation. 
In the second part of the book, the approach described in Part I is applied to 
inelastic light scattering. Unlike elastic (Rayleigh) scattering, during inelastic scat-
tering, the frequency of the scattered light differs from that of the incident light. Such 
a frequency change occurring due to the change in the kinetic energy of the atom was 
considered by Compton [1].

Introduction
Smekal [2] was the ﬁrst to consider the inelastic scattering of photons associated 
with a change in the internal energy of the atom, along with a change in its kinetic 
energy. He assumed that the change in the atom’s internal energy is caused by 
nonradiative transitions of the atom between electronic eigenstates (see also Ref. 
[3]). This work was often cited as a prediction of the Raman effect [4–13]. Without 
diminishing the importance of Smekal’s work, in which he predicted the 
off-resonant excitation of the atom and the need to take into account atom’s recoil 
during radiation, we emphasize that Smekal’s effect should also be observed for 
isolated atoms. Essentially, Smekal did not provide any indication that intramolec-
ular vibrations of atoms might cause inelastic scattering. The effect of such vibra-
tions on light scattering is associated with the name of Indian physicist C.V. Raman, 
who was the ﬁrst to observe it in gases and liquids [9]. 
Raman initially set out to experimentally validate the theory of the Compton 
effect in optics. However, rather than observing the anticipated weak optical effect, 
he discovered a more prominent phenomenon. In Raman’s experiments, it was 
“shown that in every case in which light is scattered by the molecules in dust-free 
liquids or gases, the diffuse (scattered) radiation of the ordinary kind, having the 
same wavelength as the incident beam, is accompanied by a modiﬁed scattered 
radiation of degraded frequency” [8–10]. (The line observed by Raman is called the 
Stokes line.) 
Concurrently with the Raman group, in the Soviet Union, Mandelstam and 
Landsberg worked on the closely related problem of detecting the ﬁne structure in 
the Rayleigh spectrum of light scattered by solids. They assumed that such a ﬁne 
structure was due to the modulation of scattered light by elastic thermal waves, in 
accordance with the Debye theory. Speciﬁcally, Landsberg and Mandelstam studied 
the scattering of the mercury lamp light by a quartz crystal. They reported [6] that in 
the scattering spectrum, each line of the spectrum of mercury is accompanied by a 
couple of weak satellites—one with the violet shift (the anti-Stokes line) and the 
other one with the red shift (the Stokes line) (see Fig. 9.1). They expressed doubts 
about the connection between their and Raman’s results but offered no explanation 
for their observations. They only suggested that the phenomenon must be of a 
quantum nature because they conducted experiments at low temperatures compared 
to the energy of the observed quanta. 
Raman’s works instantly evoked a response in the world scientiﬁc community. In 
France, Rocard’s and Cabannes’ groups looked for the Raman effect using a 
low-power installation [4, 5, 11]. However, the works of these groups only contained 
some theoretical ideas about the phenomenon, attributing this novel effect to optical 
modulation by the oscillating molecule. In Ref. [11], the effect was described as 
“optical beating.” Importantly, in these works, the Raman effect associated with the 
pure rotational motion of molecules was predicted. 
In the United States, Wood investigated resonant light emission in various 
materials. After Raman published his paper, Wood looked through his previously 
obtained photographic plates and found additional red-shifted lines similar to 
Raman’s. He also observed the lines with violet shift in frequencies [12]. Wood 
introduced the term “anti-Stokes” for scattered light, whose quanta have higher 
energy than the incident light.

with the eigenfrequency ωv 
In the Raman effect, the scattered light spectrum is characterized by two satellite 
lines equidistantly shifted from the centerline by the so-called Stokes frequency 
shifts [14–33]. The centerline is associated with the elastic Rayleigh scattering. The 
shifts are small compared to the frequency of the incident wave and the frequencies 
of optical transitions in a molecule. Since the shifts do not depend on the frequency 
of the incident light, they have been associated with some “hidden” vibrational states 
of the molecule. 
“Hidden” implies that the vibration of nuclei in a molecule cannot be directly 
excited by infrared (IR) radiation. The matrix elements of dipole moments between 
the vibrational states are assumed to be zero. Such a molecule is referred to as 
Raman-active. When the matrix elements of the dipole moment between the mole-
cule vibrational states are nonzero, the vibrational states can be excited by 
IR radiation. Such molecules are called IR-active. 
According to the classical theory, the modulation of the dipole moment leads to 
the emergence of two sidelines. If a nonpolar molecule is placed in an external 
electric ﬁeld E, positive and negative charges move in opposite directions, inducing 
a dipole moment d, which should be modulated by low-frequency oscillations of 
atoms inside a molecule. If the electric ﬁeld of such a dipole is weak compared to 
intramolecular ﬁelds, the displacements of charges are small, and the resulting dipole 
moment is proportional to the external ﬁeld: 
d = αE, 
where α is the molecule polarizability.

Introduction
Since the induced dipole moment oscillates with the frequency of the external 
ﬁeld ωext, it radiates light of the same frequency (Rayleigh scattering). When the 
scatterer is a molecule, we have to take into account the possible vibrations of nuclei 
in the molecule. Since the nuclear mass is about 2000 times greater than that of an 
electron, the mobility of electrons is much greater than that of nuclei. In experiments 
on the Raman scattering, the characteristic frequency ωv of nucleus oscillations in 
molecules is much smaller than the frequency ωext of the incident ﬁeld, and the 
electrons have time to adjust to the change in the positions of nuclei. Consequently, 
the electronic polarizability of the molecule is periodically modulated:

The last term in this equation corresponds to the two sidelines in the radiation 
spectrum of the dipole moment. These sidelines are equidistant from the frequency 
ωext, and their frequencies, ωext - ωv and ωext + ωv, determine the Stokes and anti-
Stokes lines, respectively [13]. Equation (9.1.1) shows that the emergence of 
sidelines in Raman scattering can be associated with the parametric modulation of 
the electronic subsystem of the molecule by nucleus vibrations. Below, we show that 
the consistent quantum mechanical description conﬁrms the parametric nature of the 
Raman scattering. According to Eq. (9.1.1), the intensities of the sidelines should be 
identical. Experiments, however, show that the Stokes signal is much stronger than 
the anti-Stokes. 
To explain the difference between the amplitudes of the Stokes and anti-Stokes 
scattering, the methods of quantum mechanics are required. According to the Bohr 
theory of atoms, no radiation arises when an electron is at a certain energy level. The 
radiation only occurs when the electron “jumps” from one unperturbed quantum 
level corresponding to the energy E1 to another unperturbed level with the lower 
energy E2. The released energy Δ = E1 - E2 is assumed to be emitted as a photon 
with the energy ħω = Δ. The interaction of light and an atom is considered as an act 
of resonant absorption or emission of a photon during the transition of the atom from 
one eigenstate to another. This picture served as the basis for creating the theory of 
spectroscopy. 
Based on the Bohr theory of transitions between quantum states, the quantum 
mechanical description of Raman scattering faced some technical and fundamental 
difﬁculties. The technical problem is tied to the necessity of taking into account 
vibrations of the molecule nuclei. By the time of the discovery of Raman scattering, 
the quantum theory of vibrational and rotational spectra in molecules was still under 
development (see Ref. [34] and references therein). Unifying this theory with the 
theory of optical transitions is a very cumbersome problem that still does not have a

rigorous general solution. One of the most important simpliﬁcations of this problem 
comes from the application of the adiabatic approximation, which, for quantum 
mechanics, was developed by Born and Oppenheimer [34]. Applying this approx-
imation, we can solve the part of the problem related to the electronic subsystem, 
ignoring nuclear motion; then, we use the obtained mean distribution of electrons to 
determine the effective potential of nuclear motion. As a result, we arrive at the well-
known Morse curve and Jablonski diagram of vibrational levels [35–37] (see 
Fig. 9.2). Below, the quantum of the vibrations of molecular nuclei is referred to 
as a vibron.

Remark 9.1: Phonons The concept of the quasiparticle arises in many-
particle problems when properties of a microscopically complex system, 
such as a semiconductor, may be described as if the system contains various 
weakly interacting particles. 
For example, a charge transfer through a semiconductor or metal is due to 
the movement of all the electrons interacting with each other and with atomic 
nuclei. This movement can be represented as the motion of noninteracting 
electrons with effective masses different from the mass of a free electron 
traveling in vacuum. Such an electron is called an electron quasiparticle 
[38]. Other examples of quasiparticles are phonons and vibrons. 
Phonons are quasiparticles that describe the collective vibrational modes of 
atoms arranged in a periodic crystal lattice structure. When the atoms vibrate, 
they create waves of atomic displacements propagating through the lattice. 
These waves are quantized, and their quanta are called phonons.

Introduction
Remark 9.1 (continued)
Mathematically, phonons are associated with quantized normal modes of 
the crystal lattice. Each normal mode represents a speciﬁc vibrational pattern 
with a characteristic wave vector k and frequency ω(k). Phonons can exhibit 
different polarizations α, indicating vibrations in different directions relative to 
the direction of wave vector k. 
According to the polarization, phonons can be classiﬁed into longitudinal 
and transverse modes. Longitudinal phonons, which also occur in gases and 
ﬂuids, involve vibrations where the atoms move parallel to the wave vector k, 
while transverse phonons occur when the atom vibrations are perpendicular 
to k. 
Since the quantization of phonons can be reduced to the quantization of a 
quantum oscillator (see Part I), phonons are bosons. As a result of the 
quantization of transverse phonons, a discrete set of allowed energy bands 
E = ħω(k) appears. These bands are often separated by band gaps. In the 
allowed bands, k(ω) is a real vector, while in the band gaps (forbidden bands), 
k(ω) is purely imaginary. The number of the allowed bands is equal to the 
number of atoms in the elementary cell of the crystal. 
For simplest structures with one atom per cell, there is only one band of 
so-called acoustic phonons. In crystal lattices that contain two or more atoms 
within an elementary cell, there are additional energy bands of optical phonons 
with frequencies ω(k) higher than those in the acoustic band. 
A closely related counterpart to the phonon is the vibron. Vibron charac-
terizes a quantized oscillation of the bond connecting atoms in the molecule. 
The distinction between vibrons and phonons is not always sharply deﬁned, 
and these terms are frequently used interchangeably. 
The adiabatic approximation implies that the Hamiltonian of a molecule can be 
presented as a sum of the Hamiltonians of electronic and nuclear subsystems, and the 
eigenenergies of the molecule states as sums of the electronic energies and the 
quantized energies of nuclear vibrations (horizontal lines in Fig. 9.2). Such an 
approach implies that there are the eigenstates of a “dressed by vibrons” molecule 
and that the wave function of such a state can be presented as a product of the wave 
functions of electrons and vibrating nuclei. 
Within the framework of this approximation, Raman scattering received the 
following explanation. Let us assume that the energy of the state, in which there 
are neither electronic nor molecular vibronic excitations, is equal to zero (the ground 
state in Fig. 9.3). It was assumed that a molecule could transition from the ground 
state to the state with the energy ħωext by absorbing a photon with the same energy 
(this transition is shown by the ﬁrst blue arrow in Fig. 9.3). Then, the molecule emits 
a photon with the energy ħωext - ħωv and transitions to the state with one exited 
vibron (the green arrow in Fig. 9.3). The emitted photon is the Stokes photon.

Introduction

Fig. 9.3 A Jablonski diagram of Raman scattering. The blue arrows correspond to photons having 
the frequency of the incident photon, the green arrow depicts the emitted photon that excites a 
vibron, and the red arrow corresponds to the emitted photon that absorbed one vibron 
If a molecule initially in the state with one exited vibron absorbs a photon with the 
energy ħωext and transitions back to the ground state (the red arrow in Fig. 9.3), then 
the radiated photon should have the energy ħωext + ħωv. This is the anti-Stokes 
photon. Since such a scheme involves two photons (absorbed and emitted), it is 
called a two-photon scheme. 
The population of the state with one excited vibron is less than that of the ground 
state by the factor exp(-ħωv/kT). The difference in populations is responsible for the 
difference between Stokes and ant-Stokes intensities. 
The fundamental problem, common for Rayleigh and Raman scatterings, has 
been discussed in Part I. The direct application of the Bohr approach assumes that 
during the scattering, a photon with a given energy can be absorbed. This requires a 
resonant level, which is generally absent. Therefore, an additional virtual level is 
usually introduced to satisfy this requirement. This approach is phenomenologically 
clear, as the transition concept can be described within the Bohr theory. However, 
the emergence of virtual levels is not founded; their presence is a phenomenological 
assumption. The second weak point of the approach is that Raman scattering is 
observed in Raman-active molecules. This means that there is no dipole transition 
between vibrational levels. All IR transitions are forbidden. Consequently, in the 
adiabatic theory, the transitions between states with different excited vibration levels 
are also forbidden. 
Raman signals originating from incoherent light sources exhibit inherent weak-
ness. The introduction of lasers, emitting high-intensity coherent light, not only 
enabled the proportional enhancement of Raman responses with incident light 
intensity but also unveiled novel coherence-related effects. 
The propagation of coherent laser signals through Raman-active media gives rise 
to the coherent Stokes signal, a phenomenon associated with stimulated Raman 
scattering (SRS) [39]. Additionally, illuminating Raman-active media with two 
coherent light beams, featuring a frequency difference equal to the vibron frequency,

gives rise to coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) [40] (see also Refs. 
[14, 22, 23, 41]). Importantly, CARS exacerbates the challenges posed by the 
adiabatic theory. 
188

Introduction
Fig. 9.4 The Jablonski diagram of CARS 
In CARS, one uses two incident beams of coherent light with frequencies ωp (the 
pump frequency) and ωs (the signal frequency). The difference in these frequencies 
ωp - ωs equals the eigenfrequency ωv of the nuclear vibration. To describe CARS, 
the adiabatic approach requires two more virtual levels [24] (see Fig. 9.4). 
The ﬁrst quantum explanation of CARS was based on the concept of virtual 
levels. This theory [42] assumes that a photon with the energy ħωp excites the 
molecule from the ground state to the ﬁrst virtual state. The signal beam of energy 
ħωs stimulates the transition from the ﬁrst virtual level to the state with the energy 
ħωv (see the diagram in Fig. 9.4), which is the state with one excited vibron. Another 
photon with the energy ħωp is then used to excite the molecule from this state to the 
second virtual state with the energy ħ(ωp + ωv). The spontaneous transition from the 
latter state returns the molecule to the ground state and results in emitting an anti-
Stokes photon. Since four photons are involved in this scheme, it is often called the 
“four-photon scheme.” This consideration suffers from the same shortcomings as the 
spontaneous Raman scattering explanation. Moreover, the theory says nothing about 
coherence. It is unclear why, at the spontaneous Raman effect, the transition from 
virtual levels to ground state results in an incoherent outcome, while in CARS, such 
a transition makes the response coherent. 
High intensity of laser radiation allows us to step back and employ the semiclas-
sical description of a molecule [43, 44], which resorts to the methods of nonlinear 
optics developed for classical ﬁelds, in which the ﬁelds are assumed to be coherent 
[15, 24, 42]. These methods assume that there is a nonlinearity described by 
susceptibility of the third order χ(3) . 
This approach considers that in the CARS scheme, beats of the intensity appear at 
the frequency ωp - ωs. Due to the parametric interaction of electronic and vibronic 
subsystems, these beats resonantly excite vibrons in the molecule. Thus, along with

thermal vibrons, coherent vibrons arise. The coherent vibron contributions are 
responsible for coherent Raman scattering. 
9
Introduction
189
In contrast to the spontaneous Raman scattering, in CARS, both Stokes and anti-
Stokes components become partially coherent. The main advantage of CARS is that 
the contribution of the coherent signal is increased as a square of the number N of the 
illuminated molecules, while incoherent intensity increases linearly. If N is greater 
than 106 - 107 , the coherent component prevails. Under the standard conditions, 
1 cm3 of material contains 1019 atoms; this number is large enough for the coherent 
part of the signal to be signiﬁcant (see Sect. 13.3 for details). 
To conclude, neither classical nor the abovementioned quantum approaches 
provide a consistent description of quantum inelastic scattering. However, consid-
erable theoretical progress has been recently made in studies of the direct interaction 
between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of a molecule [45–48]. It has 
been understood that the description of the optical inelastic properties of molecules 
requires an explicit consideration of the interaction between electronic and vibronic 
degrees of freedom. 
An effective approach to solving the problem with a high number of degrees of 
freedom is to use phenomenological considerations. In particular, when describing 
complex quantum systems, various types of model Hamiltonians are used. For 
example, to describe phenomena occurring in complex molecules subjected to 
external forces, the optical-mechanical Hamiltonian has recently been used [49–51]. 
In this book, we use the Fröhlich Hamiltonian to study various Raman phenom-
ena. This Hamiltonian is a well-established tool in solid-state physics, particularly in 
the study of electron-phonon interactions [52–54]. Importantly, recent research has 
demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in resolving issues related to Raman 
scattering [55–57]. 
In Part I, we consider the forced motion of a quantum system under the inﬂuence 
of an external force; we show that the interaction of a TLS with a single light mode 
results in driven oscillation of the TLS dipole moment with the frequency of the 
external ﬁeld. Such a driven response is modulated with an off-resonant Rabi 
frequency. 
In this part, we generalize the approach developed for considering the modulation 
of the Rayleigh scattering by the frequency of intramolecular oscillations. We 
employ the Fröhlich Hamiltonian to analyze various effects of Raman scattering, 
such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), surface-enhanced Raman 
scattering (SERS), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and Raman lasing 
[49, 56]. Special attention is paid to the coherence of the emitted light. We consider 
the ﬁrst-order coherence usually associated with obtaining interference fringes when 
two ﬁelds are superimposed. 
In Chap. 10, we derive the Hamiltonian that governs the interaction between 
photons and vibrons in a molecule, focusing on its application in the context of 
Raman scattering. To simplify our analysis, we employ a hydrogen molecule as a 
model system. The extension of the derivation to more complex molecules, while 
technically intricate, remains conceptually straightforward. Our investigation centers 
around the utilization of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian to explore various Raman 
phenomena.

Introduction
Chapter 11 focuses on spontaneous Raman scattering. Building upon the molec-
ular Hamiltonian established in the preceding chapter, we introduce an additional 
term accounting for the interaction between the electronic subsystem and an external 
electromagnetic ﬁeld. We also consider the interactions of both the electronic and 
vibronic subsystems with reservoirs. 
Employing the Born-Markov approximation, we effectively eliminate operators 
associated with the reservoirs’ degrees of freedom, enabling the derivation of the 
Heisenberg-Langevin equations for all pertinent operators. To address this complex 
system of nonlinear operator equations, we develop a perturbation theory. This 
approach provides us with the necessary tools to describe the Raman effect within 
this framework. 
In Chap. 12, we explore surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), a highly 
effective technique for amplifying Raman signals. This phenomenon stems from the 
localized enhancement of the scattered ﬁeld, driven by plasmonic resonance. 
Within this chapter, we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind the ampli-
ﬁcation of Raman signals. Two critical factors come into play: ﬁrst, the intensiﬁca-
tion of the incident electric ﬁeld’s strength, due to plasmonic resonance, and the 
augmentation of radiated intensity, driven by the Purcell effect. 
In Chap. 13, we study the phenomenon where a Raman-active molecule is 
illuminated by two coherent waves, speciﬁcally the pumping and signal waves. 
The interaction between the pump wave and the molecule leads to the transfer of 
energy to the signal wave. This outcome is described by using nonlinear optics, 
utilizing the third-order nonlinear susceptibility. In the literature, this effect is 
commonly referred to as Raman ampliﬁcation. 
Additionally, this chapter delves into the realm of coherent anti-Stokes Raman 
scattering (CARS) from both quantum and semiclassical perspectives. We determine 
the amplitude of the CARS signal and analyze the conditions that foster 
ampliﬁcation. 
Chapter 14 delves into the manifestation of the Raman effect within conventional 
lasers. We demonstrate that when the interaction constant between the electronic and 
vibronic subsystems surpasses a critical value, a second lasing threshold emerges. 
Above this threshold, the laser spectrum undergoes a transformation, featuring 
distinct characteristic frequencies shifted from the conventional laser frequencies. 
Additionally, the interplay with other parameters leads to the prediction of diverse 
lasing regimes, including the possibility of a chaotic regime.

Chapter 10 
The Hamiltonian of the Interaction Between 
Electronic and Nuclear Subsystems of a 
Molecule 
In this chapter, we derive the Hamiltonian of the light-molecule interaction that 
describes Raman scattering. For simplicity, we consider a hydrogen molecule. The 
generalization to more complex molecules is technically more complicated but 
conceptually straightforward. 
Our immediate goal is to ﬁnd a mechanism leading to Raman scattering of light 
on molecules. We show that in a Raman-active molecule, light directly interacts only 
with electrons, not nuclei. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Raman scattering is inelastic, 
and the electronic subsystem of a molecule radiates at two additional frequencies 
along with the frequency of incident light. The Raman frequency shifts are indepen-
dent of the frequency of the incident light and are determined by the natural 
frequency of vibrations of molecular nuclei. This indicates that the system Hamil-
tonian should include the interaction between oscillations of the electronic 
subsystem and nuclear vibration. 
A hydrogen molecule consists of two nuclei and two electrons. In the reference 
frame, whose origin is at the center of mass of nuclei, in nonrelativistic approxima-
tion, the system is described by the Hamiltonian:

where R is the distance between the nuclei; pi and ri are the momentum and the 
position of the ith electron, respectively; P is the total momentum of the nuclei; 
±R/2 = ± nR/2 are the position vectors of the nuclei (Fig. 10.1); n is a unit vector 
pointing along the molecule; M is the reduced mass of the nuclei; e is an electron 
charge; and E(t) is the external electric ﬁeld. The sum in parentheses of Eq. (10.1.1) 
includes the kinetic energy of electrons and the energies of their interaction with 
protons and the external electric ﬁeld. The term e2 /|r1 - r2| is Coulomb’s interaction

is the total energy of Coulomb’s interaction of all involved charges. 
As we discussed in the Introduction, one can use the Born-Oppenheimer approx-
imation and consider the motion of electrons and nuclei separately using different 
Schrödinger equations. This approximation implies that the sum of the Hamiltonians 
of these equations is the Hamiltonian of the molecule. Consequently, the wave 
function of a molecule is a product of the wave functions of the electron and nuclear 
subsystems. The price for such a simpliﬁcation is that when calculating the state of 
the electronic system, we do not account for the quantum nature of nuclei, ﬁxing 
their locations and ignoring the fact that the nuclei are in ﬁxed positions only with 
some probability. After such a simpliﬁcation, the Hamiltonian of the electronic 
subsystem looks as

ð10:1:3Þ 
Now, we can ﬁnd the eigenenergies of the electronic subsystem 
Ea R 
and 
corresponding wave functions φa re1, re2; R 
by assuming the distance between 
the nuclei R is ﬁxed R = R [1]. In this case, as long as we do not consider variations 
of R, we can disregard the direct Coulomb interaction between nuclei e2 /R. The 
approaches to solving this problem are well-developed [2]. For the ground state, the 
obtained dependence of eigenenergy Eg(R) is qualitatively shown in Fig. 9.2. Usu-
ally, it is approximated with the Morse curve [3].

Using the obtained wave function φa r1, r2; R 
as an electronic wave function, 
which is a part of the adiabatic wave function of the molecule, φa r1, r2; R χa R

turns the rest of the Schrödinger equation with Hamiltonian (10.1.1) into the 
Schrödinger equation for the wave function of nuclei:

ð10:1:4Þ 
We can see that not U but Ea(R) plays the role of the effective potential for nuclear 
motion. This is important because unlike the electrostatic potential U, which, 
according to Earnshaw’s theorem [4], cannot have a minimum, Ea(R) has a mini-
mum determined by the equation ∂Ea(R)/∂R = 0. We denote the position of the 
minimum by R0. The presence of such a minimum leads to the stability of the 
hydrogen molecule, which is a quantum mechanical effect. Comparing the values of 
the energy levels of the molecule obtained by the theory and experiment, we can see 
that those results are in good agreement [5]. 
Unfortunately, with this approach, the Hamiltonian of the interaction between 
electronic and nucleus subsystems disappears. 
If we want to take into account the inﬂuence of nucleus motion on the electronic 
subsystem, then we cannot split the Schrödinger equation for the molecular wave 
function into two independent equations. The operator of the nucleus kinetic energy

Þ affects the electronic wave functions φa(re1, re2; R)1 because R is no longer 
a constant. The eigenenergy Ea(R) and, consequently, the Morse potential become 
time-dependent.

In the general case, nuclear wave functions are coupled to each other, and each of 
them depends on all electronic conﬁgurations. The coupling operator h

is 
referred to as a non-adiabaticity operator. 
This means that one cannot describe the interaction between electron and nucleus 
subsystems in the adiabatic approximation. To ﬁnd the interaction operator, we 
should come back and analyze Hamiltonian (10.1.1). 
Below, we take into account that, ﬁrstly, the nuclei can move along only one 
direction; consequently, the coordinate and momentum of nuclei are scalar operators 
Rand P, and, secondly, that the nuclei still oscillate in the vicinity of the minimum of 
the Morse curve and we can expand the potential U in Taylor’s series in terms of 
δR0/R0:

where R0 is the position of the minimum of Ea(R). 
Below, we also assume that in all scattering processes, the only two lowest levels 
of the electronic subsystem play a signiﬁcant role, and the probabilities of excitations 
of higher electronic levels are so small that they can be neglected (i.e., the molecule 
is treated as a TLS). Thus, we restrict ourselves to considering only two electronic 
states φg(r; R0) = |gi(R0) and φe(r; R0) = |ei(R0). The energies of these states are 
separated by the energy ħωσ(R0). 
The next step is relating the parameters of the TLS to the ones of Hamiltonian 
(10.1.6). The wave functions φg(r; R0) = |gi(R0) and φe(r; R0) = |ei(R0) are deter-
mined by the ﬁrst three terms of Eq. (10.1.6). Assuming that the energy of the ground 
state of the electron subsystem equals zero, we can write these three terms in a simple 
form (see Sect. 2):

where d = deg σ{ þ σ

one can introduce the coupling constant (the Rabi frequency), 
Ωext = - Eext  deg =ħ, 
and using the rotating wave approximation (see Sect. 2.4), rewrite term (10.1.8) as

Also, under the inﬂuence of the monochromatic external ﬁeld, the operator σ

From Eq. (10.1.14), using U~ħωσ and that the characteristic distance between

where at the last step we exploit that for hydrogen-like molecules ωσ~me4 /ħ3 and 
a~ħ2 /me2 , m is an effective electron mass. 
Finally, we quantize the Hamiltonian Hnucl (Eq. (10.1.13)). To do this, we should 
consider the nuclear displacement as the operator δR (see Sect. 2.5.1). Then, Hnucl 
becomes the Hamiltonian of a quantum oscillator, and we can introduce operators b
þ 
and b for the creation and annihilation of the excitations of nuclear oscillations that 
satisfy the boson commutation relation b, b 
{ = 1. The operator δR and operators b

These terms are responsible for the interaction of electrons and vibrations of the 
molecule nuclei. 
It is worth emphasizing that in various electronic states, eigenenergy minima are 
achieved at different arrangements of the nuclei. Thus, a harmonic external ﬁeld, 
causing the Rabi oscillations of the electronic subsystem, should affect the nuclei 
system, causing the nuclear subsystem to move between positions having R0(|gi) and 
R0(|ei). This fact is reﬂected in Eq. (10.1.18), and vice versa, the nuclear vibration 
modulates the dipole moment of the electronic subsystem. 
Below, we denote the interaction constant between the TLS and nuclear vibra-
tions as

Fröhlich Hamiltonian that describes the electron-phonon interaction (see, e.g., Refs. 
[8–10]). This Hamiltonian is of the dephasing type (see Sect. 3.2.3). 
Finally, combining Eqs. (10.1.13)–(10.1.18), we obtain the complete quantized 
Hamiltonian of a molecule interacting with an EM ﬁeld:

of a nucleus from the equilibrium position results in a change in the transition 
frequency ωσ of the electronic subsystem of the molecule. That is, the movement 
of nuclei about their equilibrium positions leads to a modulation of the transition 
frequency of the effective TLS. For this reason, the considered interaction is often 
called parametric. As we see below, the described interaction mechanism leads to the 
Raman effect. Such a simple interpretation, of course, gives only qualitative results.

Spontaneous Raman Scattering 
As Hamiltonian (10.1.23) describing the electron-vibron interaction has been intro-
duced, we can consider Raman scattering of a monochromatic wave incident on a 
molecule. 
In addition to the external ﬁeld, the electronic subsystem may interact with 
reservoirs responsible for relaxation processes in the molecule. These are the reser-
voir of the free space modes (see Eq. (11.1.2) and, Sect. 3.1) and the dephasing 
reservoir arising due to the impact broadening of atoms’ spectral lines in gases or 
other elastic interactions with the surrounding medium [see Eqs. (3.2.51)–(3.2.52)]. 
The vibrational modes of the nuclear subsystem interact with the thermal reservoir of 
the environment [1]. The model Hamiltonian describing these reservoirs has 
the form:

In this Hamiltonian, the ﬁrst term describes the reservoir of free space EM modes. 
Operators a{ 
k,μ and ak,μ are creation and annihilation operators of the photon with the 
wave vector k and the polarization, μ. The second term corresponds to the dephasing 
reservoir of an elastic interaction with, say, atomic vibrations in the environment. 
The latter are quantized and described by the creation and annihilation operators cdp{ 
n 
and cdp 
n . The third term represents the reservoir responsible for the relaxation of the 
vibron modes of the molecule [2–5]. 
In the rotating wave approximation (see Eq. (2.4.6)), which is used throughout 
this part, the interaction of the system with the reservoirs is described by the 
Hamiltonian:

The ﬁrst term in interaction Hamiltonian (11.1.2) is similar to the one in Hamiltonian 
(10.1.9), in which the external ﬁeld is replaced by the quantized ﬁeld of the free 
space mode with the wave vector k and the polarization μ. In this term, Ek, μ is the 
electric ﬁeld per one photon. We assume that this Hamiltonian is of the Jaynes-
Cummings type. The quantity κdp 
n 
is the interaction constant of the electronic 
subsystem with the n-th mode of the dephasing reservoir, which is assumed to be 
of the Fröhlich type. The quantities κmol 
l 
are the interaction constants of the vibronic 
modes of the molecule with the thermal reservoir of the environment.

The next step is to derive the Heisenberg equations for all unknown operators. 
Comparing the Rabi Hamiltonian (Eq. (2.4.1)) to Hamiltonian (10.1.23), we can 
see that the former has two additional terms ħωvb
þ b þ ħg b
þ þ b σ{ σ connected 
with nuclear vibrations. Following Problem 1.2, one can see that due to this 
difference, the additional term - igσ b 
{ þ b 
in the equation for σ and the term
- igσ{ σ in the equation for b arise (see Eqs. (11.1.4) and (11.1.5)). 
Using the Born-Markov approximation (Remark 3.1), one can eliminate the 
operators corresponding to the reservoirs’ degrees of freedom. This can be done 
when the reservoirs are in thermal equilibrium at a ﬁxed temperature and the 
interaction of the system with the reservoir is weak. This procedure results in the 
emergence of dissipation and noise terms in the Heisenberg equations. In the rotating 
wave approximation, one can obtain the following Heisenberg-Langevin equations 
(see Problems 1.2 and 1.6, in Part I) for the TLS transition operator σ and the 
operator of the vibration amplitude of the molecule nuclear b:1
1 The operators σ{ and b 
{ are governed by corresponding complex conjugated equations.

molecule and the dipole moment of the electronic transition from the environment, 
respectively (for the deﬁnition of the noise terms, see Part I, Problem 1.6, and Eq. (4. 
1.7), and the comments following this equation). The dissipation constant γσ deter-
mines the total rate of the dipole moment relaxation, which consists of the rate of 
radiation losses and dephasing. Keep in mind that for many molecules, the dissipa-
tion rate of the dipole moment γσ is mainly determined by dephasing processes [6– 
11]. The noises Fσ tð Þ  and Fb tð Þ  are associated with system losses through the 
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. These noises have the following correlation prop-

The noise term Fσ tð  Þ  in Eq. (11.1.4) arises from the interaction of the electronic 
subsystem of a molecule with the dephasing reservoir of the surrounding medium 
(see Remark 3.3). This interaction results in the low-frequency wing of the Mollow 
triplet. In the Raman experiments, this part of the spectrum is considered as 
immaterial nonresonant background not related to Raman scattering (see Remark 
5.1). This background is usually subtracted from the spectrum to facilitate the 
processing of experimental data. In analytical description, such a procedure can be 
realized by neglecting the noise term Fσ tð  Þ. Thus, system of equations (11.1.4) and 
(11.1.5) is simpliﬁed:

The system of nonlinear operator equations (11.1.11) and (11.1.12) cannot be solved 
analytically. However, in many practical cases, one employs the off-resonant Raman 
scattering when a laser with a frequency largely detuned from the electronic transi-
tion frequency of the molecule. The orders of magnitude of typical values of the 
relevant parameters are γv~10-4 eV, nv~10-4 , ωσ, ωext, ωσ - ωext are optical 
frequencies ~1 eV (for deﬁniteness, we assume that ωσ > ωext), γσ~10-2 eV, 
ωv~g lie in the IR range ~10-3 eV, the Rabi frequency Ωext = - deg  Eext/ħ is 
less than 10-3 eV at moderate values of the electric ﬁeld |E(t)| < 106 V/m, and a 
typical value of the electronic transition dipole moment is |deg|~10 D. Therefore, 
below, we assume that for the Rabi frequency, the following inequality is fulﬁlled: 
Ωext=ωσ ≪1
ð11:1:13Þ 
Let us also note that since the electron-vibron interaction should not cause electronic 
transitions in a TLS, we expect that g < ωσ. In fact, for all realistic systems, the 
following inequality is satisﬁed: 
g=ωσ ≪1
ð11:1:14Þ 
Thus, our system has two small parameters: 
εΩext = Ωext=ωσ and εg = g=ωσ:
ð11:1:15Þ 
The nature and origin of these parameters differ, but they have the same orders of 
smallness. We, therefore, can introduce a parameter ε  εΩext  εg, keeping in mind 
that εn corresponds to any product εk 
Ωext εn - k 
g 
with n ≥ k ≥ 0. 
206

Developing a perturbation theory based on two small parameters can be tricky. To 
clarify the procedure, we introduce “dimensionless” times, tσ = ωσt and tv = ωvt. 
Using these times, we can rewrite system (11.1.11) – (11.1.12) in the form:

εΩ = Ωext/ωσ (see Eqs. (11.1.13) and  (11.1.14)), while Eq. (11.1.17) does not have 
small parameters explicitly.

ð11:1:19Þ 
After applying expansion (11.1.18) to original system (11.1.4)–(11.1.5), we obtain a 
system of perturbation equations in each order in the parameter ε. In our case, the 
equations of the perturbation theory are reduced to the nonhomogeneous linear 
differential equations of the ﬁrst order with respect to time. The general solution to 
such an equation is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation and 
any particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. 
In Raman scattering, we seek the molecule’s oscillation spectrum when the dipole 
moment oscillations reach a stationary state. Since Eqs. (11.1.11) –(11.1.12) are 
linear, their solution is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equations 
and a partial solution to inhomogeneous equations. The general solution to the 
homogeneous equation is independent of the CW external ﬁeld and vanishes with 
the rate of radiation dephasing. Further, we deal with large times, t ≫γ - 1 
v 
, γ - 1 
σ 
, 
when only driven oscillations caused by the external ﬁeld survive. Therefore, the 
steady-state (stationary) solution reduces to the particular solution of the inhomoge-
neous equation; this solution becomes proportional to the external ﬁeld and does not 
contain the information of the initial conditions. At large times, this solution is 
suitable for determining the spectrum. Note that vanishing in time solution generates 
corresponding terms in higher orders of the perturbation theory. These terms, 
however, also decay in time, and we neglect them in further discussion. 
Now, we return to system (11.1.11)–(11.1.12). In the general case, in the n-th 
order, the system of perturbation equations should look as

In the ﬁrst equation, f stands for g or Ωext. Sn - 1 and Bn - 1 are functions independent 
of small parameters that should be obtained while solving the equations of the 
(n - 1)-th order.2

ÞI: 
In the zeroth order of the perturbation theory, the terms proportional to Ωext and 
g should be omitted in Eq. (11.1.16) because they are of the ﬁrst order in ε. Thus, in 
the zero order, there is no action of the external ﬁeld, and no coupling between 
electronic and vibronic subsystems is taken into account, i.e., we are working with 
the “zeroth-order” Hamiltonian: 
H0 = ħω0σ{ σ þ ħωvb
þ b: 
Indeed, in the zeroth order on ε, Eq. (11.1.16) becomes the equation for free dipole 
(σ0) of the molecular electronic state:

Þσ0 = 0:

Eq. (11.1.21) reduces to the equation: 
db0

ð
Þb0 = Fb tð Þ,
ð11:1:24Þ 
The solution to Eq. (11.1.24) is (see Problem 2.1)
2 The unity operator in the right-hand side comes from the fact that the ﬁrst nonzero right-hand side 
in the perturbation equations is proportional to Ωext exp (-iωextt). The next orders can be obtained 
by using recursion.

Thus, Eqs. (11.1.22) and (11.1.24) describe the situations with an unexcited TLS and 
incoherent vibrons generated by noises (see Eq. (11.1.25)). 
Turning to the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory, in Eq. (11.1.11), we have to 
retain the ﬁrst-order terms in ε, i.e., we take into account the TLS interactions with 
both the external classical ﬁeld and vibrons. Since g~ε, the term having the g-
prefactor may only contain additional factors b0 and/or σ0. Keeping in mind that 
σ0 = 0, we obtain the following equations for the operators b1 and σ1:

number prefactor, which oscillates with the frequency of the external ﬁeld. In 
Chap. 4, we consider such terms to be coherent. The operator σ1 tð Þ  is responsible 
for Rayleigh scattering.

In the second order of the perturbation theory, we restrict ourselves to considering 
the equation for the electronic subsystem only (see Eq. (11.1.4)). Using

Note that the coherent contribution to the oscillation of the electronic subsystem 
appears in the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory (see Eqs. (11.1.31) and 
(11.1.34)). The incoherent term for the electronic subsystem appears in the second 
order. 
Let us ﬁnd the scattering spectrum. As we discussed in Sect. 3.4.1, to calculate the 
spectrum, we should calculate the correlator 
σ{ t þ τ
ð
Þσ tð Þ  .3 Since σ0 = 0, in the 
second order of the perturbation theory, up to the accuracy of ε2 , the approximate 
solution for the operator σ is equal to σ1 þ σ2. Therefore, we have: 
σ{ t þ τ
ð
Þσ tð Þ  = σ{ 
1 t þ τ
ð
Þσ1 tð Þ  þ 
σ{ 
2 t þ τ

Þσ2 tð Þ  þ

Þσ1 tð Þ  
ð11:1:35Þ 
From Eqs. (11.1.9), (11.1.33), and (11.1.34), we obtain: 
σ{

ð
Þσ1 tð Þ  /

ð11:1:36Þ 
Thus, the cross-terms in Eq. (11.1.35) are zero, so

ð
Þσ1 tð Þ  þ 
σ{

Þσ2 tð Þ
ð11:1:37Þ
3 To do this, we must perform two types of averaging. The ﬁrst one is the averaging of the quantum 
mechanical operator σ, which we considered in Chap. 9. The second type is the averaging of the 
noise terms. For this purpose, we use Eq. (11.1.9) for the noise correlator, which follows from the 
properties of the thermal reservoir (see Chap. 9 for details). To simplify the notations, we use hi for 
this double averaging (i.e., averaging over the reservoir and system degrees of freedom).

Thanks to Eq. (11.1.31), we can rewrite the ﬁrst term

in Eq. (11.1.35), according to Eqs. (11.1.33) and 
(11.1.34), contains noise correlators. Since the noises are assumed to be Markovian, 
i.e., the noise at time t does not depend on the noise at previous times, the correlators 
have a simple form

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (11.1.43) describes the Rayleigh scattering intensity, while the 
second and the third terms describe Stokes and anti-Stokes intensities, respectively. 
Unless we work in the weak coupling regime Ωext/γv < |ωext - ωσ|/g, we can neglect 
the Mollow triplet and obtain that the Rayleigh contribution to the spectrum has a 
δ-function shape. In practice, the Rayleigh contribution has a ﬁnite width determined 
by the linewidth of the source. The Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies are shifted by 
the nuclear oscillation frequency ωv to the low- and high-frequency regions, respec-
tively. The Stokes and anti-Stokes contributions to the spectrum have widths 
determined by the damping rate of the nuclear oscillations γv=2 and are, therefore, 
incoherent contributions to the spectrum.

In this chapter, we have extended the quantum theory of Rayleigh scattering 
developed in Sect. 6.1, to the case of Raman scattering. Within the framework of the 
Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, we could see an analogy with the 
behavior of the classical system and treat Raman scattering as a single process 
involving the forced oscillation of the molecular dipole moment by incident radia-
tion. The intramolecular interaction between electrons and nuclei’s vibrations mod-
ulates these forced oscillations, leading to Stokes and anti-Stokes lines in the 
emission spectrum. 
To describe spontaneous Raman scattering caused by monochromatic waves, we 
have developed a perturbation theory that allows one to ﬁnd solutions to the 
Heisenberg-Langevin equation. This theory uses the smallness of two coupling 
constants compared with the frequency ωσ of the electronic transition of the mole-
cule. The ﬁrst small parameter Ωext/ωσ is related to the coupling constant of the 
external electric ﬁeld with the molecular dipole moment. The second small param-
eter g/ωσ is determined by the Fröhlich electron-vibron interaction constant g. In  
practice, both these parameters are of the same order. 
The obtained operator equations of the perturbation theory are linear in each order 
of the small parameter, and after the transition to expectation values of operators, 
they can be solved analytically. Below, we use this perturbation theory to describe 
SERS, SRS, Raman lasing, and CARS.

Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering 
(SERS) 
Even though the Raman scattering cross section is extremely small [1], Raman 
spectroscopy has proven to be a valuable research tool. The widespread use of this 
method has stimulated the development of approaches to amplify the Raman signal. 
One of the most successful ampliﬁcation methods turned out to be SERS. The 
essence of the method is that the Raman effect may be signiﬁcantly enhanced if 
Raman-active molecules are adsorbed on rough metal surfaces or nanostructures. 
The ﬁrst experiment reported on this effect [2], published in 1974, showed that the 
Raman signal from pyridine molecules adsorbed onto the roughened silver electrode 
became enhanced. The authors attributed the observed enhancement to the increased 
electrode surface, on which more measured molecules (analyte) were adsorbed. This 
qualitative explanation turns out to be incorrect. The effect was later observed not 
only on corrugated surfaces but on individual metallic nanoparticles and dimers [3], 
the surface of which was not large enough to explain the effect by increasing the 
number of the analyte molecules. It was shown that the effect was connected with the 
local enhancement of the scattered ﬁeld due to the plasmonic resonance [4]. Individ-
ual metallic nanoparticles, dimers, and surface roughnesses act as local ﬁeld ampli-
ﬁers; in the literature, such structures are referred to as “hot points” or plasmonic 
nanoantennas (PNAs) (below, we use the latter term). However, the main conclusion 
of Ref. [2] that in order to study molecules absorbed on a metal surface by Raman 
spectroscopy, the surface should be rough has greatly impacted future studies. 
In this chapter, we show that the magnitude of the Raman effect enhancement of a 
molecule placed in the vicinity of a PNA is determined by the properties of the PNA. 
Eventually, SERS has been associated with plasmon resonance on the substrate 
structure [5–9]. Below, we show that the following two types of signal enhance-
ments turned out to be signiﬁcant for SERS—the enhancement of the intensity of the 
incident electric ﬁeld due to the plasmonic resonance and the enhancement of the 
radiated intensity due to the Purcell effect [10]. 
The Purcell effect is a change in the radiation rate of an atom placed in a resonator 
compared to the radiation rate of the atom in free space. This change is quantitatively

an atom placed in the resonator (γσ in res) and in vacuum (γσ):

Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
FP = γσ in res=γσ:
ð12:1:1Þ 
Let us recall that FP can be expressed as the ratio of local densities of states in the 
resonator and vacuum. In SERS FP = γσ in res/γσ > 1, this signiﬁes that PNA brings 
in additional states, and the molecule radiates manly into the PNA states but not into 
free space states. The molecule plays the role of feeder for the PNA. So, the PNA 
emits the energy accumulated in PNA states. Thus, in SERS, it is the intensity of the 
PNA radiation but not the radiation of atom that is measured in experiment. 
To evaluate the intensity radiated by the system consisting of the PNA and 
molecule, we should take into account that the radiation rate γS of any system is 
proportional to the dipole moment squared. 
The size of a PNA is much larger than the size of a molecule, and the dipole 
moment of the PNA dpl is much larger than the molecular dipole moment dσ. 
Consequently, the radiation rate γPNA ~ d2 
pl is much larger than that of the molecule 
γσ ~ d2 
σ, even if the molecule is placed near the PNA, γPNA ≫ γσ in res. Since the PNA 
is fed by the radiation of the molecule, the intensity of light radiated by the PNA may 
be at least equal to the intensity of the molecule placed near the PNA. Due to the 
Purcell effect, the radiation of the PNA is FP times larger than the intensity radiated 
by a single TLS [11]. This is one of the mechanisms of the SERS enhancement. 
12.1 
Quantum Nanoplasmonics 
The term “plasmon” has appeared in plasma physics to describe longitudinal col-
lective oscillations of electrons (Langmuir waves [12]). On average, plasma is 
quasineutral, i.e., the mean local charge is zero. In Ref. [12], Langmuir showed 
that local long-lived ﬂuctuations with a longitudinal electric ﬁeld could be excited in 
such a plasma. Later, such excitations came to be called “plasmons” [13]. Plasmons 
could arise in any medium if the value of the plasma permittivity is equal to zero. 
Below, to describe plasma, we employ the Drude formula for the values of plasma 
permittivity [14–16]. 
Since the electric ﬁeld of a plasmon is quasistatic, we cannot quantize it using the 
standard scheme outlined in Sect. 2.5. To quantize the plasmon resonance, we use 
the following scheme. Assume that, at a certain moment of time, a spherical 
ﬂuctuation in the charge distribution arises. Inside a small spherical volume, positive 
and negative charges move apart by a small distance dx. The new system is 
equivalent to two spheres of the same radius ﬁlled by positive and negative charges; 
the dipole moment of the system is d = e(ri + dx/2) - e(ri - dx/2) = edx. If the 
electron charge density is ne, then the mean polarization of the sphere is P = ned. The 
ﬁeld in such a sphere is equal to -4πP/3. Newton’s equation of motion of an electron

d2 x/dt2 = eE/me may be rewritten as ed2 x/dt2 = e2 (-4πP/3)/me. Then, the equation 
of motion for the dipole moment becomes:

the energy of the polarized sphere of volume V and dipole dpl and equate it to the 
energy of one quantum.

Thanks to Eq. (12.1.6), the latter deﬁnition of the quantum of the dipole moment

12.2 
Enhancement of the Radiated Field Intensity Due 
to the Purcell Effect 
At the end of the nineteenth century, Hertz experimentally discovered an increase in 
the intensity radiating by an emitter placed near a resonant antenna. The emitter 
plays the role of the feeder, while the antenna acts as a mediator that improves the 
impedance between the emitter and free space while the total energy is conserved. 
In a quantum system, thanks to the Purcell effect, the radiation rate of an atom 
placed in a resonator can be enhanced by the factor FP (see Eq. (12.1.1)). Thus, one 
can control the EM radiation rate of a molecule by changing the environment (see 
Fig. 12.1). In the simplest case of a system consisting of a quantum emitter and a 
plasmonic resonator, this effect is manifested as a change in the emission rate [18–23].

though, in the text, we model PNA by a sphere, in practice, more realistic shapes of PNAs are used

Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
Below, we are interested in the radiation of a molecule placed near a PNA. The 
molecule (quantum emitter) is modeled as an effective TLS, and the PNA is 
considered as a resonator, in which the EM ﬁeld is described as a harmonic 
oscillator. We assume that we deal with a resonant case in which the TLS transition 
frequency and the PNA eigenfrequency are the same, and the excitation of the TLS 
causes the excitation of a plasmon by the nonradiative Förster mechanism, which 
assumes that the TLS-PNA interaction is of the dipole-dipole nature [24, 25] and the 
electric ﬁeld of the TLS excites the plasmon. Consequently, the TLS excitation 
relaxes. The Hamiltonian that describes this process can be written analogously to 
that of the excitation of the EM mode in the Rabi oscillations: 
H = ħωσσ{ σ þ ħωpla{ 
plapl þ ħΩR pl  aplσ{ þ a{ 
plσ
ð12:1:13Þ 
Consequently, the coupling constant between the TLS and the PNA mode (the Rabi 
frequency) takes the form: 
ΩR pl ~ deg . dpl= ħa3 = 
4πωpl= 3ħVPNA
ð
Þ
 
deg = ħ3V4π
ð
Þ:
ð12:1:14Þ 
Below, we suppose that the size of the PNA is so large (≥50nm) that radiation losses 
are much larger than the ohmic losses. In such a case, the relaxation rate γσ of the 
dipole moment of the TLS placed in vacuum is proportional to d2 
eg (see Eq. (3.1.20)), 
while the relaxation rate of the plasmon γpl, responsible for radiation losses of the 
PNA, is proportional to the square of the dipole moment of the localized plasmon dpl. 
Since the size of the PNA is much larger than that of the TLS, it is assumed that dpl/ 
deg ≫ 1. Therefore, we can write the following inequality [26, 27]: 
γpl=γσ ≈ dpl=deg 
2 = α2 ≫1
ð12:1:15Þ 
Hamiltonian (12.1.13) allows us to write the Heisenberg-Langevin equations for the 
involved operators. For estimations, it is convenient to transition to observables of 
the operators apl = apl , σ = σ
h i, and D = 2σ{ σ - 1 
and make the commonly 
used approximation 
Dapl 
= D 
apl 
[24, 26]. As a result, we arrive at the 
Maxwell-Bloch equations for c-numbers: 
d

where γD is the relaxation rate of the inverse population of the TLS. Assuming that 
the effect is resonant, we put ωσ = ωpl. 
12.2
Enhancement of the Radiated Field Intensity Due to the Purcell Effect
223
In the strong coupling regime, Ω2 
R pl ≫ γσ - γpl 
2 =4, the power transferred from 
the TLS to the PNA is so large that the energy is transferred from the quantum 
emitter to the PNA and back with the Rabi frequency. Thus, the effect of the Rabi 
oscillations (the Raby splitting) prevails over the process of radiation (see Sects. 2.1 
and 2.2 and Refs. [28, 29]). 
The physics of the weak coupling regime, in which 
Ω2 
R pl ≪ γpl - γσ 
2 =4,
ð12:1:19Þ 
is more interesting. Since γσ ≪ γpl, the inequality (12.1.19) reduces to Ω2 
R pl ≪γ2 
pl=4. 
We are interested in the process of relaxation of the excited atom into PNA during 
the time t~1/γpl. Consequently, the inverse population D changes insigniﬁcantly; 
therefore, we can put D = D0 = - 1. Then, from Eqs. (12.1.16) and (12.1.17), we 
obtain: 
d 
dt apl = - iωσapl - γplapl - iΩR plσ
ð12:1:20Þ 
d 
dt σ = - iωσσ - γσσ - iΩR plapl
ð12:1:21Þ 
The eigenfrequencies ω of system (12.1.20) and (12.1.21) are determined by the 
equation: 
iω - iωpl - γpl 
iω - iωσ - γσ
ð
Þ þ Ω2 
R pl  = 0:
ð12:1:22Þ 
In what follows, we focus on the imaginary parts γσ± of ω±. The expression for 
eigenfrequencies (12.1.24) deﬁnes several regimes of system operations depending 
on the relationship between the Rabi frequency ΩR pl  and the loss rates γσ and γpl. 
Since the size and the dipole moment of the PNA are much greater than those of the 
TLS, the PNA should radiate better than the TLS. Consequently, we assume that 
γpl ≫ γσ. Thus, we may neglect small terms proportional to (ΩR pl/γpl)2 in 
Eq. (12.1.24). However, since we expect the PNA to radiate better than the TLS, 
we assume that γpl ≫ γσ and that Ω2 /γplγσ ≫ 1 even though (ΩR pl/γpl)2 ≪ 1. 
Therefore, we retain the terms containing the product (γpl/γσ)(ΩR pl/γpl)2 = (ΩR pl/ 
γσ)(ΩR pl/γpl). 
There are two solutions to Eq. (12.1.22):

Since we consider the weak coupling limit, Ω2 ≪ (γpl - γσ)2 /4, we can expand the 
square root in Eq. (12.1.23). The root with the “plus” sign has the form: 
ωþ = ωσ - iγσ 1 þ γpl=γσ Ω2

The corresponding eigenvector is

ð12:1:25Þ 
The “minus” root has the form: 
ω - = ωσ - iγpl,
ð12:1:26Þ 
while the corresponding eigenvector is 
a - ≈1, σ - ≈i ΩR pl  
γpl 
≪1
ð12:1:27Þ 
When initially the TLS is not excited, but the PNA is excited (a(0) ≈ 1, σ(0) ≈ 0), in 
the expansion of the initial conditions into eigenstates of Eqs. (12.1.20) and 
(12.1.21), the main contribution is produced by eigenvector (12.1.27) with the 
eigenfrequency ω-. Unsurprisingly, the system relaxed with the rate Imω- = γpl 
radiating into free space. 
If, initially, the TLS is excited (σ(0) = σ0 ≠ 0) and the PNA is not (a(0) = 0), the 
solution to Eqs. (12.1.20) and (12.1.21) is a linear combination of eigenvectors 
(12.1.25), and the main contribution is produced by eigenvector (12.1.27) with the 
eigenfrequency ω-. Thus, the solutions for the PNA interacting with the TLS are

use the density of states of the PNA modes instead of Π0. This density of states can 
be found if we consider the PNA as a resonator into which the TLS relaxes. This is a 
separate problem that is outside the scope of this book. Here, we only give an 
estimate for the PNA density of states ΠPNA(ω). Considering the PNA as a resonant 
dipole antenna, we approximate the density of states with the Lorentz formula [31]:

As was shown above, the essence of the Purcell effect is that the energy from a TLS 
is not emitted into free space but is transferred to plasmon oscillations. It is the 
radiation emitted by these plasmons that is observed in the experiment. 
Note that increasing the Purcell factor does not enhance the Raman signals. It 
only causes an increase in the energy reserve in the plasmonic resonator. To achieve 
signal enhancement, it is necessary to increase the radiation intensity of the resonator 
(in our case, the PNA). We also need to use an optimal value of the quality factor 
[34]. The existence of such a value follows from the following arguments. On the 
one hand, an increase in the Purcell factor indicates an increase in the power feeding 
the PNA. This increase is proportional to the quality factor of the PNA 
(Eq. (12.1.37)). On the other hand, the radiation rate of the PNA is inversely 
proportional to its quality factor (see Eq. (12.1.33)). This optimum value is achieved 
when γFp = Fpγσ and γ rad
ð
 Þ
 
cav = ωpl=Qcav. When this condition is met, each photon 
transmitted to the PNA is emitted. There is no useless accumulation of energy in 
plasma oscillations. Thus, the optimal value of the quality factor is determined by the 
equality λ3 =4π2 
Qopt

ð12:1:38Þ 
The smaller the volume of the PNA mode, the smaller is the required optimal quality 
factor. This explains why using low-Q subwavelength plasmonic resonators is more 
efﬁcient than high-Q dielectric resonators with a size larger than the wavelength. 
Indeed, we can achieve high Q for the dielectric resonator, but to achieve at optimal 
regime, a large volume is needed γFp = Fpγσ ~ Qopt 
cav=V . Thus, using the dielectric 
resonator does not lead to an increase in the radiation intensity.

Let us give estimates for the Purcell factor in some cases. In the microwave range, 
in which the resonator size may be as large as V ~ (100λ)3 and Q ≈ 104 , the optimal 
Purcell factor is small enough, FP ≈ 4 × 10-3 . In optics, high-Q resonators are 
fabricated using the whispering gallery modes. Unfortunately, decreasing the size of 
the resonator leads to a sharp decrease in the quality factor [35]. Hence, in optics, the 
resonators made of dielectrics cannot provide large Purcell factors. In plasmonics, 
despite the low Q-factor (Q ~ 10), the Purcell factor can have high values FP ≈4 × 102 
due to the small plasmonic mode volume, V 
(λ/10)3 . 
If the dipole moment of a localized plasmon dp is much larger than the molecular 
dipole moment deg, then the radiation intensity of the PNA exceeds the radiation 
losses of the molecule by FP and prevails in radiation of the elementary SERS 
system—plasmon-molecule. 
In the next section, we show that the Purcell effect can signiﬁcantly increase the 
intensity of spontaneous Raman scattering for a molecule placed near a PNA.

Description of SERS by Heisenberg-Langevin 
Equations 
To describe the SERS effect, we have to take into account both the excitation of 
plasmons and their interaction with the molecule. For this, we have to modify 
Hamiltonian (10.1.23) by adding plasmon-related terms: 
HS = ħωσσ{ σ þ ħωvb

The last two terms in this Hamiltonian describe the plasmon interaction with the 
external ﬁeld and the TLS-plasmon coupling, respectively. The relationship between 
corresponding coupling constants is [36]

To see the relationship between nanoparticle parameters, let us consider a silver 
nanoparticle where the Joule losses are minimal in the visible frequency range. There 
is the hope of ﬁnding more suitable materials [33]. 
If the size of a silver nanoparticle is greater than 50 nm, then the radiation losses 
are greater than the Joule losses, and radiative damping is the main channel for the 
relaxation of plasmons in the metal nanoparticles [37]. Consequently, γσ ≃γfree 
D =2 
(where γfree 
D = 4ω3 
σ deg 
2 =3ħc3) and γpl = γfree 
D pl=2 (where γfree 
D pl  = 4γω3

the rates of radiation losses in the free molecule and the plasmonic nanoparticle, 
respectively. 
Further, we assume that the transition energy of a TLS and the plasmon 
excitation energy are much greater than the system temperature, ħωσ, ħωpl ≫ kT, 
as is usually the case in quantum optics. We have seen in Chap. 11 that the strength 
of the noise is proportional to the mean value of the number of quanta

the following inequalities are satisﬁed:

Following the procedure developed in Chap. 3, we use a small parameter ε~Ω/ωσ~g/

perturbation theory:

The stationary solution to Eq. (12.2.16) is

ð12:2:21Þ 
Below, we express the enhanced amplitudes of σ1 and apl1 through the Purcell factor. 
For this purpose, we have to take into account that usually, in SERS experiments, the 
frequency of the external ﬁeld is inside the plasmonic resonance line, |ωext - ωpl| ≤γpl, 
and in the case of off-resonant scattering |ωext - ωσ| ≫ γσ. As a result, in the 
denominators of Eqs. (12.2.19) and (12.2.20), we can neglect Ω2 
R pl  compared to | 
(-i(ωext - ωσ) +  γσ)(-i(ωext - ωpl) +  γpl)|~(ωext - ωσ)γpl (see Eq. (12.2.8)). Thanks 
to inequalities (12.2.8), in the numerator of Eq. (12.2.20), we can also neglect ΩR pl  
in comparison with α(i(ωext - ωσ) +  γσ). 
The strong coupling regime implies that the Rabi constant of the interaction 
between the PNA and the TLS is large, αΩR pl  ≫ |ωext - ωpl|, γpl. Therefore, in 
the numerator of Eq. (12.2.19), we neglect (-i(ωext - ωpl) +  γpl) compared with αΩR. 
After these simpliﬁcations, we obtain the following expression for the Rayleigh 
amplitudes: 
σ1 = SSERSe - iωextt I,

According to Eq. (11.1.31) for spontaneous Raman scattering, the factor

the PNA; therefore, SSERS is the factor responsible for the ﬁeld enhancement due to 
the plasmonic resonance. According to Eq. (12.1.15), α ≈(dpl/deg), then SSERS/S may 
be rewritten as

The ﬁrst factor on the right-hand side of this equation is the ampliﬁcation of the local 
electric ﬁeld exerted on the molecule. The second factor appears due to the Purcell 
effect and is responsible for the faster emission of the spontaneous Raman signal 
from the molecule. 
Thus, the enhancement of the light scattered by a molecule includes contributions 
from two physical processes. 
First, at the plasmonic resonance ωext ≈ ωpl, the near-ﬁeld of the nanoparticle is 
enhanced. The amplitude of the molecular dipole moment oscillation is increased 
proportionally to the enhancement of the local ﬁeld. As was shown, the effect results 
in the ﬁrst Purcell factor in Eq. (12.2.38). 
Second, in typical SERS experiments, the dipole moment of a plasmon nanopar-
ticle exceeds the dipole moment of the electron transition in a molecule by several 
orders of magnitude; consequently, the contribution of the nanoparticle into the 
scattered light signiﬁcantly exceeds the contribution of the molecule α = dpl/deg ≫ 1. 
Due to the Purcell effect, the near-ﬁeld energy transfer to the plasmon nanopar-
ticle is faster than the energy emission of the molecule into empty space. At the 
Stokes frequency, the plasmon is fed by the excited molecule. This process is 
responsible for the second Purcell factor in Eq. (12.2.38).

Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
Thus, the light scattering on the molecule also effectively increases in the 
presence of the plasmon nanoparticle. 
Taking into account that the ratio α = dpl/deg is much greater than unity, we obtain 
the following estimate for the case of a high Purcell factor: FP ≃Ω2 
R plα2=γ2

Eq. (12.2.37) we obtain that the maximum ampliﬁcation of the Stokes signal in the

To conclude, if a molecule is placed near a plasmonic nanoantenna, the enhancement 
of spontaneous Raman scattering turns out to be linear in the incident intensity and is 
proportional to the fourth power in the coupling constant of the plasmon with the 
molecule. Numerically, the coefﬁcient of the enhancement is equal to the Purcell 
factor squared. In terms of antenna theory, the PNA acts as a mediator that improves 
the connection (impedance) between the TLS and EM modes of free surrounding 
space.

The Progress in Study of the Raman Effect 
After the Laser Invention 
The invention of lasers provided a new tool for studying the optical properties of 
materials. In particular, it becomes possible to observe many new nonlinear effects, 
for example, wave mixing and generation of the higher harmonics [1, 2]. That led to 
the development of a new branch of optics—nonlinear optics [3], which successfully 
describes coherent and high-intensity laser radiation. In Raman spectroscopy, the 
employment of nonlinear optics simpliﬁes the consideration of coherent phenomena. 
Before the invention of lasers, spectroscopists had little interest in the degree of 
coherence of the spectra under study, which was justiﬁed by the fact that they were 
dealing with incoherent light sources. Moreover, spontaneous Raman scattering 
remains incoherent regardless of the power or coherence of the incident wave. 
The advent of lasers has revolutionized Raman spectroscopy essentially by 
making the Raman scattering coherent. Indeed, new phenomena observed in the 
Raman scattering of laser radiation, such as SRS, Raman ampliﬁcation, and CARS, 
arise due to the coherence of light. 
To observe the coherent Raman scattering, one needs two coherent incident 
waves with slightly different frequencies. In this case, the total EM ﬁeld exhibits 
beats. The total ﬁeld can be presented as a carrying wave with the mean frequency. 
The amplitude of the carrying wave is modulated by the beat frequency, which is 
equal to the difference between frequencies of the incident waves. However, in the 
description of linear oscillations, the beat frequency does not manifest itself in the 
spectrum of the ﬁeld oscillations. The spectrum consists of only two frequencies of 
the incident waves. We, therefore, cannot excite a resonator whose eigenfrequency is 
equal to the beat frequency. The situation changes dramatically if we consider the 
nonlinear oscillations. 
It is the nonlinearity of the interaction between the electronic and vibronic sub-
systems of the molecule that results in the appearance of the beat frequency in the 
spectrum of the Fröhlich force. If the beat frequency coincides with the 
eigenfrequency of nuclei oscillations, the resonant excitation of coherent vibrons 
occurs, making it possible to obtain a coherent Raman response. To observe a 
markedly coherent Raman response, the vibration of nuclei should exhibit a high

Q-factor. Thus, the high-Q resonant excitation of vibrons brings a new parameter 
γv ≪ ωv into the problem. Thus, since g~ωv ≫ γv, we cannot consider the Fröhlich 
coupling constant to be a small parameter.

The Progress in Study of the Raman Effect After the Laser Invention
In this chapter, we consider both Raman ampliﬁcation, including Raman lasing, 
and collective phenomena like CARS. 
13.1 
The Spectrum of Nonlinear Coherent Response of a 
Raman-Active Molecule on Two Monochromatic 
Electromagnetic Waves 
In this section, the object of the study is a molecule illuminated by two coherent 
signals having frequencies ωS (the signal beam) and ωP (the pumping beam) with ωS, 
ωP < ωσ. We base our consideration on Hamiltonian (10.1.23), to which we add the 
second external monochromatic ﬁeld. 
As before, we model the electronic part of the molecule by a TLS and use the 
rotating wave approximation. The system Hamiltonian has the following form: 
HS = ħωσσ{ σ þ ħωvb 
{ b þ ħgσ{ σ b 
{ þ b 
þ ħΩP 
2 
σ{ e - iωPt þ σeiωPt 
þ ħΩS 
2 
σ{ e - iωSt þ σeiωSt : 
ð13:1:1Þ 
The last two terms of Eq. (13.1.1) are responsible for the interactions of the TLS and 
two external harmonic ﬁelds with the frequencies ωP and ωS. The corresponding 
Rabi constants are ΩP = - deg . EP/ħ and ΩS = - deg . ES/ħ, where EP~ES are the 
amplitudes of the electric ﬁelds of the respective incident signals, and, as before, deg 
is the dipole moment of the TLS transition. Hereinafter, for certainty, we assume that 
ωS < ωP. We conﬁne ourselves to considering Raman-active molecules, assuming 
that the dipole moment of the transition between the vibrational levels is zero, so the 
external electric ﬁeld directly affects only the electronic subsystem of the molecule. 
From Hamiltonian (13.1.1), one can obtain the system of the Heisenberg-
Langevin equations for the operator of the nuclear vibrations b and the TLS operator 
σ:

where γv and γσ are the relaxation rates of the nuclear vibrations and TLS excitations, 
respectively. Note that Eq. (13.1.2) is identical to Eq. (11.1.5), while Eq. (13.1.3) 
differs from Eq. (11.1.4) because it has an additional term due to the second external 
ﬁeld. This term causes a qualitative change in the behavior of the system.

Note that in the absence of the interaction between the electronic and vibronic 
subsystems, the response of a small dipole moment σ is close to the sum of the 
responses on each wave. Since ωσ > ωS, ωP, the dipole moments are small. It may 
seem that accounting for a small interaction is unlikely to lead to a strong change in 
these responses. 
Nevertheless, the Fröhlich Hamiltonian gives a harmonic time dependence with 
the beat frequency ωB = ωP - ωS. Thus, the second incident wave introduces a new 
characteristic frequency into the problem—the beat frequency ωB. If  ωB = ωv, there 
appears a resonant enhancement of nuclei vibration that dramatically increases the 
Raman response. 
We do not know the exact solution to Eqs. (13.1.2) and (13.1.3); therefore, we use 
the perturbation theory to conﬁrm the above-suggested hypothesis that the excitation 
of a coherent response is connected with the appearance of the beat frequency in the 
spectrum of effective force driving the vibrons. To construct such a theory, we take 
advantage of the smallness of ΩP and ΩS compared to characteristic frequencies of 
the system. Thus, small dimensionless parameters can be introduced: 
ΩP=ωσ ≪1, 
ΩS=ωσ ≪1, 
g=ωσ ≪1
ð13:1:4Þ 
while g~ωv. Since we are looking for a pronounced effect, we assume that the quality 
factor of vibrons is high, i.e., Qv = ωv/γv~g/γv is large. This means that the mean 
number of excited vibrons may be greater than unity. Below, we assume that 
Qv > ωσ/ωv or 
g=γv

ð13:1:5Þ 
Based on inequalities (13.1.4) and that ΩP~ΩS, we can introduce a small perturba-
tion parameter:

ð13:1:6Þ 
We seek a solution to the set of Eqs. (13.1.2) and  (13.1.3) in the form of expansions 
(12.2.9). Note that to neglect the noises in the electronic subsystem, we need to 
maintain inequality (13.1.4) for both external waves. 
In the zeroth order of the perturbation theory, the results are the same as given by 
Eqs. (11.1.26) and (11.1.23):

where b0 tð Þ is determined by incoherent thermal nuclear vibrations arising due to the 
molecule interaction with the environment. The average number of nuclear vibra-
tions is determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution Eq. (11.1.27). 
When using Eq. (11.1.27), we assume that time t ≫γ - 1 
v 
so that the nuclear 
system is in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, in the zeroth order, we have an 
incoherent response of the vibrating nuclear subsystem and a zero response of the 
electronic subsystem. 
In the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory, Eqs. (13.1.2) and (13.1.3) are 
modiﬁed:

Thus, in the ﬁrst order, there is still no correction to the response of the nuclear 
subsystem. It is still unaffected by the EM ﬁeld, while the electronic subsystem 
exhibits the linear coherent response on the external ﬁeld. This conﬁrms our earlier 
assumption that σ is close to the sum of the responses on each wave. Consequently, 
in the second order, on the right-hand side of equations, a source oscillating at the 
beat frequency should appear. Indeed, 
db2=dt þ iωv þ γv

ð13:1:14Þ 
Substituting Eq. (13.1.12) into Eq. (13.1.13), we can see that due to the nonlinearity 
of the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.13), the beat frequency ωB = ωS - ωP appears as a 
new characteristic frequency for vibrons. This leads to the resonance response of b2. 
One can obtain the solutions to Eqs. (13.1.13) and  (13.1.14) by substituting the 
expressions for σ1 (Eq. (13.1.12)) and b0 (Eq. (13.1.7)) into these equations1 (see 
Problem 2.4): 
1 To obtain Eqs. (13.1.15) and (13.1.16), we substitute the expressions for σ1 (see Eq. (13.1.12)) and 
b0 into Eq. (1.4) of Problem 2.1.

We can see that when a harmonic source is added to the right-hand side of the vibron 
dynamics equation, the Fröhlich Hamiltonian causes the resonance excitation of 
vibrons if ωB = ωv. 
In this order of the perturbation theory, we can see that the incidence of two 
coherent waves causes an excitation of coherent oscillation of the nuclear subsystem 
and an incoherent oscillation of the electronic subsystem. The coherent oscillation of 
the nuclear subsystem is generated on the beat frequency ωB = ωP - ωS, while the 
incoherent response of the electronic subsystem contains terms on the six carrier 
frequencies, namely, on the Rayleigh frequencies ωP and ωS and on the Raman 
frequencies ωS ± ωB and ωP ± ωB. 
The coherent Raman scattering is exhibited in the third order of the perturbation 
theory for σ:

comes from the saturation of the TLS population

inversion under the action of the external ﬁelds (recall that population inversion is 
D1 = 2σ{ 
1σ1 - 1). Both nonlinearities contain terms oscillating on four frequencies 
ωP, ωS, 2ωP - ωS = ωP + ωB, and 2ωS - ωP = ωS - ωB. The latter two frequencies 
correspond to CARS and coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS).

are the nonlinear responses independent of the Fröhlich interaction; they oscillate 
with the frequencies ωP, ωS, 2ωS - ωP, and 2ωP - ωS. These responses arise due to 
the TLS saturation. The subscripts at the nonlinear responses S indicate the frequen-
cies with which the respective terms oscillate. The factors in the denominators, like 
(ωσ - ωS) and (ωσ - ωP), indicate the connection of the nonlinear response with the 
saturation of the excited electronic state. The resonances appear if ωS = ωσ or 
ωP = ωσ. The saturation is observed if we take into account the radiation rate γσ, 
which is omitted because γσ ≪ |ωσ - ωS|. Note that the beat frequency does not 
appear in any expression (13.1.19). 
The terms S(g) in Eq. (13.1.18) arise due to the nonlinearity caused by the Fröhlich 
interaction between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom:

The resonance appears if ωB = ωv and is connected with resonant excitation of the 
vibrons (see Eq. (13.1.15)). 
Let us discuss the smallness of the contributions to σ3 due to various terms on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.18). The contributions of the terms that do not depend on 
g (Eq. (13.1.19)) are of the order σ3 ~ ε3 ~ Ω3 
S,P=ω3 
σ. In experiment, one should use 
ωB ~ ωv; consequently, we obtain that contributions of the terms that depend on

that g2 /ωσγv~(g/γv)(g/ωσ)~1 (see Eq. (13.1.5)). 
Thus, the steady-state solution of Eq. (13.1.18) consists of terms oscillating with 
the frequencies ωS, 
ωP,
2ωS - ωp, and 2ωP - ωS. Due to the linearity of 
Eq. (13.1.18), the stationary solution to Eq. (13.1.18) may be sought as the sum of 
terms oscillating with the same frequencies:

For convenience, in Eq. (13.1.21), we separate the terms dependent and independent 
of the Fröhlich constant g. 
The g-independent terms are signiﬁcant if jωP - ωσj, jωS - ωσj ≪γσ. This means 
that although ωP, ωS ~ ωσ, the Lorentzian lines corresponding to these frequencies 
can be resolved. The other terms exhibit resonance at

this resonance arises due to the Fröhlich interaction (10.1.20) between electronic and 
nuclear degrees of freedom. In terms of nonlinear optics, this interaction mixes four 
waves [4] with frequencies ωP, ωS, 2ωS - ωP, and 2ωP - ωS. The terms depending 
on g can be considered as an implicit interaction of the pump and signal waves, 
resulting in the generation of these waves. Below, we show that each of these terms 
is responsible for its own speciﬁc phenomenon, such as Raman ampliﬁcation, SRS, 
or CARS. 
When relationship (13.1.22) is satisﬁed, the frequency 2ωS - ωP becomes the 
Stokes frequency for Raman scattering of the signal wave: 
2ωS - ωP = ωS - ωv,
ð13:1:23Þ 
while the frequency 2ωP - ωS corresponds to the anti-Stokes frequency for Raman 
scattering of the pumping wave: 
2ωP - ωS = ωP þ ωv
ð13:1:24Þ 
13.2 
The Raman Ampliﬁcation (Semiclassical Approach) 
The Raman ampliﬁcation is observed when two classical (coherent) waves propagate 
through a medium of the Raman-active molecules. This ampliﬁcation occurs due to 
the nonlinear interaction of two coherent light waves traveling in the same direction. 
The waves interact via Raman-active molecules. One of the waves is referred to as a 
signal wave with the frequency ωS, and it is assumed that this wave is weak and 
requires ampliﬁcation. The second is the high-power pump wave with the frequency 
ωP [5]. The maximum ampliﬁcation of the signal wave is observed at vibron 
resonance when the wave frequencies satisfy Eq. (13.1.22). In this case, the signal 
wave is ampliﬁed by receiving the energy from the pump wave. Thanks to relation-
ship (13.1.22), the signal wave is often called the Stokes wave. 
13.2.1 
Mechanism of Energy Transfer from One Wave 
to the Other 
In this section, we consider the energy exchange between two waves traveling in a 
Raman-active medium. We show that the pump wave transfers energy to a molecule 
while the signal wave receives the energy from the molecule. We treat these 
processes as an indirect energy transfer from the pumping to the signal.

We imply that all involved systems perform coherent oscillations. To determine 
the direction of the energy transfer between the electric dipole moment of a molecule 
and the incident wave, we study the phase difference between the driven oscillation 
of the dipole moment and the wave (see Remark 13.1). 
In the stationary regime, the total energy of oscillations of the dipole moment of 
the molecule should not change, but there is an exchange of energies between the 
responses of the dipole moment at different wavelengths. On each frequency, the 
molecule may absorb or radiate energy. Since the interaction between electronic and 
vibronic subsystems of the molecule is weak, we consider the absorption-radiation 
process on each frequency separately. 
Since, in this section, we are interested in the energy exchange between the 
responses

nism of this exchange, we assume, for a moment, that the intensity of the pumping 
and signal waves are constant and consider the interaction of the waves with the 
molecule separately. 
We begin with considering the wave-molecule interaction on the frequency ωS.

Remark 13.1 The Work Done by the External Field on the Dipole 
Consider a linear dipole that performs forced oscillations:

Þ = αE0 cos ωt þ φ

Þ
 
under the action of an external ﬁeld E(t) = E0 cos ωt. Here φ is the phase 
difference, and α is the absolute value of the dipole polarizability. The work 
done by the external ﬁeld on the dipole averaged over the period T = 2π/ω 
is [6]

When the phase belongs to the interval (-π, 0), the ﬁeld does a positive work 
on the oscillator. This means that energy is transferred from the external ﬁeld 
to the oscillator. If 0 < φ < π, then the work of the external ﬁeld over the 
dipole is negative, which can be interpreted as the energy transfer from the 
dipole to the external ﬁeld. 
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.29) is related to the nonlinearity 
of the electronic subsystem modeled by a TLS. This term does not take into account 
oscillations of the nuclear subsystem. The phase of this term coincides with the 
phase of the external ﬁeld with the frequency ωS. Therefore, the nonlinearity of the 
electronic subsystem does not lead to the ampliﬁcation of the signal beam. It is the 
second term that results in the phase shift between σ3 and the external ﬁeld ΩS(ωS), 
which equals π/2. 
Indeed, from the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.29), we obtain 
the third-order correction to the dipole moment induced by the signal wave:

is the nonlinear polarizability at the frequency ωS. The phase difference between 
oscillations of the dipole and the ﬁeld at the frequency ωS is π/2 2 (0, π). Conse-
quently, the work done by the ﬁeld is negative, indicating that the energy ﬂows from 
the dipole moment to the ﬁeld. Below, we show that this results in the ampliﬁcation 
of the ﬁeld at the frequency ωS while the wave propagates in the medium. 
The energy transferred to the wave with the frequency ωS is supplied by the wave 
with the frequency ωP. To see this, let us consider the response of the molecule 
polarization at the frequency ωP in the third order of the perturbation theory. For this 
purpose, on the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.25), we leave only the terms that are 
proportional to e - iωPt. Also, since we consider the resonant case, ωP - ωS = ωv, we

Comparing Eqs. (13.1.30) and (13.1.34), one can see that the phase shift between the 
pump and signal responses equals π. Thus, the pump wave performs a positive work 
on a Raman-active molecule, while the Stokes wave performs a negative work (see 
Remark 13.1). Hence, the pump wave through the molecule transfers energy to the 
Stokes wave. 
As one can see from Eq. (13.1.29), the resonant responses of the molecular dipole 
moment σωP 
3 
t 
on the frequencies ωP and ωS have the opposite signs. Thus, the

external ﬁeld EP drives the motion of the electronic subsystem at the frequency ωP, 
performing positive work on the subsystem, while the ﬁeld ES performes negative 
work on the subsystem.

13.2.2 
Raman Ampliﬁcation in Terms of Nonlinear Optics 
In the previous subsection, we have considered the ampliﬁcation of the signal wave 
due to the energy transfer from the pump wave. The key moment in the energy 
transfer process is the phase shift. Thus, it is the coherent parts of the waves that take 
part in this process. The coherent parts of the ﬁelds are well-described by the 
classical Maxwell equations. Since the molecule is considered a quantum system, 
such a description is semiclassical. This approach is adequate for experiment 
conditions when incident ﬁelds are powerful coherent light beams (the number of 
photons is large). That is why the Raman ampliﬁcation can also be described in 
terms of nonlinear optics. Indeed, if we consider the coherent component of the 
scattered light, we can see that the obtained expressions are similar to the description 
of the nonlinear mixing of two incident waves given by the third-order nonlinear 
susceptibility, which relates the third-order polarization to the electric ﬁeld [3, 7]:

ð13:1:35Þ 
where E is the Fourier transform of the electric ﬁeld. 
The consistent derivation of the expression for χ(3) (ωs, ωp, ωs, -ωp) requires the 
quantum mechanical approach, while the scattering of waves on a molecule may be 
considered as a classical nonlinear process of mixing four plane waves. The expres-
sion for χ(3) (ωS, ωP, ωS, -ωP) may also be obtained in a classical consideration of the 
nuclear motion by introducing a phenomenological Hamiltonian and applying a 
strong assumption that the system of nuclei can radiate at optical frequency 
[1]. Below, we obtain the expression for χ(3) (ωS, ωP, ωS, -ωP) in the quantum 
mechanical approach. 
The third-order polarization is related to σ3

This equation shows that the maximum nonlinear response occurs when the 
difference in the frequencies ωS and ωP is equal to the frequency of the nuclear 
vibrations ωv.

13.2
The Raman Ampliﬁcation (Semiclassical Approach)
249
Generally, χ(3) (ωout; ωin1, ωin2, ωin3) characterizes a process in which three inci-
dent waves with different frequencies ωin1, ωin2, and ωin3 are mixed, resulting in one 
output wave with the frequency ωout. In the case of the Raman ampliﬁcation, we 
have ωin1 = ωP, ωin2 = ωS, ωin3 = - ωP, and ωout = ωS. Thanks to energy 
conservation, there are four possible processes with output frequencies 2ωS - ωP, 
ωS, ωP, and 2ωP - ωS (see Eqs. (13.1.22) and (13.1.23)) [8]. 
Now, as we have the nonlinear susceptibility, we can determine the change in the 
signal amplitude due to the scattering. For this, we need to ﬁnd the electric ﬁelds EP 
and ES. 
The dynamics of the electric ﬁeld E in a homogeneous medium is described by 
the wave equation, which can be obtained from Maxwell’s equations:

∂2 E 
∂t2 = - 1 
c2 
∂2 P 
∂t2
ð13:1:37Þ 
where P is the speciﬁc polarization of the medium and E = EP + ES is the total ﬁeld. 
We represent the speciﬁc polarization as a sum P = PL + P(3) of the linear part PL, 
which is proportional to the amplitude of the incident ﬁeld, and the nonlinear part 
P(3) associated with both the saturation of the electronic levels of the molecule and 
the Raman processes, such as the parametric modulation of the oscillations of the 
electronic subsystem of molecules. 
The linear part of the speciﬁc polarization of the medium PL is connected with the 
ﬁeld E by the usual relation [6]: 
PL = εd - 1
ð
ÞE:
ð13:1:38Þ 
Here εd is a value of the linear permittivity. (Equation (13.1.38) is written in the time 
domain representation; therefore, generally, the permittivity εd is an operator.) 
Substituting Eq. (13.1.38) into Eq. (13.1.37), we obtain:

(ωS < ωP) and the same polarizations ex. Practically, we disregard the frequency 
dispersion of the linear permittivity and consider it as a c-constant. This allows us to 
consider the evolution of the intensity of each wave:

where the susceptibility χ(3) (ωS; ωS, ωP, -ωP) is determined by Eq. (13.1.36). The 
maximum nonlinear response is observed when Eq. (13.1.22) is satisﬁed. 
To focus on the nonlinear coupling of the electron subsystems and the nuclear 
vibrations of molecules, we leave only the resonant term ωP - ωS = ωv in 
Eq. (13.1.36). It should be noted that even in the resonance g2 /γv(ωσ - ωS) = 
(g/γv)(g/(ωσ - ωS)) ~ (g/γv)ε because (g/γv) ~  ωv/γv ~ Qv > 1; we consider molecules 
in which (g/γv)ε > 1 (see Eq. (13.1.6)). Finally, we arrive at the following

From Eq. (13.1.46) one can see that the nonlinear coupling of the electronic sub-
systems and the nuclear vibrations of molecules results in the induction of a speciﬁc 
polarization of the medium, which phase leads the external ﬁeld E(ωS)  by  π/2. This 
means that the polarization of the media, induced by the ﬁeld E(ωP), transfers the 
energy to the ﬁeld E(ωS). In other words, under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld E(ωP), the 
molecule radiates a part of its energy into the ﬁeld E(ωS). It can be treated as the 
energy transfer from the ﬁeld E(ωP) to the ﬁeld E(ωS). The latter can be shown by 
substituting Eq. (13.1.42) for the electric ﬁeld into wave equation (13.1.39) 
and using the paraxial optics approximation jkSAS(z)j ≫ j∂AS(z)/∂zj. In this case, 
the left-hand side of Eq. (13.1.39) takes the form:

increase in the signal ﬁeld AS(z), while the term ~(-jAP(z)j2 ) in Eq. (13.1.50) causes

the pump power is sufﬁcient for an increase of the signal ﬁeld as it travels through 
the medium. Historically, this enhancement has been attributed to the SRS of the 
pump wave into the signal wave and is called the Raman ampliﬁcation. 
Figure 13.1 illustrates the energy transfer in the SRS process. At the initial point 
z = 0, there is a large pump ﬁeld and a small signal ﬁeld. At small distances from the 
source, the energy transferred from the large pump ﬁeld compensates for the loss of 
the signal ﬁeld, characterized by γs = kSIm 
ε  ωS
ð
 Þ. As a result, the signal ﬁeld 
increases as it propagates in the system. At large distances, the pump ﬁeld weakens, 
and the energy transferred to the signal ﬁeld is no longer sufﬁcient to compensate for 
the signal loss (inequality (13.1.51) is no longer satisﬁed), so that both the signal and 
pump intensities fall off.

To summarize, in this subsection, by employing Eq. (13.1.36) for the nonlinear 
susceptibility χ(3) , we show that while considering the coherent parts of Raman 
scattering, the Raman ampliﬁcation may be described by classical ﬁelds. 
13.3 
The Phenomenon of “Stimulated Raman Scattering 
(SRS)” 
SRS is observed in gases [9, 10], liquids [11, 12], and solids [13, 14]. The most 
important applications of the phenomenon are the visualization of biological samples 
[15] and signal ampliﬁcation in telecommunication ﬁbers [16]. 
Often, the quantum description of SRS, or rather of the Raman ampliﬁcation, is 
based on a generalized description of the ordinary Raman effect [17] as a two-photon 
process that employs virtual levels (see Chap. 9, Fig. 9.3). In contrast to the 
spontaneous Raman scattering, in SRS, it is assumed that there are coherent photons 
at Stokes frequency, ωS = ωP - ωv, and the excited molecules at the virtual level. By 
absorbing a photon with the energy ħωP from the pump wave, the atom goes to the 
virtual level (left blue arrow in Fig. 9.3). Then, according to Einstein’s theory (see 
Remark 13.2), emitting coherent photons with the energy ħωS, the virtual state 
decays through a spontaneous and stimulated process, passing to the ground level 
with one excited vibron (green arrow in Fig. 9.3). This process leads to the ampli-
ﬁcation of the primary weak coherent Stokes wave. Thanks to this interpretation, this 
phenomenon is called stimulated Raman scattering. 
Adding a resonator to the described scheme increases the life of the photon in the 
resonator. The decay of the next excited atom occurs in the presence of the earlier 
emitted photon. After each emission, the number of photons increases. That is, the 
cavity mode is ampliﬁed, which in turn leads to an increase in the probability of the 
decay process through stimulated emission. Thus, at a sufﬁciently high population of

the virtual level, a conventional generator scheme is implemented—an ampliﬁer 
with positive feedback. This scheme describes the operation of a Raman laser, which 
is similar to the operation of a conventional laser.

Remark 13.2 Einstein Coefﬁcients 
Developing Bohr’s idea, Einstein showed that the transition between high and 
low levels of an atom under the action of a monochromatic EM wave is due to 
the three processes—stimulated absorption, stimulated emission, and sponta-
neous emission. The probabilities of these processes are called Einstein 
coefﬁcients. 
The greater the intensity of traveling light, the higher the probability of the 
ﬁrst two processes compared to the spontaneous emission. For us, it is 
important that at spontaneous emission, photons are emitted in any direction, 
while at stimulated absorption and stimulated emission, photons are absorbed 
from or radiated in the direction of the incident wave. The propagation of an 
intense incident wave is mainly determined by the ﬁrst two processes. 
For lasing, the stimulated emission should prevail over the spontaneous 
absorption. This implies the existence of the population inversion to enhance 
the wave. That is, the number NU of atoms in the upper-level state should be 
greater than the number NL of atoms in the lower-level state. The greater the 
difference NU - NL, the higher the ampliﬁcation. The stimulated emission is 
the main mechanism for generating coherent light in ampliﬁed spontaneous 
emission (ASE) [18] and lasing. 
The physical difference between Raman and conventional lasers is that the 
Raman ampliﬁcation is caused not by the inverse population of the excited (virtual) 
level but by the transfer of energy from the pump wave to the cavity mode due to the 
nonlinear properties of the active medium. However, this requires the presence of a 
coherent part of the radiation at the Stokes frequency. 
Another feature of Raman laser is that the ampliﬁcation occurs due to coherent 
pumping, the frequency of which is related to the generation frequency ωgen by the 
relation ωgen = ωP - ωv = ωSt. Therefore, to maintain generation, a coherent pump 
wave generator is needed. This is usually another laser that is pumped by incoherent 
radiation. 
The experimental conﬁguration for observing Raman lasing is notably straight-
forward: it involves a resonator excited by a laser operating at the frequency ωP. This 
resonator is ﬁlled with a medium comprised of Raman-active molecules, character-
ized by a vibrational frequency ωv. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the 
resonator has a singular resonant frequency ωR = ωP - ωv = ωSt with a ﬁnite 
linewidth. 
In such a setting, a weak ﬁeld at the Stokes frequency is generated within the 
resonator. The initial increase in the number of photons in the resonator mode occurs 
due to the Purcell effect, which increases the probability of radiation into the cavity

mode. Given the ﬁnite quality factor of the resonator, a part of photons at the Stokes 
frequency accumulate within the resonator mode. Other photons either dissipate or 
exit the resonator if the system is open. 
254
13
The Progress in Study of the Raman Effect After the Laser Invention
At this stage, the ﬁeld inside the resonator is still incoherent. The coherence arises 
due to the Bose statistics of photons. The probability of radiation into a speciﬁc 
mode with a given phase increases proportional to the number of photons already 
occupying that mode. The other photons are emitted into resonator modes with 
different phases; they form incoherent radiation. This differs from the process of 
stimulated emission predicted by Einstein, who assumed that photons are always 
emitted into the mode of incident radiation with a given phase. Instead, the photons 
are more likely to be emitted into the mode containing the highest number of 
photons. Initially, the preference for photons being emitted into this mode might 
be weak. Since the coherence of Raman scattering is determined by the coherence of 
vibrons, their presence is an additional and decisive factor in forming Raman lasing. 
Therefore, Raman ampliﬁcation is a collective phenomenon but not a result of 
successive single events of stimulated emission. 
At the resonator’s output, we observe a signal whose intensity is determined by 
the Q-factor of the resonator, the efﬁciency of the signal output from the resonator, 
and the intensity of the incident pumping wave. Naturally, even with coherent 
pumping, the signal output is incoherent. 
Initially, while the vibrational modes in the molecule are thermal, no additional 
phenomenon unfolds. Illumination of the resonator at the Stokes frequency does not 
yield any ampliﬁcation. Therefore, we cannot talk about stimulated Raman ampli-
ﬁcation at this stage. 
As the pumping amplitude increases, coherent vibrons and Stokes photons build 
up in the resonator. In essence, two coherent wave components emerge within the 
resonator, with a frequency difference equal to the Stokes shift. As we have seen, this 
scenario leads to the ampliﬁcation of the Stokes wave through the pumping wave—a 
phenomenon commonly recognized as Raman ampliﬁcation. In turn, the ampliﬁca-
tion of the coherent part of the Stokes wave increases the number of coherent 
photons (see Sect. 13.4 for details). This process can be referred to as stimulated 
Raman emission, albeit distinct from the conventional Einsteinian mechanism. 
Sooner or later, self-oscillations arise in the resonator, and these oscillations involve 
both photons and vibrons [19, 20]. 
The occurrence of Raman lasing oscillations depends on the interplay between 
the resonator’s Q-factor and the vibron’s quality factor. This could potentially lead to 
Raman instability within the molecule, in which coherent vibrons and the incoherent 
Stokes signal are ampliﬁed. In scenarios where the Q-factors are comparable, optical 
lasing occurs alongside the buildup of coherent vibrons. The operation of the laser in 
the regime of well-developed coherent vibrons is discussed in Chap. 14.

13.4 
Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (СARS) 
In this section, we continue considering the coherent Raman phenomena caused by 
the illumination of a Raman-active molecule with two coherent waves. 
As shown in Chap. 12, spontaneous Raman scattering and SERS give an inco-
herent Raman response. The reason for this is that only thermal vibrons take part in 
the Raman scattering process. An increase in the intensity of the incident beam 
and/or making it coherent does not result in a coherent Raman response. As shown in 
Sect. 13.1, in the case of two incident coherent waves (pump and signal), due to the 
nonlinearity of the Fröhlich interaction between the electronic and vibronic sub-
systems, a beat frequency (the difference between pump and signal frequencies) 
appears in the spectrum of the driving force in the equation for vibrons. If the beat 
frequency coincides with the eigenfrequency of nuclear oscillations, the resonant 
excitation of coherent vibrons begins, leading to the coherent Raman response. 
The considered in Sect. 13.1 coherent Raman response is very weak compared to 
incoherent responses. The situation can be improved if we take into account a 
response from many molecules. In this case, the intensity of the incoherent signal 
is proportional to the number of molecules N, while the response of the coherent 
signal may be proportional to N2 . Thus, to increase the coherent radiation, we should 
synchronize the oscillations of the molecules. For this purpose, in the case of Raman 
laser, many molecules are placed in a high-Q resonator. Studying CARS, we 
consider N Raman-active molecules occupying a subwavelength volume. If the 
number of molecules is large, the coherent response may be greater than the 
incoherent response. Thus, the CARS enhancement is a collective effect arising 
due to a quadratic increase of the coherent signal with an increase in the number N of 
molecules while the incoherent signal increases linearly. 
In experiments on CARS, molecules are illuminated with two waves with fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2 (we assume that ω2 > ω1). The difference in these frequencies 
ωB = ω2 - ω1 (the beat frequency) is chosen to be close to the vibrational frequency 
ωv of the nuclei in the molecule [21–23]. In both CARS and the Raman laser, 
coherent vibrons are excited. The main difference between the Raman laser and 
CARS is that different mechanisms cause coherent vibron excitations. In the Raman 
laser, this mechanism is related to the beginning of auto-oscillations of both the 
photons on the Stokes frequency and vibrons. In CARS, the Stokes wave is an 
external one. Consequently, the coherent vibrons are parametrically excited. 
Unlike the cases considered in the previous sections, in CARS, the incident 
beams are assumed to be so strong that because of the weakness of the Raman 
scattering, the energy transfer from one beam to the other can be neglected. 
In spontaneous Raman scattering, the illumination of the molecule by a single 
monochromatic wave leads to responses at three different frequencies (Rayleigh, 
Stokes, and anti-Stokes). If we illuminate the molecule by two waves with frequen-
cies ω1 and ω2, we could expect the responses on six frequencies—two Rayleigh 
frequencies ω1 and ω2, two Stokes frequencies ω1 - ωv and ω2 - ωv, and two anti-
Stokes frequencies ω1 + ωv and ω2 + ωv. However, in the case of the resonance

ωB = ωv, instead of spontaneous Raman scattering, one observes more intensive 
CARS that is characterized by signiﬁcant coherent responses on four frequencies 
only, namely, on two Rayleigh frequencies ω1 and ω2, the CSRS frequency, 
ωCSRS = 2ω1 - ω2 = ω1 - ωv, and CARS frequency ωCARS = 2ω2 - ω1 = ω2 + ωv. 
256

The smallness of the involved Rabi frequencies compared to ω1 and ω2 allows us 
to employ the perturbation theory developed in Sect. 13.1 to perform quantitative 
estimations.

to exp(-i(2ω2 - ω1)t) in the right-hand side of Eq. (13.1.18). In contrast to the 
consideration of SRS, we should now take into account that ΩP ~ ΩS. As a result, 
disregarding the off-resonant terms, Eq. (13.1.18) is reduced to

ð13:2:2Þ 
The natures of the two terms in the square brackets on the right-hand side of 
Eq. (13.2.1) are different. The unity appears due to the natural nonlinearity of the 
molecule caused by the population saturation of the quantum levels of the electronic 
system; this term has no resonances and is usually considered as an off-resonant 
background. The second term relates to the interaction of the electronic and vibra-
tional degrees of freedom of the molecule. Due to this interaction, the effect of the 
external ﬁeld on the electronic subsystem leads to the excitation of coherent vibrons 
at the beat frequency ωB. This phenomenon has a resonant nature; the resonance 
occurs at ωB = ωv. The presence of the second term means that the more vibrons we 
have, the more photons we obtain. 
The dimensionless parameter that determines the ratio between the off-resonant 
background and the resonant signal of CARS is g2 /γvjω2 - ωσj (see Eq. (13.2.1)). 
(This parameter is greater than unity if nuclear vibrations have a high-quality factor 
Qv = ωv/γv ~ g/γv ≫ ωv/g; see Eq. (13.1.5).). If g2 /γvjω2 - ωσj > 1, the CARS signal

signiﬁcantly exceeds the background determined by the nonlinearity that does not 
depend on the Fröhlich interaction. For example, for molecules of acetonite and 
various oils, the magnitude g2 /γvjω2 - ωσj ~ 10 and the effect of CARS are strongly 
manifested; this is not so for polystyrene in which g2 /γv ω2 - ωσ 
0.1.

For a single molecule, the coherent response is much weaker than the incoherent 
one; it is however; increasing the number of molecules may reverse the relationship 
between signal amplitudes.

ncoh

~ 10 - 7 . In other words, the number of coherent vibrons is smaller by 
many orders of magnitude than the number of incoherent vibrons. However, the 
coherent response is proportional to the squared number of molecules N2 , while the 
spontaneous signal is proportional to N. Thus, the above estimates give that for 
N ≫nnon‐coh

107 , the coherent signal becomes larger than the incoherent one. 
In CARS, the resonance condition is ωB = ωv; therefore, by varying ωB in 
experiment, one can determine both ωv and γv. 
Let us consider how the change in the frequency ω1 affects the spectrum of light 
scattering on a molecule. In the molecule, the electronic subsystem and the vibra-
tional subsystem of nuclei couple, but only the electronic subsystem radiates. 
Therefore, the expression for the dipole moment of the electronic subsystem

13.4.2 
The Susceptibility of Third Order 
As shown in the previous subsection, quantum mechanics predicts that if 
ω2 - ω1 = ωv, the vibrations of nuclei are resonantly excited by two coherent 
waves (see Eq. (13.2.4)). The arising vibrons are coherent. Consequently, the 
oscillations of the electronic subsystem are modulated by coherent vibrons, and 
the response of the electronic subsystem is also coherent. 
Since the scattered signal is coherent, it can be considered as a classical ﬁeld. 
From this point of view, CARS is a nonlinear four-wave mixing effect. That allows 
us to explain CARS employing the phenomenological theory of nonlinear optics 
[28, 29]. 
The key moment of the approach is the use of the nonlinear susceptibility of the 
third-order χ(3) . The expression for χ(3) is usually obtained by the phenomenological 
approach, as described in Sect. 13.2.1 (see Eq. (13.1.35)). For CARS and CSRS, χ(3) 
connects different waves, and we have to consider two susceptibilities:

ﬁeld due to a ﬁnite number of levels (in this example, there are only two).

Using the nonlinear susceptibility for the CARS conﬁguration, we can describe the

As discussed in the previous subsection, even though the number of coherent 
vibrons is smaller by many orders of magnitude than noncoherent vibrations, the 
CARS signal can dominate spontaneous Raman scattering in experiment. There are 
several reasons for this: 
1. The CARS signal grows quadratically with the increasing concentration of 
molecules, while spontaneous Raman scattering grows linearly. 
2. If the illuminated volume occupied by Raman-active molecules is anisotropic, 
then the coherent Raman signal is strongly directional (see Eq. (13.2.23)).

The Progress in Study of the Raman Effect After the Laser Invention
3. The width of the CARS signal spectrum is determined by the linewidth of the 
light sources and may be narrower than the width of the spontaneous Raman 
signal, which is determined by γv. 
To summarize, it is the coherence that leads to a relatively strong signal in CARS. 
Due to the smallness of χ(3) , the average number of coherent vibrons responsible for 
CARS is 105 - 107 times less than the number of thermal vibrons responsible for 
spontaneous Raman scattering. However, the spontaneous emission of Raman 
scattering is proportional to the number of molecules N in the spot of the ﬂare, 
while the signals of the CARS and CSRS are proportional to N2 . Despite the 
smallness of χ(3) , the factor of N may make the latter signals much stronger than 
that of spontaneous Raman scattering.

Chapter 14 
Raman Effect in Non-Raman Lasers 
In this chapter, we discuss the inﬂuence of nuclear vibrations in active materials with 
strong electron-phonon coupling on the amplifying properties of conventional lasers. 
Such materials as colloidal [1, 2] and epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) [3–5], perov-
skites [6–8], and dye molecules [9, 10] are characterized by a high gain and are 
widely used for miniaturizing lasers [11–13]. 
As a rule, observed conventional gain in such lasers is much greater than that due 
to the SRS. Therefore, even in lasers using active media with a strong electron-
phonon interaction, the inﬂuence of optical phonons on laser operation is usually not 
exhibited. Nevertheless, such materials can have large Raman cross sections [14–17] 
that may lead to unusual laser behavior [18]. In addition, in such lasers, the action of 
the EM ﬁeld on the electronic subsystem makes it possible to amplify phonons. 
Thus, in addition to a large light ampliﬁcation, systems with a strong electron-
phonon coupling may effectively amplify optical phonons and lead to the creation 
of phonon nanolasers [19]. 
In the amplifying media based on materials with a large Raman scattering cross 
section, the Fröhlich constant g may be comparable to or even larger than the Rabi 
constant responsible for coupling the resonator electric ﬁeld and the active medium 
polarization [20, 21]. To be speciﬁc, we consider amplifying media based on QD 
(see Ref. [18] and Remark 14.1). However, the results of this subsection are 
applicable to other materials with strong electron-phonon coupling. 
Remark 14.1 Quantum Dots 
QDs are semiconductor nanocrystals with sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nm. 
Their small size gives them unique optical and electronic properties; for 
example, the emission wavelength of a QD depends on its size. The behavior 
of QDs arises from the conﬁnement of charge carriers (electrons and holes) 
within a small volume. This conﬁnement restricts the motion of charge

Raman Effect in Non-Raman Lasers
Usually, QDs have a transition frequency between their ground state and 
the ﬁrst excited state in optical or IR ranges. Due to high anharmonism, 
transitions to higher energy levels are less probable under illumination by 
monochromatic light; therefore, these transitions do not signiﬁcantly impact 
the QD behavior. For this reason, TLS is a good model for describing QDs. 
QDs have a wide range of applications. These include displays, lasers, 
light-emitting diodes, bioimaging, solar cells, and quantum computing. 
We model the operation of a laser consisting of a single-mode resonator with the 
frequency ωa and QDs serving as an active medium. In QDs, excitations of the 
electronic degrees of freedom usually appear as excitons—quasiparticles formed by 
binding an electron and a hole. Excitons may interact with the quantized vibrations 
of QD nuclei—optical phonons (see Remark 2.1). 
We consider a single optical phonon mode with the eigenfrequency ωv. Since 
underlying lasing is a resonant phenomenon, the electronic subsystem of the QD can 
be modeled by a TLS, the ground state |gi of which is in the valence band, and the 
excited state |ei is in the conduction band; the transition frequency between these 
states is ωσ. 
We emphasize that we consider a conventional laser scheme that differs from the 
Raman laser that is discussed in Sect. 13.3. In this chapter, we study a laser whose 
resonator size L is small enough to ensure inequality Δω ≫ ωv. Here Δω~c/L is the 
difference between neighboring resonant frequencies. Thus, the effect of the Raman 
laser can be neglected. We assume that L ≪ c/ωv~100 μm. 
Our system can be described by 
H = ħωaa{ a þ ħωσσ{ σ þ ħΩR aσ{ þ a{ σ 
þ ħωvb 
{ b þ ħgσ{ σ b 
{ þ b : 
ð14:1:1Þ 
In this Hamiltonian, unlike Hamiltonian (10.1.23), the TLS interacts with the 
quantized mode of the resonator rather than with the classical ﬁeld of EM wave. 
The Fröhlich constant can be evaluated by using the value of the Raman 
scattering cross section σCross_section at the Stokes frequency (Eq. (11.1.49)). 
The 
experimentally 
measured 
value 
of 
σCross_section 
for 
CdSe 
QDs 
is 
σCross_section ≈ 4  10-6 Å2 [22]. Using the values of the phonon frequency 
ωv ≈ 0.025 eV (such a frequency corresponds to the optical phonon in CdSe [23]) 
and the QD dipole moment deg ≈ 5 ÷ 10 D, we obtain that the Fröhlich constant is of 
the order of g ≃ 10-2 eV which we use in this chapter. 
To describe relaxation processes, it is necessary to introduce reservoirs, which 
interact with electronic and phonon subsystems of the QD and the resonator mode.

We consider different reservoirs describing Ohmic losses in the resonator, energy 
relaxation of the exciton, energy relaxation of optical phonons, and the phonon 
reservoir responsible for exciton dephasing. Using the approach developed in Sects. 
13.2.1 and 13.2.2, we arrive at the following equations of motion, which are the 
expanded Maxwell-Bloch equations for expectation values of the operators a, σ, b, 
and D [14, 21, 24, 25]:

Solving Eqs. (14.1.2)–(14.1.5) does not allow for a detailed description of the 
spontaneous emission process but describes the stimulated emission rather well 
[21, 26]. These equations describe an indirect coupling between the resonator 
mode described by the operator a and an optical phonon of the active medium 
described by the operator b. Indeed, Eq. (14.1.2) includes the interaction of the 
resonator mode with the TLS through the term -iΩRσ, while Eq. (14.1.3) has the 
term -ig(b + b)σ that couples the TLS with phonons. The direct interaction of the 
resonator mode with phonons is absent because we assume that QDs are Raman-
active. 
14.1
The Semiclassical Theory of Conventional Laser
267
Below, we describe the various operational regimes of a laser by three parameters 
of the problem. The ﬁrst parameter is the Fröhlich interaction constant g. At  g = 0, 
we deal with conventional lasers. The second relevant parameter is the pump rate γp, 
which determines the transition to the lasing regime. Instead of γp, we describe the 
pump rate with the related parameter D0 = (γp - γD)/(γp + γD). The third parameter 
of our problem is the resonator eigenfrequency ωa. Note that ωσ is kept constant. 
This means that throughout this chapter, we deal with the resonant Raman effect. 
14.1 
The Semiclassical Theory of Conventional Laser 
The conventional laser model includes a resonator whose eigenmode frequency is 
ωR. The resonator is ﬁlled with atoms, for simplicity, modeled by a TLS with a 
transition frequency ωσ and with a dipole moment described by the operator σ.  To  
achieve lasing we should have ωR~ωσ~ω, where ω is the frequency on which 
stimulated emission occurs. Assuming that all operators vary with frequency ω, 
passing to slowly varying operator amplitudes, and using the rotating wave approx-
imation, the dipole interaction of the stimulated emission ﬁeld with the TLS may be 
described by the model Hamiltonian, which includes the Hamiltonians of quantized 
resonator mode ħωRa{ 
RaR, TLS ħωσσþσ, and the dipole interaction of the mode 
with the atom (the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian):

H = ħωRa{ 
RaR þ ħωσσ{ σ þ ħΩR a{ 
Rσ þ σþaR
ð14:1:6Þ 
Now, we can obtain the Heisenberg equations of motions for operators aR, σ, and the 
TLS population inversion D = σ{ σ - σσ{ . Describing the relaxation of the TLS 
polarization due to spontaneous emission by the relaxation time τσ and the relaxation 
of the TLS population inversion to the constant unsaturated TLS population inver-
sion D0 by τD, we arrive at the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. The value of D0 is 
maintained by external pumping. (See Problem 1.1.) 
268
14
Raman Effect in Non-Raman Lasers
It is worth emphasizing that the spontaneous emission is described by the 
relaxation term and noises, while the stimulated emission is described by the 
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. Now, we can transition to slowly varying ampli-
tudes aR, σ  exp - iωt
ð
Þ. Note that the frequency ω is the frequency of self-
oscillations that differs from both ωR and ωσ. It must be determined during the 
solution process. 
For estimations, it is convenient to transition to observables of the operators 
apl = apl , σ = σ
h i, and D = 2σ{ σ - 1 . The next approximation that is usually 
made is to assume that hDaRi = hDihaRi [20, 25]. As a result, we arrive at the 
Maxwell-Bloch equations:

where δ = ω - ωσ and Δ = ω - ωR. 
Equations (14.1.7)–(14.1.9) have a trivial stationary solution a = 0, σ = 0, and 
D = D0. At  D < Dth (where Dth is some value that should be found), this solution is 
stable, but it becomes unstable at D > Dth, when a new stable stationary solution 
arises. 
To ﬁnd the frequency ω, we need to use the stationary solution of Eqs. (14.1.7)– 
(14.1.9) at  D > Dth. Eliminating σ, we arrive at the following equation in complex 
numbers to determine ω:

and (14.1.13) determine the lasing threshold Dth and lasing frequency ω, 
respectively. 
14.2 
The Regime of Convention Laser Without Excitation 
of Coherent Phonons 
The trivial time-independent solution to Eqs. (14.1.2)–(14.1.5) that corresponds to 
the regime in which coherent oscillations of a, σ, and b are absent has the form:

ð14:2:4Þ 
This solution is analogous to the trivial zero-valued solution for a conventional laser, 
in which the phonon degree of freedom of the active medium molecule is not taken 
into account. Usually, this solution is stable below the lasing threshold Dth_opt. In our 
case, the trivial solution is characterized by a nonzero time-independent expectation 
value of the phonon operator btriv, corresponding to a constant displacement of 
nuclei. It appears for the following reason. When a molecule is excited, its nuclear 
equilibrium positions change. Therefore, pumping results in nonzero occupation of 
the excited state with the population D0 + 1. As a result, nuclei move to new 
equilibrium positions, and Eq. (14.2.4) determines these positions with respect to 
the equilibrium position for the ground state. (A similar phenomenon is the Kapitza 
pendulum. The equilibrium position of the pendulum changes due to high-frequency 
vibrations of the pendulum suspension point [28].) 
It is expected that as the pump rate characterized by D0 increases, the lasing 
begins. When D0 > Dth_opt, the trivial solution becomes unstable, and a stable self-
oscillating solution arises. The computer simulation indeed shows such a transition 
to the lasing self-oscillating regime. There are still no coherent phonons in this 
regime, and the coherent part of b, which we denote as bph, is still equal to zero. 
Since we are interested in the stationary behavior of the system, i.e., the behavior 
at large times, t ≫γ - 1 
a

ð14:2:8Þ 
Here, aopt and σopt are time-independent amplitudes; ωgen and Dth_opt are the 
frequency and the threshold of the laser generation. These four quantities should 
still be determined. According to Eqs. (14.2.3) and (14.2.7) 
D = D0 
if 
D0 < Dth opt 
and 
D = Dth opt 
if 
D0 > Dth opt: 
ð14:2:9Þ 
Substituting Eqs. (14.2.5)–(14.2.8) into Eqs. (14.1.2)–(14.1.5) and equating the real 
and imaginary parts of Eq. (14.1.3) to zero, after some algebra, we obtain the 
following expression for the population inversion and the self-oscillation frequency:

(14.2.11) have terms proportional to g2 , resulting in the dependence of the stationary 
threshold population inversion and the frequency of self-oscillations ωgen(g) on the 
Fröhlich constant g. In particular, the frequency of self-oscillations, which appear

Remark 14.2 Effective change in the exciton frequency due to a constant 
displacement of molecular nuclei in QD under incoherent pumping. To  
study the spontaneous emission of a TLS interacting with phonons but not 
with the EM ﬁeld, we employ our basis system of equations (14.1.2)–(14.1.5), 
where we put ΩR = 0. The trivial stationary solution to this system still has 
the form: 
ast = 0, σst = 0, Dst = D0, bst = - g Dth opt þ 1 
2ωb - iγb 
: 
Let us consider the dynamics of small deviations of the QD dipole moment σ 
from its equilibrium position. Substituting σ = σst + δσ, b = bst + δb, and 
D = Dst + δD into the basis system of equations, assuming ωσ ≫ g (this 
inequality is always satisﬁed since ωσ lies in the optical range and g is in the IR 
range), and implying that the value of δb is small compared to bst, we obtain:

D0 + 1, which corresponds to the population of the excited state of the exciton 
at a nonzero pump rate D0 > - 1.

For the ﬁeld amplitude in the resonator and the polarization, using Eqs. (14.2.10)– 
(14.2.11), we can obtain the following expressions (see Eqs. (14.1.7)–(14.1.16)):

Such a behavior corresponds to the Hopf bifurcation at D0 = Dth_opt. Though 
phonons inﬂuence the bifurcation process in the regime discussed above, they are 
not involved in the self-oscillations. 
14.3 
The Laser Regimes with Excitation of Coherent 
Phonons 
In this section, we show that a further increase in the pump rate may lead to another 
Hopf bifurcation, resulting in either the generation of coherent phonons or deter-
ministic chaos. 
14.3.1 
The Resonant Case ωa = ω g
ð Þ  
σ 
: The Second Hopf 
Bifurcation Phonons 
Let us ﬁrst consider the resonant case ωa = ω g
ð Þ  
σ . Now, we have two parameters g and 
D0, which determine possible operational regimes of the laser. These regimes can be 
found by solving Eqs. (14.1.2)–(14.1.5) for D0 > Dth_opt. This system of equations 
can only be solved numerically. 
The possible operational regimes on the plane (g, D0) obtained by computer 
simulation are shown in Fig. 14.1. One can see that there are two threshold values 
of the pump rate D0, which separate different regimes. When the pump rate D0 is less 
than the optical threshold Dth_opt (shown by the left solid vertical line) determined by 
Eq. (14.2.10), only trivial solution (14.2.1)–(14.2.4) is stable (the blue area in 
Fig. 14.1). Note that at a large pump rate, a disruption of the generation occurs. 
This is shown by the right vertical blue strip in Fig. 14.1. In this region, the 
generation stops due to an increase in the dissipation rate of the exciton polarization 
γσ with an increase in the pump rate γp. When the pump rate becomes as high as 
γp ≫ γD, γdeph, the dissipation of the polarization becomes so large that laser 
generation is hindered [29, 30].

Fig. 14.1 Operational regimes in the plane of parameters (g, D0). There is no lasing in the blue 
region (D0 < Dth_opt(g)), in which only the trivial solution is stable. In the right blue area, the 
generation is disrupted by a large pump rate. The yellow region is the self-oscillating laser regime 
without the excitation of coherent phonons. The orange region shows the regime of self-oscillations 
of coherent phonons and the periodic-in-time part of the optical ﬁeld in the resonator. The system 
parameters are ΩR = 0.01eV, γb = 0.0002eV, γa = 0.001eV, ωb = 0.01eV, ωσ = 2.4eV, 
γdeph = 0.005eV, and γD = 0.001eV 
When D0 > Dth_opt(g), the numerical analysis of Eqs. (14.1.2)–(14.1.5) shows 
that the trivial solution becomes unstable, and a new self-oscillating solution without 
coherent phonons arises (see Eq. (14.2.14)). This solution is stable for any g until 
D0 < Dth_ph(g = 1) (the yellow region to the left of the dashed vertical line in 
Fig. 14.1). In this regime, the expectation value of the nuclear displacements due to 
their coherent vibrations about equilibrium positions is zero, bph = 0. Therefore, 
despite accounting for the electron-phonon interaction, the laser radiation spectrum 
contains neither Stokes nor anti-Stokes frequencies. It means that nuclei do not take 
part in self-oscillation. This is exactly what is usually assumed when the electron-
phonon interaction is neglected. 
In the region D0 > Dth_ph(g = 1), there is a curve D0 = Dth_ph(g), the solid curve, 
which bounds the orange area in Fig. 14.1. In this area, the lasing regime without 
coherent phonons becomes unstable, and as we show below, a new regime with 
coherent phonons arises. We also show that this is a new Hopf bifurcation leading to 
the formation of new self-oscillations at the frequency close to ωv. 
To study the latter regime, it is convenient to present the trial form for the 
expectation values of the operators a, σ, D, and b in the following form:

a tð Þ = aopt þ aph tð Þ  exp - iωgent ,
ð14:2:15Þ 
σ tð Þ = σopt þ σph tð Þ  exp - iωgent ,
ð14:2:16Þ 
D tð Þ = Dth opt þ Dph tð Þ,
ð14:2:17Þ 
b tð Þ = - g Dth opt þ 1 
2ωv - iγv 
þ bph tð Þ:
ð14:2:18Þ 
Here, we split the amplitudes of a(t), σ(t), D(t), and b(t) into the time-independent 
parts (aopt, σopt, Dth_opt, and -g(Dth_opt + 1)/(2ωv - iγb)), corresponding to the 
conventional laser regime (see Eqs. (14.2.5)–(14.2.4)), and the time-dependent parts, 
aph(t), σph(t), Dph(t), and bph(t) determined by Eqs. (14.2.15)–(14.2.18), forming new 
nonharmonic self-oscillations with the period: 
T = 2π=ωv,gen,
ð14:2:19Þ 
where ωv, gen  2π/T ≠ ωv is the lowest frequency that determines the periodicity of 
self-oscillations of aph(t), σph(t), Dph(t), and bph(t).

In order to characterize the transition to the self-oscillation with coherent pho-
nons, we average the quantities |aph(t)|, |σph(t)|, |Dth(t)|, and |bth(t)| over the period of 
the self-oscillations:

for ﬁxed g > gcr. This dependence behaves like 
D0 - Dth ph, which shows that 
at the second threshold Dth_ph (the vertical dashed line in Fig. 14.1), another Hopf 
bifurcation occurs. 
In the new regime, the spectrum of the self-oscillations is not characterized 
by a single frequency ωv, gen. These self-oscillations can be presented as the Fourier

independent. The sidelobes of aph(t) appear due to the cascade effect of Raman 
lasing discussed in Sect. 13.3. Indeed, since we are working above the lasing 
threshold, the number of coherent vibrons is much greater than unity. Consequently, 
the Stoke and anti-Stokes signals are also coherent. If the corresponding frequencies 
lie inside the line of lasing on the main lasing frequency ω g

(n = 0), then the Stoke 
and anti-Stokes signals (n = ± 1) also start lasing.

trated in Fig. 14.4b, which shows the projection of the closed cycle of self-
oscillations on the space |a|, |b|, and D. One can see that the system dynamics is 
presented by a closed curve, which is the manifestation of regime periodicity. 
14.3
The Laser Regimes with Excitation of Coherent Phonons
277
The appearance of bph ≠ 0 implies the emergence of coherent phonons. The latter 
does not appear in spontaneous Raman scattering, even if the incident ﬁeld is 
coherent. Thus, this fact cannot be attributed to the Raman scattering of the laser 
mode. This is conﬁrmed by the computer experiment. Figure 14.1 shows that the 
threshold for a coherent harmonic laser mode Dth_opt and the threshold Dth_ph for the 
appearance of coherent phonons are different. 
Usually, the coherent phonons arise in systems in CARS or after the onset of 
Raman lasing. As discussed in Sect. 13.4, in CARS, the appearance of coherent 
phonons is associated with the resonant excitation of optical phonons at the fre-
quency difference of two incident coherent waves. In a conventional laser and in our 
scheme, the pumping is incoherent, and the only coherent wave is the resonator 
mode above the laser threshold Dth_opt. This is clearly not enough for the CARS 
mechanism to lead to the excitation of coherent phonons. 
14.3.2 
Nonresonant Case ω 
ω g
ð Þ  
Now, we consider the operational regimes in the case of ωa ≠ω g
ð Þ  
σ . For conventional 
lasers, in which electron-phonon interaction is negligible (g = 0), the optimal 
condition for lasing is matching the resonator frequency ωa with the transition 
frequency ωσ. When this happens, the laser threshold is minimal. With an increase 
in the frequency difference |ωa - ωσ|, the lasing threshold Dth_opt increases. There is 
the value of |ωa - ωσ|, at which Dth_opt becomes greater than D0. Then, the pump rate 
is not sufﬁcient to start lasing, and self-oscillation does not appear. The trivial 
solution becomes stable again; consequently, the lasing does not occur. 
As computer simulation shows, similar behavior is observed at g ≠0. In this case, 
however, the role of ωσ is played by ω g
ð Þ  
σ . At  a  ﬁxed pump rate D0 > Dth_opt, with an  
increase in the difference ωa - ω g
ð Þ  
σ 
, the lasing threshold also grows, and sooner or 
later, this should lead to the suppression of lasing. By computer simulation, for each 
g we can determine the interval of frequencies ωa, where lasing is observed. The 
lasing interval for a conventional laser now transforms into the lasing corridor on the 
plane (ωa, g) (see Fig. 14.5). 
The results of the computer simulation are shown in Fig. 14.5. On the plane of the 
parameters ωa and g, the dependence ω g
ð  Þ  
σ 
g
ð  Þ  at ﬁxed D0 > Dth_opt is shown by the 
solid blue line. The corridor of parameters for which the lasing is observed (the 
lasing corridor) is bounded by the dotted lines. Outside this corridor, only the trivial 
solution is stable, and the system does not lase. Below, we deal with the parameters 
inside the lasing corridor.

Raman Effect in Non-Raman Lasers
Fig. 14.5 Operational regimes of lasing in the parameter plane (ωa, g); (a) γσ = 0.005eV and (b) 
γσ = 0.002eV. In the blue areas, lasing is absent; the conventional lasing regime occurs in the 
yellow area; the operational regime with coherent phonons occupies the orange area; the regime of 
the chaotic operation occurs in the red area; the area where both trivial and common lasing regimes 
are stable is colored in green (yellow + blue); the area in which both the common laser regime 
and the regime with coherent phonons are stable is colored in brown (orange + blue); ﬁnally, the 
area in which both trivial and chaotic solutions are stable is colored in purple (red + blue). The 
system parameters are D0 = 0.6, ΩR = 0.01 eV, γv = 0.0002 eV, γa = 0.001 eV, ωv = 0.01 eV, 
ωσ = 2.4 eV, γD = 0.001 eV, and γp = 0.004 eV 
Inside the lasing corridor, a coherent self-oscillation of phonons in the active 
medium may occur simultaneously with the self-oscillation of the EM ﬁeld in the 
resonator. In Fig. 14.5, the region in which coherent phonons are excited is bounded 
by the solid black curve. In this ﬁgure, the stable solutions with coherent phonons 
belong to the orange area. 
Usually, at large times, the system dynamics is uniquely determined by the 
external parameters {ωa, g, D0} and is independent of initial conditions {a, σ, D, 
b}t = 0. The most intriguing property of this system is that there is an area in which 
two solutions corresponding to different physical regimes are stable. In Fig. 14.5, 
this area lies between the upper dotted line and the dashed line: in the green area, the 
trivial solution and the periodic harmonic solution are stable, while in the brown 
area, the trivial and periodic nonharmonic solutions are stable. Thus, for different 
initial values {a, σ, D, b}t = 0, with time increase, the system arrives at a different 
stationary state. For example, in the green area, for the initial conditions close to the 
trivial solution, the system does not begin lasing with time. If the initial conditions 
are far from the trivial solution, at large times, the conventional laser self-oscillation 
mode occurs. 
It should be noted that each point in Fig. 14.5 corresponds to a particular system 
having a speciﬁc resonator and active material. The resonator frequency ωa and the 
Fröhlich interaction constant g are plotted along the axes; the Rabi frequency and the 
pump rate are ﬁxed.

14.3.3 
The Transition from Self-Oscillations with Coherent 
Phonons to Chaos 
If the electron-phonon interaction is not present in the laser system that we consider, 
the chaotic regime does not arise [32]. Therefore, there is no reason to expect a 
transition of the considered system to chaos. Nonetheless, it is not so. The electron-
phonon interaction signiﬁcantly changes the laser dynamics. Namely, if the rate of 
the exciton dephasing γσ is reduced (but the inequality γa < γσ still holds), then areas 
of chaos appear in the region where coherent phonons may arise. Such a decrease in 
γσ can be achieved, for example, by lowering the temperature. For such a case, 
various operational regimes are shown in Fig. 14.5b. 
Figure 14.6a, b shows time dynamics |σ(t)| and the spectrum F|σ|(ω), respectively. 
The parameters g, D0, and ωa correspond to the white point in Fig. 14.5b. With the 
accuracy of our computer simulation, which is about 10-7 eV, all frequencies are 
present in the spectrum. Such a spectrum drastically differs from the discrete 
spectrum observed for self-oscillations (Fig. 14.4a). This is characteristic for a 
chaotic regime. 
To summarize the results discussed in this chapter, we can say that the electron-
phonon interaction may dramatically change the behavior of a laser [18]. It may lead 
to new regimes of laser dynamics which do not exist in conventional lasers. 
Moreover, it may convert a laser into a generator of coherent optical phonons. 
Finally, this interaction may lead to the dependence of the laser state on initial 
conditions, i.e., the initial values of the resonator ﬁeld, the active medium polariza-
tion, the population inversion, and the phonon amplitude govern which regime is 
realized.

parameters are the same as in Fig. 14.5

Conclusion 
In this book, the phenomena of inelastically scattered light on molecules are asso-
ciated with the excitation of the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule 
nuclei. The developed approach is based on the original qualitative ideas of classical 
physics—the modulation of the oscillation of the molecular dipole moment by 
vibrations of molecular nuclei. 
It is shown that this excitation is due to an indirect nonlinear interaction between 
electronic and nuclear subsystems of a molecule. This interaction can be described in 
terms of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian. The well-known effects of Raman scattering, 
such as CARS, CERS, SECARS, and SRS, are considered from a uniﬁed standpoint 
of 
quantum 
mechanics. 
The 
quantum-mechanical 
approach 
based 
on 
the 
Heisenberg-Langevin operator equations has been consistently developed from the 
ﬁrst principles. Within the framework of the developed approach, it was possible to 
answer a number of questions that do not have an answer in the framework of the 
traditional theory of dispersion based on the introduction of virtual levels. In 
particular, an explanation is given for the coherent properties of various responses. 
This includes the explanations of the coherence of Rayleigh scattering, the coher-
ence of Raman scattering generated by a single coherent wave, and the coherence of 
the Stokes and anti-Stokes signals generated by two coherent waves. 
Attention is drawn to the possibility of enhancing the Raman responses due to the 
excitation of vibrational oscillations of the nuclei of a molecule. It is an extra way, in 
addition to the gain in SERS. In the long run, it is necessary to consider the 
enhancement of the oscillations of nuclei in molecules due to the interaction with 
the phonons of both the substrate and the analyte in the crystalline state.

The general solution to Eq. (16.1.2) is  y0(t) = yC = 0 exp (Γt), where yC = 0 is any

Solution 
The expressions (16.2.1)–(16.2.3) enable us to calculate the emission spectrum. 
According to Wiener-Khintchine theorem, the spectrum is determined by the 
two-time correlation function of the dipole moment, which is proportional to 
σ{ t þ τ
ð
Þσ tð Þ  (for the derivation, see Sect. 3.4.2). For this correlator, we have: 
σ{ t þ τ
ð
Þσ tð Þ  = 
σ{ 
1 t þ τ
ð
Þ þ σ{ 
2 t þ τ
ð
Þ
 
σ1 tð Þ þ σ2 tð Þ
ð
Þ
 
= σ{

Þσ1 tð Þ  þ

ð
Þσ2 tð Þ  þ 
σ{ 
2 t þ τ
ð
Þσ1 tð Þ  þ 
σ{ 
2 t þ τ
ð
Þσ2 tð Þ  
ð16:2:4Þ 
Note that from Eq. (16.2.3), it follows that the second and the third terms on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (16.2.4) have the terms, which are linearly dependent on 
IFb τ0
ð Þ  = Fb τ0
ð Þ  or 
IF 
{ 
b τ0
ð Þ  = F 
{ 
b τ0
ð Þ  . According to general properties of 
thermal noises (see Problem 1.10 in Part I), 
F 
{ 
b tð Þ  = Fb tð Þ  = 0; thus, the second 
and third terms in right-hand side of Eq. (16.2.4) are zero. Thus, we have: 
σ{ t þ τ
ð
Þσ tð Þ  = σ{ 
1 t þ τ
ð
Þσ1 tð Þ  þ 
σ{ 
2 t þ τ
ð
Þσ2 tð Þ
ð16:2:5Þ 
Further, from Eq. (16.2.1), it follows that 
σ{

Thus, in the ﬁrst order, we have pure harmonic oscillations of the two-time 
correlator. 
The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (16.2.5) can be calculated using the 
explicit expression for σ2 (Eq. (16.2.3)). The result is

Throughout the problem, we suppose that the detuning |ωext - ωσ| is much larger 
than all dissipation rates γσ, γb. 
The sum of Eqs. (16.2.6) and (16.2.8) gives the total two-time correlation 
function. It can be presented in more convenient form if we introduce the following 
notations: S = Ω/2(ωext - ωσ) and ASt = AaSt = g2 /(ωext - ωσ)2 . The meaning of S is 
the Rayleigh response of the TLS on a coherent ﬁeld (see Eqs. (3.4.41) and (3.4.33) 
Part I). Using these notations and summing Eqs. (16.2.6) and (16.2.8), we obtain:

Problem 2.3 
Derive Eq. (12.2.32) for the two-time correlation function of the operator a. 
Solution 
First, we start with the Eqs. (12.2.27)–(12.2.28) from the main text: 
dσ2=dt þ - iωσ - γσ

Þσ2 = - iΩR pla2

ð16:3:2Þ 
Since we use the perturbation theory, in the right-hand side of Eq. (16.3.1), we 
should neglect the term proportional to a2 and take into account only the term 
proportional to σ1. Further, we substitute σ1 with SSERSe - iωexttI from Eq. (12.2.22) 
of the main text. As a result, from Eq. (16.3.1) we obtain: 
dσ2=dt þ - iωσ - γσ

We neglected the noise term in Eq. (16.4.4) because we are interested in the coherent

Problems for Part II
On the right-hand side, terms proportional to exp(-iωSt), exp(-iωPt), exp(-
i(2ωS - ωP)t), and exp(-i(2ωP - ωS)t) appear. These terms play the role of the 
monochromatic external forces, which cause responses of σ at the corresponding 
frequencies. The response on the frequency ωS corresponds to stimulated Raman 
scattering (SRS); responses on the frequencies 2ωS - ωP and 2ωP - ωS correspond 
to coherent Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering (CSRS and CARS, respectively). In 
this section, we are interested in the effect of SRS; therefore, in Eq. (16.4.19) we  
consider only the terms oscillating at the frequency ωS. As a result, Eq. (16.4.19) 
takes the form:

Further, we are interested in the case when the frequencies ωS and ωP satisfy the 
condition ωP - ωS ≃ ωv. For this reason, on the right-hand side in the ﬁrst 
parenthesis, we retain only the term whose denominator contains the expression 
ωP - ωS - ωv, i.e., the third term in the ﬁrst parenthesis. Moreover, in experiment, 
the amplitude of the pump wave is usually much larger than the amplitude of the 
Stokes wave, ΩP ≫ ΩS. Thus, on the right-hand side, in the second parenthesis, we 
retain only the terms proportional to |ΩP|2 ΩS. Taking into account that ωσ ≫ ωS, ωP 
and ωσ - ωS ≃ ωσ - ωP, we arrive at the following equation:
