Muscle Types 

•
The sliding filament mechanism, in which myosin 
filaments bind to and move actin filaments, is the 
basis for shortening of stimulated muscle. 
•
Myosin and actin interactions are regulated by 
calcium ions.   
•
Changes in the membrane potential lead to 
contraction; called E-C Coupling (excitation-
contraction coupling). 
Shared Principles 

Each muscle fiber has many myofibrils, whose 
number determines the force generating capability 
of the fiber.

Note that myofilament lengths have not 
changed! I band is reduced in 
contraction but not the A band.

Excitation-Contraction (E-C) Coupling

1. AP 
2. change in voltage causes the DHPR to open the ryanodine receptor 
3. Ca2+ from the SR enters the cytosol 
4. myosin can bind actin 
5. SR Ca2+-ATPase pumps Ca2+ back into the SR

Key Concepts 
All muscles are composed of two sets of overlapping 
protein filaments, actin and myosin, the relative sliding of 
which produces shortening and generates force. This 
process involves cross bridge formation between actin 
and myosin and uses ATP.   
   
Coupling between the membrane action potentials and 
contraction is mediated by calcium ions. Skeletal muscle 
has an actin-based (thin filament) control system. 
Relaxation occurs with the removal of Ca++.
