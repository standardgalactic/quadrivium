 Preface 
 I joined the BBC ﬁ lm department in 1963 just as they were opening their second channel and 
moving over from 35  mm black and white to 16  mm color. I left to go freelance 25 years later, 
by which time I had become one of the six Senior Film Cameramen at the BBC. At the time 
I resigned, the BBC was just introducing portable video kits for ﬁ lm cinematographers; these 
consisted of an analog camera with a separate U-Matic recorder. I have to confess that the 
introduction of this kit was a contributing factor to my decision to resign  – compared with the 
16  mm ﬁ lm cameras we were using at that time they were heavier, brought back the umbilical 
cord between the camera and the recorder, and, to my eyes, there was a huge drop in picture 
quality, not what I thought the BBC was all about. 
 I never did take to the analog cameras but, in the years since then, I have come to appreciate 
Digi Beta, a much more stable format. Until recently, however, I still preferred to shoot on 
ﬁ lm, particularly 35  mm. That decision has now changed. When HDCAM came into our 
world 8 years ago it was, to my mind, the ﬁ rst digital format that could truly challenge the 
ﬁ lm image. At the time of writing we now have many recording formats, some of them with 
no moving parts at all, and several cameras that have sensors that will comfortably exceed the 
original 1920  1080 pixel count. I am now very happy to shoot on some of the better High 
Deﬁ nition (HD) formats rather than ﬁ lm. 
 This third edition of HD cinematography is a substantial move forward from the previous 
two editions. I have deleted several chapters where their content seemed to me to now be 
common knowledge. I have added eight more cameras, including the RED One. There is now 
a comprehensive description of shooting three HD projects in the section Examples of Shoots. 
I have also dropped the old end chapter on Sony menus but, hopefully by the time this is 
published, that chapter will be on my website for those who still need it. If you do, please go

 About the Author 
 Paul Wheeler has a wealth of practical experience as both a Film and Digital 
Cinematographer combined with wide experience as a highly respected trainer. He is the 
author of Practical Cinematography , which is a standard work for those wishing to become 
Cinematographers in the traditional art of shooting ﬁ lm, and  Digital Cinematography , which 
primarily concentrates on the Digi Beta arena. After 25 years with the BBC, by the end 
of which he was one of only six Senior Film Cameramen out of a total of 63 Directors of 
Photography employed there at that time, he left to go freelance in order to concentrate on 
dramatic scripts rather than factual stories. 
 Since leaving the BBC, Paul has had a ﬂ ourishing career that has bought him many 
awards, including two Independent Producers Association (INDIE) awards for Digital 
Cinematography, two BAFTA nominations and a nomination from the Society of Lighting 
Directors plus numerous others. Check his website www.paulwheelerbsc.com . 
 Paul is equally at home shooting High Deﬁ nition (HD) or ﬁ lm. In 2008, just prior to writing 
this third edition, he shot King Lear starring Sir Ian McKellen, directed by Sir Trevor Nunn 
for the Performance Company, using four HD cameras. 
 In between shoots he has stood in as Head of Cinematography at the National Film and 
Television School in the UK several times and also as Head of Cinematography at the Royal 
College of Art, also in the UK. He is a regular visiting tutor at the London International 
Film School, the New York Film Academy in London and the Metropolitan Film School in 
London. He has designed and run the highly respected Digital Cinematography course at 
the National Short Course Training Programme, part of the National Film School, as well as 
taking Lighting Master Classes there both for Film and Digital Cinematography. He also runs 
a regular Advanced Lighting course for the Galway Film Centre in Ireland, as well as visiting 
several other European countries as a lecturer and trainer. 
 In December 2000 Paul was invited to join Panavision Europe as an associate of the company 
in order to help introduce the Panavision HD cameras to the European ﬁ lm and television 
community. He had the luck to join Panavision just 3 days before they got their ﬁ rst HD

camera so was in, by a whisker, just before the start! Paul spent about a third of his working 
life with Panavision over the next 3 years, ﬁ nally parting company with Panavision, most 
amicably, when Europe had become familiar with HD. 
 Paul is a member of the British Society of Cinematographers (BSC), a Fellow of the British 
Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society (FBKS) and a member of the Guild of British 
Camera Technicians (GBCT).

 Introduction
 High Deﬁ nition (HD) cinematography is a relatively new acquisition format which, I believe, 
is set to revolutionize much of the theatrical ﬁ lm world and, perhaps, even more, of television. 
It has been around now for little more than 8 years compared with ﬁ lm, which has been 
with us for considerably more than 100 years. In some areas it can compare; in some others, 
currently, it struggles to achieve any kind of dominance. Film, with its utterly superb image 
capture capabilities, is surely an anachronism in a television environment and with more and 
more digital effects appearing in feature ﬁ lms it is inevitable that, on occasion, there will 
be advantages in originating in the same image format as that which is to be used for the 
post-production.
 HD picture quality can arguably be every bit as good as 35   mm ﬁ lm in some ways, as I hope 
to prove in this book, yet the pre-cutting room costs will hopefully be lower than shooting 
16  mm ﬁ lm. Make no mistake about it, the drive to HD is ﬁ scal, so let us Cinematographers 
be thankful that the picture quality, the range of cameras and lenses, and their ease of use 
is nearly always to our advantage. It’s not just the saving in ﬁ lm stock and processing that 
is driving this engine. There is a huge value, especially to the distributors of feature ﬁ lms, 
to deliver the product to the screen without the cost of making and shipping release prints. 
Fortunately for Cinematographers there has been a contemporaneous advance in digital 
projection equipment and it is now possible to be very proud indeed of one’s work even if it 
has never left the digital domain. 
 I am a great believer that people from a visual world gain as much information from pictures 
as they might from words. Therefore I often produce the illustrations ﬁ rst and then write the 
text to them; in this book there are some 165 illustrations. 
 A top-of-the-range HD camera with the ﬁ nest lenses and recording either in the HDCAM 
format or one of the recently available equal or superior formats is now my camera of choice  –  
nearly always, not bad for a man whose grandfather joined the British Film Industry only 2 
years after the Lumi è re brothers showed the ﬁ rst on-ﬁ lm moving picture in Regent Street, 
London. Grandfather was late by the way  – his brother had joined 6 months earlier! 

xxii  Introduction
 The future is bright, very bright. If the work of future Directors of Photography can be 
recorded in some form of very high image quality, and it matters not on what recording 
format or what it is recorded on, we Cinematographers have a wonderful future to look 
forward to. Cinematography is a craft, and often an art form, which will be needed no matter 
what means science uses to record the Cinematographer’s work.

 Acknowledgements 
 My special thanks to: 
 Alan Piper for inviting me to become an associate of Panavision Europe a few days before 
they received their ﬁ rst High Deﬁ nition (HD) camera, a moment which now seems a long 
time ago, an invitation which subsequently led to the ﬁ rst edition of this book. My only regret 
here is that we have both moved on to more interesting things and therefore see a little less of 
each other. I also have to thank him for being my technical editor on this, the third edition. 
 Peter Swarbrick, Head of Digital Imaging, Panavision Europe for being wonderfully 
supportive and a great friend and colleague who took the trouble to start teaching a ﬁ lm man 
a thing or two about HD and for giving me some great quotes. 
 Alan Roberts for his amazing patience in teaching me how digital cameras and television 
really work. 
 The camera suppliers and hirers, who were unstinting in their help whilst always knowing I 
would criticize as well as praise: 
 From  Sony , Peter Sykes, Nigel Thomson and Awad Mousa for getting me access to, and 
permission to use the pictures of, the Sony HDW F900R and much more. 
 From  Arriﬂ ex , Bill Lovell for giving me the time to explore the Arriﬂ ex D-21 and 
permission to use the pictures of it, including the cover picture, together with a great deal 
of wise counsel and encouragement. 
 From  Dalsa , John Coghill for not only making sure I had my facts on the Origin correct, 
but also for permission to use the pictures of the camera. 
 Thank you to Sam Martin of Decode for my initial introduction to the RED One. 
 To Barry Basset of VMI for giving me access to several of the cameras, including the RED 
One.

xxiv  Acknowledgements
 And to all the other equipment manufacturers and suppliers who have given me so much of 
their time with the absolute understanding that I would write up my own opinions. I think it a 
great tribute to our industry that not a single one of them was less than enthusiastic for me to 
explore their product. What a wonderful industry we work in. 
 For allowing me access to their projection booths and cinemas and giving me a huge amount 
of information on HD presentation, I have to thank Mark Nice at the Odeon Leicester Square, 
Keith Fawcet at BAFTA, and John Houchin and Brian Naylor at The National Film and 
Television School. 
 My thanks to Mike Coleman and Chris Atkins of Stage 2 Screen for permission to use the 
pictures from Birthdays . 
 Thank you to Jane McGee and Christopher Billows for asking me to shoot  The Optician and 
supplying the pictures from the master tape and giving me permission to use them here. 
 A special thank you to my old associates Richard Price and Chris Hunt from the Performance 
Company for asking me to shoot yet another wonderful production, this time  King Lear , and 
giving me free access to use whatever I wanted from that production in this book. 
And most importantly my wife Anne for her encouragement, her support and her patience 
with reading my drafts .

 High Deﬁ nition: A Quick Overview

CHAPTER 1 
 Why Shoot on HD? 
 If you want to make quality ﬁ lms, whether for the big screen or for television, then you 
should always consider High Deﬁ nition (HD) as a serious option. 
 If you are used to shooting on 16  mm ﬁ lm or Digi Beta then you will see a considerable 
increase in picture quality. 
 If you are used to shooting on 35  mm ﬁ lm you should, with the right approach and the right 
technicians, see no loss in image quality. Indeed, in certain circumstances, you may see an 
improvement. 
 Again, if you are used to shooting on 35   mm, you should see a substantial drop in the cost of 
your recording medium. 
 That’s it! Enough said! 
 1.1   What Do We Mean by High Deﬁ nition (HD)? 
 High Deﬁ nition is an electronic recording medium that takes on two challenges. First 
it should be able, either in a purely digital way or by printing the recorded images onto 
a conventional piece of ﬁ lm, to give the audience in a cinema, even the largest cinema, 
pictures with which they are familiar and that appear to have at least the technical quality, 
mainly assessed as deﬁ nition, that they have come to expect. If it does not, or cannot, then 
the audience will not bother to go to buy a ticket. Secondly, in the television arena, the 
requirement is to provide economical recording formats that give stunning picture quality 
on any of the new television HD transmission formats and their associated widescreen 
televisions, otherwise no one will buy the new TVs. 
 My belief is that, handled with care and knowledge, all the above is easily achievable. 
 1.1.1  The Knowledge Base 
 Originally many people moving into HD hoped it would look like ﬁ lm. This is not difﬁ cult 
to achieve. We have been shooting ﬁ lm, and admiring the results, for well over a hundred 
years; by now we ought to know how we have been doing this. Forgive me if you ﬁ nd this a 

4  Chapter 1
sacrilege, but the process of recording moving images on ﬁ lm is far from perfect. It is very 
good and, until around the year 2000, was the only medium that could successfully suspend 
our disbelief in a large cinema. Then HD arrived. Initially almost everybody wanted HD to 
emulate the ﬁ lm look and I was lucky enough to be, almost from the start, one of those people 
advising them how to achieve this. My ﬁ rst advice then, as it is now, was to hire a ﬁ lm-trained 
Director of Photography (DP), for with that person comes around ﬁ ve generations of handed-
on knowledge and experience. Someone trained in ﬁ lm will always be able to give you those 
kinds of image, it’s in their blood, and they can hardly help it. 
 Now, some 8 years on, we are beginning to see a new kind of image maker  – one who is 
prepared to take on the images that only HD can produce. Some of these DPs come from a 
ﬁ lm background, some from television and some are so young they are ﬁ nding their own way 
in this new and exciting medium. More power to their elbow, I say! 
 1.1.2   What Does It Mean to the Producer  – Saving Money! 
 If you work in my world, or wish to, you have to accept that it is driven by a four-letter 
word  – cash! This may not necessarily be a disadvantage, particularly if the work you have 
previously been known for has been recorded on ﬁ lm. But don’t take that as a raw statement, 
it gets better. 
 If you are thinking of moving from ﬁ lm to HD then savings in the budget are obviously 
going to be an inﬂ uencing factor, but more can be made of the changes than just reducing the 
bottom line. For example, a little of those savings can be spent on production values, thus 
upping the perceived quality of the product. The extraordinary international compatibility 
of HD should assist the producers in making money, as HD is both an origination and 
post-production medium. When the ﬁ lm is completed it can be output in almost any delivery 
format (cinema), any Worldwide Television format (the Net), even digital phones, and all this 
with an incomparable asset  – no loss in quality. 
 1.1.3  What Does It Mean to the Director? 
 Conﬁ dence. With modern HD monitoring, the Director is seeing rushes (dailies) on set and in 
real time. Large-screen monitors can give a Director a real sense of how the picture is going 
to look in its ﬁ nal venue. 
 A closer working relationship with the DP, something I was nervous of when I ﬁ rst started 
using HD but have come to love. A good director does not want to be a DP, if for no other 
reason than they are, or should be, too busy with all the other problems, primarily their actors. 
A decent monitor is a wonderful communication tool. 

Why Shoot on HD?   5
 1.1.4  What Does It Mean for the Director of Photography? 
 First, for me, it means I have a new and exciting toy to play with. I admit to liking toys. 
 Secondly, because of the cost savings involved, I may get to shoot more movies because more 
producers will be able to afford to get their production off the ground. 
 Thirdly, when shooting for television, I will be able, at a very small increase in cost, to deliver 
a signiﬁ cantly higher picture quality. 
 Fourthly, if the producer is sensible, and it is our job to convince them, I will be able to work 
with my normal ﬁ lm crew who, with only the slightest of training, can become HD experts 
almost immediately. 
 And last, perhaps, by embracing this new, excellent and exciting recording medium and its 
cameras, I can become more popular with productions and therefore busier. 
 1.1.5  What Does It Mean to the Other Crafts? 
 Very little. If they are good enough to work on 35  mm ﬁ lm then they are deﬁ nitely good 
enough to work on HD. Most of the heads of departments I have worked with in high-end 
television would have little or no problem working on HD. For instance, I have held Make-up 
workshops for HD and it just isn’t a problem. If the Make-up Supervisor and the DP work 
closely together, as in my experience they always do, then those worrying lace caps on a 
wig, the prosthetic nose job and all the rest present the same problems and require the same 
solutions. No problem! 
 1.1.6  Editing and Post-Production 
 Herein lies a very slight rub, and if there is a problem it should not necessarily be laid at 
the door of the DP or the post-production house. In my experience problems in this area, 
which are mercifully rare, nearly always follow inadequate planning, and incorrect decisions 
being made during the pre-production run up to principal photography. If post is going to go 
smoothly then you have to get the prep right. Because HD is still relatively new, it is prudent 
to bring together the Producer or Production Manager, the Director, the DP, the picture 
editor and all the post-production personnel, including Visual Effects (real-time effects) and 
the Post-Production Effect Supervisor for a signiﬁ cant meeting, or several meetings, before 
principal photography starts. They should not leave the room until agreement has been found 
and notes should be taken. I always do! 
 All of the above must be taken even more seriously now that we have cameras coming 
on stream that do not record a fully processed image, the data from the camera therefore 

6  Chapter 1
requiring some manipulation before a fully formed image is ready for conventional post-
production. The RAW data coming from a RED camera comes to mind, but provided this and 
other cameras using RAW data are treated with respect and the additional post-production 
layer is fully understood, this way of working can render very good pictures indeed  – in the 
right hands, of course. 
 1.2  Context 
 When I came to lay out this book for the third time, I realized that there was no  “ right ” or 
 “ wrong ” approach. Wherever I started I would have to refer to topics to be explained later, so 
should I discuss the technology ﬁ rst, or should I consider HD from a Producer’s perspective? 
 I decided to start with production decisions for two reasons. First, I believe that until we 
are all more familiar with the HD workﬂ ow, reaching correct production decisions will be 
an essential prerequisite to success. Secondly, if the sales and cost advantages of using HD 
are not understood then there is little point in worrying about the technology anyway, as no 
one will be using it. Getting bums on seats at a reasonable cost is the name of the game, and 
always has been. Nothing new there!

 Production Decisions

CHAPTER 2 
 Which Formats to Shoot On? 
 The problem, as I see it, is that there are a bewildering number of decisions to be made and 
they  must be made before you start shooting or there is a very strong probability you will 
inherit some terrible problems when you get into post-production. 
 Things have changed since the introduction of HDCAM in the year 2000. Prior to that the 
choices were very simple  – if you were going to shoot on ﬁ lm there was really only a choice 
between two formats, were you going to shoot on 35  mm or 16  mm? All the other decisions 
for many of the heads of departments (HODs) on the production would fall into line quite 
simply once that decision was announced. If you were shooting on Digi Beta were you 
working in an NTSC environment or a PAL environment? Again a simple and easy choice. 
 In an effort to be all things to all people, High Deﬁ nition (HD) has many, many options to 
offer. This is good but it can be bewildering. It can look frighteningly daunting but, truly, it 
need not be. There are eight, yes eight, different frame rates to choose from. However, as you 
will see, the decision is likely to come down to a simple choice between only two or three 
frame rates, the same number of choices we had in the old days  – so how difﬁ cult is that? 
 2.1   Progressive or Interlace? 
 There is the thorny question of whether to shoot in Progressive scan or interlace. Again 
I do hope this book will help with that decision but, usually, choosing between theatrical 
production and factual, cinema or television and asking yourself what the audience is 
accustomed to will bring the answers naturally to hand. 
 2.2   How Many Pixels Do You Need? 
 How many pixels should I shoot with? The answer is simple: as many as you can afford. The 
middle ground is still HDCAM with its true 1920    1080 pixel array recording on HDCAM 
1/2-inch tape. It works don’t knock it. Handled wisely it can easily please an audience in the 
largest of cinemas. It can hardly fail to make television look better than standard deﬁ nition 
pictures be they recorded on Digi Beta or 16  mm ﬁ lm. Again, handled well, they should look 

10  Chapter 2
as good as 35  mm ﬁ lm when shown on standard deﬁ nition television, which I believe are just 
about the best pictures we are used to seeing. It’s called the quality headroom getting through. 
 2.3   Recording Formats 
 What recording format to use? Difﬁ cult, but almost certainly the decision will be budget 
driven. As I said earlier, use the best you can afford. HDCAM is still the frontrunner for 
most productions, but if you have a really good budget there are hard drives to record on and 
cameras that originate their pictures at a much higher resolution than HDCAM, although they 
can be very expensive. One danger in going to higher formats is the amount of data you will 
need to record on set and the associated data delivered into post-production. 
 2.4   HDV  – Can You Get Away With It? 
 No, but although I have chosen not to discuss HDV anywhere else in this book, preferring to 
stay with more professional formats, I have to admit a sneaking admiration for HDV. At the 
price it must be close to a miracle. But few, if any, HDV cameras actually have 1920    1080 
pixels on their chips and the recording format  – that is, the tape width or the disk or chip 
size  –  is so small that few, if any, can record a genuine HD picture. Much more worrying is 
the various types of compression schemes used. Many adopt the MPEG-2 recording format, 
where one complete frame is recorded and the next 12 images are not complete images at all, 
for what is recorded on the tape is only the difference in that frame from the ﬁ rst one  – ﬁ ne 
if not much moves in your picture or you don’t wish to pan the camera very quickly. If your 
pictures contain either of these occurrences then the images will start to contain less and 
less information as the camera’s processor fails to keep up with the data being sent to it. A 
great system, but not really up to professional cinematography. While MPEG-2 drops into an 
amateur’s laptop reasonably easily, it is not a robust recording format and can give considerable 
problems later in post-production, particularly if you are going to try anything fancy. It’s very 
cheap, though, so if this is the only way you can get your picture shot  – go for it! 
 Hopefully, this book will make all of the above decisions very much easier. 

11
CHAPTER 3 
 Picture Quality 
 3.1   What Does HD Look Like? 
 Before I go any further I must admit to a bias, with my Director of Photography (DP) hat 
ﬁ rmly in place: I just love the images created by a High Deﬁ nition (HD) camera, particularly 
when that camera is fronted with a decent lens. Please remember I am third-generation 
ﬁ lm industry  – if I ﬁ nd HD appealing it must, surely, be worth your while giving it your 
consideration.
 The images are usually very sharp with a long tonal range and the colors are lifelike and true. 
Whether seen on a monitor or digitally projected there is no dirt on the picture, no scratching 
and no picture instability such as weave or unsteadiness. Some fans of the photomechanical 
image miss these aberrations, but with my training having been in the BBC in London they 
were always artifacts we were trying to eliminate so, perhaps, this is why I welcome their 
elimination. If the ﬁ nal product is to be shown from a ﬁ lm print then all the possibilities of 
print imperfections return, of course, and if you like them have a ﬁ lm print and you may be 
very happy, especially if you have your HD image printed out onto camera negative ﬁ lm 
rather than an intermediate stock. Printing out to camera negative stock can give an even 
greater impression that the images were originated on ﬁ lm. 
 To be starting with such a high technical standard is a joy for a DP like me, for if one feels the 
image too sharp, diffusion ﬁ lters allow you to reduce it to any degree or look you wish for. 
If the colors are too bright for the script you are working on, then with ﬁ lters or by adjusting 
the in-camera menus this is easily attenuated. And the result of your adjustments is easily 
assessed on a monitor in real time. Especially when using a 24-inch HD monitor, what you 
see is what you get; or, to use a favorite phrase of mine, if it looks right  – it is right. 
 If you come from a ﬁ lm background, as I do, then the easiest way to envisage the HD image 
is to think of the picture you would get shooting on 35  mm Kodak 320 ASA extended range 
Vision stock and printing to their Premier release print stock. The quality of lenses you 
deploy will change the image every bit as much as it will on a ﬁ lm camera and again I must 
admit to a bias; to my eyes and my style of shooting the Panavision and Zeiss ranges of zoom 
and prime lenses are unbeatable. For cinema productions I try to use no others. For television 

12  Chapter 3
I may relax my opinion slightly as the ﬁ nite potential of the absolute resolution of the 
delivery medium is, inevitably, lower even if being transmitted in an HD format. 
 3.2   HD Images Compared with 35  mm 
 The most notable thing if you are watching HD projected using a state-of-the-art HD 
projector is the almost total lack of grain. Some people miss this effect dreadfully. If you 
really cannot cope with such a clean image then you can add grain, or what I like to think of 
as texture, in post. It is also possible to add texture in the camera: simply shoot with some 
gain switched in. I have very successfully shot HD with 6   dB of gain switched in and the 
resultant image has been much admired. If you are going to ﬁ lm for ﬁ nal delivery then it 
would be a wise precaution to print a short test, for the effect of gain is more noticeable on 
the big screen than on a monitor. 
 3.3   Anamorphic 35  mm 
 To shoot HD in the anamorphic 2.4:1 aspect ratio you simply switch the viewﬁ nder marking 
to show a bright line box in that aspect ratio and compose to it; most HD cameras can do this. 
The image will remain unsqueezed right up to the point in post-production where you make 
the ﬁ rst ﬁ lm image. At that point the printer will horizontally compress the 2.4:1 section 
of the image to produce a conventional anamorphic photographic image. This technique 
has been proved many times to work very well with cameras utilizing a 2/3-inch three-chip 
conﬁ guration; with the latest single-chip cameras the result is simply stunning. If you are 
projecting the result with a digital projector then a simple switch is all that needs to be set to 
show the image in the 2.4:1 ratio. 
 As the majority of cameras, especially those using three 2/3-inch chips, record in a 16     9 
aspect ratio where the image is comprised of 1080 vertical pixels, the center section used 
for anamorphic imaging will comprise just a little over 800 pixels vertically. There are those 
steeped in the ﬁ lm tradition who would like to deny the evidence of their eyes and say this 
cannot possibly produce a sharp enough image. I put it to you they are wrong and believe I 
can prove it. Before I do, remember that more and more of the newer single-chip cameras 
have more pixels than the 2.1 million per chip of the 2/3-inch cameras and they interpolate 
down to 1920    1080, thus further improving apparent image quality. 
 There are now a number of cameras utilizing a single chip the size, or near to the size, of 
a Super 35  mm frame and these can shoot with spherical lenses in exactly the same way as 
you would with 35  mm ﬁ lm. If you do this then you can go down the same post-production 
route as you would when extracting a 2.4:1 master on Super 35 for later anamorphing to a 

Picture Quality  13
conventional squeezed 35   mm print. Or just leave it as HD and tell a digital projector to show 
it as 2.4:1. 
 The ﬁ nite judgement of sharpness in the cinema is made by the human eye. The resolution 
of the human eye is well known and discussed elsewhere in this book, so if the picture on the 
cinema screen is sharper than the human eye can perceive then the brain will tell the viewer 
that the picture is sharp. In most cinemas 800     1920 pixels produce an image which more 
than meets this requirement; hence we perceive it as sharp, as anyone who has seen some of 
the latest features shot on HD will testify, for this is most likely how they were made. 
 A counter-argument goes that 35  mm ﬁ lm must be sharper because the image has a resolution 
which is referred to as a 4  K resolution, meaning 4000 horizontal pixels or samples, whereas 
HD only has a fraction under 2  K of resolution. This is true, but as described in Chapter 10, 
the 4  K ﬁ lm negative has to be photographically copied several times before being projected 
onto the screen. At every stage quality will suffer. It can be shown that the image on the 
cinema screen is unlikely to be better than 1.2  K. 
 The HD image, on the other hand, while starting at a little under 2  K resolution is transferred 
digitally  – that is, just re-recording zeros and ones  – so there is no loss of quality at any 
transfer point. Hence if the production has stayed within the HD domain the resolution being 
projected is the full 2  K  – 1.92  K if you want to be exceedingly picky  – image originally 
formed by the camera, arguably higher than can be achieved by the photochemical process. 
 There are more technical explanations of these matters in Part 3  – The Technology. 
 3.4   Comparisons with Super 16   mm 
 Most of the 2/3-inch chip cameras described in this book produce an image that bears direct 
comparison with conventional theatrical 35  mm image quality, as we have seen. All of the 
single-chip cameras described are capable of even greater quality. 
 There are HD cameras that are marketed speciﬁ cally at high-end television. For instance, 
Sony make the HDW 700 range that have imaging chips with 1080     1920 pixels, which 
I would consider true HD, and these cameras use a 10- or even 12-bit processor. They are 
market speciﬁ c in that there is a PAL standard version that will only record in the 25P or 50i 
format and NTSC versions recording in 28.98P, 59.97i and 60i. They can, however, be set 
up to give both a High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) output, as well as a PAL 
in the European, or NTSC in the US, version. The HDW 750P can give a quality of image, 
when shown on television, which will still compare with 35   mm but the differences may 
become apparent when shown on a big screen in a cinema. To date there is no 24P version 
of the HDW 750 so direct frame rate compatibility with cinema is impossible. Compatibility 

14  Chapter 3
is possible, however, with the newer Sony HDW 900R. Theses cameras are discussed 
individually, and more fully, in Part 6  – Cameras. 
 3.5   Comparison with Digi Beta 
 Frankly there is no contest. In my opinion all true HD cameras produce a better picture than 
a Digi Beta camera. Digi Beta cameras are considerably cheaper to either rent or buy so they 
will be around for use in television a while yet but, I like to think, not for all that long. 

15
CHAPTER 4 
 Display Quality 
 4.1   HD Shown on Television 
 There are some who say there is no point in shooting High Deﬁ nition (HD) when the ﬁ nished 
product is only ever going to be shown on current television  – I disagree. Just as a ﬁ lm 
originated on 35  mm ﬁ lm looks better on either PAL or NTSC than one originated on 16   mm 
or Digi Beta, the same is true for HD, as it is a picture of very similar quality to 35   mm. This 
is known as retaining the quality headroom. As HDCAM tape recorded in the 24P format 
was always intended to be the international exchange format we can, hopefully, expect a 
gradual increase in picture quality for prestige programming. It is possible to play a 24P 
HDCAM tape out of, say, a Sony HDW F500 video tape recorder (VTR) or similar, where the 
output is already converted to the PAL or NTSC formats. Even using this simplistic down-
conversion the headroom is retained and clearly visible. I was present when a Sony HDW 900 
was demonstrated to one of the more sceptical line producers I frequently work with. To my 
delight he rapidly became a fan of the system but right at the end of the demonstration asked 
if it were possible to see a full HD resolution monitor next to a standard PAL monitor with 
the picture down-converted via the HDW F500. As luck would have it there was just such a 
capability set up in another room for an entirely different purpose. We ran a single tape, the 
contents of which he had by now seen as a played-out HD image on a 24-inch HD monitor 
as well as the same ﬁ lm written to both 1:1.85 format and 1:2.4 format projected ﬁ lm. After 
staring at two 14-inch monitors right next to each other, one a full HD monitor fed from the 
High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) socket on the HDW F500 and the other a 
high-resolution PAL 625-line monitor fed from the PAL down-converted output on the same 
VTR, his reaction after seeing every frame was  “ well the PAL looks just like 35  mm with 
lines! ” I rest my case. 
 4.2   HD Written to Film and Projected Mechanically 
 If the transfer from HD tape to ﬁ lm is carried out with sufﬁ cient precision, and bear in mind 
the quality of image produced by different companies can vary tremendously, then to all 
intents and purposes the resultant print will be very similar indeed to the same image had it 
been acquired on 35   mm negative. There are those who will tell you different but I have met 

16  Chapter 4
few who doubt the quality of HD when they have seen well-shot demonstration reels available 
at several of the top-end suppliers. 
 4.3   HD Shown on a State-of-the-art Digital Projector 
 The quality of image on a cinema screen from a high-end digital projector showing an 
image that has never been anything but HD is simply stunning. It looks a little less like ﬁ lm 
origination than HD written back to ﬁ lm, so arguments will go on for years yet as to whether 
that difference is an improvement or a degradation of the cinema picture quality we have 
come to expect. I come down ﬁ rmly in the  “ it’s better ” camp. Maybe that is my training in 
the BBC as a Director of Photography, for I have simply been going in that direction all my 
working life, but I love the fact that it is very sharp, there is no dirt and dust, no picture weave 
and far less ﬂ icker. All good things to my way of thinking. 
 I have heard one explanation that purports that the blanking time of a mechanical shutter is 
preferable, for it lets our brain rest between the showing of each frame of image. My reply is 
to ask  – if I blink 24 times a second will I feel less tired? Of course not. What nonsense this 
idea must be! If it were so I am conﬁ dent God would have given me that facility. Here’s to 
ﬂ icker-free projection, I say. 
 4.4   Digital Projectors 
 Unlike a 35  mm mechanical projector, which is roughly the same size and cost no matter what 
the size of the cinema, digital projectors come in many shapes and sizes  – and costs. You can 
see a variety of them in Chapter 5 and, believe me, all those shown give a wonderful picture. 
Digital projection in the cinema is here and is here to stay. 

17
CHAPTER 5 
 High Deﬁ nition Projection 
 5.1   Introduction 
 When I published my ﬁ rst book on High Deﬁ nition (HD) in 2003, HD projection was a 
bit of a Cinderella at the ball. There had just come onstream some truly HD projectors but 
they were viewed with suspicion by those involved in acquiring the pictures whether via 
HD or ﬁ lm, especially by those using ﬁ lm. There were also problems arising from a lack of 
knowledge, understanding or availability of usable equipment.  How things have changed!
 Encoding a movie onto a hard drive and delivering this to the cinema is now so common that 
one of the premier screens in the UK, the Odeon Leicester Square, estimates that 75 percent 
of their screen time is now delivered this way and shown on their 2   K digital projector. While 
there are those that think we should be looking for greater than 2   K resolution in the theater 
I cannot agree. If you refer to Chapter 10, you will see my argument that 2  K horizontal 
resolution is a little more than a human eye can resolve in a cinema and considerably more 
than a 35  mm ﬁ lm release print is likely to deliver. Therefore a good 2   K projector fed with a 
high-quality and pure 2  K signal will deliver a picture that should be slightly better than any 
of the audience are capable of perceiving  – if these parameters are met then that image has to 
be more than good enough. 
 Matters pertaining to projection were in such a state of ﬂ ux when I published the second 
edition of this book early in 2007 that I decided not to update the chapter on projection and 
I have been criticized for this, perhaps rightly. I have decided with this third edition to take a 
new approach. Digital projection is now so common, so well understood and, when carried 
out by technicians who know their craft, delivers such superb pictures that just going into the 
technicalities seemed superﬂ uous. 
 As this book is likely to be read by more people involved in the acquisition of pictures than 
in other areas of our business, I decided that, hopefully, it would be interesting for them to 
describe presentation venues where the equipment and resultant image quality were of the 
highest standard. It has to be said that the welcome I got from those running these venues was 
superb and the cooperation enormous. 

18  Chapter 5
 Come on all you people who think that shooting and editing a ﬁ lm is the be all and end all of 
cinema  – our work will look rubbish if those who show our pictures do not try to attain the 
highest standards. So next time you go to the cinema, or rushes (dailies), or see your work 
looking good on television, go up to the projection box and say thank you, or ring the station 
and ask for the duty manager and ask them to tell the telecine or image quality staff how 
delighted you were. It’s in your interest, after all. 
 Please remember a phrase my father drummed into me, especially when I got my ﬁ rst job 
at the BBC, as a trainee projectionist:  “ Here’s a thought for your reﬂ ection, a show like this 
needs good projection! ”
 5.2   Examples of Venues 
 5.2.1  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) 
 5.2.1.1  The venue 
 The two cinemas at BAFTA are arguably the ﬁ nest private viewing facilities in London. 
They are mainly used for screening current feature ﬁ lms for BAFTA members, but can also 
be used by the members in order to showcase their work and can be hired for industry and 
corporate events. There are two cinemas: the smaller, the Run Run Shaw Theater; and the 
main auditorium, the Princess Anne Theater ( Figure 5.1 , picture 1), with the BAFTA logo on 
the screen, this being the BAFTA mask designed by Mitzi Cunliffe. 
 The Princess Anne Theater can seat 227 and has a screen size of 33.3     14.5 feet 
(approximately 10.2     4.39 meters). The projection box contains two Cinemechanica 35/70   mm 
projectors and one digital projector ( Figure 5.1 , picture 3). The Run Run Shaw Theater has just 
one slightly smaller, but nevertheless 2  K, digital projector ( Figure 5.1 , picture 5). 
 5.2.1.2  The digital projectors 
 The Princess Anne Theater utilizes a Barco (Belgium American Radio Corporation) DP 
100 projector with a 6-kilowatt lamp ( Figure 5.1 , picture 6). The Barco DP 100 utilizes 
three 1.2-inch dark metal type Texas Instruments DLP Cinema ™ technology chips, each 
having a native resolution of 2048    1080 pixels. This projector also has a ﬁ lter set allowing 
polarizing ﬁ lters to be used, thus enabling BAFTA to show truly superb 3D or stereoscopic 
movies. The ﬁ lter set is controlled by the Dolby DFC Filter Controller, which is the third 
installation in the processor rack shown in  Figure 5.1 (picture 7). 
 In the Run Run Shaw Theater there is a Barco DP 1500 projector ( Figure 5.1 , picture 5), 
which uses three Texas Instruments DC2K 0.98-inch dark metal reﬂ ectors, each with a native 
resolution of 2048    1080 pixels.

20  Chapter 5
 5.2.1.3  Digital handling 
  Both the Run Run Shaw and the Princess Anne Theaters can be served from the 
comprehensive digital handling rack ( Figure 5.1 , picture 7). This contains a Dolby DSS 
100 Show Store server with a storage capacity of 1 terabyte, which is enough to hold 
approximately six feature ﬁ lms. Below that on the rack is the Dolby DPS 100 Show Player 
with full 3D capability. Again, going down the rack we come to the Dolby DMA8 Plus 
Digital Media Adapter and below that the Dolby DFC 100 Filter Controller, again with full 
3D capabilities. As if this is not enough there is a Sony HDW 1800 HDCAM tape player 
( Figure 5.1 , picture 2) and BAFTA often hire in a Sony HDCAM-SR player when required. 
 Figure 5.1 (picture 4) shows Keith Fawcett, BAFTA’s Head of Technical Services, setting up 
the Dolby Show Player for the afternoon performance. 
 5.2.1.4  What does it all get used for? 
 Most evenings there are ﬁ lms on display in the Princess Anne Theater to which members 
are invited with a guest. Both theaters can be booked by members for their own use and I 
have been lucky enough to have had several of my own ﬁ lms shown here, so can attest to the 
extraordinarily high quality of the image on the screen in both theaters. 
 Both theaters, together with the vast David Lean room on the ﬂ oor below, are available for 
corporate hire. 
 5.2.2  The National Film and Television School (NFTS) 
 5.2.2.1   The venues 
 The NFTS has two cinemas. The new one, in a newly built teaching block ( Figure 5.2 , 
picture 1), has 151 seats with a screen 7 meters wide (approximately 23 feet) and is served 
by a Christie CP2000-X projector. 
 The second, and original cinema ( Figure 5.2 , picture 6), has 59 seats and is served by a 
Christie SL1-D projector. 
 5.2.2.2  The projectors 
 The Christie CP2000-X projector in the main cinema ( Figure 5.2 , pictures 2 and 3) utilizes 
Texas Instruments DLP technology just like the Barco projectors in the other two venues 
in this chapter and like them uses three chips. This projector has a native resolution of 
2048    1080 pixels, claims a 200:1 contrast ratio and employs 15-bit image processing. The 
projector currently uses a 2   kW lamp and produces a very ﬁ ne image. 
 The Christie SL1-D ( Figure 5.2 , pictures 7 and 8), though being of a slightly older design 
than the CP2000-X, has the same native resolution and again deploys a 2   kW lamp.

 There is also a Provost 35  mm projector in this box, with reel-to-reel or  “ cake stand ” ﬁ lm 
handling ( Figure 5.2 , picture 5). 
 5.2.2.3  Digital handling 
 In the main cinema a Kodak Content Player JMN3000 is used ( Figure 5.2 , picture 4). This 
player is a multiformat device, being able to handle various compression formats including 
MPEG- or JPEG-compressed data for 2D features, or 3D-compressed MPEG images. 
 In the other cinema a Sony JH-3 HDCAM tape player ( Figure 5.2 , picture 9) is permanently 
available as HDCAM tapes are the most common HD format used by the students. Other 
image recording formats can be brought into this cinema as needed. 
 5.2.2.4  What do they get used for? 
 The old theater is now the primary venue for students to show their work in progress, etc. The 
main cinema is ideal for the presentation of ﬁ nished work, and the viewing of interesting or 
well-known feature ﬁ lms and major television programs. It is also a venue for industry events 
showcasing students ’ work. 
 5.2.3  The Odeon Leicester Square, London 
 5.2.3.1  The venue 
 The Odeon Leicester Square can claim to be one of very few  “ Premier ” screens in the UK. It 
has a screen size of 52 feet wide by 26 feet high (approximately 15.85     12.48 meters). The 
main theater has 1683 seats with additional space for four wheelchairs. 
 The exterior is unusual ( Figure 5.3 , picture 1). The entire front of the theater is clad in black 
marble, which, while looking somber during the day, lends a special quality to the appearance 
of the building at night: the fa ç ade seems to disappear and the signage and posters seem to 
ﬂ oat in space  – all very theatrical, as perhaps it should be. 
 The projection box contains two 35  mm mechanical projectors plus a high-quality digital 
projector, as we shall see. 
 5.2.3.2  The digital projector 
 The digital projector is a Barco (Belgian American Radio Corporation) DP 100 projector, 
as shown in close-up in  Figure 5.3 (picture 6). As a guide to the size of the projector,  Figure 
5.3 (picture 3) shows Mark Nice, the Odeon’s Technical Manager, readying the projector for 
the day’s work. The Barco DP 100 utilizes three 1.2-inch dark metal-type Texas Instruments 
DLP Cinema ™ technology chips, each having a native resolution of 2048     1080 pixels. 
This, together with a xenon lamp of 7  kW, gives 18,000 cinema lumens output and provides a 
contrast ratio of 2000:1 and an astonishingly good picture on the huge screen.

 5.2.3.3  Digital handling 
 The digital information is stored in a Dolby DSS 100 server capable of holding up to ﬁ ve 
feature ﬁ lms, as you can see in  Figure 5.3 (picture 2). Each of these ﬁ lms usually arrives at 
the venue stored in an encrypted form on a single hard drive, one of which can be seen in its 
carrying case in  Figure 5.3 (picture 5). Behind the case can be seen the old ﬁ lm storage bins; 
each vertical compartment would contain a 2000-foot roll of 35   mm ﬁ lm, which would have a 
screen time of 20 minutes. How things have changed! The cinema has an alternative source in 
a Doreme DCP 2000 unit ( Figure 5.3 , picture 4). 
 Once the data on the hard drive have been loaded into the server a separate  “ key ” is sent to 
the cinema. This electronic key enables the cinema to understand the encryption of the data 
and run them as a picture source for the projector. This element of the process is essential to 
protect the ﬁ lm from piracy. 
 5.2.3.4  What does it all get used for? 
 The Odeon estimates that over 75 percent of the screen time in this theater is now provided by 
the Barco digital projector; 35  mm ﬁ lm prints will only usually be used when a director such 
as Steven Spielberg insists that his work be displayed this way. 
 Digital cinema projection appears to be here to stay. 
 5.3   How HD Cinema Projectors Work 
 There are many kinds of digital projector but most of the projectors designed for use in full-size 
cinemas, and indeed all described in this chapter, utilize the Texas Instruments DLP Cinema ™ 
Technology chip. This chip is a quite extraordinary device for, despite being only 1 1/2 inches in 
size, it contains 2,211,840 pixels in an array of 2048 pixels horizontally by 1080 vertically. This 
means that each pixel has a width of less than one-ﬁ fth of the thickness of a human hair. Even 
more extraordinary, each pixel is made up of a small mirror mounted on a hinge and in addition 
there is an actuating device that, when a signal is received by the pixel, causes the mirror to tilt 
across its diagonal.  Figure 5.4 represents a small portion of the chip’s mirror ﬁ eld. 
 The DLP Cinema chip uses standard digital philosophy that relies on breaking up the image 
into very small segments, known as pixels, and distributing these tiny bits of information 
accurately to any piece of equipment further down the production route. With these projectors 
the ambition is to display from each and every mirror the exact same brightness and color 
that was originally seen by a pixel in the same position in the pixel array in the camera or 
ﬁ lm scanning device that generated the original digital recording. Thankfully the projectors 
described here do this with extraordinary accuracy, thus maintaining the highest picture 
quality on the screen. 

High Deﬁ nition Projection  25
 The bit-stream image code entering the complete semiconductor causes each individual 
mirror to either stay stationary or move to its second position up to several thousand times a 
second. If you look at Figure 5.5 you can see how matters are arranged. With no activation 
the light from a lamp and condenser lens is directed away from the projector lens and on to 
some light-absorbing device. As each projector manufacturer uses a different light absorber, I 
have chosen to call this device a  “ black hole ” . 
 In order to simplify the explanation I have only shown light from the source hitting a single 
mirror, whereas in reality the light source would cover all the mirrors on the chip. So, in 
 Figure 5.6 , one mirror has been activated and has moved to its second position, where the

26  Chapter 5
light is now directed out through the projector lens. If this were all that happened, all that 
would be seen on the screen for this single pixel would be the option of black, no activation, 
or bright white, all the light going to the screen. Here is where the chip’s ability to shift that 
mirror up to several thousand times a second comes into play. If the mirror ﬂ icks light many 
times a second to the cinema screen, then a bright highlight will be observed by the audience. 
On the other hand, if that mirror only ﬂ icks light a relatively few times in the same time 
period then a dark gray will be perceived by the audience. The variety of times each mirror 
can ﬂ ick light to the screen is so variable that it is possible to convince the audience that they 
are seeing a range of 1024 different shades of gray. 
 5.4   Adding Color 
 5.4.1  Single-chip Projectors 
 In smaller venues it is economical to have a single DLP chip operating as described above 
with the addition of a spinning ﬁ lter wheel interposed between the chip and the lens. This 
wheel may have only three colors  – Red, Blue and Green  – or more, in which case they 
will most likely add Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. In a projector using this conﬁ guration it is 
necessary to synchronize the ﬁ lters on the wheel with the image being sent to the DLP chip, 
so that at all times the correct color signal being reﬂ ected by the chip is the same as the color 
of the ﬁ lter currently interposed between the chip and the screen.

High Deﬁ nition Projection  27
 The disadvantage of this arrangement is that the ﬁ lters on the wheel absorb an appreciable 
amount of light and therefore it is difﬁ cult, if not impossible, to ﬁ ll a large screen with a 
bright enough image. The advantage is a relatively cost-effective projector that will still give a 
very high quality image. 
 5.4.2  Three-chip Projectors 
 All the projectors discussed earlier in this chapter have three DLP chips, for they are all 
required to ﬁ ll a large screen with a sufﬁ ciently bright picture. 
 Three-chip projectors work in a manner not dissimilar to a three-chip camera  – you can read 
about camera beam splitters in Chapter 13. The light coming from the projector lamp is split 
into three separate beams, each being reﬂ ected by an individual dichroic mirror so that Red 
light arrives at one chip, Blue at another and Green at the third. Once these separate beams 
of light have been reﬂ ected by their own DLP chip, in the manner required by each frame of 
the moving image, they are then all brought back together again in a homogeneous ray and 
delivered to the projector lens. 
 As dichroic mirrors are far more efﬁ cient than absorption ﬁ lters, this arrangement produces a 
much brighter image on the screen for any given power of projector lamp. The downside of 
getting that very bright, superbly sharp image on the cinema screen is a more costly projector.

CHAPTER 6 
 Delivery Requirements 
 6.1   For Delivery on Film 
 There are various processes that need to follow the completion of the editing process. If you 
have been editing from Digi Beta copies, the original camera tapes will have to be conformed 
to the Edit Decision List (EDL), thus producing a continuous stream of shots that make up the 
movie. Just as it is with ﬁ lm it is prudent to keep to a minimum the number of times the High 
Deﬁ nition (HD) information is re-recorded, so the grading process might be combined with the 
conform, thus taking out one copying process. If you have been editing on a platform that has 
been working in full HD standard and the material was played in from the camera tapes, then 
the material will in all probability have been stored on a disk array. This means that there will 
have been a zero loss of quality during the edit and a fully edited version lies in the disk array, 
thereby removing the need to conform. In these circumstances, and assuming they have the 
facilities, you might prefer to grade and add all the effects within the same post house directly 
from the original disk array. In some post houses you might even be able to play out from the 
edit suite disk array directly into the laser printer, always assuming you have never come out of 
the HD format, thereby maintaining a very high quality. If this is practical it is an excellent way 
to proceed. If this is not possible then one way or another you must arrive at a fully conformed 
and graded HDCAM tape, or possibly a tape format of even higher quality and stability, 
which contains all the effects and titles, etc. This tape will, most likely, be fed into a disk array 
associated with the printer, for it takes up to 2.5 seconds to print each frame. Pausing each 
frame on the tape is impractical, so the material must reside on some kind of drive capable of 
random access of individual frames. The ﬁ rst photographic copy that is struck can be of various 
types  – negative ﬁ lm stock or intermediate ﬁ lm stock  – just as with the traditional ﬁ lm process. 
If the printer uses a cathode ray tube (CRT), then most likely the ﬁ rst copy will be made onto 
slow-speed camera negative. If a laser scanner is being used it is more common for intermediate 
stock to be used –  then you have the choice of writing either a negative or a positive image. 
 6.2   Higher Resolution in Post-Production 
 It is becoming more common for ﬁ lms wanting to maintain the highest picture quality, add 
greater channels of surround sound, or carry out multilayer CGI in post, to either record 

30  Chapter 6
their material on a higher quality medium than HDCAM or at least up-res it to that higher 
resolution before entering the post-production arena. HDCAM-SR and -D5 come to mind. 
This may well be an excellent idea for cinema release but I have to question the wisdom 
of that added cost if the production is not going to be seen on a higher grade presentation 
medium than High Deﬁ nition Television (HDTV) and for DVD release it seems to me to be a 
considerable waste of scarce production resources. 
 6.3   Multiformat Delivery Requirements 
 If you are not required to deliver a ﬁ lm-out print then it is likely that any international 
client will prefer that you deliver the product on an HDCAM tape recorded in the 24P or 
25P format. The alternative is that they will require a tape converted by you to their home 
standard; this is relatively easy to arrange. Most post houses are both adept and experienced 
at this form of conversion with absolutely no, or at worst very little, loss of quality or 
convenience. The thing to watch out for with certain conversions, as discussed later, is that 
the time code has gone across successfully  – you may need to stripe in new time code on the 
standards converted copy. If you know before shooting commences that a foreign version 
is required, I strongly suggest you make a small test and send it right through the 
post-production chain. 
 6.4   HD Projection 
 Most HD projectors are capable of taking an output directly from an HD video tape recorder 
(VTR). This, however, is not an ideal source if many viewings are to take place, as it involves 
an, admittedly minimal, mechanical wear to the tape. Alternatively, you can transfer the 
material to a hard disk array or transfer it to a server. There is an increasing move to persuade 
cinemas to accept the movie from a central point with delivery by satellite, ﬁ ber-optic or 
even via broadband across the Net, though at the time of writing this is technically possible 
but would take an inordinate amount of time. As broadband transmission rates are becoming 
faster and faster this may become a viable proposition. These options would only transmit the 
zeros and ones, not formed pictures, so there should be no loss of picture quality. 
 6.5   Encryption 
 A major consideration in shipping material around a country or even the world is the very 
strong possibility that somewhere out there, there will be a person not connected with the 
producers who would very much like to get hold of a copy of the material so that, illegally, 
they could make a considerable proﬁ t. The solution to preventing this looks likely to be 
encryption. This is a method of encoding so that only those with the key to the code are able 

Delivery Requirements  31
to open the ﬁ le and use the material. Perfect encryption ciphers are much sought after and are 
currently being seen as the holy grail of shipping physical or virtual movies around the world. 
Interestingly Kodak, the great yellow giant, happens to be a leader in the ﬁ eld of image data 
encryption. Kodak has not taken its eye off the digital ball. 
 6.6   Broadcast Delivery 
 With no need to convert the HD image to a piece of ﬁ lm the options and choices within the 
broadcast world are quite different. The most important thing to understand is that originating 
in HD does not tie the production to any of the current transmission standards. One of the 
most signiﬁ cant attractions of HD, particularly HDCAM, is that it is a stand-alone format 
with an incredible ability to convert, without any discernible loss in quality, to any broadcast 
standard.
 Since writing the ﬁ rst edition of this book it has been wonderful to see broadcast production 
houses ﬁ nally realize that the transparent convertibility of HD to other standards can, and I 
believe will, produce revenue that more than compensates for the slightly extra cost of HD 
origination.
 At its inception HDCAM was conceived as a platform that provided an international 
exchange format  – 24P. Unfortunately, so far, this goal has not been realized due to insular 
and short-sighted attitudes on the part of some producers. The  “ not invented here ” syndrome 
still lives on in many parts of the world. Fortunately the HDCAM platform is able to convert, 
in either direction, between most of the other eight formats so that origination made in the 
HDCAM platform continues to move forward. 
 6.7   Convertibility 
 6.7.1  Picture 
 It should be noted that the misconceptions that prevail as to convertibility must be scrutinized 
carefully, for most of the perceived problems are easily overcome. To take the most common 
problem, shooting in the USA and posting in the UK or vice versa: it is hardly a problem at 
all. If you shoot at 24P and post in 25P you have a 4 percent run time differential. Likewise if 
you shoot at 25P and post at 24P again there is a 4 percent differential in run time. What does 
this differential mean? Very little! 
 6.7.2  Sound 
 The human eye cannot discern a 4 percent differential in the speed of movement; so as far 
as the pictures are concerned, 4 percent makes no difference to the ﬁ nal audience. Our ears, 

32  Chapter 6
on the other hand, are a little more sensitive to changes in the speed at which a soundtrack 
is played back. Most sounds we hear are unfamiliar to us, so a 4 percent change in pitch 
is inconsequential. But if the audience is listening to musical instruments they are familiar 
with, someone with perfect, or near perfect pitch, will recognize that there is an error. Do not 
despair; available now, and at very small cost, are devices called pitch correctors  – they work 
in real time and you only need to deploy them when you have your ﬁ nal cut, so the machine 
time needed will be relatively small. 
 6.7.3  Time Code 
 When swapping between 24P and 25P in either direction one must be aware of some time 
code problems. At the point of conversion, be it just after origination or after the master cut 
has been produced, it may, indeed most probably will, be necessary to stripe in a new time 
code at the new frame rate. This is really a very simple procedure and should not be feared. 
It just needs to be watched. One simply ends up with a 24P and a 25P copy, each with their 
appropriate time code, and the two different copies can be generated at very little cost. 

33
CHAPTER 7 
 Sales Potential 
 7.1   Multiple Standard Sales 
 If you have made the master recordings on HDCAM using the 24P or 25P recording format, 
then it is relatively easy to produce economically many versions from this master, in many 
different formats. Directly from the Sony HDW 500 or similar video tape recorder (VTR), 
assuming it is ﬁ tted with all the conversion cards, you could play out in 24P, 25P, 30P, 23.98P, 
29.97P, 59.97i, 60i and 50i. That covers most, if not all, of the television formats around the 
world. From the same master it is possible to print out to ﬁ lm in almost any aspect ratio from 
1.175:1 right up to 2.4:1. Clearly, by originating in the economical and convertible formats of 
either 24P or 25P using the HDCAM, HDCAM-SR tape or even, nowadays, a portable hard 
drive to store the ﬁ nal version, many markets are opened up that otherwise might have been 
closed or for which it would have been too expensive to provide a suitable version. 
 7.2   Multiple Venue Sales 
 Therefore from a 24 or 25P HDCAM master any television station or cinema can receive 
a version that precisely ﬁ ts their requirements. There are other venues and display points 
that should be considered. In-store large screen displays will beneﬁ t from the added quality 
and color depth of High Deﬁ nition (HD). Very large screens or video walls of images are 
increasingly used for sales presentations; the difference in visual impact on such screens 
between pictures originated on conventional television formats, or even Super 16  mm, and 
HD, can be quite startling. When multiple screens are used the format will fulﬁ ll all likely 
requirements; think of an in-store situation where you might want a video wall at one point in 
the store but require several conventional televisions around the store. Economics may force 
you to use domestic televisions around the store but the big screen would be better supplied 
from a true HD source. 
 7.3   Additional Sales to HD Users 
 Currently, the USA, Japan and Australia have HD transmission systems and are often 
prepared to pay a premium for HD programs. Europe and the UK in particular are fast 

34  Chapter 7
catching up. Most broadcasters deem an HD program to be one originated in true HD either 
in the 1920    1080 or the 720    1280 formats, depending on the local standard, or one shot 
on 35  mm and transcribed through a telecine capable of sufﬁ cient quality. With the possible 
exception of wildlife programs, most broadcasters will not accept more than a very small 
percentage of material originated on Super 16  mm or Digi Beta. As can often happen, a 
single additional sale to an HD station can more than ﬁ nance any extra costs involved in HD 
origination. Clearly, a prudent producer would try to make the sale before production begins, 
but it is quite likely that there are reasons, some even economic, to shoot on HD even without 
a pre-sell in place. If this is the case then a post-production sale to one of these stations, 
particularly given the premium they might pay, can be very nearly all proﬁ t. The only costs 
involved are transcribing an extra HDCAM tape and shipping. 
 7.4   Future Prooﬁ ng 
 The raw tape stock is unlikely to last physically as long as ﬁ lm, even given that both are 
stored in ideal conditions. The cost of lengthening the life of an HD tape is very low; you just 
make a clone every 20 years or so. The cost of preserving ﬁ lm is high for, even if the master 
negative exists in perfect order, new prints are expensive, though new copies will be required 
at far longer intervals. 
 There is always the argument that recording standards may change and they certainly will, 
eventually, but HD is so easily convertible between standards I cannot see why a copy in 
some new format could not be made simply and economically in any newly arrived format. 
If you want to make a new television copy at full resolution from a ﬁ lm the cost can be 
considerable, involving both telecine and processing charges. 

35
CHAPTER 8 
 Cost Implications 
 8.1   Savings 
 8.1.1  Origination Costs  – Different Formats 
 When I wrote the ﬁ rst edition of this book things were simple  – all I had to do was compare 
35 and 16  mm ﬁ lm with HDCAM tape. Now things are not so straightforward. Some camera 
manufacturers are beginning to assume that tape is the least likely recording medium and that 
ﬂ ash drives, hard disk recorders or even commercially available Compact Flash (CF) cards 
will be the chosen medium. 
 Solid-state devices or hard drives look attractive, for, once you have lifted the data from 
them they are reusable, but therein lies the rub. It is essential that those precious data which 
represent the producer’s total investment be lifted and stored with an incredible level of 
security. The potential for disaster at this point in the process is far greater than it used to 
be simply loading ﬁ lm from tins to camera magazines and back again, and we have all 
experienced at least one disaster there in our careers! 
 This data handling requirement can, and probably should, add a new craft on set and with 
this the added expense of the salary; let us call this person the Data Wrangler. No sensible 
production would take the data from the master recording format and store them in a single 
drive. They need a minimum of two backups. Once that has been done the master recording 
medium needs to be wiped and probably reformatted and made available again to the 
shooting crew in such a way that there can never be any possibility of the crew confusing 
newly formatted data with shot rushes. Even in the days when only tape was available, most 
of us at some time have managed to record over a favorite take  – that becomes even easier 
with formats that are intended to be recorded over many times. 
 8.1.1.1  Stock savings  – ﬁ lm to HDCAM 
 The greatest saving is in the origination medium. If we look at the pure cost of picture 
origination  – that is, just negative stock and processing for ﬁ lm as against the tape cost 
alone  – Super 16  mm costs 8.5 times as much as High Deﬁ nition (HD) and four-perf 35  mm 
costs a staggering 32 times as much. And remember at this stage in the process the ﬁ lm 

36  Chapter 8
cannot be shown, for it is still only in its negative form, but the HD tape can instantly be 
played at full picture quality.  
 8.1.1.2   Insurance savings 
 There are some less obvious possible savings. One producer I have met was having to put two 
video tape recorder (VTR) playback machines into the cutting room as a very quick delivery 
was required. As this equipment was already paid for, they realized that it was possible to 
make an exact copy of the day’s work every night on wrap. This is known as cloning the tape 
and is simply a matter of telling the machines to transcribe the zeros and ones on the tape 
without processing the information, thus making an absolutely perfect copy. This very astute 
producer was then able to negotiate with the completion bond company to send them the 
camera original tapes immediately after cloning and thereby dramatically reduced the cost of 
negative insurance. 
 Another production with which I was closely involved was an American show being shot in 
Prague that needed to have, at the end of every shooting day, two HD copies, one to remain 
in Prague and the other to be sent by FedEx back to the USA every day. This show was 
scheduled for a 16-week shoot so the cost of making and shipping the extra HD copy looked 
like being considerable as, initially, the plan was to have a runner drive to Germany every 
night, which at the time was the nearest location where clones could be made. 
 After looking at the problem for a while I realized there was a much better solution. It was 
quite a big production and had, from the outset, budgeted for a playback crew to be on set all 
the time. The solution was to add an HD VTR to the playback kit so that a simultaneous copy 
of every shot was recorded in real time. This was particularly easy as a full quality HD signal 
was being sent to the playback desk and there down-converted to an SD signal that was fed 
into the mini DV recorder for normal action checking. The playback crew were more than 
happy to take on this extra task, for on the odd occasion when a full HD image was required 
it made their life much simpler. More importantly it saved the production a very considerable 
amount of money. 
 8.1.2   Savings in Print Costs 
 Were you making a very low budget movie it is possible for the production to save completely 
the cost of producing a print. Once you have conformed your HD masters to a single ﬁ nished 
tape you have in your hands the highest quality version of the movie you will ever know. 
Assuming you have not yet found a distributor, which is very common on low-budget ﬁ lms, 
why not hire a cinema equipped with an HD projector and show them the conformed tape? 
It should cost no more than hiring a cinema with a mechanical projector, the picture quality 
will be stunning and only when a distributor has come on board do they need to make 
conventional prints, and this can be agreed to be at their expense. 

Cost Implications  37
 8.1.3  Shooting for Anamorphic Release 
 Many ﬁ rst- or second-time directors ﬁ nd themselves in the position of wishing they could 
shoot in the widescreen picture ratio of 2.4:1, but are prevented from doing so by the 
considerably greater cost of hiring the necessary lenses, which often also increases the 
lighting budget as they are not necessarily as fast as conventional lenses, nor do some of 
them work particularly well at wide aperture where the anamorphic element within the lens 
is not as efﬁ cient. With HD these problems disappear. Although the camera will always 
record an image with an aspect ratio of 16  9 (1.777:1), if you wish to end up with a 35   mm 
anamorphic image from an HD original you simply switch on the 2.4:1 bright-line mask in 
the camera viewﬁ nder and compose for this. You introduce similar masks onto your monitors 
both on set and those used in the editing room. When you come to show your ﬁ nished movie 
there is a switch on the digital projector to enable it to project only the center section of the 
image, the part for which you originally composed. 
 Similarly, if you are heading for a ﬁ lm version, again it is simply a matter of telling the 
printing machine that you want an anamorphic 2.4:1 master and it will take the center section 
of the image and squeeze it to produce an image that looks exactly as if it were shot with 
anamorphic camera lenses. 
 As to lighting costs, you are using exactly the same lenses for HD origination whatever aspect 
ratio you choose to shoot in. Therefore it is quite possible to shoot an anamorphic picture 
at an aperture of T 1.8. You can therefore, if you so choose, work at far lower set brightness 
than with a ﬁ lm camera ﬁ tted with anamorphic lenses. The camera has, by the way, a limiting 
aperture of T 1.6 caused by the image-splitting prisms; this is described in the Technology 
part of this book. You will have realized that as you are not using the full height of the HD 
image you might well lose picture quality; you are in fact now only using around 800 pixels 
vertically, though horizontally you still use the full 1920 pixels. Theoretically you do lose 
picture quality but the quality of the image projected suggests that you don’t. In fact, on some 
screens the appearance of the image suggests that the image is improved. This is because, 
provided that two pixels are closer together on the screen than the resolution of the human 
eye, your brain will tell you that the image is perfectly sharp. In almost all viewing conditions 
that is because the screen is made wider for the anamorphic viewing, so objects in the picture 
will be bigger and you may therefore think them sharper. 
 Alternatively nowadays, if you have the budget, you can shoot with a camera that has a single 
chip the size of a Super 35   mm ﬁ lm frame and then use the cheaper spherical 35  mm lenses 
and transfer just the 2.4:1 center section as you would from a Super 35   mm negative. This can 
give superlative results and, as seen elsewhere, can even reduce the lighting budget compared 
to using true anamorphic lenses. Both the Arriﬂ ex D-21 and the RED camera, cameras at 
opposite ends of the spectrum, can achieve this. 

38  Chapter 8
 8.2   Added Costs 
 8.2.1  Camera Kit Rental 
 It is important to compare the costs of the whole camera kit and not just the camera itself. 
Even if you are using video assist with a ﬁ lm camera you will not need, say, a 24-inch HD 
monitor, but when shooting HD such a monitor can be an invaluable tool both to the director 
and to the cinematographer. They are expensive items and can push up the total kit cost 
dramatically. As a very rough guide, a top-end HD kit comprising, say, a Sony HDW 900R, 
a couple of zoom lenses and a wide-angle prime lens, together with a selection of monitors 
and heads and tripods, will often cost something like 130 – 150 percent more than a similar 
35    mm kit. For television production, if comparing a Super 16   mm kit with an HDW 750P, 
again with Panavision lenses, the difference is 235 percent  –  much more expensive, but you 
do get a picture that looks as if it was shot on 35  mm when shown on television. Now it must 
be admitted that most broadcast productions will not be able to afford such high-quality 
lenses. This is unfortunate but top quality broadcast style lenses are still capable of showing a 
substantial increase in perceived quality over any digital origination previously available and 
can, if like for like productions are compared, still present a real challenge to a Super 16 image. 
 8.2.2  Editing Costs 
   If you are taking the most common route through the editing process, converting either ﬁ lm or 
HD to Digi Beta for the cutting room, then the expenditure is not signiﬁ cantly different. Most 
post houses charge roughly the same to telecine 1 hour of either 16   mm or 35  mm as they do 
to down-convert 1 hour of HD to Digi Beta. At the end of the editing session it will probably 
be necessary to conform the camera masters to the Edit Decision List (EDL). This comes at a 
not dissimilar cost to negative cutting so little is lost or gained, though it is possible to make 
savings by grading the HD master at the same time rather than having to have photochemical 
answer prints. If you can afford it, it is possible to use an off-line edit suite that can operate 
directly in the HD domain. In terms of picture quality this is ideal, for as ﬁ ner and ﬁ ner cuts 
are achieved the result can be played out in full HD quality without the need to conform the 
camera masters; indeed, some sophisticated editing packages can perform most of the grade 
as well. In practice, editing in full HD format is only common for movies with a very big 
budget or commercials where the time spent in the editing suite is much shorter and therefore 
becomes affordable. 
 8.2.3  Writing Out to Film 
 If you decide to write out to ﬁ lm it is important that you make the right decision as to 
producing either the equivalent of an intermediate negative or an intermediate positive. 

Cost Implications  39
If you only expect to make a few prints, say six or less, then the advice is usually to go to a 
negative. If you are making a large number of prints you would probably go to a positive so 
that you can make a number of internegatives, from which you then make the release prints in 
volume. It is most important to make the right decision as the conversion from HD master to a 
photochemical master can be a very expensive process. Most printers take around 2.5 seconds 
to print each frame, so a 120-minute movie is going to take just a little under 5 days to print. 
As the printing machines are very expensive you can imagine where the money goes. 
 There are two forms of printers, one using lasers to write lines of information to the ﬁ lm stock 
and the other forming the whole image on a cathode ray tube (CRT) and then projecting it 
onto the ﬁ lm. They produce images with a slightly different character; both can be very good 
but you will need to test or see demonstrations of both before you shoot and decide which 
you are going to use, otherwise it will be impossible to visualize the ﬁ nished picture during 
shooting. In general, the post houses using a CRT tend to be a little cheaper, though it has to 
be said more people seem to prefer the image from the laser printers. 
 8.3   A Cost Comparison Example  – Oklahoma! 
 I was asked to be the Director of Photography (DP) on a shoot transferring the National 
Theater stage production of Oklahoma! to the screen just as HD was becoming commercially 
available. Unfortunately, as we needed three cameras for the duration of the shoot plus a 
further two occasionally, using HD became an impossibility as the supplier simply could not 
guarantee enough equipment at that early stage of its introduction, so we shot it on 35   mm 
ﬁ lm. This, I thought, was a great shame, for there would have been many advantages with 
HD both for myself as DP and to the producers. For myself I would have loved to have been 
staring at 24-inch monitors showing the ﬁ nished product, for I saw many advantages when 
lighting a huge set, 110 feet across and 90 feet deep, in being able to see the results of my 
work instantly. For the producers there would have been two main advantages: ﬁ rst, as they 
needed both a 35  mm print and a tape for international television distribution, the HD master 
tape would have rendered a much better image than the PAL master transfer after standards 
conversion to, say, NTSC; secondly, it would have saved them a lot of money. My judgement 
at the time was that the ﬁ lm version would have looked equally good originated on either 
medium; now I have much more experience of HD I think this particular production might 
even have looked better shot digitally. 
  8.3.1  Stock and Processing Savings 
 In 19 days we shot 265,000 feet of 35   mm negative. At the standard prices prevalent at the 
time of shooting, the cost of the raw stock, processing it and transferring it to a Digi Beta tape 
for the cutting room would have been about  £ 150,000 ($215,000). The equivalent HD tape 

40  Chapter 8
cost would have been about  £ 3250 ($4650). So using HD, in terms of stock costs, would have 
saved  £ 146,750 ($210,000). Put another way, it was over 46 times more expensive to use ﬁ lm. 
 The above dollar conversion was that at the time of shooting. 
 8.3.2  Camera Rental 
 With the camera rental prices applying at the time, I estimate that the HD camera and 
monitoring kit might have been  £ 12,500 ($17,900) more expensive than the 35  mm ﬁ lm 
camera kit. 
 8.3.3  Additional Costs 
 There would have been an additional cost of making a negative from the HD master in order 
to provide the cinema print that was required. It must be remembered that, more often than 
not, there will be little need for photochemical grading as the HD to HD grade may often be 
done in the same photo ﬁ nishing house and they will be very familiar with the in-house 
ﬁ lm-out requirements. At the time we shot  Oklahoma! , transferring an HD tape to a ﬁ lm 
negative was far more expensive than it is now; there were very few post-production facilities 
that could handle it then, whereas now there is much more competition in the market, which 
has naturally driven costs down. Still, to be fair, let us look at the costs at the time.  Oklahoma!
had a ﬁ nished screen time of 180 minutes. Transferring HD to 35   mm negative would have 
cost  £ 600/minute ($858/minute), so the cost of making a negative would have been  £ 108,000 
($154,440). You could probably nearly halve those costs at the time of writing. 
 8.3.3.1   Overall savings 
 All the photochemical costs after that would be identical except that small savings might be 
made in the lack of the need for answer prints, but let us ignore that. Therefore, even after 
making a 35  mm negative, the producers would have saved  £ 39,800 ($50,900) on the stock 
and processing costs going right as far as the cut negative. Today, HD to ﬁ lm transfer prices 
are roughly half what they were when we shot  Oklahoma! so, were they making it today, the 
producers could look to saving something like  £ 79,600 ($101,800). 
 8.3.4  Competitive Pricing 
 All the above is, as I said at the beginning of the chapter, based on worst case scenarios. As 
HD enters the market more and as many more suppliers have much more equipment on their 
shelves with many more post houses also being HD equipped, the actual costs of shooting 
and post-producing HD are continually coming down; this makes the cost comparison with 
ﬁ lm even more attractive as those costs are remaining more or less static. It is therefore well 
worth shopping around but, please, don’t get so beguiled with the savings available that you 

Cost Implications  41
end up saving money by using inferior lenses. I have had a number of ﬁ lm-makers I have 
advised come back at the end of shooting and say that the quality, while good, was not quite 
as good as they had hoped. On every single one of those occasions it turned out that they had 
economized on their lenses. Many of the so-called HD lenses are not capable of producing 
images as good as those the cameras are capable of creating; therefore to realize fully the 
potential image quality of the HD system a careful choice of lenses is essential – even if they 
seem expensive!

CHAPTER 9 
 Crewing
 There is an unfortunate misconception rife among some producers that if you shoot digital 
High Deﬁ nition (HD) you can work with a much smaller crew than with ﬁ lm. To make the 
judgement simply on the recording format is, in my view, foolish and comes from looking at 
the history of the HD medium from the wrong perspective. 
 Historically, video shoots have used smaller crews. This is because they have been conceived 
from their beginnings as low-budget productions and, had the decision been made to shoot 
them on ﬁ lm, it too would have been done with the smallest crew possible. 
 There is another signiﬁ cant and unfortunate result of these misconceptions. With some rare 
exceptions tape has not, in the past, been scheduled for many productions that would have 
had even the slightest chance of affording ﬁ lm. As a result, even Digi Beta has rarely been 
given the chance to show its true potential as, with the lower budgets it is usually conﬁ ned to, 
the quality of the design input is often so poor, the daily minutes of screen time shot so high 
and the crew so small that it becomes impossible to produce a high-quality product no matter 
what you are recording on. 
  If you subscribe to any of the above opinions of low-budget tape productions you must 
change them when shooting HD. With HD the recording medium is irrelevant to these 
arguments, for it is the  picture quality that is the key technical contributor to the crewing 
decisions. The quality is as high as that of 35     mm and therefore all crewing must relate to 
previously gained 35    mm experience. The kit is usually bigger and heavier than a Digi Beta, 
though the HDW 750P and the newer HDW F900R and Panasonic Varicam camera kits 
come in much nearer to the same weight. Single-chip cameras currently weigh roughly the 
same as 35   mm ﬁ lm cameras and you must include in this all the on-board accessories the 
Director and the camera crew will expect mounted on the camera in order to produce a truly 
professional job. 
 9.1   Should the DP Operate? 
 In my opinion, not if you want your digital output to look as good as possible. The viewﬁ nder 
on the cameras is usually poor compared with a ﬁ lm camera and therefore I believe that it is 

44  Chapter 9
essential that the Director of Photography (DP) stays back at a correctly set-up HD monitor in 
order to judge both their lighting and what is being recorded. There are better HD viewﬁ nders 
coming on stream so this may soon change. 
 9.2   Do You Need a Focus Puller? 
 Operators with a television studio background are used to pulling focus for themselves. 
Allowing them to continue to do this on an HD shoot can be a very dangerous decision 
indeed. Those of us who are trying to produce really good images from 2/3-inch HD cameras 
are usually trying to work at very wide apertures in order to reduce the depth of ﬁ eld to 
something that looks similar to that expected on ﬁ lm. Once this shorter depth of ﬁ eld is 
achieved, the focus pulling difﬁ culties become the same as for 35  mm ﬁ lm and a fully trained 
and experienced focus puller becomes essential. More often than not this desire to reduce 
the depth of ﬁ eld, and have softer backgrounds, comes not only from the DP, but is also a 
requirement of the Director. 
 If you are planning to shoot with a single-chip camera with a chip roughly the size of the 
35  mm ﬁ lm frame, then it is essential that you have a fully trained focus puller familiar with 
working on the 35  mm format. This is also true if you are putting lens adapters on 2/3-inch 
chip cameras in order to use lenses from the 35  mm world. If you go for, say, the MoviTube 
or Pro 35 then although this may look like an economical solution, unless you spend the 
money on a fully trained and experienced focus puller, there is a very high probability that a 
signiﬁ cant number of shots will be soft. 
 Focus pulling is about talent and mathematics. The ﬁ rst you have to pay for; the second, 
depth of ﬁ eld, is totally unavoidable. You heard it here! 
 9.3   Do You Need a Loader? 
 There is no job for a traditional loader but there is a vital job for a slightly differently 
trained camera assistant. Fortunately many very good ﬁ lm loaders are just as skilled and 
useful on an HD shoot. While, admittedly, there are no camera magazines to load, tapes 
still have to be changed and labeled, and report sheets prepared for the cutting room. Still 
more importantly, the color monitor will have to be set up, organized and lined up, a task I 
usually give to this camera assistant. Most of my camera assistants who perform these tasks 
are more than able to line up the monitor and I have come to rely on them to do so. As I 
would not necessarily have the time to do it, my camera assistants will check the line-up 
every time the monitor is moved and after every break. If you are on a multicamera shoot 
then the logging of the tapes becomes vital and a camera assistant can end up the busiest 
person on the set.  

Crewing  45
 9.4   Naming the Camera Assistants 
 Within a year of the introduction of the Sony HDW F900, the ﬁ rst HDCAM camera available, 
the Guild of British Camera Technicians (GBCT) suggested to its members that the current 
naming of the camera assistants as Focus Puller and Clapper Loader should revert to the older 
names of First Assistant Cameraperson (AC1) and Second Assistant Cameraperson (AC2). 
This, I believe, was both sensible and signiﬁ cant. The GBCT saw that HD was a reality and 
that many of its members would be working in this area, and renaming their grades would 
help them to gain work within the new parts of their industry. It is not often that one sees 
an established industry guild look forwards rather than hang on to the past as furiously as 
possible and I, for one, commend them for an almost unique foresight. 
 9.5   Do You Need a Clapperboard? 
  My answer is deﬁ nitely yes. It only takes the slightest error in the camera, the play-out 
machine feeding the editing suite, the edit suite itself, the conform suite or in the creating 
and reading out of the Edit Decision List (EDL) for a shot, or whole scene, to go completely 
out of sync or, even worse, end up cut into the wrong place. If a ﬁ lm-style clapperboard is 
used there is always the visible shot number to refer back to, and the physical clapper for 
synchronizing the shot. I have to admit that I doubt any machine’s ability to count reliably. 
This lack of faith has saved many a production considerable amounts of money by them 
being able to go back to the clapper to regain sync. Some old ways are still the best! 
 There is another reason to use a clapperboard that is just as important. Most technicians are so 
tuned to knowing a take starts with calling the number and banging two bits of wood together 
that they don’t really go quiet or, more importantly, really start to concentrate until they hear 
the board. It pumps up the adrenaline and you will ﬁ nd you are going for far fewer takes if 
you use a clapperboard than if you do not. That can be a big saving. Actors ﬁ nd the same to 
be true; to a ﬁ lm-trained or experienced actor the moment to perform simply has not come 
until the board has gone on. 
 9.6   Do You Need a Dolly Grip? 
 Deﬁ nitely. The modern style of shooting usually involves a very mobile camera and the 
grip, or dolly grip in the USA, is the person to provide this quickly and smoothly. They also 
provide all the usual toys and accessories one expects on any shoot. A good grip’s van is an 
Aladdin’s cave and a treasure trove of solutions to problems. They also do all the usual and 
useful things like having the required camera support needed for the next shot already set up 
and that can really speed things up. 

46  Chapter 9
 9.7   Sound 
 The manning requirements for sound hardly vary at all between ﬁ lm and HD. The route 
chosen for post-production will dictate whether or not the sound is recorded on the HD 
camera tracks alone or if a second recording is to be made, in which case this is usually 
recorded on a portable Digital Audio Tape (DAT) recorder. When shooting HD it is usual for 
the DAT recording to be the master with the camera tracks as backup, so there will usually be 
a cable between the camera and the recordist. Clearly the recordist, more properly referred to 
as the mixer in the UK, will not be able to operate the mixing desk, the DAT recorder and the 
microphone, so the absolute minimum sound crew will nearly always consist of a mixer and 
a boom swinger. A third person on sound, often known as the sound engineer, can be a great 
boon as they can swing a second boom and greatly speed up the turn-round to a new set-up. 
 9.8   Electricians 
 As I have said, it is a popularly held misconception that HD cameras need less light. This 
is a fallacy. The baseline equivalent ﬁ lm speed of an HD camera is usually 320 or 400 ASA 
to tungsten light, sometimes a little more, and this is roughly the same as for some of my 
favorite ﬁ lm stocks. The DP will frequently be lighting to balance with existing sources such 
as daylight or practical lamps within the set, what I think of as the “ given ” , and then exactly 
the same amount of light will be required no matter how you photograph the image. This said 
I am often using a lens setting around one stop wider on 2/3-inch HD cameras than I might 
for Super 16 and two-and-a-half stops wider than for 35  mm. This is to obtain roughly the 
same depth of ﬁ eld purely for artistic reasons. The differences will be obtained by the choice 
of ﬁ lm speed in the ﬁ lm camera and by the sensitivity setting on the HD camera, and with 
neutral density ﬁ lters, behind the lens with HD, and in front of the lens in both media. 
 When all these considerations are taken into account, it becomes clear that the same number 
of electricians are likely to be needed and that their number will be dictated more by the 
script, the  “ given ” , and the way you intend to shoot it than by what you are recording the 
image on. 
 9.9   A New Member of the Crew – the Data Wrangler or Downloader 
 If you are recording to tape all that has gone before is just ﬁ ne but if you are recording to 
any kind of hard drive, ﬂ ash card or similar you have another problem to contend with  – the 
fact that during the shooting day your all-important images have to be copied from that very 
expensive capture medium, that medium wiped or reformatted, and that data storage device 
returned to the set for further recording. I cannot state strongly enough how important a job 
this is. Anybody who has shot using these kinds of storage media has, almost certainly, lost 

Crewing  47
data at some time. That is a very expensive mistake! If you think of a reasonable television 
drama the producer is spending upwards of  £ 100,000 ($200,000) a day. Imagine what might 
be the consequences if all the morning’s work was accidentally erased during lunch. 
 Many producers have tried to suggest that the camera trainee can easily handle the data 
transfer in their spare time. This is a ridiculous premise for several reasons. First, it has 
always been next to impossible to get the picture insurance company to allow the trainee to 
load ﬁ lm magazines and the likelihood of a mishap during data transfer and the recycling 
of storage medium is far higher than accidents in the changing bag. Therefore the insurance 
company will not countenance the idea. Further, it is unwise to transfer all those important 
data to just one new home; at least two copies must be made, though I grant that these may 
well be made simultaneously if the budget allows for sufﬁ cient equipment. 
 After the transfer of those expensive data the storage medium has to be erased and/or 
reformatted. The next step is, in my experience, the most likely moment for an accident to 
occur, when a crew member comes to collect what they assume is a fully backed up and 
ready to record data unit. Is everyone  absolutely sure that it is safe to use? For your sake I do 
hope so. 
 The Data Wrangler (I do like this very American job title; it sums up the craft so well) should 
have a quiet space to themselves and most importantly establish an area away from the rest of 
their kit where only fresh data storage is collected by crew members so that no mistakes can 
possibly occur. 
 The Data Wrangler is not a job created by imaginative crews to get another person a salary, 
but an absolutely essential and very skilled person who is vital to the protection of what used 
to be the rushes and brings peace of mind to everyone. The insurance company will, most 
likely, not insure the picture without one if you are going tapeless so you might as well get a 
good one, whatever the daily rate.

CHAPTER 10 
 Digital Imaging 
 10.1  The History of Digits 
 It is widely thought that one Claude Elwood Shannon, who died at the age of 84 in 2001, 
single-handedly laid the foundation for what became known as information theory, that 
branch of mathematics concerning the transmission of data in a digital form. 
 In what has been called the most important Masters Thesis of the twentieth century, 
A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits , published in 1938, he ﬁ rst put forward 
the notion that it was possible to solve problems simply by manipulating two symbols  – one 
and zero  – in an automated electrical circuit. 
 Later in his work  A Mathematical Theory of Communication he ﬁ rst coined the term  “ bit ” as 
the fundamental unit of information that encapsulates digital certainty as in true or false, on 
or off, yes or no. He also was the ﬁ rst to show how to design circuits to store and manipulate 
bits. It was Shannon who set in motion the route to the compact disk, cyberspace, digital 
television and the digital movie camera. 
 I think I should have rather liked Claude Shannon, for although preferring to work alone he 
was friendly and liked to start his day at noon with a game of chess against the director of the 
Mathematics Center at MIT, then working on late into the evening. He had a fascination for 
juggling and produced a paper on the underlying mathematics of juggling. While working at 
the Bell Labs he could occasionally be seen juggling while riding a unicycle down the halls. 
 10.2   Digital Tonal Range 
 In a digital camera the whole tonal range is divided into a large number of individual values, or 
samples, and each sample is assigned a given value. The number of samples that constitute the 
complete tonal range of the output of each individual pixel determines the smoothness of the 
overall tonal range. The more samples that are used to record the complete tonal range of 
the picture, the smoother will be the transition from one tone to another and the subtler will be 
the ﬁ nal image. 

52  Chapter 10
 If, for instance, you decided to divide the complete tonal range of the image into 1000 parts 
from each pixel’s output and should you record them mathematically you would have to read 
any number between 0 and 1000. This would be complicated, as your recording and playback 
process would have to be capable of recognizing 1000 different units of measurement. 
 In order to overcome this the digital camera records information using a binary code. A 
binary code uses a combination of zeros and ones, as Shannon had suggested, to write 
any value and the number of zeros and ones you use in the code determines the number of 
different values you can record. 
 If you are only going to use two units of zeros and ones, a 2-bit code, you can write four 
combinations, which are: 
 00, 01, 10 and 11. 
 You already have two advantages: you only have to use two numbers in order to write, 
in code, any of four values; secondly, and just as important, your recording and playback 
machines only have to recognize either a zero or a one, the equivalent of  “ on ” or  “ off ” , 
and even a pretty stupid machine can tell if it is on or off and this leads to a high level of 
repeatability when writing and reading this form of code. It also needs to understand the code 
in order to write or reconstitute the zeros and ones into a picture; fortunately with modern 
electronics this is relatively easy. 
 If we increase our code length from 2 bits to 4 bits we can record 16 values as there are that 
many combinations available: 
 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110 
and 1111. 
 The mathematical function works like this: if you had a 1-bit code you could only record 
two values, the ﬁ rst represented by zero and a second represented by one. Increasing the 
code to 2 bits multiplies the number of codes you can write by a factor of two. In fact, every 
time you add a digit to the code you will increase the number of values you can record by a 
multiplication of two. Adding two more values multiplies the number of available samples by 
a factor of four.  Figure 10.1 shows the progression up to the remarkable 8192 values recorded 
by a 14-bit code now being used in some of the more advanced digital cameras. 
 If you were to read the speciﬁ cation of a camera you might not think there was a huge 
difference between one where the camera’s processor uses a 10-bit code and one using a 
12-bit code, but as we have seen the difference is between the tonal range being broken down 
into 1024 values and 4096 values. This might make a difference to the perceived picture 
quality depending mainly on how you would be viewing the ﬁ nal image; on a television 
screen it may be next to impossible to see any difference. 

Digital Imaging   53
 10.3  Linear and Logarithmic Sampling 
 There is a way of encoding the original scanned image of the camera that can make the 
picture more appealing to the eye, make it appear more like a ﬁ lm image and at the same time 
reduce the size of the digital ﬁ les used to store the images. It involves the use of logarithmic 
sampling rather than the traditional linear sampling. 
 With linear sampling the steps between each brightness sampled are exactly the same 
throughout the tonal range of the image, as in Figure 10.2 . Some high-end High Deﬁ nition 
(HD) cameras set out to emulate a ﬁ lm image as closely as possible; a modern ﬁ lm emulsion 
can comfortably handle a brightness range of 11 stops and so can many HD cameras. A full 
11 stops of tonal range recorded linearly to the current industry standard will need a 13-bit 
ﬁ le to hold all the data if the image is going to be of sufﬁ cient quality to be printed to ﬁ lm 
without any noticeable loss in quality compared with a ﬁ lm original. 
 Our eye/brain combination is more interested in shadow detail than highlight detail and 
therefore the quality of image in the shadows needs to be better than in the highlights for us 
to think of the recorded picture as real. In order to get sufﬁ cient data for the shadows to look 
real, and like 35  mm ﬁ lm, there must be 8192 options of recordable brightness for each pixel 
of the image.

54  Chapter 10
 Because of the shape of the brightness response curve a ﬁ ner gradation between recorded 
values will occur in the highlights than in the shadows when the image is sampled linearly. 
With logarithmic sampling, as shown in  Figure 10.3 , there are more steps in the area of the 
shadowed part of the scene than in the highlights and this results in the recorded values being 
evenly spaced across the tonal range. 
  If a tonal range of 11 stops is sampled in a logarithmic way and to the same subtlety of tonal 
range, then the same amount of information can be recorded on a 10-bit ﬁ le, which has only

1024 options. This means much smaller ﬁ les are needed and the audience will still believe 
they are seeing an image of equivalent quality. 
 10.4  Image Resolution: Why So Many Pixels? 
    Figure 10.4    shows a black and white image that has been chosen for its very smooth gradation 
of tones. Nevertheless, if you take a magnifying glass to the picture you will see that it is 
made up of a huge number of tiny dots, which at normal reading distance are totally invisible 
to the eye. This is the way images are printed in books and newspapers. In this application 
the size of the dot changes, and it is always black, so lots of small dots at the same spacing 
appear pale gray and large dots, again at the same spacing, will appear as dark gray. With 
digital imaging we vary the actual brightness of each dot, not its size. 
 Figure 10.5 shows the original smooth tone image broken up into a reasonably mild pixilated 
image; the image is still recognizable but the individual pixels are clearly deﬁ ned.  Figure 10.6 
shows a much coarser pixelated image and in  Figure 10.7 the pixilation is so coarse that had 
we not seen the original picture we wouldn’t have the faintest idea what the image contained. 
The important lesson from this is that for the digital camera to deliver a really ﬁ ne image each 
chip is going to have a very large number of pixels. 
 10.5  Required Resolution for HD 
 One often hears arguments as to the image resolution needed to satisfy the human eye on a 
large cinema screen. Many, predominantly from the post-production community, will claim 
 Figure 10.4 :  The effect of pixilation: original scene 

56  Chapter 10
that a  “ 4K ” resolution is required and that a 1920     1080 pixel camera is inadequate for it 
only has a  “ 2K ” resolution, the  “ K ” in this instance referring to the number of horizontal 
pixels used.  “ K ” in this context represents 1000. The argument for a 4K image only holds 
true when a 35  mm piece of ﬁ lm is scanned, manipulated digitally in some way and cut back 
into the original roll of ﬁ lm for printing. This is because original 35  mm camera negative is 
capable of holding an image equivalent to a horizontal resolution of 4000 units. 
 Figure 10.6 :   Scene with coarse pixilation 
 Figure 10.5 :  Scene with mild pixilation 

Digital Imaging   57
 You do not necessarily need 4K resolution when originating an image to get an image onto 
a cinema screen as good as one expects from 35  mm ﬁ lm. Let us look at a ﬁ lm’s route from 
camera to cinema screen. In order to duplicate the original negative many, many times so 
that it may be shown simultaneously in many cinemas, the picture will have to be copied, 
photographically, several times, as shown below. 
 The original camera master is copied to: 
 an inter-positive print ﬁ lm which is then copied to: 
 an inter-negative ﬁ lm which is printed to: 
 the release print which is then shown through: 
 the projector lens on to: 
 the cinema screen. 
 This lengthy process is necessary because ﬁ lm is mechanically vulnerable and the Producer, 
wisely, will only allow the camera master to go through a printing machine a limited number 
of times. By the end of post-production that Producer’s whole investment lies in the camera 
master and they do not want it damaged. Each intermediate copy has a limited mechanical life 
so each inter-positive will produce a ﬁ nite number of inter-negatives and the inter-negatives 
a ﬁ nite number of release prints. Hence the cascading of the printing process is essential to 
arriving at hundreds of prints for eventual showing in cinemas. 
 Figure 10.7 :  Scene with very coarse pixilation  

58  Chapter 10
 Unfortunately even the ﬁ nest photographic copying process slightly degrades the quality 
of the image. By the time that a 4K master negative image reaches the screen, most experts 
agree that the image on the screen is unlikely to be better than 1.2K; even the most optimistic 
don’t claim better than 1.4K. Compare this with a 1920    1080 HD image that in an ideal 
world will have stayed in that format right through post-production and will be projected 
by the ﬁ nest digital projector currently available. In this instance the only degradation the 
image will have suffered will have come from the projector lens. This image is going to be 
considerably better than 1.4K. In fact, it will be very close to 2K! 
 If that HD image has to be printed out to ﬁ lm for exhibition, careful planning of the post-
production workﬂ ow can considerably reduce the number of photographic copies needed and 
therefore ensure the image is ﬁ nally seen with at least 1.4K horizontal resolution. 
 Whatever the argument the picture on a cinema screen has to please the human eye and the 
ﬁ nite resolution of the eye is generally agreed to be an angle subtending to the eye of one 
minute of arc. There are 360 degrees in a circle and each of those degrees, for measuring 
purposes, is divided up into 60 minutes, so one minute is a very small angle indeed. This way 
of deﬁ ning the eye’s resolution relies on the idea that if two dots are placed next to each other 
and, when looked at they are inside an angle to the eye of one minute of arc, then they will 
appear as a single dot. If together they are outside the angle of one minute then we will be 
able to see them as two dots. 
 Here are two dots: 
 •  • 
 Try moving the book away from you until they merge into one dot. At that distance the angle 
subtended from the outside of the two dots to your eye will be roughly one minute of arc. The 
actual distance will to some extent depend on the quality of your vision. 
 The above criterion is used to determine if an image will appear acceptably sharp to an 
audience. If we take HD’s most taxing method of display, a large cinema screen, and then 
compare the accepted resolution for 35  mm ﬁ lm presentation with HD we can tell whether an 
HD image will look better, worse or the same as the 35  mm image. If you look at  Figure 10.8 
you will see how the mathematics work. Standard practice is to assume the optimum viewing 
position in a cinema is one-third of the way back from the screen. The angle of one minute of 
arc is drawn out to the screen from this position and back to the 35   mm ﬁ lm in the projector 
gate. One minute of arc translates as one-thousandth of an inch at the ﬁ lm gate. 
 The image on a piece of 35  mm ﬁ lm is two and a half times bigger than the 2/3-inch chip used 
in most current professional HD cameras so in order to give the same apparent resolution the 
smallest dot recordable on an HD chip, one pixel, must be 1/2500   inch. A 2/3-inch chip with 

Digital Imaging   59
1080     1920 pixels on it has a single pixel size of exactly this value, so we can expect the 
same resolution as 35  mm ﬁ lm. 
 The evidence clearly shows that pictures originated by a 1080     1920 HD camera are, 
theoretically, as sharp and can have the same tonal range in the cinema as conventional 35  mm 
ﬁ lm. 
 One should not always be swayed by any other argument than the evidence of your own eyes 
in these matters. As I said earlier  – if it looks right, it is right. 
 10.6  Data Quantity 
 It is interesting to note the quantity of data being processed just behind the three chips in the 
camera. First let us look at the information we are trying to record. We have seen that in a 
three-chip camera using the 1920    1080 format there are 6,220,800 pixels being deployed to 
capture the whole image and that each pixel’s digital output in a typical camera using a 12-bit 
processor can have the choice of 4096 different values. Therefore the total number of options 
is 6,220,800    4096    25,480,396,800. This, of course, is not necessarily the number of 
units being recorded, just the number of options. 
 What the camera has to record is the 12-bit binary code from every pixel and this sum goes as 
follows: 1080 vertical pixels    1920 horizontal pixels    3 chips    12 bits of binary code per 
pixel, which equals 74,649,600 bits of information per picture.

 That is all very well, but we are recording a moving image and even at the camera’s slowest 
frame rate of 24 frames per second (fps), a single second of moving image will require 
74,649,600    24   1,791,590,400 bits of information to be recorded each second. 
 Just for fun let’s look at a complete recording tape lasting 50 minutes at 24 fps. It will store 
1,791,590,400 bits    60 seconds    50 minutes    5,374,771,200,000 bits of information per 
tape. Quite astounding!

CHAPTER 11 
 Scanning the Image 
 11.1  A Little of the History of Television 
 Television was developed in the mid-1930s and two very different systems came to the fore: 
one was based entirely on an electronic platform using cathode ray tube technology that 
had been developed by the Marconi company; the other was an amalgam of electronics and 
mechanical shuttering to divide up the picture, developed in England by John Logie Baird, 
who was almost certainly the ﬁ rst man to transmit a moving picture over the airwaves. 
 Extraordinarily the Marconi system utilized interlace scanning and Baird’s method used, 
in effect, progressive scanning. It has taken 70 years for the world to realize that, in this 
respect, Baird was ahead of his time. Not only in that respect, for he arguably invented color 
television and 3D television and demonstrated both to the public; all this is well known and 
well documented, but sadly forgotten by many. There were many other differences. The 
Marconi company thought the ideal format would be landscape (that is, a rectangle that is 
wider than its height) and they scanned it horizontally, and Baird initially thought much of 
television would be illustrated radio so initially his ﬁ rst format was portrait (a rectangle that is 
higher than it is wide), this being more suited to talking heads, so he started by scanning his 
frame vertically, with a little curvature to the lines it has to be said. Later, when he moved to a 
240-line format he also incorporated a 5    4 landscape aspect ratio. 
 Initially the basic principle of Baird’s camera was a lens focusing an image on a spinning 
disk, which had a series of holes in it (arranged as in  Figure 11.1) , behind which was a single 
photoelectric cell. In this illustration I have much exaggerated one of the problems with this 
system: the scans are circular in nature, resulting in an image made up of lines of information, 
shown in  Figure 11.2 . A very much bigger shutter with the holes all grouped near to the outer 
edge more or less solved this problem. Baird moved to larger shutters and ﬁ ner holes grouped 
closer together, thus improving picture deﬁ nition, but he did not have the resources of the 
Marconi company and this, together with other problems, resulted in the Marconi system 
being adopted for the ﬁ rst public broadcasting system by the BBC (British Broadcasting 
Company, later Corporation) in London. 

62  Chapter 11
 Nevertheless Baird’s model did scan in the way we now describe as progressive, for the 
lines were scanned one after the other in a sequential way. The Marconi system scanned all 
the odd numbered lines of a single picture ﬁ rst and then went back and scanned all the even 
numbered lines, just as standard deﬁ nition television does today. The considerable advantage 
of this scanning format is that it results in a small amount of data being scanned continuously 
and fools the eye/brain combination of the viewer into thinking it is seeing twice as many 
pictures, thus considerably reducing ﬂ icker, which is especially apparent in the highlights of a 
picture. As human vision is blessed, or cursed, with a phenomenon known as the persistence 
of vision the audience, more or less, happily adds together both scans and believes it is seeing 
all the image at the same time. 
 Persistence of vision means that any image we see at a given moment takes some time to 
die or fade away; it persists in the retina of the eye and within the brain. The image will still 
contain the remnants of an earlier moment and we add together a little bit of past images 
to the immediate and current image. If the human eye/brain combination did not have

this anomaly then cinema images would not work and television images would be quite 
unacceptable in their current form. 
 11.2  Interlace Scanning 
 As we have seen, interlace scanning is simply the dividing up of an image into horizontal 
lines and sampling the data along the odd numbered lines, then returning to the top of the 
picture to begin scanning the lines that were previously ignored  – the even numbered lines  –
in the same way. 
 The deﬁ nition, or perceived sharpness, of the resultant image will effectively be determined 
by two factors  – how many lines the picture is divided up into vertically and how often 
a sample is taken as each line is scanned. The two most popular High Deﬁ nition (HD) 
standards in use at present either scan 1080 lines and sample each line 1920 times or scan 720 
lines and sample each line 1280 times. 
 Figure 11.3 shows how the scanning takes place. We can see that when both the lace and the 
interlace scans are performed, small blocks of information are produced. Each block is an

64  Chapter 11
even density; each block is representing the output of one pixel on the camera’s chip. You 
will also see that if the small area on the ﬂ ag is blown up then the blocks, or pixels, make 
little sense even when both scans are shown together, for it requires a large number of lines 
and very frequent sampling to make our eyes believe we are seeing a completely smooth 
tonal range with sufﬁ cient sharpness for us to believe we are looking at real life.  Figure 11.3 
has been prepared so that the original picture of Grand Central Station and all the derivative 
pictures actually come from a master photograph scanned at a resolution giving 1080 vertical 
lines each sampled 1920 times. 
 Think about this: the master picture looks to be of very high quality but the blow-up of the 
section of the ﬂ ag proves it is not. This is how digital imaging works. With enough pixels we 
can produce an image that the human eye thinks is perfect; hence the need for HD images  –
the pictures are so much more realistic. 
 11.3   Progressive Scanning 
 With the introduction of the 1920    1080 HD pixel array it became possible to ﬁ ll a cinema 
screen with a digital image arguably as good as a ﬁ lm image, as we have seen in Chapter 
10. Unfortunately if the HD image was captured in interlace scanning the way things moved 
across the screen was not acceptable to a cinema audience. This is probably for two main 
reasons: ﬁ rst, when blown up to the huge size of a cinema screen the interlaced image was 
not completely convincing as real life and, perhaps more importantly, did not display the 
kind of movement on the screen the audience had come to expect in the cinema  – this we call 
conditioning. Personally I am not convinced we look at the best pictures possible in a cinema 
but they are the pictures we have become used to. 
 There are two issues when viewing pictures in the cinema: the screen is very dim compared 
with a television picture so ﬂ icker at 24 frames per second (fps), shown twice (i.e. 48 times a 
second), is not too big a problem and the display size is large, particularly when you consider 
the viewing angle from the audience’s eye. As an example it is common to view a standard 
deﬁ nition picture in the home from a distance of around 6 – 10 times the height of the picture. 
As HD screens, which are usually bigger, come into the home the viewing distance is reduced 
to 3 – 5 times the height of the picture  but , in a decent cinema, the viewing distance becomes 
0.7 – 2.5 times the picture height. 
 So what did a cinema audience expect and how was it created? To answer this question we 
need to investigate two matters, image ﬂ icker and motion blur. 
 11.4   Traditional Cinema Flicker 
 Much as purists would like to deny it, all ﬁ lm images ﬂ icker to some degree. 

Scanning the Image   65
 The current standard for the mechanical projection of 35   mm ﬁ lm is 24 fps, with each frame 
shown twice. This gives rise to a certain amount of ﬂ icker on the cinema screen, particularly 
noticeable in the brighter parts of the image. The audience are, happily, conditioned to this as 
just enough images are shown per second to be acceptable but even to begin to remove this 
ﬂ icker the display rate (fps) would have to be doubled. As we have seen, it is also true that the 
relatively dimmer picture in the cinema, compared to television in the home, makes ﬂ icker far 
less apparent. Things are just a little less simple than that; they are also a little more elegant. 
 Figure 11.4 shows how a camera shutter is orientated to leave the aperture open during 180 
degrees of its rotation and blank the aperture for the other 180 degrees. This is very simple 
and effective, for at 24 fps it results in an exposure of 1/48th of a second. When the shutter 
is closed the ﬁ lm is being moved to the next frame and when the shutter is open the time is 
given over to exposing the ﬁ lm to the image. 
 In the camera, which is usually close to the microphone picking up the sound, the ﬁ lm 
transport mechanism has to be very quiet. A claw mechanism is usually deployed, which 
might not be terribly fast at pulling down the ﬁ lm but is accurate and quiet. It does not 
necessarily have to be very kind to the ﬁ lm’s perforations as they will only pass through the 
camera once. 
 In the cinema projector things are a little different. In designing the projector a prime 
consideration is to maximize the amount of light reaching the screen. As the projector will

66  Chapter 11
almost certainly be in a room separate from the audience, known as the projection box, how 
much noise it makes is not a consideration. What is a consideration, though, is how kind the 
transport mechanism is to the ﬁ lm and its perforations, for whereas the camera only passes 
the ﬁ lm once, a ﬁ lm print may pass through a projector many hundreds of times. 
 Most cinema projectors use a transport mechanism driven by a device known as a Maltese 
Cross. The mechanism consists of sprocket wheel attached to a drive shaped a little like a 
Maltese Cross, which is driven by a rotating pin. This arrangement causes the sprocket to 
rotate intermittently, usually a quarter turn each time the pin hits one of the four slots in the 
cross. The advantages of this transport mechanism are that it is very kind to the ﬁ lm, as at 
least four perforations on each side of the ﬁ lm are engaged with the sprocket teeth at any one 
time, thus greatly reducing the load on each perforation, and it can therefore safely pull the 
ﬁ lm down much more rapidly, usually in one-quarter of the full frame rate, without damaging 
any of the perforations. It is, however, very noisy. 
 As the projector mechanism only needs one-quarter of total time to transport the ﬁ lm, the 
shutter can now be opened for 270 degrees and closed for 90 degrees. This increases the 
screen brightness by 50 percent relative to a 180-degree shutter. The disadvantage of this 
arrangement is that having a greater opening time than closed time brings us back to our old 
problem, ﬂ icker. Extending the shutter opening time will considerably increase the apparent 
ﬂ icker. 
 This is overcome by introducing a very small extra shutter blade, as shown in  Figure 11.5 , 
which effectively fools the eye into thinking it is seeing 48 fps despite every two consecutive 
frames being identical, as the same frame is still in the projector gate. This extra blade is 
known as the  “ phantom shutter ” . 
 All this may seem less than relevant to HD cinematography; it is not, for it is important to 
understand what many ﬁ lm makers are asking the HD 24P format to try to replicate  – the look 
and appearance of ﬁ lm when shown in a cinema or on television, warts and all! While I have 
happily shot several HD productions giving this look, I feel we might be missing something 
important. HD can have its own look; it may not be familiar to the lay audience but I, for one, 
like it very much and look forward to the day when, hopefully, I am asked to give my all to a 
pure HD image. That, perhaps, was the sponsor’s message! 
 11.5   How are Images Captured by the Two Scanning Formats? 
 Let us use a simple example of a disk moving left to right across the frame to be 
photographed as in  Figure 11.6(a) . If we photograph this moving disk using interlaced 
scanning, then we will record a picture, known as a ﬁ eld, and each ﬁ eld will be photographed 
in a slightly different moment in time. Each ﬁ eld contains half the vertical information twice

for every complete picture, the complete picture being known as a frame. As two ﬁ elds are 
required to complete each frame, in US television 60 ﬁ elds are required to complete the 
required 30 frames in every second of recording and in the UK 50 ﬁ elds are required to 
complete 25 frames every second of recording. 
 Each ﬁ eld is displayed sequentially on the screen so the progression of the disk across the 
picture will be displayed as in  Figure 11.6(b) . 
 With progressive scan each frame is captured in its entirety in a single moment in time and 
will be recorded as in  Figure 11.6(c) . If it were then to be written out to ﬁ lm there would be 
one complete disk recorded on each frame of ﬁ lm and this would very closely emulate an 
image recorded by a ﬁ lm camera. Unfortunately not all HD formats work this way. 
 Sony call the frame recording standard for HDCAM progressive segmented ﬁ eld (PSF). This 
means that although in our illustration the disk moving across the screen will be  captured in 
its entirety at the given frame rate, it will currently be  displayed electronically on a cathode 
ray tube (CRT) television in the same way as an interlace picture  but with each lace and 
interlace ﬁ eld being from the same moment in time. This is not all bad, for it is exactly the 
way ﬁ lm is displayed when shown on television. On a CRT television screen, however, it 
will not appear as smooth a movement as an image captured using an interlace scan, where 
twice as many half-resolution ﬁ elds are usually displayed per second, but it will be a much 
more acceptable image when shown in a cinema. That acceptability comes partly from 
the technical reasons described and partly from the fact that the audience is conditioned to 
expect a different kind of picture when watching television at home and a ﬁ lm in the cinema. 
Interestingly these differences may start to become less apparent as home screens for High 
Deﬁ nition Television (HDTV) become larger and larger. 
 Another factor is coming into play in the domestic marketplace for televisions. There is a 
dramatic move from the purchase of CRT televisions to larger ﬂ at-screen televisions. Indeed, 
after 2006 one major British retailer stopped selling CRT televisions altogether. These larger 
televisions cannot be made using CRTs and the new ﬂ at-screen technology requires that the 
display is conﬁ gured in the progressive scan format, thus solving many of the problems. 
 To take this a step further let us consider how interlace ﬁ elds actually arrive at our television 
screen. In  Figure 11.7 each box contains the image of one ﬁ eld containing half the vertical 
information of the moving disk but, importantly, each ﬁ eld has been captured in a different 
moment in time. When the audience looks at their television their persistence of vision adds 
the subsequent ﬁ elds together and they believe they are seeing smooth movement. Up until 
recently this is how television has traditionally worked, both in the standard and HD arenas. 
 There is another, and possibly more important, human factor at work here  – saccadic eye-
tracking. In essence this describes the fact that our eyes inherently follow a moving object; we 

Scanning the Image   69
inherited this from our ancient ancestors, where the ability to follow food or a predator was 
crucially important. 
   Figure 11.8 , on the other hand, shows how a series of pictures shot in progressive scan 
television, and ﬁ lm, appear when shown on an interlace display device. Half the vertical 
information is shown on each ﬁ eld but between the ﬁ rst and the second ﬁ elds the disk has not 
moved. While the viewers ’ persistence of vision happily adds the ﬁ elds together and sees the 
true resolution, they still only think they are seeing half the number of samples as the disk 
crosses the screen. This produces a juddering movement but, because saccadic eye motion is 
interrupted, the eye suddenly can’t follow the track accurately so splits the two ﬁ elds into two 
separate objects moving across the screen. If the spacing of the objects on the two separate 
ﬁ elds is small it appears as judder, but if it is large the eye starts to think of it as two separate 
objects. Fortunately, once the audience is conditioned to it this is hardly apparent to them, 
provided the distance between objects on the two ﬁ elds is small. 
 Figure 11.7 :  Interlace ﬁ elds as displayed on a cathode ray tube 

70  Chapter 11
 Many years of experience have enabled cinematographers trained in ﬁ lm to minimize the 
perceived effect. Remember we have been looking at ﬁ lm on television displayed just this 
way for many years and many of the audience have been perfectly happy with the results. 
Some technicians are less than happy, which is one reason why so much work is being done 
on the new HD standards in the hope that in the near future a much higher technical, artistic 
and emotionally involving picture presentation format will result. 
 Why are we just as happy with the two very different ways of delivering the whole of the 
information? The two effects work best with different genres. Here are two examples. A 
feature ﬁ lm, being ﬁ ction, usually though not always contains slowly moving objects and 
the ﬁ lm exposure and progressively scanned HD are best suited to the recording of slow-
moving objects. Interlace scanning is much more suited to fast-moving objects. Witness the 
fact that most sports fans hate seeing their favorite game shot on ﬁ lm  – they much prefer it on 
television, in interlace. 
 Figure 11.8 :  Pictures photographed with progressive scanning displayed on a cathode ray tube 
using interlace scanning 

Scanning the Image   71
 Our eyes can be fooled in several different ways into believing that sequentially displayed 
still pictures are a true representation of a moving object, thank goodness, or cinema and 
television would be in dire trouble! 
 Each interlace ﬁ eld is photographed in half the time taken for a complete frame and each of 
those ﬁ elds will therefore have been photographed in half the time a complete progressive 
scan will have taken place. Therefore the effective shutter speed for a ﬁ eld of interlace will 
be half the shutter speed for a complete frame. The shorter the exposure time that is used to 
capture a picture of a moving object, the sharper will be the leading and trailing edge of that 
object on the picture. Think of trying to photograph a car passing the camera using a relatively 
slow shutter speed: the background will be sharp since the camera did not move relative to it, 
but there will be a noticeable blur surrounding the car as that is moving relative to the camera. 
 The core difference is that although the interlace ﬁ elds are sharper we are given twice as 
many of them per second so our brain, seeing so many, assimilates them as a true rendition of 
a moving image. With progressive scan, and ﬁ lm, we are tricked into believing we are seeing 
a true moving image, because although we are seeing half as many pictures they have twice 
the resolution but, more importantly, they have a blurred edge, because the exposure is twice 
as long, and blurred, just as persistence of vision gives us in real life. Which is all ﬁ ne, so 
long as the movement in the frame is relatively slow. To an experienced eye rapid movement 
within the frame shot on ﬁ lm at 24 fps is not satisfactory at all  – the judder can be most 
disturbing. If a good Director of Photography (DP) is asked to photograph rapid movement 
like this they will nearly always try to work with a small depth of ﬁ eld, thus putting the 
background out of focus and removing the relative movement between the moving object and 
its surroundings  – that horrible judder is now no longer apparent. It is interesting that this is 
one of the primary reasons good DPs and camera operators hate unmotivated pans. 
 The conclusion must be that either you need to give the eye a sufﬁ cient number of sharp 
pictures that they appear to blur together in our brain or you need to record some kind of blur 
on each frame so that the brain is satisﬁ ed it is looking at real life. In order to give a little light 
relief to the simple moving disk,  Figure 11.9 shows ﬁ rst a hot air balloon stationary in the 
sky and then a representation of a single frame of progressive scan or ﬁ lm as captured when 
the balloon starts to move. Looked at in isolation this blurred frame looks odd, but when 
20 or more pictures of its subsequent movement are shown every second the viewer will be 
completely convinced they are watching natural movement. 
 11.6  Printing Out to Film 
 As yet cinemas that can project a digital image via an HD electronic projector are in the 
minority and therefore in most cases it is necessary to take our digital image and transcribe it 
to a ﬁ lm print for display in a cinema. 

72  Chapter 11
 First let us consider how a picture captured using interlace scanning will look on that piece 
of ﬁ lm. Remember the two ﬁ elds have been captured at slightly different moments in time. 
 Figure 11.10 shows how subsequent frames of our moving disk will look if the two ﬁ elds 
making up a complete frame are both printed to a single frame of ﬁ lm  – odd, to say the least. 
Fortunately this transfer technique, though used extensively in the past, particularly with CRT 
display devices in the transfer equipment, is not common now, though can still be found in 
some post-production houses  – beware of them!

Scanning the Image   73
 It is now possible to combine the two ﬁ elds, superimposing them in the same space on the 
ﬁ lm print, and this is currently much more common; this will provide a single complete disk 
on each frame having full resolution, but that disk will be made up of alternate lines taken 
at different moments in time  – believe me, this looks equally odd, at least to me, and though 
different, perhaps not quite so bad. It is possible to pass the image through a good adaptive 
interpolator that will improve things enormously and, thank goodness, this is much the most 
common procedure today. 
 Were we to print a complete frame of picture acquired using progressive scan we would get a 
series of complete disks, where all the information contained in each frame had been acquired 
at the same moment in time, very much as in  Figure 11.11 , and also very much as if it had 
been recorded on ﬁ lm. 
 At present, progressive scanned images when used in the television environment may not 
have quite as many advantages as some people would have us believe. There are many 
subjects, notably sport, where interlace scanned pictures are more acceptable if shown on a 
television at the present time; they are also what the audience is used to. However, ABC in 
 Figure 11.10 :  Interlace scanning printed to ﬁ lm  

74  Chapter 11
America and some Scandinavian countries show sport in a 720P with 60 fps or 720P with 
50 fps, both of which give a wonderfully smooth motion; indeed, this has been the ATSC 
speciﬁ cation since 1990. The difference here is that although the pictures are captured in 
progressive scan the frame rate is much higher, 50 or 60 full frames per second, and it is this 
that removes most of the problem. 
 I strongly favor this move as it undoubtedly makes movement appear much more natural no 
matter what the subject, be it ﬁ ction, documentary or sport. 
 Having said all the above, if you wish to acquire your images digitally and then want to show 
them in a cinema, via either a digital projector or from a ﬁ lm print, my belief is that capturing 
them with progressive scan is  essential to give the audience the experience they expect of 
cinema presentation. 
 There are a number of other issues that affect the perceived quality of a digitally acquired 
picture and most of these are discussed in the next chapter, covering line standards.

CHAPTER 12 
 Line Standards and Deﬁ nition 
 There are two main structural standards for High Deﬁ nition (HD), one based on a pixel 
layout of 1920    1080 pixels and the other of 1280     720 pixels. In addition to the number 
of pixels there are other factors that contribute to the perceived quality of the picture; these 
include the choice between the image being scanned in an interlace or progressive manner 
and, if it is scanned in interlace, a factor best described as line summation that can affect that 
perceived picture quality. While both the standards can support up to 60 frames per second 
(fps) it is more common, with professional cameras, to ﬁ nd a 1080 camera limited to 30  fps 
with several 720 cameras going up to 60   fps. 
 The 1080 format has the choice of the original image being scanned in either interlace or 
progressive while the 720 format is always scanned in progressive. Let us consider the 1080 
format ﬁ rst. When Progressive scanning is used with 1080 lines, especially when shown 
in the cinema, it undoubtedly gives the highest perceived, and indeed technical, quality. 
Unfortunately for the picture quality interlace scanning, in any format, comes with the 
function called line summation. 
 12.1  Line Summation 
 In the early days of standard deﬁ nition television, cameras utilized tubes as their pick-up 
device and they scanned the target with a 287.5-line raster, phase shifted by a half-line each 
ﬁ eld, two ﬁ elds making a complete frame. The scanning spot was Gaussian in shape and 
spilled over into adjacent lines, thus cleaning the target of all charge each time a ﬁ eld was 
scanned. The phase shift produced the spatial information for the interleaving lines. With the 
introduction of chip cameras it was necessary to mimic the picture produced by a tube camera 
in order to continue to be able to deliver the output that the transmission systems existing at 
the time expected and required. 
 In order to do this every line of pixels is scanned independently and therefore the effective 
spot size is deﬁ ned by the size of an individual pixel. What is recorded to tape as line 1 is 
the summation of the electrical output of lines 1 and 2 added together and then recorded as 
if it were just line 1. Line 3, the second scanned line in an interlace format, is then recorded 
as the electrical output of lines 3 and 4, again added together. This continues to the bottom 

76  Chapter 12
of the picture until the scanning returns to the top of the picture in order to record the even 
numbered lines and line 2 is then added to line 3 and recorded as just line 2. Again this 
continues to the bottom of the frame and then things move on to the next complete frame and 
the whole event happens all over again. This summation of the output of adjacent lines of 
pixels replicates the way a tube camera will have a scanning spot that overlaps the adjacent 
lines and, happily, doubles the voltage recorded which, effectively, makes the camera twice as 
sensitive, or one stop faster. 
 You might think that the loss in image quality caused by adding two lines together in this 
way would halve the vertical resolution but this is not so; there is another factor at play 
that helps to bring back some of the apparent loss in quality. Each ﬁ eld has half the total 
resolution of the entire picture for it only contains half the information  – half the lines. The 
 “ interlace factor ” increases the apparent vertical resolution of the picture. This is because the 
persistence of vision of the human eye helps to blend the two ﬁ elds together into a single, 
complete, picture. As a rule of thumb the effect of persistence of vision increases the apparent 
resolution from 50 percent to about 70 percent of that which would be perceived on a picture 
where all the lines were shown at once. Thus losses on one hand are, partly, replaced by gains 
on the other. 
 The 1080 format is mainly recorded in either interlace (i) or progressive segmented ﬁ eld 
(PSF), where the camera is working in a progressive mode but the picture is delivered in 
an interlace structure. It should be noted that there are few very high-end cameras that are 
dedicated primarily to feature ﬁ lm production, working in a true 1080 Progressive scan (P) 
mode. 1080P will undoubtedly give the highest quality picture in every respect, especially 
when shown in the cinema, with 1080PSF being indiscernible from 1080P in this application. 
Unfortunately, 1080PSF does not always look quite as good as 1080P when broadcast. 
 So, in the television arena, how does a 1080 interlace picture compare with a 720 progressive 
picture when judged side by side, especially subjectively, and by eye? These after all are the 
most commonly encountered and currently the most argued over. 
 12.2   Apparent Picture Quality 
 I have prepared some illustrations to demonstrate the differences in apparent picture 
quality, which, I hope, will show what happens despite their having had to be rescanned 
for publication. In producing these pictures I have imported them into my Corel Draw 12 
program in which I have scanned them in, deﬁ ning the bits to be used both in the horizontal 
and vertical dimensions. This gives a very close representation of any given digital picture if 
the number of bits in the illustration exactly matches the number of pixels that would be used 
in the digital camera. 

Line Standards and Deﬁ nition  77
 If you look at  Figure 12.1(a)   the picture has the full 1920    1080 pixels, while in  Figure
12.1(b) the picture has had the lines added together and is therefore showing, in effect, 
1920    540 pixels or bits; this is very much a worst case scenario. I would expect you to see 
very little difference; this is as it should be, for in a relatively small picture the loss is not very

78  Chapter 12
apparent to the eye. Here the width of the illustration in this book represents something like 
the same angle of view to your eye as a fairly large television screen would when viewed in 
a normal size room. The image quality loss would only become apparent if we were to blow 
that second picture up to the angle of view you would encounter in a cinema. This is why 
television has been getting away with the trick all these years. 
 One thing you might notice if you consider the two pictures in  Figure 12.1 very carefully, 
and here look at the window at the end of the station, is that at ﬁ rst glance the window in the 
lower picture might look sharper  – not what you would expect. If you look more carefully 
still, you will see that the window is not quite as sharp in the vertical dimension but the 
difference between the black bars and the brighter glass behind seems greater. This is because 
as we coarsen the deﬁ nition, and use bigger pixels, the  apparent contrast goes up and, as 
explain fully in Chapter 20, when apparent contrast increases the perceived deﬁ nition can 
increase although, technically, it has deﬁ nitely reduced. This is because the  impression of 
sharpness is the product of detail and contrast. 
 Let us look at the actual resolution of the two pictures in more detail. In  Figure 12.2 the top 
left-hand portion of the ﬂ ag from  Figure 12.1 has been magniﬁ ed 10 times. At ﬁ rst glance 
you may think the lower picture sharper; this is because the blocks making up the picture are 
bigger  – twice as big vertically. Now move the book away from you until you can no longer 
resolve the blocks in the lower picture. The upper picture should now look sharper; this is 
because the information content of the upper picture is greater and this becomes apparent 
when the eye can no longer see the blocks making up the picture. Bring the book back to 
your normal reading position and compare the lower edge of the dark portion of the ﬂ ag, the 
portion that contains the stars. The coarser vertical resolution of the lower picture creates 
a very jagged edge to the nearly horizontal line, whereas in the upper picture this is hardly 
apparent. If both pictures were to be blown up to a cinema size screen then the upper picture 
would remain perfectly acceptable while the lower would be most unpleasant to look at, 
particularly where any lines somewhat off horizontal are present. 
 12.3   1080 Versus 720 in Television 
 If we conﬁ ne the argument to the current HD television world, where 1080i has often 
competed with 720P as an acquisition format, though 1080PSF is increasingly taking over 
from 1080i, the outcome of the comparison is surprisingly similar. 1080PSF would look better 
still but let us, for now, conﬁ ne ourselves to the worst case scenario.  Figure 12.3 
shows the same scene as before with the upper picture (a) representing 1080i with line 
summation and the lower picture (b) a 720P frame where every line is independently recorded. 
As we established earlier, if we compare a 1080i picture with a 1080P picture the interlace 
version will have apparently lost around 30 – 50 percent of its vertical resolution.

Line Standards and Deﬁ nition  81
As 720 is approximately 70 percent of 1080 it follows that the pictures may look very similar  –
in  Figure 12.3  this is so. Now, just to be sure, let us compare the 10 times magniﬁ ed portion 
of the ﬂ ag again; this can be seen in  Figure 12.4  where, not surprisingly given the arguments 
above, both pictures show remarkably similar attributes regarding both deﬁ nition and diagonal

edge resolution. If you again take the book away from you until you cannot resolve the blocks, 
or pixels, you would almost certainly judge both pictures to be equally sharp. 
 12.4   Conclusions 
 Here I am going to be brave and give you my straightforward opinion. 
 With regard to picture deﬁ nition, if you are shooting for television, you will not notice much 
difference between 1080i and 720P given a good enough, and identical, delivery system, be 
it cathode ray tube (CRT), plasma screen, TFT screen or projection. But 1080P, or 1080PSF 
to a lesser extent when shown on television but not in the cinema, will always look superior 
to either of the two former standards. Motion artifacts, or motion blur, are another matter and 
your decision will be partly based on personal preference and partly on your need to closely 
replicate a ﬁ lm look; these matters were discussed in Chapter 11. 
 If the images are deﬁ nitely going to be shown in the cinema, no matter if they are to be 
shown from ﬁ lm or a full resolution digital projector, I would not hesitate to choose 1080P 
with 1080PSF a very close second. This decision is based on two criteria: ﬁ rst they provide 
the best resolution of any of the available formats and secondly the audience will have the 
preconceived idea that they are about to enjoy the ﬁ lm experience, and Progressive scan most 
nearly replicates this. 
 12.5   Is HD Worth the Trouble? 
 Most certainly  “ yes ” has to be the answer. As discussed in Chapter 10, the 1920    1080 
pixel resolution at least fulﬁ lls the resolution requirements of an audience in a commercial 
cinema so far as theatrical presentation is concerned. In most cases there will be little 
discernible difference in perceived quality between 1080PSF and 1080P but if budget and 
the convenience of the camera’s layout were not considerations then 1080P has to be the ﬁ rst 
choice. If there is a need to acquire pictures digitally and those pictures must seem to the 
audience as good as 35  mm ﬁ lm then this standard, or something at least as good, is essential. 
 For television the argument is a little different. Let us not beat about the bush: the driving 
factors for a push to introduce broadcast HD television is the war between the broadcasters 
themselves and the industry’s wish to sell more televisions. An almost incidental factor 
is a very noticeable increase in picture quality, something the ﬁ lm-makers  – that is, the 
technicians  – are very keen on. 
 How great is the improvement? If you look at  Figure 12.5 you will see a picture of Grand 
Central Station that has been scanned with the same number of image elements as the HD, 
NTSC and PAL television formats. The whole picture at this size and printed in a book is not

84  Chapter 12
going to look signiﬁ cantly different, so against each picture there is an enlarged section of the 
ﬂ ag. In the enlarged HD example the picture elements, or pixels, can hardly be seen and all 
the edges, even of the stars on the ﬂ ag, are smooth. In both the NTSC and PAL versions there 
is a noticeable pixilation  – each element is quite clear. 
 With the move to larger and larger television sets, even in the home, this improvement will 
increasingly be welcome.

CHAPTER 13 
 Three-chip Technology 
 13.1  Additive Color Imagery 
 On a television screen, for a single dot to appear as white it will have to be made up from 
three smaller dots. The dots, in the case of a cathode ray tube, are phosphors and phosphor 
will glow when hit by a beam of electrons and it will glow with a different brightness 
depending on the strength of the beam. The three small dots of phosphor that make up a 
larger dot that can appear to glow white have phosphors capable of glowing red, green or 
blue. A nearly inﬁ nite number of colors can be obtained from varying the brightness of each 
of the colored dots. If all three dots are glowing at 100 percent brightness then this will 
appear as pure white and if they are all switched off this will represent as near to black as the 
screen can produce. 
 Color plate 1 shows how additive color mixing works. Three beams of light, respectively red, 
green and blue, are projected on to a white background and where all three overlap the color 
will appear to be white. Where red and green alone overlap, the light appears to be yellow. 
Where blue and green overlap we get cyan and where blue and red overlap we see magenta. 
The three original colors red, green and blue are known as the primary colors and the three 
colors obtained by mixing equal amounts of only two of the light beams, i.e. yellow, cyan and 
magenta, are known as the secondary colors. 
 The glowing phosphors on the television screen work in exactly the same way, for if the dots 
are small enough and close enough together they appear as continuous tones and work just as 
if colored beams of light were being added together. Those of you with a background in art 
will already have realized that adding pigments of red, green and blue together creates a very 
different effect from adding light together. 
 13.2   The Three-chip Camera’s Beam Splitter 
 To anyone coming from a ﬁ lm background the description that is about to follow will seem 
like a nightmare, for they expect nothing but air between the back of the lens and the image 
plane at the time of exposure. 

86  Chapter 13
 In order for a modern three-chip video camera to function, the image from the lens must be 
split up into its red, green and blue components and each of the resultant images must then 
be delivered to a receptor, or chip, dedicated to that color. This is necessary because the 
sensors on the chips, the pixels, are only sensitive to brightness; they cannot discern color and 
therefore the three primary colors, red, green and blue, must be separated optically before the 
three component colors are each sent to a dedicated chip. As only one color reaches each chip 
the electronic output from that chip will only be an analysis of that single, primary color’s 
component part of the whole image. 
 While all this separation is happening it is vital that each color image travels through a light 
path that contains identical amounts of both air and glass. In order for this to be achieved 
three prisms are cemented together as in Color plate 2. Between the joined surfaces of the 
prisms are two dichroic mirrors, one reﬂ ecting blue light only and the other red only. Dichroic 
mirrors are used because they enable far brighter images to be separated than would be 
possible with absorption ﬁ lters. 
 A dichroic mirror works on the principle of coating a sheet of glass with interference 
layers which have both a low and a high refractive index. These layers have a thickness of 
approximately one-quarter of the wavelength of the light that is to be separated. For instance, 
a mirror that has a maximum output of 700 nanometers (nm) and a minimum output of 
350  nm will therefore be a red reﬂ ecting mirror. If the sheet of glass upon which the mirror is 
coated has a higher refractive index than the coated layer then the maximum output will be 
350  nm and it will therefore be a blue reﬂ ecting mirror. 
 Looking at Color plate 2 you will see that a full, three-color image enters the block and 
arrives at the interface between the ﬁ rst and second prisms; on the back of the ﬁ rst prism there 
is a blue dichroic mirror. All the blue portion of the image is then reﬂ ected away, and is then 
reﬂ ected a second time by the outer surface of this, the ﬁ rst prism, ﬁ nally exiting this prism 
and arriving at the chip that is to give the blue signal. 
 Both the red and green elements of the image pass cleanly through the blue dichroic mirror 
and on to the second prism in the block. At the back of the second prism is the red dichroic 
mirror, which separates off the red portion of the image, sending it to the far side of that prism 
where it is reﬂ ected yet again and exits this prism to arrive at the red chip. 
 The green image, having passed cleanly through both the blue and the red mirrors, travels 
through a simple block of glass to arrive at the green chip. 
 The block of glass in front of the green chip may appear unnecessarily thick but it is essential 
to add sufﬁ cient glass to the light path of the green image for it to exactly match the distance 
traveled by both the red and blue light paths. This is vital, for the taking lens will have formed 
an image in which all colors arrive at their point of focus precisely the same distance from the 

Three-chip Technology  87
back of the lens. Therefore with all the three light paths now identical, all three receptors will 
receive a sharp image. 
 While this splitter block is very effective it has one signiﬁ cant drawback created by all the 
glass the images have to travel through. Any image traveling through anything other than 
an absolutely clean and perfect vacuum will disperse some of its energy away from the 
desired light path; this we call ﬂ are. One can imagine that an image that is required to pass 
through three glass prisms and encounter two dichroic reﬂ ectors will disperse quite a lot of 
light on its way through this complex optical device. The video camera overcomes this by 
placing circuits downstream from the image sensors to electronically enhance the picture 
by improving the blacks and restoring the image to a higher gamma, for that too will have 
decreased as a result of the overall ﬂ are. 
 While all this electronic image correction and enhancement is very successful it does, in my 
opinion, contribute to the  “ video look ” so disliked by ﬁ lm cinematographers. If one shot a 
piece of ﬁ lm which had, perhaps by accident, an overall ﬂ are on the front surface of the lens, 
then one can imagine the result. There would be a dramatic loss of contrast and the blacks 
would have become what is referred to as  “ milky ” . To correct this at the printing stage would 
be next to impossible and even if the image was carefully transferred to tape using a modern 
telecine transfer suite, then while the blacks could be improved and the gamma altered, the 
image would never be as pleasing as had the lens been adequately shaded in the ﬁ rst place. 
This electronic grading is very much what is happening in the video camera and, as I say, 
I feel it is one of the primary causes of the video look. 
 The settings of these circuits are optimized at the factory and, despite sometimes appearing in 
the camera’s menus, should be left well alone when shooting in the ﬁ eld. 
 13.3  The Image Sensors 
 As we have seen, the beam splitter separates the red, green and blue elements of the image 
and presents them to the individual, dedicated, sensor chips. Each sensor is, as we know, 
in effect a brightness-only device that has a single color presented to it. The output of each 
sensor can be thought of as representing a red, green or blue component of the original image. 
If all three components are simultaneously shown on the screen it might look as in Color 
plate 3, a perfectly normal color image. Should only the red component be sent to the screen 
then it would look much like Color plate 4; correspondingly the green and blue components 
would look as in Color plate 5 for the green component and Color plate 6 for the blue 
component.
 The image sensor’s job is to break up an optical image into bits of information that can be 
handled electronically and ﬁ nally recorded on a magnetic tape. The sensors are in effect an 

88  Chapter 13
array of very tiny single sensors each assessing the brightness of the equivalent of the dot 
earlier described as making up a printed image in this book. In this application each tiny 
segment of the image is known as a pixel. The greater number of pixels each color image is 
broken up into, the ﬁ ner will be the resultant deﬁ nition of the image. The principle is exactly 
the same as that described in Chapter 10. In paper printing terms we deﬁ ne resolution as the 
number of dots per inch (DPI) but in electronic imaging we refer to the pixels on the chip, i.e. 
for the most common HD format 1920     1080  – the vertical number of pixels and then the 
horizontal number. 
 13.4   The Sensor Chip 
 The sensor chip itself is a printed circuit board (PCB) divided into a grid with horizontal and 
vertical squares relating to the number of pixels chosen by the camera manufacturer, most 
often for HD 1920 pixels across the chip and 1080 from top to bottom. The whole of each 
square of the grid cannot be made sensitive for various reasons, including the need for wiring 
space. Each sensor square therefore comes out slightly smaller than the grid size and the 
actual sensitive spot is smaller still.  Figure 13.1 shows a grid layout in plan and  Figure 13.2 
a cross-section where the relatively small size of the sensitive area relative to the grid pattern 
can clearly be seen. 
 The biggest problem with this manner of construction is that only a small percentage of the 
light energy available for the whole of the grid area will reach the sensitive areas. This leads 
 Figure 13.1 :  Pixel receptors  
PCB
Discrete pixel
Sensitive area
 Figure 13.2 :  Pixel array showing area covered by the sensitive units  

Three-chip Technology  89
to a serious loss of sensitivity; perhaps only 50 percent or less of the energy available within 
each grid square actually arrives at the sensitive area. To overcome this, some manufacturers 
overlay the grid with a mesh of small lenses each having nearly the diameter of the grid’s 
width, and these lenses focus a far higher proportion of the grid squares ’ available energy on 
to the sensitive area. 
 Figure 13.3 shows the cross-section of a sensor array with the lenses in place, from which can 
be seen how the lens covers a considerably greater area than the sensitive area.  Figure 13.4 
is a much enlarged section showing just two pixel areas. Very little of the light energy of the 
optical image is now wasted as all the energy falling on the lens is directed on to the sensitive 
area of each pixel element.

CHAPTER 14 
 Single-chip Technology 
 14.1  What is Available? 
 Currently there are two types of sensor available that, between them, dominate the High 
Deﬁ nition (HD) arena: charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and complementary metal-oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS). Both have advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of any sensor 
is to convert small parts of the image formed by the lens, and therefore being made up of 
varying amounts of light energy according to the brightness of the original scene in that 
particular area, into amounts of electricity corresponding to the light energy. Each of these 
discrete portions of the image is usually referred to as a pixel. It is important that the number 
of electrons coming out of each pixel can be assessed and recorded. CCD and CMOS sensors 
do this in slightly different ways; the way they do it and, more importantly, the way they 
divide up the primary colors Red, Green and Blue is crucial. Let us take a look at each type. 
 14.2   CCD Sensors 
 In a CCD sensor the electronic charge accumulated in each pixel during a single exposure is, 
after the exposure is complete, transported across the sensor to one corner of the chip where 
the individual charges can be read sequentially. An analog-to-digital converter (the A-to-D 
converter) then turns each pixel’s electrical output into a value expressed as a binary code. 
 CCDs require a specialized manufacturing process dedicated to their production. This leads to 
high manufacturing costs but does arrive at a situation where the CCD sensors usually have a 
very high quality output, are very sensitive and the output will have a very low noise content, 
especially in the part of the image dealing with shadow detail. 
 By the nature of the beast, CCDs tend to be relatively power hungry. 
 14.3   CMOS Sensors 
 CMOS sensors are much cheaper to produce than CCDs as they can be manufactured on a 
production line very similar to, or the same as, normal microprocessors that are used in most 
computers. The primary difference is that while CCDs transport the charge from each pixel 

92  Chapter 14
to a common output, a CMOS sensor can allow each pixel’s output to be individually read 
and therefore recorded independently. In certain applications this may seem a considerable 
advantage but it does come with some drawbacks. 
 In order that a CMOS sensor can do its clever trick of offering the output of each and every 
pixel to be individually assessed, every pixel on the chip has to have its own very tiny 
ampliﬁ er to boost the signal from that pixel and herein lies its disadvantage. First, ampliﬁ ers 
take up space and if that ampliﬁ er has to live on the surface of the chip, as it does, then this 
must reduce the area occupied by each pixel that can be apportioned to the light-sensitive 
device, and as that device gets smaller so its potential output will also be reduced. CMOS 
sensors do not tend, therefore, to have very high equivalent sensitivity or ISO ratings 
compared with CCD sensors. 
 Secondly, ampliﬁ cation tends to bring noise and noise tends to be more noticeable where the 
signal started off very low. In this context we are talking about shadow detail. CMOS sensors 
do suffer from noise in the shadow parts of the image, though they have improved in recent 
years. To a ﬁ lm person noise in these circumstances is very similar to ﬁ lm grain, so CMOS 
sensors tend to produce the equivalent of grainy shadow. 
 CMOS sensors require relatively little power. 
 14.4   CCDs versus CMOS Chips 
 Here is a quick checklist: 
 1.  CCD sensors usually have high-quality, low-noise images. CMOS sensors are more 
susceptible to noise, which is more noticeable in the shadow detail. 
 2.  CMOS sensors tend to be less sensitive  – that is, have a lower relative ISO speed  – as part 
of the pixel area must be taken up with an ampliﬁ er, whereas in a CCD far more of the 
pixel area is light sensitive. 
 3.  CCD sensors consume more power than CMOS sensors. CCDs can consume as much as 
100 times as much power as CMOS sensors. 
 4.  CMOS sensors tend to be cheap; they can be fabricated on a normal silicon production 
line whereas CCD sensors require a dedicated production line, making them much more 
expensive. 
 5.  Because CCD sensors have been around much longer, the knowledge base and 
experience in their production is much greater though, in this respect, CMOS sensors are 
undoubtedly catching up. 

Single-chip Technology   93
 14.5  Color Filtering in Single Sensors 
 With single-sensor cameras each individual pixel has to have its own absorption ﬁ lter, thus 
allowing only one of the colors Red, Green or Blue to reach the sensitive part of the pixel. 
The layout of three pixels arranged in this way is shown in  Figure 14.1  . 
 Before single sensors started having the very high number of pixels that have recently been 
introduced, and currently some have over 12 million pixels on a single sensor, there was a 
major issue with sensor cameras in an area known as aliasing. If you can look back well over 
10 years or more and think of a TV presenter wearing a check jacket then sometimes the 
jacket would display a completely unconvincing pattern over it. This was probably a moir é
pattern caused by an interference between the frequency of the checks in the jacket and the 
number of pixels on the cameras sensors. If, at the image plane, the frequency of the checks 
was similar to the frequency of the pixels, or a multiple thereof, then strange and unwanted 
images occurred. As the number of pixels that can be put on a chip is increased, this problem 
is reduced. 
 Film does not have these particular aliasing problems because on a single frame of ﬁ lm the 
sizes of silver grains, from very large to very small, are distributed in a somewhat random 
pattern and therefore will not form regular interference patterns with a constant and repeated 
pattern within the scene. Furthermore, each frame will have a distribution pattern utterly 
dissimilar to the frame preceding it or following it, and hence the repeat pattern problem does 
not exist. 
 14.6  Bayer Pattern Filtering 
 In order to overcome some of the problems with aliasing, Kodak invented a pattern of 
distribution of the Red, Green and Blue ﬁ lters covering each pixel in a single-sensor camera 
and this patterning is referred to as Bayer pattern ﬁ ltering. While it would be impossible

94  Chapter 14
to read out the signal from a chip with a truly random distribution of Red, Green and 
Blue ﬁ lters, the Bayer pattern goes a long way towards it. The idea is to have an orderly 
distribution of ﬁ lters in such a way that each line of ﬁ lters will have its colors in a different 
distribution to both the line of pixels above it and the line of pixels below it. To achieve this, 
twice as many Green ﬁ lters are used as are used for both Red and Blue. 
 Each row of pixels contains only two colors and one of those colors will always be Green. 
So the ﬁ rst line, say, will alternate Green and Red, the second line Green and Blue, and the 
third back to Green and Red, as in Color plate 7. Now while this is not exactly random it 
does approach that state. One of the effects of Bayer patterning is that the output from all the 
Green pixels, assuming all the pixels receive the same amount of light, will be twice that of 
either the Red or Blue pixels. The resolution of the Green image will also be twice that of 
the Red or Blue images. The RAW output from a chip using Bayer pattern ﬁ ltering is usually 
rather low in contrast and very green, as one would expect. 
 Interpolation circuitry can sort out a RAW Bayer image. Clearly it is easy to either amplify 
the Red and Blue outputs or attenuate the Green. This has to be done carefully or one of 
two problems, or both, will result. Amplifying the Red and Blue outputs will bring up the 
noise content of the signal, far from an ideal situation, and attenuating the Green signal may 
signiﬁ cantly reduce the sensitivity of the camera. 
 The solution is to apply very sophisticated algorithms to the signal to come up with a 
complete signal where Red, Green and Blue all match in exactly the proportions of the 
original scene  – this can be done but it requires considerable computing power and time. 
This is why many cameras employing Bayer patterned sensors leave this conversion from the 
RAW data to the mains powered computer in the cutting room, for to do it in-camera would 
dramatically shorten battery life and make the camera much heavier and hotter  – not a good 
thing.
 All this said, I have seen some very pleasing pictures from cameras using Bayer ﬁ ltering, 
though it has to be said not all the cameras can easily be monitored and some only really 
produce an ideal picture after post-production. 
 14.7   Sequential Filtering 
 As described earlier, until the advent of chips with very high pixel counts single chips using 
sequential ﬁ ltering showed signs of the aliasing described above and sometimes vertical 
colored stripes could be discerned in certain circumstances. A single sequentially ﬁ ltered 
sequence is shown in Color plate 8. If a sensor has so many pixels that the sampling rate is 
higher than any pattern frequency likely to be found in any given scene then the problems 
disappear; it has only recently been possible to produce sensors of this kind. Currently one 

Single-chip Technology   95
of the best of this kind of sensor is to be found in the Panavision Genesis, which has 12.4 
million pixels. At this sampling rate Panavision can safely employ sequential sampling, and 
therefore the level of output and degree of resolution will be identical for all the Red, Green 
and Blue signals. Compared with Color plate 8, Color plate 9 has three times as many pixels 
horizontally and twice as many vertically, which represents the six times subsampling on a 
Genesis sensor. By comparing the two plates you can see how, with so many more pixels in 
the same area, the impression of stripes is considerably reduced. 
 14.8  Comparative Resolution 
 If you compare Color plate 7, showing Bayer pattern ﬁ ltering, with Color plate 8, showing 
sequential ﬁ ltering, and count the number of color patches something interesting and 
signiﬁ cant is revealed. 
 Remember each of the plates contains the same number of pixels or colored blocks and they 
are the same size. In Color plate 7 with Bayer patterning there are 72 Red pixels, 144 Green 
pixels and 72 Blue pixels. In Color plate 8, which uses sequential patterning, there are 96 Red 
pixels, 96 Green pixels and 96 Blue pixels. What are we to make of these differences? 
 At the end of the day, digital color imagery requires that the complete signal, known as RGB, 
should have the same amount of available information in each of the color signals. So with a 
Bayer patterned image the starting point must be the maximum number of pixels available in 
the Red and Blue image and, somehow, the excess of Green pixels must be reduced to match. If 
you were to take the opposite approach and artiﬁ cially increase the proportion of Red and Blue, 
the image would no longer look true. The results from putting the Bayer pattern image through 
its algorithm will therefore be 72 Red pixels, 72 Green pixels and 72 Blue pixels; this gives 
us a total of 216 pixels for the processed image compared with 288 pixels for the sequentially 
ﬁ ltered image. The sequentially ﬁ ltered image therefore will have one-third more resolution. 
 Does the above matter? You might think so but in reality it doesn’t matter very much. We 
have to return to the cost of producing CCD sequentially ﬁ ltered sensors, which is high 
relative to CMOS Bayer ﬁ ltered sensors. Thus it is not hard to perceive a situation whereby 
the camera manufacturers who wish to use CMOS Bayer sensors can, with only a relatively 
small increase in cost, simply add 33 percent more pixels to their sensor and get back to an 
even playing ﬁ eld with CCD censored cameras and, in the main, this is what they do. 
 You should keep in mind that another utterly crucial matter in the quality of the resultant 
image from a CMOS Bayer sensor is the quality and effectiveness of the algorithm applied to 
the RAW ﬁ le when the excess of Green pixels is compensated for. If this is done well all will 
be well, but even the slightest compromise made here can easily end in disaster further down 
the production process. 

96  Chapter 14
 14.9   Using Sequential Pattern Filtering 
 The disadvantage, as we have seen, of sequential pattern ﬁ ltering is that there is a danger of 
getting interference patterns between the frequency of a pattern on the set and the frequency 
of the pixels on the sensor. The simple answer is to have a much higher pixel count on the 
sensor. As sequential patterned sensors are usually CCD devices and are therefore already 
expensive, substantially increasing the pixel count will put that already considerable cost up 
at what may be an alarming rate. If you can afford to do this then all will be well and you 
should have an excellent image from your camera that gives an RGB output with little or 
no after-processing being needed. This could be a considerable advantage when you get to 
post-production.

CHAPTER 15 
 Data Files  – A Simpliﬁ ed Guide 
 15.1  RAW Data Files, etc. 
 RAW data ﬁ les have only really become an issue since the use of single-chip complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors in moving picture cameras. With cameras 
utilizing three charge-coupled device (CCD) chips the use of RAW data ﬁ les is rarely 
encountered, as by their very nature each of the three chips sends data already encoded as a 
single color, this having been done by the prisms optically splitting the colors, and therefore 
the chip block inherently outputs three distinct signals, Red, Green and Blue. With a Bayer 
patterned CMOS chip things are very different. 
 With a Bayer patterned CMOS chip the exit data stream is really only a monochrome signal, 
each pixel simply sending a value, and in addition to that there is metadata (data about data) 
that tells the ﬁ le which color each pixel has been ﬁ ltered by. As you can imagine, without 
some fairly strong interpolation this stream of data can hardly be looked at as a cogent image 
by most display devices. This may or may not be a problem; let us see. 
 If you are familiar with the use of RAW ﬁ les in the world of still photography you must now 
accept that things are going to be a little different, for downstream from the master image 
the requirements are also different. In the stills world one often manipulates a RAW ﬁ le and 
then ﬁ nally outputs it in a universal format such as JPEG or TIFF or something similar. Here 
the RAW ﬁ le will be considerably bigger than the JPEG or TIFF, as those ﬁ le formats utilize 
some form of compression. In the motion picture world we try to avoid compression as much 
as possible and herein lies the difference. 
  In the motion picture world we would like RGB (Red, Green, Blue) ﬁ les where the three 
primary colors have entirely independent signals, all of them uncompressed. If a RAW 
ﬁ le is manipulated to give the ﬁ nest possible uncompressed RGB ﬁ le then, unlike the 
stills world, the complete three-color RGB ﬁ le will be considerably bigger than the RAW 
ﬁ le as what was simple metadata is now unscrambled and expanded to produce the pure 
RGB ﬁ le. 
 All the above has lead some camera manufacturers to come to the conclusion that it may be 
sensible to keep to RAW ﬁ les within the camera and to ask the downstream computer that 

98  Chapter 15
lives in the cutting room, and runs off mains electricity, to do the interpolation from RAW to 
RGB. They may have a point. 
 Why? Well, look at what happens if your camera inherently starts with RAW ﬁ les after 
the analog-to-digital processor and now has to convert these ﬁ les, within the camera, to a 
full uncompressed RGB ﬁ le. First, there is going to have to be another fairly heavy duty 
processor to add the monochrome data to the metadata and bring all this together as the 
required RGB ﬁ le  – and what will the result be? Considerably more power requirements for 
a start. The camera will already be having a hefty power draw down just to run the analog-
to-digital (A-to-D) converter which, unlike a ﬁ lm camera, must run all the time in order to 
provide a signal for the viewﬁ nder unless you are using an Arriﬂ ex D-21 or a Dalsa that have 
optical viewﬁ nders. Now you must add possibly an even more power hungry RAW to RGB 
translating processor  – even more power required all of the time. If you have added all this 
extra power consumption what will be the ﬁ rst problem with which you now have to deal? A 
great deal of extra heat. Almost certainly a lot more heat than can comfortably be dissipated 
by any external heat sink, so if you previously did not have a fan in your camera you now 
most certainly need one, and if you did have one you now need a bigger one or quite possibly 
more than one. I know of at least one High Deﬁ nition (HD) camera that has three fans. 
 So you put your extra fans in and your two power hungry processors are kept sufﬁ ciently 
cool, but you now have to drag around a much bigger and considerably heavier battery. Job 
done? No! From considerable experience on set I can tell you that you now have one very 
unhappy sound department, for in the background of their lovely dialog there is this continual 
whooshing noise. Now, say you are on a three- or four-camera shoot and that whooshing 
noise is multiplied by the number of cameras. Do you really think that the Producer is going 
to be happy to pay for days and days of automatic dialog replacement (ADR) just because 
the camera designer thought it essential that their CMOS chip camera had to output an RGB 
signal? I think not. 
 Hence the move by many newer camera manufacturers who have chosen to have CMOS 
Bayer patterned sensors in their cameras to record RAW data and let something downstream, 
run on a mains power supply, convert that RAW data to RGB. A small whoosh from a single 
processor in the cutting room has to be preferable to many whooshes on set. 
 Fortunately, in order to obtain a signal from a camera that essentially records RAW data that 
can be interpreted by an electronic viewﬁ nder, things are nothing like as serious as trying to 
provide a recordable RGB signal. 
 One more thing. Although I have talked about RAW ﬁ les things are not quite as simple as 
that. Were they ever? There is no such thing as a universally accepted format for a RAW ﬁ le. 
In the stills world, for instance, Nikon alone have used several RAW ﬁ le formats for various 

Data Files – A Simpliﬁ ed Guide  99
models of their cameras. If you are using a camera that records to RAW ﬁ les it is therefore 
absolutely necessary to check that the post-production workﬂ ow you are intending to use 
can cope really well with exactly the ﬁ le format you will be sending them. I speak from a 
seriously bad experience here when a reputable post house swore it knew what it was doing 
and blamed the onset crew for horrible picture noise in the shadows. It took many days and 
several scarred reputations before they ﬁ nally tried another way of converting the camera’s 
RAW ﬁ les to one their editing suite liked and, miraculously, the noise in the shadows 
disappeared. Strangely, no apology was forthcoming from the post house. No surprises there. 
Be warned and check all is well downstream before you start principal photography. 
 15.2  4:4:4, 4:2:2 and All That 
 I am going to be daring and say 4:4:4 and 4:2:2, and other combinations of numbers, are often 
ﬁ gures bandied about by people in post-production just a little bit to frighten those of us at 
the sharp end where we actually take the pictures and, perhaps, in order to increase the size of 
their invoice. 
 The assumption is that using 4:2:2 may produce a less pure image. However, unless you are 
shooting a movie with heavy post-production involving a lot of CGI etc., this may not be 
relevant, provided you are using a decent camera of almost any make. I can hear howls of 
derision from many quarters, but not from those, like me, who have actually photographed 
any signiﬁ cant number of conventional movies on HD. I have been lucky enough when 
shooting digits that I have always had reasonably good cameras. I am happy to state I have 
never, repeat never, seen any artifacts on my movies relating to any kind of compression. So 
what’s all the fuss about? I have trouble seeing the problem unless you are on one of those 
high CGI movies. 
 Back to 4:4:4. If you are recording in 4:4:4 then the fact is you are recording all the information 
from each of the Red, Green and Blue signals in its entirety. What is important here is that 
the three numbers are equal, denoting equal weight being given to Red, Green and Blue. The 
number 4 is a hangover from the early days of digital video, where the signal was sampled at 
a frequency four times that of the color subcarrier. 1:1:1, 2:2:2, etc. would be equally valid. 
That will be just ﬁ ne and you will have a very pure image. It will also be unlikely that you will 
have a camera you would like to put on your shoulder! Indeed, as far as I know there is no tape 
recorder or video cassette recorder (VCR), that can record totally uncompressed 4:4:4 so you 
will have to be using hard drives or ﬂ ash drives or something that at the present time will be 
expensive, have a short recording time and need that new ﬁ gure  – a Data Wrangler. 
 Alternatively if you see no problem in recording 4:2:2 with some well-thought-out 
compression you could put a camera on your shoulder about the size of, and weighing 

100  Chapter 15
roughly the same as, a 16   mm Arriﬂ ex and it will still happily ﬁ ll that criterion of mine, the 
screen at the Odeon Leicester Square. 
 Now reducing your recorded signal from 4:4:4 to 4:2:2 signiﬁ cantly reduces the amount of 
data you need to record. Let us see how. 
 First, it is important to realize that the three numbers no longer correspond to Red, Green and 
Blue as with 4:4:4. Rather, the ﬁ rst number refers to a signal called Luma. This corresponds 
to the black and white portion of an image and is produced by adding appropriate, ﬁ xed, 
proportions of Red, Green and Blue together. This signal carries not only the brightness 
portion of the image but also the vast majority of the detail, since our eyes are more sensitive 
to changes in brightness than color. The largest component of Luma, some 70 percent, 
is obtained from the Green value. Remembering that we are trying to reduce the amount 
of information used to describe our image, we now form two color-difference signals by 
subtracting both Red and Blue values from Luma. These are the signals describing the 
Chroma or color portion of our image and due to the aforementioned relative insensitivity of 
our eyes to changes in color we can afford to sample them at half the rate of the Luma signal, 
i.e. only analyze them with half of the same accuracy; hence 4:2:2. Note that here the use of 4 
gives us the ability to use 2 rather than end up with unpleasant ratios like 1:1/2:1/2, etc. 
 I am simplifying here but please don’t be offended as I am only trying to give enough 
information for those on set to make some sensible judgements. 
 But how do we get back to our full RGB output? In the post-production environment data 
handling circuits can simply input the 4:2:2 data and take the  “ 4 ” part that is Luma and sum 
it with the  “ 2 ” part that represents Luma minus Red to give a complete Red signal. The same 
goes for Luma minus Blue. It is then straightforward to recover the remaining Green signal. 
What you now have, if all those circuits were designed well enough, is exactly the same three 
signals of Red, Green and Blue that composed the original scene. Believe me, with good 
circuits, it works really well. 
 15.3   Look-up Tables (LUTs) 
 LUT stands for look-up table and I have to say I think it is a poor description of what happens. 
What one is doing when applying an LUT is changing the look of an image into something 
better, more appropriate or more appealing. This is done electronically, usually by adjusting 
gamma, contrast, brightness and saturation, sometimes all together. The LUT is a reference by 
which and by how much each of these parameters is altered for any given circumstance. You 
may, for instance, when starting with a master ﬁ le use a different LUT if you are preparing 
that image to go to television and quite a different LUT if the same image were going to be 
printed out to ﬁ lm. You never actually refer to a table, it is all done quite automatically. 

Data Files – A Simpliﬁ ed Guide  101
 15.4  De-Bayering an Image 
 De-Bayering, on the other hand, requires bespoke algorithms we use to modify the RAW 
image from a Bayer patterned sensor to give a true representation of the original scene. The 
original image will often appear to have very little contrast and be somewhat green. There 
will be parameters for changing gamma, contrast, brightness and saturation that will give a 
correct and pleasing result. This is one solution where the results achieved will be directly 
related to the time and effort put in: the simplest de-mosaic looks less good but is fast in 
pseudo-real time; the best quality requires considerable computational power and time.

CHAPTER 16 
 The Video Tape Recorder (VTR) 
 16.1  The HDCAM Format 
 It is useful to investigate a speciﬁ c format in order to understand how video tape and cassette 
recorders work, and as HDCAM is probably the most used format in the professional 
environment I have chosen to discuss it here. It should be borne in mind, however, that 
virtually all professional video tape recorders (VTRs) and video cassette recorders (VCRs) 
work on very similar principles. Some smaller recording formats lay down and/or encode the 
information in a different manner, but the mechanics of doing so are by and large the same. 
 The HDCAM format writes the information to the tape in exactly the same way whether it is 
recording a Progressive scan or an interlace scan image. Every frame is recorded as a totally 
separate and individual part of the recording. Each picture frame is recorded in 12 diagonal 
stripes across the tape. This, and the phenomenal head to tape speed required to record such a 
huge amount of information, is achieved by using a helical scanning drum (see below). 
 Four playback and record heads are used, with newly introduced signal processing and error 
correction and concealment circuits so powerful that perfect pictures can be recorded and 
replayed even if one of the four heads completely ceases to function. Each frame is laid down 
on to the tape as two separate segments; this must not be confused with the way an interlace 
picture has traditionally been recorded, it is a completely different process. When recording a 
24 frames per second (fps) Progressive scan image, each segment will be laid down in 
one-forty-eighth of a second. This is known as the segmented frame format and is approved 
by the International Television Union (ITU) in its recommendation 709-3. 
 16.2   Helical Scan Recording 
 If the tape were to travel straight past a static recording head, as in a conventional sound-only 
tape recorder, the tape would have to travel at a terriﬁ c speed to be able to record the quantity 
of information being delivered by the recording head. The use of a helical scanning drum 
maintains the required record head to tape speed while dramatically reducing the linear tape 
speed. It does this by wrapping the tape, which is half an inch wide, around more than half 
the circumference of a drum, approximately 3 inches (75  cm) in diameter. As can be seen in 

104  Chapter 16
 Figure 16.1 , the tape is not wrapped around the center of the drum but makes ﬁ rst contact 
at one edge and leaves the drum adjacent to the opposite edge. The tape path has therefore 
described part of a helix, a shape just like a turn on a screw thread, and from this comes the 
term helical scan. This helical wrapping of the tape would not, in itself, increase the record 
head to tape speed but, as the drum is then made to rotate the relative head to tape contact 
speed is dramatically increased. There are four record heads, each halfway between the 
outside edges of the drum and spaced at 90-degree angles around the drum. As the tape is 
wrapped around more than 180 degrees of the drum, and as there are four heads on the drum, 
there will always be at least two heads in contact with the tape. Because the tape is wrapped 
in a helix around the drum, the recording head will, relative to the tape, travel not only along 
the tape but from one edge of the tape to the other. By switching the record heads on and off 
sequentially, strips of recording can be laid down at a shallow angle across the tape, as shown 
in  Figure 16.2 . In addition, there are a series of linear, static, recording heads to lay down 
several control tracks and the time code track.

The Video Tape Recorder (VTR)   105
 In practice the mechanism that performs the above operation is far from simple.  Figure 16.3 
shows the VTR side of a Sony 750P with the side panel removed. What always amazes me 
is how much electronics are carried on the drum and, given that it must remain very light 
weight, how extraordinarily reliable they always prove to be. 
 If you study  Figure 16.4 , where the cassette is loaded and the tape has been wrapped around 
the drum, you may notice two things. First, if you look at the top of the drum, on the 
left-hand side the tape is clearly further away from camera than it is at the top right-hand 
side, thus showing how, with the slight tilt of the drum, the tape is forming a helix around 
the drum. Secondly, you can see that the tape is wrapped more than three-quarters of the way 
around the diameter of the drum, thus ensuring that three of the four record heads on the drum 
will always be in contact with the tape. 
 16.3  Mechanical Considerations 
 If treated with respect, the VTR will give years of unfaltering service. It does, after all, come 
from a ﬁ ne and very reliable lineage  – the Digi Beta camera and before that the Beta SP 
camera. In both these cameras it proved to be very reliable indeed, so it has a ﬁ ne lineage. 
 The drum is so light not just as a contribution to the portability of the camera as a whole, but to 
reduce the inertia associated with spinning the drum at a high speed. This reduction in the inertia 
 Figure 16.3 :   The Sony 750P on-board VTR 

106  Chapter 16
of the drum brings two beneﬁ ts: it can be brought up to operational speed very quickly and will 
consume very little power to keep it spinning. This second factor reduces the drain on the battery 
and therefore indirectly contributes to a reduction in the weight of the on-board battery. 
 16.4   The Drum Lacing Mechanism 
 In order to remove a loop of tape from the cassette and wrap it around nearly three-quarters of 
the drum, the mechanism has ﬁ rst to open the door of the cassette as it enters the door of the 
VTR. Two rollers then come behind the short, straight, length of tape that is free at the mouth 
of the cassette. These rollers then travel round the drum in a circle larger than the diameter of 
the drum but allowing the tape to wrap around the drum. Again, due to weight considerations, 
this mechanism is made of high-quality but very light materials. 
 16.5   Operational Considerations 
 There is little chance of the VTR failing to operate, though there are precautions that should 
be taken. While the cassette door opens by itself it must be closed manually; please do 
this gently but ﬁ rmly. Experience with old and tired SP and Digi Beta cameras leads some 
 Figure 16.4 :  The Sony 750P on-board VTR with the tape loaded  

The Video Tape Recorder (VTR)   107
operators to bang it shut; banging it shut will eventually lead to its having always to be 
banged shut and this is doing no good at all to the mechanisms contained within the VTR.  
 16.6  A Jammed Mechanism 
 Perhaps this is a good moment to mention an invasive operation that one very occasionally 
has to carry out on the camera. The following only applies to the Sony range of HDCAM 
cameras and I include these instructions as Sony cameras and their derivatives, such as the 
Panavision versions, are by far the most common. 
 On the opposite side of the camera to the operator, at the bottom of the camera casing, 
roughly halfway along the camera body, is a rubber plug about a centimeter, or roughly half 
an inch, in diameter. If you remove this plug it reveals a red plastic button with a Philips-type 
cross-head slot in it. Should you have an electrical breakdown such that the camera will not 
unlace the tape and let you remove the cassette you can, with the camera switched off, insert 
a cross-head screwdriver into this button and turn it; at this point make sure you are turning 
it in the direction of the very small arrow on the red plastic button. You can then very, very, 
gently hand crank the lace/unlace mechanism, thus allowing you to retrieve the cassette. 
A warning  – if you turn this button the wrong way you will very likely seriously damage 
the lacing mechanism. The gear ratio is very low, so this will take some time. I have had to 
do this a couple of times and would counsel you to carry out this procedure only as a last 
resort. It is much safer for your tape and your camera if you can get the camera back to the 
supplier, where a more thorough and safer method can be deployed. You should only consider 
this mechanical unlacing of the camera if your rushes on the tape are very important and 
retrieving them is a matter of the greatest urgency.

CHAPTER 17 
 Lighting and Exposing for HD 
 17.1  An HD Camera’s Equivalent ASA Speed, or ISO Rating 
 I check the speed, or sensitivity, of any High Deﬁ nition (HD) camera using the same 
technique I would use when testing a ﬁ lm stock’s ASA (American Standards Association) or 
ISO (International Standards Organization) rating. Note that the numbers will be the same. 
When checking a ﬁ lm stock’s ASA speed, I set the camera up facing an 18 percent reﬂ ectance 
gray card and make a range of exposures, noting the setting on my meter for each one. Then 
I ask the laboratory to make me a middle of the range one-light print. Whichever exposure 
most exactly matches the tonality of the original gray card I deem to be the correct rating for 
that particular ﬁ lm stock. If I use this method and send the test ﬁ lm to the laboratory that will 
be processing the rushes for my forthcoming production, I have reﬁ ned the process to give me 
the ASA rating of that ﬁ lm stock when processed by that laboratory; they all differ slightly. 
 With any HD camera my approach is the same but the technique a little different. I set the 18 
percent gray card up as before and, close by, set up a carefully lined up decent sized monitor, 
preferably a 24-inch monitor. Making sure that the card is evenly lit, I adjust the exposure 
until the gray on the monitor exactly matches the gray of the card; with a 24-inch monitor 
they will even be roughly the same size if they nearly ﬁ ll the screen. Now I take a reading 
of the card with a digital spotmeter and set the reading in the viewﬁ nder on its scale. I then 
adjust the ASA setting on the meter until the aperture shown is the same as that on the lens. 
The ASA setting on the meter is now showing the equivalent ASA speed of the camera. With 
the majority of HD cameras this works out at around 320 or 400 ASA, though as development 
continues I am ﬁ nding cameras ’ sensitivity to be increasing  – so never assume, always check. 
 17.2   Tonal Range 
 There is much discussion as to the length of the tonal range of HD cameras; I have a very 
simple test. Using a Kodak 18 percent Gray Card Plus, which has a black and a white patch 
both sides of the gray ( Figure 17.1 ), I light it evenly to a brightness that gives a perfect 
exposure with the lens set at, say, T 4  – a stop I know works well for this test  – and have 
the image up on a carefully set up large monitor. Without touching the lens setting I now 

112  Chapter 17
reduce the lighting level while watching the monitor and keep on reducing the level until the 
gray area on the card is only fractionally lighter than the black patch next to it. I now take 
a spotmeter reading on the gray area; this will be the lower end of the camera’s tonal range. 
Again, without making any adjustments to the lens, I now increase the lighting level until the 
gray area of the card is again only fractionally darker than the white patch next to it and take 
another reading on the gray area of the card; this will be the upper end of the tonal range. 
The number of stops between the ﬁ rst reading and the second reading is the tonal range. It 
is important in the above test that you have just the very slightest difference in brightness on 
the monitor between both the black and the white patches and the gray area of the card, for 
if they are exactly matched you might be at the limit, or you might be far beyond the limit, 
and you won’t be able to tell, as either situation would look the same on the monitor. Just 
before the limit the camera is still  – just  – recording detail and this point can be thought of as 
deﬁ nitely within the tonal range. 
 Sometimes when I demonstrate this test to colleagues I have to repeat it a second time, as 
they simply cannot believe the result. The tonal range of Sony HDW cameras, for instance, by 
my test is at least 11 stops. Now, those 11 stops are from limit to limit and the characteristics 
of the camera, particularly as I set up the camera, are similar to a ﬁ lm emulsion in that there is 
a straight-line section of linear response over most of the range, but there is a certain amount 
of roll-off at both the extremes of black and white. I have spent some time trying to grasp 
where these roll-offs start and stop; this involved changing lighting levels minutely in the 
stop and a half from pure white to pale gray and at the other end of the scale from pure black 
to dark gray, taking readings with my spotmeter all the while. My conclusion is that you can 
safely work on the basis that there is a nine-stop linear section of tonality with around a stop 
 Figure 17.1 :  The Kodak Gray Card Plus 

Lighting and Exposing for HD   113
of roll-off at each end  –  very like many modern ﬁ lm stocks, which must contribute, in part at 
least, to the pictures from the camera looking so very like ﬁ lm.  
 17.3  Lighting Ratios 
 Many cinematographers, especially those from a ﬁ lm background, are used to thinking 
through a lighting scheme by relating their ideas to the concept of a lighting ratio. A lighting 
ratio is a simple enough thing; it is a number given to the difference in brightness between 
one part of the scene and another. If you have taken readings of two parts of your set and the 
difference between them is one stop, what would be the lighting ratio between them? As it 
requires twice as much light to increase an exposure by one stop, the lighting ratio will be 2. 
If the difference had been two stops the lighting ratio would now be 4. This is because every 
stop increase in brightness doubles the amount of light required and therefore doubles the 
lighting ratio. 
 As we have seen, modern HD cameras can photograph a tonal range around 11 stops, so if 
you refer to Figure 17.2 you will see that the total lighting ratio of, say, a Sony HDW camera 
is 2048 from maximum white to minimum black. Figure 17.2 also shows how the progression 
1   stop difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 2 
2   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 4 
3   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 8 
4   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 16 
5   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 32 
6   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 64 
7   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 128 
8   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 256 
9   stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 512 
10 stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 1024 
11 stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 2048 
12 stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 4096 
13 stops difference in exposure  lighting ratio of 8192 
 Figure 17.2 :  Lighting ratios relating to difference in exposure 

114  Chapter 17
from a single stop of brightness difference, giving the expected lighting ratio of 2, moves 
through the different stops of brightness differential. As we have seen, each change of one 
stop doubles the lighting ratio. 
 If you want your HD pictures to look as much like ﬁ lm as possible, then the lighting ratios 
you choose to use when lighting for HD should be exactly those you would use for ﬁ lm. If a 
ﬁ lm camera can photograph it, so can you with a decent professional HD camera. There is, to 
my mind, however, a more elegant way to light for HD  – light to the monitor. 
 17.4   Lighting to a Monitor 
 If you are about to execute some fairly sophisticated lighting, then I would strongly 
recommend you work to a well set-up 14- or 24-inch monitor. An argument goes that if the 
camera works with 11 stops of tonal range, and even the very best cathode ray tube will be 
hard pressed to display six stops of tonal range, how can you trust the monitor? Well you can. 
Both the camera and the monitor have within them circuits to subtly squeeze all the camera’s 
ability into a shorter range with sufﬁ cient cleverness that the human eye/brain combination, 
when looking at a high-grade monitor, will believe it is seeing the full 11 stops of tonal range 
in a perfectly natural way. Believe me, it works. I have lit several pictures using HD now and 
have always lit to the monitor using my exposure meter for nothing more than lining up the 
monitor’s contrast level and, in whatever medium they were eventually displayed, the pictures 
were always exactly as I expected them to be. There is a great joy in working to a monitor; 
it is very like painting  – instead of doing mathematics while staring down a spotmeter I am 
freed to, quite literally, paint with light. Every mark I make on the set will instantly appear on 
my canvas, the monitor’s screen. It is hard to describe the freedom I felt when I ﬁ rst started 
working this way; it was very liberating. Instant gratiﬁ cation I suppose. 
 17.5   Highlights and Shadows 
 There is a misconception that blames  “ video ” for the poorer handling of highlights than ﬁ lm 
in some circumstances and with some cameras. It is not the image being recorded on video 
that is the inﬂ uencing factor, but the fact that you are working with a positive image rather 
than a negative one. Those of you who have shot reversal ﬁ lm or still transparency will be 
familiar with a similar image, one where the shadows seem to look after themselves more 
than when using a negative/positive process, but where more care must be taken with the 
highlights, and so it is with any video camera  – they shoot a positive image. So whereas with 
ﬁ lm you would probably spend more time reading the shadows with your meter to establish 
that they will be recorded just as you wish, you must get into the habit with HD of walking 
back to the monitor and checking your highlights ﬁ rst.  

Lighting and Exposing for HD   115
 17.6  Exposure 
 17.6.1  Using a Monitor 
 There is an absolutely sure-ﬁ re way of getting your exposure spot on. Light the set by eye 
and, when you have all your keys, cross lights and backlights to your liking, walk back 
to your monitor and with one hand on the lens aperture ring adjust it until you think your 
highlights are perfect – to my mind that will be when they have just a little information in 
them. Now complete your lighting by adding your ﬁ ll light until you are equally happy with 
the shadow detail and then check those highlights once more, as some of that ﬁ ll may well 
have added brightness to your highlights. How could it be simpler? 
 17.6.2  Using a Meter 
 On the other hand, I had one colleague, let us say he was of the old school, who was 
about to shoot a picture with a young director. I had spent some time with this Director of 
Photography (DP) explaining HD and he was very enthusiastic about the picture quality and 
how the cost savings might allow more young directors to get their ﬁ lms made. He may be 
old school but he is certainly not against progress. After much thought he confessed to me he 
hated monitors so much that even when shooting ﬁ lm he refused to look at the video assist. 
What was he going to do? I assured him that the camera was very stable in its equivalent 
ASA speed and he could safely assume that the camera he was going to use had an equivalent 
speed of 320 ASA to tungsten light, we had checked, and if he lit with his exposure meters 
in his usual fashion all would be well, and it was. The young director came back at the end 
of the picture and expressed the opinion that the DP must be a genius for the pictures were 
terriﬁ c, but he had done it without once looking at a monitor! How times change. 
 So here are two very different approaches to exposure control; both work perfectly so use 
whatever works for you. I will be sticking to my monitor, for me that is much more fun. 
 17.6.3  Auto Exposure 
 Most HD zoom lenses intended for broadcast use have a side handle much like traditional 
video lenses, on which there is usually both a button and a sliding switch associated with 
exposure. The sliding switch normally has two positions, auto and manual. If left on auto 
the camera will continuously adjust the exposure to its own liking. If set to manual you can 
simply grab the iris ring and set it to your preference, or if you press the button on the hand 
grip it will give you a one-time-only auto exposure, which might be a very good starting point 
for making your own assessment. To my mind most video cameras tend to overexpose when 
set to auto, which is curious as this will exacerbate the video, or positive image, highlights 
problem. There is a page in the menu on many cameras, certainly Sony HDW cameras, where 

116  Chapter 17
you can give the auto exposure control a bias and I tend to set this to reduce the exposure by 
around one-third of a stop. 
 Panavision Digital Primos and Zeiss Digi Primes do not have a handle on the lens, and neither 
do many  “ ﬁ lm-style ” lenses from other manufacturers, so with these lenses you will have to 
work to the monitor or use an exposure meter in the traditional way. 
 17.6.4  Exposing Using a Waveform Monitor 
 Before I describe how to use a waveform monitor I must confess I am not a fan of it. On the 
two occasions I was persuaded to have one on set I thought my lighting was not as brave as it 
normally is; the waveform monitor was making me more cautious. I understand what it does 
and respect those that like using it, but it is deﬁ nitely not for me. 
 On the screen of a waveform monitor you will see a graph where the vertical component is 
the signal level and the horizontal component is the position across the width of the scene. It 
is not a single line graph, for it is ﬁ lled in with the energy levels of the vertical components of 
the picture. 
 There are two horizontal lines on the screen, one near the top and one near the bottom, 
which represent the voltages of peak white and peak black. The general idea is to adjust your 
lighting and exposure to keep the highlights under the top line on the screen and the shadows 
above the bottom line on the screen. One tends to come to think that any part of the display 
that is outside these limits must be an error. This is not necessarily so. 
 When I am lighting for ﬁ lm I am conscious that some parts of the scene will be too bright, 
and some too dark, to have detail in them. Knowing which parts of the scene will exceed 
the ability of the ﬁ lm stock and handling them in an artistic way is part of my craft. If I am 
lighting in the same manner I know I can ignore the top and bottom lines on the screen of the 
waveform monitor, but for some reason that is psychologically very hard to do. 
 It is particularly distressing when you have a beautiful picture on the monitor and someone 
with too little knowledge spies your waveform monitor and expresses the opinion that you are 
overexposed because a few spikes go above the top line or even ﬂ atten out. So, for me at least, 
the waveform monitor stays back in the stores. 

117
CHAPTER 18 
 Setting the Color Balance 
 18.1  White Balance 
 If you are using a Sony HDW camera there are three positions for the switch on the side 
of the camera that determine which form and setting of white balance you are using. Most 
professional High Deﬁ nition (HD) cameras will have similar controls so I will describe those 
on the Sony here. The positions are labeled Preset, A and B. With the switch at Preset the 
camera will set the white balance to its own internal setting. You can create your own white 
balance on position A or B by switching to them and operating the white balance switch on 
the front of the camera. 
 18.2   What is White Balance? 
 Most digital video cameras are set up to show a color correct image when the scene is lit with 
tungsten light, but not all, so check the situation with the camera you are using. The RED 
One, for instance, has a native color balance of 5000 K but can be programmed for the two 
more conventional settings of 3200 and 5600 K. 
 With the Sony HDW cameras the nearer of the two ﬁ lter wheels to the camera body, situated 
just above the lens mount and on the operator side of the camera, contains three ﬁ lters and 
a clear glass. With the clear glass in place, the overall effect is to make the camera have 
the same color balance as tungsten balanced ﬁ lm. The other positions give various color 
corrections, the values of which are shown in  Figure 18.1 . This wheel places a colored ﬁ lter 
between the lens and the image splitter block, much as one would put, say, a Wratten 85 ﬁ lter 
in front of a ﬁ lm camera lens in order to have the correct color balance when shooting under 
daylight with tungsten balanced ﬁ lm. Curiously, Sony correct to a slightly warmer color more 
akin to using a Wratten 85B on a ﬁ lm camera. This often looks very pleasing but corrects to 
6300 K, not a commonly used value. The cross ﬁ lter has no effect on color. It is the equivalent 
of a light four-point star ﬁ lter. I have no idea why Sony incorporated this ﬁ lter as I have only 
ever used it twice and always have a couple of light star ﬁ lters in my ﬁ lter kit anyway. More 
recent Sony cameras are beginning to appear with the star ﬁ lter replaced by one correcting the 
color balance to 5600 K, a very welcome change in my opinion. 

118  Chapter 18
 18.3   Neutral Density (ND) Filters 
 On the Sony HDW cameras the ﬁ lter wheel farthest from the camera body deploys four ﬁ lters 
that have no effect on color but only affect exposure. The value of these ﬁ lters is shown in 
 Figure 18.2 . 
 18.4   A Warning! 
 On the Sony cameras, with the exception of zero ND and the star ﬁ lter, each position on both 
the ND and the color correction wheels will have an independent white balance written to it. 
This means that if you have white balanced at zero ND and you swing the ﬁ lter to an ND 0.6 
you will now have the last white balance setting you made when you used an ND 0.6 ﬁ lter. 
This function can be switched off in the internal menus. 
 18.5   Setting the White Balance Using a White Card 
 Having chosen the ﬁ lter in the ﬁ lter wheel that most accurately reﬂ ects the light you are 
working under, select either position A or B on the Preset selector if using a Sony camera 
or the similar control on the camera you are using, ﬁ ll at least 70 percent of the screen area 
with a white card or paper that is illuminated by the primary source of light you are working 
under and press the white balance switch on the front of the camera. The following applies 
to virtually all digital cameras when carrying out a white balance. In just a couple of seconds 
you should see in the viewﬁ nder  “ White Balance OK ” . The camera has now electronically 
given you the best possible color balance for the conditions you are working under. Until you 
make another white balance on the A or B setting you have chosen, the camera will always 
give you the same color set-up every time you switch to your chosen position. 
Position A    Cross Filter 
Position B    Balanced for 3200 °K 
Position C    Balanced for 4300 °K 
Position D    Balanced for 6300 °K

Setting the Color Balance  119
 It is important that you have a correct exposure when you carry out a white balance as the camera 
is set up to make the correction in this mode, otherwise you may get a message in the viewﬁ nder 
telling you the brightness is too low or too high and the balance will not have been set. 
 Be careful what white card or paper you use to white balance. Ofﬁ ce papers that are 
sometimes called “ high white ” or something similar are, in fact, tinted a little blue to give 
them a whiter appearance and this may affect your white balance. If you use one of these 
papers you may ﬁ nd your scene looking a little warmer than you expected. This can be 
attractive but you need to be aware it is happening. Keeping a piece of good white art card 
with you is a much safer option. 
 18.6  Setting the White Balance Using a Colored Card 
 One way to make any video camera show an image that does not have the same color cast as the 
original scene is to white balance to a card or paper that is not white. I don’t use white balance 
very often but should you, perhaps, wish to warm up the overall look of a scene you might 
white balance to a pale blue card. The white balance process will remove the blue from the set-
up and the overall result will be warmer by the same factor as the card was cool. The reverse is 
true if you use a pink card; the result will be cooler as the pink will have been removed. 
 Green and yellow, or indeed any color, can be used in this way and the result will be a color 
change diametrically opposed to the color of the card you are using. I ﬁ nd colors other 
than pink and blue of very little use unless I still have a green cast from ﬂ uorescent lights 
after doing a standard white balance, when balancing again to a very pale green card can 
sometimes help. 
 You can easily obtain pastel-colored thin card in almost any color from art shops; they usually 
come in large sheets but are not expensive and easily cut to standard ofﬁ ce paper size. I 
always carry a folding clipboard with me in which I keep my colored cards, several white 
cards in case they get dirty, and my star chart for setting the back focus. As the clipboard 
has a folding cover, it keeps everything clean and dry, and can easily be folded backwards 
so that it can be propped up if I am white balancing or setting my back focus when on my 
own. If you choose to use a cover like this, make sure you use a black one. When the paper 
is clipped to it some of the folder will be in shot; the color of the folder may then affect the 
white balance. I say this from experience as my ﬁ rst folder was red and it took me some time 
to work out why my white balance always looked a little cool. We can all be fooled! 
 18.7  Setting the White Balance Under Fluorescent Lighting 
 With any digital camera I rarely use the white balance facility, for I prefer to stay on Preset 
and occasionally use ﬁ lters as if I were ﬁ lming. The exception to this rule is when I am 

120  Chapter 18
ﬁ lming under ﬂ uorescent light. Here I ﬁ nd the best way to white balance is, having checked 
all the ﬂ uorescent tubes are the same make and speciﬁ cation, to take the white card quite 
close to a tube and balance it there. This is to make sure that no spurious light that may have 
picked up some other color from reﬂ ection off another surface is being allowed to inﬂ uence 
the setting. 
 18.8   The Outer Filter Wheel on a Sony HDW Camera 
 The ﬁ lter wheel farthest from the camera body on a Sony HDW camera has no effect on 
color; again, it has a straight-through position with the other three positions having ND ﬁ lters 
of varying strength in them. Many other cameras have the capability to employ ND ﬁ lters. 
Most HD cameras have an ND switch somewhere reasonably obvious and to hand. This is to 
allow you to keep the lens working at a reasonably wide aperture when ﬁ lming under bright 
light. At ﬁ rst glance you might think that using as small an aperture as possible, and thereby 
getting a great depth of ﬁ eld, would be a good idea. After all, in these circumstances keeping 
focus would hardly be difﬁ cult. This is not always a good thing for two reasons. First, some 
lenses do not perform at their best at very large apertures; the Panavision Primos, Zeiss Digi 
Primes and Cooke S4s and a few other lenses are an exception to this rule, as often they 
are at their best at the wide end of the aperture range. Secondly, one thing that most ﬁ lm 
people dislike about video is that everything seems sharp and it is impossible to separate the 
foreground from the background using discriminatory focus. Deploying these ND ﬁ lters can 
overcome both these problems. 
 18.9   Black Balance 
 Black balance is primarily used to reset the voltage at which an image signal reaches the 
lowest point the camera or the recording format can cope with. This can change for a variety 
of reasons, a change in temperature of the circuitry, for example. It is therefore very important 
to maintain the system’s ability to record the best possible black available; operating the black 
balance should do this. 
 With the Sony HDW cameras, pushing the same switch as is used for white balance in the 
opposite direction operates the black balance. It is worth familiarizing yourself with how 
black balance works on the camera you are using. With any HD camera you should black 
balance the camera ﬁ rst thing every morning and whenever you change the position of 
the gain switch on the camera. It is also a wise precaution to carry out a black balance if 
the camera has experienced a large change in temperature, though this is probably being 
hyper-cautious. 

121
CHAPTER 19 
 Camera Checks Before Shooting 
 Unlike starting a ﬁ lm shoot, where there are clearly deﬁ ned checks on the camera equipment 
that have to be made, many of them required by the picture insurance company, for High 
Deﬁ nition (HD) with less than 10 years of existence things are not so simple. So far I know of 
no formal checking procedure for a digital camera. For a ﬁ lm camera one might include the 
following: 
 1.  Check every lens comes up to the focus scale engraved on it correctly. 
 2.  Check that all long focus lenses go past inﬁ nity so that they can make inﬁ nity with 
several glass ﬁ lters on.  
 3.  Run ﬁ lm through the camera using every magazine and check for scratching. 
 4.  Run a steady test on every camera body. 
 5.  Make an accurate check that the camera runs precisely to speed at all the frame rates you 
expect to use. 
 6.  Again, check for scratching on all magazines at the highest frame rate you expect to use. 
 A good camera crew in the days before photography starts on a ﬁ lm would consider the 
above only the beginning  – they would run between 20 and 30 checks before even thinking of 
putting that camera kit on a movie. 
 But we can’t run most of these checks on a digital camera so what are we to do? I am not sure 
but what follows is a list of checks I would like my crew to carry out. Most of them I put here 
as a result of problems I have had in the past  – so be warned! 
 19.1  The Camera Body 
 19.1.1  Menus 
 You need to check the menus sequence properly and you understand that sequence. Sony are 
notorious for changing the order of the pages in the menus and they are not alone. 

122  Chapter 19
● 
 Check the lens mount works and is clean and does not stick. I once managed to 
drop a  £ 60,000 lens because the lens mount was stiff and suddenly gave way. I can’t 
tell you how glad my assistant was that I dropped it and not he! The manufacturer 
modiﬁ ed the lens mount shortly afterwards, which is my feeble excuse. 
● 
 Check  all the switches on the camera body work reliably. 
● 
 Check that Time Code and User Bits, if they apply to your camera, are running and 
can be set reliably. 
● 
 Check that all handles and accessories are ﬁ rmly ﬁ xed to the camera body. I know 
this seems obvious but I have seen a camera nearly hit the ﬂ oor because a simple 
screw was not tight enough. 
 19.2   Lenses 
 This may seem stupid but about once a year I ﬁ nd a lens that rattles. That means that at least 
one element in it is not ﬁ rmly ﬁ xed where it should be. If this happens to you reject the lens 
immediately. 
● 
 Check that all the lenses will hit inﬁ nity and that the longer ones will go past inﬁ nity. 
You will need this because if you put several glass ﬁ lters on a long lens they bring the 
focus forward and if you only had inﬁ nity with the basic lens you will not get it at all 
with ﬁ lters attached. 
● 
 Check whether you are using ﬁ lm-style lenses or broadcast lenses. If using ﬁ lm-style 
lenses you will need to measure focus from the datum point on the camera that is the 
notional ﬁ lm plane. If you are using broadcast lenses there will probably be a green 
ring around the lens somewhere near the front. If there is, this is from where you 
measure focus. 
● 
 Check all front and back elements are scrupulously clean.  
● 
 Check that all the lens mounts go easily onto all your camera bodies and that they are 
clean and undamaged. 
 And that’s only the beginning! 
 19.3   Electronic Checks 
 This is where it gets really tricky! You can’t just check for scratching as with a ﬁ lm camera 
and it can be very hard indeed to see, even on a Grade 1 monitor, defects that may show up in 
post-production. But it is your duty to try. 

Camera Checks Before Shooting  123
 19.3.1  Dead Pixels 
 A huge number of cameras out in the ﬁ eld have a few dead pixels. Most of these cameras 
handle this situation very well and if they have handled it well you can discount the problem 
from your shoot. But , if your camera has some dead pixels that have not been dealt with, you 
need to ﬁ nd them. 
 Finding out if your camera has pixels that are dead and may be recorded is, fortunately, not too 
difﬁ cult. Cap your lens or put the lens port blank into the camera so that no light whatsoever 
can enter the throat of the camera. Now wind the gain on your camera up to its maximum. 
With a high-grade monitor plugged in look for any bright spots on the screen  – pixels most 
often die on so they will glow bright. If you have any bright spots reject the camera. 
 19.3.2  Ringing  – Or Whatever the Manufacturer Calls It 
 This is a very curious effect that can rarely be seen on a location monitor but, if you have 
been unlucky enough to have a camera with this problem, it may only become apparent 
somewhere down the post-production route, often quite late in the process. 
 What is happening is that somewhere in the camera’s circuitry there is an error occurring 
that is something like an electronic echo and this will, most often, show up as a very low 
intensity second image of the scene, more often than not displaced to the right of the original 
image. You need to do your best to check if you have this problem. If you are in the slightest 
bit suspicious for heaven’s sake shoot some tests and send them to your post house where, in 
ideal conditions, they should be able to make a ﬁ nite judgement. You are very unlikely to be 
sure if you have this problem on set, believe me. 
 The best empirical check you can do is to set up a relatively low-key scene of a very even tone 
with one clearly deﬁ ned patch at a brightness roughly halfway between white and black, that is 
a mid to light gray, and set it right in the middle of the picture. Now look left and right and see if 
you can see a very low level secondary image of the brighter area. If you think you can, reject the 
camera body. I once had this problem and no one spotted it on set. It only came to light after the 
picture was cut and going into grading. Only a small percentage of the cut picture was affected 
but I am told it cost  £ 30,000 in post to remove the echo! It is a rare but potentially costly problem. 
 19.4  Temperature 
 With an increasing trend to solid-state recording, or the use of hard drives, both of which are 
inherently quieter than a tape transport mechanism, some camera manufacturers are being 
tempted to try and build their cameras without any cooling fans at all, thus making them 
totally silent. If they provide a sufﬁ ciently large and efﬁ cient heat sink, as in the Arriﬂ ex D-21, 

124  Chapter 19
then things should be ﬁ ne. On the other hand, if heat dissipation is not handled really well it 
can lead to cameras tripping their protection switches or crashing the internal processors – not 
something you want to happen in the middle of a shoot. 
 I would therefore suggest that if you have the slightest suspicion that the model of camera 
you are using is prone to overheating or even has a reputation for doing so then there is a 
simple check you can carry out. On your ﬁ rst test day build the camera as soon as possible 
and add all the electrically driven accessories you are likely to be using during the shoot and 
then leave the camera running for the rest of the day, including over lunch. This should not be 
inconvenient as you can still carry out all the tests you need with the camera switched on. If it 
has no problems by the end of the day you are probably OK. 
 19.5   Matching Cameras 
 I have photographed a number of three- or four-camera shoots and it is rare that all the 
cameras match precisely. So long as the differences are minimal and you are aware of them 
this is hardly a problem. Solving the problem completely is next to impossible, which is one 
reason why in television studios and outside broadcasts there is a control room, often known 
as  “ racks ” , where an engineer sits with complete remote control over all the cameras, with a 
picture monitor and a waveform monitor together with a vector scope so that the output from 
each camera is tuned, such that before the signal enters the control room all the pictures look 
the same. Coming from a ﬁ lm background I would hate to work this way, so I have to devise 
strategies to overcome the tiny differences in the cameras ’ outputs. 
 The most often encountered difference between cameras is in exposure. This rarely amounts 
to more than a quarter of a stop, so my solution is simple. Rather than remember, or ask the 
crew on that camera to remember, the difference we simply put a small piece of tape over 
the datum point on that camera’s lens next to the aperture ring, line all the cameras up so that 
they exactly match and then mark a new datum point where that lens matches the setting on 
the other cameras. Simple and effective. 
 If you ﬁ nd a noticeable difference in one camera’s color balance or contrast then I suggest 
you change that camera immediately. If this is not possible then rather, as I prefer, running 
all the cameras on a preset white balance you may try simultaneously white balancing all the 
cameras. The word simultaneously is most important in the above. On the occasions I have 
resorted to this ploy we were very careful to light a perfect white card very evenly and pull 
all the cameras back from it so that they would all be on as near the same optical axis as was 
possible. I do exactly the same thing when on multicamera ﬁ lm shoots but then I shoot an 
18 percent gray card so that the laboratory can grade all the camera’s rushes (dailies) to the 
same card. If I am going down this road I insist on a white balance ﬁ rst thing every morning, 
immediately after all the cameras have had a black balance.

 19.6  Matching Lenses 
 If you have all your lenses from the same manufacturer, and I strongly suggest you do, then 
this is hardly likely to be a problem. Sony and some other manufacturers do have pages in the 
camera’s menus where you can set different parameters for each lens you will be using. 
I have only known one production where this facility was deployed and it took a considerable 
amount of time and at the end of all that work I confess I could see no discernible difference 
even on a Grade 1 24-inch monitor. 
 Trying to match lenses in this way is something I have never found to be a particular problem. 
 19.7  Lens Vignetting 
 Virtually every lens known to man vignettes, though it is very unlikely you will ever be 
conscious of this. I believe this is a good thing and let me tell you why. When my hobby was 
taking and printing exhibition-quality black and white prints, during the printing process I would 
arrange for the outside 5 or 10 percent of the image to be given an extra 10 percent exposure. 
Nobody ever saw this but it is well known  – read Ansel Adams ’ books  – that this effect helps 
draw the viewer’s eye into the picture where the most important parts of the image usually 
reside. You can do this in post but you will spend quite a lot of time and money in your grading 
suite doing this for the whole picture, for it is not a global thing; light and dark scenes will need 
a different approach and scenes of distinctly different color values will need treating differently. 
 The vignetting inherent in a lens is far, far, less than 10 percent. It comes about because the 
distance from the back of the lens to the center of the image is smaller than the distance from 
the back of the lens to the outside edges of the image and therefore there is just a little more 
fall-off in brightness at the edges. You can hardly ever see it, but I strongly believe if it is well 
below the observable limit it makes the picture more pleasing and easier to read  – just as it 
did on my black and white prints. 
 I have only ever known one production dial out this vignetting inside the camera’s menu and 
that was because, they claimed, that they were going to be doing so many layers of CGI that 
it might interfere with the post-production process. That production spent two weeks with 
laptops plugged into the back of the cameras just getting a perfect match and I, for one, could 
never see the difference. 
 19.8  What Does It All Mean? 
 If you are looking at a ﬁ rst-class monitor, you can see no problems and you have checked out 
all your kit as well as you can, you should be just ﬁ ne. Remember Wheeler’s First Law, which 
states: if it looks right, it is right!

CHAPTER 20 
 Lenses
 20.1  How to Choose a Lens 
 There are many parameters that deﬁ ne a good lens and separate a good lens from a bad one. 
For High Deﬁ nition (HD) cinematography, where there is a mixture of both ﬁ lm and video 
backgrounds, the most important include resolution (i.e. what is the smallest dot in the scene 
that can accurately be recorded?), contrast (does the lens have a short, hard tonal range or a 
long, gentle one?), color rendition (this breaks down into two separate parameters: the overall 
color hue of the image and edge fringing) and, ﬁ nally, breathing (which describes the effect 
of an image size change when the lens focus is racked). 
 20.1.1  Resolution 
 There are many ways to deﬁ ne the resolution of a lens but the simplest is to consider the same 
parameter that is used to compute depth of ﬁ eld charts, the circle of confusion. The circle 
of confusion does not exist until we choose it. Typically for 35  mm cinematography using 
spherical lenses a circle of confusion of 1/1000 of an inch, or 25 microns (25   μ m) is used and 
this remains current when using a single-chip HD camera with a chip size approximating the 
area of the 35  mm ﬁ lm frame. 
 Before we go any further let us deﬁ ne a circle of confusion. The correct circle of confusion is 
the diameter of the largest dot on the recorded image that will still look sharp to the audience 
in the most taxing presentation venue in which that picture will ever be shown. The principle 
is that if you try to photograph an inﬁ nitely small dot, how large would you allow that dot to 
grow as it becomes less well focused on the image plane and at what size will it appear to the 
audience to be out of focus? 
 If you are going to show your images in a large cinema, say in a capital city, this will be a 
very taxing presentation on the parameter of resolution. As we have seen in Chapter 10, in 
Section 10.5, for regular 35  mm cinematography 1/1000 inch (25  μ m) is considered adequate. 
Next we must consider the difference in recorded image size between the 35   mm frame and 
the area of a 2/3-inch HD image chip camera. The 35  mm frame is 2 1/2 times larger than the 
HD chip, so for a dot on the HD chip to seem to be as sharp on the same cinema screen as 

128  Chapter 20
one projected from a 35  mm print it must be 2 1/2 times smaller, that is 1/2500 inch or 10   μ m. 
There are only a few lenses that can achieve this. 
 20.1.2  Contrast 
 This is a difﬁ cult subject, for perceived resolution  – that is, how our eye/brain combination 
assesses sharpness  – can be materially affected by the contrast of the image. A very contrasty 
lens might give you a picture on even a 24-inch HD monitor that looks very sharp, but if that 
image is expanded to a large cinema screen the lack of resolution that has been masked by the 
excessive contrast will now be very apparent. 
 20.1.3  Perceived Sharpness with Regard to Contrast 
 The eye/brain combination perceives sharpness quite differently from the way we might 
measure resolution on a lens-testing bench. Perception is an impossible thing to measure yet 
we, as cinematographers, need to get a grasp of how our audience will see our work and need 
to know if they will consider our pictures to be sharp. 
 Increasing the contrast of a scene will, most likely, increase the perceived sharpness of the 
scene. That said, it might also reduce the artistic value of the scene or even take it away 
from the cinematographer’s initial concept of the scene as represented in the script. A 
cinematographer might wish to show a scene with a reasonably high resolution but having a 
gentle, low-key, feel to it. To do this the cinematographer needs lenses that have a very long 
tone range and a gentle contrast but still appear sharp. 
 Let us look at some of the sharpness we perceive in a scene as against the actual resolution 
of the image. In  Figure 20.1 we have two nearly identical images; don’t study them too 
carefully, but at a glance which do you think is the sharper? I would guess you chose the 
bottom one. Wrong! All the images for this example were taken on my Nikon CoolPix 
camera; the top picture was downloaded at 300 dots per inch (DPI) and the lower picture at 
75 DPI  – the difference is the top picture has a much lower contrast than the bottom picture; 
contrast has fooled you into thinking the resolution is higher when the contrast is higher. 
 Now look at  Figure 20.2 . Which do you think is sharper here? I guess you will again choose 
the bottom picture. Both pictures were downloaded at 300 DPI. Again it is the contrast of the 
bottom picture that makes it look sharper. 
 Don’t look at  Figure 20.3 until you are holding the book at arm’s length and then try and 
decide which picture is sharper. My guess is you will think they both look the same. Now 
bring the book to your normal reading distance, normally 10 inches or 25 centimeters; if you 
look at the top of the gate you should see a jagged line in the bottom picture but a true and 
straight one in the top picture. Both pictures have exactly the same contrast but the top picture 

Lenses  129
has a resolution of 300 DPI and the bottom a resolution of 75 DPI proving, I hope, that 
viewing distance is also a critical factor. 
 The conclusion from all this is that a lens that appears sharp may not be, so it is therefore 
important that you measure resolution and judge contrast – separately.

 20.1.4  Color Rendition 
 20.1.4.1  Overall color bias 
 All makes of lenses tend to have an individual character: some are cold and clinical, some are 
warm and gentle and some are utterly neutral. Most of the time my own preference is for a 
neutral lens, for I can then add the character I require scene by scene with the aid of ﬁ ltration. 
 Figure 20.2:    The effect of contrast 

Lenses  131
 Perhaps the simplest way to discover the difference in color bias between different 
manufacturers ’ lenses is to mount them on the camera and line them up at the standard 18 
percent gray card we use in the ﬁ lm world. Fill most of the frame with the card and set the 
correct exposure. Having ﬁ rst lined up the monitor correctly, can you now see any color 
difference between the card and its corresponding image on the monitor? You should easily 
be able to tell the difference between warm, cold and neutral lenses using this simple test. 
 Figure 20.3:  The effect of resolution and contrast 

132  Chapter 20
 20.1.4.2  Color fringing 
 This is a phenomenon almost unheard of with any lens from the ﬁ lm world built in the 
last 30 years. Unfortunately it is all too commonly found on even some of the most recent 
video lenses. The reason is twofold: ﬁ rst, the ﬁ lm Director of Photography (DP) is used to 
paying considerably more for lenses than the equivalent video cameraperson, so there are the 
ﬁ nancial resources available to ﬁ lm lens manufacturers to design out the problem; secondly, 
until the advent of HD a video image was very rarely shown on a big screen and consequently 
the problem was not immediately evident on a normal size television screen, though it can 
nearly always be detected if you look closely. 
 20.1.4.3  What is fringing? 
 If you look closely at a hard edge on a picture on a television screen and ﬁ nd that it is not 
totally pure but there appear to be single or multiple colored lines around it, this is fringing. It 
is caused by the lens being unable to bring all the colors in the visible spectrum into focus at 
exactly the same place. 
 For HD cinematography a lens showing even the slightest hint of fringing must not be accepted. 
 20.1.5  Breathing 
 Breathing is when the image size changes when the lens focus is changed. It is very common 
indeed with most lenses used for television video camcorders and almost unheard of with ﬁ lm 
lenses. Again, the acceptable cost of the lenses is the main contributing factor. A DP working 
in ﬁ lm is very unlikely to accept a lens that shows even the slightest sign of breathing, but a 
news cameraman using a camcorder where the image is moving much of the time will hardly 
notice the effect. 
 Unfortunately there are a number of lenses purporting to have been designed speciﬁ cally 
for HD, most of them coming from established video lens manufacturers, that show not just 
slight but considerable breathing. This to me is wholly unacceptable. 
 20.2   Setting the Back Focus 
 Setting the back focus is a requirement for all professional 2/3-inch three-chip cameras; it is 
not required in any way on single-chip cameras. Three-chip cameras require it for a number 
of reasons, the most likely being the difference in contraction and expansion rates between 
the three glass elements of the color splitter block and the metals of the lens mounts in the 
camera and on the lens itself. 
 The back focus should be checked ﬁ rst thing every morning, every time you change a lens 
and if there has been a signiﬁ cant change in temperature since you last carried out a check. 

Lenses  133
 Conventional wisdom suggests that one uses a star chart very like the one I prefer, which is 
illustrated in Figure 20.4 . 
 20.2.1  Zoom Lenses 
 1.  Set the lighting to give a correct exposure with the lens wide open. It is quite acceptable 
to deploy the neutral density (ND) ﬁ lter wheel to achieve this. 
 2.  Put a star chart ( Figure 20.4 ) at around 6 feet, or 2 meters, away from the camera. 
 3.  Zoom right in and focus the lens in the normal way. If you can possibly do so, check all 
the focus adjustments on a monitor, with the chroma taken out, so you have a black and 
white picture. 
 4.  Adjust the lens to wide angle and rotate the back focus ring until the star chart looks 
sharp.
 5.  Zoom in and adjust the lens focus. 
 6.  Zoom out and adjust the back focus.

 7.   Repeat steps 5 and 6 until no further improvements can be made. 
 8.  Lock the back focus ring. 
 9.  Run through steps 5 and 6 again to check the back focus ring did not move when you 
locked it. 
Note: You may have to go through steps 5 and 6 several times before the focus is correct at 
both ends of the zoom without any refocusing being necessary. 
 20.2.2  Prime Lenses 
 Set up whichever chart you prefer at a convenient distance that is marked on the lens scale 
and measure this distance very carefully; now set the lens to this mark  – this should be no 
closer than the minimum focus plus 6 inches. Remember that “ ﬁ lm-style ” lenses measure 
from the notional ﬁ lm plane  – where the Green chip is with 2/3-inch cameras  – and it is 
totally different if you are using a broadcast lens; there should be a green ring somewhere 
around the front focusing barrel of the lens. With a broadcast lens the green ring is where 
you run the tape from, not the notional focal plane. If you are taping focus this is also true 
of broadcast zoom lenses. Now adjust the back focus so as to produce the sharpest image 
possible. Now lock the back focus ring while very carefully trying not to move it. As a further 
precaution now focus the lens on the chart; if it comes up to scale all is well, if it does not 
something is wrong  – almost certainly you inadvertently moved the back focus ring when 
locking it and I am afraid you need to start the whole procedure again. 
 All the lenses should have their back focus checked before you go out on a shoot. You owe 
yourself the conﬁ dence boost of knowing all was perfect when you started. 
 20.3   Focusing the Lens Using Back Focus Charts  – Beware! 
 Before you can successfully focus any lens on a 2/3-inch three-chip HD camera you must 
have assured yourself that the back focus is correct. You may be tempted to use a star chart 
as shown in  Figure 20.4 as a target when carrying out eye focuses at various distances  – this 
is unwise. A star chart works perfectly for setting the back focus at 6 feet or 2 meters, but 
although it looks like a perfect image to focus on for, say, an actor’s position, experience has 
proved this not to be the case. I once had a phone call from a crew complaining that one of 
the Panavision Primo Digital zooms they had with them was not focusing to scale. The lens 
was immediately swapped out and, following up the call, I put it on the lens test bench; it 
focused very accurately to scale and the deﬁ nition was above speciﬁ cation, so what was going 
wrong? I telephoned the unit and found that, quite sensibly as things stood at that time, they 
were using the star chart as a focus aid when making eye focus checks through the lens. The 

Lenses  135
next thing was to repeat that with the rejected lens so I set up the lens on a camera back at 
Panavision where I was helping introduce HD at the time, back focus checked it at around 
6 feet and then very carefully set the star chart up at 12 feet and did an eye focus. The scale 
showed 11 feet 9 inches, exactly what the crew had been getting. 
 It was time for greater minds to be brought to bear on the problem. I asked Panavision’s head 
of camera maintenance to focus the lens; it came up at exactly 12 feet. Puzzling. Asking a 
number of technicians in the building to focus the lens proved that less than one in ﬁ ve got it 
right and those that did all had considerable experience of using various lens test charts. Your 
average crew member, embarrassingly including myself, always came up with something near 
11 feet 9 inches. Not one of us focused long and this I cannot explain. 
 I spent the next few days pondering this and driving everybody in the building mad by asking 
them to go through the same routine with all kinds of charts I wanted to try. Eventually I 
came to the conclusion that because the star chart was of such high contrast what we were 
seeing was a function of apparent sharpness being inﬂ uenced by the contrast of the image. 
Incidentally we were all getting the same results whether we focused through the viewﬁ nder 
with or without the peaking turned on and even on a 24-inch monitor. 
 After some days I came up with the chart similar to that shown in  Figure 20.5 . Originally the 
rings were round. I now prefer the oval rings as camera assistants prefer the fact that they work 
just as well on a standard ofﬁ ce size paper where the circular rings worked best on paper twice 
the size – hard to put in a kit bag. During all my testing I had decided that because the pixel 
layout in the camera is made up of horizontal and vertical lines, straight lines might be confusing 
the result. I had also come to the conclusion that the target must be of a low-contrast nature 
whilst still being easy to judge focus on. Further, prior to all this, I had never used the peaking 
control on the viewﬁ nder as I found it disturbing during normal photography, but was rapidly 
coming to the conclusion that with the right chart for eye focusing it could be an advantage. 
 20.4  Back Focusing Using the Oval Rings Chart 
 If you set a camera up on what I have called the  “ oval focus target ” ( Figure 20.5 ) and wind 
the peaking in the viewﬁ nder up to maximum when you focus the lens, you will see the 
peaking move up and down to the top and bottom of the ﬁ nest set of rings you can resolve at 
any given distance. When the peaking effect is at its closest top and bottom you are in perfect 
focus at any distance. The peaking effect is unlikely ever to form a perfect and complete 
circle. This chart can therefore safely be used for eye focus checks and, using the same 
technique, can be used as a back focus chart. 
 This in no way negates the use of the star chart for setting the back focus; it still works 
perfectly well, but if you want a chart that can be used for back focus and general eye 
focusing on the set then the oval rings are a better bet.

for 35  mm photography, when it is mounted on a single-chip camera having a chip size close 
to the 35   mm frame, will allow production of pictures with virtually identical results. 
 Because the dimensions of the 2/3-inch chip in a three-chip video camera are considerably 
smaller than the frame size on 35   mm ﬁ lm, the focal length required to obtain an identical 
shot will be shorter for the HD camera. In fact, a ratio of 2 1/2 times is correct, meaning that 
a 25  mm lens on a 35  mm camera will have the same ﬁ eld of view as a 10  mm lens on the 
HD camera. The ratio of 2 1/2 times will become familiar to you as it applies to many of the 
comparisons between these two formats. 
 To compare HD to Super 16  mm the ratio is roughly 1 1/3.  Figure 20.6 shows the lenses that 
will obtain the same horizontal angle of view on 35  mm anamorphic lenses, 35   mm spherical 
lenses, HD lenses and Super 16 lenses. 
 If you are using a single-chip camera with a chip size similar to the 35  mm ﬁ lm frame then 
the depth of ﬁ eld you will obtain will be virtually identical to that of a 35  mm camera. You 
are, after all, using the same lenses, this being the main point of hiring such a camera. 
 20.6  Depth of Field 
 One of the signatures of the video look, when shooting with a 2/3-inch three-chip camera, 
is, in comparison with 35  mm ﬁ lm, a considerably greater depth of ﬁ eld. Depth of ﬁ eld is a 
function of three things: the size of the image required, the focal length of the lens and the 
aperture being deployed. This part of the video look comes about because, to obtain the same 
ﬁ eld of view, the focal length of the lens on a video camera using a 2/3-inch chip will be 2 1/2

times shorter than that on the lens required on a 35   mm camera or most single-chip cameras; 
this is because the image size is so much smaller. It is possible to get the same depth of ﬁ eld 
by using a wider aperture; in fact, you will need to set the lens 2 1/2 stops wider so T 4 on 
the 35  mm camera will have the same depth of ﬁ eld as T 1.6 on the 2/3-inch chipped video 
camera.  Figure 20.7 shows the apertures required to obtain the same depth of ﬁ eld on 35  mm 
anamorphic lenses, 35  mm spherical lenses, HD lenses and Super 16 lenses. 
 20.7   Calculating Depth of Field 
 With single-chip cameras, use whatever way you have always used for 35   mm ﬁ lm. The 
simplest and probably the best way to calculate your depth of ﬁ eld when shooting with a 2/3-
inch chip camera is to use a proprietary rotary slide rule designed for the job. In my opinion 
the HiDef Kelly Calculator designed and manufactured by the Guild of British Camera 
Technicians (GBCT) is one of the best available. It comes with comprehensive instructions, 
the cover of which is shown in  Figure 20.8 , and if you are familiar with earlier Kelly 
calculators you will not be surprised to discover that it works in exactly the same way. In the 
HD version one side of the calculator functions with imperial measurements ( Figure 20.9 ) 
and the other side works in the metric system ( Figure 20.10 ). To avoid confusion the solid 
part of the scale is gold on the imperial side and silver on the metric side. 
 Using the Kelly could not be simpler. You choose the appropriate focal length of the lens you 
are using and ﬁ nd it on one of the circles. Rotate the top disk until the arrow aligns with the 
distance set on the focus barrel of the lens (this is inscribed on the under disk), and either side 
of the original arrow the distances that can be considered to still be in focus will be adjacent 
to the aperture you are using. 
 There is a considerable amount of additional useful information in the instructions that come 
with the Kelly Calculator. I have been using the ﬁ lm versions since I was a focus puller and 
swear by it.

 20.8  Neutral Density (ND) Filters 
 One of the two ﬁ lter wheels at the front of the Sony HDW series, and many other similar 
cameras, contains a clear glass plus three ND ﬁ lters as they are always referred to. A neutral 
density (ND) is one that will reduce the amount of light passing through it without changing 
the color at all. 
 On the Panavision 900F the nomenclature is: for ﬁ lter 1  – Clear; for ﬁ lter 2  – 0.6, 2 stops; 
for ﬁ lter 3  – 1.2, 4 stops; and for ﬁ lter 4  – 1.8, 6 stops. This is all very logical, for a density 
of 0.3 reduces the amount of light by exactly half. On the Sony version of the camera the 
ﬁ lters are the same but, very confusingly for a person from a ﬁ lm background, they are 
labeled: 1  – Clear; 2  – 1/4 ND; 3  – 1/16 ND; 4  – 1/64 ND. 
 To keep the lens on the 2/3-inch three-chip HD camera’s aperture 2 1/2 stops wider than the 
35  mm equivalent often requires the use of ND ﬁ lters; this is why the camera has three ND 
ﬁ lters on a wheel within it. These ﬁ lters are of a sufﬁ ciently high quality that you should have 
no hesitation in using them in appropriate circumstances. If even deploying the 6 stop ﬁ lter 
leaves you with an unacceptably small stop, then there is absolutely no problem in using extra 
ND ﬁ lters in front of the lens just as you would with a ﬁ lm camera.

 20.9   Limiting Apertures 
 All optical devices have the equivalent to an aperture  – that is, there is a limit to the amount 
of light they can pass. This is true of the splitter block in most 2/3-inch three-chip cameras. 
The beam splitter that is used behind the lens to break up the image into red, green and blue 
light is described in Chapter 13. The limiting aperture of this block is usually T 1.4 or T 1.6. 
 This means that if a lens with a wider aperture than the limiting aperture of the splitter block 
is used then the exposure will never be more than that aperture, for this is the maximum 
amount of light the block will pass.

 20.10.1  Color Correction 
 All the ﬁ lters you might use to correct or adjust the coloration of the image with a ﬁ lm 
camera will give you exactly the same results in the ﬁ nal image. I am not entirely happy 
with the color correction ﬁ lters used by many manufacturers and, when shooting in daylight, 
frequently leave the clear glass in place on the color correction ﬁ lter wheel, marked 3200   K, 
and put a Wratten 85 ﬁ lter in front of the lens. This, it seems to me, makes the resultant image 
look even more like ﬁ lm, which is what I am used to.

 20.10.2  Diffusion 
 Diffusion ﬁ lters are another matter entirely. Again, this is inﬂ uenced by the smaller area of 
the 2/3-inch HD chip as against the 35   mm frame. The strength of diffusion you must use to 
gain the effect you desire is relative to the area on the camera image, so just as you would 
use a lighter ﬁ lter on Super 16 than you would on 35  mm you must be lighter still on 2/3-inch 
HD. My experience is that Super 16 requires roughly half the diffusion that you would use on 
35  mm and 2/3-inch HD requires a little less than that which you might use on Super 16. 
 Curiously the diffusion ﬁ lters I regularly use on Digi Beta, which has the same size chip but 
with far fewer pixels, does not have the same effect on 2/3-inch HD. My favorite ﬁ lter when 
shooting Digi Beta is a 1/4 white Tiffen Promist. With this ﬁ lter on a 2/3-inch HD camera it 
appears to be much stronger, so I drop to a 1/8 Promist when shooting for cinema. I gather 
various ﬁ lter manufacturers are bringing out lighter strength diffusion ﬁ lters than they have 
offered in the past to give cinematographers working with HD greater control over the image 
than traditional ﬁ lm ﬁ lters would allow. 
 When shooting with a camera having a single chip roughly the same size as a 35   mm ﬁ lm 
frame, then the diffusion ﬁ lters you are used to using on 35   mm ﬁ lm will nearly always 
produce the same effect. When shooting HD I avoid any diffusion ﬁ lter that deploys tiny glass 
beads to create the diffusion; they can sometimes interfere with the pixel pattern and therefore 
become noticeable. 
 It should be noted that the effect of diffusion when judged even on a 24-inch monitor will 
not correspond to the same effect when shown on a large theatrical screen. If you are only 
shooting for television then it is perfectly correct to judge your ﬁ ltration on a 24-inch monitor. 
This is not a safe practice if the pictures are going to be shown theatrically. If you are 
shooting your ﬁ rst HD picture and you are fond of diffusion then it is essential that you shoot 
some tests and have them post-produced in the same manner as the ﬁ nal delivery system.

CHAPTER 21 
 Monitors and Cabling 
 If, like me, you choose to light to your monitor then this chapter might just be one of the most 
important you ever read. Setting up monitors is not difﬁ cult or particularly time-consuming 
but for someone from a ﬁ lm background it can, at ﬁ rst, be a little daunting. 
 21.1  What Kinds of Monitor are Available? 
 21.1.1  Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Monitors 
 Monitors using CRT technology have been the most common to be offered by high-end 
suppliers, though this is beginning to change as high-quality ﬂ at-screen monitors are now 
available. They nearly all come with a 16    9 screen, for which the most likely dimension of 
the diagonal of the picture will be 9, 14 or 24 inches. The early High Deﬁ nition (HD) CRT 
monitors were interlace scan only and the picture therefore stuttered slightly when the camera 
was panned rapidly if that camera were set up to shoot in Progressive scan. This effect is 
never recorded, it being partly a function of having to display a progressively scanned picture 
on an interlace scan monitor and partly a function of the high modular transfer function 
(MTF) of HD in the middle tones of the image. More recently, true Progressive scan monitors 
have come into use and with these the stuttering picture never appears. Not surprisingly the 
Progressive scan monitors are more expensive. 
  21.1.2  Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Monitors 
 Early HD LCD monitors had, most commonly, a screen diagonal measuring 6 or 7 inches. 
These sizes are now more often used as on-board screens either as the viewﬁ nder if the 
camera operator prefers this or as a viewing guide for the focus puller. These screens are far 
too small for the focus puller to judge focus by, but do at least conﬁ rm what is actually being 
photographed. Recently, LCD screens have become available in much larger sizes, with a 
14-inch becoming very popular as a Director’s monitor. LCD monitors rarely exhibit the 
stutter shown on CRT monitors as the difference in their technology masks this effect, or at 
least masks a great deal of this effect. They are usually light weight and quite pleasant to look 
at, though I would hesitate to judge lighting or sharpness on a smaller one. 

144  Chapter 21
 21.1.3  Plasma Screens 
 Plasma screen technology allows for large screens, often with a screen diagonal sometimes 
measuring between 42 and 61 inches; even larger screens are now coming onto the market. 
They can be very attractive to look at provided you are not too close. They are very slim but 
do not quite have the quality of picture of a large CRT screen. They are also expensive but do 
mask the stutter effect perhaps even better than an LCD monitor. 
 21.2 Lining up Your Monitor 
 One must take great care in lining up your monitor especially if you are going to judge your 
lighting via your monitor; fortunately this can be carried out both quickly and accurately. 
 Most cameras will generate either European Broadcasting Union (EBU) color bars (Color 
Plate 10) or Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) color bars (Color 
Plate 11); many will generate both, with the selection between them somewhere in the 
camera’s menu. The object of the exercise, with either kind of color bars, is to get the bars 
correctly displayed by adjusting the brightness, chroma and contrast controls. EBU bars really 
require some sort of meter capable of reading the screen brightness, though in an emergency 
they can be lined up reasonably by eye. SMPTE bars, on the other hand, can reliably be lined 
up without a meter for they were designed so that an  “ eyeball ” line-up would be reasonably, 
if not very, accurate. It is still possible to increase the reliability of your line-ups if you can 
measure screen brightness accurately in some way, even when using SMPTE bars. 
 Being British I used to favor EBU bars but since working more extensively with HD, 
where SMPTE bars are more often used, I have changed my mind and now feel much more 
comfortable lining up to SMPTE bars. 
 21.2.1  An SMPTE Line-up 
 The ﬁ rst parameters to set are brightness and contrast. Find the red bar and looking slightly 
below it ﬁ nd the three narrow vertical gray bars. Now switch the monitor to blue only. If at 
ﬁ rst you can’t ﬁ nd them then increase the brightness until they appear. Your monitor should 
now look very much like  Figure 21.1 . You now need to reduce the brightness until the left 
and the middle bars just disappear, leaving only the right hand of the three little bars still just 
visible. These three small bars on your monitor should now look very like  Figure 21.2  . 
 Towards the lower left-hand segment of the screen you will ﬁ nd a white square. Using the 
contrast control adjust this square until it just bleeds into the adjoining areas; now back off 
the contrast control until this effect just disappears. This is often described as reducing it until 
it ceases to  “ glow ” . Or you can use some exposure meters to set contrast (see below). 

Monitors and Cabling   145
 With any television format the brightness and contrast controls are never wholly independent 
of each other, so you may well have to go through the loop of making adjustments to both 
controls until you ﬁ nd you are no longer making any more changes. 
 The third parameter to set is chroma. On the screen you should see four vertical white bars 
with three much darker bars between them. If chroma is incorrectly set this part of the screen 
 Figure 21.1 :  SMPTE Color Bars with “Blue Only ” switched ON – incorrectly set up 
 Figure 21.2 :  SMPTE Color Bars with “Blue Only ” switched ON – correctly set up 

146  Chapter 21
may look something like  Figure 21.1 . Below each bar you may be looking at a much smaller 
and rectangular section to the bar. For the moment ignore all the other portions of the screen. 
 What you have to try to achieve is a situation where all seven long bars match, as near as 
possible, the smaller rectangular sections below them. The control we are going to adjust is 
chroma. Adjust the control until you have the best possible match between the large vertical 
bars and the smaller sections below them on all seven bars. When you have successfully done 
this the screen should look something like  Figure 21.2 ; in other words the smaller rectangular 
sections have effectively disappeared. 
 When you are satisﬁ ed with your result switch off the  “ Blue Only ” control  – your line-up is 
now complete. 
 21.2.2  Lining up Using EBU Bars 
 First set the monitor to underscan, which sets the picture slightly smaller than the screen. 
Using the brightness control adjust the right-hand black bar to match the density of the 
surrounding unused screen area. Now switch the monitor to  “ Blue Only ” . Using the chroma 
control adjust the second bar from the left again until the density of the bar exactly matches 
the surrounding screen density. Using the contrast control adjust the extreme left-hand bar, 
which is white, brighter and brighter until it just appears to  “ glow ” , then back off just a 
little until it stops glowing. You can set the contrast with some exposure meters (see below). 
Switch off the  “ Blue Only ” control. Switch the camera back to picture and your monitor 
should be perfectly lined up. 
 Monitors should be lined up a few minutes after being switched on and  every time the lighting 
environment surrounding the monitor changes. 
 21.2.3  Using an Exposure Meter 
 If you have an exposure meter that can cope with a ﬂ ickering image, such as a Cine Meter 
II or a Spectra Combi II, place it with its ﬂ at disk attached over the extreme left-hand white 
bar on EBU bars or the white box bottom - left on SMPTE bars and adjust the contrast till the 
meter reads 27 foot candles. The same trick works with a Seconic L508 Cine with the dome 
retracted but the correct reading with this meter is 54 foot candles. The difference in reading 
is caused by the way meters behave when faced with a scanned picture. To ﬁ nd out if your 
meter should read 27 or 54 foot candles simply do a careful eyeball line-up and place your 
meter on the appropriate part of the screen; it will now read very close to either 27 or 54 
foot candles. From now on set your screen contrast to the appropriate value nearest to your 
test reading. Some meters will not give an accurate reading from a screen; these are easily 
discovered as the reading will be unstable and jump around  – these meters should not be used 
for lining up a monitor. 

Monitors and Cabling   147
 21.3  Cabling your Monitor 
 How you cable your monitor may not seem important; in fact, it is vital to your success. 
 There are three commonly found ways of outputting an HD color picture from a camera to 
either a stand-alone video recorder or a television monitor. They are called RGB (Red, Green 
and Blue), HDSDI (High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface) and SDSDI (Standard Deﬁ nition 
Serial Digital Interface). As the name suggests, three cables would be required for the RGB 
signal, one for each color. HDSDI provides a high-quality digital signal, which can be carried 
on a single coaxial cable. HDSDI or the lower quality SDSDI, which again is carried on 
a single coaxial cable, are the most common signals for monitoring camera outputs on a 
professional shoot. 
 There is another way of monitoring a camera’s output, a Composite signal. The advantage of 
the Composite signal is that it can be carried on a single cable and this is the more common 
way of outputting a signal from the camera to a monitor screen in the amateur or domestic 
arena. It is simple, convenient and only requires standard quality coaxial cabling. However, it 
only delivers a standard deﬁ nition picture and this picture will not be as good or as robust as 
an HDSDI or SDSDI signal. 
 21.3.1  Single Coaxial Cables 
 Most HD cameras either deliver an HDSDI output signal or can easily be ﬁ tted with an 
adapter to make this output available. The advantage of using an HDSDI feed is that you only 
need a single coaxial cable between your camera and your monitor. The disadvantage is that 
should you want to see menu information on your monitor, HDSDI will not deliver it; it only 
delivers picture. 
 When feeding HDSDI signals down a BNC (Bayonet N Connector) cable, the standard 
cable used in most broadcast applications is not of sufﬁ cient quality to reliably transmit a 
satisfactory HD signal, except where the cable is very short. It is unfortunate that the HD 
industry has, in the main, continued to use BNC connectors; they were never designed for the 
rigors of location work and therefore are rather unreliable. We hang a $100,000 camera on the 
end of a plug costing less than a buck  – I, for one, ﬁ nd this ridiculous. 
 21.3.2  Triple Coaxial Cables 
 Alternatively, on many cameras, you can take a three-core coaxial cable out of the three BNC 
plugs on the side of the camera labeled Y, PR and PB. Down this cable you can send both 
the picture and all the menu information. The disadvantage of this triple cable is that it is 
some 20  mm or 3/4 inch in diameter and quite stiff. If you wish to see menu information but 

148  Chapter 21
do not require a color image you can use a single coaxial cable between the sockets on both 
the camera and monitor labeled Y. This will give you an HD black and white image with the 
menu if you need it. 
 21.3.3  Termination 
 If you are simply feeding one monitor directly from the camera then termination should 
not be a problem. If you are looping from the camera to one monitor and then on again to 
another monitor, understanding termination is vital. The simple rule is that the last monitor in 
the line must be terminated. This may, on some monitors, be automatic, may be done with a 
simple switch or you may have to put a termination plug onto the Video Out socket of the last 
monitor on the line. If you don’t the danger is you will see a different image on each monitor 
and it is quite likely that none of them will be correct. 
 21.3.4  Serial Monitors 
 Even if you get your termination right the number of monitors hung onto a single camera 
output can disastrously affect the quality of the image. Do not accept an image ampliﬁ er 
between any source and the monitor you, the Director of Photography (DP), are going to 
watch. They may claim to be transparent  – that is, adding no changes to the image  – but 
believe me I would never stake my reputation on it. 
 21.4   Best Practice 
 The monitor the DP is going to watch should come from a single output on the camera; no 
other monitors should be fed from this output and no monitors should be fed down line from 
the DP’s monitor. This rule should never be broken. 
 Choose another output from the camera or HDSDI converter for any other monitors and do 
not be swayed from this opinion. I have let this happen in the past and it was a disaster  –
please learn from my experience.

 22.1  It’s Not ENG! 
 Although High Deﬁ nition (HD) cameras tend to look a little like the earlier generation of 
Electronic News Gathering (ENG) cameras they are very different and have to be treated 
accordingly. For instance, the Sony HDW F900 is virtually the same size as, and has all the 
switches in the same place as, the generation of Digi Beta cameras that preceded it, namely 
the DVW 790. The HDW F900 has even been described, by my good friend Peter Swarbrick, 
as a Digi Beta on steroids  – an excellent comparison, if a little unscientiﬁ c! 
 More recent cameras such as the Sony 750P, 730 and 900R are, amazingly, slightly smaller 
and a little lighter than the original Digi Beta. 
 With any HD camera we are dealing with a camera capable of recording an image of 
massively greater resolution. Curiously the NTSC system delivers almost exactly the 
same data rate per second as the PAL system. This is a result of the limiting transmission 
bandwidth available to both systems at their inception. NTSC has to transmit 525 lines of 
information 30 times a second; 30 complete frames per second derives from their 60 cycles 
per second mains supply frequency. So 525    30    15,750 lines per second. PAL has to 
transmit 625 lines 25 times per second, the local mains here having a frequency of 50 cycles 
per second. So 625     25    15,625. These are remarkably similar ﬁ gures given the gap of 
the Atlantic Ocean, caused by very similar limitations on the amount of data that could be 
economically transmitted. 
 Now let us compare a single frame and its resolution. For simplicity I am only going to use the 
PAL model; the ﬁ gures for NTSC are very similar. A single PAL image (the image does not use 
all the lines transmitted in either the PAL or the NTSC systems) is actually made up, per color, 
of 576 pixels vertically by 720 pixels horizontally, giving a gross single frame a resolution of 
414,720 pixels. Compare this with HD, where the true vertical resolution is comprised of 1080 
pixels and the true horizontal resolution is made up of 1920 pixels, giving a gross resolution 
of 2,073,600 pixels. Gross picture resolution is therefore nearly ﬁ ve times the resolution of a 
domestic television. So an HD camera is having to work at least ﬁ ve times harder per frame than 
an ENG camera. To keep it in perfect working order it therefore deserves much more respect. 

150  Chapter 22
 22.2   Shipping Lenses 
 ENG cinematographers are used to shipping their cameras with the lenses mounted on them, 
although the more careful do try and take them as hand baggage. As we have seen elsewhere 
in this book, to be able to ﬁ ll a large cinema screen and cause the audience not to question how 
the image was recorded when they are used to watching 35   mm ﬁ lm, the HD lenses should 
be able to approach a resolution of 2 1/2 times that of the 35   mm camera lenses. As we have 
seen above, the camera itself must be able to record ﬁ ve times the gross resolution. Put these 
two factors together and no matter how strong the lens mount, the camera/lens combination is 
unlikely to perform to maximum speciﬁ cation if they have been shipped attached to each other. 
 As an extreme example the largest of the Panavision zooms weighs 8.5 kilograms or about 
18.75 pounds; just think of the bending forces involved on that lens mount should the camera, 
with the lens attached, receive a blow. A sensible technician will ship the lenses separated 
from the camera body just as ﬁ lm technicians have always done. 
 22.3   Transit Cases 
 There is a curious divide between the case and padding philosophies either side of the 
Atlantic. In America a professional shipping case will, as often as not, be made from resin-
coated plywood lined with soft foam. This is a great case with a lining that allows the 
equipment to ﬂ oat about to some extent, but as the foam is always quite thick between the 
equipment and the case wall the equipment can never receive a harsh blow. Europeans, 
particularly the British, take a different approach. Their cases are as often as not ribbed 
aluminium and ﬁ lled with high-density foam that very snugly ﬁ ts the equipment. The 
philosophy here is that you do not allow the equipment to move but any signiﬁ cant blow will 
almost totally be absorbed by the high-density foam. 
 I have worked extensively with cases following both patterns and am conﬁ dent that both 
types protect the equipment equally well. As I come from the UK you will not be surprised 
that I slightly favor the European aluminium case with its high-density foam. It does not offer 
any greater protection than the US version but the foam lasts a lot longer and the case/foam 
combination does lead to slightly smaller, and therefore easier to handle, cases. 
 22.4   Camera Set-up When Shipping 
 I have shipped both Digi Beta and HD cameras all over the world for many years and have 
never found that the shipping procedure alters the camera menu set-up. That said, I always 
take the precaution of writing the set - up to a card or memory stick so that should I ﬁ nd the 
need to re-program the menu it is the work of moments. 

Shipping  151
 I have been in the situation where I have programmed a card or memory stick on one 
continent and shipped just myself and the program to another continent and then loaded the 
program into a locally supplied camera. My experience is this is a safe and reliable procedure. 
 22.5  Size and Weight 
 If you compare a full feature ﬁ lm camera kit with a similar HD kit the individual boxes may 
be of different weights but the whole shipping manifest is unlikely to show much change. But 
note, I said camera kit. If your team want to have full HD monitoring facilities, and I would 
heartily recommend they do, then your monitor shipping weight will almost inevitably be 
more than a black and white video assist kit. My favorite 24-inch monitor, in its case, weighs 
around 87 pounds or about 40 kilograms! But worth every pound, or kilogram. 
 22.6  Batteries 
 You will need more batteries than if you were shooting with a 35   mm ﬁ lm camera. There are 
two reasons for this: ﬁ rst, any digital device tends to be power hungry and, more importantly, 
you are consuming power just to make the viewﬁ nder work, whereas with a ﬁ lm camera it 
consumes virtually no power when in the equivalent of a standby mode. 
 On-board batteries are very convenient but even large and efﬁ cient ones will only last 
between 1 1/2 and 4 hours depending on how much recording you make in any given time. 
Often overlooked is the simple expedient of using a block battery, just as we often do with 
ﬁ lm cameras. Most video cameras are 12-volt devices, though the newer high-end cameras 
are moving over to 24-volt just as ﬁ lm cameras are. As a guide, a good 12-volt block battery 
will run a Sony HDW F900 all day in all but the most arduous circumstances, so if you are in 
a studio or even on location but will spend most of the day on a dolly the block battery may 
be your answer.

CHAPTER 23 
 Multicamera Shoots 
 In Europe, especially in the UK, big multicamera shoots are not common. There is a small 
market for performance ﬁ lms  – that is, taking subjects originally presented on the stage and 
transferring them to the screen  – but it is limited. There are a few rock concerts shot with up 
to 10 cameras but again this is a very small market. 
 In the USA matters are very different. Traditionally sitcoms have been shot on 35  mm, most 
recently with a camera having a three-perforation mechanism as against the traditional four, 
which saves 25 percent of the stock and processing costs. The market is so signiﬁ cant that 
Panavision has developed a camera exclusively for this market. It is three-perf, as one would 
expect, has 2000-feet magazines and usually carries a big, long-range zoom. Two thousand 
feet of 35  mm ﬁ lm is heavy so the issue of the weight transfer from the front of the magazine 
to the back during a take becomes important. To overcome this, between the camera base and 
the tripod head there are two wedged plates slotting together with a lead screw arrangement 
so that the camera operator can smoothly move the camera fore and aft to re-balance the 
camera during a take. Optical viewﬁ nders are also removed and the camera operators 
use video assist monitors as on a television studio camera. These video assist outputs are 
also used to feed audience monitors  – often to induce laughter from the audience to be 
incorporated onto the soundtrack. 
 This camera is often mounted on a studio-style pedestal with all the cabling brought together 
in a loom. A loom is simply a sheath, usually made of nylon, which encases all the necessary 
cables so there is only one tail coming from each camera. 
 It is this multicamera television market that is embracing the High Deﬁ nition (HD) 
philosophy faster than any other. The reasons are simple. There is little difference between the 
rental cost of an HD camera and a specialist three-perf 35  mm camera. If you add the cost of 
5000 feet of 35  mm raw stock to the negative processing cost and further add telecine time to 
transfer it to tape for editing and then compare that total to the purchase price of a 50-minute 
cassette of tape you ﬁ nd the ﬁ lm cost is around 50 times that of the tape, a powerful argument 
in this market. Add to this the fact that in going over to HD there is no discernible change in 
picture quality, given a good Director of Photography (DP). 

154  Chapter 23
 Things on set get simpler too. Tape changes are only needed after 50 minutes of recording 
time as against a little over 20 minutes for even the specialist ﬁ lm cameras. Wiring looms can 
be made up in exactly the same way. Instead of having to look at a video assist monitor, the 
Director is now viewing ﬁ nished product in full HD resolution and color depth. Recording 
stock weight transfer problems become a thing of the past as the weight of the tape is 
negligible and it travels from the top to the bottom of the cassette during recording, so there is 
no fore and aft weight transfer as in a ﬁ lm camera. 
 23.1   Synchronization 
 Synchronization of the time code between many pieces of equipment has to be very carefully 
thought out, especially if you are using Sony or Sony-derived cameras. The problem is very 
similar to that experienced with the earlier Digi Beta cameras. Put simply, the problem lies 
in the fact that for ease of writing to the tape the total image is recorded in two blocks; this 
is more convenient and produces a higher tape writing speed. Time code, on the other hand, 
is written as four groups of two numbers, the groups representing hours, minutes, seconds 
and frames. A complete frame is the smallest unit it can handle. When you stop recording, 
the tape may come to a halt on either block of the picture information being laid down on 
the tape. This is not a problem as the recorder will start recording seamlessly on either a ﬁ rst 
block or a second block so the picture will be continuous. The time code, on the other hand, 
can only progress in whole numbers of frames. It is therefore possible to restart recording 
where the time code has, in effect, made a jump forward in time equivalent to half a frame 
relative to the picture information. This is not a drawback if you are recording picture and 
sound on a single camera, but is a crucial matter if you are using two or more devices that 
need to be synchronized via their time code. Even two identical cameras cannot be relied 
upon to stop and start with greater accuracy than a time space interval of half a frame. 
 Therefore the only solution is somehow to lock the time code of every piece of equipment 
together with frame accuracy. 
 23.2   Time Code on Location 
 If you are reasonably static on location it is possible to link up all the various sound and 
camera devices by running cables from time code out of one device and daisy-chaining BNC 
cables to time code in of the next device, taking time code out of that device to the time code 
in on the next device and so on. If you do this you will need to make sure that all but the ﬁ rst 
device is set to use external time code. In these situations the sound master will more often 
than not be something like a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) recorder, in which case this is usually 
used as the master time code source. 

Multicamera Shoots  155
 23.2.1  Lock-it Boxes 
 Film crews traditionally hate cables, so though the above solution is very reliable, the 
necessary cables will be most unpopular. There is a very elegant and not very expensive 
solution. Each device on set should be given an external time code generator. The version I 
use nearly all the time is called a “ lock-it box ” . Roughly the size of a packet of 20 cigarettes, 
these boxes are extraordinarily reliable and very easy to use. Most often the lock-it box will 
be attached to the camera using a pad of Velcro  – very convenient. 
 Usually the sound department will look after the lock-its and synchronize them all together at 
the beginning of the shooting day, then hand them round the unit as required. They are more than 
reliable enough to need no attention until the day’s wrap, when they are returned to the sound 
department to have a power check and be restarted the following morning. It is claimed they will 
hold sync for up to a week, but good practice suggests a fresh sync-up every day is prudent. 
 It must be noted that the lock-it boxes used for Digi Beta will not sufﬁ ce for HD  – you will 
need boxes capable of delivering Tri Level Sync and this should be stipulated when ordering 
your equipment package. 
 23.2.2  Script Boy 
 There is a further reﬁ nement to this system. A device known as a  “ script boy ” can be given to 
the Scrip Supervisor, or Continuity as they used to be known. It consists of a clipboard with 
a time code generator just like the lock-it with the addition of a time code display on the top 
of it. A simpler solution I have seen used recently was a digital watch, in this case a G Shock, 
which the sound mixer was able to set by hand every morning with an accuracy of within a 
second, usually more than good enough for the notes sent to the picture editor. 
 23.3  Time Code in a Studio 
 Film crews must now abandon all hope. In a studio situation with more than one camera there 
are going to be so many cables that the sensible approach is to go down that route and get 
really well organized. 
 The number of cables can easily mount up and a list might look like this: 
● 
 Power 
● 
 BNC High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) monitor cable 
● 
 BNC time code in 
● 
 BNC time code out 

156  Chapter 23
● 
 Genlock in 
● 
 Genlock out 
● 
 Remote camera control cable 
● 
 Audio channel 1 in 
● 
 Audio channel 2 in 
● 
 Audio monitoring. 
 You can have more: the monitor could be from the three-core socket instead of or in addition 
to the HDSDI single socket. 
 The solution to all this is to make up a loom for each camera long before shooting 
commences. Many suppliers will already have this available, so it is worth asking. 
 On a long or multicamera shoot it is also quite the norm to have a mains-driven time code 
generator and run every single piece of equipment from it, including sound department. 
 Although a nylon-sheathed loom cable may be an inch in diameter (25   mm), it is at least now 
the equivalent of a single cable and much more crew friendly. 
 23.3.1  Genlock 
 One cable we have not discussed is that labeled Genlock. Strictly speaking you only need to 
run this cable if you are cutting in real time via a control suite. Genlock ensures that all the 
cameras will open and close their electronic shutters at exactly the same moment. This can 
be important, for if you cut in real time between one camera and another imagine what would 
happen if you left one camera just as its shutter was about to open and cut to the incoming 
camera just as its shutter was about to close. You would have a totally blank frame. 
 By daisy-chaining the Genlock out to the Genlock in of the next camera you have all the 
shutters working in perfect synchronism. 
 23.4   Menu Set-ups 
 23.4.1  The Sony RMB 150 
 Many lighting directors from a television studio background like to have remote control over 
the camera set-up. I do not, but that’s a matter of taste and background. There is a remote 
control box for the Sony HDW F900 and it goes under the title of an RMB 150 ( Figure 23.1 ). 
The problem with using an RMB 150, as I see it, is that you can only control the image from 
each camera by referring to the monitors, which seems a shame when you have all those nice 

Multicamera Shoots  157
digital pages in the menus. Now engineers from a television studio background do this with 
amazing precision, but it frightens the hell out of me! 
 The RMB 150 is capable of controlling many of the picture parameters such as brightness, 
gamma, black levels, etc., and has a remote run/stop. It controls all but the run/stop with 
rotary knobs, with little guide as to the extent of their effect. It should also be noted that 
having made changes using the RMB 150, if you now unplug the unit it leaves the camera 
with all the settings you have made; the camera does not go back to any previous setting. 
 Television studio practice allows for small differences in exposure and color correction from 
camera to camera; this is not the case in ﬁ lm. A ﬁ lm DP, if shooting with several cameras, 
will either light the set for a perfect match, my preference, or give each camera a separate 
exposure setting. Neither route is  “ correct ” , but simply the result of different experience and 
training.
 23.4.2  Using Memory Sticks 
   I am sure it will come as no surprise that I prefer to have all my cameras set up to exactly 
the same parameters so that I can match the monitors by adjusting my lighting. That 
 Figure 23.1 :  The Sony RMB 150 remote control unit 

158  Chapter 23
is not to say that I may not use slightly different set-ups from scene to scene, but I try 
very hard never to make any changes during an individual scene. This is because I have 
a hang-up about lighting and picture continuity in general, which comes from my ﬁ lm 
background where shots within a scene might very well have their order on the screen 
rearranged in the cutting room, so I try very hard to ensure that they will all match no 
matter what the order. If you are more used to working in a studio where a live cut 
is made, then you are much more certain of the eventual cutting order and need not 
acquire my neurosis. 
 My technique is simple. I set up the main shot, usually something like a master wide and, 
using the camera’s menu, set this camera to my preferred look. I will then record the settings 
to a memory stick and, using the stick, load these settings onto all the other cameras. As a 
precaution I will keep an eye on the leading actors ’ close-ups during rehearsals to make sure 
my settings and the make-up do not conﬂ ict in any way. In these circumstances the majority 
of my lighting will almost certainly have been done in advance of shooting and I will have 
considerable control over the lamps via a dimmer board. My aim is always to have set the 
lighting for the whole scene well before rehearsals are over and not touch anything at all 
during the scene. 
 23.5   Matching Lenses 
 The ideal is to have all your lenses from a single good-quality manufacturer so that no 
adjustment between cameras is ever called for. If you source your cameras and lenses from a 
high-quality supplier offering a complete range of lenses from a single manufacturer you can 
be absolutely sure of a perfect match between all zoom and prime lenses and no adjustments 
whatsoever will be needed. My apologies to all the other manufacturers, but experience 
has led me to favor the Panavision Digital Primo lenses; they suite my style and are utterly 
reliable. A second, and very good, choice would be Zeiss digital lenses, which are also of 
excellent quality. Lenses from other manufacturers make me nervous if I am shooting for 
cinema presentation. For broadcast-only shoots many other makes are quite acceptable. I 
suggest you test any lens kit you are offered and make up your own mind. 
 If you ﬁ nd your lens set does not match in image quality and look, there are things you can 
do about it but usually you will be bringing the look of your better lenses down to the quality 
of your worst lens. If you look carefully in the Sony HDW F900 menus and, indeed, most 
of the Sony HD cameras, in the section named Operations you will ﬁ nd a page labeled Lens 
File. Here it is possible to assign individual settings to several different lenses. Many other 
manufacturers offer a similar facility within their menu system  – look hard, it’s usually there 
somewhere. 

Multicamera Shoots  159
 The problem is that to make a sharp lens match a softer lens you either have to reduce the 
image enhancement of the better lens and/or bring up the electronic image enhancement of 
the poorer lens so much the image acquires all the bad characteristics of the look of poor-
quality video, so why are you spending so much money on an HD kit? 
 Personally I would not accept a lens set that did not match perfectly without any adjustment 
within the camera.

CHAPTER 24 
 Hazardous Conditions 
 There are many myths about video cameras in general, and High Deﬁ nition (HD) cameras in 
particular, regarding their vulnerability to the elements. Most of this is nonsense. If you think 
of the amount of electronics packed into a modern ﬁ lm camera, what makes an HD camera 
more susceptible to hazardous conditions? Very little. 
 There are a couple of cut-out switches in the camera to protect it from abuse. It will stop if 
the humidity surrounding the tape record drum becomes too high, and it has to be very high 
indeed for this to happen. A ﬁ lm camera would probably be equally in trouble. This safety 
trip is a wise precaution, for if the humidity surrounding the tape drum ever reaches a critical 
point the tape will, eventually, stick to the drum. You don’t want this to happen as it is not a 
ﬁ eld serviceable condition. The camera is going to need a whole new tape drum and that is 
going to be very expensive. I have been associated with a long-term shoot where a Panavised 
Sony camera was up a Scottish mountain in a gale for some considerable time; sensible 
precautions were taken, exactly as you would with a ﬁ lm camera, and there was never the 
slightest suggestion that the camera was threatening to shut down. There was a real chance 
that the crew would have to though! 
 There is a heat overload cut-out switch as well; this is mainly to protect the computer 
processors from overloading. I have never experienced or heard of this tripping out. I have 
been associated with an HD shoot in the Moroccan desert where the temperature was 110 ° F 
in the shade; the cameras worked perfectly. A personal experience of the reliability of HD 
cameras in this respect came when shooting in a studio during a particularly hot summer. As 
we neared lunch my camera operator put his hand on top of the Sony 750 we were shooting 
with in order to reach over for something and quickly pulled his hand away  – it was very hot 
indeed. The ribbing on the top of the camera and under the handle is not a feature there to 
make the camera look more appealing; it is to better dissipate the waste heat from the analog-
to-digital processor and do the job very well. When we broke for lunch my Gaffer, who had a 
voltmeter that could also be used as a temperature probe, measured the ribbing just before we 
switched the camera off for lunch  – it was 32 ° C! I believe we really could have fried an egg 
on it. The moral of this tale is that the camera was still working perfectly, just as it had been 
designed to. 

162  Chapter 24
 24.1   Resetting the Trips 
 If you look under a Sony camera at the rear on the operator’s side you will see a small hole; 
this is the reset button. If the camera has tripped out then press a small, blunt object such as 
the end of a paper clip into this hole. The camera will not restart immediately. You need to 
take it where it is drier or cooler, depending on why it has tripped, and wait for the conditions 
to change. Removing the cassette and leaving the door open can help matters. The camera 
will come back to life when you press the reset some 20 minutes later. If you look carefully 
you will ﬁ nd a similar reset somewhere on most HD cameras. 
 Treat an HD camera with the respect you would give a high-quality 35  mm camera and you are 
unlikely to have any problems. Nevertheless, let us look at the precautions you might like to take. 
 24.2   Water 
 Please ignore the old adage  “ Water and electricity don’t mix. ” The adage should be  “ Water 
and electricity mix only too well. ” In fact, they attract each other. If there is the slightest sign 
of rain keep the rain cover handy. If you are going into a very humid environment take the 
camera and lenses in some hours before you need to use them and let them normalize. Keep a 
hair-drier handy in these circumstances to speed things up  – but not set on heat please! Use it 
on cold or you may melt something signiﬁ cant. All just as you would do with a ﬁ lm camera. 
 24.3   Heat 
 Referring to the above, don’t put the rain cover on unnecessarily  – it can cause a heat build-up 
as the fans cooling the computer processors won’t get their heat away as efﬁ ciently. If Sound 
have insisted, as they often do with the quietest of cameras, that you cover it with something 
to make it quieter, take that something off as soon as the take is ﬁ nished. Remember the front-
end processors are working full time just to give you a picture in the viewﬁ nder and therefore 
they will be dumping waste energy, in the form of heat, even when the camera is on standby. 
This is one difference from a ﬁ lm camera. 
 If you are shooting on a very hot exterior location you would be very foolish not to put an 
umbrella up over a ﬁ lm camera to ensure that the ﬁ lm stock did not reach temperatures that 
would change its characteristics; please do just the same with an HD camera even if the 
reasons are different. 
 24.4   Cold 
 It is traditional to  “ winterize ” a ﬁ lm camera if it is going to an extremely cold climate. HD 
cameras probably survive cold better than ﬁ lm cameras do. HD lenses will need just the same 

Hazardous Conditions  163
attention as ﬁ lm lenses. The biggest problem might be cables; they can become very brittle in 
the cold, especially BNC cables. Check out a few different makes of coaxial cable in a cold 
store to ﬁ nd the one that will survive. 
 Batteries in extreme cold are always a problem. Two remedies come immediately to mind: 
one is putting a DC supply cable into the camera and keeping the battery on the other end of 
it inside your clothing; alternatively, if you are shooting more formally, say on a tripod or a 
dolly, then before you leave home have some block batteries clad in 1- or 2-inch polystyrene 
and then have an outer case made for them in plywood. In really freezing conditions you 
could have a double-thickness polystyrene layer underneath the block battery and mount a 
suitable car headlamp bulb under it as a heater. Your battery will run down somewhat faster 
but while it has a charge it should be lively enough to keep the camera running. 
 24.5  Dust 
 All the usual precautions apply, such as protecting your lenses, setting up wind-breaks where 
possible, perhaps using the rain cover to protect the camera. 
 There is one both essential and simple protection an HD camera needs over a ﬁ lm camera. 
The most vulnerable parts of the HD camera, with regard to dust, are the tape transport 
mechanism and the record head drum. Very fortunately the gaps around the cassette loading 
door are not used in any way as cooling ports, so if you are in a dusty, gritty or dirty 
environment simply put some gaffer tape over the gaps between the camera body and the 
cassette loading door. 
 24.6  Gamma Rays 
 Now this is a bit sci-ﬁ  but bear with me, it could be important. One of the few things that can 
kill a pixel on the imaging chip is a gamma ray hitting it smack in the middle. At ground level 
there is very little chance of this happening; the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs or reduces the 
chances by a very large factor. On the other hand, if you are ﬂ ying the camera at an altitude 
anything above 30 , 000 feet gamma rays are much more prevalent. I have only known one 
occasion where a camera has suffered gamma ray damage after ﬂ ying and only one pixel was 
affected. 
 In all my time with both Digi Beta cameras and HD cameras I have only known one moment 
when several pixels were destroyed at the same time. Curiously, over a 24-hour period 
a camera in London was ﬁ ne before lunch and after lunch had several dead pixels. The 
following day I had a telephone call from a crew in Prague in the Czech Republic saying 
there were a couple of dead pixels  – very strange. Was there a sun spot that day or something? 
Who knows? 

164  Chapter 24
 A pixel normally dies switched on so you will see a bright spot on the screen; it will be of the 
color relating to the chip it is on. Fortunately there are several ways to get rid of this bright 
spot. If you have missed it during shooting, and because it will always be in exactly the same 
place in the picture area, it is easy to eradicate in post-production. If you spot it before turning 
over then there is a better than 90 percent chance you can quickly solve the problem. Hold the 
black balance switch down for at least 3 seconds. The camera will now perform an extended 
black balance and an auto pixel check. This might take up to a minute and you may have to 
perform this operation eight or ten times to completely eradicate the problem. The camera has 
a sophisticated memory circuit in it and if it ﬁ nds a dead pixel it will, for the rest of the life 
of the picture head block, take an average of the eight pixels surrounding the dead pixel and 
assign this average to the dead pixels ’ output. The memory is sufﬁ cient to cover for up to 40 
dead pixels. I have never known a camera reach anything like that number of dead pixels, but 
should it, the only solution then is to change the prism block and the three receptor chips. 
 If the auto pixel check fails to clear all the dead pixels  – and you are only likely to be in 
this position if the pixel has only partially failed, which will give a dull colored glow on the 
screen  – then the pixel memory correction can be initiated manually. I am not going to go into 
the whole procedure here, but if you need to do it in some distant part of the globe then ring 
your supplier and they will happily guide you through the process. If you are on your mobile 
phone make sure you have a fresh battery; it is not difﬁ cult but it is tedious. It’s very like 
playing an old computer game; you have to line up a vertical line and a horizontal line exactly 
over the pixel in question. With two million plus pixels per chip this can take a while and 
there is no scoring system, so it can be a thankless task. 

165
CHAPTER 25 
 Camera Supports 
 Tripods and tripod heads should be chosen in much the same way as you would for a ﬁ lm 
camera. This means that for a Genesis, Arriﬂ ex D-21 or Sony HDW F900 you should have 
the quality and strength you would use for a 35  mm camera, and for the Sony HDW 700P 
range and their 900R, or a Panasonic HDC 20A, you could go down to the slightly lighter 
equipment you might use for a fully equipped Arri SR3 or a well-loaded Super 16 camera. 
Unless we are going to be taking the kit into difﬁ cult locations my preference is to always go 
for the 35  mm type supports as they are usually much more robust and generally nicer to use. 
 25.1  Fluid Heads 
 Any ﬂ uid head that is robust enough to take easily the weight of your chosen camera in its 
heaviest conﬁ guration, say with the biggest zoom and the on-board battery attached, will 
sufﬁ ce. That said, I have a personal preference for underslung ﬂ uid heads where the tilt 
bearing is level with the optical axis. These are usually of a dog-leg or  “ L ” conﬁ guration. 
My favorite is the Ron Ford Baker Fluid 7; it has been going for many years and has been in 
continuous development, so the current model will comfortably support an F900 or similar 
camera in any conﬁ guration. 
 Cartoni have introduced a head of similar conﬁ guration to the Ron Ford Baker Fluid 7, which 
they have christened the Lambda. It is more easily adjustable than the F7 and pays for this by 
being slightly larger and heavier. I have used one and it was very impressive. 
 25.2   Geared Heads 
 There is much discussion about the value of a geared head. Certain Directors of Photography 
(DPs) I know dislike the use of geared heads; they express the view that such a mechanical 
device produces a camera movement that is not hand made or personal enough  – I disagree. 
The whole principle of the  “ boat ” on a geared head is that you can both rotate and tilt the 
camera where the center of both movements is the nodal point, or optical center, of the lens. 
The human eye is a ball rotating in a spherical socket where the center of the ball remains in 

166  Chapter 25
the same place, thus never moving up or down, left or right of the optical center of the eye, 
just like the camera on a well-set-up geared head. 
  If those DPs that dislike the use of geared heads could be persuaded to watch a monitor when 
the camera was operated by a truly skilled operator using a geared head, I think some of them 
might change their view. That said, the skill of the operator and their talent for the task will be 
much more in evidence when using a geared head than when on a ﬂ uid head. Talent will out, 
never more so than with he or she who cranks the handles. 
 Underslung or dog-leg ﬂ uid heads are capable of the same centering of the lens nodal point 
but nearly always the need to balance the head puts the nodal point ahead of the pan center. 
 All geared heads have a certain feel to them, which makes different operators prefer different 
makes of head. I am happy to use an Arri geared head, preferring a Mark 1 to a Mark 2; I 
have used a Panahead extensively and like it a lot. On a job some years ago I had been using 
an Arri head for some weeks when it needed to go back to the hire company for some minor 
adjustment that was unwise to carry out in the ﬁ eld; the company rang me to apologize for 
not having a spare Arri in stock and asked me if I would take a Mitchell Lightweight just 
for a couple of days until they could get the Arri back to me. I said yes, of course. I didn’t 
return the Mitchell until the end of the job. Four weeks later I had bought my own Mitchell 
Lightweight. When I operate myself the sheer joy of driving a head you love and are familiar 
with is a very special pleasure. 
 25.3   Remote Heads 
 You should treat remote heads just as you would with a ﬁ lm camera, with one proviso. Not all 
the suppliers of cranes and remote heads are fully up to speed with the requirements of HD 
cameras. Sometimes they forget that whereas most 35   mm ﬁ lm cameras run on 24 volts many 
HD cameras run on 12 volts. The cabling is also very different; the BNC lead that is usually 
used for the ﬁ lm camera’s video assist is unlikely to be of sufﬁ cient quality to be able to 
handle the data stream associated with an HD signal. You will probably get a picture, but not 
a very good one, especially if it is a long crane and therefore needs a long cable run. 
 Even the stop/start plugs and cables are different; zoom and focus may or may not be 
compatible. All these things must be checked long before you arrive on the set. 
 Remote heads are usually controlled by either a joystick or a pair of wheels emulating the 
controls on a geared head. The operator’s viewﬁ nder is now a television monitor. From what 
I have said about my affection for a geared head you will not be surprised that I prefer the 
wheels. Indeed, if an operator chooses the joystick I think the camera movements often look a 
bit  “ clunky ” . 

Camera Supports  167
 If my operator is under pressure when the crane comes out, I sometimes offer to do the crane 
shot for them  “ just to take the pressure off a little ” , which is, of course, just an excuse. I love 
little more than ﬂ ying a camera through three dimensions while  “ ‘ ackling the  ‘ andles ” . And 
it does massage my pride to show the younger members of the crew that some of the older 
members of the crew can still enjoy themselves. 
 25.4  Under Water 
 Underwater cinematography has much the same problems whether you are using a ﬁ lm 
camera or an HD camera. I have done it myself and would now always give the advice  – 
bring in a specialist. In the end a skilled underwater cameraperson will save the production 
time and money and make a difﬁ cult shot look easy. 
 Housings need to be looked at carefully. Most HD cameras are a very different shape to ﬁ lm 
cameras; for a start they tend to be longer, so this should be looked at well in advance of the 
shoot. A number of manufacturers now have dedicated HD housings that work very well. 
 25.5  In the Air 
 I have seen a Sony HDW F900 very successfully mounted on several ﬁ xed-wing and 
helicopter mounts, including the Wescam. In the end there were very few problems. Again, 
the power supply voltage must be looked at in advance. It is a very good idea to make sure 
you can balance the camera correctly well before the shooting day. HD cameras can have 
their center of gravity in a very different place from many ﬁ lm cameras. This can apply to the 
left and right dimension as well as the fore and aft. On the test day it is wise to take along a 
selection of sliding base plates, especially an extra long one, just to make sure you get a good 
and balanced ﬁ xing.  
 25.6  Motion Control Rigs 
 With most motion control rigs you will have no problems other than the balance and voltage 
ones discussed above. There is, however, one fascinating piece of equipment available which, 
unfortunately, I have not as yet had the chance to try out. Panavision have a device they 
have named the Panahub that apparently ﬁ ts on the non-operator side of their version of the 
Sony HDW F900. It will combine a large number of data streams; it can not only lay down 
all the lens data including zoom setting, focus and aperture, but can record many of the data 
streams from the axis controls of a motion control rig. Two of the four soundtracks available 
on the record tape are used so instead of recording sound on them it records metadata 
(metadata    data about data). 

168  Chapter 25
 In theory, at least, this would mean that you could record a take, go away for several weeks 
and, provided you have the nodal point of the lens in exactly the same place on the rig, replay 
the tape and teach the motion control rig to carry out exactly the same shot as you took all 
that time ago. What an exciting prospect that might be. 

169
CHAPTER 26 
 How HD Affects Other Crafts 
 In general, if most of the other crafts on set treat High Deﬁ nition (HD) as a 35  mm shoot all 
will be well. There are a few instances, however, where certain speciﬁ c matters are different, 
so let us look at them craft by craft. 
 26.1  Art and Design 
 In the main, sets and set dressing will need to be every bit as good as for 35  mm; the 
resolution of HD is as good so, if a join is going to show on 35  mm, it will show on HD. 
Colors are much the same but you may have to watch deep or dark reds as they tend to come 
through in the equivalent density but colored orange. This depends very much on the camera 
you are using. The later the camera, the less likely there will be a problem, but it is still wise 
to shoot a test before going into production. 
 There is a very slight tendency to moir é patterning, just as there will be with any pixel-driven 
imaging system, which includes virtually every video camera. Textures having very ﬁ ne 
regular detail should therefore be camera tested at an early stage. As time goes by cameras are 
acquiring more pixels, and better imaging devices and strategies to overcome these problems. 
 Very pure whites can be a slight problem especially when put next to, or in, a very dark color. 
But this is something to keep a watch on even with ﬁ lm. 
 So, in general, few problems for Art and Design. 
 26.2   Costume 
 I have experienced a few problems with our friend moir é patterning on some costumes. Some 
loosely woven cloths can, at certain distances and size of shot, start to shimmer in the classic 
moir é patterning manner. Any materials you think might be even a slight problem should have 
a camera test before you make up the garments. Some check patterns will also have the same 
problem. Costume designers who are experienced in working in television will have little 
problem overcoming these effects as they will be familiar with them, but designers who have 
only ever worked in ﬁ lm would be well advised to have some camera tests shot. 

170  Chapter 26
 It should be noted that these problems are likely to be less than if you were shooting on Digi 
Beta due to the closer density of the pixels on the camera chip and, as I say, cameras are 
getting better all the time at handling these problems. 
 Dark or deep reds can be a problem for the Costume department just as they are for all Art 
and Design. 
 26.3   Make-up and Hair 
 The problems here are different from the previous crafts as there are few color or moir é issues 
but there is a problem with using lens diffusion. It is quite common, say with a hairpiece 
mounted on a net, for the Hair Designer and the Director of Photography (DP) to work 
closely together to ensure the net does not show. With a 2/3-inch HD camera there is less the 
DP can do to help, for a diffusion ﬁ lter that works on a 35  mm camera will be far too strong 
for the rest of the image on an HD camera. Any form of diffusion on HD has to be very light 
as it has a greater effect and this makes it very difﬁ cult for the DP to ﬁ nd that subtle level of 
diffusion where the lace will disappear but the rest of the scene will not look false. 
 HD cameras using a single chip roughly the size of a 35   mm ﬁ lm frame have fewer problems 
as exactly the same ﬁ lters and tricks can be applied as have been used for many years on 
35  mm ﬁ lm, for you will, most probably, be shooting with the very same lenses. 
 The above applies to the treatment of wrinkles on an actor’s face. 
 The only solution the DP has when using a 2/3-inch HD camera in these circumstances is to 
pay greater attention to the lighting, so allowances must be made to give them a little more 
time in this area if the make-up problems are to be adequately addressed. 
 26.4   Sound 
 Sound have roughly the same problems on HD as with most ﬁ lm shoots, although you might 
say the camera crew are going to perceive a problem with the Sound department. It is more 
than likely that the cutting room, and the Producer, will insist that the ﬂ oor-mixed sound be 
fed back to the camera, assuming you are using a camera with an on-board sound recording 
facility, the camera’s soundtracks. This is for two reasons: the cutting room will most likely 
prefer to take their ﬁ rst soundtrack into the off-line edit suite directly from the video tape, 
as this is much quicker and they will almost certainly be conforming the digital audio 
tapes (DATs) later. Secondly, the Producer will see the soundtracks on the video tapes as a 
worthwhile backup of the DAT should there be a problem at a later date. 
 As most camera crews look upon extra cables coming out of the camera as a curse worse than 
a bad cold, much patience and forbearance must be brought to bear. 

How HD Affects Other Crafts  171
 26.5  Script Supervision and Continuity 
 The most obvious difference here is that whoever logs the shots will be working to time code 
numbers rather than footage numbers. On many of the shoots on which I have worked, at 
the end of every printed take the focus puller calls out the focal length of the lens, the focus 
settings, the aperture and possibly the number on the footage counter. Surely the simplest 
thing is for them to simply replace the footage reading with the time code? It is not always as 
simple as that, for on most shoots the time code display will be showing the time of day plus 
the frame number and will be running continuously. There is a pause button on the time code 
readout but it requires some deft ﬁ ngerwork to hit that button as well as shutting the camera 
down after a take. It cannot usually be arranged to happen automatically. 
 As I have suggested elsewhere in this book, the solution might well be a simple digital watch 
set as near as possible to the same time of day as the camera, which the person logging the 
shots can glance at on cut. A better solution might be to get them a script boy, which is a 
clipboard incorporating a time code generator that is locked to the camera every morning and 
has a screen to display the numbers. This can also be ﬁ tted with a pause and restart button so 
that immediately the button is pressed from a stopped condition the time code automatically 
catches up, jumping, as it were, the lapsed time during its off period. This device replaces the 
traditional stopwatch very elegantly. 
 26.6  The Second Assistant Cameraperson or Ex-Clapper Boy 
 Although not strictly another craft, as they are very much an integral part of the camera crew, 
I think special mention should be made here of a few of the changes to their responsibilities 
that have come about with the introduction of HD. The biggest problem they sometimes have 
is, as they are now in charge of the setting up, lining up and cabling of the essential monitors, 
they can easily be run ragged by other crafts persuading them to run extra monitors. It should 
be understood that it is an onerous and responsible task to make sure that both the Director 
and the DP have the monitors that they want when and where they need them, so the second 
assistant will be quite busy enough getting monitors ready for these two senior heads of 
department, especially if there has been a big camera move, without other crafts prevailing 
upon them to supply extra monitors for their convenience. 
 The practice I like is for the second assistant cameraperson to cable, from a single primary 
source on the camera, a feed for the monitor the Director and DP will be using. When this is 
done a second feed, totally independent of the one already fed, is supplied for anyone else to 
tap into. If the DP allows it then the second assistant cameraperson can rig a single monitor on 
this secondary feed for Continuity, Make-up, Wardrobe, etc. to share. It must be understood 
that anything beyond the ﬁ rst monitor on the second feed is nothing to do with the second 

172  Chapter 26
assistant cameraperson  – they will simply be too busy. If any other craft wants their own 
monitor they must ﬁ nd the labor to daisy-chain it from the ﬁ rst monitor on the secondary feed. 
 All this might sound a bit complicated but bear with me for, as I describe in detail elsewhere 
in this book, if a monitor is plugged into the DP’s monitor and that monitor is faulty or 
unterminated then this can lead to the DP lighting quite incorrectly; hence monitor cabling 
discipline is essential.

CHAPTER 27 
 Troubleshooting 
 27.1  Stating the Obvious 
 Forgive me if some of the solutions listed below seem obvious, but I can readily recall times 
when a camera, mechanical or digital, has seemed to fail at an extraordinarily embarrassing 
moment and panic has set in. In a state of panic it has, on one occasion, taken me a full 5 
minutes to realize that the lead leaving the camera was not actually plugged into the battery! 
Hence if you have need to grab this book in order to obtain help with a problem, the obvious is 
also here  –  hopefully you will then realize the lead needs plugging in a little quicker than I did. 
 Professional High Deﬁ nition (HD) cameras are proving to be very reliable; therefore if you 
seem to have a fault do try and troubleshoot it yourself as a touch of ﬁ nger trouble may well 
prove to be the answer. If you have been through all the troubleshooting checks and things 
are still amiss, then more often than not there is little you can achieve on location. Your best 
repair kit is your mobile phone; ring your supplier, they may have good advice and if things 
can’t be made to work will almost certainly ship you a new camera immediately. 
 I was at a London camera rental house recently when there seemed to be a problem with one 
of their HD cameras out in the ﬁ eld that could not be solved on location. Within 2 hours a 
new camera body was on its way, traveling as hand luggage with one of their young engineers 
who, despite having to ﬂ y the length of Europe followed by a long jeep ride the other end, 
had a new camera, perfectly set up to the Director of Photography (DP)’s requirements, in 
the hands of the crew an hour before the on-set call time the following day. That’s service! 
The irony was the problem turned out to be a little lack of experience on behalf of the crew  – 
no matter, these things are to be expected. 
 27.2   Problems and Solutions 
 Please note that these solutions were initially written for Sony cameras, but they give a good 
starting point for most shoots. 
Problem : No image on the monitor. 

174  Chapter 27
Solution : 
 1.   If there is one, have you switched the High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) 
adapter on? 
 2.  Is the monitor powered correctly  – does the standby light glow? 
 3.  Is the monitor set to the correct channel? 
 4.  Check all cable connections. 
 5.  Is the BNC cable of sufﬁ cient quality? 
 6.  Try another BNC cable. 
 7.  Try using the output from the Y, Ph or Pr sockets on the side of the camera. If the image 
is good you may need to change the HDSDI adapter or the down-converter. 
Problem : The monitor is showing coloration in the corners of the image. 
Solution : Degauss the monitor  – there should be a small button somewhere on the monitor to 
do this. 
Problem : No image in the viewﬁ nder but there is an image on the monitor. 
Solution : 
 1.  Is the eyepiece cable correctly inserted into the camera? 
 2.  Is the camera powered correctly? 
Problem : No image through the down-converter  – if using an external one. 
Solution :
 1.  Is the power light-emitting diode (LED) alight? If not, check power cable connections. 
 2.  Check video cable connections. 
 3.  Check power and DIP switches on the down-converter. 
 4.  Check the monitor (see above). 
 5.  If the cable connection is OK it is just possible that the internal camera fuse is blown  – if 
you suspect this call your supplier; it may not be user replaceable. 
Problem : Camera will not power up. 
Solution : 
 1.  Check power cables and connections. 
 2.  Check battery voltage  – try another battery. 

Troubleshooting  175
 3.   If using the mains converter, check the power supply is on. 
 4.  Did the camera overheat and shut off? If it did, let it cool down  – this may take 20 
minutes or so  – and then press the reset button under the rear of the camera. Make sure 
the fan extracts are unblocked. 
Problem : Camera will not record. 
Solution : 
 1.  Is the camera powered correctly (see above)? 
 2.  Is the tape cassette or storage media write protected? Check that the red tab, or whatever, 
is ﬂ ush with the cassette case and not pushed in. 
 3.  Is the Humidity warning display on? If so, dry out the camera and press the reset button. 
 4.  Go into the diagnosis menu and see if anything looks amiss  – DO NOTHING. Consult 
your supplier with your ﬁ ndings.  
 5.  There may be another internal problem  – consult your supplier. 
Problem :  Monitor is too bright when using the component Y, Pb and Pr inputs. 
Solution : The monitor is probably not terminated  – if it has a switch, deploy it; if not, ﬁ t 
termination plugs to the video out socket. 
Problem : Monitor is green when using the component Y, Pb and Pr outputs. 
Solution : The monitor is probably conﬁ gured for an RGB signal rather than a component Y, 
Pb and Pr signal – reconﬁ gure the monitor. 
Problem : Monitor shows a single pixel as a bright and constant color. 
Solution : Perform a black balance repeatedly, holding the black balance switch down for at 
least 3 seconds, until the pixel disappears. It might help to turn the monitor brightness up to be 
absolutely sure the problem has gone away. It may still glow at higher monitor brightness  – keep 
operating the black balance until it disappears. Try this eight or ten times before giving up. If it 
won’t disappear, consult your supplier. 
Problem : Image is vignetting on one side and/or blue ﬂ ickering band at the top of the screen. 
Solution : One of the internal ﬁ lter wheels is almost certainly not perfectly in its indent 
position  – check both internal ﬁ lter wheels. 
Problem : Image has excessive blur when panning. 
Solution : The shutter is almost certainly switched off  – make sure it is switched on and at the 
right shutter speed. Probably the shutter switch on the camera control panel has been moved. 

176  Chapter 27
Problem : Image looks soft  – this might only be noticeable on a 24-inch monitor. 
Solution : Check the back focus on the lens. This will most likely show up if you have zoomed 
in, eye focused and zoomed out; the image will go soft as you zoom out. 
Problem : Footage marks on lens are no longer accurate. 
Solution : 
 1.  Check lens back focus. 
 2.  Are you using a broadcast lens or a ﬁ lm-style lens? Film-style lenses should be measured 
from the notional focal plane, whereas broadcast lenses should be measured from the 
green line around the front of the lens. 
Problem : The camera will not accept external time code. 
Solution : Is the time code set to F-Run? If not, set if to F-Run. 
Problem : No audio signal level on camera VU meter. 
Solution : 
 1.  Check cable connections. 
 2.  Is the input switch situated above the XLR input socket on the back of the camera at the 
proper setting – mic/line? 
 3.  Check the audio in switch  – it should be set to rear not front. 
Problem : Lens Ret  – i.e. record preview  – function on the assignable switch is not working. 
(N.B. Not all cameras have assignable switches.) 
Solution : 
 1.  Is the tape cassette write protected?  – check that the red tab is ﬂ ush with the cassette case 
and not pushed in. 
 2.  Was the last take at least 3 seconds long?  – it has to be for Lens Ret to function. 
Problem : White balance is not functioning correctly  – AWB: NG will appear in the 
viewﬁ nder. 
Solution : 
 1.  If LEVEL HIGH appears in the viewﬁ nder the exposure level is too high. On a Sony 
camera with a conventional lens with a hand grip, switch the lens to Auto Exposure and 
try again. With a Panavision camera set the level of the white card to approximately 70 

Troubleshooting  177
percent – you can do this using the zebra function or, better still, take an incident reading 
immediately in front of the card and use this reading as the stop on the lens.  
 2.  If COLOR TEMP LOW or COLOR TEMP HIGH appears in the viewﬁ nder then you 
are not using the appropriate color correction ﬁ lter in the ﬁ lter wheel. Try different ﬁ lters 
until white balance operates successfully. 
 3.  If LEVEL LOW appears in the viewﬁ nder there is simply not enough light reaching 
the camera head. Either open the iris or add more light to the subject. Do not solve this 
problem by adding gain. 
 4.  If AWB: WHITE PRESET appears in the viewﬁ nder then the white balance switch on the 
side of the camera is set to PRESET – move it to the A or B position where an auto white 
balance can be performed. 
Problem : The audio in not in sync with a down-converted image. 
Solution : The down-converter takes a few milliseconds to carry out its job so you need to 
insert an audio delay box into the audio line. This problem usually only presents itself when 
using a down-converted image for playback.

CHAPTER 28 
 Birthdays 
Birthdays , an early HD production, is an 8-minute short intended for the UK cinemas and to 
be shown at ﬁ lm festivals in order to progress the young team’s careers. There was simply 
not enough in the budget to shoot on 35  mm and as it was intended for cinema presentation 
it would not have been made if High Deﬁ nition (HD) had not just arrived. On this occasion I 
agreed to be the Director of Photography (DP) as I liked the Director, Chris Atkins, and his 
company Stage 2 Screen. He had also written the script, and it gave me the opportunity to 
shoot without making any concessions to trying to make HD look like ﬁ lm. I would light the 
picture like ﬁ lm but would use no diffusion and would not vary the camera settings from the 
Panavision recommended settings for a write-out to ﬁ lm. This way I would discover what 
HD, when shown both as digital projection and as 35   mm ﬁ lm, would look like. 
 28.1  The Studio Shoot 
 The picture was scheduled to be shot in 3 days, with one day to ﬁ lm the  “ interlocutor ” in a 
coved studio where the ﬂ oor would be blue but the walls black so there would be a color for 
the artist to stand on but the background would be a complete void  – not an easy concept no 
matter what you are going to record it on. Further, the Director’s vision of this scene was that 
it would be very severely top lit with the minimal amount of ﬁ ll light. 
 The day in the studio was not scheduled to have much of a lighting budget and the  “ dolly ”
consisted of a tripod on a rolling spider that could run on plastic piping as rails, not my 
normal scene, and I had offered to operate it myself to help with the budget. I love such 
operating when I can and that may have inﬂ uenced my decision to take the job. The  “ dolly ” 
rarely went in exactly the same place twice. As most of the time I only had to keep a mid shot 
on the actor that was not too difﬁ cult, but when we went for close-ups my focus puller was in 
for something of a challenge. 
 The lighting scheme could not have been simpler: two Par cans were rigged next to each 
other in the roof of the studio centered on the artist and very slightly in front of him. The only 
other lighting was an 800-watt redhead bounced off a polystyrene board. Simple, effective 
and when Chris saw the result on our 24-inch monitor he declared it exactly what he had 
envisaged. A good start to the shoot. Realizing that with a totally black background the 

182  Chapter 28
sometimes excessive depth of ﬁ eld on HD was not an issue, for there was nothing there to be 
sharp, I could work without any neutral density (ND) ﬁ lters and at least give my focus puller 
a decent chance; nevertheless with only two Par cans as a key light he still only got T 3.2, 
which with that shifting track kept him on his toes. The  “ panda effect ” look of an actor very 
top lit with dark eye sockets is far from my normal style, but I have to give it to Chris it was 
powerfully effective in this context. The 4-foot square polystyrene reﬂ ector put a nice dot in 
the eyes as well as brightening the eye sockets to a point where I could accept them. I may be 
old school but it seems to me that the script, the writer, the Director and particularly the actor 
might all be wasting their time if it is impossible for the audience to read the meaning on the 
actor’s face. It does not matter how dark the face is so long as you can read what is going on 
behind it. To my mind, most of that communication comes from the eyes, and hence I hate it 
if I can’t see an actor’s eyes. 
 28.2   The Location Shoot 
 The two location days would be all over central London including the Houses of Parliament, 
Millbank, the new Greater London Council Ofﬁ ces, Tower Bridge, some back streets in west 
London, Panavision Europe’s ofﬁ ce and a north-east London ﬂ at. With a lot of locations in 
difﬁ cult parking circumstances with a large camera, it was a good job my young camera team 
liked a challenge! It would have been much easier in some respects if the Sony HDW 900R 
had been available at the time. 
 We were very lucky with the weather, particularly as we only had 2 days to shoot our 
exteriors. It was very bright with big majestic clouds with enough breaks in them to give 
us sun for the shots without waiting around too much. It also gave me a chance to show off 
what the camera was capable of. One of the silly rumors doing the rounds about HD was that 
it wouldn’t handle a bright sky; I had bright skies in abundance so this was my opportunity 
to show that they were not a problem. If you refer to  Figure 28.1 you will see a still pulled 
directly from the HD tape. The scene concerns a chap who works for the police and whose 
job it is to stop people committing suicide, and the chap on the left is trying to throw himself 
off the top of a building site. Even in black and white and reproduced here you can see the big 
sky holding up very well indeed. I assure you it looks even better on the big screen. 
 Because we were going to so many locations and, to ease the parking problems, we were 
traveling in private cars, I decided to work solely from a 9-inch monitor run off batteries. For 
really difﬁ cult shots I would dive under a cloth to check my exposure on the color monitor but 
found I rarely changed it from the setting I had made using the black and white viewﬁ nder. 
When traveling a lot during the shooting day you must be aware that control knobs on both 
the viewﬁ nder and monitor can easily get knocked, so the ﬁ rst thing to do on arrival at a new 
location is to switch the camera on, leave it and the monitor for a few minutes (this can easily 

Birthdays  183
be the time it takes you to set the shot up), then switch the camera to bars output and line 
up both the monitor and the viewﬁ nder. You can get a detailed description of how to line up 
your monitor quickly and efﬁ ciently in Chapter 21. The line-up procedure is exactly the same 
when lining up a black and white viewﬁ nder as for a color monitor, except you simply ignore 
the fact that there is no chroma control. 
 There were several important scenes in  Birthdays where, because of the time pressure, we had 
shot a take before someone turned up with the monitor. With a carefully lined up viewﬁ nder 
I was very pleased with my exposure even when the scene contained one of our big skies. In 
retrospect I think having ﬁ nished product to look at, even be it only in black and white, made 
me braver with my exposure than I might have been if shooting ﬁ lm  – it seemed I was not 
making that little cautious allowance I might when using a spotmeter and this was very much 
to the beneﬁ t of the pictures. 
 28.3  Exterior Tracking Shots 
 There were two major tracking sequences in  Birthdays , one where the camera is static on a 
doorway through which our hero bursts and runs, in proﬁ le, down a street and a second where 
he literally chases after the camera. This being a very low budget production, the only vehicle 
available that was not full of equipment was the Director’s Peugeot 306 hatchback. We did 
the burst through the door and into a proﬁ le run ﬁ rst. I simply got in the back seat, wound 
the window right down and rested the camera complete with the 6 – 27  mm zoom on the open 
window ledge. 
 There are some advantages to a heavy camera. I could have opted to take the High Deﬁ nition 
Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) adapter and battery off one end of the camera and used 
 Figure 28.1 :  A still taken directly from the master HD tape of  Birthdays 

184  Chapter 28
a prime lens on the other end; it would have been just as nicely balanced, but I chose not 
to. A heavy camera clearly has a greater mass and therefore a greater inertia so the camera 
simply does not want to change direction if it can help it. The result was that under the 
initial acceleration the camera wanted to tilt to the right; we were traveling right to left, 
but experience had taught me to expect this, so I had my right hand on the top handle to 
correct this yaw to the right. Once we were under way the inertia of the camera smoothed 
out virtually all the bumps in the road and we had as smooth a tracking shot as I could have 
wished for with a much more sophisticated tracking vehicle. 
 The second tracking shot with the hero running after the camera I approached in a different 
way. Still a great believer in tracking with as heavy a camera as is practicable, I got the 
Director to fold down the back seat of his Peugeot 306 and took a long hard stare at the 
available space. To everyone’s amazement, including my own, we got the camera, again 
rigged with the 6 – 27  mm zoom lens, HDSDI adapter and battery, into the back of the car 
mounted on our baby legs and metal spreader. Again, I was banking on the mass of the 
camera smoothing things out and it did, quite wonderfully. Having got the camera in, the 
biggest problem was getting me and my focus puller in as well; it was a good job we had 
become friends by then as it was a very tight ﬁ t. 
 28.4   Interior Lighting 
 There is one scene in  Birthdays where our hero and his best friend have a drink in a bar. It 
is, supposedly, lit by tungsten light and has a soft, intimate atmosphere. Normally in these 
circumstances I would reach for my ﬁ lter box and add a little diffusion, but you might 
remember I had forsworn such tricks on this shoot. I also wanted to warm up the scene a 
little. Basically the two friends end up having an argument so I wanted this to happen in a 
very attractive environment, thus heightening the conﬂ ict between place and dialog. 
 The warmth I achieved with two crossed key lights from each end of the room; they were 2  K 
blonds and I bounced them both off folding Lastolite reﬂ ectors. I am a great fan of Lastolites, 
particularly on a heavy schedule; they are quick to rig if you use their proprietary universal 
support brackets, are not expensive and give a wonderful light. They come in a variety of 
colors but on this occasion I stuck to gold. 
 The cross keys worked to give an effect I use often; the key for one of the protagonists 
provided the backlight for the other, in both directions. The only ﬁ ll I used was a Mizar 
bounced off 2-foot square of polystyrene board immediately in front of the two shot. The 
lighting plot can be seen in  Figure 28.2 and a still from the master HD tape of this scene is 
shown in  Figure 28.3 . 

Birthdays  185
 28.5  Adding Gain 
 Appropriate though this looked, I still missed some diffusion in front of the lens. I had been 
experimenting to try to grasp what effect on the image quality adding gain to the image might 
have, expecting it to be detrimental; I confess I was quite surprised. On a low-key scene, 
particularly a warm low-key scene, it did not appear to reduce the apparent picture quality by 
any discernible amount but added a certain texture. I know video engineers will tell me that

 Figure 28.3 :  The bar scene from  Birthdays 

186  Chapter 28
what I have really added is picture noise  – I accept this, but it does not look like any video 
noise I have ever experienced before. It looks remarkably similar to moving from a modern 
high-quality ﬁ lm stock of around 200 ASA to an equally high-quality one of around 500 
ASA. These days you will not really notice added grain but there will be a change in texture. 
 Had I been shooting  Birthdays on ﬁ lm I would have gone up to a higher ﬁ lm speed for the 
bar scene; I did not need the added exposure and would have added ND ﬁ lters to counter this 
just as I did with the HD camera. I would have done it solely to get a texture to the image 
more appropriate to the scene. In adding 6  dB (one stop of exposure) to the bar scene I put the 
effective ASA rating of the HD camera up to 640 ASA, very close to the 500 ASA ﬁ lm stock 
I would have chosen if shooting on 35  mm, and I got a surprisingly similar, apparent, effect. I 
have now seen this scene written out to 35  mm ﬁ lm and shown on a large screen and am still 
very impressed with the result, and will most certainly be using this trick again. 
 28.6   Hand Holding 
 In the ﬂ at where the two main characters live they have a fairly violent argument. Chris, my 
Director, wanted this to be a hand-held scene because the camera could then get involved, and 
involve the audience, in the physicality of the scene. I liked this approach but the downside 
for me was that I was operating the camera! Chris felt that several zoom adjustments were 
essential during the scene and the Panavised Sony 900f with a Panavision Digital Primo 4 
1/2:1 zoom on board is a heavy camera. I asked my crew to put the big Anton Bauer battery 
on the back of the camera as I knew that this would make it much better balanced, but that put 
the weight up to the same as a British Army Infantryman’s back pack, around 60 pounds, and 
the army does not, of course, have to carry that load on one shoulder and hold it steady! But 
I did have some tricks up my sleeve, as you can see in  Figure 28.4  . The  “ bull’s horns ” , which 
 Figure 28.4 :  PW hand holding the Panavised Sony 900f  

Birthdays  187
allow you to take control of the camera with handles down in a convenient and comfortable 
position, are an absolute boon in these circumstances. Having made the decision to use them I 
had, of course, no hands left to control the lens or camera, so as you can see in the illustration 
my First Assistant Cameraman (AC1), Alexander Golding, has control of the zoom. At this 
point I think it is right to point out that when hand holding a heavy camera it is absolutely 
essential that you have an assistant or grip to put the camera on your shoulder when the First 
Assistant Director says “ Stand by ” and take it off again the moment  “ Cut ” is called. You 
get far more tired lifting the camera and putting it down than operating the shots. Hence 
it is simply good crew discipline and much to the Director’s advantage to have a less tired 
operator. 
 One thing you have to get used to when hand holding a heavy camera is the sheer mass 
of the thing. It is not difﬁ cult to start a pan but when you want to come to rest on a 
shot you have to start decelerating surprisingly early or you will overshoot the desired 
composition.
 28.7  Editing  Birthdays 
 Chris’s company, Stage 2 Screen, had recently purchased a Targa 3000 off-line editing suite, 
which was capable of handling images in full HD format, so at the end of shooting Panavision 
supplied him with a Sony HDW F500 VTR for an afternoon and he played all the material 
directly into the editing server. Initially there were some issues with producing Edit Decision 
Lists (EDLs) as we had shot at 24P and the Targa was working at 25 frames per second (fps), 
but these were quickly overcome. As this was Chris’s ﬁ rst ﬁ lm on HD he was determined to 
go down the 24P route and make no compromises; it was a brave decision as it was still quite 
early days for HD, but we both learnt so much on  Birthdays that it has stood us in good stead 
on later projects. 
 28.8  Viewings 
 I have now seen  Birthdays on a 24-inch monitor, projected digitally and projected from 
a 35  mm print. I have to say I am very happy with the look of the pictures in all three 
presentation media. It seems that the pictures adapt themselves in some subtle way to each 
type of screen. What we have learnt is that for a top-of-the-range digital projector a tape 
graded on a well-set-up 24-inch monitor looks perfect. If, on the other hand, the digital 
projector is less than top of the range and will therefore not have as full a tonal range, 
making a tape copy with deeper blacks will improve the screen image immeasurably. Peter 
Swarbrick was the ﬁ rst to demonstrate this to me when we went to show another HD movie 

188  Chapter 28
at the National Film Theater in London. We were disappointed in the blacks even after 
carefully setting up the projector when Peter made the blacks deeper simply with a control 
in the VTR. I therefore recommend you make two copies of your product if it is to be shown 
digitally, each to give the best picture depending on the grade of the projector. Do label them 
very carefully though, for if you get the wrong one on the wrong projector you will be very 
disappointed with the result.

CHAPTER 29 
 King Lear 
 29.1  The Project 
 When I was asked if I would like to come on board as Director of Photography (DP) for  King 
Lear , the answer was, of course,  “ yes ” . I had worked on two previous productions with the same 
Producers, Richard Price and Chris Hunt of The Performance Company, and with the same 
directors Trevor Nunn and, again, Chris Hunt. The earlier productions were  Oklahoma! and 
The Merchant of Venice , and I had enjoyed them both tremendously. We had shot  Oklahoma!  
on 35  mm ﬁ lm and  The Merchant of Venice on Digi Beta, but right from its initial conception 
King Lear was destined for High Deﬁ nition (HD), which was very much to my taste. 
 The idea was to take the stage production, which had toured the world, and add a considerable 
amount of extra set onto the stage set. In the theater there was never a heath or battleﬁ eld, sets 
on which some 40 percent of the action takes place, and these would be created, albeit in a 
theatrical way, at one end of the stage at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire in the UK. 
 In the theater the play lasted 3 hours and we were assured that at least half an hour would 
be cut, something all of us who had worked on this kind of performance program doubted 
would actually happen; we were not being the least bit cynical  – when you think about it the 
actors had performed the piece 130 times already and the chances of them remembering the 
cuts after only 4 days of rehearsal for the ﬁ lming were, quite understandably, slim. While 
on the subject of actors, one of the main reasons for loving this kind of project is the sheer 
joy of photographing such talent and experience, and as this cast was headed up by Sir Ian 
McKellen that joy was clearly going to be immense. The rest of the cast were equally good 
and I got particular pleasure from photographing Lear’s three daughters. 
 29.2   The Schedule 
 At the outset the schedule looked very tight; it was, but we made it! We had roughly 12 days 
of serious preparation. This broke down into a week of thinking and designing basic lighting 
rigs, then 3 days of lighting rigging, after which the studio ﬂ oor would be given over to the 
Design department to build the set while we concentrated on cabling the lights we had rigged 
and programming the dimmer board so that we had complete control over all the lamps once 
ﬁ lming started. My initial order was for 144 lamps, so we had our work cut out. 

190  Chapter 29
 The shooting schedule was for two 6-day weeks, each day consisting of 10 hours on camera. 
Tight, as I say, but with four cameras all manned by experienced crews and actors who never 
forgot a line, or a move, it seemed possible and so it proved. Our record was 27 minutes of 
screen time in one day, twice what I had ever achieved before! That was only made attainable 
by everybody’s superb work and planning, and because that day’s script contained two 
soliloquies that enabled word-perfect actors to give us 16 of those screen minutes in only two 
takes each. The two takes were not needed by the actors but enabled the directors to get more 
than 16 shots from those two takes. 
 29.3   Preparation 
 On shoots of this kind I always try to walk on set the ﬁ rst morning of the lighting rig with 
accurately drawn plots of where I want the majority of the lights, and  King Lear  was no exception. 
The ﬁ rst thing I need is a copy of the designer’s ﬂ oor plan and our Production Designer, Eric 
Walmeley, kindly supplied me with a full size plan and an A3 reduction. I scanned the A3 version 
into my laptop using my ﬂ at-bed scanner in two halves, for it only handles A4, and then stitched 
the two halves together in my favorite drawing program, Corel Draw (see  Figure 29.1 ). 
 Figure 29.1 :  Design department ﬂ oor plan  

King Lear  191
 Because of the way my Gaffer, Garry Willis, had planned to rig the set I then drew my 
lighting rigs on top of the set plan, one drawing for each kind of lamp I intended to use. 
Before you look at the lighting plots, please remember that rarely were more that 25 percent 
of the lights going to be burning; I had to have enough lamps, in roughly the right places, for 
over 20 scenes. 
 The basic lighting scheme was to key almost everything from three-quarter back lights and 
have soft ﬁ ll available from the sides and the front of the sets. I also needed a high degree 
of control over the color of the lighting as the script, after an initial procession, starts in the 
King’s library where all is well until his youngest daughter, Cordelia, gives the King an 
answer he misunderstands and seriously does not like  – the plot goes downhill from there. 
I therefore felt that it was important that just the very beginning of the play should have 
rich, well-saturated colors and as things, and the King’s mind, deteriorate, the character of 
the lighting and its color would become less attractive and even at times threatening, thus 
hopefully echoing the course of the action and the dialog. 
 The lighting scheme of keying from behind and soft lighting most other places not only suited 
the script but enabled me to call for a Super Techno 50 camera crane plus a Jimmy jib and 
these, together with two static cameras on tripods ﬁ tted with rolling spiders, provided the four 
camera platforms. It was therefore essential to provide lighting that would not give shadows 
from the two camera cranes as well as being able to light the set dramatically. There was an 
added bonus in this idea for when our sound recordist, a little hopefully, asked if there was 
any chance of being able to use a couple of Fisher booms I was able to assure him that that 
would be no problem, for if I could keep my camera cranes from casting shadows in shot then 
his booms should not be a problem. 
 The ﬁ rst lighting plot I drew was for the 5-kW lamps; this can be seen in  Figure 29.2 . Please 
note that in none of the plots are the lamps to scale; they are merely drawn for easy reference 
by the rigging sparks. As you can see, there are some good strong backlights in position, 
especially down the left of the drawing, which is where our heath was to be built. In the center 
of the plot I hung two 12-foot (4-meter) square Lastolight reﬂ ectors on frames. I had had 
these made for Oklahoma! and found them very effective. The Lastolite facing the castle set 
was gold side to the set and the reﬂ ector for the heath had its white side to the set. Into each 
of these I pointed nine 5-kW lamps. The trick here was that we had steel blue ﬁ lter on three 
of the lamps, straw plus Quarter magenta on another three and three lamps were naked. By 
using this conﬁ guration we were able to mix the three colors to give a nearly inﬁ nite number 
of tones. Furthermore, the lamps on the right of the reﬂ ector were bouncing off it and the light 
headed off in the opposite direction. By bringing up different lamps we were then able to push 
soft and attractive light of an appropriate color into quite discrete sections of the set. It by no 
means gave an overall soft ﬁ ll when used in this way and never ﬂ attened the image. 

192  Chapter 29
 If you look at  Figure 29.3 you can see the rig for my 2-kW lamps. Eight of these were rigged 
with Chimeras so I had the option of bringing in a discrete soft light from almost anywhere 
around the set. It may look like they would ﬂ atten everything but remember that we rarely 
had more than two on at any time so this provided quite discrete lighting, which I often used 
as local key lights for the more low-key scenes. As these lamps were not too high and on 
hoists it took hardly any time to clip colored gels onto the front of the diffusers when needed. 
When we moved on to the heath scenes we moved this rig to face in the opposite direction. 
This was easily accomplished as we had arranged for the supports on each pair of lamps to be 
on independent rollers from the roof, so we knew that we could roll them from one end of the 
studio to the other in just a few minutes. 
 Figure 29.4 shows the rig for most of the 88 Par cans I had ordered. Par cans are often thought 
of as a crude lamp but, handled carefully, they need not produce crude light and they are 
very cheap. Again, we put various colored gels on them and as they were closely grouped we 
could, be simply adjusting the dimmers, provide a wide variety of mixed colors. As we had so 
many and they give a fairly narrow beam with suitable lamps in them, they were often used to 
give a discrete key light on a single actor. The narrow beams of light had the added advantage 
 Figure 29.2 :  5 kW lamps  – lighting rig.  King Lear  – Pinewood Studios 

King Lear  193
that they rarely produced shadows from camera or sound booms. Five Par cans were also 
hidden on the ﬂ oor of the balcony of the castle set to give up-lighting between the columns. 
 The last rig to go in used the nine Source 4 projector lamps I had ordered, as shown in  Figure
29.5 . Five of these, the ones pointing to the left, were used to throw clouds onto the gauze 
background that surrounded the heath. By varying the position of the cloud projected by each 
lamp and altering the focus it was possible to ensure that no two scenes in 4 days of shooting 
ever had the same sky, a great advantage and quick to achieve. The four to the right were 
intended to light the corpses in the last scene but we later abandoned this idea. 
 29.4  Rigging and Equipment 
 Although we were given 3 days to rig the lamps, the Design department were under such 
pressure to get so much into the studio in so short a time we agreed that if there was any way, 
we would try and ﬁ nish early. In the planning week I was sceptical that we could complete 
on time let alone early, but during this week we had a bit of luck. The original plan was to 
use chain hoists to hang trussing from the studio roof. The stage we were using at Pinewood 
is a multipurpose stage and is intended for use as both a ﬁ lm studio and a television studio; 
 Figure 29.3 :  2 kW lamps  – lighting rig – castle. King Lear  – Pinewood Studios 

194  Chapter 29
it had been assumed by us all that using the monopost lamp suspension system that had 
been installed tor television lighting would prove too expensive. When the lighting supply 
company saw the size of the lighting order they suggested that we move to using the 
monopoles and proved that it would not only save the cost of the trusses, but would save 
many man days of riggers. Thus we swapped to the monopoles, which made our rigging 
much easier, cost considerably less, meant the lights went in more quickly and allowed us to 
make changes to lamp positions in so little time we rarely held up the production for more 
than a few minutes. This all gave me a huge advantage as I had assumed that with trussing 
I would not be able to move lights other than overnight, but now I had a ﬂ exibility I had not 
previously expected. It also meant we ﬁ nished our primary rig half a day early and were able 
to hand over the studio to a very grateful Design department. 
 Andy Picheta, our Line Producer, and I have worked together on quite a few projects and 
I have come to trust his judgement on more artistic matters than one would normally expect 
from a Line Producer. The opening of Lear was, in all our minds, some sort of procession 
where Lear’s family and court come to venerate him and we the audience are introduced, 
 Figure 29.4 :  1 kW Par can rig  –  all on 20 lightweight trusses – Yellow add straw gel  – Blue add

King Lear  195
visually, to the main cast. This scene was also going to have all the main titles superimposed 
over it, so it was crucial that it looked stunning so that we did not lose the audience. Andy and 
I were banging our heads together over this scene when I think it was he who said  “ Can’t you 
just put some shafts of light in, a bit like early morning sunlight from high windows in, say, 
Westminster Abbey? ”  “ Yes, Andy, I can! ” So we temporarily borrowed three of the Par 4   s 
from the other end of the set and rigged them as an experiment, dodging between set rigger 
and dressers all the while. The effect looked very good but not quite dramatic enough, so 
Andy allowed me to hire three big projection spotlights. These luminars come from a more 
theatrical background so have a variety of masks and shutters in them, and we were able 
to shape each beam with three straight sides and a curved top, giving very much the shape 
you might get from an old stone window frame. In  Figure 29.6 you can see Andy and me 
checking the effect; we were very pleased with it. I gave Andy a copy of this picture and his 
reaction was  “ I paid for those lights and you are standing in them! ”  – fair enough! 
 In  Figure 29.7 you can see my Gaffer, Garry Willis, sitting in for the King so that I can look 
at the effect of the three-quarter 5-kW backlight coming from the right of the set. The Best 
Boy, Ricky Jones, is on the right with one of the lighting adjustment poles ready to trim the

196  Chapter 29
effect. By this time in the rigging process most of the set was up and ﬁ nal decoration was in 
progress. When they saw this picture the crew immediately entitled it  “ Lear has the decorators 
in ” . You can clearly see at the top of the picture the poles with the Par cans on them, as well 
as one of the few ﬂ oor-standing lamps coming through the door on the right of the set. 
 Due to availability of equipment one camera was going to arrive at the last minute, so towards 
the end of the 2-week rigging period I set up the other three cameras in a variety of shot sizes 
so that we could ﬁ nesse the lighting for as many scenes as possible before we had the actors. 
 Figure 29.6 :  PW, left, and Andy Picheta, Line Producer, checking the lighting for Scene 1  

King Lear  197
 Figure 29.8 shows the cameras on set as we do our best to set the Par cans for over 20 scenes. 
I have always found that by this time in the rigging process it is much more productive to 
light to the monitors, once the cameras are up, as with HD, a good monitor is, after all, the 
ﬁ nished product. 
 29.5  Camera Equipment 
 You may have noticed my slight partiality for Panavision equipment but on this shoot there 
were few alternatives; anyway, I was being asked to produce the highest quality image the 
budget would allow and to do that I wanted the ﬁ nest lenses I could lay my hands on and, if at 
all possible, they should be better than normal broadcast lenses. Zeiss lenses were certainly an 
option quality-wise but they do not produce the range of zoom that we were certainly going to 
need on a schedule this tight. Therefore it had to be Panavision Digital Primo Zooms. Going 
to ﬁ lm-style lenses, and some long ones at that, also meant we had to budget for ﬁ rst-class 
focus pullers in order to pull off the ﬁ lm look with the associated soft background for which 
we were looking. 
 My basic equipment list looked something like this: 
● 
 4    Sony 750 cameras with associated matte boxes and follow focus controls; 
● 
 2    6 – 27  mm Panavision Digital Primo Zooms; 
 Figure 29.7 :  “ Lear has the decorators in! ” Gaffer Garry Willis sitting in for the King 

198  Chapter 29
● 
 2    25 – 112  mm Panavision Digital Primo Zooms; 
● 
 1    9:1 Panavision Digital Primo Zoom; 
● 
 1    Super Techno crane; 
● 
 1    Jimmy jib; 
● 
 1    24-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) Grade 1 monitor; 
● 
 4    9-inch CRT monitors; 
● 
 4    14-inch TFT monitors. 
 And that’s just the basic bits! 
 29.6   The Shoot 
 As I have already said, it was agreed by all that the opening was crucial, so we went to some 
effort to ensure this. In  Figure 29.9 you can see the effect of my three projection spotlights, 
which are lighting some of the courtiers awaiting the arrival of the King and his family. There 
was no other lighting for this scene, for with the help of a little smoke to diffuse the light 
and the light bouncing back from the ﬂ oor, I had all the lighting I needed and this produced 
a most dramatic effect. I had also decided that if small areas of the actors burnt out as they 
passed directly through the spots this was ﬁ ne, it added to the drama and I would happily 
allow this on ﬁ lm, so why not on HD? 
 Figure 29.8 :  Finalizing the lighting on the morning of day 3 of the rig  

King Lear  199
 I did not add any more light throughout this scene and it worked, to my mind, very well. In 
Color plate 12 you can see the ﬁ rst entry of King Lear with his daughter, Cordelia, in the 
foreground. My decision to shoot most of the scenes at T 2.8 was a good one and you can 
see that the King is nicely soft; he will, of course, get sharper as he approaches his daughter. 
Remember part of the plot is about his misunderstanding of this daughter so she is, in effect 
and at this point, seeing her future before her. 
 By careful placement of the actors in the light available, something they were more than 
willing to cooperate with, some wonderful moments were photographed, as you can see in 
Color plate 13, where Goneril is awaiting the arrival of her father. 
 After this very dramatic opening all the royal family and their courtiers move to the King’s 
library, where he intends to divide his kingdom among his three daughters. I wanted this to be 
a rich and slightly saturated scene in the hope that those in the audience not wholly familiar 
with Shakespeare’s plot might just be fooled into thinking that all was well and therefore be 
more intrigued and surprised by how quickly the fate of all the characters goes downhill. 
I therefore gave Lear the traditional rich lighting with a three-quarter backlight, as you can 
see in Color plate 14. 
 Things are going severely awry by the time the plot gets to Color plate 15, where Lear’s 
daughter, Regan, on the left of shot, and her husband on the right contrive to remove the eyes 
from one of Lear’s most loyal courtiers, Gloucester, who is seen seated. This scene, as you 
can see, is severely backlit for effect and to keep a little off the light off the goriness of the 
prosthetics of the eye being gouged. In the movie it is a little more contrasty and quite blue as 
it happens at night. 
 Figure 29.9 :  Courtiers awaiting the entrance of the King  

200  Chapter 29
 As we near the end of the play renegade soldiers hang Lear’s Fool, played by Sylvester 
McCoy. I understand that the fool has never actually been hanged in any other production up 
to this one, but the Director, Sir Trevor Nunn, decided that as very near the end of the play 
Lear has the line  “ And my Fool is hanged! ” there was good reason to graphically show the 
act  – hence you can see in  Figure 29.10 Assistant Director Gemma Fairlie supervising the 
rehearsal of the hanging. Again, in the movie this is a heavily backlit and rather chilly scene. 
 29.7   Practical Matters 
 Although we had a reasonably big stage it always seemed very full. Every space was used. 
In Color plate 16 you can see a shot from above the set in action, in this instance a courtyard 
scene built to one side of the original castle set. On the extreme left you can see one of the 
static cameras and on the right its complementary static so that the directors can get matching 
close-ups. Yes, close-ups! This meant that the focus pullers really had to have their wits about 
them for, as you can imagine, they were right out at the longest focal length their zooms were 
capable of. Although I wanted to shoot most of the ﬁ lm at an aperture of T 2.8 I had, for 
various reasons, achieved this stop with a neutral density (ND) 0.3 ﬁ lter on all the cameras. 
One reason for this was that I wanted good coverage from my lamps and lamps with too small 
a lens don’t give you this so, by getting the coverage with bigger lamps, I was actually getting 
better lighting and was saving the production money, as two smaller lamps usually cost more 
than one larger lamp. This situation allowed me to pull the ND 0.3 on the static cameras when 
the focus pullers ’ job became nearly impossible and allow them a stop of T 4.

Assistant Director, supervising 

King Lear  201
 You can also see in Color plate 16 how cluttered the set can get for even a relatively simple 
scene: two static cameras on each side, a Super Techno crane in the middle, a Jimmy jib over on 
the left of the picture and two Fisher sound booms tucked in between them all. Quite a party! 
 29.8  Monitoring, etc 
 To one side of the stage, the side that was never going to have a set built in front of it, we set 
up the technical control desk, as you can see in Color plate 17. On the very far right, almost 
out of shot, is a smaller desk with the lighting control board and its computer display. Central 
to the picture is my 24-inch Grade 1 monitor, which can be switched to any of the four 
cameras ’ outputs that are monitored by the four 9-inch screens, two to each side of the Grade 
1. Just to the left of the desk you can see my laptop, on which I kept the relevant lighting plot 
for the scene we were shooting. Just to the right of that there is a small box that allows us 
to choose which camera will be fed by the router to the 24-inch monitor. We positioned an 
8 feet    4 feet sheet of black painted polystyrene above the desk to keep stray light off the 
screens and were able to set it at such a height that just by standing up we could see the set 
quite clearly. 
 Right in the middle of the studio and facing the set was the Director ’ s desk, as you can see in 
Color plate 18. For the ﬁ rst 8 days of shooting it faced the castle set, but on the eighth night 
all the camera trainees had to stay late to turn it through 180 degrees so that the Directors 
could now face the heath. They accomplished this with amazing good humor. 
 Working from left to right across Color plate 18, in the bottom left-hand corner you can see a 
small monitor that is fed by a four-way splitter so that it sees all four cameras ’ outputs. This 
was to provide image playback to the Directors and the Script Supervisor when required. The 
playback operator can be seen bottom right and, very important, just to the right of the four-
way split screen are the playback notes, which have to be very accurate so that the Directors 
can call up any scene no matter how long ago it was shot. 
 Central in the picture is the Script Supervisor, Tricia Canavan, whose job it is to make sure 
we are shooting the script as written and rehearsed, where we are in the script and where we 
have come from. Not an easy task with a 3-hour play when anyone, including myself, may 
suddenly get lost or forget the time of day of a certain scene and we only have the Script 
Supervisor to go to. In front of her and the Director to her right are four 14-inch TFT ﬂ at 
screens, each with an individual output from one of the cameras. On the right just in front of 
Trevor Nunn is a 36-inch monitor for director’s playback from the DVCAM playback tapes.

CHAPTER 30 
 The Optician 
 30.1  How It Came About 
 I ﬁ rst met the Director of  The Optician , Jane McGee, when we were both teaching at 
the New York Film Academy in London, she teaching Direction and myself Advanced 
Cinematography. Our ﬁ rst outing together was on a practical exercise and we immediately 
hit it off. I liked her and her work so much I offered to shoot a short for her if she ever had 
a script. It took a couple of years but eventually she sent me  The Optician , which she had 
written  – I loved it immediately! 
 Fortunately it was scheduled for a winter shoot, always a good thing if one is trying to shoot 
something on a limited budget as technicians are usually available and equipment can be 
hired at good discounts. I was able to pull together an ideal young crew and Panavision 
London supplied me with a Sony 750P and a couple of their superb zoom lenses. 
 We had recced (scouted) all the locations, including an optician’s shop in north London, 
and Jane had got two terriﬁ c actors on board, Chris Barrie and Carolyn Tomkinson, when 
3 days before the ﬁ rst day of shooting disaster struck  – we lost the main location. I decided 
to see what I could do before she pulled the shoot so, on the off chance, asked the opticians 
I had been using for over 15 years, Tolley and Partners; they were truly magniﬁ cent and 
immediately agreed to let us have the shop for the weekend. Not only that, when Jane and her 
Producer, Christopher Billows, went to give J.R., my contact there, the fee his reaction was 
 “ I think you need that more than me, just invite me to the premiere. ” Thank you, J.R. 
 30.2   The Shoot 
 We had both day and night scenes inside and immediately outside the optician’s shop, 
exteriors outside together with night shoots in a street elsewhere in London and a short scene 
in a cinema, both in the foyer and the theater itself. We accomplished this in two long days 
and an afternoon and half the following night. Not bad for a movie that lasted 14 3/4 minutes. 
 I was at the time very familiar with the Sony 750P and knew how wonderfully it would eat 
into the shadows at night, especially with the Panavision lens on the front. Also, I knew we 

204  Chapter 30
had a good focus puller, Romain Choay, and therefore I could safely use a maximum aperture 
of T 2.8 on all the interiors and night shots. In fact, I often shot a little wider open and for 
the night exteriors outside the shop, was at T 2. Depth of ﬁ eld, i.e. keeping the backgrounds 
soft, was an issue in pre-production and I was not sure I had convinced Jane and the team 
all would be well. Once we started shooting I was able to prove on the monitor that I and 
Romain could pull off more than they expected. 
 If you look at Color plate 19 you can see a deep two shot where both actors are perfectly 
sharp; this is as it should be, for it is an early scene in the movie and we are still introducing 
the actors to the audience and want them to be able to recognize them clearly in later scenes. 
If you now look at Color plate 20, where we are introducing the optician as a character, his 
image in the mirror, center screen, is perfectly sharp but the back of his head on the left and 
the display of spectacles on the right are delightfully soft  – just as we would hope for if I had 
shot in 35  mm. 
 Later in the plot the optician discovers he has acquired a pair of magical glasses that allow 
him to see 10 seconds into the future when he wears them. If you look at Color plate 21 you 
will see Chris Barrie in medium close-up beautifully isolated against a soft background. If 
you are thinking we were able to use particularly long lenses to achieve this you could not be 
more wrong; the shop simply was not big enough to do this. It is worth noting at this point 
that all the pictures used to illustrate The Optician are actual screen grabs from the master 
HDCAM tape. Again, when the optician’s proposal for a night out with his assistant is ﬁ nally 
accepted, but only due to the intervention of the magic glasses, we go back to another shot 
of him against the shop’s window, in daylight (see Color plate 22), and again we see a soft 
background and a ﬁ ne demonstration of how well good High Deﬁ nition (HD) cameras can 
hold a bright exterior, so long as you get the exposure right. I was only shooting at around 
T 4 as I simply did not have a big enough lighting budget to achieve a smaller stop, so I had 
to rely on the camera’s 11-stop tonal range. 
 The last illustration (Color plate 23) shows a night exterior of the optician having been 
knocked down in the street. The car headlight playing from the bottom of the frame is, in fact, 
a couple of Arri 650  W lamps. 
 The lighting kit was limited so I opted for a Dedo kit, some small Arri tungsten lamps and 
a couple of Kinoﬂ ow ™ lamps. Night exteriors outside the opticians was just a 200-W HMI 
with a half CTO on it to lift the actors ’ faces and the night street in the last scene was the 
street lighting augmented by four Arri 650s, all as backlights, plus two 2-foot Kinoﬂ ow ™ 
lamps hidden near the entrance to the heroine’s ﬂ at as a soft cross key. 
 I believe the secret of pulling off a movie with such a short schedule, and with such a small 
budget, is to keep the lighting really simple and put what little time you have into placing 

The Optician  205
a few lamps in exactly the right place. I was fortunate that I knew the location well and 
therefore needed little preparation time. The shop was predominantly lit by miniature halogen 
lights buried in the ceiling and the display ﬁ tments; the shop designer had done a good job 
so the shop looks really attractive. To obtain the look we had all decided was desirable it was 
necessary to work most of the time at an aperture of no greater than T 2.8, so we spent more 
time taking practical bulbs out of their sockets where they overexposed than adding light from 
our photographic lamps. This was quite a revelation to my young Gaffer. In the UK the Gaffer 
and the sparks do all the lighting and the grips are only concerned with anything that supports 
the camera, unlike in the USA, where the grips do most of the lighting with the sparks only 
being concerned with electricity and its supply. Well, that’s the simplistic view! 
 30.3  How Did It Come Out? 
 When I saw the ﬁ ne cut I was delighted; none of the compromises that are inevitable on a 
shoot with so little time available showed at all and the picture quality was very pleasing. 
Once the picture was ﬁ nished Jane and Christopher hired the Princess Anne Theater at 
BAFTA (see my description of that theater in Chapter 5) for an invited audience. It was great 
that on the huge screen at BAFTA it looked like a real movie and I don’t think anyone came 
out of that cinema thinking about what format we had shot it on. It truly looked the business 
in every department. 
 30.4  Conclusions 
 If you have the right team shooting on an HD camera, having three 2/3-inch chips does not 
compromise the images – it can still look like a real movie.  But you have to have the right 
people who understand the equipment. 
 If you have a terriﬁ c script, the right personalities on board and you shoot in the winter 
months when people and equipment are plentiful you can pull together a great team at not too 
high a cost. 
 If you think your compromises will show they probably will, but if you aim high there is no 
reason why you can’t produce a movie that will stand up as a real ﬁ lm. But you have to be 
well prepared and be quick on the shoot, otherwise you won’t ﬁ nish the movie before the 
money runs out. 
 All the above is only true if you have a really good script  – it all starts there.

CHAPTER 31 
 Cameras in General 
 Since Sony introduced their HDW F900 camera and its HDCAM recording format in the 
year 2000 much has changed, but much has stayed the same. The HDCAM recording format 
is still very much favored as an international exchange format, particularly in the television 
arena, and Sony have introduced HDCAM-SR as a format capable of supporting an even 
higher image quality and, at the top end, this has become the preferred exchange format. 
So, in a sense, what we record our pictures on, particularly when those pictures enter 
post-production, has become nearly as important as the camera we use. 
 The High Deﬁ nition (HD) ground was broken with cameras, in the main, using three 2/3-
inch chips with each chip dedicated to a single color, Red, Green or Blue, and each chip was 
sent only the part of the image that contained that color. This was achieved by using three 
bits of glass, two in the form roughly of a prism, to separate the colors, for this was, and is in 
this conﬁ guration, essential because the pixels on each chip are only sensitive to brightness, 
not color. To date no one has devised a pixel that, independently, can discern color. I have to 
wonder at the fact that the human eye can do this using the cones in the retina, but even in this 
wondrous device, the human eye, brightness is independently assessed by the rods. 
 In the beginning most of these three-chip cameras actually had, and many still have, pixels on 
each chip that conformed to the 1920 pixel requirement horizontally by the 1080 requirement 
vertically. This was no accident for, as you can see in other parts of this book, this horizontal 
and vertical resolution, if handled carefully, can more than fulﬁ ll the current resolution 
expected by an audience in even the largest of cinemas. 
 For a few years the above more than sufﬁ ced but expectations and ambitions moved on. The 
1920    1080 pixel array, even utilizing three 2/3-inch chips, can still hold its own but human 
nature isn’t like that. A favorite author of mine, Bruce Chatwin, suggested that the natural 
state of man (ladies forgive the word, it is generic, and his) is movement. I think he may 
have been right. A picture generated by a camera with 1920     1080 pixels on each of three 
2/3-inch chips is good, very good. But human kind, I suggest, as did Mr Chatwin, does not 
like standing still and therefore, in recent years, cameras capable of even greater image 
quality have arrived on the scene. 

210  Chapter 31
 Those cameras that are capable of much greater image quality than above have, at the time 
of writing, October 2008, come in a number of conﬁ gurations. Most of those looking for 
greater resolution have abandoned the beam splitter and gone for a single chip with each pixel 
ﬁ ltered, in some way, individually. Some of these cameras try to cram even more pixels on the 
chip, which with current technology tends to require a rather larger chip. Others, often using 
similar but larger chips, utilize subpixels so that each of the resultant 1920    1080 pixels 
recorded are formed from even smaller pixels that, hopefully, leads to an apparent increase 
in resolution and, perhaps, a better encoding of color information. Some cameras hold onto 
their greater pixel count and, using advanced recording techniques, not usually tape, then 
offer the prospect of post-production in the higher resolution and, only when the ﬁ lm is 
completely ﬁ nished, reduce this to the international standard of 1920    1080. If one is to 
try to post-produce in the higher bit-rate format, then this requires considerable data storage 
capabilities that, again at the time of writing, are rapidly becoming much easier to obtain at a 
reasonable cost. 
 One of the main advantages of single-chip technology is that, more often than not, it allows 
the camera to photograph through conventional and existing lenses that were originally 
designed for 35  mm motion picture ﬁ lm cameras, thus further enhancing HD’s ability to 
emulate the picture expected by the audience in a conventional cinema. 
 31.1   The Choice of Cameras 
 When I wrote the ﬁ rst edition of this book there were very few cameras capable of 1080P and, 
perhaps, one serious contender that used the 720P conﬁ guration. There are now a plethora of 
cameras to choose from and also a considerable number of recording formats, far too many 
to include here, so I have had to make some difﬁ cult decisions. As you will have noted from 
my comments in Chapter 12, as a Director of Photography (DP) my own decision as to what 
cameras to shoot with comes down fairly heavily on the side of a 1920     1080 progressive 
shooting format, or better. I have therefore decided just to include, with one exception, only 
cameras that meet this speciﬁ cation, the exception being the Panasonic Varicam because of 
its variable frame rate capabilities, which it offers at a reasonable cost. This decision is with 
some regret, for there are some very interesting cameras that use, to my mind, a lesser format. 
However, unless there were very compelling reasons I would have to advise my Director or 
Producer as to my preference. I would be the ﬁ rst to admit that this decision is very much 
driven by the kind of work I do, which I guess makes me a lucky man. 

Cameras in General   211
 31.2  In This Edition 
 This camera section has been considerably revised, with seven new cameras being added, one 
dropped and several updated to new models. HD cinematography has moved on apace since I 
last reviewed the more popular cameras, and that was only 2 years ago! 
 31.3  My Disclaimer! 
 What follows is my personal opinion of each camera. You may feel I have missed out a 
camera you would wish to learn about and consider noteworthy; my apologies but, in the 
main, I have only included cameras that I either know well from personal experience or, at the 
very least, have handled and put through their paces for some hours. 
 I have tried to have all the facts checked by either the manufacturer or a major supplier. There 
may be some errors – I do hope not. The opinions are, of course, entirely my own. 
 So here goes, opinions and all  . . .

CHAPTER 32 
 The Arriﬂ ex D-21 
 32.1  The Camera 
 The Arriﬂ ex D-21 is the new version of the well-established D-20 and remains a delightful 
camera that will appeal, more than most, to someone from a ﬁ lm background. This is 
especially true of the look-through, which is still based on the front end of a typical Arri ﬁ lm 
camera complete with the traditional spinning mirror reﬂ ex shutter with an electronically 
variable opening ranging from 11.2 to 180 degrees. The image from the lens is presented to 
the operator via a viewing screen, again exactly as in the Arricam 435, and utilizes the same 
viewﬁ nder optics and options; of course, the image is in full color, is available even without 
powering the camera and shows an area larger than that being recorded. 
 Figure 32.1 shows the Arriﬂ ex D-21 in full shooting mode. Though the D-21 is superﬁ cially 
the same as the D-20 there are many signiﬁ cant internal changes; indeed, I gather all but one 
of the circuit boards have been updated and some very signiﬁ cant improvements to image 
handling and manipulation have been incorporated, as we shall see. 
 The second most appealing aspect of the D-21 is its build quality  – it feels like an Arriﬂ ex! 
The D-21 completed its takeover from the older model just as I was coming to the end of 
writing this edition, and I spent some time with Bill Lovell at Arri Media who kindly showed 
me over the camera and spent considerable time updating me on the new model. As always 
with Arriﬂ ex, the camera was impressive and the new improvements add to the appeal and 
usefulness of this camera. 
 The basic camera weighs in at around 11 kilograms (some 23 pounds)  – weight that can be 
reduced for use on, say, a Steadicam rig by around 8 pounds by removing the viewﬁ nder 
module, which is quite unnecessary for that application. The camera runs on 24 volts and 
consumes some 50 watts and therefore draws about 2 amps. 
 Arriﬂ ex have continued with their policy of not incorporating a fan into the camera and this 
makes it particularly quiet. The Arriﬂ ex shutter mechanism is virtually silent and the D-21, 
of course, has no intermittent mechanism. The camera has a ribbed  “ brow ” on the top of the 
camera housing to dissipate heat. This is solidly connected to the sensor board and analog-to-
digital processors that, as in most digital cameras, disperse a great deal of waste energy in the 

214  Chapter 32
form of heat. As it is of generous proportions no fan is required and the camera emits a noise 
level below 20  dB. 
 The D-20 had the most simple and intuitive menu system of any High Deﬁ nition (HD) 
camera I have so far encountered and Arriﬂ ex have made the D-21 even clearer, despite 
having added a few extra controls. As before it appears on the on-board camera monitor and 
has two presentations, standard and advanced. Standard mode contains just about everything 
a Director of Photography (DP) would need on a day-to-day basis. The deeper functions, of 
which, again, there are refreshingly few, are hidden behind a four-digit pin number settable 
at the customer’s choice by the supplier. Thus, no one but the DP can meddle with the 
 “ dangerous ” functions in the menu, a very safe procedure. After around 20 minutes playing 
with the single control knob on the back of the camera, which is the sole manipulator of 
the menu system, I believe any competent cameraperson would know all that one needs to 
know in order to control this camera. This is quite an achievement that I feel is the result of 
 Figure 32.1 :  The Arri D-21 in full shooting mode 

The Arriﬂ ex D-21  215
a historic ﬁ lm motion picture manufacturer approaching the problem from the same starting 
point that they have always used. 
 The D-21 has several equivalent ISO sensitivity settings selectable between 100 and 800 ASA 
when outputting in the “ Linear ” mode. It can also output in the Logarithmic mode, preferred 
by some for it does achieve better shadow detail or, at least, shadow detail more recognizable 
as a ﬁ lm-like image. In this Log mode the camera can output images as  “ C ” as in Cineon or 
 “ F ” as in the Film stream (much like the Thomson Viper camera, but without the green cast). 
In Log mode the output is usually a 4:4:4 RGB full bandwidth image with an equivalent 
nominal ISO sensitivity of 200. 
 The D-21 can also output via two BNC cables a RAW  “ Data Mode ” signal, which is now 
very usable as data recording has progressed so far this is now a viable workﬂ ow on set. It 
can be recorded to an S.2 digital ﬁ eld recorder (DFR) hard-disk recorder, or to other suitable 
recording systems. In Data Mode the full output of the sensor with its 2880    2160 4    3 
aspect ratio image is recorded, thus not wasting a single pixel on the chip. This might be very 
signiﬁ cant as, unlike most HD cameras, the Arriﬂ ex D-21 has exactly the same size sensor as 
the ﬁ lm image used for anamorphic cinematography. This means that all anamorphic lenses 
originally designed for 35   mm ﬁ lm productions can be used on this camera. There is no 
discernible pixel fall-off at the extremes of the image so there should be no vignetting of the 
image.
 In Data Mode the output of each pixel is recorded as a 12-bit value, with each pixel assigned 
an R, G or B signature. Only a white balance is applied to this output, which has the 
advantage that it removes the green cast associated with Bayer patterning without creating 
problems in the post-production arena. 
 32.2  Signiﬁ cant Improvements Over the D-20 
 Arriﬂ ex have made improvements to the way the D-21 reduces picture noise. Complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips, as used in the D-21, have a tendency to be noisier 
in the shadows than charge-coupled device (CCD) chips and this has been a bugbear of many 
cameras that use them. Arriﬂ ex have come up with a very elegant solution to this, known 
as correlated double sampling (CDS). During the blanking period – that is, when either the 
mechanical shutter is closed or the equivalent electronic blanking is utilized between frames  –
the D-21 looks at the noise in the blank, black, frame. This will be exactly the same noise as will 
be generated on the chip during the exposure, so by subtracting the signal in the blanked period 
from that in the picture, or shutter open, period that noise is removed from the recorded image. 
 They have also developed something they call Automatic Defect Pixel Correction. This, in 
effect, checks for errors in each and every pixel in the image every time the picture is blanked. 

216  Chapter 32
This is the same as carrying out an extended black balance on, say, a Sony camera, but instead 
of the crew having to do this if they suspect a defective pixel it is automatically checked for 
every frame exposed. 
 The D-21 will run at 1 – 60 frames per second (fps) in HD 16     9 mode, 1 – 30  fps in RAW 
Data 16    9 mode and 1 – 25  fps in RAW Data 4    3 mode. All speeds can be crystal 
controlled with 0.001 fps precision. 
 32.3   The Camera Sensor 
 The Arriﬂ ex D-21 still utilizes the same CMOS sensor as the D-20, having 2880 pixels 
horizontally by 2160 pixels vertically. These pixels are set out on a chip with an active area 
approximately the size of a Super 35  mm frame. Times change not at all, it seems. 
 In order to allow the sensor to output a Red, Green and Blue image, the CMOS chip utilizes 
a Bayer pattern ﬁ lter. The RAW output from the chip will look a little green and, perhaps, a 
little lacking in contrast. Within the camera are simply accessed electronic enhancements that 
will both record, and display, a picture extraordinarily close to the ﬁ nished product that can 
therefore be relied upon to judge the ﬁ nished product and so enables the DP to light to that 
image with conﬁ dence. 
 When shooting in Data Mode it is possible to send the image from the camera to the recorder 
via a ﬁ ber-optic cable and have the recorder interpret the image and then send it back to the 
camera and other monitors in a way that they can interpret and that the DP can rely on to 
light. In effect the recorder uses look-up tables (LUTs) to convert the image into something 
very near the ﬁ nal product. 
 The sensor has, as the above format would suggest, a 4     3 aspect ratio so it has to be 
approached with a certain amount of understanding as to how to use it in the wisest way. If 
using exactly the same lenses you would use when shooting Super 35   mm you will get the 
same look and feel as if you had shot Super 35  mm ﬁ lm, depth of ﬁ eld and all. Equally, of 
course, when utilizing the Data Mode (which outputs from the complete 4    3 area sensor), 
existing PL mount anamorphic lenses will allow an optical squeeze to be applied to the image 
while using the full resolution of the chip for ﬁ nishing in a 2.35:1, or 2.4:1, aspect ratio. 
 If you wish the camera to output a 16     9 HD compatible image then the camera will read a 
central slice out of the chip utilizing 2880 pixels horizontally, the full potential of the chip, by 
1620 pixels vertically, thus giving a true 16    9 picture. Clearly this is not compatible with 
the HD 16    9 standard of 1920 pixels    1080 pixels. No matter, for internally the camera 
can convert the original pixel array to the HD pixel requirements. It does this so successfully 
that a certain increase in apparent quality is obtained, particularly in respect of aliasing (as in 
the lack of it!). 

The Arriﬂ ex D-21  217
 I believe Arriﬂ ex are about to announce a new approach to HD anamorphic shooting that 
they have named the  “ M Scope ” format after Milan Krsljanin, who developed the idea. Using 
two BNC cables this will deliver the whole picture but, by doubling the output to two 4:2:2 
streams to an SRW-1 recorder (a system originally intended for 3D recording), will maintain 
a full-resolution anamorphic picture. 
 The way the sensor, and its electronic processing, behaves allow excellent keys to be obtained 
from both blue- and green-screen shooting. 
 32.4  Interface 
 At the rear of the D-21 there are a number of connectors. It is possible to have up to three 
output boards ﬁ tted to the camera but it is normally supplied with only two, as this has proved 
to be more than sufﬁ cient for most shoots. The output sockets can be seen in  Figure 32.2 . 
 Figure 32.2 :  The Arri D-21 showing the outputs and inputs available  

218  Chapter 32
 With two output boards it is easy to get outputs as High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface 
(HDSDI) (4:2:2 and/or 4:4:4) or Data together with analog PAL or NTSC. If you are working 
with 4:4:4 HD then you will need to utilize two of the four output sockets as 4:4:4 needs two 
BNC cables to transfer the required amount of data in that form. 
 32.5   Lenses 
 Any lens with an Arri PL mount that will cover the image size you wish to shoot on, right up 
to a full Super 35  mm format, will be suitable for this camera, thus giving one the same feel 
to the picture as you would achieve on 35  mm ﬁ lm. This, of course, includes standard 35   mm 
anamorphic lenses; there are no other HD cameras that can do this at present.  
 32.6   Recorders
 All HD cameras ’ output can be recorded on something. Most can even be recorded on 
something convenient. In recent times data recording has come a long way and it is now 
possible to record a 4:4:4 HD output onto an on-board ﬂ ash drive, or FlashMag as Arri call it, 
as can be seen in  Figure 32.3 , where the camera is rigged for hand-held use. The FlashMag is 
a solid-state Flash RAM device capable of recording 10 minutes of screen time in 4:4:4 mode 
 Figure 32.3 :  The Arri D-21 in hand-held mode with a FlashMag attached  

The Arriﬂ ex D-21  219
or 15 minutes in 4:2:2 mode. If shooting requirements demand it, the FlashMag can be a very 
useful device. 
  It is still possible to output the data as RAW or as an image to an SRW-1 recorder, as shown 
in  Figure 32.4 . The SRW-1 video tape recorder (VTR) can record the 10-bit HD signal in a 
4:2:2 or a 4:4:4 format with approximately 2:1 compression, known as HQ (High Quality), 
when shooting at 24  fps and in this mode the tape will last for 25 minutes. It can also record 
in the 4:2:2 format, known as SQ (Standard Quality), with approximately 4:1 compression 
and then a tape lasts for 50 minutes at 24   fps. 
 The SRW-1 is powered by 12 volts DC and consumes around 10 amps, which means that it 
will run for between 2 and 2 1/2 hours on a standard 12-volt block battery. There is, of course, 
a mains unit available that is tolerant of ﬂ uctuating voltages so it can safely be run from the 
production’s location generator. 
 If your picture needs a lot of compact camera work where a separate recorder may be a 
hindrance and you decide to go for FlashMags, then this simply needs a slight reorganization 
of the camera crew’s responsibilities. The crew member who used to be known as the loader 
on a ﬁ lm shoot now becomes a downloader. FlashMags are expensive, it has to be admitted, 
but with a little organization the person who used to have their hands in a changing bag 
now needs to be transferring the FlashMag data to, probably, a Sony SRW-1 tape recorder 
or alternatively an uncompressed disk recorder  – as onerous and important a task as being 
responsible for opening a ﬁ lm magazine with raw rushes in it. Long live the loader!

CHAPTER 33 
 The Dalsa Origin and Evolution 
 33.1  The Dalsa Origin 
 By any standards the Dalsa Origin is an extraordinary camera. Dalsa have produced a camera 
with an absolutely  “ no compromise ” approach to picture quality. It is widely accepted that a 
35  mm camera negative has an inherent resolution that, in the electronic world, is regarded as 
4  K resolution, which means the picture can deliver 4000 samples horizontally. This means 
that if you sample an image 4000 times across its width this will provide the same resolution 
as with a photographic image on a single frame of 35  mm ﬁ lm camera negative. The Origin 
can undoubtedly do this  – but, possibly, at some inconvenience downstream in the production 
process. For an argument as to whether one needs this sampling rate, and when one does, see 
elsewhere in this book. Nevertheless, if your post-production workﬂ ow requires, or needs, a 
full 4  K master and that master needs to be digital and have a 4  K horizontal resolution, then 
the Dalsa Origin will look very attractive. 
 There is another point. Let us say you are working on a high-budget production and your 
Director or Producer thinks they are making a ﬁ lm that will become a classic; there may then 
be a strong argument to store, for prosperity, an original master copy equivalent to a 35   mm 
negative and in those circumstances, the Origin has a good argument in its favor  – 
provided you can store all that data, which will become easier in time. 
 In essence the Origin outputs what is described as an uncompressed RAW 4  K signal 
equivalent to a ﬁ lm negative, if you like. It, like ﬁ lm, needs  “ printing ”  in post to realize its full 
potential. To try to put this in a more technical context, a 4  K RAW ﬁ le from Origin is roughly 
16  MB per frame, whereas the full RGB ﬁ les are 48  MB per frame  – clearly a huge saving in 
storage needs. 
 The sensor is slightly wider than the distance between the outside of the perforations on 
standard 35  mm ﬁ lm. This is considerably wider than the image size of a Super 35 frame and 
here lies the ﬁ rst of the Origin’s quirks. While the camera is doing more than most to replicate 
the image quality of 35  mm camera original negative, and will have a very similar depth of 
ﬁ eld to the image, if not a fraction less, not all the available 35   mm lenses will cover a frame 
this big, but with careful selection many popular lens sets will. 

222  Chapter 33
 While the Origin can give a fantastic resolution and, having seen pictures from it I can only 
say they are superb, to a ﬁ lm person’s eye the camera itself is not an appealing sight. If you 
look at  Figure 33.1 I can’t help wondering if you would agree with me that it does resemble a 
black, shiny, desktop computer tower with a lens stuck on one corner. A three-quarter view of 
the camera as seen in  Figure 33.2 shows it in a more ﬂ attering light, but you have to admit it’s 
a bit of a lump. 
 33.1.1  The Look-through 
 The Origin, in that corner of the box with the lens, has a mechanical front strongly 
resembling an Arriﬂ ex ﬁ lm camera body. Therefore, very like the Arriﬂ ex D-21, you get 
an image in the viewﬁ nder that will be very familiar if you are used to shooting with ﬁ lm. 
It is a good look-through but, as with all cameras choosing this route, operators may love it 
but it tells the Director of Photography (DP) nothing about the recorded image. This is not 
usually a problem, for most DPs working in High Deﬁ nition (HD) have long ago learnt to 
look at a high-grade, well set-up, monitor in order to judge their work. The markings on the 
viewﬁ nder viewing screen are, again, those you would expect in a 35  mm ﬁ lm camera  – all 
very reassuring. 
 Figure 33.1 :  The Dalsa Origin 

The Dalsa Origin and Evolution  223
 33.1.2  The Sensor 
 The scanned area is an array of 4096    2048  – that is, a 2:1 aspect ratio of which 
4046    2048 are optically active, giving a picture aspect ratio of 1.98:1. This differential is 
because the sensor utilizes 50 optically dark columns to provide a dark reference for signal 
processing purposes. 
 The sensor also utilizes a Bayer mosaic color ﬁ lter and with the Origin’s dedication to the 
purest image possible the interpolation of the Bayer pattern is left as a post-production 
matter. Alternatively it can output RAW data using 16 linear bits per pixel, which can be 
 Figure 33.2 :  The Dalsa Origin 

224  Chapter 33
reconstructed externally. Unreconstructed Bayer pattern images are often referred to as a 
 “ digital negative ” , for they need processing to arrive at the desired viewable image. Again, see 
elsewhere in this book for an explanation of Bayer ﬁ ltering.  
 33.1.3  Interfaces 
 The Origin outputs each frame as a DPX ﬁ le with 16-bit linear data. If one multiplies the active 
pixels, 4046    2048, this means there are 8  , 286  , 208 pixels per frame. Given the camera works 
in a 16-bit environment, then the camera needs to record 132  , 579  , 328 bits of information per 
frame or 3  , 181 , 903 , 872 bits of information per second if you are shooting at 24 frames per 
second (fps). The data rate for the RAW 4       K 16       bpp at 24       fps is 420 MB/second  –  still pretty 
formidable but becoming much more manageable. 
 At this bit rate conventional monitors and data recorders may not be able to cope. In order to 
overcome this Dalsa have given the Origin a conventional computer-type TV interface on the 
back of the camera, which enables just about any laptop computer to become a monitor. 
I viewed some pictures this way when I saw the Origin in London and was very impressed 
with the quality. This interface is the third socket from the top in  Figure 33.3 . 
 For recording purposes an interface capable of far greater data transfer rates is needed and the 
Origin provides this with an elegant solution. Using a military quality four-core optical cable 
all the necessary data can easily be outputted. Another access point on the back of the Origin 
allows for this very slim optical pipe. The diameter of the  “ cable ” is around 1/4 inch (6   mm) 
and is immensely strong and ﬂ exible. Interpolator boxes for this kind of data transfer are not 
that difﬁ cult to come by provided they feed a recorder that can cope with this data stream. 
 33.1.4  Conclusions on the Dalsa Origin 
 The Dalsa Origin is without doubt a formidable camera. Large ﬁ le data storage is becoming 
easier and more practical almost by the month, which will make the recording and storage 
problems of the Origin seem almost trivial in the relatively near future. 
 33.2   Currently Available Recorders 
 As discussed above, while the Origin gives a very impressive and high-resolution picture its 
output, in terms of the quantity of data, does leave it with some problems ﬁ nding a currently 
available recorder capable of doing it justice. Flash RAM drives and disk arrays will do the 
job but rarely have a reasonable recording time compared with a ﬁ lm camera and can be 
mighty expensive. But, as I say, data storage problems are easing in short order. 

The Dalsa Origin and Evolution  225
 33.3  The Codex Digital Media Recorder 
 When I  “ met ” the Dalsa Origin camera in London it was linked to a laptop via the interface 
described above, as well as to a most extraordinary piece of equipment with which I was 
most impressed, the Codex Digital Media Recorder. Given that most recorders capable of 
dealing with very high bit rates are, at the time of writing, both expensive as an item and use 
very expensive data storage that rarely has a recording time much longer than a single roll of 
ﬁ lm, and costs a great deal more, the Codex, while not being that cheap, does seem to address 
these matters in a way I have rarely seen bettered. It is also exquisitely made and, particularly 
if you admire Kudelski Nagra, very elegant and appealing to the eye. 
 The Codex, as you can see in  Figure 33.4 , where it is shown in its transit housing, is a 
relatively compact unit given the data it can store and those data are quite astounding for an 
on-site recorder. At the bottom half of the Codex you can see a couple of handles. Each of 
 Figure 33.3 :  A rear view of the Dalsa Origin showing the interface options  

226  Chapter 33
these is the front of a removable disk pack and each disk pack can store 720 gigabytes (GB) 
of information; 360   GB packs are available. If one utilizes two disk packs, both of which are 
720  GB capable, then 54 minutes of 24  fps 4  K images, uncompressed and in full 4:4:4, can 
be recorded. If you are working with an output conforming to the 1920     1080sF format but 
still wanting a 10-bit 4:4:4 RGB at 24  fps, then one disk pack alone will record 50 minutes of 
screen time. 
 It should be noted that the disk packs have RAID-3 protection against drive failure and can be 
 “ hot swapped ” , thus reducing reload time to virtually nothing. 
 33.3.1  The Touch Screen 
 I took the photograph for  Figure 33.4 indoors with a reasonably powerful ﬂ ash and, as you 
can see, the screen is still very bright and clear. I questioned Codex about this and their 
answer was simple and very much to the point:  “ You have to be able to see it clearly in 
daylight. ” Quite! But how many times have you had to shield a display screen and struggle to 
see it even when you are not in full sunlight? Another pointer to how well the Codex has been 
thought out and designed. 
 Figure 33.4 :  The Codex Media Recorder 

The Dalsa Origin and Evolution  227
 33.3.2  Monitoring via the Codex 
 Again, the Codex comes with an elegant and simple solution for monitoring an input from a 
camera like the Origin. While shooting you can get a High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface 
(HDSDI), a Standard Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (SDSDI) or several other signals 
out of the Codex, for it contains its own down-converters. Sound and time code are equally 
provided for. 
 33.3.3  Conclusions on the Codex 
 At the time of writing I have not come across another recorder with the capability to accept 
the huge data streams that the Codex copes with easily. More important, perhaps, to my eye 
expecting a quality associated with ﬁ lm equipment, I have not seen a recorder as beautifully 
designed and built and as intuitive to use. 
 33.4  The Dalsa Evolution 
 Right at the time of writing Dalsa announced their new camera, the Evolution. As it has not 
made the UK yet I can only look at their website and report. Very much as one would expect, 
its speciﬁ cation closely follows that of the Origin but they have made the camera considerably 
smaller and managed to reduce the weight by some 20 percent without taking away any of the 
original features. The new shape makes the prospect of hand holding the camera much more 
attractive and the new conﬁ guration also reduces the acoustic noise. 
 Although the chip and processor remain the same high quality, work has been done to greatly 
improve dust protection in the sensor cavity, a problem that needs addressing with most 
single-chip cameras. 
 All in all, the Evolution looks as if it is what it says, an evolution of a very interesting camera.

CHAPTER 34 
 The Panasonic VariCam: AJ-HDC27H 
 34.1  The Camera 
 The VariCam is unusual compared with all the other cameras I review here, for not only can 
it shoot at any constant frame rate between 4 and 60 frames per second (fps), but it is capable 
of changing the frame rate during a shot, known in the ﬁ lm world as ramping. It is also the 
only camera here that has a native 720P, 60 fps (or 59.94 fps) image conﬁ guration. You will 
have gathered that I favor a 1080P shooting format, but if you need the facility of variable 
frame rate offered by this camera then the compromise simply has to be worth it. It should 
be remembered that subjectively 720P and 1080i look almost as good to the eye and 1080 
usually only looks signiﬁ cantly better when shot in the progressive format. This means that in 
a television arena the VariCam should be capable of excellent pictures. 
 The camera always shoots at 60 fps but an extra code is added to the time code that records 
the frame rate you have chosen. The camera cannot replay the pictures at anything but normal 
speed but when the pictures are played back through a frame rate converter or on a video tape 
recorder (VTR) that includes a frame rate converter then the pictures will be displayed, and 
can be re-recorded, at the speed you intended at the time of acquisition. 
 Panasonic have put considerable work into generating internal Gamma curves, i.e. 
CineGamma ™ , and although I try not to use them I have to say that many of my colleagues 
like them very much indeed. I would suggest, though, that if you are going to use them you 
don’t just check you like the look created on a monitor but record some pictures and check 
them on playback, preferably in the post suite you are going to use, and make sure the people 
handling your material are happy with this approach. 
 As you can see from  Figure 34.1 the camera is of a pleasingly compact design with the 
switchgear in roughly the same place as most other professional camcorders. This, at least, 
makes it much easier for a Director of Photography (DP), or the crew, to swap between 
products as the needs of a shoot dictate. 
 The camera has a native sensitivity equivalent to 640 ASA (ISO) when shooting at 24 fps in 
its normal 720P mode. 

230  Chapter 34
 34.2   Frame Rates 
 As the camera always records at 60 fps to obtain a frame rate of 24 fps the frame rate 
converter will utilize the classic 3:2 pull-down frame sequence so familiar in the American 
television environment. With some of the other frame rates life gets a little more complicated. 
At 25 fps, the European television standard, the frame selection from the full 60 frames will 
go as follows: 
 Frame 1, frame 4, frame 6, frame 9, frame 11, frame 13, frame 16, frame 18, frame 21, frame 
23, frame 25, frame 28, frame 30, frame 33, frame 35, frame 37, frame 40, frame 42, 
frame 45, frame 47, frame 49, frame 52, frame 54, frame 57 and ﬁ nally frame 59. 
 In other words, the frame rate converter is working on a selection pattern of: 
 3    2    3    2    2 and then starting that sequence again. 
 Somewhat complicated, but it appears to work. If you are replaying at 30 fps the frame rate 
converter simply takes every alternate frame  – much simpler. 
 34.3   Exposure Times 
 The VariCam has two ways of setting the exposure, either by nominating a shutter opening 
in degrees, just like a ﬁ lm camera, or setting an actual fraction of a second for each frame. 
Clearly, as the camera always works at 60 fps, the maximum exposure time that can be 
adopted is one-sixtieth of a second, which is, in effect, shutter off. Shutter speeds of 1/100, 
1/120, 1/125, 1/500, 1/1000 and 1/2000 are also available. 
 Figure 34.1 :  The Panasonic VariCam (AJ-HDC27H) 

The Panasonic VariCam: AJ-HDC27H   231
 The advantage of being able to choose between a shutter speed and the equivalent of a shutter 
opening is that with a shutter speed you get the same exposure on each frame, whereas with 
the equivalent opening the exposure per frame changes in relation to frame rate. Both have 
advantages in different applications. If you are going to ramp the frame rate, being able to 
have a constant exposure on every frame could be a very considerable advantage and make 
life very easy compared to shooting the same shot on ﬁ lm. 
 34.4  The Chips and the Processor 
 The VariCam utilizes 2/3-inch chips, as do all the three-chip cameras described in this book, 
with 1280 pixels horizontally and, as you would expect, 720 pixels vertically, and although 
multiplying those numbers gives 921 , 600 Panasonic assure me that each of the three chips 
actually has 1  , 019 , 280 pixels, certainly enough for the 720P High Deﬁ nition (HD) standard 
but roughly half the number used on a chip that can fully support the 1080P standard. I can 
only express my personal opinion here  – it works on television but I would want those extra 
pixels for cinema release. 
 The camera head utilizes a 12-bit processor that is impressive though, of course, there has 
to be some compression in order to get all those data down onto tape. Here the lower pixel 
count becomes a positive advantage, for it substantially reduces the total data that need to be 
recorded.
 34.5  The VTR 
 Panasonic favor the HVCPRO HD recording format with which they have considerable 
experience in its earlier guises. The format is also referred to as DVCPRO HD. The VTR 
records in an 8-bit format, so there is some compression involved to bring the camera head’s 
12-bit format down to the capabilities of the VTR. 
 This format is well established and there are a multitude of VTRs etc. to support it, though 
not all will replay at anything but 60 fps. 
 34.6  Time Code 
 The camera generates 30-frame time code so problems can arise when shooting at frame 
rates other than 30 fps, when locking several cameras together or when ramping the frame 
rate. The solution is to use external time code generators such as lock-it boxes. When using 
external time code the time code so generated should be recorded on Audio Channel 2, for 
time code works in audio frequencies. Clearly it will be necessary to inform whoever is 
handling the post-production that you have made this decision. 

232  Chapter 34
 34.7   An Overview 
 This is a very clever system; I say system for its cleverest trick cannot be viewed without 
additional equipment, frame rate converters of one kind or another. That said, at the time of 
writing no other HD camera can change its frame rate with such alacrity. As a result of it 
really being a system one has to be aware that the camera images may not be what you get in 
post-production and it is therefore very important that you shoot tests to conﬁ rm the correct 
shooting procedure required to give you the pictures you want. Having done this, shooting 
requirements should be quite simple. Time code also has to be addressed if shooting at any 
speed other than 30 fps. If you are going to use the camera’s in-built Gamma curves these too 
should be passed by the post house before shooting commences. 
 All this said, if a 720P image format is not a problem for you and you would ﬁ nd a large 
range of variable frame rates an advantage, then this could be the camera for you. Both its 
purchase price and rental price are surprisingly competitive.

CHAPTER 35 
 The Panavision Genesis 
 35.1  The Camera 
 The Genesis reminds me of the old joke that goes  “ If it looks like a duck, talks like a duck 
and walks like a duck  – then it’s a duck! ” I am fairly conﬁ dent that if you walked onto a set 
without knowing it was a High Deﬁ nition (HD) shoot and glanced at the camera you would 
assume it was a Panavision Millennium. Just take a quick look at  Figure 35.1 . If you gave it a 
second cursory glance you might think it had an unusual viewﬁ nder and the futuristic 65   mm 
400-foot magazine was new to you. Further enhancing the feeling that this was just a slightly 
unusual ﬁ lm camera would be the intelligence that the camera crew were behaving exactly as 
you would expect from a normal ﬁ lm crew. Personally I have never worked with a completely 
normal ﬁ lm crew, but that’s entirely another matter. Believe me, it looks like a Panavision 
Millennium, is as quiet as a Millennium and the crew runs it like a Millennium  – therefore, 
 Figure 35.1 :  The Panavision Genesis 

234  Chapter 35
it’s a Millennium; well, more or less. Except, in some ways, it’s better, it is a Genesis and if 
you like ﬁ lm and you also like HD then this camera could be for you. If you look at  Figure 
35.2 you will see the camera with the alternative Sony viewﬁ nder, ﬁ tted with a Primo prime 
lens and a focus puller’s HD liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. 
 You can mount the  “ magazine ” , which is in fact the video tape recorder (VTR), either on 
the top of the camera or at the back, just as you have been able to do with any Panavision 
camera for several decades ( Figure 35.3 ). As the camera utilizes a single charge-coupled 
device (CCD) chip similar in size to a Super 35  mm frame, virtually all the lenses Panavision 
normally supply for 35  mm photography will ﬁ t this camera, the lens mount is identical, and 
they will produce, again exactly, the same feel to the image and the same depth of ﬁ eld. 
 Being a camera derived, at least philosophically, from Panavision’s more than 50 years in 
the motion picture business, this camera will accept just about all the accessories you could 
attach to a Panavision ﬁ lm camera and they will function and feel just the same. 
 It may seem strange that Panavision, with all their access to ﬁ lm camera bodies, have not 
gone down the route of utilizing a spinning mirror shutter. Apparently their thinking when 
designing this camera isolated a number of issues attached to optical viewing, two of which 
 Figure 35.2 :  Panavision Genesis with a prime lens, the Sony viewﬁ nder and an eyepiece leveler 

The Panavision Genesis   235
seemed to them to militate strongly against such a path. First, cameras designed for theatrical 
release tend to be heavy and opting for electronic rather than mechanical viewing reduced 
the body weight by some 3 – 4 pounds. Secondly, there is an inherent problem with single-
chip cameras – dirt and dust on the sensor. If it gets there it stays there, unlike ﬁ lm, where 
dirt within the frame, as against a hair in the gate, moves away with every frame. Panavision 
have utilized the space freed up by not deploying a spinning mirror to seal a cavity between 
the actual sensor and the surface on which dust may arrive. The distance between the sensor 
and this surface is sufﬁ cient to ensure that any dust particle will be so completely out of focus 
within the image arriving at the sensor that it is impossible to discern its presence. 
 A further advantage of not deploying a mechanical shutter is that the camera can be set to 
have an equivalent shutter opening of between 3.8 and 360 degrees  – as in  “ Shutter Off ”  – 
allowing some interesting effects to be obtained. The shutter angle affects exposure in exactly 
the same way as with a traditional ﬁ lm camera, so if you choose to shoot at a 360-degree 
setting then you will get one stop more exposure than at the more regular setting of 180 
degrees, which is ﬁ ne so long as you are happy with the additional motion blur you will be 
photographing.
 Figure 35.3 :  Panavision Genesis with the VTR back mounted  

236  Chapter 35
 If you wish to reduce the camera to its minimum proportions and weight, it is possible to 
introduce a cable between the camera and the VTR. This in no way reduces the quality of 
the image nor takes away from the number of available controls. The control unit, as shown 
in  Figure 35.4 , can be connected via an extension cable and does not have to be permanently 
mounted to the VTR itself. 
 Figure 35.4 :  The Genesis VTR control unit 

The Panavision Genesis   237
 Unlike most cameras that utilize the Sony SRW-1 recorder, the Genesis does not need the 
additional interface unit, which is as big as the VTR itself, since all the necessary connections 
are made directly when docking the recorder to the Genesis body. In addition to this, the 
camera and VTR have a bidirectional control link that ensures the two are always correctly 
conﬁ gured for recording format, frames per second (fps) and so forth; this also allows the 
camera to include a VTR run switch and to receive feedback from the VTR. 
 The camera and the VTR are capable of running at any speed between 1 and 50 fps, in 
addition to which are several commonly used preset frame rates. These are 23.98P, 24P, 25P, 
29.97P and 30P. In addition, you can select 50i, 59.94i and 60i. The camera will not ramp 
between speeds. 
 35.2  Menus 
 The camera menus are very similar to the Sony 900 menus, with a few additional pages such 
as the variable speed option etc., though Panavision take a different philosophical approach to 
how one should treat them. Panavision’s view is that they would prefer to set the camera up 
for what they consider to be optimum performance and then suggest to the client they leave 
well alone. Personally I like this approach. All the original menus are still readily available 
should you wish to personalize the camera, with the exception of one. 
 35.3  White Balance 
 You cannot white balance a Genesis for neither can you white balance a ﬁ lm camera; instead, 
you use ﬁ lters and the menu set-up Panavision prefer is tailored to the use of standard motion 
picture ﬁ lters for all your color correction. 
 35.4  The Camera Sensor 
 The Genesis uses a CCD chip having 12.4 megapixels. To obtain an HD image utilizing 
the standard 1920     1080 pixel array, each HD pixel is formed by six subpixels. No Bayer 
pattern ﬁ ltration is used; instead the subpixels are color ﬁ ltered in the traditional Red, Green 
and Blue manner and then arranged so that three horizontal and two vertical subpixels come 
together to form one complete RGB macropixel in the 1920     1080 arrangement. By having 
six subpixels form each macro HD pixel, the picture quality is substantially increased and the 
problems of aliasing are just about completely eliminated. 
 The use of pure, singly ﬁ ltered, CCD pixels brings a further beneﬁ t: all three colors are output 
at precisely the same resolution and relative sensitivity, so there is no green bias in the image 
as is the case with a camera using Bayer pattern ﬁ ltration. 

238  Chapter 35
 Arguably, say Panavision, the combination of the sensor size, the number of subpixels and the 
use of a CCD sensor brings the optimum combination of both resolution and tonal range. The 
ﬁ lms I have seen that were shot on a Genesis suggest they may be right. The downside is that 
with 14-bit-per-color processing that is then encoded into a 10-bit quasi-logarithmic signal using 
a CCD sensor, the camera does need a substantial battery as this combination is power hungry. 
 The Genesis sensor is the width of a Super 35  mm frame and the height that would be 
associated with shooting a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and it is this conﬁ guration that enables the 
camera to utilize virtually all the lenses you would expect to be able to use on a regular 
35  mm ﬁ lm camera. 
 The size of the sensor and the decisions Panavision have made make the front of the camera, 
without a lens mounted, look extraordinarily like a 35  mm ﬁ lm camera, as can be seen in 
 Figure 35.5 . The lens mount’s the same, the frame size is the same and the accessories are the 
same  – a bit like that duck, really! 
 35.5   Formats, Outputs and Interface 
 The Genesis primarily produces a 12.4-megapixel picture that is binned into a 6.2-megapixel, 
14-bit-per-color linear signal, which the camera then converts to a 10-bit quasi-logarithmic 
signal having 1920    1080 pixels. The output from the camera is available as an RGB 
(4:4:4) or Y, Pb, Pr (4:2:2) conﬁ guration. If the SRW-1 VTR is being used, which records 
in the HDCAM-SR format, then each frame will be recorded, independently, with 10 bits of 
information for every single pixel. It is worth noting that most productions that have shot with 
the Genesis to date have recorded in the RGB format. 
 The Sony SRW-1 will record a 4:4:4 signal up to 30 fps, but if you wish to record at between 
30 and 50 fps then you need to feed the SRW-1 with a 4:2:2 signal as this is the highest data 
rate it can cope with. 
 If you prefer to record a slightly purer image than can be handled by the SRW-1, then it is 
perfectly possible, and easy, to record a Genesis 4:4:4 output at any speed and without any 
compression, via Dual Link High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) outputs, and 
send these signals to, say, a separate hard drive, ﬂ ash memory or other external custom device 
that can cope with the increase in the data stream. 
 Monitoring the picture is achieved via a single HDSDI output socket on the side of the camera. 
 35.6   Solid-state Recording 
 Panavision recently added a solid-state recorder to their equipment line-up, the SSR-1. This 
handy unit can record 21 minutes of 4:4:4 data (SP mode) or 43 minutes of 4:2:2 data (LP 

The Panavision Genesis   239
mode). This solid-state recorder behaves just like the SRW-1 VTR, so it is very easy for the 
crew to swap between the two recorders. 
 The SSR-1 is about half the size and less than half the weight of the VTR and consumes 
considerably less power. 
 35.7  Viewing Logarithmic Images 
 Images encoded in a logarithmic way, though perhaps technically better and probably more 
appealing after post-production, tend not to look too good on a conventional monitor. Whilst 
 Figure 35.5 :   The front of the Genesis showing the lens mount, the throat of the camera and the 
sensor chip 

240  Chapter 35
this can be mainly overcome by the Director of Photography (DP) adjusting the monitor 
to compensate, Panavision offer a more elegant solution, a device they term the Genesis 
Display Processor (GDP). The problem is that whilst the logarithmic output from the Genesis, 
produced by what Panavision call the Panalog 4 ™ transfer curve, allows capture of the 
maximum tonal range for the image, it doesn’t match the response of most display devices. 
The GDP enables viewing of the image in a very close approximation to the ﬁ nal result to be 
delivered when the ﬁ lm is completed. Whilst this device can bring great conﬁ dence on set as 
it utilizes look-up tables (LUTs), it would be prudent to consult with your post-production 
house before choosing the exact LUT you intend to use. 

241
CHAPTER 36 
 The RED One 
 36.1  A Little Background 
 The RED One is the latest in a long line of cameras produced by people aiming to 
revolutionize the way we make movies. 
 My father knew August Arnold and Robert Richter, the founders of Arnold  & Richter who, in 
1937, announced the world’s ﬁ rst motion picture camera with a through-the-lens viewﬁ nder 
utilizing a spinning mirror in place of the conventional black shutter. This they called the 
Arriﬂ ex, a truly revolutionary camera, which was a cornerstone of the very successful Arriﬂ ex 
company of today (see Chapter 32). 
 Several of my friends knew Robert Gottschalk, the founder of Panavision, who in the 1950s 
revolutionized the way anamorphic lenses were designed and constructed, and went on to build 
Panavision into a world-class motion picture manufacturer and supplier (see Chapter 35). 
 I have met, and spent a wonderful lunchtime with, one of my heroes, Jean-Pierre Beauviala, 
who in 1973 introduced the Aaton 7 Super 16   mm camera. He was encouraged by the BBC 
and, as luck would have it, and as a new cameraman at the BBC Film Department, I was given 
the seventh Aaton camera they acquired as my personal issue camera. I went on to shoot with 
two later versions of the Aaton and I enjoyed shooting with them all. Believe me, when I put 
that ﬁ rst Aaton on my shoulder it was love at ﬁ rst touch  –  a truly revolutionary moment. 
 Now I sit down to write a chapter on the RED One. Will this be a revolution? I think it may. 
Why? It too is the creation of a person with a vision who wants to do something innovative 
and ahead of their time, one Jim Jannard. Whereas Messrs Arnold, Richter, Gottschalk and 
Beauviala were, in their time, fundamentally engineers as well as innovators, Mr Jannard 
comes from a slightly different background, but he is still certainly an innovator. 
 Jim Jannard started his career in 1975 working from his garage and calling his company 
Oakley. He soon launched a revolutionary handlebar grip for motorcycles. Mr Jannard has 
been quoted as  “ having a raging distaste for mediocrity and a ﬁ erce devotion to innovation ” . 
But if you trawl all the information you can ﬁ nd on him he has, to me, a Cinematographer, 
one outstanding and seemingly unique qualiﬁ cation over all the camera innovators I talk 

242  Chapter 36
about above  – he takes extremely ﬁ ne photographs! Having sold Oakley, which he had 
transformed into one of the most successful sunglass companies, he added digital motion 
pictures to the things he wanted to do better than anyone else and so started the RED Digital 
Cinema Camera Company. 
 36.2   First Impressions 
 When the RED One was ﬁ rst announced with its very high speciﬁ cation and its equally low 
price I was mightily sceptical. How could the RED completely ignore conventional wisdom 
as to the usual premises for a camera and be acceptable to the motion picture crews around 
the world? How could RED claim to know what the market wanted better than the established 
manufacturers? Even if all this were attainable, how could they possibly do this at such a 
staggeringly low price?  How could I have been so wrong?
 I have now spent time with the RED One over ﬁ ve sessions and seen ﬁ nished material both 
printed to 35  mm ﬁ lm and projected on a Barco DP100 projector, and I can conﬁ dently say 
the camera works, and works really well. 
 I ﬁ rst saw the RED One at a demonstration given by the camera supply company Decode in 
London and was immediately impressed by the physical build quality; I had not expected it 
to have the feel of a serious piece of motion picture equipment, but it has. It immediately felt 
right despite being a shape I had never encountered before. Decode were kind enough to let 
me have access to the camera twice more and I became increasingly convinced that I was 
looking at a seriously interesting camera. But could it live up to the hype? 
 Some weeks before writing this I was lucky enough to be invited to a viewing staged by the 
data/image handling company 4K London of some material shot on a RED One and printed 
out to 35  mm ﬁ lm, a viewing that claimed to be the ﬁ rst material so shown in the UK. I saw 
a compilation of what they had, clips from a feature ﬁ lm shoot shot at 4K but posted in 
2K, some material, again from a feature, that was from a boxing picture where the camera 
had been in 3K mode in order to take advantage of its higher frame rate capabilities at this 
resolution, and an available light shoot shot and posted at 4K. All were very impressive and 
all were shot with a camera in build 14 mode. Although all the pictures from the 35   mm 
prints were of very good quality, the boxing ﬁ lm having been heavily graded, it was, as it 
always is, somewhat difﬁ cult to judge the camera as it is impossible to know the Director 
of Photography (DP)’s original intentions and what they had been asked for by the Director. 
Nevertheless, one could hardly fault the ﬁ nished product. Please remember we were being 
asked to judge the pictures as full-blown feature ﬁ lms, a high standard. 
 The last viewing was of an intimate dinner between two young people, the table candlelit but 
in a reasonably bright sitting room. This had been shot in 4K and posted in 2K and we saw it 

The RED One   243
projected on the Barco DP100 projector. I thought it looked even better than the material that 
had already impressed us on a ﬁ lm print. 
 The only criticism I could possibly raise was that, for me, there was not enough detail in the 
shadows, though I have to admit that those shadows were very clean and contained no noticeable 
noise as one might expect from a camera using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) sensor with Bayer patterning. My conclusion has to be  – it works and it works well. 
 36.3  The Camera 
 In  Figure 36.1 you can see the camera more or less as it comes out of the box, with top and 
bottom 19  mm bars and the RED 18 – 50    mm T 3 zoom attached. This is probably the minimum 
kit with which a typical RED purchaser would start. With just a battery to power the camera 
you could take pictures with this rig, but I don’t think a professional would consider it viable. 
The reverse side of the camera, where all the connectors live, is shown in  Figure 36.2 . 
 My next visit was to a London camera supply company, VMI, where DP James Friend and 
his First Assistant Cameraman (AC1) Romain Choay were prepping a RED One prior to 
starting principal photography on the feature ﬁ lm  Transient , produced by Daniel Pickering 
 Figure 36.1 :  The RED One camera with just the top and bottom bars attached and the RED 
18–50   mm T 3 Zoom 

244  Chapter 36
and Richard Kerigan for Annix. You can see them at the VMI prep room in  Figure 36.3 . The 
camera is now beginning to take shape as it now has the top handle, front  “ bull’s horns ” , the 
18 – 50  mm zoom and a battery pack attached. 
 By the time James and Romain had the camera fully built with their preferred Arriﬂ ex focus 
unit and matte box and all the other RED bits needed to turn this camera into something fully 
capable of shooting a motion picture at full theatrical release quality (see  Figure 36.4  ), we 
had found that, despite this crew having worked with the RED One three or four times before, 
it had taken them almost 2 hours to rig the camera using several sizes of Allen keys. Their 
conclusion was that for the shoot proper they were going to have a transit case made for the 
RED that allowed it to be put away each night with all the solid physical bits left permanently 
attached. Lenses, matte boxes, follow focus and hard drive would be removed but everything 
else would stay on board. This, they reckoned, would enable the camera to be rigged each 
morning on the shoot in less than half an hour, much like any 35       mm ﬁ lm camera. Incidentally, 
the fully built camera now weighed as much as a similarly equipped 35   mm camera, a fact we 
cannot really complain about, for it is attempting to do exactly the same job. 
 One thing that was entirely new to me on this meeting with the camera was the on-board 
viewﬁ nder, which had only recently been announced; you can see me checking it out in 
 Figure 36.5 . The image down the RED viewﬁ nder is very good, being clear and crisp with 
 Figure 36.2 :  The non-operator side of the RED One showing all the output options

their shoot

246  Chapter 36
seemingly good color reproduction, but like most High Deﬁ nition (HD) ﬁ nders currently 
available there is a noticeable stutter to the image on panning the camera. You can choose 
to have just the image or a variety of extra information, just as you can on the assistant’s 
monitor ( Figure 36.6 ). The look-through viewﬁ nder has another very clever trick. If you look 
at  Figure 36.7 you can see that there is a knurled wheel on the side and three push buttons. 
These controls allow the operator to access the camera’s menus fully, just as you can with the 
display and controls on the back of the camera ( Figure 36.8  ). 
 As to the camera’s menu logic, it is very intuitive and simple to understand, unlike many of 
the cameras I have reviewed in this book. You hardly need any instructions even if you have 
never used an HD camera. Give yourself an hour with someone from any competent camera 
supply house to guide you and I am sure you will feel conﬁ dent in going out to shoot your 
ﬁ rst day with a RED One. 
 Just in case you are a conﬁ rmed ﬁ lm technician and feel all this HD nonsense is a little 
daunting, ﬁ x in your mind the last time you changed a lens on a ﬁ lm camera equipped with 
Arriﬂ ex accessories: how different would your view be from that in  Figure 36.9 ? Other than a 
wire going to the viewﬁ nder, I suggest it looks remarkably familiar. Believe me, it is! 
 The camera has the ability to accept several lens mounts. I imagine the Arriﬂ ex PL will be 
the most popular, but it can also be ﬁ tted with Mitchell BNC, Nikon still camera and Sony 
 Figure 36.5 :  PW checking the RED viewﬁ nder with Romain Choay on focus

B4 among others. In theory, these mounts are user interchangeable. In  Figure 36.10 you can 
see a close-up of the throat of the camera when ﬁ tted with an Arriﬂ ex PL mount and the 
 “ Mysterium ™ ” sensor looking for all the world like a ﬁ lm gate. How user friendly is that? 
 36.4  The Mysterium ™ Sensor 
 I have to say, sitting on my side of the Atlantic when the RED One was ﬁ rst announced, the 
word Mysterium made me laugh, for it brought back memories of the kind of language used 
in my childhood space comics. I realize that RED did not, at that time, want to reveal the 
exact kind of sensor they were using and maybe it had more to do with my warped British 
sense of humor, but I found this the only doubtful part of their marketing strategy. The rest, as 
we all now know, was pretty faultless. 
 The sensor, RED have now admitted, is a CMOS device using Bayer patterning  – a sensor 
capable of good images if downstream from it the images are handled carefully and with 
the full knowledge of what is needed in the image management processors that are going to 
look after it. I have been looking at RED One pictures since around build 10 of the software 
releases from RED and in the early days I was very concerned with the noise in the shadow 
areas of the image. I was, admittedly, not able to carry out very detailed examinations of what 
 Figure 36.10 :  A close-up of the throat of the camera showing the Mysterium ™ sensor 

250  Chapter 36
was going on at that time, but reducing the equivalent ISO speed of the camera seemed to 
improve things. Unfortunately, this defect is usually more relevant in low-key scenes where 
one is unlikely to welcome having to reduce the sensitivity of the camera by such a signiﬁ cant 
margin simply to obtain clean pictures. 
 RED have obviously been aware of this, as they have very honestly said, and the images 
I have described earlier in this chapter, which were shot using build 14 of the software, 
displayed little or no noise in the shadows, so they have clearly addressed this problem. The 
last camera I was able to look at before the publication deadline for this edition had build 16 
installed and at least on the professional monitor on which I could view images and at full 
sensitivity I could see no residual problem with image noise. 
 36.5   Shooting Costs 
 At the time of writing, a RED One camera body will cost you $17,500. I am not going to 
quote any other currency here, as presently it can only be ordered in US dollars. It must 
be understood that this ﬁ gure really does only cover the basic camera body. My rough 
calculations off the RED price list suggest that a camera with a single 18 – 50  mm zoom and 
the least in the way of accessories that you will need to go shooting will come to roughly 
$33,000  – a bit more than the cheap camera as advertised. If you look back at  Figure 36.4 the 
camera James is looking through also has Arriﬂ ex follow focus and matte box on board. Arri 
accessories do not come cheap. Admittedly, other manufacturers ’ accessories are available 
but if you want a truly professional motion picture camera these are the kind of sums you 
are looking at. If you want a really good lens set, and this would very much be my personal 
choice, try the Cooke S4/i kit comprising a 15 – 40  mm T 2 zoom, with 50, 75 and 100   mm 
S4/1 primes, again all T 2. Rumor has it that that lens set will set you back something over 
$100,000. So we are not looking at quite as economical a package as ﬁ rst might be thought. 
 On the other hand, it must be remembered that, at the time of writing, a basic Sony HDW 
750 HDCAM camcorder body will cost around $70,000, a Sony F23 around $150,000 and a 
Sony F35 around $250,000, and remember none of those prices is for anything more than the 
camera body. Suddenly the RED One is looking remarkably good value again! 
 36.6   RED Marketing 
 Perhaps even more revolutionary than the RED One camera has been the way it has been 
marketed. As I said at the beginning of this chapter, I was initially sceptical of all things 
RED but the marketing and after-sales attitude of the company have been refreshingly honest 
and clear. Right from the start of shipping the ﬁ rst cameras, RED promised that this camera 
could, in the main, be updated via the Net and those updates would be free to purchasers. 

The RED One   251
This promise has been kept. Indeed, as they have just announced that some time in the not 
too distant future they will be bringing out a 5K camera called the RED Epic they have also 
simultaneously announced that anyone purchasing a RED One after the announcement of the 
RED Epic will be able to return their camera and have it replaced with an Epic at a reasonable 
cost, still to be announced at the time of writing. That seems very fair to me. 
 In order to support their 4K format RED chose to use an entirely new codec to ﬁ le the 
RAW images, which would have made it very difﬁ cult to import those images into currently 
available edit suites. RED put RED Cine, an image handling and conversion program, onto 
the Net and, again, this computer program is downloadable entirely free of charge. That also 
seems very fair to me. 
 36.7  Design Philosophy 
 RED play it very close to their chest, and why not, but like a couple of other HD cameras  –
the Dalsa comes to mind – RED seem to have approached the problem of creating high-
quality images from the starting point of a computer rather than a camera. There is no 
problem with that so long as you get it right. Another premise seems to have been that you try 
to do the minimum amount of image processing in the camera and transfer as much of it as 
possible to the post-production arena, thereby reducing the cost of the camera, and its power 
consumption and possibly its weight, so that much of that processing happens in a relatively 
low-cost computer with high computing power that is run off the mains supply. Once again, 
no problem if you get it right. 
 36.8  Recording Media 
 If you look back at  Figure 36.8 , just to the left of the menu display you can see a Compact 
Flash card in the on-board card slot. Currently 8 and 16 gigabyte (GB) cards are available 
and, I believe, 32  GB cards are now becoming available. The simplest way to record your 
picture data, and probably the highest quality, is to record it in RED RAW ﬁ les. The recording 
time on any data medium is dictated by the amount of data you are trying to store and this is, 
again, dictated by the size of the ﬁ le that the image format you have chosen demands for each 
frame of picture. 
 If you have chosen to shoot with the RED One at its highest picture quality, 4K RAW at 24 
frames per second (fps), then an 8 GB Compact Flash card will store around 4 minutes of 
screen time. A couple of 8 GB Compact Flash cards are shown in  Figure 36.11 . Equally, a 16 
GB card will store around 7 minutes of screen time. If you choose to record your images on 
a 320 GB RED Drive as shown loaded on the camera in  Figure 36.3 , then you can record 180 
minutes of screen time. I am sure you will not have much difﬁ culty in working out how long 

252  Chapter 36
your chosen media will last with the camera running  – it is roughly 2 GB per minute. 
I suggest you make this a conservative estimate. 
 Running the camera at lower resolution will allow longer recording times on any drive and I 
am not going to go into this in detail here, as it is very well covered on the RED website and 
freely downloadable. 
 36.9   Which Drive to Choose? 
 Easy question, difﬁ cult answer. Unfortunately, at present it is not possible to record on both 
a Compact Flash card and an on-board hard drive at the same time. If a Flash card is inserted 
into the camera, the camera defaults to using this as the recording media. You have to answer 
this one for yourself and the decision breaks down into two primary questions: are you happy 
to put at least a whole day’s work into one data box and trust it will be successfully stored 
and backed up at the end of that day, or are you prepared to pay for a Data Wrangler to make 
those precious copies from smaller segments of the day’s work several times during the day? 
The latter path, assuming a horrid disaster, would mean you only lost a small proportion of 
the day’s work. Coming from a ﬁ lm background I would favor the smaller storage capacity 
downloaded more often. It also makes for a lighter camera. On the other hand, one small box 
containing a day’s work is attractively convenient. As I said, it’s your choice. 
 Figure 36.11 :  Compact Flash memory cards 

The RED One   253
 36.10   Basic Camera Speciﬁ cation 
 36.10.1  The Mysterium ™ Sensor 
 The Mysterium ™ sensor can run at any frame rate between 1 and 60 fps, has a native color 
balance of 5000 K, and may electronically compensate for any color temperature between 
1700 and 10,000 K. There are preset white balances for 3200 and 5600 K to match the 
conventional values used for motion picture ﬁ lm. 
 RED claim that the Mysterium ™ sensor includes 12-bit analog-to-digital conversion for 
each pixel and is capable of delivering a 66  dB dynamic range, equivalent to 11 stops, when 
operating at the equivalent to 320 ISO. 
 36.10.2  Image Processing 
 Images from the sensor are, say RED, formatted as pixel defect corrected, but not color 
processed, 12-bit RAW data, which is similar to the way data are handled in a high-end digital 
still camera. The Progressive scan RAW images are compressed in-camera using wavelet-based 
RED Code and the compressed image data are stored on the in-camera Compact Flash (CF) card 
or on external e-SATA-based digital media such as the RED Drive or a RED Flash magazine. 
 The RAW sensor data are also converted to a white balanced 10-bit RGB 4:4:4 monitor video 
with SMPTE REC 709 color gamut that provides a program High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital 
Interface (HDSDI) output for external video monitoring and recording via HDSDI and HDMI 
sockets on the side of the camera. 
 36.11   Conclusions 
 Much against my initial perception of the RED One, I ﬁ nd myself curiously attracted to the 
camera. There are a number of things I would like improved, but as we are still in an extended 
development stage for the software perhaps these matters are soon to be sorted. I would like 
to have seen more detail in the shadows. I would like to be able to record simultaneously on 
a Compact Flash card and on the on-board hard drive. I would like to be able to work in 2K 
ﬁ les from the whole of the sensor, thus giving me smaller ﬁ les, more than adequate for many 
applications, but still using the whole of the sensor area. At present, if you wish to work in 
2K you only use a part of the sensor equivalent to the same area as a Super 16   mm ﬁ lm gate, 
thus losing the desirable lack of depth of ﬁ eld associated with a 35  mm image. I would like a 
viewﬁ nder that does not stutter when I pan the camera. 
 To be fair, many of my requests I would make of some of the other cameras reviewed here, all 
of which cost more!

CHAPTER 37 
 The Sony HDW F790, F750 and 
F730 HD Cameras 
 In the year 2000 Sony transformed the professional camcorder market with the introduction 
of the HDW F900, later replaced with the F900R, which utilized three 1920     1080 pixel 
chips and recorded on a 1/2-inch tape in what was another step up for portable video tape 
recording, and which used a recording format they named HDCAM. This pixel array and 
recording format quickly became an international norm. This camera was ﬁ rmly aimed at 
being able to replace 35  mm ﬁ lm, as well as starting the television High Deﬁ nition (HD) 
revolution. 
 In 2002 Sony brought out three additional cameras, the HDW F750, F750P and F730; these 
still used the international HD pixel standard of 1920    1080 and the HDCAM recording 
format. Whereas the F900 utilized a 12-bit analog-to-digital processor, the F750/F730 
cameras use a 10-bit processor. Despite this, the images from these cameras look every bit 
as good as those from the F900 when shown on television, which is the intended market for 
these cameras. I think most viewers seeing the images from an F750 on television would 
think they had been recorded on 35  mm ﬁ lm. These remarkable cameras are easily capable 
of a camera/recording stock costs below, sometimes signiﬁ cantly below, that of Super 16   mm 
ﬁ lm and yet deliver a superb picture quality comparable to 35   mm ﬁ lm. 
 A couple of years after the introduction of the F750 Sony brought out the F790, which looks 
exactly the same as the other 700 range cameras but moves up to a 12-bit processor as used in 
the F900R. 
 37.1  Frame Rates 
 There are two models of the 790, one which has the choice of either a 1080 59.94i or a 50i 
frame rate and the other, known as the 790P, which has the choice of either a 1080 50i frame 
rate or a 25 progressive segmented ﬁ eld (PSF) frame rate. 
 There are two models of the 750 designed for the NTSC environment, both of which record in 
the 60i (interlace) format, or more accurately 59.94i. These are the HDW F730 and the HDW 
F750. The F790 and the F750 use exactly the same picture head block and imaging chips as 

256  Chapter 37
the earlier F900: three 2/3-inch FIT chips. The F730 uses three 2/3-inch IT chips. Though 
there is only a small reduction in overall picture quality when changing from an FIT chip to 
an IT chip, this change, combined with a simpliﬁ cation of the camera controls and facilities, 
provides a signiﬁ cant reduction in cost. The F730 is aimed at the more cost-conscious end of 
the market and the F790 and F750 at the quality-conscious customer. 
 There is a second model of the F750, intended for the PAL environment and known as the 
F750P, which is switchable between 25 frames Progressive scan and a 50 interlace format. 
 All the cameras record onto HDCAM tape exactly as with the original HDW F900. 
 37.2   The Camera Body 
 All the HDW 700 series cameras share the same camera body and their switches and controls 
are identical. The body is a few inches shorter front to back than the F900 and around 7 pounds 
lighter, but the same size and weight as the F790R; in fact, all the 700 series cameras are 
smaller and lighter than a conventional Digi Beta camera. There are none of the multiple frame 
rates available as with the F900R, only those discussed above.  Figure 37.1  shows an F750P 
ﬁ tted with a 20  mm Zeiss Digi Prime lens and a Crosziel matte box. At the rear of the camera 
can be seen two aerials, which are attached to the slot-in radio receiver, thus allowing the 
sound recordist to feed back a mixed output to the tracks on the video tape without the use of 
a cable. This unit can be more clearly seen in  Figure 37.2   , which shows the back of the camera. 
 Figure 37.1 :  The Sony HDW 750P HD camera 

 Figure 37.2 :  The rear of the HDW 750 

258  Chapter 37
 The switch block that controls most of the camera functions and the menus has been 
somewhat redesigned from the ones on the F900 and the Digi Beta cameras, which are 
similar to each other. In  Figure 37.3 you can see the new layout. The most signiﬁ cant change 
is the moving of the rotary encoder wheel from the front plate of the camera to the end of 
the camera control switch block, where it is more easily accessed. Also in  Figure 37.3 you 
can see that, just below the ﬁ lter code plate, there are now two assignable switches whose 
functions can be selected from within the menus. 
 The lens center to base plate height has been signiﬁ cantly reduced, thus lowering the center of 
gravity, which makes the camera even more suitable for hand holding. 
 37.3   Add-in Boards, etc. 
 There are a couple of potentially very useful add-in boards for the camera, one of which 
operates as a built-in down-converter that can output Standard Deﬁ nition Serial Digital 
Interface (SDSDI) or an analog composite signal, the choice being selectable within the menu 
system. This board will be a great attraction to users in the television industry, for without 
 Figure 37.3 :  The HDW 750 switch block 

The Sony HDW F790, F750 and F730 HD Cameras  259
any additional kit they can now view the camera’s output on conventional broadcast monitors. 
As can be seen in Figure 37.2 , there is no external change when the down-converter board is 
ﬁ tted; both High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) and the SDSDI or composite 
BNC sockets are conveniently placed at the back of the camera on the operator side. The 
cannon plug in this illustration is providing an external DC supply. 
 The second add-in board is a picture cache, which allows several minutes of recording to be 
continually recorded without the video tape recorder (VTR) being switched on. Once the 
VTR is activated the cache starts to dump down its contents while still taking in new images; 
when the VTR run/stop control is hit the tape runs on for the chosen cache time to complete 
the recording. 
 In the 60i versions of the camera, cache times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 seconds may be 
selected and in the 25P/50i version 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 seconds may be chosen. There are 
no moving parts to this board as it utilizes solid-state memory and therefore should prove 
very reliable. 
 As we have seen, a radio receiver can be slotted into the back of the camera. Also, a GPS unit 
can be ﬁ tted on the top of the viewﬁ nder and the position of the camera recorded either on the 
tape itself or onto the set-up memory card which, as in the F900, is a Sony memory stick. 
 37.4  Image Control via the Menus 
 Most of the image controls are accessible via the menus that one would expect on an F900 
or, indeed, a Digi Beta camera; some have changed and there are a few new ones. The most 
interesting, and possibly unfamiliar, F790, F750 and F730 menus are the following. 
 37.4.1  Multi Matrix 
 Multi matrix allows for selective color enhancement or alteration. Any particular color can be 
selected or “ grabbed ” and have its hue changed over a range of approximately 22.5 degrees. 
This allows for secondary color correction, normally only possible in post-production, and is 
performed at full bit depth. 
 37.4.2  Auto Tracing White Balance 
 If the auto tracing white balance function is deployed, the camera will continuously monitor 
the ambient light color temperature and adjust the camera’s settings accordingly. Therefore 
if you have this function switched on and take a shot where, with the camera running, you go 
from an outdoor environment lit by daylight and move to an interior scene lit with tungsten 
light the camera will automatically adjust the colorimetry to make both environments look 
color correct. A lot of the time this function works surprisingly well. 

260  Chapter 37
 37.4.3  Color Temperature Control 
 There is a page in the menu called preset white where you can simply add overall blue or 
overall red to the scene, thus giving either a cooler or warmer look. This works simply and well. 
 37.4.4  Selectable Gamma Curves 
 The camera allows for multiple points in the gamma curve where it can be adjusted or 
modiﬁ ed, thus achieving a contrast range appropriate to the scene. Within the menu system 
there are also a number of preset gamma curves, which are: 
 Gamma calculating pattern A 
● 
 No. 1: SMPTE 240M standard, which sets an initial gain of 4.0 
● 
 No. 2: ITU-R.BT709 standard, which sets an initial gain of 4.5 
● 
 No. 3: BBC gamma setting, which gives an initial gain of 5.0. 
 Gamma calculating pattern B 
● 
 No. 1: Sensitivity is equivalent to 50 ISO 
● 
 No. 2: Sensitivity is equivalent to 100 ISO 
● 
 No. 3: Sensitivity is equivalent to 200 ISO. 
 I would not necessarily advise deploying any of these settings if there is any chance of your 
material going out to ﬁ lm, but for a purely television presentation they can be very useful. 
This holds true for all the gamma settings as well as black stretch. 
 37.4.5  RGB Gamma Balance 
 This adjustment alters the color balance of the midtones without affecting black or white. 
 37.4.6  Variable Black Gamma Range 
 This function makes possible ﬁ ne adjustment of the tonal reproduction on the darker parts 
of the scene without affecting the midtones; while doing this it maintains the absolute black 
level. The variable range is Low, Mid and High. 
 37.4.7  Black Stretch 
 When variable black gamma range is performed it can be limited to picture luminance 
without affecting any other factors of the video signal. This can be very helpful in a dark 
scene when you wish to bring out more detail in the darker parts of the scene but wish the 
absolute black to stay black. 

The Sony HDW F790, F750 and F730 HD Cameras  261
  37.4.8  Adaptive Highlight Control (Auto Knee Mode) 
 With this function switched to  “ on ” the camera’s ADPS system will monitor the whole of the 
picture and adapt the knee point/slope settings for optimum reproduction of the scene. For 
instance, if you are shooting an interior with a bright window in shot, switching this function 
on should bring down the exposure just within the image contained by the window. 
 37.4.9  Knee Saturation Function 
 Sony refer to their TrueEye processor, which basically controls the highlights in a 
high-contrast scene. For instance, if knee correction is applied only via the RGB channels, 
skin tone when very brightly lit will occasionally look yellow and Sony claim applying this 
function should bring it back to a clear color. It does seem to work. 
 37.4.10  The Triple Skin Tone Detail Control 
 In addition to the usual single skin tone detail and color control found on most current 
Sony cameras, there are now three separate settings and the range of adjustment allows for 
modiﬁ cation to far more colors than just skin tone. Within each setting it is possible to grab 
a single color and substantially modify it, and this can be done to three individual colors. It 
works well and allows you to do far more than you might with a red enhancement ﬁ lter; for a 
start it works on all colors. 
 37.4.11  Level Depend Detail 
 This function provides detail enhancement in extreme highlights; it automatically limits 
the amplitude of edge signals in high-contrast areas. Detail aliasing in these areas can be 
dramatically reduced. 
 37.5  Metadata Handling 
 The camera can record a unique material identiﬁ er (UMID) signal, which is standardized as 
SMPTE 330M. The purpose of this is to record information on the tape at every shot change. 
These data can include a universal label, an instance number, a material number, the time and 
date, spatial coordinates, the country, the origin and a user identiﬁ er code. 
 37.6  The Sony Tele-File System 
 The Sony Tele-File storage system allows information such as shot data, shot marks, etc. 
to be recorded onto an optional cassette label with a built-in memory integrated circuit so 

262  Chapter 37
that all this information can travel with the cassette for the rest of its working life. This can 
signiﬁ cantly speed up the post-production process if used carefully. 
 37.7   The Optional HDSDI Adapter 
 Although a single HDSDI source comes out of the back of the camera there are occasions 
when more sources might be required and also access to all four of the on-tape soundtracks 
may be needed. The optional HDSDI adapter allows for all of this. 
 37.8   An Overview 
 The HDW F700 range of cameras is a very signiﬁ cant step forward in the move to a 
worldwide common standard of HD acquisition in the television industry. The 750 
middle-of-the-range camera has a lower price tag than a Digi Beta camera had at its 
introduction 10 years previously and we all know how popular that camera became. 
 The HDW F730 is such an economical camera to purchase that it is hard to conceive how the 
take-up will not be at least as successful as was Digi Beta  – this time the cost is less and the 
leap in quality of much greater signiﬁ cance. 
 The HDW F790P and F750P with their 25 fps Progressive scan capability are tailor-made 
for the European, and particularly UK, single camera television drama market, where they 
offer all the convenience of Digi Beta and a signiﬁ cant reduction in costs compared with 
the traditional acquisition medium, Super 16, and bring picture quality up to that usually 
expected of 35  mm origination. 

263
CHAPTER 38 
 The Sony HDW F900R 
 38.1  The Camera 
 The Sony HDW F900R is the third generation of Sony’s HDCAM camcorder range and is 
very much a derivative of both their original F900 and the later 700P cameras. Sony have 
listened to their clients and worked hard to bring together in the HDW F900R camera all 
the good points of both the previous cameras. Essentially they have packaged all but two, 
hardly used, facilities originally found in the F900 inside the casing of an HDW 750P, as can 
be seen in Figure 38.1 , here ﬁ tted with a Zeiss Digi Prime lens and a production matte box. 
Remarkably they have also found space to incorporate internal converter boards from the 
700P so that two High Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) outputs are standard and 
by adding an extra board inside the camera it is possible to replace one of the HDSDI outputs 
with a Standard Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (SDSDI) output. The only noticeable 
difference is the casing, which, though identical to the 750P, is now a much darker gray. In 
 Figure 38.2 you can see the F900R ready for hand-held use and ﬁ tted with a broadcast-style 
zoom lens and a lightweight sun shade. 
 Compared with the old 900 the 900R is 10 percent shorter, 20 percent smaller by volume 
and 2.6 kilograms lighter. Sony say that the 900R ﬁ tted with a viewﬁ nder, battery, cassette, 
microphone and a small zoom or prime lens weighs in at 5.4 kilograms, or 12 pounds. The 
power consumption has also been signiﬁ cantly reduced, thus allowing smaller and lighter 
batteries to be used. Having had one on my shoulder I am prepared to believe Sony; it’s a 
much more operator-friendly camera than the original F900. 
 The camera can be switched between several frame rates. For Progressive scan use the 
available frame rates are 23.98, 24, 25 and 29.97. In interlace mode 50 and 59.94 are 
available. About the only facilities that were available on the original 900 and have been 
dropped on the F900R are the frame rates of 30 Progressive and 60 interlace for these were, 
in practice, found to have very little use. 
 The available shutter speeds on this model are: Off, 1/32, 1/48, 1/50, 1/60, 1/96, 1/125, 1/250, 
1/500 and 1/1000. 

264  Chapter 38
 The ﬁ lter wheels contain, on the color correction wheel, A: 5600 K; B: 3200 K; C: 4300 K; 
and D: 6300 K. The neutral density (ND) wheel contains 1: Clear; 2: 1/4 ND; 3: 1/16 ND; and 
4: 1/64 ND. While it is nice to see the almost worthless star ﬁ lter replaced with the motion 
picture standard color correction ﬁ lter of 5600 K, I feel it is a pity Sony have not seen ﬁ t to 
represent the ND ﬁ lters also in the traditional motion picture way of expressing them as the true 
measurement of their density, which would be 1: Zero; 2: 0.6 ND; 3: 1.2 ND; and 4: 1.8 ND. 
 Sony claim that with the camera set at 24P and with 1/48 set as the shutter speed, the 
sensitivity of the camera will be approximately the equivalent of ISO 300. 
 38.2   The Chips 
 The chips and the beam splitter block are the same as for all the Sony HDW cameras in that 
they contain three 2/3-inch chips, with Red, Green and Blue portions of the image being 
 Figure 38.1 :  Sony HDW F900R 

The Sony HDW F900R  265
separated optically as described in greater detail elsewhere in this book. Each FIT charge-
coupled device (CCD) chip has a full 1920     1080 pixel array, again just as before. 
 38.3  The Processor 
 As with the original 900, the F900R utilizes a 12-bit processor while the video tape recorder 
(VTR) uses the same 4.4:1 compression algorithm, thus outputting to tape a video data rate of 
140  MB/s when working in 59.94i mode. 
 38.4  Additional Facilities 
 It is also possible to add a picture cache board, which allows up to 8 seconds of buffered 
recording without the VTR running. Also available is a slow shutter/inverter board and a 2:3 
pull-down converter board. 
 The camera control panel on the front of the camera is much the same as before but with the 
addition of a microphone level adjustment knob, as can be seen in  Figure 38.3 . 
 38.5  Menus 
 The F900R utilizes a menu system very like the original F900 camera, both in its Sony and 
Panavision forms. 
 Figure 38.2 :  The Sony HDW F900R in handheld broadcast mode 

266  Chapter 38
 38.6   Overall Impressions 
 For television work, within most of Europe, the HDW 750P camera seemed to me to be as 
ideal as was possible with modern technology and a three-chip conﬁ guration. It is light and 
simple to use while giving exceptionally good pictures. The original HDW F900, on the other 
hand, had the advantages of 24P and a 12-bit processor, both facilities making it ideal when 
shooting for the cinema but it was unwieldy, especially with the HDSDI converter box on 
the back, and is heavy and somewhat cumbersome in use, which I can conﬁ rm having spent 
a morning shooting with an F900 on my shoulder ﬁ tted with the converter box, a sizeable 
battery, a Panavision 4.5:1 zoom and a full matte box. 
 The F900R combines the best of both cameras, being a lighter version than the F900 and 
having more facilities than the 750. Not surprisingly it does come with a cost premium 
when compared with the 750P, but is less expensive than the F900 was at the time of its 
introduction. I, for one, will make the HDW F900R very welcome indeed.

CHAPTER 39 
 The Sony F23 and F35 
 39.1  Some Background 
 At the time of writing, the F23 has been around a relatively short time and details of the 
F35 were only released very recently. As far as I could discern, hardly any F23s had made 
it to the UK and no F35s; these cameras are therefore two of only three I review here that I 
have not actually handled. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy to work out what they do from 
Sony-released information and their remarkable similarity to the Panavision Genesis. Indeed, 
it seems almost certain that they are the result of the Joint Venture agreements between 
Panavision and Sony and I am told that there was a mutual understanding that Sony would not 
release their versions until at least 2 years after Panavision had released the Genesis. 
 39.2   Basic Speciﬁ cations 
 Both cameras share an almost identical body and both accept the Sony SRW-1 HDCAM-SR 
video tape recorder (VTR) mountable on top of the camera or on the rear of the camera body, 
again exactly as with the Genesis. Both cameras utilize a 14-bit analog-to-digital converter. 
The F35 has a variable frame rate from 1 to 50 frames per second and the F23 has preset steps 
of 23.98P, 24P, 29.97P, 50P, 59.94P, 50i and 59.94i. 
 The great difference between the two cameras lies right at the front of the camera bodies. The 
F23 has a hardened Sony B4 lens mount, behind which is Sony’s usual High Deﬁ nition (HD) 
optical splitter block with three 2/3-inch image sensors, while the F35 has an Arriﬂ ex PL 
lens mount, behind which is a single charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor the same size as a 
motion picture Super 35  mm frame, which appears to be the same, or very similar, sensor to 
the one ﬁ tted to the Genesis. 
 Both the camera bodies are similar though not exactly the same as the Genesis, for Sony have 
built them to accept standard Arriﬂ ex 19  mm bars and ﬁ lm accessories, so all the follow focus 
devices and matte boxes familiar to ﬁ lm technicians who have used Arri cameras will ﬁ t and 
work in exactly the same way. 
 Both cameras, together with the VTR, will output and record a full 4:4:4 1920 by 1080 
16    9 image. 

268  Chapter 39
 Currently quoted prices suggest that the F23 will retail at around $150,000 and the F35 at 
around $250,000. Neither camera is therefore aimed at the economy end of the market. 
 39.3   Why Introduce These Cameras? 
 From where I sit in the UK, that is not at all an easy question to answer. The F23 echoes the 
900R but offers an even higher bit rate and enhanced image manipulation, but I look forward 
to seeing who will want to spend that much money in order to process the output from most 
B4 mounted broadcast lenses. Maybe that is the answer: somewhere in the broadcast market 
there is the demand for such a high-end camera. Time will surely tell. 
 The F35, on the other hand, despite its cost, does look as if it might have a place in the world 
currently occupied mainly by 35  mm ﬁ lm. Two of the most popular high-end HD cameras, the 
Arriﬂ ex D-21 and the Panavision Genesis, can currently only be rented from their respective 
manufacturers and there may well be a lot of camera rental houses currently offering 35  mm 
ﬁ lm equipment who are looking for just such an HD camera body to extend their footprint 
in the market and this camera, with its complete compatibility with Arri accessories and the 
35  mm lenses they will already have on the shelf, might look a very attractive way to go, 
particularly if it offers Genesis-type picture quality. This option could greatly open up the 
progress of HD across the ﬁ lm acquisition world.

CHAPTER 40 
 The Thomson Viper 
 Since I wrote the second edition of this book the Thomson Viper has somewhat changed its 
place in the market. In the UK a few major suppliers have moved away from it, but some 
very dedicated alternative suppliers have recognized the camera’s ability to produce very 
ﬁ ne pictures and have dedicated themselves to offering a service that, if taken in its totality, 
removes some of the downside elements of the camera, notably in the recording formats 
needed and in post-production. 
 Thomson has taken a different approach to most other 2/3-inch three-chip camera 
manufacturers: its primary design parameter was that there should not be any data 
compression within the camera. This would be described as a 4:4:4 signal. This means that 
the data stream coming out of the back of the camera is so large that it takes two BNC cables 
to transfer it to some form of recording format. Thomson has named the form in which the 
data leave the camera FilmStream. With the current state of data recording technology there 
is no tape format that can cope with this much information and, if no compression is to be 
used, it must be fed to a server or some form of hard-disk or solid-state recording format. At 
its introduction the camera could not be used as a camcorder so the purity and amount of the 
data coming from it was both its main advantage and its greatest drawback, as recordings 
could only be made on rather unwieldy equipment and not on any commercially available 
unit utilizing tape. 
 40.1  The Camera Body 
 Figure 40.1 shows the operator side of the camera, which is ﬁ tted with a Zeiss 6 – 27  mm zoom 
lens.  Figure 40.2 shows the other side of the camera. Some ﬁ lm technicians who have seen 
the camera have taken to its appearance, for it is not dissimilar in shape to the camera body 
of several current 35   mm ﬁ lm cameras, particularly so if you look at the front of the camera 
body in  Figure 40.2 , where you can see the housing for the mechanical shutter that is needed 
with the Thomson system.

 Figure 40.2 :  The non-operate side of the Viper 

The Thomson Viper   271
 40.2  Outputs from the Camera 
 At the rear of the camera there are three BNC plugs, the left hand of which is sending High 
Deﬁ nition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) to a straightforward monitor; the right-hand two 
are, together, taking the FilmStream signal away for storage. 
 It is also possible to ﬁ t an alternative back to the camera, which will add a third output giving 
a down-converted PAL signal using a single BNC cable. 
 40.3  The Hard Drive Recorder 
 Figure 40.3 shows the DMAG hard-disk recording unit used by Motion FX, who have 
specialized in offering not only the Viper and a full range of Zeiss lenses to ﬁ lm producers, 
but have, in house, all the necessary downstream facilities to take the production right through 
to the ﬁ nished product for exhibition in a cinema. 
 40.4  The Beam Splitter 
 The Thomson camera uses a beam splitter in the same way as all 2/3-inch three-chip cameras. 
If you refer to Chapter 13, you will ﬁ nd a full explanation of how this works. 
 40.5  The Viper’s CCD Array 
 The Viper is primarily designed to produce the standard High Deﬁ nition (HD) format image 
using 1920 pixels horizontally with 1080 pixels vertically, giving a total of 2  , 073 , 600 pixels 
for the complete image, this being the current international HD standard. The Thomson 
HD-DPM chip is a little cleverer than this, for while it has 1920 pixels horizontally it has 
four times as many subpixels vertically, which can be grouped in various ways to give some 
interesting imagery. If every four vertical subpixels are grouped together, then the standard 
1080-line HD image is recorded. If every three pixels are grouped together then very nearly 
the equivalent of a cinemascope aspect ratio can be recorded, still with a full 1080-line 
vertical resolution. The actual aspect ratio formed using three-pixel grouping will be 2.37:1. 
Alternatively, if every ﬁ ve pixels are grouped together then an HD 16    9 image will be 
output in the 720-line format. This ability to switch between formats using subpixels to make 
up various vertical pixel groupings gives the camera a distinct advantage over cameras with a 
ﬁ xed 1080 vertical pixel array, especially when shooting in the equivalent of an anamorphic 
format, for then a conventional chip will only have a vertical resolution of a little over 
800 lines.

The Thomson Viper   273
 40.6  The Mechanical Shutter 
 All charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging is sensitive to light at all times, though it can be 
electronically switched either to convert photons into electrons or to dump the electrons, 
which effectively switches the pixels off and is commonly known as an electronic shutter. 
If the Thomson chips are left on all the time there will be some image blur or streaking of 
moving highlights evident in the image. The Viper therefore uses a mechanical shutter to 
provide a brief period in every frame cycle during which the imaging chip will not have light 
reaching it and in this period the information is dumped to a playout-only chip, which is kept 
continually in the dark, and this releases the imaging chip for the next frame. 
 The Viper can be set with the mechanical shutter permanently open but the streaking and blur 
described above will be evident; there may be some occasions where for artistic reasons this 
is an advantage. 
 The mechanical shutter has an opening of 312 degrees. The exposure time can be further 
reduced electronically down to one-thousandth of a second. 
 40.7  Frame Rates 
 The Viper can be set to record in a large number of format combinations. It will work in a 
1080-line Progressive scan mode both in a 16     9 format and a 2.37:1 format; it will also 
work in a 1080 interlace format and a 720-line Progressive scan format.  Figure 40.4 shows 
which frame rates are available at the different vertical resolutions in both the available 
Progressive scan and interlace settings. 
 40.8  Resolution 
 Although the Thomson camera has 4320 vertical subpixels, it always groups them into a 
conﬁ guration of 1080 vertical master pixels. It would be wrong to think that the subpixels 
contribute to a greater resolution, for it is the combined subpixels that are output as a single 
unit of pixel information and therefore this is the resolution of the data that leave the camera. 
 40.9  The Camera’s Processor Conﬁ guration 
 Figure 40.5 shows a block diagram of the processor stages within the camera. The analog 
signals from the three-color dedicated CCDs are converted to a 12-bit digital signal 
immediately behind the chips. If the camera is being used in the higher information 
FilmStream mode, the signal is then converted from the line 12-bit signal to a logarithmic 
10-bit signal and is then sent to some recording device that can handle this information. 
Additionally, the add-on camera back can convert the RGB digital signal to an HDSDI or PAL 

274  Chapter 40
viewing signal. If no viewing facility is required, the add-on converter can be dispensed with 
and the camera can be set to output a pure FilmStream signal, an RGB signal or a YUV signal. 
 40.10   The Camera Back 
 If any viewing facilities are required from the camera a relatively small back can be attached 
to the camera to convert the signals to more convenient formats. The block diagram of the 
basic back is shown in  Figure 40.6 , where the RAW output from the camera is converted from 
a parallel FilmStream mode to a serial FilmStream mode and four other processors are used 
to output a conventional HDSDI output. 
 40.11   The Arguments for a Logarithmic Recording Format 
 Thomson put forward a strong argument for ﬁ rst converting the output from the imaging 
chips to a binary digital signal and then translating this signal to a logarithmic digital signal.

The argument is mainly based on two suppositions. First, that the human eye, and ﬁ lm, both 
respond to light in a logarithmic way and storing the data in a logarithmic form makes these 
data much more compatible to the image a human being would expect to see. Secondly, the 
human eye sees much more color and the brain is much more aware of the densities in the 
darker parts of an image. A logarithmic interpretation of a picture will provide much smaller 
steps between values in the darker parts of an image than it will for the lighter parts so, again, 
it is conforming itself to a more human response.

 Thomson further claim that a linear 12-bit information stream will contain no more 
information than a 10-bit logarithmic data stream as the greater information in the shadows is 
so much better catered for in the logarithmic version that the gross data contained within it is 
higher than the same picture stored in a linear format. 
 Things have moved on and now they are far from the only camera manufacturer embracing 
logarithmic processing. 
 40.12   Lenses for the Viper 
 There is no question that the Viper camera is capable of full HD resolution and that outputting 
a full 4:4:4 signal at least theoretically provides a fuller digital interpretation of that image. 
The 4:4:4 signal is also arguably more robust, particularly if considerable post-production 
work is envisaged. Given the above, it would be a waste if the optical image provided to the 
imaging chips were not able to resolve a circle of confusion much better than one covering two 
pixels. In my opinion very near a one-pixel resolution must be achieved before the advantages 
of the Thomson approach will be seen on the screen, especially on a cinema screen. 
 40.13   Monitors for the Viper 
 As the Viper can easily deliver a standard HDSDI signal, exactly the same monitors are 
available as with most HD cameras. Unless you can afford the newer Progressive scan 
monitors when you pan the camera you will see horizontal stuttering, again exactly as with 
Sony and many other cameras, and this is not recorded but is simply a monitor problem. 
 40.14   Camera Accessories 
 The Viper is totally compatible with Arriﬂ ex camera accessories, and the base plate can be 
supplied to conform with the normal positioning of Arriﬂ ex lens support bars; therefore all 
lens control and matte boxes you would expect to order with a ﬁ lm camera are available with 
the Viper. 
 It is probably best to use the same kinds of tripod and tripod leg as you would use with 
a 35  mm camera, though the more robust ones that you might choose to use with 16  mm 
equipment should work more than adequately. 
 40.15   Shipping the Viper 
 The Viper is a robust camera but as with all sophisticated equipment it must be treated with 
respect. Standard motion picture precautions will more than sufﬁ ce.  

The Thomson Viper   277
 40.16   Conclusions 
 The Viper is beginning to look a little dated and because of its dedication to a 4:4:4 output 
has never been the easiest of cameras to use on location. That said, if you go to a supply 
company such as Motion FX who have put a huge amount of effort into supplying a service 
that will take you from shooting right through post-production to the cinema screen then it 
is, particularly with the Zeiss lenses, a system capable of very good results and can still be 
economically attractive.

CHAPTER 41 
 Where Do We Go From Here? 
 To be honest I haven’t a clue! There are so many options with High Deﬁ nition (HD) and all 
its higher-end derivatives it would, I suggest, be a foolish person who gave you an absolute 
answer to the above question. But then by getting to the end of this book you will have, 
I hope, gathered that I am nothing if not brave. 
 HD as we know it started in the year 2000 and quickly proved, to those who would listen, that 
it was a very viable medium which, in many ways, could contest the supremacy of 35   mm ﬁ lm. 
Many, many people did not want to believe this could possibly happen, but most of them have 
by now embraced it, or at least accepted it, as a worthy recording format for theatrical and 
high-end television productions. Ask yourself how long you think it will be before most 
television broadcasts in the developed world are originated and most often transmitted in HD  –
not long, I suggest. 
 41.1  HD Cameras 
 There are a couple of developments or changes that are starting to come through that, 
I believe, will seriously alter what will be accepted as the norm for a professional HD camera. 
 41.1.1  Broadcast Cameras 
 In the broadcast arena there are very signiﬁ cant advantages to using a three-chip camera 
where the three primary colors are separated by an optical block of three pieces of glass, 
two of them prisms, and including two dichroic mirrors. This conﬁ guration, though far 
from optically pure, has the signiﬁ cant advantage that there is one chip optically dedicated 
to providing a signal for each of the primary colors, Red, Green and Blue. This is what 
television needs and wants  – so let TV have it, no problem. 
But that optical block has some signiﬁ cant drawbacks if you are trying to make a movie for 
theatrical release. It severely degrades the optical quality of the image. Inevitably, putting 
the picture from a lens through all that extra glass does it no good. Also, having to calculate 
a lens that will refocus the image on the image plane quite a lot behind where it wants to, in 

282  Chapter 41
order that the image can still focus on the chips after traveling through all that glass, again 
degrades the purity of the image. 
  Let us say three-chip cameras are ﬁ ne within a television environment but get a little stretched 
when asked to provide the quality required of my arbiter  – the Odeon Leicester Square. They 
can certainly do it on a ﬁ lm with little CGI but their images tend to fall apart a bit if put under 
post-production pressure. 
 41.1.2  Cameras That Really Emulate 35  mm Film 
 The current trend seems to be to produce high-end cameras that can use all the lenses that 
were so familiar to those who used to work with 35  mm ﬁ lm or those who loved the kind of 
picture they grew up with in the cinema of their youth. Marvelous, why shouldn’t they? 
 To obtain this  “ look ” an awful lot of cameras recently designed and brought to market now 
take the approach of utilizing a single sensor, somewhere around the size of the old 35  mm 
frame. I have to say I like this approach. 
 The interesting thing about some of these newer single-sensor cameras is that many of them 
would not be economically viable if the world of digital still cameras had not progressed so 
far and so fast. Since Oskar Barnack designed what was to become the ﬁ rst Leica 35   mm still 
camera, that still camera frame has had dimensions of 24  mm    36  mm, twice the size of 
the old 35  mm motion silent picture frame of 24   mm    18  mm. So? This is very signiﬁ cant, 
believe me. 
 Early on in the development of digital still cameras designed to replace 35   mm single lens reﬂ ex 
cameras, the designers became aware that unlike a ﬁ lm camera, where image size dictates the 
number of silver grains available to record that image, a silver grain’s size being somewhat 
ﬁ nite, the only thing limiting picture quality in a digital camera, at least as far as absolute 
resolution was concerned, was the number of pixels on the chip, not the size of the chip. 
 With this in mind it soon became apparent to many digital still camera manufacturers that 
if they halved the chip size, and most of them chose the 18   mm    24  mm old silent movie 
frame size known in the stills world as half frame, a signiﬁ cant number of advantages would 
accrue provided there were still enough pixels on the chip. Cameras could be smaller, lighter 
and probably cheaper. More importantly, to cover the same ﬁ eld of view lenses only needed 
to be less than half the focal length and, again, would become smaller, lighter and cheaper. 
This was particularly important in many ﬁ elds of still photography; think of the poor sports 
photographer working for a newspaper having to use a 600  mm lens on a 35   mm ﬁ lm to get 
that shot of, say, the goalkeeper. Now a lens no longer than 300   mm would be needed. Not 
only would this be lighter in the hand, but it would also encounter far less camera shake in the 
heat of the action. 

Where Do We Go From Here?   283
 How does this relate to motion picture cameras? The most signiﬁ cant contribution is that if 
these 18  mm    24  mm sensors could be used in a moving picture camera then virtually all the 
lenses ﬁ lm motion picture crews were used to would give them the same image size, the same 
ﬁ eld of view and the same depth of ﬁ eld. Suddenly a digital movie camera would start to give 
images that looked very familiar, at least within these parameters. 
 The only problem was that early digital still cameras using an 18  mm    24  mm sensor took 
some time to process the data from the chip. One solution was to buffer the data so that you 
could take a rapid sequence of perhaps ﬁ ve shots and you then had to wait several seconds 
for those data to be processed and written to the memory chip. This approach was not going 
to work with a camera that had to take at least 24 pictures a second and might very well be 
asked to shoot for at least 10 minutes before stopping and allowing the buffered pictures to be 
downloaded. 
 So, simplistically, what camera manufacturers did was put one hell of a big computer chip in 
the camera so that they could use the still camera sensors and feed the data into something 
very like Photoshop, but the size of the processor would allow Photoshop to process 24 
pictures per second. 
 Job done? Not quite. The time taken for a still camera to process the image before storing 
it allowed the processor to undertake considerable noise reduction programs and, if a 
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor with Bayer patterning was used, 
apply some sophisticated data processing to get rid of the excess of green, etc. 
 As I write, data processors are becoming able to handle huge amounts of data, enabling very 
sophisticated picture processing to happen at least 24 times a second, and several cameras can 
work very happily at 50 frames per second or even faster. 
 So my prediction for cameras? Very soon we will see cameras able to process images at 
signiﬁ cantly higher frame rates; they will have high resolution and far less noise in the 
shadows than many show at present. This will require bigger and faster processors, so how 
big and heavy the camera battery will be remains to be seen. 
 41.2  Recording Formats 
 It looks like the movie world is heading for solid-state recording, with all that entails. It does 
allow much higher data transfer rates but, with the present cards etc., the workﬂ ow on set 
to be able to safely reuse these storage media can be a bit of a nightmare. As the perceived 
notion is that every 2 years storage capabilities multiply by a factor of 10 and the new 10 
times bigger storage costs about the same, I can only imagine that this will free up camera 
manufacturers to do even more wonderful things. Let’s hope so. 

284  Chapter 41
 41.3   Entertaining our Audience 
 None of the above is really going to help our audience very much. I am sorry to disappoint you. 
 At the end of the day all our audience wants is a good story well told and without anything to 
come between that story and their suspension of disbelief in the storytelling process. 
 Let’s hear it for good scripts! 
 And that seems to me to be an appropriate place to end this book. 
 Thank you for reading. Hopefully we will meet again for the next edition  – when things will 
certainly be very different!
