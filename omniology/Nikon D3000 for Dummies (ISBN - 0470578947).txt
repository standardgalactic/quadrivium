Nikon D3000 For Dummies 

Introduction
O
nce upon a time, making the move from a point-and-shoot digital 
camera to an SLR model required boatloads of cash and the willing-
ness to cart around a bulky, heavy piece of equipment. All that changed a few 
years ago when Nikon introduced the D40, a digital SLR that offered a com-
pact size and an equally compact price. 
With the D3000, Nikon proves once again that you don’t have to give an arm 
and a leg — or strain your back and neck — to enjoy dSLR photography. 
This new addition to the Nikon family of dSLRs offers the same easy-to-love 
size and price tag that made the D40 so popular. And the two cameras share 
another important characteristic: Like the D40, the D3000 doesn’t skimp on 
power or performance, offering a great set of features to help you take your 
photography to the next level.
In fact, the D3000 offers so many features that sorting them all out can be 
more than a little confusing, especially if you’re new to digital photography, 
SLR photography, or both. For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR 
means or how it affects your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the 
other techie terms you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, aper-
ture, white balance, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may be so 
overwhelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet ven-
tured beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame because 
it’s sort of like buying a Porsche 911 and never heading out for the open road.
Therein lies the point of Nikon D3000 For Dummies. Through this book, you 
can discover not just what each bell and whistle on your camera does, but 
also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. Unlike many photogra-
phy books, this one doesn’t require any previous knowledge of photography 
or digital imaging to make sense of things, either. In classic For Dummies 
style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand language, with lots of 
illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Nikon picture-taking 
powerhouse.

Nikon D3000 For Dummies 
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your 
D3000:
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to 
get the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure 
modes, including the Scene modes such as Sports mode, Portrait mode, 
and Landscape mode.
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality and Size,” introduces you to 
two camera settings that are critical whether you shoot in automatic or 
manual mode: the Image Size and Image Quality settings, which control 
resolution (pixel count), file format, file size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Reviewing Your Photos” offers just what its title implies. Look 
here to find out how to view your photos on the camera monitor, delete 
unwanted images, and protect your favorites from accidental erasure. 
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your D3000 
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three 
critical exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chap-
ter also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, 
and M); explains exposure options such as Active D-Lighting, metering 
modes, and exposure compensation; and offers tips for using flash.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Head here for information about 
your camera’s many autofocusing options, for tips on how to manipulate 
depth of field (the zone of sharp focus in a picture), and for details about 
color controls such as white balance.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscapes, close-
ups, and more.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your 
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage 
device. Look here, too, for details about using the D3000’s built-in tool 
for processing files that you shoot in the Nikon RAW format (NEF). Just 
as important, this chapter explains how to organize and safeguard your 
photo files. 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Pictures,” helps you turn your 
digital files into “hard copies” that look as good as those you see on the 
camera monitor. This chapter also explains how to prepare your pictures 
for online sharing, create digital slide shows, and, for times when you 
have the neighbors over, display your pictures on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features,” shows 
you how to fix less-than-perfect images using features found on your 
camera’s Retouch menu, such as automated red-eye removal. You also 
find out how to apply color effects and perform a few other photo-
enhancement tricks.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” 
presents information about some camera features that, while not found 
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My D3000” lists, are nonetheless 
interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.

4
Nikon D3000 For Dummies 
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
 
A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or some 
other valuable resource, including your sanity. Tips also point out techniques 
that help you get the best results from specific camera features.
 
When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone that 
can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored. In other words, this 
is stuff that you really don’t want to learn the hard way.
 
Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photogra-
phy is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful 
mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.
 
I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth stor-
ing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that may 
have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
Additionally, I need to point out three additional details that will help you use 
this book:
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons and 
onscreen symbols also appear in the margins of some paragraphs. I 
include these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of the 
button or feature being discussed. 
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “choose 
File➪Convert Files,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the 
Convert Files command on the menu.
 
✓ Camera firmware: Firmware is the internal software that controls many 
of your camera’s operations. The D3000 firmware consists of two parts, 
called A and B. At the time this book was written, both A and B were 
version 1.00.

5
 Introduction
 
 Occasionally, Nikon releases firmware updates, and it’s a good idea to 
check out the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) periodically to find out 
whether any updates are available. (Chapter 1 tells you how to deter-
mine which firmware version your camera is running.) Firmware updates 
typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re mostly used to 
solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you do download an 
update, be sure to read the accompanying description of what it accom-
plishes so that you can adapt my instructions as necessary. 
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and edit-
ing tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file 
downloading, archiving, and e-mail sharing, I selected Nikon ViewNX and 
Nikon Transfer, both of which ship free with your camera and work on both 
the Windows and Mac operating systems.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in ViewNX and Nikon Transfer work 
very similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the 
steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your soft-
ware manual for details. And of course, there are For Dummies books on all 
the major image editing applications, and you can use them if you find the 
manual a tad — ahem — boring.)
eCheat Sheet
As a little added bonus, you can find an electronic version of the famous For 
Dummies Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/nikond3000. The 
Cheat Sheet contains a quick-reference guide to all the buttons, dials, switches, 
and exposure modes on your D3000. Log on, print it out, and tuck it in your 
camera bag for times when you don’t want to carry this book with you.
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 

6
Nikon D3000 For Dummies 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book. 
Your D3000 is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and I thank 
you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

aking sense of all the controls on your 
D3000 isn’t something you can do in an 
afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even a 
month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t take 
great pictures today. By using your camera’s auto-
matic point-and-shoot modes, you can capture 
terrifi c images with very little effort. All you do is 
compose the scene, and the camera takes care of 
almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage 
of your camera’s automatic features and also 
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewfi nder to your eyesight and getting 
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and 
dials. In addition, chapters in this part explain 
how to obtain the very best picture quality, 
whether you shoot in an automatic or manual 
mode, and how to use your camera’s picture-
playback features.

I
still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot 
camera, but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy 
sported several unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the expla-
nations in the camera manual clearly were written for 
someone with an engineering degree. And then there 
was the whole business of attaching the lens to the 
camera, an entirely new task for me. I saved up my 
pennies a long time for that camera — what if my 
inexperience caused me to damage the thing before 
I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Nikon 
D3000 is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve 
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. 
If your D3000 is both your first SLR and first digital 
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated as 
its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of this chap-
ter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly become as 

10
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones 
on your car’s dashboard. This chapter also guides you through the process 
of mounting and using an SLR lens, working with memory cards, navigating 
your camera’s menus, and customizing basic camera operations.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from a macro lens, which enables 
you to shoot extreme close-ups, to a wide-angle lens, which encompasses a 
wide field of view, to a telephoto lens, which lets you photograph subjects 
from a distance. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable focusing ring that 
gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying on the camera’s 
autofocus mechanism.
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background 
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next several 
sections explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical 
part of your camera.
Attaching a lens
 
Your camera can autofocus only with a type of lens that carries the specifica-
tion AF-S. (Well, technically speaking, the camera can also autofocus with AF-I 
lenses. But since those are high-end, very expensive lenses that are no longer 
made, this is the only mention you’ll find of AF-I lenses in this book.) You can 
use other types of lenses, as long as they’re compatible with the camera’s 
lens mount, but you’ll have to focus manually.
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Turn the camera off and remove the cap that covers the lens mount on 
the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
 
3. Hold the lens in front of the camera so that the little white dot on the 
lens aligns with the matching dot on the camera body.
 
 Official photography lingo uses the term mounting index instead of little 
white dot. Either way, you can see the markings in question in Figure 1-1.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 Note that the figure (and 
others in this book) 
shows the D3000 with its 
so-called “kit lens” — the 
18–55mm AF-S Vibration 
Reduction (VR) zoom lens 
that Nikon sells as a unit 
with the body. If you buy a 
lens from a manufacturer 
other than Nikon, your dot 
may be red or some other 
color, so check the lens 
instruction manual.
 
4. Keeping the dots aligned, 
position the lens on the 
camera’s lens mount as 
shown in Figure 1-1.
 
 When you do so, grip the 
lens by its back collar, not 
the movable, forward end 
of the lens barrel.
 
5. Turn the lens in a counterclockwise direction until the lens clicks into 
place.
 
 To put it another way, turn the lens toward the side of the camera that 
sports the shutter button, as indicated by the red arrow in the figure. 
 
6. On a lens that has an aperture ring, set and lock the ring so the aper-
ture is set at the highest f-stop number.
 
 Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aperture 
ring and how to adjust it. (The D3000 kit lens doesn’t.) To find out more 
about apertures and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
 
Even though the D3000 is equipped with a dust reduction system, you should 
always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk 
of getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. 
Changing lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added 
safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver; 
doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn into the 
camera by gravity.
Mounting index dots
Figure 1-1: When attaching the lens, align the index 
markers as shown here.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Turn the camera off and then 
locate the lens-release button, 
labeled in Figure 1-2.
 
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
 
 In other words, hold on to the 
stationary part of the lens that’s 
closest to the camera body and 
not the movable focusing ring or 
zoom ring, if your lens has one.
 
3. Press the lens-release button 
while turning the lens clock-
wise (toward the button) until 
the mounting index on the lens 
is aligned with the index on 
the camera body.
 
 The mounting indexes are 
the little guide dots labeled in 
Figure 1-1. When the dots line 
up, the lens should detach from 
the mount. 
 
4. Place the rear protective cap 
onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another 
lens on the camera, cover the 
lens mount with the protec-
tive cap that came with your 
camera, too.
Using a VR (vibration reduction) lens
If you purchased the D3000 kit — the body-and-lens combination put 
together by Nikon — your lens offers a feature called vibration reduction. On 
Nikon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials VR in the lens name.
Vibration reduction attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and 
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That 
camera movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although 
vibration reduction can’t work miracles, it enables most people to capture 
sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.

disengage the lens from the mount.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
However, when you use a tripod, vibration reduction can have detrimental 
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually 
occurring. That’s why your kit lens — and all Nikon VR lenses — have an On/
Off switch, which is located on the side of the lens, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
Whether you should turn off the VR feature, though, depends on the specific 
lens, so check the manual. For the 18–55mm kit lens, Nikon does recommend 
setting the switch to the Off position for tripod shooting, assuming that the 
tripod is “locked down” so the camera is immovable.
If you use a non-Nikon lens, the vibration reduction feature may go by 
another name: image stabilization, optical stabilization, anti-shake, vibration 
compensation, and so on. In some cases, the manufacturers may recommend 
that you leave the system turned on or select a special setting when you use 
a tripod, so be sure to check the lens manual for information.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains 
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation 
of shutter speed.
Setting the focus mode (auto or manual)
Again, the option to switch between autofocusing and manual focusing 
depends on matching the D3000 with a fully compatible lens, as I explain in 
the earlier section, “Attaching a lens.” With the kit lens, as well as with other 
AF-S lenses, you can enjoy autofocusing as well as manual focusing. 
 
The AF stands for autofocus, as you may have guessed. The S stands for silent 
wave, a Nikon autofocus technology.
For times when you attach a lens that doesn’t support autofocusing or 
the autofocus system has trouble locking on your subject, you can focus 
manually by twisting a focusing ring on the lens barrel. The placement and 
appearance of the focusing ring depend on the lens; Figure 1-3 shows you 
the one on the kit lens.
To focus manually with the kit lens, take these steps:
 
1. Set the lens to manual focus mode.
 
 On the kit lens, look for the switch labeled in Figure 1-3, and move it 
from the A to the M position, as shown in the figure.
 
2. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to 
adjust focus.
 
 If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. You may also need to adjust the 
viewfinder to accommodate your eyesight; you can get help with the 
process a few paragraphs from here.

Figure 1-3: On the 18–55mm kit lens, the manual-focusing ring is set near the front of the lens, 
as shown here.
If you use a lens other than the kit lens, check the lens instruction guide for 
details about focusing manually; your lens may or may not have a switch 
similar to the one on the kit lens. Also see the Chapter 6 section related to 
the Focus mode option, which should be set to MF for manual focusing. (With 
the kit lens and some other lenses, the camera automatically chooses the MF 
setting for you.)
Zooming in and out
If you bought a zoom lens, it has a movable zoom barrel. The location of the 
zoom barrel on the D3000 kit lens is shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, 
just rotate that zoom barrel clockwise or counterclockwise.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
The numbers on the zoom barrel, by the way, represent focal lengths. I 
explain focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the 
lens is mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the lens mount-
ing index (the white dot) represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3, for 
example, the focal length is 18mm.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Tucked behind the right side of the rubber eyepiece that surrounds the view-
finder is a tiny slider called a diopter adjustment control. With this control, 
labeled in Figure 1-4, you can adjust the focus of your viewfinder to accom-
modate your eyesight.
Diopter adjustment switch
Focus point
Figure 1-4: Use the diopter adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
 
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out of focus through the view-
finder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa. 
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the little black mark-
ings in the center of the screen.
 
 The little rectangles represent the camera’s autofocusing points, which 
you can read more about in Chapters 2 and 6. I labeled one of the points 
in Figure 1-4. The four curved lines represent the center-weighted 
metering area, which relates to an exposure option you can explore in 
Chapter 5.

16
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
3. Push the diopter adjustment slider up or down until the viewfinder 
markings appear to be in focus.
 
 The Nikon manual warns you not to poke yourself in the eye as you per-
form this maneuver. This warning seems so obvious that I laugh every 
time I read it — which makes me feel doubly stupid the next time I poke 
myself in the eye as I perform this maneuver.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory 
cards. Your D3000 uses a specific type of memory card called an SD card (for 
Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. You can also use the new, high-
capacity Secure Digital cards, which are labeled SDHC, as well as Eye-Fi SD 
cards, which enable you to send pictures to your computer over a wireless 
network. (Because of space limitations, I don’t cover Eye-Fi connectivity in 
this book; if you want more information about these cards, you can find it 
online at www.eye.fi.)
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them — 
requires just a few precautions:
 
✓ Inserting a card: First, be 
sure that the camera is 
turned off. Then put the 
card in the card slot with 
the label facing the back 
of the camera, as shown in 
Figure 1-5. Push the card 
into the slot until it clicks 
into place; the memory 
card access light (circled 
in Figure 1-5) blinks for a 
second to let you know the 
card is inserted properly.
 
✓ Formatting a card: The first 
time you use a new memory 
card or insert a card that 
has been used in other 
devices (such as an MP3 
player), you should format it. 
Formatting ensures that the 
card is properly prepared to 
record your pictures.
Memory card access light
Figure 1-5: Insert the card with the label facing the 
camera back.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 Formatting erases everything on your memory card. So before format-
ting, be sure that you have copied any pictures or other data to your 
computer.
 
 To format a memory card, choose the Format Memory Card command 
from the Setup menu. The upcoming section “Ordering from Camera 
Menus” explains how to work with menus. When you select the com-
mand, you’re informed that all images will be deleted, and you’re asked 
to confirm your decision to format the card. Highlight Yes and press the 
OK button to go forward.
 
 If you insert a memory card and see the letters For in the viewfinder, you 
must format the card before you can do anything else. You also see a 
message requesting formatting on the camera monitor. 
 
 Some computer programs enable you to format cards as well, but it’s 
not a good idea to go that route. Your camera is better equipped to opti-
mally format cards.
  
✓ Removing a card: After making sure that the memory card access light 
is off, indicating that the camera has finished recording your most 
recent photo, turn the camera off. Open the memory card door, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Depress the memory card slightly until you hear a 
little click and then let go. The card should pop halfway out of the slot, 
enabling you to grab it by the tail and remove it.
 
 If you turn on the camera when no card is installed, the symbol [-E-] 
appears in the Shots Remaining area of the viewfinder (lower-right 
corner), and you also see a little symbol that looks like an SD card on 
the left side of the viewfinder screen. (That card symbol appears 
whether or not the camera is turned on.) If the Shooting Information 
screen is displayed on the monitor, that screen also nudges you to 
insert a memory card. If you do have a card in the camera and you get 
these messages, try taking it out 
and reinserting it.
 
✓ Handling cards: Don’t touch the 
gold contacts on the back of the 
card. (See the left card in Figure 
1-6.) When cards aren’t in use, 
store them in the protective cases 
they came in or in a memory card 
wallet. Keep cards away from 
extreme heat and cold as well.
 
✓ Locking cards: The tiny switch on 
the side of the card, labeled lock 
switch in Figure 1-6, enables you 
to lock your card, which prevents 
any data from being erased or 
Don’t touch!
Lock switch

on the card.

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
recorded to the card. Press the switch toward the bottom of the card 
to lock the card contents; press it toward the top of the card to unlock 
the data.
 
 You also can protect individual images on a card from accidental 
erasure by using the camera’s Protect feature, which is covered in 
Chapter 4.
 
One side note on the issue of memory cards and file storage: Given that 
memory cards are getting cheaper and larger in capacity, you may be 
tempted to pick up an 8GB (gigabyte) or 16GB card thinking you can store a 
gazillion images on one card and not worry about running out of room. But 
memory cards are mechanical devices that are subject to failure, and if a 
large card fails, you lose lots of images. And putting aside the potential for 
card failure, it’s darned easy to misplace those little guys. So I carry several 
4GB SD cards in my camera bag instead of relying on one ginormous card. 
Although I hate to lose any images, I’d rather lose 4GB worth of pictures 
than 8 or 16GB.
Do you need high-speed memory cards?
Memory cards are categorized not just by their 
storage capacity, but also by their data-transfer 
speed. SD cards (the type used by your D3000) 
fall into one of three speed classes, Class 2, 
Class 4, and Class 6, with the number indicat-
ing the minimum number of megabytes (units 
of computer data) that can be transferred per 
second. A Class 2 card, for example, has a mini-
mum transfer speed of 2 megabytes, or MB, 
per second. Of course, with the speed increase 
comes a price increase, which leads to the 
question: Do you really have a need for speed?
The answer is “maybe.” Photographers who 
shoot action benefit most from high-speed 
cards — the faster data-transfer rate helps the 
camera record shots at its maximum speed. 
Users who shoot at the highest resolution or 
prefer the NEF (Raw) file format also gain from 
high-speed cards; both options increase file 
size and, thus, the time needed to store the pic-
ture on the card. (See Chapter 3 for details.) As 
for picture downloading, how long it takes files 
to shuffle from card to computer depends not 
just on card speed, but also on the capabilities 
of your computer and, if you use a memory card 
reader to download files, on the speed of that 
device. (Chapter 8 covers the file-downloading 
process.)
Long story short, if you want to push your 
camera to its performance limits, a high-speed 
card is worth considering, assuming budget is 
no issue. Otherwise, even a Class 2 card should 
be more than adequate for most photographers.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are buttons, dials, and switches that 
you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your photos, and 
perform various other operations. In later chapters, I discuss all your cam-
era’s functions in detail and provide the exact steps to follow to access them. 
This section provides just a basic road map to the external controls plus a 
quick introduction to each.
 
One note before you move on: Many of the buttons perform multiple func-
tions and so have multiple “official” names. The AE-L/AF-L button, for exam-
ple, is also known as the Protect button. In the camera manual, Nikon’s 
instructions refer to these multi-tasking buttons by the name that’s relevant 
for the current function. I think that’s a little confusing, so I always refer to 
each button by the first moniker you see in the lists here. In addition, when I 
reference a button other than the Menu button or OK button — which carry 
the name on the button face — I include a margin icon that shows the button 
to further clarify things. 
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins with the 
bird’s-eye view shown in Figure 1-7. 
There are a number of controls of 
note here:
 
✓ On/Off switch and shut-
ter button: Okay, I’m pretty 
sure you already figured this 
combo button out. But check 
out Chapter 2 to discover the 
proper shutter-button-pressing 
technique — you’d be surprised 
how many people mess up their 
pictures because they press 
that button incorrectly.
 
 
✓ Exposure Compensation 
button: This button activates a 
feature that enables you to 
tweak exposure when working 
in three of your camera’s auto-
exposure modes: programmed 
autoexposure, aperture-priority 
Info button
Exposure Compensation button
AF-assist lamp
Mode dial
Figure 1-7: The tiny pictures on the Mode dial 
represent the automatic exposure modes 
known as Scene modes.

20
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
autoexposure, and shutter-priority autoexposure, represented by the 
letters P, S, and A on the Mode dial. Chapter 5 explains. In manual expo-
sure (M) mode, you press this button while rotating the Command dial 
to adjust the aperture setting.
 
 
✓ Info button: You press this button to display the Shooting Information 
screen on the camera monitor. The screen not only enables you to easily 
view the current picture-taking settings but also is the pathway to the 
Quick Settings screen, through which you can adjust some settings more 
quickly than by using the camera menus. See the upcoming section 
“Monitoring Shooting Settings” for details. To turn the screen off, press 
the Info button again.
 
✓ Mode dial: With this dial, labeled in Figure 1-7, you set the camera 
to fully automatic, semi-automatic, or manual photography mode. 
Choosing the Guide setting brings up the guided menu display, which 
is designed to help newcomers get acquainted with the camera. The 
little pictographs represent Scene modes, which are automatic settings 
geared to specific types of photos: action shots, portraits, landscapes, 
and so on. (You may hear these referred to in some quarters as Digital 
Vari-Program modes, which is the term Nikon used for past camera 
models.) Chapter 2 details the Scene and Auto modes; Chapter 5 explains 
the P, S, A, and M modes; and the section “Using the guided menus,” 
later in this chapter, introduces you to that feature.
 
✓ AF-assist lamp: In dim lighting, the camera may emit a beam of light 
from this lamp when you use autofocusing. The light helps the camera 
find its focusing target. If you’re shooting in a setting where the light is 
distracting or otherwise annoying, you can disable it via the AF-assist 
option on the Shooting menu. Chapter 6 provides more help with this 
feature and autofocusing in general.
 
 The AF-assist lamp also shoots out light when you use red-eye reduction 
flash and the self-timer shutter release mode, both covered in Chapter 2. 
You can’t disable the lamp for these two functions.
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, shown in Figure 1-8, you 
encounter the following controls:
 
✓ Command dial: After you activate certain camera features, you rotate 
this dial, labeled in Figure 1-9, to select a specific setting. For example, 
to choose an f-stop when shooting in aperture-priority (A) mode, you 
rotate the Command dial. And in manual exposure (M) mode, you 
change the f-stop by rotating the dial while pressing the Exposure 
Compensation button, as explained in the preceding section. (Chapter 5 
explains apertures and f-stops.)

Command dial
Multi Selector
Figure 1-8: You use the Multi Selector to navigate menus and access certain other 
camera options.
 
 
✓ AE-L/AF-L/Protect button: Pressing this button initiates autoexposure 
lock (AE-L) and autofocus lock (AF-L). Chapter 5 explains autoexposure 
lock; Chapter 6 talks about autofocus lock.
 
 In playback mode, pressing the button locks the picture file — hence the 
little key symbol that appears to the left of the button — so that it isn’t 
erased if you use the picture-delete functions. See Chapter 4 for details 
on this option, called Protect. (The picture is erased if you format the 
memory card, however.) 
 
 You can adjust the performance of the button as it relates to locking 
focus and exposure, too. Instructions in this book assume that you stick 
with the default setting, but if you want to explore your options, see 
Chapter 11.

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Multi Selector/OK button: This dual-natured control, labeled in Figure 
1-8, plays a role in many camera functions. You press the outer edges 
of the Multi Selector left, right, up, or down to navigate camera menus 
and access certain other options. At the center of the control is the OK 
button, which you press to finalize a menu selection or other camera 
adjustment. See the next section for help with using the camera menus.
 
 
✓ Delete button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, this button enables you to erase pictures from your memory 
card. Chapter 4 has specifics.
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture 
review mode. Chapter 4 details the features available to you in this 
mode.
 
MENU
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to access menus of camera options. See 
the next section for details on navigating menus.
 
? 
✓ Zoom Out/Thumbnail/Help button: This button has a number of func-
tions, but the ones you’ll use most often are:
 
• Display help screens: You can press this button to display helpful 
information about certain menu options. See “Asking Your Camera 
for Help,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
• Adjust the image display during playback: In playback mode, press-
ing the button enables you display multiple image thumbnails on 
the screen and reduce the magnification of the currently displayed 
photo. See Chapter 4 for a complete rundown of picture playback 
options.
 
i  
✓ Zoom In/Information Edit button: In playback mode, pressing this 
button magnifies the currently displayed image and also reduces the 
number of thumbnails displayed at a time. Note the plus sign in the 
middle of the magnifying glass — plus for zoom in. Like the Zoom Out 
button, this one also serves a few minor roles that I explain in later 
chapters.
 
 When you’re taking pictures, the button becomes the Information Edit 
button (notice the little i above the button label). With this button, you 
can bring up the Quick Settings screen, where you can access and adjust 
some shooting settings more quickly than by using menus or other tech-
niques. See the upcoming section “Using the Quick Settings Screen” for 
details.
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, shown in Figure 1-9, you find the 
following controls:

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Flash button
Function button
Auto/Manual focus switch
Lens-release button
Vibration Reduction switch
Figure 1-9: Press the Flash button to pop up the built-in flash.
 
 
✓ Flash/Flash compensation: In the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, 
and M), pressing this button pops up the camera’s built-in flash. (In 
other modes, the camera decides whether the flash is needed.) By hold-
ing the button down and rotating the Command dial, you can adjust the 
flash mode (normal, red-eye reduction, and so on). In advanced expo-
sure modes, you also can adjust the flash power by pressing the button 
while simultaneously pressing the Exposure Compensation button and 
rotating the Command dial. See Chapter 2 for an introduction to flash; 
check out Chapter 5 for the detailed story.
 
Fn
 
✓ Function (Fn) button: By default, this button sets the Release mode to the 
Self Timer setting for your next shot. But if you don’t use that feature often, 
you can use the button to perform one of six other operations. Chapter 11 
provides the details on changing the button’s purpose. (Note: All instruc-
tions in this book assume that you haven’t changed the function.)
 
✓ Lens-release button: You press this button before removing the lens 
from your camera. See the first part of this chapter for help with mount-

A/M switch to set the kit lens to automatic or manual focusing. The VR 
switch turns the Vibration Reduction feature on and off.

Ordering from Camera Menus
 
Pressing the Menu button on your camera gives you access to a whole slew 
of options in addition to those you control via the external buttons and 
dials. But what type of menu screens you see depends on the setting of the 
Mode dial: 
 
✓ Guide: Pressing the Menu button when the Mode dial is set to Guide 
brings up the first screen of the guided menus, which provide a simple, 
walk-me-through-it approach to using the camera.
 
✓ All other settings: Pressing the Menu button when the Mode dial is set 
to any option except Guide brings up the normal, text-based menus. 
The next two sections provide an overview of using both types of menus. But 
for reasons you can discover in the following discussion, the rest of this book 
pretty much ignores the guided menus and relies on the regular menus to get 
things done — a choice that I suggest you make as well. 
Using the guided menus
The guided menus work much like interactive menus you encounter in other 
areas of your life — on cellphones, bank machines, grocery-store self-checkout 
kiosks, and the like — except that instead of pressing buttons on the screen, 
you use the Multi Selector and OK button to make your menu selections. And 
thankfully, your camera also does not nag you to hurry up and “please place 
the item in the bagging area!” every three seconds. 
With that rant about the modern grocery-store experience out of my system, 
here’s how to use the guided menus:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to Guide, as shown on the left in Figure 1-10.
 
 You see the initial guided menu screen, shown on the right in the figure. 
You’re offered three categories of options: Shoot, View/Delete, and Set Up.
 
 The items labeled in the figure, which appear on all the guided menu 
screens, tell you the following information:
 
• Battery status: A full icon like the one in Figure 1-10 says you’re 
good to go. If the little battery symbol appears only half full or less, 
it’s time to dig out your battery charger.
 
• Exposure mode: Even though the Guide option is on the Mode dial, 
it’s not an exposure mode per se — rather, it’s a menu-based way 
for you to access the actual exposure modes. Through the guided 
menus, you can access any exposure mode except Programmed 
Auto (P) and Manual (M). The symbol in the lower-right corner of 

25
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
the guided menu screen tells you which exposure mode is selected. 
In Figure 1-10, the symbol shows that the Auto mode is selected. 
The G tells you that you’re in Guide mode, in case you forget.
 
• Shots remaining: The other value in the lower-right corner shows you 
the number of remaining shots you can fit on your memory card.
Battery status

Figure 1-10: Set the Mode dial to Guide to use the guided menus.
 
2. Press the Multi Selector right or left to highlight the category you want 
to choose.
 
 (Remember, the Multi Selector is the big rocker button with the OK 
button in the middle.) Here’s a quick preview of what each category 
enables you to do: 
 
• Shoot: Select this icon to select options that walk you through the pro-
cess of choosing basic picture-taking options and shooting pictures.
 
• View/Delete: Select this category to access picture-playback func-
tions and erase pictures from your memory card.
 
• Set Up: Choose this icon to access camera setup options — things 
like setting the date and time, adjusting monitor brightness, and 
so on.
 
 This category also contains two options that make a big impact on 
picture quality: Image Size and Image Quality. They really belong 
with the rest of the picture settings in the Shoot category, as 
they’re organized in the regular menus. At any rate, check out 
Chapter 3 for help choosing the right settings.

26
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
3. Press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen that lists available options in the category you 
chose. The left screen in Figure 1-11 shows the first screen that appears 
if you select Shoot in Step 2, for example.
Figure 1-11: Use the Multi Selector to highlight an option and press OK to move to the next step.
 
4. Highlight the option that interests you and press OK to display the 
next screen of information and instructions.
 
 For example, if you highlight Easy Operation, as in Figure 1-11, and 
press OK, you see the second screen in the figure. There, you can make 
another choice and press OK again to move to the next screen. 
 
 If you see a right-pointing arrow next to a highlighted option, you can 
display the next screen by pressing the Multi Selector right instead of 
pressing OK, if you prefer.
 
 From this point on, keep high-
lighting options and pressing OK 
to move forward. For the Shoot 
category, you ultimately reach a 
screen that looks like the one in 
Figure 1-12, telling you which 
exposure mode the camera is 
using and inviting you to either 
start shooting or select More 
Settings to advance to another 
round of picture-taking options. 
If you’ve had enough of playing 
around with options, press OK to 
exit the menus and take your 
picture.
Figure 1-12: When you’re ready to take a 
picture, highlight Start Shooting and press OK.

27
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
As you explore the guided menus, you also can take advantage of these menu-
navigation tricks:
 
✓ Return to the previous screen. If you see a Back symbol like the one in 
the screen on the left in Figure 1-13, you can press the Multi Selector left 
to go back one screen.
 
✓ Exit a screen without making changes. Don’t see a Back button? Look 
instead for a little “turnaround” arrow like the one on the right in Figure 
1-13. Highlight that symbol and press OK to exit the current screen.
 
? 
✓ Display more help. If you see a little question mark like the one labeled 
Help symbol in Figure 1-13, press the Zoom Out button to display a help 
screen with more information. This help system is also available when 
you’re not using Guide mode; see the upcoming section “Displaying Help 
Screens” for details.
 
✓ Return to the main guided menu screen. Press the Menu button to 
jump from any screen to the initial guided menu screen, shown on the 
right in Figure 1-10.
 
✓ Exit the guided menus. If you’re on the final shooting screen (shown in 
Figure 1-12), press OK. You also can depart from your guide at any time 
by pressing the shutter button halfway and releasing it. The Shooting 
Information screen then appears on the monitor; see the “Monitoring 
Shooting Settings” section later in this chapter.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Although I appreciate the idea of the guided menus, I opted to largely ignore 
them in this book and instead show you how to perform different camera 
operations through the regular menus, which you can investigate in the next 
section. Here’s why:
 
✓ You can’t access all your camera’s features through the guided menus. 
For example, you can’t control the ISO Sensitivity setting, which deter-
mines your camera’s sensitivity to light and also affects picture quality. 
Chapter 5 covers this critical camera setting. Nor can you adjust White 
Balance, a color-related setting discussed in Chapter 6. For both set-
tings, you have to wait until you select Start Shooting on the final Shoot 
menu screen and exit the guided menus to make adjustments.
 
✓ In many cases, using the guided menus actually makes things more 
difficult. For example, if you select the Easy Operation choice on the 
Shoot menu you’re presented with a list of possible picture types. (See 
Figure 1-11.) Suppose that you select No Flash. The camera then simply 
engages the Auto Flash Off exposure mode — which you could do your-
self simply by turning the Mode dial to the No Flash symbol. (Chapter 2 
introduces you to this exposure mode.)
 
✓ Some choices Nikon made for the arrangement of the guided menus set 
you up for confusion down the line. Remember my tip in the preced-
ing steps about the Image Size and Image Quality options found in the 
Set Up section of the guided menus? Well, in the regular menus, those 
options live on the Shooting menu, not on the Setup menu. So if you 
get used to selecting those options in one place when you use guided 
menus, you have to learn a whole new organization when you move on 
to the regular menus.
 
✓ Once you get past the initial guided menu screens, some options you 
encounter aren’t any less confusing than they are when you access them 
through the main menus — witness Figure 1-13, for example. Sure, you 
can always display a help screen by pressing the Zoom Out button (the 
one with the question mark symbol), but you can get the same help 
when using regular menus, too.
Don’t get me wrong: If you like the guided menus, then by all means, take 
advantage of them. But my guess is that you don’t need any more help 
from me to do so — frankly, I’d probably insult your intelligence if I walked 
through each and every guided menu screen. I also suspect that you’re more 
interested in learning about your camera’s more advanced side, and limit-
ing future discussions to the regular menus leaves more room in the book to 
help you do just that.

Ordering off the main menus
 
MENU
 For all the reasons laid out in the preceding section, the majority of this book 
ignores the guided menus and instead features the regular menus. To display 
these menus, first set the Mode dial 
to any setting but Guide, and then 
press the Menu button.
You then see a screen similar to the 
one shown in Figure 1-14. The icons 
along the left side of the screen rep-
resent the available menus. (Table 
1-1 labels the icons and includes 
a brief description of the goodies 
found on each menu.) In the menu 
screens, the icon that is highlighted 
or appears in color is the active 
menu; options on that menu auto-
matically appear to the right. In the 
figure, the Shooting menu is active, 
for example.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options therein. The Multi Selector, shown in Figure 1-8, is the key to the 
game. You press the edges of the Multi Selector to navigate up, down, left, 
and right through the menus.
 
In this book, the instruction “Press the Multi Selector left” simply means to 
press the left edge of the control. “Press the Multi Selector right” means to 
press the right edge, and so on.
Here’s a bit more detail about the process of navigating menus:
 
✓ To select a different menu: Press the Multi Selector left to jump to the 
column containing the menu icons. Then press up or down to highlight 
the menu you want to display. Finally, press right to jump over to the 
options on the menu. 
 
✓ To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Again, use the 
Multi Selector to scroll up or down the list of options to highlight the 
feature you want to adjust and then press OK. Settings available for the 
selected item then appear. For example, if you select the Image Quality 
item from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 1-15, and 
press OK, the available Image Quality options appear, as shown on the 
right in the figure. Repeat the old up-and-down scroll routine until the 
choice you prefer is highlighted. Then press OK to return to the previ-
ous screen.
 
 In some cases, you may see a right-pointing arrowhead instead of the 
OK symbol next to an option. That’s your cue to press the Multi Selector 
right to display a submenu or other list of options (Although, most of 
the time, you also can just press the OK button if you prefer.)
Figure 1-15: Select the option you prefer and press OK again to return to the active menu.

31
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ To quickly access your 20 most 
recent menu items: The Recent 
Settings menu, shown in Figure 
1-16, provides a list of the 20 
menu items you ordered most 
recently. So if you want to adjust 
those settings, you don’t have to 
wade through all the other menus 
looking for them — just head to 
this menu instead.
Monitoring Shooting 
Settings 
Your D3000 gives you the following ways to monitor the most critical picture-
taking settings.
 
 
✓ Shooting Information display: If your eyesight is like mine, reading the 
tiny type in the viewfinder is a tad difficult. Fortunately, you also can 
press the Info button to display the Shooting Information screen on the 
monitor. As shown in Figure 1-17, the Shooting Information screen — 
which I hereby dub the Shooting Info screen to save space in this book — 
displays the current shooting settings at a size that’s a little easier on the 
eyes and also provides more 
detailed data than the viewfinder. 
If you rotate the camera to com-
pose a portrait shot (the image is 
taller than it is wide), the Shooting 
Info display rotates as well. To 
turn off the display, just press the 
Info button again.
 
 In this book, I show the screen 
with the black-and-white color 
scheme you see in Figure 1-17, 
instead of the default colors, 
which feature white text on a 
greenish background and don’t 
reproduce as well in print. To 
find out how to change the color 
scheme, see the section 
“Customizing Your Camera” later 
in this chapter.
Figure 1-16: The Recent Settings menu offers 
quick access to the last 20 menu options you 
selected.
Battery status
Shots remaining
Figure 1-17: Press the Info button to view 
picture-taking settings on the monitor.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Viewfinder: You can view some 
camera settings in the view-
finder as well. For example, the 
data in Figure 1-18 shows the 
current shutter speed, f-stop, 
ISO setting, and number of shots 
remaining. The exact view-
finder information that appears 
depends on what action you’re 
currently undertaking.
If what you see in Figures 1-17 and 
1-18 looks like a big confusing mess, 
don’t worry. Many of the settings 
relate to options that won’t mean any-
thing to you until you make your way through later chapters and explore the 
advanced exposure modes. But do make note of the following two key points 
of data that are helpful even when you shoot in the fully automatic modes:
 
✓ Battery status indicator: A full battery icon like the one in Figure 1-17 
shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon appears empty, go 
look for your battery charger.
 
 Your viewfinder also displays a tiny low-battery icon when things get to 
the dangerous point. It appears in the lower-left corner of the framing 
screen (that is, not on the row of camera-settings data, but actually in 
the image area).
 
✓ Pictures remaining: Labeled in Figure 1-17 and also visible in the view-
finder in Figure 1-18, this value (22, in the figures) indicates how many 
additional pictures you can store on the current memory card. If the 
number exceeds 999, the value is presented a little differently. The initial 
K appears above the value to indicate that the first value represents the 
picture count in thousands. For example, 1.0K means that you can store 
1,000 more pictures (K being a universally accepted symbol indicating 
1,000 units). The number is then rounded down to the nearest hundred. 
So if the card has room for, say, 1,230 more pictures, the value reads 1.2K.
Using the Quick Settings Screen
A feature called the Quick Settings display does just what its name implies: It 
enables you to adjust many picture-taking settings faster than you can by dig-
ging through camera menus.
Figure 1-18: You also can view some camera 
information at the bottom of the viewfinder.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Here’s how it works:
 
 
1. Display the Shooting Info screen, as shown on the left in Figure 1-19.
 
 You can do this by pressing the Info button or pressing the shutter 
button halfway and then releasing it.

2. Press the Zoom In button to shift to the Quick Settings screen, shown 
on the right in the figure.
 
 Notice the little “i” above the button face. That stands for Information 
Edit, which is the other name Nikon gives to this button. (Again, in this 
book, I stick with one name per button to avoid confusion.)
 
 If you find it easier, you can simply press the Zoom In button twice: once 
to bring up the Shooting Information screen and again to shift to the 
Quick Settings screen.
 
3. Use the Multi Selector to highlight the setting you want to change.
 
 The available settings are represented by the icons along the right side 
and bottom of the screen. A little label appears at the top of the screen 
to tell you the name of the selected setting. For example, in Figure 1-19, 
the Image Quality setting is selected.
 
4. Press OK to jump to a screen that contains the available settings for 
the selected option.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 For example, Figure 1-20 shows 
the available Image Quality 
options.
 
5. Use the Multi Selector to high-
light your choice and then 
press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Quick 
Settings display.
 
6. To exit the Quick Settings dis-
play, press the shutter button 
halfway and release it.
 
 
 You can also press the Info 
button again or just go ahead 
and take your next picture.
Displaying Help Screens
 
? If you see a small question mark in the lower-left corner of a menu, press 
and hold the Zoom Out button — note the question-mark label above the 
button — to display information about the current shooting mode or 
selected menu option. For example, 
Figure 1-21 shows the Help screen 
associated with the ISO setting. If you 
need to scroll the screen to view all 
the Help text, keep the button 
depressed and scroll by using the 
Multi Selector. Release the button to 
close the information screen.
 
A blinking question mark in the view-
finder or Shooting Info screen indi-
cates that the camera wants to alert 
you to a problem. Again, press the 
Zoom Out button to see what solution 
the camera suggests.
Customizing Your Camera
Your camera offers scads of options for customizing its performance. Later 
chapters explain settings related to actual picture taking, such as those 
that affect flash behavior and autofocusing. The rest of this chapter details 
Figure 1-20: Highlight the setting you want 
to use and press OK to return to the Quick 
Settings screen.

button to display onscreen help.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
options found on the Setup menu, 
which relate to the basic camera 
interface and operation.
To access the Setup menu, first set 
the Mode dial on top of the camera to 
any setting except Guide. Now press 
the Menu button to display the regular 
menus. The Setup menu is the one 
marked with the little wrench icon, as 
shown in Figure 1-22.
Figure 1-22 shows just the first screen 
of menu options; the menu actually 
contains three and a half screens of 
settings. Press the Multi Selector up 
and down to scroll through the menu.
Here’s what you can accomplish with the first seven options, shown in 
Figure 1-22:
 
✓ Reset Setup Options: You can use this option to restore all the Setup 
menu options to their default settings. Before you do, though, see the 
last section of this chapter for some important details.
 
✓ Format Memory Card: You can use this command to format your 
memory card, which wipes all data off the card and ensures that it’s 
properly set up to record pictures. See the earlier section “Working with 
Memory Cards” for more details about formatting.
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor 
brighter or darker, as shown in Figure 1-23. If you take this step, keep in 
mind that what you see on the display may not be an accurate rendition 
of the actual exposure of your image. Crank up the monitor brightness, 
for example, and an underexposed photo may look just fine. So I recom-
mend that you keep the brightness at the default setting (0). A second 
option on this menu, Auto Dim, causes the screen to dim gradually (to 
save battery power) when the Shooting Info screen is displayed. The 
feature is turned on by default.
 
✓ Info Display Format: You can use this command to customize the 
appearance of the Shooting Info screen. You can choose from two 
styles, Classic and Graphic, and for each style, you can select from 
three color schemes. Furthermore, you can specify one style and color 
scheme for the screens that appear when you have the Mode dial set to 
the Auto and Scene modes and use another design for the P, S, A, and M 
modes. Figure 1-24 shows you a couple of the possible variations. The 
two on the left show the Graphic style; the two on the right illustrate 
the Classic style.

your camera’s basic appearance and 
operation.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Auto Info Display: As with the Info Display Format, you can set this 
option separately for the Auto/Scene modes and the advanced modes 
(P, S, M, and A). When you enable the option, the Shooting Info screen 
appears when you press the shutter button halfway and release it. And, 
if you disable Image Review (an option covered in Chapter 4), the screen 
also appears after you take a picture. When this option is set to Off, the 
screen appears briefly when you first turn on the camera, but after that, 
you must press the Info button or the Zoom In button to display it.
 
✓ Clean Image Sensor: Your D3000 is set up at the factory to perform an 
internal cleaning routine each time you turn the camera on or off. This 
cleaning system is designed to keep the image sensor — that’s the part 
of the camera that actually captures the image — free of dust and dirt.
 
 By choosing the Clean Image Sensor menu item, you can perform a 
cleaning at any time, however. Just choose the menu item, press OK, 
select Clean Now, and press OK again. (Nikon recommends that you 
set the camera on a solid surface, base down, when you perform the 
cleaning.) Don’t try to perform the cleaning several times in a row, by 
the way — if you do, the camera will temporarily disable the function 
to protect itself.
 
 The other option available through the Clean Image Sensor item, called 
Clean At, enables you to specify whether you want the camera to change 
from the default setting (cleaning at startup and shutdown) to clean only 
at startup, only at shutdown, or never. I suggest that you stick with the 
default, however.
 
✓ Mirror Lock-Up: This feature is necessary when cleaning the camera 
interior — an operation that I don’t recommend that you tackle your-
self because you can easily damage the camera if you don’t know what 
you’re doing. And if you’ve used mirror lock-up on a film camera to avoid 
camera shake when shooting long-exposure images, note that in this case, 
the lock-up feature is provided for cleaning purposes only. You can’t take 
pictures on the D3000 while the mirror lock-up option is enabled.
To get to the next seven customization options, use the Multi Selector to 
scroll to the second screen of the Setup menu, shown in Figure 1-25:
 
✓ Video Mode: This option is related to viewing your images on a tele-
vision, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North 
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 
✓ Time Zone and Date: When you turn on your camera for the very first 
time, it automatically displays this option and asks you to set the cur-
rent date and time. Keeping the date and time accurate is important 

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
because that information is 
recorded as part of the image 
file. In your photo browser, you 
can then see when you shot an 
image and, equally handy, search 
for images by the date they were 
taken.
 
✓ Language: You’re asked to 
specify a language along with the 
date and time when you fire up 
your camera for the first time. 
Your choice determines the lan-
guage of text on the camera moni-
tor. Screens in this book display 
the English language, but I find it 
entertaining on occasion to hand 
my camera to a friend after changing the language to, say, Swedish. 
I’m a real yokester, yah?
 
✓ Image Comment: See Chapter 11 to find out how to use this feature, 
which enables you to add text comments into a picture file. You then 
can read that information in Nikon ViewNX, the software that shipped 
with your camera. (The text doesn’t actually appear on the image itself.)
 
✓ Auto Image Rotation: Keep this option set at the default setting (On) so 
that the image is automatically rotated to the correct orientation (hori-
zontal or vertical) in playback mode. The orientation is recorded as part 
of the image file, too, so the auto-rotating also occurs when you browse 
your image thumbnails in ViewNX. Note: The rotation data may not be 
accurate for pictures that you take with the camera pointing directly up 
or down. See Chapter 4 for more about picture playback. Also, when you 
shoot pictures in burst mode, the first image of the sequence is used as 
the basis for rotation, even if you rotate the camera while shooting the 
sequence.
 
✓ Dust Off Ref Photo: This specialty feature enables you to record an 
image that serves as a point of reference for the automatic dust-removal 
filter available in Nikon Capture NX 2. I don’t cover this accessory soft-
ware, which must be purchased separately, in this book.
 
✓ Auto Off Timers: To help save battery power, your camera automati-
cally shuts off the monitor, viewfinder, and the exposure metering 
system if you don’t perform any camera operations for a period of time. 
Through the Auto Off Timers menu option, you can specify how long 
you want the camera to wait before taking that step.
 
 After selecting the option, press OK to display the screen shown on the 
left in Figure 1-26. Here, you can select from three prefab timing set-
tings, Short, Normal, and Long. If none of those settings works well for 
Figure 1-25: Press the Multi Selector up or 
down to scroll to this second screen of the 
menu.

39
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
you, choose Custom, which displays the screen shown on the right in 
the figure. You then can customize the shut-off timing for playback and 
menu display, image review, and metering independently. If you go this 
route, be sure to highlight Done, as shown in the figure, and press OK 
after changing the settings. Otherwise, your changes don’t “stick.”
Figure 1-26: Through the Auto Off Timers option, you can adjust the timing of automatic shut-
down of the monitor, viewfinder, and exposure meter.
Scrolling to the third screen of the Setup menu, shown in Figure 1-27, brings 
you to the following additional setup options:
 
✓ Self-Timer Delay: This setting 
comes into play when you take 
pictures using the Self-Timer 
Release mode, covered in 
Chapter 2. Your choice deter-
mines how long the camera waits 
to record the picture after you 
press the shutter button.
 
✓ Remote On Duration: Don’t 
worry about this setting unless 
you use a wireless remote control 
unit to trigger the shutter release. 
If you do buy that optional unit, 
see Chapter 2 for details about 
the two relevant Release mode 
settings and a bit more about this 
Setup menu option.
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera beeps at you after certain operations, 
such as after it sets focus when you shoot in autofocus mode. If you’re 
doing top-secret surveillance work and need the camera to hush up, 
Figure 1-27: Scroll further down the 
Setup menu to uncover these additional 
customization options. 

40
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
set this option to Off. On the Shooting Info display, a little musical note 
icon appears when the beep is enabled. Turn the beep off, and the icon 
appears in a circle with a slash through it.
 
✓ Viewfinder Options: This option, featured on the left side of Figure 1-28, 
enables you to display gridlines in the viewfinder, as shown on the right. 
The gridlines are a great help when you need to ensure the alignment of 
objects in your photo — for example, to make sure that the horizon is 
level in a landscape. Set the Viewfinder Grid option to On to enable the 
feature.
 
 The Rangefinder option, when enabled, replaces the standard exposure 
meter with the rangefinder, a manual focusing aid you can explore in 
Chapter 6.
 
✓ File Number Sequence: This option controls how the camera names 
your picture files. When the option is set to Off, as it is by default, the 
camera restarts file numbering at 0001 every time you format your 
memory card or insert a new memory card. Numbering is also restarted 
if you create custom folders (an advanced option covered in Chapter 11). 
 
 Needless to say, this setup can cause problems over time, creating a 
scenario where you wind up with multiple images that have the same 
filename — not on the current memory card, but when you download 
images to your computer. So I strongly encourage you to set the option to 
On, as shown in Figure 1-27. Note that when you get to picture number 
9999, file numbering is still reset to 0001, however. The camera automati-
cally creates a new folder to hold for your next 9999 images.
 
 As for the Reset option, it enables you to assign the first file number 
(which ends in 0001) to the next picture you shoot. Then the camera 
behaves as if you selected the On setting.
Figure 1-28: You can display gridlines in the viewfinder to help align your shot.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 Should you be a really, really prolific shooter and snap enough pictures 
to reach image 9999 in folder 999, the camera will refuse to take another 
photo until you choose that Reset option and either format the memory 
card or insert a brand new one.
 
✓ Buttons: Through this Setup menu item, you can change the function 
of the Function button and the AE-L/AF-L button. You can also specify 
whether you want a half-press of the shutter button to lock focus 
only, as it does by default, or lock focus and exposure together. For 
now, leave all three options alone so that the instructions you find in 
this book work the way they should. When you’re ready to go further, 
Chapter 11 shows you how to customize the button functions.
 
✓ No Memory Card: Keep this one set at the default (Release Locked), 
which disables the shutter button when no memory card is in the 
camera. If you set it to Enable Release, you can take a temporary picture, 
which appears in the monitor with the word “Demo” but isn’t recorded 
anywhere. (The feature is provided mainly for use in camera stores, 
enabling salespeople to demonstrate the camera without having to keep 
a memory card installed.)
Scrolling one more screen through the menu brings you to the following 
remaining setup options:
 
✓ Date Imprint: Through this option, you can choose to imprint the shoot-
ing date, date and time, or the number of days that have passed since 
you took the photo. This feature works only with pictures that you shoot 
in the JPEG file format; see Chapter 3 for details about file formats.
 
 The default setting, which disables the imprint, is the best way to go, 
however; you don’t need to permanently mar your photos to find out 
when you took them. Every picture file includes a hidden vat of text 
data, called metadata, that records the shooting date and time, as well as 
all the camera settings you used — f-stop, shutter speed, and lots more. 
You can view this data in the free software provided with your camera 
as well as in many photo programs. Chapter 8 shows you how.
 
✓ Active Folder: You need to pay attention to this option only if you 
create custom image folders, an advanced feature you can explore in 
Chapter 11. If you take that step, you specify which folder you want to 
use for your next photos through this menu option. You also must spec-
ify which folder you want to view during playback. Chapter 4 discusses 
playback options.
 
✓ Eye-Fi Upload: This option appears on the menu only if you insert an 
Eye-Fi memory card in your camera. Eye-Fi cards enable you to transmit 
your files wirelessly to other devices. That’s a cool feature, but unfor-
tunately, the cards themselves are significantly more expensive than 

42
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
regular cards. If you do choose to use them and you find yourself in an 
area that does not allow wireless transmissions (such as hospitals and 
the like), you can disable the feature through this menu option. You also 
initiate the wireless transfer through the option.
 
✓ Firmware Version: Select this option and press OK to view what version 
of the camera firmware, or internal software, your camera is running. 
You see two firmware items, A and B. At the time this book was written, 
both A and B were version 1.00.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. You can find detailed instructions on 
how to download and install any firmware updates on the site.
Restoring Default Settings
You can quickly reset all the options on the Shooting menu by selecting 
Reset Shooting Options, as shown on the left in Figure 1-29. Likewise, the 
Setup menu also has a Reset Setup Options item to restore all settings on that 
menu, as shown on the right.
Figure 1-29: Choose the Reset option to return to the default settings for the respective menu.
A couple of potential flies in the ointment:
 
✓ Resetting the Shooting menu defaults wipes out any customizations you 
made to the Picture Control settings — for example, if you tweaked the 
Vivid option to produce even more saturated colors than the default set-
ting produces. Chapter 6 introduces you to Picture Controls.

43
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ More worrisome is that resetting the Setup menu restores the File Number 
Sequence option to its default, Off, which is most definitely Not a Good 
Thing. So if you restore the menu defaults, be sure that you revisit that 
option and return it to the On setting. See the preceding section for details.
 
✓ Resetting the Setup menu does not affect the Video Mode, Time Zone 
and Date, Language, or Active Folder options, on the other hand. So you 
need to adjust those settings individually if needed.

A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television com-
mercials from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” 
declared one actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. 
Then a narrator declared the debate a tie and spoke the 
famous catchphrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Nikon D3000. On 
one hand, it provides a full range of powerful con-
trols, offering just about every feature a serious 
photographer could want. On the other, it offers 
automated photography modes that enable people 
with absolutely no experience to capture beautiful 
images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” “It’s 
as easy as ‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two, two cam-
eras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with 
your camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters 
cover. This chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side. 
Because even when you shoot in automatic exposure and focus modes, 
following a few basic guidelines can help you get better results. For example, 

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
your camera offers a variety of automatic exposure modes, some of which 
may be new to you. The mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chap-
ter explains those options. In addition, this chapter reviews flash options 
available to you in automatic modes and covers techniques that enable you 
to get the best performance from your camera’s autofocus and autoexposure 
systems.
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your D3000 offers several automatic photography modes, all of which I 
explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good 
photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
 
 To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Auto, as shown in the 
left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the A 
(autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. The figure and 
these instructions assume that you’re using the kit lens — the 18–55mm AF-S 
VR lens bundled with the D3000. If you use some other lens, see Chapter 1 for 
information about autofocusing and manual focusing.
 
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the VR (vibration reduction) switch 
to the On setting, as shown in Figure 2-1. This feature is designed to produce 
sharper images by compensating for camera movement that can occur when 
you handhold the camera. Again, Figure 2-1 features a Nikon VR lens; for 
other lenses, check your lens manual for details about using its vibration 
reduction feature, if provided.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic 
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture:
 
1. Looking through the viewfinder, 
frame the image so that your 
subject appears under one of the 
11 focusing points, as shown in 
Figure 2-2.
 
 The focusing points are those 
tiny rectangles you see clustered 
near the center of viewfinder. I 
labeled one of the little guys in 
the figure.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter 
button halfway down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus system 
begins to do its thing. In dim 
light, a little lamp located on the 
front of the camera, just to the 
left of the shutter button, may shoot out a beam of light. That lamp, 
called the autofocus-assist illuminator, or AF-assist lamp for short, helps 
the camera measure the distance between your subject and the lens so 
that it can better establish focus. 
 
 At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects 
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two criti-
cal exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; 
in Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/125 second, and the f-stop is f/5.6. 
(Chapter 5 explains these two 
options in detail.) The built-in 
flash may pop up if the camera 
thinks additional light is needed.
 
 When the camera has established 
focus, one or more of the points 
appears surrounded by black 
rectangles, as shown in Figure 
2-3. The focusing points that are 
hugged by those rectangles rep-
resent the areas of the frame that 
are now in focus. In the display 
at the bottom of the viewfinder, 
the green focus lamp, labeled in 
the figure, lights to give you fur-
ther notice that focus has been 
achieved.

viewfinder indicate autofocus points.

Figure 2-3: The green light indicates that 
the camera has locked focus on the objects 
under the bracketed focusing points.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 The autoexposure meter continues monitoring the light up to the time 
you take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed values in the view-
finder may change if the lighting conditions change.
 
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
 
 While the camera sends the image 
data to the camera memory card, the 
memory card access lamp lights, as 
shown in Figure 2-4. Don’t turn off the 
camera or remove the memory card 
while the lamp is lit, or you may damage 
both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is finished, 
the picture appears briefly on the 
camera monitor. If the picture doesn’t 
appear or you want to take a longer 
look at the image, see Chapter 4, which 
covers picture playback.
 
I need to add a few important points about 
working in the Auto mode and the other point-
and-shoot modes covered in this chapter: 
 
✓ Release mode options: The steps 
here assume that you are using the default Release mode, in which the 
camera records a single image with each press of the shutter button. For 
a look at other options — continuous (burst mode) shooting, self-timer 
shooting, and remote-control shooting — see the section, “Changing the 
(Shutter Button) Release Mode,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash options: Whether you can use flash and which flash modes are 
available depend on the automatic exposure mode you use. See the next 
section for details.
 
✓ Autofocus options: Assuming that your lens can autofocus with the 
D3000, you can choose to focus manually or take advantage of autofo-
cusing in any exposure mode. If you go the autofocus route, you can cus-
tomize the behavior of the autofocus system through options discussed 
in Chapter 6. Instructions in this chapter assume that you stick with the 
default autofocus options. 
 
 But understand that in some cases, no amount of fiddling with the 
autofocus settings will help your camera lock focus where you intend. 
Some subjects just give autofocusing systems fits: Highly reflective 
Memory card access lamp

lamp lights while the camera sends 
the picture data to the card.

49
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
objects, subjects behind fence bars, and scenes in which little contrast 
exists between the subject and the background are just a few potential 
problem areas.
 
 My advice? If the autofocus mechanism can’t lock onto your subject 
after a few seconds, just switch to manual focusing and be done with it. 
See Chapter 1 for a primer in manual focusing.
 
✓ Exposure problems: If an exposure meter appears in the viewfinder or 
Shooting Info display, the camera can’t select settings that will properly 
exposure the picture. See Chapter 5 for details about reading the expo-
sure meter and coping with exposure problems.
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus 
or manual focus mode, you determine only the 
point of sharpest focus. The distance to which 
that sharp-focus zone extends from that point — 
what photographers call the depth of field — 
depends in part on the aperture setting, or 
f-stop, which is an exposure control. Some 
of the D3000’s Scene modes are designed to 
choose aperture settings that deliver a certain 
depth of field. 
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — 
an artistic choice that most people prefer 
for portraits. On the flip side of the coin, the 
Landscape setting selects an aperture that pro-
duces a large depth of field so that both fore-
ground and background objects appear tack 
sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your D3000, the 
camera chooses a fast shutter speed in Sports 
mode. 
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The 
faster the shutter speed, the shorter the expo-
sure time, which reduces the time that you 
need to keep the camera absolutely still. If 
you’re using the Nikon D3000 kit lens, you can 
also improve your odds of shake-free shots by 
enabling the vibration reduction (VR) feature. 
(Set the switch on the lens to the On position.) 
For a very slow shutter speed, using a tripod is 
the best way to avoid camera shake; be sure to 
turn the VR off when you do so. 
Keep in mind, too, that the range of f-stops and 
shutter speeds the camera can select in any of 
the automatic exposure modes depends on the 
lighting conditions. When you’re shooting at 
night, for example, the camera may not be able 
to select a shutter speed fast enough to stop 
action even in Sports mode.
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of 
field to a greater extent than the automated 
exposure modes allow, visit Chapter 6. For an 
explanation of the role of shutter speed and 
aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5.

Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
The built-in flash on your D3000 offers a variety of different modes. Table 2-1 
offers a quick-reference guide to the six basic modes. In addition to these 
basic modes, the camera also offers some combo modes, such as Auto with 
Red-Eye Reduction, Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, and the like.

You can check the current flash mode in the Shooting Info display, as shown 
on the left in Figure 2-5.The viewfinder display doesn’t advise you of the 
specific flash mode but instead just displays the universal lightning bolt icon 
when the flash is enabled, as shown on the right in the figure, and hides the 
icon when the flash is disabled. If you disable the flash and the camera thinks 
you’re making a mistake, the flash symbol blinks in both displays.
 
 To change the flash mode, press and hold the Flash button (on the left front 
side of the camera) to display the screen you see in Figure 2-6. Keep holding 
the button as you rotate the Command dial to cycle through the flash modes 
available for your selected exposure mode.
You can also change the flash mode by using the Quick Settings screen. After 
highlighting the Flash Mode icon, as shown on the left in Figure 2-7, press OK 
to display the right screen in the figure. Highlight your choice and press OK. 
(See Chapter 1 if you need help using the Quick Settings display.)

Now for the bad news: When you do 
try to change the flash mode, you’ll 
quickly discover that you have access 
to only a couple of flash modes when 
you shoot in the automatic expo-
sure modes covered in this chapter. 
Additionally, you don’t have access to 
flash compensation, which enables you 
to diminish or strengthen the burst of 
light the flash produces, as well as a 
few other flash features your camera 
offers. Bummer, as the youngsters say.
The upcoming sections tell you which 
flash modes are available in each of 
the fully automatic exposure modes. 
For more details about flash photography, see Chapter 5.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Exploring Your Automatic Exposure Options
Your D3000 offers eight fully automatic 
exposure modes, which you access via the 
Mode dial, shown in Figure 2-8. Your choices 
include regular, everyday Auto, which is a 
general purpose, point-and-shoot type of 
option, Auto Flash Off, which does the same 
thing as Auto but without flash, plus six 
Scene modes, which are geared to shooting 
specific types of pictures.
The next sections provide details on each 
of these options. For information about the 
four other settings on the Mode dial — P 
(programmed autoexposure), S (shutter-
priority autoexposure), A (aperture-priority 
autoexposure), and M (manual exposure) — 
see Chapter 5.
 
Remember that in any of these exposure modes, you have the option to focus 
manually or take advantage of autofocusing, assuming that your lens is capa-
ble of autofocusing with the D3000. (See Chapter 1 for details on that issue.)
Auto mode
 
 In Auto mode, represented on the Mode dial by the icon you see in the 
margin here, the camera selects all settings based on the scene that it detects 
in front of the lens. Your only job is to lock in focus, either by using the auto-
focus technique that I outline at the beginning of the chapter or by using the 
manual-focusing method explained in Chapter 1.
Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these details in 
mind:
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default settings, autofocusing works like so:
 
• AF-area mode: The Auto Area option is selected by default. That 
means that the camera analyzes the scene and then selects which 
of the 11 autofocus points to use when establishing focus. Chapter 
6 explains how to modify this autofocusing behavior.
 
• Focus mode: The default setting is AF-A, which stands for auto-servo 
autofocus. If the subject isn’t moving, focus remains locked as long 
as you hold the shutter button halfway down. But if the camera 
Fully Automatic modes

fully automatic, point-and-shoot 
photography modes.

53
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
detects motion, it continually adjusts focus up to the time you 
press the button fully to record the picture. To ensure that focus is 
correct, you must keep your subject within the area of the view-
finder covered by the focusing points. You can’t alter this aspect of 
the focusing system in Auto mode as you can in the advanced 
exposure modes. Your only other option is to switch to manual 
focusing. See the Chapter 6 section related to the Focus mode 
option for details.
 
✓ Flash: You have only three flash mode choices: Auto, Auto with Red-Eye 
Reduction, and Off. (See Table 2-1 for a reminder of what these modes 
do.) You can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter 
doesn’t sense that additional light is needed.
 
✓ Color: You don’t have access to the main color-correction control, 
White Balance. If the image displays a color cast (white objects in the 
scene are not pure white in the image), you must switch to a mode that 
enables you to adjust the White Balance setting, covered in Chapter 6. 
You do have the option to change from the default color space, sRGB, 
to Adobe RGB; again, Chapter 6 helps you sort out this bit of business. 
(Stick with sRGB for now.)
 
✓ Exposure: You have access to only two exposure-adjustment options:
 
• ISO Sensitivity: The ISO setting determines the light sensitivity of 
the camera — or, to put it another way, how much light is needed 
to properly expose the image. By default, this option is set to Auto, 
and the camera adjusts the ISO Sensitivity as needed. 
 
• Active D-Lighting: This feature applies an adjustment designed to 
improve scenes that contain both very light and very dark areas. 
Shadows are brightened, but highlights are left intact when you 
enable this feature. The default setting is Off.
 
 You control both settings through the Shooting menu; Chapter 5 has 
details.
 
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Auto mode 
because, frankly, the results that this setting creates vary widely depending 
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait, 
landscape, action shot, or whatever, as well as on lighting conditions. But the 
bottom line is that Auto mode is a one-size-fits-all approach that may or may 
not take best advantage of your camera’s capabilities. So if you want to more 
consistently take great pictures instead of merely good ones, I encourage you 
to explore the exposure, focus, and color information found in Part II so that 
you can abandon this mode in favor of modes that put more photographic 
decisions in your hands.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Auto Flash Off mode
 
 The Auto Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Auto mode but ensures 
that the flash doesn’t fire. In other words, think of this mode as a faster alter-
native to selecting Auto mode and then changing the flash setting to Off. 
From a practical standpoint, this mode provides an easy way to ensure that 
you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that don’t permit flash: 
museums, churches, and so on.
Scene modes
In Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you want 
to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to rely 
on the camera to make that judgment, your D3000 offers six Scene modes, 
which are designed to automatically capture specific scenes in ways that are 
traditionally considered best from a creative standpoint. For example, most 
people prefer portraits that have softly focused backgrounds. So in Portrait 
mode, the camera selects settings that can produce that type of background. 
 
All the Scene modes share a few limitations: 
 
✓ Exposure: As with Auto mode, the camera takes complete control of 
exposure, with the exception of the ISO Sensitivity setting and Active 
D-Lighting, introduced in the preceding section and detailed in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Autofocusing: You get the same choices as in Auto mode — that is, you 
can adjust the AF-Area mode option but not the Focus mode setting 
(except to choose MF for manual focusing). Chapter 6 details both 
features. 
 
✓ Color: You have little control over color; the only color option avail-
able is to switch the color mode from sRGB to Adobe RGB — which you 
shouldn’t do until you explore the consequences in Chapter 6. Some 
modes manipulate colors in ways that you may or may not appreciate, 
and you’re stuck if you have a color cast problem.
 
✓ Flash: Available flash options vary depending on the Scene mode you 
select, but none of the modes offers complete flash flexibility.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of the 
Scene modes. To see whether you approve of how your camera approaches 
the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t happy with the results, 
you can switch to one of the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, or M) and 
then check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to manipulate whatever aspect of 
the picture isn’t to your liking.

55
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Portrait and Child modes
The Portrait and Child modes are so closely related that it makes sense to 
consider them together.
 
 First, Portrait mode. This mode selects an aperture setting designed to pro-
duce a short depth of field, which results in a slightly blurry background and 
thus puts the visual emphasis on your subject. Figure 2-9 offers an example. 
However, this effect occurs only if your subject is at least a few feet from the 
background. The extent to which the background blurs also depends on the 
other depth-of-field factors that I discuss in Chapter 6. Portrait mode also 
selects settings designed to produce natural skin tones. 
What does [r 12] in the viewfinder mean?
When you look in your viewfinder to frame a 
shot, the initial value shown in brackets at the 
right end of the viewfinder display indicates 
the number of additional pictures that can fit 
on your memory card at the currently selected 
Image Size and Image Quality settings. (Chapter 
3 explains those settings.) For example, in the 
left viewfinder image below, the value shows 
that the card can hold 273 more images.
As soon as you press the shutter button half-
way, which kicks the autofocus and exposure 
mechanisms into action, that value changes to 
instead show you how many pictures can fit in 
the camera’s memory buffer. In the right image 
here, for example, the r 12 value tells you that 
12 pictures can fit in the buffer. This number 
also varies depending on the size and quality 
settings you use. (The dot at the left end of the 
display is the focus lamp, which lights when 
focus is achieved.)
So what’s the buffer? It’s a temporary storage 
tank where the camera stores picture data 
until it has time to fully record that data onto 
the camera memory card. This system exists 
so that you can take a continuous series of pic-
tures without having to wait between shots until 
each image is fully written to the memory card. 
When the buffer is full, the camera automati-
cally disables the shutter button until it catches 
up on its recording work. Chances are, though, 
that you’ll very rarely, if ever, encounter this sit-
uation; the camera is usually more than capable 
of keeping up with your shooting rate. 
For more information about rapid-fire photogra-
phy, see the section on action photography in 
Chapter 7. And for help translating all the other 
viewfinder information, check out Chapter 5.

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 Child mode, represented by the toddler 
icon you see in the margin here, offers a 
slight variation on the theme. It differs 
from Portrait mode in a couple of ways:
 
✓ In Child mode, the camera renders 
hues that are traditionally found 
in clothing and backgrounds more 
boldly than in Portrait mode. In 
Figure 2-10, for example, notice 
that the football and the little 
boy’s shorts are noticeably more 
vivid than in the Portrait mode 
example in Figure 2-9. Skin tones 
are left natural, although they, too, 
can appear a little more saturated, 
depending on the subject and the 
lighting.
 
✓ Child mode chooses an aperture 
setting that’s designed to produce 
a slightly larger depth of field than 
Portrait mode. That extra depth 
of field can come in handy if the 
children in question are moving a 
little because they’re more likely 
to remain within the zone of sharp 
focus. However, in order to bal-
ance out the change in aperture, 
Child mode must use a slightly 
slower shutter speed than Portrait. 
So for subjects that are really 
on the move, you typically have 
better results with Sports mode, 
which favors a faster shutter, to 
freeze action, over depth-of-field 
considerations.
Understand that the aperture and shut-
ter speed the camera selects in either 
mode depend greatly on the available 
light, the subject, and the range of aper-
ture settings on your lens. Your mileage 
may vary, as they say. Sometimes you 
may see very little difference between 
the two modes except for the more-
vivid background colors of Child mode.
Portrait mode
Figure 2-9: Portrait mode produces a softly 
focused background and natural skin tones.
Child mode
Figure 2-10: Child mode renders non-skin 
tones more vividly than Portrait mode.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Both modes have these traits in common:
 
✓ Autofocusing: Autofocusing works as it does for Auto mode, described 
earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash: You can choose from Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction flash, or 
Off. You can’t enable the flash, though, if the camera doesn’t think extra 
lighting is needed. This restriction can be problematic when shooting 
outdoor portraits, which often benefit from a small pop of flash light 
even in bright sunlight. See Chapter 7 for an example as well as some 
other tips on shooting portraits by flash light. 
In my experience, the biggest decision about whether to use Portrait or Child 
mode depends on your color preferences. I prefer Portrait mode because the 
strengthened background colors in Child mode can easily distract the eye 
from the subject’s face, which should be the point of emphasis in any portrait.
Landscape mode
 
 Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very 
shallow depth of field (small zone of 
sharp focus), Landscape mode — 
which is designed for capturing scenic 
vistas, city skylines, and other large-
scale subjects — goes the other route, 
selecting an aperture setting (f-stop) 
that produces a large depth of field. As 
a result, objects both close to the 
camera and at a distance appear 
sharply focused. Figure 2-11 offers an 
example.
Note these other factoids about 
Landscape mode:
 
✓ Depth of field: As with Portrait 
mode, the camera manipulates 
depth of field by adjusting the 
aperture setting (f-stop). To pro-
duce the larger depth of field, the 
camera tries to use a high f-stop 
value, which means a very small 
aperture. But in dim lighting, the 
camera may be forced to open 
the aperture to allow enough 
light into the camera to properly 
Figure 2-11: Landscape mode produces a 
large zone of sharp focus and also boosts 
color intensity slightly.

58
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
expose the photo, so the depth of field may not be enough to keep the 
entire landscape in sharp focus. (Again, Chapter 5 offers a primer on 
aperture; Chapter 6 fully explains depth of field.)
 
✓ Color and contrast: This mode boosts color saturation and contrast 
slightly to produce the kind of bold, rich hues that most people prefer in 
landscape pictures. In addition, greens and blues are emphasized. If you 
want more control, switch to an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M) 
and see Chapter 6 for details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: By default, the camera uses the Single Point AF-Area mode 
setting. That means that it looks at only one autofocus point to estab-
lish focus rather than considering all 11. The center autofocus point is 
selected automatically, but you can use the Multi Selector to select a dif-
ferent focus point. The Focus mode is set to AF-A by default. The camera 
locks focus when you depress the shutter button halfway — unless it 
senses a moving subject, in which case focus is continually adjusted up 
to the time you take the shot. Your other Focus mode option is MF for 
manual focus. See Chapter 6 for help with all this autofocus stuff.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: 
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting 
most landscapes anyway. However, if you attach an external flash unit, 
you can use it in this mode. (Chapter 5 discusses external flash units.)
Sports mode
 
 Sports mode activates a number of settings that can help you photograph a 
moving object, whether it’s an athlete, a race car, or a romping dog like the 
one in Figure 2-12. That’s my Wheaten Terrier furkid exhibiting his normal 
reaction to hearing me yell, “Dinner!” (Come to think of it, that’s my reaction 
to a dinner bell, too. . . .) 
Here’s what you need to know about using Sports mode: 
 
✓ Shutter speed: In order to catch a moving subject without blur, you 
need a fast shutter speed. So in Sports mode, the camera automatically 
chooses that fast shutter speed for you.
 
 Understand, though, that in dim lighting, the camera may not be able 
to select a very fast shutter speed and still deliver a good exposure. 
And because getting a good exposure trumps all, the shutter speed the 
camera uses may not be fast enough to “freeze” action, especially if your 
subject is moving very quickly.
 
 In Figure 2-12, the camera selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, 
catch my boy in mid-romp, although if you look very closely, you can 
see some slight blurring of his beard. Because of the very bright light, 

59
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
the camera also selected 
a small aperture setting, 
which produces a large 
depth of field — so the 
grass in the background is 
as sharply focused as that 
in the foreground. To fully 
understand these issues, 
explore Chapters 5 and 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: The camera 
sets the AF-Area mode 
option to the Dynamic 
Area mode. Chapter 6 
provides full details, but 
here’s the short story: 
You use the Multi Selector 
to indicate which focus-
ing point you want the 
camera to use when 
calculating the focusing 
distance. But if the object 
moves out of that point, 
the camera tries to draw 
focus information from 
the other points. With 
luck, your subject will 
move within one of the 
focus points before you 
record the image.
 
 Additionally, Sports 
mode selects the AF-A 
Focus mode, which means that if the camera detects motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus up to the time you fully depress the shutter button 
and take the shot. Your other option is MF mode, for manual focusing. 
(Chapter 6 details the Focus mode options as well.)
 
 If your subject moves after you press the shutter button halfway, be 
sure that you adjust the framing so that the subject remains under one 
of the focus points. Otherwise, the camera may not lock focus on the 
subject correctly.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled. That can be a problem in low-light 
situations, but it also enables you to shoot successive images more 
quickly because the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. 
If you own an external flash unit, however, you can use it in Sports mode 
Sports mode
Figure 2-12: To capture moving subjects without blur, 
try Sports mode.

60
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
if you like; just be aware that you may sacrifice in the speed-shooting 
department because of the necessary flash-recycle time. Additionally, 
you are limited to a maximum shutter speed of 1/200 second, which may 
not be fast enough to freeze a fast-moving subject. Chapter 5 has tips on 
this subject.
 
Sometimes, allowing a moving object to blur can actually create a heightened 
sense of motion — an artistic choice that you can’t make in Sports mode. For 
more control over shutter speed, try out S mode (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure), explained in Chapter 5.
Close Up mode
 
 Switching to Close Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance 
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought, 
so check your lens manual for details.
Close Up mode does affect your pictures in a couple of ways, however:
 
✓ Depth of field: Close Up mode, like Portrait mode, selects an aperture 
setting designed to produce short depth of field, which helps keep back-
ground objects from competing for attention with your main subject. 
As with Portrait mode, though, how much the background blurs varies 
depending on the available light (which determines the aperture setting 
the camera can use), the distance between your subject and the back-
ground, as well as the lens focal length, all outlined in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default settings, the camera uses the Single Point 
AF-Area mode, meaning that it looks to only a single focus point to estab-
lish focus. Initially, the center point is selected, but you can press the 
Multi Selector to choose a different point. Or you can follow the instruc-
tions in Chapter 6 to choose an entirely different AF-Area mode option.
 
 As for the Focus mode, also covered in Chapter 6, the camera uses the 
AF-A setting. Again, that means that focus is locked when you press 
the shutter button halfway. But if the camera detects motion, it adjusts 
focus as needed, up to the time you take the picture. Your only other 
alternative is to use manual focusing.
 
✓ Flash: You can set the Flash mode to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction, 
and Off. (I urge you, though, to be very careful about using the built-in 
flash when you’re shooting a person or animal at close range — that 
strong burst of light isn’t healthy for the eyes.)
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Night Portrait mode
 
 This mode is designed to deliver a better-looking flash portrait at night (or in 
any dimly lit environment). It does so by constraining you to using Auto Slow 
Sync, Auto Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, or Off flash modes. In the first 
two flash modes, the camera selects a shutter speed that results in a long expo-
sure time. That slow shutter speed enables the camera to rely more on ambi-
ent light and less on the flash to expose the picture, which produces softer, 
more even lighting. If you disable flash, an even slower shutter speed is used.
 
I cover the issue of long-exposure and slow-sync flash photography in detail 
in Chapter 5. For now, the critical thing to know is that the slower shutter 
speed means that you probably need a tripod. If you try to handhold the 
camera, you run the risk of moving the camera during the long exposure, 
resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the vibration reduction (VR) feature of 
your lens, if available, can help, but for nighttime shooting, even that may not 
permit successful handheld shooting. Your subjects also must stay perfectly 
still during the exposure, which can add to the challenge.
Autofocusing in this mode works the same way as in Auto mode, described 
earlier in this chapter.
Changing the (Shutter Button) Release Mode
 
In addition to all its other mode settings — exposure modes, focus modes, 
flash modes, and the like — your D3000 offers a generically named but criti-
cal setting called Release mode. This setting determines how you trigger the 
actual image capture and what happens after you take that step. You have 
the following options:
 
 
✓ Single Frame: This setting, which is the default, records a single image 
each time you press the shutter button completely. In other words, this 
is normal-photography mode.
 
 
✓ Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this mode records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button. In 
this mode, you can capture up to three frames per second. When using 
this mode, you must disable the built-in flash.
 
 The Continuous mode is designed to make it easier for you to capture 
action. But keep in mind that the actual number of frames you can 
record per second depends in part on your shutter speed. At a slow 
shutter speed, the camera may not be able to reach the maximum frame 
rate. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation of shutter speed.)

62
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
10s 
✓ Self-Timer: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select this mode, press 
the shutter button, and run into the frame. As soon as you press the 
shutter button, the AF-assist illuminator on the front of the camera 
starts to blink, and the camera emits a series of beeps (assuming that 
you didn’t disable its voice, a setting I cover in Chapter 1). A few sec-
onds later, the camera captures the image.
 
 At the default settings, the capture-delay time is 10 seconds. But you 
can adjust the delay time by visiting the Setup menu. After you pull up 
the menu, highlight Self-Timer Delay, as shown on the left in Figure 2-13, 
and press OK to view the second screen in the figure. You can select a 
capture-delay time of 2, 5, 10, or 20 seconds. Highlight the self-timer set-
ting you want to change and press OK to wrap things up. The current 
setting is shown with the self-timer symbol in the menu.
 
 Whatever the settings you choose, remember this little quirk about the 
Self-Timer mode: After you capture the self-timer image, the camera 
reverts to whatever Release mode you previously used.
2s
 
 
✓ Delayed Remote and Quick Response Remote: The final two Release 
mode settings relate to the optional Nikon wireless remote-control unit. 
If you select Delayed Remote, the camera snaps the picture two seconds 
after you press the shutter-release button on the remote unit. If you 
select Quick Response Remote, the image is captured immediately.
 
 When you use Self-Timer or the remote control modes, you should 
remove the little rubber cup that surrounds the viewfinder and then 
insert the viewfinder cover that shipped with your camera. (Dig around 
in the accessories box — the cover is a tiny black piece of plastic, about 
the size of the viewfinder.) Otherwise, light may seep into the camera 
through the viewfinder and affect exposure. You can also simply use the 
camera strap or something else to cover the viewfinder in a pinch.
Figure 2-13: You can adjust the self-timer capture delay via the Setup menu.

63
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
You can set the Release mode in the following ways:
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings display: After bringing up the Quick Settings display — 
two presses of the Zoom In button is your fastest option — navigate to 
the Release mode icon, highlighted in Figure 2-14. Then press OK, high-
light the desired mode from the menu shown on the right side of Figure 
2-14, and press OK.
 
✓ Shooting menu: As another alternative, you can adjust the Release 
mode via the Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 2-15. This option is a 
good way to go if you can’t remember what all the little Release mode 
icons mean — on the menu, the name of the mode appears with the 
symbol.
Figure 2-14: You can adjust the Release mode by using the Quick Settings display.

mode along with the little mode icons.

Fn
 
✓ Function button (Self-Timer setting only): If you want to use Self-Timer 
mode, you have an even easier option: Just press the Fn button on the 
left side of the camera. The Shooting Info screen displays a text label 
telling you that you’re in Self-Timer mode, and you’re ready to take your 
picture. Again, though, the camera reverts to the previously selected 
Release mode after you capture your self-timer shot. If you don’t use the 
Self-Timer Release mode frequently, you can customize the function of 
the Fn button as outlined in Chapter 11. You can, for example, set the 
button so that you can select any Release mode by holding the button 
and rotating the Command dial.
 
With the exception of the Self-Timer setting, your selected Release mode 
stays in force until you change it. However, the camera cancels out of the 
remote control modes if it doesn’t receive a signal from the remote after 
about five minutes. You can adjust this timing through the Remote On 
Duration option on the Setup menu. The maximum delay time is 15 minutes; 
keep in mind that a shorter delay time saves battery life. After the delay time 
expires, the camera resets itself to either Single or Continuous mode, depend-
ing on which mode you last used.

A
lmost every review of the D3000 contains glowing reports 
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve 
no doubt discovered for yourself, those claims are true, 
too: This baby can create large, beautiful images.
What you may not have discovered is that Nikon’s 
default Image Quality setting isn’t the highest that 
the D3000 offers. Why, you ask, would Nikon do 
such a thing? Why not set up the camera to pro-
duce the best images right out of the box? The 
answer is that using the top setting has some 
downsides. Nikon’s default choice represents a 
compromise between avoiding those disadvantages 
while still producing images that will please most pho-
tographers.
Whether that compromise is right for you, however, depends 
on your photographic needs. To help you decide, this chapter 
explains the Image Quality setting, along with the Image Size setting, 
which is also critical to the quality of images that you print. Just in case 
you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first sec-
tion of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
A word of warning before you dive in: This stuff may be a little confusing at 
first. In fact, unless you’ve worked with image editing applications, or delved 
into the wild world of document size versus resolution, I pretty much guaran-
tee it. Some math is even involved, which is usually against my principles. On 
top of that, discussions of picture quality and size involve lots of technical 
terms, such as pixels, resolution, JPEG compression, and the like.
So take it slowly, and if your eyes start to glaze over, put the book down, and 
come back later for another go-round. It may require a few reads of this chap-
ter, but before long, you’ll feel confident about controlling these important 
aspects of your pictures.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.

67
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only one is affected 
by the Image Quality setting on your D3000. So if you aren’t happy with your 
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly 
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies: 
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored 
tiles used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved 
and diagonal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolu-
tion, which you do via the Image Size control. See the next section, 
“Considering Resolution (Image Size),” for details.
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that 
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the 
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as 
JPEG artifacts. This is the defect related to the Image Quality setting; see 
“Understanding the Image Quality Options,” later in this chapter, to find 
out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise can occur with very long expo-
sure times or when you choose a high ISO Sensitivity setting on your 
camera. You can explore both issues in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White 
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. 
Note, though, that you can control white balance only when you shoot 
in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M).
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of 
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the 
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,” 
later in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor cleaning. 
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in 
ViewNX or some other photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. 
Some defects, especially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appear-
ance until you see them at a magnified view. (See Part III for information 
about using ViewNX.)
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your D3000 is 
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the 
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you 
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Considering Resolution (Image Size)
Like other digital devices, your D3000 creates pictures out of pixels, which 
is short for picture elements. You can see some pixels close up in the right 
example of Figure 3-2, which shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area 
in the left image.
Figure 3-2: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
You specify the pixel count of your images, also known as the resolution, via 
the Image Size control. The D3000 offers three Image Size settings: Large, 
Medium, and Small; Table 3-1 lists the resulting resolution values for each 
setting.
Table 3-1 
Image Size (Resolution) Options
Setting
Resolution
Large
3872 x 2592 (10.0 MP)
Medium
2896 x 1944 (5.6 MP)
Small
1936 x 1296 (2.5 MP)

69
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the 
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the 
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the approxi-
mate total resolution, which you get by multiplying the horizontal and verti-
cal pixel counts. This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbreviated MP 
for short. One megapixel equals 1 million pixels. 
 
Note, however, that if you select RAW (NEF) as your file format, all images 
are captured at the Large setting. You can vary the resolution only if you 
select JPEG as the file format. The upcoming section “Understanding the 
Image Quality Options” explains file formats. 
So how many pixels are enough? To make the call, you need to understand 
how resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sec-
tions explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
If you’re already schooled on the subject and just want to know how to select 
a resolution setting on your D3000, skip to “Setting Image Size and Quality,” 
near the end of this chapter, for specifics.
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-2.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-x-10-inch print 
at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 vertical 
pixels (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of your print).
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at 
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And 
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer 
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per 
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce 1 pixel.)

Even though many photo editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does 
determine is the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography, 
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need 
way fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For 
example, Figure 3-3 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail 
message.
 
For e-mail images, I recommend a maximum of 640 pixels for the picture’s 
longest dimension. If your image is much larger, the recipient may not be 
able to view the entire picture without scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use the smallest Image Size setting on your D3000, you’ll 
have more than enough pixels for onscreen use, whether you display the pic-
ture on a computer monitor, digital projector, or television set — even one 
of the new, supersized high-definition TVs. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue 
and also shows you how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.

71
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Figure 3-3: The low resolution of this image (450 x 300 pixels) ensures that it can be viewed 
without scrolling when shared via e-mail.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.

72
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But 
note that the Image Quality setting also affects file size. See the upcoming 
section “Understanding the Image Quality Options” for more on that topic. 
The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures fit on my memory card?” pro-
vides additional thoughts about the whole file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the fol-
lowing recommendations about the Image Size setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday images, Medium is a good choice. I find the Large setting 
to be overkill for most casual shooting, which means that you’re creat-
ing huge files for no good reason. Keep in mind that even at the Medium 
setting, your pixel count (2896 x 1944) is about what you need to pro-
duce an 8-x-10-inch print at 200 ppi.
 
✓ Choose Large for an image that you plan to crop, print very large, or 
both. The benefit of maxing out resolution is that you have the flexibility 
to crop your photo and still generate a decent-sized print of the remain-
ing image. Figures 3-4 and 3-5 offer an example. When I was shooting this 
photo, I couldn’t get any closer to the bee — okay, didn’t want to get 

73
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
closer to the bee — than the first picture shows. But because I had the 
resolution cranked up to Large, I was able to later crop the shot to the 
composition you see in Figure 3-5 and still produce a great print. In fact, I 
could have printed the cropped image at a much larger size than fits here.
 
✓ Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting 
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that 
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you 
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Also see Chapter 
7 for other tips on action photography.
After you decide which resolution setting is right for your picture, visit the 
section “Setting Image Size and Quality,” later in this chapter.

the Large resolution setting.

Understanding the Image Quality Options
If I had my druthers, the Image Quality option on the D3000 would instead be 
called File Type, because that’s what the setting controls.
Here’s the deal: The file type, more commonly known as a file format, deter-
mines how your picture data is recorded and stored. Your choice does 
impact picture quality, but so do other factors, as outlined at the beginning 
of this chapter. In addition, your choice of file type has ramifications beyond 
picture quality.
At any rate, your D3000 offers the two file types common on most of today’s 
digital cameras: JPEG and Camera RAW, or just RAW for short, which goes 
by the specific moniker NEF on Nikon cameras. The next sections explain the 
pros and cons of each format. If your mind is already made up, skip ahead to 
“Setting Image Size and Quality,” near the end of this chapter, to find out how 
to make your selection.

75
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format Memory Card option on the Setup 
menu. That option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for 
details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your D3000, as it is 
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 
✓ Immediate usability: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display 
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot 
them. The same can’t be said for NEF (RAW) files, which must be pro-
cessed and converted to JPEG files before you can share them online. 
And although you can view and print RAW files in Nikon ViewNX without 
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new 
camera owners — and it’s an important one 
because you don’t want to run out of space on 
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the Image Size and Image 
Quality discussions in this chapter, image res-
olution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG or 
RAW) together help determine the size of the 
picture file which, in turn, determines how many 
photos fit in a given amount of camera memory. 
(The actual file size of any image also depends 
on a few other factors, including the level of 
detail and color in the subject.)
On the D3000, file sizes range anywhere from 
9.8MB (megabytes) to 0.4MB, depending on the 
combination of Image Size and Image Quality 
settings you select. That means the capacity 
of a 4GB (gigabyte) memory card ranges from 
about 227 pictures to a whopping 6900 pictures, 
again, depending on your Size/Quality settings. 
The table here shows the approximate file sizes 
for all the various Size/Quality combinations on 
your D3000.

converting them, many third-party photo programs don’t enable you to 
do that. You can read more about the conversion process in the upcom-
ing section “NEF (RAW): The purist’s choice.”
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are smaller than NEF (RAW) files. And smaller files 
consume less room on your camera memory card and in your comput-
er’s storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG artifacts example in Figure 3-1.
Fortunately, your camera enables you to specify how much compression 
you’re willing to accept. The Image Quality menu offers three JPEG settings, 
which produce the following results: 
 
✓ JPEG Fine: At this setting, the compression ratio is 1:4 — that is, the file 
is four times smaller than it would otherwise be. In plain English, that 
means that very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many 
compression artifacts, if any.
 
✓ JPEG Normal: Switch to Normal, and the compression ratio rises to 1:8. 
The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well.
 
✓ JPEG Basic: Shift to this setting, and the compression ratio jumps to 
1:16. That’s a substantial amount of compression and brings with it a lot 
more risk of artifacting.
Note, though, that even the JPEG Basic setting on your D3000 doesn’t result 
in anywhere near the level of artifacting that you see in my example in Figure 
3-1. Again, that example is exaggerated to help you be able to recognize 
artifacting defects and understand how they differ from other image-quality 
issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print or display size small, you aren’t likely to 
notice a great deal of quality difference between the Fine, Normal, and Basic 
compression levels, although details in the Fine version may appear slightly 
crisper than the Normal and Basic options. It’s only when you greatly enlarge 
a photo that the differences become apparent.
Take a look at Figures 3-6 and 3-7, for example. I captured the scene in Figure 
3-6 four times, keeping the resolution the same for each shot but varying the 
Image Quality setting. For the photo you see in Figure 3-6, I used the JPEG 

77
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Fine setting. I thought about printing the 
three other shots along with the JPEG 
Fine example, but frankly, you wouldn’t 
be able to detect a nickel’s worth of dif-
ference between the examples at the 
size that I could print them on this page. 
So Figure 3-7 shows just a portion of 
each shot at a greatly enlarged size. The 
first three images show the JPEG Fine, 
Normal, and Basic shots; for the fourth 
image, I used the NEF (RAW) setting, 
which applies no compression. (Note 
that during the process of converting the 
RAW image to a print-ready file, I tried to 
use settings that kept the RAW image as 
close as possible to its JPEG cousins in 
all aspects but quality. But any variations 
in exposure, color, and contrast are a 
result of the conversion process, not of 
the format per se.)
Even at the greatly magnified size, it 
takes a sharp eye to detect the quality 
differences between the Raw, Fine, and 
Normal images. But jump to the Basic 
example, and compression artifacting 
becomes obvious.
 
Nikon chose to use the Normal setting as the default on the D3000. I suppose 
that’s okay for everyday images that you don’t plan to print or display very 
large. And because file size shrinks as you apply more compression, Normal 
enables you to fit more photos on your memory card than Fine or NEF 
(RAW).
For my money, though, the file-size benefit you gain when going from Fine 
to Normal isn’t worth even a little quality loss, especially with the price of 
camera memory cards getting lower every day. You never know when a 
casual snapshot is going to turn out to be so great that you want to print or 
display it large enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And 
of all the defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of 
the hardest to remove. So if I shoot in the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
Figure 3-6: This subject offered a good 
test for comparing the Image Quality 
settings.

Figure 3-7: Here you see a portion of the tower at greatly enlarged views.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, carefully inspect the results in 
your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level of artifact-
ing you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when you view 
images onscreen. It’s difficult to reproduce artifacting here in print because 
the print process obscures some of the tiny defects caused by compression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change 
the file type to NEF (RAW). Or consider your other option, which is to record 
two versions of each file, one RAW and one JPEG. The next section offers 
details.
 
Whichever format you select, be aware of one more important rule for pre-
serving the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your photo soft-
ware, don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time you alter 

79
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
and save an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of lossy com-
pression. And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you can eventu-
ally get to the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG example in 
Figure 3-1, at the start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the file 
does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a nondestructive format. TIFF, pro-
nounced tiff, is a good choice and is a file-saving option available in most 
photo editing programs. Should you want to share the edited image online, 
create a JPEG copy of the TIFF file when you’re finished making all your 
changes. That way, you always retain one copy of the photo at the original 
quality captured by the camera. You can read more about TIFF in Chapter 8, 
in the section related to processing RAW images. Chapter 9 explains how to 
create a JPEG copy of a photo for online sharing.
NEF (RAW): The purist’s choice
The other picture file type you can create on your D3000 is called Camera 
RAW, or just RAW (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of RAW. Nikon’s is called NEF, so you 
see the three-letter extension NEF at the end of RAW filenames.
Examining the pros and cons of RAW
RAW is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for these 
reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks 
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as 
needed to produce the results that Nikon believes its customers prefer. 
With RAW, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image 
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and 
uses special software known as a RAW converter to produce the actual 
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point. 
The upshot is that “shooting RAW” enables you, and not the camera, to 
have the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Higher bit depth: Bit depth is a measure of how many distinct color 
values an image file can contain. JPEG files restrict you to 8 bits each for 
the red, blue, and green color components, or channels, that make up a 
digital image, for a total of 24 bits. That translates to roughly 16.7 million 
possible colors. On the D3000, a RAW file delivers a higher bit count, 
collecting 12 bits per channel.

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 Although jumping from 8 to 12 bits sounds like a huge difference, you 
may not really ever notice any difference in your photos — that 8-bit 
palette of 16.7 million values is more than enough for superb images. 
Where having the extra bits can come in handy is if you really need to 
adjust exposure, contrast, or color after the shot in your photo editing 
program. In cases where you apply extreme adjustments, having the 
extra original bits sometimes helps avoid a problem known as banding 
or posterization, which creates abrupt color breaks where you should 
see smooth, seamless transitions. (A higher bit depth doesn’t always 
prevent the problem, however, so don’t expect miracles.)
 
✓ Best picture quality: Because RAW doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting 
that can occur with JPEG. 
But of course, as with most things in life, RAW isn’t without its disadvan-
tages. To wit:
 
✓ You can’t do much with your pictures until you process them in a 
RAW converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or put them 
into a text document or multimedia presentation. You can print them 
immediately if you use Nikon ViewNX, but most other photo programs 
require you to convert the RAW files to a standard format first. So when 
you shoot RAW, you add to the time you must spend in front of the com-
puter instead of behind the camera lens.
 
✓ To get the full benefit of RAW, you need software other than Nikon 
ViewNX. The ViewNX software that ships free with your camera does 
have a command that enables you to convert RAW files to JPEG or to 
TIFF, introduced in the preceding section. However, this free tool gives 
you limited control over how your original data is translated in terms of 
color, exposure, and other characteristics — which defeats one of the 
primary purposes of shooting RAW.
 
 Nikon Capture NX 2 offers a sophisticated RAW converter, but it costs 
about $180. (Sadly, if you already own Capture NX, you need to upgrade 
to version 2 to open the RAW files from your D3000.) If you own Adobe 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, however, you’re set; both include 
the converter that most people consider one of the best in the industry. 
Watch the sale ads, and you can pick up Elements for well under $100. 
You may need to download an update from the Adobe Web site (www.
adobe.com) to get the converter to work with your D3000 files.
 
 Of course, the D3000 also offers an in-camera RAW converter, found on 
the Retouch menu. But although it’s convenient, this tool isn’t the easi-
est to use because you must rely on the small camera monitor when 
making judgments about color, exposure, sharpness, and so on. The in-
camera tool also doesn’t offer the complete cadre of features available 
in Capture NX 2 and other converter software utilities.

81
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
 Chapter 8 offers more information on the in-camera conversion process 
and also offers a look at the converter found in ViewNX. 
 
✓ RAW files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that 
RAW applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is a larger 
file. In addition, Nikon RAW files are always captured at the maximum 
resolution available on the camera, even if you don’t really need all 
those pixels. For both reasons, RAW files are significantly larger than 
JPEGs, so they take up more room on your memory card and on your 
computer’s hard drive or other picture-storage device. 
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you 
make up your mind, refer to Figure 3-7 and compare the JPEG Fine example 
with its NEF (RAW) counterpart. You may be able to detect some subtle 
quality differences when you really study the two, but a casual viewer likely 
would not, especially if shown the entire example images at normal print 
sizes rather than the greatly magnified views shown in the figure. I took 
Figure 3-6, for example, using JPEG Fine.
 
That said, I do shoot in the RAW format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable RAW converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which 
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your 
photo editor later. And the extra bits in a RAW file offer an additional safety 
net because I usually can push the exposure adjustments a little further in my 
photo editor if necessary without introducing banding.
I also go RAW if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep 
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t 
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of RAW images. 
Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered by imper-
fections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if you will.)
Exploring your RAW shooting options
If you do decide to try RAW shooting, you can select from two options on 
your D3000’s Image Quality menu: 
 
✓ NEF (RAW): This setting produces a single RAW file. Again, you don’t 
have a choice of Image Size settings; the camera always captures the file 
at the maximum resolution.
 
✓ NEF (RAW)+JPEG Basic: You also can choose to capture the image as 
both a NEF file and a JPEG file. The JPEG is recorded at the Basic qual-
ity setting, and both files are captured at the Large resolution setting. 
Of course, with two files, you consume more space on your camera 
memory card.

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
I often choose the RAW+JPEG Basic option when I’m shooting pictures I want 
to share right away with people who don’t have software for viewing RAW 
files. I upload the JPEGs to a photo-sharing site where everyone can view 
them, and then I process the RAW versions of my favorite images for my own 
use when I have time. Having the JPEG version also enables you to display 
your photos on a DVD player or TV that has a slot for an SD memory card — 
most can’t display RAW files but can handle JPEGs. Ditto for portable media 
players and digital photo frames. 
If you choose to create both files, note a couple of things:
 
✓ When you view your pictures on the camera, you see only one photo, 
and the Image Quality data reflects your capture setting (Raw+Basic). 
See Chapter 4 to find out how to view picture data.
 
✓ If you delete the displayed image, you delete both the JPEG and RAW 
files. (After you transfer the two files to your computer, deleting one 
doesn’t affect the other.) Chapter 4 also explains how to delete files.
 
✓ Remember that the JPEG version is captured at the camera’s maximum 
resolution, so if you do want to share your photos online right away, be 
sure that your photo sharing site doesn’t have any restrictions about 
the size of pictures you can upload. If necessary, you can reduce the 
pixel count before uploading your photos by following the steps laid out 
in Chapter 9. If you want to share the pictures via e-mail, downsizing the 
photos is a must; again, Chapter 9 explains more about this issue.
My take: Choose JPEG Fine or NEF (RAW)
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you. 
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of 
JPEG versus RAW, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the RAW conversion, shoot RAW. See Chapter 8 for more 
information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you don’t mind the added file-storage space requirement and want the 
flexibility of both formats, choose RAW+JPEG Basic. 
 
✓ If you go with JPEG only, stay away from JPEG Normal and Basic. The 
tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my opinion, worth the risk of compres-
sion artifacts. As with my recommendations on image size, this fits the 

83
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
“better safe than sorry” formula: You never know when you may capture a 
spectacular, enlargement-worthy subject, and it would be a shame to have 
the photo spoiled by compression defects. If you select RAW+JPEG Basic, 
of course, this isn’t as much of an issue because you always have the RAW 
version as backup if you aren’t happy with the JPEG Basic quality. 
Setting Image Size and Quality
 
To sum up this chapter:
 
✓ The Image Size and Image Quality options both affect the quality of your 
pictures and also play a large role in image file size.
 
✓ Choose a high Image Quality setting (NEF or JPEG Fine) and the maxi-
mum Image Size setting (Large), and you get top-quality pictures and 
large file sizes.
 
✓ Combining the lowest Quality setting (JPEG Basic) with the lowest Size 
setting (Small) greatly shrinks files, enabling you to fit lots more pictures 
on your memory card, but it also increases the chances that you’ll be 
disappointed with the quality of those pictures, especially if you make 
large prints.
As for actually selecting the options you want to use, you have two choices:
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings display: Press the Zoom In button twice — once to bring 
up the Shooting Info display and then again to shift to the Quick Settings 
screen. (Or press the Info button to bring up the Shooting Info screen 
and press the Zoom In button to toggle to the Quick Settings display.)
 
 Then use the Multi Selector to highlight the Image Quality icon in the 
top-right corner, as shown on the left in Figure 3-8. Press OK to view the 
second screen in the figure, where you can select the option you want 
to use. When you select one of the settings, the screen shows you the 
resulting file size (in megabytes) and the number of pictures that will 
fit on your memory card at that size. Highlight your choice and then 
press OK. Repeat the process to set the Image Size option, which is right 
below the Image Quality setting on the Quick Settings screen.
 
✓ Shooting menu: As an alternative, you can adjust the settings via the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 3-9. Note: If you are using the guided 
menus instead of the regular menus, you access the Size and Quality 
options through the Set Up category, not the Shoot section. See Chapter 
1 for more information about the guided menus, including the reasons 
why I suggest you stick with the regular menus.

Figure 3-8: You can use the Quick Settings screen to change the Image Size and Quality settings.
Figure 3-9: You also can set Image Size and Image Quality via the Shooting menu.
However you adjust the Size and Quality options, remember that when 
you choose the RAW (NEF) or RAW + JPEG Basic format, you don’t need to 
worry about the Image Size setting. For these formats, all pictures are auto-
matically captured at the Large resolution, and you can’t choose a lower 
resolution setting. 
 
Also remember that adjusting the Image Size or Image Quality setting 
changes the picture file size, which changes the number of new shots you can 
fit on the current memory card. If you adjust the options through the Quick 
Settings screen, the Shots Remaining value appears in the area highlighted in 
Figure 3-8. The same value also shows up in the Shots Remaining area of the 
Shooting Info screen and viewfinder.

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo 
defects — compression artifacts, pixelation, 
and the like — is the impact of plain-old dust 
and dirt on picture quality. But no matter what 
camera settings you use, you aren’t going to 
achieve great picture quality with a dirty lens. 
So make it a practice to clean your lens on a 
regular basis, using one of the specialized 
cloths and cleaning solutions made expressly 
for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last 
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty 
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera 
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will.
Your D3000 offers an automated, internal sensor-
cleaning mechanism. By default, this auto-
matic cleaning happens every time you turn the 
camera on or off. You also can request a cleaning 
session at any time via the Clean Image Sensor 
command on the Setup menu. (Chapter 1 has 
details on this menu option.)
But if you frequently change lenses in a dirty 
environment, the internal cleaning mechanism 
may not be adequate, in which case a manual 
sensor cleaning is necessary. You can do this 
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image 
sensors are pretty delicate beings, and you 
can easily damage them or other parts of your 
camera if you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local 
camera store that offers this service. In my area 
(central Indiana), sensor cleaning costs from 
$30–$50. 
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean 
never — try to clean any part of your camera 
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can 
not only damage the interior of your camera, 
blowing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be 
removed, but also crack the external monitor.

ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photography is being 
able to view my pictures on the camera monitor the instant after I 
shoot them. No more guessing whether I captured the image I wanted or I 
need to try again; no more wasting money on developing and printing pic-
tures that stink. In fact, this feature alone was reason enough for me to turn 
my back forever on my closetful of film photography hardware and all the 
unexposed film remaining from my predigital days.
But seeing your pictures is just the start of the things you 
can do when you switch your D3000 to playback mode. 
You also can review all the camera settings you used 
to take the picture, display graphics that alert you 
to serious exposure problems, and add file markers 
that protect the picture from accidental erasure. 
This chapter tells you how to use all these play-
back features and more.
After you explore these playback functions, be sure 
to also visit Chapter 9, which covers some additional 
ways to view your images, including how to create 
slide shows and display your photos on a television 
screen.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Setting Playback Timing Preferences
You can control many aspects of how your pictures appear on the camera 
monitor. Later sections of this chapter explain how to adjust the display 
after you shift to playback mode. But first, the next few sections talk about 
a couple of basic options that determine when your pictures appear and the 
length of time they remain onscreen.
Adjusting playback timing
By default, the camera monitor turns off after 12 seconds of inactivity during 
picture playback to save battery power. So if you’re looking at a picture or 
passing around your camera so other people can see the image, the monitor 
goes dark if you don’t either advance to the next picture or use one of the 
other playback functions discussed in this chapter within 12 seconds. 
 
If you want a longer or shorter interval before the playback cutoff, take these 
steps:
 
1. Open the Setup menu.
 
2. Scroll down the menu to reach the Auto Off Timers option, as shown 
on the left in Figure 4-1.
 
3. Press OK.
 
 You see the second screen in Figure 4-1.
 
4. Select Custom and press OK to display the screen shown on the left in 
Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-1: You can control how long pictures are displayed. 

89
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
Figure 4-2: Use the Custom option to adjust the playback and menu display shutoff timing only. 
 
5. Select Playback/Menus and press OK to display the timing options, 
shown on the right in Figure 4-2.
 
 You can select from intervals ranging from eight seconds to 10 minutes.
 
6. Choose the option you want to use and press OK.
 
 Now you see the screen shown in 
Figure 4-3.
 
7. Highlight Done, as shown in 
Figure 4-3, and press OK to wrap 
things up.
 
 Any time you see a menu screen 
that has a Done option, it’s 
important to take the step of 
highlighting that option and 
pressing OK. Otherwise your set-
tings aren’t preserved. I add this 
reminder because I forget to take 
this step on a regular basis!
As another option, you can choose the Long, Normal, or Short setting instead 
of Custom in Step 4. However, going that route also affects how long the 
camera displays a picture immediately after you capture the image — known 
as the image review period — as well as the automatic shutoff timing of the 
exposure meters. I prefer to set these options separately, as described in 
the steps, but in case you’re interested, here are the shutdown intervals pro-
duced by the Short, Normal, and Long settings:
Figure 4-3: To save your changes, highlight 
Done and then press OK.

✓ Short: Playback and menus, 8 seconds; image review and meters, 4

✓ Long: Playback and menus, 20 seconds; image review, 20 seconds;

Adjusting and disabling instant review
After you take a picture, it automati-
cally appears briefly on the camera 
monitor. By default, this instant-
review period lasts four seconds. But 
you can customize this behavior in 
two ways:
 
✓ Adjust the length of the instant-
review period. Take the same 
steps as outlined in the preced-
ing section, but choose Image 
Review instead of Playback/
Menus in Step 5, as shown in 
Figure 4-4. Press OK to display 
the timing intervals; you can 
choose from shutdown timing 
intervals ranging from four 
seconds to 10 minutes.
 
✓ Disable instant review. Because 
any monitor use is a strain on 
battery power, consider turning 
off instant review altogether if 
your battery is running low. To 
turn off the feature, first display 
the Playback menu. Then high-
light Image Review, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. Press OK, highlight 
Off, and press OK once more. 
You can still view your pictures 
by pressing the Playback button 
at any time.
Figure 4-4: You also can adjust the length of 
the instant-review period through the Auto 
Off Timers option.

 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
Enabling Automatic Picture Rotation
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — 
whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file.
During playback, the camera can read the data and automatically rotate 
the image so that it appears in the upright position, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-6. The image is also automatically rotated when you view it in Nikon 
ViewNX, Capture NX 2, and some other photo programs that can interpret 
the data.
Figure 4-6: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
sideways (right).
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.
The feature that embeds the rotation data in the file is turned on by default, 
but the one that rotates the picture during playback is turned off.
To adjust the status of automatic rotation, you need to visit two menus:
 
1. On the Setup menu, select Auto Image Rotation, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 4-7.
 
 You need to scroll to the second screen of the menu to get to the Auto 
Image Rotation option. If you select On, the rotation data is added to the 
picture file. Select Off to leave the data out.

92
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-7: Visit the Setup and Playback menus to enable image rotation.
 
2. Display the Playback menu and select the Rotate Tall option, as shown 
on the right in Figure 4-7.
 
 Select On if you want the camera to read the orientation data and rotate 
vertical pictures. Select Off if you prefer not to rotate the photos during 
playback. The images are still rotated automatically in photo programs 
that can read the orientation data in the file. Note that even if you select 
On, images aren’t rotated for the instant-review display, explained in the 
preceding section.
 
Shooting with the lens pointing directly up or down sometimes confuses the 
camera, causing it to record the wrong data in the file. If that issue bothers 
you, turn off Auto Image Rotation on the Setup menu before you shoot the 
pictures. The camera then won’t record the orientation information as part of 
the picture file.
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To take a look at the pictures on your camera memory card, take these steps:
 
1. If you created custom image folders, specify which ones you want to 
view. Otherwise, skip to Step 2.
 
 Your D3000 normally organizes pictures automatically into folders that 
are assigned generic names: 100D3000, 101D3000, and so on. You can see 
the name of the current folder by looking at the Active Folder option, 
found on the last screen of the Setup menu. (The default folder name 
appears as just D3000 on the menu.)

93
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
 
 You also can create custom folders through that same menu option. 
(See Chapter 11 for specifics.) If you do, you need to tell the camera 
whether you want to view only pictures in the current folder or in all 
folders. To do so, display the Playback menu and highlight Playback 
Folder, as shown on the left in Figure 4-8. Press OK to display the screen 
shown on the right in the figure. Select All to view all folders; select 
Current to view only the active folder. Press OK to exit the screen.
Figure 4-8: If you create custom folders, specify which folder you want to view.
 
 Again, this step applies only if you create custom folders. If you let the 
camera handle all folder-creation duties, you can view all pictures on the 
card regardless of the Playback Folder setting.
 
 
2. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-9.
 
 The monitor displays the last picture you took, along with some picture 
data, such as the frame number of the photo. To find out how to inter-
pret the picture information and specify what data you want to see, see 
the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” 
 
3. To scroll through your pictures, rotate the Command dial or press the 
Multi Selector right or left.
 
 I highlighted the dial and Multi Selector in Figure 4-9.
 
4. To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway 
and then release it.
 
 Or just press the Playback button again.
 
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-9. You can also display multiple images at a 
time, as explained next.

Viewing multiple images at a time
 
? Along with viewing images one at a time, you can choose to display 4, 9, or 72 
thumbnails, as shown in Figure 4-10. Just press the button shown in the 
margin here and labeled Zoom Out/Thumbnail display in Figure 4-9. Press 
once to cycle from single-picture view to 4-thumbnail view, press again to 
shift to 9-picture view, and press once more to bring up those itty-bitty 
thumbnails featured in 72-image view. Press yet again, and you shift to 
Calendar view, a nifty feature explained in the next section.
 
i  To reduce the number of thumbnails, press the Zoom In button, shown cling-
ing to the margin here and labeled in Figure 4-9. Or to jump immediately to 
single-frame view without having to cycle back through all the display modes, 
just press the OK button.

Selected image
Figure 4-10: You can view 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails at once.
In any of the thumbnail display modes, use these techniques to navigate your 
photo collection:
 
✓ Scroll through your pictures. Rotate the Command dial or press the 
Multi Selector right or left.
 
✓ Select an image. As you scroll through your pictures, a yellow box sur-
rounds the currently selected image. For example, in Figure 4-10, Image 
11 is selected. To select a different image, use the Command dial or 
Multi Selector to scroll the display until the highlight box surrounds the 
image.
 
✓ View the selected image at the full-frame size. Press the OK button. 
 
 After you return to full-frame view, pressing OK displays the Retouch 
menu. Now you can select a retouch option and apply it to the image. 
See Chapter 10 for a look at some of the picture fixes you can apply to 
your photo from the Retouch menu.

Displaying photos in Calendar view
In Calendar display mode, you see a little calendar on the monitor, as shown 
in Figure 4-11. By selecting a date on the calendar, you can quickly navi-
gate to all pictures you shot on that day. An empty date indicates that your 
memory card doesn’t contain any photos from that day.
The key to navigating Calendar view is the Zoom Out button:
 
? 
1. Press the Zoom Out button as needed to cycle through the thumbnail 
display modes until you reach Calendar view.
 
 If you’re currently viewing images in full-frame view, for example, you 
need to press the button four times to get to Calendar view.
 
2. Using the Multi Selector or Command dial, move the yellow highlight 
box over a date that contains an image.
 
 In Figure 4-11, for example, the 
31st day of August is selected. 
(The number of the month 
appears in the top-left corner of 
the screen.) After you select a 
date, the right side of the monitor 
displays a vertical strip of thumb-
nails of pictures taken on that 
date.
 
3. To view all thumbnails from the 
selected date, press the Zoom 
Out button again.
 
 Now the vertical thumbnail strip 
becomes active, and you can 
scroll through the thumbnails 
by pressing the Multi Selector 
up and down, or by rotating the 
Command dial. A second high-
light box appears in the thumb-
nail strip to indicate the currently 
selected image.
 
i  
4. To temporarily display a larger 
view of the selected thumbnail, 
hold down the Zoom In button.
 
 The image filename appears 
under the larger preview, as 
shown in Figure 4-12. When you 
release the button, the large 
preview disappears, and the 
calendar comes back into view.
Figure 4-11: Calendar view makes it easy to 
view all photos shot on a particular day.
Figure 4-12: Press and hold the Zoom In 
button to temporarily view the selected 
image at a larger size.

 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
 
? 
5. To jump back to the calendar and select a different date, press the 
Zoom Out button again.
 
 You can just keep pressing the button to jump between the calendar and 
the thumbnail strip as much as you want.
 
6. To exit Calendar view and return to single-image view, press OK.
 
 If you want to return to Calendar view, you have to press the Zoom Out 
button four times to cycle from full-frame view through the different 
thumbnail display modes.
Zooming in for a closer view
After displaying a photo in single-frame view, you can magnify it so that you 
can get a close-up look at important details, such as whether someone’s eyes 
are closed in a portrait. Here’s the scoop:
 
i  
✓ Zoom in. Press the Zoom In button, shown in the margin here. You can 
magnify the image to a maximum of 13 to 25 times its original display 
size, depending on the resolution (pixel count) of the photo. Just keep 
pressing the button until you reach the magnification you want.
 
 Note the magnifying glass icon on the button face. The plus sign in the 
middle is your reminder that this button enlarges the image. 
 
✓ View another part of the magnified picture. When an image is magni-
fied, a little navigation thumbnail showing the entire image appears 
briefly in the lower-right corner of the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-13. 
The yellow outline in this picture-in-picture image indicates the area 
that’s currently consuming the rest of the monitor space. Use the Multi 
Selector to scroll the yellow box and display a different portion of the 
image. After a few seconds, the 
navigation thumbnail disappears; 
just press the Multi Selector in 
any direction to redisplay it.
 
✓ Inspect faces. When you magnify 
a photo that contains what the 
camera perceives to be faces, 
the picture-in-picture thumbnail 
displays a white border around 
each detected face, as shown in 
Figure 4-14. Hold down the Zoom 
In button and press the Multi 
Selector right or left to toggle the 
display from face to face so that 
you can examine each person at 
a magnified view, as shown on 
the right in the figure.
Magnified area

the yellow outline over the area you want to 
inspect.

Face detection symbol
Figure 4-14: The Face Detection feature enables you to quickly inspect faces.
 
✓ View more images at the same magnification. Here’s another neat trick: 
While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Command dial to dis-
play the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So if you 
shot the same subject several times, you can easily check how the same 
details appear in each one.
 
? 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the Zoom Out 
button. This button also sports the magnifying glass symbol, but this 
time with a minus sign to indicate that it reduces the display size. That 
little grid-like thingy next to the magnifying glass reminds you that the 
button also comes into play when you want to go from full-frame view to 
one of the thumbnail views or Calendar view. 
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the Zoom Out 
button until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the OK 
button, which quickly returns you to the standard, full-frame view.
Viewing Picture Data
In single-image picture view, you can choose from five Photo Information 
modes, each of which presents a different set of shooting data along with 
the image. To cycle between the different modes, press the Multi Selector 
up or down.
 
Note, though, that three of the five modes don’t appear unless they are 
enabled through a menu option. To access them, take these steps:

99
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Display Mode, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-15.
Figure 4-15: You must enable some of the information display modes via the Playback menu.
 
2. Press OK to display the second screen you see in the figure.
 
 A check mark in the box next to a mode means that the mode is enabled. 
By default, all three modes are off, as shown in the figure.
 
3. To toggle a display mode on, highlight it and then press the Multi 
Selector right.
 
 A check mark appears in the box for that mode, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-16.
Figure 4-16: Press the Multi Selector right to toggle the highlighted display option on and off.
 
4. After turning on the options you want to use, highlight Done and 
press OK.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The next sections explain exactly what details you can glean from each dis-
play mode. I present them here in the order they appear if you cycle through 
the modes by pressing the Multi Selector down. You can spin through the 
modes in the other direction by pressing the Multi Selector up.
File Information mode
In this display mode, the monitor displays the data shown in Figure 4-17.
The following bits of info appear at the top of the monitor:
 
✓ Protect Status: A little key icon indicates that you used the camera’s 
file-protection feature to prevent the image from being erased when you 
use the camera’s Delete function. See “Protecting Photos,” later in this 
chapter, to find out more. (Note: Formatting your memory card, a topic 
discussed in Chapter 1, does erase even protected pictures.) This area 
appears empty if you didn’t apply protection.
 
✓ Retouch Indicator: This icon appears if you used any of the Retouch 
menu options to alter the image. For example, I used the Trim command 
to crop the photo shown in Figure 4-17. (I cover this Retouch feature in 
Chapter 10.) Again, no icon means that you didn’t retouch the photo.
 
✓ Frame Number/Total Pictures: The first value here indicates the frame 
number of the currently displayed photo; the second tells you the total 
number of pictures on the memory card. In Figure 4-17, for example, the 
image is number 71 out of 71.
Underneath the image, you can 
view these details:
 
✓ Folder Name: Folders are 
named automatically by 
the camera unless you 
create custom folders, an 
advanced trick you can 
explore in Chapter 11. 
The first camera-created 
folder is named 100D3000. 
Each folder can contain 
up to 9999 images; when 
you exceed that limit, the 
camera creates a new 
folder and assigns the next 
folder number: 101D3000, 
102D3000, and so on.
 
✓ Filename: The camera 
also automatically names 
your files. 
Protect Status

Folder and file name
Figure 4-17: In File Information mode, you can view

 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
 
 Filenames end with a three-letter code that represents the file format, 
which is either JPG (for JPEG) or NEF (for Camera RAW) for still 
photos. Chapter 3 discusses these two formats. If you create a dust-off 
reference image file, an advanced feature designed for use with Nikon 
Capture NX 2, the camera instead uses the extension NDF. (Because 
this software must be purchased separately, I don’t cover it or the 
dust-off function in this book.)
 
 The first three letters of filenames also vary. Here’s what the possible 
three-letter codes indicate:
 
• DSC: This code means normal, plain-old picture file. 
 
• SSC: This trio appears at the beginning of files that you create with 
the Small Picture option on the Retouch menu. Chapter 9 discusses 
this feature.
 
• CSC: This code is used for images that you alter using other Retouch 
menu features. For example, because I used the Trim feature to 
crop the image in Figure 4-17, the filename begins with CSC, and the 
Retouch Indicator appears in the top-left corner of the monitor.
 
• _ (underscore): If you change the Color Space setting on the 
Shooting menu to the Adobe RGB color profile, a topic you can 
investigate in Chapter 6, an underscore character precedes the 
filename. (The exception is for dust-off reference photos, which 
don’t use the underscore.) For photos taken in the default color 
profiles (sRGB), the underscore appears after the three-letter 
code, as in DSC_.
 
 Each image is also assigned a four-digit file number, starting with 0001. 
When you reach image 9999, the file numbering restarts at 0001, and the 
new images go into a new folder to prevent any possibility of overwriting 
the existing image files. For more information about file numbering, see 
the Chapter 1 section that discusses the File Number Sequence option.
 
✓ Date and Time: Just below the folder and filename info, you see the 
date and time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this 
data depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values cor-
rectly, which you do via the Setup menu. Chapter 1 has details.
 
✓ Image Quality: Here you can see which Image Quality setting you used 
when taking the picture. Again, Chapter 3 has details, but the short story 
is this: Fine, Normal, and Basic are the three JPEG recording options, 
with Fine representing the highest JPEG quality. The word RAW indicates 
that the picture was recorded in the Nikon Camera RAW format, NEF.
 
✓ Image Size: This value tells you the image resolution, or pixel count. See 
Chapter 3 to find out about resolution. Note that in Figure 4-17, the little 
scissors symbol indicates that I cropped the original to the current size 
by applying the Trim feature from the Retouch menu.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
RGB Histogram mode
Press the Multi Selector down to shift from File Information mode to this 
mode, which displays your image in the manner shown in Figure 4-18. 
(Remember: You can view your picture in this mode only if you enable it via 
the Display Mode option on the Playback menu. See “Viewing Picture Data,” 
earlier in this chapter, for help.)
Underneath the image thumbnail, 
you see just a few pieces of data. 
As with File Information mode, you 
see the Protect Status and Retouch 
Indicator icons if you used those 
features. Beneath that, you see the 
White Balance settings used for the 
shot. (White balance is a color fea-
ture you can explore in Chapter 6.) 
Along the bottom row of the display, 
you see the camera name along with 
the Frame Number/Total Pictures 
data, also part of the standard File 
Information display data.
The core of this display mode, 
though, are those chart-like 
thingies called histograms. You get 
two types of histograms: The top 
one is a Brightness histogram; the 
three others are collectively called an RGB (red, green, blue) histogram.
 
i  The next two sections explain what you can discern from the histograms. But 
first, here’s a cool trick to remember: If you press the Zoom In button while in 
this display mode, you can zoom the thumbnail to a magnified view. The his-
tograms then update to reflect only the magnified area of the photo. Use the 
Multi Selector to scroll the display to see other areas of the picture. To return 
to the regular view and once again see the whole-image histogram, press OK.
Reading a Brightness histogram
You can get an idea of image exposure by viewing your photo on the camera 
monitor. But if you adjust the brightness of the monitor or the ambient light 
affects the display brightness, you may not get the real story. The Brightness 
histogram provides a way to gauge exposure that’s a little more reliable.
A Brightness histogram indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights, and 
midtones (areas of medium brightness) in your image. Figure 4-19 shows you 
the Brightness histogram for the eagle photo featured throughout this chapter.
Brightness histogram
RGB histogram
Figure 4-18: RGB Histogram mode presents 
exposure and color information in chart-like 
fashion.

103
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
The horizontal axis of the histogram represents the possible picture bright-
ness values — the maximum tonal range, in photography-speak — from the 
darkest shadows on the left to the brightest highlights on the right. And the 
vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at a particular brightness value. 
A spike indicates a heavy concentration of pixels. For example, in Figure 4-19, 
the histogram shows a large supply of pixels clustered in the medium bright-
ness range.
 
Keep in mind that there is no one “perfect” 
histogram that you should try to achieve. 
Instead, interpret the histogram with 
respect to the distribution of shadows, 
highlights, and midtones that comprise 
your subject. You wouldn’t expect to see 
lots of shadows, for example, in a photo of 
a polar bear walking on a snowy landscape. 
Pay attention, however, if you see a very 
high concentration of pixels at the far right 
or left end of the histogram, which can 
indicate a seriously overexposed or under-
exposed image, respectively. To find out 
how to resolve exposure problems, visit 
Chapter 5.
Understanding RGB histograms
When you view your images in RGB 
Histogram display mode, you see two 
histograms: the Brightness histogram, 
covered in the preceding section, and an 
RGB histogram. Figure 4-20 offers a sample 
RGB histogram for your consideration; it 
reflects the eagle photo shown in Figure 
4-18 and elsewhere in this chapter.
To make sense of the RGB histogram, you 
first need to know that digital images are 
called RGB images because they are cre-
ated out of three primary colors of light: 
red, green, and blue. The RGB histogram 
shows you the brightness values for each 
of those primary colors.
By checking the brightness levels of the 
individual color components, sometimes 
referred to as color channels, you can 
assess the picture’s color saturation 
levels. If most of the pixels for one or two 
Shadows

the left to highlights on the right.

Figure 4-20: The RGB histogram can 
indicate problems with color saturation.

104
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
channels are clustered toward the right end of the histogram, colors may be 
oversaturated, which destroys detail. On the flip side, a heavy concentration 
of pixels at the left end of a histogram indicates an image that may be under-
saturated. If all three channels are heavily populated at the right end, your 
image contains a lot of pixels that are pure white — in other words, clipped 
highlights — because maximum red, green, and blue equals white in the word 
of light-based color mixing. If all three are slammed toward the left end, you 
have the opposite problem: Pixels that should be a range of dark shades are 
all black instead. With no red, green, or blue light, you wind up with black.
A savvy RGB histogram reader also can spot color-balance issues by look-
ing at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to 
notice just by looking at the image itself on the camera monitor. And under-
standing how to translate the histogram data for this purpose requires more 
knowledge about RGB color theory than I have room to present in this book.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Highlight display mode
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in 
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include a 
variety of light shades are instead totally white. The result is a loss of detail 
in the highlight areas of the photo.
In Highlight display mode, blown highlights are represented by pixels that 
blink on and off in the camera monitor. Like RGB Histogram mode, Highlight 
mode is provided because simply viewing the image isn’t always a reliable 
way to gauge exposure. To use it, however, you must follow the instructions 
laid out in the earlier section “Viewing Picture Data” to enable the mode.
Along with the blinking highlight 
warning, Highlight display mode 
presents the standard bits of informa-
tion in this mode: the Protect Status, 
Retouch Indicator, and File Number/
Total Pictures values, all explained in 
the earlier section “File Information 
mode.” The label Highlights also 
appears to let you know the current 
display mode, as shown in Figure 4-21.
 
I suggest that you check both the 
Brightness histogram offered in RGB 
Histogram display mode and the 
Figure 4-21: In Highlight mode, blinking areas 
indicate blown highlights.

105
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
Highlight display, though, when you’re concerned about overexposure. If 
an image contains only a small area of blown highlights, the histogram may 
indicate a very small pixel population at the brightest end of the spectrum, 
leading you to assume that you’re okay in the exposure department. But if 
those blown highlights happen to fall in an important part of your image — 
someone’s face, for example — they can wreck your picture.
Shooting Data display mode
 
Before you can access this mode, you must enable it via the Display Mode 
option on the Playback menu. See the earlier section, “Viewing Picture Data,” 
for details. After turning on the option, press the Multi Selector down to shift 
from Highlights mode to Shooting Data mode.
In this mode, you can view three screens of information, which you toggle 
between by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. Figure 4-22 shows you 
the three screens, referred to in the Nikon manual as Shooting Data Page 1, 2, 
and 3.
Figure 4-22: You can view the camera settings used to capture the image in Shooting Data 
display mode.

106
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Most of the data here won’t make any sense to you until you explore 
Chapters 5 and 6, which explain the exposure, color, and other advanced 
settings available on your camera. But I do want to call your attention to a 
couple of factoids now:
 
✓ The top-left corner of the monitor shows the Protect Status and Retouch 
Indicator icons, if you used the protect or retouch features. Otherwise, 
the area is empty. (See the earlier section “File Information Mode” for 
details about these particular features.)
 
✓ The current frame number, followed by the total number of images on 
the memory card, appears in the lower-right corner of the display.
 
✓ The Comment item, which is the final item on the third screen, contains 
a value if you use the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu. I cover 
this option in Chapter 11.
 
✓ If the ISO value on Shooting Data Page 1 (the first screen in Figure 4-22) 
appears in red, the camera is letting you know that it overrode the ISO 
Sensitivity setting that you selected in order to produce a good expo-
sure. This shift occurs only if you enable automatic ISO adjustment for 
the P, S, A, and M exposure modes. See Chapter 5 for details.
Overview Data mode
This mode is the second of the two 
default photo-information modes. 
(Meaning, you don’t have to enable 
it via the Display Mode option on 
the Playback menu to use it.) In this 
mode, the playback screen contains 
a small image thumbnail along with 
scads of shooting data — although 
not quite as much as Shooting Data 
mode — plus a Brightness histogram. 
Figure 4-23 offers a look.
The earlier section “Reading a 
Brightness histogram” tells you what 
to make of that part of the screen. 
Just above the histogram, you see the 
Protect Status and Retouch Indicator, while the Frame Number/Total Pictures 
data appears near the upper-right corner of the image thumbnail. For details 
Figure 4-23: In Overview Data mode, you 
can view your picture along with the major 
camera settings you used to take the picture.

107
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
on that data, see the earlier section “File Information mode.” (As always, the 
Protect Status and Retouch Indicator icons appear only if you used those two 
features; otherwise, the area is empty.)
To sort out the maze of other information, the following list breaks things 
down into the five rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histo-
gram. In the accompanying figures as well as in Figure 4-23, I include all pos-
sible data simply for the purposes of illustration. (I didn’t actually use flash, 
flash compensation, or exposure compensation to capture the eagle photo.) 
If any of the items in the figures don’t appear on your screen, it simply means

Deleting Photos
You have three options for erasing pictures from a memory card when it’s in 
your camera. The next sections give you the lowdown. (Or is it the down low? 
I can’t seem to keep up.)
Deleting images one at a time
 
 The Delete button is key to erasing single images. But the process varies a 
little depending on which Playback display mode you’re using, as follows:
 
✓ In single-image view, you can erase the current image by pressing the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In thumbnail view (displaying 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails), use the Multi Selector 
to highlight the picture you want to erase and then press the Delete button.
 
✓ In Calendar view, first highlight the date that contains the image. Then 
press the Zoom Out button to jump to the scrolling list of thumbnails, 
highlight a specific image, and press the Delete button.
After you press Delete, you see a message asking whether you really want to 
erase the picture. If you do, press the Delete button again. Or, to cancel out 
of the process, press the Playback button.
See the earlier section, “Viewing Images in Playback Mode,” for more details 
about the display modes.

109
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
You can also press the Delete button during the instant-review period if you 
know right away that the picture’s a bust. But you have to be quick or the 
camera returns to shooting mode.
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore it 
by using data-restoration software such as MediaRecover ($30, www.media
recover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also about $30, www.lexar.com). SanDisk 
also currently offers a recovery program with some of its high-performance 
memory cards. But in order to have a chance, you must not take any more 
pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the current 
memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture data for 
good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Deleting all photos
To erase all pictures, take these steps:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Delete, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 4-27.
Figure 4-27: To delete all photos, use the Delete option on the Playback menu.
 
2. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure.
 
3. Highlight All and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You then see a screen that asks you to verify that you want to delete all 
of your images.
 
4. Select Yes and press OK.
 
If you create custom image folders, a feature I cover in Chapter 11, be aware 
that this step deletes only pictures in the folder that is currently selected via 
the Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See the section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chapter, for information.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Deleting a batch of selected photos
To erase multiple photos — but not all of them — display the Playback menu, 
and highlight Delete, as shown on the left in Figure 4-28. Press OK to display 
the second screen in the figure.
Figure 4-28: The Delete menu option also provides two ways to delete only some pictures from 
your memory card.
You then have two options for specifying which photos to erase:
 
? 
✓ Select photos one-by-one. To go 
this route, highlight Selected, as 
shown on the right in Figure 4-28, 
and press the Multi Selector right 
to display a screen of thumbnails, 
as shown in Figure 4-29. Use the 
Multi Selector to place the yellow 
highlight box over the first photo 
you want to delete and then press 
the Zoom Out button, shown in 
the margin here. A little trash can 
icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, appears in the upper-right 
corner of the thumbnail, as 
shown in the figure.
 
 If you change your mind, press 
the Zoom Out button again to 
remove the Delete tag from the image. To undo deletion for all selected 
photos, press the Playback button.

 For a closer look at the selected image, press and hold the Zoom In 
button. When you release the button, the display returns to normal 
thumbnail view.

✓ Erase all photos taken on a specific date. This time, choose Select Date 
from the main Delete screen, as shown on the left in Figure 4-30. Press 
the Multi Selector right to display a list of dates on which you took the 
pictures on the memory card, as shown on the right in the figure.
 
 Next, highlight a date and press the Multi Selector right. A little check mark 
appears in the box next to the date, as shown in Figure 4-30, tagging all 
images taken on that day for deletion. To remove the check mark and save 
the photos from the digital dumpster, press the Multi Selector right again.
 
 Can’t remember what photos are associated with the selected date? 
Try this:
 
? 
• To display thumbnails of all images taken on the selected date, as 
shown on the left in Figure 4-31, press the Zoom Out button.
 
i  
• To temporarily view the selected thumbnail at full-size view, as 
shown on the right in the figure, press the Zoom In button.
 
• To return to the date list, press the Zoom Out button again.
Figure 4-30: With the Select Date option, you can erase all photos taken on a specific date.

After tagging individual photos for deletion or specifying a shooting date to 
delete, press OK to start the Delete process. You see a confirmation screen 
asking permission to destroy the images; select Yes and press OK. The 
camera trashes the photos and returns you to the Playback menu.
 
You have one alternative way to quickly erase all images taken on a specific 
date: In the Calendar display mode, you can highlight the date in question 
and then press the Delete button instead of going through the Playback 
menu. You get the standard confirmation screen asking you whether you 
want to go forward. Press the Delete button again to dump the files. Visit the 
section “Displaying photos in Calendar view,” earlier in this chapter, for the 
scoop on that display option.
Protecting Photos
You can safeguard pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to erase a picture 
by using either the Delete button or the Delete option on the Playback menu.
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format 
Memory Card command, which lives on the 
Setup menu and erases everything on your 
memory card. What’s the difference between 
erasing photos by formatting and by choosing 
Delete from the Playback menu and then select-
ing the All option?
Well, if you happen to have stored other data on 
the card, such as, say, a music file or a picture 
taken on another type of camera, you need to 
format the card to erase everything on it. You 
can’t use Delete to get rid of them.
Also keep in mind that the Delete function 
affects only the currently selected folder of 
camera images. As long as you use the default 
folder system that the camera creates for you, 
however, “currently selected folder” is the 
same as “all images.” The section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chap-
ter, talks more about this issue; Chapter 11 
explains how to create custom folders.
One final — and important — note: Although 
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere 
in this chapter) prevents the Delete function 
from erasing a picture, formatting erases all 
pictures, protected or not. 

113
 Chapter 4: Reviewing Your Photos
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures. 
See the nearby sidebar for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a camera 
with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other people know 
that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make room on the 
memory card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. (This step isn’t fool-
proof, though, because anyone can remove the protected status from an image.)
 
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a read-
only file when you transfer it to your computer. Files that have that read-only 
status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy can remove 
the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing around with 
your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system. Of course, you 
have to know how to remove the read-only status yourself if you plan on edit-
ing your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Nikon ViewNX, you can do 
this by clicking the image thumbnail and then choosing File➪Protect Files➪
Unprotect.)
Anyway, protecting a picture is easy:
 
1. Display or select the picture you want to protect.
 
• In single-image view, just display the photo.
 
• In 4/9/72 thumbnail mode, use the Multi Selector as needed to 
place the yellow highlight box over the photo.
 
• In Calendar view, highlight the date that contains the image and then 
press the Zoom Out button to jump to the scrolling list of thumbnails. 
Then move the highlight 
box over the image.
 
 
2. Press the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 See the tiny key symbol that 
appears next to the button? 
That’s your reminder that you use 
the button to lock a picture. After 
you press the button, the same 
symbol appears on the image dis-
play, as shown in Figure 4-32.
 
3. To remove protection, display 
or select the image and press 
the AE-L/AF-L button again.

Taking Creative 
Control

A
s nice as it is to be able to set your D3000 to 
automatic mode and let the camera handle 
most of the photographic decisions, I encourage 
you to take creative control and explore the 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M). In 
these modes, you can make your own decisions 
about the exposure, focus, and color characteris-
tics of your photo, which are key to capturing a 
compelling image as you see it in your mind’s eye. 
And don’t think that you have to be a genius or 
spend years to be successful — adding just a few 
simple techniques to your photographic reper-
toire can make a huge difference in  the quality of 
the pictures you take.
The fi rst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing 
both some necessary photography fundamentals 
as well as details about using the advanced expo-
sure modes. Following that, Chapter 7 helps you 
draw together all the information presented ear-
lier in the book, summarizing the best camera set-
tings and other tactics to use when capturing 
portraits, action shots, landscapes, and close-up 
shots. In short, this part helps you get the most 
out of your camera, which results in you becom-
ing a better photographer.

U
nderstanding exposure is one of the most intimidating chal-
lenges for the new photographer. Discussions of the 
topic are loaded with technical terms — aperture, meter-
ing, shutter speed, ISO, and the like. Add the fact that 
your D3000 offers many exposure controls, all sport-
ing equally foreign names, and it’s no wonder that 
most people throw up their hands and decide that 
their best option is to simply stick with the Auto 
exposure mode and let the camera take care of all 
exposure decisions.
You can, of course, turn out super shots in Auto 
mode. And I fully relate to the exposure confusion 
you may be feeling — I’ve been there. But I can also 
promise that when you take things nice and slow, 
digesting just a piece of the exposure pie at a time, the 
topic is not nearly as complicated as it seems on the surface. 
And I guarantee that the payoff will be well worth your time and 
brain energy. You’ll not only gain the power to resolve just about any 
exposure problem, but also discover ways to use exposure to put your own 
creative stamp on a scene.

118
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
To that end, this chapter provides everything you need to know to really 
exploit your D3000’s exposure options, from a primer in exposure science 
(it’s not as bad as it sounds) to explanations of all the camera’s exposure 
controls. In addition, because some controls aren’t accessible in the fully 
automatic exposure modes, this chapter also introduces you to the four 
advanced modes, P, S, A, and M.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by 
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a 
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, it’s 
the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are two barriers, known as the aperture and 
shutter, which together control how much light makes its way to the sensor. 
The actual design and arrangement of the aperture, shutter, and sensor vary 
depending on the camera, but Figure 5-1 offers an illustration of the basic 
concept.
The aperture and shutter, along 
with a third feature known as ISO, 
determine exposure — what most of 
us would describe as the picture’s 
overall brightness and contrast. 
This three-part exposure formula 
works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount 
of light): The aperture is an 
adjustable hole in a diaphragm 
set just behind the lens. By 
changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of 
the light beam that can enter 
the camera. Aperture settings 
are stated as f-stop numbers, 
or simply f-stops, and are 
expressed with the letter f fol-
lowed by a number: f/2, f/5.6, 
f/16, and so on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, and 
the more light is permitted into the camera, as illustrated by Figure 5-2.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 The range of possible 
f-stops depends on 
your lens and, if you 
use a zoom lens, on the 
zoom position (focal 
length) of the lens. 
When you use the 
18–55mm lens that 
Nikon bundles in the 
D3000 kit, you can 
select apertures from 
f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed 
all the way out to the 
shortest focal length, 
18mm. When you zoom 
in to the maximum focal 
length, 55mm, the aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a 
discussion of focal lengths.)
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters pre-
vent sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter button, 
the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture 
to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed 
and is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and 
so on. Shutter speeds on the D3000 range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 
second when you shoot without the built-in flash. If you do use the built-
in flash, the range is more limited. See the sidebar “In sync: Flash timing 
and shutter speed,” later in this chapter, for information. 
 
 Should you want a shutter speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) 
exposure mode also provides a feature called bulb exposure. At this set-
ting, the shutter stays open indefinitely as long as you press the shutter 
button down.
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film 
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on. 
Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensitivity, which 
means that less light is needed to produce the image, enabling you to 
use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
 
 On the D3000, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to a whop-
ping 3200. (The 3200 setting is named Hi 1.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that 
strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with many combinations of aperture, shut-
ter speed, and ISO. You’re limited only by the aperture range allowed by the 
lens and the shutter speeds and ISO range offered by the camera.
But as I hinted in the preceding section, the settings you select impact your 
image beyond mere exposure, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects 
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I intro-
duce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow 
depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway 
objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a 
greater distance.
 
 As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo 
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field. 
As an example, take a look at the two images in Figure 5-3. For both 
shots, I established focus on the female statue atop the fountain. Notice 
that the background in the first image, taken at an aperture setting of 
f/14, is softer than in the right example, taken at f/29. Aperture is just 
one contributor to depth of field, however; see Chapter 6 for the com-
plete story. 
 
✓ Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving 
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion 
cleanly. Compare the fountain spray in the photos in Figure 5-3, for 
example. At a shutter speed of 1/20 second (right photo), the water 
blurs, giving it a misty look. At 1/80 second (left photo), the droplets 
appear more sharply focused. How high a shutter speed you need to 
freeze action depends on the speed of your subject.

121
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
f/29, 1/20 second, ISO 100
f/14, 1/80 second, ISO 100
Figure 5-3: Stopping down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number) increases depth 
of field, or the zone of sharp focus.
 
 If your picture suffers from overall blur, where even stationary objects 
appear out of focus, the camera itself moved during the exposure, which 
is always a danger when you handhold the camera. The slower the shut-
ter speed, the longer the exposure time and the longer you have to hold 
the camera still to avoid the blur that is caused by camera shake. For 
example, I was able to successfully handhold the 1/80 second exposure 
you see on the left in Figure 5-3, but at 1/20 second, there was enough 
camera movement to result in the blurry shot shown in Figure 5-4. I 
mounted the camera on the tripod to get the shake-free version shown 
on the right in Figure 5-3.
 
 How slow is too slow? It depends on your physical capabilities and your 
lens — a longer, heavier lens adds to the challenge. For reasons that are 
too technical to get into, camera shake also affects your picture more 
when you shoot with a lens that has a long focal length. So you may be 
able to use a much slower shutter speed when you shoot with a lens 

122
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
that has a maximum focal length 
of 55mm, like the kit lens, than 
if you switch to a 200mm tele-
photo lens. (Chapter 6 explains 
focal length, if the term is new 
to you.)
 
 The best idea is to do your 
own tests to see where your 
handholding limit lies. Start with 
a slow shutter speed — say, in 
the 1/40 second neighborhood, 
and then click off multiple shots, 
increasing the shutter speed for 
each picture. If you have a zoom 
lens, run the test first at the mini-
mum focal length (widest angle) 
and then zoom to the maximum 
focal length for another series of 
shots. Then it’s simply a matter 
of comparing the images in your 
photo editing program. (You may 
not be able to accurately judge 
the amount of blur on the camera 
monitor.) See Chapter 8 to find 
out how to see the shutter speed 
you used for each picture when 
you view your images.
 
 Some Nikon lenses, including the 18–55mm kit lens, offer vibration reduc-
tion, which is designed to help compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake. If you’re using a lens from another manufacturer, the feature may 
go by the name image stabilization or something similar. Whatever you 
call it, this option can enable you to capture sharp images at slightly 
slower shutter speeds than normal when handholding the camera. 
(Again, your mileage may vary, but most people can expect to go at least 
two or three notches down the shutter-speed ramp.) On the D3000 kit 
lens, just set the VR switch on the side of the lens to the On position to 
enable vibration reduction.
 
 See Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for 
more help with action photography.
 
✓ ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor 
more reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect called 
noise. This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in appear-
ance to film grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with high ISO 
film. Noise can also be caused by very long exposure times.
Figure 5-4: Allover blur indicates that the 
camera moved during the exposure.

123
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your 
camera to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting condi-
tions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture and 
shutter speeds you need. Take the lizard photos in Figure 5-5, for exam-
ple. Although the subject itself was very cooperative, staying almost 
completely still for the camera, the light was so dim that even with at 
f/5.6 (the widest aperture available at the lens focal length I was using), I 
needed a shutter speed of 1/25 second to expose the picture at ISO 100. 
This time, I didn’t have a tripod with me, and try as I might to hold the 
camera still to avoid blurring the image, I wasn’t successful, as you can 
see from the left photo in the figure. So I raised the ISO to 400, which 
enabled me to use a much faster shutter speed (1/100 second) and 
squeeze off a shake-free shot. 
f/5.6, 1/100 second, ISO 400
f/5.6, 1/25 second, ISO 100
Figure 5-5: Raising the ISO enabled me to bump the shutter speed up enough to permit a blur-
free handheld shot.
 
 Fortunately, you don’t encounter serious noise on the D3000 until you 
really crank up the ISO. In fact, you may even be able to get away with 
the maximum ISO if you keep your print or display size small. But as 
with other image defects, noise becomes more apparent as you enlarge 
the photo. Noise is also easier to spot in shadow areas of your picture 

124
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
and in large areas of solid color. To give you an idea of how ISO affects 
noise, Figure 5-6 shows you magnified views of a portion of the lizard 
scene captured at each ISO setting.

ISO 1600
ISO 3200 (Hi 1)
ISO 800
Figure 5-6: Each step up the ISO ladder adds more noise, which becomes more visible 
as you enlarge the image.
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect 
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look of 
your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of your 
images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)
Doing the exposure balancing act
 
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the 
same image brightness. Say that you’re shooting a soccer game, for example, 
and you notice that although the overall exposure looks great, the players 
appear slightly blurry at your current shutter speed. If you raise the shut-
ter speed, you have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in 
more light during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the 
camera more sensitive to the light — or both.

125
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
As the preceding section explains, changing these settings impacts your 
image in ways beyond exposure. As a quick reminder:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field, with a higher f-stop number producing a 
greater zone of sharp focus.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects whether motion of the subject or camera results 
in a blurry photo. A faster shutter “freezes” action and also helps safe-
guard against allover blur that can result from camera shake when 
you’re handholding the camera.
 
✓ ISO affects the camera’s sensitivity to light. A higher ISO makes the camera 
more responsive to light but also increases the chance of image noise.
So when you boost that shutter speed to capture your soccer subjects, you 
have to decide whether you prefer the shorter depth of field that comes with a 
larger aperture or the increased risk of noise that accompanies a higher ISO.
Everyone has their own approach to finding the right combination of aper-
ture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your own system 
as you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure modes. In the 
meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want 
without raising the ISO.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of dis-
tance over which objects remain in sharp focus, 
is simply to think of the f as standing for focus. 
A higher f-stop number produces a larger depth 
of field, so if you want to extend the zone of 
sharp focus to cover a greater distance from 
your subject, you set the aperture to a higher 
f-stop. Higher f-stop number, greater zone of 
sharp focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s help-
ful to know if you’re not an optical engineer. 
(Chapter 6 explains focal length, which is help-
ful to know.)
As for the fact that you increase the f-stop 
number when you want a smaller aperture, 
well, I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip 
for that one. But try this in the meantime: Lower 
f-stop, larger aperture. Or maybe the opposite: 
Raise the f-stop to reduce the aperture size and 
restrict the light. (As I said, I’m working on it.)

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my exposure 
decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free photo 
or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that moving 
object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. (The water-
fall photo in Chapter 7 offers an example of the latter technique.)
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shutter 
speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in mind. 
For portraits, for example, I use the largest aperture (the lowest f-stop 
number, known as shooting wide open, in photographer speak) so that I get 
a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft background for my subject. For 
landscapes, I usually go the opposite direction, stopping down the aperture 
as much as possible to capture the subject at the greatest depth of field.
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the 
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation 
will make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for 
specific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for 
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO settings on the D3000.
Exploring the Advanced Exposure Modes
 
In the fully automatic exposure modes, you can control and apply one other 
exposure option, Active D-Lighting, explained later in the chapter. But if you 
want maximum control over exposure, you need to set the Mode dial to one 
of the advanced modes highlighted in Figure 5-7: P, S, A, or M. You also need 
to shoot in these modes to use certain other features, such as manual white 
balancing, a color control that you can explore in Chapter 6.
Each of the four modes offers a different 
way to control aperture and shutter speed:
 
✓ P (programmed autoexposure): In 
this mode, the camera selects both 
aperture and shutter speed. But you 
can choose from different combina-
tions of the two, which gives you 
creative flexibility not possible in the 
fully automatic exposure modes dis-
cussed in Chapter 2. 
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In 
this mode, you select a shutter speed, 
and the camera chooses the aperture 
setting that produces a good exposure 
at your selected ISO setting.
Advanced exposure modes
Figure 5-7: You can control exposure 
and certain other picture properties 
fully only in P, S, A, or M mode.

127
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority 
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting. The 
camera then selects the appropriate shutter speed to properly expose 
the picture.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. 
Advanced shooting reminders: 
Extra help from Guide mode
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the D3000’s 
Guide mode, which features interactive menus 
that are designed to provide you with a little 
more onscreen assistance than the regular 
menus. For reasons I point out in that chapter, I 
think you’ll do better if you stick with the regular 
menus.
However, when you’re first learning about 
aperture, shutter speed, and the effect that the 
two settings have on depth of field and motion 
blur, you can get a helpful assist from Guide 
mode. If you set the Mode dial to Guide, select 
the Shoot icon, and then select Advanced 
Operation, you see a screen with three picture 
options, as shown in the first screen below: 
Soften Backgrounds, Freeze Motion (People), 
and Freeze Motion (Vehicles). After you select 
one of those picture options, the next screen 
tells you which exposure mode works best — 
aperture-priority autoexposure (A mode) or 
shutter-priority autoexposure (S mode), as 
shown in the second screen.
From there, you have two options: Either set the 
Mode dial to A or S and then use the Command 
dial to adjust the aperture or shutter speed, as the 
Guide mode screen suggests, or remain in Guide 
mode and press OK to move on to the next guided 
screen. If you go the second route, you see a 
screen that shows the current f-stop or shutter 
speed, and you press the Multi Selector up or 
down to change the value. Press OK once more 
to exit the guided screens and take your shot.
After you get these advanced techniques down 
pat, you can adjust the camera more quickly by 
simply setting the Mode dial to A or S and then 
rotating the Command dial to adjust the f-stop 
or shutter speed. But any time you need a quick 
reminder of which setting produces which result, 
the Guide mode offers a handy built-in tutor.

128
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that 
are designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with 
some photographic flexibility. Note one important point about the semi-auto 
modes, however: In extreme lighting conditions, the camera may not be able 
to select settings that will produce a good exposure. (The camera will warn 
you about the potential problem but doesn’t prevent you from capturing the 
shot.) Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands. But even in 
Manual mode, you’re never really flying without a net — the camera assists 
you by displaying the exposure meter, explained next.
Reading (And Adjusting) the Meter
To help you determine whether your exposure settings are on cue in M 
(manual) exposure mode, the camera displays an exposure meter in the 
viewfinder and Shooting Info display. The meter is a little linear graphic that 
indicates whether your current settings will properly expose the image. 
Figure 5-8 shows the exposure meter as viewed in the Shooting Info display. 
In the viewfinder, the meter appears to the right of the f-stop and looks 
similar to the examples shown in 
Figure 5-9.
The minus-sign end of the meter rep-
resents underexposure; the plus sign, 
overexposure. So if the little notches 
on the meter fall to the right of 0, as 
shown in the first example in Figure 
5-9, the image will be underexposed. 
If the indicator moves to the left of 
0, as shown in the second example, 
the image will be overexposed. The 
farther the indicator moves toward 
the plus or minus sign, the greater the 
potential problem. When the meter 
shows a balanced exposure, as in the 
third example, you’re good to go.

129
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
In the other exposure modes, the meter appears in the viewfinder and 
Shooting Info screen if the camera anticipates an exposure problem. The 
word Lo at the end of the meter tells you that the photo may be seriously 
underexposed; the word Hi indicates severe overexposure. In dim lighting, 
you may also see a blinking flash symbol. It’s a not-so-subtle suggestion to 
add some light to the scene. A blinking question mark tells you that you can 
press the Zoom Out button to display a Help screen with more information.
Keep in mind that the meter’s suggestion on exposure may not always be the 
one you want to follow. For example, you may want to shoot a backlit subject 
in silhouette, in which case you want that subject to be underexposed. In 
other words, the meter is a guide, not a dictator. In addition, remember that 
the exposure information the meter reports is based on the exposure meter-
ing mode, which determines which part of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure. At the default setting, exposure is based on the 
entire frame, but you can select two other metering modes. See the upcoming 
section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode” for details.
 
One final meter-related tip: The meter turns off automatically if you don’t 
press the shutter button for a period of time — 8 seconds, by default. You 
can adjust the shut-off timing by taking these steps:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and scroll to the Auto Off Timers option, as 
shown on the left in Figure 5-10.
Figure 5-10: You can adjust the timing of the meter’s automatic shutdown.
 
2. Press OK.
 
3. Select Custom, as shown on the right in Figure 5-10, and press OK again.
 
 The Custom choice enables you to adjust the meter shutdown without 
also affecting the shutoff timing of the image-review and playback/menu 
displays, both covered in Chapter 4.

4. Highlight Auto Meter-Off, as shown on the left in Figure 5-11, and 
press OK. 
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 5-11. 
 
5. Select the timing option you want to use and press OK.
 
 Keep in mind that shorter delay times conserve battery power.
 
6. Highlight Done and press OK.
Figure 5-11: To conserve battery power, choose a shorter meter-off delay.
Setting ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed
The next sections detail how to view and adjust these three critical exposure 
settings. Remember, you can adjust ISO in any exposure mode, but to con-
trol aperture (f-stop) or shutter speed, you must switch to one of the four 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, or M).
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can view the current aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed in the view-
finder and Shooting Info display, as shown in Figure 5-12. (Press the Info 
button to display the Shooting Info screen.) 
 
In the viewfinder, shutter speeds are presented as whole numbers, even if the 
shutter speed is set to a fraction of a second. For example, the number 250 
indicates a shutter speed of 1/250 second. When the shutter speed slows to 1 
second or more, quote marks appear after the number — 1” indicates a shut-
ter speed of 1 second, 4” means 4 seconds, and so on.

131
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Shutter speed
Aperture
Figure 5-12: Look for the current f-stop and shutter speed here.
To select aperture and shutter speed, start by pressing the shutter button 
halfway to kick the exposure system into gear. You can then release the 
button if you want. The next step depends on the exposure mode, as follows: 
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera shows you its recom-
mended f-stop and shutter speed when you press the shutter button 
halfway. But you can rotate the Command dial to select a different 
combination of settings. The number of possible combinations depends 
upon the aperture settings the camera can select, which in turn depend 
on the lighting conditions and your lens.
 
 An asterisk (*) appears next to 
the P exposure mode symbol 
in the upper-left corner of the 
Shooting Information display, 
as shown in Figure 5-13, if you 
rotate the Command dial to 
adjust the aperture/shutter 
speed settings. You see a tiny 
P* symbol at the left end of the 
viewfinder display as well. To 
get back to the initial combo 
of shutter speed and aperture, 
rotate the Command dial until 
the asterisk disappears from 
the Shooting Info display and the 
P* symbol turns off in the 
viewfinder.
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select the shutter 
speed. Just rotate the Command dial to get the job done.
Figure 5-13: In P mode, the asterisk indicates 
that you shifted to a different combination of 
aperture and shutter speed than the camera 
originally chose.

132
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 As you change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the 
aperture as needed to maintain what it considers the proper exposure. 
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even 
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop, 
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme 
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture 
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed — 
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need to 
compromise on shutter speed (or in dim lighting, raise the ISO).
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you control aperture, 
and the camera adjusts shutter speed automatically. To set the aperture 
(f-stop), rotate the Command dial.
 
 When you stop down the aperture (raise the f-stop value), be care-
ful that the shutter speed doesn’t drop so low that you run the risk of 
camera shake if you handhold the camera — unless you have a tripod 
handy, of course. And if your scene contains moving objects, make sure 
that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that the 
camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur it, 
if that’s your creative goal). These same warnings apply when you use P 
mode, by the way.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Command dial. 
 
 
• To adjust aperture: Press the Exposure Compensation button while 
simultaneously rotating the Command dial. Notice the little 
aperture-like symbol that lies next to the button, on the top of 
the camera? That’s your reminder of the button’s role in setting 
the f-stop in Manual mode.
 
Keep in mind that when you use P, S, or A modes, the settings that the 
camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you 
don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to manual 
exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver 
the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can 
tweak exposure using the Exposure Compensation feature, explained later in 
this chapter.
Controlling ISO
The ISO setting, introduced at the start of this chapter, adjusts the camera’s 
sensitivity to light. At a higher ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed or 
a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) because less light is needed to 
expose the image.

133
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
You can adjust ISO in any exposure mode, as follows:
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings screen: Press the Zoom In button twice to bring up the 
Quick Settings display. (Or press the Info button and then the Zoom In 
button.) Highlight the ISO setting as shown on the left in Figure 5-14 and 
press OK to display the options shown on the right. Choose the desired 
ISO setting and press OK.
 
 If you change ISO settings frequently, you may want to set the Function 
(Fn) button to perform the job of displaying the ISO Sensitivity options, 
as outlined in Chapter 11. The normal job of the button is to set the 
Release mode to the Self-Timer setting for your next shot, so you need to 
decide which function will be more helpful to you.
 
✓ Shooting menu: As shown in Figure 5-15, you also can adjust the ISO 
through the Shooting menu. Note that the second screen in the figure 
shows options available in the P, S, A, and M modes; you can access only 
the top option in the other exposure modes.
Figure 5-14: You can adjust ISO easily through the Quick Settings screen.
Figure 5-15: You can also set ISO and access additional ISO options through the Shooting menu.

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Keep these additional ISO factoids in mind:
 
✓ Auto ISO in Auto and Scene modes: In these exposure modes, the list of 
ISO settings includes Auto ISO. Select this option if you want the camera 
to take the ISO reins entirely. (This setting is the default.)
 
✓ Auto ISO in advanced exposure modes: In the advanced exposure 
modes (P, S, A, and M), Auto ISO doesn’t appear on the ISO settings list. 
However, you still can enable Auto ISO as sort of a safety net. Here’s 
how it works: You dial in a specific ISO setting — say, ISO 100. If the 
camera decides that it can’t properly expose the image at that ISO given 
your current aperture and shutter speed, it automatically adjusts ISO as 
necessary.
 
 To get to this option, first select ISO Sensitivity Settings on the Shooting 
menu, as shown on the left in Figure 5-15. Then press OK to display the 
screen shown on the right. Highlight Auto ISO Sensitivity, press OK, and 
then highlight On, as shown in Figure 5-16. The camera will now override 
your ISO choice when it thinks a proper exposure is not possible with 
the settings you’ve specified. 
 
 Next, use the Maximum Sensitivity and Minimum Shutter Speed options, 
shown in Figure 5-17, to tell the camera exactly when it should step in 
and offer ISO assistance: 
 
• Maximum Sensitivity: Specify the highest ISO setting the camera 
may select when it does override your ISO decision. 
 
• Minimum Shutter Speed: Set the minimum shutter speed at which 
the ISO override engages when you use the P and A exposure 
modes.
 
 For example, you can specify that you want the camera to amp up 
ISO if needed to prevent the shutter speed from dropping below 
1/60 second.
Figure 5-16: To use Auto ISO in P, S, A, and M exposure modes, you must turn the option on 
through the Setup menu.

135
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 If the camera is about to override 
your ISO setting, it alerts you by 
blinking the ISO Auto label in the 
viewfinder. The message “ISO-A” 
blinks at the top of the Shooting 
Info screen as well. And in 
Playback mode, the ISO value 
appears in red if you view your 
photos in a display mode that 
includes the ISO value. (Chapter 
4 has details.)
 
 To disable Auto ISO override, 
just reset the Auto ISO Sensitivity 
option to Off.
 
✓ ISO value display: Although the Shooting Info screen always displays the 
current ISO setting, the viewfinder reports the ISO value only when the 
option is set to Auto. Otherwise, the ISO area of the viewfinder is empty.
 
✓ Hi 1: The specific ISO values presented to you range from 100 to 1600. 
But if you scroll past 1600, you discover an additional setting called Hi 1. 
This setting translates to an ISO value of 3200. 
 
Choosing ISO 1600 pretty much ensures a noisy image (refer to Figure 5-6), 
and shifting to the Hi setting just makes things worse. If cranking up ISO is 
the only way to capture the image, and you’d rather have a noisy picture 
than no picture, go for it. Otherwise, adjust shutter speed and aperture to 
get the exposure you want instead. You can always mount the camera on 
a tripod if the shutter speed is too slow for using the camera handheld, 
although you should keep in mind that a long exposure time also can pro-
duce added noise.
Also check out the nearby sidebar “Dampening noise” for a feature that may 
help calm noise somewhat.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
To fully interpret what your exposure meter tells you, you need to know 
which metering mode is active. The metering mode determines which part of 
the frame the camera analyzes to calculate the proper exposure. The meter-
ing mode affects the exposure-meter reading as well as the exposure set-
tings that the camera chooses in the fully automatic shooting modes (Auto, 
Portrait, and so on) as well as in the semi-auto modes (P, S, and A).
Figure 5-17: You can tell the camera how you 
want it to implement Auto ISO override.

136
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures 
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-6), can occur 
for two reasons: a high ISO speed and a long 
exposure time.
The D3000 offers a tool for dealing with both 
cause of noise. If you visit the Setup menu and 
enable the Noise Reduction feature, as shown 
here, the camera applies a filter designed to 
soften the appearance of noise. A couple of 
issues to note: 
 ✓ The filter is applied only to pictures taken at 
shutter speeds of longer than 8 seconds or 
ISO settings of 400 and above.
 
 The filter is applied after you take the pic-
ture, as the camera processes the image 
data. While the filter is being applied, the 
message “Job nr” appears in the view-
finder, in the area normally reserved for the 
shutter speed and aperture, and you can’t 
take another picture until the camera has 
finished its noise cleanup routing. The time 
needed to apply the filter can slow down 
your shooting speed.
 ✓ If you choose Off, the camera actually 
still applies a tiny amount of noise removal, 
but only at ISO settings over 800. This 
camera doesn’t apply this automatic noise 
removal when you use a slow shutter speed, 
however. Nor do you typically experience 
any camera slowdown or see the Job nr 
symbol.
Perhaps most important, you should know that 
noise-reduction filters work primarily by apply-
ing a slight blur to the image. Don’t expect this 
process to totally eliminate noise, and do expect 
some resulting image softness. You may be able 
to get better results by using the blur tools or 
noise-removal filters found in many photo edi-
tors, because you can blur just the parts of 
the image where noise is most noticeable — 
usually in areas of flat color or little detail, such 
as skies.
Your D3000 offers three metering modes, described in the following list and 
represented on the Shooting Information display by the icons you see in the 
margins:

137
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
✓ Matrix: The camera analyzes the entire frame and then selects an expo-
sure that’s designed to produce a balanced exposure.
 
 Your camera manual refers to this mode as 3D Color Matrix II, which is 
simply the label that Nikon created to describe the specific technology 
used in this mode.
 
 
✓ Center-weighted: The camera 
bases exposure on the entire 
frame but puts extra emphasis — 
or weight — on the center of the 
frame. When you choose this 
metering option, the area that’s 
given priority is about 8mm in 
diameter, which is represented 
by the circle in the viewfinder, 
labeled in Figure 5-18. 
 
 
✓ Spot: In this mode, the camera 
bases exposure entirely on a cir-
cular area that’s about 3.5mm 
in diameter. The exact location 
used for this pin-point metering 
depends on an autofocusing 
option called the AF-area mode. 
Detailed in Chapter 6, this option 
determines which of the camera’s 11 focus points the autofocusing 
system uses to establish focus. Here’s how the setting affects exposure:
 
• If you choose the Auto-area mode, in which the camera chooses the 
focus point for you, exposure is based on the center focus point.
 
• If you use any of the other AF-area modes, which enable you to select 
a specific focus point, the camera bases exposure on that point.
 
 Because of this autofocus/autoexposure relationship, it’s best to switch to 
one of the AF-area modes that allow focus-point selection when you want 
to use spot metering. In the Auto-area mode, exposure may be incorrect if 
you compose your shot so that the subject isn’t at the center of the frame.
As an example of how metering mode affects exposure, Figure 5-19 shows the 
same image captured at each mode. In the Matrix example, the bright back-
ground caused the camera to select an exposure that left the statue quite 
dark. Switching to center-weighted metering helped somewhat, but didn’t 
quite bring the statue out of the shadows. Spot metering produced the best 
result as far as the statue goes, although the resulting increase in exposure 
left the sky a little washed out.
Center-weighted metering circle
Figure 5-18: When calculating exposure with 
center-weighted metering, the camera gives 
added weight to objects that fall under the 
circle.

Matrix metering

Spot metering
Figure 5-19: The metering mode determines which area of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure.
You don’t have a choice of metering modes in any of the fully automatic 
exposure modes; the camera automatically uses matrix mode for all shots. 
But in P, A, S, or M modes, you can specify which metering mode you prefer. 
Use either the Quick Settings display or Shooting menu to make your choice:
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings display: When the Shooting Information screen is dis-
played, press the Zoom In button to shift to the Quick Settings display. 
Then use the Multi Selector to navigate to the Metering mode icon, as 
shown on the left in Figure 5-20. Press OK to display the second screen 
in the figure, select the desired mode, and press OK again to make the 
change.
Figure 5-20: The Quick Settings display offers the fastest route to changing the metering mode.

139
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Shooting menu: On the Shooting menu, scroll all the way toward the 
bottom of the menu to find the Metering option and then press OK to 
display the list of metering options, as shown in Figure 5-21.
 
The metering mode you choose stays in effect when shooting in P, S, A, and 
M modes, even when you turn the camera off. Remember to change the 
metering mode when taking a picture under different lighting conditions.
Figure 5-21: But you also can change the metering mode through the Shooting menu.
 
In theory, the best practice is to check the metering mode before you shoot 
and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in practice, 
that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one more cap-
ture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more capture 
setting. So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the other 
controls on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is matrix 
metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, after all, 
you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the camera 
metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the expo-
sure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole meter-
ing mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of 
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and 
background, as in my examples here. Then, switching to center-weighted 
metering or spot metering may save you the time of having to adjust the 
exposure for each image. You may also want to investigate the section 
“Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting,” which tells you about a 
camera feature that can help you record brighter shadows without losing 
highlights.

140
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Applying Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, S, or A modes, you can enjoy autoexpo-
sure support but still retain some control over the final exposure. If you think 
that the image the camera produced is too dark or too light, you can use a 
feature known as Exposure Compensation.
This feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a darker or lighter 
exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is appropriate. Best 
of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the whole camera to 
understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in 
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +5.0 EV to –5.0 EV. (The EV stands 
for exposure value.)
 
 Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one 
stop. In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure com-
pensation setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the resulting exposure is equiv-
alent to adjusting the aperture or shutter speed to allow half as much 
light into the camera as at the current setting. If you instead raise the 
value to EV +1.0, the exposure is equivalent to adjusting the settings to 
allow twice the light.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment.
 
✓ For a brighter image, raise the EV value. The higher you go, the brighter 
the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, lower the EV value.
As an example, take a look at the first image in Figure 5-22. The initial expo-
sure selected by the camera left the balloon a tad too dark for my taste. So I 
just amped the Exposure Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced 
the brighter exposure on the right.
You can view the current Exposure Compensation setting in the Shooting Info 
screen; look for it in the area highlighted in the left screen in Figure 5-23. To 
change the setting, you have two options:
 
 
✓ Press the Exposure Compensation button while rotating the Command 
dial. As soon as you press the button, the Shooting Info display appears 
as shown on the right in Figure 5-23. If you’re looking through the view-
finder, the frames-remaining value is temporarily replaced by the 
Exposure Compensation value when you press the Exposure 
Compensation button. 
 
 While holding the Exposure Compensation button, rotate the Command 
dial to adjust the EV value. As you change the setting, the exposure 

141
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
meter in the viewfinder and Shooting Information display will update to 
show you the degree of adjustment you’re making.
 
 After you release the button, the Shooting Info screen goes back to 
normal, and the frames-remaining value returns to the viewfinder.

5-24. Press the Zoom In button twice to get to the display (or press Info 
and then Zoom In). Then use the Multi Selector to highlight the setting 
and press OK to access the available settings. Make your selection and 
press OK again.
 
Your Exposure Compensation setting remains in force until you change it, 
even if you power off the camera. So you may want to make a habit of check-
ing the setting before each shoot or always setting the value back to EV 0.0 
after taking the last shot for which you want to apply compensation.
Figure 5-24: You also can raise or lower the Exposure Compensation value through the Quick 
Settings screen.
Here are a few other tips about Exposure Compensation:
 
✓ How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request 
through your Exposure Compensation setting depends on the exposure 
mode:
 
• In A (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode, the camera adjusts the 
shutter speed but leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure to 
check the resulting shutter speed to make sure that it isn’t so slow 
that camera shake or blur from moving objects is problematic.
 
• In S (shutter-priority autoexposure) mode, the opposite occurs: 
The camera opens or stops down the aperture, leaving your 
selected shutter speed alone. 
 
• In P (programmed autoexposure) mode, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both.
 
• In all three modes, the camera may also adjust ISO if you have 
Auto ISO enabled.

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 Keep in mind that the camera can adjust f-stop only so much, according 
to the aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, too, is 
limited by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those ranges, you 
either have to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO.
 
✓ Finally, if you don’t want to fiddle with Exposure Compensation, just 
switch to Manual exposure mode — M, on the Mode dial — and select 
whatever aperture and shutter speed settings produce the exposure 
you’re after. Exposure Compensation has no effect on manual expo-
sures; again, that adjustment is made only in the P, S, and A modes.
Using Autoexposure Lock
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture 
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps 
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For example, say that you set your camera to shutter-priority autoexposure 
(S) mode and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second. The camera immediately 
reports the f-stop that it considers appropriate to expose the scene at that 
shutter speed. But if the light in the scene changes or you reframe your shot 
before snapping the picture, the camera may shift the f-stop automatically to 
make sure that the exposure remains correct.
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right set-
tings for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture the 
image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of 
exposure settings. For example, perhaps you want your subject to appear at 
the far edge of the frame. If you were to use the normal shooting technique, 
you would place the subject under a focus point, press the shutter button 
halfway to lock focus and set the initial exposure, and then reframe to your 
desired composition to take the shot. The problem is that exposure is then 
recalculated based on the new framing, which can leave your subject under- 
or overexposed.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings that work best 
for your subject. But if you prefer to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can press 
the AE-L/AF-L button to lock exposure and focus simultaneously. Here’s the 
technique I recommend:
 
1. Set the metering mode to spot metering.
 
 See the section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode,” earlier in this 
chapter, if you need help changing the metering mode. You can select a 
metering mode through the Shooting menu or Quick Settings display.

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
2. Set the AF-area mode option to the Single Point setting and then use 
the Multi Selector to select your desired focus point.
 
 This step tells the camera which part of the frame you want to use for 
establishing focus and, if you use spot metering, also determines which 
part of the frame the camera uses to calculate exposure. (You some-
times need to press the shutter button halfway and release it before you 
can do so.)
 
 You can set the AF-area mode through the Shooting menu or the Quick 
Settings display; see Chapter 6 for details. After you select the Single 
Point option, you can use the Multi Selector to choose a focusing point. 
 
3. Frame your shot so that the subject appears under the selected focus 
point and then press the shutter button halfway to set focus.
 
 
4. Press and hold the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 
 The button’s just to the right of the viewfinder.
 
 While the button is pressed, the letters AE-L appear at the left end of the 
viewfinder to remind you that exposure lock is applied. 
 
5. Reframe the shot if desired and take the photo.
 
 Be sure to keep holding the AE-L/AF-L button until you release the shut-
ter button! 
By default, this step locks both exposure and focus for as long as you press 
the AE-L/AF-L button, even if you release the shutter button. (AE-L stands 
for autoexposure lock; AF-L, for autofocus lock.) But if you dig into the Setup 
menu, you can change the button’s function. You can set the button to lock 
only exposure, for example, or only focus, instead of locking both as it does 
by default. Chapter 11 offers details.
One more tidbit: You can also use Autoexposure Lock in the fully automatic 
exposure modes. However, because those modes use matrix metering, this 
technique usually doesn’t work well in those modes.
Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting
A scene like the one in Figure 5-25 presents the classic photographer’s 
challenge: Choosing exposure settings that capture the darkest parts of the 
subject appropriately causes the brightest areas to be overexposed. And if 
you instead “expose for the highlights” — that is, set the exposure settings to 
capture the brightest regions properly — the darker areas are underexposed.
In the past, you had to choose between favoring the highlights or the shadows. 
But thanks to a feature that Nikon calls Active D-Lighting, you have a better 
chance of keeping your highlights intact while better exposing the darkest 

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
areas. In my seal scene, turning on Active D-Lighting produced a brighter 
rendition of the darkest parts of the rocks and the seals, for example, and yet 
the color in the sky didn’t get blown out as it did when I captured the image 
with Active D-Lighting turned off. The highlights in the seal and in the rocks 
on the lower-right corner of the image also are toned down a tad in the Active 
D-Lighting version.
Active D-Lighting Off
Active D-Lighting On
Figure 5-25: Active D-Lighting enabled me to capture the shadows without blowing out the 
highlights.
 
Active D-Lighting actually does its thing in two stages. First, it selects expo-
sure settings that result in a slightly darker exposure than normal. This half 
of the equation guarantees that you retain details in your highlights. Without 
that adjustment, the brightest areas of the image might be overexposed, leav-
ing you with a batch of all-white pixels that really should contain a range of 
tones from light to lighter to white. So a cloud, for example, would appear as 
a big white blob, with no subtle tonal details to give it form. After you snap 
the photo, the second part of the process occurs. During this phase, the 
camera applies an internal software filter to brighten only the darkest areas 
of the image. This adjustment rescues shadow detail, so that you wind up 
with a range of dark tones instead of a big black blob.

146
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
As with many other exposure settings, you can turn Active D-Lighting on and 
off in two ways: 
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings display: After displaying the Shooting Information 
screen, press the Zoom In button to shift to Quick Settings mode. Then 
use the Multi Selector to highlight the Active D-Lighting option, as 
shown on the left in Figure 5-26. Press OK to get to the screen shown on 
the right in the figure, where you can turn the adjustment on and off. 
Highlight your choice and press OK.
Figure 5-26: You can change the Active D-Lighting setting easily via the Quick Settings screen.
 
✓ Shooting menu: If you prefer 
menus to the Quick Settings dis-
play, you can enable and disable 
the Active D-Lighting adjustment 
from the Shooting menu, as 
shown in Figure 5-27. 
Active D-Lighting does have a couple 
of drawbacks. First, the camera takes 
longer to record your shot because 
it needs time to apply the exposure 
adjustment. For rapid-fire action 
shooting, then, it’s best to disable the 
feature.
Second, you may notice increased 
noise in your photos when you combine Active D-Lighting with a higher ISO 
setting. The extra noise is usually most apparent in the shadow areas of the 
picture.
Figure 5-27: Or enable the adjustment through 
the Shooting menu.

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
If you opt out of Active D-Lighting, remember that the camera’s Retouch 
menu offers a D-Lighting filter that applies a similar adjustment to exist-
ing pictures. (See Chapter 10 for help.) Some photo editing programs, such 
as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Photoshop, also have good shadow 
and highlight recovery filters. In either case, when you shoot with Active 
D-Lighting disabled, you’re better off setting the initial exposure settings to 
record the highlights as you want them. It’s very difficult to bring back lost 
highlight detail after the fact, but you typically can unearth at least a little bit 
of detail from the darkest areas of the image.
Using Flash in P, S, A, and M Modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO pro-
duces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to add 
more light. The built-in flash on your D3000 offers the most convenient 
solution.
 
When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you have much more con-
trol over your flash than when you use the fully automatic modes covered in 
Chapter 2. First, you gain access to flash modes not available in the full-auto 
modes. Even better, you can adjust the strength of the flash by using a fea-
ture called Flash Compensation.
The rest of this chapter explains how to use these flash functions and also 
offers some tips on getting better results in your flash pictures. Be sure to 
also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional flash and lighting tips 
related to specific types of photographs.
Enabling flash and adjusting the flash mode
 
 To raise the built-in flash in P, S, A, and M exposure modes, press the Flash 
button on the front-left side of the camera. You then can view the current 
flash mode in the Shooting Info display, as labeled in Figure 5-28. In the view-
finder, you see a simple lightning-bolt icon when flash is enabled.
To change the flash mode, use either of these two techniques:
 
✓ Hold the Flash button down as you rotate the Command dial. As soon 
as you press the button, the Shooting Info screen changes to display the 
Flash mode flag, as shown in Figure 5-29. Keep the button pressed while 
rotating the dial to cycle through the available flash modes.
 
✓ Use the Quick Settings display. Alternatively, you can set the flash 
mode through the Quick Settings screen, as shown in Figure 5-30. After 
highlighting the Flash mode icon, press OK to access the available set-
tings. Highlight the desired mode and press OK.

148
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Flash on
Flash mode
Figure 5-28: You can verify the flash mode in the Shooting Info display; the viewfinder shows 
the “flash on” symbol only.
Your flash mode choices break down 
into three basic categories, described 
in the next sections: fill flash; red-eye 
reduction flash; and the sync modes, 
slow-sync and rear-sync, which are 
special-purpose flash options. Note 
that the list of available flash modes 
doesn’t include three options avail-
able in the fully automatic exposure 
modes: Auto, in which the camera 
makes the decisions about when to 
fire the flash; its companion, Auto Plus 
Red-Eye Reduction; and Off. Instead, if 
you don’t want the flash to fire, simply 
keep the flash unit closed.
Figure 5-30: You also can adjust the flash mode through the Quick Settings display.
Figure 5-29: After raising the flash, press the 
Flash button while rotating the Command dial 
to change the flash mode.

149
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
The camera does give you a little auto-flash input though: You see a blinking 
question mark, flash symbol, or both in the viewfinder in the P, S, and A modes 
if the camera you need to use flash, and the Shooting Info display also tells you 
that the scene is too dark. Press the Zoom Out button (the one with the ques-
tion mark above it), and a message appears recommending that you use flash.
 
Before moving on to explore the flash modes, here’s one tip that applies to all 
of them: Pay careful attention to your results when you use the built-in flash 
with a telephoto lens that is very long. You may find that the flash casts an 
unwanted shadow when it strikes the lens. For best results, try switching to 
an external flash head, as discussed near the end of this chapter.
Fill flash
 
 The fill flash setting is represented by the plain-old lightning-bolt symbol you 
see in the margin here. You can think of this setting as “normal flash” — at 
least in the way that most of us think of using a flash.
You may also hear this mode called force flash because the flash fires no 
matter what the available light, unlike in the Auto flash mode provided for 
the fully automatic exposure modes, in which the camera decides when flash 
is needed. In Fill flash mode, the flash fires even in the brightest daylight — 
which, by the way, is often an excellent idea.
 
Yep, you read me correctly: Adding a flash can really improve outdoor 
photos, even when the sun is at its sunniest. Just as an example, Figure 5-31 
shows a floral image taken both with and without a flash. The small pop of 
light provided by the built-in flash is also extremely beneficial when shoot-
ing subjects that happen to be slightly shaded, such as the carousel horses 
featured in the next section. For outdoor portraits, a flash is even more 
important; the section on shooting still portraits in Chapter 7 discusses that 
subject and offers a look at the difference a flash can make.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-31. This color shift occurs because when you enable 
the flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to 
compensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually 
lit primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance 
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t 
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual 
white balance adjustment.
 
Do note, however, that when you use the built-in flash, you’re restricted to a 
top shutter speed of 1/200 second. That means that in very bright sun, you 
may need to stop down the aperture significantly or lower ISO, if possible, to 
avoid overexposing the image. See the sidebar “In Sync: Flash timing and 
shutter speed,” later in this chapter, for details on shutter-speed ranges avail-
able for flash photography. 

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-31: Adding flash resulted in better illumination and a slight warming effect.
Red-eye reduction flash
Red-eye is caused when flash light bounces off a subject’s retinas and is 
reflected back to the camera lens. Red-eye is a human phenomena, though; 
with animals, the reflected light usually glows yellow, white, or green, pro-
ducing an image that looks like your pet is possessed by some demon.
Man or beast, this issue isn’t nearly the problem with the type of pop-up flash 
found on your D3000 as it is on non-SLR cameras. The D3000’s flash is posi-
tioned in such a way that the flash light usually doesn’t hit a subject’s eyes 
straight on, which lessens the chances of red-eye. However, red-eye may still 
be an issue when you use a lens with a long focal length (a telephoto lens) or 
you shoot subjects from a distance.
 
 If you do notice red-eye, you can try the red-eye reduction mode, represented 
by the icon shown in the margin here. In this mode, the AF-assist lamp on the 
front of the camera lights up briefly before the flash fires. The subject’s 
pupils constrict in response to the light, allowing less flash light to enter the 
eye and cause that glowing red reflection. Be sure to warn your subjects to 
wait for the flash, or they may step out of the frame or stop posing after they 
see the light from the AF-assist lamp.
For an even better solution, try the flash-free portrait tips covered in Chapter 
7. If you do a lot of portrait work that requires flash, you may also want to 

151
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
consider an external flash unit, which enables you to aim the flash light in 
ways that virtually eliminate red-eye.
If all else fails, check out Chapter 10, which shows you how to use the built-in 
red-eye removal tool on your camera’s Retouch menu. Sadly, though, this fea-
ture removes only red-eye, not the yellow/green/white eye that you get with 
animal portraits.
Slow-sync and rear-sync flash
In fill flash and red-eye reduction flash modes, the flash and shutter are syn-
chronized so that the flash fires at the exact moment the shutter opens.
 
Technical types refer to this flash arrangement as front-curtain sync.
Your D3000 also offers four special-sync modes, which work as follows:
 
✓ Slow-sync flash: This mode, available only in the P and A exposure 
modes, also uses front-curtain sync but allows a shutter speed slower 
than the 1/60 second minimum that is in force when you use fill flash 
and red-eye reduction flash.
 
 The benefit of this longer exposure is that the camera has time to 
absorb more ambient light, which in turn has two effects: Background 
areas that are beyond the reach of the flash appear brighter; and less 
flash power is needed, resulting in softer lighting.
 
 The downside of the slow shutter speed is, well, the slow shutter speed. 
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the longer the exposure time, the 
more you have to worry about blur caused by movement of your subject 
or your camera. A tripod is essential to a good outcome, as are subjects 
that can hold very, very still. I find that the best practical use for this 
mode is shooting nighttime still-life subjects such as the one you see in 
Figure 5-32. However, if you’re shooting a nighttime portrait and you 
have a subject that can maintain a motionless pose, slow-sync flash can 
produce softer, more flattering light. Again, the portrait section of 
Chapter 7 offers an example.
 
 Some photographers, on the other hand, turn the downside of slow-sync 
flash to an upside, using it to purposely blur their subjects. The idea is 
to use the blur to emphasize motion.
 
 Note that even though the official slow-sync flash mode appears only in 
the P and A exposure modes, you can get the same result in the M and 
S modes by simply using a slow shutter speed and the normal, fill flash 
mode. You can use a shutter speed as slow as 30 seconds when using 
flash in those modes.

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Slow-sync flash
Normal flash
Figure 5-32: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting than normal flash in nighttime 
pictures.
 
✓ Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, available only in shutter-priority (S) 
and manual (M) exposure modes, the flash fires at the very end of the 
exposure, just before the shutter closes. The classic use of this mode 
is to combine the flash with a slow shutter speed to create trailing-light 
effects like the one you see in Figure 5-33. With rear-curtain sync, the 
light trails extend behind the moving object (my hand, and the match, in 
this case), which makes visual sense. If instead you use slow-sync flash, 
the light trails appear in front of the moving object.
 
✓ Slow-sync with rear-curtain sync: Hey, not confusing enough for you 
yet? This mode enables you to produce the same motion trail effects as 
with rear-curtain sync, but in the P and A exposure modes.
 
✓ Slow-sync with red-eye reduction: In P and A exposure modes, you can 
also combine a slow-sync flash with the red-eye reduction feature. Given 
the potential for blur that comes with a slow shutter, plus the potential 
for subjects to mistake the prelight from the AF-assist lamp for the real 
flash and walk out of the frame before the image is actually recorded, I 
vote this flash mode as the most difficult to pull off successfully.

153
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
All of these modes are somewhat 
tricky to use successfully, however. 
So have fun playing around, but at the 
same time, don’t feel too badly if you 
don’t have time right now to master 
these modes plus all the other expo-
sure options presented to you in this 
chapter. In the meantime, do a Web 
search for slow-sync and rear-sync 
image examples if you want to get a 
better idea of the special effects that 
other photographers create with these 
flash modes.
Adjusting flash output
 
When you shoot with your built-in 
flash, the camera attempts to adjust 
the flash output as needed to produce 
a good exposure. But if you shoot in 
the P, S, A, or M exposure modes and 
you want a little more or less flash light 
than the camera thinks is appropriate, 
you can adjust the flash output by using 
a feature called Flash Compensation.
In sync: Flash timing and shutter speed
In order to properly expose flash pictures, the 
camera has to synchronize the timing of the 
flash output with the opening and closing of 
the shutter. For this reason, the range of shut-
ter speeds available to you is more limited when 
you use flash than when you go flash-free.
When you use flash, the maximum shutter 
speed is 1/200 second. The minimum shut-
ter speed varies depending on your exposure 
mode, as follows:
 ✓ Auto, Portrait, Child modes: 1/60 second
 ✓ Close Up mode: 1/125 second
 ✓ Nighttime Portrait mode: 1 second
 ✓ P, A modes: 1/60 second (unless you use 
one of the slow-sync flash modes, which 
permit a slower shutter speed)
 ✓ S mode: 30 seconds
 ✓ M mode: 30 seconds (unless you use bulb 
mode, in which the shutter stays open as 
long as you hold the shutter button down)
These same shutter-speed requirements apply 
to both the built-in flash and an external flash 
head.
Figure 5-33: I used rear-curtain flash to create 
this candle-lighting image.

154
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
This feature works just like Exposure Compensation, discussed earlier in the 
chapter, except that it enables you to override the camera’s flash-power deci-
sion instead of its autoexposure decision. As with Exposure Compensation, 
the Flash Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value) 
numbers. A setting of 0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the 
flash power to EV +1.0 or decrease it to EV –3.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature, look at the carousel images in 
Figure 5-34. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a 
flash to compensate for the fact that the horses were shadowed by the roof 
of the carousel. But at normal flash power, as shown in the middle image, the 
flash was too strong, creating glare in some spots and blowing out the high-
lights in the white mane. By dialing the flash power down to EV –0.7, I got a 
softer flash that straddled the line perfectly between no flash and too much 
flash.
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV −0.7
Figure 5-34: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower 
Flash Compensation setting.

155
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a Flash 
Compensation of +1.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply 
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t 
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the 
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
With that preface in mind, you can enable Flash Compensation in two ways:
 
  
 
✓ Use the two-button plus 
Command dial maneuver. First, 
press the Flash button to pop up 
the built-in flash. Then press and 
hold the Flash button and the 
Exposure Compensation button 
simultaneously. When you press 
the buttons, you see the screen 
shown in Figure 5-35. In the view-
finder, the current setting takes 
the place of the usual frames-
remaining value. While keeping 
both the buttons pressed, rotate 
the Command dial to adjust the 
setting. I find that any technique 
that involves coordinating this 
many fingers a little complex, but 
you may find it easier than I do.
 
i  
✓ Use the Quick Settings screen. Just bring up the Shooting Info display, 
press the Zoom In button to shift to Quick Settings mode, and highlight 
the Flash Compensation setting, as shown on the left in Figure 5-36. 
Press OK to display a screen where you can set the flash power, as 
shown in the second screen of the figure. Press the Multi Selector up or 
down to change the setting and then press OK.
Figure 5-36: For a less cumbersome way to adjust flash power, use the Quick Settings screen.
Figure 5-35: Rotate the Command dial 
while pressing the Flash and Exposure 
Compensation buttons to adjust flash power.

156
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
As with Exposure Compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control. 
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.
If you’re an advanced flash user and want to control flash power manually, 
Chapter 11 shows you how. 
Using an external flash head
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-geek 
terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external flash head 
like the one shown in Figure 5-37. The 
figure features the Nikon Speedlight 
SB-600, which currently retails for 
about $225. (The hot shoe is covered 
by a little cap when you first get the 
camera; you have to remove it to add 
your flash.)
Although not the cheapest of acces-
sories, an external flash may be a 
worthwhile investment if you do a 
lot of flash photography. For one 
thing, an external flash offers greater 
power, enabling you to illuminate a 
larger area than you can with a built-
in flash. And with flash units like the 
one in Figure 5-37, you can rotate 
the flash head so that the flash light 
bounces off a wall or ceiling instead 
of hitting your subject directly. This 
results in softer lighting and can 
eliminate the harsh shadows often 
caused by the strong, narrowly 
focused light of a built-in flash. 
(Chapter 7 offers an example of the 
difference this lighting technique 
can make in portraits.)
If you do purchase an external flash, I highly recommend that you visit a good 
camera store, where the personnel can help you select the right unit for the 
kind of flash work you want to do. You may also want to dig into some of the 
many books that concentrate on flash photography and the Nikon Creative 
Lighting System. There’s a lot more to that game than you may imagine, and 
you’ll no doubt discover some great ideas about lighting your pictures with 
flash. You can start with Chapter 7, which provides some specific examples of 
how to get better flash results when you shoot portraits, whether you go with 
the built-in flash, an external flash, or, my favorite, no flash.
Figure 5-37: You can mount a flash head via the 
hot shoe on top of the camera.

Manipulating Focus and Color
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling the camera’s autofocusing performance
▶ Getting manual-focusing assistance
▶ Understanding focal lengths, depth of field, and other focus factors
▶ Exploring white balance and its effect on color
▶ Investigating other color options
T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied 
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s 
true — this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s 
not much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make 
out whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to focus 
than simply getting a sharp image of a subject. You also 
need to consider depth of field, or the distance over 
which objects remain sharply focused. This chapter 
explains all the ways to control depth of field as well 
as how to use your D3000’s advanced focus options.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of 
color, explaining your camera’s white balance con-
trol, which compensates for the varying color casts 
created by different light sources. You also can get 
my take on the other advanced color options on your 
D3000, including the Color Space option and Picture 
Controls, in this chapter.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re 
not reading this book from front to back, here’s a recap of the basic process 
of focusing with your D3000.
 
1. Set the focusing switch on the lens to manual or automatic focusing.
 
 If you want to focus manually, set the switch 
to the M position; for autofocusing, set it to 
the A position, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
 These directions are specific to the kit lens 
sold with the D3000. Other lenses may have 
a different sort of switch or no switch at all, 
so check the product manual. And note that 
not all lenses provide autofocusing when 
paired with the D3000. For manual focusing, 
be sure to set the Focus mode to MF (manual 
focus), as explained in the upcoming section 
“Changing the Focus mode setting.” With the 
kit lens and some other lenses, the camera 
takes care of that step automatically for you.
 
2. Frame the picture so that your subject falls 
under one of the 11 autofocus points.
 
 The autofocus points are represented by the 
little black squares in the viewfinder. For most exposure modes, all 11 
focus points are active by default and can be used for autofocusing.
 
 Note, however, that when you set the lens to manual focusing or set 
the Mode dial to the Landscape or Close Up mode, only a single point is 
active at the default settings. It appears surrounded by black brackets. 
Use the Multi Selector to move the brackets over the point on which you 
want to focus. In Sports mode, you start by selecting the point you want 
to use as well, but the camera may choose a different point if your sub-
ject moves.
 
3. To set focus in autofocus mode, press and hold the shutter button half-
way down.
 
 Depending on the lighting conditions, the AF-assist illuminator on the 
front of the camera may emit a beam to help the autofocus system find 
its target. (If the light becomes a distraction, you can disable it through 
the AF-assist option on the Shooting menu. But the camera may have 
trouble locking focus, so you may need to focus manually.)
 
 When focus is established, the focus lamp in the viewfinder lights. If a 
single focus point was selected in the preceding step, it briefly flashes 
red and then appears black again. If all focus points were active, one or

set the switch to A to use 
autofocusing.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
more of the focus points flashes 
and then appears surrounded by 
brackets, as shown in Figure 6-2. 
Any objects that fall under those 
points are in focus.
 
 The part of the frame the camera 
uses to establish focus depends 
on the current AF-area mode. To 
find out more about this issue, 
including how to select the focus 
point you want to use, check out 
the section “Adjusting Autofocus 
Performance.”
 
4. To set focus manually, twist the 
focusing ring on the lens.
 
 Don’t forget! First set the lens 
switch to the manual focusing position, or you may damage the lens.
 
 If you press the shutter button halfway to activate the viewfinder display 
before moving the focusing ring, the focus lamp lights when you achieve 
focus. This feedback is based upon the focus point you selected in Step 
2. See the next section for help with another manual-focusing tool, the 
rangefinder.
By default, if you use autofocusing and the camera senses your subject moving 
before you take the shot, it tries to adjust focus as needed to keep the subject 
in focus. When this adjustment is made, the focus lamp in the viewfinder may 
go off and on again. In the P, S, A, and M exposure modes, you can control this 
behavior through the Focus mode setting, also explained later in this chapter.
Taking Advantage of Manual-Focusing Aids
Today’s autofocusing systems are pretty remarkable. As long as you follow 
the suggested techniques for autofocusing and use the right settings for the 
situation, you can expect a nice, sharply focused subject.
However, some subjects baffle even the most capable autofocus system: 
objects behind fences, highly reflective objects, dimly lit subjects, and scenes 
in which very little contrast exists between the subject and background. And 
of course, if the lens you use on your D3000 doesn’t offer an autofocus motor, 
you must focus manually. 
 
Manual focus doesn’t mean that you don’t get some focusing assistance from 
the camera, however. First, even in manual focus mode, you get the benefit of 
the focus-indicator lamp, as shown in the preceding section. 
Selected focus points
Figure 6-2: The brackets indicate points used 
to achieve focus.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Additionally, through your camera’s Rangefinder option, you can swap out 
the exposure meter in the viewfinder with a rangefinder, which uses a similar, 
meter-like display to gauge focus. Here’s how it works: You take the same 
manual focusing approach as described in the preceding section, using the 
Multi Selector to select a focus point and then dialing in focus by twisting 
the focusing ring on the lens. When you press the shutter button halfway, 
the rangefinder display indicates whether focus is set on the object in the 
selected focus point.
 
If bars appear to the left of the 0, as shown in the left example in Figure 6-3, 
focus is set in front of the subject; if the bars are to the right, as in the middle 
example, focus is slightly behind the subject. The more bars you see, the 
greater the focusing error. As you twist the focusing ring, the rangefinder 
updates to help you get focus on track. When you see a single bar on either 
side of the 0, you’re good to go.
Focus front of subject
Focus behind subject
Unable to focus
Figure 6-3: The rangefinder offers manual-focusing assistance.
Before I tell you how to activate this feature, I want to point out a couple of 
issues:
 
✓ You can use the rangefinder in any exposure mode except M. In Manual 
mode, the viewfinder always displays the exposure meter.
 
✓ Your lens must offer a maximum aperture (f-stop number) of f/5.6 or 
lower. To understand f-stops, head back to Chapter 5. The kit lens sold 
with the D3000 meets this qualification.
 
✓ With subjects that confuse the camera’s autofocus system, the range-
finder may not work well either; it’s based on the same system. If the 
system can’t find the focusing target, you see the rangefinder display 
shown on the right in Figure 6-3.
If none of those caveats concern you, you can enable the rangefinder dis-
play via the Setup menu. Choose Viewfinder Options, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-4, then press OK to access the Rangefinder option. Set the option to 
On to enable the rangefinder.
 
After you turn the rangefinder on, it replaces the exposure meter in the view-
finder when you switch to manual focusing, assuming that you set the Mode 
dial to any exposure-mode setting but M. Again, you don’t have the option to 
replace the exposure meter with the rangefinder in M exposure mode. 

161
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-4: Turn the rangefinder on via the Viewfinder Options setting on the Setup menu.
Do you need to worry about not having the exposure meter in the other 
modes? Well, the meter still appears in the Shooting Info display if the 
camera anticipates an exposure problem. So you can always check exposure 
in the Shooting Info display and then check focus through the rangefinder.
Still, I typically leave the rangefinder off and just rely on the focus indicator 
lamp and my eyes to verify focus. I shoot in the S and A exposure modes 
frequently, and I find it a pain to monitor exposure in the Shooting Info 
display rather than in the viewfinder. That’s not a recommendation to you 
either way — it’s just how I prefer to work. Whichever option you choose, 
though, remember to adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight, as explained in 
Chapter 1, so that you can make accurate judgments about focus.
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your camera’s focusing system: the AF-area 
mode and the Focus mode. The following sections fill in the details.
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related 
to the issues discussed in this chapter. Any 
movement of the camera or subject can also 
cause blur. Both of these problems are related 
to shutter speed, an exposure control that I 
cover in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 
7, which provides some additional tips for cap-
turing moving objects without blur.

162
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Understanding the AF-area mode setting
 
The AF-area mode option determines 
which of the 11 focusing points the 
camera uses to establish focus. (The 
AF in AF-area mode stands for autofo-
cus.) You can view the current setting 
on the Shooting Info display. In fact, 
the display contains two different 
icons representing the setting, as 
shown in Figure 6-5. The one in the 
lower-left corner is designed to give 
you a bit more information than the 
simplified version on the right side 
of the screen. More about what you 
can glean from that detailed icon 
momentarily.
You can choose from four settings, which work as described in the following 
list and are represented in the lower-left corner of the Shooting Info display 
by the margin icons shown here. (Flip ahead to Figures 6-6 and 6-7 to see the 
simplified icons, which appear both in the Quick Setting screens and menus.)
 
 
✓ Single Point: This mode is designed for shooting still subjects. You 
select one of the 11 focus points, and the camera sets focus on the 
object that falls within that point. (See the upcoming section “Selecting a 
single focus point” for specifics on how to designate your chosen point.) 
The camera uses this mode by default when you shoot in the Close Up 
and Landscape exposure modes.
 
 In the lower-left corner of the Shooting Info display, the position of the 
brackets in the AF-area mode icon show you which point is selected. For 
example, an icon like the one you see in the margin here tells you that 
the center point is selected.
 
 
✓ Dynamic Area: In this mode, designed for shooting moving subjects, 
you select an initial focus point, just as in Single Point mode. But if the 
subject within that focus point moves after you press the shutter button 
halfway to set focus, the camera looks for focus information from the 
other focus points. The idea is that the subject is likely to wind up 
within one of the 11 focus areas. Dynamic Area is the default setting 
when you shoot in the Sports exposure mode.
 
 However — and this is a biggie — in order for the automatic focus 
adjustment to occur, you also must set the Focus mode option 
(explained next) to either AF-A, the default setting, or AF-C. If you 
Figure 6-5: The symbol for the current AF-area 
mode appears here.

163
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
instead set that option to AF-S, which is designed for shooting still sub-
jects, the camera sticks with the initial focus point you select, even if the 
subject moves before you take the picture.
 
 In the lower-left corner of the Shooting Info display, the icon for this 
mode looks similar to the one in the margin here. Your selected focus 
point is surrounded by brackets, but you also see little plus signs mark-
ing the other points to indicate that they are ready to take over if your 
subject moves. Note that the brackets surrounding your selected focus 
point don’t move if the camera shifts to a different point to focus, but 
the focus shift is happening just the same.
 
AUTO  
✓ Auto Area: The camera analyzes the objects under all 11 autofocus 
points and selects the one it deems most appropriate. This mode is the 
default setting for the Portrait, Child, Night Portrait, Flash Off, and Auto 
modes as well as for all the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M). 
Notice that none of the focus points in the detailed icon are surrounded 
by brackets this time, indicating that any focus point may be used.
 
3D
 
✓ 3D Tracking: This one is a variation of Dynamic Area autofocusing — 
well, sort of. As with Dynamic Area mode, you start by selecting a single 
focus point and then press the shutter button halfway to set focus. But 
the goal of this mode is to maintain focus on your subject if you recom-
pose the shot after you press the shutter button halfway to lock focus.
 
 Again, you have to set the Focus mode to AF-A or AF-C for this focus 
adjustment to occur. In fact, the 3D Tracking option doesn’t even appear 
on the menus or Quick Settings display when the Focus mode is set 
to AF-S.
 
 The only problem with 3D Tracking is that the way the camera detects 
your subject is by analyzing the colors of the object under your selected 
focus point. So if not much difference exists between the subject and 
other objects in the frame, the camera can get fooled. And if your sub-
ject moves out of the frame, you must release the shutter button and 
reset focus by pressing it halfway again.
 
 The 3D Tracking display icon appears in the lower-left corner of the 
Shooting Info display as shown in the margin here. As with the Dynamic 
Area mode, the brackets indicate the focus area you initially select.
 
If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all of your autofocus options, Auto-area pro-
duces good results for most subjects. Personally, however, I rely on the first 
two modes because if the Auto mode makes the wrong focus assumptions, 
there’s no way to select a different focus point. So for still subjects, I stick 
with Single Point focus; for moving subjects, I go with Dynamic Area.
Whatever your conclusions on the subject, the next two sections show you 
how to adjust the AF-area mode and select a specific focus point. 

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Changing the AF-area mode setting
 
i  You can control the AF-area mode setting in any of your camera’s exposure 
modes. The fastest way is to use the Quick Settings display. To get there, 
press the Info button and then the Zoom In button — or just press the Zoom 
In button twice. Then highlight the AF-area mode icon, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-6. Press OK to access the second screen in the figure, where you see 
the simplified versions of the icons representing the different mode options. 
From top to bottom, the settings are Single Point, Dynamic Area, Auto Area, 
and 3D-Tracking.
Single Point
Dynamic Area
Auto Area
3D-Tracking
Figure 6-6: The fastest way to adjust the AF-area mode is through the Quick Settings screen.
 
Don’t see the 3D Tracking option on your screen? That happens if the Focus 
mode is set to AF-S. So if you want to use 3D Tracking, set the Focus mode to 
AF-C or AF-A — the setting is located directly above the AF-area mode option 
in the Quick Settings display. Refer to the upcoming section “Changing the 
Focus mode setting” for more information about this aspect of the focusing 
system.
You also can change the AF-area mode through the Shooting menu, as shown 
in Figure 6-7, if you find it easier. The one advantage of going through the 
menus is that the option names are spelled out — you don’t have to remem-
ber what all the icons represent.

165
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-7: You also can adjust the setting through the Shooting menu.
Selecting a single focus point
In any AF-area mode except Auto-area, you can specify which focus point you 
want the camera to use. Remember, though, that for Dynamic Area and 3D 
Tracking, focus is initially set on your chosen point but if your subject moves 
or you reframe the shot, the camera may automatically shift to a different 
focus point.
 
If you are focusing manually, selecting a focus point isn’t absolutely neces-
sary. However, the feedback you get from the focus lamp in the viewfinder is 
based on the selected focus point — the lamp lights when the area inside the 
selected focus point comes into focus. So if you want that feedback to be reli-
able, you need to set the focus point.
Take these steps to select a focus 
point:
 
1. Press the shutter button halfway 
and release it to engage the 
exposure meters.
 
2. Use the Multi Selector to select a 
focus point.
 
 The currently selected point 
is surrounded by brackets, as 
shown in Figure 6-8.
 
To quickly select the center focus 
point, press OK. No need to cycle your 
way through all the other focus points 
to get to the center.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Changing the Focus mode setting
 
Throughout this book, I use the term focusing mode generically to refer 
to the lens switch that shifts your camera from autofocusing to manual 
focusing — at least, on the kit lens sold with the D3000. But there is also an 
official Focus mode setting, which controls another aspect of your camera’s 
focusing behavior. There are four options, which work as follows:
 
✓ AF-S (single-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is geared to shooting 
stationary subjects, the camera locks focus when you depress the shut-
ter button halfway.
 
 Use this mode if you want to frame your subject so that it doesn’t fall 
under an autofocus point: Compose the scene initially to put the subject 
under a focus point, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, and 
then reframe to the composition you have in mind. As long as you keep 
the button pressed halfway, focus remains set on your subject. 
 
✓ AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is designed for 
moving subjects, the camera focuses continuously for the entire time 
you hold the shutter button halfway down.
 
 If your subject moves before you take the picture, reframe the shot to 
keep the subject under the selected focus point when you combine this 
mode with the Single Point AF-area mode. In the other AF-area modes, 
the camera should track focus as long as the subject stays within one of 
the 11 focus points. 
 
 If you want to lock focus at a certain distance, you must press the AE-L/
AF-L button, as described in the section, “Using autofocus lock,” later in 
this chapter.
 
✓ AF-A (auto-servo autofocus): This mode is the default setting. The 
camera analyzes the scene and, if it detects motion, automatically 
selects continuous-servo mode (AF-C). If the camera instead believes 
you’re shooting a stationary object, it selects single-servo mode (AF-S). 
This mode works pretty well, but it can get confused sometimes. For 
example, if your subject is motionless but other people are moving 
in the background, the camera may mistakenly switch to continuous 
autofocus. By the same token, if the subject is moving only slightly, the 
camera may not make the switch.
 
✓ MF (manual focus): If you use a lens that does not offer an external 
switch to shift from auto to manual focus, you need to select this set-
ting to focus manually. You also need to choose this setting if your lens 
doesn’t offer an autofocus motor at all. On the kit lens featured in this 
book, simply setting the switch on the lens to M automatically sets the 

167
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Focus mode to MF. However, the opposite isn’t true: Choosing the MF 
setting for the Focus mode does not free the focusing ring so that you 
can set focus manually; you must set the lens switch to the M position.
 
You can choose from all four settings only in the P, S, A, and M exposure 
modes. In the other modes, you can choose between AF-A and MF only.
Assuming that you are using a mode that allows full control, which Focus 
mode should you select? As for the autofocus options, single-servo mode 
(AF-S) works best for shooting still subjects, and continuous-servo (AF-C) is 
the right choice for moving subjects. But frankly, auto-servo (AF-A), which is 
the default setting, does a good job in most cases of making that shift for you. 
So, in my mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting unless you’re 
having trouble getting the camera to lock onto your subject.
At any rate, you can change the Focus mode in two ways:
 
i  
✓ Quick Settings display: Press the Zoom In button twice, once to bring 
up the Shooting Info screen and a second time to shift to Quick Settings 
mode. (You can also press the Info button and then the Zoom In button.) 
Then use the Multi Selector to navigate to the Focus mode setting, as 
shown on the left in Figure 6-9. Press OK to display the Focus mode 
options shown on the right. Choose the desired mode and press OK. 
 
✓ Shooting menu: Scroll to the second screen of the Shooting menu to 
find the Focus mode option, as shown in Figure 6-10.
Figure 6-9: The Focus mode determines whether the autofocusing system locks focus when 
you press the shutter button halfway.

168
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-10: You can set the Focus mode through the Shooting menu as well as through the 
Quick Settings display.
Choosing the right autofocus combo
 
You’ll get the best autofocus results if you pair your chosen Focus mode 
with the most appropriate AF-area mode, because the two settings work in 
tandem. Here are the combinations that I suggest for the maximum autofocus 
control:
 
✓ For still subjects, use Single Point as the AF-area mode and AF-S as 
the Focus mode. You then select a specific focus point, and the camera 
locks focus on that point at the time you press the shutter button half-
way. Focus remains locked on your subject even if you reframe the shot 
after you press the button halfway. (It helps to remember the s factor: 
For still subjects, Single Point and AF-S.)
 
✓ For moving subjects, set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area and the 
Focus mode to AF-C. You still begin by selecting a focus point, but the 
camera adjusts focus as needed if your subject moves within the frame 
after you press the shutter button halfway to establish focus. (Think 
motion, dynamic, continuous.) Remember to reframe as needed to keep 
your subject within the boundaries of the 11 autofocus points, though.
Again, though, you get full control over the Focus mode only in the P, S, A, 
and M exposure modes. In the other modes, you have only two choices — 
either MF (manual focus) or AF-A.
Using autofocus lock
When you set your camera’s Focus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofo-
cus), pressing and holding the shutter button halfway initiates autofocus. But 
focusing is continually adjusted while you hold the shutter button halfway, 

169
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
so the focusing distance may change if the subject moves out of the active 
autofocus point or you reframe the shot before you take the picture. The 
same is true if you use AF-A mode (auto-servo autofocus) and the camera 
senses movement in front of the lens, in which case it shifts to AF-C mode 
and operates as I just described. Either way, the upshot is that you can’t con-
trol the exact focusing distance the camera ultimately uses.
Should you want to lock focus at a specific distance, you have a couple of 
options:
 
✓ Focus manually. 
 
✓ Change the Focus mode to AF-S (single-servo autofocus). In this mode, 
focus is locked when you press and hold the shutter button halfway.
 
 
✓ Lock focus with the AE-L/AF-L button. First set focus by pressing the 
shutter button halfway. When the focus is established at the distance 
you want, press and hold the AE-L/AF-L button, located near the view-
finder. Focus remains set as long as you hold the button down, even if 
you release the shutter button.
 
 Keep in mind, though, that by default, pressing the AE-L/AF-L button 
also locks in autoexposure. (Chapter 5 explains.) You can change this 
behavior, however, setting the button to lock just one or the other. 
Chapter 11 explains this option as well as a couple other ways to cus-
tomize the button’s function.
 
For my money, manual focusing is by far the easiest solution. Yes, it may take 
you a little while to get comfortable with manual focusing, but in the long 
run, you really save yourself a lot of time fiddling with the various autofocus 
settings, remembering which button initiates the focus lock, and so on. Just 
be sure that you have adjusted the viewfinder diopter to your eyesight, as 
explained in Chapter 1, so that there’s not a disconnect between what you 
see in the viewfinder and where the camera is actually focusing. After a little 
practice, focusing manually will become second nature to you. 
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps 
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to 
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer 
home the lesson:
 
✓ Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph 
appear sharply focused.

170
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ With a shallow, or small, depth of field, distant objects appear more 
softly focused than the main subject (assuming that you set focus on the 
main subject, of course).
 
✓ With a large depth of field, the zone of sharp focus extends to include 
objects at a distance from your 
subject.
Which arrangement works best 
depends entirely on your creative 
vision and your subject. In portraits, 
for example, a classic technique is 
to use a shallow depth of field, as 
shown in the photo in Figure 6-11. 
This approach increases emphasis 
on the subject while diminishing the 
impact of the background. But for 
the photo in Figure 6-12, I wanted 
to emphasize that the foreground 
figures were in St. Peter’s Square, at 
the Vatican, so I used a large depth 
of field, which kept the background 
buildings sharply focused and gave 
them equal weight in the scene.
So exactly how do you adjust depth 
of field? You have three points 
of control: aperture, focal length, 
and camera-to-subject distance, as 
spelled out in the following list:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): The 
aperture is one of three expo-
sure settings, all explained fully 
in Chapter 5. Depth of field 
increases as you stop down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop 
number). For shallow depth of field, open the aperture (by choosing a 
lower f-stop number). Figure 6-13 offers an example; in the f/22 version, 
focus is sharp all the way through the frame; in the f/13 version, focus 
softens as the distance from the center lure increases. I snapped both 
images using the same focal length and camera-to-subject distance, set-
ting focus on the center lure.
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 90mm
Figure 6-11: A shallow depth of field blurs the 
background and draws added attention to the 
subject.

171
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay 
terms, focal length deter-
mines what the lens “sees.” 
As you increase focal length, 
measured in millimeters, 
the angle of view narrows, 
objects appear larger in the 
frame, and — the important 
point for this discussion — 
depth of field decreases. 
Additionally, the spatial rela-
tionship of objects changes 
as you adjust focal length. 
As an example, Figure 6-14 
compares the same scene 
shot at a focal length of 
127mm and 183mm. I used 
the same aperture, f/5.6, for 
both examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal 
length flexibility depends 
on your lens: If you have a 
zoom lens, you can adjust 
the focal length — just 
zoom in or out. (The D3000 
kit lens, for example, offers 
a focal-length range of 
18–55mm.) If you don’t have 
a zoom lens, the focal length 
is fixed, so scratch this means 
of manipulating depth of field.
 
 For more technical details about focal length and your D3000, see the 
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
Aperture, f/14; Focal length, 42mm

foreground and background subjects in focus.

Figure 6-13: A lower f-stop number (wider aperture) decreases depth of field.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-15 
and summed up in the following list:
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum focal 
length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.

173
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop number, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 127mm
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 183mm
Figure 6-14: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
Just to avoid a possible point of confusion that has arisen in some of the 
classes I teach: When I say zoom in, some students think that I mean to twist 
the zoom barrel so that it moves in toward the camera body. But in fact, the 
phrase zoom in means to zoom to a longer focal length, which produces the 
visual effect of bringing your subject closer. This requires twisting the zoom 
barrel of the lens so that it extends further out from the camera. And the 

174
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
phrase zoom out refers to the opposite maneuver: I’m talking about widening 
your view of the subject by zooming to a shorter focal length, which requires 
moving the lens barrel in toward the camera body.
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
Figure 6-15: Your f-stop, focal length, and shooting distance determine depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) enables you to easily con-
trol depth of field. In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the 
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce 
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends 
on your lens.
 
 Even in aperture-priority mode, keep an eye on shutter speed as well. To 
maintain the same exposure, shutter speed must change in tandem with 
aperture, and you may encounter a situation where the shutter speed 
is too slow to permit hand-holding of the camera. Lenses that offer 
optical image stabilization, or vibration reduction (VR lenses, in the 
Nikon world), do enable most people to use a slower shutter speed than 
normal, but double-check your results just to be sure. Or use a tripod for 
extra security. Of course, all this assumes that you have dialed in a spe-
cific ISO Sensitivity setting; if you instead are using Auto ISO adjustment, 
the camera may adjust the ISO setting instead of shutter speed. (Chapter 
5 explores the whole aperture/shutter speed/ISO relationship.)

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal 
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range of 
focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters, 
focal length determines the camera’s angle of 
view, the apparent size and distance of objects 
in the scene, and depth of field. According to 
photography tradition, a focal length of 50mm is 
described as a “normal” lens. Most point-and-
shoot cameras feature this focal length, which 
is a medium-range lens that works well for the 
type of snapshots that users of those kinds of 
cameras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is char-
acterized as a wide-angle lens because at 
that focal length, the camera has a wide angle 
of view and produces a large depth of field, 
making it good for landscape photography. A 
short focal length also has the effect of making 
objects seem smaller and farther away. At the 
other end of the spectrum, a lens with a focal 
length longer than 80mm is considered a tele-
photo lens and often referred to as a long lens. 
With a long lens, angle of view narrows, depth 
of field decreases, and faraway subjects appear 
closer and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and 
sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated 
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called 
35mm equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal: 
For reasons that aren’t really important, when 
you put a standard lens on most digital cam-
eras, including your D3000, the available frame 
area is reduced, as if you took a picture on a 
camera that uses 35mm film negatives (the kind 
you’ve probably been using for years) and then 
cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also 
called the magnification factor, varies depend-
ing on the digital camera, which is why the 
photo industry adopted the 35mm-equivalent 
measuring stick as a standard. With the D3000, 
the cropping factor is roughly 1.5. So the 
18–55mm kit lens, for example, actually cap-
tures the approximate area you would get from 
a 27–83mm lens on a 35mm film camera. In the 
figure here, for example, the red outline indi-
cates the image area that results from the 1.5 
crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a 
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of 
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when 
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal 
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is 
required.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Portrait and Close Up modes are designed to produce shallow depth 
of field; Landscape mode is designed for large depth of field. You can’t 
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the set-
ting the camera chooses. In addition, the extent to which the camera can 
select an appropriate f-stop depends on the lighting conditions. If you’re 
shooting in Landscape mode at dusk, for example, the camera may have 
to open the aperture to a wide setting to produce a good exposure.
 
✓ For greater background blurring, move the subject farther from the 
background. The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust 
depth of field also is affected by the distance between the subject and 
the background. For increased background blurring, move the subject 
farther in front of the background.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — 
resolution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making 
sense of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems 
aren’t all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with 
a quick shift of your D3000’s white balance control. And getting a grip on 
color requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs 
for an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control, 
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your 
camera renders colors. For information on how to use the Retouch menu’s 
color options to alter colors of existing pictures, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluores-
cent lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-
greenish light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms 
always look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially 
attractive by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a 
warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering to the skin.
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, officially known as color tempera-
ture, on the Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. You can see the 
Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16.
When photographers talk about “warm light” and “cool light,” though, they 
aren’t referring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least not in the 
way we usually think of temperatures, with a higher number meaning hotter. 

177
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Instead, the terms describe the visual appear-
ance of the light. Warm light, produced by 
candles and incandescent lights, falls in the 
red-yellow spectrum you see at the bottom of 
the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16; cool light, in the 
blue-green spectrum, appears at the top of the 
Kelvin scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these 
fluctuating colors of light because our eyes 
automatically compensate for them. Except 
in very extreme lighting conditions, a white 
tablecloth appears white to us no matter 
whether we view it by candlelight, fluorescent 
light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for 
different colors of light through a feature 
known as white balancing. Simply put, white 
balancing neutralizes light so that whites are 
always white, which in turn ensures that other 
colors are rendered accurately. If the camera 
senses warm light, it shifts colors slightly to the cool side of the color 
spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Auto white balance 
setting tackles this process remarkably well in most situations, which means 
that you can usually ignore it and concentrate on other aspects of your pic-
ture. But if your scene is lit by two or more light sources that cast different 
colors, the white balance sensor can get confused, producing an unwanted 
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-17.
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a 
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce 
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent 
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty 
strong daylight to filter through. In Auto white balance mode, the camera 
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too 
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just 
switched the white balance mode from Auto to the Incandescent setting. The 
right image in Figure 6-17 shows the corrected colors.
 
There’s one little problem with white balancing as it’s implemented on your 
D3000, though. You can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection 
if you shoot in the fully automatic exposure modes. So if you spy color prob-
lems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either P, S, A, or M expo-
sure mode. (Chapter 5 details all four modes.)

options.
Changing the white 
balance setting
The current white balance setting 
appears in the Shooting Info, as shown 
in Figure 6-18. The manual settings are 
represented by the icons you see in 
Table 6-1.

To change the white balance, one option is to use the Quick Settings screen, 
as shown in Figure 6-19. Remember, you can get to this screen by pressing 
the Zoom In button (shown in the margin here) twice. After highlighting the 
White Balance option, press OK to display the menu shown on the right of 
Figure 6-19, highlight the desired setting, and press OK.
Figure 6-19: You can modify White Balance through the Quick Settings display.
You also can adjust the White Balance setting through the Shooting menu, 
as shown in Figure 6-20. However, things work a little differently when you 
go through the menu. If you choose any setting but Fluorescent, pressing OK 

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
takes you to a screen where you can fine-tune the setting, a process I explain 
in the next section. If you don’t want to make any further adjustment, just 
press OK to exit the fine-tuning screen and return to the Shooting menu.
Figure 6-20: To uncover additional White Balance options, hit the Shooting menu.
 
When choose the Fluorescent setting from the menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-21, pressing OK displays the second screen in the figure, where you 
can select a specific type of bulb. Select the option that most closely matches 
your bulbs and then press OK. You then go to the fine-tuning screen. Again, 
just press OK if you don’t want to tweak the setting. 
Figure 6-21: If you adjust White Balance through the Shooting menu, you can select a specific 
type of fluorescent bulb.
 
After you select a fluorescent bulb type, that option is always used when you 
change white balance through the Shooting Info display (as outlined previ-
ously) and choose the Fluorescent white balance setting. Again, you can 
change the bulb type only through the Shooting menu.

181
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Selecting the PRE option on the menu list of White Balance options enables 
you to create and store a precise, customized white balance setting, as 
explained in the upcoming “Creating white balance presets” section. This 
setting is the fastest way to achieve accurate colors when your scene is lit by 
multiple light sources that have differing color temperatures. 
 
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes until you change it. So you may want to get in the habit of 
resetting the option to the Auto setting after you finish shooting whatever 
subject it was that caused you to switch to manual white balance mode.
Fine-tuning white balance settings
You can fine-tune any white balance setting (Direct Sunlight, Cloudy, and so 
on) except a custom preset that you create through the PRE option. Make the 
adjustment as spelled out in these steps: 
 
1. Display the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
2. Highlight the white balance setting you want to adjust, as shown on 
the left in Figure 6-22, and press OK.
 
 Now you’re taken to a screen where you can do your fine-tuning, as 
shown on the right in Figure 6-22.
 
 If you select Fluorescent, you first go to a screen where you select a spe-
cific type of bulb, as covered in the preceding section. After you high-
light your choice, press OK to get to the fine-tuning screen. 
Shift marker
Figure 6-22: You can fine-tune the white balance settings via the Shooting menu.

182
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
3. Fine-tune the setting by using the Multi Selector to move the white bal-
ance shift marker in the color grid.
 
 The grid is set up around two color pairs: Green and Magenta, repre-
sented by G and M; and Blue and Amber, represented by B and A. By 
pressing the Multi Selector, you can move the adjustment marker — that 
little black box labeled in Figure 6-22 — around the grid. 
 
 As you move the marker, the A–B and G–M boxes on the right side of 
the screen show you the current amount of color shift. A value of 0 indi-
cates the default amount of color compensation applied by the selected 
white balance setting. In Figure 6-22, for example, I moved the marker 
two levels toward amber and two levels toward magenta to specify that I 
wanted colors to be a tad warmer.
 
 If you’re familiar with traditional colored lens filters, you may know that 
the density of a filter, which determines the degree of color correction 
it provides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The white 
balance grid is designed around 
this system: Moving the marker 
one level is the equivalent of 
adding a filter with a density 
of 5 mireds.
 
4. Press OK to complete the 
adjustment.
After you adjust a white balance set-
ting, an asterisk appears next to the 
icon representing the setting on the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 
6-23. You see an asterisk next to the 
White Balance setting in the Shooting 
Info display as well.
Creating white balance presets
 
If none of the standard white balance settings do the trick and you don’t want 
to fool with fine-tuning them, take advantage of the PRE (Preset Manual) fea-
ture. This option enables you to do two things:
 
✓ Base white balance on a direct measurement of the actual lighting 
conditions.
 
✓ Match white balance to an existing photo. 
The next two sections provide you with the step-by-step instructions.
Figure 6-23: The asterisk indicates that you 
applied a fine-tuning adjustment to the White 
Balance setting.

183
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Setting white balance with direct measurement
To use this technique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral 
gray or absolute white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-
but-not-perfect white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this pur-
pose in many camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 If the exposure meter reports that your image will be under- or over-
exposed at the current exposure settings, make the necessary adjust-
ments now. (Chapter 5 tells you how.) Otherwise, the camera won’t be 
able to create your custom white balance preset.
 
2. Frame your shot so that the reference card completely fills the 
viewfinder.
 
3. From the Shooting menu, select White Balance, press OK, and select 
the PRE (Preset Manual) white balance setting, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-24. 
 
4. Press the Multi Selector right, select Measure, as shown on the right in 
the figure, and press OK.
 
 A warning appears, asking you if you want to overwrite existing data.
 
5. Select Yes and press OK.
 
 You see another message, this time telling you to take your picture. 
You’ve got about six seconds to do so. (The letters PRE flash in the view-
finder and Shooting Info display to let you know the camera’s ready to 
record your white balance reference image.)
Figure 6-24: Select these options to set white balance by measuring a white or gray card.

184
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 If the camera is successful at recording the white balance data, the 
letters Gd flash in the viewfinder and the message “Data Acquired” 
appears in the Shooting Information display. If the camera couldn’t set 
the custom white balance, you instead see the message No Gd in the 
viewfinder, and a message in the Shooting Information display urges you 
to try again. Try adjusting your 
lighting before doing so.
After you complete the process, the 
camera automatically sets the White 
Balance option to PRE so you can 
begin using your preset. You see the 
letters PRE in the White Balance area 
of the Shooting Info display, as shown 
in Figure 6-25.
 
Any time you want to select and use 
the preset, switch to the PRE white 
balance setting. Your custom setting 
is stored in the camera until you over-
ride it with a new preset.
Matching white balance to an existing photo
Suppose that you’re the marketing manager for a small business, and one of 
your jobs is to shoot portraits of the company big-wigs for the annual report. 
You build a small studio just for that purpose, complete with a couple of pho-
tography lights and a nice, conservative beige backdrop.
Of course, the big-wigs can’t all come to get their pictures taken in the same 
month, let alone on the same day. But you have to make sure that the colors 
in that beige backdrop remain consistent for each shot, no matter how much 
time passes between photo sessions. This scenario is one possible use for an 
advanced white balance feature that enables you to base white balance on an 
existing photo.
 
Basing white balance on an existing photo works well only in strictly con-
trolled lighting situations, where the color temperature of your lights is con-
sistent from day to day. Otherwise, the white balance setting that produces 
color accuracy when you shoot Big Boss Number One may add an ugly color 
cast to the one you snap of Big Boss Number Two.
To give this option a try, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the picture that you want to use as the reference photo to your 
camera memory card, if it isn’t already stored there.
Figure 6-25: Select the PRE (Preset Manual) 
option to use your custom white balance 
setting.

185
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 You can copy the picture to the card using a card reader and whatever 
method you usually use to transfer files from one drive to another. 
Assuming that you’re using the default folder names, copy the file to 
the folder named 100D3000, inside the main folder, named DCIM. (See 
Chapter 8 for help with working with files and folders.)
 
2. Open the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
3. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 The screen shown on the left in Figure 6-26 appears.
Figure 6-26: You can create a white balance preset based on an existing photo.
 
4. Highlight Use Photo and press OK.
 
 The options shown on the right in Figure 6-26 appear. If you haven’t yet 
used the photo option to store a preset, you see an empty white box 
in the middle of the screen, as shown in the figure. If you previously 
selected a photo to use as a preset reference, the thumbnail for that 
image appears instead.
 
5. Select the photo you want to use as your reference image.
 
 If the photo you want to use is already displayed on the screen, highlight 
This Image and press OK. Otherwise, highlight Select Image and then 
press the Multi Selector right to access screens that let you navigate 
to the photo you want to use as a basis for white balance. Press OK to 
return to the screen shown on the right in Figure 6-26. Your selected 
photo appears on the screen.
 
6. Press OK to set the preset white balance based on the selected photo.
Whenever you want to base white balance on your selected photo, just set 
the White Balance setting to the PRE option.

186
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
By default, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the 
digital color world.) The sRGB color mode was created to help ensure color 
consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor and 
printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these devices 
can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-27 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
Figure 6-27: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
sRGB spectrum.

187
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Some colors in the Adobe RGB spectrum cannot be reproduced in print. (The 
printer just substitutes the closest printable color, if necessary.) Still, I usu-
ally shoot in Adobe RGB mode because I see no reason to limit myself to a 
smaller spectrum from the get-go.
However, just because I use Adobe RGB doesn’t mean that it’s right for you. 
First, if you plan to print and share your photos without making any adjust-
ments in your photo editor, you’re usually better off sticking with sRGB, 
because most printers and Web browsers are designed around that color 
space. Second, know that in order to retain all your original Adobe RGB 
colors when you work with your photos, your editing software must support 
that color space — not all programs do. You also must be willing to study the 
whole topic of digital color a little bit because you need to use some specific 
settings to avoid really mucking up the color works.
If you want to go with Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit the Shooting menu 
and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in Figure 6-28. 
Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure. Select Adobe 
RGB and press OK again.
Figure 6-28: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
 
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by 
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in 
_DSC0627.jpg. For pictures captured in the sRGB color space, the underscore 
appears in the middle of the filename, as in DSC_0627.jpg. See Chapter 4 for 
more tips on decoding picture filenames.

188
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Taking a Quick Look at Picture Controls
A feature that Nikon calls Picture Controls offers one more way to tweak image 
sharpening, color, and contrast when you shoot in the P, S, A, and M expo-
sure modes and choose one of the JPEG options for the Image Quality setting. 
(Chapter 3 explains the Image Quality setting.)
 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to 
a software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of 
slightly sharper focus. I emphasize, “slightly sharper focus.” Sharpening pro-
duces a subtle tweak, and it’s not a fix for poor focus.
An icon representing the current 
Picture Control appears in the 
Shooting Info screen, as shown in 
Figure 6-29. But you can’t adjust the 
setting through the Quick Settings 
display; instead, use the Shooting 
menu, as shown in Figure 6-30. 
Whichever route you go, you can 
choose from six Picture Controls, 
which are represented in the Shooting 
Info screen by two-letter codes and 
produce the following results:
 
✓ Standard (SD): The default 
setting for the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes, this option cap-
tures the image normally — that 
is, using the characteristics that 
Nikon offers up as suitable for the 
majority of subjects. You also are assigned this mode if you shoot in the 
Auto, No Flash, Sports, Child, and Close Up exposure modes.
 
✓ Neutral (NL): At this setting, the camera doesn’t enhance color, con-
trast, and sharpening as much as in the other modes. The setting is 
designed for people who want to precisely manipulate these picture 
characteristics in a photo editor. By not overworking colors, sharpen-
ing, and so on when producing your original file, the camera delivers an 
original that gives you more latitude in the digital darkroom.
 
✓ Vivid (VI): In this mode, the camera amps up color saturation, contrast, 
and sharpening.
Picture Control
Figure 6-29: Picture Controls apply preset 
adjustments to color, sharpening, and other 
photo characteristics to images you shoot in 
the JPEG file format. 

189
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-30: You can access the Picture Control options only through the Shooting menu.
 
✓ Monochrome (MC): This setting produces black-and-white photos. Only 
in the digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true black-
and-white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
 
 I’m not keen on creating grayscale images this way. I prefer to shoot in 
full color and then do my own grayscale conversion in my photo editor. 
That technique just gives you more control over the look of your black-
and-white photos. Assuming that you work with a decent photo editor, 
you can control what original tones are emphasized in your grayscale 
version, for example. Additionally, keep in mind that you can always 
convert a color image to grayscale, but you can’t go the other direction. 
You can create a black-and-white copy of your color image right in the 
camera, in fact; Chapter 10 shows you how.
 
✓ Portrait (PT): This mode tweaks colors and sharpening in a way that is 
designed to produce nice skin texture and pleasing skin tones. (If you 
shoot in the Portrait or Night Portrait automatic exposure modes, the 
camera selects this Picture Control for you.)
 
✓ Landscape (LS): This mode emphasizes blues and greens. As you might 
expect, it’s the mode used by the Landscape Scene mode.
The extent to which Picture Controls affect your image depends on the sub-
ject as well as the exposure settings you choose and the lighting conditions. 
But Figure 6-31 gives you a general idea of what to expect. As you can see, the 
differences between the various Picture Controls are pretty subtle, with the 
exception of the Monochrome option, of course.

Figure 6-31: Each Picture Control produces a slightly different take on the scene.
Personally, I think that the Standard Picture Control works just fine, and I 
rarely use the others. And frankly, I suggest that you do the same. First off, 
you’ve got way more important camera settings to worry about — aperture, 
shutter speed, autofocus, and all the rest. Why add one more setting to your 
list, especially when the impact of changing it is minimal?

191
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Second, if you really want to mess with the characteristics that the Picture 
Control options affect, you’re much better off shooting in the RAW (NEF) 
format and then making those adjustments on a picture-by-picture basis 
in your RAW converter. In Nikon ViewNX, you can even assign any of the 
existing Picture Controls to your RAW files and then compare how each one 
affects the image. The camera does tag your RAW file with whatever Picture 
Control is active at the time you take the shot, but the image adjustments are 
in no way set in stone, or even in sand — you can tweak your photo at will. 
(The selected Picture Control does affect the JPEG preview that’s used to 
display the RAW image thumbnails in ViewNX and other browsers.) 
For these reasons, I’m opting in this book to present you with just this brief 
introduction to Picture Controls so that I can go into more detail about func-
tions that I see as more useful (such as the white balance customization 
options presented earlier). But if you’re intrigued, know that you also can 
create your very own, customized Picture Controls. The camera manual 
walks you step by step through the process.

▶ Adjusting the camera for portrait photography
▶ Discovering the keys to super action shots
▶ Dialing in the right settings to capture landscapes and other scenic vistas
▶ Capturing close-up views of your subject
▶ Shooting through glass, capturing fireworks, and conquering other special challenges
E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your D3000, describing in detail how the various controls 
affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter pulls 
all that information together to help you set up your camera for 
specific types of photography.
The first section offers a quick summary of critical 
picture-taking settings that should serve you well no 
matter what your subject. Following that, I offer my 
advice on which settings to use for portraits, action 
shots, landscapes, and close-ups. To wrap things 
up, the end of the chapter includes some miscel-
laneous tips for dealing with special shooting situa-
tions and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as 
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or 
whatever. So feel free to wander off on your own, tweak-
ing this exposure setting or adjusting that focus control, to 
discover your own creative vision. Experimentation is part of 
the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera moni-
tor and the Delete button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which set-
tings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and 
shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But 
for many basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every 
shooting scenario. Table 7-1 shows you those recommendations and also 
lists the chapter where you can find details about each setting.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically 
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, land-
scapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along 
the way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, 
and for every so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the 
exception.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Shooting still portraits
By still portrait, I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who aren’t 
keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, pets, 
and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and use 
the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus. This artistic choice emphasizes the subject and helps 
diminish the impact of any distracting background objects in cases where 
you can’t control the setting. The following steps show you how to achieve 
this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) and select the 
lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which not 
only allows more light to enter the camera but also shortens depth of 
field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-stop value is the 
first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-stop range avail-
able to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind that the farther 
your subject is from the background, the more blurring you can achieve. 
 
 I recommend aperture-priority mode when depth of field is a primary 
concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the camera 
to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. Just 
rotate the Command dial to select your desired f-stop. (You do need 
to pay attention to shutter speed also, however, to make sure that it’s 
not so slow that any movement of the subject or camera will blur the 
image.)
 
 If you aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait 
and Child mode also result in a more open aperture, although the exact 
f-stop setting is out of your control. You should note, too, that both of 
those modes make subtle adjustments to color and sharpening that may 
or may not be what you have in mind. See Chapter 2 for details.
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current f-stop and 
shutter speed on the Shooting Info display and in the viewfinder, as 
shown in Figure 7-1. 
 
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.

196
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Shutter speed
Aperture
Figure 7-1: You can monitor aperture and shutter speed settings in two places.
 
 A lens with a focal length of 85–120mm is ideal for a classic head and 
shoulders portrait. But don’t fret if you have only the 18–55mm kit lens; 
just zoom in all the way to the 55mm setting. You should avoid using a 
much shorter focal length (a wider-angle lens) for portraits. They can 
cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how people look when 
you view them through a security peephole in a door.
 
3. For indoor portraits, shoot 
flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light 
rather than flash produces 
softer illumination and avoids 
the problem of red-eye. To get 
enough light to go flash-free, 
turn on room lights or, during 
daylight, pose your subject next 
to a sunny window, as I did for 
the image in Figure 7-2.
 
 In the A exposure mode, simply 
keeping the built-in flash unit 
closed disables the flash. In 
Portrait and Child modes, the 
camera automatically pops up 
the flash unit in dim lighting. 
To disable the flash, in those 
modes, the easiest option is to 
press the Flash button as you 
rotate the Command dial to 
select the Off setting. (You can 
view the current setting in the 
Shooting Information display.)
Figure 7-2: For more pleasing indoor portraits, 
shoot by available light instead of using flash.

197
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to 
get better results.
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash if possible.
 
 Even in daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’ faces, 
as illustrated in Figure 7-3. A flash is especially important when the back-
ground is brighter than the subjects, as in this example.
 
 In the A exposure mode, you can just press the Flash button on the side 
of the camera to enable the flash. For daytime portraits, use the fill flash 
setting. (That’s the regular, basic flash mode.) For nighttime images, try 
red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode; again, see the flash tips at the end 
of these steps to use either mode most effectively.
 
 Unfortunately, Portrait and Child mode use Auto flash, and if the ambi-
ent light is very bright, the flash may not fire. Switch to an advanced 
exposure mode (P, 
S, A, or M) to regain 
flash control. But do 
note that whatever 
exposure mode you 
use, the top shut-
ter speed available 
when you use flash 
with the D3000 is 
1/200 second, so in 
extremely bright 
light, you may need 
to stop down the 
aperture to avoid 
overexposing the 
photo. Doing so, of 
course, brings the 
background into 
sharper focus. So try 
to move the subject 
into a shaded area 
instead.
 
5. Press and hold 
the shutter button 
halfway to initiate 
exposure metering 
and autofocusing. 
 
 Make sure that an 
active autofocus 
point falls over your 
subject. Chapter 6 
explains more about 
No flash

portraits, use fill flash.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
autofocus, but if you have trouble, simply set your lens to manual focus 
mode and then twist the focusing ring to set focus. See Chapter 1 for 
help with manual focusing.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 
✓ Pay attention to the background. Scan the entire frame looking for 
intrusive objects that may distract the eye from the subject. If neces-
sary, reposition the subject against a more flattering backdrop. Inside, a 
softly textured wall works well; outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide 
nice backdrops as long as they aren’t so ornate or colorful that they 
diminish the subject (for example, a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and 
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to Auto, as I recom-
mend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm colors to 
compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also lit by room 
lights or sunlight, the result may be colors that are slightly warmer than 
neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in portraits, giving the 
skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the result or want even 
more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-tune white balance. 
Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, S, A, or M exposure modes.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambi-
ent light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the 
picture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reduc-
ing the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning, 
however.) As an added benefit, the smaller pupil allows more of the 
subject’s iris to be visible in the portrait, so you see more eye color.
 
• Try setting the flash to red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode. If you 
choose the first option, warn your subject to expect both a prelimi-
nary pop of light from the AF-assist lamp, which constricts pupils, 
and the actual flash. And remember that slow-sync flash uses a 
slower-than-normal shutter speed, which produces softer lighting 
and brighter backgrounds than normal flash. You can set the flash 
mode to slow-sync in A and P modes, and it’s the default flash set-
ting for Night Portrait mode as well.
 
 Take a look at Figure 7-4 for an example of how slow-sync flash 
can really improve an indoor portrait. When I used regular flash, 
the shutter speed was 1/60 second. At that speed, the camera has 

199
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
little time to soak up any ambient light. As a result, the scene is lit 
primarily by the flash. That caused two problems: The strong flash 
created some “hot spots” on the subject’s skin, and the window 
frame is much more prominent because of the contrast between it 
and the darker bushes outside the window. Although it was day-
light when I took the picture, the skies were overcast, so at 1/60 
second, the exterior appears dark.
 
 In the slow-sync example, shot at 1/4 second, the exposure time 
was long enough to permit the ambient light to brighten the exte-
riors to the point that the window frame almost blends into the 
background. And because much less flash power was needed to 
expose the subject, the lighting is much more flattering. In this 
case, the bright background also helps to set the subject apart 
because of her dark hair and shirt. If the subject had been a pale 
blonde, this setup wouldn’t have worked as well, of course. Again, 
too, note the warming effect that occurs when you use Auto White 
Balance and shoot in a combination of flash and daylight.
Regular fill flash, 1/60 second
Slow-sync flash, 1/4 second
Figure 7-4: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting and brighter backgrounds.

200
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 Any time you use slow-sync flash, don’t forget that a slower-than-
normal shutter speed means an increased risk of blur due to 
camera shake. So always use a tripod or otherwise steady the 
camera. And remind your subject to stay absolutely still, too, 
because they will appear blurry if they move during the exposure. I 
was fortunate to have both a tripod and a cooperative subject for 
my examples, but I probably wouldn’t try slow-sync for portraits of 
young children or pets.
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. 
An external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase 
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two por-
traits in Figure 7-5 for an illustration. In the first example, the 
built-in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and 
harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on the 
right, I used the Nikon Speedlight SB-600 and bounced the light off 
the ceiling. 
 
 One word of warning about bounce flash, though: Make sure that 
the ceiling or other surface you use to bounce the light is white. 
Otherwise, the flash light will pick up the color of the surface and 
influence the color of your subject.
Figure 7-5: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash 
and moved the subject farther from the background (right).

201
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from 
the background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure 
7-5. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also 
softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of 
field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
 
• Invest in a flash diffuser to further soften the light. Whether you use 
the built-in flash or an external flash, attaching a diffuser like the 
one shown in Figure 7-6 is also 
a good idea. This particular 
unit, made by LumiQuest 
(www.lumiquest.com), sells for 
under $15 and is easily tucked 
into even a small camera bag. 
This is just one of many diffuser 
designs, though, so visit your 
camera store to compare all 
your options.
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow 
for later cropping to a variety of 
frame sizes. Your D3000 produces 
images that have an aspect ratio of 
3:2. That means that your portrait 
perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size 
but will require cropping to print at 
any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 
or 8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about 
this issue.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s a flower in the breeze, a spinning Ferris wheel, or, as in 
the case of Figure 7-7, a racing cyclist. 
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, try the techniques 
in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
Figure 7-6: A diffuser produces softer, 
more flattering flash lighting.

202
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to S (shutter-
priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the 
shutter speed, and the camera 
takes care of choosing an aper-
ture setting that will produce a 
good exposure. 
 
 If you aren’t ready to step up 
to this advanced exposure 
mode, explained in Chapter 5, 
try using Sports mode, detailed 
in Chapter 2. But be aware that 
you have no control over many 
other aspects of your picture 
(such as white balance, flash, 
and so on) in that mode.
 
2. Rotate the Command dial to 
select the shutter speed.
 
 (Refer to Figure 7-1 to locate 
shutter speed in the viewfinder 
and Shooting Info display.) After 
you select the shutter speed, 
the camera selects an aperture 
(f-stop) to match.
 
 What shutter speed do you need exactly? Well, it depends on the speed 
at which your subject is moving, so some experimentation is needed. 
But generally speaking, 1/320 second should be plenty for all but the 
fastest subjects (race cars, boats, and so on). For very slow subjects, 
you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second. My subject in Figure 
7-7 was zipping along at a pretty fast pace, so I set the shutter speed to 
1/500 second just to be on the safe side.
 
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure, if 
needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure at a low ISO; 
the camera simply may not be able to open the aperture wide enough 
to accommodate a fast shutter speed. Raising the ISO does increase the 
possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a blurry shot. 
 
 Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the 
flash needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you 
want to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has 
Figure 7-7: Use a high shutter speed to freeze 
motion.

203
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
limited range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. 
And third, remember that the fastest shutter speed you can use with 
flash is 1/200 second, which may not be high enough to capture a 
quickly moving subject without blur. 
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode; it 
doesn’t permit you to use flash.
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Release mode to the Continuous setting.
 
 In this mode, you can capture multiple images with a single press of the 
shutter button. As long as you hold down the button, the camera contin-
ues to record images. Here again, though, you need to go flash-free; you 
can’t use the Continuous capture mode with flash because it isn’t com-
patible with flash photography.
 
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 Manual focusing eliminates the time the camera needs to lock focus in 
autofocus mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you 
need help.
 
 If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
 
• Set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area. 
 
• Set the Focus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus).
 
 Chapter 6 details these autofocus options. Note that in the fully auto-
matic exposure modes, however, you can choose from only two Focus 
modes, AF-A and MF (for manual focus). Fortunately, in AF-A mode, the 
camera automatically switches to continuous-servo autofocus when it 
senses movement in front of the lens.
 
6. Turn off Image Review.
 
 You turn off Image Review via the Playback menu. Turning the option 
off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover between 
shots. 
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 Frame your shot a little wider than you normally might so that you 
lessen the risk that your subject will move out of the frame before you 
record the image. You can always crop to a tighter composition later. 
(I used this approach for my cyclist image — the original shot includes 
a lot of background that I later cropped away.) It’s also a good idea to 
leave more room in front of the subject than behind it. This makes it 
obvious that your subject is going somewhere.

204
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any 
fast-moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shoot-
ing candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, 
leaping, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or 
change positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your 
eye, set your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots 
as fast as you can.
For example, one recent afternoon, I spotted my furball and his equally fluffy 
new neighbor introducing themselves to each other through the fence that 
separates their yards. I ran and grabbed my camera, flipped it into shutter-
priority mode, set the shutter speed to 1/320, and just started shooting. Most 
of the images were throwaways; you can see some of them in Figure 7-8. But 
somewhere around the tenth frame, I captured the moment you see in Figure 
7-9, which puts a whole new twist on the phrase “gossiping over the backyard 
fence.” Two seconds later, the dogs got bored with each other and scam-
pered away into their respective yards, but thanks to a fast shutter, I got the 
shot that I wanted.
Figure 7-8: I used speed-shooting techniques to capture this interaction between a pair of pups.

205
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-9: Although most of the shots were deletable, this one was a keeper.
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of 
countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for 
example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all build-
ings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to 
shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while 
the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) so that you can con-
trol depth of field. If you want extreme depth of field, so that both near 
and distant objects are sharply focused, as in Figure 7-10, select a high 
f-stop value. I used an aperture of f/18 for this shot. For short depth of 
field, use a low value. 

206
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 7-10: Use a high f-stop value (or Landscape mode) to keep foreground and background 
sharply focused.
 
 You can also use Landscape mode to achieve the first objective. In this 
mode, the camera automatically selects a high f-stop number, but you 
have no control over the exact value (or certain other picture-taking 
settings). And in dim lighting, the camera may be forced to select a low 
f-stop setting.
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow shutter, use a tripod to avoid blurring. 
The downside to a high f-stop is that you need a slower shutter speed 
to produce a good exposure. If the shutter speed drops below what 
you can comfortably hand-hold, use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring 
camera shake. Remember that when you use a tripod, Nikon recom-
mends that you turn Vibration Reduction off if you’re using the kit lens.
 
 No tripod handy? Look for any solid surface on which you can steady 
the camera. Of course, you can always increase the ISO Sensitivity set-
ting to allow a faster shutter, too, but that option brings with it the 
chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 5 for details.
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall shots, consider using a slow shutter to create 
that “misty” look. The slow shutter blurs the water, giving it a soft, 
romantic appearance, as shown in Figure 7-11. Again, use a tripod to 

207
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
ensure that the rest of the scene 
doesn’t also blur due to camera 
shake. You can also use a slow 
shutter speed to capture dramatic 
photographs of waves coming 
ashore.
 
 In very bright light, you may over-
expose the image at a very slow 
shutter, even if you stop the aper-
ture all the way down and select 
the camera’s lowest ISO setting. 
As a solution, consider investing 
in a neutral density filter for your 
lens. This type of filter works 
something like sunglasses for 
your camera: It simply reduces 
the amount of light that passes 
through the lens, without affect-
ing image colors, so that you can 
use a slower shutter than would 
otherwise be possible.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base expo-
sure on the sky. The foreground 
will be dark, but you can usually 
brighten it in a photo editor if 
needed. If you base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the 
sky will become so bright that all the color will be washed out — a prob-
lem you usually can’t fix after the fact.
 
 Also experiment with turning Active D-Lighting on and off. Chapter 5 
explains this feature, which brightens dark areas in a way that doesn’t 
blow out highlights, leaving your sky colors intact. 
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming 
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is 
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in 
Figure 7-12. Shutter speed for this image was about 10 seconds.
 
 Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try 
bulb mode. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode, this option 
records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter button. 
So just take a series of images, holding the button down for different 
lengths of time for each shot. In bulb mode, you also can exceed the 
standard maximum exposure time of 30 seconds.
Figure 7-11: For misty waterfalls, use a slow 
shutter speed and a tripod.

208
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot during the 
“magic hours.” That’s the term photo-
graphers use for early morning and late 
afternoon, when the light cast by the 
sun is soft and warm, giving everything 
that beautiful, gently warmed look.
 
 Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak 
your camera’s white balance setting, 
using the instructions laid out in 
Chapter 6, to simulate magic-hour light.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket exposures. 
Bracketing simply means to take the 
same picture at several different expo-
sure settings to increase the odds that 
at least one of them will capture the 
scene the way you envision. Bracketing 
is especially a good idea in difficult 
lighting situations such as sunrise and 
sunset. You need to use one of the 
advanced exposure modes to bracket 
with the D3000, though. In P, A, and S 
modes, use the Exposure Compensation 
feature, introduced in Chapter 5, to pro-
duce your series of brighter and darker 
images. In M mode, you can simply 
adjust the shutter speed or aperture 
setting between shots.
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, try these techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your lens. How “up close and personal” you can get to your 
subject depends on your lens, not the camera body itself. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of field by setting the camera mode to A 
(aperture-priority autoexposure) mode. Whether you want a shallow, 
medium, or extreme depth of field depends on the point of your photo. 
In classic nature photography, for example, the artistic tradition is a 
very shallow depth of field, as shown in Figure 7-13, and requires an 
open aperture (low f-stop value). But if you want the viewer to be able 
to clearly see all details throughout the frame — for example, if you’re 
shooting a product shot for your company’s sales catalog — you need to 
go the other direction, stopping down the aperture as far as possible.
Figure 7-12: A slow shutter also 
creates neon light trails in city-street 
scenes.

209
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 Not ready for the advanced 
exposure modes yet? Try Close 
Up mode instead. (It’s the one 
marked with the little flower on 
your Mode dial.) In this mode, 
the camera automatically opens 
the aperture to achieve a short 
depth of field and bases focus 
on the center of the frame. The 
range of apertures available to 
the camera depends on your 
lens and the lighting conditions.
 
✓ Remember that zooming in 
and getting close to your 
subject both decrease depth of 
field. So back to that product 
shot: If you need depth of field 
beyond what you can achieve 
with the aperture setting, you 
may need to back away, zoom 
out, or both. (You can always 
crop your image to show just 
the parts of the subject that you 
want to feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and 
other nature scenes outdoors, 
pay attention to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your 
subject to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. 
 
✓ Use flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny 
bit of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary 
light source. Again, though, keep in mind that the maximum shut-
ter speed possible when you use the built-in flash is 1/200 second. 
So in very bright light, you may need to use a high f-stop setting to 
avoid overexposing the picture. If you shoot in an advanced exposure 
mode (P, S, A, or M), you can also adjust the flash output via the Flash 
Compensation control. Chapter 5 offers details.
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light 
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your 
flash may be too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If 
flash is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce 
the flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can 
do in a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple 
light sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.) 
Using a flash diffuser like the one shown in Figure 7-6 also improves the 
odds of a good image.
Figure 7-13: Shallow depth of field is a classic 
technique for close-up floral images.

✓ To really get close to your 
subject, invest in a macro lens 
or a set of diopters. A true 
macro lens, which enables you 
to get really, really close to your 
subjects, is an expensive propo-
sition; expect to pay around 
$200 or more. But if you enjoy 
capturing the tiny details in life, 
it’s worth the investment. 
 
 For a less expensive way to 
go, you can spend about $40 
for a set of diopters, which are 
sort of like reading glasses that 
you screw onto your existing 
lens. Diopters come in several 
strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number 
indicating a greater magnifying 
power. I took this approach to 
capture the extreme close-up 
in Figure 7-14, attaching a +2 
diopter to my lens. The downfall 
of diopters, sadly, is that they 
typically produce images that 
are very soft around the edges, 
a problem that doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not 
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a quick 
list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, such 
as animals at a zoo, you can try a couple of tricks. First, set your camera 
to manual focusing — the glass barrier can give the autofocus mecha-
nism fits. Disable your flash to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, 
too. Then, if you can get close enough, your best odds are to put the 
lens right up to the glass (be careful not to scratch your lens). If you 
must stand further away, try to position your lens at a 90-degree angle 
to the glass. I used this approach in Figure 7-15 to photograph the snake, 
who was, thankfully, behind glass.
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority autoex-
posure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate 
for the movement of the car. Also turn on Vibration Control, if your lens 
Figure 7-14: To extend your lens’ close-focus 
ability, you can add magnifying diopters.

211
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
offers it. Oh, and keep a tight 
grip on your camera. 
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, 
use a tripod; fireworks require 
a long exposure, and trying to 
handhold your camera simply 
isn’t going to work. If using a 
zoom lens, zoom out to the 
shortest focal length (widest 
angle). Switch to manual 
focusing and set focus at infin-
ity (the farthest focus point 
possible on your lens). Set the 
exposure mode to manual, 
choose a relatively high f-stop 
setting — say, f/16 or so — 
and start a shutter speed of 
1 to 3 seconds. From there, 
it’s simply a matter of experi-
menting with different shutter 
speeds.
  
 Be especially gentle when you 
press the shutter button — 
with a very slow shutter, you 
can easily create enough 
camera movement to blur 
the image. If you purchased 
the accessory remote control for your camera, this is a good situation 
in which to use it. You can also set the self-timer to 2 seconds, which 
gives the camera time to stabilize after you press the shutter button. (See 
Chapter 2 for help with the self-timer setting.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, 
you can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal 
by using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $40. A 
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and 
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a 
90-degree angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must also 
be reflecting off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, 
a polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, which may 
or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing filter isn’t 
a surefire cure-all.
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-16, from 
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com), 
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and 
Figure 7-15: He’s watching you . . . 

212
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a 
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200, 
depending on size and features.

Figure 7-16: Investing in a light cube or tent makes photographing reflective 
objects much easier.
 
✓ Shooting in strong backlight-
ing: When the light behind 
your subject is very strong, the 
result is often an underexposed 
subject. You can try using flash 
to better expose the subject, 
assuming that you’re shooting 
in an exposure mode that per-
mits flash. The Active D-Lighting 
feature, which captures the 
image in a way that retains 
better detail in the shadows 
without blowing out highlights, 
may also help. (Chapter 5 offers 
an example.)
 
 But for another creative choice, 
you can purposely underexpose 
the subject to create a silhouette 
effect, as shown in Figure 7-17. 
Set your camera to an advanced 
exposure mode, disable flash 
and Active D-Lighting, and then 
base your exposure on the sky 
so that the darker areas of the 
frame remain dark.

subjects in silhouette.

Working with 
Picture Files

You’ve got a memory card full of pictures. 
Now it’s time to download them to your com-
puter so that you can print and share them, as 
well as enjoy viewing them on something larger 
than the camera monitor. The fi rst chapter in this 
part shows you how to get those pictures out of 
your camera and onto your computer and, just 
as important, how to safeguard them from future 
digital destruction. After downloading your fi les, 
head for Chapter 9, which offers step-by-step 
guidance on printing your pictures, sharing them 
online, and even viewing them on your television.

Downloading, Organizing, and 
Archiving Your Picture Files
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using Nikon Transfer and ViewNX to download and organize photos
▶ Processing NEF (RAW) files
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then keeping 
track of all of those image files is one of the more confusing aspects 
of the art form. And frankly, writing about the downloading 
and organizing process isn’t all that easy, either. I know, 
I know — would I like some whine with that cheese? 
But the truth is, providing you with detailed instruc-
tions is pretty much impossible because the steps 
vary widely depending on what software you have 
installed on your computer and which computer 
operating system you use.
To give you as much help as I can, however, this 
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize 
pictures using the free Nikon software that came 
in your camera box. After exploring these discus-
sions, you should be able to adapt the steps to any 
other photo program you may prefer. This chapter also 
covers a few other aspects of handling your picture files, 
including converting pictures taken in the NEF (RAW) format 
to a standard image format.

216
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
One note before you dig in: Most figures in this chapter and elsewhere fea-
ture the Windows Vista operating system. If you use some other version of 
Windows or another operating system, what you see on your screen may 
look slightly different but should contain the same basic options unless I 
specify otherwise.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, you 
need to dig out the USB cable that 
came in your camera box. Your 
computer must also have an open 
USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If 
you’re not sure what these gad-
gets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you 
a look. The little three-pronged 
icon, labeled in Figure 8-1, is the 
universal symbol for USB.
 
✓ Transfer images using a memory 
card reader. Many computers 
now also have slots that accept 
common types of memory cards. 
If so, you can simply pop the card 
out of your camera and into the 
card slot instead of hooking the 
camera up to the computer.
 
 As another option, you can buy 
stand-alone card readers such 
as the SanDisk model shown in 
Figure 8-2. This particular model 
accepts a variety of memory 
cards, including the SD card 
used by your D3000. Check your 
printer, too; many printers now 
have card slots that serve the 
purpose of a card reader. If not, 
you don’t have to spend much 
to buy a reader — they cost 
anywhere from about $10 to 
$35, depending on how many different types of cards they accept.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
I prefer to use a card reader because to transfer via the camera, the camera 
must be turned on during the process, wasting battery power. If you want to 
transfer directly from the camera, however, the next section explains some 
important steps you need to take to make that option work. For help using a 
card reader, skip ahead to “Starting the transfer process” to get an overview 
of what happens after you insert the card into the reader.
Connecting the camera and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer, 
Nikon suggests that your computer be running one of the following operating 
systems:
 
✓ Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic with Service Pack 1, Home Premium, 
Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition
 
✓ Windows XP with Service Pack 3, Home or Professional edition
 
✓ Mac OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.11, or 10.5.6
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd), 
check the support pages on the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) for the 
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always 
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, here are the steps to link your computer 
and camera:
 
1. Check the level of the camera battery.
 
 If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running out of battery 
power during the transfer process can cause problems, including lost 
picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased the optional AC adapter, 
use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. Turn on the computer and give it time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
 
3. Turn the camera off.
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs on the USB cable into the USB port 
on the side of the camera.
 
 Look under the little rubber door on the left side of the camera, as 
shown in Figure 8-3, for this port.

218
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable into the 
computer’s USB port.
 
 If possible, plug the cable into a port 
that’s built in to the computer, as 
opposed to one that’s on your keyboard 
or part of an external USB hub. Those 
accessory-type connections can some-
times foul up the transfer process.
 
6. Turn the camera on.
 
 What happens now depends on your 
computer operating system and what 
photo software you have installed on 
that system. The next section explains 
the possibilities and how to proceed 
with the image transfer process.
 
7. When the download is complete, turn 
off the camera and then disconnect it 
from the computer.
 
 I repeat: Turn off the camera before 
severing its ties with the computer. 
Otherwise, you can damage the camera.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, a Windows message box similar to the 
one in Figure 8-4 appears. Again, the figure shows the dialog box as it 
appears on a computer running Windows Vista. Whatever its design, the 
dialog box suggests different programs that you can use to download 
your picture files. Which programs appear depend on what you have 
installed on your system; if you installed Nikon Transfer, for example, 
it should appear in the program list, as in the figure. In Windows Vista, 
just click the transfer program that you want to use. In other versions of 
Windows, the dialog box may sport an OK button; if so, click that button 
to proceed.
USB port
Figure 8-3: The USB slot is hidden 
under the rubber door on the left 
side of the camera.

219
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
 If you want to use the same pro-
gram for all of your transfers, select 
the Always Do This for This Device 
check box, as shown in the figure. 
The next time you connect your 
camera or insert a memory card, 
Windows will automatically launch 
your program of choice instead of 
displaying the message box.
 
✓ An installed photo program 
automatically displays a photo-
download wizard. For example, 
the Nikon Transfer downloader or a 
downloader associated with Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, Picasa, or 
some other photo software may 
leap to the forefront. On a Mac, the 
built-in iPhoto software may dis-
play its auto downloader. (Apple’s 
Web site, www.apple.com, offers 
excellent video tutorials on using 
iPhoto, by the way.)
 
 Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software 
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your 
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from 
the previous program.
 
 If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or camera 
is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone simply may have 
disabled all the automatic downloaders on your system. Just launch your 
photo software and then transfer your pictures using whatever command 
starts that process. (I show you how to do it with Nikon Transfer later in 
the chapter; for other programs, consult the software manual.)
 
 As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to 
drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s hard 
drive. Whether you connect the card through a card reader or attach 
the camera directly, the computer sees the card or camera as just 
another drive on the system. So the process of transferring files is 
exactly the same as when you move any other file from a CD, DVD, or 
other storage device onto your hard drive.
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this initial 
boxful of transfer options.

220
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
In the next sections, I provide details on using Nikon Transfer to download 
your files and Nikon ViewNX to view and organize your pictures. Remember, 
if you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a 
long, healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 ✓ Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive 
for long-term, archival storage. Hard 
drives occasionally fail, wiping out all files 
in the process. This warning applies to 
both internal and external hard drives. At 
the very least, having a dual-drive backup 
is in order — you might keep one copy of 
your photos on your computer’s internal 
drive and another on an external drive. If 
one breaks, you’ve still got all your goodies 
on the other one. 
 ✓ Camera memory cards, flash memory keys, 
and other portable storage devices, such 
as one of those wallet-sized media players, 
are similarly risky. All are easily damaged 
if dropped or otherwise mishandled. And 
being of diminutive stature, these portable 
storage options also are easily lost.
 ✓ The best way to store important files is to 
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label 
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for qual-
ity, brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing, which offer a higher level of security 
than other coatings and boast a longer life 
than your garden-variety CDs.
 ✓ Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of 
holding lots more data than a CD. However, 
be aware that the DVDs you create on one 
computer may not be playable on another 
because multiple recording formats and 
disc types exist: DVD minus, DVD plus, dual-
layer DVD, and so on. If you do opt for DVD, 
look for the archival, gold-coated variety, 
just as for CDs.
 ✓ For a double backup, you may want to check 
into online storage services, such as Mozy 
(www.mozy.com) and IDrive (www.idrive.
com). You pay a monthly subscription fee 
to back up your important files to the site’s 
servers. 
 
 Note, though, the critical phrase here: 
double backup. Online storage sites have a 
troubling history of closing down suddenly, 
taking all their customers’ data with them. 
(One extremely alarming case was the clo-
sure of a photography-oriented storage site 
called Digital Railroad, which gave clients 
a mere 24-hours’ notice before destroying 
their files.) So anything you store online 
should be also stored on DVD or CD and 
kept in your home or office. Also note that 
photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, 
Kodak Gallery, and the like aren’t designed 
to be long-term storage tanks for your 
images. Usually, you get access to only a 
small amount of file storage space, and the 
site may require you to purchase prints or 
other photo products periodically to main-
tain your account.

221
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Downloading and Organizing Photos 
with the Nikon Software
Remember unpacking your camera box when you first brought home your 
D3000? Did you notice a CD-ROM called Nikon Software Suite? If you haven’t 
already done so, dig out that CD and pop it into your computer’s CD drive. 
Then install the following two programs:
 
✓ Nikon Transfer: This program assists you with the process of transfer-
ring pictures from your camera or memory card to the computer.
 
✓ Nikon ViewNX: After downloading your files, you can view and organize 
your picture files using this program. You also can print and e-mail your 
photos from ViewNX.
 
Note that this book features Nikon Transfer version 1.5 and Nikon ViewNX 
version 1.4, which were the most current at the time of publication. If you 
own an earlier version of these programs, visit the Nikon Web site to install 
the updates. (To find out what version you have installed, open the program. 
Then, in Windows, choose Help➪About. On a Mac, choose the About com-
mand from the Nikon Transfer or Nikon ViewNX menu.)
The next several sections give you the most basic of introductions to using 
Nikon Transfer and ViewNX. If you want more details, just look in the Help 
system built in to the programs. (Click the Help menu to access the system.)
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use the Nikon software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, you 
don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your com-
puter, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file that you 
put on your system. In fact, for most photo editing programs, you can set 
things up so that you can select a photo in ViewNX and then open that picture 
in your chosen photo editor with a click or two. (With some programs, you 
must first take the step of importing the photo files, which enables the program 
to build thumbnails and, in some cases, working copies of your pictures.) You 
can find details in the ViewNX Help system (open the program and then 
choose Help➪ViewNX Help); look for the section called “Setting Up ViewNX.”
Downloading with Nikon Transfer
The following steps explain how to download new pictures to your computer 
using Nikon Transfer:
 
1. Attach your camera or insert a memory card into your card reader, as 
outlined in the first part of this chapter.

222
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Depending on what software you have installed on your system, you 
may see the initial Nikon Transfer window, as shown in Figure 8-5. Or, in 
Windows, you may see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 
8-4. In that case, click the item that has the Nikon Transfer logo, as 
shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 If nothing happens, start Nikon Transfer by using the same process you 
use to launch any program on your computer. (If some other photo soft-
ware pops up, close it first.)
 
2. Display the Source tab to view thumbnails of your pictures, as shown 
in the figure.

Figure 8-5: Select the check boxes of the images that you want to download.

223
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
 Don’t see any tabs? Click the little Options triangle, located near the 
top-left corner of the window and labeled in Figure 8-5, to display 
them. Then click the Source tab. The icon representing your camera or 
memory card should be selected, as shown in the figure. If not, click the 
icon. The dialog box then displays thumbnails of your images. If you 
don’t see the thumbnails, click the arrow labeled in Figure 8-5 to expand 
the dialog box and open the thumbnails area.
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
 A check mark in the little box under a thumbnail tells the program that 
you want to download the image. Click the box to toggle the check mark 
on and off.
 
 If you used the in-camera functions to protect pictures (see Chapter 4), 
you can select just those images by clicking the Select Protected icon, 
labeled in Figure 8-5. To select all images on the card, click the Select All 
icon instead.
 
4. Click the Primary Destination tab at the top of the window.
 
 When you click the tab, the top of the transfer window offers options 
that enable you to specify where and how you want the images to be 
stored on your computer. Figure 8-6 offers a look. 
 
5. Choose the folder where you want to store the images from the 
Primary Destination Folder drop-down list.
 
 The list is labeled in Figure 8-6. If the folder you want to use isn’t in the 
list, open the drop-down list, choose Browse from the bottom of the list, 
and then track down the folder and select it.
 
 By default, the program puts images in a folder titled Nikon Transfer, 
which is housed inside a folder named My Pictures in Windows XP and 
Pictures in Windows Vista and on a Mac. That My Pictures or Pictures 
folder is housed inside a folder that your system creates automatically 
for each registered user of the computer.
Choose a storage folder
Figure 8-6: Specify the folder where you want to put the downloaded images.

224
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 You don’t have to stick with this default location — you can put your 
pictures anywhere you please. But because most photo programs auto-
matically look for pictures in these standard folders, putting your pic-
tures there just simplifies things a little down the road. Note: You can 
always move your pictures into other folders after you download them if 
needed, too. The upcoming section “Organizing pictures” explains how 
to do so in Nikon ViewNX.
 
6. Specify whether you want the pictures to be placed inside a new 
subfolder.
 
 If you select the Create Subfolder for Each Transfer option, the program 
creates a new folder inside the storage folder you selected in Step 5. 
Then it puts all the pictures from the current download session into that 
new subfolder. You can either use the numerical subfolder name the 
program suggests or click the Edit button to set up your own naming 
system. You might find it helpful to go with a folder name that includes 
the date that the batch of photos was taken, for example. (You can reor-
ganize your pictures into this type of setup after download, however.) If 
you created custom folders on the camera memory card, an option you 
can explore in Chapter 11, select the Copy Folder Names from Camera 
check box to use those folder names instead.
 
7. Tell the program whether you want to rename the picture files during 
the download process.
 
 If you do, select the Rename Photos During Transfer check box. Then 
click the Edit button to display a dialog box where you can set up your 
new filenaming scheme. Click OK after you do so to close the dialog box.
 
8. Click the Preferences tab to set the rest of the transfer options.
 
 Now the tab shown in Figure 8-7 takes over the top of the program 
window. Here you find a number of options that enable you to control 
how the program operates. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but 
a couple warrant a few words of advice:
Figure 8-7: Control other aspects of the program’s behavior via the Preferences tab.

225
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
• Launch automatically when device is attached. Deselect this check 
box if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to start every time you con-
nect your camera to your computer or insert a memory card into 
your card reader.
 
• Transfer new photos only. This option, when selected, ensures that 
you don’t waste time downloading images that you’ve already 
transferred but are still on the memory card.
 
• Delete original files after transfer. Turn this option off, as shown in 
Figure 8-7. Otherwise, your pictures are automatically erased from 
your memory card when the transfer is complete. You should 
always check to make sure the pictures really made it to the com-
puter before you delete them from your memory card. (See Chapter 
4 to find out how to use the Delete function on your camera.)
 
• Open destination folder with other application after transfer. By 
default, Nikon Transfer shuts itself down when the file download 
is complete, and Nikon ViewNX then starts automatically so that 
you can view and organize your images. (That’s assuming that you 
installed ViewNX, of course.) If you want to use a program other 
than ViewNX for that task, open the drop-down list, click Browse, 
and select the program from the dialog box that appears. Click OK 
after doing so. And if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to close after 
downloading, uncheck the Quit Nikon Transfer Automatically After 
Transfer option.
 
 Your choices remain in force for any subsequent download sessions, so 
you don’t have to revisit this tab unless you want the program to behave 
differently.
 
9. When you’re ready to start the download, click the Start Transfer 
button.
 
 It’s located in the lower-right corner of the program window. (Refer to 
Figure 8-5.) After you click the button, the Process bar in the lower-left 
corner indicates how the transfer is progressing. Again, what happens 
when the transfer completely depends on the choices you made in Step 
8; by default, Nikon Transfer closes, and ViewNX opens, automatically 
displaying the folder that contains your just-downloaded images.
Browsing images in Nikon ViewNX
Nikon ViewNX is designed to do exactly what its name suggests: enable you 
to view and organize the pictures that you shoot with your D3000. You also 
can view other photos — pictures you scanned, received from friends via 
e-mail, or took with a different camera, for example. The only requirement is 
that the file format is one that ViewNX can read; for still photos, that means 
JPEG, TIFF, or NEF, which is the Nikon flavor of Camera Raw. (Chapter 3 
explains file formats.) For a complete rundown of supported file formats, 
check the Appendix section of the built-in program Help system.

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-8 offers a look at the ViewNX window as it appears by default in 
Windows Vista. The Mac version is nearly identical, although it features the 
usual Mac look and feel instead of the Microsoft Windows design.
 
On either type of system, you can customize a variety of aspects of the 
window layout by using the options on the View and Window menus.
To start viewing your pictures, first display the Folders tab along the left side of 
the program window, as shown in Figure 8-8. (Just click the tab, labeled in the 
figure.) Now open the folder that holds the photos you want to view. If you came 
to ViewNX directly after downloading pictures via Nikon Transfer, the folder 
that holds the new images should already be selected for you. Thumbnails of 
those images then appear on the right side of the program window. 
Zoom slider

Figure 8-8: You can browse and organize your photos using Nikon ViewNX.
 
By opening the View menu, you can choose from the following viewing options:
 
✓ Thumbnail View: This is the default layout. For this view, you can 
choose from two thumbnail display styles. If you select Thumbnail 
Grid from the View menu, your screen appears as shown in Figure 8-8. 

227
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
You can adjust the size of the thumbnails by dragging the Zoom slider, 
labeled in the figure. If you prefer, you can instead select Thumbnail 
List, in which case you see thumbnails with information such as the file-
names, the dates the images were taken, file sizes, and so on.
 
✓ Image Viewer: Select this option from the View menu to display your 
files as shown in Figure 8-9. Small thumbnails appear along the top of the 
pane; the selected thumbnail appears in the larger preview area under-
neath. Use these maneuvers to inspect your images:
 
• To select an image file, click its thumbnail.
 
• Magnify or reduce the size of photo thumbnails and the preview by 
using the Zoom sliders labeled in Figure 8-9. 
 
• Drag in the large preview to scroll the display as needed to view 
hidden parts of a photo.

• To scroll through your files, click the little arrows under the large 
preview, labeled Previous Photo and Next Photo in the figure.
 
✓ Full Screen: Want to fill the entire screen with a photo? If you’re working in 
Thumbnail view (with or without all the data displayed), just double-click 
the picture thumbnail. In Image Viewer view, first click the thumbnail to 
display it in the large preview. Then double-click the large preview. Or, in 
either view, click the thumbnail and then press the letter F. Whichever way 
you go, your picture opens in a new viewer window, as shown in Figure 8-10. 
 
 In Full Screen view, as in the other views, you can magnify still photos 
by dragging the Zoom slider, as shown in the figure. To view additional 
photos at full-screen size, click the Previous and Next arrows under the 
image display. To return to the main browser window, just click the win-
dow’s close button or choose a display option from the Display Options 
drop-down list, labeled in Figure 8-10.

Viewing picture metadata
When you snap a photo with your D3000, the camera includes in the picture 
file some extra data that records all the critical camera settings that were 
in force. This data, known as metadata, also includes the capture date and 

229
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
time. And, if you take advantage of the Image Comment feature that I cover in 
Chapter 11, you can even store a brief bit of custom text, such as the shoot-
ing location or subject. (Note that the date/time information is included 
automatically in the metadata; it’s unrelated to the Date Imprint function, dis-
cussed in Chapter 1. That feature actually places the date and time directly 
on the image itself rather than hiding it in the metadata.) 
 
Reviewing this data is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to 
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other digital 
photography basics. To get the full story on how each setting affects your 
pictures, see Chapters 5 and 6.
To view the metadata in ViewNX, first select an image by clicking its thumb-
nail in the ViewNX browser window. Then click the Metadata tab on the left 
side of the window or choose Window➪Metadata. The metadata information 
then comes to the forefront, as shown in Figure 8-11.
Metadata tab
Figure 8-11: Inspecting metadata is a great way to see what settings work best for different 
subjects and lighting conditions.

230
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
The metadata is divided into several sections of related capture settings: File 
Info 1, File Info 2, Camera Info, Exposure, and so on. To hide or display a sec-
tion, click the triangle next to it. You may need to use the scroll bar along the 
right side of the panel to view all the available information. Note that Nikon 
supplies ViewNX with cameras other than the D3000, and some categories of 
data apply only to those other models.
The XMP/IPTC Information part of the Metadata panel gives you access to the 
ViewNX keywords, tags, and rating functions. These functions, along with the 
program’s search feature, provide you with various tools that make locating 
specific pictures easier, including the option to search for pictures based on 
the shooting date.
 
In case you’re curious, IPTC refers to text data that press photographers are 
often required to tag onto their picture files, such as captions and copyright 
information. XMP refers to a data format developed by Adobe to enable that 
kind of data to be added to the file. IPTC stands for International Press 
Telecommunication Council; XMP stands for Extensible Metadata Platform.
Organizing pictures
When you download files from your camera using Nikon Transfer, you can 
specify where on your computer’s hard drive you want to store them. After 
you get the files on your system, you can further organize them in ViewNX. 
You can create new folders and subfolders, move images from one folder to 
another, rename and delete files, and more.
To begin organizing your files, first display the Folders tab on the left side 
of the program window. In this tab, you can see and manage the contents of 
all the drives and folders on your computer. From here, you can set up and 
rearrange your storage closet as follows:
 
✓ Hide/display the contents of a drive or folder. See a little plus sign 
(Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac) next to a drive or folder? Click 
it to display the contents of that storage bin. A minus sign (Windows) or 
a down-pointing triangle (Mac) means that the drive or folder is open; 
click that minus sign or triangle to close the drive or folder.
 
✓ Create a new folder. First, click the drive or folder where you want 
to house the new folder. For example, if you want to create it inside 
your Pictures or My Pictures folder, click it. Icons representing all the 
folders and files currently found within that folder then appear in the 
thumbnail area.
 
 Next, choose File➪New Folder. An icon representing the new folder 
should then appear, with the name box activated, as shown in Figure 
8-12. Type the folder name and press Enter.

231
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Figure 8-12: You can set up whatever folder structure makes sense to you.
 
✓ Move a file from one folder to another. First, display that file’s thumb-
nail in the browser. Then drag the thumbnail to the destination folder in 
the Folder pane.
 
✓ Delete a file. In Windows, click the thumbnail and then choose Edit➪
Delete or press the Delete key. On a Mac, choose Edit➪Move to Trash or 
press Ô+Delete. You then see a message asking you to confirm that you 
really want to trash the file. Click Yes to move forward.
 
✓ Protect or unlock photos. If you used the Protect feature on your 
camera to “lock” a file, a process you can explore in Chapter 4, you need 
to remove the protection if you want to edit the image in your photo 
software. To do so, choose File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.
 
 You also can protect files in ViewNX; just choose Protect from the File➪
Protect Files submenu. A little key icon then appears on the thumbnail 
to remind you that the file is now protected from editing or erasing. If 
you later want to delete the file, you must first unprotect it.
 
✓ Select multiple files for moving, deleting, or other actions. Click the 
thumbnail of the first image and then Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) the rest. To select all images in the current folder, press Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Ô+A (Mac.)

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Processing RAW (NEF) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the RAW file format. The advantage of captur-
ing RAW files, which are called NEF files on Nikon cameras, is that you make 
the decisions about how to translate the original picture data into an actual 
photograph. You can specify attributes such as color intensity, image sharp-
ening, contrast, and so on — all of which are handled automatically by the 
camera if you use its other file format, JPEG. You take these steps by using a 
software tool known as a RAW converter.
 
The bad news: Until you convert your NEF files into a standard file format, 
you can’t share them online or print them from most programs other than 
Nikon ViewNX. You also can’t get prints from most retail outlets or open 
them in many photo editing programs.
To process your D3000 NEF files, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Use the in-camera processing feature. Through the Retouch menu, you 
can process your RAW images right in the camera. You can specify only 
limited image attributes (color, sharpness, and so on), and you can save 
the processed files only in the JPEG format, but still, having this option 
is a nice feature. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Process and convert in ViewNX. ViewNX also offers a RAW processing 
feature. Again, the controls for setting picture characteristics are a little 
limited, but you can save the adjusted files in either the JPEG or TIFF 
format. The last section of this chapter walks you through this option.
 
✓ Use Nikon Capture NX 2 or a third-party RAW conversion tool. For the 
most control over your RAW images, you need to open up your wallet 
and invest in a program that offers a truly capable converter. Nikon 
offers such a program, called Nikon Capture NX 2, which as of this writ-
ing sells for about $180. Figure 8-13 gives you a look at the Capture NX 2 
RAW converter window.
 
 Another (and less costly option) that I frequently recommend is Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, which sells for about $90 (www.adobe.com). It 
includes the Adobe Camera Raw converter, known in the industry as 
ACR, which is widely considered one of the best available. (Note: The 
converter in Elements doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of the ver-
sion of ACR provided with Photoshop, however.) In addition, Elements 

233
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
is designed for the novice photo editing enthusiast, so it includes lots of 
helpful onscreen guides, whereas Capture NX 2 is geared more to the 
advanced digital photographer.
Figure 8-13: Nikon Capture NX 2 is one option for gaining more control over your RAW conversions.
If you do opt for a third-party conversion tool, check the program’s Help 
system for details on how to use the various controls, which vary from pro-
gram to program. The following general tips apply no matter what converter 
you use, however:

234
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Whenever possible, save your processed files in a nondestructive format 
such as TIFF. For top quality, don’t save originals in the JPEG format, 
which applies lossy compression. You can read about the potential 
damage to image quality that lossy compression creates in Chapter 3. 
If you need a JPEG image to share online, Chapter 9 shows you how to 
create a duplicate of your original, converted image in that format.
 
✓ Some RAW converters give you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. 
(A bit is a unit of computer data; the more bits you have, the more colors 
your image can contain.) Although you can create 16-bit TIFF files, many 
photo editing programs either can’t open them or limit you to a few edit-
ing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit image option. 
Your image will contain more than enough colors, and you’ll avoid 
potential conflicts caused by so-called high-bit images.
 
✓ Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so 
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing 
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. 
Processing RAW images in the camera
Scroll past the initial screen of options on the Retouch menu, and you come to 
a menu item called NEF (RAW) Processing. With this feature, you can process 
RAW files right in the camera — no computer or other software required.
I want to share two reservations about this option:
 
✓ First, you can save your processed files only in the JPEG format. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, that format results in some quality loss because 
of the file compression that JPEG applies. You can choose the level of 
JPEG compression you want to apply during RAW processing; you can 
create a JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic file. Each of those settings produces 
the same quality that you get when you shoot new photos in the JPEG 
format and select Fine, Normal, or Basic from the Image Quality menu.
 
 Chapter 3 details the JPEG options, but, long story short, choose Fine for 
the best JPEG quality. And if you want to produce the absolute best 
quality from your RAW images, use a software solution and save your 
processed file in the TIFF format instead.
 
✓ You can make adjustments to exposure, color, and a few other options 
as part of the in-camera RAW conversion process. Evaluating the effects 
of your adjustments on the camera monitor can be difficult because of 
the size of the display compared to your computer monitor. So for really 
tricky images, you may want to forgo in-camera conversion and do the 
job on your computer, where you can get a better — and bigger — view 
of things. If you do go the in-camera route, make sure that the monitor 
brightness is set to its default position so that you aren’t misled by the 
display. (Chapter 1 shows you how to adjust monitor brightness.)

235
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
That said, in-camera RAW processing offers a quick and convenient solution 
when you need JPEG copies of your NEF images for immediate online shar-
ing. (JPEG is the standard format for online use.) Follow these steps to get 
the job done:
 
1. Press the Playback button to switch to playback mode.
 
2. Display the picture you want to process in the single-image (full-
frame) view.
 
 If necessary, you can shift from thumbnails view to single-image view by 
just pressing the OK button. Chapter 4 has more playback details.
 
3. Press the OK button.
 
 The Retouch menu then appears 
atop your photo, as shown in 
Figure 8-14.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to scroll 
to the NEF (RAW) Processing 
option, as shown in Figure 8-14.
 
5. Press OK to display your pro-
cessing options, as shown in 
Figure 8-15.
 
 This screen is command central 
for specifying what settings you 
want the camera to use when 
creating the JPEG version of your 
RAW image.
 
6. Set the conversion options.

236
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Along the right side of the screen, you see a vertical column offering five 
conversion options, which I labeled in Figure 8-15. To establish the set-
ting for an option, use the Multi Selector to highlight it and then press 
the Multi Selector right. You then 
see the available settings for the 
option. For example, if you choose 
the first option, Image Quality, 
you see the screen shown in 
Figure 8-16. Use the Multi Selector 
to highlight the setting you want 
to use and press OK to return to 
the main RAW conversion screen.
 
 Rather than detailing all the 
options here, the following list 
points you to the chapter where 
you can explore the settings 
available for each:
 
• Image Quality: See the 
Chapter 3 section related to the JPEG quality settings for details on 
this option.
 
• Image Size: The first part of Chapter 3 explains this one.
 
• White Balance: Check out Chapter 6 for details about White 
Balance options.
 
• Exposure Compensation: With this option, you can adjust image 
brightness by applying exposure compensation, a feature that I 
cover in Chapter 5.
 
• Picture Control: This option enables you to adjust color, contrast, 
and image sharpness. For a review of the available settings, see the 
last part of Chapter 6.
 
7. When you finish setting all the 
conversion options, highlight 
EXE on the main conversion 
screen. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) 
Then press OK.
 
 The camera records a JPEG copy 
of your RAW file and displays the 
copy in the monitor. To remind 
you that the image was created 
with the help of the Retouch 
menu, the top-left corner of the 
display sports the little Retouch 
icon, and the filename of the 
image begins with CSC rather 
than the usual DSC, as shown in Figure 8-17. See Chapter 4 for details 
about filenaming conventions used by the D3000.
Figure 8-16: Select the setting you want to 
use and press OK.

images start with CSC.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Processing RAW files in ViewNX
In ViewNX, you can convert your RAW files to either the JPEG format or, for 
top picture quality, to the TIFF format. (See Chapter 3 if you’re unsure about 
the whole concept of file format and how it relates to picture quality.)
Although the ViewNX converter isn’t as full-featured as the ones in Nikon 
Capture NX 2, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and some other photo editing pro-
grams, it does enable you to make some adjustments to your RAW images. 
Follow these steps to try it out.
 
1. Click the thumbnail of the NEF (RAW) image to select it.
 
 You may want to set the program to Image Viewer mode, as shown in 
Figure 8-18, so that you can see a larger preview of your image. Just 
choose View➪Image Viewer to switch to this display mode.
 
2. Display the Quick Adjustment tab by clicking its tab on the left side of 
the program window.
 
 I labeled the tab in Figure 8-18. The tab provides access to a few con-
trols for fine-tuning your image. You can adjust exposure compensa-
tion, white balance, and assign a Picture Control, such as Landscape or 
Monochrome. Each time you adjust a setting, the preview updates to 
show you the results.
  
 A couple of options may require some explanation:
 
• Launch Utility button: This button, located under the Picture 
Control option, opens the Picture Control Utility, where you can 
define your own Picture Controls. I don’t get into this advanced 
function in this book, but if you’re curious, open the utility and 
then click the Help button at the bottom of the window.
 
• Highlight Protection/Shadow Protection/D-Lighting HS: Try using 
these options to recover hidden shadow and highlight detail.
 
• Color Booster: This slider (at the bottom of the panel, not vis-
ible in Figure 8-18) enables you to increase saturation. But if you 
select the People button under the slider, skin tones are left alone. 
Choose Nature to adjust the saturation of all colors in the photo.
 
• Axial Color Aberration: Due to an optical phenomenon that’s too 
complex to fully explore here, some lenses can produce a defect 
known as axial color aberration or, in some circles, color fring-
ing. This defect results in weird color halos along the edges of an 
object, typically on the side away from the center of the photo. 
To check your photo, zoom the display to a magnification of 200 
percent or greater — the halos usually aren’t visible when the dis-
play size is small — and pay special attention to the corners of the 
photo, where the problem tends to be greatest. If you spot haloing, 

238
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
check the Auto box for the Axial Color Aberration setting and let 
the program try to apply the proper correction. You then can drag 
the slider to tweak the strength of the correction, if needed. (The 
program may need a few seconds to update the preview after each 
change, so be patient.)
 
 If you want more details about these or any other of the options, choose 
Help➪ViewNX Help to open the Help system, and then display the Help 
pages related to the Quick Adjustment tab.
 
3. Click the Save button at the bottom of the Quick Adjustment area.
 
 Or to revert to the original adjustment settings, click Reset.
 
4. To save the processed file, choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 Or just click the Convert Files button on the toolbar at the top of the 
program window. Either way, you see the Convert Files dialog box, 
shown in Figure 8-19.
Quick Adjustment tab
Figure 8-18: Display the Quick Adjustment tab to tweak RAW images before conversion.

239
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
5. Select TIFF (8 Bit) from the File Format drop-down list.
 
 You also can opt for TIFF (16 Bit) or JPEG, but I don’t recommend it. 
TIFF (16 Bit) can cause problems when you try to open the file in certain 
photo editing and organizing programs. And saving in the JPEG format 
applies lossy compression, thereby sacrificing some image quality. If you 
need a JPEG copy of your processed RAW image for online sharing, you 
can easily create one from your TIFF version by following the steps laid 
out in Chapter 9.
 
6. Deselect the Use LZW Compression option, as shown in the figure.
 
 Although LZW Compression reduces the file size somewhat and does 
not cause any quality loss, some programs can’t open files that were 
saved with this option enabled. So turn it off.
Figure 8-19: To retain the best image quality, save processed RAW files 
in the TIFF format.

240
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
7. Deselect the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 This step ensures that you retain all the original pixels in your image, 
which gives you the most flexibility in terms of generating quality prints 
at large sizes. For details on this issue, check out Chapter 3.
 
8. Deselect each of the three Remove check boxes.
 
 If you select the check boxes, you strip image metadata — the extra text 
data that’s stored by the camera — from the file. Unless you have some 
specific reason to do so, clear all three check boxes so that you can con-
tinue to access the metadata when you view your processed image in 
programs that know how to display metadata.
 
 The first two check boxes relate to data that you can view on the 
Metadata tab in ViewNX; earlier sections of this chapter give you the low-
down. The ICC profile item refers to the image color space, which is either 
sRGB or Adobe RGB on your D3000. Chapter 6 explains the difference.
 
9. Select a storage location for the processed TIFF file.
 
 You do this in the Save In area of the dialog box, highlighted in Figure 
8-19. Select the top option to save your processed file in the same folder 
as the original RAW file. Or, to put the file in a different folder, click the 
Specified Folder button. The name of the currently selected alterna-
tive folder appears below the button, as shown in Figure 8-19.You can 
change the storage destination by clicking the Browse button and then 
selecting the drive and folder where you want to put the file.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can put your TIFF file into a separate folder within the destina-
tion folder. If you select the box, click the Naming Options button and 
then specify how you want to name the subfolder.
 
10. Specify whether you want to give the processed TIFF a different file-
name from the original RAW image.
 
 To do so, select the Change File Names check box and then click the 
Naming Options button and enter the name you want to use.
 
 If you don’t change the filename, ViewNX gives the file the same name 
as the original RAW file. But you don’t overwrite that RAW file because 
you are storing the copy in a different file format (TIFF). In Windows, the 
filename of the processed TIFF image has the three-letter extension TIF.
 
11. Click the Convert button.
 
 A window appears to show you the progress of the conversion process. 
When the window disappears, your TIFF image appears in the storage 
location you selected in Step 10.

241
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
One neat thing about working with RAW images is that you can easily create 
as many variations of your photo as you want. For example, you might 
choose one set of options when processing your RAW file the first time, and 
then use an entirely different set to create another version of the photo. You 
could create one image in full color, perhaps, and then open the RAW file 
again and this time launch the Picture Control Utility and create a sepia ver-
sion of the image.

Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
In This Chapter
▶ Setting the stage for great prints
▶ Looking at retail printing options
▶ Preparing a picture for the Web
▶ Creating a slide show
▶ Viewing images on a TV
W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print, 
it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-
high prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail 
photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, and online printing 
services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in 
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good out-
come. Your D3000 can produce dynamic prints even 
at large sizes, and getting those prints made is easy 
and economical, thanks to an abundance of digital 
printing services now in stores and online.
That said, getting the best output from your camera 
still requires a little bit of knowledge and prep work 
on your part. To that end, this chapter tells you 
exactly how to ensure that your picture files will look as 
good on paper as they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures 
electronically. First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an 
important step if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering their 
inboxes with ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you can find 
out how to create digital slide shows and view your pictures on a television.

244
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Printing Possibilities: Retail or Do-It-Yourself?
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own 
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless, 
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for 
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo 
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that 
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail 
photo lab.
 
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I 
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with 
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the 
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out 
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:
 
✓ Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the 
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off 
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little 
as an hour.
 
✓ Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail 
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card 
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for 
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 
✓ Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to 
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house. 
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are 
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such 
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 
✓ Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national 
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick 
up your prints at a local store. This service is a great way to share prints 
with faraway friends and family, by the way. I can upload and order 
prints from my desk in Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed 
at a store located a few miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
 
For times when you do want to print your photos on your own printer, you 
can do so through Nikon ViewNX. However, I find the ViewNX printing 
options both more complex and more limited than those in other programs, 
which is why I opted not to cover them in this book. I suggest that you 
instead print from whatever photo editing program you use or from the soft-
ware provided by your printer manufacturer.

245
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Preventing Potential Printing Problems
Boy, I love a good alliteration, don’t you? Oh, just me, then. Anyway, as I say 
in the introduction to this chapter, a few issues can cause hiccups in the 
printing process. So before you print your photos, whether you want to do it 
on your own printer or send them to a lab, read through the next three sec-
tions, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble spots.
Match resolution to print size
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in 
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality. 
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick 
recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ On the D3000, you set picture resolution via the Image Size option, 
which you can adjust either via the Shooting menu, the Quick Settings 
display, or in Guide mode, through the Set Up menu. (Again, see Chapter 
3 for specifics.) You must select this option before you capture an image, 
which means that you need some idea of your ultimate print size before 
you shoot. And if you crop your image, you eliminate some pixels, so 
take that factor into account when you do the resolution math. 
 
✓ For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience, 
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you 
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
✓ Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably, 
some from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, 
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right reso-
lution is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots 
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple 
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 
✓ If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the 
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine the 
resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print size. 
But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution 
cop. (Some programs, however, do alert you in the Print dialog box if 
the resolution is dangerously low.)
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print 
size or print quality.

246
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things happens:
 
✓ The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size to fill 
the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a defect 
known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairstepped, 
along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually make out 
the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look more like a mosaic 
than, well, a photograph.
 
✓ The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels 
to fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in 
your photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the 
low resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo 
information out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks 
worse than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details 
turn muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 through 9-3 show you the same 
image as it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of 
this book), at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, 
there’s just no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you 
need the right pixel count.

Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your D3000 produces photos that have an 
aspect ratio of 3:2. That is, pictures are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just 
like a 35mm film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to 
the standard 4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, 
which must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 8 x 
10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those propor-
tions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an 
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, Figure 9-4 shows you a 3:2 original image. The out-
lines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 5-x-7-inch frame and 
an 8-x-10-inch frame.
8 x 10
5 x 7
Figure 9-4: Composing your shots with a little head room enables you to crop to different frame 
sizes.

249
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Your camera’s Trim feature, found on the Retouch menu, enables you to crop 
your photo, but only to five different aspect ratios (3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1, and 16:9). 
See Chapter 10 for information. For other proportions, most photo editing 
programs offer very simple cropping tools. You also can usually crop your 
photo using the software provided at online printing sites and at retail print 
kiosks. But if you plan to drop off your memory card of original pictures at 
a lab, be aware that your pictures will be cropped if you select a print size 
other than 4 x 6. 
 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as shown in Figure 9-4. Then 
you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what print size you 
choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head room, especially 
when describing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is 
actually the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately 
calibrated, the colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image 
colors.
 
 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, 
you can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a 
small program that guides you through the process of adjusting your 
monitor. The program displays various color swatches and other graph-
ics and then asks you to provide feedback about what you see on the 
screen.
 
 If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration utility, 
called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-5 shows the welcome 
screen that appears when you run the program. (Access it by opening 
the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, clicking 
the Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate button.) The latest 
incarnation of the Windows operating system, Windows 7, has a similar 
tool called Display Color Calibration. You also can find free calibration 
software for both Mac and Windows systems online; just enter the term 
free monitor calibration software into your favorite search engine.

250
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-5: Mac users can take advantage of this built-in calibration tool.
 
 Software-based calibration isn’t ideal, however, because our eyes aren’t 
that reliable in judging color accuracy. For a more accurate calibration, 
you may want to invest in a device known as a colorimeter, which you 
attach to or hang on your monitor, to accurately measure and calibrate 
your display. Companies such as Datacolor (www.datacolor.com), 
Pantone (www.pantone.com), and X-Rite (www.xrite.com) sell this type 
of product along with other tools for ensuring better color matching.
 
 Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so, because monitor colors drift over time.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that 
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the 
truth is that a printer that doesn’t use multiple black or gray cartridges 
will always have a slight color tint. Why? Because in order to create 
gray, the printer instead has to mix yellow, magenta, and cyan in 

251
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
perfectly equal amounts, and that’s a difficult feat for the typical inkjet 
printer to pull off. If your black-and-white prints have a strong color tint, 
however, it could be that one of your color cartridges is empty, and 
replacing it may help somewhat. Long story short: Unless you have a 
printer that’s marketed for producing good black-and-white prints, you’ll 
probably save yourself some grief by simply having your black-and-
whites printed at a retail lab.
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manu-
facturer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the 
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously 
knows most about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 
 Some paper manufacturers, especially those that sell fine-art papers, 
offer downloadable printer profiles, which are simply little bits of soft-
ware that tell your printer how to manage color for the paper. Refer to 
the manufacturer’s Web site for information on how to install and use 
the profiles.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color-management 
duties. Some photo programs offer features that enable the user to con-
trol how colors are handled as an image passes from camera to monitor 
to printer. Most printer software also offers color-management features. 
The problem is, if you enable color-management controls both in your 
photo software and your printer software, you can create conflicts that 
lead to wacky colors. So check your photo software and printer manuals 
to find out what color-management options are available to you and how 
to turn them on and off.
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect per-
fect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t repro-
duce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition, 
monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated 
with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see.

252
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one 
in Figure 9-6? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital photo 
that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your D3000 offers two technologies, called 
DPOF (dee-poff) and PictBridge, that enable 
you to print images directly from your camera 
or memory card, without using the computer as 
middle-machine. In order to take advantage of 
direct printing, your printer must also support 
one of the two technologies, and you must cap-
ture the images in the JPEG file format, which 
I explain in Chapter 3. (You can also capture 
the photo in the Raw format and then use your 
D3000’s in-camera conversion tool to make a 
JPEG copy suitable for direct printing.)
DPOF stands for Digital Print Order Format. 
With this option, accessed via your camera’s 
Playback menu, you select the pictures on 
your memory card that you want to print, and 
you specify how many copies you want of 
each image. Then, if your photo printer has 
an SD Card slot and supports DPOF, you just 
pop the memory card into that slot. The printer 
reads your “print order” and outputs just the 
requested copies of your selected images. (You 
use the printer’s own controls to set paper size, 
print orientation, and other print settings.)
PictBridge works a little differently. If you have a 
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For 
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and 
want to deliver prints to guests before they go 
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing 
up your computer, downloading pictures, and 
so on. And if you invest in one of the tiny por-
table photo printers on the market today, you 
can easily make prints away from your home or 
office — you can take both your portable printer 
and camera along to your regional sales meet-
ing, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, 
the camera must be turned on for the whole 
printing process, wasting battery power. But 
if you’re interested in exploring either printing 
feature, your camera manual provides complete 
details.

253
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Figure 9-6: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 640 pixels at its 
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture 
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-7. This image measures 640 x 428 pixels. As 
you can see, it’s plenty large enough to provide a decent photo-viewing expe-
rience. On a small monitor, it may even be too large.
This size recommendation means that even if you shoot at your D3000’s 
lowest Image Size setting (1936 x 1296 pixels), you need to dump pixels from 
your images before sending them to the cyber post office. You have a couple 
of options for creating an e-mail–sized image:
 
✓ Use the Small Picture feature on your camera’s Retouch menu. This fea-
ture enables you to create your e-mail copy right in the camera.
 
✓ Downsample the image in your photo editor. Downsampling is geekspeak 
for dumping pixels. Most photo editors offer a feature that handles this 
process for you. Use this option if you want to crop or otherwise edit 
the photo before sharing it.

254
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-7: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 640 pixels wide or tall.
The next two sections walk you through the steps for both methods of cre-
ating your e-mail images. You can use the same steps, by the way, for sizing 
images for any onscreen use, whether it’s for a Web page or multimedia 
presentation. You may want your copies to be larger or smaller than the 
recommended e-mail size for those uses, however. 
 
One last point about onscreen images: Remember that pixel count has abso-
lutely no effect on the quality of pictures displayed onscreen. Pixel count 
determines only the size at which your images are displayed.
Creating small copies using the camera
To create small, e-mailable copies of your images without using a computer, 
use your camera’s Small Picture feature. Here’s how:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button to set your camera to playback mode.
 
2. Display the picture in single-image view.

255
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
 If the monitor currently displays multiple thumbnails, just press the OK 
button to switch to single-image view.
 
3. Press OK to display the Retouch menu over your image, as shown on 
the left in Figure 9-8.
 
4. Highlight Small Picture and press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure. You can choose 
from three size options (stated in pixels) for your small copy. 
 
5. Highlight the size you want to use for your copy.
 
 For pictures that you plan to send via e-mail, choose either 640 x 480 or 
320 x 240 pixels unless the recipient is connected to the Internet via a 
very slow, dial-up modem connection. In that case, you may want to go 
one step down, to 160 x 120 pixels. (The display size of the picture may 
be quite small at that setting however, depending on the resolution of 
the monitor on which the picture is viewed.)
 
 If you’re a math lover, you may have noticed that all the size options 
create pictures that have an aspect ratio of 4:3, while your original 
images have an aspect ratio of 3:2. The camera trims the small-copy 
image as needed to fit the 4:3 proportions. Unfortunately, you don’t have 
any input over what portion of the image is cropped away.
 
6. Press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a screen asking you to confirm that you want to create a small 
copy.
 
7. Highlight Yes and press OK.
 
 The camera duplicates the selected image and downsamples the copy 
(eliminates pixels) to achieve the size you specified in Step 5. Your origi-
nal picture file remains untouched.
Figure 9-8: The Small Picture feature creates a low-resolution, e-mail-friendly copy of a photo.

256
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
If you want to create small copies of several photos on your memory card, 
you can go another route: Take the camera out of playback mode and then 
display the Retouch menu. Select the Small Picture option and press OK. On 
the next screen, select the Choose Size option and specify the pixel count for 
your small copies. After doing so, press OK, choose the Select Image option, 
and press OK again to display thumbnails of all your pictures. Move the yellow 
highlight box over a thumbnail and press the Zoom Out button to “tag” the 
photo for copying. (You see a little icon in the top-right corner of the thumb-
nail; press the button again to remove the tag if you change your mind.) After 
selecting all your pictures, press OK to display the copy-confirmation screen; 
highlight Yes and press OK once more to wrap things up.
When you view your small-size copies 
on the camera monitor, they appear 
surrounded by a gray border, as 
shown in Figure 9-9. A tiny Retouch 
icon appears on the display as well, 
as labeled in the figure. Note that you 
can’t zoom in to magnify the view 
of small-size copies as you can your 
original images.
Pictures that you create using the Small 
Picture feature are given filenames that 
start with the letters SSC. The camera 
automatically assigns a file number. 
(The number is different from that of 
your original file, unfortunately.)
Downsizing images in Nikon ViewNX
You can also create a low-resolution, JPEG copy of your image in ViewNX. 
However, be aware that the program restricts you to a minimum size of 320 
pixels along the photo’s longest side. If you need a smaller version, use the 
in-camera Small Picture option to create the copy instead. Or, if you own a 
photo editing program, investigate its image-resizing capabilities; you likely 
can create the small copy at any dimensions you like.
Assuming that the 320-pixel restriction isn’t a problem, the following steps 
show you how to create your small-size copy in ViewNX. You can use this 
process to create a small JPEG copy of both JPEG and NEF (RAW) originals.
 
1. Select the image thumbnail in the main ViewNX window.
 
 Chapter 8 explains how to view your image thumbnails, if you need help. 
Just click a thumbnail to select it.

Figure 9-9: The gray border indicates a small-
size copy.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
2.  Choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 You see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-10. (As with other figures, this 
one shows the box as it appears in Windows Vista; it may appear slightly 
different on a Mac or in other versions of Windows, but the essentials 
are the same.)
Figure 9-10: You also can use ViewNX to create a small-sized 
JPEG copy for e-mail sharing.
 
3. Select JPEG from the File Format drop-down list, as shown in the 
figure.
 
 The other format option, TIFF, is a print format. Web browsers and 
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF images, so be sure to use JPEG.
 
4. Select the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 Now the Long Edge and Short Edge text boxes become available. 
 
5. Type the desired pixel count of the longest side of your picture into 
the Long Edge box.

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 The program automatically adjusts the Short Edge value to keep the 
resized image proportional. (The image is not cropped to a 4:3 per-
spective as it is when you use the Small Copy feature on the camera’s 
Retouch menu.)
 
 Again, to ensure that the picture is viewable without scrolling when 
opened in the recipient’s e-mail program, I suggest that you keep the 
Long Edge value at 640 pixels or less.
 
6. Adjust the Quality slider to set the amount of JPEG file compression.
 
 As Chapter 3 explains, a greater degree of compression results in a 
smaller file, which takes less time to download over the Web, but it 
reduces image quality. Notice that as you move the slider to the right, 
the resulting quality level appears above the slider. For example, in 
Figure 9-10, the level is Excellent Quality.
 
 Because the resolution of your image already results in a very small file, 
you can probably use the highest quality setting without worrying too 
much about download times. The exception is if you plan to attach mul-
tiple pictures to the same e-mail message, in which case you may want 
to set the slider a notch or two down from the highest quality setting.
 
7. Select the next three check boxes (Remove Camera Setting 
Information, Remove XMP/IPTC Information, and Remove ICC Color 
Profile), as shown in Figure 9-10. 
 
 When selected, the three options save the resized picture without the 
original image metadata, the extra text data that your camera stores 
with the image. (Chapter 8 explains.) Including this metadata adds to the 
file size, so for normal e-mail sharing, strip it out. The exception is when 
you want the recipient to be able to view the metadata in a photo pro-
gram that can do so.
 
8. Set the file destination.
 
 In layman’s terms, that just means to tell the program the location of 
the folder or drive where you want to store your downsized image file. 
You have two Save In options: Choose the first option to put the file 
in the same folder as the original, or select Specified Folder to put the 
file somewhere else. If you choose the first option, you’re done. If you 
choose the second option, the last folder you specified is shown to the 
left of the Browse button. To choose a different folder, click that Browse 
button.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can create a new subfolder within your selected storage folder. 
If you do, the resized file goes into that subfolder, which you can name 
by clicking the Naming Options button.

259
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
9. (Optional) Specify a filename for the resized copy.
 
 If you want to put the small copy in the same folder as the original, the 
program protects you from overwriting the original by automatically 
assigning a slightly different name to the copy. By default, the program 
uses the original filename plus a two-number sequential tag: If the origi-
nal filename is DSC_0186.jpg, for example, the small-copy filename is 
DSC_0186_01.jpg. You can change a couple of aspects of this filenaming 
routine by selecting the Change File Names check box and then clicking 
the Naming Options button and adjusting the settings in the resulting 
dialog box. After making your wishes known, click OK to return to the 
Convert Files dialog box.
 
 If you don’t store the copy in the same folder as the original, the pro-
gram doesn’t alter the filename of the copy automatically. That can lead 
to problems down the road because you will end up with two files, both 
with the same name but with different pixel counts, on your computer. 
In this scenario, be sure to input your own filenames for your copies.
 
10. Click the Convert button to finish the process.
 
ViewNX also offers an e-mail wizard that enables you to resize and send 
photos by e-mail in one step. If you use this feature, however, you don’t 
create an actual small-size copy of your file; the program simply reduces the 
size of the file temporarily for e-mail transmission. Also, the wizard works 
only with certain e-mail programs. On the plus side, the wizard permits you 
to send a photo at a much smaller size than you can create with the Convert 
Files feature. For more details, check out the ViewNX Help system.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of 
photos, consider posting your images at an 
online photo-album site instead of attaching 
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites 
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all 
enable you to create digital photo albums and 
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your 
albums and images are deleted if you don’t 
order prints or make some other purchase 
from the site within a specified amount of time. 
Additionally, many free sites enable you to 
upload high-resolution files for printing but then 
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. 
(In other words, don’t think of album sites as 
archival storage solutions.) And here’s another 
little bit of fine print to investigate: The member-
ship agreement at some sites states that you 
agree to let the site use your photos, for free, 
for any purpose that it sees fit.

Creating a Digital Slide Show
Many photo editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a 
DVD player. You can even add music, captions, graphics, special effects, and 
the like to jazz up your presentations.
But if you want to create a simple slide show — that is, one that simply dis-
plays the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need 
a computer or any photo software. You can create and run the show right 
on your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined 
in the last section of this chapter, you can present your show to a whole 
roomful of people.
Follow these steps to create a simple slide show on your camera:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-11.
Figure 9-11: Choose Slide Show to set up automatic playback of all pictures on your memory 
card.
 
2. Press OK to display the Slide Show screen shown on the right in 
Figure 9-11.
 
3. Highlight Frame Interval and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 On the next screen, you can specify how long you want each image to be 
displayed. You can set the interval to 2, 3, 5, or 10 seconds.
 
4. Highlight the frame interval you want to use and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Slide Show screen.

261
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
5. To start the show, highlight Start and press OK.
 
 The camera begins displaying your pictures on the camera monitor.
When the show ends, you see a screen offering three options: You can 
choose to restart the show, adjust the frame interval, or exit to the Playback 
menu. Highlight your choice and press OK.
During the show, you can control playback as follows:
 
✓ Pause the show. Press OK. Select Restart and press OK to begin display-
ing pictures again. When you pause the slide show, you also have the 
option to change the interval — a handy option if the pace is too quick 
or slow — or exit the show. To change the frame interval, highlight the 
option and press OK. Choose the desired interval from the next screen 
and press OK. Highlight Restart and press OK to restart the show with 
the new interval.
 
✓ Exit the show. You’ve got three options: 
 
• To return to full-frame, regular playback, press the Playback 
button.
 
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button.
 
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway.
 
✓ Skip to the next/previous image manually. Press the Multi Selector or 
rotate the Command dial.
 
✓ Change the information displayed with the image. Press the Multi 
Selector up or down to cycle through the info-display modes. (See 
Chapter 4 for details on what information is provided in each mode.)
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Tired of passing your camera around to show people your pictures on 
the monitor? Why not display them on a television instead? Your D3000 is 
equipped with a video-out port for connecting the camera to a TV or other 
video device.
To take advantage of this option, you need to purchase a special video 
cable; the one that fits your D3000 goes by the Nikon part name Video Cable 
EG-D100. Unfortunately, the cable isn’t provided in the camera box, but at a 
price of around $10, it’s worth adding to your equipment bag.

With cable and camera in hand, take these steps to get set up for TV viewing:
 
1. Check the Video Mode setting 
on the Setup menu, shown in 
Figure 9-12.
 
 This setting determines what 
type of video signal the camera 
sends to the TV. You get just two 
options: NTSC and PAL. Select 
the video mode that is used 
by your part of the world. (In 
the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)
 
2. Turn off the camera and 
television.
 
3. Locate the video-out port on the camera.
 
 It’s tucked under the little rubber cover on the left-rear side of the 
camera and highlighted in Figure 9-13.
 
4. Connect the end of the cable that has the longer, narrower plug into 
the camera’s video-out port, labeled on the left in Figure 9-13.

5. Plug the other end of the cable into the video-in port on your televi-
sion, as shown in the right half of Figure 9-13.
 
 You can also insert the plug into the video-in port on a VCR or DVD 
player that’s connected to your TV. 
 
6. Turn both devices on.
 
7. Check your TV/VCR/DVD manual to find out what channel to select for 
playback of signals from auxiliary input devices like your camera. 
After you sort that issue out, you can control playback using the same 
camera controls as you normally do to view pictures on your camera moni-
tor. You can also run a slide show by following the steps outlined earlier in 
this chapter, in the section “Creating a Digital Slide Show.” And if you create a 
stop-motion movie, following the process laid out in Chapter 11, you can view 
that creative work on the TV as well.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits of 
information presented in the always popular “Top 
Ten” list format. Chapter 10 shows you how to do 
some minor picture touchups, such as cropping 
and adjusting exposure, by using tools on your 
camera’s Retouch menu. Following that, Chapter 
11 introduces you to ten camera functions that I 
consider specialty tools — bonus options that, 
while not at the top of the list of the features I 
suggest you study, are nonetheless interesting to 
explore when you have a free moment or two.

very photographer produces a clunker image now and then. When it 
happens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for the Delete 
button, because many common problems are surprisingly easy 
to fix. In fact, you often can repair your photos right in the 
camera, thanks to tools found on the Retouch menu. You 
can even create some special effects with a couple of 
the menu options.
This chapter offers step-by-step recipes for using 
ten of these photo-repair and enhancement fea-
tures. Additionally, I received special dispensation 
from the For Dummies folks to start things off with 
an additional section that summarizes tips that 
relate to all the Retouch menu options. In the words 
of Nigel Tufnel from the legendary rock band Spinal 
Tap, “This one goes to 11!”

Applying the Retouch Menu Filters
You can get to the Retouch menu features in two ways:
 
✓ Display the menu and select the tool you want to use, as shown on the 
left in Figure 10-1, and press OK. You’re then presented with thumb-
nails of your photos, as shown on the right in the figure. Use the Multi 
Selector to move the yellow highlight box over the photo you want to 
adjust and press OK. You next see options related to the selected tool.
Figure 10-1: From the Retouch menu, select the tool you want to apply and then choose the 
photo you want to edit.
 
 
✓ Switch the camera to playback mode, display the photo you want to 
alter in single-frame view, and press OK. (Remember, you can shift from 
thumbnail display to single-frame 
view simply by pressing the OK 
button.) The Retouch menu then 
appears superimposed over your 
photo, as shown in Figure 10-2. 
Select the tool you want to use 
and press OK again to access the 
tool options. Any tools that can’t 
be applied to the photo are 
dimmed. For example, if you 
didn’t use flash for your photo, 
the camera automatically dis-
ables the Red-Eye Correction 
tool, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2: In single-frame playback view, 
display the photo you want to alter and then 
press OK to bring up the Retouch menu.

269
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
I prefer the second method, so that’s how I approach things in this chapter, 
but it’s entirely a personal choice — well, almost, anyway. For two menu 
options, you have to take a specific path to the Retouch tools: 
 
✓ Image Overlay, which combines two photos to create a third, blended 
image, requires you to use the first method. Ditto for the Stop-Motion 
Movie feature. Chapter 11 explains both of those features.
 
✓ The Before and After option, which enables you to compare the original 
image and the retouched version side by side on the monitor, requires the 
second method. See the last section in this chapter details this feature. 
A few other critical factoids to note before you begin experimenting with the 
Retouch menu tools:
 
✓ Your originals remain intact. When you apply a correction or enhance-
ment from the Retouch menu, the camera creates a copy of your original 
photo and then makes the changes to the copy only. Your original is pre-
served untouched.
 
✓ The Image Overlay feature works only with NEF (RAW) files. The 
resulting picture is also saved in the NEF format. Chapter 3 explains the 
NEF file type.
 
✓ All other menu options work with JPEG or NEF originals, but the 
edited file is saved in the JPEG format. Again, see Chapter 3 for help 
understanding file formats.
 
✓ Except for Image Overlay pictures, edited files are assigned a filename 
that begins with a special three-letter code. The codes are as follows:
 
• SSC: Used for photos that you resize using the Small Picture func-
tion. Chapter 9 covers this feature, which is useful for creating 
low-resolution copies of your photos for e-mail sharing.
 
• CSC: Indicates that you applied one of the other Retouch menu 
corrections.
 
 As a reminder, original photos have filenames that begin either with DSC 
or _DSC. (The underscore at the front of the filename tells you that you 
recorded the photo using the Adobe RGB color mode, an option you can 
explore in Chapter 6.)
 
 Image Overlay pictures retain the original DSC or _DSC file prefix, which 
can make it difficult to distinguish them from a RAW original. The key 
is to look for the Retouch information during picture playback; see 
Chapter 4 to find out more about where to find this bit of data.
 
✓ File numbers of retouched copies don’t match those of the originals. 
Make note of the filename the retouched version is assigned so that you 
can easily track it down later. What numbering the camera chooses 
depends on the numbers of the files already on your memory card.

270
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the D3000. 
Typically, the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense: 
When little ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen, 
creating more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
If you spot a red-eye problem, however, give the Red-Eye Correction filter a try: 
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK.
 
 The Retouch menu appears over your photo. (Note that the Red-Eye 
Correction option appears dimmed in the menu for photos taken with-
out flash.)
 
2. Highlight Red-Eye Correction, as shown on the left in Figure 10-3, and 
press OK.
 
 If the camera detects red-eye, it applies the removal filter and displays 
the results in the monitor. If the camera can’t find any red-eye, it dis-
plays a message telling you so.
 
3. Carefully inspect the repair.
 
i  
 Press the Zoom In button to magnify the display so that you can check 
the camera’s work, as shown on the right in Figure 10-3. To scroll the 
display, press the Multi Selector up, down, right, or left. The yellow box 
in the tiny navigation window in the lower-right corner of the screen 
indicates the area of the picture that you’re currently viewing.
 
4. If you approve of the correction, press OK twice.
 
 The first OK returns the display to normal magnification; the second 
creates the retouched copy.
 
5. If you’re not happy with the results, press OK to return to normal 
magnification. Then press the Playback button to cancel the repair.
Figure 10-3: An automated red-eye remover is built right into your camera.

271
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
If the in-camera red-eye repair fails you, most photo editing programs 
have red-eye removal tools that should enable you to get the job done. 
Unfortunately, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal 
tools know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes 
typically turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The easiest solu-
tion is to use the brush tool found in most photo editors to paint in the 
proper eye colors.
Shadow Recovery with D-Lighting
Chapter 5 introduces you to a feature called Active D-Lighting. If you turn on 
this option when you shoot a picture, the camera captures the image in a way 
that brightens the darkest parts of the image, bringing shadow detail into the 
light but leaving highlight details intact. It’s a great trick for dealing with high-
contrast scenes or subjects that are backlit.
You also can apply a similar adjustment after you take a picture by choosing 
the D-Lighting option on the Retouch menu. I did just that for the photo in 
Figure 10-4, where strong backlighting left the balloon underexposed in the 
original image.

D-Lighting, High
Figure 10-4: An underexposed photo (left) gets help from the D-Lighting filter (right).
Here’s how to apply the filter:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image mode and then press OK to display 
the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight D-Lighting, as shown on the left in Figure 10-5, and press OK.

 You see a thumbnail of your original image along with a second thumb-
nail previewing the D-Lighting effect, as shown in the right image in 
Figure 10-5.
 
3. Select the level of adjustment by pressing the Multi Selector up or 
down.
 
 You get three levels: Low, Normal, and High. I used High for the repair to 
my balloon image.
 
i  
 To get a closer view of the adjusted photo, press and hold the Zoom In 
button. Release the button to return to the two-thumbnail display.
 
4. To go forward with the correction, press OK.
 
 The camera creates your retouched copy.
 
Note that you can’t apply D-Lighting to an image if you captured the photo 
with the Picture Control feature set to Monochrome. (See Chapter 6 for 
details on Picture Controls.) Nor does D-Lighting work on any pictures to 
which you’ve applied the Quick Retouch filter, covered next, or the 
Monochrome filter, detailed a little later in this chapter. 
Boosting Shadows, Contrast, 
and Saturation Together
The Quick Retouch filter increases contrast and saturation and, if your sub-
ject is backlit, also applies a D-Lighting adjustment to restore some shadow 
detail that otherwise might be lost. In other words, Quick Retouch is sort of 
like D-Lighting on steroids.

273
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
Figure 10-6 illustrates the difference 
between the two filters. The first 
example shows my original, a close-up 
shot of a tree bud about to emerge. 
I applied the D-Lighting filter to the 
second example, which brightened the 
darkest areas of the image. In the final 
example, I applied the Quick Retouch 
filter. Again, shadows got a slight bump 
up the brightness scale. But the filter 
also increased color saturation and 
adjusted the overall image to expand 
the tonal range across the entire 
brightness spectrum, from very dark to 
very bright. In this photo, the satura-
tion change is most noticeable in the 
yellows and reds of the tree bud. (The 
sky color may initially appear to be less 
saturated, but in fact, it’s just a lighter 
hue than the original, thanks to the 
contrast adjustment.)
To try the filter out, display your 
photo in single-image playback mode 
and press OK to bring up the Retouch 
menu. Highlight Quick Retouch, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-7, and 
press OK to display the right screen in 
the figure.
As with the D-Lighting filter, you can 
set the level of adjustment to Low, 
Normal, or High. Just press the Multi 
Selector up or down to change the 
setting. (For my example photos, I 
applied both the D-Lighting and Quick 
Retouch filters at the Normal level.) 
Press OK to finalize the job and create 
your retouched copy.
 
Note that the same issues related to 
D-Lighting, spelled out in the preced-
ing section, apply here as well: You 
can’t apply the Quick Retouch filter to 
monochrome images. Additionally, 
you can’t apply the Quick Retouch

filter to a retouched copy that you created by applying the D-Lighting filter, 
and vice versa. However, you can create two retouched copies of your origi-
nal image, applying D-Lighting to one and Quick Retouch to the other. You 
then can use the Before and After feature, explained at the end of this chap-
ter, to compare the retouched versions to see which one you prefer.
Figure 10-7: Press the Multi Selector up or down to adjust the amount of the correction.
Two Ways to Tweak Color
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance and Picture 
Control features to manipulate photo colors. But even if you play with those 
settings all day, you may wind up with colors that you’d like to tweak just a tad.
You can boost color saturation with the Quick Retouch filter, explained in the 
preceding section. But that tool also adjusts contrast and, depending on the 
photo, also applies a D-Lighting correction. With the Filter Effects and Color 
Balance tools, however, you can manipulate color only. The next two sections 
tell all.
Applying digital lens filters
Shown in Figure 10-8, the Filter Effects option offers five color-manipulation 
filters that are designed to mimic the results produced by traditional lens 
filters. The other two filters on the menu, Cross Screen and Soft Focus, are 
special-effects filters; you can read about Cross Screen in Chapter 11 and 
explore Soft Focus later in this chapter.
The five color-shifting filters work like so:
 
✓ Skylight filter: This filter reduces the amount of blue in an image. The 
result is a very subtle warming effect. That is, colors take on a bit of a 
reddish cast.

275
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
✓ Warm filter: This one produces a warming effect that’s just a bit stron-
ger than the Skylight filter.
 
✓ Color intensifiers: You can boost the intensity of reds, greens, or blues 
individually by applying these filters. 
Figure 10-8: You can choose from seven effects that mimic traditional lens filters.
As an example, Figure 10-9 shows you an original image and three adjusted ver-
sions. As you can see, the Skylight and Warm filters are both very subtle; in this 
image, the effects are most noticeable in the sky. The fourth example shows a 
variation created by using the Color Balance filter, explained in the next section, 
and shifting colors toward the cool (bluish) side of the color spectrum.
Follow these steps to apply the Filter Effects color tools:
 
1. Display your photo in single-frame playback mode and press OK to 
display the Retouch menu. 
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects and press OK.
 
 You see the list of available filters. (Refer to Figure 10-8.)
 
3. Highlight the filter you want to use and press OK.
 
 The camera displays a preview of how your photo will look if you apply 
the filter.
 
4. To apply the Skylight or Warm filter, press OK.
 
 Or press the Playback button if you want to cancel the filter application. 
You can’t adjust the intensity of these two filters.
 
5. For the color-intensifier filters, press the Multi Selector up or down to 
specify the amount of color shift. Then press OK.

Manipulating color balance
The Color Balance tool enables you to adjust colors with more finesse than the 
Filter Effects options. With this filter, you can shift colors toward any part of 
the color spectrum. For example, shifting colors toward the cooler — bluer — 
spectrum produced the fourth example in Figure 10-9.
Take these steps to give it a whirl:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK.
 
 Up pops the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Color Balance, as shown on the left in Figure 10-10.

3. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure.
 
 The important control here is the color grid in the lower-left corner. 
Notice the tiny black square inside the grid, labeled color shift marker in 
the figure. 
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to move the color-shift marker in the direction 
of the color adjustment you want to make.
 
 Press up to make the image more green, press right to make it more 
red, and so on. In the figure, I positioned the marker to emphasize blue 
tones, for example.
 
 The histograms on the right side of the display show you the resulting 
impact on overall image brightness, as well as on the individual red, 
green, and blue brightness values — a bit of information that’s helpful 
if you’re an experienced student in the science of reading histograms. 
(Chapter 4 gives you an introduction.) If not, just check the image pre-
view to monitor your results.
 
5. Press OK to create the color-adjusted copy of your photo.
Creating Monochrome Photos
With the Monochrome Picture Control feature covered in Chapter 6, you 
can shoot black-and-white photos. Technically, the camera takes a full-color 
picture and then strips it of color as it’s recording the image to the memory 
card, but the end result is the same.

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As an alternative, you can create a black-and-white copy of an existing color 
photo by applying the Monochrome option on the Retouch menu. You can 
also create sepia and cyanotype (blue and white) images via the Monochrome 
option. Figure 10-11 shows you examples of all three effects.

 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
I prefer to convert my color photos to monochrome images in my photo 
editor; going that route simply offers more control, not to mention the fact 
that it’s easier to preview your results on a large computer monitor than on 
the camera monitor. Still, I know that not everyone’s as much of a photo edit-
ing geek as I am, so I present to you here the steps involved in applying the 
Monochrome effects to a color original in your camera:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to bring the 
Retouch menu to life, as shown on the left in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12: Select a filter and press OK to start the process.
 
2. Highlight Monochrome and press OK to display the three effect 
options, as shown on the right in the figure.
 
3. Highlight the effect that you want to apply and press OK.
 
 You then see a preview of the image with your selected photo filter 
applied.
 
4. To adjust the intensity of the sepia or cyanotype effect, press the Multi 
Selector up or down.
 
 No adjustment is available for the black-and-white filter.
 
5. Press OK to create the monochrome copy.
Softening Focus for a Dreamy Effect
Ever notice that as television and movie stars age, their portraits tend to 
have a slightly out-of-focus look? The soft focus effect is designed to help 
mask wrinkles and other signs that one is no longer a dewy-faced teen.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You actually can buy special 
lenses for your camera that 
produce this effect, but a 
cheaper alternative is to apply a 
focus-softening digital filter like 
the one found on the D3000’s 
Retouch menu. You can see the 
results in Figure 10-13. When 
applied to nature subjects like 
the one in the figure, the filter 
creates a look that’s similar to 
the artistic-effects filters you 
find in many photo editing 
programs. Squint hard enough, 
and you can almost envision a 
Monet in the making.
Apply the filter like so:
 
1. Display your photo in 
single-image playback 
mode and press OK to call 
up the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects, 
press OK, and then high-
light Soft as shown in 
Figure 10-14.
 
3. Press OK.
 
 You see thumbnails of your photo, as shown in Figure 10-15. The left 
thumbnail is the original; the right thumbnail offers a preview of the 
filter effect.

4. Press the Multi Selector up or 
down to determine how soft you 
want the image.
 
 Your choices are Low (kinda 
soft), Normal (softer still), and 
High (pass the foggy goggles). 
While you’re pondering your 
decision, you can press the Zoom 
In button to get a better look.
 
5. Press OK to apply the filter.
Creating a Color Outline
As hard as I try, I cannot master the skill of drawing. In fact, most 3-year-olds 
can render a scene with more accuracy than I can. But thanks to the Color 
Outline option on the Retouch menu, I can “fake” a realistic drawing based on 
any photo, as I did in Figure 10-16. This is a fun project to do with kids, by the 
way — you can, in essence, create a custom coloring-book page that they can 
then fill in with watercolors, crayons, or markers.
Figure 10-16: You can use a photo as the basis for a color outline.
Figure 10-15: Press the Multi Selector up or 
down to choose the strength of the effect.

Try it out:
 
1. Display your photo in single-
image playback mode and press 
OK to display the Retouch menu 
over the image.
 
2. Highlight Color Outline, as 
shown in Figure 10-17, and 
press OK.
 
 A preview of your art master-
piece appears onscreen.
 
3. Press OK again.
 
 The camera software creates a 
copy of your image with the effect applied.
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Cropping 
away excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by 
Figures 10-18 and 10-19. When shooting this scene, I couldn’t get close 
enough to the ducks to fill the frame with them, so I simply cropped it after 
the fact to achieve the desired composition.
Figure 10-18: The original contains too much extraneous background.
Figure 10-17: Choose Color Outline and then 
press OK to create the effect.

283
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
Figure 10-19: Cropping creates a better composition and 
eliminates background clutter.
With the Trim function on the Retouch menu, you can crop a photo right in 
the camera. Note a few things about this feature:
 
✓ You can crop your photo to five different aspect ratios: 3:2, which main-
tains the original proportions and matches that of a 4 x 6-inch print; 4:3, 
the proportions of a standard computer monitor or television (that is, not 
a wide-screen model); 5:4, which gives you the same proportions as an 8 
x 10-inch print; 1:1, which results in a square photo; and 16:9, which is the 
same aspect ratio as a wide-screen monitor or television. If your purpose 
for cropping is to prepare your image for a frame size that doesn’t match 
any of these aspect ratios, crop in your photo software instead.
 
✓ For each aspect ratio, you can choose from six crop sizes. The sizes 
are stated in pixel terms — for example, if you select the 3:2 aspect 
ratio, you can crop the photo to measurements of 3424 x 2280 pixels, 
2560 x 1704 pixels, 1920 x 1280 pixels, 1280 x 856 pixels, 960 x 640 
pixels, and 640 x 424 pixels. 
 
✓ After you apply the Trim function, you can’t apply any other fixes from 
the Retouch menu. So make cropping the last of your retouching steps.
Keeping those caveats in mind, trim your image as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to launch the 
Retouch menu.

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Highlight Trim, as shown on the left in Figure 10-20, and press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the right side of the figure. The yellow 
highlight box indicates the current cropping frame. Anything outside the 
frame is set to be trimmed away.
 
3. Rotate the Command dial to change the crop aspect ratio.
 
 The selected aspect ratio appears in the upper-right corner of the 
screen, as shown on the right in Figure 10-20.

Figure 10-20: Rotate the Command dial to change the proportions of the crop box.
 
4. Adjust the cropping frame size and placement as needed.
 
 The current crop size appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 10-20.) You can adjust the size and placement of the 
cropping frame like so:
 
? 
• Reduce the size of the cropping frame. Press and release the Zoom 
Out button. Each press of the button further reduces the crop size.
 
i  
• Enlarge the cropping frame. Press the Zoom In button to expand the 
crop boundary and leave more of your image intact.
 
• Reposition the cropping frame. Press the Multi Selector up, down, 
right, and left to shift the frame position.
 
5. Press OK to create your cropped copy of the original image.
Comparing Your Original and Retouched Photos
Through the Before and After option on the Retouch menu, you can easily com-
pare the original and retouched views of your photos. Here’s how it works:

285
 Chapter 10: Ten Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
1. Display either the original or edited picture in single-image view.
 
2. Press OK to display the Retouch menu over your photo.
 
3. Highlight Before and After, as shown on the left in Figure 10-21, and 
press OK.
 
 Now you see the original image in the left half of the frame, with the 
retouched version on the right, as shown in the second screen in the 
figure. At the top of the screen, you see labels that indicate the Retouch 
tool that you applied to the photo (Filter Effects, in Figure 10-21).
Figure 10-21: Use the Before and After option to see whether you prefer the retouched version 
of a photo to the original.
 
 If you apply more than one Retouch tool to the same picture, press the 
Multi Selector right and left to see thumbnails that show you how each 
tool affected the picture. For example, if you apply the Monochrome filter 
and then use the Trim feature to crop the monochrome copy, the first 
thumbnail shows your original, the second one shows the monochrome 
copy, and the third one shows the cropped monochrome version.
 
 If you create multiple retouched versions of the same original — for 
example, if you create a monochrome version, save that, and then crop 
the original image and save that — you use a different technique to com-
pare all the versions. First, press the Multi Selector right or left to sur-
round the After image with the yellow highlight box. Now press the Multi

Ten Special-Purpose Features 
to Explore on a Rainy Day
In This Chapter
▶ Adding text comments to images
▶ Creating custom image-storage folders
▶ Changing the function of some controls
▶ Combining two photos into one
▶ Building a stop-motion movie from still images
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of those 
late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host 
exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the category of 
“interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of features that 
drive people to choose one camera over another, and 
they may come in handy only for certain users, on 
certain occasions. Still, they’re included at no extra 
charge with your camera purchase, so check ’em out 
when you have a few spare moments. Who knows; 
you may discover that one of these bonus features is 
actually a hidden gem that provides just the solution 
you need for one of your photography problems.
Annotate Your Images
Through the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu, you can 
add text comments to your picture files. Suppose, for example, that you’re 
traveling on vacation and visiting a different destination every day. You can 

288
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
annotate all the pictures you take on a particular outing with the name of 
the location or attraction. You can then view the comments either in Nikon 
ViewNX, which ships free with your camera, or Capture NX 2, which you 
must buy separately. The comments also appear in some other photo pro-
grams that enable you to view metadata.
Here’s how the Image Comment feature works:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Image Comment, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1: You can tag pictures with text comments that you can view in Nikon ViewNX.
 
2. Press OK to display the right screen in the figure.
 
3. Highlight Input Comment and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see a keyboard-type 
screen like the one shown in 
Figure 11-2.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to high-
light the first letter of the text 
you want to add.
 
 If you scroll the display, you can 
access lowercase letters in addi-
tion to the uppercase ones shown 
on the initial screen.
 
i  
5. Press the Zoom In button to 
enter that letter into the display 
box at the bottom of the screen.
 
 
6. Keep highlighting letters and 
pressing the Zoom In button to continue entering your comment.
Figure 11-2: Highlight a letter and press 
the Zoom In button to enter it into the 
comment box.

289
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
 Your comment can be up to 36 characters long. 
 
 To move the text cursor, rotate the Command dial in the direction you 
want to shift the cursor. 
 
 
 To delete a letter, move the cursor under the offending letter and then 
press the Delete button.
 
 
7. To save the comment, press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Image Comment menu.
 
8. Highlight Attach Comment and press the Multi Selector right to put a 
check mark in the box, as shown on the left in Figure 11-3.
 
 The check mark turns the Image Comment feature on.
Figure 11-3: Be sure to select Done and press OK before exiting the menu.
 
9. Highlight Done, as shown on the right in Figure 11-3, and press OK to 
wrap things up.
 
 You’re returned to the Setup menu. The Image Comment menu item 
should now be set to On.
 
The camera applies your comment to all pictures you take after turning on 
Image Comment. To disable the feature, revisit the Image Comment menu, 
highlight Attach Comment, and press the Multi Selector right to toggle the 
check mark off. Select Done and press OK to make your decision official.
To view comments in Nikon ViewNX, display the Metadata tab. (Click the 
tab on the left side of the program window.) Select an image by clicking its 
thumbnail. The Image Comment text appears in the File Info 2 section of the 
tab, in the area highlighted in Figure 11-4. (If the panel is closed, click the 
little triangle next to File Info 2.) See Chapter 8 for more details about using 
ViewNX.

Figure 11-4: Comments appear with other metadata in Nikon ViewNX.
Creating Custom Image Folders
By default, your camera initially stores all your images in one folder, which 
it names 100D3000. Folders have a storage limit of 999 images; when you 
exceed that number, the camera creates a new folder, assigning a name that 
indicates the folder number — 101D3000, 102D3000, and so on. You see the 
full name of the default folders when you view the memory card contents on 
your computer. While viewing pictures on the camera, you see only a single 
folder, named D3000, that holds all your pictures, even after you exceed 999 
photos and the camera creates a second folder for you.
If you choose, however, you can create your own, custom-named folders. 
For example, perhaps you sometimes use your camera for business and 
sometimes for personal use. To keep your images separate, you can set up 
one folder named DULL and one named FUN — or perhaps something less 
incriminating, such as WORK and HOME.

291
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Whatever your folder-naming idea, you create custom folders like so:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Active Folder, as shown on the 
left in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-5: You can create custom folders to organize your images right on the camera.
 
2. Press OK to display the screen 
shown on the right in Figure 11-5.
 
3. Highlight New and press the 
Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a keyboard-style screen 
similar to the one used to create 
image comments, as described 
at the start of the chapter. The 
folder-naming version appears in 
Figure 11-6.
 
4. Enter a folder name up to five 
characters long.
 
 Use these techniques:
 
i  
• To enter a letter, highlight it by using the Multi Selector. Then 
press the Zoom In button.
 
 
• To move the text cursor, rotate the Command dial in the direction 
you want to move the cursor.
 
 
• To delete a letter, place the cursor under it and press the Delete 
button.
Figure 11-6: Folder names can contain up to 
five characters.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
5. After creating your folder name, press OK to complete the process and 
return to the Setup menu.
 
 The folder you just created is automatically selected as the active folder.
 
If you take advantage of this option, remember to specify where you want 
your pictures stored each time you shoot: Select Active Folder from the 
Setup menu and press OK to display the screen shown on the left in Figure 
11-7. Highlight Select Folder and press the Multi Selector right to display a 
list of all your folders, as shown on the right in the figure. Highlight the folder 
that you want to use and press OK. Your choice also affects which images 
you can view in playback mode; see Chapter 4 to find out how to select the 
folder you want to view.
Figure 11-7: Remember to specify where you want to store new images.
If necessary, you can rename a custom folder by using the Rename option on 
the Active Folder screen. (Refer to the left screen in Figure 11-7.) The Delete 
option on the same screen enables you to get rid of all empty folders on the 
memory card.
Changing the Function Button’s Function
 
Fn
 Tucked away on the left-front side of the camera, just under the Flash button, 
the Function (Fn) button is set by default to activate Self-Timer Shooting for 
your next picture. But if you don’t use that function often, you may want to 
assign some other purpose to the button. 
You establish the button’s behavior via the Buttons option on the Setup 
menu, shown on the left in Figure 11-8. After selecting the option, press OK 
to display the second screen in the figure. Then choose the Self-Timer/Fn 
Button option, as shown on the right in the figure. You’re presented with 
a list of possible button functions, as shown in Figure 11-9. Here’s a quick 
description of the possible settings: 

293
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-8: You can assign any number of jobs to the Function button.
 
✓ Self-Timer: The default option 
actives Self-Timer shooting with 
the current specified time delay. 
The Self-Timer mode applies 
only to your next shot, however. 
(You adjust the self-timer delay 
through the Self-Timer Delay 
option on the Setup menu.)
 
✓ Release Mode: If you select this 
option, pressing the Fn button 
while turning the Command 
dial lets you choose the desired 
Release mode.
 
✓ Image Quality/Size: If you select 
this option, pressing the Fn button 
while turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired image quality 
and size.
 
✓ ISO Sensitivity: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired ISO setting.
 
✓ White Balance: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired white balance 
setting in P, S, A, and M modes. (You can’t adjust white balance in the 
other exposure modes.)
 
✓ Active-D Lighting: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you turn Active D-Lighting on and off.
 
✓ Set Framing Grid: When the button is set to this function, you can 
toggle the viewfinder grid display on and off by pressing the button and 
rotating the Command dial. See Chapter 1 for more details about the 
viewfinder grid.
Figure 11-9: The default option enables you to 
use the Function button to turn on Self-Timer 
shooting for your next picture.

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
After selecting the function you want to assign, press OK to lock in your 
choice.
Customizing the AE-L/AF-L Button
 
 Set just to the right of the viewfinder, the AE-L/AF-L button enables you to 
lock focus and exposure settings when you shoot in autoexposure and auto-
focus modes, as explored in Chapters 5 and 6. 
Normally, autofocus and autoexposure are locked when you press the 
button, and they remain locked as long as you keep your finger on the button. 
But you can change the button’s behavior via the Buttons option on the 
Setup menu, as shown on the left in Figure 11-10. After highlighting the AE-L/
AF-L option, as shown on the right, press OK to display the available settings, 
shown in Figure 11-11.
Figure 11-10: You can change the function of the AE-L/AF-L button through the Setup menu.
The options produce these results:
 
✓ AE/AF Lock: This is the default 
setting. Focus and exposure 
remain locked as long as you 
press the button.
 
✓ AE Lock Only: Autoexposure is 
locked as long as you press the 
button; autofocus isn’t affected. 
(You can still lock focus by 
pressing the shutter button 
halfway.)
Figure 11-11: At the default setting, highlighted 
here, the button locks exposure and focus 
together.

295
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
✓ AF Lock Only: Focus remains locked as long as you press the button. 
Exposure isn’t affected.
 
✓ AE Lock (Hold): This one locks exposure only with a single press of the 
button. The exposure lock remains in force until you press the button 
again or the exposure meters turn off.
 
✓ AF-ON: Pressing the button activates the camera’s autofocus mecha-
nism. If you choose this option, you can’t lock autofocus by pressing the 
shutter button halfway.
After highlighting the option you want to use, press OK.
 
The information that I give in this book with regard to using autofocus 
and autoexposure assumes that you stick with the default setting. So if 
you change the button’s function, remember to amend my instructions 
accordingly.
Using the Shutter Button to 
Lock Exposure and Focus
The Buttons option on the Setup menu offers a third button tweak called AE 
Lock, as shown in Figure 11-12. This option determines whether pressing the 
shutter button halfway locks focus only or locks both focus and exposure.
Figure 11-12: If you turn this option on, pressing the shutter button halfway locks exposure 
and focus.
At the default setting, Off, you lock focus only when you press the shutter 
button halfway. Exposure is adjusted continually up to the time you take the 
shot. If you change the AE Lock setting to On, your half-press of the shutter 
button locks both focus and exposure. 

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
As with the AE-L/AF-L button adjustment described in the preceding section, 
I recommend that you leave this option set to the default while you’re work-
ing with this book. Otherwise, your camera won’t behave as described here 
(or in the camera manual, for that matter). If you encounter a situation that 
calls for locking exposure and focus together, you can simply use the AE-L/
AF-L button as covered in Chapter 5.
Controlling Flash Output Manually
By default, your camera automatically adjusts the output of its built-in flash 
based on the ambient light so that you wind up with a proper exposure. But 
if you’re experienced in the way of the flash, you do have the option of manu-
ally setting the flash output when you shoot in the P, S, A, and M exposure 
modes. To do so, take these steps:
 
1. Display the Shooting menu and select Built-in Flash, as shown on the 
left in Figure 11-13.
 
2. Press OK.
 
 The options shown on the right in Figure 11-13 appear.
 
 The TTL setting is the default flash setting, in which the camera sets the 
proper flash power for you. TTL stands for through the lens.
Figure 11-13: Through this option, you can control the Flash output manually.
 
3. Highlight Manual and press OK. 
 
 Now the menu shown in Figure 11-14 appears. 
 
4. Highlight the desired flash output and press OK.

297
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
 Your options are from 1/32 power 
to Full power. The next time you 
use the built-in flash, it emits a 
burst of light at the power you 
specify.
Adjusting flash power this way is 
a little cumbersome and, again, 
requires some lighting expertise to 
use properly. So remember that you 
can also keep the flash in auto mode 
(TTL mode) and then use the Flash 
Compensation control to bump the 
flash power up or down a few notches 
from what the camera’s metering 
system thinks is appropriate. Of course, if you want to get really tricky, you 
can employ Flash Compensation even with manual flash control. See Chapter 
5 for details on Flash Compensation.
Adding a Starburst Effect
Want to give your photo a little extra sparkle? Experiment with your D3000’s 
Cross Screen filter. This filter adds a starburst-like effect to the brightest 
areas of your image, as illustrated in Figure 11-15.
Original

Figure 11-15: The Cross Screen filter adds a starburst effect.
Figure 11-14: Specify the amount of light you 
want the flash to emit.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Traditional photographers create this effect by placing a special filter over 
the camera lens; the filter is sometimes known as a Star filter instead of a 
Cross Screen filter. With your D3000, you can apply a digital version of the 
filter via the Retouch menu, as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK to 
call up the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects, as shown on the left in Figure 11-16, and 
press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-16.
Figure 11-16: Select the filter from the Filter Effects submenu.
 
3. Highlight Cross Screen and press OK. 
 
 Now you see a screen containing a preview that shows you the results 
of the Cross Screen filter at the current filter settings, as shown in 
Figure 11-17.
 
4. Adjust the filter settings as needed.
 
 You can adjust the number of points on the star, the strength of the 
effect, the length of the star’s rays, and the angle of the effect. Just 
use the Multi Selector to highlight an option and then press the Multi 
Selector right to display the available settings. Highlight your choice and 
press OK. I labeled the four options in Figure 11-17.
 
5. To update the preview after changing a filter setting, highlight 
Confirm and press OK. 
 
i  
 You can also press and hold the Zoom In button to temporarily view 
your image in full-screen view. Release the button to return to the 
normal preview.
 
 
6. Highlight Save and press OK to create your star-crossed image.

299

Number of points
Filter intensity
Filter angle
Length of points
Figure 11-17: You can play with four filter settings to tweak the effect.
Keep in mind that the number of starbursts the filter applies depends on 
your image. You can’t change that number; the camera automatically adds 
the twinkle effect wherever it finds very bright objects. If you want to control 
the exact placement of the starbursts, you may want to forgo the in-camera 
filter and find out whether your photo software offers a more flexible star-
filter effect. (You can also create the effect manually by painting the cross 
strokes onto the image in your photo editor.) 
 
It’s also important to frame your original image with a little extra “head 
room” around the object that will get the starburst, as I did in my examples. 
Otherwise, there won’t be room in the picture for the effect.
Combining Two Photos with Image Overlay
Are you into double exposures? Well, you can’t officially do a double expo-
sure with the D3000, but the Image Overlay feature found on the Retouch 
menu enables you to merge two photographs into one. I used this option to 
combine a photo of a werewolf friend, shown on the top left in Figure 11-18, 
with a nighttime garden scene, shown on the top right. The result is the 
ghostly image shown beneath the two originals. Oooh, scary!
On the surface, this option sounds kind of cool. The problem is that you can’t 
control the opacity or positioning of the individual images in the combined 
photo. For example, my overlay picture would have been more successful if 
I could move the werewolf to the left in the combined image so that he and 
the lantern aren’t blended. And I’d also prefer to keep the background of the 
second image at full opacity in the overlay image rather than getting a 50:50 
mix of that background and the one in the first image, which only creates a 
fuzzy-looking background in this particular example.

300
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-18: Image Overlay merges two RAW (NEF) photos into one.
However, there is one effect that you can create successfully with Image 
Overlay: a “two views” composite like the one in Figure 11-19. But in order 
for this trick to work, the background in both images must be the same solid 
color (black seems to be best), and you must compose your photos so that 
the subjects don’t overlap in the combined photo, as shown here. Otherwise, 
you get the ghostly effect like you see in Figure 11-18.
 
Additionally, the Image Overlay feature works only with pictures that you 
shoot in the Camera RAW (NEF) format. For details on RAW, see Chapter 3. 
The resulting image is also created in the RAW format, which means that you 
have to use a RAW processor to convert it into an actual image file before 
you can print or share it. Chapter 8 has details on that issue.
To be honest, I don’t use Image Overlay for the purpose of serious photo 
compositing. I prefer to do this kind of work in my photo editing software, 
where I have more control over the blend. In addition, previewing the 
results of the overlay settings you use is difficult, given the size of the 
camera monitor.

301
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-19: If you want each subject to appear solid, use a black background and position 
the subjects so that they don’t overlap.
That said, it’s a fun project to try, so give it a go when you have a spare 
minute. Take these steps:
 
1. Display the Retouch menu and highlight Image Overlay, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-20.
 
 You can’t get to this option if you use the other method of applying 
Retouch commands — displaying your photo first and then pressing OK. 
You must start at the Retouch menu itself. (See Chapter 10 for help with 
using the Retouch menu features.)
 
2. Press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-20, with the preview 
area for Image 1 highlighted. (The yellow border indicates the active 
preview area.)
 
3. Press OK to display thumbnails of your images.
 
4. Select the first of the two images that you want to combine.
 
 A yellow border surrounds the currently selected thumbnail. Press the 
Multi Selector right and left to scroll the display until the border appears 
around your chosen image. Then press OK.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-20: The thumbnail marked with the yellow border represents the active image.
 
 The Image Overlay screen now displays your first image as Image 1, as 
shown on the left in Figure 11-21.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select the second image.
 
 Now you see both images in the Image Overlay screen, with the com-
bined result appearing in the Preview area, as shown on the right in 
Figure 11-21.
Figure 11-21: After selecting both photos, highlight the Preview thumbnail and press the Zoom 
In button to preview the results.
 
6. Press the Multi Selector right to move the yellow selection box over 
the Preview thumbnail.
 
i  
7. Press the Zoom In button to get a full-frame view of the merged image.
 
 
 Or highlight Overlay and press OK to see the preview.

303

? 
 If you aren’t happy with the result, press the Zoom Out button to exit 
the preview. Then adjust the gain setting underneath the image thumb-
nails to manipulate the combined image. Press the Multi Selector right 
or left to highlight Image 1 or Image 2 and then press up or down to 
adjust the gain for that image. 
 
8. To save the merged image, highlight Save (in the Preview thumbnail 
area, as shown on the right in Figure 11-21) and press OK.
 
 Again, the combined image is created in the Camera RAW (NEF) format. 
Turning Still Photos into a Stop-Motion Movie
By using the Stop-Motion Movie feature on the Retouch menu, you can com-
bine a series of still images into your very own movie. More precisely, you 
can create brief, animation-style digital videos that can be played on the com-
puter. You also can connect your camera to a TV for playback; see the last 
section in Chapter 9 for details.
One popular use of this feature is to animate still objects, similar to what 
Hollywood-types do when producing so-called “claymation” movies. Here’s 
an example: You take 50 shots of a riderless tricycle on your driveway. Before 
each shot, you rotate the pedals slightly to move the bike forward so that each 
image captures the bike at a different spot on the driveway. In your finished 
movie, the individual images are displayed sequentially, at a pace rapid enough 
to create the illusion that the bike is moving across the driveway by itself, as if 
it had a ghost rider.
You can also use the Stop-Motion Movie feature to reanimate a subject that 
was actually moving of its own volition during your shoot. For example, on 
a recent trip to a local garden, I spotted a butterfly posing on a leaf. As he 
opened and closed his wings, I clicked off a rapid-fire series of images so that 
I could capture his wings at different positions. Turned into a stop-motion 
movie, the images blended together to reproduce the fluttering of the butter-
fly’s wings.
Lest you get the wrong idea here, I should stress that the Stop-Motion Movie 
feature isn’t designed to replace a real video or movie camera. First, the stop-
motion movies you can produce on your D3000 can be recorded and played 
at a maximum of 15 frames per second, whereas the standard for motion-
picture films is 24 frames per second; video, 30 frames per second. The dif-
ference means that your stop-motion movies appear a little jerky — more like 
what you see when you fast-forward through a movie on DVD — and not like 
the smooth, seamless scenes you watch on your TV or at the local cineplex.

304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Second, the D3000 limits the number of images in a movie to 100. So if you 
have 100 frames, played back at 15 frames per second, the maximum length 
of your stop-motion movie is just shy of 7 seconds. If you want a longer 
movie, you need to create separate movie files and then join them together in 
a video editing program. (If you have such a program, you may find it easier 
to just import your images into it and join them together there instead of 
doing the job in the camera.) 
Despite its limitations, though, the Stop-Motion Movie feature provides an 
interesting creative option for a slow day. And if all this frames-per-second 
and other movie talk has you a little confused, don’t worry. After you create 
your first movie, which I show you how to do in the upcoming steps, every-
thing should become clear. It’s one of those things that’s much easier to do 
than to describe in text, especially since I can’t provide a little sample movie 
player and movie on this page.
To get started, first record a series of images of a moving subject. You can 
either stage the movement, as in my tricycle illustration, or capture a real 
moving object like my butterfly.
 
Try setting your camera’s Release mode to Continuous if you’re shooting 
a moving subject. In this mode, explained at the end of Chapter 2, you can 
record multiple images with one press of the shutter button. See Chapter 7 
for more tips on capturing action.
After you have your images recorded, take these steps to turn them into a 
movie:
 
1. Open the Retouch menu, high-
light Stop-Motion Movie, as 
shown in Figure 11-22, and 
press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the 
left in Figure 11-23.
 
 As with the Image Overlay fea-
ture, you can access the Stop-
Motion Movie option only by 
pressing the Menu button to 
open the Retouch menu. The 
option doesn’t appear if you dis-
play the menu by pressing OK 
during picture playback.

Figure 11-23: The frame dimensions affect the size of the data file needed to store the movie 
on your memory card.
 
2. Highlight Frame Size and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-23. Here, you set 
the size of the movie frames, in pixels. The larger the size, the larger you 
can view the finished movie. But a larger frame size also means a larger 
data file needed to store the movie. So for online sharing, consider 
using one of the two smaller sizes to reduce the time people must spend 
downloading the file.
 
 To understand how pixels display onscreen, whether it’s a TV or com-
puter monitor, see “Preparing Pictures for E-Mail” in Chapter 9. Chapter 
3 offers some additional tips about pixels.
 
3. Select a frame size and press OK.
 
4. Highlight Frame Rate, as shown on the left in Figure 11-24, and press 
the Multi Selector right.
Figure 11-24: For the smoothest playback, choose 15 frames per second (fps).

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 You’re presented with the screen shown on the right in the figure. Here, 
you specify the number of frames per second in your movie. The higher 
the frame rate, the smoother the playback, but the shorter the movie 
you can create.
 
5. Select a frame rate and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the main Stop-Motion Movie screen. 
 
6. Highlight Create Movie, as shown on the left in Figure 11-25, and 
press OK.
 
 You see a screen similar to the one on the right in Figure 11-25, with 
thumbnails of the images on your memory card.
Figure 11-25: Select the image that you want to use as the starting frame of the movie.
 
7. Highlight the image that you want to use as the starting shot in the 
movie.
 
 Notice that one thumbnail is sur-
rounded by a yellow box and is 
marked with the word “Start” — 
in Figure 11-25, it’s the middle 
image. Press the Multi Selector 
right or left until the image that 
you want to use to kick off your 
movie appears under the Start 
frame.

9. Highlight the image that will be the last one in the movie and press OK.
 
 Again, just press the Multi Selector right or left to scroll the images 
across the screen until the one you want to use appears under the End 
frame. Don’t worry if there are frames between the Start and End images 
that you don’t want to include in the movie; you can exclude them in the 
next step.
 
 The little “filmstrip” at the bottom of the screen displays thumbnails of 
the images you selected as the start and end pictures, as shown on the 
left in Figure 11-27.
Figure 11-27: Select Edit to exclude frames or change the start or end frame.
 
10. Edit out any unwanted intermediate frames (optional).
 
 If you don’t want to include 
one or more of the frames that 
fall between your start and end 
frames, highlight Edit, as shown 
on the left in Figure 11-27, and 
press OK. You then see the 
screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Highlight Middle Image 
and press OK to return to a 
thumbnail view that displays all 
the frames between your start 
and end images, as shown in 
Figure 11-28.
 
 Images marked with a check 
mark are tagged to be included 
in the movie. Press the Multi 
Selector left or right to highlight a frame and then press up or down to 
toggle the check mark on or off. Press OK after you’ve unchecked all the 
frames you don’t want to include. You then see the screen shown on the 
left in Figure 11-29.

 Should you decide to change the start or end frame, select Starting 
Image or End Image instead of Middle Image when you see the screen 
shown on the right in Figure 11-27. Then simply re-choose your start or 
end frame and press OK.
 
11. At the bottom of the Change Settings screen (the left screen in Figure 
11-29), highlight Save and press OK.
 
 The camera saves your changes and presents the Create Movie screen, 
shown on the right in the figure.
Figure 11-29: Choose Preview to take a look at your movie before you actually save the file.
 
12. Highlight Preview and press OK.
 
 The camera plays a preview of your movie. If you’re not happy with the 
results, you can take two routes:
 
• Adjust the Frame Rate. Highlight Frame Rate and press OK to adjust 
the frame rate that you selected in Steps 4 and 5.
 
• Select different images for the movie. Highlight Edit and press OK to 
return to the Edit screen (refer to Figure 11-27) to change the start, 
end, or intermediate images in the movie. After you do so, press 
OK to return to the Create Movie screen you see on the right in 
Figure 11-29.
 
13. Highlight Save and press OK.
 
 The camera takes a few seconds to process and store the movie file, 
which is recorded in a standard digital movie format known as AVI. Then 
the first image in the movie appears in full frame on the monitor, as 
shown in Figure 11-30.
To play the movie, press OK when you see the screen shown in Figure 11-30. 

309
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
During playback, an icon appears that 
looks like the Multi Selector. Press OK 
to pause the movie; press left to go 
back, right to go forward, and up to 
stop playback and display the movie 
thumbnail.
To play stop-motion movies you cre-
ated earlier, head for the Playback 
menu and select Stop-Motion Movie, 
as shown on the left in Figure 11-31. 
Thumbnails of movie files appear with 
little “filmstrip holes” along the sides, 
as shown on the right in the figure. 
Highlight the movie thumbnail and 
press OK to begin playback.
Figure 11-31: Movie-file thumbnails are decorated with little “filmstrip” holes, as shown here.
 
After you transfer your image files to the computer, you also can view your 
movie in any program that can handle AVI files. And you can use the option 
discussed at the end of Chapter 9 to play your movies on a television set or 
other regular video device.
Creating a Miniature Effect
Have you ever seen architect’s small-scale models of planned developments? 
The ones complete with tiny trees and even people? The Miniature Effect 
on the Retouch menu offers a tool that attempts to create a photographic 
Figure 11-30: Movie files are stored in the AVI 
digital video format.

equivalent by applying a strong blur to all but one portion of a landscape, 
as shown in Figure 11-32. The left photo is the original; the right shows the 
result of applying the filter. For this example, I set the focus point on the part 
of the street occupied by the cars.
Figure 11-32: The Miniature Effect throws all but a small portion of a scene into very soft focus.
This effect works best if you shoot your subject from a high angle — other-
wise, you don’t get the miniaturization result. To try it out, take these steps:
 
1. Display your photo in full-frame playback and press OK to bring up 
the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Miniature Effect, as shown on the left in Figure 11-33, and 
press OK.
 
 You see your image in a preview similar to the one shown on the right in 
the figure.
 
3. Use the Multi Selector to position the yellow box over the area you 
want to keep in sharp focus.

311
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-33: Use the Multi Selector to position the yellow rectangle over the area you want 
to keep in sharp focus.
 
4. To preview the effect, press the Zoom In button.
 
 When you release the button, you’re returned to the screen shown on 
the right in Figure 11-33. Keep adjusting the placement of the box and 
previewing the result until you’re happy.
 
5. To create a copy of your photo with the effect applied, press OK.
