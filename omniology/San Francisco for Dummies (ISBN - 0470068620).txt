About the Author
A California native, Paula Tevis made many treks to San Francisco
as a young girl before moving to her favorite city in 1983. After an
eclectic but blessedly brief career that included stints in the com-
puter and nonprofit sectors, she and her husband produced a
couple of children in quick succession, and Paula happily relin-
quished the 9-to-5 world for the 24/7 one that parenting brings.
Upon regaining consciousness, Paula recalled a childhood ambi-
tion and declared herself a writer. From her humble beginnings
word-processing cookbook manuscripts for a local publisher,
Paula metamorphosed into a freelance copy editor and soon
received her first break as a professional writer with Parenting
magazine, crafting a column on kids who cook. Over the years, she
has contributed articles and essays to Family Fun magazine, the
San Francisco Chronicle, Citysearch.com, Frommer’s Las Vegas,
Frommer’s New Orleans, and Variety. She is the co-author of
California For Dummies and author of the original Frommer’s 
San Francisco with Kids.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to my editor, Jennifer Anmuth, and to my dear cousins
Irene Levin Dietz and Ina Levin Gyemant, who have added so 
much to my life in San Francisco for over 30 years. Eating in the
city wouldn’t be the same without Bev Chin or the guidance of
Patricia Unterman; revisiting my favorite neighborhoods is an 
even greater pleasure with my cadre of friends, including 
Marjie Graham, Vicki Pate, Cynde Ahart Wood, Helene and 
Charles Wright, Andrea and Jeff Tobias, and Sarah Wilcox. Thanks
also to Donna Joyner for her Wine Country insights. Living, no
matter where, is pretty terrific and lots of fun with my husband,
Mark Katz, and our very wonderful daughters, Madeleine and Lili.

Introduction
M
any years ago, long before mandatory seatbelt laws, my mother
would occasionally squeeze my sister Patience and me into her
little red sports car and literally zoom up Highway 101 for a weekend in
San Francisco. We lived 350 miles south, in Santa Barbara, but due to my
mom’s lead foot, we’d be cruising along the bay in no time, past a hill
filled with rows of boxy pastel-colored houses, then onto the boulevard
that led to our cousin Mildred’s beautiful home. My desire to live in a big
city (and drive really fast) no doubt developed during these trips, and
many subsequent ones in my teens, but my ties to San Francisco actu-
ally extend back farther. My grandmother, Sarah, and her sister, Lottie,
grew up here. At 18 and 20 years of age, they camped in Golden Gate
Park after the 1906 earthquake, and in later years they lived in a series of
houses in the Richmond District.
When I had the chance to move to San Francisco in 1982, I didn’t 
think twice. My future husband and I first lived near Haight Street, then
moved to a neighborhood near the Mission District and Bernal Heights.
Eventually, I found myself working at one time or another around the
Richmond District, Civic Center, Potrero Hill, and South of Market. I
loved getting acquainted with different areas of the city, and in hindsight
I realize my early, admittedly dilettantish, professional life helped pre-
pare me for the greatest (and perhaps longest) job I’ve ever held — 
writing about San Francisco.
The San Francisco of my grandmother’s day was elegant enough to
attract the most famous people of its time yet still wild enough to garner
an exciting reputation. The multicultural, expansive, and liberal city of
today continues in that tradition, and even improves upon it. After more
than 25 years of familiarity, I still continue to marvel at everything San
Francisco has to offer, and I bet that after a day or two spent here, you’ll
do the same.
About This Book
San Francisco For Dummies, 4th Edition, is foremost a reference guide for
people who intend to vacation in San Francisco and need basic, clear-cut
information on how to plan and execute the best possible trip. If you
like, you can begin reading from Chapter 1 and head straight through to
the appendix. But if you turn directly to the restaurant chapter or to the
pages on Wine Country because that’s the piece that interests you at the
moment, the book works just as well. I haven’t included absolutely
everything San Francisco has to offer in the way of attractions, hotels,
restaurants, or diversions — a book that size would be too heavy to

pack and probably too bothersome to read. What I’ve done is picked and
chosen what I believe to be worth your time and your money while still
offering enough variety to please a range of tastes, budgets, and family
configurations.
Let me underscore that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and in San Francisco this is especially true of restaurants as well
as prices. Therefore, I suggest that you write or call ahead for confirma-
tion when making your travel plans. The authors, editors, and publisher
cannot be held responsible for the experiences of readers while travel-
ing. Your safety is important to us, however, so we encourage you to
stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cam-
eras, purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
So, San Francisco, here you come! You’ve picked a stunner of a destina-
tion, with a wide variety of wonderful sites to see, fabulous foods to
sample, and interesting places to visit. But don’t be overwhelmed.
You’ve made a smart decision in buying San Francisco For Dummies, 4th
Edition. This book walks you through all the nitty-gritty details to make
sure that planning your trip goes smoothly and that the trip itself is
memorable.
In this book, I include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As I
describe each, I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
CB: Carte Blanche
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
JCB: Japan Credit Bank
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

I’ve divided the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty seal
of approval. Don’t hesitate to consider these “runner-up” hotels if you’re
unable to get a room at one of my favorites or if your preferences differ
from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer and the services
that each provides make all these accommodations good choices to con-
sider as you determine where to rest your head at night.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you decide
where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a system of
dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel or a meal at
a restaurant (including appetizer, main course, dessert, one drink, tax,
and tip). Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs:

Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance on
whether to take a trip to San Francisco and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t have a lot of
time to devote to trip planning or you don’t have a lot of time to
spend in San Francisco. You want expert advice on how to maxi-
mize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that discusses the history and archi-
tecture of the city, provides all the data available about San
Francisco, or lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction available to
you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the places
that will give you the best or uniquely San Francisco experiences.
If you fit any of these criteria, then San Francisco For Dummies, 4th
Edition, provides the information you’re looking for!
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies guides, this book is organized in parts that contain
anywhere from two to four chapters of related information. You don’t
need to start at the very beginning (though it’s a good place to start); 
feel free to turn directly to the chapter that intrigues you the most.
Part I: Introducing San Francisco
This part gives you an overview of San Francisco with particular atten-
tion to the lodging, dining, and touring highlights. Chapter 2 offers an
overview of the city’s history, and suggests some background material
that will get you counting the days until your vacation begins. The calen-
dar of events in Chapter 3 may influence your decision on when to
arrive, and the text on San Francisco seasons may convince you to land
when the rest of the tourists have gone home.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco
Because you’re reading this, you probably aren’t the type to just show
up without an appointment — you intend to do a good bit of preplanning
before your arrival. That’s a good idea, and this part covers what you
need to know about travel costs, with tips on how to budget and direc-
tions for getting to San Francisco, particularly if you plan to fly. Because
this book is intended for a varied audience, I include specific advice for
family travelers, the disabled, seniors, and gay and lesbian visitors.
Then I help you decide whether to rent a car, why travel insurance may
be a good idea, and how to stay in touch while you’re away from home.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco
In an unfamiliar city, figuring out where you are can take days, but Part III
saves you time by explaining how to get to town from the airport and how
to get around the most important neighborhoods. A thorough discussion
on local transportation options follows, including everything I know about
parking — although luck and patience usually play a more important role
than mere words. When it comes to figuring out where to sleep, I include a
rundown of the major neighborhoods where visitors stay, offering tips on
getting the most room for your money and brief but informative descrip-
tions of my favorite hotels. A lengthy and tasty chapter on food will have
you discussing the intricacies of the local food scene as if you spent all
your weekends dining in these parts. And if you prefer to eat and run,
you’ll get a head start with a section on food to go — and I don’t mean fast
food.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco
You likely have an idea of what you want to see, and this part provides
the information you need to conquer the most popular sites. Along with
the big stuff, I’ve categorized other fun and intriguing options under lots
of different interests and suggested some amusing guided tours. Many
San Francisco For Dummies, 4th Edition 
4

people come to the city specifically to exercise their charge cards, and my
chapter on shopping will keep even the most avid consumer on his or her
toes. My three- and five-day itineraries in Chapter 13 will help you focus
and plan your days with all the precision you care to muster up. Got a
case of wanderlust? Don’t stay away long, but have a wonderful time
investigating a few of the beautiful areas an hour or less from the city.
At the end of this part, I help you plan a day trip to Berkeley, an
overnighter to the coast, and a getaway to Wine Country, including
winery tours and a mud bath.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco
Nightlife
As my husband says during his annual pilgrimage to JazzFest in New
Orleans, “You can sleep when you’re dead.” But first, you need to figure
out where to go after dinner, and that’s what you’ll discover in Part V.
From opera to swing dancing to barhopping to cinema, you can always
find something stimulating to do around town.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This is where I get to lurch from the sublime (the best views) to the
practical (what to do if it’s raining; glorious San Francisco souvenirs
under $10) and on to the ridiculous (how not to look like a tourist). But
plenty of useful information is yours to be gleaned.
I also include an appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing lots of
handy information you may need when traveling in San Francisco, such
as phone numbers and addresses, emergency personnel or area hospi-
tals and pharmacies, contact information for babysitters, lists of local
newspapers and magazines, protocol for finding taxis, and more. Check
out this appendix when searching for answers to lots of little questions
that may come up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
These six icons appear in the margins throughout this book:
This icon highlights money-saving tips and/or great deals.
This icon highlights the best San Francisco has to offer in all categories —
hotels, restaurants, activities, shopping, and nightlife.

when you see the Tip icon.
Introduction 5

Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware of.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
Part of the fun of traveling to a city other than your own is finding all the
things that you can’t find anywhere else — especially when so much of
the landscape is dotted with the same old same old. This icon highlights
sights or activities that really help you get a feel for San Francisco and
why it’s unique.
Where to Go from Here
Grab some sticky notes to mark the pages that you may want to refer to
later, clear your calendar, check the condition of your suitcase, and get
ready to hit the road.

ith a wink and a wave to the past, San Francisco continues to
reinvent herself with all the insouciance of a pretty girl in a
Mustang convertible. In her brief role as the heartbeat of the Internet
economy, the city sashayed toward the 21st century with an energy and
style that caused even the old-timers to gasp in admiration. Then, before
there was time to dump all the stock options, the bubble burst, the old-
timers scrambled to diversify their portfolios, and young commercial
real-estate brokers and Web designers gave serious consideration to
dental school. Fortunately, some things never change: The beautiful
scenery continues to dazzle, the top-flight dining continues to garner
raves, and the entertainment possibilities continue to grow in sophisti-
cation and imagination.
No matter how the economy fares, San Francisco consistently rates as
one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and it’s no secret why.
The city’s treasured cable cars provide both thrills and great views as
they whiz down and around our hills; a majestically golden bridge sus-
pends travelers over the deep blue of the bay; hidden staircases lead to
lovely gardens and eye-catching homes. And where else can you savor
freshly made miniature chocolate truffles, meander down the most
crooked street in the world, and escape from Alcatraz — all in one
action-packed day?
Summarizing San Francisco is not easy. When it comes to culture, we
deliver everything from grand opera to leather-clad, fire-dancing per-
formance artists. As for dining, we can down a burrito for lunch and
polish off a multicourse designer meal for dinner — but critique both
with equal passion. Our neighborhoods can more accurately be called

villages, each with its own retail corridor, park, and highly distinct per-
sonality. For in the face of rampant cultural homogeneity — the malling
of America, so to speak — San Francisco is holding on tight to its indi-
vidualism and enthusiastically applauds, or quietly salutes, those who
do the same. What is consistent about the city, from the top of Telegraph
Hill to the newly paved sidewalks of China Basin, is constant surprise. As
you round a bend in the road, a lovely vista unexpectedly pops into your
line of sight. As you savor a glass of chardonnay, a Chinese funeral
cortege may suddenly glide past your cafe table, the band playing a pop
classic. Or the smell of roasting coffee beans may waft down the street
and completely erase any thought but where to find an espresso. Give
your senses free rein to guide you through your days here, and you’ll
have a vacation like no other.
Because I consider the following to be the best San Francisco experi-
ences, I’ve marked them with a Best of the Best icon when they appear
in the rest of the book.
Best San Francisco Travel Experiences
Strolling along the Embarcadero to Aquatic Park: This is a quintessen-
tial San Francisco activity, ideally experienced on a sunny day. I love to
begin near the baseball park, although exiting Muni at the Embarcadero
(see Chapter 8) and starting there is more convenient. With the water on
one side and city landmarks on the other, a leisurely walk past the piers,
through Fisherman’s Wharf (see Chapter 8), leads to Aquatic Park and
the Municipal Pier. Be sure to hike all the way to the end of the pier,
stopping to see what, if anything, the anglers have caught. You’ll be
rewarded with million-dollar bay vistas.
Shopping at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market: Tuesday and Saturday
mornings find home cooks and food lovers of all ages crowding the stalls
in front and around back of the Ferry Building (see Chapter 12). You
can sample stellar organic fruits, homemade conserves, and goat
cheeses, or you can chow down on the freshest of morning pastries,
bread, and heartier dishes from some of the city’s well-known restau-
rants. This is a ritual for lots of local chefs who chat up their favorite
vendors and bag the choicest morsels.
Rooting for the Giants at AT&T Park: You don’t have to be a baseball
fan to enjoy an afternoon or evening at this diamond of a ballpark
(despite its ever-changing corporate name). Bleacher seats go on sale
game days, but if you prefer something with more cachet, you can usu-
ally buy seats online from season-ticket holders (see Chapter 11). You’ll
find the best hot dogs around in the concession stands — load up on the
sauerkraut and mustard and maybe scramble for a fly ball.
Biking in Golden Gate Park: Bike rentals are easily available along
Stanyon Street and around Stow Lake (see Chapter 11). John F. Kennedy
Drive, which is closed to automobile traffic on Sundays, will take you on
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of San Francisco 11

a meandering route through this lovely slice of green. At the end of the
road, head north toward Fulton Street to see the Dutch Windmills. In
spring, the tulips here are in full, glorious bloom.
Sipping a cappuccino in North Beach: There’s never a time when this
isn’t a great idea, but on a weekday when everyone else is at work, sit-
ting with a newspaper and an Illy espresso defines contentment. You’ll
have your pick of cafes in North Beach, but I’m happy to recommend
Caffè Greco, 423 Columbus Ave., between Vallejo and Green, which is
bright and roomy and has a big selection of high-carb goodies.
The Best Hotels
Best All-Around Family Hotels: The playful and warm Serrano Hotel,
405 Taylor St. (% 866-289-6561 or 415-885-2500), can provide young fam-
ilies with complimentary cribs, strollers, and even booster seats; older
children will be delighted to find games scattered around the public
areas and goodies including mini Etch-a-Sketches in the minibar. The
moderately priced Hotel del Sol, 3100 Webster St. (% 877-433-5765 or
415-921-5520), has goodies for the kids, plus a fab outdoor pool. The
Hotel Monaco, 501 Geary St. (% 866-622-5284 or 415-292-0100), com-
bines style with all the practicalities you want in an upscale hotel, such
as an excellent restaurant, top-quality staff, and a spa. Although I’d
never suggest that you abandon the children (for too long), you could
have a massage downstairs while they hang out in the room watching a
movie and enjoying room service.
Best Hotels for a Romantic Weekend: The outdoor soaking tubs at 
the Hotel Vitale, 8 Mission St. (% 888-890-8688 or 415-278-3700), seem
to me a good place to start the fun. Then, reserve a deluxe Waterfront
room and hang out the “do not disturb” sign. If you’re out to impress,
the spacious Bolero Penthouse suite in the Hotel Adagio, 550 Geary St.
(% 800-228-8830 or 415-775-5000), includes a lovely outdoor terrace,
and the hotel itself is lively.
Best View: You can be assured of a soothing view from the bay rooms 
at the lovely Harbor Court Hotel, 165 Steuart St. (% 866-792-6283 or
415-882-1300). Not all the rooms have great views at the Argonaut Hotel,
495 Jefferson St. (% 866-415-0704 or 415-563-0800), but request one
with a window overlooking the bay for a real San Francisco treat.
Best Hotel Pool: Children under 16 aren’t actually allowed in the pool at
the Huntington Hotel, 1075 California St. (% 800-227-4683 or 415-474-
5400), so you’ll be the one to blame for splashing and making noise. If I
had a category for Best Hotel Spa, the Huntington would get the nod
there as well.
Best Hotel If You Have a Car: For stays around Union Square, the
Galleria Park Hotel, 191 Sutter St. (% 800-792-9639 or 415-781-3060),
sits over a parking garage, so the valet shouldn’t take too long to
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
12

retrieve your car. All the downtown hotels charge from $28 to $45 per
day to park (plus tax); if you really can’t live without the car, be sure to
inquire about parking packages when you book your room. Parking is
free at the Cow Hollow Motor Inn & Suites, 2190 Lombard St. (% 415-
921-5800), and Lombard Street takes you to the Golden Gate Bridge.
The Best Restaurants
The Best for a Romantic Meal: I like Absinthe, 398 Hayes St. (% 415-
551-1590), for the food and décor, and Quince, 1701 Octavia St. (% 415-
775-8500), which is so personable and sophisticated that eating there
makes you quite fond of whomever you’re with.
The Best with Kids: You can’t go wrong with Chow, 215 Church St. 
(% 415-552-2469), or Park Chow, 1240 Ninth Ave. (% 415-665-9912),
both of which have the same menu. The price is right; the food is non-
threatening, recognizable, and tasty; and the casual atmosphere is 
relaxing.
The Best for a Splurge: This category is not an easy one, because there
are lots of amazing kitchens to choose from, but I have no qualms about
directing you to Gary Danko, 800 North Point St. (% 415-749-2060).
This place is inviting yet sophisticated, completely professional on
every level, and the food is superb.
The Best Neighborhood Spots: In the Mission District, Delfina, 3621
18th St. (% 415-552-4055), continues to please with a bright Tuscan
Italian menu, while Blue Plate, 3218 Mission St. (% 415-282-6777), feels
like one of those secret finds that you want to visit again and again.
Around Cow Hollow (or anywhere in the city, really), Isa, 3324 Steiner St.
(% 415-567-9588), is plainly a winner with absolutely delicious food and
delightful service.
The Best for Views: Forget about the overpriced tourist traps around
PIER 39 — anyway, you can’t see much at night when it’s dark. For the
best views at bargain prices, try the San Francisco Art Institute cafe,
800 Chestnut St. (% 415-771-7020). The scenery from Green’s, Fort
Mason, Building A, off Marina Boulevard at Buchanan Street (% 415-
771-6222), makes finding your way around this former military base
worthwhile.
The Best Shopping
The Best for Generalists: Kids, men, brides, your mother — there’s
something for everyone who has excellent taste at Dandelion, 55
Potrero Ave. (% 415-436-9500).
The Best for Books: This is more than a bookstore; City Lights, 261
Columbus Ave. (% 415-362-8193), is representative of an era and a
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of San Francisco 13

movement. Owner-poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti was one of the founders of
the Beat movement. That it’s also a terrific place to browse and buy is
not completely incidental.
The Best for Kitchen and Table: You could choke on the number of
shops pushing high-end knives and fancy cheese graters. A purist at
heart, I remain extremely fond of Forrest Jones, 3274 Sacramento St. 
(% 415-567-2483), where you can find useful and pretty items at very
fair prices.
The Best for People Who Consider Themselves Cool: Naturally, if you 
fall into this category, you won’t advertise it (that wouldn’t be cool now,
would it?), but because even cool people have to shop, you’ll find mostly
everything you need for all occasions on Haight Street (best if you are
shopping with your kids), or on even hipper Hayes Street (see Chapter 8).
The Best Bars and Clubs
The Best for American Idol Fans: They say the Hurricanes could be
stronger, but you can’t find better entertainment for the price of a cock-
tail at The Mint Karaoke Lounge, 1942 Market St. (% 415-626-4726).
Given that it’s in the Castro, you may want to take extra care with your
appearance, especially if you’re planning on taking the stage!
The Best for Lost Fans: The exotic décor at trendy Bambuddha Lounge
at the Phoenix Hotel, 601 Eddy St. (% 415-885-5088), is matched by the
sultry, sulky clientele stirring their apple martinis while awaiting small
plates of Southeast Asian goodies. Word is the service is uppity, but no
one will ask you to discuss your past.
The Best for Apprentice Fans: Should the Donald (or even the Martha)
stride into town searching for attractive overachievers, he’d find at least
a handful at the Redwood Room at the Clift Hotel, 495 Geary St. (% 415-
775-4700).
The Best for Elvis Fans: The Southern cookin’ is quite a yum — and a
bargain to boot — and the vibe at blues venue Biscuit and Blues, 410
Mason St. (% 415-292-2583), is as sweet as a slice of pecan pie. Make
reservations on the weekends and bring the kids if you have some — it’s
an all-ages club.
The Best for Dancing with the Stars Fans: Friday and Saturday nights
at the Top of the Mark in the Mark Hopkins Hotel, 1 Nob Hill (% 415-
616-6916), features the Black Market Jazz Orchestra for your dancing
pleasure. Dress up and practice your dipping technique.

U
nlike most American cities that have evolved in a more measured
fashion, San Francisco has been molded politically, socially, and
physically by a variety of (literally) earth-shaking events. In this chapter,
I give you a little rundown on the history of the City by the Bay along
with some other useful background on local views and customs that give
an insight into the city and its inhabitants.
History 101: The Main Events
As late (relatively speaking) as 1846, San Francisco was a sparsely popu-
lated town, described by the writer and California historian Robert
Ernest Cowan as “the squalid little village.” A mere two years later, this
sleepy collection of shacks and saloons multiplied almost overnight into
a thriving, lawless, still squalid, but much larger burg and nothing — not
rampant corruption, numerous fires, or hordes of unsuccessful miners —
could keep endless waves of people from arriving here by ship or other
means to seek their fortunes.
But first a little background: The coastline of the Bay Area was navigated
by Portuguese sailors as early as 1542, and although the area was an
object of speculation among European explorers, it remained the unmo-
lested province of the Ohlone Indian tribes until the late 18th century.
San Francisco Bay itself wasn’t discovered until 1769, when Sergeant
Jose Francisco de Ortega, on a scouting mission for Gaspar de Portola,
found the mouth of the port. Seven years later, a contingent of Spanish
Catholics arrived, establishing a fort on the site of today’s Presidio and
one of many Franciscan missions, Nuestra Sénora de Dolores, a mile away
in what is now the Mission District. The first service was held five days

Hearst, turns it into a very successful tabloid.
1906
On April 18 at 5:13 a.m., a major earthquake rocks San Francisco and starts
more than 50 fires, which burn uncontrollably for four days. Two-thirds of the
city is destroyed, 250,000 people are left homeless, and more than 3,000 are
dead or missing.

before the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. (Mission
Dolores, the oldest building in the city and one of the few to survive
earthquakes and fire, is Registered Landmark Number 1 of the City and
County of San Francisco.) After this flurry of excitement, there wasn’t
much to report until Mexico severed ties with Spain in 1821 and became
sovereign over California. American ships from Boston then began a vig-
orous trade with the settlement for otter and beaver skins, and later for
goods such as tallow (rendered animal fat used for soap and candles). A
slow migration into the area by hunters and trappers from the eastern
seaboard, and the occasional AWOL sailors from merchant ships, helped
increase the local population to around 250 people by 1833. In January
1847, now officially under American rule, Yerba Buena (Spanish for
“good herb”) was renamed San Francisco.
The discovery of gold in the American River near Sutter’s Mill at the end

leagues. When word got out in the latter half of 1848, San Francisco’s 
population of 812 quickly contracted as every able-bodied man and boy
took off for the Sierra Nevada. However, by 1849, immigrants were arriving
in San Francisco at the rate of 1,000 per week. The smart money stayed in
the city and started businesses to take advantage of the newly rich and
those hoping to join them — drinking establishments, gambling dens, and
houses of prostitution most prominent among the enterprises. Naturally,
crime and corruption were rife. By 1851, vigilante groups formed to do
what police and politicians were bribed not to do, and with a few well-
placed hangings, things slowly began to calm down.
By 1870, barely 23 years old, San Francisco was already the tenth largest
city in the United States. In this time, it had survived a remarkable migra-
tion, a half-dozen fires, inflation, vice, graft, torrential rains, and an earth-
quake in 1865. The transcontinental railroad newly linked the East and
West coasts, while the thousands of Chinese laborers who laid the rail
were now the objects of vilification by underemployed whites who
appeared to forget that they were immigrants, too.
Still, San Francisco thrived — not even Mother Nature it seems, could
stop the momentum. Certainly, the great earthquake of April 18, 1906,
was a momentous catastrophe; fires raged for four days and it is now
believed that over 3,000 people (of a population of 400,000) died in col-
lapsed and burning buildings or from related ills. Two-thirds of the city
was destroyed, and thousands of newly homeless went to live in Golden
Gate Park until housing could be constructed. But rebuilding began
immediately, and in 1915, San Francisco reintroduced herself to the
world by hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.
The Gold Rush was responsible for the first mass influx of people into
San Francisco, and World War II started the second, as workers from the
south of the country flocked to the city’s shipyards. Postwar prosperity
combined with an anything-goes reputation attracted nonconformists,
artists, writers, and freethinkers, paving the way for the Beats, and later
the hippie movement, to influence an entire nation. The latter half of 
the 20th century found San Francisco grappling with the murders of its
mayor, George Moscone, and the country’s first openly gay politician,
Supervisor Harvey Milk, in 1978. Dan White, a homophobic former city
supervisor was convicted of manslaughter in the killings. California
Senator Dianne Feinstein, at that time the president of San Francisco’s
Board of Supervisors, became mayor.
San Francisco’s last big earthquake, an attention-getting 7.1 on the
Richter scale, hit in the afternoon on October 17, 1989, as the Giants
were preparing to play Game 3 of the World Series. In those days, before
cellphones and wireless Internet, the city came to a halt. With buses and
streetcars unable to operate, sections of the Bay Bridge damaged, and
fires and collapsed buildings in the Marina neighborhood, the city felt
strangely vulnerable. Miraculously, only 63 people died.

The 1990s will be remembered as the dot.com boom-and-bust years. 
San Francisco may not have been as obviously wild as it was during the
aftermath of the Gold Rush, but it isn’t a stretch to draw a few comparisons.
Millionaires were created overnight in the frenzy to take rather specious
companies public, while investors threw money at young entrepreneurs
who turned out to have less-than-feasible business plans. Real-estate
prices went mad, and even sensible people went looking for a technology
start-up to join.
And then, it was over. The 21st century had barely introduced itself
before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, devastated the coun-
try. With the stock market on its downward spiral, and the economy reel-
ing, a town that relies on tourism and business travel would no doubt feel
the effects. Yet, entering the second half of the decade, San Francisco is
not only in recovery mode, it has never looked better.
Taste of San Francisco: Local Cuisine
San Francisco’s reputation as a food-lover’s paradise is well deserved
and tested on a daily basis. You can find thousands of restaurants
around town, from dives to divas, all with their loyal followings and all
under constant scrutiny by critics and self-proclaimed gourmands.
Between the competition and the narrowed eyes of the food patrol, a
restaurateur has to stay sharp, or at least hire a crackerjack public-relations
firm, to make it through the first year in business. The constant buzz and
change in the food scene can be a little nerve-racking to track, but it
serves to make dining an event for locals and tourists alike. In the end,
fortunately, it all comes down to ingredients. And where else but in San
Francisco do you find the freshest, most beautiful, and even most politically
correct fruits, veggies, fish, and organically raised meats? Well, Berkeley,
maybe, but certainly nowhere else.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Getting acquainted with San Francisco through the work of authors and
filmmakers will provide an extra dimension to your trip and perhaps
some added excitement when you happen upon a location you recognize
from a favorite cinematic moment or literary passage. San Francisco’s
own Chronicle Books publishes a great variety of material on the city, for
children, cooks, art and architecture students, and readers of memoir
and fiction. One of Chronicle’s best books to stimulate your interest and
curiosity is San Francisco Stories: Great Writers on the City, edited by
John Miller. This collection of short pieces covers the personal and the
political as recalled by acclaimed authors including Mark Twain, Jack
Kerouac, Tom Wolfe, and Amy Tan. To find out about a smaller, more inti-
mate city, check out Good Life in Hard Times: San Francisco in the ’20s
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into San Francisco 19

and ’30s, by former journalist and San Francisco native Jerry Flamm
(published by Chronicle Books).
One of the more famous and beloved pieces of modern fiction based in
San Francisco is Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City (published by
Perennial). If you’ve seen the miniseries, and especially if you haven’t,
this is a “must read” for a leisurely afternoon — or bring it with you on
the plane. Maupin’s 1970s soap opera covers the residents of 28 Barbary
Lane (Macondry Lane on Russian Hill was the inspiration), melding sex,
drugs, and growing self-awareness with enormous warmth and humor.
A work of fiction featuring San Francisco during the Gold Rush is
Daughter of Fortune, by acclaimed novelist and Marin County resident
Isabel Allende (published by HarperTorch). Allende’s depiction of life in
California during the mid–19th century is vividly described and is one of
the novel’s strengths.
As one of the loveliest spots on the planet, San Francisco has been a
favorite of location scouts since the beginning of the film industry.
Hundreds of movies and television shows have been shot or placed in
San Francisco, making the hills and bridges among the most recognized
of backgrounds. It may be difficult to locate at your local video store, but
the 1936 Clark Gable/Jeanette MacDonald romance, San Francisco, is
lauded for its dramatic reenactment of the 1906 earthquake and for
MacDonald’s rendition of the song of the same name. The Maltese Falcon
(1941), Dashiell Hammett’s classic detective story, with Humphrey
Bogart starring as Sam Spade, includes shots of the Bay Bridge, the
Ferry Building, and Burrit Alley (above the Stockton Tunnel). John’s
Grill, mentioned in the novel, continues to flog its association with
Hammett’s hero from its location at 63 Ellis St. (between Stockton and
Powell streets).
Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), starring James Stewart and Kim Novak,
is admittedly an obvious choice on the list of great San Francisco films,
but it’s always worth viewing. Stewart plays a former detective hired to
tail the wife of an old college friend, but the woman’s identity is less than
clear-cut. In the meantime, Stewart becomes obsessed with his prey as
they make their way around the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort
Point, Mission Dolores, and the detective’s apartment at 900 Lombard St.
The city also fared well in the 1968 thriller Bullitt, starring a young Steve
McQueen. Along with the hair-raising car chase over many hills, you’ll see
the Bay Bridge from a recognizable point on the Embarcadero, Mason
Street heading north next to the Fairmont Hotel, the front of the Mark
Hopkins Hotel, Grace Cathedral, and the fairly unchanged Enrico’s
Sidewalk Café.
For a change of pace and no tragic law-enforcement characters, screen
the romantic comedy What’s Up Doc? (1972) with Barbra Streisand and
Ryan O’Neal. Along with being a very funny film, there’s another car
chase scene that includes Lombard Street and Chinatown and ends at
Alta Plaza Park in Pacific Heights. If you have kids to rev up, the 1993
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
20

comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, starring Sally Field and the city’s favorite son,
Robin Williams, shows San Francisco under blue skies and cable cars
with plenty of room. The house where the character’s estranged wife
and children live is located at 2640 Steiner St. (at Broadway), in case
you care to gawk. Finally, 24 Hours on Craigslist (see Chapter 11) is a 
documentary that covers a day in the life of this Internet community 
bulletin-board phenom. The filmmaker posted an ad on Craigslist, fol-
lowed up with a handful of volunteers — an Ethel Merman impersonator
seeking a Led Zeppelin cover band; a couple looking for others to join a
support group for diabetic cats; a single, older woman needing a sperm
donor — and sent film crews to cover their stories. Unlike other films
that show the physical splendors of San Francisco, 24 Hours on Craigslist
will give you a sense of the city’s psyche, or at least offer an explanation
of why non–San Franciscans think the place is populated with . . . uh . . .
unusual types.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best season to visit
 Finding events that will get you going
You may not have much choice when it comes to scheduling your
trip, especially if you have to plan around school vacations and 
holidays. But in case you do have some leeway, in this chapter I outline
what’s going on in San Francisco at different times of the year in terms of
weather, crowds, and special events. We locals long for days of balmy
temperatures and clear skies. I can only hope you find this kind of
weather, but just in case, bring a warm jacket and maybe a hat no matter
when you’re visiting. And remember, a little fog never hurt anybody.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Because of its temperate Northern California address, San Francisco
beckons to tourists and business travelers year-round. However, San
Francisco is most crowded between June and October. If you visit during
this time of the year, I’d recommend that you make hotel and car reser-
vations at least six weeks in advance, reserve a table at the more well-
known restaurants three to four weeks in advance, and purchase your
tickets to Alcatraz (see Chapter 11) shortly after you commit to this trip.
Don’t arrive in the city with just a suitcase, a camera around your neck,
and a smile. You don’t want to waste your time and energy searching for
accommodations, or squabbling with your traveling companion because
Slanted Door (see Chapter 10) couldn’t seat you.
Something to remember about the San Francisco “summer” is that it
may not be the summer you’re expecting. Temperatures rarely top 70
degrees and are often quite cool. Bring a sweater and be prepared for
morning fog — at any time of year.
The city is at its warmest and most glorious in September and October. In
an average year, these months are also the busiest. It’s when Fisherman’s
Wharf is packed to the gills, every cable car overflows with bodies, and
there’s not an available hotel room in sight. Unless something unusual is
keeping the tourists home, don’t even think about trying to get a dis-
count on accommodations during this time.

Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 23
School vacation schedules will probably dictate your travel dates if
you’re bringing the kids. Normally, the days start out with heavy fog in
July and August but eventually clear up enough for you to lose the jacket
or sweatshirt. Prepare for crowds, especially at the most popular tourist
destinations. Fortunately, a little imaginative planning can help you
entertain your children while avoiding some (though not all) of the
masses. (See Chapter 11 for some offbeat sightseeing ideas.)
During the winter, the crowds do thin out considerably. (Those seeking a
tan at this time of year should try Florida or maybe Singapore.) November
through March, when the weather can be damp and chilly, is considered
downtime for tourists in San Francisco. But if you don’t mind sightseeing
with an umbrella, or bundled up in a sweater and a hat, you can get a 
terrific deal at a nice hotel during these months. You may even be pleas-
antly surprised by blue skies and low 60s temperatures in the middle 
of February (and no fog!). In general, room rates are lower between
November and mid-April, unless a big convention is in town (check with
the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau at % 415-391-2000;
www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com). A few attractions even reduce their
entrance fees at this time of year.
Wintertime can be a great time to see San Francisco, in spite of the
weather, which will still be an improvement over much of the United
States. A good number of the larger hotels offer packages, and some
have special events for kids. The Ritz-Carlton hosts a Teddy Bear Tea
throughout December, a popular affair that sells out early in the season.
Along with sightseeing, you can admire the Christmas windows decorat-
ing Union Square, skate around the Embarcadero Center’s outdoor ice
rink, and take in one of many Nutcracker ballet or music performances.
In the following sections, I fill you in on the pros and cons of each
season. For information on average temperatures and rainfall, take a
look at Table 3-1.

Winter
You’re unlikely to see snow unless you drive to Tahoe, but the weather
won’t exactly be balmy either. Still, a winter visit to San Francisco has its
advantages, including the following:
 Hotel prices are lower, especially on weekends.
 Cable cars aren’t jam-packed.
 Store windows are decorated for the holidays.
 The January sales linger into February.
 Restaurants won’t be as busy.
But consider the following wintertime pitfall:
 The skies may be gray and/or rainy.
Spring
Spring is a popular time for travel, but in San Francisco, it’s also a popu-
lar time for conventions. Here’s are some of the advantages to expect if
you’re considering a springtime visit:
 Flowers are in bloom in the parks.
 The weather can be glorious.
 The major sites will be less crowded than in summer.
But there is a springtime drawback:
 Convention season starts, bringing hotel costs up and making it
even harder to get reservations at the most popular eateries.
Summer
Many travelers are surprised at how cool and foggy San Francisco sum-
mers are. Here are some of the advantages to visiting in the summer
months:
 Mimes are out in full force.
 Longer days make the evening tours of Alcatraz more attractive.
 The city sponsors free weekend concerts at Golden Gate Park and
Stern Grove.
 The fruit and vegetable bounty available at the Ferry Building
Farmer’s Market is mouthwateringly spectacular.
Part I: Introducing San Francisco 
24

But here are some negatives about visiting in the summertime:
 Mimes are out in full force.
 PIER 39 and Fisherman’s Wharf are madhouses.
 Hotels are packed.
 Foggy mornings are downers.
Fall
If reliably warm, sunny days are a top priority for you, fall is the best
time to visit. Here are some other advantages to planning your trip for
the autumn months:
 It’s the finest weather available all year on average.
 The cultural season begins.
But keep in mind the following drawbacks:
 Napa Valley is solidly booked on the weekends.
U The heavy events calendar lures additional crowds.
Marking Your Calendar
I list San Francisco’s most popular or unusual special events and festi-
vals in the following sections. However, tons of other street fairs and
happenings are scheduled during the year that I don’t have room to
mention. For more events, check out the Bay Guardian Web site (www.
sfbg.com), the San Francisco Chronicle Web site (www.sfgate.com), or
the Citysearch Web site (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.com), or
send $3 to the Convention and Visitors Bureau for its Festivals and
Special Events calendar (see the appendix). Call the phone numbers
included with each event for exact dates, locations, and ticket prices 
(if any).
You pay no entry charge for street fairs and holiday festivals, but bring
along some cash for the crafts booths and food.
How do you keep a festival festive? Don’t drive. Parking is always impos-
sible, and you’ll just get frustrated driving around in circles. Walk, take
public transportation, or, if all else fails, take a cab — it’s well worth the
expense.
January/February
An important, well-attended, two-week event in San Francisco’s
Chinatown is Chinese New Year (% 415-391-9680; www.chinese
parade.com). Included in the event are lots of free entertainment, an
exciting parade, and colorful sights. Dates vary.

include film, alternative comedy, and even workshops on how to get
your band noticed. For exact dates and how to score tickets keep
abreast of the Web site.
April
The San Francisco International Film Festival (% 415-561-5000; www.

2313; www.nccbf.org) in San Francisco’s Japantown. In this event,
spanning two weekends, you’ll find flower arranging, sumo wrestling,
traditional drumming, and a parade that begins in Civic Center and ends
in Japantown. Mid- to late April.
Men wear chaps outside the Castro for several reasons and these are
revealed during the steer-wrestling, bull-riding, and bareback-riding com-
petitions at the Grand National Rodeo, Horse, and Stock Show (% 415-
404-4111; www.grandnationalrodeo.com) at the Cow Palace. The ten-
day event also features horse shows and country-music concerts. Check
the Web site for exact dates.
May
Whether you’re commemorating Mexico’s victory over the French in 1862
at the Battle of Puebla or just looking for some good food and music, you

cincodemayosf.com and www.latinbayarea.com) in the Mission
District around 23rd and Folsom streets. Festivities include Mexican and
Central American music, crafts, and food. First Sunday in May.
If you like crowds and scantily dressed samba dancers, Carnival
(% 415-920-0122; www.carnavalsf.com) in the Mission District (on
Harison between 16th and 23rd streets) is a must-see. More than a half-
million revelers turn out for this two-day celebration culminating in a
Sunday morning parade. Memorial Day weekend.

26

June
The Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender Pride Celebration Parade
(% 415-864-FREE; www.sfpride.org), which runs from the Embarcadero

Planning Your Trip 
to San Francisco

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book covers the basics of trip planning. If
you’re an experienced traveler, you may skim the next
four chapters for any pearls of brilliance that apply to you. If
you’re a travel novice, here you discover various options,
including which airport to use. I thoroughly cover money —
how much you need and what you’re likely to spend it on.
Then I move on to speciﬁc tips for families, seniors, disabled
travelers, and gay or lesbian visitors to San Francisco. If you
think you may need a car while you’re in San Francisco, be
sure to weigh the pros and cons on driving around the city in
Chapter 7.

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the cost of things
 Knowing where to go for money
 Cutting your expenses down to size
V
acationing in San Francisco can be costly. Recent Convention and
Visitors Bureau statistics show that the average daily per capita
spending for all visitors, not including those who stay with relatives or
friends, is a substantial $244.43. The major expenditure is for lodging,
while food takes the next largest bite out of your pocketbook.
Money may or may not make the world go ’round, but nothing spoils a
vacation faster than stressing over a higher-than-expected dinner tab or
running out of dough altogether. This chapter covers everything from
figuring the cost of your trip to the nitty-gritty of how to get your cash
while you’re in town.
Planning Your Budget
Creating a travel budget is easy, but sticking to it can be difficult, espe-
cially in a city that provides so many enticements to open your wallet.
The Bay Area is not a cheap date. You’ll likely spend the largest propor-
tion of your funds on airfare (if you’re flying) and lodging. You can spend
as lavishly as you like on food, but you can also eat well inexpensively. I
don’t recommend that you rent a car (see Chapter 7 for my reasons),
and that will save a bundle just on parking alone. Other expenses to con-
sider include transportation around the city, snacks and beverages,
attractions, shopping, entertainment, and incidentals such as telephone
calls. After you figure your expenses, follow my general rule and add an
extra 15 percent. (Unless you’re unusually disciplined, you won’t come
in under budget.)
Transportation
Most people arriving in San Francisco do so by plane or car. If you’re
driving, be aware that gas prices in Northern California are among the
highest in the country.

Airline ticket prices depend on so many variables that I would be foolish
to suggest what you’ll pay to fly. See Chapter 5 for tips on how to get the
best deal. Always contact low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines
or JetBlue, that don’t show up on most travel Web sites. As of this writ-
ing, a round-trip flight in July from New York’s JFK to Oakland on JetBlue
was $430. Checking on Expedia.com, American had round-trip flights
from JFK to San Francisco starting at $408. Of course, the more conven-
ient flight times cost considerably more, and fuel surcharges may add to
the cost.
Lodging
Chapter 9 discusses everything you need to know about hotels, but to
summarize, prices depend on occupancy rates, and occupancy rates
depend on variables such as the economy and the time of year. I’ve
included a range of rooms to suit pocketbooks large and small, but keep
in mind that bargains are relative. I’ve seen $79 rooms that would ruin
some vacations. Remember: You get what you pay for.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco

The cost of things to come
Knowing what to expect is always comforting, especially when it comes to counting
the cost. Here are some average prices for goods and services in San Francisco:
 Lemonade: $1.95
 Latte in North Beach: $3
 An Anchor Steam beer at Johnny Foley’s: $4.75
 Lunch for one at at the Cliff House Bistro (moderate): $20
 Lunch for one at Cafe Asia (inexpensive): $8.50
 Three-course dinner for one (excluding tax and tip) at The Blue Plate 
(moderate): $35
 Three-course dinner for one at Home (inexpensive): $23
 Super Shuttle from airport to hotel (excluding tip): $15
 Taxi from airport to city center (excluding tip): $30 to $45
 One-way Muni/bus fare to any destination within the city (adult): $1.50
 One-way Muni/bus fare anywhere within the city (senior/child 5–17): 50¢
 Movie ticket at the Metreon for an adult: $10
 Ticket to Beach Blanket Babylon: $33 to $77

Dining
Dining out is a big deal in the Bay Area. If your hometown is bereft of
decent restaurants, budget for at least one splurge meal in San
Francisco. Study Chapter 10 for ideas on where to eat well on the cheap.
Sightseeing
Many of San Francisco’s enduring attractions are free — like the Golden
Gate Bridge, the parks, the hidden staircases, and neighborhood 
walks — and others, such as the cable cars, are inexpensive. Part IV
includes lots of ways to see the city without bruising your bank account.
Shopping
Souvenirs both annoy and inspire me. I fondly recall a small replica of the
Eiffel Tower on a bookcase in my childhood home left by an older brother,
but still I cluck disparagingly over the useless trinkets my family brings
home from trips (and vice versa). My best suggestion is to give any kids in
your party a sum of money to spend and gentle reminders that when it’s
gone, it’s gone. Adults should pat themselves on the back for contributing
to the local economy, which is much appreciated, I’m sure.
On the other hand, if you consider giving your credit card a workout a
necessary part of vacation, you’ve come to the right place. Plenty of
upscale chains and boutiques exist in San Francisco that you may not
find back home. Chapter 12 discusses where to shop, no matter what
your budget, and gives a few suggestions for finding low-cost gifts.
Nightlife
You can live large with seats for the ballet or nurse a beer in a Mission
District music club for under ten bucks — it just depends on your
predilections (and your budget). Chapters 15 and 16 cover some of the
entertainment options and tell you where to find all the local listings.
Taxing your wallet
Along with the more obvious expenses, such as souvenir bridges and
Escape from Alcatraz T-shirts, you have those little extras called taxes
that add up. In our fair city, a sales tax of 8.5 percent is added to just
about everything but snacks and take-out food. Additionally, a hotel tax
of 14 percent is added to the cost of your room and an additional 14 per-
cent is now added to the valet parking fees charged by hotels. The good
news is that most of it goes to fund local arts organizations, which
makes it a bit more palatable, I hope.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
San Francisco can be expensive, but you can save money by following
some of these tips:
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 33

 Go off season. You can save big-time on airfare and hotel costs if
you travel during the off season — winter or early spring. Yes, it
may be cold and/or wet, but you may also luck out. Remember:
We’re talking California — if global warming doesn’t alter the
weather patterns, maybe we’ll have a drought.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 5.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, including San Francisco,
you can book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some
sightseeing just by making one call to a travel agent or packager —
and for a lot less money than if you tried to put the trip together
yourself. (See Chapter 5 for specific suggestions of companies to
contact.)
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the bay, or less
conveniently located can be great bargains. Outlying motels often
have free parking, with lower rates than downtown hotels offering
amenities that you may never use. Sure, at a motel you’ll be carry-
ing your own bags, but the rooms are often just as comfortable and
a lot cheaper. See Chapter 9 for more on hotels.
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchenette and use it. You may not
feel like you’re on vacation if you have to do your own cooking, but
you can save a lot of money by not eating out three times a day.
Even if you only make breakfast and an occasional lunch in your
room, you’ll still save. And you won’t have to worry about any
unexpected room-service bills.
 Ask whether kids stay free. A room with two double beds usually
doesn’t cost any more than a room with a queen-size bed. And
many hotels won’t charge you the additional-person rate if the
additional person is pint-sized and related to you. Even if you have
to pay $10 or $15 for a rollaway bed, you can save hundreds of dol-
lars by taking one rather than two rooms.
 Find out which days attractions offer free admission. Take advan-
tage of free museum days and other free admission days.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories should be the
best mementos of your trip. Forgo the T-shirts, key chains, salt-and-
pepper shakers, and other trinkets, and save a bundle.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. If you decide you need a car, renting a
smaller car is cheaper, and you save on gas to boot. Unless you’re
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
34

traveling with kids and need lots of space, don’t go beyond the
economy size. For more on car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Don’t rent a car. The city is easily navigable on foot or by public
transit. You save as much as $50 a day on hotel parking by not
having a car, too.
 Ride public transportation, such as Muni or BART. Purchase a
Muni Passport and use it often (see Chapter 8).
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money in
taxis and other local transport. As a bonus, you’ll get to know your
destination more intimately, as you explore at a slower pace.
 Dine out at expensive restaurants for lunch instead of dinner.
Lunch tabs are usually a fraction of what a dinner costs at most
top-notch restaurants, and the menu often boasts many of the same
specialties.
 Don’t drink a lot of alcohol at meals. A restaurant’s wine and spirits
list is a tidy profit center. Buying some wine or liquor and having a
pre-dinner cocktail in your hotel room is a lot cheaper.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that isn’t as easy to use when you’re away from home is
your personal checkbook.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35
Unearthing those hidden expenses
My credit-card bill never ceases to amaze me. I often wonder where half those
charges came from and then reminisce fondly about the recent past as I dig through
the statement. You may not want to be reminded of your vacation in such a potentially
harsh manner — better to stick with photographs — but that means paying attention
to expenses that are less obvious than shelter and sustenance. For example, remem-
ber that the cost of your hotel is more than the stated room rate. A hotel tax of 14 per-
cent is added on, plus any minibar, telephone, bar, and room-service charges. Parking
in San Francisco can bankrupt you. Remember, too, minor items such as film and devel-
oping; bridge tolls; San Francisco sweatshirts times the number of people in your family
who forgot to pack a jacket; and tips for the bellmen, waiters, and tour bus drivers
(they add up quickly). Do you have to kennel your dog? May as well include that on
the list.

Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an auto-
mated teller machine (ATM). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span
the globe. Look at the back of your bank card to see which network
you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM locations at your desti-
nation. Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) and
be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit. Also keep in mind that
many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different
bank’s ATM. On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may
charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees in the United States, use
www.bankrate.com.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and you can withdraw cash advances
from your credit cards at banks or ATMs as long as you know your PIN
(although this is an expensive way to acquire what’s essentially a loan).
If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the
number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to
you. It usually takes five to seven business days, though some banks will
provide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or some other personal information.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash as needed.
However, keep in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM fee if the
bank isn’t your own. If you’re withdrawing money every day, you may be
better off with traveler’s checks — as long as you don’t mind showing
identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; American Express Gold and Platinum cardholders who
use this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 per-
cent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.
Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain Visa
checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378.
MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for a
location near you.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
36

If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Although it’s unlikely that you’ll be the victim of a crime while on vaca-
tion, some talented pickpockets do roam the streets of San Francisco.
And I can tell you from personal experience that discovering your wallet
has magically disappeared, leaving you with only the change that’s fallen
to the bottom of your purse, is not amusing.
If you carry a handbag, hold it in front of you, not dangling from your
shoulder, and keep it zipped up. Never leave your pocketbook or back-
pack unattended. Carry your wallet in an inside pocket. Carry only as
much cash as you need in a day and consider keeping your ATM card,
credit cards, and driver’s license in an inside pocket.
Be sure to contact all your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police-report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have a toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be
able to wire you a cash advance or deliver a replacement card in a day
or two. Call the following emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and trav-
eler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the directory at % 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash when the banks and American Express
offices are closed, you can have money wired to you via Western Union
(% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the plane if
you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.

In This Chapter

T
he Internet has made it possible for anyone to play travel agent. You
want to compare flight schedules and ticket prices? You want to take
a virtual tour of a hotel? You want to purchase theater tickets online? It’s
getting easier by the day. Or would you rather let your local travel agent
make the calls? If you do use a travel agent, make sure the agent has in-
depth knowledge of the destination and isn’t just reserving the hotel
that will give him the largest commission. In-laws of mine (who shall
remain nameless) let their travel agent recommend the hotel on their
last trip to San Francisco, and it turned out to be a dump because the
agent hadn’t done her homework. The pitiful looks on their faces made
me want to hit them over their heads — with San Francisco For
Dummies, of course.
Flying to San Francisco
The most convenient airports to San Francisco are San Francisco
International (SFO), which is 14 miles south of downtown, and Oakland
International Airport, which is across the Bay Bridge off Interstate 880.
SFO is closer, and more airlines fly into this major hub. Oakland is
smaller and easier to get in and out of, but you’ll pay about 10 percent
more for cab fares and 50 percent more for shuttles.
You can sometimes get a lower fare or a more convenient flight flying
into Oakland, so always compare prices and travel times for each air-
port. Oakland also generally enjoys better weather than San Francisco.
Flights into SFO are frequently delayed due to foggy conditions, a fact
worth remembering as you mull over just how much reading material to
bring with you on the plane.
International travelers flying directly to the Bay Area don’t have a choice
of airports — it’s SFO or nothing. But the spacious new International
Terminal has lots of good dining and shopping choices, plus convenient
connections to BART and car-rental desks.

Finding out which airlines fly to San Francisco
Airlines that fly into SFO include:
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)
 Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com)
 American Airlines (% 800-443-7300; www.aa.com)
 America West Airlines (% 800-235-9292 in the U.S. or Canada,
001-800-235-9292 in Mexico; www.americawest.com)
 British Airways (% 800-247-9297; www.british-airways.com)
 Continental Airlines (% 800-523-3273; www.continental.com)
 Delta Air Lines (% 800-221-1212 or 404-765-5000; www.delta.com)
 Northwest Airlines (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com)
 United Air Lines (% 800-864-8331; www.united.com)
 US Airways (% 800-288-2118; www.usairways.com)
 Virgin Atlantic Airways (% 800-821-5438; www.virgin-atlantic.
com)
Airlines that fly into Oakland International Airport include many of the
preceding, plus JetBlue (% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.com) and
Southwest Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com).
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a. . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, can stay over Saturday night, and are willing to
travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least
expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights,
even the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare is close to
$1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket may cost less
than half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — generally
November through March. You almost never see a sale around the peak
Chapter 5: Getting to San Francisco 39

summer-vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are another source for tickets,
although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares within North
America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sections.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or have stiff cancellation
penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and some
put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are available on the Internet. STA Travel
(% 08701-630-026; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in student
travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. Flights.com (% 312-
332-0090; www.flights.com) also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries.
LowestFare (% 800-678-0998; www.lowestfare.com) is owned by package-
holiday megalith MyTravel and so has especially good access to fares for
sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 888-858-8884; www.airtickets
direct.com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak
Canadian dollar for low fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on Tuesday
or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only valid for
travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be booked
weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline
Web sites or check mega-sites that compile lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com). For last-minute
trips, www.site59.com in the United States and www.lastminute.com
in Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque-fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
40

well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to
play their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004 Priceline added non-
opaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact
flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or bid on opaque fares
as before.
Driving to San Francisco
You can get to San Francisco by driving along three major highways.
Interstate 5 runs through the center of the state. If you drive this route,
you’ll intersect Interstate 80, which goes over the Bay Bridge into the
city. Getting to San Francisco from Los Angeles along Interstate 5 takes
about six hours. The other major route you can take is Highway 101,
which heads up from Los Angeles through San Francisco (about seven
hours) to Marin County, Napa/Sonoma, and other points north. High-
way 1 is the more scenic coastal route that takes you closer to Monterey
and Santa Cruz. It’s really lovely, but the trip up from Los Angeles will
take a lot longer — approximately eight to ten hours.
Arriving by Other Means
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245 or 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) doesn’t
stop in San Francisco proper, but it does stop in Emeryville, a small town
just south of Berkeley. Passengers then ride an Amtrak bus (which
departs shortly after each train arrives) from Emeryville to the Ferry
Building or the Caltrain station in downtown San Francisco. (The Ferry
Building is more convenient to the hotels recommended in this book.)
Traveling by train may seem romantic, but don’t assume it’s cheaper
than flying. At this writing, the lowest round-trip train fare from Los
Angeles to San Francisco is $94, which is still more expensive than a 
14-day advance-purchase ticket from one of the airlines serving the Los
Angeles–San Francisco corridor. The trip from Chicago takes two days
and costs from $135 one way. But consider taking the train for the ex-
perience of chugging across the country, if you have the time, or if
you’re like my mother-in-law, who flunked a workshop on getting over
one’s fear of flying. (She skipped the graduation flight.)
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case
of the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
Chapter 5: Getting to San Francisco 41

you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you
more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind,
certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their
answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure
to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the follow-
ing tour companies: Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusjourneys.
com) or Freedom Tours (% 212-202-5130; www.freedom-tour.com).
Escorted tours almost always encompass more than one city and, in the
case of these operators, take in California highlights.

Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a
buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost
that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast, and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines — including American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-
2121; www.aav7.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-654-6559;
www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-
301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United Vacations (% 888-854-
3899; www.unitedvacations.com) — offer air/land packages. Several
big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online to www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with that
packager.
American Airlines, in particular, tends to have good packages to San
Francisco, because it’s one of the airline’s hubs. British travelers should
check into Travel Bag (% 0870-607-0620; www.travelbag.co.uk).
The biggest hotel chains also offer packages. If you already know 
where you want to stay, call the hotel itself and ask if it offers land/air
packages.

Catering to Special Travel
Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
 Getting ready for a trip with the kids, San Francisco–style
 Going for high adventure for the disabled or senior traveler
 Checking out the scene for gay and lesbian travelers
A
h, don’t you long for the good old days when you could grab a
backpack, throw in a pair of jeans, and venture out into the world?
Now there’s the family to consider, with Junior needing to run around
and drain his batteries every few hours, your teenage daughter deter-
mined to track down the perfect pair of jeans, and your spouse needing
a break and maybe a beer. Or perhaps you have a physical limitation
that makes traveling a challenge. Or maybe you want to take advantage
of your status as an elder statesperson. Read on, friend! I like nothing
better than to dispense advice.
San Francisco, already celebrated as a haven for gay and lesbian visi-
tors, pretty much holds hajjlike status under the leadership of Mayor
Gavin Newsome. If you’re gay or lesbian, the resources I list in this chap-
ter will help you find areas of the city and entertainment venues that will
be of special interest to you.
Focusing on the Family
Babes in backpacks and strollers are a common sight on the streets of
San Francisco, so you can be assured that munchkins are welcome here.
But taking a vacation with your kids can sometimes mean you’re not
exactly on vacation, at least in my experience. Here are some tried-and-
true ways to make your trip as relaxed and enjoyable as possible.
Looking at the trip from a kid’s point of view
Before you board the plane or pack up the car, sit down with your family
and this book and go over the sights and activities listed in Chapter 11.
Let your kids choose three to six things to see and do (based on the

number of days you plan to stay in San Francisco), and then have them
rate their choices in order of preference. You do the same for the places
you want to visit. Next, fill a calendar with the days or times you plan 
to do a kid activity and the times you plan to do something more adult-
oriented, such as enjoying the Museum of Modern Art or joining a walking
tour (see Chapter 11). Remember to block out time for eating, snacking,
resting, and dropping by neighborhood parks.
Family trips are supposed to be fun, but kids turn cranky when exhaus-
tion sets in (doesn’t everybody?), so don’t pull them in a hundred differ-
ent directions. Neither you nor they need to see everything in one day. A
long afternoon in Golden Gate Park watching the squirrels may be more
memorable than dashing from Coit Tower to Alcatraz. Bring along books,
paper, crayons and pencils, perhaps an inexpensive camera, a Walkman,
or any other unobtrusive, portable toys and games your children can
easily carry in their backpacks. Give kids their own copy of the itinerary
that your family worked out together to remind them that their time will
come.
Finding kid-friendly sleeps, eats, and entertainment
Most hotels are more than happy to accommodate your entire clan.
Chapter 9 offers tips for figuring out what kind of accommodations are
right for you and yours.
Chapter 11 describes various places to go and things to do with young
kids as well as teenagers. But if you’d still like more direction, consider
the itinerary in Chapter 13 or look for the Frommer’s guide San Francisco
with Kids (published by Wiley Publishing). And don’t forget to look out
for the Kid Friendly icon to point you toward hotels, restaurants, and
attractions that may especially appeal to the children. You’ll have no
trouble planning the perfect trip for tots, teens, and in-betweens.
Locating a baby sitter
You and your spouse or a friend may want to go out on the town without
the little, or not-so-little, ones in tow. Many hotels (particularly the
pricey ones) recommend baby-sitting services for their guests, although,
for liability reasons, you’ll have to make the arrangements. Rates vary,
as do add-ons, such as transportation and agency fees, but you can
expect to pay from $16 to $25 per hour with a four-hour minimum. Town
and Country Resources (% 800-457-8222; www.tandcr.com) and Bay
Area 2nd Mom (% 888-926-3666; www.2ndmom.com) are two good com-
panies used by many of the downtown hotels. Call at least a day or two
in advance.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 45

Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site 
that offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.the
familytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a direc-
tory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.
Seeing San Francisco as a Senior
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior discount and coupon-book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people over the age
of 62 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Another reason to celebrate reaching, or passing, 55 years is Elderhostel
(% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org). This organization provides
amazing travel/learning opportunities all over the world that may
encompass a weekend of art lectures and museum viewings or multiple
weeks on safari with the grandkids. Prices are reasonable and include
hotels, excursions, and most meals. San Francisco–based programs
include a six-day wine and food extravaganza with day trips to the Napa
Valley. ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers
small-group tours to off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations,
restricted to travelers 50 and older. INTRAV (% 800-456-8100; www.
intrav.com) is a high-end tour operator that caters to the mature, dis-
cerning traveler, not specifically seniors, with trips around the world
that include guided safaris, polar expeditions, private-jet adventures,
and small-boat cruises down jungle rivers.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); and 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500).
Seniors 65 and older get automatic discounts on public transportation
fares in San Francisco. Just present identification showing your age for
reduced admission at movies, museums, and many other attractions.
Many tour companies also offer a discount for those over 62.

Accessing San Francisco: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
Traveling is a challenge when you’re physically disabled, but don’t let
that stop you from seeing the world. More resources are out there than
ever before. An especially helpful guide is A World of Options, a 658-page
book detailing options for travelers with disabilities. For $45 you can
find out about adventures from biking trips to scuba outfitters. Order 
it from Mobility International USA, P.O. Box 10767, Eugene, OR 97440 
(% 541-343-1284, voice and TTY; www.miusa.org). For more personal
assistance, call the Travel Information Service at % 215-456-9603 or
215-456-9602 (for TTY).
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that
gives free lifetime entrance to all properties administered by the
National Park Service (NPS) — national parks, monuments, historic
sites, recreation areas, and national wildlife refuges — for persons who
are visually impaired or permanently disabled, regardless of age. You
may pick up a Golden Access Passport at any NPS entrance fee area by
showing proof of medically determined disability and eligibility for
receiving benefits under federal law. Besides free entry, the Golden
Access Passport also offers a 50 percent discount on federal-use fees
charged for such facilities as camping, swimming, parking, boat launch-
ing, and tours. For more information, go to www.nps.gov/fees_
passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive
access information and advice for traveling around the world with dis-
abilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.
accessiblejourneys.com) is an organization that provides travel plan-
ning resources and information for wheelchair travelers and their fami-
lies and friends.
Avis Rent A Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; car features such as swivel seats, spinner
knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; Society for Accessible Travel and
Hospitality (SATH; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual member-
ship fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommenda-
tions on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services; and the American Foundation for
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 47

the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for
the blind or visually impaired that includes information on traveling with
Seeing Eye dogs.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
the community Web site iCan (www.icanonline.net/channels/
travel/index.cfm) has destination guides and several regular columns
on accessible travel. Also check out the quarterly magazine Emerging
Horizons ($14.95 per year, $19.95 outside the United States; www.
emerginghorizons.com); Twin Peaks Press (% 360-694-2462;
http://disabilitybookshop.virtualave.net/blist84.htm), offer-
ing travel-related books for travelers with special needs; and Open
World Magazine, published by SATH (subscription: $13 per year, $21
outside the United States).
The Bay Area–based Center for Independent Living publishes a 25-page
booklet called San Francisco Access, covering hotels, transportation
options, and other information helpful to disabled travelers. You can
obtain a copy for free by contacting the San Francisco Convention &
Visitors Bureau (% 415-391-2000; www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com).
The organization also has a fine Web site, www.accessnca.com, with
detailed information on traveling all around Northern California.
Touring on wheels
If you’re a wheelchair user, you’ll find San Francisco’s public areas quite
accessible. All sidewalks have curb cuts, and ramps for easy on/off
access have been erected throughout the municipal railway system
(Muni). You can find some buses equipped with wheelchair lifts as well.
For information on public transportation accessibility, request a free
copy of the Muni Access Guide from Muni’s Accessible Services
Program by phoning % 415-923-6142 or writing the program at 949
Presidio Ave., San Francisco, CA 94115. If you need a ramped taxi, phone
Yellow Cab at % 415-626-2345 — there’s no extra charge.
Many of the major car-rental companies now offer hand-controlled cars
for drivers with disabilities. Avis can provide such a vehicle at any of its
locations in the United States with 48-hour advance notice; Hertz requires
notice between 24 and 72 hours in advance at most of its locations.
Wheelchair Getaways (% 800-642-2042; www.wheelchairgetaways.
com) rents specialized vans with wheelchair lifts and other features for
travelers with disabilities in more than 100 cities across the United
States.
Staying accessible
The Americans with Disabilities Act requires hotels built within the past
17 years to be much more handicapped-friendly. However, lodgings that
are housed in old buildings may have entry stairs, tiny elevators, narrow
hallways, and minuscule bathrooms, making them unsuitable for anyone
having to maneuver in a wheelchair.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
48

You can enjoy the Tuscan Inn near Fisherman’s Wharf or The Orchard
Hotel near Union Square (see Chapter 9), which are somewhat newer
properties that are fully accessible. Also, look for the chain hotels, such
as the Embarcadero Hyatt Regency (see Chapter 9), that are equipped
to provide certain services such as TTY phones.
When making reservations, advise the reservation clerk at your hotel of
your needs — be it TTY phones or grip bars — to make your stay more
comfortable.
All newly built or restored restaurants are also up to date when it comes
to meeting requirements for accessible bathrooms and entrances. If you
have any doubts about access, ask when you call for a table.
Getting to the sights
You won’t have any problem accessing the main attractions in San
Francisco. Golden Gate Park is completely accommodating, as are the
museums, the Exploratorium, and many other sites. Some areas are not
very accessible, though (for example, places that have a series of stairs,
such as the Filbert Street Steps). Fort Point has a wheelchair ramp, and
its first floor is easily maneuverable; a walk or roll above Fort Funston is
also accessible for travelers with disabilities.
Anyone who would prefer to admire the hills without actually trekking
over them will appreciate the easy, flat walks that shun both stairs and
vertical climbs detailed by “On the Level San Francisco Excursions.”
The company publishes 20-page color booklets of self-guided walking
tours in various neighborhoods and parks, with historical highlights and
helpful hints on parking and obstacles. Each booklet is $3.95 and can be
purchased online at www.onthelevelsf.com. Guided walks are also
available for $18 per person. Call % 415-921-1382 or check the Web site
for information on locations and schedules.
Traveling Tips for Gay and Lesbian Visitors
San Francisco remains an important and historic destination for gay
travelers. You’ll find the majority of gay bars and inns in the Castro
District, the heart of San Francisco’s gay community. The lesbian com-
munity resides mostly in portions of Noe Valley and the Mission District
(with Valencia Street as the main drag).
Check out these great Web sites for your trip planning: Gay.com (www.
gay.com) and Citysearch (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.com),
which has a complete section devoted to gay and lesbian nightlife and
an interesting history of the Castro. Also take a look at the handy print
guide Betty and Pansy’s Severe Queer Review of San Francisco. You
can order this book through A Different Light bookstore, 489 Castro 
St., San Francisco, CA 94114 (% 415-431-0891; www.adlbooks.com).
When you get to the city, pick up a copy of the Bay Area Reporter for
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 49

comprehensive entertainment listings. It’s free and available in coffee-
houses, in bookstores, and around the Castro.
For information on specific hotels that cater to gay visitors, check out
Frommer’s San Francisco (Wiley Publishing). But there aren’t any com-
pelling reasons to plunk yourself down in such a hotel unless you don’t
intend to leave the Castro. And if that’s the case, you’ll be missing out on
the alternative gay scene South of Market (see Chapter 16).
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
“Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681 or 760-
325-0702; www.abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian
tour operator for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951 or
415-626-1169; www.nowvoyager.com) is a well-known San Francisco–
based gay-owned and -operated travel service.
The following travel guides are available at many newsstands, most
travel bookstores, and gay and lesbian bookstores: Out and About 
(% 415-834-6500; www.outandabout.com), which offers guidebooks
and a newsletter ($20 per year; ten issues) packed with solid information
on the global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus International Gay
Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide)
and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused
on gay men; the Damron guides (% 800-462-6654 or 415-255-0404;
www.damron.com), with separate, annual books for gay men and les-
bians; and Gay Travel A to Z: The World of Gay & Lesbian Travel
Options at Your Fingertips by Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari International;
Box 35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a very good gay and lesbian guidebook
series.

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Buying travel insurance — or not
 Dealing with illness away from home
 Deciding whether to drive
I
n case you need something to worry about, this chapter covers 21st-
century issues such as whether or not you need travel insurance,
what to do if you fall ill, and how to deal with all those people staring at
your shoes in the airport security lines. I also flog my opinion about
driving in San Francisco — but whether you decide to get behind the
wheel or eschew driving in the city, you don’t want to miss my parking
tips.
Renting a Car (Or Six Reasons 
Why You Shouldn’t!)
If lots of traffic, steep hills, no parking spaces, one-way streets, crazy
bike messengers, and the occasional threat of a tow are your idea of fun,
then get yourself a car. If you’d rather not deal with those sorts of has-
sles (and did I mention overly enthusiastic parking enforcement
agents?), plenty of taxis are available to cart you all over the city.
San Francisco doesn’t have one of those enviable public-transportation
systems found in other cities; a bus can take you just about anywhere,
slowly, but San Francisco’s municipal railway system (Muni Metro) is
fairly limited. The Muni streetcars can get you close to where you want
to go, but often you’ll still need to catch a bus or cab or walk to get to
many places. However, because San Francisco neighborhoods are small
and distinct, and because you’ll find beautiful or bizarre happenings
around every corner, walking around is delightful.

Day-tripping: The one reason you should rent a car
If you plan on any out-of-city excursions, like wine tasting (if you don’t
like escorted tours, that is), you may want to rent a car. To avoid parking
fees, wait until the day of your trip to pick up your auto. Most companies,
including Enterprise Rent-A-Car (% 800-261-7331; www.enterprise.
com) can pick you up and drop you off at your hotel.
If you must rent: Getting the best rate
As much as airline fares vary, car-rental rates vary even more. How
much you pay is determined by the car size, how long you keep it, where
you drive it, and tons of other factors.
One tip that could save you some cold, hard cash is to ask a few key
questions, including the following:
 Are weekend rates lower than weekday rates? For example, ask
whether picking up the car Friday morning is cheaper than picking
it up Thursday night.
 Can I get the weekly rate if I’m keeping the car five or more days?
 Will I be charged a fee for not returning the car to the same rent-
ing location? Some companies assess a drop-off charge in this
instance; others, such as National, do not.
 Is it cheaper to pick up the car at the airport or at a location in
town? Remember to include garage charges if you must park at
your hotel.
 Are any specials running right now? If you see an advertised price
in your local newspaper, be sure to ask for that specific rate; other-
wise, you may be charged the standard rate.
When making your rental reservations, don’t forget to mention member-
ship in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and trade unions. These usu-
ally entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent. Ask your
travel agent to check any and all of these rates. And check to see
whether your rental earns you points on your frequent-flier account —
most rentals are worth at least 500 miles.
Comparing rates on the Web
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. All the major booking
sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.
com), Yahoo! Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), and Cheap Tickets
(www.cheaptickets.com), for example — have search engines that can
dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the size of the car you
want, the pickup and return dates, and the city where you want to rent,
and the server returns a price. You can even make the reservation
through these sites.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
52

Taking care of insurance, gas, and other charges
In addition to the rental prices, other optional charges can raise the cost
of your car rentals. For example, if you choose to add the Collision
Damage Waiver (CDW), you may pay an added fee of as much as $10 per
day! Many credit-card companies already offer this insurance option
when you charge the car rental to that credit card, so call your credit-
card company to inquire about this before you leave home.
Another optional charge is additional liability insurance (which covers
you if you’re in an accident where others are injured), personal accident
insurance (if you or your passengers are injured), and personal effects
insurance (if someone steals your luggage from your car). The insurance
on your car at home probably covers you for most of these. If your own
insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you don’t have auto insur-
ance, consider getting the additional coverage. Car-rental companies are
liable for certain amounts, varying from state to state.
As for putting gas in your car, you have the option of paying for a full
tank of gas up front. In this package, the gas price is average compared
with local prices, but you don’t get reimbursed for gas you leave in the
tank after your trip. Your other option is to pay only for the gas you use,
but you have to return the car with a full tank of gas or the company will
charge you $3 to $4 a gallon for the deficiency. If you don’t want to
bother filling up the tank at the last minute, then go with the package
deal. If you know you won’t be rushed, then don’t bother.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. In the following sections, I
offer my advice on all three.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended insur-
ers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com);
Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com);

travelex-insurance.com).
Trip-cancellation insurance
Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you have
to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your travel sup-
plier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can range from
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 53

sickness to natural disasters to the State Department declaring your des-
tination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t cover vague fears,
though, as many travelers who tried to cancel their trips in Oct 2001
because they were wary of flying discovered.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies consid-
ered high-risk by Travel Insured International (www.travelinsured.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a credit
card — by law, consumers can get their money back on goods and serv-
ices not received if they report the loss within 60 days after the charge is
listed on their credit-card statement.
Medical insurance
For domestic travel, buying medical insurance doesn’t make sense for
most travelers. Most existing health policies cover you if you get sick
away from home — but check before you go, particularly if you’re
insured by an HMO.
Lost-luggage insurance
Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On domestic
flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per ticketed passenger.
If you plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see
if your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage
insurance as part of your travel-insurance package, or buy Travel
Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the airport — it’s
usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items
with you in your carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including
books, money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The air-
lines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house
or destination free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
For domestic trips, most reliable health-care plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. Talk to your doctor before leaving on a
trip if you have a serious and/or chronic illness. For conditions such as
epilepsy, diabetes, and heart problems, wear a MedicAlert identifica-
tion tag (% 888-633-4298; www.medicalert.org), which immediately
alerts doctors to your condition and gives them access to your records
through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot line. The United States Centers for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
54

Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.gov) pro-
vides up-to-date information on health hazards by region or country and
offers tips on food safety.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
These days, even if you’re across the country, you can still be in instant
contact with the folks back home via your cellphone, personal digital
assistant (PDA), or laptop computer.
Using a cellphone across the United States
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to the United States’ fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major cities. But
take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destination where you
know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location,
but beware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of our GSM wireless network, which is used by much of the rest of the
world. Your phone will probably work in most major U.S. cities; it defi-
nitely won’t work in many rural areas. And you may or may not be able
to send SMS (text messaging) home. (International budget travelers like
to send text messages home because doing so is much cheaper than
making international calls.) Assume nothing — call your wireless
provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you can always
rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 55
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes. Other preventative measures include fre-
quent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and avoiding alcohol and
sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart disease, or another
condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend wearing compression
stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask your physician about the
best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain or swelling,
or even shortness of breath.

Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still
access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
Finding a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes is difficult nowadays.
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at The
Cybercafe Search Engine (www.cybercaptive.com) and
Cybercafes.com (www.cybercafe.com).
Aside from cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at least one
computer you can use to get on the Internet. And most public libraries
offer Internet access free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel business
centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout.
These kiosks, which you’ll also see in malls, hotel lobbies, and tourist
information offices, give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s
usually higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high
prices mean they should be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hackers,
use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers offer wireless hotspots from where you
can get high-speed connection without cable wires, networking hard-
ware, or a phone line. You can get Wi-Fi connection one of several ways.
Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in Wi-Fi capability (an
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
56

802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their own 
networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with older computers,
an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into your laptop. You
sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone service,
through a plan offered by one of several companies that have made 
wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee shops. 
T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless
connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nationwide.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. Best
of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s
network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The compa-
nies’ pricing policies can be Byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-
connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay around $30 a
month for limited access — and as more and more companies jump on
the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
Several places provide free wireless networks in cities around the
world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personaltelco.net/
index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
offer dataports for laptop modems, and many hotels now offer free high-
speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring
your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet service providers (ISPs) have local access
numbers, allowing you to go online with a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home, and how much it will cost. If you’re trav-
eling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up
numbers in most countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider,
who will then tell you how to set up your computer for your destina-
tion(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on
“Individual Purchase.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or
920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable, or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 57

hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an airline
employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID ready to show at check-in, the security check-
point, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not need gov-
ernment-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
home. Online check-in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site,
accessing your reservation, and printing out your boarding pass —
which may even get you bonus miles! If you’re using a kiosk at the air-
port, bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-
flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re check-
ing bags or want an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using most
kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system, but
always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are available.
Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few air-
lines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were, but some
doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell
an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up secu-
rity by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you have
metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat
with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers
are allowed past security, except for folks escorting disabled passengers
or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring
food in your carry-on luggage rather than checking it, because explosive-
detection machines have been known to mistake food (especially chocolate,
for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the United States are allowed
one carry-on bag plus a personal item such as a purse, briefcase, or
laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop
bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item.
The TSA has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.
tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to San Francisco 
58

Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag. Look for Travel Sentry cer-
tified locks at luggage or travel shops and Brookstone stores
(www.brookstone.com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be
opened by luggage inspectors with a special code or key. For more infor-
mation on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something
other than TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut off if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Settling Into 
San Francisco

In this part . . .
B
ack in his student days, my husband was the kind of
traveler who would blithely arrive in some distant desti-
nation without any notion of where he would eat or sleep,
expecting that these things would somehow manage them-
selves. I, however, have always preferred the security of
knowing a pillow, an airplane, or a theater seat has my name
on it — so go ahead and guess which one of us does the
travel planning.
The hard truth, especially for people like my spouse who
aren’t, shall we say, detail-oriented, is that you have a better
trip when you solidify your plans prior to setting foot on the
airplane or the gas pedal. (Spontaneity is also a virtue, but
usually after your suitcase is unpacked and you have a vague
idea of where you are.) This part takes you from the airport
to the city, introduces you to the neighborhoods, and
explains how to use San Francisco’s public-transportation
system. If you’re driving, you can ﬂip directly to the tips for
upping your parking karma quotient — you need it around
San Francisco! I also prod you to think about what you
require in accommodations so you can make a good match
with a hotel or motel. This part is where you can get some
recommendations on where to go for a great meal at any time
of the day.

Chapter 8
Arriving and Getting
Oriented
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how to get where you want to go
 Exploring the neighborhoods
 Gathering information
You can’t really glean much about a place from its airports and high-
ways. But as you head toward San Francisco, the industrial sites
and parking lots you pass gradually become the neighborhoods and
landmarks you may have seen in films and photographs or heard about
from fellow travelers. Even those of us who know the city as well as we
know our best friends can’t help but let out a sigh of delight when the
Golden Gate Bridge or the downtown skyline comes into view. Welcome
to San Francisco!
The Ins, but Especially the Outs, 
of Bay Area Airports
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) consists of four main termi-
nals: North (Terminal 3), South (Terminal 1), Central (Terminal 2), and
International. The baggage level of each terminal also houses informa-
tion booths. Bank of America operates a branch on the mezzanine level
of the North terminal, and you can find ATMs on the upper level of all
terminals. International visitors will find Travelex currency exchange
offices throughout the International terminal.
You can call the airport (% 650-821-8211) for recorded information, or
try % 650-817-1717 for transit information. The information desk in each
of the terminals can also give you information on how to reach your des-
tination. Or go to the SFO Web site at www.flysfo.com for more about
the airport and ground transportation.

To reach your destination by taxi or shuttle, here are the specifics:
 Taxis line up for passengers at the center island outside the lower
level of the airport. The 14-mile trip to Union Square takes 20 to 30
minutes or so, depending on traffic, and should cost around $33 to
$40 plus tip.
 If you’re patient enough to wait 10 to 20 minutes for the one head-
ing to your neighborhood, shuttle vans offer door-to-door service
from the airport. However, the shuttle may make up to three stops
before it’s your turn to exit. You can find the shuttles by leaving the
airport from the upper level and heading to the center island out-
side the ticket counter nearest you. A guide will direct you. Look
for exact shuttle fares posted throughout the terminals; most
charge around $15. Super Shuttle (% 415-558-8500; www.super
shuttle.com) is my personal favorite. You don’t need to make
advance reservations.
 Bay Area Rapid Transit, known as BART, now connects travelers
from the airport to San Francisco, the East Bay, and the Millbrae
Caltrain Station, a few miles south of the airport. BART fares into
San Francisco are $5.15. At Millbrae, you can board Caltrain and
ride to the depot at Fourth and King streets in San Francisco. The
fare is a bargain at $3.75 for adults and $1.75 for children and sen-
iors, and the ride takes under 30 minutes. For the train schedule, go
to www.caltrain.com or call % 510-817-1717. BART airport sta-
tions are located on level 3 of the International terminal, or you can
take the automated AirTrain to the Garage G/BART Station stop
from the domestic terminals.
 If you’re renting a car, the free AirTrain will transport you to the
building where all the counters and cars are located. Catch the
AirTrain on level 5 in any of the domestic terminal garages.
To drive yourself into town, follow the airport signs to Highway 101
North and Highway 280. Stay toward the left, so you don’t end up on 280.
If you want to go to Union Square, exit 101 North at Fourth Street. Traffic
is manageable until rush hour, from 3 to 7 p.m.
At Oakland International (% 510-563-3300), all ground transportation
is on one level. A shuttle service called Bayporter Express (% 415-467-
1800; www.bayporter.com) picks up passengers from Terminal 1 at the
center island and from Terminal 2 around the corner from baggage
claim. The fare to San Francisco is $26 for one person, $38 for two
people in the same party, and $7 for kids under 12. You’ll have an easier
time if you make reservations for the 45- to 60-minute ride. To take a cab
downtown, expect to pay around $45; the trip takes 30 to 40 minutes,
depending on traffic. If you need cash, you can find ATMs in the airport.
BART (% 510-465-2278; www.bart.gov) also runs from Oakland into
the city. You can catch the AirBART shuttle (% 510-430-9440), which
runs every 20 minutes, in front of Terminal 1 or 2. The fare is $2 for
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
64

adults, 50¢ for children and seniors for the 15-to-30-minute ride to the
Oakland Coliseum BART station. From there, transfer to a BART train
into San Francisco; the fare is about $3.35. Purchase your ticket from
kiosks inside the airport or at the BART station. If you’re staying around
Union Square, exit BART on Powell Street; the trip takes about 25 minutes.
All the major rental-car counters are inside the terminals. If you’re driv-
ing into San Francisco, exit the airport on Hegenberger Road. Follow it
north to Highway 880 toward San Francisco. From there, follow the signs
to Highway 80 to San Francisco. When you reach the Bay Bridge, you’ll
have to pay $3 at the tollbooths to cross. On the other side, exit on Fifth
Street to reach Union Square.
Arriving by Train or Car
Taking the train to San Francisco can be fun and romantic (as well as
convenient), and although I hope you’ll pay attention to my advice not
to drive in San Francisco, there’s no reason you shouldn’t drive there
and put the car away when you arrive.
By train
Amtrak trains arrive in Emeryville, just south of Berkeley. From there, 
an Amtrak bus will take you to downtown San Francisco. The buses 
stop at the Caltrain station, where there’s a Muni streetcar line to the
Embarcadero (and thus, into downtown), and at the Ferry Building. The
Ferry Building is more convenient to the hotels in this book, and from
there you can take a taxi or streetcar to Union Square or wherever.
By automobile
Drivers arriving from east of town will cross the Bay Bridge into down-
town. Cars coming from the south on Highway 101 will discover the
same view a few miles past 3Com (or Candlestick) Park. Anyone making
the journey along Highway 101 from the north will enter San Francisco
from the Golden Gate Bridge. After you pass the tollbooth (it’s $5 coming
into the city), exit along the bay to Van Ness Avenue.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
San Francisco is at the end of a 32-mile-long peninsula between the
Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. The city covers just 7 square
miles. Streets are laid out in a grid pattern, except for two major diago-
nal arteries, Market Street and Columbus Avenue. Market cuts through
town from the Embarcadero up toward Twin Peaks. Columbus runs at an
angle through North Beach, beginning near the Transamerica Pyramid in
the Financial District and ending near the Hyde Street Pier. You’ll find
numbered streets downtown, and numbered avenues in the Richmond
and Sunset districts southwest of downtown.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 67

San Francisco neighborhoods are a diverse and interesting group. Of
course, you’ll have no trouble distinguishing Union Square from
Chinatown, but even if you amble through largely residential neighbor-
hoods, you’ll notice distinct differences in the makeup of the residents
and the commercial establishments. The best way to immerse yourself
in the local culture is to pick a neighborhood and take a stroll.
This section gives you a general outline of the six most popular neigh-
borhoods to tour and lodge in, and the advantages and disadvantages of
staying in each. I follow that with brief descriptions of other worthy
neighborhoods to explore. See the “San Francisco Neighborhoods” map
to orient yourself, and Chapter 11 for more on the major attractions in
these areas.
Union Square
The center of tourist activity, Union Square is tucked inside Sutter,
Grant, Market, and Mason streets. Big department stores, expensive bou-
tiques, theaters, restaurants, and the greatest concentration of hotels in
the city surround the actual square, which has undergone a successful
$25-million facelift in 2002. It lies on top of the very first underground
garage in the United States and features a central plaza outlined in palm
trees, a good cafe, outdoor tables, the TIX Bay Area outlet for half-price
tickets, a See’s Candy outlet, and a shop selling San Francisco–related
necessities such as sweatshirts, posters, and gifts.
Union Square is about as convenient as it gets. Chinatown, SoMa (South
of Market Street), and the Financial District are within easy walking dis-
tance, and public transportation can take you just about anywhere from
here. Buses, Muni, BART, and the Powell Street cable cars all run
through the area. You can even hail a cab from street corners in Union
Square, whereas in other parts of town you usually need to call for one.
Urbanites will love it.
On the downside, be prepared for heavy traffic and noise. Hotel rooms
are generally quiet, but you can often hear sirens piercing through the
walls or garbage trucks on their early morning rounds. Most of the
hotels are in older buildings, which can be charming; however, this
means that the rooms and baths often are somewhat small. Valet parking
in the area runs $18 to $45 a day.
Although Union Square sits next to the Tenderloin, a low-income neigh-
borhood of immigrant families, druggies, and the down-and-out, the area
is basically safe, as are most neighborhoods in San Francisco (see the
appendix for more information on safety). Because of the many locals
and tourists out and about, you do see plenty of street people and
vagrants looking for handouts. Pickpockets can be a problem, and
women are advised to avoid walking around unescorted at night. Certain
sections of the Tenderloin should be avoided at any time.
The benefits of staying in Union Square include the following:
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
68

 Chinatown is around the corner.
 You have dining, shopping, and nightlife all in one place.
 Public transportation is excellent.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You’re right near the Tenderloin.
 The traffic is relentless during the day.
 The panhandling can get on your nerves.
Nob Hill
Just above Union Square is Nob Hill, one of the oldest and most fashion-
able addresses in town. Enveloping California Street from Leavenworth
to Stockton and overlooking the Financial District, the area boasts beau-
tiful, upper-crust residential apartments and the majestic Grace
Cathedral. You can find the swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood (home
to the Gettys and author Danielle Steel) to the west. A small selection of
plush hotels cascades down the hill toward the Financial District, along
with the California Street cable-car line.
Nob Hill accommodations are pricey, with good reason. They offer a
quiet, sophisticated, residential atmosphere that contrasts with the
hustle and bustle of Union Square and Fisherman’s Wharf. Here you see
well-dressed business travelers and tourists going about their business,
in contrast to the panhandlers and down-and-outers hanging around
Market Street. Nob Hill is also quite safe, even at night. Although you may
be walking up and down very steep grades, Nob Hill is really just a short
stroll from Union Square. Muni buses and the California Street cable car
provide any needed public transportation connections. And access to
some of the city’s finest bars and restaurants is often just an elevator ride
away. Nob Hill streets also offer breathtaking views of downtown.
The benefits of staying in Nob Hill include the following:
 The area is very safe.
 It’s more peaceful and residential than Union Square.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You need to be in good condition to walk up and down the hills.
 It’s expensive.
 Fewer shops and restaurants are nearby.
SoMa
South of Market Street (or SoMa for short) between Tenth, King, and
Steuart streets has exploded in the past 15 years, particularly along
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 69

Mission Street between Second and Fifth. The George Moscone
Convention Center, on Howard Street between Third and Fourth, pio-
neered the renaissance of this section of downtown, and was followed by
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Cartoon Art Museum,
Yerba Buena Gardens, and the kid-magnet Metreon (see Chapter 11).
Clubs have multiplied around Harrison Street; restaurants and bars are
thick from Howard Street down to the tiny South Park enclave.
Still, vestiges of the old neighborhood remain. Nearby Sixth Street is the
purview of seedy residential hotels and corner stores specializing in
cheap wine. Market Street itself is depressing west of Sixth Street — a
combination of low-rent tourist shops, peep shows, and check-cashing
counters, with a few legitimate theaters. The farther south you venture
toward I-80, the more industrial things get. And you’re competing for
space in hotels with thousands of guys wearing plastic nametags and
rushing to Moscone for that panel discussion on skeletal malocclusions.
The benefits of staying in SoMa include the following:
 It’s the center for cutting-edge art and performance.
 You can find lots of worthy ways to spend time.
 Some great restaurants and clubs are located in the area.
But here are the drawbacks:
 It still has a fringe element about it.
 The hotel choices are more limited than around Union Square.
 You get lots of convention traffic.
The Embarcadero
Liberated from the pylons and cement of the Embarcadero Freeway,
which was damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and subse-
quently torn down, the Embarcadero now glows in the light reflected off
the waters of the bay. Paralleling the eastern edge of Fisherman’s Wharf
to the beginning of China Basin, the views along the lovely stretch of
road that wraps around the northeast side of the city are some of the
most sigh-inducing — the Bay Bridge soars above you, Alcatraz seems a
mere stone’s throw away, and on sunny weekends sailboats blissfully
glide around the bay. The newly remodeled Ferry Building, a fitting cen-
terpiece at the end of Market Street, contains the best of the best food
purveyors.
This is a very safe area and is generally quiet in the evenings, except
during rush hour, when it’s a major thoroughfare for bridge traffic. The
most popular activities at the Embarcadero consist of promenading
slowly down Herb Caen Way (a stretch of sidewalk near the Ferry
Building named for the San Francisco Chronicle’s legendary columnist),
jogging, biking, skateboarding, and now shopping. With the Ferry
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
70

Building drawing out the locals, sections of the Embarcadero are as
lively as Union Square. Some of the hottest kitchens are based here, too,
and you can find music and nightlife in unexpected venues.
Locals also trek to the Embarcadero Center, a collection of five multiuse
office buildings connected by bridges and walkways, to check out the
upscale chain stores and movie theaters. You can catch BART and Muni
streetcars from the Embarcadero underground station to just about any-
where. A Muni extension from the Embarcadero to the Caltrain station
rolls down past the magnificent downtown ballpark, and charming old
streetcars breeze all the way down Market Street to Fisherman’s Wharf
and back. As for accommodations, the hotels are expensive. The neigh-
borhood’s popularity is apparent in the amount of building and remodel-
ing completed around the waterfront.
The benefits of staying in the Embarcadero include the following:
 It has beautiful bay views.
 It’s a great location for strollers and joggers.
 Public transportation options are excellent.
 It’s convenient to shopping and dining.
But here are the drawbacks:
 Rush-hour traffic is heavy.
 Hotel choices are limited (and expensive).
 Walks to other neighborhoods are relatively long.
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
Although just a few blocks separate North Beach from Fisherman’s
Wharf, the two neighborhoods are as different as focaccia is from sour-
dough. North Beach isn’t an actual beach of course — it’s the old Italian
neighborhood next to Chinatown. Head here to sit in cafes, to browse in
City Lights bookstore, and to sample the selections at the various delis
and pastry shops. Columbus Avenue is the main street, but you can find
family-style restaurants and crowded bars from Washington to Grant.
XXX-rated clubs stick together on Broadway; Telegraph Hill is to the
east, behind Coit Tower and the Filbert steps.
North Beach is the most European of any neighborhood in town, and the
one in which I’d most like to wake up. Ducking into a cafe for a latte,
choosing a pastry from any number of Italian bakeries, watching Chinese
senior citizens practicing tai chi in Washington Square Park — what a
heavenly way to pass the morning. Stores sell goods you haven’t already
seen a thousand times over, and the food is divine and diverse.
And then there’s Fisherman’s Wharf. I suppose 15.7 million tourists can’t
all be wrong, but just between you and me, I don’t get it. Located on Bay
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 71

Street between Powell and Polk streets, the former working piers were
the center of the city’s harbor and fishing industries. Now, waterfront life
is limited to a few sport-fishing boats for tourist attractions, and the
sounds of cash registers have usurped the old-timers.
A group of chain hotels huddles around North Point Street, about 2
blocks off the Hyde Street cable-car turnaround. A walk west along the
waterfront, through the most tourist-oriented section, ends at the
delightful Aquatic Park, but along the way, you pass a gauntlet of T-shirt
emporiums, fast-food eateries, knick-knack shops, and beggars, one of
whom camouflages himself with branches and jumps out at unsuspect-
ing pedestrians — I kid you not.
As you may guess, prices are slightly lower off-season in North Beach
and Fisherman’s Wharf, but so is the safety factor. Watch your wallet,
particularly around PIER 39. Auto break-ins are also a problem.
Depending on the weather, North Beach can be raucous during the
evenings, and blocks of Broadway pulsate with bars and girlie clubs.
Parking in either district is impossible unless you head for the nearest
garage, which can get expensive.
The benefits of staying in Fisherman’s Wharf/North Beach include the
following:
 You can navigate your way through either location on foot.
 You can find plenty of great meals in North Beach.
 You have access to convenient public transportation.
But here are the drawbacks:
 You’re surrounded by tourists on Fisherman’s Wharf.
 The parking is a nightmare.
 Hotel choices are limited.
The Marina/Cow Hollow
Between Van Ness Avenue, Broadway Street, Lyon Street, and Marina
Boulevard is the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood, a residential utopia
for singles of all ages. You’ll find famous Union Street, and 4 blocks farther
north, Chestnut Street, in these parts, both popular for their trendy clois-
ter of shops, restaurants, and young urban professionals. Architecture
and history fans can get a close look at the Octagon House (circa 1861)
at 2645 Gough St. (at Union).
If you’re driving to San Francisco or renting a car while you’re here, this
neighborhood has its advantages. Outdoorsy types love the location,
which is close to the Presidio and Crissy Field. Most, but not all, of the
accommodations here include free parking. You can walk to several great
sights from the Marina/Cow Hollow area, including the Exploratorium,
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
72

the Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Mason, and the Golden Gate Bridge. This is
a good neighborhood for families, because the prices are more reason-
able than in more tourist-oriented areas.
The downside of staying here is also the location. The majority of lodg-
ings in the area are motels along Lombard Street, a four- to six-lane con-
duit to the Golden Gate Bridge and Van Ness Avenue and the busiest
street in the city. Most visitors find the traffic horrendous in this area. 
A few hotels are located off the main drag (I review some in Chapter 9),
but great places to stay are somewhat hard to find.
The benefits of sleeping in the Marina/Cow Hollow area include the 
following:
 It’s near Chestnut and Union streets shopping.
 Hotel/motel parking is usually free.
 It’s within walking distance of the Marina and the Golden Gate
Bridge.
But here are the drawbacks:
 Accommodation choices are limited to motels and B&Bs.
 Traffic is heavy on Lombard Street.
 The immediate surroundings are less scenic.
Other ’hoods to discover
These districts are also where you may spend some time, including the
one where Barry Bonds’s homers wind up in the water!
The Castro
A historic and active gay community is the Castro’s claim to fame.
Visitors can admire the beautifully restored Victorian homes, visit the
Castro Theatre, and try out a new image in the superb men’s clothing
stores. For shopping and people-watching, head to Castro Street,
between Market and 18th streets.
China Basin/Mission Bay
This neighborhood is old, but before the Giants’ baseball stadium relo-
cated here visitors had no reason to explore the area. Boy, have things
changed: The area is teeming with new offices and live/work develop-
ments. King Street from Third Street to the Embarcadero is the main
drag; that’s where you can find restaurants, bars, and the boys of
summer. West of 3rd Street along the water is the new Mission Bay devel-
opment, featuring UCSF’s latest campus for research and teaching,
condos galore, and an entirely new neighborhood to serve them.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 73

Chinatown
The borders of Chinatown are always in a state of flux, but you can gen-
erally wander this densely packed area roughly between Broadway,
Taylor, Bush, and Montgomery streets. It is every bit as vivid and fasci-
nating as advertised. The Dragon Gate entrance on Grant Avenue leads
to touristy shops, but you’ll swear you’re in another country after you
wander up Stockton and through the abundant alleyways.
The Civic Center and Hayes Valley
If you’re seeking the New Main Library; the fairly new Asian Art Museum;
the Ballet, Symphony, and Opera buildings; or City Hall, then the Civic
Center, bordered by Van Ness and Golden Gate avenues, and Franklin,
Hyde, and Market streets, is where you want to be.
This neighborhood has a large homeless population and is dicey after
dark. If you have plans in the area at night, I recommend taking a cab.
Hayes Valley, west of Civic Center, is bound by Franklin Street to the
east, Webster Street to the west, Grove Street to the north, and Page
Street to the south. Here you’ll find hip places to shop and many quality
restaurants.
Financial District
The Financial District encompasses prime bay real estate roughly
between Montgomery Street and the Embarcadero, on either side of
Market Street. The Transamerica Pyramid, at Montgomery and Clay
streets, is a skyline landmark. Seek out Belden Place, an alley between
Kearny, Bush, and Pine streets, for outdoor dining opportunities.
Antiques hounds will like the hunting grounds around Jackson Square.
Haight-Ashbury
The Haight, or Haight-Ashbury, is surrounded by Stanyan Street to the
east, Divisadero Street to the west, Fulton Street to the north, and Waller
Street to the south. The area still hasn’t fully recovered from what must
have been a bummer to some of its residents — the demise of the ’60s.
You can find most of the action on Haight Street, which continues to
hold a magical appeal over scruffy groups of youngsters campaigning for
handouts. Used-clothing stores compete for space with all kinds of com-
mercial endeavors, most of which are perfectly legit.
Japantown
Off Geary, between Webster and Laguna streets, is Japantown, which at
first glance appears to consist of ugly indoor shopping centers.
However, you can find some good, inexpensive noodle restaurants and
some interesting shops housed in these dismal gray buildings. Check out
the AMC-Kabuki movie theaters here, or have a soak at the Kabuki Hot
Springs. Across Sutter Street (between Fillmore and Webster) look for
Cottage Row, the last morsel left of the old Japantown.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
74

The Mission District
Located from Cesar Chavez Street to Market Street between Dolores and
Potrero streets, the Mission District is a busy, largely Hispanic commu-
nity home to a growing number of artsy types seeking cheap (well, rela-
tively cheap) rentals. Check out Mission Dolores, Dolores Park, and 24th
Street, along with a plethora of affordable restaurants and eye-catching
outdoor murals. There’s a growing multitude of restaurants on Valencia
and Guererro streets between 16th and 23rd streets, and on 16th Street
between Mission and Guererro.
Pacific Heights
Pacific Heights, which is bordered by Broadway, Pine, Divisadero, and
Franklin streets, is where the wealthy lounge around their extravagant
but tasteful homes. You can visit the Haas-Lilienthal House, an 1886
Queen Anne Victorian at 2007 Franklin St., at Washington, and stare at
Mrs. Doubtfire’s fictional digs at Broadway and Steiner. The closest shop-
ping blocks are Fillmore Street between Jackson and Pine streets.
The Presidio
These 1,500 acres on the westernmost point of the city are part of the
Golden Gate National Recreation Area. If you love to hike, go to the visitor
center for maps and suggestions — the views and landscape are sensational.
If you’d rather play tenpins, a great little bowling alley is also located
here. A patch of Presidio land along the bay, named Crissy Fields, is the
newest park in the city and features wetlands, picnic areas, bay views,
and a drop-in center with weekend activities. That new collection of
buildings facing the bay belongs to George (Star Wars) Lucas and is the
Letterman Digital Arts Center campus.
The Richmond District
Stretching from Golden Gate Park at one edge to the Pacific Ocean at
the other, Lincoln Park, Land’s End, the California Palace of the Legion
of Honor museum, and the newly remodeled Cliff House are all located
in this large neighborhood. Clement Street is akin to Chinatown without
the fun architecture or alleyways, and you can find authentic Russian
food on Geary.
Russian Hill
Polk Street from Broadway up to around Greenwich Street has become
très chic. This is a delightful area for shopping and snacking with some
terrific little restaurants, bakeries, antiques shops, and boutiques. Just
to the northwest, you’ll find the wiggly part of Lombard Street and
Macondry Lane, immortalized in Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City.
The Tenderloin
The blocks bounded by Sutter and Mason streets and Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues are a section of town currently home to immigrant
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75

families — largely from Southeast Asia — attempting to live their lives
alongside flop houses, bars, massage parlors, and people subsiding on
the fringes of society. A slim rectangle of space from roughly O’Farrell to
Market streets between Larkin and Polk is dangerous at night and rough
during the day. The only place worth visiting here is Glide Memorial
Church for Sunday services, although the city is promoting the growing
presence of Vietnamese restaurants.
The Western Addition
I mention this old neighborhood between Geary, Haight, Gough, and
Divisadero streets because people studying their maps often believe it’s
an easy walk from Civic Center to Golden Gate Park by way of Oak or Fell
streets. That’s not entirely accurate. First, it’s hilly. Second, it’s not the
safest section of town. And third, it’s farther than it appears.
Finding Information After You Arrive
If you need more information about the city, ask your concierge or desk
clerk, or stop by the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information
Center on the lower level of Hallidie Plaza, 900 Market St. (at Powell), or
call % 800-220-5747 or 415-391-2000. The office is open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
during the summer. It’s closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s Day,
Easter Sunday, and Sundays from November to April.
Look for a free Bay Guardian or SF Weekly from sidewalk kiosks or coffee-
houses for listings of city events and entertainment. The Convention and
Visitors Bureau also operates a 24-hour events line at % 415-391-2001.
Getting Around San Francisco
As you may glean from earlier chapters, having a car in the city isn’t
advised and isn’t necessary most of the time. San Francisco really caters
to walkers, with benches appearing just when you need one and cafes at
hand for a shot of caffeine when energy flags. Getting around on a bus or
Muni metro streetcar is cheap if not perfect. In the rare instance that
you do need a car, renting one downtown is easy and convenient.
This section contains everything you need to know about cruising
around the city sans auto. It even includes some inside tips on parking
should you decide to throw caution to the wind and join the legendary
drivers — and I don’t mean that in a good way — gracing our city’s
roads and highways.
The one-stop shopping number for traffic or public transit information is
% 415-817-1717. This number connects you to whatever you need,
whether BART and Muni routes or traffic conditions.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
76

Heading Out on Foot
Walking is the best way to travel if you aren’t in a rush, and it’s also the
only way to really see and enjoy the neighborhoods. I recommend some
walking tours in Chapter 11, and I can’t urge you enough to take one or
more. Walking is the only means of seeing the city properly, and if you
get a good tour guide you’ll discover some interesting tidbits as well.
Use caution when walking, because San Francisco has seen a rash of
vehicle/pedestrian accidents. Be alert at all times. Watch for drivers run-
ning red lights (a common occurrence here) or turning right on a red
light; make absolutely sure bus drivers see you entering the crosswalk.
Among the best neighborhoods for walkers are Chinatown, North
Beach, Russian Hill, and the Embarcadero. If you’re in good shape and
don’t mind a little wind, a walk across the Golden Gate Bridge is much
more satisfying than a drive, especially if you’re the one who has to keep
your eyes on the road.
Traveling by Streetcar
Walking probably won’t take you everywhere you want to go. But getting
around by public transportation is a breeze when you know a few
basics. The San Francisco Municipal Railway, known as Muni (% 415-
673-6864; www.sfmuni.com), is much maligned by locals for inefficiency,
but tens of thousands of commuters rely daily on its buses and electric
streetcars for a lift to the office. The fare is $1.50 for an adult and 50¢ for
seniors 65 and older and children 5 to 17 to ride a bus or streetcar any-
where in the system; exact change is required. Muni Passports, accepted
on buses, streetcars, and even cable cars, are a bargain for visitors plan-
ning to take public transportation extensively. A one-day passport is $11,
a three-day pass is $18, and a seven-day pass is $24. You can purchase
them at the Tix Bay Area booth in Union Square, at the cable-car ticket
booth on Market and Powell streets, at the Beach and Hyde streets
cable-car ticket booth, or online at www.sfmuni.com. You may also pur-
chase single-day passes onboard the cable cars.
Citypass (www.citypass.net), a booklet of discounted tickets to six
major attractions (the Museum of Modern Art, Palace of the Legion 
of Honor/de Young museums, California Academy of Sciences &
Steinhart Aquarium or the Asian Art Museum, the Exploratorium,
Aquarium of the Bay, and a Blue & Gold Bay Cruise), includes a seven-
day Muni Passport, making it quite a bargain for those ambitious enough
to use all the coupons. It’s $49 for adults, $39 for kids, and you can pur-
chase it online or at the participating attractions (% 415-705-5555).
At the underground Muni stops from Civic Center to the Embarcadero,
the fare boxes (which are located at the entry point prior to reaching the
escalators) only accept coins or tokens, an important point to remember
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

if you’re in a hurry and have only dollar bills in hand. Change machines
are located on the walls next to the BART ticket dispensers.
Muni streetcars run underground downtown and above ground in the
outlying neighborhoods from 6 a.m. until 1 a.m. The five Muni Metro
streetcar lines — the J, K, L, M, and N — make the same stops as BART
(see the discussion later) along Market Street, including Embarcadero
Station, Montgomery and Powell streets (both near Union Square), Civic
Center, and Van Ness Avenue. Past Van Ness Avenue, the routes go off in
different directions. The N-Judah line services Haight-Ashbury and paral-
lels Golden Gate Park on its way down Judah Street to the ocean. The 
J-Church line passes close to Mission Dolores and the Castro. The 
L-Taraval line travels through the Sunset District within walking distance
of the San Francisco Zoo.
The newest and most picturesque line, the F-Market, is made up of a col-
lection of vintage streetcars from the United States and Europe. It runs
along Market Street to the Castro Street station and back. The F line was
extended in 2000, allowing these rejuvenated cars to continue from
Market Street over to Mission Street and down the Embarcadero to
Fisherman’s Wharf. Muni cars marked Mission Bay end their journey at
the Caltrain Station on King Street, just past the AT&T baseball park.
Spend the $3 to get the Official San Francisco Street and Transit Muni
Map. It is invaluable for public transportation users. It shows all bus,
streetcar, cable-car, and BART routes and stations. You can buy the
maps at the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center and
cable-car ticket booths. You can also call % 415-673-MUNI for route
information.
Trekking by Bus
The Muni buses are clearly numbered on the front and run through the
city from 6 a.m. to midnight (however, I don’t recommend taking them
late at night). Street-corner signs and painted yellow bands on utility
poles and on curbs mark bus stops. Buses come by every 5 to 20 min-
utes, depending on where you want to go and the time of day. Rapid
transit — in the truest sense of the adjective — they are not, but with 
80 routes, they are the most complete. Muni metro streetcars are faster,
but the buses cover a wider area. Expect most buses to be extremely
crowded during rush hours (from 7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.).
Exact change is required on the buses, as it is on the streetcars (for
information on fares, see the section, “Traveling by Streetcar,” earlier in
this chapter). Ask the driver for a transfer, which is good for a second
ride within two hours. If you plan on riding another bus or streetcar
within the time limit, you’ll be happy to have that slip of paper.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
78

Befriending BART
BART (% 415-989-2278; www.bart.gov), which stands for Bay Area
Rapid Transit, is not Muni. Tourists often get the two systems mixed up
because they share the same underground stations downtown. You
won’t get into too much trouble if you get the systems confused within
the city limits, but BART runs all over the Bay Area and if you’re inatten-
tive, you may end up in a place far different from where you expected to
go. More than one unsuspecting traveler has ended up in Fremont when
he intended to exit at the Embarcadero. If BART is what you want, check
the signs in the stations and pay attention to the cars themselves. The
silver-and-blue BART trains do not resemble Muni’s orange-trimmed
electric streetcars in the least. You purchase tickets for BART from
machines at the station. Fares to and from any point in the city are $1.40
each way; outside the city, fares vary depending on how far down the
line you go. You can’t use Muni transfers, tokens, or passes on BART.
Getting Around by Cable Car
There’s no city statute that says you have to ride the cable cars, but
what self-respecting tourist would leave San Francisco without climbing
aboard? Three lines cross the downtown area. If you’re in the mood for
some scenery, take the Powell-Hyde line, which begins at Powell Street
and ends at the turnaround across from Ghirardelli Square. The Powell-
Mason line goes through North Beach and ends near Fisherman’s Wharf.
The California Street line, the least scenic, crests at Nob Hill and then
makes its way to Van Ness Avenue. (The lines for the California Street
cable cars are usually much shorter because the route isn’t as twisty.)
Rides are $5 one-way, so buy a Muni Passport and take all three as often
as you like. The pass is worth every penny. You may only board a cable
car at specific, clearly marked stops.
Cable cars operate from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., but I suggest taking one
early or late in the day if you want to have a little elbowroom. Plus, the
fare is only $1 before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m.
Catching a Taxi
You can easily get a taxi downtown, especially in front of hotels, but you
have to call a cab to retrieve you almost anywhere else. Unfortunately,
reaching the taxi companies by phone can take a while. Keep these num-
bers handy:
 Desoto Cab: % 415-970-1300
 Luxor Cabs: % 415-282-4141
 Veteran’s Cab: % 415-648-1313
 Yellow Cab: % 415-626-2345

Motoring Around on Your Own
Drivers unfamiliar with the area often have a difficult time navigating the
heavy downtown traffic and multitude of one-way streets. Add to these
problems the lack of parking and heavy-handed meter maids, and leav-
ing your car outside the city limits makes sense. However, if you plan to
go over the Golden Gate or Bay bridges, or south to Monterey and Santa
Cruz, a car will be essential.
Dealing with rush hour
During the week, traffic backs up on bridge approaches throughout the
Financial District and downtown from 3 p.m. until about 7 p.m. North
Beach is usually busy from the late afternoon into the evenings, and

because the streets bump into Columbus Avenue, navigating the area
can be confusing. On the weekends, Lombard Street and Van Ness
Avenue take the brunt of all the cars inching their way toward the
Golden Gate Bridge. Getting through Chinatown’s narrow, crowded
streets by car is basically impossible during waking hours. If you must
cross town, I suggest taking California Street past the Financial District.
For sanity’s sake, avoid traveling north on the Golden Gate or Bay
bridges between 3 and 7 p.m. weekdays. If you plan to drive to Point
Reyes or the Wine Country (see Chapter 14), do not leave on a Friday
after 2 p.m., if at all possible. Traffic across the Golden Gate Bridge is
awful on weekends, especially if the weather is nice. Go before noon on a
Friday, and avoid returning on a Sunday afternoon.
Driving by the rules
California law requires that both drivers and passengers wear seat belts.
You may turn right at a red light (unless otherwise indicated) after yield-
ing to traffic and pedestrians and after making a complete stop. Cable
cars and streetcars always have the right-of-way, as do pedestrians,
especially if they use intersections and crosswalks. On Market Street,
one lane is exclusively for buses unless you’re making a right turn. Heed
the signs.
Being cautious with red lights
San Francisco drivers have a tendency to run red lights, so pause to
check oncoming traffic before entering an intersection just after the light
turns green.
Parking the car
I’m not going to take up space discussing the many parking laws; just
take my advice: Park in a garage. They are expensive but could save you
some money in the long run because parking tickets start at $40.
Legal street parking spaces are next to unpainted curbs. Yellow-, white-,
green-, and red-painted curbs are all off-limits in general — the only
exception being commercial zones (yellow curbs), which are okay to
park in after delivery hours. Pay attention to the signs posted on the
streets. Be aware of tow-away zones. You can’t park on most streets
downtown between 4 and 6 p.m. without running the risk of having your
car towed. Otherwise, you’ll find your rental at the AutoReturn Lot at
450 Seventh St., at Harrison Street (% 415-865-8200), faster than you
can say “Where’d I park the car?” If your wheels aren’t where you
thought you left them, call % 415-553-1239 to find out whether your
vehicle has been towed or merely stolen. If your car has been towed,
you’ll need to go to AutoReturn in person to pay the ticket and the stor-
age charges (which vary depending on how long the car has been there).
This misadventure will cost you at least $185, cash or credit card only.

Legal parking spots are hard to come by. If you’re driving, park in a
public garage or use the services of a valet. And if you do happen to find
a legal space within walking distance of your destination, grab it.
Improving your parking karma
So, you want a parking space, huh? You’ll have to be one step ahead of
the crowd. Try these suggestions for a little edge:
 Carry quarters. Most parking meters accept nothing else; 25¢ buys
six minutes in most parts of town.
 Watch the clock. Many crosstown downtown streets do not allow
parking during rush hour, from 4 to 6 p.m. Get to the Financial
District, Union Square, SoMa, or Nob Hill a few minutes before 
6 p.m. to grab the great street parking space of your choice.
 Spring for valet parking. The extra money now may be worth
avoiding the headache of finding a parking spot later.
 Check out public parking garages. Public parking garages are
cheaper than private ones. In North Beach, park in the garage on
Vallejo Street (between Kearny and Green). In Chinatown, park at
the Portsmouth Square garage on Kearny Street.
 Make note of street-sweeping times. If you find street parking
galore in some outlying neighborhood, check signs for sweeping
hours and days. That’s generally the real reason for your good luck.
Don’t park without checking the signs, unless you want to give the
Department of Traffic a $35 donation. If your timing is right how-
ever, you’ll pull up after the sweeper trucks have made their
rounds, when it’s perfectly okay to park.
 Stop “runaway” car syndrome. To keep your car from rolling away
while you’re parked on a hill, put the car in gear, apply the hand
brake, and curb your wheels — turn your wheels toward the curb
when facing downhill and away from the curb when facing uphill.
It’s the law! (This tip won’t contribute to your finding a parking
place, but it will help you keep the one you found.)

Checking In at 
San Francisco’s Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Choosing your chain or independent hotel
 Getting the best rates
 Using the Internet to uncover hotel deals
 Knowing the questions to ask to get the room you want
 Getting a room if you don’t have reservations
 Discovering the perfect San Francisco hotel
S
o, you’re ready to make San Francisco your home — for a short
period of time at least. You probably have an idea of how much
you’re willing to spend (if not, check out Chapter 4), and you may have
an idea what neighborhood suits your fancy (see Chapter 8 for descrip-
tions). Other features and amenities will be important to you, too. If you
don’t stay in hotels very often, you may not know what level of service
or quality of room you really need to enjoy your stay. Consider, among
other variables, whether you really care if your room resembles some-
thing out of Condé Nast Traveler, has a clear view of the bay, is vulnera-
ble to street noise, or has a bathtub large enough for you and a close
friend. Will you feel despondent if the hotel can’t supply a cup of herbal
tea at 10 p.m.? Will you behave badly all day if you can’t hit the treadmill
first thing in the morning? If you’re traveling with your laptop, is Wi-Fi a
necessity? If you’re traveling with your lap dog, is the hotel Fido
friendly? Avoid disappointment and surprises by discussing your
requirements with the reservations staff.
The hotel selections in this chapter are, in my opinion, among the best
in San Francisco — balancing comfort, location, character, and price.
With few exceptions, each has a distinct, only-in-San-Francisco style I
believe you’ll find memorable and pleasing. For those traveling on fre-
quent-flier miles (which you can sometimes redeem for rooms, or rack
up additional miles for staying at a partner hotel), you won’t find many
of the big chain hotels listed here, but there are plenty: Turn to the
appendix for toll-free numbers and Web sites. I also leave out the major-
ity of hotels on less desirable blocks, many of the priciest palaces, as

Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 85

well as those a bit too far from the action. Finally, two very well known
hotels are listed that I actually don’t love, but I include them for reasons
mentioned in the write-ups.
See the indexes at the end of this chapter for lists of recommended
hotels organized by neighborhood and price.
No matter where you stay in San Francisco, you’re no more than 20 min-
utes by cab from the major sites, shopping areas, and restaurants. The
majority of the city’s hotels are in a few of the central neighborhoods.
With guidance from Chapter 8, pick the neighborhood you want to stay
in based on your interests and needs — for example, are you hoping to
shop the major stores? Are you an enthusiastic museum-goer? Do you
hope to find peace and quiet? Or do you want to be close to the bay?
Refer to Frommer’s San Francisco (Wiley Publishing) for accommoda-
tions in neighborhoods outside the central part of the city that aren’t
covered here, or go to Citysearch (www.sanfrancisco.citysearch.
com), where you can search for hotels by area and price.
Getting to Know Your Options
Hotels come in many shapes, sizes, and price ranges. You’ll find chain
hotels and motels, independent hotels, and hotels that serve business
travelers rather than vacationers. So what are the differences between
these various accommodations?
Choosing between chain hotels 
and independent hotels
Hotels affiliated with huge chains, such as Holiday Inn, Hilton, Sheraton,
Marriott, and Hyatt, are often monolithic or merely architecturally
homely structures that are a bit on the boring side and look pretty much
the same wherever you travel. Even the rooms will have similar, if not
identical, décor. But there’s a comfort in that, and for travelers who like
the assurance of a brand name, chains are a fine choice. In San
Francisco, businesspeople and conventioneers often make up the clien-
tele at these hotels. The appendix at the back of this book has a list of
toll-free telephone numbers for the major chains.
Independent hotels (sometimes also called boutique hotels) are smaller in
scope than the big-name properties. They target travelers who want a
unique, individualized atmosphere with a local slant. Some appeal to
older couples seeking quiet and cozy budget lodgings, while other inde-
pendents seek to attract a sophisticated traveler with hip furnishings and
wild color schemes. San Francisco is a leader in the boutique hotel scene,
with a great assortment to choose from. If you want more-interesting sur-
roundings, where your fellow guests may be movie fans, literati, musi-
cians, or shopaholics, you may enjoy a stay in a boutique hotel.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
86

Make sure you know what you’re getting into, though — boutique hotels
are not for everyone. The needs of a business traveler are not met at
lower-end independent hotels, and staff members are not always imme-
diately available to answer questions or provide services. Room service
is also iffy unless a restaurant is connected to the property. However,
San Francisco’s boutique properties tend to provide good to amazing
levels of service and amenities.
Do I really get breakfast in bed? Unpacking in a B&B
B&Bs, or bed-and-breakfast inns, can come in the form of an extra bed-
room or two in a private home or a house renovated for the purpose of
providing accommodations to visitors. Some B&Bs are lavishly deco-
rated, with an owner who prides himself on serving gourmet breakfasts
and afternoon sherry. Other owners put less effort into the business,
keeping some food in the fridge and engaging in casual conversation
with guests about the local sites, rather than providing any official tour
guidance. Accommodations at a B&B usually come with a continental or
full breakfast. You may have to share the bathroom with fellow guests.
Rooms at B&Bs are usually more economical than hotel accommoda-
tions, but a few luxury B&Bs have equally high-end prices.
Some small hotels advertise as B&Bs. In general, these properties have a
dozen or so bedrooms, include continental breakfast with the room, and
often offer wine in the afternoon.
I recommend a few stellar B&Bs in this book, but plenty more are in the
city. For more information on bed-and-breakfasts and lists of properties,
the following resources can help:
 Bed & Breakfast San Francisco (% 415-899-0060; www.bbsf.com).
This organization has information on small B&Bs.
 California Association of Bed and Breakfast Inns, 2715 Porter St.,
Soquel, CA 95073 (% 800-373-9251; www.cabbi.com). Their Web
site has links to member inns.
 Bed and Breakfast Inns of Napa Valley (% 707-944-4444; www.
napavalley.com/lodging). This organization is a great resource if
you plan to take a side trip to Wine Country.
Family ties: Choosing a kid-friendly hotel
The younger generation loves San Francisco for its beauty, wealth of
activities, great food, and those cable cars. Hotels are waking up to the
fact that families appreciate attention paid to their children, but by and
large, that’s going to mean different things to different marketing depart-
ments. The Ritz-Carlton, for example, will send a bellhop to baby-proof
your quarters and provide the nanny with some aspirin, while the desk
clerk at Hotel Del Sol will dig out a beach ball for the kids. Few hotels
have swimming pools, by the way. (For more on accommodations for
families, take a look at Frommer’s San Francisco with Kids, published by
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 87

Wiley Publishing.) If you’re taking your darlings along on this trip, you
have three choices for sleeping arrangements: Share a room with them,
rent two rooms, or reserve a suite.
Sharing a room with your family means reserving a double/double,
queen/queen, or king/king — one room with two double, queen, or king
beds. Double/doubles are the least expensive option and work best for a
family of four with kids too young to have a room of their own. If you
come to terms with the fact that you won’t be staying up late, you won’t
be sleeping in, and this trip will revolve around the kids’ needs, you can
have a calm holiday.
Renting two rooms connected by an interior door or across the hall from
each other is a great option if you have a large family or are traveling
with older, more independent kids. Although you end up spending twice
the money, renting two rooms ensures that you can get some R & R from
the rigors of parenting, if only for a few blissful hours.
Reserving a suite may seem like an extravagant way to give yourself a
little space while keeping a close eye on the children, but it’s really a
clever way to enjoy a high-quality hotel experience. Look at it this way:
$260 buys you two rooms at the Golden Gate Hotel on Union Square, but
at the Lambourne, $299 sets the nuclear family up in a two-room suite
complete with a stereo system, compact kitchenette, and continental
breakfast in the tony environs of Nob Hill.
Unlike in resort destinations, few hotels in San Francisco offer special
kids’ programs or amenities. The hotels that I designate as Kid Friendly
are the ones that are a good choice for families because of room size,
location, or their willingness, in my opinion, to accommodate a family’s
needs and make them feel welcome.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room. If you
walked in off the street and asked for a room, the rack rate is the amount
you would be billed. The hotel usually posts the rate on the back of your
door, along with the fire/emergency exit diagrams.
Hotels will be delighted to charge you the rack rate, but you often don’t
have to pay it, especially if the hotel isn’t full. The best way to avoid this
is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate when
you book. Things like special weekend rates or AAA and AARP discounts
can add up to big savings, so don’t be afraid to ask. If your timing is right
and business is slow, you may be pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay depends 
on many factors — chief among them how you make your reservation. 
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
88

A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with certain hotels
than you can get yourself. (That’s because the hotel often gives the
agent a discount in exchange for steering business toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier pro-
grams, any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or
your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for
that matter — when you call to book. You never know when the affilia-
tion may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
The rack rates I give in the hotel listings do not include the 14 percent
hotel tax. And those outrageous valet garage prices are per day. Many of
these hotels offer weekend discounts and parking or breakfast packages.
Before you book, always ask if any specials, packages, or promotions are
going on that may get you a better deal.
If you’re driving, don’t feel obliged to use the hotel’s valet to park. The
cost just keeps increasing. If you’re planning to keep the car garaged,
drop your luggage at the hotel and head to the nearest public parking
structure. Around Union Square, you’ll find the Ellis-O’Farrell Garage,
123 O’Farrell St. ($30 per day; % 415-986-4800; www.eofgarage.com);
the Sutter-Stockton Garage, 444 Stockton St. ($26 per day; % 415-982-
7275); and the Union Square Garage, 333 Post St. ($31 per day; % 415-
397-0631). SoMa has the city’s largest garage, the Fifth and Mission
Garage, 833 Mission St. ($23 per day; % 415-982-8522; www.fifthand
mission.com). Of course, you don’t get in-and-out privileges, nor will
anyone fetch the car for you, but one of the biggest complaints hotel
guests have is how slow the valets are to bring the cars around. Save
yourself time and money and self-park.
Getting the Best Room at the Best Rate
Obviously, you can get all the service and style you want if price is no
object. But when it is, as is so often the case, here’s a little advice for
chatting up the reservations desk: Charm is useful; being completely
clear about your expectations is just as important.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 89

Finding the best rate
Make sure you cover all the bases when researching hotels. Sometimes
you can get the best rate through the hotel’s toll-free reservations
number, but sometimes the local manager will run a discount or promo-
tion that central reservations doesn’t know about, and it’s better to call
the hotel directly. Also, most hotels are now likely to meet any price you
can get on an Internet hotel reservation service. That way they still get
your business without paying a commission to the service.
If you reserve over the Internet, print out your booking transaction
(including your confirmation number) and bring it with you. Hotels have
been known to make mistakes on the final bill, such as charging for park-
ing or breakfast when it was included in a package or promotion, and
proof in hand will smooth negotiations.
When budgeting for hotel rates, watch out for hidden fees and extra
costs. Knowing things up front is better than getting stuck later.
Traveling with man’s best friend? Be sure to ask if there’s a cleaning
charge for pets on top of the room rate.
Figuring in taxes and extra expenses
A hotel room that costs $99 a night actually will end up closer to $114
because of the hotel tax. It’s steep, but it’s unavoidable. Room-service
charges can also inflate your final room tab. Local phone calls, minibars
in your room, enticing baskets of goodies on an end table — none of
these are gratis (unless they’re marked “complimentary”).
If you like to snack in bed, buy your favorite goodies at a nearby market
or convenience store, and bring them up to your room.
Don’t forget that most hotels tack on a fee for merely dialing out on the
phone in your room. This starts at 75¢ and increases depending on what
the market will bear. This is, of course, in addition to long-distance
charges. For dinner reservations or event tickets, let your hotel
concierge do the talking.
Bargain hunting in season
Officially, the low season in San Francisco is from November to March,
but one highly experienced downtown concierge joked that the low
season was the weekends (when business travelers leave town).
Although more tourists do visit between spring and early fall, your actual
concerns should center around convention and business travelers. The
San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau keeps a calendar of major
conventions, and I recommend checking with them before you finalize
your plans (see the appendix). Hotels and restaurants around Union
Square and SoMa are always packed when Moscone Center is booked.
Generally, you’ll get your best rate in the winter, on weekends when the
suits go home, and around holidays when you’re actually supposed to
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
90

be at Cousin Seymour’s and not gallivanting around San Francisco. Don’t
let that discourage you from arriving whenever it’s convenient for you,
of course. Just make your reservations far in advance.
As room rates fluctuate with the season (and the economy), occupancy
rates also rise and fall. A hotel is less likely to extend discount rates if it
is close to full, but most (the Ritz-Carlton being an exception) will negoti-
ate if they’re close to empty. Tourist-oriented hotels usually offer dis-
counted rates for midweek stays because they’re usually most crowded
on weekends. The reverse is true for business hotels downtown. Wine
Country hotels tend to charge the most in the fall, around harvest time,
and on weekends during the summer. Rates listed in this book are proba-
bly different from the rate you’ll be quoted when you make your reserva-
tion, because room prices are subject to change without notice. In
addition, discounts for membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier pro-
grams, and other programs can change room rates significantly, regard-
less of the season. The word on the street is that hotel room prices are
on the increase as are occupancy rates.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
You can sometimes get a good deal by booking through a lodging Web
site. Although the major travel Web sites (such as Travelocity, Expedia,
Yahoo! Travel, and Cheap Tickets) offer hotel booking, you’re often
better off using a site devoted primarily to lodging, because you may
find properties that aren’t listed with more general online travel agen-
cies. Some lodging sites specialize in a particular type of accommoda-
tion, such as bed-and-breakfasts, which you won’t find on the more
mainstream booking services. Others, such as Travelweb (see the fol-
lowing list), offer weekend deals on major chain properties, which cater
to business travelers and have more empty rooms on weekends.
(However, national chains now offer the same prices on their own sites
as you’ll find on travel Web sites.)
Don’t assume that the hotels offered on the sites are all in handy, safe
neighborhoods or offer the amenities you want. These sites merely list
the properties; they don’t judge them.
Check out these hotel-lodging sites on the Web:
 The name All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com) is some-
thing of a misnomer, but the site does have tens of thousands of
listings throughout the world. Bear in mind that each hotel has
paid a small fee (of $25 and up) to be listed, so it’s less an objective
list and more like a book of online brochures.
 TravelNow (www.travelnow.com) lists bargain rates at hotels in
more than 50 cities. The cool thing is that TravelNow prebooks
blocks of rooms in advance, so sometimes it has rooms — at dis-
count rates — at hotels that are “sold out.” Select a city, enter your
dates, and you get a list of best prices for a selection of hotels. This
site is notable for delivering deep discounts in cities where hotel
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 91

rooms are expensive, but don’t assume all their listings are for
hotels you’d feel comfortable in. The toll-free number (% 800-511-
5741) is printed all over this site; call it if you want more options
than are listed online.
 InnSite (www.innsite.com) has B&B listings in all 50 U.S. states.
You can find an inn at your destination, see pictures of the rooms,
and check prices and availability. This extensive directory of bed-
and-breakfasts only includes listings if the proprietor submitted
one (getting an inn listed is free). The descriptions are written by
the innkeepers, and many listings link to the inns’ own Web sites.

com).
 Places to Stay (% 800-390-4687; www.placestostay.com) lists
one-of-a-kind places in the United States and abroad that you may
not find in other directories, with a focus on resort accommoda-
tions. Again, listing is selective — this isn’t a comprehensive direc-
tory, but it can give you a sense of what’s available at different
destinations.
 Travelweb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 26,000 hotels,
focusing on major chains, and you can book almost 90 percent of
these online. Travelweb’s Click-It Weekends, updated each Monday,
offers weekend deals at many leading hotel chains.
 HotelRes (www.hotelres.com) lists over 245 hotels in and around
San Francisco, including most of those mentioned in this book. The
site is easy to navigate and clearly lists amenities, driving direc-
tions, and room availability/prices for specific dates. It’s one of the
best San Francisco–centric hotel sites I’ve checked.
Finally, always examine the hotel’s own Web pages. I found a terrific deal
on the site of one of my favorite hotels, and the price was $40 a night
less than what the reservations clerk offered me over the phone.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia (% 800-EXPEDIA; www.expedia.com)
offers a long list of special deals and virtual tours or photos of available
rooms so you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps
counter the claims that the best rooms are often held back from bargain
booking Web sites). Travelocity (% 888-872-8356; www.travelocity.
com) posts unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties
according to the AAA rating system.
Also reliable are Hotels.com (% 800-246-8357; www.hotels.com) and
Quikbook.com (% 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com). An excellent
free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search
multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of —
and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes
and service charges. Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), which I discuss
earlier, is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton,
Hyatt, and Starwood chains) and is, therefore, plugged directly into the
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
92

hotels’ reservations systems — unlike independent agencies, which
have to fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of
which get misplaced. More than once, travelers have arrived at the hotel,
only to be told that they have no reservation. To be fair, many of the
major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of use, and
Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations systems
of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for consumers.
In the meantime, get a confirmation number and make a printout of any
online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) and
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) are even better for hotels than for airfares;
with both, you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality level of
your hotel before offering up your money. On the downside, many hotels
stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay up front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t
provide loyalty-program credits or other frequent-guest amenities when
you book a room through opaque online services.
The Web can be a good resource for hotel deals, but in my humble opin-
ion, you usually get the most accurate information by calling the hotel
directly. No matter what assurances you receive from online agencies,
travel agency Web sites cannot guarantee specific rooms (unless, per-
haps, you requested the bridal or presidential suite), and they know
very little about the hotel they’re selling. In many cases, the “reviews”
you read online are provided and paid for by the hotels and, therefore,
are likely to be promotional rather than critical.
Another problem recently brought to my attention is the difficulty in get-
ting a refund from some of these reservation services if you have to
cancel your stay. It’s the service, not the hotel, that has your money
until it settles with the hotel after you’ve checked out. Finally, there may
be a difference between the amount of dough you pay the agency for
your room and the amount the agency pays the hotel (that’s the profit
motive for you). If you don’t like the place, again, you’re stuck negotiat-
ing for a refund from the online agency rather than the hotel itself.
Reserving the best room
After you’ve made your reservation, asking one or two pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you have the best room in
the house:
 Is there a corner on the market? Ask for a corner room. They’re
usually larger, quieter, closer to the elevator, and have more win-
dows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always cost
any more.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 93

 What’s that noise? Inquire about the location of the restaurants,
bars, and discos in the hotel — these could all be a source of irri-
tating noise. The quietest rooms tend to be on the highest floors,
facing away from the street.
 Are you renovating? If the hotel is renovating, request a room
away from the jackhammers. And try to get a room on the most
recently renovated floor — the furnishings and décor will be newer
and nicer.
 Does this room come in another color? If you aren’t happy with
your room, talk to the front-desk manager. If he has another room
available, he should be happy to accommodate you, within reason.
 What size beds do you offer? If having a queen- or king-size bed is
important to you, be sure to ask for it when booking.
 Mind if I smoke? You can smoke outside in San Francisco to your
heart’s content, but be aware that the city has stringent antismok-
ing laws inside public buildings, restaurants, and even bars. A siz-
able number of hotels, especially the smaller ones, are smoke-free.
Other hotels only have smoking rooms on designated floors.
Common courtesy in San Francisco is to ask before lighting up;
you’d be surprised at the number of people who are allergic to
smoke. If a smoking (or nonsmoking) room is important to you, let
the reservations desk know when you call.
Arriving without Reservations
I am amazed at how many people come to San Francisco without hotel
reservations, believing that a fabulous $30-a-night room is awaiting them
in a fancy hotel. They usually end up sleeping in the “No-Tell Motel” in a
dicey neighborhood because that’s all that was available. Or they spend
the better part of a day looking for accommodations, wasting valuable
vacation time searching for a bargain, or finally, just a room, when there
are none to be had. Don’t be one of them. Reserve your vacation lodg-
ings ahead of time.
However, if you’re reading this book in the airport while waiting to board
your flight to our fair city, you can try the following suggestions if you
don’t have a place to stay already:
 Call a free reservation service such as San Francisco Reservations
(% 800-677-1500 or 510-628-4450 outside of North America) or
California Reservations (% 415-252-1107).
 Make your way to a boutique hotel and hope the desk clerk takes
pity on you. Most of the boutique properties in town are part of
small, independent companies, and a good-hearted staff person
may be willing to make some calls to sister hotels to help you
secure a room.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
94

 Find a friendly concierge you can leave your luggage with so you
can look for a room in the neighborhood unencumbered. If the
town appears to be booked solid (ask the desk clerk’s opinion),
don’t be picky or cheap. You can always move the next day if some-
thing better opens up.
Getting the Most for Your Money
Every accommodation that I recommend in this book is marked with one
to four dollar signs. Here’s a quick breakdown of the price categories,
and what amenities and services you should expect in each range. All
rates are for a standard double-occupancy room, excluding taxes.
 $ ($125 or less): Accommodations in this category are often in
older buildings that may show their age. Room service, laundry or
dry cleaning, valet parking, and porters do not come with the pack-
age, but the rooms are carefully tended, and the properties them-
selves exhibit some charm. The least expensive rooms may not
have their own bathrooms.
The rooms I recommend in this price category tend to be on the
“cozy” side and are typically furnished with inexpensive bed-
spreads, towels, and curtains. You won’t find irons, little toiletries,
or robes in the closet. Air-conditioning is also considered a luxury,
although you rarely need it in San Francisco. A concierge won’t be
at the ready to cater to your every whim, but most desk clerks are
delighted to help you arrange tours, tickets for shows, and dinner
reservations. Many of the budget hotels recommended here offer a
free continental breakfast, making them especially good deals.
 $$ ($126–$175): In this price category, I recommend some wonderful,
charming places with stylish (but still small) rooms, handsome lob-
bies, and good to great service. Antique armoires and marble-tiled
bathrooms are standard-issue in a few picks, but in general, these
properties are for leisure travelers with minimal demands beyond
comfort and an appealing décor. A separate concierge desk is not
always available, but the front desk staff is usually willing to make
reservations and book tours. Parking is sometimes valet, but more
often it’s self-parking at lots up to 3 blocks away. Room service is usu-
ally nonexistent, although you will probably find a cafe or restaurant
attached to the property. Make sure to inquire about extras such as
bathrobes and modem lines if these things are important to you.
Often the more expensive suites are well equipped, but the low-end
rooms won’t have that all-important hair dryer unless you ask for it.
 $$$ ($176–$300): At this price, expect attentive service — usually
including valet parking and porters — and larger rooms with finer
fabrics and décor. Many properties in this range also have on-site
StairMasters, and at least one has a pool. Although at the low end
of this scale you may not find hand-milled soaps in the bathroom,
at the high end, you’ll feel pretty pampered.
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 95

When you’re willing to pay this kind of money for a hotel, you prob-
ably have certain expectations. Make them known when you make
your reservation. Don’t wait until check-in to ask if you can receive
faxes or if valet parking actually means a bellhop is going to fetch
your car for you at 6 a.m.
 $$$$ ($301 or more): Your big bucks buy views, personal service,
and sheets with high thread counts. Be prepared to be royally pam-
pered by the well-trained staff. Large rooms usually feature fancy
products and thick terry robes in the mirrored bathroom, an iron in
the closet, art on the walls, and in some cases, umbrellas and flowers.
Honor bars and baskets of overpriced goodies are also standard.
For this much money, it would be a shame if you didn’t spend some
quality time in the hotel, fingering the drapes and calling down to
the concierge desk for a weather report. Again, room rates are tied
to location, with Nob Hill and the Embarcadero charging whatever
the market will bear.
San Francisco’s Best Hotels
Andrews Hotel
$–$$
Union Square
The services and location make this 48-room 1905 Victorian hotel a deal for
couples on a budget, although the rooms and baths are pretty small, even
by local standards. You do get a continental breakfast buffet provided on
each floor and evening wine gratis, and an attractive, homey, wood-
trimmed décor. Amiable receptionists serve double duty as concierge staff.
You won’t have air-conditioning or a tub in which to soak (most rooms
only have showers), but you can open the windows. Since joining the Joie
de Vivre Hospitality Group, the Andrews has upgraded its amenities and
now provides fresh flowers and in-room VCRs. Complimentary videos are
available from the reception desk. Consider spending the extra $20 per
night on a sunny Bay King room like #403. Avoid the dark tiny rooms
ending in 08. If street noise keeps you awake, request a room in the rear of
the building.

Square. % 800-926-3739 or 415-563-6877. Fax: 415-928-6919. www.andrews

stay discounts. AE, MC, V.
Argonaut Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Fisherman’s Wharf
In an enviable position on the western side of the Cannery, this perky bou-
tique hotel makes the innumerable chains around Fisherman’s Wharf
blush in comparison. Many of the heavily nautical-themed rooms have a
view of either Alcatraz or the Golden Gate Bridge, while the lesser-priced
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
96

interior rooms are touted as being quieter. Designers kept the 1907 brick
walls and wooden beams in place, where possible, adding plantation shut-
ters and using a palette of primary colors, which makes the place fun and
attractive to families and visitors who want quality lodgings in this admit-
tedly touristy area. Bedrooms are fairly spacious, but I was surprised 
at the ordinary-looking bathrooms with shallow tubs. Amenities are 
generous, including Aveda products, flat-panel TVs, DVD players, robes,
well-stocked minibars, and coffeemakers. The hotel’s restaurant, Blue
Mermaid, serves all day and is better than average for wharf food.

Campton Place
$$$$
Union Square
The soothing music piped into Campton Place’s classically decorated
lobby tells you right away that this is one genteel hotel. The atmosphere
is intimate, clubby, and reserved — you’ll want to use your company man-
ners as the valet unpacks your bags and shows off the many luxury ameni-
ties (a Bose sound system, for one). You can even bring your dog (if he’s
well-behaved). Although the standard guest rooms are smaller than you
may expect, they’re elegantly appointed and bathrooms are above aver-
age in size and comfort. The restaurant has been the recipient of many
awards and kudos — you may want to eat here even if you stay elsewhere.
The property was acquired by the Kor Hotel Group in late 2005, and stan-
dards remain high — Travel + Leisure included Campton Place in its 2006
list of the World’s Best Hotels.

Castle Inn
$–$$
Russian Hill
The Castle Inn is a good choice away from Union Square and the worst traf-
fic on Van Ness Avenue. Units at this clean, convenient, friendly motel have
been upgraded with maple furniture and new carpeting. They include in-
room VCRs, microwave ovens, small refrigerators, continental breakfast,
and even complimentary Wi-Fi. Guests are within walking distance of Polk
Street’s bars and restaurants and Fisherman’s Wharf. If you have a car to
park and want to avoid the exorbitant garage fees in Union Square and
around Fisherman’s Wharf, the Castle Inn is a smart pick but not so great
if you want to be closer to shops and theater.

Chancellor Hotel
$$
Union Square
The 137-room Chancellor has been owned and managed by the same
family since 1917 and offers a level of intimacy and value you just won’t
find in many other comparable inns. It’s right on the Powell Street cable-
car line, a handbag’s throw from Saks Fifth Avenue. The little bathrooms
are well stocked; the petite bedrooms, brightly decorated and comfortably
furnished; and you get a choice of pillows. For views, request front rooms
ending in 00 to 05, but aim for the higher floors — the garbage trucks start
their rounds at 5 a.m. and you don’t want to be near the street. Amenities
include ceiling fans (instead of air-conditioning), and coffee and cookies
at the front desk. The hotel has a restaurant open for breakfast and lunch;
it provides room service as well. Smoking is prohibited.

Clift
$$$$
Union Square
This is not your father’s Clift Hotel, and if you’re old enough to have memo-
ries of this landmark in its heyday, you’re in for a shock. An Ian
Schrager/Phillippe Starcke renovation in 2000 kicked the venerated Clift
into the 21st century, cleaning up the fusty interior (which badly needed
it) but stripping the hotel of its soul. Once known for fabulous service and
a classy, San Francisco aura, the new Clift employs helpful staff, but we can
argue the second point. The postmodern guestrooms lack warmth (and at
these prices deserve roomier baths) and, strangely enough, the focal points
of the white interiors are orange Lucite nightstands. You’ll find a few amus-
ing details in the lobby and bar, but the once-venerated Redwood Room is
a pale imitation, with sulky 20-somethings crowding the bar. Schrager
hotels are as much stage settings as places to sleep, which can be great fun
if you’re in the mood. Just be advised that style has usurped substance.

Commodore Hotel
$–$$
Union Square
Colorful but diminutive rooms and bathrooms (that could use some insu-
lation to deter noise) provide a lively backdrop to an older building that
shows some signs of wear. And this section of Sutter Street is close enough
to the Tenderloin to put me on alert for drug dealers and prostitutes. Still,
the location doesn’t discourage European tourists, who appreciate the
value and relaxed vibe. It’s 3 flat blocks from Union Square, so food and
entertainment are near at hand. Dennis Leary’s diner, Canteen (see review
in Chapter 10), is on one side of the lobby, and the fun, trendy Red Room
bar is on the other. The hotel has no air-conditioning. If you can get a good
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
100

deal here (under $100) and a room high up, you won’t be unhappy.
Otherwise, the Maxwell offers similar rates and is a step up in location and
décor.

Cow Hollow Motor Inn & Suites
$–$$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
These serviceable, nonsmoking motel rooms, unfortunately accessed by
elevators inside the parking garage, are clean and quiet, thanks to a dili-
gent staff and double-paned windows, respectively. The early Sears
Roebuck furnishings may not yet have made a style comeback, but you’ll
appreciate the in-room coffeemaker, hair dryer, and relatively spacious
baths. What makes the Cow Hollow Inn of particular interest, besides free
parking, free Wi-Fi, and low rates, is that it’s around the corner from the
best blocks of Chestnut Street, where the shopping and dining set a high
standard. Families can settle into one of six suites with kitchens and a sepa-
rate entrance right on Chestnut Street. Try to avoid rooms ending in 28,
which are next to noisy ice machines.

Embarcadero Hyatt Regency
$$$–$$$$
The Embarcadero
This enormous (you’re likely to get lost looking for your room) corporate
hotel at the foot of Market Street gets the thumbs up for its location (but for
the money, I’d stay at the Harbor Court or Vitale). Rooms are well equipped
and spacious (some also have beautiful views), plus there are two restau-
rants and a few shops in the atrium lobby, as well as an on-site fitness
center. This is probably your best bet for a hotel in the Embarcadero area
if you’re traveling with kids, who will love the indoor glass elevators. And
the hotel’s revolving Equinox Bar and Restaurant is irresistible to out-of-
towners, who line up for a ride to the view. If you won’t be needing the car,
self-park it in an Embarcadero Center lot for $29 per day.

The Fairmont Hotel
$$$$
Nob Hill
I’ve always had a soft spot for the regal Fairmont because it’s the first hotel
I remember staying in when I was a child. I’m still bowled over when I stroll
into the pillared and golden-colored lobby, which is usually humming with
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 101

businesspeople and older leisure travelers. Depending on the time of year,
you can get pretty decent rates (under $200) albeit in one of the “cozy”
queens located in the main building. These are as spacious as guest rooms
in the Tower building but don’t have views and are priced accordingly.
Tower rooms also have gorgeous marble baths with separate showers; all
bedrooms are filled with amenities. Make sure to have a drink in the
kitschy Tonga Room and marvel at the regularly scheduled storms. If you
have kids along, take advantage of the 5 to 7 p.m. happy hour featuring a
$7 all-you-can-eat Asian-inspired buffet — lots of young locals do. Should
you be interested in a real San Francisco treat, you’ll find it at the Fairmont,
but if it’s five-star treatment you’re after, head for the Ritz or the St. Regis.

Golden Gate Hotel

Union Square
If you’re flexible (or broke) enough to share a bathroom, this cheerful,
charming, 23-room Edwardian hotel with the feel of a B&B is a fabulous
deal, in a great location for cable-car lovers and walkers. Traveling with
older children? Take two of the small, pretty rooms, and buy yourself some
privacy. A complimentary continental breakfast and afternoon tea are
served, which adds to the feeling that the Golden Gate is run for love
rather than money. There’s a hotel cat and a dog, so if you’re allergic, this
unfortunately isn’t the spot for you. The hotel has no air-conditioning.

Handlery Union Square Hotel
$$$
Union Square
This favorite with tour packagers happens to be one of the better family
hotels downtown because it features a small, heated outdoor pool — a
rarity in San Francisco — as well as Nintendo, if you consider that a posi-

bedroom suites are also a good value, and refrigerators are provided on

Harbor Court Hotel
$$$
The Embarcadero
Located just steps from the bay and now under Kimpton Hotel manage-
ment, this is an especially romantic and sophisticated property, lower key
than the Hotel Vitale but equally as stylish. Rooms were all remodeled in
2005 and while they are pretty small, they’re so warmly decorated and
comfy I can imagine moving in for a long weekend, only stirring to watch
the Yoga channel on the flat screen TV. Reserve or upgrade to a queen or
king bay room, which features dramatic views of the water and Bay Bridge.
Guests have free access to the state-of-the-art Embarcadero YMCA pool
and health club right next door. A complimentary wine reception is held
each evening, and after a glass you can step into trendy Ozumo (see
review in Chapter 10), which is accessible from the lobby.

Hayes Valley Inn
$
Hayes Valley/Civic Center
In the not-so-distant past, I’d never have recommended lodging in this
neighborhood, but the upscale shopping and dining opportunities have
developed to such an extent that it overrides any other concerns (such as
panhandlers). Hotel choices are limited, but for budget travelers — or
anyone who would prefer to spend their dough on good meals or local
designers — this 28-room Edwardian B&B is a find. Yes, you’ll have to
share the very clean toilets and showers, but you can brush your teeth at
the sink/vanity in your sweetly decorated room. Expect to meet European
tourists over cereal, bagels, orange juice, and coffee (included in the
rates). Street-side rooms are larger, but noisier. The Van Ness Muni station
or F-Market streetcars are a few minutes walk east. The Asian Art Museum,
opera, ballet, and symphony are a few minutes walk north.

Hotel Adagio
$$
Union Square
In a previous incarnation, this 1929 Colonial Revival building housed the
tired Shannon Court Hotel, but a total face-lift in 2003 has turned Joan
Crawford into Cindy Crawford. The Adagio’s modern bedrooms and clean,
masculine lines won’t appeal to frill-seekers, but the hotel is closer in spirit
to the W and the Clift (which is just down the block) — albeit more com-
petitively priced. Sleek young things already jostle for space in the bar and
a table in the mucho caldo Cortez restaurant (see Chapter 10). Because
this is an older building, air-conditioning consists of ceiling fans and win-
dows that open. A nicely fitted fitness center, high-speed and wireless
Internet access, high-end bath products, complimentary afternoon tea,
Chapter 9: Checking In at San Francisco’s Best Hotels 103

and Executive-level guest rooms that come with views and a continental
breakfast bring the hotel squarely into the here and now.

Hotel Bijou
$–$$
Union Square
Film buffs will get a kick out of this cinema-themed inn. In the evening, it
shows San Francisco–based videos in a ten-seat screening room off the
lobby, and there’s even a candy counter. Freshly decorated rooms and
baths (some with shower only) are tight and amenities few, but the staff is
professional and service oriented. Continental breakfast is included in the
rates. Be warned: This hotel shares the block with a sleazy strip club; if
you think that may bother you, book elsewhere.

Hotel Bohème
$$–$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
Set in the heart of North Beach, this charming, intimate hotel echoes the
old Bohemian feel of the area. Fifteen small but romantic, beautiful (and
recently refreshed) rooms are vividly painted and arrayed with iron beds
and generous in-room amenities. Teensy bathrooms have showers only,
no tubs. The accommodating staff is happy to assist with tours, rental
cars, and restaurant reservations; you’ll have to schlep your own luggage
up the narrow stairs, though. The hotel has no air-conditioning, but the
windows open. You’re likely to find a younger, less conservative crowd
staying here than at the Washington Square Inn, another small hotel in this
neighborhood and price range.

Hotel Del Sol
$$
Marina/Cow Hollow
Paint, mosaic tiles, and imagination can do a lot to reinvent a motel, and
there’s no better example than the Del Sol. You’ll think you’re in Southern
California (after the fog lifts), but it’s lots better here, because you can
walk around the neighborhood without getting startled looks from drivers.
The heated pool and a hammock suspended between palm trees complete
the hallucination. Multicolored, fun, reasonably sized guest rooms and
suites could have stepped out of a ’90s Habitat catalog, and one is 
configured especially for families, with games and bunk beds. The best
part: Parking is free and you’re not on busy Lombard Street.

Hotel Griffon
$$$
The Embarcadero
Of the Embarcadero hotels, the Griffon has decent concierge services, and
six end rooms plus three suites that offer unsurpassed bay views. Sadly,
the small rooms don’t sing style — vintage white-brick walls and a lack of
artwork equal a drab appearance. In some, sink/vanity combos sit just a
few feet from the bed — an arrangement I find unsettling. Despite this, the
hotel still has more personality than the Embarcadero Hyatt, and I like the
location — very close to the water. A well-equipped YMCA (free for guests)
is next door, and a good restaurant is off the lobby. Continental breakfast
is included in the rates. This is a nonsmoking hotel.

SoMa
This well-designed and well-maintained Italian-themed boutique hotel isn’t
flashy or hip, but you won’t find a better value in SoMa. Amenities include
a spacious on-site fitness room, a bar, and more floor space in your room
than you’ll find in other hotels in this price range. The multistory San
Francisco Shopping Centre is a few feet away, and Yerba Buena Gardens is
just around the corner, so you won’t lack for things to do. Personally, I
prefer the intimacy of this hotel to The Argent (also in this neighborhood
and price range), but if you’re looking for a room with a view, The Argent
is a better bet.

Union Square
You’ll wish you’d brought your fox-tail-trimmed scarf and vintage Vuitton
steamer trunk when you sashay into the Art Deco–inspired Monaco. The
medium-sized rooms are lushly decorated with patterned wallpaper, floral
prints, and canopied beds. All the amenities — like room service and a spa
and fitness center — are available, plus it’s a pet-friendly hotel. The aptly
named Grand Cafe restaurant (reviewed in Chapter 10) is next door. And
if you’re feeling lonely, they’ll deliver a bowl of goldfish to your room. If
you’re carting along the children, tell the desk staff — they provide milk
and cookies for munchkins.

Hotel Palomar
$$$$
SoMa
This newish, extremely grown-up hotel sits above a busy corner close to
Union Square and the attractions South of Market. The hotel was designed
for sophisticated business and leisure travelers; you can expect a high-
quality experience (at high-quality prices) in luxuriously sedate sur-
roundings. The ample guest rooms are fitted for work and play with
multiline phones, fax machines, CD players, spa tubs, and Aveda products.
There’s room service, a fitness center, and The Fifth Floor, one of the more
glamorous restaurants in town. Palomar guests, of course, don’t have to
wait four weeks for a table. Hotel Palomar compares in price to its neigh-
bor, the W. So what’s the difference between the two hotels? The Palomar
is what the W will be when it’s all grown up. But the W is convinced it’s
having more fun.

Dorothy Parker fans will appreciate this 94-room delight, which, despite

mentary wine. The rooms are all smartly designed and decorated; sizes
vary from smallish doubles to executive kings with more ample space.

on a playful style but also provides plenty of amenities, including Nintendo
and happy hour with free wine and beer. To pay homage to the ab gods,
there’s a small on-site fitness room. The fabulous location, across from
Chinatown’s Dragon Gate, makes standing outside on the sidewalk an

Hotel Vitale

The Embarcadero
If you consider yourself urbane yet earthy, practical yet appreciative of
the better things in life, the Hotel Vitale has a room with your name on it.
Expensive but not over-the-top extravagant, this new property claims the
most coveted patch of earth in town — right across the boulevard from
the Ferry Building. Spoiled by delicious views, an F-Market streetcar stop
behind the building, and within walking distance to well-regarded restau-
rants, the hotel is well situated. Inside, it is a delight as well. You’ll notice
first how good the place smells (small vials with dried lavender grace the
hallways), and attention to detail continues inside the guestrooms. Deluxe
waterfront sanctuaries feature a sexy walk-in shower rather than skimpy
bathtub/shower combos in the still-spacious, but viewless interior rooms.
A spa with two outdoor soaking tubs, and a daily yoga class will provide
any centering one requires. It’s contemporary, chic, and full of vitality.

The Huntington Hotel
$$$$
Nob Hill
The Boston Brahmin in you will adore this refined, quiet oasis with its
subtle elegance, impeccable service, and a gorgeous spa. The 1924 build-
ing originally housed apartments, so guest rooms and baths are larger than
average; most are labeled suites. Rooms above the eighth floor have views;
the ones below are extra spacious, and by the end of 2007 every guest
room will have been updated. Children are welcome in the hotel (but not
in the spa), and manicured Huntington Park, complete with a playground,
is across the street. The staff, concierge included, will anticipate your
every need. If you can afford to lay down the cash for a room here, you
could also choose to stay at the Fairmont or Ritz-Carlton, the Huntington’s
Nob Hill neighbors, but I love the old-fashioned San Franciscan feel of the
Huntington. If you want the total San Francisco experience, this is it. You’ll
certainly get pampered here, but if you’re looking for something more
glamorous, go with the Ritz.

This small, very discreet hotel is just the ticket if you desire a bit of luxury
but don’t care to make a scene. You get those little extras — continental
breakfast, newspapers, bathrobes, wine and cheese in the early evening,
nice linens, 24-hour concierge, health-club access — combined with very
reasonable rates that make it a pleasure to part with some, but not too
much, of your money. Tasteful rooms range from small to very large, and
all have benefited from last year’s tidying with new furniture, fabrics, and
wallpaper. The hotel has no air-conditioning and it’s non-smoking.

The Marina/Cow Hollow
Because this was originally an apartment building, 15 of the rentals in 
this funky, flower-bedecked, courtyard-style budget motel feature fully
equipped kitchens. A granddaughter of the original owner redecorated the
medium-sized studios with Italian bathroom tiles, Mission-style furniture,
and pretty quilts, making this one of the few places on Lombard Street with
even a hint of charm. Families can reserve two connecting rooms with a
shared bath. Surprisingly, considering the location, rooms off the street
are remarkably quiet. The front desk clerk will arrange tours or rental cars
at your request. It is the definition of cheap and cheerful.

The Maxwell

Union Square
If you’re a serious shopper, you’ll like this attractive, deservedly popular
hotel’s supportive resources, such as its Shopologist newsletter. The guest
rooms, which are either spacious and Art Deco chic or dark and small
depending on your pocketbook or the kindness of the desk clerk, lie off an
intimate, theatrical lobby. (The difference in price between a deluxe king
and an executive queen or king may be as little as $10, so I suggest you
pony up and buy yourself more space.) During the last remodel, designers
thoughtfully didn’t alter the original bathroom tile or the deep bathtubs.
Max’s on the Square provides room service. Be sure to check prices on
their junior suites, especially off season. They can be quite a good deal.

With easy access to the Powell Street BART station, Union Square, and the
greatly expanded shopping opportunities on Market and 5th streets (a new
Bloomingdale’s anchoring a new Westfield mall), the Colonial-themed and
quite delightful Monticello is sitting pretty. You’ll find spacious rooms with
Chippendale reproductions (the designer, not the dancers), a lending library,
weekly book signings, complimentary wine in the evening, and lots of value-
minded packages to lure you away from more chic lodgings. The hotel restau-
rant is Puccini and Panetti, and it caters to families, unlike most Union Square
eateries. The king/king rooms are another good choice for child-toting trav-
elers. The noise-sensitive should request rooms facing the inside courtyard.
As at all Kimpton hotels, your pets are invited to join the fun.

The Orchard Hotel

Opened in 2001, the sedate 105-room Orchard was built from scratch and
boasts some of the largest bedrooms and most luxurious baths in the
neighborhood. It may have less va-va-voom than older, true boutique
hotels such as Hotel Rex or the Maxwell (yet oceans more than your
Hiltons or Sheratons), but for sheer comfort, this is probably your best
bet in this price range around Union Square. The conservatively decorated
guest rooms will gratify business as well as vacation travelers and include
CD/DVD players, high-speed Internet access, and top amenities, including
room service, provided by the well-mannered and charming staff. Cable
cars stop just around the corner. A sister hotel, The Orchard Garden,
hadn’t yet opened before this book went to press, but put it on your list.
If it’s managed as well as the Orchard, it’s bound to be a terrific place. Plus,

showerheads, and 400-thread-count sheets, in case you were counting),
you can swim in the indoor pool, exercise in the fitness center, shop for

and comfort, from the handsome lobby bar to the lose-yourself-in-luxe 
bedrooms with deep soaking tubs, huge plasma screen TVs, and digitized
remote control so one needn’t rustle the high-thread-count sheets to close
the window coverings or signal the butler. The fitness center and spa are
the best in town. I also like the fact that each floor holds just 18 rooms.
Views begin from the eighth floor. The hotel’s fine-dining room, Ame (see

but adorable (they look like something your grandmother may have done

such a bargain close to the bay. The penthouse, with a private bath, is
prized for its views. However, ambience from the low-income housing proj-
ect on the next block may not be the sort you crave. Laundry facilities are
available, and the Fior d’Italia (the country’s oldest Italian restaurant) has
moved in downstairs. The rooms have no air-conditioning, televisions, or

The Serrano Hotel

A stellar example of what a boutique hotel should be, the Serrano is beau-

as well as business travelers, who don’t mind sacrificing square footage
when they’re receiving great value for money. The small rooms are full of
color and amenities, and double-paned windows effectively work to reduce
street noise. Guest rooms on upper floors even have city views. The
Spanish Revival lobby is a gem — seating groups are arranged under the
handsome beamed ceiling, and it’s a convivial place in the early evening
when complimentary wine is served and a tarot-card reader drops by to
entertain. The only drawback, and it’s minor, is the proximity to Ellis
Street, which can seem dicey at times. In fact, it’s just a 3-block walk to
Union Square and 2 blocks to the Powell Street cable-car turnaround, so
don’t let this deter you. Ponzu, the hotel’s restaurant, is excellent and a
popular pre-theater spot.

Tuscan Inn
$$–$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
The pet-friendly Best Western Tuscan is a welcome change compared to
the rest of the chain hotels on Fisherman’s Wharf. Personality doesn’t
abound, but the just-remodeled rooms are fairly large by local standards,
and kids like the location. The concierge is enthusiastic and friendly, and
all the amenities you expect are available with the added plus of an early-
evening wine reception where you can meet your neighbors. In warm
weather, enjoy dining al fresco at the hotel restaurant. The new Argonaut,
the Tuscan’s only rival on the wharf in this comfort zone, outdoes this
property in style, but I’ll bet the rates here will be better.
See map p. 84. 425 North Point, between Mason and Taylor streets. % 800-648-4626
or 415-561-1100. Fax: 415-561-1199. www.tuscaninn.com. Parking: $35. Rack rates:
$159–$239. Ask about AAA, corporate, and senior discounts. AE, CB, DC, DISC, 
MC, V.
Union Street Inn
$$–$$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
This B&B has six richly appointed rooms and a choice location on a prime
shopping street. If you want a bit less urban color, this is a fantastic retreat.
The charming managers serve as concierge and cook a full breakfast as
part of the package. Guest rooms are large, but beware of the steep stairs
to the front door, which make this an impractical choice for anyone who
has difficulty walking.
See map p. 84. 2229 Union St., between Fillmore and Steiner streets. % 415-346-
0424. Fax: 415-922-8046. www.unionstreetinn.com. Parking: $15 at a lot 11⁄2
blocks away. Rack rates: $179–$289. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Washington Square Inn
$$–$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
The European atmosphere in North Beach makes this little hotel a won-
derful choice, and if you plan to walk the neighborhoods, you won’t find a
better location. The rooms in the lower price bracket are small, but ameni-
ties such as fresh flowers, continental breakfast, afternoon tea, and
evening wine and hors d’oeuvres in the antiques-filled lobby make them a
terrific deal. Recent upgrades include flat screen televisions and free Wi-
Fi. The staff will help you with your bags, but otherwise, the front-desk
service is so-so. The hotel is non-smoking and there is a two-night mini-
mum on weekends.

Park. % 800-388-0220 or 415-981-4220. Fax: 415-397-7242. www.wsisf.com.

Westin St. Francis
$$–$$$$
Union Square
It’s all about location. A prime corner across from Union Square and a 
glittering, bustling lobby are what give the historic St. Francis its air of
excitement and glamour. But underneath all this is a really big, impersonal
hotel — albeit one with 24-hour room service, concierges, shops, dining
opportunities, and Westin’s branded “Heavenly” beds. In any case, stick
to the original (main) building. Its moderate-sized standard doubles are
furnished with gorgeous reproductions and romantic antique chandeliers,
although bathrooms are on the small side. Ask for a view or a corner room
to get some natural light, and avoid rooms by the ever-busy elevators.
Deluxe and Grandview rooms are the best in the house, while the standard
queens are just large enough for a single traveler. My suggestion is to stay
at the Orchard Hotel instead and drop by the St. Francis to ride in the glass
elevator and have a look around. The good news is the hotel was sold in
2006 and a renovation is rumored.

397-7000. Fax: 415-774-0124. www.westin.com. Parking: $40 with a $9 surcharge
for oversized vehicles. Rack rates: $129–$569. AE, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
White Swan Inn
$$$
Union Square
The 26 guest rooms in this English-style B&B are designed to be lingered
in. You’ll want to take advantage of the four-poster beds and fireplaces in
the spacious rooms. A continental breakfast buffet is included in the rates,
as is afternoon tea and evening wine and hors d’oeuvres served down-
stairs in the parlor. You’ll think you’re visiting a well-to-do British aunt.
Back rooms are sunnier; the queen rooms have showers only. Just as in
the White Swan’s neighboring inn, Petite Auberge, advance reservations
are imperative here and smoking is not allowed.

rates: $139–$249. AE, DC, MC, V.
W San Francisco
$$$–$$$$
SoMa
Ultramodern and light on the froufrou, W precisely aims its glossy high
style and service at hip business travelers. Of course, they generally head
for the airport on Fridays, leaving the vaguely masculine, moderate-sized
rooms available to the rest of us. Marvel at the handsome chrome-and-
frosted-glass bathroom, the deluxe amenities, the CD player, and the data-
ports. A lap pool, fitness room, restaurant, cafe, bar, room service, and
well-trained staff add heft to an already solid package. If you can snag a
corner room, do — there’s more space.

Runner-Up Hotels
Having trouble finding a bed? If the hotels listed earlier in this chapter
are filled up, try booking in one of the following accommodations. They
may have saved you some room.
The Argent Hotel
$$$–$$$$
SoMa
This is a sizable, run-of-the-mill convention hotel with
larger-than-average rooms and many extras — irons, hair dryers, quality
bath products, and so on. What earns it a place in this chapter, besides its
stellar location near Yerba Buena Gardens and the Museum of Modern Art,
are the nearly floor-to-ceiling windows providing great views from rooms
and suites above the 14th floor. A restaurant, fitness center, sauna, and
pretty garden also help elevate The Argent beyond the ordinary, but look
for a deal on Priceline. See map p. 98. 50 Third St., near Market Street. % 877-
222-6699 or 415-974-6400. Fax: 415-543-8268. www.argenthotel.com. Parking: $38.
Rack rates: $265–$449. Check Web site for deals. AE, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
The Cartwright Hotel
$–$$$
Union Square
Standard guest rooms in this low-key hotel are on
the small side (reserve a deluxe king if you’re claustrophobic), but the two-
bedroom suites will suit a family. All the guest rooms have been recently
redone. Along with high-end in-room amenities, free Wi-Fi, and an after-
noon wine reception, the hotel provides a substantial continental break-
fast. European in feel, the Cartwright is well located for Union Square and
Chinatown, well managed, and you’ll find friendly, helpful staff. See map 
p. 98. 524 Sutter St., near Powell Street. % 800-919-9779 or 415-421-2865. Fax: 415-

double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Galleria Park Hotel
$$$
Union Square
This is a terrific, small hotel in a clever location
close to Chinatown, the Financial District, and Union Square. Unlike most
downtown properties, this one has on-site parking that is handy for trav-
elers who need quick access to their automobiles. The hotel’s experienced
concierge is a gold mine of information and assistance. There’s a workout
room on-site and a rooftop jogging track/garden. As this book went to
press, a complete room renovation was planned for late 2006. See map 
p. 98. 191 Sutter St., at Kearny Street. % 800-792-9639 or 415-781-3060. Fax: 415-433-

Kensington Park Hotel
$–$$
Union Square
This 88-room property is beginning to look a 
little frayed, although the larger-than-average rooms are slowly being

114

renovated. The bathrooms are already among the handsomest in the area.
The 11th floor is now an executive floor (ask for a Royal Court room) with
upgraded linens, robes, and continental breakfast. Workout facilities are
available, and the staff is delightful. The hotel has no air-conditioning. See
map p. 98. 450 Post St., between Mason and Powell streets. % 800-553-1900 or 415-

Rack rates: $149–$200. AE, CB, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
King George Hotel
$–$$
Union Square
Check the Web site for deals that could be as low
as $99 including parking. The guest rooms are miniscule, as are the baths,
but the entire hotel was remodeled in 2002 and they did a good job. The
bar is exceedingly low-key and pleasant — a proper English tea is served
on weekends that is popular enough to require reservations. The hotel is
in the process of updating its rooms. See map p. 98. 334 Mason St., at Geary
Street. % 415-781-5050. Fax: 415-391-6976. www.kinggeorge.com. Self-parking:

The Warwick Regis Hotel
$$–$$$$
Union Square
This is the closest you can get to a French
chateau downtown. If circa–Louis XVI armoires, brocade fabrics, crown-
canopied beds, and marble-tiled bathrooms get your heart racing, you’re
going to adore this hotel. Twice-daily housekeeping, fresh flowers, great
amenities, a restaurant/bar, and 24-hour room service are wrapped up in
an intimate atmosphere. See map p. 98. 490 Geary St., at Taylor Street. % 800-827-

Dining and Snacking 
in San Francisco
In This Chapter
 Assessing the latest dining trends
 Savoring the local flavor
 Reserving your table
 Finding the best places for a leisurely meal or snack
W
hether you’re a genuine gourmet or a fledgling foodie, San
Francisco has more culinary options than you can shake a nice
bunch of organic basil leaves at. But no matter where you rank yourself
on the scale of serious eating, there’s no excuse to waste a meal in this
city. Fast-food counters, chain restaurants, marketing enterprises mas-
querading as dining establishments — you’ll find them here, but do
yourself a favor and pass ’em by. Instead, take advantage of the fresh,
local ingredients and skilled chefs that keep San Francisco in the culi-
nary spotlight, and I guarantee you’ll dine to your heart’s content.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Restaurants debut in this town with great hoopla, but what’s hot today
may be out of business by the time you turn this page. At the moment,
the newest trend is sharing. I don’t mean spilling your life story — I mean
sharing plates of food with your tablemates. Although this isn’t news in
your average Chinese restaurant, it is in other eateries, so if you sup at
Rose Pistola or Lulu, for example, be advised that those hefty portions
really are meant for the entire table. On the other end of the spectrum,
small plates, an offshoot of the Spanish penchant for tapas, are all the
rage, and they, too, are meant to be shared. This can get nasty if three
plump scallops arrive and you’re part of a party of four, so try to dine
with at least one vegetarian or be prepared to cover the tabletop with a
lot of little dishes.

Finding the trendiest tables
San Francisco has no lack of sizzling white-tablecloth restaurants.
Getting last-minute reservations at Jardinière (% 415-861-5555), or 
at two of the city’s newer sophisticated purveyors of fine dining, Ame
(% 415-284-4040) and Quince (% 415-775-8500; see listings later in
this chapter), is tough. Call ahead — way, way ahead — if you have your
heart set on supping at any of these bastions of chic. Wrangling a table
at the always-sublime Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton (% 415-773-
6168) is equally challenging with Ron Siegel (the kitchen god who
bested Japanese television phenom “Iron Chef”) at the helm. And
despite the increase to 200 seats with the move to the Ferry Building, 
it’s a three-week wait for dinner at Slanted Door (% 415-861-8032; 
see listing later in this chapter). You might try for lunch instead. For
anyone traveling up to Yountville in order to eat at The French Laundry
(% 707-944-2380), one of the most coveted reservations in the country,
bookings are accepted two months to the day in advance. OpenTable.
com (see “Making reservations,” later in this chapter) has exactly two
tables available online with a separate page devoted to the reasons why
you’re going to get frustrated getting your hands on one. Determined
eaters who can’t wait to spend $210 on a prix fixe (okay, it’s an amazing
experience) should mark their calendars and exercise their dialing fin-
gers, while giving OpenTable.com a try as well.
Cooking up San Francisco cuisine
When it comes to cuisine, international influences are the inspiration for
most Bay City menus. This is not odd considering the ethnic makeup of
the city’s population, but it may throw you for a loop when your menu
runs the gamut from East to West with a little Southern comfort thrown
in for good measure. Those restaurants serving tapas are the most keen
to take advantage of various culinary styles, and it’s a clever way for a
young chef to show his or her stuff. These small plates are also a pleas-
ing way to order a meal. You don’t have to choose between dishes that
sound equally appealing, because the prices are low enough, and the
portions modest enough, to sample them all.
California cuisine, of course, will always have a presence here, although
it’s being usurped by Modern American or New American cuisine.
California cuisine features fresh, seasonal ingredients prepared in simple
and light ways. New American cuisine, on the other hand, also uses sea-
sonal ingredients, but the preparations are influenced by whatever for-
eign cuisines interest the chef. Although the subtleties may be lost on
you if you don’t deconstruct your meals, I mention this because many
new restaurants describe their cooking in these terms.
Another welcome dining trend has to do with accommodating those who
are organizationally challenged. Many excellent restaurants in town,
including Boulevard and Gary Danko (see listings later in this chapter),
accommodate walk-ins with counter seats or service in their bar areas.
This is your best chance to eat at these top spots if you don’t have 
reservations.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 121

Making reservations
If you really want to experience some of the high-profile restaurants
while you’re in town, make sure you book a table before you get here.
It’s not that the hostess takes pleasure in turning you away on a Friday
night at 8 p.m. — but did you notice all the other people drinking in the
bar who also thought they could amble in and get a table?
Besides picking up the phone, you can contact a vast number of restau-
rants through the OpenTable Web site (www.opentable.com). I’ve used
this free Internet site many times, always with excellent results. You may
also put your hotel concierge to work by requesting that he assist you
with dinner reservations. If you’re really desperate, you can show a little
chutzpah like my old friend Josephine, who has been known to march up
to the host, look him in the eye, and announce she has reservations,
even when that’s not entirely accurate. The caveat here is to make sure
your dining partners don’t buckle under pressure.
Exploring the dining zones
Cafes and restaurants often congregate on certain blocks, making it easy
to stroll down the street until an enticing odor or empty table calls out
to you. One of my absolute favorite dining destinations is Belden Place
in the Financial District, a 1-block alley closed to traffic off Bush and Pine
streets between Kearny and Montgomery. Weekdays, in good weather,
the outdoor tables are coveted lunch spots. Two standouts on multicul-
tural Belden are Plouf (% 415-986-6491), a delightful French restaurant
specializing in fish and shellfish, and B-44 (% 415-986-6287; see listing
later in this chapter), a Spanish charmer specializing in paella and
Catalan dishes. North Beach is awash in Italian cafes, Italian restaurants
of all persuasions, and some inexpensive little eateries. The family-style
La Felce, 1570 Stockton St., at Union (% 415-392-8321); and Capps
Corner, 1600 Powell, at Green (% 415-989-2589), are among the last of
the breed, where complete meals are no understatement. You order a
bottle of Chianti and watch as your table fills with antipasti, then a
tureen of minestrone, followed by huge platters of spaghetti, chicken
cacciatore, and spumoni for dessert.
The Mission District gourmet ghetto continues to explode, especially
around Valencia and 16th streets, where you’ll find the popular creperie
Ti Couz, 3108 16th St. (% 415-252-7373), and Bar Tartine, 561 Valencia
St. (% 415-487-1600), the new Cal/Med brasserie opened by the brilliant
team from Tartine Bakery at 18th and Guerrero streets (% 415-487-
2600). Mexican-food lovers should try Pancho Villa, 3071 16th St. at
Valencia (% 415-864-8840), which draws a crowd with its inexpensive
and fresh burritos, tacos, and specialty platters, or Taqueria Cancun,
2288 Mission St. between 18th and 19th (% 415-252-9560), which stays
open until 2 a.m. on weekends. The mood in this neighborhood is casual
and urban; it’s populated by students, artists, a large Hispanic commu-
nity, and a fair number of street people. Parking requires patience and
luck, but there’s a BART stop at 16th and Mission — a rather dicey sta-
tion, so you may want to take a cab on the way home.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 125

You can take the N-Judah streetcar to Irving Street and Ninth Avenue
near Golden Gate Park to find another great couple of blocks of moder-
ately priced and high-quality restaurants. Chow, 215 Church St. (% 415-
552-2469; see listing later in this chapter), has a location here, and you
can’t go wrong at P.J.’s Oyster Bed, 737 Irving St. at Ninth (% 415-566-
7775). Some good Japanese and Thai restaurants are also nearby, includ-
ing Ebisu, 1283 9th Ave. (% 415-566-1770).
Discovering off-the-beaten-track restaurants
Restaurants are mining new territory as well, as evidenced by the
dozens of places opening in neighborhoods most visitors would have
shunned once upon a time. The blocks around Dolores, Valencia, and
Guerrero streets in the Mission District from 16th to 23rd streets are
just one example. Storefronts and former corner markets have become
the domain of chefs hoping to create the next big thing food-wise.
Delfina, 3621 18th St. at Guerrero (% 415-552-4055; see listing later in
this chapter), is one of the area’s pioneers, but if you can’t wrangle a
table there, line up at Dosa, 995 Valencia St. near 21st Street (% 415-642-
3672), for South Indian cuisine, Limon, 524 Valencia St. near 16th 
(% 415-252-0918), a Peruvian restaurant so good it had to move to
larger digs in 2004, or The Last Supper Club, 1199 Valencia St. at 23rd
Street (% 415-695-1199), an Italian joint designed to make you nostalgic
for your Sicilian grandmother, whether you had one or not.
A section of Potrero Hill is also drawing lots of interest from profes-
sional eaters and cooks. Mosey around 18th Street between Missouri
and Connecticut streets where the savvy folks behind Plouf have opened
a trio of little places that keep the neighbors fat and happy. Chez
Maman, 1453 18th St. (% 415-824-7166), is open daily for crepes, while
Chez Papa, 1401 18th St. (% 415-255-0387), serves rustic French food
that’s delicious and amazingly inexpensive. Their Moroccan/Spanish
entry, Baraka, 288 Connecticut St. (% 415-255-0387), offers around 25
small plates in a romantic, candlelit room. You’ll need to take a cab or
drive to Potrero Hill.
Sampling San Francisco’s ethnic eats
Certain neighborhoods in San Francisco are hubs for particular regional
cuisines, as is the case in other big cities. You can find several ethnic
enclaves, with Chinatown the most obvious example. Head to North
Beach, thick with trattorie and bakeries, for authentic Italian. Not to be
outdone, the Mission District serves up terrific, inexpensive taquerias,
and you can see Central American cafes alongside new gourmet restau-
rants. The tasty, authentic fare is worth the trip.
Over in the Richmond District (see Chapter 8), you’ll notice a clutch 
of Russian bakeries, delicatessens, and restaurants, most notably
Katia’s, A Russian Tea Room, 600 Fifth Ave., at Balboa Street (% 415-
668-9292), open Wednesday through Friday for lunch and Wednesday
through Sunday for dinner. You can also find many more Asian and

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 127

Chinese eateries in the Richmond District. Another local Asian favorite is
the Mayflower, 6255 Geary Blvd., near 27th Avenue (% 415-387-8338),
open daily for excellent dim sum, lunch, and dinner. Call for evening
reservations.
Japantown is bargain-town when it comes to dining. Inside the Japan
Center on Post Street (at Webster Street) are a number of noodle houses
and sushi bars with more across the way. Mifune, 1737 Post St., Suite
375 (% 415-922-0337), upstairs in the Japan Center, is a perennial
favorite for big bowls of udon noodles in broth with slices of beef or
chicken and vegetables. It’s open until 9:30 p.m. Sunday to Thursday,
and 10 p.m. Friday to Saturday. Isuzu, 1581 Webster St. (% 415-922-
2290), is a great spot for sushi or tempura.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Do not head to the nearest fast-food counter, even if your travel budget
doesn’t allow for a $100 dinner for two every night. You can limit the
stress on your credit card, and save your waistline, if you share an appe-
tizer and dessert, or order beer instead of wine, or better yet, bring a
favorite bottle of vino (you’ll have to pay a corkage charge) or skip the
alcohol entirely. (The markup on wine is usually outrageous!) If you’ve
read all about a certain restaurant you’re dying to try that’s way too
expensive, have lunch there instead of dinner, if it’s open; you’ll get the
same quality of food, but for less money. Or you can eat brunch or have
an inexpensive picnic lunch and contribute your savings toward a really
nice dinner. See the following paragraph for places to get a quick but
delicious meal or snack.
The best choice for inexpensive, flavorful dishes is to try out one of the
city’s many ethnic restaurants. Taxi to the Tenderloin for Vietnamese
and Indian/Pakistani; the Mission District for cheap Mexican, Salvadoran,
and Cambodian food; to Geary and Clement streets in the Richmond
District for Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai; and to Japantown for tem-
pura and noodles. Your wallet will thank you and your taste buds will
still be satisfied.
So, what are you in the mood for? Chinese? California-Mediterranean?
Catalan tapas? Pho? There’s no reason to go hungry seeking the right
restaurant. Due to space considerations, the recommendations in this
chapter only scratch the surface of my favorite places. What you have
here is a representative cross-section of the best the city has to offer, in
a variety of price ranges and neighborhoods. And unless the kitchen is
having an off night, there’s not a lemon in the bunch.
Restaurants that I’ve designated with the Kid Friendly icon have items
on the menu that most kids like, and they’ll treat your children with
respect. If things like crayons at the tables and booster seats are 
important to your little ones, call the restaurants directly for more 
information.

The dollar signs attached to the restaurant recommendations in this chap-
ter give you an idea of how much you’ll have to shell out for dinner for one
person, including appetizer, main course, dessert, one drink, tax, and tip.
If a place is marked with $, a meal there will run $25 or less. At $$ places,
expect to spend between $26 and $50. Restaurants with $$$ will cost
from $51 to $80. Feel like going for broke? You’ll sup like royalty and then
fork over lots more than $80 at places with $$$$. To locate a restaurant
based on its cost, location, or cuisine, see the indexes at the end of this
chapter.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 129
Experiencing dinner as theater
Foreign Cinema in the Mission District (% 415-648-7600; see listing later in this chap-
ter) screens films on a wall in their patio, which is handy if you don’t have much to say
to your date. But for live entertainment to accompany your meal, stay tuned.
San Francisco has always had its fair share of fair maidens, many of whom shave
twice daily, and there is no better or safer place to gawk at “gender illusionists” than
at AsiaSF, 201 Ninth St., at Howard (% 415-255-2742), a SoMa nightclub/restaurant.
The “waitresses” do double duty, taking your order for small plates of fusion dishes
(such as duck quesadillas) and then lip-synching to your favorite tunes while strutting
down the vinyl bar. You’d think that the gimmick would bury the food, but in fact, the
place manages to do a fine job in every area. There’s even a disco in the basement,
so you can shake your thang afterward, should you be so inclined.
Down at Pier 29 on the Embarcadero, look for a stylized 1926 Spiegelent (a circular,
tented pavilion), the home of Teatro ZinZanni (% 415-438-2668; www.teatrozin
zanni.org). Tickets are $110 to $135, and shows are Wednesday through Sunday.
This is an immensely hilarious dinner show with a twist: The audience is part of the pro-
ceedings. Don’t worry — you won’t be asked to get up and recite. Along with an
acceptable, if not stellar, five-course meal (it reminds me of hotel wedding suppers),
diners are regaled by a talented group of performers, who combine cabaret, opera,
acrobatics, comedy, and improv in most unusual ways. The cast changes periodically,
and strangely enough, Joan Baez has appeared in the show off and on, so it’s worth
investigating who’s in the lineup when you come to town. This isn’t a cheap date, 
but it’s something to consider if you’re celebrating or looking for an evening out of the
ordinary.
And for something completely different, slip into supperclub, 657 Harrison St. between
2nd and 3rd streets (% 415-348-0900; www.supperclub.com), an offshoot of the
Amsterdam original. Be prepared to spend your entire evening here, lounging barefoot
against the pillows that surround your bed/seating area, drinking, eating, watching,
listening, participating, and giving yourself over to whatever the experience offers as
every night it changes somewhat. Expect performance art, wandering masseuses,
costumes, drag queens, DJs, and who knows what else. A set five-course meal of
varying consistency is served for $60 on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
and for $70 on Friday and Saturday. Secure reservations at least one month in advance.

Civic Center/Hayes Valley
FRENCH/BRASSERIE
I recommend this warm-hearted restaurant for a cozy dinner with your
beloved (or even just a really good friend) — the restaurant is close
enough to Union Square that if you don’t find quite what you want near
your hotel, it’s just a short cab ride away. You can’t miss with a selection
from the oyster bar or a crisp Caesar salad to start. Depending on the day,
the chef may be cooking like a French grandmère, with coq au vin or a
confit of duck, house-made sausage, and pork cassoulet ready to satisfy
your hunger pangs. A hot spot for preconcert dining, you may want to
book a table after the curtain, in order to savor the romantic room and
seasonal menu. Weekend brunch is busy, too, but you can walk in for lunch
if you’re shopping in the neighborhood.

Dining and dancing
The Top of the Mark in the Mark Hopkins InterContinental Hotel, 1 Nob Hill, at Mason
and California streets (% 415-616-6916), has it all — views, music, dancing, and a
convivial crowd of suits. The hotel serves a $59 prix-fixe dinner on Friday and Saturday
nights; with 7:30 p.m. reservations (the band starts at 9 p.m.), a night on the town is a
done deal. Harry Denton’s Starlight Room, in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel on Union
Square, 450 Powell St. (% 415-395-8595), attracts tons of hotel guests and locals who
appreciate the Starlight Orchestra, the drop-dead views, and the adult prom-night
atmosphere. It’s a glorious room for drinking expensive glasses of whatever, dancing,
and having a little bite. Reservations on the weekend are advised. A more youthful and
hip group congregates at Cafe du Nord, housed below the Swedish American Hall,
2170 Market St., at Sanchez (%415-861-5016;www.cafedunord.com). The basement-
level club serves dinner (sandwiches, salad, chicken, and steak), but the draw is the
live music. Check the Web site to see which shows are “all ages” (usually offered
upstairs), if you have teens along for the ride. Cafe du Nord is open seven days a week,
good to know on a Monday when you want something fun to do and there doesn’t
seem to be anywhere to go at night.

Regis Hotel. The pairing is another perfect match. There’s no need now to
speed to the Napa Valley for Sone’s signature sake-marinated, broiled black
cod and shrimp dumplings in shiso broth — a true blessing considering
the price of gasoline. Start with the delicious burrata cheese bruschetta
and spring vegetable “bagna cauda,” if only to admire the beauty of the
composition — that is, if the sashimi bar doesn’t waylay you first. The qui-
etly luxe room feels deceptively casual; the service meets the high stan-
dards of the globally inspired menu.

SOUTHERN ITALIAN
A-16 refers to the highway through the Campanga region of Italy (Naples
being the major city), and the menu at this stylishly spare restaurant not
only reflects the cuisine of southern Italy but also uses ingredients from
the area. Favorite dishes include burrata, a delicious mozzarella with a soft
center; various house-cured salumi; and among a handful of excellent main
courses, halibut trimmed with Meyer lemons and almonds. You’ll also find
a choice lineup of authentic Neapolitan pizzas and pasta dishes. I love the
varied seating options here — an outdoor patio, butcher-paper-covered
tables, banquettes, and stools at the bar where you can watch the chefs in
action.

SPANISH
You won’t find such authentic, homey Spanish food of this ilk outside of
Barcelona — the cod cheeks are a treat, a variety of paellas are suffused
with treasures, and you can make a happy meal of tapas, starting with my
favorite, morcilla, sausage and white beans. There’s not a lace fan or fla-
menco guitarist to be found within a mile of this modern spot, so don’t
come expecting a Spanish-themed evening. But if you want to feel like
you’re eating something out of the ordinary, you’ll be well rewarded.

The Blue Plate
$$
The Mission District
CALIFORNIA
Eat here and then go home and regale your less-adventurous friends about
the fabulous little restaurant you discovered in an out-of-the-way neigh-
borhood in San Francisco. Worth the ride from wherever you are, Blue
Plate exemplifies the best of intimate, staff-driven local places with fresh,
usually organic ingredients and a quirkiness in design that even dour
people can appreciate. My friend Vicki, who is a regular, always orders the
Sonoma duck confit (or tries to — the menu changes daily), but plenty of
other diners can’t pass on the smoked bacon and cornmeal fried oysters
over greens to start, or the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. Vicki’s boys
(husband included) consistently order a few sides of macaroni covered in
Spanish goat’s cheese, whether they need it or not. Sit in the back room by
the patio, or on the patio itself, weather permitting.

Boulevard
$$$$
The Embarcadero
AMERICAN
Housed in an elegant turn-of-the-century building with views of the Bay
Bridge (from tables in the very back only), this popular favorite of both
visitors and locals serves excellent, generous plates of seasonal comfort
food, such as tender lamb chops and lamb osso buco accompanied by local
asparagus in season. Start with the pan-seared foie gras while you can —
before the food police run it off the menu. Noisy but comfortable, the place
caters to an upscale, older crowd. Counter and bar seating is available for
those without reservations, but call three or four weeks in advance for a
prime-time table.

Butterfly
$$$
The Embarcadero
PAN-ASIAN
This is a beautiful restaurant on the water, a comfortable place to take in
the bay, with drinks and maybe some oysters before the sun sets. Butterfly
started in the Mission (where the original is now a bar/lounge), and its
roaring success led the chef-owner, Robert Lam, to salvage this room with
a view when the last owners couldn’t weather the economic downturn.
Lam’s use of local ingredients in recipes that pick and choose from various
Asian cuisines makes for unusual eating. If you’re in the mood to try some-
thing different, order his crispy, fried whole fish with kimchi, black bean
sauce, and Chinese sausage. You won’t know what to admire more — the
shimmering water or your dinner plate.

Cafe Kati
$$$
Japantown
CALIFORNIA
As in all the best spots, the menu here changes depending on what’s avail-

who likes to include a little something Eastern and a little something
Western. Thus, you may find seafood steamed in red Thai curry and a mari-
nated skirt steak with onion rings sharing the table and giving patrons
great pleasure. Wine lovers should investigate BYOB Tuesdays, when
Webber serves a $30 prix fixe with no corkage charge.

Canteen

Union Square
CALIFORNIA
Miniscule Canteen is the domain of the much-admired chef Dennis Leary,
whose bona fides include four years at Rubicon prior to opening this 20-
seat upscale diner. The fact that you’ll need a reservation even to eat at
the counter (there are but four tiny booths), should clue you in that this
is an unusual venture. Leary does the shopping as well as all the cooking,
and his menu changes to reflect what appeals on a weekly basis. If you’re
staying around Union Square, breakfast here is stellar, especially the
smoked salmon omelet or stuffed pancake. Work the phones to land a
dinner seat or come for lunch and see what all the fuss is about.

you score a table, it’s more fun to sit a while and savor the straightforward
pasta dishes, brick-oven-roasted chicken, thin-crusted pizzas, and yummy

Hotel restaurants aren’t the formal, grown-up, boring affairs they once

Among them is this destination for couture tapas in the Hotel Adagio. The
buzz is palpable from the bar and the Mondrian-meets-Miro dining room.
The surprise (if you’re mistrusting of glitz) is that the small plates — such
as prawns a la plancha or a salad of frisee, roasted beets, and Point Reyes
blue cheese — are beautifully presented and totally delicious.

elegant plate of endive and smoked trout helped lower resistance to the
inevitable changes in the neighborhood. Eight years later, the restaurant
continues to be a must-stop for hip gourmands.

beautifully executed (if you’re lucky, the Chinese-style roasted duck with
steamed green-onion buns will be on the menu); the chef, Bridget Batson,

many other restaurants can make. With a nod to the small plates trend,
you can now order appetizer-sized portions of some main dishes. The bar
attracts a grown-up crowd, so if you’re early for your reservation, take

I had a running argument with my cousin Irene over who made the wisest
picks at this stellar chef-owned-and-operated find. My crab salad was full
of freshly cracked crabmeat, but Irene’s baked goat’s cheese, surrounded
by pesto and perfectly ripe tomato, elicited a bit of a fork fight. We reached
an impasse between the grilled flatiron steak and the potato-wrapped sea
bass, but we agreed that based on price, atmosphere, service, and taste,
this was among the best meals we’ve shared in San Francisco. Luke Sung,
the genius behind the stove, has been recognized as a Rising Star Chef of

place to begin or end the evening. Share the tasting platter of Vietnamese

to admire them or finish ’em off in a bite or two. Larger plates, such as

Moose’s
$$$
North Beach
CALIFORNIA/MEDITERRANEAN
Popular with politicos, socialites, and local luminaries, the great thing
about Moose’s, besides the food, is that even the little people have a great
time eating here. Although a splendidly prepared appetizer of steak tartare
followed by the venison will definitely leave a little draft whistling through
your wallet, the smooth, professional staff and bright décor guarantee a
memorable, very San Francisco meal. Look for the daily changing Chef’s
Menu, three courses for $32 before 7:30 p.m. Afterwards, hang out at the
bar listening to the evening’s jazz pianist.

Not long after opening at the end of 2003, Quince became, and remains,
one of the more sought-after reservations in town. Chef/owner Michael
Tusk, an alumnus of Chez Panisse and Oliveto, and his wife Lindsey, have
created a refined retreat where every dish feels nurtured. The menu
changes daily, but if a crudo appears under the first-course selections,
don’t be shy, even if you think you don’t like raw fish. The house-made
pasta in any form will be equally inspired. Unlike so many new restaurants
in town that equate noise with buzz, Quince offers a grown-up dining ex-
perience in calm surroundings.

stairs tank and fresh, crisp vegetables such as Chinese broccoli and yin

with garlic).

backed by charming service. The coffee-rubbed pork shoulder is a
favorite, while Range’s delicate take on meat and potatoes — pan-roasted,
thinly sliced bavette steak (cut from the short loin) with narrow 
fingerlings — satisfies on a more primal level. Two simple yet warm dining
rooms, fronted by an attractive bar, allow for conversation, a nice touch
given how often restaurants seem designed to make that impossible.

Walk by the sidewalk tables covered in gaily printed cloths, and you’ll feel
the pull of this solidly established restaurant. From the couples praying
for a few bar stools to free up, to the parties sipping wine in the more pri-
vate and quieter dining areas in the back, the scene is intense, but the
sophisticated Mediterranean food often deserves the hype it gets. A
former waiter suggests that you go for lunch or dinner during the week;
on weekends, the kitchen is so crazed that your order may not get all the
attention it deserves.

After colonizing the Mission District and then moving temporarily to a

Russian Hill
AMERICAN
This urbane, Manhattan-like dining room only seats 45 (plus 12 at the bar),
and in such close confines you’ll have a chance to examine what the guy
next to you is eating. Chances are it’ll be delectable as the chef/co-owner,
Robert Riescher, left the renowned Erna’s Elderberry House for an oppor-
tunity to operate on his own. The menu changes daily, but with luck he’ll
be plating a topless ravioli dish with tender shreds of braised lamb shank
and mustard greens in a pool of onion broth. It is awesome and the focus
of one of my few regrets in life, because I wasn’t the one who ordered it.
Service is also professional and smart.

The latest destination spot to wow the city that knows how to eat (I saw

the Rosenthal brothers of Postrio fame, automatically raised the restau-
rant’s profile, and their cooking will keep it in the big leagues. If you 
like New Orleans–style dishes — multiflavored, multitextured, ample 
portions — you’ll love their cornmeal-fried oysters with baby spinach, cov-
ered in a jazzy bacon dressing, and the scallops with andouille sausage
jambalaya. There’s nothing shy about this food, and you don’t have to

Dim sum 101
I wasn’t sure what to expect the first time I tried dim sum, way back when. I’ll 
admit — and only because you were kind enough to buy this book — that I was a little
hesitant. The idea of eating these Chinese dumplings, filled with ingredients I couldn’t
identify at first, was a bit scary. But I’m delighted to report that I quickly overcame my
initial wariness and now adore dim sum. If you haven’t tried it, I urge you to do so.
In many Chinese restaurants, dim sum is served from late morning until around 2 p.m.,
but not later. In fact, if you arrive past 1 p.m., you run the risk of the kitchen losing inter-
est in providing much of anything to eat. It’s best to arrive around 11 a.m. Dim sum gen-
erally enters on carts wheeled about the room by waitresses. (Otherwise, you order
from a menu.) Ask for a table near the kitchen in order to get first crack at whatever’s
on its way around the room. The ladies with their carts will stop by your table and show
you what they have. If it looks appealing to you, nod or say, “Yes”; if not, just say, “No,
thanks.” It’s okay to order slowly — finishing one plate, sipping tea, and then order-
ing something else. By the way, if you run out of tea, open the teapot lid.
Here’s a rundown of dim sum that first-timers will definitely enjoy:
 Har gau: Shrimp dumplings encased in a translucent wrapper and steamed
 Sui mai: Rectangles of pork and shrimp in a sheer noodle wrapper
 Gau choi gau: Chives, alone or with shrimp or scallop
 Jun jui kau: Rice pearl balls with seasoned ground pork and rice
 Law mai gai: Sticky rice with bits of meat and mushrooms wrapped in a lotus leaf
 Char siu bau: Steamed pork buns — bits of barbecued meat in a doughy roll
 Guk char siu ban: Baked pork buns — bits of barbecued meat in a glazed roll
 Chun guen: Spring rolls — smaller, less-crowded version of egg roll
 Gau ji: Potstickers — a thick, crescent-shaped dough filled with ground pork
Where to go
Yank Sing, on the Embarcadero at Rincon Center, 101 Spear St. (% 415-957-9300;
www.yanksing.com), or 49 Stevenson St., near First Street (% 415-541-4949; lunch
only), is considered by those in the know to be one of the premier dim sum houses in
town. It’s also the most expensive in town, although you get a lot in terms of quality and
surroundings.
In Chinatown, Gold Mountain, 644 Broadway, near Stockton Street (% 415-296-7733),
is typical of the cavernous dim sum parlors that serve hundreds of families on the
weekends.
Lichee Garden (see review earlier in this chapter) is another very good spot for dim
sum in the sometimes-confusing array of Chinatown choices. It’s the favorite of one of
San Francisco’s most prominent chefs, as well as plenty of Chinatown workers on their
morning break.

Margaritas reach new heights of succulence in this brick, extremely loud
new hot spot near the ballpark. You’ll need to toss back a few to find the
noise level amusing, but for those of us who crave something more fulfill-

especially when starting the evening with some addictive pork riblets or
the masa cakes stuffed with onion and mushrooms (can’t drink on an
empty tummy, now, can we?). The carnitas (slow-roasted pork) plate is
delicious and it’s hard to stop filling the small, homemade tortillas with
the slightly spicy meat and accompaniments that include two kinds of
beans, a crunchy jicama and cabbage salad, and various salsas.

downright divine. Don’t opt for an outside table; the view on this section

Dining and Snacking on the Go
With the exception of Fisherman’s Wharf, where people attempt to walk
while balancing bread bowls filled with questionable clam chowder,
street food is practically nonexistent in San Francisco. (Although, in a
very weak moment, and for research purposes only, I once bought a hot
dog from a cart on PIER 39.) But that doesn’t mean you should head to
the closest fast-food chain for a meal on the go. Instead, head to one of
the many sandwich counters, Asian bakeries, Italian delis, coffeehouses,
or pastry shops that provide a grand variety of delicious foodstuffs
quickly and for reasonable to downright cheap prices.
Whether you’re feeling a bit peckish or positively peaked, you’ll find
something tempting to tide yourself over until the next big meal.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
146

Have food, will travel
Just 2 long blocks west of the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero, next
to Pier 5, is a bench-lined, refurbished wooden wharf with fine views that
practically begs for an impromptu picnic lunch. Plenty of other spots
around the city exist in which to unpack a brown bag, too.
You can generously fill your lunch pail at Molinari Delicatessen, a
second-generation, family-run Italian delicatessen with a fantastic assort-
ment of cheeses, inexpensive Italian wines, and friendly people who make
excellent sandwiches to go. It’s located at 373 Columbus Ave. in North
Beach (% 415-421-2337; www.molinarideli.com) and is open Monday
through Friday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Also in North Beach, on the corner of Columbus and Kearny, is a
Parisian-inspired, Italian cafe owned by the director Francis Ford
Coppola. Surprisingly, Café Zoetrope (% 415-291-1700; www.cafe
zoetrope.com) — part wine bar, part kitchen store — serves the most
delicious muffuletta (comprised of olive salad, mortadella, and pro-
volone) outside of New Orleans, a sandwich that once made my husband
so ecstatic he squirreled away half to eat the following day. The cafe is
open from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m. weekdays (closed Mon) and opens at
noon on the weekends, staying open until 10 p.m. Saturday and 9 p.m.
Sunday.
In the Financial District at Palio Paninoteca, 505 Montgomery St., near
California Street (% 415-362-6900; www.palipaninoteca.com), $7 gets
you a panino large enough for two. Fillings range from grilled vegetables
or meats to smoked prosciutto with Gorgonzola, mascarpone, and
arugula. It’s closed weekends. Weekdays, it’s open from 6:30 a.m. to 
4 p.m. Prefer a salad? Mixt Greens, 120 Sansome St., at Bush (% 415-
433-6498), provides a lovely range of made-to-order, truly gourmet
salads that you can eat on premises or take away.
Closer to Union Square, with another two locations in the Financial
District, is Specialty’s Café & Bakery, 1 Post St., at Market (% 415-
896-2253 or 877-502-2837; www.specialtys.com). This spot is popular
for a vast array of fresh sandwiches served on made-from-scratch
breads. It’s closed on weekends. Weekdays, it’s open from 6 a.m. to 
7 p.m.
The Ferry wonderful Building
If you only had a few hours to spend in San Francisco, I’d send you to the
splendidly remodeled Ferry Building on the Embarcadero at the foot of
Market Street. A landmark completed in 1898, the building gradually fell
into disuse after the Bay Bridge opened in 1936, allowing commuters from
the East Bay to drive, rather than ferry, into the city. The revitalization of
the Embarcadero seems complete now that the clock tower shines bea-
conlike in the evening, and the Ferry Building marketplace 
is a hub once more, drawing in people from around the Bay Area. Open
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 147

every day (a few shops are closed on Sun), the light-filled space has been
populated with the best local purveyors of food and food-related items.
For purposes of grabbing a quick bite, food to go, a picnic, or a complete
meal, you can find something satisfying just by making a tour of the open-
front shops. Some highlights: The Hog Island Oyster Company oyster bar,
with gorgeous bay views from the counter; Mastrelli’s Delicatessen, the
sister store to Molinari’s in North Beach, where you can order freshly
made sandwiches to go; and Golden Gate Meat Company, a small counter
that sells organic meats but also has lunch specials — my pastrami sand-
wich emitted such a delicious odor and looked so luscious, I actually had
people stopping me to ask where I’d bought it. You’ll also find a Japanese
deli, a French rotisserie, chocolate, gelato, cookbooks, and gifts.
Down on the farm — farmers’ market, that is
Saturday and Tuesday mornings bring the Ferry Plaza Farmers’ Market
in front of and behind the Ferry Building (open from 8 a.m.–1:30 p.m.). 
A jumble of basket- and canvas-sack-wielding couples pick over the heir-
loom tomatoes and grab the last of the wild strawberries while juggling
coffee and a cellphone. The simple beauty of the organic vegetables and
flowers makes a walk around the market an enormous pleasure, despite
the crowds. The Hayes Street Grill and Rose Pistola restaurants cook
gourmet breakfasts from their outdoor booths on Saturdays, and other
vendors sell items such as bottles of olive oil, jars of local honey, and
exotic orchid plants. This is also a great place to gather picnic food —
fresh bread, artisan cheeses, and fruit — for later in the day. The 
F-Market streetcar almost drops you at the door.
Snacking at the wharf
Let’s be frank. PIER 39/Fisherman’s Wharf is the most touristy part of
town. The restaurants that crowd Jefferson Street exist for the people
who are here today and gone tomorrow. I’ve learned to accept this, if not
to embrace it, and I’m not going to sneer at anybody who spends part of
a day here on the way to Alcatraz or just to see what all the fuss is about.
But let’s say that this person is hungry. Let’s say that this person has
heard about all the crab vendors and the sourdough bread, and thinks
to himself, “That sounds like lunch to me.” This is what I’d suggest: Buy
a bottle of beer, buy a little round of sourdough bread, and ask one of
the guys at a crab stand (try Fisherman’s Grotto No. 9) to cook, clean,
and crack a live crab for you. Then take these goodies and lots of nap-
kins through the doors marked “Passageway to the Boats,” walk down
this relatively quiet area, sit on the dock, and have a good time.
Remember: The local Dungeness crab season is from November through
May. In the summer, the crabs are flown in from Alaska or parts east.
Most recently, Boudin Bakery (the sourdough bread people) built a
nifty new demonstration bakery/cafe/museum on Fisherman’s Wharf
(160 Jefferson St. at Taylor Street; % 415-928-1849). You can watch
bread being prepared from a glass-walled catwalk suspended above the
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
148

action, take a tour, sample the wares, and tuck into your soup at indoor
and outdoor tables. Boudin created San Francisco’s distinctive sour-
dough loaves in 1849, and for an icon, they taste pretty darn good.
Unless you purchase a freshly cracked crab, rest assured that the $5.25
crab cocktail you ordered is made of canned crab — or even imitation
crab.
Flour power
You can have a swell time hunting and gathering among the bakeries in
North Beach. For starters, drop by Liguria Bakery, on the corner of
Stockton and Filbert streets (% 415-421-3786), for a sheet of plain
focaccia, or maybe one topped with green onions or tomato. They’re all
delicious and wrapped for portability. Liguria is open every day by 8
a.m. and closes when the last piece of focaccia is sold, usually by 2 p.m. I
also love Victoria Pastry Co., 1362 Stockton St., at Vallejo (% 415-781-
2015), which sells a large selection of Italian sweets (the chewy almond
cookies are good enough to give as a gift) and slices of its justly popular
cakes.
Citizen Cake, 399 Grove St., in Hayes Valley (% 415-861-2228), creates
the kind of homemade cookies, cakes, and desserts that ignites a love/
hate relationship between your taste buds and your hips. The spacious
cafe also serves lunch and dinner Tuesday through Friday (8 a.m. –
10 p.m.) and brunch and dinner on the weekends (Sat 10 a.m.–10 p.m.;
Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.) It’s located near the stylish Hayes Street shopping
blocks, which makes eating and spending so efficient. Now inhabiting
the back of the top floor of the Virgin Megastore, 2 Stockton St. at Market
Street (% 415-399-1565), is Citizen Cupcake. Here you can gaze at the
street scene below over coffee and mini scones, a beer and a sandwich,
or even a sake and a salad. Teens would especially enjoy a pit stop here.
A small chain of Boulangerie Bay Bread bakery/cafes has popped up in
the Haight-Ashbury, Cow Hollow, Fillmore, and Russian Hill neighbor-
hoods, with my favorite being Boulange de Polk, 2310 Polk St., at Green
Street (% 415-345-1107). Along with lovely French pastries (the can-
nelés de Bordeaux are swoon-worthy), you can order savory tarts, sand-
wiches, and salads to take away or eat at one of the coveted outdoor
tables.
Chinese bakeries
Chinese bakeries, which sell savory as well as sweet items, abound in
Chinatown, in the Sunset District on Irving Street, and in the Richmond
District on Clement Street. For snacking on the premises or on the go,
delicious baked or steamed pork buns (baked buns are golden brown,
and steamed buns are white) are ideal and a big hit with kids. If you
want something on the sweet side, custard tarts and sesame-seed-
covered balls of rice surrounding a bit of sweet bean paste are standard
issue. Look also for bo lo bow, slightly puffy and sweet bread with a
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 149

crust that resembles the outside of a pineapple, or chung yow bow,
green-onion bread. You may have to point to whatever looks appetizing
because the folks behind the counter don’t necessarily speak English.
Coffee and tea, if you please
Places to sit and sip are as prevalent as pigeons in this caffeine-crazed
piece of paradise. Coffeehouses — and I’m not even including the mega-
chains — nestle in every neighborhood, seemingly on every block. I
don’t think drinking coffee as a lifestyle was invented in North Beach,
but based on sheer numbers, it could have been. Regulars, of course,
have their favorite blends and favorite tables, but no one will argue
against hanging out at Mario’s Bohemian Cigar Store on the corner of
Columbus and Union Street (% 415-362-0536). Along with excellent
coffee (Graffeo), you can graze on a mouth-watering chicken parmigiana
on focaccia. Caffé Trieste, on Vallejo and Grant streets (% 415-982-2605;
www.caffetriseste.com), is a mob scene on Saturday afternoons,
when the owners and friends take a turn at the microphone to sing.
Coffee is served daily with or without opera.
Although that Seattle-based coffee Goliath continues to snap up real
estate in a quest to make everyone drink frappaccinos, we have our own
local chain to kick around. Actually, Peet’s Coffee and Tea is wor-
shipped by caffeine aficionados, and if you love really strong coffee, it’s
worth dropping by one of their many stores. The one closest to Union
Square is in the Financial District at 22 Battery St., at Bush (% 415-981-
4550; www.peets.com). You can also try the shop on Chestnut Street
between Steiner and Pierce streets in the Marina (% 415-931-8302) or
the newest one in the Ferry Building (% 415-593-3831). They’re all open
daily. In Hayes Valley, the community coffee klatch takes place in front of
a custom furniture workshop at 30 Linden St., an alley off Gough Street.
Look for the seemingly makeshift bar, indicating the Blue Bottle Coffee
Co. You can eavesdrop or make new friends while waiting in line for a
good strong cuppa.
Self-described coffee snobs have little choice but to drop by Ritual
Coffee Roasters, 1026 Valencia St. in the Mission (% 415-641-1024). The
beans come from Portland Oregon’s Stumptown Coffee and in all hon-
esty, they make the best cappuccino I have had in town (thanks, Bev).
The roomy storefront has a glass case filled with treats, free wireless,
and it’s open until 11 p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 9 p.m.
Sunday.
The peaceful Imperial Tea Court, 1411 Powell St., near Broadway 
(% 415-788-6080), is a must-stop in which to rest your feet and take
stock of your life — or maybe just the last half hour — over a pot of
exotic leaves and blossoms that would make Celestial Seasonings blush.
This is the place to sample the highest-quality teas as they were meant
to be brewed — and the staff will be happy to show you how it’s done.
Open Wednesday through Monday 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

Breakfast of champions
Touring is hard work; you need a good breakfast. Around Union Square
you can find lots of restaurants serving in the morning, including The
Grand Café (% 415-292-0101) on Geary and Sears Fine Food (% 415-
986-1160) on Powell, both across from Union Square, and open daily;
and my favorite, Dottie’s True Blue Café, 522 Jones St., between Geary
Boulevard and O’Farrell Street (% 415-885-2767). Open Wednesday
through Monday only, Dottie’s is a tiny diner that offers daily specials as
well as the basics — eggs, pancakes, sausage — all prepared with great
flair. The baked goods are so delicious you may want to purchase some
to go. Expect to wait in line on the weekends. When the lines at Dottie’s
and Sears appear too daunting, just walk over to Café Mason, 320 Mason
St. between Geary and O’Farrell (% 415-544-0320), for all kinds of fruit-
enhanced pancakes, eggs any way, or maybe yogurt and fresh fruit. For
Union Square, the prices are reasonable and the food’s fine. Across from
the Chinatown gate is Café de la Presse, 352 Grant Ave. (% 415-398-
2680), very European in feel, with excellent lattes, croissants, newspa-
pers, and lots of windows. Lines here move faster than you might think.
Bechelli’s, in the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhood at 2346 Chestnut St.,
between Divisadero and Scott streets (% 415-346-1801), serves a sub-
stantial breakfast until 3 p.m. during the week, and until 4 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday. To my mind, the booths, scruffy leatherette chairs, and
beat-up, horseshoe-shaped wooden counter add to the charm of this
neighborhood institution, but more importantly, the breakfast menu is
nearly as huge as the portions. Buttermilk pancakes, French toast, home-
made corned beef hash, and lots of omelets potentially will hold you for
a good part of the day. Kids often enjoy bellying up to the counter, and
the place has a very relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere. No reserva-
tions; credit cards are accepted.
Around the Embarcadero on Battery Street, Il Fornaio (% 415-986-0100;
www.ilfornaio.com) offers an array of baked goods that are sold from
a takeaway counter just inside. On the weekends, the restaurant opens
at 9 a.m. for brunch.
If you don’t mind traveling to Golden Gate Park to hunt down an early-
morning meal, take the N-Judah streetcar to Ninth Avenue, walk toward
the park, and at the corner of Lincoln and Ninth avenues you’ll find The
Canvas Café/Gallery (% 415-504-0060), open daily. As the name implies,
inside are paintings by local artists plus simple food for breakfast (oat-
meal, bagels, frittatas); sandwiches, salads, pizza, and Mediterranean
mezza (appetizer) or fondue platters to share for lunch; and afternoon
pick-me-ups including wine and beer. It’s exactly where you want to stop
before or after a day in the park.
Finally, if you have a soft spot for diners — and I mean the real thing, not
Happy Days replicas — make your way to the end of Geary Boulevard
(the name changes to Point Lobos Avenue) where it meets the Great
Highway. The little joint overlooking the old Sutro Baths is Louis, 902
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in San Francisco 151

Point Lobos Ave. (% 415-387-6330), which opened in 1937 and has an
endless view of the Pacific Ocean. Louis serves breakfast and lunch daily
from 6:30 a.m., nothing to write home about, but there’s something com-
fortable and familiar about the décor (linoleum, worn booths) and a big
plate of eggs over easy, country ham, and hash browns. This is a fine
place to eat before hiking along the Coastal Trail, golfing at Lincoln Park,
or heading to Golden Gate Park. Cash and traveler’s checks only.
Pizza and other cheap eats
Although I’m known to criticize fast food, I consider pizza an exception.
Good pizza can make a perfectly satisfying, easygoing, low-rent meal.
And although San Francisco doesn’t have the reputation of either New
York or Chicago in the pizza department, you won’t have any difficulty
finding a ready slice in any neighborhood.
Uncle Vito’s Pizzadelli, on the corner of Bush and Powell streets 
(% 415-391-5008), serves credible pie with a big selection of toppings,
good salads, and enough pasta dishes to carbo-load for the next day’s
adventures. Uncle Vito’s is inexpensive and convenient to Nob Hill and
Union Square, so you’ll see lots of foreign tourists here, attempting to
put together just the right combination of pizza and beer. When shop-
ping on Fillmore Street, stop by Dino’s Pizzeria (% 415-922-4700) to
check up on sports scores and dig into one of Dino’s thick-crusted,
cheesy creations. It’s on the corner of Fillmore and California, where
you’ll often find Dino at the door eyeing passersby and chatting up the
regulars.
If too much exposure to coddled food makes you long for a touch of
grease, you can find a couple places to deal with your craving for ham-
burgers, fries, and a shake. Mo’s Grill, which makes many kinds of bur-
gers, is South of Market at Folsom and Fourth streets, on the southwest
side of Yerba Buena Gardens (% 415-957-3779). You can also find a
branch in North Beach on Grant Street, between Vallejo and Green 
(% 415-788-3779). Because I have a soft spot for ’50s-patterned Formica
and bright colors, my favorite place to chew the fat is Burger Joint in
the Mission on 807 Valencia St. (% 415-824-3494). And, despite my
protestations against fast food, Taylor’s Refreshers at the Ferry Building
makes a great burger and a greater milkshake. Anyway, they aren’t that
fast.
North Beach also shelters at least two eateries specializing in roasted
chicken, the oldest being Il Pollaio, 555 Columbus Ave., between Union
and Green streets (% 415-362-7727). A very casual place to sit down for
savory chicken and other meats and salads, this is where you go when
the kids start rolling their eyes if you mention dim sum or sea bass. It’s
also a good choice when you’re tired of spending too much money on
dinner.
Part III: Settling Into San Francisco 
152

Adventure eaters in the mood for Indian food will barely feel a strain on
the pocketbook at Shalimar, 532 Jones St., between Geary and O’Farrell
(% 415-928-0333), another Formica-tabled hole-in-the-wall in the
Tenderloin/Union Square area. Order at the counter, sit at your table,
watch for your food to come up, and then enjoy delicious curries,
savory nan bread, and tandoori. It’s open daily for lunch and dinner;
cash only. Another highly recommended restaurant in the Tenderloin,
and attractive enough for a date, is the Bodega Bistro, 607 Larkin St. at
Eddy (% 415-921-1218). The pho ga, Vietnamese chicken noodle soup,
is simply wonderful, due in part to brilliant chicken stock. Another can’t
miss is the papaya salad, but in fact, the dishes here are some of the
best in the category. If you are uncomfortable in the neighborhood,
come for lunch. Cash only.
The real dill
Oh, happy day. A genuine delicatessen, with bagels imported directly
from New York, exists right here in San Francisco. You don’t know how
we suffered until Miller’s East Coast West Delicatessen started with the
chicken soup and the matzo balls, not to mention the pastrami, the pick-
led herring, and the brisket (every bit as good as mine, if not better).
Located at 1725 Polk St. (% 415-563-3542) and open daily, this is also 
a fine place to get sandwiches to take with you for the trip home — 
I wouldn’t want you to go hungry.

Part IV
Exploring 
San Francisco

In this part . . .
N
ow you get to the main course. This part tells you
about the landmarks and neighborhoods that deﬁne
San Francisco to the world. And you know what? Most of
them are worthy of their star billing.
How do you take in everything? That depends on how much
time you have. If you have only a day or two, a guided tour
may be the best way of at least seeing, if not savoring, the
sites. Or you can pick and choose from a list of a few places
to see, spend some quality time at each of those sites, and
plan on coming back to the city another time to catch the
rest. If you have three or more days to wander, take a look at
my suggested itineraries for an idea of how to absorb as
much of the city as possible.
Don’t forget the shopping opportunities while the pleasure of
browsing in one-of-a-kind stores is still possible. An entire
shopping chapter awaits, and it’s ﬁlled with suggestions of
where to ﬁnd interesting clothes, gifts, and foods that you
won’t ﬁnd in your local mall. Leave room in your suitcase —
it’ll be heavier on the trip home.
You’d think it would be enough for me to help you plan your
trip to San Francisco, a marvel among big cities, but no . . . 
I toss in a few extra treats for your dining and sightseeing
pleasure. Chief among them are trips to the gorgeous Napa
and Sonoma valleys, where the sights and scents of grapes
and olives act like a restorative. Closer still is Berkeley, a
microcosm of Northern California life that revolves around
the university and a vibrant dining scene. Finally, nature boys
and girls will have a veritable ﬁeld day hiking or relaxing on
the coast in verdant Point Reyes and Inverness.

S
omething is bringing you to San Francisco. Perhaps you’ve been
overcome by recollections of old Rice-A-Roni commercials (“the San
Francisco treat [ding ding!]”) that became synonymous with cable cars.
Or maybe visions of the Golden Gate Bridge spanning the icy waters of
the bay are pulling you to the left coast. Are the views from your window
a bit too flat? Is the thrill-seeker in you ready for the action our hills pro-
vide to drivers and passengers alike? Did you manage to schedule a
week off from work, and coming to San Francisco just seemed like a
good idea? Whatever your reasons for choosing this city, I don’t think
you’ll be bored, and I know you won’t be disappointed.
You may be curious to understand firsthand why this city is different
from any other urban center in the United States and why its residents
are so passionate about where they live. After a few days making your
way around, you may glean some of the reasons, the most apparent of
which is the sheer beauty of the setting. There’s more of course. You
never know what you’ll see when you look carefully. Take those cable
cars, for example: Sure, they’re a fun ride, but as you climb aboard,
observe the gripman (or gripwoman — there’s one) and the other pas-
sengers, and note how the neighborhoods change as you head from
Union Square through North Beach or past Nob Hill. Even watching the
passersby on the pavement is an experience. I’ll always remember how

heads turned (and kept turning) to follow a gorgeous girl in her black
leather pants as she sashayed up Mason Street. It was certainly the first
time I’ve ever been on a cable car that intentionally moved backward!
The following list gives you a quick reference of the features that make
San Francisco, well, San Francisco.
San Francisco’s Top Attractions
Alcatraz Island
Fisherman’s Wharf
Hollywood movies, including Birdman of Alcatraz, Escape from Alcatraz,
and The Rock, have recast what is essentially an early-20th-century ruin
in San Francisco Bay into a hugely popular tourist site. Even if you’re famil-
iar with this former military fort and federal prison only from vague refer-
ences to its famous prisoners — Al Capone, “Machine Gun” Kelly, Robert
(the Birdman) Stroud — you’ll find the self-guided tour of the cell house
strangely moving. I credit this to the excellent audio guide that includes
remembrances narrated by former guards and prisoners, and to the low-
key manner in which Alcatraz is presented. No attempt is made to glam-
orize the inmates or to condemn the system. This was a cold, isolated,
maximum-security prison housing the most hardened criminals of the day,
which coincidentally offered them glimpses of an enticing city, perhaps
invoking longing and regret. Imagining what life here was like isn’t all that
difficult, but at the moment you begin to feel inklings of pity for the incar-
cerated, a vividly told story of an attempted prison escape reminds the
listener that these inmates were, for the most part, remorseless. Before or
after the cellblock tour, you’re invited to view an orientation video and,
during fall and winter, you can tour the island itself on a walking path that
begins near the ferryboat landing. (The trail is closed from mid-Feb
through early Sept during bird-nesting season.) Rangers are around for
questions, and they often give talks on the history of the prison and
famous escapes. Bring a jacket as well as comfortable shoes for the steep
walk to the cell house. A tram is available once an hour to take wheelchair
users or anyone unable to make the walk up to the prison. The Alcatraz
experience takes about two and a half hours, including the ferry ride.

Saving on entrance fees
Your timing has to be right, but if you’re in the neighborhood take advantage of free
museum days. Entry to the California Academy of Sciences and the Exploratorium is
free on the first Wednesday of every month; the Asian Art Museum, the Museum of
Modern Art (MoMA), and the Legion of Honor are gratis on the first Tuesday of every
month. Every Thursday after 5 p.m., admission is reduced at the Asian and at MoMA,
and they stay open until 9 p.m.

To get the full effect of what being an inmate may have been like, try the
Alcatraz After Hours tour. The prison becomes especially sinister when
the sun goes down, so use discretion before deciding to bring kids along.
The tour is offered Thursday through Sunday only; the ferry departs at
6:15 p.m. and 7 p.m. (4:20 p.m. during the winter).
During the summer, you must reserve tickets far in advance for the ferry
ride to the island, and tickets purchased are valid only on the date 
and time indicated on the ticket. Order tickets over the Web site, or 
call % 415-981-ROCK to purchase tickets over the phone.
See maps p. 164 and p. 171. Pier 33, at Fisherman’s Wharf for location of ferry 
departures. % 415-981-ROCK. www.alcatrazcruises.com or www.nps.gov/
alcatraz.com. Open: Winter daily 9:30 a.m.–2:15 p.m.; summer daily 9:30 a.m.–
4:15 p.m. Ferries run approximately every half hour; arrive at least 20 minutes before
sailing time. F-Market streetcar, Powell-Mason cable car (the line ends a few blocks
away), or 30-Stockton bus. Admission (includes ferry and audio tour): $19 adults, $17
seniors 62 and older, $11 children 5–11. Night tour fares are $26 adults, $23 seniors
and kids 12–17, $14 children 5–11.
Asian Art Museum
Civic Center
The new Asian Art Museum holds one of the largest collections of Asian art
in the Western world, covering 6,000 years and encompassing the cultures
of Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Formerly housed in Golden
Gate Park, the Asian gathered public and private funds to renovate the
interior of the old Beaux Arts Main Library and create 37,500 square feet
of exhibition space (and if that doesn’t invigorate Civic Center, I’m not sure
what will). Although the collection remains more than enough reason to
visit, the renovation has also attracted plenty of attention. It is designed
by Gae Aulenti, the Milanese architect who renovated the former d’Orsay
train station in Paris into the popular Musée d’Orsay. The Asian is com-
pact, and it won’t take you more than a few hours to see all the galleries.
Cafe Asia on the first floor is open from 10 a.m. for drinks and Asian-
influenced dishes served cafeteria style.

Cable Cars
Union Square/Financial District
San Francisco’s most notable icon is probably the cable car. These cher-
ished wooden cars creak and squeal up and around hills while passengers
lean out into the wind, running the risk of getting their heads removed by
passing buses. San Francisco’s three existing lines comprise the world’s only
surviving system of cable cars, and they are a delight to ride. The sheer joy
of whizzing down a hill with the bay glistening in the foreground will linger
in your memory. But these legendary icons aren’t just fun, they’re also a
useful means of transportation. The Powell-Mason line wends its way from
the corner of Powell and Market streets through North Beach and ends near
Fisherman’s Wharf. If you only have time to ride the cars once, this is the
one I’d recommend. It will take you most of the way to Fisherman’s Wharf,
or, if you prefer, you can hop off when you get to North Beach. The Powell-
Hyde line, which starts at the same intersection, ends up near the Maritime
Museum and Ghirardelli Square. The somewhat less thrilling, but less
crowded California line begins at the foot of Market Street and travels
straight up California Street over Nob Hill to Van Ness Avenue.
I thought I had a foolproof method of avoiding the crowds at the cable-car
turnarounds (which is literally where the cars are turned around at 
the end of the line) by waiting 2 blocks from the Powell Street turnaround,
but after forcing my visiting brother to watch as one car after another
passed us by (“And you do this professionally?” he said), my only other
suggestion is to get up early to ride. (It turns out we were waiting at what

Maximum prison to maximum attraction
Alcatraz Island was first discovered in 1775. Due to its strategic location in San
Francisco Bay, the U.S. Army took notice and began building a military fortress atop
“The Rock.” From 1850 to 1933, it served as a military post and army prison, housing
Civil War, Spanish-American War, and, finally, civilian prisoners. In 1934, it was con-
verted into a maximum-security prison. The prison was home to famous gangsters
such as Al Capone; Robert Stroud, the so-called Birdman of Alcatraz (because he was
an expert on ornithological diseases — he never kept birds on Alcatraz); and
“Machine Gun” Kelly. Twenty-nine prisoners tried to escape from Alcatraz — two
made it ashore, only to be captured almost immediately, and five presumably drowned,
although their bodies were never recovered. All 29 attempts are said to have failed. The
prison closed in 1963, due to deterioration of the buildings and prohibitive maintenance
costs. Alcatraz became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972.

the hotel doormen refer to as “Fantasy Island.”) You can also try walking
a few more blocks to the next stop. (Stops are indicated by brown signs
with a white cable car on them.) Although at first it will appear that there’s
no room among the zillions of passengers already on the car, by magic a
foothold may open up. Otherwise, go get in line with a coffee. Cars run
from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. The fare is $5 per person one-way, payable on
board; Muni Passports are accepted. For more information, call Muni at
% 415-673-6864 or log on to www.sfmuni.com. See Chapter 8 for more
details, including a route map on p. 80.
Chinatown
Crowded with pedestrians and crammed with exotic-looking shops and
vegetable markets whose wares spill onto the sidewalks, Chinatown is a
genuinely fascinating destination. Take your time as you walk through this
enclave, housing the largest Chinese population outside of Asia — it’s easy
to miss something. The Dragon Gate arch at Grant Avenue and Bush
Street (just a few blocks north of Union Square) marks the entry to
Chinatown. To get a more authentic experience, avoid the visiting hordes
and explore the side streets and alleys off Grant Avenue. If you stay for
lunch or dinner, your adventure will take about a half-day. Walking from
Union Square is the more sensible way to get here, but you can also reach
Chinatown by taking the 30-Stockton bus — quite an experience during
rush hour; parking is nearly impossible, but if you want to try it, your best
bet is on Kearny Street at Portsmouth Square. (See Chapter 10 for dining
suggestions and Chapter 12 for where to shop.) While you’re in Chinatown,
don’t miss the following highlights.
The Chinese Historical Society of America is a good place to begin your
Chinatown tour. A museum and research center, the Historical Society 
documents the fascinating story of the Chinese in California through 
photographs, art, and changing exhibits. Its bookstore stocks fiction and
nonfiction titles on Chinese themes.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 167
The steel wheels tour
The famous cable cars you see going up and down the hills of downtown San
Francisco were invented in 1869 by Andrew Hallidie. Hallidie saw the need for a new
mode of transportation when he witnessed a horse-drawn streetcar slide backward
down one of the many steep slopes that make up San Francisco’s unique topography.
Here’s how the cable-car system works: A steel cable is housed just under the street
in a rail, kind of like an inside-out train rail (it’s the cable that makes that clickity-clack-
ing sound). Powered by electricity, this cable constantly runs through the rail. Each
cable car has a lever that, when pulled back, closes a pincerlike “grip” on the cable.
The person who pulls the lever is called a gripper — some would call this person a
driver, but he doesn’t drive, he “grips” the cable. The cable car is then attached to the
cable that runs through the rail under the pavement, and the car begins to move at a
constant 9 mph — the speed at which the cable is set to travel.

See map p. 168. 965 Clay St. % 415-391-1188. www.chsa.org. Admission: $3 adults,
$2 seniors, $1 children 6–12; free first Thurs of the month. Open: Tues–Fri noon–
5 p.m., Sat–Sun noon to 4 p.m.
Tin How Temple, one of the oldest Chinese temples in the United States,
is dedicated to the Goddess of Heaven, protector of fishermen. The temple
is open to the public, but please keep in mind this is an active house of
worship. Be prepared to climb a narrow staircase to the top floor, and
make an offering or buy some incense on your way out.
See map p. 168. 125 Waverly Place, off Clay Street between Stockton and Grant
streets. No phone. Admission: Free. Open: 9 a.m.–4 p.m. daily.
Golden Gate Fortune Cookies Company is a working factory where you
can buy bags of fresh, inexpensive almond and fortune cookies. You may
find the cramped quarters somewhat claustrophobic, but watching
rounds of dough transmogrify into cookies is fun.
See map p. 168. 956 Ross Alley, between Jackson and Washington streets near Grant
Avenue. No phone. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.
Portsmouth Square, a park above the Portsmouth Square parking garage
on Kearny Street between Washington and Clay streets, marks the spot
where San Francisco was originally settled and is the site of the first
California public school, which opened in 1848. A compact but complete
playground attracts all the neighborhood preschoolers and, in the morn-
ing, elderly Chinese people practice their tai chi exercises. The landscape
includes comfortable benches, attractive lampposts, and young trees.
The distinctly San Francisco view includes the Transamerica Pyramid
looming above the skyline. The garage below is a good place to know
about if you’re driving. Interestingly, the garage’s fourth floor is most
likely to have empty spaces, because in Cantonese, the word for four
sounds like the word for death. Superstitious Chinese won’t park there.
The pedestrian bridge over Kearny Street leads directly into the third floor
of the Chinatown Hilton, where you’ll find the Chinese Culture Center. A
gift shop leads to the gallery, where changing exhibits may feature photo-
graphs from pre-earthquake Chinatown, Chinese brush painting, or
embroidered antique clothing and household items. The Center also offers
two-hour docent-led heritage walks for groups of 4 or more by reservation;
$17 adults and $8 kids under 12.
See map p. 168. 750 Kearny St. % 415-986-1822. www.c-c-c.org. Admission: Free.
Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Coit Tower
Telegraph Hill (near North Beach)
Erected in 1933 with funds bequeathed to the city by Lillie Hitchcock Coit,
this 210-foot concrete landmark is visible from much of the city. But every-
one needs to take a closer look to see the beauty of the tower. The décor
inside features walls with dramatic murals inspired by and commissioned

during the Great Depression. Take an elevator to the top for panoramic
views of the city and the bay. This diversion will probably take about 30
minutes from start to finish.
See map p. 164. Atop Telegraph Hill. % 415-362-0808. Take the 39-Coit bus, or walk
from Lombard Street where it meets Telegraph Hill Boulevard (2 blocks east 
of Stockton Street). Parking: The drive up and the parking lot are always a mass of
cars. Admission to top of tower: $4.50 adults, $2.50 seniors, $1.50 kids 6–12. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Exploratorium/Palace of Fine Arts
Marina District
Scientific American magazine rates the Exploratorium as “the best science
museum in the world,” and it’s certainly an intriguing space that appeals
to all ages. The hands-on exhibits explore topics such as technology,
human perception, and natural phenomena. Well-written text accompa-
nies the exhibits to enhance the learning experience. Don’t worry about
feeling like a science dunce if you’re visiting with children; a well-informed
volunteer is ready to field any questions you can’t answer. Expect to spend
two hours minimum exploring the museum, especially if you’re traveling
with kids. Allow more time, and make advance reservations, if you want
to experience the popular Tactile Dome, a pitch-black geodesic dome that
you have to feel your way through. A walk around the grounds of the
Palace of Fine Arts, which now houses the Exploratorium but was origi-
nally built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, is a great
way to unwind after exploring the museum. Better yet, if the weather’s
balmy, bring a picnic and stay a while.
See map p. 164. 3601 Lyon St., at Marina Boulevard. % 415-561-0360. www.
exploratorium.edu. 30-Stockton bus to Marina stop. Parking: Free and easy.
Admission: $13 adults; $10 students, youth 13–17, and seniors; $8 kids 4–12; free kids
3 and under; free for all first Wed of the month; tactile dome: $16 (includes general
admission) all ages. Open: Summer (Memorial Day to Labor Day) daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.,
Wed until 9 p.m.; winter Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Fisherman’s Wharf
Don’t be confused when you arrive at Fisherman’s Wharf and see lots of
people wandering around, none of whom appear to fish for a living. This
was once a working set of piers, but today it’s a seemingly endless outdoor
shopping mall masquerading as a bona fide destination. Some people
enjoy examining the refrigerator magnets and cable-car bookends stocked
in one olde shoppe after another; others, dazed in the presence of so much
kitsch, plan their escape. Still, because most folks stop by the wharf for
one reason or another, here’s a rundown of what’s there.
No matter the weather, tourists crowd PIER 39, a multilevel, Disneyesque
shopper’s dream (or nightmare). Arcades, lined with deafening video
games, anchor the pier on each end. You can also find T-shirt and sweat-
shirt shops and plenty of fried food. Join the mob if you want to see the
views of Alcatraz visible from the end of the pier or watch the huge sea

lions that loaf around on the west side of the pier (follow the barking).
Catch the ferry to Alcatraz or for bay cruises as well. If you’re hungry,
stop by the only authentic place to eat, the Eagle Cafe (% 415-433-
3689), open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on the second floor. This inex-
pensive breakfast and lunch joint opened in 1920. If you’re arriving by
car, park on adjacent streets or on the wharf between Taylor and Jones
streets. Note: The parking garage charges $5.50 per hour! Do your best
to avoid these price gougers and don’t bring a car here. Besides, taking
the F-Market down the Embarcadero is much more fun (see Chapter 8).
The giant fish bowl known as the Aquarium of the Bay is dedicated to
the creatures that inhabit the San Francisco Bay ecosystem (so don’t go
looking for tropical species). After a brief introduction to the underwater
world, facilitated by the Aquarium’s loquacious band of naturalists, visi-
tors descend to a moving walkway that slowly leads through two clear
tunnels surrounded by 700,000 gallons of filtered bay water. Many thou-
sands of fish swim by (some seemingly chasing their lunch), and if
you’ve ever wanted to be practically face to face with a Prionace glauca,
this is your big chance. The last exhibit contains touch pools, always a
hit with children. Should a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium be in your
future, you can easily skip this smaller cousin, but for something with an
educational component on the wharf, this is a refreshing stop.
See map p. 171. PIER 39 Fisherman’s Wharf. % 800-SEA-DIVE. www.aquarium

ticket. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; summer daily 9 a.m.–
8 p.m.
The San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is a small two-story
museum overlooking the bay and Alcatraz. It takes only 15 minutes or so
to examine the model schooners, figureheads, and photographs illustrat-
ing the city’s maritime heritage, although children may lose interest after
the first five minutes. Still, it’s sweet and admission is free. The museum
will be closed for remodeling, however, until mid-2008

The National Park Service has also opened a new visitor center inside
the Argonaut Hotel (see Chapter 9), which partners with the Maritime
National Historical Park. Along with exhibits and an educational center,
the ranger-staffed desk can answer questions about special events on the
Hyde Street Pier.

If you have small children along (or anyone interested in history), you
won’t want to miss touring the USS Pampanito. This submarine saw
active duty during World War II and helped save 73 British and
Australian prisoners of war. The family pass (for two adults and up to
four children) also gets you into the Hyde Street Pier (see following).

At the Hyde Street Pier, 2 blocks east of the Maritime Museum, you can
roam around on a number of historic, refurbished ships. Of particular
note is the 112-year-old Balclutha, a square-rigger with an interesting
past. During the year, activities that take place on the Balclutha include
concerts, sea chantey singalongs, and children’s events. Call for a sched-
ule. Touring the vessels takes at least an hour or so.

Ghirardelli Square, which is the site of the original Ghirardelli choco-
late factory, across the street from the Maritime Park, offers one of the
more pleasant shopping-mall experiences in the area. Granted landmark
status in 1982, the series of brick buildings is home to a roster of special
events, including an annual chocolate-tasting benefit in September.
Street performers entertain regularly in the West Plaza. Open daily 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. in winter, to 9 p.m. in summer.

Go 1 block east of Ghirardelli Square and you find what was once the
largest peach-canning facility on earth. Today, The Cannery at Del Monte
Square features shops, jugglers, musicians, and food, including a small
farmers’ market Friday and Saturday mornings from 8 a.m. until noon.
Visitors especially enjoy Lark in the Morning (% 415-922-HARP), a
music haven with an array of early music and modern instruments. Gift
shoppers of a practical bent and people with newly formed blisters will
also love Sock Heaven (% 415-563-7327), which, as the name implies,
sells foot coverings, in both silly and conventional patterns. If the kids get
wiggly (or if the weather is ugly and you need something to keep them
occupied), head to the Basic Brown Bear Factory (% 866-5BB-BEAR),
which is located on the first floor of the South Building. Customers stuff
and help sew teddy bears to take home, and you can take a tour of the fac-
tory, which recently relocated from its longtime Potrero Hill lair. The
Oakville Grocery (% 415-614-1600), a favorite stop for folks heading up
Hwy 29 in the Napa Valley, is a welcome new addition on the corner of
Leavenworth and Jefferson. A counter overlooks the sidewalk and it’s a
good place for people-watching while snacking on pizza, one of the pretty
salads, a made-to-order sandwich, or irresistible sweet from the pastry
case. In the back there’s a wine bar if you aren’t in a hurry.
See map p. 171. At the foot of Polk Street, on the western edge of the Embarcadero.
% 415-556-3002. Take the Powell-Hyde cable-car line to the last stop; the F-Market
streetcar; or the 19-Polk, 30-Stockton, 42-Downtown Loop, or 47–Van Ness bus.
Parking: Pricey lots and garages; street parking is difficult. Admission: Free. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 173

Golden Gate Bridge
This quintessential San Francisco landmark spans 17⁄10 miles and soars hun-
dreds of feet above the water. Bundle up against the windy conditions, and
then set out from the Roundhouse on the San Francisco side of the bridge
lot (see “Especially for hikers,” later in this chapter, for information on
walking to the bridge). It can get pretty noisy, but the views can’t be beat.
Remember that the only way to return from the other side is on foot, so
know your limits before crossing the whole bridge and finding out you’re
too tired to make it back. Afterward, take some time to climb below the
bridge to see the 5-acre garden there. The 28–19th Avenue or the 29-Sunset
bus deposits you across from the viewing area, right by a parking lot. If
you’re driving, take 19th Avenue or Lombard Street and pay attention to
the sign that indicates when to exit for the parking lot. Otherwise, enjoy
your drive across the bridge: There’s a $5 toll upon your return to the city.
See map p. 164. Highway 101 North. www.goldengatebridge.org. Admission:
Free for pedestrians; $5 toll per car. Open to pedestrians: Daily 5 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
Golden Gate Park
Once nothing but a sand-covered tract, today’s glorious Golden Gate Park
features 1,017 acres of greenery and cultural attractions. San Franciscans
can be spotted doing just about everything here, from playing soccer to
sailing model yachts to throwing family reunions. On Sundays, when John
F. Kennedy Drive is closed to street traffic, bicyclists ride with impunity,
and in-line skaters converge for dance parties. From April through the
middle of October, also on Sundays, the Golden Gate Park Band plays in
April through October, Sundays from 1 to 3 p.m. in the Spreckles Temple
of Music, between the new de Young Museum and the California
Academy of Sciences construction site. (If they aren’t there, the musicians
may have decamped to the lawn in the Strybing Arboretum.) A massive
Children’s Playground and a beautifully restored carousel sit just past the
grand park entrance on Stanyan Street (off Waller Street). This remodeled
entrance, for some reason, reduced the rather large number of street
people who used to hang out there (the Haight seems to attract youthful
transients and burnouts) but didn’t completely eliminate the panhandling.
In any event, don’t let that keep you away. Another entrance at Ninth
Avenue on Lincoln Way brings you to the Strybing Arboretum and the
Japanese Tea Garden.
Joggers and parents pushing baby strollers make regular use of the path
around man-made Stow Lake. It’s the perfect place to take advantage of a
sunny day by renting a paddleboat and having a picnic. The boathouse
(% 415-752-0347) also rents bikes and in-line skates by the hour, half-day,
and full-day. If you aren’t driving, it’s a bit of a walk to the boathouse, which
is west of the Japanese Tea Garden on Martin Luther King Drive. It’s open
daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
See map p. 175. www.parks.sfgov.org. The N-Judah Muni Metro streetcar
drops you off on Ninth Avenue and Judah Street; from there it is a 3-block walk to 
the park. Numerous bus lines drive close to or into the park, including the 
44-O’Shaughnessy, which you can catch on Ninth Avenue, the 21-Hayes, the

71-Haight-Noriega, and the 5-Fulton. You can also transfer to the 44-O’Shaughnessy
from the 38-Geary bus on Sixth Avenue. Open daily. Contact individual attractions for
hours and admission prices.
California Academy of Sciences
Golden Gate Park
The Academy features an aquarium and traveling exhibits on everything
from dinosaurs to spiders, which complement the informative permanent
natural history exhibits. However, it’s closed for renovation until 2008. See
the “Especially for kids” section, later in this chapter, for information on
the Academy’s temporary digs downtown.
The Conservatory of Flowers
Golden Gate Park
A fixture in guidebooks and tourist brochures, and nearly as recognizable
as the Golden Gate Bridge, the postcard-perfect Victorian Conservatory
of Flowers closed in 1995 after sustaining massive damage during a storm.
Prefabricated in Ireland in 1875 and erected in the park around 1878, the
cost to repair the glass and wood greenhouse topped $25 million, all of
which was privately donated. Construction was finished in 2003, and the
Conservatory is back to its exquisite self, with lines of delighted visitors
snaking past the entrance. Rare orchids, ferns, tropical plants, and a 100-
year-old philodendron rescued from the wreckage are on exhibit.
See map p. 175. Conservatory: Just off John F. Kennedy Drive, near the Stanyan
Street entrance. % 415-666-7001.
www.conservatoryofflowers.org.
Admission: $5 adults, $3 seniors and youth 12–17, $1.50 kids 5–11, free for children
under 5. Free first Tues of the month. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
The de Young Museum
Golden Gate Park
San Francisco Chronicle publisher, M. H. de Young founded the city’s first
fine arts museum in 1895. Its eclectic permanent collection today includes
American paintings as well as sculpture, textiles, African and Oceanic
objects, furniture, and contemporary crafts housed in a sprawling, copper-
clad three-story complex that opened in October 2005. If you want to make
some sense of the collection, consider taking one of the free docent tours
offered daily at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. A highlight of the build-
ing is the 144-foot tower offering unobstructed views (if the sky is clear) of
the neighborhoods beyond the park. Access to the tower is free, even if
you don’t intend on touring the museum. The museum’s cafe is the only sit-
down restaurant in the park. Not inexpensive, the menu (salads, sand-
wiches, a few mains such as steamed halibut) features local producers and
seasonal produce.
See map p. 175. 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr., off John F. Kennedy Drive. % 415-863-
3330. www.deyoungmuseum.org. Admission: $10 adults, $7 seniors, $6 students
and kids 13–17, free for children under 13. $2 discount with Muni transfer or fast pass.
Open: Tues–Sun 9:30a.m.–5 p.m., until 8:45 p.m. Fri.

The Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens
Golden Gate Park
This splendid oasis houses over 6,000 species of well-tended plants, flow-
ering trees, and theme gardens. It is exceptionally lovely in late winter
when the rhododendrons blossom and wild iris poke up in corners, and
there is no more peaceful a place when it’s rainy and gray outside. You can
catch a free docent tour offered daily at 1:30 p.m.; I recommend it for those,
like myself, who are arboreally and botanically challenged when trying to
identify any but the most basic of flowers and trees. Plan to spend at least
half an hour here just wandering around.
See map p. 175. Ninth Avenue at Lincoln Way, left of the tour bus parking lot by the
Music Concourse. % 415-661-1316, ext. 314, for docent tour information. www.sf
botanicalgarden.org. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Japanese Tea Garden
Golden Gate Park
Enjoying this tranquil spot, with colorful pagodas, koi ponds, bridges, 
and a giant bronze Buddha, you feel like you’ve been transported for a
moment to the Orient. Young children find this part of the park particu-
larly memorable — they can climb over a steeply arched wooden bridge
here, just as I did when I was much younger and lots more limber than I am
today. The Tea Garden’s beauty is slightly marred by its gift shop, full of
miniature license plates and other junk. Bus tours overrun this major des-
tination during the day, so try to get here before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.
during the summer to avoid the onslaught. You can partake of Japanese
tea and snacks in the teahouse for $2.95 per person. I think the garden is
worth the small admission fee, but you won’t be missing anything if you
pass on the tea and crackers.
See map p. 175. The garden entrance is to the left of the de Young Museum. 
% 415-752-4227. Admission: $3.50 adults, $1.25 seniors and children 6–12. Open: Daily
8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Lombard Street
Russian Hill (near North Beach)
Lombard Street, or to be exact, the part of Lombard with the moniker
“crookedest street in the world,” begins at Hyde Street below Russian Hill.
This whimsical, flower-lined block attracts thousands of visitors each year.
If you intend to drive this red-brick street (it’s one-way, downhill, so take
the curves slowly), go early in the morning before everyone else revs up
their rentals. If you stop to take a picture from your car, you’ll be holding
up traffic and everyone will hate you. Better yet, walk down the stairs to
admire the flowers, the houses with their long-suffering tenants, and the
stellar view.
See map p. 164. Between Hyde and Leavenworth streets. Take the Powell-Hyde
cable-car line.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 177

Museum of the African Diaspora
SoMa
If you walk down 3rd Street toward Yerba Buena Center, you can’t fail to
notice the multi-story photo mosaic marking one of latest additions to the
South of Market culture klatch. MoAD packs quite a bit into its relatively
small exhibition space, and while it won’t take more than an hour to tour,
you’ll find much to think about. Photographs, video, and some very cool
interactive displays and technological touches focus upon the themes of
origins, movement, adaptation, and transformation in relation to Africa,
and thus, in relation to our own selves and communities. Take the kids.
See map p. 164. 685 Mission St. at 3rd Street. % 415-358-7200. www.moadsf.org.
Take any Muni streetcar to the Montgomery Street Station or the 15-Third, 
30-Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus. Admission: $8 adults, $5 seniors and students.
Open Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–6 p.m., until 9 p.m. Thurs.
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
SoMa
The handsome Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) houses an impressive col-
lection of 20th-century paintings, sculptures, and photographs. The beau-
tiful interior exudes a warmth that makes viewing the exhibits even more
enjoyable. Among the Diebenkorns and Rauschenbergs, you may be sur-
prised to see Jeff Koons’s gold-and-white sculpture of Michael Jackson and
his chimp pal, Bubbles (an acquisition I think better suited to a Las Vegas
hotel lobby, but obviously the curators know something I don’t). The
exhibits, the excellent museum cafe, and the artfully stocked museum
store keep you there for a good half-day.
See map p. 164. 151 Third St., 2 blocks south of Market near Howard Street. 
% 415-357-4000. www.sfmoma.org. Take any Muni streetcar to the Montgomery
Street Station or the 15-Third, 30-Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus. Admission: $13
adults, $8 seniors, and $7 students with ID; half-price Thurs 6–9 p.m.; free for kids
under 12; free to all first Tues of the month. Open: Thurs 11 a.m.–
8:45 p.m., Fri–Tues, 11 a.m.–5:45 p.m.; closed Wed and major holidays; open at 10 a.m.
during the summer.
Yerba Buena Gardens and Center for the Arts
SoMa
This 22-acre complex is a microdestination in a setting that once attracted
nothing but parking lots and derelicts. It includes a collection of galleries
showing a rotating exhibition of contemporary visual and performance art
by local artists, lovely gardens, a stage for dance troupes including ODC/
San Francisco and Smuin Ballets/SF, and a film/video theater. Interactive
amusements include an ice-skating rink, a bowling alley, a children’s
garden and carousel, and an arts/technology studio for older kids. An unre-
lated entertainment behemoth in a separate building across the street —
the Metreon — houses restaurants, retail shops, an IMAX theater, games,
and multiplex movie screens. If you take in all that Yerba Buena Center has

to offer, you can easily spend the entire day in this area. Parking is expen-
sive; use public transportation if possible.
East of the carousel you can find the enclosed, but light-filled, Yerba Buena
Ice-Skating Rink and the 12-lane Bowling Center (% 415-820-3532; www.
skatebowl.com). Public skating session times vary, so you should phone
before trekking over with your figure skates. Admission is adults $7, sen-
iors and children 12 and under $5.50. Skate rental is $3. The Bowling Center
is open Sunday through Thursday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., until midnight Friday
and Saturday. Admission for adults is $3.50 per game or $20 per hour;
evenings and weekend afternoons it’s $6 per game or $30 per hour.
Wednesdays from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m. is free skate-rental night for 18-plus.
Zeum (% 415-820-3320; www.zeum.org) is a wonderful art/technology
center with hands-on labs that give visitors the opportunity to create ani-
mated video shorts with clay figures; learn about graphics, sound, and
video production in the second-floor studio; and interact with the gallery
exhibits. The center is rare in that it’s the only attraction specifically
designed for older kids and teens that delivers some intellectual stimula-
tion and doesn’t rely on video games. Even your standard-issue bored ado-
lescent would find it difficult not to succumb to a Zeum offering. It’s open
Wednesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Tuesdays in the summer.
Admission is $8 for adults, $7 for seniors and students, $6 for kids 5 to 18.
See map p. 179. 701 Mission St., between Third and Fourth streets. % 415-749-2228
or 415-978-ARTS (box office). www.yerbabuenaarts.org. Take a streetcar to the
Powell or Montgomery Street station, or take the 14-Mission or 15-Third bus, among
others.
The Metreon
SoMa
Noisy and lit like a Vegas casino, the Metreon was once touted by Sony
corporation as the next big thing in entertainment. For some reason, no
doubt related to the profit motive, Sony changed its mind and sold the
place to shopping mall developers Westfield Group and Forest City
Enterprises early in 2006. While it’s unclear what exactly will change inside
the four stories of glass and brushed metal, eating and spending will surely
continue to be the big themes here along with the interactive game arena,
a favorite with the city’s teenagers and young adults. On the third floor are
15 movie screens and the city’s first IMAX theater.
See map p. 164. Mission at Fourth Street. % 800-METREON. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Just because you’ve visited the top sights doesn’t mean you’ve seen it
all. This section offers ideas on how to entertain children and teens, how
to get a taste of San Francisco history and more than a taste of art,
where to take your hiking shoes, where to grab a bike, and much more.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco

Especially for kids
San Francisco has enough family activities to exhaust even the most
energetic clan. Along with those I list in this section, consider an after-
noon at the ballpark (see “Especially for sports fans,” later in this chap-
ter), which has an exciting play area just for kids that’s open whether or
not the Giants are in town. The easy walk to Fort Point (see “Especially
for hikers,” later in this chapter) appeals to kids as well, because it takes
in the Golden Gate Bridge and there’s a cool Civil War–era fort to explore.
The best Web site for finding out what’s available for children is
GoCityKids (www.gocitykids.com). The calendar of events is kept up
to date and really mines what’s going on in and around the city.
The San Francisco Zoo, Sloat Boulevard and 45th Avenue (% 415-753-
7080; www.sfzoo.org), has been renovating like mad, ridding itself of
old-fashioned cages and exhibits, and embracing animal conservation.
You’ll find a new African Savanna exhibit and Lemur Forest, an innova-
tive, noteworthy primate center, an historic merry-go-round, an expanded
children’s petting zoo, and — this is the clincher — a sizable children’s
playground near the Sloat Boulevard entrance. Stroll the more than 65
acres to see the animals, and then park your tired body on a bench
within yelling distance and let the under-10 members of the family climb
to their heart’s content. Take note of the Carousel hot dog parlor across
Sloat Boulevard, marked by a fiberglass, chef-hatted dachshund. Formerly
one of many Doggie Diners in town, this puppy was the center of heated
controversy between those who wanted to grant it landmark status and
those who wanted it moved so the site could be turned into a parking
lot. Judging from its shiny cherry paint job, the doggy won. Zoo admis-
sion is $11 for adults, $8 for seniors and kids 12 to 15, $5 for kids 3 to 
11, free for babes 2 and under, and free the first Wednesday of each
month. The zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, take
the L-Taraval Muni streetcar.
Another kid-pleaser, the Musée Mécanique, Pier 45 at the end of Taylor
Street (% 415-346-2000; www.museemecanique.org), contains a fantas-
tic collection of lovingly restored and maintained mechanical marvels
that were the forerunners of pinball machines. Among the treasures, you
can try your hand at World Series Baseball, have your fortune told, and
giggle wildly with Laughing Sal, all for a quarter a pop. The museum is
housed close to PIER 39, having moved from smaller, more charming
quarters near the Cliff House. Admission is free, but bring along a roll of
quarters. The museum is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 
7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. To get there, take the
F-Market streetcar or the Powell-Mason cable car.
China Beach has picnic facilities and awe-inspiring views of the Golden
Gate Bridge. It’s also one of the few safe swimming beaches in town, but
the water is chilly, so designing sand castles and picnicking are better
activities. The 29-Sunset bus stops at 25th Avenue and El Camino del
Mar. From there, walk about 6 blocks north to the beach.

San Francisco has no shortage of parks and playgrounds in nearly every
neighborhood, but they do range in quality. In the Nob Hill/Russian Hill
area, Lafayette Park is appealing for its small but nicely equipped and
fenced-in playground, walking paths, and views. It’s on Clay Street
between Washington, Laguna, Gough, and Sacramento streets. Take 
the 1-California or 12-Folsom-Pacific buses to get there. You have to
make a little effort to reach Mountain Lake Park, which is close to the
Richmond District side of the Presidio on Lake Street (between 8th and
12th avenues), but this is one of the best parks in town for the entire
family. The playground is two-tiered; the street-level half is for the under-
6 set, while the bottom half is fun even for young-at-heart teens. Hiking
trails and a small beach make this spot even more attractive. To get
there, take Muni bus 1AX, 1BX, or 28–19th Avenue.
Young Performers Theatre (YPT) at Fort Mason presents children’s
plays most weekend afternoons, starring members of the YPT acting
classes. The performances are most suitable for kids 10 and under. You
can find a schedule of events on the Web (www.ypt.org). Tickets are $6

for kids and $9 for adults. Make reservations in advance by phoning YPT
at % 415-346-5550 or e-mail them at reservations@2ypt.com. The theater
is located in Room 300, Building C, at Fort Mason. To get there, take the
22-Fillmore, 30-Stockton, or 42-Downtown bus.
The temporary quarters for the California Academy of Sciences, 875
Howard St., between Fourth and Fifth streets (% 415-321-8000; www.
calacademy.org), are better than not having a substitute site for this
beloved organization, but they are pretty cramped. Nevertheless, young
kids should still enjoy an outing to this urban science center. There’s
still an aquarium for the penguins, fish, and frogs, Sssssnake Alley for
the boas and other slithery creatures, a two-story coral reef tank, a special
Nature Nest play area for preschoolers, and 500 square feet of exhibit
space for a variety of ants. A gift shop and a cafe are on the premises so
you can spend a good long morning here. If you only have time on this trip
to visit either the Exploratorium or the Academy of Sciences, until the
new building debuts sometime in 2008, I’d head for the Exploratorium.
Admission is $7 for adults; $4.50 for seniors, students, and kids 12 to 17;
$2 for kids 4 to 11, and free for kids 3 and under. The first Wednesday of
the month is free for all. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there,
from the Powell Street Muni station walk northeast on Market to Fourth
Street, turn right, and walk 2 blocks to Howard Street.
Especially for teens
The South of Market neighborhood works well as a teenage playground
encompassing Yerba Buena Gardens, the Metreon, and the many places
to shop. From here, it’s a quick walk to Market Street, where you can
catch the N-Judah Muni streetcar to the Haight-Ashbury. After your kids
have seen Haight Street, they’ve seen it all.
The Cartoon Art Museum, 655 Mission St., between Second and Third
streets (% 415-227-8666; www.cartoonart.org), takes the funny
papers seriously. Exhibits in the museum’s five galleries, a half-block
from Yerba Buena Gardens, trace the history of cartoon art from politi-
cal jabs to underground comics. Temporary shows highlight individual
artists such as Edward Gorey, and forms such as television cartoon ani-
mation. The museum shop has a sophisticated selection of books for
enthusiasts. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors and students, and
$2 for children 6 to 12. The first Tuesday of the month is “pay what you
wish day.” The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to
5 p.m. To get there, take any streetcar to the Montgomery Street station
and walk 1 block east to Mission Street.
San Francisco Centre, on the corner of Market and Fifth streets, is a
nine-story mall containing many familiar names beloved by teenaged
girls, including a huge Nordstrom department store. At the end of 2006,
it will be neighboring a 357,740-square-foot Bloomingdale’s (and that’s a
lot of hangers), anchor tenant at the humungous new mall consuming
the spot where the Emporium once ruled downtown. Your young shop-
per may be just as happy exploring the stores around Union Square (see
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 183

Chapter 12), and at least there you’ll get a little fresh air on your way in
and out of the revolving doors.
Teenagers adore the Metreon because the technology stores contain all
the latest widgets, some of which they can audition. When they tire of
gawking at stuff, the video games in the Airtight Garage can occupy as
many minutes as you’ll allow or that they can pay for. And when you’ve
had enough, you can coax them away from the flashing screens with
promises of food at one of the many cafes.
Zeum was designed for 8- to 18-year-olds and is staffed by savvy teens.
Even recalcitrant 15-year-olds can find something engaging to do here,
whether or not they admit it.
I saved the best for last. Take your teen to Haight Street for some shop-
ping (and shock) therapy. The N-Judah streetcar deposits you a few
blocks south of Haight, and it beats parking. One of the best music
stores in town, Amoeba Records, is here, and both the used and new
clothing stores — in particular stop by Villains, 1672 Haight St. (% 415-
626-5939) — stock the coolest stuff around. I don’t mean to make too
much of the street scene, but youthful runaways and poseurs do congre-
gate in this neighborhood and it can feel equally attractive, poignant,
and scary to adolescents. At the very least, you’ll have something inter-
esting to talk about on the ride back to your hotel.
Especially for history buffs
In this case, you’ll have to settle for fairly recent history, given that not a
whole lot was happening around here until the Gold Rush. The next
major event was the 1906 earthquake.
One of the historic sites related to the earthquake that you can visit is at
the corner of Market and Kearny streets: Lotta’s Fountain (given to the
city in 1875 by popular entertainer Lotta Crabtree). This gold-painted
landmark served as a community bulletin board where people left notes
for missing family and friends after the disaster.
To find out about San Francisco’s rise during the quest for gold, take the
free Gold Rush City walking tour offered by City Guides on Sundays at 
2 p.m. and Wednesdays at noon. Meet by the flower stand at Clay and
Montgomery streets. The walk encompasses Jackson Square (Jackson
and Montgomery streets), a National Historic Register Landmark
admired for its many restored Gold Rush–era brick warehouses. Call 
% 415-557-4266 for details.
The Cable Car Museum explains everything you’d want to know about
our 130-year-old road warriors, through photographs, models, actual
cable cars, and a close-up look at the mechanisms that make them click.
The museum is inside the cable-car barn, 1201 Mason St., at Washington
(% 415-474-1887; www.cablecarmuseum.com). Admission is free, and
the museum is open daily, April through September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
184

October through March until 5 p.m. To get there, take the Powell-Mason
or Powell-Hyde cable-car lines.
Mission Dolores, 16th and Dolores streets (% 415-621-8203), is a fine
example of Mission architecture and the oldest building in the city. This
is the sixth of the 21 missions founded under the auspices of Franciscan
Missionary Junipero Serra and built by Native Americans. Services were
first held on the site a few days before the Declaration of Independence
was signed. A $1 self-guided audio tour takes 40 minutes. Admission is
free, but donations are gratefully accepted; the mission is open daily from
9 a.m. until noon, and from 1 to 4 p.m. To get there, take the J-Church
streetcar, which stops 1 block east.
The Wells Fargo History Museum is located at 420 Montgomery St., at
California Street (% 415-396-2619; www.wellsfargohistory.com/
museums). Wells Fargo opened one of its first offices on this site in 1852,
ready to handle business generated by the Gold Rush. Among the dis-
plays are mining equipment, an antique stagecoach, and gold nuggets.
Be sure to try out the telegraph machine on the first floor, especially 
if you have kids in tow. The museum is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., and admission is free.
Especially for art lovers
The Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park between Clement Street and 34th
Avenue in the outer Richmond District (% 415-750-3600; www.thinker.
org), exhibits an impressive collection of paintings, drawings, decora-
tive arts, and one of the world’s finest collections of Rodin sculptures,
including an original cast of The Thinker. The grounds around the
Palace are a draw as well. Admission is $10 for adults, $7 for seniors
over 65, $6 for children 13 to 17, and free for children under 13, and free
on the first Tuesday of the month. The museum is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, take the 38-Geary
bus to 33rd Avenue, and then transfer to the 18–46th Avenue bus for a
ride to the museum entrance.
Union Square from Grant Avenue to Mason Street and Geary to Post
Street is home to a number of fine-arts dealers. Of note are the
Catharine Clark Gallery (% 415-399-1439) and Toomey Tourell 
(% 415-989-6444), both located in the canvas-rich building at 49 Geary
St., at Grant Street, as well as the John Berggruen Gallery at 228 Grant
St., between Sutter and Post (% 415-781-4629). The galleries are 
closed on Mondays.
First Thursdays is a somewhat new program sponsored by the San
Francisco Art Dealers Association to get people inside member galleries.
They open on the first Thursday of the month around Union Square,
serving wine and maybe a little cheese from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. For a list of
participating galleries, call % 415-921-1600.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 185

Combine a walk along the Marina with a tour of the galleries housed at
Fort Mason Center (% 415-441-3400; www.fortmason.org). They
include the Museo ItaloAmericano and SFMoMA’s Artists Gallery,
which displays original art for sale and for rent. The galleries are fairly
small but often have quirky exhibits. Wandering around Fort Mason is a
good way to round out your excursion. A small admission fee is charged
by the Museo ItaloAmericano, but the Artists Gallery is free. Open
Tuesday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. To get there, take
the 30-Stockton, 47–Van Ness, or 28–19th Avenue bus, which run nearby.
Especially for architecture lovers
When you visit the Alamo Square Historic District, you may feel a touch
of déjà vu. That’s because this is where the famous picture of the
Victorian row houses was photographed. The “painted ladies,” which
front the San Francisco skyline, are still sought by photographers, prob-
ably on a daily basis. You’ll find this historic block between Steiner,
Scott, Hayes, and Grove streets, west of the Civic Center. The 21-Hayes
bus takes you right there from Market and Hayes streets.
The Haas-Lilienthal House (% 415-441-3000), an 1886 Queen Anne
Victorian, is open to the public for one-hour tours on Wednesdays and
some Saturdays from noon to 3 p.m. and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Located at 2007 Franklin, at Jackson Street, this is the only local example
of a home from this period that’s open to the public. To get there by bus,
take the 12-Folsom, the 27-Bryant, the 42–Downtown Loop, the 47–Van
Ness, the 49–Van Ness/Mission, or the 83-Pacific. Admission is $8 for
adults and $5 for seniors 65 and older and for children under 12.
You may also want to check out the New Main Library, 100 Larkin St.
(% 415-557-4400), between Grove and Fulton streets. Natural light
streams in from a five-story atrium skylight and windows that encircle
the stacks. If you have kids along, browse the children’s section. The
library even has — gasp! — a gift shop. Take any Muni streetcar to the
Civic Center station and walk a block west on Grove Street.
While you’re in the Civic Center neighborhood, drop by the refurbished
City Hall on Van Ness Avenue, between McAllister and Grove streets.
The building debuted in 1915, but it’s never looked better. Not only did
the structure get a seismic retrofitting (de rigueur in this earthquake-
prone town) and a good cleaning, but the dome and ornamental balcony
railings were regilded, creating an impressive landmark and adding
golden highlights to the view. The rotunda is breathtakingly beautiful
and worth going through the metal detectors to view.
For more architectural wonders, check out the walking tours later in this
chapter.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
186

Especially for bicyclists
If your reflexes are good and you have a reliable helmet, try touring San
Francisco from the seat of a two-wheeler. You can rent bikes and helmets
from quite a few locations around town.
For a ride in beautiful Golden Gate Park, stop by one of the nearby bike
stores such as Avenue Cyclery, 756 Stanyan St. (% 415-387-3155) or
from inside the park at Wheel Fun at Stow Lake (% 415-668-6699). The
Bike Hut at South Beach, on the Embarcadero at Pier 40 (% 415-543-
4335), is the place to find high-quality bikes to pedal along the water-
front. It’s open everyday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rentals are a mighty rea-
sonable $5 per hour or $20 per day. And if you’re considering a bike 
trip across the Golden Gate Bridge, the nice guys at Blazing Saddles
(% 415-202-8888) at either the North Beach location (1095 Columbus
Ave.) or the Fisherman’s Wharf location (Pier 41) will provide you with
all the information and encouragement you need to tackle this route.
The equipment for kids and adults is shiny and well maintained. Rental
prices are $7 per hour or $28 per day and include helmets, locks, front
packs, rear racks, maps, and advice. Three-hour guided bike tours are
also available at $55 for adults and $40 for kids up to 12 years old. This
includes the ferry ticket to return to the city.
Pedaling across the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausalito, where you can
have something to eat, do a little sightseeing in this arty, touristy town,
and then return by ferry, can be good fun and in truth, you don’t really
need a chaperone. The Blue & Gold Fleet (% 415-705-5555; www.blue
andgoldfleet.com) and Golden Gate Ferry (% 415-923-2000) depart
the Sausalito ferry dock at least half a dozen times a day. Call for a
schedule. One-way Blue & Gold Fleet fares are $8.50 for adults and $4.50
for children 5 to 11; one-way Golden Gate Ferry fares are $6.45 for adults,
$3.20 for children 3 to 12 (kids ride free on weekends), and $3.20 for sen-
iors. The 9-mile ride to Sausalito can be challenging, partly due to the
windy conditions and partly due to the other bicyclists you’re compet-
ing with for space.
For more information on biking in the area, contact the San Francisco
Bicycle Coalition (% 415-431-BIKE), or browse their Web site at
www.sfbike.org.
Especially for hikers
A surprisingly good amount of hiking opportunities can be found within
the city, in the Presidio, along the bay, through Golden Gate Park, and
along the Pacific Coast. Committed hikers should head to the Marin
Headlands for the best trails and views. Muni runs a bus (76–Marin
Headlands) from downtown to the Headlands parking lot on Sundays and
holidays. Check www.sfmuni.com for a schedule and route information.

Angel Island, a federal and state wildlife refuge that is the largest of San
Francisco Bay’s three islets, is 8 miles from San Francisco and is accessi-
ble only by ferry (a 20-minute journey) or private boat. Plan to spend the
entire day on the island if you decide to go during the week — the ferry
departs San Francisco sometime after 10 a.m., and the only return trip
departs sometime after 3 p.m. (The schedule changes seasonally.) On
the weekends, you have the choice of four return trips. You can bring a
picnic or get something at the small store and cafe that operate near the
dock. Check out the beautiful 12 miles of hiking trails, climb up Mt.
Livermore for yet another spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge, or
take the one-hour tram tour past the historic sites, including the former
immigration station. Mountain-bike rentals are also available on Angel
Island, but only during the spring and summer months. Call Blue & Gold
Ferry (% 415-705-8200) for a current ferry schedule. Round-trip fares
are $15 for adults and $8.50 for children 6 to 12. For recorded informa-
tion about the island, call % 415-435-1915. Ferries leave from Pier 41 in
Fisherman’s Wharf.

Crissy Field (% 415-561-7690 general information or 415-561-7752 for
weekend workshops and classes; www.crissyfield.org), the Bay
Area’s newest national park, is comprised of 100 acres between the bay
and the Presidio. The park features a tidal marsh, sheltered picnic area,
bike path, walking trail, cafe, bookstore, and education center. It’s a
beautiful spot; an easy, flat walk; and wheelchair accessible. Begin with a
visit at the Crissy Field Center and ask for an activity book for a self-
guided walk or join one of the interpretive hikes offered most weekends.
Stop at the Warming Hut at the western end of the park by the fishing
pier for a snack and some inspired gift shopping. Foodies will be suitably
impressed to discover that the cafe menu was developed with input
from Alice Waters, of Chez Panisse fame. The 28–19th Avenue, 29-Sunset,
and 43-Masonic buses stop nearby.
Fort Point (% 415-556-1693), which dates from 1857, lies under the
Golden Gate Bridge at the tip of the peninsula. Along with Civil War–era
cannons, you can see surfers who appear to be risking their lives much
more than the soldiers once stationed here did. From the Hyde Street

Pier, take the easy 31⁄2-mile stroll along the paved Golden Gate Promenade,
which hugs the coast as it passes through the Marina Green and Crissy
Fields. Or take the 28–19th Avenue or 29-Sunset bus to the Golden Gate
Bridge and climb down from the viewing area to a short trail leading to
the premises. You can take a self-guided audio tour of the fort if you like,
then backtrack to the Hyde Street cable-car turnaround, where you can
hop on a cable car to Union Square. Fort Point is usually open Friday
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but phone first to check.
If you’re a hiking novice or walking with kids, the Coastal Trail to the
Cliff House probably isn’t the hike for you. It’s rigorous and can be dan-
gerous. The trailhead, a bit east of Fort Point, is well marked. Heading
south, the trail parallels the Pacific Ocean through the Presidio.
You can see small beaches below the trail on this hike, but if you’re
tempted to feel sand beneath your toes, follow the marked paths to get
there. Don’t climb over any rocky cliffs; the land here isn’t stable enough
to guarantee your safe return.
When you reach Baker Beach, about 11⁄2 miles from Fort Point, be pre-
pared for the nude sun worshippers, if there is any sun. As you continue
on the trail, you’ll pass the Lobos Creek Water Treatment Plant. From
there it’s a short way to El Camino Del Mar, a street leading through Sea
Cliff, a fancy residential neighborhood. At the end of El Camino Del Mar,
you’ll pick up the trail near the Lincoln Golf Course. If you continue
along this trail, with the land and the views rewarding your every step,
eventually you’ll arrive at the Cliff House, which has been serving
refreshments to visitors since 1863. It’s undergone a pretty dramatic 
renovation and now has one casual and one fancier restaurant plus a
bar, all with the views that keep tourists as well as locals enthralled.
Prices are high so keep walking down the Great Highway until you reach
the Beach Chalet restaurant and brewery (% 415-386-8439). After lunch

A short history of Angel Island
Originally a Miwok Indian hunting and fishing ground, Spanish, British, and Mexican
ships harbored at various times at Angel Island beginning in 1775. Before the Civil War,
the U.S. government turned the island into a military base, remnants of which are still
visible. Between 1910 and 1940, Angel Island was used as a detention center mainly
for Asian immigrants, which earned it the nickname “Ellis Island of the West.” The
immigration station at China Cove is open for tours and provides a poignant glimpse
into an era when anti-Asian and anti-immigration policies placed hundreds of Chinese
into forced detention for weeks, months, and sometimes years. Poems carved into the
walls of the barracks by lonely and isolated detainees were rediscovered in 1970 and
inspired the ongoing preservation effort by the California legislature.

you can return toward the Cliff House and catch the 38-Geary bus at La
Playa and Balboa Street, or continue to Judah Street and take an N-Judah
streetcar downtown.
Named in honor of Sierra Club founder and conservationist John Muir,
553-acre Muir Woods is what’s left locally of the redwood forests that
once dominated the coast of Northern California. Although not as siz-
able as Redwood National Forest further north, these old-growth red-
woods are beautiful, and a range of trails suits hikers of all levels. From
the Golden Gate Bridge, take the Stinson Beach/Highway 1 exit west and
follow the signs. Parking is limited, so set out early in the day on week-
ends or go during the week. Muir Woods Park is open from 8 a.m. until
sunset. For additional information call % 415-388-2595.
Especially for sports fans
The San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball team opened the fabu-
lous, 40,000-seat AT&T (formerly Pac Bell, formerly SBC) Park stadium
on the bay in April 2000. The ballpark is sweet — sightlines are clear,
you don’t freeze to death like you did at Candlestick, the food is pretty
good, and home runs splash into the bay. Season-ticket holders have
bought up all the best seats, but buying bleacher tickets to any but the
most sought-after games (Giants versus Dodgers contests, for example)
shouldn’t be impossible, because they’re sold only on game days. To
purchase regular tickets or tickets from season-ticket holders unable to
make it to a particular game, log on to the Web site (www.sfgiants.com)
before you arrive, or call % 877-473-4849 to charge tickets by phone.
Transportation to the ballpark is simple — take Muni to the Embarcadero
Station and transfer to the King Street extension. In or out of season, 
the stadium is open for 75-minute tours everyday but game days at 
10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Admission is $10 adults, $8 seniors, and $6 kids
12 and under.
The San Francisco 49ers play at 3Com Park. Home games have been
sold out for years, but if you want to try your luck, the ticket office
number is % 415-656-4900. Scalpers sell tickets outside the park, but
these are often counterfeit. The best method of transport to the park is
by Muni bus. The 9X–San Bruno Express bus leaves from Sutter Street
near Union Square; the 28X–19th Avenue bus runs along 19th Avenue;
and the 47X–Van Ness cruises Van Ness Avenue.
You can also head across the bay to watch Oakland’s professional teams
play. For information on schedules and availability, and to order tickets,
visit the sites listed in the “Checking out sports on the Web” sidebar.
Getting seats to home games isn’t impossible, but you have to use some
creativity. A terrific source for last-minute concert and sports tickets (as
well as lots of other things) is the Web site www.craigslist.org. Craig
Newmark, an actual person who lives in San Francisco, created this Web
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 191

site in 1995, and it quickly became a community asset. Craigslist is now
nationwide, and it’s free to use.
Golfers have a great selection of public courses on which to play, includ-
ing gorgeous (and inexpensive) Lincoln Park (% 415-221-9911), the
newly redesigned Harding Park (% 415-664-4690; www.harding-park.
com), and the Presidio Golf Course (% 415-561-4661; www.presidio
golf.com). The links in the Presidio only opened to the public in 1995,
although the 18-hole, par-72 course was originally built in 1895. Both
Harding Park and the Presidio have restaurants and pro shops, and
there’s a putting green at the Presidio.
Seeking Some Spiritual Pursuits
San Franciscans aren’t merely a hedonistic group of left-wing free-
thinkers, despite what you may have heard. As a matter of fact, most
pray on a daily basis. Sometimes they pray for a parking space, but
mostly they thank God that they live in San Francisco.
Arrive a good half-hour early to claim a seat at the 9 a.m. Sunday serv-
ices (an hour early for the 11 a.m. services) at Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church, 330 Ellis St. (% 415-674-6000). The Reverend Cecil
Williams, a genuinely great man, lets the multiethnic gospel choir do
most of the sermonizing, and they’re wildly effective. A cross-section of
friendly San Franciscans packs the pews, clapping, singing, and celebrat-
ing. It’s church, it’s theater, and it’s amazing.
Grace Cathedral, the magnificent Episcopal Church at the top of Nob
Hill, 1100 California St., between Taylor and Jones streets (% 415-749-
6300), has an outdoor stone terrazzo labyrinth that may promote a

Checking out sports on the Web
In addition to the following specific sites, where (in most cases) you can purchase

meditative moment. It’s open to visitors daily, anytime. You can rent a
labyrinth audio tour, complete with walking music provided by the
Grace Choir, at the gift shop.
Old First Presbyterian Church, 1751 Sacramento St., at Van Ness
Avenue (% 415-474-1608), sponsors a concert series leaning heavily
toward the classical that’s low cost and high quality. You can call for a
list of upcoming events or check the Internet (www.oldfirstconcerts.
org). Getting from downtown to the church is a snap on the California
Street cable-car line.
Completed in 1970, St. Mary’s Cathedral, 1111 Gough St., between Ellis
and Geary (% 415-567-2020), is worth a look for its modern architecture
and soaring interior space. Inside, be sure to lift your eyes toward
heaven to admire the cross-shaped skylight.
Going for Garden and Park Respites
San Franciscans cherish the city’s open spaces. If you know where to
look, you’ll find little parks and secret gardens in some unlikely places.
At the end of Market Street in the Embarcadero, two simple gardens
grace the seventh floor of One Market Plaza. Elevators to the gardens
are situated in the Spear and Steuart Street lobbies. Upon exiting, walk
toward the bay; you’ll find two patios surrounded by well-tended
expanses of lawn and flowers overlooking a classic bay view.
At Rincon Center (corner of Mission and Steuart streets) you’ll find a
courtyard garden with benches sitting among a generous array of orna-
mental hedges, azaleas, and seasonal plantings. You can get a snack
inside and enjoy it in the garden. A few blocks away, at 100 First St.,
you’ll find the award-winning second-floor garden in the Delta Tower,
which is a lush respite from the madness of the Transbay Terminal and
Mission Street. The black granite and green glass fountain sculpture pro-
vide a soothing counterpoint to the street traffic. Yerba Buena Gardens
features willow trees, a sweep of bright-green lawn, and a variety of blos-
soms. Behind the garden’s 22-foot waterfall is a memorial to Martin
Luther King, Jr., featuring a series of glass panels etched with quotations
from Dr. King’s speeches and writings.
Levi’s Plaza, between the Embarcadero and Sansome Street, consists of
the company’s multiple buildings and two plazas separated by Battery
Street. The centerpiece of the hard plaza is a fountain you can walk
through on paving stones — a big favorite with kids. The soft plaza
across the street is really a park with fir trees and grass. The company
displays letters and products in a visitor center at 1155 Battery St., open
weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 193

Cross the plaza to Sansome Street and look for the bottom of the Filbert
Steps, a steep staircase that rises to Montgomery and Filbert streets.
Around the midpoint of the stairway you’ll find a sight so profoundly San
Francisco that you’ll immediately understand what all the fuss is about.
This is the Grace Marchand Garden; its roses and ferns add a wild elegance
to the hillside. The residents don’t like the tourists who clog the steps,
especially on weekends, but that’s the price they have to pay for living
next to a minor landmark. In any case, this is a garden to admire from
outside the wooden fence only.
Seeing San Francisco by Guided Tour
I used to feel self-conscious about taking a guided tour in a new city.
Many travelers, myself included, shy away from the idea of being herded
on and off large buses like curious sheep. But I’ve finally embraced my
inner tourist and learned to appreciate organized outings. Actually,
guided tours are a sensible way to get your bearings in an unfamiliar
place. You may not have much time to explore on your own and just
want to catch the major sights in one day. Or perhaps you have difficulty
getting around, or you don’t want to drive. Maybe you need an overview
to find out what interests you in San Francisco, or you’re traveling alone
and want some company.
Fortunately, you can find almost as many varieties of guided tours as
there are varieties of people in San Francisco. Not all of them have you
peering out a dirty bus window at some landmark while straining to hear
the muffled voice of your guide over the microphone, or worse, an out-
of-date tape. In San Francisco, guided tours happen on foot and ferry
boats as well as on buses and even zebra-striped Land Rovers. And they
cover special interests, as well as the major sights. If you think a tour
listed in this chapter is for you, call the companies or individual guides
for their brochures, or ask your hotel to send you information. Most
tours require advance reservations.
Hotels generally have preferred companies that they recommend for bus
tours. The hotel often gets a small kickback for every reservation, so it
may not have your best interests in mind. If you favor one tour company
over another, book it yourself or request that company specifically when
you speak to the concierge. Don’t leave the decision up to the hotel.
The bus stops here: Touring on wheels
If you want to be sure you at least catch a glimpse of San Francisco’s
major attractions, orientation tours may be just the ticket. Some tour
operators spiff up the menu with motorized cable cars or double-decker
buses, whereas other companies use lower-profile minibuses that appeal
to visitors who don’t want to stand out in a crowd.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
194

Be advised that not all trips are narrated by the bus driver; some just
have recorded commentary. I don’t recommend these audio tours. The
sound quality is miserable, and some of the information is outdated,
such as the part about the prices of the houses you pass on the tour. As
a matter of fact, I think prices went up another 10 percent since you’ve
been reading this book. Be sure to ask whether the commentary is
recorded or live before you book your tour.
Gray Line Tours (% 415-434-8687; www.sanfranciscosightseeing.
com), the big kahuna of the tour industry, schedules a number of orienta-
tion tours around the city and beyond in red double-decker buses,
motorized cable cars, and smaller vans. The deluxe three-and-a-half-hour
city tour ($44 for adults, $30 for children 5–11) hits the highlights —
Twin Peaks, Mission Dolores, the Cliff House, Golden Gate Park, the
Golden Gate Bridge — and there’s an option to tack on a trip to Alcatraz.
Tower Tours (% 415-345-8687; www.towertours.net) is popular with
many San Franciscans with visiting relatives because the company uses
sleek minibuses that carry only about two dozen people. Tower’s three-
and-a-half-hour city tour stops at the same sites as Gray Line’s buses.
The cost is $37 for adults and $18 for children 5 to 11.
Fire Engine Tours (% 415-333-7077; www.fireenginetours.com) are
not for people who want to avoid attention, but go ahead and suspend
your dignity for an hour and 15 minutes while heading for a ride across
the Golden Gate Bridge. Tour guide Marilyn Katzman, a tap dancer and
former child actress, only quits talking, singing, and leading cheers when
required by law. As the shiny 1955 Mack Fire Truck drives past various
sights — the Octagon House, the Presidio Pet Cemetery, Union Street —
Marilyn tosses out historical facts and figures mostly relating to fires
and the nice folks who put them out. Although this tour doesn’t include
a good part of the city, you will see the famous skyline from a vantage
point across the bridge and have an extremely fun time. Pick up the tour
outside The Cannery on Beach Street. Tickets are $35 for adults, $30 for
seniors and teens, and $25 for kids 12 and under. Reservations are
advised. Tours run Wednesday through Monday at 1 p.m., unless it rains.
Phone for a schedule.
The Urban Safari (% 415-282-5555 or 1-866-MYSAFARI; www.theurban
safari.com), under the guidance of überguide and Land Rover aficionado
Daniel Oppenheim, can mimic a somewhat conventional city tour or
completely devolve into a freewheeling, wacky adventure. Basically,
Bwana Daniel is up for anything, and he’ll mine every ounce of his imagi-
nation to design a minimum four-hour outing to your specifications,
exact or inexact. Throw him a theme and he’ll come back with a plan, or
choose from a menu of ideas on his Web site. Pith helmets, animal 
crackers, and leopard print fleece blankets provide additional ambiance.
Prices, which include a meal, lots of extras, and hotel pickup, are $100
per person for groups of four and $75 for each additional person in the
same group.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 195

Doing it yourself (and saving money) on Muni
Stopping at every other corner and having a driver who doesn’t give
much, if any, commentary may not seem like the ideal let’s-get-to-know-
the-city excursion. But a do-it-yourself tour by Muni bus has its advan-
tages. The outing will only cost you a few dollars and no more than 
three transit hours. They let you come and go at your leisure — if you
decide 25 minutes at Golden Gate Park isn’t enough, who cares if the bus
leaves? You can always catch the next one. These “orientation” tours are
not for anyone who requires a great deal of comfort, however — city
buses are, after all, creaky and well worn.
Ask for a free transfer when you board the bus. With the transfer, you
can disembark whenever you like and catch another bus or a Muni
streetcar at no additional charge (within 90 minutes). Transfers are not
valid on cable cars, however.
The latest and greatest DIY driving tour comes in the form of three-
wheeler, two-passenger Trigger Scooter cars fitted with global position-
ing systems and a 45-minute audio component that doubles as a tour
guide. The cars are a hoot to drive but are strictly for use in the city —
for safety considerations you can’t take them over the bridges. Rent a
Trigger through GoCar Rentals (% 800-914-6227 or 415-441-5695;
www.gocarsf.com) for $44 the first hour, $34 for the second, and $24
per hour after that up to five hours, with a maximum daily charge of
$150. The company has two locations (you can pick-up and drop-off at
either), 321 Mason St., at O’ Farrell near Union Square open 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. daily, and at 2715 Hyde St., at Beach Street near the cable-car turn-
around. That one is open daily from 8 a.m. to dusk.
Muni tour #1: Painted ladies and Pacific Heights
Here’s a tour that introduces you to a section of the city that encom-
passes the famous Victorians on Alamo Square, Japantown, Fillmore
Street shopping in Pacific Heights, the Marina, and Chinatown. Board the
21-Hayes bus at Market and Powell streets (and remember to ask for a
transfer). Exit on Steiner Street, at one side of Alamo Square. When
you’ve gotten your fill of the painted ladies, walk 1 block east to Fillmore
Street and look for the 22-Fillmore. That bus runs toward the bay
through Japantown and continues up toward Pacific Heights. All kinds of
shops line Fillmore Street, and they become swankier as you pass
California Street. The bus eventually crosses Union Street and ambles
through the Marina District. Exit as close to Chestnut Street as possible,
where you can catch the 30-Stockton. See the following tour for a
description of your travels on this bus back to Union Square. If you don’t
stop for breaks (which sort of defeats the purpose), expect to spend two
hours on this route.
Muni tour #2: Traveling on the west side
Another do-it-yourself tour takes you around the western perimeter of
the city. From any downtown Muni station (Powell Street is closest to
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
196

Union Square), catch the L-Taraval or N-Judah streetcar, each of which
travels through some well-kept residential neighborhoods. Get off at
Sunset Boulevard in the outer Sunset District. On Sunset Boulevard, at
Taraval Street or Judah Street, depending on which streetcar you rode,
pick up a 29-Sunset bus going to the Presidio (not to California and 25th
Avenue, which doesn’t enter the former military base). The spectacular
views on this part of the ride include the Pacific Ocean and the Golden
Gate Bridge. In fact, the bus stops by a viewing area where you can get
off the bus and walk across the bridge and back if that’s on your to-do
list. The ride also includes a look at a pet cemetery inside the Presidio.
The 29-Sunset terminates at Letterman Hospital in the Presidio, but you
can then catch the 43-Masonic bus from the same bus shelter, which
takes you down Lombard Street and over to Chestnut Street in the
Marina district. From there, the 30-Stockton meanders along Chestnut
over to Van Ness Avenue, and then travels down Van Ness to North Point
Street, close to Aquatic Park and Ghirardelli Square. The route then goes
through North Beach and Chinatown, then back to Union Square.
Alternatively, you can walk to PIER 39 and catch the F-Market streetcar
for a ride down the Embarcadero and up Market Street. Allow three
hours without breaks.
Two if by sea: Touring by boat
Boat cruises provide a view of the city from an unusual vantage point
and are the only way to experience the bay in all its glory. You have
quite a few options for riding the waves of the bay, one of which is the
commuter ferries. Ferries pick up passengers from Fisherman’s Wharf
(Pier 41) and the Ferry Building.
The Blue & Gold Fleet (% 415-705-5555; www.blueandgoldfleet.com)
operates ferries to and from Marin County. This is also the only com-
pany that will take you to Alcatraz Island. Blue & Gold’s one-hour bay
cruise ($20 for adults, $16 for seniors and kids 12–18, $12 for kids 5–11)
sails under the Golden Gate Bridge; past Sausalito, Angel Island, and
Alcatraz; and then back to Fisherman’s Wharf. This tour will be a satisfying,
if brief, encounter with the bay. Check the Web site for discounts on tickets.
You want something a little more exciting than a ferry? Try sailing on
The Ruby (% 415-861-2165; www.rubysailing.com). This 60-foot steel
sloop, which holds about 30 passengers, skims the white caps in the bay
daily with a lunch cruise from 12:30 to 3 p.m. and an early-evening sail
with hors d’oeuvres from 6 to 8:30 p.m. The cost is $35 per person
(including food); beer and wine are available at an additional cost. Kids
under 10 are $20. Reservations are necessary. The Ruby is docked by
The Ramp at the foot of Mariposa Street at Third Street. The 22-Fillmore
or 15-Kearny bus drops you off a block away.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 197

Hornblower Dining Yachts (% 888-467-6256; www.hornblower.com)
let you sup as you sail, offering dinner and weekend brunch cruises
around the bay. Cruises last from one and a half hours for brunch to
three hours for the nightly dinner/dance. The food is hotel-like, but this
is a festive way to dine — surrounded by superb views. Dinner rates per
person are $84 Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday, $99 Friday, $103
Saturday. Saturday- and Sunday-brunch cruises cost $59. Kids are half-
price. Reservations are required.
The bright yellow amphibious vehicles you may see bouncing around
bayside neighborhoods belong to Bay Quackers San Francisco Duck
Tours (% 415-431-3825; www.bayquackers.com). Their 80-minute tours
leave every two hours beginning at 9 a.m. from the Anchorage Mall at
Fisherman’s Wharf and end up in the bay motoring around McCovey
Cove. If you time it right, you could enjoy an unusual view of a Giants’
baseball game. It’s most definitely an entertaining ride and the water
portion lasts just long enough to see the views but not get bored.
Tickets are $35 adults, $32 seniors/students, $25 kids under 13. $100
buys a family ticket for two adults and two children.
Taking a walk on the wild side: Walking tours
Friends of the Library sponsor City Guides walking tours (% 415-557-
4266; www.sfcityguides.org). You may choose from 26 different
tours, all for free! All you have to do is pick the tour that interests you
and show up at the proper corner on time. You can get an insider’s view
of Chinatown, admire San Francisco’s collection of beautifully restored
Victorian homes on the Landmark Victorians of Alamo Square tour, or
explore the haunts of the original 49ers on the Gold Rush City walk.
Tours run about two hours on average. Highly recommended!
The Victorian Home Walk (% 415-252-9485; www.victorianwalk.com)
combines a trolley-car excursion with a walking tour through a number
of celebrated neighborhoods. During the two-and-a-half-hour tour, you
see an array of houses in areas where tour vans are prohibited from
entering. The guide promises the walk isn’t strenuous. The cost is $20.
Tours leave daily at 11 a.m. from the lobby of the Westin St. Francis, 
335 Powell St., between Geary and Post streets in the Union Square
neighborhood.
San Francisco Architectural Heritage conducts a Pacific Heights walk
(% 415-441-3000 for reservations) on Sundays at 12:30 p.m. beginning
at the Haas-Lilienthal house. The two-hour tour through this swanky
neighborhood costs just $8 for adults and $5 for seniors and children
under 12.
HobNob Tours (% 866-851-1123; www.hobnobtours.com) gives you the
lowdown on Nob Hill while pointing out the highlights of one of the city’s
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
198

more significant ’hoods. Sure, the gossip and scandal provided is on the
historic side, but it’s still fascinating. The two-hour tours leave from 
the Fairmont Hotel lobby weekdays at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. for $30 per
person.
Eating your way through San Francisco
Shirley Fong-Torres, a local writer and personality, has been operating
Chinatown food tours for 20 years. The three-and-a-half-hour walk man-
ages to demystify the exotic rather irreverently. It includes running com-
mentary about the history of this fascinating neighborhood and stops at
an artist’s studio, a one-room temple, a market, an herbal shop, and a
tea company, where you’re treated to a tasting. Shirley’s company, Wok
Wiz Chinatown Walking Tours & Cooking Center, 654 Commercial St.,
between Kearny and Montgomery streets (% 415-981-8989; www.
wokwiz.com), schedules the tours daily at 10 a.m. They cost $40 for
adults and $35 for kids under 11 (dim sum lunch included).
The popular North Beach neighborhood reaches new heights of giddi-
ness on Saturdays when food writer GraceAnn Walden (www.graceann
walden.net) leads Mangia! North Beach, a four-and-a-half-hour, $80
walking, eating, shopping, and history tour. GraceAnn and her followers
traipse in and out of a deli, a chocolate shop, a bakery, bookshop, pot-
tery store, and two churches, before ending with a multi-course family-
style lunch at one of her favorite restaurants. Lots of samples, lots of
tidbits about the Italians, and lots of fun. Call % 415-925-9013 to 
make reservations. If you’re interested in Latin culture, inquire about
GraceAnn’s Latino Mission Tour and Mural Walk ($85), which includes
lunch at a Nuevo Latino restaurant.
Seeking out special-interest tours
Learn all there is to know about gay and lesbian history from the Gold
Rush to the present day while Cruisin’ the Castro (% 415-255-1821;
www.cruisinthecastro.com). Tours meet at the rainbow flag on the
corner of Market and Castro streets, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 10
a.m. Reservations are necessary. The cost, which includes lunch, is $45
adults and $35 kids 3 to 12.
The Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center, 2981 24th St., near Harrison Street
(% 415-285-2287; www.precitaeyes.org), a not-for-profit arts center,
features more than 75 murals on the Mission District walking tours that
it sponsors (including the very colorful Balmy Alley). The 6-block walk
departs Saturdays and Sundays at 1:30 p.m. from the center itself. The
cost is $12 for adults, $5 for seniors, and $2 for children under 12. A
slightly different walk leaves from Café Venice, 3325 24th St., near the
24th Street BART station, on Saturdays at 11 a.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering San Francisco’s Best Attractions 199

Someday, no one’s gonna care where Janis Joplin or members of The
Grateful Dead crashed back in the day, but while you still have your
memories (or memory, as the case may be) check it out on the Haight-
Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour (% 415-863-1621). The two-hour
walk — a combination of hippy lore and Victorian appreciation — is
offered at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays for a mere $15 per
walker. If you have your own group of at least four, you can inquire 
about alternate days and times.
An easy way to explore the redwood groves of Muir Woods (see
“Especially for hikers,” earlier in this chapter) is with Sierra Club guide
Tom Martell, of Tom’s Scenic Trailwalking (% 415-381-5106). He’ll pick
you up (and drop you off) at your hotel, provide a picnic lunch, and
drive up to six adventurers to the lovely redwoods just beyond the
Golden Gate Bridge for a 2- to 4-mile hike. Cost for the three-and-a-half-
hour walk with lunch is $50.

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Locating San Francisco’s big-name shops and specialty boutiques
 Discovering the main shopping neighborhoods
 Hunting down bargains
A
lthough most people think of Union Square as the hub of San
Francisco shopping — and for good reasons — the downtown area
has plenty of competition. Nearly every San Francisco neighborhood
boasts a thriving “Main Street” of locally owned boutiques, cafes, and
bookstores. You can find retailers with unique arts and crafts, clothing
stores that eschew chain-mentality fashion, even housewares havens
that reflect the style of the local clientele. Shopping in San Francisco is
never mundane. Depending on where you head, you can try on a differ-
ent attitude as easily as a different outfit.
Surveying the Scene
If you know where to look, you can do some very interesting shopping
around here. Oh, plenty of people complain about the city being
Starbucked and Gapped to death, but they aren’t looking beyond the
obvious retail centers. Not all the entrepreneurs in San Francisco are
franchisees or part of some conglomerate — some are actually opening
boutiques with a personal stamp. In particular, check out Valencia Street
for postmodern streetwear and décor; Hayes Street for shoes, clothing,
and mod furnishings; Sacramento Street for contemporary clothing,
antiques, and kids’ clothes and furnishings; upper Grant Street for local
designers; upper Polk Street for home furnishing and decoration design
trends; and Haight Street for vintage, mod, and skateboarding gear.
You’ll find that stores are generally open Monday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 5 p.m., even on many holi-
days. Shops around Fisherman’s Wharf tend to stay open later, as do
most department stores.
Sales tax in San Francisco is 8.5 percent, and the salesperson will add it at
the register for all goods. You don’t have to pay the sales tax if the store
ships something out of state for you, but shipping can cost as much as or
more than the tax, unless you’re purchasing a very expensive item.

Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 203

The worldwide chain-store invasion has not, unfortunately, passed San
Francisco by. In fact, we accept the blame for the Gap frenzy — the head-
quarters is near the Embarcadero — and if you see a Pottery Barn or a
Gymboree in your midst, well, those companies originated in the Bay
Area, as well. But you can find plenty of unique emporiums that will
bring some excitement to the chase. Here’s a short list of great places.
Checking Out the Big Names
Gump’s, in Union Square at 135 Post St., between Kearny Street and
Grant Avenue (% 415-982-1616; www.gumps.com), is famous for its
Asian antiques, silver, and china, as well as for longevity — it’s been in
business since 1861. Anyone who receives a gift from Gump’s will
shower impressed thanks on the giver because of the name itself. It’s
open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday, noon
to 5 p.m.
Looking for the perfect place for one-stop shopping? Then head over to
Macy’s West on Union Square, at Stockton and O’Farrell streets (% 415-
954-6271). At 700,000 square feet, this eight-story, glass-fronted fashion
behemoth is bigger than some towns. It’s open Monday and Wednesday
10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
9 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The Original Levi’s Store, 300 Post St. (% 415-501-0100), is a showcase
for more than 501s — you’ll see some wild designs stitched onto jackets
and jeans. One corner of this three-story monument to denim is dedi-
cated to alterations, in case your shrink-to-fits still need a tuck here and
there. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday
11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The brandacious Apple Store on the corner of Stockton and Ellis streets
(% 415-392-0202) schedules a roster of workshops for current and
future Mac users and has Internet access on the premises. Between this
place, the Virgin Megastore across the street, and Niketown a few blocks
north on Post Street, you could lose your average teen for a few hours.
It’s open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday from 
11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Bell’occhio, 8 Brady Alley, off Market Street between 12th and Gough
streets (% 415-864-4048), has long been a favorite with decorators,
wedding planners, and sophisticated shoppers searching for elusive bits
of European flavor. Hidden in an alley off Market Street, this bewitching
little shop stocks cunning decorations, French ribbons, Mariage Frères
tea, imported face powder, and odd finds the owner discovers on her
travels. To get there, take the F-Market streetcar to Civic Center. It’s
open Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Polanco, a bright gallery featuring crafts and artwork from Mexico, is
located at 393 Hayes St. (% 415-252-5753). This block in Hayes Valley
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
204

also has a few terrific clothing and home-décor shops, so if you’re in the
neighborhood, it’s worth a side trip. The gallery is open Monday through
Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 6 p.m.
Dandelion, 55 Potrero Ave., at Alameda (% 415-436-9500), isn’t a store
you’ll find by accident. You have to have heard about this place from a
devoted customer, with its out-of-the-way location close to the Design
Center south of Market Street. The owners seem to be magnets for beau-
tiful objects. Their prices are very fair, their taste impeccable. The 9–San
Bruno bus from Market and Ninth streets can take you right here. It’s
open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Famed San Francisco
Chronicle journalist Herb Caen’s favorite clothing store, Wilkes
Bashford, 375 Sutter St., between Stockton Street and Grant Avenue,
near Union Square (% 415-986-4380), was often mentioned in his
columns. And San Francisco’s natty former mayor, Willie Brown, pur-
chases his Brioni suits here. The store sells sophisticated clothing for
women as well. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., 
and Thursday to 8 p.m.
For CDs, vinyl (remember that?), and an in-depth selection of previously
owned music, the cognoscenti shop at Amoeba Records, 1855 Haight St.
(% 415-831-1200), in the musically famous neighborhood of the same
name. Open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
When those cognoscenti stroll down Haight Street, they often wear
really cool clothes from Rolo, a locally grown retailer with six stores
around town. The flagship store, which carries streetwear for both men
and women, is south of Market at 1235 Howard St. (% 415-431-4545).
It’s open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday
11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Market Street continues its upward trajectory (at least from 5th Street
toward the Bay) with the opening of the humungous Bloomingdale’s,
centerpiece of the new Westfield San Francisco Centre next to the older
one (where Nordstrom is located) on 5th and Market streets. Along with
all the usual suspects one expects to find in an upscale mall, this one
also has a day spa on the 5th floor, a gourmet grocer in the basement,
movie theaters, and dining establishments with good pedigrees includ-
ing Out the Door, a take-away from the Slanted Door family.
Going to Market
Farmers’ market aficionados will find Saturdays at the Ferry Building at
the foot of Market Street more than satisfying. The majority of producers
bring organically grown foodstuffs, and you’ll discover unusual varieties
of fruits and vegetables including heirloom tomatoes in season. The per-
fume of the salt air, ripe fruit, and a whiff of lavender wafting past your
nostrils are deeply pleasurable; combined with the bay views, a busker
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 205

playing standards on his saxophone, and a plethora of tastes, the scene
is magical. Inside the building, permanent shops, most of which are open
seven days a week, stock everything you’d need for a feast plus all kinds
of tempting items including books, chocolates, olive oil, kitchen necessi-
ties, wine, and imported packaged foods. If you find yourself hungry, this
is where the Slanted Door has moved (see Chapter 10) or you can sit
down at the MarketBar on the east end, visit Taylor’s Refreshers for fast
food I heartily approve of, or attempt to get a counter seat at the Hog
Island Oyster Bar.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Looking for that perfect little doodad for Aunt Hermione back home? Or
do you just like to browse and see what catches your fancy? Following is
a rundown of the city’s best shopping areas, with a few highlights in
each. Happy hunting!
Union Square
You’re never far from a department store in this neighborhood. From
one spot in the middle of Union Square, you can see Neiman Marcus
(% 415-362-3900) on Stockton and Geary streets (open: Mon, Thurs,
and Fri 10 a.m.–8 p.m.; Tues and Wed 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m.;
Sun noon–6 p.m.) and Saks Fifth Avenue (% 415-986-4300) on the
corner of Powell and Post streets (open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m. 
[Thurs open until 8 p.m.]; Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.). Then there’s Levi’s 
(see “Checking Out the Big Names”) on Post and Stockton, and Macy’s
(see “Checking Out the Big Names”) everywhere else. Ah . . . shopping!
A half-block north of Neiman’s on Stockton Street is Maiden Lane, which
is lined with designer shops. There’s also a back entrance to Britex
Fabrics (% 415-392-2910), probably the most well-stocked notions and
fabric store in the country (open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Sun noon–
5 p.m.). The front door is at 146 Geary St.
Parallel to Stockton eastward is Grant Street. One of the newest stores
here is also one of my favorites in the world, Anne Fontaine, 118 Grant
St. (% 415-677-0911). If you appreciate gorgeously made and tailored
white blouses (plus a few other nonwhite must-haves), you’ll be one
wide-eyed consumer. Walk another block east and 2 blocks north and
watch for tiny Belden Place between Bush and Pine streets (see Chapter
10). A covey of delicious little restaurants lines the alley, and any one of
them makes a satisfying place to stop for a meal. At lunchtime on fair
days, Belden, which is closed to auto traffic, is filled with cafe tables,
giving the street a partylike atmosphere (open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m.;
Sun noon–5 p.m.).
Be careful of the multitude of shady salespeople who operate question-
able electronics/camera, luggage, and gift shops on certain blocks of
Mason and Market streets around Union Square. (You’ll probably know
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
206

them when you see them: Most offer too-good-to-be-true deals, and
some have someone standing outside the store scoping out potential
customers.) Out-of-town customers have been known to discover
inflated charges on their credit cards after shopping at these places, so
buyer beware.
Chinatown
Chinatown is known for its amusing trinkets and inexpensive clothing.
But most of the souvenirs sold in the shops that line Grant Avenue are
not the must-haves you come to San Francisco seeking. If you venture off
Grant Avenue, however, shop to your heart’s content in Chinese herbal
shops with strange remedies and unique jewelry stores full of jade of
varying quality. The merchants in the less touristy stores don’t always
speak English, and they may seem less than friendly, but don’t let that
stop you from looking around.
The “going-out-of-business” signs you see taped to the windows of sev-
eral Chinatown stores are nearly as old as the grandmothers walking
about with babies tied to their backs. These stores have been running
their farewell sales for years. Don’t expect any bargains.
If you can’t tear yourself away from Grant Avenue, the best place to 
find inexpensive (or expensive) gifts and housewares is Chong Imports,
838 Grant Ave., in the Empress of China building between Clay and
Washington streets (% 415-982-1432). This basement-level treasure
house stocks a little of everything. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
At the Clarion Music Center, 816 Sacramento St., near Grant Avenue 
(% 415-391-1317; www.clarionmusic.com), check out the amazing
instruments, including traditional Chinese instruments like moon-
shaped guitars, plus Chinese lion dance masks. It’s open Monday
through Friday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Call for a Friday night world concert series schedule.
Tai Yick Trading Company, 1400 Powell St., at Broadway (% 415-986-
0961), sells teapots, dishes, lamps, porcelain and pottery vases, and
statues at reasonable prices. The owners are helpful and friendly, and
native San Franciscans swear that this is the best store of its kind in
town. It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
The Imperial Tea Court, 1411 Powell St., near Broadway (% 415-788-
6080), noted as a tranquil place to rejuvenate yourself, sells everything
you need to brew a proper cup of Chinese tea. It’s open Wednesday
through Monday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Legend has it that fortune cookies were invented at the Japanese Tea
Garden in Golden Gate Park. If you want to watch these cookies being
made, head to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company in Chinatown
(see Chapter 11). They make wonderful gifts to take back home. The fac-
tory is at 956 Ross Alley, between Jackson and Washington streets near
Grant Avenue. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 207

Haight Street
The scruffiness of this area used to bother me when I lived nearby in the
early ’80s, but I’ve changed and so has the neighborhood. Clothing is the
big draw for shoppers, whether vintage or cutting edge, and you’ll locate
apparel and shoes for all ages and stages. In particular, look for Behind
the Post Office, 1510 Haight St. (% 415-861-2507), for accessories from
local designers; Kids Only, 1608 Haight St. (% 415-552-5445), for your
flower child; Ambiance, 1458 Haight St. (% 415-552-5095), for pretty
dresses, stylish shoes, and somewhat retro handbags; and Villains
Vault, 1653 and 1672 Haight St. (% 415-864-7727 or 415-626-5939), 
for streetwear and shoes. Most stores on Haight Street are open from 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.
North Beach
North Beach is more than just a food-and-drink mecca — you can find all
sorts of curiosities and clothing off Columbus Street. The section of
Grant Avenue (completely different from the street of the same name in
Chinatown) from Union to Greenwich streets has a more Continental
accent, with stylish boutiques for clothes and accessories. Among the
finds — and there are many — head to Knitz & Leather, 1429 Grant Ave.
(% 415-391-3480), for handmade sweaters and leather jackets (open:
Mon–Tues 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Wed–Sat 11 a.m.–5 p.m. and Sun noon–5 p.m.).
Old Vogue, 1412 Grant St. (% 415-392-1522), is a better organized and
higher-quality vintage shop than most of those on Haight Street, while
Ooma, 1422 Grant St. (% 415-627-6963), displays the goods of local
designers. Members of your party not interested in clothes may find the
oriental antiques at the Enchanted House more to their liking. It’s at
1411 Grant Ave. (% 415-981-5870).
You don’t need to comb Italy for ceramics when you can shop at Biordi
Art Imports, 412 Columbus Ave., at Vallejo Street (% 415-392-8096).
You’ll find the most beautiful hand-painted Majolica dishes and serving
pieces nearly too pretty to actually use. It’s open Monday through
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
City Lights Bookstore, 261 Columbus Ave. (% 415-362-8193; www.city
lights.com), is famous for its Beat Generation roots, but it’s also a
book fiend’s paradise. The first all-paperback bookstore in San Francisco,
this city institution dates to 1953, when it was opened by Beat poet
Lawrence Ferlinghetti. At the time, most people thought hardcover
books were superior to paperbacks in terms of both the quality of the
content as well as the quality of the paper. Ferlinghetti challenged this
attitude and made great literature available to everyone by stocking his
bookstore with less-costly paperback editions. The San Francisco Board
of Supervisors recently designated the store a cultural and architectural
landmark, assuring a long and happy life for the building. Ferlinghetti’s
brainchild is also on its way to becoming a national historic site. It’s
open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
208

Admirers of chocolate can wedge themselves into XOX Truffles, 754
Columbus Ave. (% 415-421-4814), a tiny store devoted to nickel-sized
truffles in a huge assortment of flavors. These bites of bliss are all hand-
made under the direction of a handsome French chef, who removed him-
self from the rigors of the restaurant world to bring pleasure to us
chocoholics. Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Union and Chestnut streets
According to a survey, one out of four visitors to San Francisco plans on
visiting Union Street between Fillmore Street and Van Ness Avenue in the
Marina district. Folks who love wandering in and out of specialty shops
will think they’ve hit pay dirt. Muni buses 22-Fillmore, 41-Union,
42–Downtown Loop, and 45-Union/Stockton all run on Union Street.
Carol Doda, who shaped a career out of her chest long before implants
were considered accessories, runs a lingerie shop, Carol Doda’s
Champagne and Lace, at 1850 Union St. (% 415-776-6900). She carries
bras in regular and hard-to-find sizes, plus lots of other fun things. It’s
open daily from 12:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Sunday until 5 p.m.
Cover yourself with beautiful adornments crafted by local artists at
Gallery of Jewels, 2101 Union St. (% 415-929-0259), open Monday
through Friday 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. You’ll
find unique pieces of jewelry as well as purses and hats on occasion.
Because man apparently does not live by cashmere alone, you may be
interested in perusing The Collectors Cave at 2072 Union St. (% 415-
929-0231), which displays all kinds of new and old comic books, action
figures, and sports cards for serious and not-so-serious collectors. It’s
open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Mudpie, 1694 Union St. (% 415-771-9262), sells expensive children’s
clothes and gifts. Sticker shock is slightly alleviated in the downstairs
saleroom, where everything is half-price. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 1 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Another highly attractive, healthy shopping area is Chestnut Street in
Cow Hollow, patronized by highly attractive and healthy locals with
plenty of discretionary cash. Neither Chestnut nor Union Street, a few
blocks south, has been able to fight off the invasion by some of the more
ambitious chain stores, but local neighborhood and merchant groups
are vigilant enough to keep them at a minimum. Muni bus 30-Stockton or
43-Masonic will get you to Chestnut Street.
Among the Banana Republic, Pottery Barn, and Williams-Sonoma stores
lining the area is an anomaly, Burton’s Pharmacy, 2016 Chestnut St. 
(% 415-567-1166), one of the few remaining independent drugstores
left. It’s open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 
6 p.m.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 209

On the other end of Chestnut is another independent, Books, Inc., 2251
Chestnut St. (% 415-931-3633), which has a broad inventory of reading
material for the entire family. It’s open Sunday through Thursday 9 a.m.
to 10 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Pacific Heights
The tony neighborhood of Pacific Heights offers shoppers Fillmore
Street, which is chock-full of clothing boutiques and other cool places to
shop. Between Jackson and Sutter streets, you won’t be able to put your
credit card away.
Kiehl’s manufactures high-end, high-quality cosmetics and hair products
for men and women. Their shop at 2360 Fillmore St. (% 415-359-9260) is
one of only two freestanding retail outlets in the country. It’s open
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Nest, 2300 Fillmore St., at Clay Street (% 415-292-6199), is yet another
home store, but one that carries many old French decorative items,
including quilts and linens. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10:30 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
You don’t see many hat shops left in the world, so a visit to Mrs.
Dewson’s Hats, 2050 Fillmore St. (% 415-346-1600), is a must if your
chapeau is a little tattered. This place is home to the “Willie Brim,” a
fedora named after Mayor Willie Brown. It’s open Tuesday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday noon to 4 p.m.
Polk Street
The stretch of road from Filbert to Broadway on the Russian Hill end of
Polk Street has blossomed into a hot spot for dining and shopping.
Along with a second location for Nest (see the preceding section), two
little shops for the home, La Place du Soleil, at 2356 Polk St. (% 415-
771-4252; open: Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.), and La
Tulipe Noire, at 2418 Polk St. (% 415-922-2000; open: Tues–Sun 11
a.m.–7 p.m.), will seemingly transport you to a street in the fourth
arrondissement of Paris.
Sacramento Street
Some exclusive antiques shops and also some of the best secondhand
stores in town can be found in the section of Sacramento Street between
Spruce and Divisadero streets in Presidio Heights. The 1-California bus
takes you within 1 block of Sacramento Street.
Before housewares were considered a lifestyle choice, Forrest Jones,
3274 Sacramento St. (% 415-567-2483), was stocking an array of kitchen
tools, linens, lovely porcelain lamp bases and vases, cookbooks, glass-
ware, and other necessities. The variety of goods crowded about makes
the store very appealing. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
210

Elaine Magnin’s needlepoint shop, 3310 Sacramento St. (% 415-931-
3063), is the place to go if you wield a mighty needle and are seeking
some new patterns. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
If you want to see what the swells have cleaned out of their closets (the
locals are going to hate me for this), head to GoodByes, 3464 Sacramento
St., between Walnut and Laurel streets (% 415-346-6388). This is the
place for gently worn men’s and women’s clothing. It’s open Monday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday until 8 p.m., and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. A second store for women only is across
the street (% 415-674-0151).
Hayes Street
Naming the hippest shopping street in the city would be difficult, but if
forced, I’d have to say Hayes Street. Start at Grove and Gough, where
you’ll find the expanded MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing) store at 387
Grove St. (% 415-863-3011; open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun noon–
6 p.m.). From there, head 1 block south to Hayes Street and start walking
toward the Pacific. You’ll find a wealth of stuff here for all facets of your
life unless you live like a Spartan or a monk, in which case you may want
to stop at the Gaia Tree, 575 Hayes St. (% 415-255-4848; open: Mon–
Tues 10 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Wed–Sat 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Sun noon–6 p.m.), for a
yoga mat or maybe a facial or a massage. See, there’s just no escaping
commerce. To see all the things you needed to buy before you got on the
plane, stop in Flight 001, 525 Hayes St. (% 415-487-1001), where they
sell those little spray bottles of Evian so you won’t dry up on the flight
home. If your feet hurt, stop in one of the many shoe stores here, includ-
ing Paolo Iantorno, 524 Hayes St. (% 415-552-4580), which sells beauti-
ful Italian-made creations for men and women to decorate whatever’s
below your ankles. The shop also stocks gorgeous handbags. Besides
regular weekday hours, many of the stores on these blocks are open
Sunday afternoons.
Valencia Street
In the last ten years, Valencia Street in the Mission District has been
developing into the shopping district for those who eschew the main-
stream. The blocks from 19th to 23rd streets still hold plenty of store-
front churches and used-appliance dens, but the cafes and restaurants
that ventured here in the first wave of gentrification have been joined by
sellers of youthful fashions, local art, and goods for the home. Of note is
Paxton Gate, 824 Valencia St. (% 415-824-1872; open: Mon–Fri noon–
7 p.m., Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–7 p.m.), part entomological display, part garden
store, but neither description does this place justice. Almost next door
is City Art (% 415-970-9900; open: Wed–Sun noon–9 p.m.), a co-op
gallery featuring San Francisco artists and photographers. And don’t
pass by Encantada Gallery of Fine Arts, 904 Valencia St. (% 415-642-
3939; open: Tues–Sun noon–6 p.m., until 8 p.m. Fri–Sat), which has a
wonderful collection of Mexican art and pottery, as well as a changing
exhibit of paintings and mixed media. One of my favorite local designers
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 211

for women’s clothing, Dema, has a store and workshop at 1038 Valencia
St. (% 415-206-0500). Dema’s patterns and colors are spirit raisers. My
favorite hat was fashioned at Laku, a teensy store at 1069 Valencia St.
(% 415-695-1462; open: Tues–Sat 11:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.),
which also sells handmade, fanciful slippers for babies and big people.
From downtown, use BART, exit at the 24th Street Station, and walk 1
block west. Most of the Valencia Street shops are closed on Mondays.
Hunting for bargains in SoMa and beyond
The discount manufacturers based South of Market (SoMa) have made
bargain shopping in San Francisco a popular pursuit. Although outlets
can be found around SoMa and beyond, the area between Townsend and
Bryant streets and Second and Fourth streets is great for bargains.
The hip retailer Rolo has an outlet for sale merchandise called Rolo
Garage, 1301 Howard St., at Ninth Street (% 415-861-1999). It’s open
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m and Sundays noon to 
6 p.m.
Two worthwhile stores are off Second Street between Bryant and
Brannan streets in South Park, a little sub-neighborhood south of
Market, once infamous for ties to the dot-com industry. Isda & Co.
Outlet, 28 South Park (% 415-512-1610; open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m.),
carries its fashionable women’s wear suitable for the office and after-
hours at great prices, while Jeremy’s, 2 South Park (% 415-882-4929;
open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun until 5 p.m.), is filled with last
season’s markdowns, returns, and display items from department stores
and some famous names.

Four Great Options 
to Make Your Day
In This Chapter
 Making the most out of three to five days
 Showing the kids a good time
 Taking a food-lover’s holiday
V
isitors naturally want to pack as much as possible into a sightseeing
trip, in case they don’t have a chance to return. Having been in that
position myself, I’ve come to the conclusion that travel isn’t pleasurable
if all you do is run around checking off sights as if you’re grocery shop-
ping. My idea of a good time is visiting one or two important sights in a
day (or sometimes just walking past the front portal and waving) and
then finding somewhere to sit and watch the world pass by. (I must
admit that I felt foolish for missing the Eiffel Tower on my first visit to
Paris — and I was in the neighborhood.) You may prefer a compromise
between these approaches, in which case I suggest you decide in
advance what you must see, and then fit in whatever else you can based
on how much time and energy you have.
On that note, the following suggested itineraries are intended for first-
time visitors who want to catch as much as possible without completely
exhausting themselves or their companions. I’ve packed in a lot, but you
can pick and choose (or completely ignore) parts of each.
San Francisco in Three Days
Three days is barely enough to “get” San Francisco, so I’m going to keep
you within the city limits for the entire time. The following list takes you
step by step through the city:

 Day 1: Find Market Street and catch one of the historic F-Market
streetcars (see Chapter 8) heading toward PIER 39 and Fisherman’s
Wharf. If you haven’t eaten breakfast, the Eagle Café on the second
floor of the pier serves a big, delicious one with views. If it happens
to be a Saturday, exit at the Ferry Plaza Farmers’ Market. A few of
the local restaurants — Hayes Street Grill, Rose Pistola — have
booths where you can buy something savory to eat for your morn-
ing meal, or you can make yourself quite happy with coffee and
fresh pastries from Frog Hollow Farms inside the building. When
you reach PIER 39, greet the sea lions (follow the barking) and con-
tinue to the end of the pier for a dead-on view of Alcatraz Island.
Walk to Aquatic Park to complete a tour of Fisherman’s Wharf
(see Chapter 11). You’ll pass the Hyde Street Pier and the
Maritime National Museum — pop in if you like ships — as well as
Ghirardelli Square. On Bay Street, catch a 30-Stockton bus to
Chestnut Street. If it’s not too soon to shop or eat, Mamacita (see
Chapter 10) is a great choice for Mexican food. The bus ends up at
Beach Street, and your task is to walk from the Palace of Fine Arts
through Crissy Field and the Presidio to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Follow the joggers along the bay; there’s a path. The 29-Sunset bus
will also take you there and back. End the afternoon around Union
Square, window shopping along Stockton and Sutter. Change your
clothes, then go to the Top of the Mark (see Chapter 10) for an
aperitif and a grand view. For dinner, see what’s cooking on Belden
Place (see Chapter 10), and if you still have a bit of steam left, drop
by Biscuits and Blues (see Chapter 16) for a musical nightcap.
 Day 2: This day starts with another transportation highlight. Fling
yourself on a Powell-Hyde cable car (see Chapter 8) for the brief
ride to Lombard Street. Walk down via the staircases on either side
and, heading north, find the San Francisco Art Institute at 800
Chestnut St. Inside the campus, follow the signs to the cafe for
breakfast or a snack. This is a funky place with unobstructed views
of the bay and a menu of sandwiches, bagels, and vegetarian
entrees priced for starving artists. Follow Filbert Street to
Washington Square Park in North Beach, a modest pocket of green
with plentiful benches on the perimeter and the twin spires of
Saints Peter and Paul’s Church solidly cutting into the sky to the
north. Park yourself on a bench, maybe with a latte in hand from
Mario’s Bohemian Cigar on the corner. Then stroll around North
Beach if you like, or walk up Grant Avenue past Union Street and
follow the signs to Coit Tower (see Chapter 11). From there, return
to North Beach for a leisurely lunch at Moose’s (see Chapter 10),
which is on the east side of the park, or pick up a sandwich at one
of the delis and have a picnic of sorts in Portsmouth Square (above
the parking garage on Kearny Street between Washington and Clay;
see Chapter 11), a short walk away. Spend the afternoon exploring
Chinatown (see Chapter 11). If you’re in the mood for Chinese cui-
sine for dinner, see Chapter 10 for suggestions. Then head back to
North Beach for a performance of Beach Blanket Babylon (see
Chapter 15).
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
216

 Day 3: Enjoy a walk in the park — Golden Gate Park (see Chap-
ter 11) — where you can row a boat on Stow Lake, hunt for Bison,
and smell the flowers in the Strybing Arboretum. Find lunch 
over on Ninth Avenue and then stroll down Irving Street, a typical
neighborhood shopping block. Alternatively, exit the park on
Stanyon Street and take in the Haight-Ashbury, also a typical 
neighborhood — for San Francisco. In the afternoon, a trip to the
Museum of Modern Art (see Chapter 11) finishes the artistic por-
tion of your vacation. Take a rest stop in Yerba Buena Gardens
(see Chapter 11) across the street. Then dine around Union Square
if you’re ambitious enough to see an 8 p.m. show at ACT or another
theater. Otherwise, hail a cab and head to a Mission District restau-
rant such as Delfina or Foreign Cinema (see Chapter 10), and pre-
tend you’re a local. Night owls can finish the evening at a salsa
dance club such as El Rio, or hang out with the hipsters at the
Make-Out Room (see Chapter 16).
San Francisco in Five Days
For a four- or five-day trip, you can add the following days to the itiner-
ary in the preceding section:
 Day 4: By now, you’ve already covered a fair portion of the city; it’s
probably time to hug a tree (you are in Northern California, after all).
Rent a car or take a guided tour (see Chapter 11) and cross the
Golden Gate Bridge into Marin. Hike Muir Woods in the morning
(take the Stinson Beach exit) and have lunch by Muir Beach at the
English Tudor–style Pelican Inn, located at the end of Muir Wood
Road at Highway 1 (% 415-383-6000; www.pelicaninn.com). The
inn is a short walk from the beach, which lies below a hikable hill.
Stop in Sausalito on your way back to the city for an ice cream or just
a walk along the bayfront — the San Francisco skyline is quite the
sight, but Sausalito itself, though postcard pretty, is quite touristy.
This evening, eat dinner in Japantown at either Mifune in the Japan
Center for noodles or Isuzu for sushi or tempura (see Chapter 10),
and maybe see what’s playing at the cineplex around the corner.
 Day 5: This may be the morning to get in your trip to Alcatraz
Island (see Chapter 11) or to trek to the Palace of the Legion of
Honor (see Chapter 11) for another dose of culture. For lunch 
try the Tadich Grill (see Chapter 10), the oldest restaurant in
California (although it’s been in its current location only since
1967). The menu of favorites, such as lobster thermidor, is accom-
panied with a side of local history and an active bar. Then spend
the afternoon catching up on shopping, or stroll down to Pier 5
near the Ferry Building (to the east of Broadway), where you can
hang out on benches and watch skateboarders or just admire the
view. In the evening, splurge with a fancy dinner — Ame or Quince
are two good choices (see Chapter 10) — followed by the late show
at Jazz at Pearl’s (see Chapter 16).
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary 217

San Francisco for Families with Kids
How to keep the kids engaged and happy (for example, not asking what
time it is, what they’re doing tomorrow, and when they’re eating)
depends on their ages and interests. Here’s a list to meet any need:
 For families with little kids: A day around Golden Gate Park is
ideal. The Japanese Tea Garden is memorable, you can’t miss with
either a bike ride or the paddle boats around Stow Lake, and young-
sters with energy to spare will gravitate toward the big, imagina-
tively designed playground. When lunch beckons, you can feed the
family reasonably at Park Chow on Ninth Avenue, just a block from
the park entrance. The zoo (see Chapter 11) is a logical alternative
for a morning’s activity as well; it’s easy to reach on a streetcar
and, on your return downtown, you may head to Yerba Buena
Gardens for lunch and then to the California Academy of Sciences
at their South of Market building (see Chapter 11). If a quieter after-
noon seems like a better idea, consider a ferryboat ride to
Sausalito and back.
 For families with slightly older progeny: Spend a delightful day
taking the cable car to Fisherman’s Wharf (see Chapter 8), where
PIER 39 holds sway, with its many shops and video games. You can
avoid the scene, if you prefer, with strategically timed tickets to
Alcatraz (see Chapter 11); think about bringing along sandwiches
or snacks because most of the food around the pier is overpriced
and underwhelming. If you can stave off starvation until your
return from solitary confinement, hustle everyone over to North
Beach on the Mason-Powell cable car and eat at Il Pollaio (see
Chapter 10). Chinatown is convenient to North Beach and kids love
browsing in the shops. For dinner, Lichee Gardens (see Chapter
10) is a good family-style Chinese restaurant, or you can eat at one
of the North Beach eateries such as La Felce, 1570 Stockton St., at
Union (% 415-392-8321), where antipasti, pasta, and roast meats
satisfy diverse tastes.
 For families with kids of varied ages: Yerba Buena Gardens (see
Chapter 11) is a godsend. Teens are usually more than happy to hang
out in Metreon’s Airtight Garage and at Zeum, while younger sib-
lings can ride the merry-go-round and then run around the gardens.
Skating or bowling works for everyone, and there is plenty of food to
be had within walking distance. For a step above the center’s offer-
ings, Pazzia (see Chapter 10) is an excellent choice for dinner.
San Francisco for Foodies
You could come here and spend a week honing your talents in the
kitchen at Tante Marie’s Cooking School (% 415-788-6699; www.tante
marie.com) and that would certainly qualify you as a foodie. Or you
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
218

could imitate my friend Bev, who flies up from Los Angeles on a regular
basis to raid North Beach for supplies and then orders huge meals at
the restaurant of the moment. Because the cooking classes run from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 10 p.m., let’s make like Bev for a day instead.
Wake up and smell the cappuccino and a raisin roll at a local favorite,
Caffe Greco, 423 Columbus Ave., in North Beach (% 415-397-6261).
While you sip, make a mental note of how much room you have in your
suitcase for imported Italian delicacies, then walk a block to Molinari’s
delicatessen on the corner of Columbus and Vallejo Street (% 415-421-
2337). If you have some way of refrigerating fresh sausages and cheese,
you can take better advantage of the selection here — otherwise, con-
sider ordering a sandwich to go for later. Drop by Liguria (see Chap-
ter 10) for a sheet of pizza focaccia, which will make you the envy of
your fellow airplane passengers on the ride home. If you need a new
pizza stone, go to A. Cavalli & Co., 1441 Stockton St., which also sells
Italian cards and maps, as well as cooking utensils.
Don’t miss immersing yourself in San Francisco’s cultural diversity by
eating as much dim sum as possible and stocking up on the wealth of
ingredients available in its ethnic enclaves. Bev’s favorite, Mayflower in
the Richmond District, 6255 Geary Blvd. (% 415-387-8338), makes fine
dumplings and won’t be mobbed like the dim sum places in Chinatown
(few tourists venture this far out on Geary Boulevard). After lunch, walk
or take a bus north down Clement Street, 1 block west of Geary, and stop
by Green Apple Books, 506 Clement St., to peruse a sizable selection of
used cookbooks. You can find many produce, fish, and meat markets
along Clement, as well as housewares stores; May Wah, 547 Clement St.,
is worth a look, as is Kamei, 606 Clement St. If you’re serious about
eating, you’ll probably be ready for a snack or at least coffee by this
time. Bev fights for parking on Valencia Street in order to down an
espresso at Ritual Coffee while musing over taquerias. Fortunately,
Pancho Villa (see Chapter 10) tosses together a steak and prawn quesadilla
that is unparalleled for quality and price. Because you’ll find it in the
Mission District, you’ll also want to visit La Palma, 2884 24th St., at
Florida (% 415-647-1500), for fresh tortillas, dried chiles, and other
essentials for cooking Mexican food. Make your way to Civic Center on
the F-Market and stop at Yum, 1750 Market St. (% 415-626-9866), for
more additions to your pantry. You’ll find a glorious selection of spices,
and Blanxart chocolate from Catalonia (the best). Finally, head south of
Market to the Wine House at 535 Bryant St., between Third and Fourth
streets, where the staff is very knowledgeable. For dinner, consider a
new leading destination such as Range (see Chapter 10) or a high-end
experience such as Gary Danko (see Chapter 10). If you have another
day, or you’re ready for more, see Chapter 14 for additional dining 
destinations.

f you have the time to spare, or want to break up your trip with a
glimpse of the rest of Northern California, here are three fabulous day
trips that will show you some of the region around San Francisco.
Day Trip #1: Berkeley
As you approach Berkeley, a mere 20 minutes over the Bay Bridge, you’ll
know you aren’t in San Francisco anymore. The weather is an immediate
giveaway — although the temperature isn’t dramatically different, San
Francisco’s ever-present summer fog disappears. Berkeley is also
smaller, and much of its cultural life revolves around the University of
California at Berkeley (UCB) campus. One thing both cities have in
common is a devotion to fine dining. In fact, one excellent reason to visit
Berkeley is to eat a great meal.
Getting there
You can use BART to reach Berkeley, but taking a car is better. Most
people drive over the Bay Bridge and follow the signs to Highway 80.
The exits include Ashby Avenue, University, and Gilman. If you intend to
begin your day on Fourth Street (see “Shopping delights” later in this
chapter), take the University Avenue exit. If the University is your first
stop, an alternate route is Highway 24, exiting on scenic Claremont
Avenue. Claremont intersects College Avenue, which leads directly to
the campus while avoiding the less handsome flatlands of Berkeley.

If you visit on a Thursday, you get free admission to UCB museums and
the botanical garden.
Seeing the sights
To my mind, an ideal day in Berkeley revolves around lunch or dinner at
Chez Panisse (see “Dining locally” later in this chapter). The food is as
close to perfect as food gets. If your reservation is for dinner, you can
easily spend your time shopping on Fourth Street (see “Shopping
delights” later in this chapter), walking around Tilden Park, and seeing
what’s up at the UCB campus. If you’ve made lunch reservations, tour
UCB in the morning and hike in Tilden Park or check out the merchan-
dise on Telegraph Avenue or Fourth Street in the afternoon.
The attractive, active campus of University of California at Berkeley is
the biggest sight in Berkeley, so to speak. The Visitor Information
Center is at 101 University Hall, 2200 University Ave., at Oxford Street
(% 510-642-5215). You can join a free 10 a.m. campus tour there
Monday through Friday. Weekend tours leave from the Campanile at 
10 a.m. Saturdays and 1 p.m. Sundays.
Other notable UCB stops include the Hearst Museum of Anthropology
(% 510-642-6271; www.hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu; open: Wed–Sat
10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.; admission: $4 adults, $3 seniors, $1
students with student ID, free Thurs), the Berkeley Art Museum at 2621
Durant Ave. and 2626 Bancroft Way (% 510-642-0808; www.bampfa.
berkeley.edu; open: Wed–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.; admission: $8 adults, 
$5 seniors, students and children, free Thurs), and the 307-foot-tall
Sather Tower (also known as the Campanile) in the center of campus,
where you can take an elevator to the top for excellent views of Berkeley
and the bay (open: daily; admission: $2 adults, $1 seniors, free for kids
under 18).
Above the campus in the lush hills is the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden,
200 Centennial Dr. (% 510-643-2755; www.botanicalgarden.berkeley.
edu; admission: $3 adults, $3 seniors 65 and older, $1 kids 3–18, free
Thurs). It features 13,000 plants, including cactus and rose gardens. It’s a
good place for an easy hike. Open daily 9 a.m.– 5 p.m. Farther up the
road, the kid-friendly Lawrence Hall of Science (% 510-642-5132;
www.lawrencehallofscience.org; open: daily 10 a.m.– 5 p.m.; admis-
sion: $9.50 adults, $7.50 seniors and students, $5.50 kids ages 3–4) brings
science up close and personal. This is an excellent hands-on museum
that has activities for kids from 3 to 12.
The campus is bounded by shops, cafes, and well-stocked bookstores.
To get a sense of Berkeley street life, walk along Telegraph Avenue
from Bancroft to Ashby, and get your fill of cappuccino, street vendors,
psychic readers, and the occasional weirdo.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
222

Shopping delights
Close to the University exit off I-80 is Fourth Street, a mecca for shop-
pers from all over the Bay Area. It started out small, with a few outlet
stores and a popular diner, but over the years it developed into a full-
fledged destination for fashion, food, and home décor. Begin by oohing
over the gorgeous accessories for home and garden at The Gardener,
1836 Fourth St. (% 510-548-4545; www.thegardener.com; open: Mon–
Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.), and keep heading on down the
block.
Dining locally
Each of these restaurants is a great place to dine while you’re in
Berkeley, and Chez Panisse is definitely a “destination” eatery.
Bette’s Oceanview Diner
$
AMERICAN
You can sit down here for a homey breakfast or lunch featuring tender
baked goods, tasty salads, and Bette’s famous pancakes. Expect crowds
and a long wait on the weekends. Next door, Bette’s sells takeout sand-
wiches, salads, and desserts, to take care of impatient hungry people.
1807 Fourth St., Berkeley. % 510-644-3230. No reservations. Main courses: $6.50–$11.
MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 6:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 6:30 a.m.–4 p.m.
Cafe Rouge
$–$$
MEDITERRANEAN
Those living in the Fourth Street neighborhood don’t have many reasons
to stray. Everything you need is nearby, including a lovely meal in this
French-style bistro opened by a kitchen alumnus of Chez Panisse. Meat
eaters will be charmed by the menu (go admire the butcher counter in the
back), while mollusk fans can turn to the oysters. Desserts shine as well.
1782 Fourth St., Berkeley. % 510-525-1440. www.caferouge.net. Reservations
advised. Main courses: $15–$32. MC, V. Open: Monday is lunch only. Tues–Sun 11:30
a.m.–9:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10:30 p.m.
Chez Panisse and Chez Panisse Café
$$$–$$$$
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse, is an icon in the food world,
respected for adhering to her vision of food as a gift we give daily to our
loved ones (including you) and for serving beautifully constructed dishes.
Eating here in the cafe or restaurant is one of the nicer things you’ll do for
yourself. Dinner downstairs is $45 to $75 prix fixe, depending on the night.
The cafe is moderately priced, comparatively speaking, but expect to
spend a lot more than you think prudent for lunch. It’s worth it.
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 223

1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley. % 510-548-5525. www.chezpanisse.com. Advance
reservations a must for dinner in the restaurant; recommended for dinner in the cafe.
Main courses: $50–$85 prix fixe downstairs; $17–$25 in the cafe. AMEX, DISC, MC, V.
Open: Restaurant Mon–Sat first seating begins 6–6:30 p.m. and second seating
8:30–9:30p.m.; cafe Mon–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–3 p.m. and 5–10:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 
11:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m. and 5–11:30 p.m.
Day Trip #2: Point Reyes and Inverness
A scenic one-hour drive through the small towns of Marin County and
Samuel P. Taylor State Park leads you to Point Reyes National Seashore,
a mix of wild coastline and forest of unequivocal appeal to hikers, nature
lovers, and wildlife-watchers. The rocky shore along this part of the
coast is a direct result of earthquake activity — you can even get a close-
up look at the San Andreas Fault. Point Reyes Station, the minuscule
town nearby, is a bit of a tourist magnet on the weekends, so you can
find a selection of excellent restaurants and interesting shops within its
4-block radius. Inverness, a tiny community on Tomales Bay, a few miles
farther north, has a handful of picturesque inns and B&Bs. For more
information, log onto www.pointreyes.net, which has links to other
Web sites of interest.
Deciding when to visit
When planning your trip, remember the Point Reyes Lighthouse is
closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays. If you can come later in the week
(avoiding the crowded weekends), you’ll be treated to relatively empty
roads, even during the summer. The best times to view seasonal flora
and fauna in the Point Reyes National Seashore area are as follows:
 Wildflowers: February through July
 Elephant seals: November through March
 Harbor seals: Mid-March through mid-June
 Gray whales: January through March
And another word of advice: Bring warm clothes. The weather in Point
Reyes is often cold and sometimes foggy in the summer.
Getting to the Point
To reach Point Reyes, cross the Golden Gate Bridge and exit on San
Anselmo/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. Then turn left, heading west on Sir
Francis Drake, and stay on this road as it passes through the high-priced
burgs of San Anselmo, Ross, Woodacre, and Lagunitas. It takes about an
hour (with light traffic) to reach seashore headquarters.

Seeing the sights
At the junction of Highway 1 and Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in Olema,
follow the signs to the Bear Valley Visitor Center (% 415-464-5100),
about one minute away. The Center has maps, informative park rangers,
a book/gift section, and some interesting exhibits on the ecology of the
area. Many trails begin here, including an under-1-mile earthquake trail
along the San Andreas Fault. Another park attraction is Kule Loklo, a
Coast Miwok Native Indian village replica.
Hiking is the prime activity in the park, but a drive to Limantour Beach
is another option. You get to the beach by turning left on Bear Valley
Road and left again on Limantour Road. Swimming is not recommended
(besides, it’s usually too cold), but you can bird-watch and picnic here.
Point Reyes Lighthouse is a big attraction in these parts all year long
but especially from January through March when migrating gray whales
pass by. From the Bear Valley Visitor Center, the lighthouse is a 21-mile
drive along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard past dairy farms and pastures.
At the end of the road is a parking lot. The lighthouse is a half-mile walk
away and down 300 steps. The cliffs all around this area are not stable
enough to climb on, and you’ll see lots of warnings to that effect. Sea
Lion Overlook near the lighthouse is the place to watch those creatures
as well as harbor seals.
From this stop, it’s a short drive to Drake’s Beach (follow the signs as
you drive to or from the lighthouse). Another fine visitor center with
park rangers is on the beach parking lot, next to a cafe specializing in
fried foods. As is the case at all the area beaches, no lifeguard is on duty
and the undertow can be dangerous, so swimming is not encouraged. At
the end of Drake’s Beach, past the Point Reyes Lifeboat Station, is
Chimney Rock. The Elephant Seal Overlook nearby is a good vantage
point for observing elephant seals in the winter months.
At the northernmost tip of the seashore at Tomales Point is the Tule Elk
Reserve, where over 500 of these once-nearly-extinct creatures live on
2,600 protected acres. The reserve is a 30-minute drive from Inverness.
Stay on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard until you reach Pierce Point Road,
which takes you directly into the reserve.
Some wonderful swimming beaches are located along Tomales Bay in
Inverness. If you happen to be making this trip in August in warmer
weather, with or without kids, look for signs along Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard leading to Chicken Ranch Beach or Shell Beach.
Dining locally
If you’re hungry or want to gather a picnic, continue on Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard until it meets Point Reyes–Petaluma Road. Drive across the
little bridge and you’ll be in Point Reyes Station. The Pine Cone Diner,
60 Fourth St. (% 415-663-1536; www.pineconediner.com), is open for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The Station House, 11180 State Route 1 
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
226

(% 415-663-1515; www.stationhousecafe.com), is also popular and
moderately priced (and there’s live music on Fri and Sat nights). The
kitchen uses lots of locally produced foods. For takeout, Tomales Bay
Foods, 80 Fourth St. (% 415-663-9335), has a small but fantastic menu
of salads and sandwiches to go. It shares a building with Cow Girl cream-
ery and a shop with lovely hand-woven clothing.
Spending the night
If you want to turn your day trip into an overnight, here’s a good choice
for accommodation. For more inn or B&B choices, contact Point Reyes
Lodging (% 800-539-1872; www.ptreyes.com).
Manka’s Inverness Lodge
$$$–$$$$
Inverness
Inverness consists of a few stores and restaurants, private homes, and
some inns. At the high end is Manka’s, a handsomely rustic, romantic 80-
year-old former hunting and fishing lodge that looks as if Ralph Lauren
would feel at home there. Rooms contain fireplaces, comfy beds, privacy,
and that woodsy feeling Red Riding Hood’s grandmother must have known
and loved. Manka’s is also renowned for its $58 to $88 gourmet prix-fixe
dinners served Thursday through Monday — it’s by far the best place in
town to eat.
Argyle Road, Inverness. % 415-669-1034. www.mankas.com. Look for the sign
pointing to Argyle Road, off Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. Rack rates: $215–$615
double; two-night minimum on weekends. Call months ahead for reservations.

Day Trip #3: The Wine Country
About an hour’s drive north of San Francisco is the gorgeous Napa
Valley, America’s most celebrated wine-producing region. Less than 
30 miles from end to end, this fertile area brims with world-class wine-
tasting rooms, excellent restaurants, and marvelous resorts and inns.
Just to the west of Napa Valley along Highway 12 is the peaceful Sonoma
Valley. Sonoma Valley is quieter and somewhat less tourist-oriented —
but equal to its neighbor as a grape-lover’s paradise. Although both val-
leys are vacation destinations, many visitors arrive for a day of wine
tasting and then turn around and head back to San Francisco. That’s not
the ideal way to get the most out of this bucolic piece of earth. If at all
possible, stay a few days to relax and renew before heading back to
tackle the big city.
Planning a visit to the Wine Country

The Wine Country
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
228
anyway — because the best way to tour Napa Valley or Sonoma Valley is
by car. If you don’t want to drive, you can join an organized tour. But if
you want to spend a night or two in Sonoma or in one of the towns near
Napa, or if you want to visit smaller, less commercial wineries than those
the tour companies choose, you’ll need to drive yourself.
Getting to the Wine Country
You can take one of two roads to get there. The faster, less scenic route
is across the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (I-80). The more scenic
path crosses the Golden Gate Bridge and meanders up through Marin
County on U.S. 101. For the return trip, from Napa, I highly recommend
taking I-80 rather than U.S. 101 over the Golden Gate Bridge, especially if
you’re traveling on a weekend. But to get back from Sonoma, use the
Golden Gate Bridge.
If you decide to go the Bay Bridge route to Napa, drive east over the
bridge (I-80) and then north to the Napa/Highway 29 exit near Vallejo.

Highway 29 is the main road through the Napa Valley. The trip takes
approximately 70 minutes.
If you decide to go over the Golden Gate Bridge, continue on U.S. 101
north to Novato, where you need to pick up Highway 37 east. Then, if
you’re interested in a pleasant drive and aren’t in a big hurry, take
Highway 121 (the Sonoma Highway) north toward Sonoma and then east
to Napa, if that’s your destination, where you’ll end up on Highway 29. If
Sonoma is your destination, take Highway 12. Make sure to have a map
handy. This drive takes about 90 minutes.
Contact the Napa Valley Conference & Visitors Bureau, 1310 Napa
Town Center, Napa, CA 94559 (% 707-226-7459; www.napavalley.com),
for maps to help get you on your way.
Picking the best time to visit
The most popular seasons for touring Napa and Sonoma valleys are
summer and fall. The summers are hot in Wine Country, which is one
reason why it’s a favorite with fog-bound San Franciscans. September
and October are extremely busy due to the crush, or grape harvest,
when the sweet aroma of must (crushed grapes) fills the air.
Wine Country is delightful any time of year. In the winter, restaurants
aren’t jammed and traffic is light. Spring is beautiful and still relatively
uncrowded. However, if the forecast calls for rain, I recommend you save
this trip for another time. If you do plan to visit Wine Country during
summer or autumn, make lodging reservations early.
You’ll meet with a lot more traffic and tourists on the weekends than on
the weekdays. Also, Golden Gate Bridge traffic heading north on Friday
afternoons and south on Sunday afternoons is amazing, and I don’t mean
that in a positive way. Let the guys with their weekend plans sit and stew
on 101. Go while everyone else is at work.
Looking out for your safety
Although you may taste wines all along the 35-mile route through Napa
and on the scenic roads through Sonoma, the rules of drinking and driv-
ing (and common sense) still apply. All those sips add up more quickly
than you think. Every tasting room has containers for spitting out the
wine so you can taste without actually letting it go to your head.
Highway 29 is dangerous, even if you’re not drinking. This two-lane thor-
oughfare through Napa Valley has been the scene of many accidents,
especially at night.
Taking an escorted Wine Country tour
A good option if you don’t feel comfortable driving, or if you’re on a tight
schedule, is a one-day Wine Country tour to the Napa and Sonoma val-
leys offered by San Francisco companies. On these six- to nine-hour
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 229

tours, you can usually visit two to three wineries and have lunch in one
of the picturesque villages along the way. The downside of a tour like
this is that you won’t see some of the great wineries that aren’t part of
the tour itinerary, you won’t have time to relax in places that catch your
eye, and you may not be able to choose where you want to eat.
But if you’re interested in the escorted tours, you have two main
options: a tour that starts in San Francisco or a tour that starts in the
Wine Country. Here are a few good tours that leave from San Francisco:
 Great Pacific Tour Company (% 415-626-4499; www.greatpacific
tour.com) picks you up at your San Francisco hotel and delivers
you back after tastings at two Sonoma wineries, a picnic lunch, and
a tour of Domaine Chandon, a sparkling wine producer in Napa.
The cost, including lunch, is $83 for adults, $81 for seniors, and $71
for children 5 to 11.
 California Wine Tours (% 800-294-6386; www.californiawine
tours.com) offers several Wine Country outings from Napa and
Sonoma, and one originating in San Francisco. Customers take 
the 8:55 a.m. ferry to Vallejo where they are met by limo for a six-
hour excursion that includes five very diverse wineries, including 
V. Sattuoi where you can picnic. The price is $72 per person, which
includes round-trip tickets on the ferry.
 Tower Tours (% 866-345-8687; www.towertours.net) takes you
to Napa and Sonoma valleys for the day, with stops at three winer-
ies and lunch in Yountville or the town of Sonoma with a little time
to shop. The charge is $59 for adults and $39 for children. Save $5
by booking online.
And here are some of the best tours originating in the Wine Country:
 Wine Country Jeep Tours (% 800-539-5337; www.jeeptours.com)
will plan a custom three- to four-hour winery tour that can include
some off-road trailblazing and a picnic lunch. The cost is $75 per
person and another $25 each for each additional hour.
 Napa Winery Shuttle (% 707-257-1950; www.wineshuttle.com), a
small family-run enterprise, gets my vote for value and flexibility.
You and your shuttle driver plan the itinerary, although the com-
pany does have some favorite wineries it likes to show off. The
price is $52 per person for the day — approximately 10 a.m. to 
4 or 5 p.m.
 The Napa Valley Wine Train (% 800-427-4124 or 707-253-2111;
www.winetrain.com), like a gourmet restaurant on wheels, choo-
choos 36 miles through the valley, from the town of Napa to the vil-
lage of St. Helena and back. You can get a lunch, Sunday brunch, or
dinner tour starting in price from $89. These tours primarily
involve dining and admiring the gorgeous scenery. Two trips that
include stops at a winery are the Grgich Hills Private Winery Tour
and Tasting, a luncheon ride that costs $110 per person, and the
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
230

Domaine Chandon Winery excursion at $115 per person. Onboard
the train is a wine-tasting car with an attractive bar and knowledge-
able host. The three-hour tours depart from the train station in
downtown Napa, at 1275 McKinstry St. You must make reservations
for the train. If you don’t want to drive to Napa, for $145, Grayline
(% 888-428-6937 or 415-558-9400; www.graylinesanfrancisco.
com) will bus you to and from your hotel to the wine train station in
Napa for the excursion.
Mapping out your winery journey
A single day in Wine Country can’t do the area justice and will leave you
wanting more. But if that’s all the time you have, plan to visit no more
than three to four wineries, one before lunch and two or three after, fol-
lowed by a late-afternoon snack or an early dinner.
If you spend two days and a night, you’ll have the chance to do some
other enjoyable activities such as checking out Copia (see “Napa excur-
sions” later in this chapter), biking down a sleepy road, or taking a spa
treatment. You could also cut down on your winery visits the first day
and take advantage of whatever your inn has to offer, such as a swim-
ming pool, a garden walk, or just some peace and quiet. On your second
day, have a substantial breakfast and consider one of the 11 a.m. reser-
vation-only winery tours, such as the one offered by Benziger. To
occupy any extra time you may have left in your schedule, there’s
always outlet shopping in Napa and along Highway 29 past St. Helena.
Creating a wine-tasting itinerary isn’t easy, because there are so many
vineyards to choose from. The wineries suggested in this chapter are
great for first-time tasters, because they make a special effort to accom-
modate visitors. These vineyards offer tours, exhibits, and/or an extra-
friendly staff. But there are plenty more vineyards to choose from, so get
a map of the area and, time permitting, explore those back roads.
Touring the wineries on your own
For wine-tasting newbies, the first winery you visit should be one that
offers an in-depth tour, so you can familiarize yourself with the winemak-
ing process. If you’re traveling from north to south, Sterling Vineyards
in Calistoga is a good bet, as is Robert Mondavi in Oakville. In Sonoma,
the tram operators at Benziger are both knowledgeable and accessible.
If you’re already somewhat of a connoisseur, ask your local wine mer-
chant for suggestions on smaller wineries that you may enjoy.
The Napa Valley is home to more than 380 wineries (Sonoma has around
250), some owned by corporations and others by individuals so seduced
by the grape that they abandoned successful careers to devote them-
selves to viticulture (the cultivation of grapes). Although there’s no cor-
relation between the size of a winery and the quality of the product —
which has more to do with the talents of the vintners (winemakers) and
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 231

variables such as weather and soil conditions — the bigger wineries
offer more to visitors in terms of education and entertainment.
You can greatly enhance your knowledge of wine by tasting correctly —
and what better classroom than a French-style chateau smack in the
middle of a vineyard? Remember that wine appreciation begins by ana-
lyzing color, followed by aroma, then taste. You do this with your eyes
first, then your nose, then your mouth. Don’t be shy about asking ques-
tions of the person pouring — he’ll cheerfully explain all, because the
more you discover about the product, the more likely you are to become
a steady customer. And that makes everybody happy!
You won’t be able to get a deal on wine that you purchase directly from
the wineries. They sell their wines at the full retail price so as not to
undercut their primary market, the wine merchants. If you can’t get a
particular vintage at home, most wineries may be able to mail-order it
for you (depending on the laws in your home state).
Wineries in Napa Valley
Wineries in Napa (less so in Sonoma) are developing new ways to market
wine tasting as an educational/culinary event — and an expensive one at
that. In what I think is an effort to eradicate the notion that this is a great
way to cage free alcohol, most wineries charge at least a nominal tasting
fee and many are promoting sit-down food and wine pairings for real
money. Rubicon Estate (formerly Niebaum-Coppola) is a case in point;
you can’t even drive onto the property without paying $25 at the gate
per adult, just so they know you really, really want to be there (the fee
covers a tour and five tastes). Wine tasting has become very serious
business in these parts.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
232
Becoming a wine connoisseur: The basics
Cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, and zinfandel grapes (grown for red wines), and
chardonnay and sauvignon or fumé blanc grapes (grown for white wines), are the
most prominent grape varieties produced in the area. Telling the difference between
them takes a great deal of knowledge. Each one of these varieties contains identifiable
flavors and aromas you can only begin to recognize through careful sipping.
Reading the label on the bottle is the best way to tell the difference between caber-
net and pinot. The label identifies the type of grape used if the wine contains at least
75 percent of that variety, among other bits of information. The appellation of origin
indicates where the grapes were grown. The label may state that the grapes were
grown in either a viticulture area, such as the Carneros region of the Napa Valley, in
a certain county, or just in the state itself. Check the vintage date as well, which
explains when at least 95 percent of the grapes were crushed. Also make a note of the
vintage date, because many wines taste better aged, and some years produce better
grapes than others.

Napa Valley
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 233

Start in Calistoga and work your way down the valley along Highway 29
to make your return to San Francisco a bit shorter. But don’t take this
drive on a summer weekend. The bumper-to-bumper traffic on Highway
29 will ruin your day.
Beaulieu Vineyard
At this well-regarded, hospitable establishment, the vintners pass out
glasses of sauvignon blanc as you walk in, to get you in the right mood.
After you’ve enjoyed a glass, you can take a free half-hour tour of the pro-
duction facility, open daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each tasting thereafter
is $5, or $25 for five delicious reserve vintages.
1960 St. Helena Hwy. (Highway 29), Rutherford, CA 94573. % 800-264-6918 or
707-967-5230. www.bvwines.com. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Clos Pegase
The official tour takes only about 30 minutes and is offered at 11 a.m. and
2 p.m. You can spend the rest of your time at this winery joyfully studying
the art collection, walking around the sculpture garden, or picnicking on
the vast lawn. You need to reserve a picnic table, but reservations aren’t
required for the complimentary tour. Wine tasting is $2.50 for current
releases and $2 each for reserve wines.
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
234
Wine tasting do’s and don’ts
When you taste wines, keep in mind the following suggestions and you’ll fit right in —
even if it’s your first time:
 Before the pour, sniff your glass. It should have a clean aroma.
 Do not pour the wine yourself. Winery staff will pour it for you.
 Taste wines in the appropriate order. Whites first, reds second, and dessert wines
last.
 Swirl the wine to coat the inside of the glass. Swirling introduces more oxygen
and helps open up the wine flavors and aromas.
 Smell the wine. Notice the different aromas — spice, fruit, flowers.
 Take a sip and cover the back of your tongue with the wine.
 Taste, then spit. Wine tasting is one of the few sports where spitting is not only
allowed, it’s encouraged. (Just make sure you hit your target, a bucket, or some
other container available for this purpose.) Tasting, then spitting, is also a nifty
way to sample many wines without becoming cloudy-headed.
 Do not bring a bottle of wine from one winery into another.

Darioush
A Persian palace (think Persepolis) in Napa? No, you haven’t had one too
many, you’ve found Darioush. This eye-catching — to say the least —
building, clad in travertine stone mined in Iran, opened in 2004; the winery
itself has been producing since 1997. Tastings are offered of course ($15 for
a flight of four wines), but tours must be arranged in advance and I’d make
the call if only to drool over Darioush Khaledi’s private wine cellar. If it’s
available, try the 2004 signature Chardonnay, which has an amazing pear-
ish, creamy consistency from start to finish. Saturdays through Thursday
a wine and cheese tasting is offered ($35) and every Friday is a cheese
intensive featuring Cowgirl Creamery’s best ($65). A tip from one of the
staff is to try and avoid visiting on a Saturday in the summer. The valley is
lots calmer during the week.

Robert Mondavi
Mondavi was the first winery to conduct public tastings, and it continues
to take pride in educating people about wine. A menu of tours is offered,
from the daily 75-minute To Kalon tour at $25 a pop (% 888-RMONDAVI,
ext. 82001, for same-day reservations) to a $100 Harvest of Joy tour that
includes a three-course lunch. For fees ranging from $50 to $110, you can
benefit from seminars on grape growing, essence tasting, and wine and
food pairing. Reservations are required for tours and seminars. During July
and August, you can catch a Saturday evening concert. The shows sell out
quickly, so call % 888-769-5299 or visit Mondavi’s Web site for a schedule
and tickets.

interactive tour featuring “SmellaVision.” You’ll also hear about growing
techniques at the winery’s demonstration vineyard. Have $10 on hand 
for the tasting fee. On the weekends, you can get a half glass of the really
good stuff in the Divine Wine room (the reserve tasting room) for $15. 
A Winemaker’s tour and tasting is now offered for $45 per person at 1 p.m.

Sterling
Arrive at this hilltop winery by aerial tram and swoon over the spectacu-
lar vista. Wine tasting is included in the ticket price of $15 ($20 weekends
and holidays; $10 for under 21s). After you reach the winery, take the self-
guided tour that leads you through the entire operation and into the tast-
ing room, where the friendly staff serves you wine at tables rather than at
a bar. For grander palates, a $45 reserve tasting and guided tour is offered
at 11 a.m. daily. Plan on spending at least one hour here.

Wineries in Sonoma Valley
The Sonoma Valley includes the towns of Sonoma, Glen Ellen, and
Kenwood and is frequented a bit less than the Napa Valley because of its
smaller size. Day-trippers may enjoy the relaxed, more intimate atmos-
phere of Sonoma Valley. You can drive here in just over an hour, tour a
few wineries, shop, have a great meal, and be back in the city — traffic
willing — in time for dinner. You may choose to spend the night, in
which case you can find many B&Bs and hotels, plus a few resorts sprin-
kled around the country roads.
Enter the Sonoma Valley by Highway 121; then turn north on Highway 12.
This path takes you directly into the charming town of Sonoma. (If you
want to go directly to Glen Ellen, take Highway 116 instead.)
This tour includes stops at some smaller wineries that are too delicious
to miss; all provide a little wine education and tastings. You’ll see coun-
try roads bedecked by acres of grapes, old oaks, and flowers. And
although the destinations are noteworthy, the drive alone is splendid.
Arrowood
Arrowood is an intimate, high-end, and somewhat exclusive winery with a
small production but national distribution. You need to make an appoint-
ment for daily tours of 40 to 90 minutes in duration at fees from $20 to $30.
Call a day or two in advance. If you don’t care for a tour, you can still sit
on the verandah overlooking grapevines and mountains and try some
great wines. There is a $3 tasting fee.

Benziger
Tractor-pulled trams take visitors up the flower-lined path of this 85-acre
ranch for a 45-minute tram tour ($10; reservations required). The winery,
owned by the Benziger family since 1981, is situated near Jack London
State Park. The tram operators enthusiastically explain how vines work,
how insects are controlled, and how the sun and soil together affect the

taste of the wine. You can choose from two tasting opportunities, one of
which is complimentary; the other which costs $10 for the reserve wines.

com. Take Highway 12 to Arnold Drive and turn left on London Ranch Road. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
B.R. Cohn
Cohn’s remodeled tasting room, gift shop, and new picnic area flanked by
olive trees are just down the road from Arrowood. Tasting fees are a
modest $5 for current releases and $10 for limited release wines, including
the signature 2002 Olive Hill Estate Cabernet. Along with the wines, some
of which are only available at the winery, the olive oil produced here is of
the highest quality and makes a great gift. Friendly staff members who are
happy to talk wine and olives preside over the relaxed tasting room.
Doobie Brothers music plays on the speakers and is available in the gift
shop because owner Bruce Cohn is their manager.

Moon Mountain Vineyard
A long drive up the mountain rewards with stunning views and some deli-
cious organic estate wines only available on-site. You must make an
appointment to visit, but the phone call is well worth the effort. The tast-
ing room is inside a turret, too intimate to accommodate the busloads that
reach more accessible wineries. You’ll have a chance to ask questions
while touring the tank room and caves or tasting the Bordeaux-style offer-
ings. Fellow tasters are likely to be serious wine students who have sought
out what is one of the less ostentatious yet sophisticated wineries in either
Napa or Sonoma. The tasting fee is just $10.
1700 Moon Mountain Rd., Sonoma, CA 95476. % 707-996-5870. www.moon
mountainvineyard.com. Take Highway 12 toward Glen Ellen. Moon Mountain
Road is between Agua Caliente and Madrone roads. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
by appointment.
Robledo Family Winery
The modest little tasting room here, comfortably furnished with handsome
pieces from Michoacan, Mexico, epitomizes old-fashioned American suc-
cess stories. Reynaldo Robledo, Senior, who arrived in the valley as a 
16-year-old migrant worker, combined hard work and a gift for nurturing
grape vines into ownership of three vineyards, a vineyard management
company, and this winery. His children are actively involved in the busi-
ness, and you’ll meet at least one behind the bar, pouring tastes of their
estate Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. A small pro-
ducer, the majority of the bottles are sold directly to consumers through
their wine club or at the winery.

Taking advantage of other fun stuff in the valleys
Wine Country offers many other activities besides wine tasting. If you’re
staying overnight, be sure to check out the following sites, sports, and
downright sumptuous pleasures in Napa and Sonoma.
Napa excursions
Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food, and the Arts, 500 First St.,
Napa (% 707-259-1600; www.copia.org), opened in the fall of 2001 and
has quickly become one of the must-see attractions in the valley. Copia
celebrates the finer things in life in a modern museum-like setting, but
it’s neither solemn nor overly reverential. One permanent exhibit, an
interactive presentation on the role of food and wine in American soci-
ety, is accessible and amusing. In addition, there’s a state-of-the-art 
theater for concerts, lectures, and films; a full roster of wine and food
courses are offered year-round; and a 500-seat concert terrace overlook-
ing the Napa River, surrounded by Copia’s orchard and organic gardens,
provides warm-weather amusement. A fine restaurant, Julia’s Kitchen
(open for lunch Wed–Mon and dinner Thurs–Sun), wine bar, and, of
course, a gift shop round out the experience. Check the Web site for pro-
gramming during your trip, and try to take in an exhibit, a class, a con-
cert, or a meal — all four if time allows. Admission is $5 adults, $4
seniors and students, free for children 12 and under. It’s open daily 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. except Tuesdays.
Art turns up in the most unexpected places, but none more so than the
di Rosa Preserve (% 707-226-5991, ext. 25; www.dirosapreserve.org).
This is a 217-acre indoor/outdoor gallery located 61⁄2 miles west of Napa
on Highway 121, displaying over 2,000 works amid meadows, hanging
from trees, and throughout the former winery. Rene di Rosa, a former
journalist and viticulturist, owns the property. Guides conduct one-hour
introductory and two-and-a-half-hour tours Tuesday through Saturday
(reservations required); admission is $10 and $15.
Ride horseback through the countryside with the help of the Sonoma
Cattle Company and Napa Valley Trail Rides (% 707-255-2900; www.
napasonomatrailrides.com). The one-person stable with just four,
well-nurtured horses, offers two-hour rides on Thursdays and Sundays
at 10 a.m. through Skyline Wilderness State Park, 2201 Imola Ave. off
Highway 29. Rides, which include 30 minutes of instruction, are $90 and
available for adults and kids 8 years old and up. Soaring over the vine-
yards under a colorful balloon, with just a few other souls sharing your
basket, is a breathtaking experience. Bonaventura Balloon Company
(% 800-FLY-NAPA or 707-944-2822; www.bonaventuraballoons.com) 
is one of Napa’s most trusted operators, with a range of packages from
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 239

$198 per person. Or call Napa Valley Aloft/Adventures Aloft (% 800-
944-4408 or 707-944-4408; www.nvaloft.com), whose early-morning lift-
off includes a preflight snack and a postflight brunch with bubbly.
However, at $195 to $250 per person (depending on the number of per-
sons and the extras you choose), you may decide to keep those feet on
the ground.
If you want to join the many bicyclists you see pedaling Napa’s scenic
roads, St. Helena Cyclery, 1156 Main St., St. Helena (% 707-963-7736;
www.sthelenacyclery.com), will set you on the Silverado Trail for $10
per hour or $30 per day. Getaway Adventures BHK (Biking, Hiking, and
Kayaking), 1117 Lincoln Ave., Calistoga (% 800-499-BIKE or 707-942-
0332), runs day trips with lunch and winery tours.
Wind down after a busy day with a mud bath. People have been immers-
ing themselves in Calistoga mud for more than 150 years, but if you’re
prone to claustrophobia, get a massage only. You can reserve a tub and a
follow-up massage at Dr. Wilkinson’s Hot Springs, 1507 Lincoln Ave. 
(% 707-942-4102; www.drwilkinson.com); Indian Springs Resort 
and Spa, 1712 Lincoln Ave. (% 707-942-4913; www.indiansprings
calistoga.com); or Calistoga Spa Hot Springs, 1006 Washington St. 
(% 707-942-6269). A mud bath and 50-minute massage is $175 at Indian
Springs, and you get use of the pool.
Hop on the city of Napa’s free downtown trolley for a 40-minute tour or a
ride to Copia, the local outlet mall, or other stops. Trolley routes and
times vary by day. Monday through Wednesday trolleys run every 45
minutes from 11 a.m. to 7:53 p.m. On Thursday through Saturday, two
trolley loops operate every 30 minutes: the Red Loop runs from 11 a.m.
to 7:57 p.m., and the Green Loop runs from 11:15 a.m. to 8:12 p.m. On
Sundays the trolley runs every 45 minutes from 11 a.m. to 7:53 p.m. Find
a trolley stop at 1st and Main streets. Call % 707-255-7631 for more info.
Sonoma activities
Massage therapists abound in the valley, many of whom were well
trained at the California Institute of Massage and Spa Services, 772 W.
Napa St. (% 707-939-9431), located near the Sonoma Plaza. This is not a
fancy facility, but the treatment rooms are comfortable, clean, and quiet.
A 60-minute therapeutic massage is currently $75.
Olives are also an important crop in Wine Country, and olive oil tastings
have become a popular activity. You can debate the merits of various
extra-virgin olive oils in Glen Ellen at The Olive Press, 14301 Arnold Dr.
(% 888-965-4839 or 707-939-8900; www.theolivepress.com). The press
runs 24 hours between October and March. Watch the process from the
tasting room while sampling award-winning olive oil and browsing olive-
themed merchandise.
Jack London State Historic Park, 2400 London Ranch Rd. (% 707-938-
5216; www.jacklondonpark.com), is where the prolific author of The
Part IV: Exploring San Francisco 
240

Call of the Wild lived before his death in 1916 at age 40. You can walk on
trails to the ruins of Wolf House, London Lake, and Bath House, and visit
the museum/library, which displays first editions of London’s works and
some of his personal memorabilia. Open daily from 9:30 a.m. to dusk.
The park charges a $6-per-vehicle entrance fee.
The Goodtime Touring Co. (% 888-525-0453 or 707-938-0453; www.
goodtimetouring.com) meets customers off the Sonoma Plaza to
embark on guided four-and-a-half-hour picnic/winery rides for $99,
which includes lunch and tasting fees. Bike rentals alone are also avail-
able for $25 per day.
If you have an intense interest in food, sign up for a three- to four-hour
class at Ramekins, 450 W. Spain St., Sonoma (% 707-933-0450), a small
B&B and culinary school next to the General’s Daughter restaurant.
During the day, take in the demonstration classes; then in the evening,
glean culinary tips from some major Bay Area chefs. Students have lots
of opportunities to sample the goods with a few glasses of wine. Call for
a catalog. You can register over the phone, in person, or on the Web at
www.ramekins.com.
Spending the night
Although country inns and bed-and-breakfasts interspersed with spas
and motels are sprinkled throughout both valleys, supply and demand
keep the room rates and the occupancy on the high side. Even if you
plan to look for a hotel in San Francisco at the last minute, you need to
make reservations in the Wine Country as far in advance as possible,
especially for stays between May and October. Most lodgings have a
two-night minimum on the weekends during the high season. The good
news: Parking is free at all the accommodations I list in this section.
Here is a breakdown of what the dollar signs represent in the following
hotel listings (Note: This is a slightly different scale from San Francisco
proper.):
 $: Under $150
 $$: $151 to $225
 $$$: $226 to $300
 $$$$: Over $300
Finding a substantial and well-prepared meal won’t be as hard as finding
a room, although you still need to make reservations. Some great chefs
have settled their lives and businesses around the valleys, perhaps real-
izing that well-to-do tourists and urbanites with second homes love to
eat out. Eating out is also one of the few evening activities in Wine
Country — there’s not much else to do after 10 p.m.

Daughter’s Inn
$$$–$$$$
Napa
Downtown Napa has a good selection of B&Bs in converted Victorians,
with this family-run inn among the best. It’s a smart choice for couples
seeking a little romance, but who also want a location that’s close to
restaurants and whatever nightlife is available in the revitalized town of
Napa. Daughter’s Inn has a total of ten individually designed TV-free
rooms, five in the mansion and five in a slightly more private new building
in the garden. The focal points in all are the cushy beds and in-room
Jacuzzis (heart-shaped in the Poppy suite), just so you understand in what
direction you’re headed. In the heat of the summer, a more resortlike hotel
with a pool would probably be preferable, but in snuggling weather,
Daughter’s Inn provides nearly everything you need.

This Tudor-inspired complex was renovated in 1999, making all the rooms

20 new rooms have been added. Two pools and two Jacuzzis are set in
lovely gardens against a dramatic backdrop of mountains and vineyards.

Each of these comfortable, old-fashioned bungalows has a kitchen with a

bench seats and awnings) and Ping-Pong tables for guests to use. Lounge
chairs surround a warm, Olympic-size mineral pool. The spa, which is
located in a bathhouse from 1913, offers a full range of services with 
experienced practitioners. Booking a bungalow in the summer isn’t easy,
but try edging out the families who come here year after year by calling 
48 hours ahead to find out whether you can get in on a cancellation.

Cushy, chic, and romantic, the airy, large rooms in this intimate new inn

private; you’ll find it difficult to tear yourself away, although many excel-
lent small wineries await along the Silverado Trail.

This big, attractive French-country inn is conveniently situated near some
of the finest restaurants in the valley. Recently refurbished in a French
Renaissance décor, rooms are clustered throughout the lovely flowering
grounds and are equipped with fireplaces, fridges, Jacuzzi tubs, and cof-
feemakers. Tennis courts and a heated pool make this a comfortable mini-
resort, good for couples exploring the area. Spa services are available next
door at the Villagio, the sister inn. Check for specials and packages, which
can make this a relative bargain.

El Pueblo Inn
$–$$$
Sonoma
Here’s a lovable, way-better-than-average motel almost within walking dis-
tance of the Sonoma Plaza, and very well located for touring. Family-owned
and -run, it has a really nice vibe, supported by very comfortable, spacious
rooms in the buildings closest to reception. (The corner units there have
fireplaces.) Guest rooms in the original two-story building in the back are
less expensive given that the bathrooms are older and smaller. A pretty
garden and pool sit next to a shaded patio and fitness room; it could get
noisy in the summer as the property is right along Highway 12. If I had the
kids along, I’d stay here without question. And if I was seeking affordable
lodgings, ditto.

Inn at Sonoma
$$–$$$
Sonoma
This attractive, three-year-old Four Sisters Inn offers terrific value for
money. Public and guest rooms are graciously decorated, smartly main-
tained, and include a generous breakfast, afternoon happy hour, and cookies.
With just 19 rooms, you’ll get as much attention as you require from the
staff, although actually obtaining a room in summer will take advanced
planning as this is a popular hotel for wedding parties. Less than 2 blocks
from the Sonoma Plaza, the location makes walking to dinner a simple
treat. For romantic occasions, I’d prefer a more secluded and luxurious
hideaway such as the Kenwood Inn or Milliken Creek; otherwise, a room
here more than satisfies.

Kenwood Inn and Spa
$$$$
Kenwood
If price is no object, or you want an all-out splurge, this gorgeous inn —
reminiscent of villas on the Italian Riviera — is my pick over any hotel in
either valley. The faux-painted buildings appear almost miragelike as you
drive up the Sonoma Highway, the pale yellow stucco blending into the
landscape on a sunny day. When you step inside, you’ll have no desire 
to leave. Rooms are fitted with wood-burning fireplaces, feather beds, 
sensuous fabrics, and the facilities — an inviting saline pool, a separately

overlook vineyards — guarantee a feeling of sublime, luxurious seclusion.

MacArthur Place
$$$$
Sonoma
This divine small hotel is a renovated Victorian connected to newer build-
ings. The rooms are spacious and comfy, with four-poster beds that’ll make
you think twice about getting up. Contented guests relax at the small, well-
staffed spa where the practiced hands of a masseuse work out pre-vacation
tension. Manicured gardens surround a swimming pool, and a steakhouse
restaurant in the 100-year-old barn supplies room service.

Sonoma Chalet
$$–$$$
Sonoma
Although all you see from this Swiss-inspired farmhouse inn are mountains
and the ranch next door, it’s located less than a mile from the Sonoma town
square. Antiques and collectibles decorate the three delightful, spacious
cottages. Inside the farmhouse, the upstairs rooms have private facilities,
while the two downstairs rooms share a bathroom. The simple and deli-
cious breakfast includes fresh pastries.

Dining in the valleys
Wine tasting certainly isn’t the only reason to make the drive from San
Francisco to Wine Country: The food here is sublime. Picking and choos-
ing which dining rooms to include below almost hurt, but someone has
to make the tough decisions. I tend to lean toward the places locals sup-
port, as tourist-oriented restaurants don’t expect to see you again. (And
if you’re wondering why French Laundry is missing, it’s because reserva-
tions are nearly impossible to get.)

FRENCH BISTRO
Napa is experiencing a major growth spurt in hotels and especially restau-
rants, none with more to recommend it than this warm, casual brasserie
overlooking the Napa River. Part of the historic Hatt Building development,
Chapter 14: Going Above and Beyond San Francisco 245

Angèle serves typical French fare as interpreted by a chef with access to
the bounty of Northern California. My perfectly cooked Pavé de Boeuf
Haché (yes, a hamburger) may not have been the most challenging selec-
tion, but it sure hit the spot one winter evening when a heavier meal would
only have led to gout. My dining companions ate every scrap of their suc-
culent pan-seared scallops and a tender veal stew. A high level of profes-
sionalism at every level makes this spot a standout.

Bistro Don Giovanni

Napa
ITALIAN/COUNTRY FRENCH
Share a pizza, some antipasti, and a bottle of chardonnay for a delightful,
light Italian meal, or go all out with the porterhouse for two. This inviting
place, easily the most popular restaurant in the valley for all the right rea-
sons, attracts a crowd that gathers at tables on the porch overlooking vine-
yards. It’s heavenly.

Bistro Jeanty
$$$
Yountville
FRENCH BISTRO
Much applauded around the Bay Area for its menu, authenticity, and viva-
cious dining room, this French bistro satisfies both the appetite and the
spirit. Rustic dishes like lamb tongue and potato salad or rabbit and sweet-
bread ragout make up the seasonal menu. Both timid and adventurous
eaters can find something to suit them, with typical bistro items such as
steak frites and coq au vin also available.

Bounty Hunter

Napa
AMERICAN
Foremost a wine shop, the wealth of bottles available to pair with the first-
rate southwestern-influenced cooking pretty much obviates the need to
ever drive Highway 29 again. Surrounded by the best wines available, your
other difficult choice will be what to eat — the grilled whole chicken
stuffed with Tecate beer? The barbecued ribs, smoky and succulent? A
plate groaning with artisan cheeses and meats? This cozy former grocery
in downtown Napa knows how to elevate dining into a rousing good time.

Cindy’s Backstreet Kitchen
$$
St. Helena
CALIFORNIA
Cindy Pawlcyn (of Mustards Grill fame) opened this smaller, more low-key
eatery in 2001. Given that St. Helena gets its fair share of weekend wine
tasters, it’s a testament to her sensibility how much this two-story house
feels like a neighborhood hangout. A table in the garden is the ideal spot
for a Cobb salad or curried chicken and something cold (there’s a full bar
as well as fresh juice drinks). In the evening, small plates, such as rabbit
tostados or Piquillo peppers stuffed with cumin-scented beef seem made
for a local lager. Large plates include specials from the wood-burning oven,
fish of the day, and steak frites that’ll have you hunkered over your dish.
Use one of Cindy’s root beer floats, featuring housemade vanilla ice cream,
to teach kids the difference between ordinary and extraordinary.

Chef-owner Sally Gordon’s delicious food is served in a congenial atmos-
phere reminiscent of a general store. Besides comfort-food favorites at
breakfast and creative sandwiches at lunch, Gordon’s serves a three-
course prix-fixe dinner on Friday nights, making the cafe a prime destina-
tion for food lovers. Don’t be discouraged if there’s a line for breakfast;
just get in it.

Tra Vigne
$$$
St. Helena
CLASSIC ITALIAN
This elegant (but not stuffy) restaurant is what people dream of when they
dream of eating in the Italian countryside. You have two choices where to
take your meal — either the more formal dining room inside or outside on
the lovely courtyard patio (probably the better spot if the kids are with
you). The Cantinetta delicatessen is the place to pick up wine and pre-
pared foods to eat at the bar or to take on a picnic. Nearby at 1016 Main
St. is Tra Vigne Pizzeria, a favorite with local families craving spaghetti
and meatballs or thin-crusted pizzas in a more casual setting.

Wappo Bar Bistro
$$$
Calistoga
INTERNATIONAL
I like this pair of restaurants off the main drag for an unusual menu that
spans a good part of the globe. Start an international culinary tour with
spiced chickpea fritters and Vietnamese spring rolls, and then head to
South America with a Brazilian seafood stew, layered with flavors, or opt
for a soft landing in Italy over some tender osso buco. Wappo also serves
on a pretty patio that lies in between its two storefronts. A glass of white
wine, the Turkish mezze (appetizers) plate, and a table in the warmth of a
Napa Valley afternoon defines one version of happiness.

Cafe La Haye
$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA
This casual little cafe serves some of the best food around and, unlike
many other Wine Country restaurants, it makes no attempt to pretend it’s
in Italy or France. Plain tables and chairs are carefully set about, as if to not
disturb the art that fills the walls, making La Haye’s single room resemble
a gallery. The menu selection, spare but complete, features whatever’s sea-
sonal and offers organic produce. The daily risotto is fabulous, but you
can’t go wrong no matter what you order.

Deuce
$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA
With so many valley restaurants and chefs vying for attention, I think that
Deuce, a popular stop for county residents, gets overlooked by travelers.
Inside the yellow Craftsman-style house, which sits on the main road head-
ing toward Sonoma Plaza, you’ll be treated to especially friendly service
and well-prepared food that doesn’t require any translation. Lots of diners
(especially those who want dessert) make do with a couple of starters, in
particular the tender/crispy calamari or the irresistible lobster pot pie.
For mains, the smart money is on the thick, perfectly grilled pork chop,
although it’s hard to pass up the cassoulet. Kids are welcome here, and
the kitchen will prepare something to their liking if you ask.

Get a modest plate of bacon and eggs and lunch to go, or a tasty, filling
breakfast that keeps you going most of the day. This is a completely unpre-

lots of egg dishes to choose from — hold the housebaked breads. Well,
maybe not — these are especially fine.

adding outdoor dining to the delight of its admirers. The seasonal menu

cheese is a must-order when fresh figs are available.

Ledson’s Harmony Restaurant
$$$
Sonoma
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
You can’t miss this new restaurant/hotel on Sonoma’s square, although
the designers did such a great job blending the new building with the old
architecture that it looks as though it’s always been here. A hotel dining-
room sensibility seems at odds with the casual Wine Country atmosphere
everywhere else — when I ate here, servers were lined up by the kitchen
door, and the plates of tasty food were self-conscious in their presentation.
But with a pianist nightly and a vocalist weekends, Harmony has definitely
enlivened the town. Six marble-bathed bedrooms above the restaurant are
worthy of sensitive royalty and priced accordingly.

Living It Up after

B
ecause San Francisco contains such a diverse populace
to begin with, no single form of entertainment has come
to be associated with the city in the same way that jazz is
mentioned in the same breath as New Orleans or theater with
New York. Instead, San Francisco offers an eclectic mix of
dance, music, performance art, theater, and opera, with
plenty to choose from on any given night. If you shun any-
thing requiring a trip to a box ofﬁce, you can choose from
plenty of bars and clubs to keep you off the streets until the
wee hours.
Even travelers with kids don’t have to limit after-hours activi-
ties to dinner and a movie. A few clubs offer shows for
patrons of all ages, featuring local alternative or blues bands.
(Your kid will think you’re very special.) A night at the theater
is also a great family alternative; you can usually ﬁnd some-
thing that appeals to people of all ages.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter
 Finding out what’s going on in town when you’re here

W
hether you’re up for world-class classical music or experimental
theater, and pretty much everything in between, you can find it
on stage in San Francisco. In this chapter, I give you the overall picture
and then detail how to find out what’s going on and score tickets.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Performing-arts fans can find plenty of interesting offerings in San
Francisco. For drama, there’s a bit of the tried and true when Broadway
road companies drop into town, and our own American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) regularly produces works that are visually inspired and
well acted. Opera is just as vibrant. Although the great Enrico Caruso
never returned to San Francisco after the shock of the 1906 earthquake,
plenty of other stars have aria’d their way through town, raising the
local opera company to world-class heights. The SF Symphony is in a
similar league, and while I’m bragging, I’d better mention the ballet. It,
too, is as fine a company as you’ll see anywhere. But don’t let the big
brands sway you from trying stages outside the Civic Center, including
Yerba Buena Gardens, and smaller venues south of Market where experi-
mental theater abounds.

Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
On the Web you can search sites such as Citysearch (www.sanfrancisco.
citysearch.com) and the San Francisco Chronicle (www.sfgate.
com/listings) for reviews and synopses; otherwise, follow your
instincts (and local recommendations) when you get here. You may
stumble onto something wonderful. If you’re looking for something out-
side the mainstream (and this is a fine place to find that), a month or so
before your trip sign up for the e-mail list Flavorpill SF (sf.flavorpill.
net). This free weekly e-mail highlights the more-elusive cultural events
gracing the town, including films, concerts, and theater.
Here are a few other Web sites to check out for what’s happening now:
 www.sfbg.com: You can find the Bay Guardian’s complete enter-
tainment listings online. Try this one first.
 www.sanfran.com: San Francisco, our very own monthly magazine,
is chock-full of arts and entertainment information.
 www.sfweekly.com: This is the Web site for SF Weekly, another
great lefty publication with provocative features, lots of local info,
and reviews.
For tickets to any theater, dance, symphony, or concert performance,
you can call the appropriate box office directly or head online and order
with a credit card (charges are nonrefundable if, for some reason, you
don’t show up). Around Civic Center, City Box Office, 180 Redwood St.,
Suite 100 (% 415-392-4400; www.cityboxoffice.com), sells tickets to
shows playing at the Nob Hill Masonic Center, Project Artaud Theater,
Herbst Theatre, and other lesser-known stages. If you arrive in town
without plans, visit TIX Bay Area (% 415-433-7827; www.theatrebay
area.org/tix) for half-price tickets for same-day performances (a $1–$3
service charge is tacked on). TIX, which is also a BASS Ticketmaster
outlet, is located on Union Square between Post and Geary streets. It’s
open Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday and
Saturday until 7 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Don’t buy tickets from anyone outside TIX or a box office claiming to
have discounted or scalper tickets, especially to sporting events. Folks
get duped all the time, forking over real cash for counterfeit tickets.
Another common scam is to sell tickets to an event that has already
taken place.
The concierge at your hotel can be a source for hard-to-get tickets. The
larger the hotel, the more likely it is that the concierge will be success-
ful, but in any case, it’s worth asking. If he does manage to come
through, a $5 to $10 tip is appropriate, thanks.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
254

If you’re flexible about your plans for the evening, go to the box office of
the theater you want to attend and stand in line for last-minute cancella-
tions by season-ticket holders or the release of tickets held for media or
VIPs. With luck, you can land seats in the orchestra. Without luck, you’ll
have wasted an hour or so.
Don’t be late to the theater, symphony, or opera. Curtains rise on time,
and if you’re late, you won’t be seated until there’s a break in the action.
If you’re attending a show at the Geary Theater, avoid the boxes on
either side. They’re positioned to obscure half the stage, generally the
half where the action takes place.
As for what to wear, you’ll see a little of everything, from tailored
evening clothes to jeans. People seem to dress up a bit more Friday and
Saturday nights, especially in the orchestra seats, but your Sunday best
isn’t necessary.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Cable cars will get you to Union Square theaters if you’re coming from
North Beach; from the Marina or Union Street, take a 30-Stockton or 
45-Union/Stockton bus. If you prefer to take a cab to your lodgings after-
ward, walk to a big hotel to catch one. You can find a number of parking
garages near Union Square with fees beginning at $10 for the evening.
You can reach the Civic Center, where the opera, ballet, and symphony
are located, by any Muni Metro streetcar or any bus along Van Ness
Avenue. I wouldn’t walk around this area unescorted after dark to get
back to the Muni station, and taxis aren’t always immediately available.

If you feel stuck, walk to one of the many nearby restaurants and ask the
host to call a taxi for you. Relax, and prepare to wait a while at the bar. If
you’re driving, you can park in the garage on Grove Street between
Franklin and Gough streets.
South of Market and Mission neighborhood venues have troubles similar
to Civic Center. You can usually get to the performance by public trans-
portation, but returning late at night by bus is less interesting (or per-
haps more interesting, depending on your perspective). Again, if you’re
attending a show in this area, don’t expect to automatically hail a cab
afterward. Instead, walk to a nearby restaurant or bar and call. These
numbers for local cab companies can help:
 Desoto Cab: % 415-970-1300
 Luxor Cabs: % 415-282-4141
 Pacific: % 415-986-7220
 Veteran’s Cab: % 415-648-1313
 Yellow Cab: % 415-626-2345
I would never seriously compare our little theater district to the Great
White Way in New York, but San Francisco has a fair number of profes-
sional stages. At least ten in varying sizes are housed around Union
Square, and experimental theaters are scattered about the South of
Market and Mission districts in converted warehouses and gallery
spaces. Productions may include a musical or two, distinguished clas-
sics, and world-premiere comedies and dramas.
The American Conservatory Theater (ACT) is the preeminent company
in town and produces a wide variety of plays during its season, which
runs October to June. The acting is first-rate, and the costumes and sets
are universally brilliant. The choice of material ranges from new works
by playwrights such as Tom Stoppard, can’t-lose American chestnuts,
and Shakespeare, all the way to not-quite-ready-for-prime-time dramas
that still receive a careful rendering. The lovely Geary Theater is home
to ACT productions. You’ll find it at 415 Geary St., at Mason Street 
(% 415-749-2228; www.act-sfbay.org). Ticket prices range from $35
to $80, and the box office is open every day from 10 a.m.
Broadway hits and road shows appear down the block at the Curran
Theater, 445 Geary St., between Mason and Taylor streets (% 415-551-
2000; www.bestofbroadway-sf.com); the Golden Gate Theater, 1
Golden Gate Ave., at Market Street; and the Orpheum, 1192 Market St., at
Eighth Street. The phone number listed for the Curran Theater is shared
by all three venues, and the recorded message explains what’s playing,
where to buy tickets, and how to get to the theaters.
You may like your theater a little more cutting-edge. If so, check out The
Magic Theatre at Fort Mason Center, Bldg. A (% 415-441-8822; www.
magictheatre.org), where David Mamet premiered his adaptation 
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
258

of Dr. Faustus. Tickets range from $26 to $52. Or try Intersection for 
the Arts, a 72-seat performance space in the Mission District at 446
Valencia St., between 15th and 16th streets (% 415-626-3311; www.the
intersection.org). You won’t find anything traditional here in their
exhibits, literary series, music, or interdisciplinary works of art. Ticket
prices run between $9 and $15.
The Magic Theatre sets aside a limited number of tickets for “Sliding
Scale” Tuesdays. Prices range from $5–$25 and reservations aren’t
accepted; it’s first-come, first-served at the box office (open: Tues–Sat
noon–5 p.m.), cash only.
The Lorraine Hansberry Theatre, 620 Sutter St. (% 415-474-8800; www.
lorrainehansberrytheatre.com), features dramas and musicals by
black authors past and present such as Langston Hughes and August
Wilson. Ticket prices are $25 to $32. If you are in town the month of
December, don’t miss the holiday gospel show, Black Nativity.
Another Union Square stage is tucked inside the building that houses 
the Kensington Park Hotel at 450 Post St. The Post Street Theatre, for-
merly Theatre on the Square, opened with the rock ’n’ roll musical
Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story. You can find out what’s playing next on the
Web site www.poststreettheatre.com or by contacting the box office
at % 415-771-6900. Marines’ Memorial Theatre, located on the second
floor of the Marines’ Memorial Club, 609 Sutter St. (% 415-771-6900;
www.marinesmemorialtheatre.com), similar in size and flavor to the
Post Street Theatre, presents small off-Broadway shows and new pro-
ductions, most recently the premiere of a musical based on the life of
Janis Joplin.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 259
Pre- and post-theater dining
You have plenty of dining choices before attending any 8 p.m. performance. After the
show, however, your dining choices are somewhat more limited. On Union Square, a
branch of The Cheesecake Factory has arrived on the eighth floor of Macy’s. It’s open
until 11 p.m. The Grand Cafe (reviewed in Chapter 10) also serves until 11 p.m. from a
bar menu. If you’re attending an event around Civic Center and want to eat before the
show, be sure to make reservations. The Hayes Street Grill (reviewed in Chapter 10)
originally opened to accommodate the culture crowd, and this restaurant has been
joined by a great many more on and around Hayes Street. Down around Yerba Buena
Center, Bacar, 448 Brannan, between Third and Fourth streets (% 415-904-4100), has
the most extensive wine list around and serves tempting dishes like wok-cooked
Maine lobster. XYZ at the W Hotel, 181 Third St., at Howard (% 415-817-7836), has a
cafe as well as a restaurant, so you can go casual or upscale, depending on how
quickly you need to eat.

Close to Civic Center, in an impressive former Masonic Temple built in
1911, is the New Conservatory Theater (NCT) complex at 25 Van Ness
Ave., a half block off Market Street (% 415-861-8972; www.nctcsf.org).
NCT, which consists of three small theaters, presents a variety of pro-
ductions throughout the year. From April through August is “Pride
Season,” during which a series of six plays with gay themes is pre-
sented. NTC also produces children’s theater programming all year long.
Admirers of musical theater should keep an eye out for productions by
42nd Street Moon. This company presents long-forgotten American
musicals in concert format and gives audiences an opportunity to hear
delightfully clever tunes that somehow “disappeared.” Check the Web
site (www.42ndstmoon.org) for shows and dates. Productions take
place at the Eureka Theatre, 215 Jackson St., at Battery in the Financial
District (% 415-978-2787).
Symphony and Opera
San Francisco has many venues for listening to classical music. Local
papers and Web sites are your best source for event listings. You can see
major groups such as the San Francisco Symphony, which performs in
the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, 201 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street
(% 415-864-6000), in the Civic Center. The season runs from September
through July, and tickets cost $15 to $78. Also at Civic Center is the
Herbst Theater, 410 Van Ness Ave. (% 415-621-6600), home to San
Francisco Performances (www.sfperformances.org) and other profes-
sional groups.
You can also enjoy piano and violin duos, chamber music ensembles,
and singers at Old First Presbyterian Church, 1751 Sacramento St., at
Van Ness Avenue (% 415-474-1608; www.oldfirstconcerts.org).
These less-formal concerts are scheduled afternoons and evenings, and
tickets are a mere $12 to $15. The California Street cable car takes you to
within 2 blocks of the church. If you’re around Yerba Buena Gardens at
lunchtime on a Wednesday, head to St. Patrick’s Church, 756 Mission
St., which is the site for half-hour concerts produced by Noontime
Concerts (% 415-777-3211; www.noontimeconverts.org). These brief
shows may be solo or full orchestral performances. Admission is $5.
Noontime Concerts also uses the A.P. Giannini Auditorium at the Bank
of America headquarters, 555 California St., in the Financial District.
Concerts are currently held there on the second and fourth Tuesdays of
the month, but call for an updated schedule.
The San Francisco Opera opens its season with a gala in September and
ends quietly in early January. Performances are produced in the War
Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street (% 415-864-
3330), in the Civic Center. Tickets run from $25 to $235. Pocket Opera
(% 415-972-8934) delivers opera to the masses in stripped-down,

English-language versions that are quite entertaining and highly profes-
sional. The season begins in February and ends in June; productions are
held at different locations, including the Palace of the Legion of Honor,
so you’ll need to phone for a schedule or check the Web site (www.
pocketopera.org).
Dance
Plenty of classical and modern dance groups raise the barre in San
Francisco, the San Francisco Ballet being the best-known company.
Their season runs from February to June, and they perform in the 
War Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., at Grove Street. Call 
% 415-865-2000 for tickets. Prices run from $10 for standing room to
over $100 for orchestra seats. Students, seniors (68-plus), and military
personnel qualify for discounted same-day tickets, at $10 to $20. You can
check for availability by phoning the box office.

You’ll discover an adventurous season of modern dance, performance
art, and theater at the Project Artaud Theater, 450 Florida St., at 17th
Street (% 415-626-4370; www.artaud.org), in the Mission District.
Ticket prices are $20 or less, depending on the day and type of show.
Some of the most interesting dance companies, including Smuin Ballets/
SF, appear on stage at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 700 Howard
St. (% 415-978-2787; www.ybca.org). It’s easy to reach, and there are
many fine restaurants in the neighborhood for pre- or post-theater
supper.
New Langton Arts, a nonprofit, artist-run performance space in SoMa,
may have an art show, a theater performance, video pieces, or all three
at the same time — it’s experimental and won’t be mistaken for Beach
Blanket Babylon in any case. Check it out at 1246 Folsom St., between
Eighth and Ninth streets (% 415-626-5416; www.newlangtonarts.org).
Gallery and box office hours are Wednesday through Saturday, noon to 
5 p.m.
You may not want to miss Beach Blanket Babylon, by now a San
Francisco ritual. The 90-minute musical revue is known for wildly imagi-
native hats that seem to live lives of their own. The spectacle is so popu-
lar that even after celebrating 32 years of poking fun at stars, politicians,
and San Francisco itself, seats for the constantly updated shows are
always sold out. Purchase tickets ($25–$80) through TIX or by mail at
least three weeks in advance (especially if you want to attend a weekend
performance). You must be 21 to attend evening performances; minors
are only admitted for Sunday matinees, when no liquor is sold. You can
enjoy this spectacle in North Beach at Club Fugazi, 678 Green St.,
between Powell Street and Columbus Avenue (% 415-421-4222;
www.beachblanketbabylon.com). You’ve got to see it to believe it.

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Checking out the hippest clubs and bars for live music
 Shaking your body at dance clubs
 Aiming for atmosphere
 Getting a good laugh
 Broadening your horizons at some unique establishments
O
ne thing I love about this city: There’s no end to the good times.
You can have a night at the theater, followed by a night hopping
through a few bars and clubs, followed by a night listening to great jazz.
There are so many places for drinking and dancing and socializing, you’ll
have no excuse (except maybe exhaustion) for staying in at night.
Livin’ It Up with Live Music
Bars, all of which by law must remain closed from 2 to 6 a.m., are self-
explanatory. Clubs are a different story altogether. South of Market,
dance clubs that have different styles and names may share the same
space. For example, a particular club may feature 1970s-revisited disco
catering to the Velvet Elvis crowd on Friday, and then play Gothic indus-
trial “music” for body-piercing aficionados on Monday. Take a careful
look at the listings in SF Weekly or Bay Guardian to know what you’re
getting into. Most clubs don’t get going until after 10 p.m., so plan to
take cabs anywhere not within walking distance of your hotel.
Finding some cool jazz
Jazz at Pearl’s, 256 Columbus Ave., at Broadway (% 415-291-8255; www.
jazzatpearls.com), showcases the 17-piece big band Contemporary
Jazz Orchestra every Monday and local jazz musicians Tuesday through
Saturday. Pearl’s closed for a few months in 2003 and reopened with 
new owners who brought in a Spanish chef to retool the menu. The room
has more of a ’30s supper-club atmosphere now and a generous selec-
tion of tapas and larger plates including paellas for two. Dinner-and-
show packages are $35 to $50. Show tickets are $5 to $10. The ever-cool

Elbo Room, 647 Valencia St., near 17th Street (% 415-552-7788), blasts
acid jazz for a well-dressed younger crowd, or, depending on the night,
you can move to Latin and funk bands. Cover starts at $5 upstairs; down-
stairs the bar has a fine menu of microbrews and a couple of pool tables.
Feelin’ blue: Blues bars
The Boom Boom Room, 1601 Fillmore St., at Geary Street (% 415-673-
8000; www.boomboomblues.com), is open every night for dancing, cock-
tails, and jiving. Lines often form on the weekends, so it doesn’t hurt to
arrive early and sip your drink slowly. The cover charge varies depend-
ing on the night and the act; it generally ranges from free to $12. Check
the Web site for an events calendar.
Follow the crowds to The Saloon, 1232 Grant Ave., at Fresno Street near
Vallejo Street (% 415-989-7666), as your first stop on a walking tour of
North Beach blues bars. Johnny Nitro plays here Friday and Sunday
nights. If you can manage to get inside, the cover is usually $4 to $5. 
Up the block, check out the Lost and Found Saloon, 1353 Grant Ave.,
between Vallejo and Green streets (% 415-981-9557). It’s just as
crowded weekend nights; there’s no cover. Grant & Green, 1371 Grant
Ave. (% 415-693-9565), is the third in the North Beach blues triumvi-
rate. No cover here, either. If you’re looking for something a little less . . .
real . . . head over to Enrico’s (see Chapter 10).
During the day, Pier 23, The Embarcadero, at Front Street (% 415-362-
5125), serves lunch to fashionable business executives on the patio. At
night, hot local blues and funk musicians, honky-tonk pianists or ska
bands play for fans ages 21 to 70. There’s a $5 to $10 cover on weekends.
Catching the big-name acts
You’ll want to contact the box office directly or purchase tickets from
BASS at % 415-776-1999 for major musical acts. Ticket prices vary at
the following clubs, depending on the performers.
The Great American Music Hall, 859 O’Farrell St., near Polk Street 
(% 415-885-0750; www.musichallsf.com), books everything from
rhythm and blues to Cajun bands to Grammy Award–winning artists
such as Bonnie Raitt. Although you’ll notice the club isn’t in a squeaky-
clean neighborhood, safety isn’t a problem because so many people are
going in and out of the place. If you’re driving, use the valet in front (if
available) or park in the AMC 1000 garage across the street. Take a cab
home after the show if you aren’t driving. You can find the club schedule
and order tickets on the Web site.
It won’t be the Grateful Dead, but you can find out who’s playing The
Fillmore, 1805 Geary St., at Fillmore Street, by checking out its Web site
(www.thefillmore.com) or by calling the box office at % 415-346-
6000. A pilgrimage here for die-hard rock ’n’ roll fans really is meaning-
ful. The SF Weekly Warfield, 982 Market St. (% 415-775-7722), is a huge
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
266

theater that hosts big-time musicians, mostly rock ’n’ roll. Slim’s, 333
11th St., between Folsom and Harrison streets (% 415-255-0333; www.
slims-sf.com), is a smaller, fairly comfortable club owned by singer
Boz Scaggs, who plays here every now and then. A much bigger room
that some grown-ups I know find extra-palatable is Bimbo’s 365 Club, in
North Beach at 1025 Columbus Ave., at Chestnut Street (% 415-474-
0365; www.bimbos365club.com). It’s a ’30s-style ballroom with an
ornate bar and an attendant in the ladies’ restroom. Music varies from
rock to alternative, and you can check the schedule at the Web site.
Bottom of the Hill, 1233 17th St., at Texas Street (% 415-621-4455;
www.bottomofthehill.com), is a 300- to 500-capacity venue that caters
to nationally known indie rock acts with special appeal to a demo-
graphic that listens to college radio. This Potrero Hill–based club also
serves bar and grill food and hosts an all-you-can-eat barbecue/music
hoedown Sunday afternoons. Smokers are allowed to puff on the patio.
You can get there on the 22-Fillmore or 19-Polk buses. My sources in the
music biz inform me that The Independent, 628 Divisadero St., between
Grove and Hayes streets (% 415-771-1421; www.theindependentsf.
com), has the best sound system in the city and books the hottest indie
and pop bands. Their schedule is online; the door runs from free with a
two-drink minimum to $20.
Shakin’ Your Groove Thang: Dance Clubs
The Ramp, 855 China Basin, off Third Street at Mariposa Street (% 415-
621-2378; www.ramprestaurant.com), is an indoor/outdoor bar/restau-
rant serving salads, burgers, breakfast, and perhaps the best views over
the water. Between May and October you can dance to live music on the
weekends; Saturdays feature salsa bands, and Sundays bring world
music (both days from 5–8 p.m.). There’s no cover charge. The ultracool
but friendly Cafe du Nord and The Swedish American Hall, 2170
Market St., at Sanchez Street (% 415-861-5016; www.cafedunord.com),
is a basement-level club and restaurant that features indie bands or
some type of live music most every evening. Cover runs from $7 to $15.
Under-21 bohemians are allowed in for selected shows if accompanied
by adults. DNA Lounge, 375 11th St., at Harrison Street (% 415-626-
1409; www.dnalounge.com), may be blasting metal, gothic, hip-hop, 
synthpop . . . whatever . . . on different nights of the week. Cover is
around $20 on weekends.
Swing, salsa, and ballroom dancers, and those who’ve never completely
let go of their Ginger Rogers fantasies, will adore the Metronome Dance
Center, 1830 17th St. (% 415-252-9000; www.metronomedancecenter.
com). You can swoop by at 7:30 p.m. to take a class, and then stay for 
a dance party on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night, or simply arrive at 
9 p.m. to trip the light fantastic. This is strictly a social dancing venue;
only snacks and nonalcoholic beverages are available. There’s a cover
charge of $7 to $16. Already have your moves down? The Top of the
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 267

Mark in the Mark Hopkins Hotel, 1 Nob Hill (% 415-616-6916; www.top
ofthemark.com), with its surround-sound view, is one of the prettiest
rooms in the city. A dance floor is ringed by tables and a six-piece band
plays ’40s dance tunes on Friday and Saturday nights. Cover is $10 — or
you can go all out and eat dinner here, too. Wednesday nights feature
salsa dance lessons at 8 p.m. and live music to practice to from 9 p.m.
There’s much more to local nightlife than South of Market dance halls.
For a little fiesta in the Mission District, reserve a seat on El Voladote,
the Mexican Bus (www.mexicanbus.com), as it cruises the dance clubs
Friday and Saturday nights. The $38 ticket price includes cover charges
at three clubs. Call % 415-546-3747 for reservations two or three weeks
ahead. Salsa dancing is all the rage, and the place to take a lesson or just
sit back watching expert couples heat up the expansive dance floor is
Roccapulco, 3140 Mission St. at Precita Street (% 415-648-6611; www.
roccapulco.com). Ten dollars gets you a one-hour lesson Wednesday,
Friday, and Saturday nights at 8:30; live Latin bands play Friday and
Saturday nights from 10 p.m. and Mexican specialties are available to
keep your energy up. You’ll want to dress the part here.
Sunday afternoons in the Mission call out for a cerveza on the patio at El
Rio, 3158 Mission St. (% 415-282-3325), where they pack ’em in for salsa
parties ($8 admission after 3 p.m.). The rest of the week you might find
DJs, a movie on the patio, a benefit for an alternative magazine, and
you’ll always find a mixed but congenial crowd of locals. Usually there’s
no cover; for special events they sometimes charge $4 or $5.
Drinking in the Atmosphere: The Best 
Places to Have a Drink and Mingle
San Francisco offers a special ambience. From coffee shops and dance
clubs to galleries and restaurants, there’s something to appeal to every
persuasion. If atmosphere is what you’re after, check out these favorites.
Joining the singles scene
The Balboa Cafe, 3199 Fillmore St., between Greenwich and Filbert 
(% 415-921-3944), has withstood the test of time. The bar/restaurant
gets lots of repeat customers — they come here after every divorce. In
and around the Tenderloin, they line up to enter the Red Room, 827
Sutter St., between Jones and Leavenworth streets, next door to the
Commodore Hotel (% 415-346-7666). Look sharp. Bambuddha Lounge,
at the Phoenix Hotel, 601 Eddy St., at Larkin Street (% 415-885-5088),
combines an Asian sensibility with the desire to have a really good time
eating, drinking, and checking out the people around the pool. It offers
innovative cocktail fare, house music nightly, and well-regarded food.

268

Blondie’s Bar and No Grill, 540 Valencia St., between 16th and 17th
streets (% 415-864-2419), is on the sizzling Valencia Street corridor in
the Mission District. The young and the restless make good use of the
free jazz jukebox. The Make-Out Room, also in the Mission at 3225 22nd
St. (% 415-647-2888), attracts a very attractive young crowd and fea-
tures alternative bands (cover ranges from free to about $8).
Closer to Union Square at 414 Jessie St., off 5th Street, is the brand-new
Bar of Contemporary Art (BOCA; % 415-474-7973; www.bocasf.com), a
combo art gallery, drinking, dancing, and dining space with regularly
changing installations. You can check out the artwork during the day
and have lunch, and come back later to get sweaty with the DJs. It’s
open Tuesday through Saturday until the wee hours; there’s a cover
Friday and Saturday nights.
The Mission has its own version of the Bermuda Triangle, and, if you
have the stamina to investigate, you could begin the evening at Latin
American Club, 3286 22nd St. (% 415-647-2732). This bar has an
unstructured feel — maybe it’s the piñatas hanging from the ceiling —
and you’ll see lots of mid-20s to mid-30s people hanging out and drinking
while they wait for things to get going at one of the nearby music clubs.
Although the Make-Out Room is just across the street, walk down to
Mission St. and see what’s happening at 12 Galaxies, 2565 Mission St.
(% 415-970-9777; www.12galaxies.com), which on some nights is a
little out of this world. Live music draws the local party crowd and not
infrequently the club is the scene of theme bashes. The night I visited,
the Devil-Ettes were out in full force, horns and all, for their five-year
anniversary go-go blowout. Right next door is Doc’s Clock, 2575 Mission
St. (% 415-824-3627), which is the best bar in the area according to
Aiden, who checks identification at the door. He also pointed out that 
it has the only shuffleboard in the Mission, plus charming, articulate 
bartenders.
Check out a four-hour, three-club tour, Three Babes and a Bus (www.
threebabes.com), for a great time on a Saturday night. It’s hassle-
free — no parking to deal with and no lines. Local gals in celebratory
moods usually fill the luxury tour bus, and the fun is infectious. The 
$35-per-person fee includes club cover charges, VIP entry, and trans-
portation to and from Union Square. Call % 800-414-0158 for reserva-
tions at least a week in advance.
Mixing with the sophisticates
A splendid Art Deco supper club, Bix, 56 Gold St., off Montgomery Street
between Pacific and Jackson streets in the Financial District (% 415-
433-6300; www.bixrestaurant.com), will make you want to wear a bias-
cut gown (or a dinner jacket, perhaps) and appear very glamorous. The
food is now better than ever, too. The Redwood Room, at the Clift Hotel,
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 269

495 Geary St., at Jones Street (% 415-929-2372), is not quite the refined
place it ’twas in my mother’s day, but the clientele appears as if they
dropped in from a Vanity Fair photo shoot. The Tonga Room at the
Fairmont Hotel, 950 Mason St., at California Street (% 415-772-5278),
features a happy hour buffet weekdays from 5 to 7 p.m. For the price of a
drink (about $7) you can enjoy hors d’oeuvres and entertainment — a
tropical rainstorm hits every half hour. Okay, okay, maybe that isn’t so
sophisticated, but at least the hotel’s posh.
The Empire Plush Room, inside the York Hotel, 940 Sutter St., between
Hyde and Leavenworth streets (% 866-468-3399; www.yorkhotel.
com/plushroom.htm), features torch and standards singers of some
repute. (More than one songbird has started a career in this intimate
room and ended up playing clubs in New York City.) At other times, you
may find a musical revue or duo or even a comedian (Mort Sahl played
here recently). Tickets, ranging from $20 to $55, can be purchased
through the Web site and are $5 more expensive at the door. This is one
of my favorite clubs, but then I also loved Mel Torme.
Heading to the local for a pint
Chief among our expat watering holes is Edinburgh Castle Pub, 950
Geary St., near Polk Street (% 415-885-4074), which hosts a mix of
entertainment ranging from live music to readings to Quiz Night on
Tuesdays. A pool table adds to its stellar reputation. There’s no cover
charge. Convenient to Union Square is the fine Johnny Foley’s, 243
O’Farrell St. (% 415-954-0777). There’s live entertainment nightly and, 
if you’re in the mood for bangers and mash or fish and chips, this is 
the place to be. Missing Guinness? Head to O’Reilly’s, 622 Green St. 
(% 415-989-6222), an Irish pub (no kidding) with the two-toned stout
and weekend brunch, as well as an authentic crowd of employed locals.
Bringing the kids along
Biscuits and Blues, 401 Mason St., at Geary Street (% 415-292-2583), 
is near the theater district on Union Square in a basement room. The 
all-ages venue has inexpensive food ($13–$16 entrees), and the music —
blues musicians of varied repute — is really good. If you dine here, 
you get the best seats in the house. Tickets are $5 to $15. The Great
American Music Hall, 859 O’Farrell St., near Polk Street in the
Tenderloin (% 415-885-0750), allows children over 6 into some shows;
call for an events calendar to see who’s playing an early show. Because 
it offers food service, Jazz at Pearl’s, 256 Columbus Ave., at Broadway
(% 415-291-8255), can also accommodate minors. The same is true of
Slim’s and Bottom of the Hill. (See “Catching the big-name acts,” earlier
in this chapter.)

Laughing It Up: Comedy Clubs
I probably don’t have to remind you that San Francisco is where Robin
Williams got his start and where Lenny Bruce once shocked the audi-
ence at The Purple Onion by using foul language. Imagine that. Although
the city is no longer the hotbed of chuckles that it was in the ’70s, the
comedy clubs are still packin’ ’em in.
Cobb’s Comedy Club, 915 Columbus Ave. (% 415-928-4320; www.cobbs
comedy.com), features headliners Tuesday through Sunday and a three-
hour marathon of comics on Wednesday nights for a mere $10. No one
under 16 admitted; tickets range from $15 to $40, and there’s a two-
drink minimum. The Punchline Comedy Club, 444 Battery St., between
Washington and Clay streets (% 415-397-7573; www.punchlinecomedy
club.com), also books local and nationally known comics nightly at 
9 p.m. with a second set at 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights. These
shows are only open to folks 18 and over; tickets range from $5 to $20,
and there’s a two-drink minimum. The Valencia Street corridor in the
Mission District is one hot property, but before it was the place to be, 
it was the longtime ’hood of The Marsh, 1062 Valencia St. (% 800-838-
3006 or 415-826-5750; www.themarsh.org), a complex of theaters
devoted to developing work. On Saturday nights in one of these theaters
(two doors down at 1074 Valencia St.), you’ll find the Mock Café, with
scheduled performers at 10 p.m. for a cover charge of $7. You won’t nor-
mally find the polished acts that show up at the other clubs (although
Robin Williams himself makes the occasional appearance), but you’ll
certainly be closer to the cutting edge of comedy. Monday nights show-
case works-in-progress. Check the Web site for more events.
Defying Categorization: Unique Bars
A manicure and a martini can be yours at The Beauty Bar, 2299 Mission
St., at 19th Street (% 415-285-0323), where the décor is straight out of a
1959 beauty parlor. (In case you were wondering where all those enor-
mous hair dryers with the hoods ended up, look no farther.) Wednesday
through Saturday happy hour from 7 p.m. includes a manicurist making
the rounds. If you spend $10 on a drink (and you will) either Friday or
Saturday nights, that also buys you a mini-makeover from their friends
at Urban Decay. Our local suburbanites join the fun on the weekends,
and during the week around midnight, hipsters drape themselves over
the chrome barstools to exude cool.
If you smoke and drink, or drink and don’t mind smoke, Amber, 718 14th
St., around Church and Sanchez streets (% 415-626-7827), is the bar for
you. This is a locals’ hangout with high-quality booze, a comfy lounge,
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 271

and excellent lighting. Li-Po Cocktail Lounge, 916 Grant Ave., at
Washington Street (% 415-982-0072), is an authentic, dark, Chinatown
dive, complete with dusty Asian furnishings, a huge rice-paper lantern,
and a shrine to Buddha behind the bar. If you want to drink with profes-
sionals, head to North Beach and grab a bar stool at Gino and Carlo’s,
548 Green St., between Columbus and Grant avenues (% 415-421-0896),
which opens early so the regulars can get in a fortifying scotch before
lunch. Spec’s, 12 Saroyan Alley, off Columbus Avenue and Broadway 
(% 415-421-4112), is another North Beach institution — dark and dingy,
but historic.
Literary types make a pilgrimage to Vesuvio in North Beach, where Jack
Kerouac passed the time. It’s at 255 Columbus (% 415-362-3370), next
to Kerouac Alley, where the author used to pass out.
Fancy yourself an undiscovered singing sensation? Make your way to the
back room at Martuni’s, 4 Valencia St., at Market (% 415-241-0205),
where customers croon and the piano player is kind.
Champagne lovers unite in the Financial District at the Bubble Lounge,
714 Montgomery St. (% 415-434-4204). The bar has over 300 sparkling
wines, plush sofas, and an array of financial-center types reminiscing
over their expense accounts.
If you’re around Polk Street for dinner, stop in afterward at the Bigfoot
Lodge, a retro, log-cabin-like bar with good recorded music, a cool
crowd of singles, and a wooden likeness of Bigfoot, as we imagine him 
to be. Find all this and more at 1750 Polk St., near Washington Street 
(% 415-440-2355). Alternatively, Hemlock Tavern, 1131 Polk St. at Post
Street (% 415-923-0923; www.hemlocktavern.com), brings in two indie
bands most nights to play in one of the smallest enclosed spaces I’ve
seen in public. There’s another room for drinking, a pool table, and a
patio for smoking. Over in Hayes Valley, you can snack on corn dogs 
and other foodlike products, drink, and discover what’s happening in
the indie music scene at Rickshaw Stop, 155 Fell St. at Van Ness Avenue
(% 415-861-2011; www.rickshawstop.com). Events are scheduled
Wednesday through Saturday nights and tickets are $5 to $12 at the
door.
Stepping Out: The Gay and Lesbian Scene
In this section, I give you a short list of the many clubs and bars that
cater to the gay and lesbian community in the city. Find specific listings
in the weekly entertainment guides, SF Weekly and Bay Guardian, and
look for the free Bay Area Reporter in bookstores, cafes, and bars around
town.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: San Francisco Nightlife 
272

The Cafe, 2367 Market St., near Castro (% 415-861-3846), is currently
the place for both sexes to go dancing. It’s also the place to stand in line
on weekend nights. The Stud, 399 Ninth St., at Harrison Street (% 415-
252-7883), is a long-time institution in the city. Different nights feature
different music, but Tuesdays are infamous for “Trannyshack” hosted by
Heklina. Cover $2 to $6 on weekends. Endup is another gay icon, a hang-
out as well as a dance club. South of Market at 401 Sixth St. (% 415-646-
0999), it’s a San Francisco institution like the cable cars or Coit Tower.
Cover is $10 to $20 these days.
To be entertained or be entertaining, try Martuni’s piano bar (see the
preceding section), which is certainly gay-friendly, but you should also
make your way to The Mint Karaoke Lounge, 1942 Market St. in the
Castro (% 415-626-4726). On the weekends, the hard core come in to
warm up at 4 p.m., but the show goes on seven nights a week. Stop off at
the ATM before you arrive, because the bar only accepts cash.

restaurants (too challenging) or my ten favorite parking
places (the ﬁrst ten available spots, wherever they are).
Instead, in this part I give you my humble opinions on the
greatest views, the best pastimes in foul weather, useful/
playful gifts that won’t damage your credit rating, and the
best ways to look less like a tourist — not that I have any-
thing against tourists, mind you.

Chapter 17
The Top Ten San Francisco
Views
In This Chapter
 Finding the best panoramas
 Golfing, dining, and drinking cocktails, with a view
 Checking out the view from Berkeley
P
eople like views. That much is clear from the wrangling that goes on
to get a table with a view in restaurants, or the extra tariff imposed
on a room with a view, not to mention a home with a view. San Francisco
is one major view, owing to all those hills. I admit to a permanent senti-
mental attachment to the views of San Francisco. Following are some of
my favorites.
From Twin Peaks
The mother of all views — if the weather cooperates — is from Twin
Peaks, which sits in the center of San Francisco in a residential neigh-
borhood at the top of Market Street. The sightline encompasses the
entrance to the bay and reaches all the way ’round to Candlestick Point.
If you’re driving, head southwest on Market Street, which becomes
Portola Drive past 17th Street. The first light past Corbett Street is a
right turn only; this is Twin Peaks Boulevard, the road that takes you up
the hill.
The 37-Corbett bus, which you can catch on Market and Church streets,
takes passengers near, but not all the way to, Twin Peaks. And the rest of
the trip is quite a hike uphill. If you’d prefer something less strenuous
and want to see one of San Francisco’s beautiful “hidden” staircases,
here’s a tip: Exit the bus at Corbett and Clayton streets, and look for an
old concrete wall on the west side of Clayton marked by a street sign
that says “Pemberton.” This leads to the Pemberton Stairs. You won’t
get to the top of Twin Peaks by climbing them, but you’ll be treated to
bay views in quiet, green surroundings.

From Bernal Heights Park
Look southeast from downtown and you’ll spot a prominent hill with a
few trees decorating the top. That’s Bernal Heights Park, the favored
dog-walking and fireworks-viewing area for the Bernal Heights neighbor-
hood. The weather in this part of town is far superior to the weather
around Twin Peaks, which can get really foggy, much to the dismay of
the camera-toting folk on the tour buses. The views here are equally
wonderful to my mind, partly because Bernal Hill is closer to downtown
and the bay. The 67-Folsom bus drives to the end of Folsom at
Esmeralda. Exit and walk up the hill on any of a number of paths.
From Lincoln Park
Lincoln Park is one of the prettiest golf courses in creation, situated
around the Palace of the Legion of Honor and above the entrance to the
San Francisco Bay at Land’s End. Standing in front of the museum, you
can see in the distance a snippet of downtown framed within the green
branches of fir trees. From here, walk west down the street. You’ll be
stunned by a postcard-perfect view of the Golden Gate Bridge from a
unique perspective — facing north as if you’re entering the bay. Take a
seat on one of the benches along the street so you can survey the vista
in comfort. The 18–46th Avenue bus stops in the museum parking lot.
From the Beach Chalet Restaurant
The waves along Ocean Beach, at the end of Golden Gate Park on the
Great Highway, are at times soothing and at times violent enough to 
discourage beachcombing. In either case, you’ll be as comfy as a babe 
in his crib if you get a table upstairs in the Beach Chalet restaurant 
(% 415-386-8439) overlooking the Pacific (ideally, as the sun sets). The
building was designed by Willis Polk, and the first-floor visitor center is
adorned by murals painted in the 1930s by the same artist who painted
the frescoes at Coit Tower. The restaurant is particularly popular for its
menu of house-brewed beers, and it serves throughout the day and
evening starting at breakfast. If you don’t want to wait for a table in the
dining room (the food is so-so), you can take a seat in the bar (a much
better idea) and turn toward the view, dramatic in any season. The latest
addition to the building is called the Park Chalet, which looks onto, well,
the park, of course. The 5-Fulton bus, which you can pick up on Market
and Powell streets, takes you to Ocean Beach, a block or so from the
Beach Chalet.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
278

Above Dolores Park
From any Muni Metro station (the Powell Street Station being the closest
to Union Square) take the J-Church toward Daly City. Exit on 18th and
Church streets, above Dolores Park. The city and bay views over this
stretch of green on a clear day have been responsible for more than one
decision to relocate to the Bay Area. After soaking in the scenery and
taking a stroll through the park, walk 2 blocks north on Dolores Street
until you reach Mission Dolores at 16th and Dolores streets, the oldest
building in San Francisco.
From the Top of the Mark
If you feel like having a cocktail as you drink in a view, head to the Top of
the Mark in the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel, 1 Nob Hill, at
California and Mason streets (% 415-392-3434). Sometimes it’s so busy
you have to wait in line at the elevator, but the city views are mesmeriz-
ing when you get a table.
From the Cheesecake Factory
Union Square is a compact urban hub, immensely appealing, especially
when it’s crowded and bustling. Up until recently, there wasn’t a handy
place to be among, but not in, the madding crowd, but now Macy’s (see
Chapter 12) has alleviated that problem by installing a branch of the
Cheesecake Factory (% 415-397-3333) on the eighth floor of the depart-
ment store. Management shrewdly included a heated patio for diners
who favor a city view in all its skyscrapered glory. The restaurant is
open from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.
From Fisherman’s Wharf
If for some unfathomable reason you’ve skipped to this section without
reading what’s come before, you won’t know that I, like all upstanding
San Franciscans, generally avoid Fisherman’s Wharf (see Chapter 11)
like I avoid the Oakland A’s. However, I recently discovered a way to
escape the folks crowding the sidewalks, yet still take advantage of the
views and freshly cracked crab.
The crab stands are plopped in front of their namesake restaurants
along one block off Jefferson Street. Just to the left of Fisherman’s Grotto
#9 are glass doors marked “Passageway to the Boats,” the boats being
Chapter 17: The Top Ten San Francisco Views 279

what remains of the fishing fleet. Take your cracked crab, your beer, and
plenty of napkins and push through. You’ll be on a pier that leads to the
tiny Fisherman’s and Seaman’s Memorial Chapel on your right, with
views of the bay and Telegraph Hill in front and to your left. The pier is
parallel to Jefferson Street but may be gloriously close to empty even on
a weekend. You can eat your crab in peace sitting on the dock of the bay,
watching . . . well, you know. Close by, sea lions jump, swim, and beg in
the waters below.
From Fort Point
The remains of Fort Point, an 1861 brick artillery fortress, occupy the
land at the edge of the bay nearest the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember
the first time I visited this area, because heavy fog obscured everything
around me except the uppermost portion of the bridge. It was a dra-
matic vision. On a clear day, you’ll be treated to the bridge, of course,
but also to bright views of the downtown skyline and Alcatraz. The 29
bus stops as close as the parking lot next to the bridge visitor center, a
downhill walk to a particularly pretty viewpoint in the midst of eucalyp-
tus trees. If you’re up for a hike, follow the joggers past the Marina Green
and through the Presidio (see Chapter 11).
From UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens
Drive to the UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens, high in the hills behind the
campus. Find the rose garden. Beyond the plants, you can see the bay
and San Francisco, small and glowing in the distance. See Chapter 14 for
other ideas on what to do in Berkeley after you finish admiring the view.

Ten Things to Do If It’s
Raining (or Just Too Foggy)
In This Chapter
 Making the most of a soggy day
 Pampering yourself at the hot springs or spa
 Finding entertaining indoor activities
S
an Francisco isn’t Seattle or London by any means, but our rainy
days can get in the way of enjoying the city. Actually, a foggy morn-
ing is what bothers people most — fog is always cold and damp and
gray. But you don’t have time to grouse about the weather. You have
things to do, places to see, people to meet . . . oh, you don’t like getting
wet? Okay. Here are a few rainy/foggy-day options.
Taking Afternoon Tea
Afternoon tea at one of the many hotels that offers it is probably the
only civilized way to keep dry. Try the cozy King George Hotel, 334
Mason St. (% 415-283-4TEA; weekends only); the Fairmont Hotel’s
Laurel Court, California and Mason streets (% 415-772-5260); the
Palace Hotel, Market and New Montgomery streets (% 415-546-5089;
Sat afternoons only); or the Ritz-Carlton, 600 Stockton St. (% 415-773-
6198). Neiman Marcus also has a lovely, traditional tea service in the
Rotunda restaurant, 150 Stockton St. (% 415-362-4777), from 2:30 to 
5 p.m. daily.
Checking Out Japantown
Head to Japantown and take cover inside the Kinokuniya Building at
1581 Webster St., between Post Street and Geary Boulevard. Although
this and the other buildings in the area isn’t much to look at from the
outside, inside you can get a delicious bowl of noodles at Mifune (see

Chapter 10), the most authentic noodle house in town, and then enter-
tain yourself in any of a number of stores, such as Mashiko Folkcraft
(open Wed–Mon 11 a.m.–6 p.m.) and the Kinokuniya Bookstore (open
daily 10:30 a.m.–7 p.m.). If the sky still hasn’t cleared up, take in a movie
at the Kabuki Theater next door. This multiplex gets all the latest films.
An underground parking lot is located off Webster Street. Muni buses 
2-Clement, 3-Jackson, 4-Sutter, 22-Fillmore, and 38-Geary all drop you in
Japantown.
Luxuriating at Kabuki Springs
Staying indoors can turn into a modest luxury at Kabuki Springs & 
Spa, 1750 Geary Blvd., at Webster Street (% 415-922-6000), a most
respectable communal bathhouse. You can soak your feet, have a mas-
sage, and take a steam bath. Women may use the communal bath facili-
ties on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; Tuesdays are coed; and men
get the rest of the week. Shy people may not feel comfortable at first
walking around the premises au naturel, but no one will bother you.
Massages, facials, acupuncture, and other treatments are by appoint-
ment. To get here, take the 38-Geary bus. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m.
Rock Climbing (Or Working Out) at 
the Touchstone Mission Cliffs Gym
Rather than let the kids climb the walls in your hotel room, take every-
one rock climbing (indoors of course) at Touchstone Mission Cliffs
Climbing and Fitness, located in the Mission District at 2295 Harrison
St., at 19th Street (% 415-550-0515), and open every day. This world-
class facility caters to beginners and experts of all ages and even folks
who never dreamed of making like flies. Belay (rope handling) classes
are taught regularly, so you can act as assistant to your compadres and
vice versa. You don’t even need any special equipment — you can rent
whatever is necessary (including shoes) — and there goes your final
excuse. Also on-site is a gym with locker rooms and a sauna, relief for
those who prefer to keep their feet on the floor.
Watching the Weather from the Cliff House
Admire the storm from the confines of the Cliff House, 1090 Point Lobos
Ave., on the Great Highway (% 415-386-3330), open every day. This
newly renovated historic property now enjoys two restaurants, a bar,
and viewing decks. The food, while rather expensive, is quite good fortu-
nately, but what you are really shelling out for is the impressive view of
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
282

Seal Rocks and the Pacific Ocean, doubly dramatic if waves are crashing
about. The closest museum is the Palace of the Legion of Honor (see
Chapter 11), another wonderful place to wait out the weather (the
museum has a good cafe). The 18 bus will bring you to both locations.
Finding Activities for Everyone at the 
Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens
The Metreon and Yerba Buena Gardens (see Chapter 11) make up a
one-stop rainy-day haven, particularly if you’re traveling with your
family. Depending on everyone’s ages, you don’t have to stick together
for the entire day. Teens can flex their independence at Zeum or in the
Airtight Garage. The elders, if they aren’t needed, can shop, play pool at
Jillian’s (the large restaurant on the first floor), or even dash across the
street to the Museum of Modern Art. Bowling and ice-skating work for
everyone, and when it’s time to regroup, you can see what’s playing at
the movies.
Defying the Weather at the California
Academy of Sciences
The California Academy of Sciences (see Chapter 11) has abandoned
its Golden Gate Park laboratory until 2008 and taken up residence south
of Market in a multistoried former garment warehouse at 825 Howard St.
(% 415-750-7145). Amongst the aquarium, the exhibits, the gift shop,
and the cafe, you can find enough to keep you busy until the sun comes
back out. You’ll also be just down the block from Yerba Buena Gardens
(see the preceding section) and about two long blocks from the new
Apple Store (see Chapter 12) where you can check your e-mail or dis-
cover some new tricks for your iPod.
Sightseeing and Staying Dry 
on the F-Market Streetcar
The F-Market streetcar (see Chapter 11) is my current public-transport
ride of choice. Grab an umbrella, and then grab a seat for a ride to The
Cannery (see Chapter 12). Yes, it’s really just an enclosed shopping
mall, if you want to be blunt and unromantic; but still, it’s an attractive
enclosed shopping mall with some fun things to do with the kids. Take
the streetcar all the way toward upper Market Street and reward your-
self with a late lunch at Zuni (see Chapter 10).
Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do If It’s Raining (or Just Too Foggy) 283

Babying Yourself at Nordstrom
See if you can get an appointment for a manicure, a pedicure, and/or a
facial at Nordstrom in the San Francisco Centre shopping mall at Fifth
and Market streets (% 415-977-5102). If you have a retinue to deal with,
send them to the fourth-floor grill for lunch or a snack. You can find lots
of shopping opportunities here as well, although most of the stores are
your typical mall flavors. While not quite open at press time, there’s also
going to be a spa at the Bloomingdale’s Westfield Centre next to
Nordies, along with many more shops and restaurants.
Doing Business on a Rainy Day
A great thing to do is sit around your hotel lobby, or better yet the glam-
orous lobby at the Palace Hotel (2 New Montgomery St.), and complain
about the weather. Grab a copy of the Chronicle and maybe the Wall
Street Journal for good measure. Whisper into a cellphone while gripping
a cup of coffee in your free hand. Then hail a cab and dash to the nearest
Internet cafe to check your e-mail: Golden Gate Perk, 401 Bush St. at
Kearney (% 415-362-3929) has computers if you didn’t bring your
laptop, and Café de la Presse, 352 Grant Ave. (% 415-398-2680), has
free Wi-Fi. The terminals at the Apple Store get busy, but their use is free.
Anyway, if you think the rain is bad, be thankful you haven’t been inun-
dated with foggy mornings for 40 days straight. Now you know why
anyone who can afford a summerhouse in Napa puts up with the traffic
on Friday afternoons.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Avoid Looking
Like a Tourist
In This Chapter
 Eating, shopping, and dressing like the locals
 Avoiding tourist traps
I
don’t understand why being a tourist is considered so beneath some
people. Even my own dear husband scoffs at tourists — or people he
presumes are tourists — and when we travel he does his well-meaning
best to look like a local. This generally leads to amusing misunderstand-
ings with actual citizens, who ask him something in a language he doesn’t
understand, or presume he knows where he’s going when he hasn’t a
clue. So, why live a lie, I say. If you’re visiting for pleasure and have a
keen interest in looking around, you’re a tourist. Be proud. Wear that
camera around your neck (but maybe leave the bum bag at home).
Rattle a map in frustration. Ask a stranger for directions.
Otherwise, memorize the following tips.
Dress for the Weather
This is not The O.C. — you cannot tan here. In summer, San Francisco is
foggy and cold in the morning, turning to sunshine in the afternoon, with
temperatures in the upper 60s or low 70s. I know this because the weather-
men repeat the same forecast every morning in July and August. Dress in
long pants, not shorts. Wear a sweater over your T-shirt and a jacket
over both. You can always tie extraneous clothing around your waist
when you enter one of our famous microclimates. In San Francisco, the
temperature changes from neighborhood to neighborhood, so if you’re
shivering in Golden Gate Park, head to the Mission to warm up.
September and October are the warmest months here. If you look good
in shorts, wear them then.

Don’t Trust Your Map
Those darn hills have a way of interrupting the streets in ways that may
not be apparent to the untrained eye. It may look like a straight shot
from one part of town to the other, but take into consideration the up-
and-down of the steep hills. Telegraph Hill is the worst offender. If you
can’t go through, you’ll have to go around. If you’re planning on walking
to a particular destination, ask first at the hotel or call ahead to see if it
isn’t more advisable to take public transit or a cab.
Don’t Gawk at Tall Buildings
An article in the San Francisco Chronicle noted that San Franciscans 
do not gawk at tall buildings, although I don’t know if that includes 
skyscrapers in other towns. The author also noted that San Franciscans
are breaking their own rule and gawking like mad at the downtown 
ballpark. So, if you don’t want to look like a tourist, don’t stare at the
Transamerica Pyramid — a quick glance should do — but feel free to
drool while admiring AT&T Park. You’ll then resemble a local who didn’t
buy season tickets.
Don’t Eat or Shop Like a Tourist
Be picky about where you spend your time and money. Places most 
residents wouldn’t be caught dead in include the Hard Rock Cafe, any
restaurant on Fisherman’s Wharf, Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, and the
Golden Gate Bridge on a Friday afternoon.
Wait ’til You Get Back to the Airport to Buy
That Delicious San Francisco Sourdough
Don’t walk around with loaves of bread wrapped in plastic for the trip
home. Around here we buy our baguettes for same-day consumption.
Anyway, you can buy that particular brand of bread at the airport, where
no one will see you.
Cross the Bridge before or after — 
but Not during — Rush Hour
Don’t cross the Bay Bridge between 3 and 7 p.m. unless you want to be
mistaken for a suburban commuter. Anyway, no one, not even the com-
muters, are actually crossing the Bay Bridge at this time; rather, they’re
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
286

sitting and fuming and occasionally inching their way forward. This is
important to remember if you have friends in the East Bay who invite
you to come over for dinner.
Don’t Stare at the Locals
Don’t point/gasp/shriek at the man/woman/other with the attention-
getting tattoo/leather chaps/chartreuse wig no matter how unusual
he/she/it appears. That would be unseemly.
Don’t Shout at People You Suspect 
Don’t Speak English
Don’t raise your voice or speak extra slowly to your waiter if you 
suspect he doesn’t speak English. In fact, he does speak English. 
He’s merely trying to turn your table as quickly as possible.
Do the Farmers’ Market Thing
Hang around the Ferry Plaza Farmers’ Market on a Saturday morning.
Have breakfast, circle the stalls, eat all the samples, buy something 
ßnonperishable to take home.
Remove Any Incriminating Evidence
Remember the plastic nametag you attached to your lapel upon entering
the Moscone Convention Center? It’s okay to remove it now.
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Avoid Looking Like a Tourist 287

Chapter 20
The Top Ten Gifts 
for Cheapskates
In This Chapter
 Bridging the gap with Golden Gate souvenirs
 Sweetening the return with fortune-cookie souvenirs
 Spreading the fruits of love with gifts of jam
I
don’t know about you, but buying gifts for the folks back at the ranch
who know I’ve been on vacation is sometimes more a chore than a
pleasure. Besides the fact that no one in the Western world really needs
another T-shirt, those souvenirs add up (and subtract from my shoe
allowance). Understanding, however, that some people expect a little
something, here is my list of portable, fun, San Francisco–related gifts —
and they’re (almost) all under $10.
Playing Bridge
Not to be outdone by the museum gift shops, our own Golden Gate
Bridge hawks a variety of branded items sure to remind your nearest
and dearest of one of the wonders of the modern world. I particularly
like the $6 Golden Gate Bridge playing cards, printed with trivia about
the construction and history of this landmark. A close second is the $7
Golden Gate Bridge kitchen towel, the gift of choice from thrifty shop-
pers like my cousin Irene. If you run out of time and can’t get to the gift
shop, you can actually purchase these things online at http://store.
goldengate.org.
Riding High
This truly is a cheapskate souvenir, but being a practical sort, I find it
elegant in its simplicity and usefulness. For a mere $5 at the Powell
Street or Hyde Street Cable Car ticket booths, you can purchase one of
four limited-edition souvenir cable-car tickets. The cards each picture a
historic cable car and are good for two-thirds of the fare of a one-way
ride. Collect all four, and someone with a scrapbook will treasure them.

Smelling Salts
The Ferry Building Marketplace is full of places to find great gifts, but go
on a Saturday when the Farmers’ Market is in full tilt. Behind the build-
ing look for the Eatwell Farms booth and check out the $5 jars of laven-
der salt or rosemary salt. They smell divine and add extra oomph to
salads and roasts. Your friends who cook will be most impressed.
Bringing Good Fortune
The biggest producer of fortune cookies in town is Mee Mee Bakery,
1328 Stockton St., between Broadway and Vallejo streets in Chinatown
(% 415-362-3253; www.meemeebakery.com). Hand over $9.75 and you
can delight someone with a giant fortune cookie. Okay, at roughly 5
inches in diameter, maybe it’s not an actual giant, but it’s still fairly large.
Mee Mee also sells bags of chocolate- and strawberry-flavored fortune
cookies for $6.50 per pound, and almond cookies for $4.50 per pound. If
you want to splurge on something more creative, for about $25 per 100
cookies, the bakery will put your own custom fortunes inside the crispy
little devils.
Lighting the Way
Intellectuals and all your friends who belong to book clubs will be
thrilled to receive anything from City Lights, San Francisco’s iconic
bookstore in North Beach. For those keeping to a budget, check out the
very cool $8 black-and-white posters featuring the storefront, or Jack
Kerouac and Neal Cassady looking rather James Deanish.
Writing Clearly
You can’t have too many postcards, but picking them out can be stress-
ful. After all, postcards are like greeting cards — they say something
about the person who spent 20 minutes deciding between the one with
the cat and the one depicting Einstein. Save your friends grief and gift
them with a book of 30 San Francisco postcards featuring the photo-
graphs of Michal Venera. At $9.95 this is a deal. Find San Francisco 30
postcards at Chronicle Books Metreon Store, 101 4th St. (% 415-369-
6271), or Cody’s Books at 2 Stockton St., near Market Street (% 415-
773-0444).
Spilling the Beans
You may not believe this, but B.S. (before Starbucks), people in the Bay
Area were drinking strong, delicious coffee! And many continue to do so.
They purchase it at any of a number of Peet’s Coffee & Tea stores,
Chapter 20: The Top Ten Gifts for Cheapskates 289

including the newest one in the Ferry Building (see Chapter 10), the
shop in the Russ Building at 217 Montgomery St., or in the Marina at
2156 Chestnut St. A gift your coffee-loving pals will truly appreciate is a
pound of Peet’s French Roast, my husband’s favorite — this stuff is so
strong it can bench-press the competition. At $11.95 per pound, you’ve
crossed the cheapskate limit, but not by much. Besides, it’s worth it.
Ringing Your Bell
Useless ornaments . . . ah, where would commerce be without snow
globes, pewter models, and plastic barista figurines? Well, San Francisco
can supply its fair share and at the top of my list is a spiffy tin cable car.
A mere $8.75, this little beauty actually moves using friction, and ting-a-
lings like the real thing while skittering over the linoleum. These are
among the many fine doodads available online and at the Cable Car
Museum gift shop, 1201 Mason St. (% 415-474-1887; www.cablecar
museum.org). Admission to the museum is free and it’s open every day
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Nibbling Bliss
San Francisco has long attracted chocolate makers to its shores, not for
any reason I know of, but there was Ghirardelli to start and Joseph
Schmidt (of the beautiful truffles) and most recently a former doctor and
a former winemaker who have together produced some serious dark
chocolate under the Scharffen Berger label. Free one-hour tours of the
handsome brick factory, located in Berkeley at 914 Heinz Ave. (% 510-
981-4050; www.scharffenberger.com), are offered by appointment
daily at 10:30 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. for people 10 and older.
Scharffen Berger sells two gifts that I, for one, would be genuinely
pleased to receive; the $8 cylinder filled with chocolate-covered cham-
pagne grapes, or the $6 rectangular acrylic package of a dozen 5-gram
squares (the mint flavor, if you’re wondering).
Spreading the Love
Ten bucks may not seem like much to spend on a gift, but how often do
you fork over that kind of money for a small jar of jam? Berkeley’s June
Taylor does not make ordinary preserves from ordinary fruit; thus her
divine products created from organic fruits in small batches do not sell
for chicken feed. And that’s why an 8-ounce jar of her white nectarine
conserve or tangerine marmalade (among many flavors that will cause
your bread to sit up and take notice) is such a thoughtful and extrava-
gant offering. June Taylor’s jams can be purchased at Yum (see Chap-
ter 13), and the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market. If you take a walk through
Crissy Field (see Chapter 11), you can get them at the Warming Hut, too.

Before receiving any treatment, check with
your health-insurance company to find out
how emergency treatment is handled when
you’re out of your provider area.

Earthquakes
California will always have earthquakes,
most of which you’ll never notice.
However, in case of a significant shaker,
you should know a few precautionary
measures. When you’re inside a building,
seek cover; do not run outside. Stand
under a doorway or against a wall and stay
away from windows. If you exit a building
after a substantial quake, use stairwells,
not elevators. If you’re in a car, pull over to
the side of the road and stop — but not
until you’re away from bridges, over-
passes, telephone poles, and power lines.
Stay in your car. If you’re out walking, stay
outside and away from trees, power lines,
and the sides of buildings. If you’re in an
area with tall buildings, find a doorway in
which to stand.
Emergencies
Dial % 911 from any phone for police, an
ambulance, and the fire department.
Hospitals
San Francisco General Hospital, 1001

Agency, % 415-474-7310.
Information
The San Francisco Convention and Visitors
Bureau is in the lower level of Hallidie
Plaza, 900 Market St., at Powell Street 
(% 415-391-2000).
Internet Access and Cafes
You can check your e-mail while on the
road at Golden Gate Perk, 401 Bush St. 
(% 415-362-3929), or Quetzal Internet
Café, 1234 Polk St. (% 415-673-4181).
Liquor Laws
You can’t drink or purchase alcohol legally
if you’re under 21. All the clubs, bars,
supermarkets, and liquor stores ID anyone
who looks younger than 30 (try not to be
offended if you don’t get carded). Bars
don’t serve liquor from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Maps
The visitor’s bureau (see “Information”
earlier in this section) has maps of the city,
or stop by the California State Automobile
Association (see “AAA” earlier in this sec-
tion) if you’re a member of AAA.
Newspapers/Magazines
The major papers are the morning 
San Francisco Chronicle and the afternoon
San Francisco Examiner. They are distrib-
uted from sidewalk kiosks and boxes. The

the city. San Francisco magazine is the
monthly city magazine. You can find it at
newsstands everywhere.
Pharmacies

should be able to find one almost any-
where. Call % 800-WALGREEN for the
address and phone number of the nearest
store. Around Union Square, Walgreens is
San Francisco For Dummies, 4th Edition
292

at 135 Powell St. (% 415-391-4433), open
Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to
midnight and on Sunday from 9 a.m. to 
9 p.m., but the pharmacy has more-limited
hours. A branch on Divisadero Street at
Lombard has a 24-hour pharmacy.
Police
Call % 911 from any phone. No coins are
needed. The nonemergency number is 
% 415-553-0123.
Post Office
Dozens of post offices are located all
around the city. The closest to Union
Square is in Macy’s department store, 170
O’Farrell St. (% 800-275-8777).
Radio Stations
Find KQED, our National Public Radio affili-
ate, at 88.5 FM. News and sports may be
found at KCBS 710 AM.
Restrooms
Dark-green public bathrooms are on 
the waterfront at PIER 39, on Market 
Street near the cable-car turnaround on
Powell Street, and by the Civic Center. 
The restrooms cost 25¢ and are clean 
and safe. Also try hotels, department
stores, museums, and service stations.
Restaurants usually let only patrons use
their bathrooms.
Safety
Walking around alone late at night is never
a good idea. San Francisco is relatively
safe, but it still has its share of muggings
and more-heinous crimes. Areas to be par-
ticularly careful in include the Tenderloin;
the lower Haight; the Mission District any-
where between 16th and 24th streets east
of Mission Street; lower Fillmore Street;
and South of Market, particularly on Sixth
and Seventh streets. Keep your wallet in
an inside coat pocket and don’t carry
around wads of cash. Try to avoid using
ATMs at night.
Smoking
Since January 1998, smoking has been
prohibited in bars. Smoking in restaurants
and public buildings is also illegal, which is
why you see so many well-dressed people
loitering on the sidewalks during their
coffee breaks.
Taxes
A sales tax of 8.5 percent is added to all
purchases except snack food. The hotel
and parking garage tax is 14 percent.
Taxis
Outside of Union Square, expect to have
trouble hailing a cab on the street; you’ll
have to call for one instead. Try Yellow Cab
(% 415-626-2345), Veteran’s Cab (% 415-
648-1313), Desoto Cab (% 415-970-1300),
or Luxor Cabs (% 415-282-4141).
Time Zone
California is on Pacific Standard Time,
three hours behind New York.
Transit Information
Calling % 415-817-1717 connects you to
all transit organizations.
Weather Updates
While in town, turn to one of the news 
stations on the radio (try KCBS 710 AM).
Otherwise, www.sanfrancisco.
citysearch.com lists comprehensive
forecasts.

Bureau
P.O. Box 429097; 900 Market St., San
Francisco, CA 94142-9097 (% 415-391-2000;
www.sfvisitor.org).
Call or write the Convention and Visitors
Bureau if you’d like to receive a nifty book-
let with lots of useful information, including
maps and a calendar of events. Of course,
the slant is toward the advertisers, so take
those glossy ads lightly. There is a $3 mail-
ing charge. If you have a fax and a touch-
tone phone, use the toll-free number for
automated 24-hour fax service and “fast
facts.”
Napa Valley Conference and Visitors

1310 Napa Town Center, Napa, CA 94559
(% 707-226-7459; www.napavalley.
com).

This is the second-busiest visitor center in
California, which either says something
about our fondness for wine or something
about the beauty of the area (or both).
They’ll send you a free brochure and a 
list of hotels on request; for $10 (plastic
accepted) they’ll mail you a 120-page maga-
zine, suggested itineraries, and a handsome
map of the area.
