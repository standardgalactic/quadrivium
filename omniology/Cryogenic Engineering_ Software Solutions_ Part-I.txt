Message by Prof. R.G. 
Scurlock,  Emeritus Professor of 
Cryogenic Engineering
formerly
Director, Institute of Cryogenics, 
University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.
I should like to make several points briefly.
Firstly, I congratulate my former student in producing an up-to-date book on the properties and 
applications of cryogenic liquids. This is particularly important today for the development of computer 
modeling and CryoFD in the ever expanding range of cryogenic systems.
Secondly, since Dr. Thirumaleshwar mentions in Chapter 1 my proposal to extend the temperature range 
for cryogenics up to 250K, I should like to describe some of the background to the proposal.
In the 1970/71 definition of cryogenics by Kurti et al (specifying the temperature range up to 120K) they 
were aware of the complications presented by the development of cryo-medicine, cryo-surgery and cryo-
preservation, using temperatures well above 120K but well below the temperatures of the refrigeration 
industry. They therefore proposed the term “cryology” to embrace a wider temperature range up towards 
the ice-point. This proposal has not progressed into common usage, and the Gap between 120K and 
250K has remained in confusion with poor coverage in both research and teaching.
In 1979, when the Institute of Cryogenics, Southampton University, U.K. was set up, it rapidly became 
almost overwhelmed by the problems being met by innovative industries using temperatures in the Gap. 
Some 50% of the research and teaching activities became centred on these higher temperatures. What 
was found was that the heat transfer by convection, the unstable evaporation, the convective flow patterns 
etc in the temperature Gap were similar in dominance and kind to those at the lower temperatures 
below 120K; and it was possible to develop a unified approach, via Cryogenic Fluid Dynamics, CryoFD, 
applicable to all fluids, liquids and gases, below the ice-point.
It followed that cryogenics should be redefined to include the 1970/71 Cryology, (ie. the whole temperature 
range up to the ice-point) and this was first proposed in 1992 in “History and Origins of Cryogenics”, 
and again in 2006 in “Low-Loss Storage and Handling of Cryogenic Liquids”.

Message by Prof. R.G. Scurlock,  Emeritus Professor of Cryogenic Engineering
However, some of the refrigeration industry has objected to being included as a sub-set of Cryogenics, 
and the most recent proposal in 2013 has removed their temperature range below the ice-point down 
to -23C from the definition.
The current proposal is therefore that Cryogenics should cover all temperatures up to 120K and the 
Temperature Gap up to 250K.
Finally, some examples of current activity in the Gap include:
a)	 The requirement for computer-controlled freezing protocols for the cryopreservation of 
stem cells.
b)	 The development of green energy cryogenic fuels for driving transport by sea, road and  rail 
using LNG under pressure.
c)	 Providing a solution to engine failures from the formation of water ice crystals in jet fuel on 
long-haul aircraft flying in the stratosphere at temperatures down to 200K.
d)	 Other problems close to the ice-point, which have not been regarded as the province of the 
refrigeration industry.
My good wishes go to Dr. Thirumaleshwar for his continuing success in the field of Cryogenics.

Preface
Preface
According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ‘Cryogenic temperature range’ 
generally refers to temperatures below -150 C i.e. 123 K. Most of the ‘permanent gases’ liquefy below this 
temperature. Temperature range from 123 K up to room temperature is the domain of ‘Refrigeration’. 
However, some authorities believe that cryogenic temperature range should be extended up to 0 deg. 
C or 273 K. Prof. Ralph Scurlock, former Director of Institute of Cryogenics, Southampton, UK, under 
whom the author studied, states: “I regard the temperature range should extend upwards towards 273K. 
However, the refrigeration people objected to their temperatures, from -22 C up to zero C, being a 
subset of my cryogenics. So my last suggestion was for Cryogenics to extend upwards to 250K or -23 C 
to avoid their objection!”
Cryogenic fluids of interest are: Air, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon, Methane, Hydrogen, Neon, Fluorine, 
Helium-4, Helium-3 etc.
However, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Methane, Hydrogen and Helium-4 and Helium-3 attract more attention 
because of their applications.
Applications of cryogenics are many and in diverse fields. To name a few areas: Rocket propulsion, High 
energy Physics, Electronics, Superconducting magnets and their various applications such as magnetic 
levitation, whole body imaging etc., Space simulation and cryo-pumping, Medical applications to preserve 
whole blood, tissue, bone marrow, and animal semen for long periods of time, cryo-destruction of 
cancerous tissues, Food processing, Manufacturing processes in mechanical and chemical engineering, 
Recycling of plastic materials etc.
In engineering colleges, post graduate degree in cryogenic engineering is offered with the following 
general syllabus:
Introduction, properties of cryogenic fluids, properties of materials at low temperatures.
Gas liquefaction systems.
Gas separation and gas-purification systems.
Cryogenic refrigeration systems.
Storage and handling of cryogens.
Cryogenic instrumentation.
Vacuum technology.
Applications of cryogenic systems.

Preface
This series, viz. Cryogenic Engineering: Software solutions focuses on the solutions of problems in 
cryogenic engineering using software such as Mathcad, Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and EXCEL. 
Only the essential theory and summary of equations required for calculations are given at the beginning 
of each chapter. Thus, this book should be helpful to students when used in conjunction with any standard 
text book on this subject.
Advantages of using computer software to solve problems are many:
i.	 It helps in solving the problems fast and accurately
ii.	 Parametric analysis (what-if analysis) and graphical visualization is done very easily. This helps 
in an in-depth analysis of the problem.
iii.	Once a particular type of problem is solved, it can be used as a template and solving similar 
problems later becomes extremely easy.
iv.	 In addition, one can plot the data, curve fit, write functions for various properties or calculations 
and re-use them.
v.	 These possibilities create interest, curiosity and wonder in the minds of students and enthuse 
them to know more and work more.
This book, viz. Cryogenic Engineering: Software solutions – Part-I deals with: Introduction, properties 
of cryogenic fluids and properties of materials at low temperatures. Primarily, here we have a collection 
of information and data from various sources, the focus being on the data that will be useful for 
engineers to design cryogenic systems. Several Functions are written in EES, EXCEL and Mathcad for 
various thermal and mechanical properties of materials. These Functions should be very much useful 
in executing computer designs of cryogenic systems without any need to refer to data tables and graphs 
for properties of materials. Several graphs for cryogenic properties of materials from NIST publications 
are also presented. Rest of the chapters will be dealt with in subsequent parts which will follow.
S.I. Units are used throughout this book. Wide variety of worked examples presented in the book should 
be useful for those appearing for University, AMIE and Engineering Services examinations.
Acknowledgements: Firstly, I would like to thank all my students, who have been an inspiration to me 
in all my academic efforts.
I am grateful to Rev. Fr. Valerian D’Souza, former Director of St. Joseph Engineering College (SJEC), 
Mangalore, for his love, deep concern and support in all my academic pursuits.

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Main source of Helium is natural gas where He4 content may be from 0.2% to as high as 1 or 2%. Helium 
is produced from natural gas in a sequence of purification steps.
Liquid Nitrogen (LN2): LN2 is a clear, colorless fluid. It is produced by distillation of liquid air, since 
atmospheric air contains about 79% (by volume) of nitrogen. LN2 boils at 77.4 K at atmospheric pressure. 
By varying the pressure over LN2, we can get temperatures from 62 K (at 128 mbar ) to 126 K (at 33 bar). 
Density of LN2 is 800 g/litre at 77 K, slightly less than that of water. Latent heat of vaporization of LN2 
is about 199 J/g, i.e. 1 Watt of heat input evaporates about 22.6 cm^3/h of LN2. Its thermal conductivity 
is about 1.38 mW/cm.K, and its viscosity is about 1500 micropoises. One litre of LN2 produces about 
700 litres of gas at NTP. Main applications are: in food freezing and preservation of blood, bull semen, 
tissues etc. Also it is used as an inert atmosphere, in cooling applications for microelectronics, metallurgy, 
vacuum technology etc.
Liquid Oxygen (LOX): LOX has a characteristic blue color. LOX boils at 90.2 K at atmospheric pressure 
and freezes at 54.4 K (at 1.2 mbar). It is slightly magnetic while other cryogenic fluids are not. It is 
produced commercially by distillation of liquid air. Its density at 90 K is 1140 g/litre slightly larger than 
that of water. One Watt of heat input results in an evaporation of 15 cm^3/h of liquid. LOX reacts with 
hydrocarbons, so contact with oil, grease etc should be avoided. One litre of LOX produces about 700 
litres of gas at NTP. Oxygen is toxic in concentrations of 60% at atmospheric pressure.

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Application areas: steel mills, cutting, combustion furnaces, medical, space etc.
Liquid Argon: Obtained from liquid air by distillation, since is present in air at about 0.93% by volume. 
Liquid argon boils at 87.3 K at atmospheric pressure. Temp interval between its boiling and melting 
temperatures is only 3.44 K. By varying the pressure over liquid argon the range of temp obtainable 
is: 83.8 K (at 690 mbar) to 150.9 K (at 50 bar). Density of liquid argon is 1400 g/litre at 87 K. Argon is 
inert and non-toxic. Liquid argon is colorless and clear. Solid Argon sinks in liquid argon. One Watt of 
heat input results in an evaporation of 16 cm^3/h of liquid. One litre of liquid produces about 784 litres 
of gas at NTP. Main application is as an inert atmosphere in welding, micro-component industries etc.
Liquid Neon: It is also produced as a by-product in an air separation plant. It is a clear, colorless liquid 
which boils at 27.1 K at atmospheric pressure and freezes at 24.6 K, 1 atm. Neon is about 10 times more 
expensive than helium. Neon boils at a higher temp as compared to hydrogen, but it has the advantage 
that it is inert and has a higher heat of vaporization per unit volume as compared to hydrogen, making 
it an attractive refrigerant. By varying the pressure over liquid neon the range of temp obtainable is: 
24.5 K (at 425 mbar) to 44.5 K (at 27.8 bar). Liquid density is 1210 g/litre at 27 K. One Watt of heat 
input results in an evaporation of 35 cm^3/h of liquid. One litre of liquid produces about 1350 litres of 
gas at NTP. Main application is in lighting, ex: advertisement signboards etc.
Liquid Fluorine: It is light yellow in color, possesses pungent odour, and has a normal boiling point 
of 85.4 K. It freezes in to a yellow solid at 53.6 K, 1 atm, and on sub-cooling to 45.6 K, it transforms 
in to a white solid. Liquid Fluorine is the densest of cryogenic liquids, its density at normal boiling 
point being 1510 g/litre. Fluorine is highly reactive. It reacts with almost all inorganic substances; even 
ceramic powders can burn in fluorine. If it comes in contact with hydrocarbons, it reacts hypergolically 
with a high heat of reaction and the metal container may even be ignited. Stainless steel and Monel are 
generally used in Fluorine systems. Fluorine is highly toxic. For an exposure time of 1 h, fluorine is fatal 
in concentration of 200 ppm. Max. permissible concentration for human exposure is approximately 1 
ppm-hr. One Watt of heat input results in an evaporation of 13.75 cm^3/h of liquid.
Main applications [11]: In Industry, Uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is produced by direct fluorination of 
uranium oxide or UF4 using fluorine. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or sodium fluoride are produced from 
fluorine. Also, as a rocket fuel, it has high specific impulse.
Liquid Hydrogen: Hydrogen is produced by many commercial processes. The most economical process 
is the one that involves catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons (such as: methane, propane, butane and 
others) present in natural gas or casing-head gases by water/steam. Tonnage production is from gases 
produced in oil refining using cryogenic techniques. Small scale production of hydrogen may be done by 
water electrolysis; however, this process is quite expensive production of 1 kg of hydrogen may require 
up to 60 or 70 kWh.

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Hydrogen is the lightest of gases and is used in balloons! Under atm pressure, it boils at 20.2 K. By varying 
the pressure over liquid hydrogen, the range of temp obtainable is: 13.8 K (at 70 mbar) to 33 K (at 12.7 
bar). It is also the lightest liquid, with a density of 70 g/lit at 20 K, and is used in rockets as a fuel. Heat 
of evaporation of LH2 is about 445 J/g, and 1 Watt of heat input evaporates about 115 cm^3 of liquid 
per hour. One litre of liquid, on evaporation, produces about 780 litres of gas at NTP. 
Main application of hydrogen is as a rocket fuel. Also, it is used in high energy physics, hydrogen bubble 
chambers, nuclear applications, industry, chemistry etc.
Hydrogen exists in two molecular states: ortho and para. In ortho-hydrogen (o-H2), spin vectors are in 
the same direction and in para-hydrogen (p-H2), the spin vectors are in parallel direction. Equilibrium 
percentage of o_h2 and p-H2 varies with temp as follows:
T (K)
20.39
30
40
70
120
200
250
300
% p-H2 in equilib. hydrogen
99.8
97.02
88.73
55.88
32.96
25.97
25.26
25.07
Note that at room temp hydrogen is a mixture of 75% ortho and 25% parahydrogen. This is known as 
normal-hydrogen. As temp comes down, % of parahydrogen increases. At equilibrium, liquid hydrogen 
contains 99.8% parahydrogen and 0.2% orthohydrogen, and may be treated as parahydrogen for all 
practical purposes.
Ortho-para conversion is an exothermic process. And, this conversion process is very slow in liquid 
state and can occur in gaseous state only in the presence of a catalyst.In liquid staste, heat of conversion 
is about 706 J/g, which is more than the heat of evaporation of LH2 (i.e. 447 J/g). Therefore, if LH2 is 
stored in a dewar without converting it from ortho to para during the liquefaction, there will be very 
high evaporation losses! And, it is customary to adopt ortho-para conversion using a catalyst during the 
liquefaction process itself. Solid catalysts used are: activated carbon, metal oxides, hydroxides of iron, 
nickel, chromium or manganese.
Hydrogen burns in the presence of oxygen or air and the flame propagates at a very high speed of about 
2.7 m/s. Further, hydrogen ignites in air at atmospheric pressure over a wide range of concentrations, i.e. 
in the range 4% to 75% of hydrogen (by volume). Therefore, while handling hydrogen, attention should 
be given to both the fire and explosion hazards.

Liquid Helium [1,7,10]: Helium is a very special fluid. It does not freeze under its own vapor pressure. 
To freeze liquid helium, at absolute zero temp, we have to apply a pressure of about 2.5 MPa over the 
liquid! See the phase diagram below:

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Helium has two stable isotopes: He4 and He3. He4 is more abundant and He3 is rare, and therefore 
more expensive. He4 is generally separated from Natural gas where the concentration of He4 may be 0.1 
to 0.5%. Helium is mainly obtained from Natural gas wells located in USA, Poland, Russia and Algeria. 
World consumption of He4 is about 35 million m^3/year. Main applications are in: balloons, diving, 
inert atmosphere, welding, leak detection, pressurization in rockets, nuclear engineering etc.
Liquid helium boils at 4.216 K at atmospheric pressure. By varying pressure over liquid helium 
temperature range obtainable is: 0.1 K (at 0.1 mbar) to 5.2 K (at 2.26 bar). It is a very light liquid, 
density being about 125 g/litre at 4.2 K, i.e. about one-eighth that of water. It has very low latent heat 
of evaporation ( = 20.9 J/g). One Watt of heat input results in an evaporation of 1.4 lit/hour of liquid. 
And, evaporation of 1 litre of liquid results in 750 litres of gas at NTP.
Helium-4 vapors are quite dense; vapor at 4.2 K weighs 17 g/litre. As a consequence, 100 litres of vapor 
at 4.2 K is equivalent to 10 m^3 of gas at NTP.
Also, enthalpy of vapor is quite large: as an example, to cool 1 kg of copper from 300 K to 4.2 K, we 
need 30 litres of helium without using the enthalpy of vapor, whereas if we use the vapor enthalpy also, 
we will need only 0.4 litres of helium.
If we pre-cool the copper with liquid nitrogen to 77 K, then to cool 1 kg of copper from 77 K to 4.2 K 
we will need about 0.5 litres of liquid helium without using the enthalpy of vapor, and 0.2 litres of liquid 
helium using the vapor enthalpy.
Main applications of helium are [11]:

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Helium, which is a rare gas, is the most difficult gas to liquefy. See from the phase diagram above that 
there is no triple point for helium as for other fluids. Instead, there are two different liquid phases: 
Helium-I (i.e. normal liquid) and Helium-II, i.e. the superfluid. The two liquid phases are separated by 
the Lambda line, which occurs at ‘Lambda point’ temperature of 2.17 K and a pressure of 50 mbar.
Several properties undergo drastic changes at lambda point temp:
Specific heat: At 4.2 K the sp. heat value is about 4.18 J/g.K, and as the temp is decreased from 4.2 K, 
the sp. heat goes on increasing up to the lambda point and reaches a value of about 8 J/g.K, and then 
decreases, as shown below:

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Note that the sp. heat curve resembles the shape of greek letter lambda.
Thermal conductivity: LHe-I is like an insulator! Its thermal conductivity is about 0.27 mW/cm.K 
whereas the thermal conductivity of LHe-II is very large, i.e. about 8000 W/cm.K at 1.9 K, i.e about 
1000 times better than that of copper! As a result, there is no temperature stratification or presence of 
bubbles in a superfluid helium bath.
Large thermal conductivity and specific heats of Helium-II find applications in cooling of 
superconducting magnets.
Viscosity: Helium-II or superfluid helium behaves as if it has zero viscosity! Helium-I (i.e. above lambda 
point temperature of 2.17 K) has a small viscosity of about 30 micropoises. Helium-II, i.e. below the 
lambda point temperature, the viscosity of He-II depends on the method used for measurement of 
viscosity: (a) by damping of disc oscillations in the liquid, the viscosity is above 5 micropoises, and (b) 
by measurement of flow in narrow slits (10-3 Angstroms to 10-4 mm), the viscosity is lower than 0.001 
micropoises. This is shown below:
This behavior is explained by the two-fluid model of Tisza:
As per the two fluid model, the liquid He-II is imagined to be a mixture of two fluids: the normal fluid 
and the superfluid; and, the superfluid possesses zero entropy and can move past other fluids and solid 
boundaries with zero friction. With this model, liquid He-II has a composition of normal and superfluid 
that varies with temperature, the liquid composition being 100% superfluid at absolute zero temp and 
at the lambda point the liquid composition is 100% normal fluid.

Introduction and Properties of Cryogenic fluids
Two interesting phenomena observed with liquid He-II are:
a)	 Rollin film:
Here, levels of superfluids in two reservoirs, separated by a solid boundary, tend to equalize with the 
superfluid creeping in a thin film (30 nm) along the solid boundary. This effect, known as ‘mechano-
caloric effect’ is shown below:
Displacement velocity may be 25 cm/s. The film flows from cold to hot places, and evaporates at the 
lambda temp. Thus, the creeping film climbs along the neck of cryostats and along the pumping lines! 
So, it is essential to have film-burners or diaphragms at temperatures less than 1 K.

b)	 Fountain effect or thermo-mechanical effect:
As shown below, a U-tube is filled with a fine powder (alumina) and when heat is applied to the U-tube, 
superfluid flows towards the hot point and the normal fluid is pushed out through the capillary in a 
fountain. Height of the fountain may reach even one metre!
Helium-3 [1,7,10]:
Helium -3 is generally produced in nuclear reactions and is therefore very expensive. Normal boiling 
point of He-3 is 3.2 K and density of liquid at the normal boiling point is 0.05895 g/cm^3. Heat of 
vaporization at the normal boiling point is 8.49 J/g. Range of temp available by varying the pressure 
over He-3 is 0.3 K at 0.001 mbar to 3.33 K at 1.16 bar.
One Watt of heat input evaporates about 3 litres/hour of liquid helium 3. And, one litre of liquid produces 
about 460 litres of gas at NTP. Density of He-3 at 300 K is about 59 g/lit.
As in the case of liquid He-4, liquid He-3 remains in the liquid state under its own vapor pressure down 
to absolute zero temp. He-3 must be compressed to 29.3 atm at 0.32 K (the min. point in the freezing 
curve, see the fig. below) before it will solidify.

An important application of He3 is to continuously produce a temp of a few milli-Kelvin in ‘dilution 
refrigerators’ where a mixture of He4 and He3 is used. This topic will be discussed further in the chapter 
on Cryogenic Refrigeration.
Other applications of He3 are in medical imaging and in neutron detectors.

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
2	 Properties of materials at 
low temperatures
Learning objectives:
1.	 In this chapter, topics on ‘Low temp properties of materials’, such as mechanical properties, 
thermal properties, electrical properties and properties of some Type-I and Type-II and High 
temp. superconductors, are dealt with.
2.	 First, a very useful compilation of material properties from various sources is given.
3.	 Of particular interest are the polynomial curve fit equations for properties at low temperatures, 
and in some cases, graphs given by the NIST-Cryogenics website.
4.	 Several Functions are written in EES, EXCEL and Mathcad for thermal and mechanical 
properties of most of the materials of interest in cryogenics. This will make computer designs 
of cryogenic systems very easy. When no equations are available from the NIST- cryogenics site, 
graphs from standard text books are digitized and data is used either to get curve fit equations 
or to prepare look up tables for interpolation.
5.	 Many numerical problems are solved to illustrate the use of computer calculations.

Properties at ambient temperatures:
Properties of materials undergo substantial changes – sometimes, dramatic – as temperature is lowered 
from ambient to cryogenic range (i.e. below 150 K).
Materials of interest are: Stainless steels (SS) of various grades, Aluminium and its alloys, copper and 
its alloys, plastics etc.
To start with, we show below the properties of Aluminium, copper and SS:

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
In addition to Young’s Modulus, E, there are two other moduli defined:
a)	 Shear modulus, G: defined as the rate of change of shear stress with respect to shear strain at 
constant temperature in the elastic region; and 
b)	 Bulk modulus, B: defined as the rate of change of pressure (corresponding to a uniform three-
dimensional stress) with respect to volumetric strain (change in volume per unit volume) at 
constant temperature.
These three moduli are related through Poisson’s ratio v, (i.e. the ratio of strain in one direction due to 
a stress applied perpendicular to that direction to the strain parallel to the applied stress) as follows:
Typical values of Poisson’s ratio for a few materials:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

m)	Emissivity (ε) [1]: 
Emissivity is the ratio of the energy emitted by the material to the energy that would be emitted by a 
‘perfect black body’, at the same absolute temperature. ‘Monochromatic emissivity’ refers to a particular 
wavelength whereas ‘total emissivity’ considers the total energy emitted by a black body, integrated over 
all the wave lengths. In engineering calculations ‘total emissivity’ is used.
Emissivity depends on the surface, its surface treatment, the temp and of course, the wavelength 
of radiation.
Values of emissivity for a few materials are given below:
Radiation from a ‘gray’ surface of emissivity (ε) at a temp of T (K) is = Q (W), given by:

Net radiation between two gray surfaces temperatures T1, T2 (in K) is:
where E is the Emissivity factor which depends on the emissivities of two surfaces, their geometric 
configuration and orientation and the type of reflection (i.e. specular or diffuse).
For the three important cases of a small object in a large surrounding, two infinitely long parallel plates, 
two infinitely long concentric cylinders and concentric spheres, we have the net radiation heat transfer 
between the surfaces, given by the following [15]:

(n) Superconductivity [1,2,9]:
Certain elements, alloys and compounds, when cooled below a certain temp (called transition or critical 
temp. Tc), lose their electrical resistance, and the material is said to be ‘superconducting’. The phenomenon 
of superconductivity was discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911.
It is observed that if an external magnetic field is applied, when a ‘critical field, Hc’ is reached, 
superconductivity is destroyed and the material becomes ‘normal’.

Depending upon the magnetization characteristics, superconductors are classified as of Type-I or Type-II:
Fig. 2.1.2m1. Magnetization curve for Type-I and Type-II conductors
Type-I superconductor has one critical field, Hc. Type-II has two critical fields: Hc1 and Hc2 as shown above.
Type-I Superconductors are perfectly diamagnetic, i.e. magnetic field is expelled from a superconductor, 
as shown below:

Variation of critical field with temp:
This variation is parabolic:
Fig. 2.1.2m3. Magnetic Field strength vs Temp for some Superconductors
The magnetic field-temperature characteristics of a Type I superconductor is given by an empirical 
relationship between the critical temperature and field,
where H0 is the threshold field at T = 0 K, and Tc is the transition temp at zero field.
Silsbee hypothesis [1]: “When the electric current flowing in a superconductor produces a magnetic field 
at the surface of the material which equals or exceeds the threshold field, the normal state is restored.”
The current corresponding to the threshold field is called the threshold current.
For a long wire of diameter d, the magnetic field produced at the surface of the wire by an electric current 
I is: H = 0.4 * I / d; i.e. the threshold current is:
IT = 2.5 * HT * d 
Here, HT is in Gauss, d in cm, and IT in Amps.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

i.e. E is available only for Aluminum and SS=AISI 302. 
Also, for many materials, properties may be available only down to 100 K and not below.
Further, EES is primarily an equation solver and not a ‘cryogenic specific’ software.
Therefore, first preference should be to use the equations/graphs from NIST-Cryogenics data, and if 
any data is not available there, then check with EES.

“Prob.2.2.16 An air core magnet is used to produce a field of 100,000 Gauss and is constructed of 10,000 
turns of Aluminium wire having a total electric resistance of 25 ohms at 0 C. The length of the solenoid 
is 50 cm, and the solenoid may be assumed to be an ideal coil, for which magnetic field strength is given 
by: H = 0.4 * pi * N * I / L, where N = total no. of turns, I is the current in Amps, and L is the length 
of solenoid in cm. Determine the power dissipated at 0 C and the power dissipated if the coil were 
immersed in liquid hydrogen at 20 K, for the same field strength. [1]”

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
Solution:
When these Functions are written in EXCEL VBA, they are available for use in the ‘User defined’ category 
of EXCEL Functions.
Following is the worksheet which gives thermal cond. values of these materials at 80 K:
Note that the Formula entered in cell D4 can be seen in the Formula bar; similarly the formulas for 
other materials are entered in cells D5 to D15.
Prob.2.3.3 Write EXCEL-VBA Functions for the thermal conductivity integrals for SS-304, OFHC 
copper, 6061- T6-Aluminium, Beryllium copper, SS-304L, Brass, Invar, Lead, Nylon and Teflon and 
Pyrex, between temperatures Tmin and Tmax.
Solution:
Thermal conductivity integrals are useful to calculate the heat loss through the necks of Dewars or 
Cryostats when the temperatures vary from a low temperature Tmin to a higher temperature Tmax ,and 
the thermal conductivity also varies with temperature.
If the area of cross-section is A (m^2) and length, L (m), and k (W/m.K) is given as function of T, we 
have the heat transfer Q given by:

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
Quantity within the Integral can be calculated for various materials of interest, if the relation between 
k and T are known.
Since we have already written VBA Functions for thermal conductivities of these materials as functions 
of T, now it is easy to calculate the thermal cond. integrals.
There are two cases: (i) thermal conductivities as function of T are presented in a tabular form, or 
(ii) thermal conductivities as functions of T are given in a formula. 
Methods of calculating thermal conductivity integrals for both these cases in EXCEL-VBA are now 
explained:
Remember that integral ׬ ݇ሺܶሻǤ ݀ܶ is the area under the curve of k vs T. Numerical method of calculating 
this area is to divide the area in to a large no. of sub-areas of trapezoidal shape and sum the areas of 
each trapezoid.
Case 1: Thermal conductivity integral when k vs T is given in a Tabular form:
We write a general VBA Function to calculate the area when the range of x-values and the range of 
y-values are given:
Above simple Function has two inputs: x-values range and y-values range. It calculates the Integral by 
summing up the areas of trapezoids.

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
Now, use the above written Function to find out thermal cond. integral between 20 K and 80 K for SS 304:
In cell E34 the Function is used; see the Formula bar and observe the range of x-values and y-values. 
The result is 331.3487 W/m.
Note: Accuracy of calculated value obviously depends on the number of trapezoids. i.e. the increment 
in value of T. Here, we have used ΔT = 5 deg. If we use ΔT = 1 deg., the accuracy will be better.
Case 2: Thermal conductivity integral when k vs T is given in a Functional form:
Here, we write a VBA Function which has a flexibility to change the number of sub-divisions (or 
trapezoids).

In the above Function, Inputs are temp limits, Tmin and Tmax and no. of sub-divisions, N.
As an example of use of this Function, solve the problem solved earlier when k vs T was given in Tabular 
form, i.e. find the thermal conductivity integral for SS 304 between the temp limits of 5 K and 80 K:
The Function is entered in cell E36, see the Formula bar. Note that we have used N = 100, i.e. 100 sub-
divisions. And the values of thermal conductivity integrals obtained by both the methods are quite close.
If we use N = 500, we get:
Answer in cell E36 is almost the same as obtained earlier with N = 100.

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
As a first step, we have VBA Function for linear interpolation:
Above Interpolation Function has 3 inputs: the look up value for which the corresponding y value 
is required, the range of known x values and the range of known y values. It does the simple 
linear interpolation.
Now, this Interpolation function is used to get the corresponding value of cp for a given value of T from 
the Table of T vs cp for Lead:
Prob.2.3.8 Using the above written EXCEL VBA Functions for sp. heat of SS304, SS304L, AL-6061-T6, 
OFHC copper, Nylon, Teflon, Brass, Pyrex and Lead, determine the sp. heats of these materials at 25 K.

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
Solution:
Following is the EXCEL Worksheet:
Note that in cell C135, we have the cp of SS304 at 20 K. Function used can be seen in the Formula bar.
Similarly, cp of other materials is calculated.

Prob.2.3.9 Write EXCEL VBA Functions for sp. heat integrals of of SS304, SS304L, AL-6061-T6, OFHC 
copper, Nylon, Teflon, Brass, Pyrex and Lead, between the temperatures Tmin and Tmax.
Solution:
Remember that when a mass m (kg) is cooled from a temp of Tmax to Tmin, the amount of heat rejected, 
Q (J) is given by:

Since we have already written VBA Functions for cp as a function of T for many materials, it is now 
easy to write the Functions for Sp. heat integrals (just as we wrote for Thermal conductivity integrals):

Propertie s of materi al s a t low temperature
For SS304:
In the above Function, inputs are: temp limits Tmin and Tmax and no. of trapezoidal subdivisions, Note 
that we can choose the no. of trapezoidal divisions, N. (say 100, 200…or 1000 etc.). Obviously, larger 
the no. of divisions, higher is the accuracy.

Solution:
See Prob. 2.2.10. Here, original graphs from Ref.[1] were digitized using the PlotDigitizer [Ref: 13]. The 
resulting data tables were transferred to EXCEL and plotted. The ‘Trendline’ menu was used to fit the 
plot to a 4th order polynomial. Then, the EES Functions were written using these curve-fit equations.
Here, we shall use the curve fit equations obtained in Prob.2.2.10 to write the VBA Functions for Yield 
stress vs Temp.

Prob.2.3.14 Use the VBA Functions written above for Young’s Modulii of SS 304, AL-2024-T4, BeCu, 
kMonel, Titanium, C1020 Steel and 9 % Ni Steel, to determine Young’s Modulus of those materials at 20 K.
Solution:
The EXCEL worksheet is given below:
In cell C271 Young’s Mod of SS304 is calculated as 198.8007 GPa. The Function used can be seen in the 
Formula bar.
Similarly, the Young’s Mod for other materials is calculated.

Prob.2.3.15 Using the above written VBA Functions, plot the variation of Young’s Modulus, Bulk 
Modulus and Shear Modulus for: (i) SS 304,(ii) AL-2024-T4 and (iii) Beryllium copper, for the temp 
range 5K to 300 K.
Solution:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
