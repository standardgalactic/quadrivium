Section 1
1.1 PURPOSE OF THE STANDARD FOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
The Standard for Program Management provides guidance on principles, practices, and activities of program 
management that are generally recognized to support good program management practices and that are applicable to 
most programs, most of the time.
u
u Principles of program management are tenets that are held to be true and important for the effective 
management of programs.
u
u Generally recognized means there is general consensus that the described principles, knowledge, and practices 
are valuable and useful.
u
u Good practice means there is general agreement that application of the principles, knowledge, and practices 
improves the management of programs and enhances the chances of program success, as measured by the 
extent and effectiveness of benefits delivery and realization. Good practice does not mean that all provisions of 
the standard are required to be applied to every program; an organization’s leaders, its program managers, its 
program teams, and its program management office (when one is employed) are responsible for determining 
what is most appropriate for any given program, based on the unique or specific requirements of the program 
and its sponsoring organization.
The Standard for Program Management is also intended to provide a common understanding of the role of a program 
manager in general, and especially when interacting with:
u
u Portfolio managers whose portfolio(s) include the program or its components;
u
u Project managers whose projects are part of the program;
u
u Program sponsors and other members of the program steering committee. This committee may be referred to as 
a program or portfolio governance board;
u
u Program or project management office;
u
u Program team members working on the program or on other subsidiary programs;
u
u Program beneficiaries; and
u
u Other stakeholders or stakeholder groups (e.g., organizational executives, business partners, clients, suppliers, 
vendors, leaders or political groups) that may influence the program.
The Standard for Program Management is intended to be applied according to the Project Management Institute’s 
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [5], which specifies obligations of responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty 
that program managers should abide by in the conduct of their work. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 
requires that practitioners demonstrate a commitment to ethical and professional conduct, and carries with it the 
obligation to comply with laws, regulations, and organizational and professional policies.

1.2 WHAT IS A PROGRAM?
A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated 
manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.
Managing projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities as a program enhances the delivery of benefits by 
ensuring that the strategies and work plans of program components are responsively adapted to component outcomes, 
or to changes in the direction or strategies of the sponsoring organization. Programs are conducted primarily to deliver 
benefits to the sponsor organizations or constituents of the sponsoring organization. Programs may deliver benefits, 
for example, by enhancing current capabilities, facilitating change, creating or maintaining assets, offering new 
products and services, or developing new opportunities to generate or preserve value. Such benefits are delivered to the 
sponsoring organization as outcomes that provide utility to the organization and the program’s intended beneficiaries 
or stakeholders.
Programs deliver their intended benefits primarily through component projects and subsidiary programs that 
are pursued to produce outputs and outcomes. The components of a program are related through their pursuit of 
complementary goals that each contribute to the delivery of benefits.
Component projects or programs that do not advance common or complementary goals; or that do not jointly contribute 
to the delivery of common benefits; or that are related only by common sources of support, technology, or stakeholders 
are often better managed as portfolios rather than as programs (see The Standard for Portfolio Management [2]).

4	
Section 1
The following is a list of program elements and their definitions:
u
u Components are projects, subsidiary programs, or other related activities conducted to support a program.
u
u Projects are temporary endeavors undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result, as described fully 
in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) [1]. Projects are used to generate 
the outputs or outcomes required by programs, within defined constraints, such as budget, time, specifications, 
scope, and quality.
u
u Subsidiary programs, sometimes referred to as subprograms, are programs sponsored and conducted to pursue 
a subset of goals important to the primary program. As an example, a program to develop a new electric car may 
sponsor other programs related to the development of new motor, battery, and charging station technologies. 
Each of these other programs would be managed as described in this standard and also monitored and managed 
as a component of the sponsoring program.
u
u Other program-related activities are work processes or activities that are being conducted to support 
a program, but that are not directly tied to the subsidiary programs or projects sponsored or conducted 
by a program. Examples of processes and activities sponsored by programs may include those related to 
training, planning, program-level control, reporting, accounting, and administration. Operational activities 
or maintenance functions that are directly related to a program’s components may be considered as other 
program-related activities.
When used in the context of program management, the term activities should be read as program activities. 
Program activities are activities conducted to support a program, and not those activities performed during the 
course of a program’s component projects.
The primary difference between projects and programs is based on the recognition within programs that the strategies 
for delivering benefits may need to be optimized adaptively as the outcomes of components are individually realized. 
The best mechanism for delivering a program’s benefits may initially be ambiguous or uncertain. Outcomes delivered by 
a program’s components contribute to the delivery of the program’s intended benefits and, as necessary, to refinement 
of the strategy of the program and its components.
The primary value of managing an initiative as a program is based on the acknowledgement of the program manager’s 
readiness to adapt strategies to optimize the delivery of benefits to an organization. As a consequence of a program’s 
potential need to adapt to the outcomes and outputs of its components and its potential need to modify its strategy or 
plans, program components may be pursued in an iterative, nonsequential manner.

5
The program life cycle depicted in Figure 1-1 illustrates the nonsequential nature of a program’s delivery phase. 
In a program, the iterative pursuit of components is expected to produce a stream of outputs and outcomes that 
contribute to organizational benefits. Program benefits may be realized incrementally throughout the duration of the 
program or may be realized at or after the end of the program. The program life cycle is discussed in greater detail 
in Section 7 of this standard.

Section 1
One example of a program that delivers benefits incrementally is an organization-wide process improvement 
program. Such a program might be envisioned to pursue component projects to standardize and consolidate specific 
processes (e.g., financial control processes, inventory management processes, hiring processes, performance appraisal 
processes) and subsidiary programs to ensure that the benefits of consolidation are fully realized (e.g., to ensure 
adoption of the improved processes or to measure employee satisfaction and performance with the new processes). 
Each of these components may deliver incremental benefits as they are completed. The outcomes of components might 
trigger the initiation of new projects to further improve processes, satisfaction, and performance. However, the program 
would not be complete until all of the projects and subsidiary programs necessary for business improvement have 
delivered their intended program benefits.
Alternatively, programs may deliver intended benefits all at once—as a unified whole. In this case, the benefits of the 
program are not realized until the program is completed. A drug development program can be viewed as a program with 
unified benefits delivery, where the individual components of the program would not be expected to deliver benefits until 
the entire drug development program is successfully completed, the product is approved for sale, patients are treated 
with it, and the organization realizes benefits from its sale.
1.2.1 INITIATION OF PROGRAMS
Programs are generally initiated or recognized in two ways:
u
u Programs initiated to pursue new goals, objectives, or strategies are begun before the start of work on their 
component projects and programs. These programs are typically initiated to support new strategic goals and 
objectives; they enable an organization to pursue its vision and mission. Examples of such programs include 
programs initiated as part of an organization’s strategic planning process (such as part of a portfolio-based 
decision to develop a new product or service, or to expand into a new market), to influence human behavior (such 
as to raise awareness of healthy behaviors or of terrorist threats, or to ensure compliance with new regulations), 
or to respond to a crisis (e.g., to provide disaster relief or to manage a public health issue). These programs are 
generally supported from the beginning by program management activities.

7
u
u Programs may also be formed when an organization recognizes that its ongoing projects, programs, and other 
work are related by their pursuit of common outcomes, capabilities, objectives, or benefits (e.g., a process 
improvement program supported by previously independent software development initiatives), or a neighborhood 
revitalization program supported by building public parks and traffic control projects, and a community outreach 
program. These programs are often formed when an organization determines that organizational benefits would 
be more effectively realized by managing ongoing initiatives as a single program. Such programs are supported 
by program management activities after some or all of their projects have been initiated.
Newly initiated or identified programs should all be managed according to the principles and life cycle management 
guidance described in the subsequent sections of this standard. It is incumbent on a program manager to ensure, for 
example, that activities important to program definition be completed for programs whose projects and other programs 
may have already begun.
1.2.2 THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS
The relationship among portfolios, programs, and projects is as follows:
u
u A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives.
u
u Programs consist of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated 
manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Programs are common elements of 
portfolios, conducted to deliver benefits important to an organization’s strategic objectives.
u
u Projects, whether they are managed independently or as part of a program, are temporary endeavors that are 
undertaken to create unique products, services, or results.
Programs and projects, as significant elements of an organization’s portfolio, are conducted to produce the outputs 
and outcomes required to support an organization’s strategic objectives.
Figure 1-2 provides an example of how a portfolio of programs and projects may be organized to pursue an 
organization’s strategy.

1.3 WHAT IS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT?
Program management is defined as the application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve the 
program objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing program components individually. 
Program management involves the alignment of program components to ensure that program goals are achieved and 
program benefits are optimally delivered. Program management is performed by a program manager who is authorized 
by the organization to lead the team(s) responsible for achieving program goals and objectives.

The program manager ensures the effective alignment, integration, and control of a program’s projects, subsidiary 
programs, and other program activities by actions taken in five interrelated and interdependent Program Management 
Performance Domains: Program Strategy Alignment, Program Benefits Management, Program Stakeholder Engagement, 
Program Governance, and Program Life Cycle Management. Program Management Performance Domains are 
complementary groupings of related areas of activity or function that uniquely characterize and differentiate the activities 
found in one performance domain from the others within the full scope of program management work. These performance 
domains are discussed in detail in subsequent sections of this standard. Through these Program Management Performance 
Domains, the program manager oversees and analyzes component interdependencies to determine the optimal approach 
for managing program components. Actions related to these interdependencies may include:
u
u Define how the outputs and outcomes of a program’s components are expected to contribute to the program’s 
delivery of its intended benefits and support the organization’s strategy.
u
u Monitor benefits realization of program components to ensure they remain strategically aligned to the 
organization’s goals.
u
u Ensure that the outputs and outcomes of a program’s components are effectively communicated and considered 
so that a program can effectively optimize the pursuit of its intended benefits and provide value.
u
u Lead and coordinate program activities (for example, financing and procurement) across all program components, 
work, or phases.
u
u Communicate with and report to stakeholders to provide an integrated perspective on all activities being pursued 
within the program.
u
u Proactively assess and respond to risks spanning multiple components of the program.
u
u Align program efforts with the organizational strategy and the program’s business case.
u
u Resolve scope, cost, schedule, resource, quality, and risk issues within a shared governance structure.
u
u Tailor program management activities, processes, and interfaces to effectively address cultural, socioeconomic, 
political, and environmental differences in programs.
Program managers apply program management principles to ensure that programs and their components are 
appropriately planned, controlled, and completed, and that program benefits are appropriately delivered and sustained.

1.4 THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIO, PROGRAM, AND PROJECT 
MANAGEMENT, AND THEIR ROLES IN ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT 
MANAGEMENT (OPM)
To understand the relationships among portfolio, program, and project management, it is important to recognize the 
similarities and differences among these disciplines. It is also helpful to understand how they relate to organizational 
project management (OPM).
Portfolio, program, and project management all provide a structured means for organizations to align and effectively 
pursue organizational strategies. However, portfolio, program, and project management differ in their focus and in the 
way they contribute to the achievement of strategic goals.
u
u Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives. 
Portfolio management focuses on the establishment and use of good practices when choosing programs or 
projects to sponsor, prioritizing their goals and work, and ensuring that they can be adequately resourced. 
Standards for the practice of portfolio management are described in The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].
u
u Program management is the application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve the program 
objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing program components individually. 
Program management focuses on the coordinated and effective delivery of benefits derived from the pursuit of a 
group of projects and other programs whose outcomes are related.
u
u Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet 
the project requirements. Project management focuses on the efficient delivery of the outputs and outcomes 
required by organizations within defined constraints of time, cost, and specifications. Standards for the practice 
of project management are described in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge [1].
OPM provides a framework in which portfolio, program, and project management practices are integrated to 
achieve strategic objectives. OPM supports the coordinated practice of portfolio, program, and project management by 
linking portfolio, program, and project management principles and practices. OPM is employed to produce improved 
performance, better results, and sustainable strategic benefits for organizations. OPM practices are described in 
Implementing Organizational Project Management: A Practice Guide [3].
Table 1-1 shows comparisons of the scope, focus, and management of portfolios, programs, and projects in the context 
of an organization. The distinctions between project and program management are discussed further in Section 2.5.

A project is a temporary endeavor 
undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result.
Projects have defined objectives.  
Scope is progressively elaborated 
throughout the project life cycle.
Project managers expect change and 
implement processes to keep change 
managed and controlled.
Project managers progressively 
elaborate high-level information into 
detailed plans throughout the project 
life cycle.
Project managers manage the project 
team to meet the project objectives.
Project managers monitor and control 
the work of producing the products, 
services, or results that the project 
was undertaken to produce.
Success is measured by product and 
project quality, timeliness, budget 
compliance, and degree of customer 
satisfaction.
A program is a group of related 
projects, subsidiary programs, and 
program activities that are managed 
in a coordinated manner to obtain 
benefits not available from managing 
them individually.
Programs have a scope that 
encompasses the scopes of its 
program components. Programs 
produce benefits to an organization by 
ensuring that the outputs and 
outcomes of program components are 
delivered in a coordinated and 
complementary manner.
Programs are managed in a manner 
that accepts and adapts to change as 
necessary to optimize the delivery of 
benefits as the program’s components 
deliver outcomes and/or outputs.
Programs are managed using 
high-level plans that track the 
interdependencies and progress of 
program components. Program plans 
are also used to guide planning at the 
component level.
Programs are managed by program 
managers who ensure that program 
benefits are delivered as expected, by 
coordinating the activities of a 
program’s components.
Program managers monitor the 
progress of program components to 
ensure the overall goals, schedules, 
budget, and benefits of the program 
will be met.
A program’s success is measured by 
the program’s ability to deliver its 
intended benefits to an organization, 
and by the program’s efficiency and 
effectiveness in delivering those 
benefits.
A portfolio is a collection of projects, 
programs, subsidiary portfolios, and 
operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives.
Portfolios have an organizational 
scope that changes with the strategic 
objectives of the organization.
Portfolio managers continuously 
monitor changes in the broader 
internal and external environments.
Portfolio managers create and 
maintain necessary processes and 
communication relative to the 
aggregate portfolio.
Portfolio managers may manage or 
coordinate portfolio management 
staff, or program and project staff that 
may have reporting responsibilities 
into the aggregate portfolio.
Portfolio managers monitor strategic 
changes and aggregate resource 
allocation, performance results, and 
risk of the portfolio.
Success is measured in terms of the 
aggregate investment performance 
and benefit realization of the portfolio.

1.4.1 THE INTERACTIONS AMONG PORTFOLIO, PROGRAM, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The distinctions among portfolio, program, and project management can be made clear through their interactions. 
Portfolio managers ensure that programs and projects are selected, prioritized, and staffed according to an organization’s 
strategic plan for realizing desired organizational value. Program managers focus on delivering organizational benefits 
aligned with the organization’s strategic plan through the coordinated management of projects, subsidiary programs, 
and other supportive work. Project managers focus on the generation of the specific outputs and outcomes required by 
an organization, as part of a project, a program, or a portfolio.
1.4.2 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
The relationship between program and portfolio management functions is collaborative. Program and portfolio 
managers work together to ensure that benefits desired or required by an organization are effectively and efficiently 
delivered. Organizational strategies and priorities established as part of portfolio management provide a basis for 
defining programs to be pursued, endorsing program strategies for delivering organizational benefits, and allocating 
the resources that programs require. Program strategies for delivering benefits define the specific means for pursuing 
organizational benefits and for defining the resources required from the organization. Together, the program and portfolio 
management functions support the organization by defining how an organization’s strategic plans will be supported and 
delivered via appropriately prioritized and resourced programs.
1.4.3 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The relationship between program management and project management (as practiced by program and project 
managers) is also collaborative. Program and project managers work together to define viable strategies for pursuing 
program goals and thereby delivering program benefits. Program strategies and high-level program plans defined by 
program managers provide a basis for defining and authorizing projects that will be overseen by project managers. 
Projects managed by project managers deliver outputs and outcomes that provide a basis for reconfirming or adapting 
the strategic direction being pursued by the program and its components. Together, program and project managers 
support the organization by enabling the delivery of benefits that the organization desires or requires.

13
The interactions and relationships between program managers and project managers may change over the program 
life cycle. Projects may be initiated and completed at various times during the course of a program. During the initiation 
and planning stages of a project, it may be necessary for a program manager to work closely with a project manager 
providing oversight, direction, and guidance regarding the needs of the program. However, the relationship between 
program and project managers may be different during the work execution and closing phases of a project. During 
these phases, program managers typically focus more on coordinating interdependencies between the projects that 
contribute to their programs, while project managers focus on managing internal project activities. Program managers 
typically do not directly manage the individual project components on a day-to-day basis. As projects progress, the 
program manager’s interactions with project managers focus more on identifying and controlling the interdependencies 
between projects; monitoring project performance; addressing escalated issues that impact component projects; and 
tracking the contributions of projects, subsidiary programs, and program work to the consolidated program benefits. 
At project closing, program and project managers again work closely to ensure that project outputs and outcomes are 
effectively transitioned to the program so that benefits delivered by a project are assimilated and sustained.
Program and project managers also collaborate in the management of issues and risk. The program manager monitors 
and addresses issues and risks that may impact program performance or benefits delivery and that cannot be addressed 
at the individual project or subsidiary program level. The project manager usually focuses on the management of issues 
and risks encountered within a given project. The project manager identifies issues, risks, and dependencies that (may) 
impact other program components to ensure that they are recognized by program managers.
Program managers also ensure that their programs recognize and embrace new opportunities that arise from the 
pursuit of program components.
The interactions between the program and project management functions tend to be iterative and cyclical:

14	
Section 1
u
u During a program’s definition phase, information about the program’s intended benefits, goals, and strategy flows 
from the program to its component projects; information about the strategies, objectives, needs, constraints, and 
timing of component projects flows back to the program.
u
u During the program’s delivery phase, information about the progress, issues, risks, dependencies, outputs, and 
outcomes of component projects flows from the component project to the program and its other components. 
During this phase, the program management function communicates regularly with the project management 
function to ensure that the activities of all program components are appropriately coordinated and fully aligned 
with the program’s intent to deliver organizational benefits.
u
u During the program’s delivery and closure phases, as component projects are closed, information about project 
outputs and outcomes flows from the component project to the program to ensure that project benefits are fully 
realized and sustained.
The need for an iterative exchange of information and alignment of actions between program and project 
managers requires that the program and project management functions work closely together. A program manager 
may influence a project manager’s approach for managing component projects based on the needs of the program 
and its other components.
1.5 THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY, PROGRAM 
MANAGEMENT, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
Organizations employ program management to pursue complex initiatives that support organizational strategy. In 
practice, when pursuing such initiatives, program managers also find that their programs impact lines of business 
that have operational responsibilities. Moreover, program managers often find that the benefits delivered by programs 
may influence an organization’s approach to or scope of operational activities, and that program deliverables are 
transferred to organizational entities to ensure that their delivery of benefits is sustained. For these reasons, it is 
important that program managers establish collaborative, mutually supportive relationships with those responsible for 
managing operations within an organization. Together, program and operational managers are responsible for ensuring 
the balanced and successful execution of an organization’s strategic objectives.
Organizations address the need for change by creating strategic business initiatives to produce results, or change 
the organization, its products, or its services. Portfolios of programs and projects are the vehicles for delivering these 
initiatives. For more information on the use of programs to produce change, see Managing Change in Organizations: 
A Practice Guide [6].

15
1.6 BUSINESS VALUE
Organizations employ program management to improve their abilities to deliver benefits. In noncommercial 
organizations, benefits may be delivered in the form of social or societal value (for example, improved health, safety, or 
security). In commercial organizations, it is common for organizational benefits to be delivered in the form of business 
value. Business value may be defined as the sum of all tangible and intangible elements of a business where, for example, 
tangible elements include monetary assets, facilities, fixtures, equity, tools, market share, and utility. Intangible elements 
may include goodwill, brand recognition, public benefit, trademarks, compliance, reputation, strategic alignment, 
and capabilities. Business value may also be created through the effective management of ongoing well-established 
operations. However, the effective use of portfolio, program, and project management enables organizations to employ 
reliable, established processes to generate new business value by enabling an organization to effectively pursue new 
business strategies consistent with its mission and vision for the future.
Portfolio management ensures that an organization’s programs, projects, and operations are aligned with an 
organization’s strategy. It allows organizations to define how they will pursue their strategic goals through programs and 
projects, and how those programs and projects will be supported by human, financial, technical, or material resources. 
In so doing, portfolio management optimizes the pursuit of business value.
Program management enables organizations to more effectively pursue their strategic goals through the coordinated 
pursuit of projects, subsidiary programs, and other program-related activities. Program management seeks to optimize 
the management of related component projects and programs to improve the generation of business value.
Project management enables organizations to more efficiently and effectively generate outputs and outcomes 
required for the pursuit of an organization’s objectives by applying knowledge, processes, skills, tools, and techniques 
that enhance the delivery of outputs and outcomes by projects. Project management seeks to optimize the delivery of 
business value by improving the efficiency of organizations as they deliver new products, services, or results.

16	
Section 1
1.7 ROLE OF THE PROGRAM MANAGER
A program manager is the person authorized by the performing organization to lead the team or teams responsible 
for achieving program objectives. The program manager maintains responsibility for the leadership, conduct, and 
performance of a program, and for building a program team that is capable of achieving program objectives and 
delivering anticipated program benefits. The role of the program manager is different from that of the project manager. 
The differences between these roles are based on the fundamental differences between projects and programs and 
between project management and program management as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.4.
In programs, it is recognized that the best means of delivering benefits (via projects, subsidiary programs, and other 
work) may be uncertain. The outcomes or outputs generated by the components of programs may be unpredictable and 
uncontrollable. As a consequence, programs should be managed in a way that recognizes the potential need to adapt 
strategies and plans during the course of a program to optimize the delivery of benefits. A primary role of the program 
manager is to monitor the outputs and outcomes of a program’s component activities and ensure that the program 
adapts appropriately to them. Program managers ensure that program components are adapted as required to meet the 
organization’s strategic objectives.
The program manager is also responsible for managing or coordinating the management of complex issues that may 
arise as programs seek to deliver benefits. Such issues may result from uncertainties related to outcomes, operations, 
organizational strategies, resourcing, the external environment, organizational governance systems, or the expectations 
and motivations of program stakeholders.
The performance domains and supporting program activities described in Sections 3 through 7 discuss the principles, 
practices, and program management skills required for managing uncertainty, navigating complexity, and implementing 
change in the program environment, to optimize the delivery of program benefits. They describe a framework and the 
principles for engaging stakeholders and steering committees, and for managing the progression of a program’s life 
cycle. Section 8 identifies supporting program activities recommended to facilitate the delivery of benefits.

17
In general, program managers are expected to:
u
u Work within the five Program Management Performance Domains.
u
u Interact with project and other program managers to provide support and guidance on individual initiatives 
conducted to support a program.
u
u Interact with portfolio managers to ensure that programs are provided with the appropriate resources and priority.
u
u Collaborate with governance bodies, sponsors and, (where applicable) the program management office to ensure 
the program’s continued alignment with organizational strategy and ongoing organizational support.
u
u Interact with operational managers and stakeholders to ensure that programs receive appropriate operational 
support and that benefits delivered by the program can be effectively sustained.
u
u Ensure that the importance of each of a program’s components is recognized and well understood.
u
u Ensure that the overall program structure and the applied program management processes enable the program 
and its component teams to successfully complete the work and deliver anticipated benefits.
u
u Integrate the program components’ deliverables, outcomes, and benefits into the program’s end product, 
services, or results, such that the program delivers its intended benefits.
u
u Provide effective and appropriate leadership to the program teams.
Program managers work to ensure that projects, other programs, and program activities are organized and executed 
in a consistent manner and fulfilled within established standards.
1.7.1 PROGRAM MANAGER COMPETENCES
To manage a program effectively, program managers need to encourage the efficient completion of project and other 
program activities as planned, while simultaneously enabling the adjustment of the strategy or plans of a program or 
its components whenever it will improve delivery of the program’s intended benefits. Balancing these needs requires 
that program managers be competent in providing an integrated view of how the outputs and outcomes of program 
components will support the program’s intended delivery of organizational benefits.

18	
Section 1
The expertise required of a program manager depends to a large degree on the proficiencies required to manage 
the complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty, and change associated with a program’s outcomes or environment. The skills 
required may differ significantly among programs of different types, or even among programs of similar types facing 
dissimilar challenges. They may, for example, include technical skills specific to the program’s targeted outcomes, 
business skills specific to the program’s environment, or advanced project management skills critical to the management 
of complex operational challenges. The following skills and competences are commonly required by program managers:
u
u Communication skills. Communication skills that enable effective exchange of information with a wide 
variety of program stakeholders, including program team members, sponsors, customers, vendors, and senior 
management, whether individually or in groups or in committees.
u
u Stakeholder engagement skills. Stakeholder engagement skills to support the need to manage the complex 
issues that often arise as a consequence of stakeholder interactions. The program manager should recognize the 
dynamic aspects of managing individual and group expectations.
u
u Change management skills. Skills that enable effective engagement with individual stakeholders and 
governance and review committees, to gain the necessary agreements, alignment, and approvals when 
program strategies or plans need to be adapted. The program manager should provide an integrated view of 
the perspectives of stakeholders and committees whenever a program interacts with multiple committees as 
part of an organization’s program review and approval process.
u
u Leadership skills. Leadership skills to guide program teams through the program life cycle. Program managers 
work with component managers and often with functional managers to gain support, resolve conflicts, and direct 
individual program team members by providing specific work instructions.
u
u Analytical skills. Skills that enable a program manager to assess whether the outputs and outcomes of program 
components will contribute as expected to the delivery of program benefits, or to assess the potential impact of 
external events on the program’s strategy or plans.
u
u Integration skills. A program manager should possess the ability to describe and present a program’s strategic 
vision and plan holistically. It is the program manager’s responsibility to ensure the continuous alignment of the 
program component plans with the program’s goals and pursuit of organizational benefits.

19
Skilled program managers who possess knowledge and experience in the program’s area of focus generally will have 
an advantage over a program manager who lacks business-specific experience. Regardless of background, however, the 
successful program manager uses knowledge, experience, and leadership effectively to align the program’s approach 
with the organization’s strategy, improve the delivery of program benefits, enhance collaboration with stakeholders and 
program steering committees, and manage the program life cycle. In general, this requires the program manager to 
exhibit certain competences, including the abilities to:
u
u Manage details while taking a holistic, benefits-focused view of the program.
u
u Leverage a strong working knowledge of the principles, practices, processes, tools, and techniques of portfolio, 
program, and project management.
u
u Interact seamlessly and collaboratively with program steering committees and other executive stakeholders.
u
u Establish productive and collaborative relationships with team members and their organizational stakeholders.
u
u Leverage business knowledge, skills, and experience to provide perspectives that support the understanding and 
navigation of uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity in the program environment.
u
u Facilitate understanding and agreement through the use of strong communication and negotiation skills.
Demonstrating these abilities within the context of a particular program or organization may present unique 
challenges. A program that is complex because of technical design issues may require a program manager with an 
engineering or technical background; a program that is complex because it involves many hundreds or thousands 
of interconnected activities may require a program manager with extensive background and experience in project 
management. Skilled program managers know their strengths and weaknesses and build a program management team 
that is complementary to their skill set.
Given the often complex and dynamic nature of programs, it is understandable that program managers may enter 
the field from the project management field or from a technical discipline closely related to their programs. Regardless 
of their path of entry to the field, program managers commonly seek specific development and training opportunities 
related to the key competences associated with the program manager role, such as PMI’s Program Management 
Professional (PgMP)® credential program, or through post-graduate academic study.
For additional information regarding program management competences, refer to the Project Manager Competency 
Development Framework – Third Edition.

20	
Section 1
1.8 ROLE OF THE PROGRAM SPONSOR
A program sponsor is an individual or a group that provides resources and support for the program and is accountable 
for enabling success. A program steering committee may assume the role of a program sponsor. However, the program 
sponsor is usually an individual executive who is committed to ensuring that the program is appropriately supported 
and able to deliver its intended benefits. In this capacity, the sponsor may support and assist the program manager in 
stakeholder engagement. The program sponsor also provides valuable guidance and support to the program manager, 
ensuring that the program receives appropriate high-level attention and consideration, and that the program manager 
is informed of organizational changes that may affect the program. The governance and management-focused roles of 
the program sponsor are discussed in more detail in Sections 5.1 and 6.2.1, respectively.
1.9 ROLE OF THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OFFICE
A program management office is a management structure that standardizes the program-related governance 
processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. A program management office 
often also supports training and other organizational change management activities. Program management offices may 
be established within an individual program to provide support specific to that program, or independent of an individual 
program to provide support to one or more of an organization’s programs (for more detail, see Sections 5.1 and 6.2.3). 
When established as part of a program, a program management office is an important element of the program’s 
infrastructure and an aid to the program manager. It may support the program manager with the management of 
multiple projects and program activities, for example, by:
u
u Defining standard program management processes and procedures that will be followed;
u
u Providing training to ensure that standards and practices are well understood;
u
u Supporting program communications;
u
u Supporting program level change management activities;
u
u Conducting program performance analyses;
u
u Supporting management of the program schedule and budget;
u
u Defining general quality standards for the program and its components;
u
u Supporting effective resource management;
u
u Providing support for reporting to leadership and program steering committees;
u
u Supporting document and knowledge transfer; and
u
u Providing centralized support for managing changes and tracking risks, issues, and decisions.

21
In addition, for large or complex programs, the program management office may provide additional management 
support for personnel and other resources, contracts and procurements, and legal or legislative issues.
Some programs continue for years and assume many aspects of normal operations that overlap with the larger 
organization’s operational management. The program management office may take on some of these responsibilities. 
The specific governance and management-focused roles of the program management office are described further in 
Sections 6 and 8.
Some organizations elect not to have formally defined program management offices. In those instances, the managing 
function of the program management office is generally assumed by the assigned program manager.

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAINS
Program Management Performance Domains are complementary groupings of related areas of activity or function 
that uniquely characterize and differentiate the activities found in one performance domain from the others within the 
full scope of program management work.
This section includes:
2.1	 Program Management Performance Domain Definitions
2.2	 Program Management Performance Domain Interactions
2.3	 Organizational Strategy, Portfolio Management, and Program Management Linkage
2.4	 Portfolio and Program Distinctions
2.5	 Program and Project Distinctions
Program managers actively carry out work within multiple Program Management Performance Domains during all 
program management phases.
The Program Management Performance Domains are shown in Figure 2-1: Program Strategy Alignment, Program 
Benefits Management, Program Stakeholder Engagement, Program Governance, and Program Life Cycle Management.

24	
Section 2
Figure 2-1. Program Management Performance Domains
2.1 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN DEFINITIONS
Organizations initiate programs to deliver benefits and accomplish agreed-upon objectives that often affect the 
entire organization. The organization implementing the program considers and balances the degree of needs, change, 
stakeholder expectations, requirements, resources, and timing conflicts across the components. Programs introduce 
change throughout their duration. This change may be reflected with the introduction of a new product, service, or 
organizational capability. Changes may be introduced to a variety of business processes (for example, the processes 
required to provide a new or improved service) through the actions, guidance, and leadership of the program manager 
working within the five Program Management Performance Domains. Together, these performance domains are critical 
to the success of the program. Definitions of the Program Management Performance Domains are as follows:
Program
Strategy
Alignment
Program
Life Cycle
Management
Program
Stakeholder
Engagement
Program
Benefits
Management
Program
Governance

25
u
u Program Strategy Alignment—Performance domain that identifies program outputs and outcomes to provide 
benefits aligned with the organization’s goals and objectives.
u
u Program Benefits Management—Performance domain that defines, creates, maximizes, and delivers the 
benefits provided by the program.
u
u Program Stakeholder Engagement—Performance domain that identifies and analyzes stakeholder needs and 
manages expectations and communications to foster stakeholder support.
u
u Program Governance—Performance domain that enables and performs program decision making, establishes 
practices to support the program, and maintains program oversight.
u
u Program Life Cycle Management—Performance domain that manages program activities required to facilitate 
effective program definition, program delivery, and program closure.
These domains run concurrently throughout the duration of the program. It is within these domains that the 
program manager and the program team perform their activities. The nature and the complexity of the program being 
implemented determine the degree of activity required within a particular domain at any particular point in time. Every 
program requires some activity in each of these performance domains during the entire course of the program. Work 
within these domains is iterative in nature and is repeated frequently. Each domain is described in detail in its respective 
section within this standard.
2.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN INTERACTIONS
As introduced previously and depicted in Figure 2-1, all five Program Management Performance Domains interact 
with each other throughout the course of the program. How much interaction there will be and when it should occur 
will depend upon the program and its components. The amount of interaction for any given program is as varied as the 
number of programs that exist. When organizations pursue similar programs, the interactions among the performance 
domains are similar and often repetitive. All five domains interact with each other with varying degrees of intensity. 
These domains are the areas in which program managers will spend their time while implementing the program. The 
five domains reflect the higher-level business functions that are essential aspects of the program manager’s role 
regardless of the size of the organization, industry or business focus, and/or geographic location.

26	
Section 2
2.3 ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, 
AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT LINKAGE
Programs typically find their starting point during an organization’s strategic planning effort, where the full spectrum 
of the organization’s investments are evaluated, prioritized, and aligned with the organization’s operational strategy. 
As the business climate or organizational strategy changes, organizations continue to evaluate work through portfolio 
reviews, by reinforcing components of the portfolio that are in alignment and are achieving intended benefits and 
organizational objectives, and closing initiatives that are not aligned with organizational objectives. New initiatives 
that have the potential for contributing to the overall forward progress and success of the organization are proposed 
and analyzed during the portfolio review process and create the starting point for new projects, portfolio components, 
and programs.
During an organization’s portfolio review process, programs are evaluated to ensure that they continue to support 
an organization’s strategy and objectives and that they are performing as expected. Programs are typically reviewed 
to ensure the program’s business case, charter, and benefits management plan reflect the current and most suitable 
profile of the intended outcomes. A concept may be approved for a limited time with limited funding to develop a 
business case for further evaluation. The business case is then reviewed during the portfolio review process. This occurs 
during the program formulation subphase of the program life cycle. When the actual program is approved, funding is 
formally approved and allocated, and a program manager is assigned to the initiative. During the program delivery 
phase, program components are initiated, planned, executed, transitioned, and closed, while benefits are delivered, 
transitioned, and sustained. During this phase, individual projects and subsidiary programs within the program may 
begin and end as the program continues during the delivery of benefits. The program is closed when the desired 
benefits are achieved or when reasons for closure arise. Programs may close when the benefits and objectives to be 
achieved by the program are no longer in alignment with the organization’s strategy or when measurements against the 
program’s key performance indicators reveal that the business case for the program is no longer viable.
2.4 PORTFOLIO AND PROGRAM DISTINCTIONS
While portfolios and programs are both collections of projects, activities, and non-project work, there are aspects 
that clearly differentiate them and help clarify the differences between the two. As defined in Section 1, a program is a 
group of related projects, other programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not 
available from managing them individually. To clarify the difference between these important organizational constructs, 
two aspects stand out: relatedness and time.

27
u
u Relatedness. A primary consideration that differentiates programs and portfolios is the concept introduced and 
implied by the word “related” in the definition of program. In a program, the work included is interdependent 
such that achieving the full intended benefits is dependent on the delivery of all components in the scope 
of the program. In a portfolio, the work included is related in any way the portfolio owner chooses. Typical 
portfolio groupings of work include efforts staffed from the same resource pool, work delivered to the same 
client, or work conducted in the same accounting period. Other groupings are also valid, for example, work 
performed within the same geographical area or strategic business unit. Work included in the portfolio may 
span a variety of diverse initiatives, and these initiatives can be independent. Though the initiatives may be 
entirely independent and not related to one another in any way, the organization may group and manage them 
together for ease of oversight and control.
u
u Time. Another attribute that differentiates portfolios from programs is the element of time. Programs, like 
projects, are temporary and include the concept of time as an aspect of the work. Though they may span multiple 
years or decades, programs are characterized by the existence of a clearly defined beginning, a future endpoint, 
and a set of outcomes and planned benefits that are to be achieved during the conduct of the program. Portfolios, 
on the other hand, while being reviewed on a regular basis for decision-making purposes, are not expected to 
be constrained to end on a specific date. The various initiatives and work elements defined within portfolios 
mostly do not directly relate to one another and do not rely on each other to achieve benefits. In portfolios, 
the organization’s strategic plan and business cycle dictate the start or end of specific investments, and these 
investments may serve widely divergent objectives. Additionally, work and investments within the portfolio may 
continue for years or decades, or may be altered or terminated by the organization as the business environment 
changes. Finally, portfolios contain proposals for various initiatives, including programs and projects that should 
be evaluated and aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives before they are approved. A proposal may 
exist in the organization’s portfolio for an indeterminate length of time.
To summarize, programs differ from portfolios in two important ways. Programs include work (projects, subsidiary 
programs, and program activities) that are related in some way and collectively contribute to the achievement of the 
program’s outcomes and intended benefits. Programs also include the concept of time and incorporate schedules 
through which specific milestone achievements are measured. Portfolios do not require the work within the portfolio to 
be related and are managed in an ongoing fashion as initiatives (programs and projects) are introduced to the portfolio 
and are subsequently completed. Portfolios provide a means for organizations to effectively manage a collection of 
investments and work that is important to the achievement of the organization’s strategic objectives.

28	
Section 2
2.5 PROGRAM AND PROJECT DISTINCTIONS
As described in Section 1, program management provides organizations with an effective framework for managing 
interrelated groupings of work (i.e., projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities) designed to produce benefits 
not achievable by managing the work as individual initiatives. Programs are often large, complex, lengthy, and accept 
uncertainty in their definition. This section further discusses three characteristics that distinguish programs from 
projects. These fundamental differences are found in the way programs and projects are managed in response to 
uncertainty, change, and complexity.
2.5.1 UNCERTAINTY
Uncertainty is an inevitable challenge of managing programs. Uncertainty is especially high in the beginning of a 
program as the outcomes are not clear. Programs and projects both exist in organizational environments in which 
the output, benefits, or outcome of the work may be somewhat unpredictable or uncertain. Changes external to the 
organizational environment also create uncertainty, which increases the uncertainty of managing programs. Within the 
context of the organization, however, individual projects may be considered to be more certain than programs.
The expected outputs of projects are generally more certain than those of programs at the time of their inception. 
This can be attributed to the project’s fixed constraints. As a project proceeds, its ability to deliver those outputs on 
time, on budget, and according to specification becomes more certain as a result of the progressive elaboration that 
removes uncertainty during the course of the project. By contrast, a program may not have its entire scope, budget, or 
timeline determined upon preparation. This in turn can be addressed by the program’s ability to deal with uncertainty 
because programs can change the direction of projects, cancel projects, or start new projects to adapt to changing 
circumstances. This ability creates uncertainty about the program’s direction and outcome. During the program, scope 
and content are continually elaborated, clarified, and adjusted to ensure the program’s outcomes remain in alignment 
with the intended benefits. This results in an initial program environment that is recognized to be uncertain, and implies 
the need for a management style that embraces uncertainty in order to address it more effectively. The program may 
include individual components that meet or fulfill all their success criteria: providing outputs, products, or services 
precisely as planned. However, in the context of the program’s outcomes and intended benefits, these individual 
components may not contribute at all to the outcomes that were anticipated. This creates additional uncertainty about 
the outcomes the program may achieve.

29
With the focus on benefits realization and the multiple components that work together to produce the intended 
outcomes, the complexity and duration of the program demand that the program manager take a broad, collective view 
of all the program’s components to thoroughly understand and successfully manage the progress and contributions 
of the component parts. This distinguishes and differentiates the program management and project management 
approaches, and explains the need for both within a program.
2.5.2 MANAGING CHANGE
Program managers need to consider two different categories of change. These will be referred to as internal change 
and external change. Internal change refers to changes within the program. External change refers to the need to adapt 
the organization in order for it to be able to exploit the benefits created by the program.
Issues related to change should be addressed differently within programs and projects. Projects deal with change in 
terms of scope, time, cost, and quality. As with uncertainty, programs should be better equipped to deal with change 
because they have the ability to change the direction of a component, cancel a component, or start a new component. 
In both programs and projects, there should be a rationale that justifies that the advantages originating from a proposed 
change will outweigh potential drawbacks. Change within a project affects the defined deliverables at the tactical level, 
whereas change within a program affects the delivery of the intended benefits at the strategic level. Managing change 
within a program requires strategic insight and understanding of the program’s objectives and intended benefits. Change 
to any component within a program may have a direct impact on the delivery of the other related components, which 
necessitates a change in those specific components. Change of a project is generally local to the project and related to 
the tactical level.
In programs, change management is a key activity, enabling stakeholders to carefully analyze the need for proposed 
change, the impact of change, and the approach or process for implementing and communicating change. The 
change management plan, which is part of the program management plan and developed during program preparation, 
establishes the change management authorities.

Section 2
u
u Program change. Program managers approach change at the program level in a fundamentally different way. 
Program managers depend on a predetermined, consistent level of performance from the components of the 
program. For components that are projects, program managers rightfully expect the projects to be delivered on 
time, on budget, within scope, and with an acceptable level of quality. For other programs and program activities, 
the program manager should require that each be performed in a manner that will contribute positively to the 
program’s outcome and anticipated benefits or reduce the negative outcome. For program components, just 
as in projects, change management is employed to understand and control the variability of each component’s 
schedule, cost, and output. In addition, program managers can create new components or cancel existing 
components. This change is made to ensure the optimal delivery of benefits.
u
u Project change. In projects, change management is employed to help the project manager, team, and stakeholders 
monitor and control the amount of variance from the planned cost and schedule while protecting the approved 
attributes and characteristics of the planned output. If a change is required that impacts the scope (including 
deliverables), cost, schedule, quality, or expected results, then a project change request is developed to modify 
the scope, schedule, cost, or intended output (deliverable) of the project. If accepted, the change is incorporated 
into the structure of the project, and the cost, schedule, and attributes are adjusted to accommodate all aspects 
of the change. The project is then replanned and the updated cost, schedule, and deliverable specifications 
become the new baseline for the project. Once the project change request is completed and accepted, change 
management is employed to ensure the project remains aligned with the new baseline(s). Projects also use 
change management to manage the impact of variance caused by known risks that were triggered (expected 
events) and unknown risks that were triggered (unexpected events) on its path to a project’s completion.
Given the consistent delivery of the program’s components, the program manager addresses the uncertainty of 
the overall program’s outcomes and anticipates that it is possible that some of the program’s components will be 
successfully delivered, but will produce entirely unexpected results—results that may or may not contribute positively 
to the intended benefits of the program. In order to address the program’s inherent uncertainty, the program manager 
may group individual components into other programs to manage them more effectively. In addition, the program 
manager may redirect, replan, or stop individual efforts entirely, knowing they will not help achieve the desired program 
benefits if left unattended in the context of the evolving environment. When this occurs, the program manager employs 
change management at the program level to redirect and modify the roadmap of the program to ensure it aligns with 
the expected benefits to be delivered, the new strategy, the social, regulatory or economic state, or the perceptions of 
the program’s beneficiaries.

31
Programs use change management in a forward-looking, proactive manner to adapt to the evolving environment. 
This is an iterative process repeated frequently during the performance of a program to ensure the program delivers the 
benefits planned at the start of the program.
To summarize, projects employ change and change management to constrain or control the impact of variability on 
their baselines, while programs proactively use change management to keep the program components and intended 
benefits aligned with changes in organizational strategy and changes in the environment in which they are performed.
2.5.3 COMPLEXITY
Both programs and projects are associated with complexity. The sources of complexity within programs and projects 
can be grouped into human behavior, system behavior, and ambiguity (See Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide). 
The factors that result in program and project complexity originate from these three groupings.
u
u Program complexity. The complexity of a program may be the result from a combination of factors.
n
n Governance complexity. Governance complexity results from the sponsor support for the program as well as 
the support of the related components’ sponsors, management structures, number of organizations involved 
and the decision-making processes within the program.
n
n Stakeholder complexity. Stakeholder complexity arises from the differences in the needs and influence 
of stakeholders, which may be a burden to the program or in conflict with the benefits of the program. 
Stakeholder complexity also focuses on the program team itself and the diversity within the program team. 
Stakeholder complexity is also associated with the number of stakeholders interested in the program.
n
n Definition complexity. Programs bring about change, and definition complexity focuses on the agreement of 
the future state by stakeholders. Other aspects that the program manager should be cognizant of include 
benefits management and the potential competing interests of stakeholders.
n
n Benefits delivery complexity. Benefits delivery complexity focuses on benefits management, as discussed 
in Section 4.
n
n Interdependency complexity. Program managers need to deal with interdependency complexity. A program 
focuses on the interdependencies among components and not necessarily on issues within individual 
projects. Programs strengthen and enforce interdependencies among components to ensure that the overall 
outcome of the program delivers the intended benefits. Interdependencies among components and other 
business entities should be clearly defined. Program managers focus on interdependencies that occur 
within the program and its related projects. Interdependencies can also occur outside the program when 
there are dependencies on other projects or programs as well as dependencies external to the organization. 
Interdependencies are directly related to the complexity of the program.

32	
Section 2
n
n Resource complexity. The availability of resources at the required level of capability and capacity, adequate 
funding, and suitable supplies and materials add to the complexity of the program, and these resource 
concerns need to be addressed within the program.
n
n Scope complexity. Scope complexity arises from the difficulty to clearly define the deliverables and benefits 
of a program and its components. Managing the delivery of the associated benefits beyond the lifespan of the 
program’s components contributes to scope complexity.
n
n Change complexity. Change complexity arises from the different levels of impact the change potentially can 
cause in an organization. Change complexity is low when a program changes the basic operational processes 
model in one or two departments, but can be can be extremely complex when a program transforms an 
organization from a functional to a projectized organization.
n
n Risk complexity. Risk complexity arises from the high level of uncertainty due to the extended program life 
cycle and the uncertainty of the components’ outcome and their interdependencies.
u
u Project complexity. A project can be complex because of the uniqueness it presents as well as the kind of 
thinking, action, and knowledge needed in order to solve a problem or complete a task. This uniqueness creates 
uncertainty with regard to time and costing estimates, as well as the specifications needed to deliver the desired 
project output and outcomes. Project complexity can be characterized as organizational or dynamic complexity.
n
n Organizational complexity. Organizational complexity focuses on the depth of the organizational structure 
as well as the number of organizational units. It also addresses the number and types of elements and their 
relationships in the organization.
n
n Dynamic complexity. Dynamic complexity focuses on the project’s behavior and how it changes over time.

PROGRAM STRATEGY ALIGNMENT
Program Strategy Alignment is the performance domain that identifies program outputs and outcomes to provide 
benefits aligned with the organization’s strategic goals and objectives.
This section includes:
3.1	 Program Business Case
3.2	 Program Charter
3.3	 Program Roadmap
3.4	 Environmental Assessments
3.5	 Program Risk Management Strategy
Programs are designed to align with the organizational strategy and to facilitate the realization of organizational 
benefits. To accomplish this, program managers need to have a thorough understanding of how the program will fulfill 
the portfolio and organization’s strategy, goals and objectives, and the skills needed to align the program with the long-
term goals of the organization.
When an organization develops its strategy, there is typically an initial evaluation and selection process that may be 
formal or informal to help the organization determine which initiatives to approve, deny, or defer as part of the portfolio 
management practice of the organization.
The more mature an organization is in terms of program and project management, the more likely it will have a 
formalized process for program selection such as a portfolio review board or a program steering committee. Either 
decision-making body may issue a program charter that defines the strategic objectives and benefits a particular 
program is expected to deliver. The program charter is a document issued by a sponsor that authorizes the program 
management team to use organizational resources to execute the program and links the program to the organization’s 
strategic objectives. It defines the scope and purpose of a proposed program presented to governance to obtain approval, 
funding, and authorization. This program charter confirms the commitment of organizational resources to determine if 
a program is the most appropriate approach for achieving these objectives and triggers the program definition phase.

34	
Section 3
While project managers lead and direct the work on their projects, it is the program manager’s responsibility to 
ensure alignment of individual project management plans with the program’s goals and intended benefits to support the 
achievement of the organization’s strategic goals and objectives.
Figure 3-1 depicts the components of Program Strategy Alignment.
Figure 3-1. Elements of Program Strategy Alignment
Program Strategy Alignment is initiated with the development of a program business case. A program business 
case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish validity of the benefits to be delivered by a program; 
it justifies the need for a program by defining how a program’s expected outcomes would support the organization’s 
strategic goals and objectives. As the documented economic feasibility study is used to establish validity of the 
benefits to be delivered by a program, the business case is then further used as an input to the program charter and 
subsequently the program roadmap. These three documents are established as part of program formulation activities 
(see Section 7.1.2.1).
During the execution of the program formulation subphase, the program strategy alignment process is initiated and runs 
until the end of the program life cycle. During this time, the management processes to identify and quantify environmental 
factors, outcomes, and benefits and to identify and manage program risks are executed and controlled within the program 
governance framework. When misalignment is identified, the program management plan or organization’s strategic goals 
and objectives should be revised to ensure alignment. This may occur in research, where the results of a program 
determine that a given line of research is not likely to succeed, and the organization then changes its strategy—sometimes 
without canceling or discontinuing the program—to better leverage the results of the program.

3.1 PROGRAM BUSINESS CASE
Organizations build strategy to define how their vision will be achieved. The completion of the strategic planning 
cycle results in the creation or update of the organization’s strategic goals and objectives which is documented in the 
organization’s strategic plan. The organization’s vision and mission are used as input to the strategic planning cycle and 
are reflected throughout the strategic plan. The organization’s strategic plan is subdivided into a set of organizational 
initiatives that are influenced in part by market dynamics, customer and partner requests, shareholders, government 
regulations, organization’s strengths and weaknesses, risk exposure, and competitor plans and actions. These initiatives 
may be grouped into portfolios to be executed during a predetermined period.
Programs are formally evaluated, selected, and authorized based on their alignment and support to achieve the 
organization’s strategic plan, usually as part of the organization’s governance practices. To facilitate alignment and 
goal setting, the organization’s strategic plan is further delineated as a set of goals and objectives that may have 
measurable elements such as products, deliverables, benefits, cost, and timing, among others. The goal of linking the 
program to the organization’s strategic plan is to plan and manage a program that will help the organization achieve its 
strategic goals and objectives and to balance its use of resources while maximizing value. This is achieved through the 
business case. During program definition, the program manager collaborates with key sponsors and stakeholders to 
develop the program’s business case. This business case is developed to assess the program’s investment against the 
intended benefits. The business case can be basic and high-level or detailed and comprehensive. It usually describes 
key parameters that can be used to assess the objectives and constraints for the intended program.
The business case may include details about the program outcomes, approved concept, issues, high-level risk 
and opportunity assessment, key assumptions, business and operational impact, cost benefit analysis, alternative 
solutions, financial analysis, intrinsic and extrinsic benefits, market demands or barriers, potential profits, social needs, 
environmental influences, legal implications, time to market, constraints, and the extent to which the program aligns 
with the organization’s strategic plan. The business case describes the intent and authority behind the drivers of the 
program and underlying philosophy of the business need. The business case also serves as a formal declaration of the 
value that the program is expected to deliver and a justification for the resources that will be expended to deliver it.
The business case is required as one of the document deliverables before the program can be formally chartered 
and may be considered as the primary justification document for an investment decision. Also, the business case 
describes success criteria that is maintained throughout the program. The variance between the achieved and the 
planned outcomes is calculated to measure the success of the program.

36	
Section 3
3.2 PROGRAM CHARTER
Following the approval of the business case, the program steering committee (see Section 5.1) authorizes the program 
by means of the program charter. Derived from the business case, the program charter is a document that assigns and 
authorizes a program manager and defines the scope and purpose of a proposed program presented to governance to 
obtain approval, funding, and authorization.
Key elements of a program charter consist of the program scope, assumptions, constraints, high-level risks, high-
level benefits, goals and objectives, success factors, timing, key stakeholders, and other provisions that tie the program 
to the business case, thereby enabling program strategy alignment. (See Section 7.1.2.1 for more information on the 
contents of a program charter.)
The program charter formally expresses the organization’s vision, mission, and benefits expected to be produced by 
the program; it also defines program-specific goals and objectives in alignment with the organization’s strategic plan 
in support of the business case. The program charter also provides the program manager with the authority for leading 
other subsidiary programs, projects, and related activities to be initiated, in addition to the framework by which these 
program components will be managed and monitored during the course of the program. The program charter is one 
of the document deliverables that will be used to measure program success. It should include the metrics for success, 
a method for measurement, and a clear definition of success.
3.3 PROGRAM ROADMAP
While planning the program, the program manager analyzes available information about the organization’s strategic 
goals and objectives, internal and external influences, program drivers, and the benefits that stakeholders expect 
the program to realize. The program is defined in terms of expected outcomes, required resources, and strategy for 
delivering the needed changes to implement new capabilities across the organization.
The program roadmap (see Figure 3-2) is a chronological representation of a program’s intended direction, graphically 
depicting dependencies between major milestones and decision points, which reflects the linkage between the business 
strategy and the program work.

37
While elements of a program roadmap are similar to a project schedule, the roadmap instead outlines major program 
events for the purposes of planning and the development of more detailed schedules. The program roadmap also 
reflects the pace at which benefits are realized and serves as a basis for transition and integration of new capabilities.
Figure 3-2. Program Roadmap Example
The program roadmap can be a valuable tool for managing the organization of a program and for assessing a 
program’s progress toward achieving its expected benefits. To better enable effective governance of the program, 
the program roadmap can be used to show how benefits are delivered within major stages or milestones; however, it 
may include the component details, their durations, and contributions to benefits. In a large construction program, for 
example, the roadmap may present stages of construction toward the final benefits of the construction. In a system 
development and production program, the program roadmap may depict how benefits such as system capabilities will 
be delivered through incremental releases or a series of models. A roadmap is an effective way to communicate the 
overarching plan and benefits to stakeholders to build and maintain advocacy.

Section 3
3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS
There are often internal or external influences to the program that have a significant impact on a program’s success. 
Influences from outside the program may be internal to the larger organization, or may come from sources external to 
the organization. Program managers should identify these influences and take them into account when managing the 
program in order to ensure ongoing stakeholder alignment, the program’s continued alignment with the organization’s 
strategic goals and objectives, and overall program success.
3.4.1 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Enterprise environmental factors external to the program may influence the selection, design, funding, and 
management of a program. Enterprise environmental factors refer to conditions, not under the immediate control of 
the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the program. A program should be selected and prioritized according to 
how well it supports the organization’s strategic goals and objectives. Strategic goals change, however, in response 
to environmental factors. When this occurs, a change in the direction of the organization may cause the program to be 
misaligned with the organization’s revised strategic plan. In this case, the program may be changed, put on hold, or 
canceled regardless of how well it was performing.
Environmental factors may include but are not limited to:
u
u Business environment;
u
u Market;
u
u Funding;
u
u Resources;
u
u Industry;
u
u Health, safety, and environment;
u
u Economy;
u
u Cultural diversity;
u
u Geographic diversity;
u
u Regulatory;
u
u Legislative;
u
u Growth;
u
u Supply base;
u
u Technology;
u
u Political influence;

39
u
u Audit;
u
u New business processes, standards, and practices; and
u
u Discoveries and inventions.
Consideration of these factors and their associated uncertainty or change helps the ongoing assessment and evolution 
of an organization and the alignment of its programs with its goals. The ongoing management of a program should 
include continual monitoring of the environmental factors to ensure the program remains aligned with the organization’s 
strategic objectives.
3.4.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
The following sections outline various forms of analysis that may be used to assess the validity of a program’s 
business case and program management plan. Consideration of the results from one or more environmental analyses 
enables the program manager to highlight factors that have potential for impacting the program and informs risk 
management. Sections 3.4.2.1 through 3.4.2.5 are provided as representative samples of environmental analyses 
that may be performed or commissioned by the program manager. The activities included are not intended to be 
comprehensive or all-inclusive.
3.4.2.1 COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE ANALYSIS
When conducting environmental analysis for a strategic initiative and/or business case, it is important to consider 
that competing efforts may reside within or external to the organization. A typical business case includes analysis and 
comparison against real or hypothetical alternative scenarios. Where appropriate, comparative advantage analysis may 
also include what-if analyses to illustrate how the program’s objectives and intended benefits could be achieved by 
other means.

40	
Section 3
3.4.2.2 FEASIBILITY STUDIES
Using the business case, organizational goals, and other existing initiatives as a base, this process assesses the 
feasibility of the program within the organization’s financial, sourcing, complexity, and constraint profile. This analysis 
contributes to the body of information that decision makers require to approve or deny the program proposal.
3.4.2.3 SWOT ANALYSIS
An analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) faced by a program provides information 
for optimizing the program charter and program management plan. The SWOT analysis, in particular the analysis of 
weaknesses and threats, may be a valuable input to the development of the program risk management strategy. SWOT 
analysis may also form part of the feasibility study as well as the business case.
3.4.2.4 ASSUMPTIONS ANALYSIS
Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, are considered true, real, or certain. Identified initially during 
business case development, assumptions affect all aspects of the program and are part of the progressive elaboration 
of the program. Program managers regularly identify and document assumptions as part of their planning process. In 
addition, assumptions should be validated during the course of the program to ensure that the assumptions have not 
been invalidated by events or other program activities.
3.4.2.5 HISTORICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS
Previously completed programs and completed phases of active programs may be a source of lessons learned 
and best practices for new programs (refer to Section 8.2.4.1.). Historical information includes artifacts, metrics, 
risks, and estimations from previous programs, projects, and ongoing operations that may be relevant to the current 
program. Historical information describing the successes, failures, and lessons learned is particularly important 
during program definition.

41
3.5 PROGRAM RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Successful delivery of the program roadmap, aligned with organizational strategy, and with consideration to the 
environmental factors found in the environmental assessments, depends on a well-defined program risk strategy.
While Section 8 details the program risk management activities, this section addresses the specific program risk 
management strategy that drives the program risk management activities (actively identifying, monitoring, analyzing, 
accepting, mitigating, avoiding, or retiring program risk) to ensure the program is aligned with organizational strategy.
3.5.1 RISK MANAGEMENT FOR STRATEGY ALIGNMENT
Strategy alignment comprises the alignment of the program roadmap and its supported objectives to organizational 
strategy. This involves having a risk management strategy that ensures effective management of any risk that can 
cause the program to be out of alignment with organizational strategy. Such a risk management strategy includes 
defining program risk thresholds, performing the initial program risk assessment, and developing a high-level program 
risk response strategy, as well as determining how risks will be communicated to strategic levels of the organization. 
Strategy alignment requires program risk thresholds to take into account the organization’s strategy including its risk 
appetite, which is an assessment of the organization’s willingness to accept and deal with risks (see Section 8.1.1.7).
3.5.2 PROGRAM RISK THRESHOLDS
Risk threshold is the measure of the degree of acceptable variation around a program objective that reflects the risk 
appetite of the organization and program stakeholders.
As previously mentioned, a key element of program risk strategy is the establishment and monitoring of program risk 
thresholds. Examples of program risk thresholds include:
u
u Minimum level of risk exposure for a risk to be included in the risk register,
u
u Qualitative (high, medium, low, etc.) or quantitative (numerical) definitions of risk rating, and
u
u Maximum level of risk exposure that can be managed within the program (beyond which an escalation 
is triggered).
Establishing program risk thresholds is an integral step in linking program risk management to strategy alignment and 
therefore should be done as part of early planning. Based on the risk appetite of the organization, program governance, 
working in collaboration with corporate governance and the program management team may also be responsible for 
ensuring that program risk thresholds are established and observed in the program (see Section 6.1.6).

42	
Section 3
3.5.3 INITIAL PROGRAM RISK ASSESSMENT
While program risk management is conducted throughout the life of the program, the initial program risk assessment, 
prepared during program definition, offers a unique opportunity to identify risks to organizational strategy alignment. It 
enables risk to be considered when developing the program roadmap and when examining environmental factors. As 
such, it is critical that the initial program risk assessment identifies any risk to strategy alignment, which includes but 
is not limited to any uncertain events or conditions that, if they occur, could lead to:
u
u Program objectives not supportive of organizational objectives,
u
u Program roadmap not aligned with organizational roadmap,
u
u Program roadmap not supportive of portfolio roadmaps,
u
u Program objective not supportive of portfolio objectives, and
u
u Program resource requirements out of sync with organizational capacity and capability.
Once the initial program risk assessment is performed, a risk response strategy is developed to complete the program 
risk management strategy.
3.5.4 PROGRAM RISK RESPONSE STRATEGY
Program risk response strategy combines the elements of the risk thresholds and the initial risk assessment into a 
plan for how program risks will be managed effectively and consistently throughout the life of the program. For each 
identified risk, the risk thresholds can be used to identify the specific response strategy based on a number of rating 
criteria. As an example, for an organization that views 5 % schedule variance as acceptable:
u
u Risk threshold—5% schedule delay,
u
u Risk rating—no significant risk, and
u
u Response strategy—accept.
A robust program risk management strategy comprises a specific risk response strategy for each of the risk rating 
levels that have been developed to reflect the program’s risk thresholds.
Once established, the program risk management strategy drives consistency and effectiveness in program risk 
management activities throughout the program as part of program integration (Section 7.2.2) and supporting activities 
(Section 8). In addition, the established program risk management strategy enables the program to communicate and 
manage program risks consistently throughout the course of the program performance as part of governance (see 
Section 6.1.6).
Program Strategy Alignment, therefore, is a program performance domain that is initiated during the program 
definition phase with the development of the business case, program charter, and program roadmap, supported with 
inputs from environmental assessments and program risk management strategy. This upstream effort results in the 
development of a program management plan that is aligned with organizational goals and objectives.

43
4
PROGRAM BENEFITS MANAGEMENT
Program Benefits Management is the performance domain that defines, creates, maximizes, and delivers the benefits 
provided by the program.
This section includes:
4.1	 Benefits Identification
4.2	 Benefits Analysis and Planning
4.3	 Benefits Delivery
4.4	 Benefits Transition
4.5	 Benefits Sustainment
Program Benefits Management comprises a number of elements that are central to program success. Program 
Benefits Management includes processes to clarify the program’s planned benefits and intended outcomes and includes 
processes for monitoring the program’s ability to deliver against these benefits and outcomes.
The purpose of Program Benefits Management is to focus program stakeholders (program sponsors, program 
manager, project managers, program team, program steering committee, and others) on the outcomes and benefits 
to be provided by the various activities conducted during the program’s duration. To do this, the program manager 
employs Program Benefits Management in order to continually:
u
u Identify and assess the value and impact of program benefits,
u
u Monitor the interdependencies among the outputs being delivered by the various components within the program 
and how those outputs contribute overall to the program’s benefits,
u
u Analyze the potential impact of planned program changes on the expected benefits and outcomes,
u
u Align the expected benefits with the organization’s goals and objectives, and
u
u Assign responsibility and accountability for the realization of benefits provided by the program and ensure that 
the benefits can be sustained.

44	
Section 4
A benefit is the gains and assets realized by the organization and other stakeholders as the result of outcomes 
delivered by the program. Some benefits are relatively certain, easily quantifiable, and may include concrete or finite 
conditions, such as the achievement of an organization’s financial objectives (e.g., a 20 % increase in revenue or gross 
margin) or the creation of a physical product or service for consumption or utility. Other benefits may be less easily 
quantifiable and may produce somewhat uncertain outcomes. Examples of less certain program outcomes may include 
an improvement in employee morale or customer satisfaction or may include a benefit such as the reduced incidence 
of a health condition or disease.
Various types of benefits may be defined and generated by programs. Some benefits, such as expanded market 
presence, improved financial performance, or operational efficiencies, may be realized by the sponsoring organization 
while other program outcomes may be realized as benefits by the organization’s customers or the program’s intended 
beneficiaries. Regulatory changes may require the initiation of a program. The realized benefits from regulatory 
compliance programs may be harder to identify. These benefits may be limited to compliance, avoidance of fines, and 
avoidance of adverse publicity.
Customers and beneficiaries may be operational or functional areas within the performing organization or customers 
and beneficiaries external to the performing organization, such as a specific group of interested parties, a business 
sector, an industry, a particular demographic, or the general population.
Benefits are often defined in the context of the intended beneficiary and may be shared among multiple stakeholders. 
While the organization’s customers or the program’s intended beneficiaries may be improved in some way as a result of 
the program, the performing organization may also benefit from the new or improved capability to consistently deliver 
and sustain the resulting products, services, or capabilities produced.
Other organizations, stakeholders, and intended beneficiaries may not realize a benefit from the program and 
may be subject to negative impacts, such as a reduction in personnel or consolidation of positions or organizations. 
Minimizing the negative impacts is as important as realizing the benefits and should be managed, measured, and 
properly communicated to the organization’s leadership and to affected stakeholders and organizations. The program 
manager should consider coordinating with internal organizations such as the legal, marketing, and human resources 
departments when addressing a negative consequence.
Programs and their components deliver outcomes that provide benefits that support the organization’s strategic goals 
and objectives. Benefits may not be realized until the completion of the program (or well after completion) or may be 
realized in an iterative fashion as the components within the program produce incremental results that can be leveraged 
by the intended recipients. Following program closure, benefits may continue to be realized.

45
Depending on the nature of the program, the program roadmap is a graphical representation of the incremental 
benefits and provides a visual of when the return on investment may help fund the future program benefits and outcomes. 
It is important that, as incremental benefits are being produced, the intended recipients, whether internal or external 
to the organization, are prepared for the resulting change and are able to sustain the incremental benefits through the 
completion of the program and beyond.
Some programs deliver benefits only after all of the components have been completed. In this case, the components’ 
deliverables and outcomes all contribute to the full realization of the full benefit. Examples of programs that deliver 
the intended benefits at the end of the program may include major construction efforts; public works programs, such 
as roads, dams, or bridges; aerospace programs; aircraft manufacturing or shipbuilding; or medical devices and 
pharmaceuticals.
Program Benefits Management also ensures that the benefits provided by the organization’s investment in a program 
can be sustained following the conclusion of the program. Throughout the program delivery phase (see Section 7.1.3), 
program components are planned, developed, integrated, and managed to facilitate the delivery of the intended program 
benefits. During the program benefits delivery phase, the benefits analysis and planning activities, along with the 
benefits delivery activities, may be performed in an iterative fashion, especially when corrective action is required to 
achieve the program benefits.
Program benefits should be monitored and managed. Benefits should be considered an essential part of the program’s 
deliverables. A risk structure for the benefits needs to be established based on the organization’s risk appetite and the 
program’s strategic value. Each program benefit needs to be assigned a risk probability. Several factors may drive the 
probability, including the number of components needed to realize the benefit or the ability of the organization to absorb 
the change and sustain it.
Program Benefits Management requires continuous interaction with the other performance domains throughout the 
program’s duration. Interactions are cyclical in nature and generally begin top-down during early phases of the program 
and bottom-up in later phases. For example, Program Strategy Alignment, in conjunction with Program Stakeholder 
Engagement, provides the critical inputs/parameters to the program, including vision, mission, strategic goals and 
objectives, and the business case that defines the program benefits. Program performance data are evaluated through 
program governance to ensure that the program will produce its intended benefits and outcomes.
Figure 4-1 shows the relationship between the program life cycle (see Section 7) and the Program Benefits 
Management Performance Domain.

4.1 BENEFITS IDENTIFICATION
The purpose of the benefits identification phase is to analyze the available information about organizational and 
business strategies, internal and external influences, and program drivers to identify and qualify the benefits that 
program stakeholders expect to realize. As described in Section 3.1, organizational initiatives are identified and 
documented during an organization’s strategic planning exercise. These initiatives describe the goals and activities 
for the organization. A strategic decision-making body, typically in the form of a program steering committee, may 
issue a program charter defining the strategic objectives that the program is intended to address and the benefits 
that are expected to be realized. The program charter is supported by a valid business case. Activities that make up 
benefits identification include defining the objectives and critical success factors for the program, and identifying and 
quantifying business benefits.

The business case serves as a formal declaration of the program benefits, the expected delivery, and the justification 
for the resources that will be expended to deliver it. The business case establishes the authority, intent, philosophy of the 
business need, and program sponsorship, while providing direction for structure, guiding principles, and organization of 
the program. The program’s business case connects with the organizational strategy and objectives and helps identify 
the level of investment and support required to achieve the program benefits. See Sections 3.1, 6.1.3, and 7.1.2.1 for 
further information on the program business case.
4.1.1 BENEFITS REGISTER
The benefits register collects and lists the planned benefits for the program and is used to measure and communicate 
the delivery of benefits throughout the duration of the program. In the benefits identification phase, the benefits register 
is developed based on the program business case, the organization’s strategic plan, and other relevant program 
objectives. The register is then reviewed with key stakeholders to develop the appropriate performance measures 
for each of the benefits. Key performance indicators are identified in this phase and their associated quantitative and 
qualitative measures are defined and elaborated in the next phase, where the program benefits register is updated. The 
benefits register may take many forms, but typically includes (at a minimum):
u
u List of planned benefits;
u
u Mapping of the planned benefits to the program components, as reflected in the program roadmap;
u
u Description of how each benefit will be measured;
u
u Key performance indicators and thresholds for evaluating their achievement;
u
u Risk assessment and probability for achieving the benefit;
u
u Status or progress indicator for each benefit;
u
u Target dates and milestones for benefits achievement;
u
u Person, group, or organization responsible for delivering each benefit;
u
u Establishment of processes for measuring progress against the benefits plan; and
u
u Tracking and communications processes necessary to record program progress and report to stakeholders.

48	
Section 4
4.2 BENEFITS ANALYSIS AND PLANNING
The purpose of the benefits analysis and planning phase is to establish the program benefits management plan and 
develop the benefits metrics and framework for monitoring and controlling both the components and the measurement 
of benefits within the program. Activities that make up benefits analysis and planning include:
u
u Establishing the benefits management plan that will guide the work through the remainder of the program,
u
u Defining and prioritizing program components and their interdependencies,
u
u Defining the key performance indicators and associated quantitative measures required to effectively monitor the 
delivery of program benefits,
u
u Establishing the performance baseline for the program and communicating program performance metrics to the 
key stakeholders, and
u
u Updating positive and negative risks to benefits as more information becomes known.
It is especially important to quantify the incremental delivery of benefits so that the full realization of planned benefits 
can be measured during the performance of the program. Meaningful measures help the program manager and 
stakeholders determine whether benefits exceed their control thresholds and whether they are delivered in a timely 
manner. Quantification of incremental benefits includes the timing of the delivery of benefits (e.g., the date when 
realization should start); qualification of intangible benefits (e.g., improved morale or perception of the organization); 
quantification of the resulting benefits (e.g., hours saved, profit increased, and objectives achieved; cultural, political, 
or legislative improvement attained; market share increased, competitor strength reduced, or incremental productivity 
improvements attained); and costs, as illustrated in Figure 4-2. In this example, program costs may continue after 
program closeout as operational costs to sustain the benefits included in the program funding; program costs may also 
end at program closeout. When the program continues, it may or may not provide additional funds to the organization 
accepting the benefit to cover the deferred costs of new benefits; in some cases, the organization may have to self-fund 
the costs. In addition, quantifiable benefits have not yet exceeded program costs in this example; program benefits are 
expected to exceed program costs over the time, as specified in the business case.

49
As the program’s benefits are further defined, risks to the program benefits should be further refined and new benefit 
risks quantified. Examples of risks to implementing benefits include stakeholder acceptance, transition complexity, the 
amount of change being absorbed by the organization, realization of unexpected outcomes, and other situations that 
specific industries may encounter. Positive risks in the form of opportunities to optimize the delivery of benefits should 
also be identified, refined, and quantified. Opportunities may include optimization of how critical resources are allocated 
or consumed by the program components or leveraging a new technology to reduce the effort or resources required to 
deliver a particular benefit.
The program governance function helps the program team determine if benefits achievement is occurring within the 
stated parameters so changes to the components or the program as a whole may be proposed when necessary. This 
analysis requires linking benefits to program objectives, financial expenditures (operational and capital), measurement 
criteria (including key performance indicators), and measurement and review points. The benefits management plan 
is also used during the benefits delivery phase to verify that benefits are being realized as planned, while providing 
feedback to program stakeholders and the program steering committee to facilitate successful benefit delivery.

Section 4
4.2.1 BENEFITS MANAGEMENT PLAN
The benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining the processes for creating, maximizing, 
and sustaining the benefits provided by a project or program. The benefits management plan formally documents the 
activities necessary for achieving the program’s planned benefits. It identifies how and when benefits are expected 
to be delivered to the organization and specifies mechanisms that should be in place to ensure that the benefits 
are fully realized over time. The benefits management plan is the baseline document that guides the delivery of 
benefits during the program’s performance. The benefits management plan also identifies the associated activities, 
processes, and systems needed for the change driven by the realization of benefits; the required changes to existing 
processes and systems; and how and when the transition to an operational state will occur.
The benefits management plan should:
u
u Define each benefit and associated assumptions and determine how each benefit will be achieved;
u
u Link components outputs to the planned program outcomes;
u
u Define the metrics (including key performance indicators) and procedures to measure benefits;
u
u Define roles and responsibilities required to manage the benefits;
u
u Define how the resulting benefits and capabilities will be transitioned into an operational state to achieve benefits;
u
u Define how the resulting capabilities will be transitioned to the individuals, groups, or organizations responsible 
for sustaining the benefits; and
u
u Provide a process for managing the overall benefits management effort.
4.2.2 BENEFITS MANAGEMENT AND THE PROGRAM ROADMAP
Program benefits management establishes the program architecture that maps how the components will deliver 
the capabilities and outcomes that are intended to achieve the program benefits. The program roadmap defines the 
structure of the program components by identifying the relationships among the components and the rules that govern 
their inclusion. The program roadmap describes evolving aspects of the program including incremental benefits delivery. 
See Section 3.3 for further information on the program roadmap.
4.2.3 BENEFITS REGISTER UPDATE
The benefits register, initiated during benefits identification, is updated during benefits analysis and planning. At this 
time, program benefits are mapped to the program components based on the program roadmap. The benefits register is 
then reviewed with the appropriate stakeholders to define and approve key performance indicators and other measures 
that will be used to monitor program performance.

51
4.3 BENEFITS DELIVERY
The purpose of the benefits delivery phase is to ensure that the program delivers the expected benefits, as defined 
in the benefits management plan. As the program is implemented, risks affecting benefits may be realized, may need 
to be updated, or may become obsolete; additionally, new risks and updated ones should be included in the benefits 
register with the associated benefits. Activities that make up benefits delivery include:
u
u Monitoring the organizational environment (including internal and external factors), program objectives, and 
benefits realization to ensure that the program remains aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives;
u
u Initiating, performing, transitioning, and closing components, and managing the interdependencies among them;
u
u Evaluating opportunities and threats affecting benefits, including updating the benefits register for new 
opportunities and risks affecting benefits, and updating realized or obsolete risks affecting benefits;
u
u Evaluating key performance indicators related to program financials, compliance, quality, safety, and stakeholder 
satisfaction in order to monitor the delivery of benefits; and
u
u Recording program progress in the benefits register and reporting to key stakeholders as directed in the program 
communications management plan.
The benefits delivery phase ensures that there is a defined set of reports or metrics reported to the program 
management office, program steering committee, program sponsors, and other program stakeholders. By consistently 
monitoring and reporting on benefits metrics, stakeholders can assess the overall health of the program and take 
appropriate action to ensure successful benefits delivery.
Benefits management is an iterative process. Benefits analysis and planning and benefits delivery, in particular, have a 
cyclical relationship. Benefits analysis and planning may be continuously revisited as conditions change. Corrective action 
may need to be taken in response to information gained from monitoring the organizational environment. Components 
may have to be modified in order to maintain alignment of the expected program results with the organization’s strategic 
objectives. Corrective action may also need to be taken as a result of evaluating program risks and key performance 
indicators. Components may require modification due to performance related to program financials, compliance, quality, 
safety, and/or stakeholder satisfaction. These corrective actions may require that program components be added, 
changed, or terminated during the benefits delivery phase.

52	
Section 4
4.3.1 BENEFITS AND PROGRAM COMPONENTS
Each component should be initiated at the appropriate time in the program and integrated to incorporate its output to 
the program as a whole. The initiation and closure of these components are significant milestones in the program roadmap 
and schedule. The milestones signal the achievement and delivery of incremental benefits. As the benefits management 
plan is modified to reflect changes in program pacing, the program roadmap (see Section 3.3) is also updated.
4.3.2 BENEFITS AND PROGRAM GOVERNANCE
For a benefit to have value, it needs to be realized to a sufficient degree and in a timely manner. The actual benefits 
delivered by the program components or program itself should be regularly evaluated against the expected benefits, 
as defined in the benefits management plan. A key aspect to consider is whether program components, and even 
the program as a whole, are still viable. Should the program’s benefit proposition change (for example, if the overall 
life cycle cost exceeds the proposed benefits) or if the benefits are delivered too late (for example, when a window of 
opportunity no longer exists), the program’s roadmap should be assessed. Opportunities to optimize the program pacing 
may also be identified, as well as other synergies and efficiencies among components. The benefits management plan 
may have to be modified to reflect changes in the program components and pacing. When the benefits management 
plan is modified, the program roadmap should be updated as well.
The Program Governance Performance Domain integrates with the Benefits Management Performance Domain to 
help ensure that the program is continuously aligned with the organizational strategy and that the intended value can 
still be achieved by the delivery of program benefits.
Effective governance helps ensure that the promised outcomes are achieved and delivered for the organization to 
realize intended benefits. The resulting benefits review requires analysis of the planned versus actual benefits across a 
wide range of factors, including the key performance indicators. In particular, the following aspects should be analyzed 
and assessed during the benefits delivery phase:
u
u Strategic alignment. Focuses on ensuring the linkage of enterprise and program plans; on defining, maintaining, 
and validating the program value proposition; and on aligning program management with enterprise operations 
management. For internally focused programs, the benefits realization processes measure how the new benefits 
affect the flow of operations of the organization as the change is introduced and how negative impacts and the 
potential disruptiveness of introducing the change may be minimized.
u
u Value delivery. Focuses on ensuring that the program delivers the intended benefits. There may be a window 
of opportunity for the realization of a particular planned benefit and for that benefit to generate real value. 
The program manager, program steering committee, and key stakeholders may determine if the window of 
opportunity was met or compromised by actual events in the program or components (for example, a delay, cost 
overrun, or scope reduction). Investments may also have time value, where shifts in component schedules have 
additional financial impact.

53
4.4 BENEFITS TRANSITION
The purpose of the benefits transition phase is to ensure that program benefits are transitioned to operational areas 
and can be sustained once they are transferred. Value is delivered when the organization, community, or other program 
beneficiaries are able to utilize these benefits.
Activities that make up benefits transition include:
u
u Verifying that the integration, transition, and closure of the program and its components meet or exceed the 
benefit realization criteria established to achieve the program’s strategic objectives; and
u
u Developing a transition plan to facilitate the ongoing realization of benefits when turned over to the impacted 
operational areas.
Benefits transition ensures that the scope of the transition is defined, the stakeholders in the receiving organizations 
or functions are identified and participate in the planning, the program benefits are measured and sustainment plans 
are developed, and the transition is executed.
Benefits transition planning activities within the program are only one part of the complete transition process. The 
receiving organization or function is responsible for all preparation processes and activities within their domain to 
ensure that the product, service, or capability is received and incorporated into their domain. There may be multiple 
transition events as individual program components close or as other work activity within the program closes.
Benefits may be realized before the formal work of the program has ended and will likely continue long after the 
formal work has been completed. Benefits transition may be performed following the close of an individual program 
component if that component is intended to provide incremental benefits to the organization. Benefits transition may 
also occur following the close of the overall program when the program as a whole is intended to provide benefits to the 
organization and no incremental benefits have been identified.
Benefits are quantified so that their realization can be measured over time. Benefits are sometimes not realized until 
long after the end of active work on a program and may need to be monitored well after the program has closed. At the 
end of the program, the resulting benefits should be compared against those intended in the business case to ensure 
that the program will actually deliver the intended benefits.
Benefits transition activities ensure that individual program component results or outputs meet acceptance criteria, 
are satisfactorily closed or integrated into other program elements, and contribute to the overall achievement of the 
collective set of program benefits. Benefits transition activities may include but are not limited to:

54	
Section 4
u
u Evaluation of program and program component performance against applicable acceptance criteria, including 
key performance indicators;
u
u Review and evaluation of acceptance criteria applicable to delivered components or outputs;
u
u Review of operational and program process documentation;
u
u Review of training and maintenance materials (if they apply);
u
u Review of applicable contractual agreements;
u
u Assessment to determine if resulting changes have been successfully integrated;
u
u Activities related to improving acceptance of resulting changes (workshops, meetings, training, etc.);
u
u Transfer of risk(s) affecting the benefits transitioned to the receiving organization;
u
u Readiness assessment and approval by the receiving person, group, or organization; and
u
u Disposition of all related resources.
The receiver in the transition process varies depending on the individual component event and program type. A 
product support organization could be the receiver for a product line that a company develops. For a service provided 
to customers, the receiver could be the service management organization. If the work products are developed for an 
external customer, the transition could be to the customer’s organization. In some cases, the transition may be from 
one program to another.
A program may also be terminated with no transition to operations. This may occur when the charter is fulfilled and 
operations are not necessary to continue realization of ongoing benefits, or the chartered program is no longer of value 
to the organization. Transition may be a formal activity among functions within a single organization or a contract-
based activity with an entity outside the organization. The receiving entity should have a clear understanding of the 
capabilities or results to be transitioned and what is required for the entity to successfully sustain the benefits. All 
pertinent documents, training and materials, supporting systems, facilities, and personnel are typically provided during 
the transition and may include transition meetings and conferences.
Should any remaining risk(s) affecting the transitioned benefit remain open, the program manager should transfer the 
risk to the appropriate organization. The organization accepting the benefit may not be the team to monitor ongoing risk 
for the benefit. The risk(s) may be monitored by a governance organization such as a program management office (PMO).

55
4.5 BENEFITS SUSTAINMENT
The purpose of the benefits sustainment phase is the ongoing maintenance activities performed beyond the end of 
the program by receiving organizations to ensure continued generation of the improvements and outcomes delivered 
by the program. As the program is closed, responsibility for sustaining the benefits provided by the program may 
pass to another organization or another program. Benefits may be sustained through operations, maintenance, new 
components, or other efforts. A benefits sustainment plan should be developed prior to program closure to identify the 
risks, processes, measures, metrics, and tools necessary to ensure the continued realization of the benefits delivered.
Ongoing sustainment of program benefits should be planned by the program manager and the component project 
managers during the performance of the program. The actual work that ensures the sustainment of benefits is typically 
conducted after the close of the program and is beyond the scope of the individual components. Although the receiving 
person, organization, or beneficiary group performs the work that ensures benefits continue beyond the end of the 
program, the program manager is responsible for planning these post-transition activities during the performance of 
the program.
The responsibility for benefits sustainment falls outside the traditional project life cycle; however, this responsibility 
may remain within the program life cycle. While these ongoing product, service, or capability support activities may fall 
within the scope of the program, they typically are operational in nature and typically are not run as a program or project.
Activities that make up benefits sustainment include but are not limited to:
u
u Planning for the operational, financial, and behavioral changes necessary for program recipients (individuals, 
groups, organizations, industries, and sectors) to continue monitoring performance;
u
u Implementing the required change efforts to ensure that the capabilities provided during the course of the 
program continue when the program is closed and the program’s resources are returned to the organization;
u
u Monitoring the performance of the product, service, capability, or results from a reliability and availability-for-use 
perspective and comparing actual performance to planned performance, including key performance indicators;
u
u Monitoring the continued suitability of the deployed product, service, capability, or results to provide the benefits 
expected by the customers owning and operating it. This may include the continued viability of interfaces with 
other products, services, capabilities, or results and the continued completeness of the functionality;

56	
Section 4
u
u Monitoring the continued availability of logistics support for the product, service, capability, or results in light of 
technological advancements and the willingness of vendors to continue to support older configurations;
u
u Responding to customer inputs on their needs for product, service, capability, or results of support assistance or 
for improvements in performance or functionality;
u
u Providing on-demand support for the product, service, capability, or results either in features, improved technical 
information, or real-time help desk support;
u
u Planning for and establishing operational support of the product, service, capability, or results separate from the 
program management function without relinquishing the other product support functions;
u
u Updating technical information concerning the product, service, capability, or improvement in response to 
frequent product support queries;
u
u Planning the transition of product or capability support from program management to an operations function 
within an organization;
u
u Planning the retirement and phase-out of the product or capability, or the cessation of support with appropriate 
guidance to the current customers;
u
u Developing business cases and the potential initiation of new projects or programs to respond to operational 
issues with the deployed product, service, or capability being supported or public acceptance/reaction to the 
improvement or to legislative changes; political, economic, and socioeconomic changes; cultural shifts; or 
logistics issues with a deployed product, service, capability, or results being supported; and
u
u Monitoring any outstanding risks affecting the program’s benefits.
Refer to Figure 1-1 for further information regarding program life cycle and benefits.

PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Program Stakeholder Engagement is the performance domain that identifies and analyzes stakeholder needs and 
manages expectations and communications to foster stakeholder support.
This section includes:
5.1	 Program Stakeholder Identification
5.2	 Program Stakeholder Analysis
5.3	 Program Stakeholder Engagement Planning
5.4	 Program Stakeholder Engagement
5.5	 Program Stakeholder Communications
A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected 
by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project, program, or portfolio.
Stakeholders may be internal or external to the program and may have a positive or negative impact on the outcome 
of the program. Program and project managers need to be aware of the stakeholders’ impact and level of influence to 
understand and address the changing environments of programs and projects.
Stakeholders should be identified, analyzed, categorized, and monitored. Unlike program resources, not all 
stakeholders can be managed directly—but their expectations can be. In many cases, external stakeholders have 
more influence than the program manager, the program team, and even the program sponsor. Balancing stakeholder 
interests is important, considering their potential impact on program benefits realization or the inherent conflicting 
nature of those interests. People have a tendency to resist direct management when the relationship does not have 
a hierarchical affiliation. For this reason, most program management literature focuses on the notion of stakeholder 
engagement rather than stakeholder management.
Stakeholder engagement is often expressed as direct and indirect communication among the stakeholder and the 
program’s leaders and team. Engagement with the program team may be performed by people with different roles in the 
program and project teams. Stakeholder engagement, however, includes more than just communication. For example, 
stakeholders can be engaged by involving them in goal setting, quality analysis reviews, or other program activities. 
The primary objective is to gain and maintain stakeholder buy-in for the program’s objectives, benefits, and outcomes.

58	
Section 5
Ambiguity and uncertainty are common characteristics of programs. The complexity of those environments warrants 
the efforts of the program manager to understand and manage the wide stakeholder base. Figure 5-1 depicts a diverse 
stakeholder environment that may shape the actions needed to manage those expectations. Mapping stakeholders is 
a pivotal step to ensure successful expectation management, and in turn deliver business benefits to the organization. 
Beyond the communications aspect, stakeholder engagement concerns negotiation of objectives, agreement on desired 
benefits, commitment to resources, and ongoing support throughout the program.

The level of interest and the level of influence in the program may vary widely from stakeholder to stakeholder. A 
stakeholder may be unaware of the program or, if aware, may not support it. It is the responsibility of the program 
manager to expend sufficient time and energy with known stakeholders to ensure all points of view have been considered 
and addressed.
The program manager interacts with stakeholders in the following ways:
u
u Engages stakeholders by assessing their attitudes and interests toward the program and their change readiness;
u
u Includes stakeholders in program activities and uses communications targeted to their needs, interests, 
requirements, expectations, and wants, according to their change readiness and selected organizational change 
management strategy speed and scale;
u
u Monitors stakeholder feedback within the context and understanding of the relationship to the program; and
u
u Supports training initiatives as needed within the context of the program or related organizational structure of 
the program component.
This two-way communication enables the program manager to deliver the benefits for the organization in accordance 
with the program charter.
Stakeholder engagement at the program level can be challenging because some stakeholders view the program 
benefits as change. People have the propensity to resist change whenever they have not directly requested it, have 
not participated in creating it, do not understand the necessity for it, or are concerned with the effect of the change on 
them personally. Thus, the program manager and the program team members need to understand the attitudes and the 
agendas for each stakeholder throughout the duration of the program. The program manager should be the champion 
for change in the organization and understand the motivations of each stakeholder who could attempt to alter the course 
of the program or intentionally derail it and prevent the program from realizing one or more of its intended benefits 
or outcomes. As the program evolves in this complex environment and it adapts to ensure that it delivers its intended 
benefits, its strategy and plans may change. For support, the program manager also draws on the program sponsor or 
sponsoring group to foster organizational conditions, through program governance, to enable the effective realization 
of program benefits.
The program manager needs to bridge the gap between the current state of the organization and the desired future 
state. To do so, the program manager should understand the current state and how the program and its benefits will 
move the organization to the future state. Therefore, the program manager should be familiar with organizational 
change management.

60	
Section 5
Successful program managers utilize strong leadership skills to set clear stakeholder engagement goals for the 
program team to address the change the program will bring. These goals include engaging stakeholders to assess their 
readiness for change, planning for the change, providing program resources and support for the change, facilitating 
or negotiating the approach to implement change, and obtaining and evaluating the stakeholders’ feedback on the 
program’s progress.
5.1 PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION
Program stakeholder identification aims to systematically identify all key stakeholders (or stakeholder groups) in the 
stakeholder register. This register lists the stakeholders and categorizes their relationship to the program, their ability 
to influence the program outcome, their degree of support for the program, and other characteristics or attributes the 
program manager feels could influence the stakeholders’ perception and the program’s outcomes.
Table 5-1 provides an example of stakeholder categorization within a program.
Table 5-1. Stakeholder Register
The stakeholder register should be established and maintained in such a way that members of the program team 
can reference it easily for use in reporting, distributing program deliverables, and providing formal and informal 
communications. It should be noted that the stakeholder register may contain politically and legally sensitive information, 
and may have access and review restrictions placed on it by the program manager. As a result, it may be appropriate 
to ensure that the stakeholder register is appropriately secured. The program manager should comply with data privacy 
regulations in countries where the program operates. The stakeholder register is a dynamic document. As the program 
evolves, new stakeholders may emerge or interests of current groups may shift. The program manager should monitor 
the environment, and prepare and update the register as required.

regulatory and legal boundaries of their local and national sovereign governments. Typically, these organizations 
will set mandatory standards or requirements.

62	
Section 5
u
u Affected individuals or organizations. Those who perceive that they will either benefit from or be disadvantaged 
by the program’s activities.
u
u Other groups. Groups representing consumer, environmental, or other interests (including political interests). 
Organizational support functions such as human resources, legal, administration, and infrastructure are also 
considered key stakeholders.
The identification of stakeholders using the brainstorming technique aims to name stakeholders across the entire 
program life cycle. The resulting stakeholder register is an essential tool leading to effective engagement.
5.2 PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
Once all major stakeholders are listed in the stakeholder register, the program manager will categorize them in order 
to start analyzing them. The categorization will highlight differences in their needs, expectations, or influence. Key 
information should be obtained from stakeholders in order to better understand the organizational culture, politics, and 
concerns related to the program, as well as the overall impact of the program. This information may be obtained through 
historical information, individual interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys 
allow the program team to solicit feedback from a greater number of stakeholders than is possible with interviews or 
focus groups. Regardless of the technique used, key information should be gathered through open-ended questions 
to elicit stakeholder feedback. From the information gathered, a prioritized list of stakeholders should be developed to 
help focus the engagement effort on the people and organizations who have the most influence (positive or negative) 
on the program. The program manager should establish a balance between activities related to mitigating the effect of 
stakeholders who view the program negatively and encouraging the active support of stakeholders who see the program 
as a positive contribution.
For complex programs, the program manager may develop a stakeholder map to visually represent the interaction 
of all stakeholders’ current and desired support and influence. The map serves as a tool to assess the impact of a 
change on the program community. It allows the program team to make informed decisions about how and when to 
engage stakeholders, taking into account their interest, influence, involvement, interdependencies and support levels. 
An alternative classification model used for stakeholder analysis is the power/interest grid. It groups stakeholders based 
on their level of authority (“power”) and their level of concern (“interest”) regarding the project outcomes. Figure 5-2 
presents an example of the power/ interest grid with A-H representing the placement of generic stakeholders.

63
Figure 5-2. Example Power/Interest Grid with Stakeholders
By identifying stakeholder expectations and clearly outlining key indicators and expected benefits, the program 
manager creates a framework to address ongoing program activities and evolving stakeholder needs. The stakeholder 
map can function as a tool to help identify the need for interactions with stakeholders. It brings to light the potential 
partnerships among stakeholders and the collaboration opportunities that contribute to the success of the program. As 
the need arises, the program manager can use the stakeholder map to remind teams of which stakeholders need to be 
engaged at various times in the program life cycle. The overall stakeholder register and the prioritization of stakeholder 
engagement activities should be regularly reviewed and updated as the work of the program progresses.
5.3 PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PLANNING
The stakeholder engagement planning activity outlines how all program stakeholders will be engaged throughout 
the duration of the program. The stakeholder register and stakeholder map are analyzed with consideration of the 
organization’s strategic plan, the program charter, and program business case to understand the environment in which 
the program will operate.

Section 5
As part of the stakeholder analysis and engagement planning, the following aspects for each stakeholder are taken 
into consideration:
u
u Organizational culture and acceptance of change,
u
u Attitudes about the program and its sponsors,
u
u Relevant phase(s) applicable to stakeholders specific engagement,
u
u Expectation of program benefits delivery,
u
u Degree of support or opposition to the program benefits, and
u
u Ability to influence the outcome of the program.
This effort results in the stakeholder engagement plan, which contains a detailed strategy for effective stakeholder 
engagement, based on current situation. The plan includes stakeholder engagement guidelines and provides insight on 
how the stakeholders are engaged in various components of the program. The plan defines the metrics used to measure 
the performance of stakeholder engagement activities. This could include measures of participation in meetings and 
other communication channels, and the degree of active or passive support or resistance, and can also strive to measure 
the effectiveness of the engagement in meeting its intended goal. The guidelines for stakeholder engagement should 
be provided to the component projects, subsidiary programs, and other program activities under the program. The 
stakeholder engagement plan provides critical information used in the development of program documentation and its 
ongoing alignment as the known stakeholders change (see Section 8.1.2.2).
5.4 PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Stakeholder engagement is a continuous program activity because the list of stakeholders and their attitudes and 
opinions change as the program progresses and delivers benefits. One of the primary roles of the program manager 
throughout the duration of the program is to ensure all stakeholders are adequately and appropriately engaged. Identifying 
stakeholders, mapping their interests, and planning for stakeholder engagement directly support this process. The 
stakeholder register, stakeholder map, and stakeholder engagement plan should be referenced and evaluated often, 
and updated as needed.

65
Interacting and engaging with stakeholders allows the program team to communicate program benefits and 
their relevance to the organization’s strategic objectives. When necessary, the program manager may utilize strong 
communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills to help defuse stakeholder opposition to the program and 
its stated benefits. Large programs with diverse stakeholders may also require facilitated negotiation sessions among 
stakeholders or stakeholder groups when their expectations conflict.
To help stakeholders establish common high-level expectations for the delivery of the program’s benefits, the 
program manager provides stakeholders with appropriate information contained in the program charter and program 
business case, which can include an accompanying executive brief to summarize the details of the risks, dependencies, 
and benefits.
The primary metrics for stakeholder engagement are positive contributions to the realization of the program’s 
objectives and benefits, stakeholder participation, and frequency or rate of communication with the program team. 
The program manager strives to ensure all interactions with the stakeholders are adequately logged, including meeting 
invitations, attendance, meeting minutes, and action items. Program managers review stakeholder metrics regularly 
to identify potential risks caused by lack of participation from stakeholders. Participation trends are analyzed and 
root-cause analysis is performed to identify and address the causes of nonparticipation. The history of stakeholder 
participation provides important background information that could influence stakeholder perceptions and expectations. 
For example, when a stakeholder has not been actively participating, it may be that the stakeholder is confident in the 
program’s direction or possibly has inaccurate expectations or has lost interest in the program. Thorough analysis 
avoids incorrect assumptions about stakeholder behavior that could lead to unanticipated issues or poor program 
management decisions.
As the program team works with the stakeholders, it collects and logs stakeholder issues and concerns and manages 
them to closure. Use of an issue log to document, prioritize, and track issues helps the entire program team understand 
the feedback received from the stakeholders. When the list of stakeholders is small, a simple spreadsheet may be an 
adequate tracking tool. For programs with complex risks and issues affecting large numbers of stakeholders, a more 
sophisticated tracking and prioritization mechanism may be required.
Stakeholder issues and concerns are likely to affect aspects of the program such as its scope, benefits, risks, 
costs, schedule, priorities, and outcomes. Impact analysis could be used to understand the urgency and probability of 
stakeholder issues and determine which issues could turn into program risks.

66	
Section 5
5.5 PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
Effective communications create a bridge between diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and 
organizational backgrounds, different levels of expertise, and different perspectives and interests, all of which may 
impact or influence the delivery of benefits by the program. Communication is at the heart of program stakeholder 
engagement. It is key to executing program endeavors and, ultimately, delivering benefits to the organization. This 
critical component is a vehicle for information sharing, negotiation, and collaboration among the program team members 
to drive program implementation efforts.
The program manager should actively engage stakeholders throughout the life cycle of the program, with particular 
attention to those key stakeholders who are high in power and influence. A strategy can be crafted for each stakeholder 
as identified in the stakeholder register (see Table 5-1). This accounts for communication requirements such as what 
information should be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail. It can also address a 
feedback loop to discuss program changes and an escalation process. The resulting communication approach targets 
stakeholders’ support for the program strategy and delivery of the program benefits.
Some stakeholders are naturally curious about the program and often raise questions. These questions and their 
answers should be captured and published in a way that allows multiple stakeholders to benefit from the exchange. In 
many cases, the documentation may need to be formatted and presented differently for certain stakeholder audiences. 
It is important that decision-making stakeholders are provided with adequate information to make the right decisions at 
the right time necessary to move the program forward. The program manager should continually monitor changes and 
update stakeholder engagement activities and deliverables as needed.
Communication with some stakeholders is inherent in many program management activities. These activities are 
described in detail in Section 8. The program manager should constantly monitor and foster an environment where 
stakeholder communication needs are met.

PROGRAM GOVERNANCE
Program Governance is the performance domain that enables and performs program decision making, establishes 
practices to support the program, and maintains program oversight.
This section includes:
6.1	 Program Governance Practices
6.2	 Program Governance Roles
6.3	 Program Governance Design and Implementation
Program Governance comprises the framework, functions, and processes by which a program is monitored, 
managed, and supported in order to meet organizational strategic and operational goals. The focus of program 
governance is the delivery of program benefits by establishing the systems and methods by which a program and 
its strategy are defined, authorized, monitored, and supported by its sponsoring organization. A program governance 
framework, when well designed, provides practices for effective decision making and ensures the program is managed 
appropriately. Program governance is performed through the actions of a review and decision-making group that is 
charged with endorsing or approving recommendations regarding a program under its authority. The program manager 
has management responsibilities to ensure that the program is run within the governance framework while managing 
the day-to-day program activities. The program manager should ensure that the program team understands and abides 
by the governance procedures and the underlying governance principles.
Program governance may also refer to the framework, functions, and processes by which a program team monitors 
and manages the components that are being performed to support the program. Governance of components is often 
achieved through the actions of the program manager and program team responsible for the integrated outcomes of the 
program. Such a responsibility may also be called component governance.
Program governance is impacted by organizational governance, which is a structured way to provide control, 
direction, and coordination through people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational 
goals. Typically, portfolio governance is the hierarchical level of governance where program investments are authorized.

68	
Section 6
Figure 6-1 illustrates the governance relationships for programs. Within a portfolio structure, portfolio governance-
supporting functions and processes are linked to programs through portfolio governance. For stand-alone programs 
that are outside of a portfolio structure, a governing body provides governance-supporting functions and processes to 
programs, including governance policies, oversight, control, integration, and decision-making functions and processes. 
The type and frequency of the governance activities are determined by portfolio governance and governing bodies. The 
portfolio provides governance policies, oversight, control, integration, and decision-making functions and processes to 
programs within the portfolio structure.

69
Effective program governance supports the success of a program by:
u
u Ensuring that the goals of the program remain aligned with the strategic vision, operational capabilities, and 
resource commitments of the sponsoring organization. Compliance with the reporting and controlling processes 
required to support this alignment is enforced by the Program Governance domain;
u
u Approving, endorsing, and initiating the program and securing funding from the sponsoring organization;
u
u Establishing clear, well-understood agreements as to how the sponsoring organization will oversee the program, 
and conversely, the degree of autonomy that the program will be given in the pursuit of its goals;
u
u Facilitating the engagement of program stakeholders by establishing clear expectations for each program’s 
interactions with key governing stakeholders throughout the program;
u
u Creating an environment for communicating and addressing program risks and uncertainties to the organization, 
as well as opportunities and issues that arise during the course of program performance;
u
u Providing a framework that is aligned with portfolio and corporate governance policies and processes for 
assessing and ensuring the program is compliant. Each program may need to create a particular governance 
process or procedure, but it should be aligned with the organization’s governance principles;
u
u Designing and authorizing the assurance process and, when required, executing reviews and health checks of 
the program progress in delivering its expected benefits. Various review types are used, including phase-gate 
reviews, other decision point reviews, and periodic health checks;
u
u Enabling the organization to assess the viability of the organization’s strategic plan and the level of support 
required to achieve it;
u
u Selecting, endorsing, and enabling the pursuit of program components, including projects, subsidiary programs, 
and other program activities; and
u
u Making decisions to transition between phases, terminate, or close the program.
Effective program governance is especially important in environments that are highly complex or uncertain when it 
is necessary to respond rapidly to outcomes and information that become available during the course of the program. 
Program governance makes it possible to clarify the organization’s vision, facilitate alignment of the program with 
organizational strategy, and enable the periodic balancing of program demands with current organizational capabilities. 
Governance participants are able to monitor and, as necessary, authorize or limit changes to the activities performed as 
part of a program. Governance decision forums focus on facilitating the adaptive realignment of the program’s approach 
to enable the delivery of intended benefits. The roles and participants performing program governance activities are 
described in Section 6.2.

70	
Section 6
Program governance provides an important means by which programs seek authorization and support for 
dynamically changing program strategies or plans in response to emergent outcomes. A program within a portfolio is 
likely to be governed within the framework of the portfolio. Portfolio governance provides the framework, functions, 
and processes providing oversight, control, integration, and decision-making practices to programs, projects, and 
operations within the portfolio structure. In the event that the organization does not have portfolios of programs and 
projects, then the process to develop the idea and steps to authorize the program should be carried out within the 
organizational governance framework.
6.1 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
6.1.1 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE PLAN
To facilitate the design and implementation of effective governance, many organizations prepare documented 
descriptions of each program’s governance frameworks, functions, and processes. Such descriptions are summarized 
in a program governance plan, which may be a stand-alone document or a subsection of the program management 
plan. While typically there will be a program governance plan for each program in the organization, some organizations 
may use a single program governance plan to govern several programs.
The purpose of the program governance plan is to describe the systems and methods to be used to monitor, manage, 
and support a given program, and the responsibilities of specific roles for ensuring the timely and effective use of 
those systems and methods. This plan is referenced throughout the program’s duration to ensure the program is 
conforming to established governance expectations and agreements. The program governance plan may be modified 
as appropriate, based on outcomes attained during the course of the program. It is generally accepted good practice to 
ensure that modifications are effectively communicated to those stakeholders responsible for program governance and 
program management.
6.1.1.1 DEFINITIONS OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The program governance plan describes the structure and composition of the group of governance participants and 
defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. The plan defines who will have accountability and authority 
with respect to key decision-making categories and responsibility boundaries.

71
6.1.1.2 PLANNED GOVERNANCE MEETINGS
The program governance plan should contain a schedule of anticipated program-related governance meetings, 
activities, and key milestones, such as scheduled expected decision-point reviews (including phase gate reviews), 
program health checks, and required audits. It provides guidance for the scheduling of additional governance meetings 
or activities by defining criteria for their scheduling (for example, the review of program outcomes that may influence 
the program approach or program resourcing needs). The program governance plan thereby serves to influence the 
program management plan, defining the program’s requirements for governance interactions and review.
6.1.1.3 OTHER CONTENT
In addition to the descriptions and definition in Sections 6.1.1.1 and 6.1.1.2, the following items may also be covered 
in the program governance plan:
u
u Dependencies, assumptions, and constraints. List of governance key dependencies, assumptions, and 
constraints including resource, budget, and operational limitations.
u
u Benefits, performance metrics, and measurement. List of the methods and metrics used to evaluate 
the program and evaluate component contributions to benefits, and a description of how information on the 
components will be collected, consolidated, and reported (e.g., a balanced scorecard or dashboard).
u
u Support services. Identification of the areas where governance-related support is needed. Included is a 
description of the feedback and support approach used during the program.
u
u Stakeholder engagement. A listing of the stakeholders who should be engaged and communicated with during 
the program’s life cycle and governance activities (see Section 5 for more details).
u
u Governance practices. The intended design and implementation of practices described in Sections 6.1.2 
to 6.1.12 will also be covered in the program governance plan.
6.1.2 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE AND VISION AND GOALS
The vision and goals of the organization provide the basis for strategic mandates that drive the definition of most 
programs. Program governance ensures that any program within its area of authority defines its vision and goals in 
order to effectively support those of the organization.

72	
Section 6
6.1.3 PROGRAM APPROVAL, ENDORSEMENT, AND DEFINITION
In most organizations, program governance outlines responsibility for approving each program’s approach and plan 
for how it will pursue program and organizational goals, and for authorizing the use of resources to support components 
and other program work in pursuit of that approach. These approvals occur in the program definition phase and are 
facilitated by two program artifacts:
u
u Program business case. Serves as a formal projection of the benefits that the program is expected to deliver 
and a justification for the resources that will be expended to deliver it. See Section 3.1 for more information on 
the program business case.
u
u Program charter. Authorizes the program management team to use organizational resources to pursue the 
program and links the program to its business case and the organization’s strategic priorities. See Section 3.2 
for more information on the program charter.
Program governance facilitates program funding to the degree necessary to support the approved business case. 
Often, program funding is provided through a budgetary process that is controlled by a forum responsible for oversight 
of several programs. In these instances, program funding is provided in a manner consistent with program needs and 
organizational priorities, as may be defined through the organization’s portfolio management processes.
When program funding needs to be secured from external sources, program governance is typically responsible for 
entering into the appropriate agreements necessary to secure it. The funding may have constraints that limit its use due 
to law, regulations, or other limitations.
6.1.4 PROGRAM SUCCESS CRITERIA
Governance (which could be at the organizational, portfolio, or program level) establishes the minimum acceptable 
criteria for a successful program and the methods by which those criteria will be measured, communicated, and 
endorsed. The criteria describe the definition of success consistent with the expectations and needs of key program 
stakeholders, and reinforce the program alignment to deliver the maximum attainable benefits.
6.1.5 PROGRAM MONITORING, REPORTING, AND CONTROLLING
The program governance participants are uniquely positioned to monitor the progress of programs in their pursuit of 
organizational goals, working collaboratively with the program manager to maximize the opportunities for success for 
the program.

73
To support the organization’s ability to monitor program progress and strengthen the organization’s ability to assess 
program status and conformance with organizational controls, many organizations define standardized reporting and 
controlling processes applicable to all programs. Program governance assumes responsibility for enforcing program 
compliance with such processes. Reporting and controlling documents may include:
u
u Operational status and progress of programs, components, and related activities;
u
u Expected or incurred program resource requirements;
u
u Known program risks, their response plans, and escalation criteria;
u
u Strategic and operational assumptions;
u
u Benefits realized and expected sustainment;
u
u Decision criteria, tracking, and communication;
u
u Program change control;
u
u Compliance with corporate and legal policies;
u
u Program information management;
u
u Issues and issue response plans; and
u
u Program funding and financial performance.
6.1.6 PROGRAM RISK AND ISSUE GOVERNANCE
Effective risk and issue management practices ensure that key risks and issues are escalated appropriately and 
resolved in a timely manner. The escalation processes typically operate at two levels: (a) within the program, between 
component teams, the program management team, and the program steering committee; and (b) outside the program, 
between the program management team, the program’s steering committee, and other stakeholders. The expectations 
for risk and issue escalation at all levels are documented and communicated to ensure that the organization clearly 
defines its requirements for the engagement of governing stakeholders at the appropriate times for effective risk and 
issue management.
Based on the risk appetite of the organization, and working with organizational governance and the program 
management team, program governance may establish program risk thresholds for adherence within the program.

74	
Section 6
6.1.7 PROGRAM QUALITY GOVERNANCE
The governance of quality is essential to the success of the program. Quality management planning is often 
performed at the component level and is therefore governed at that level. The governance participants are responsible 
for reviewing and approving the approach to quality management and the standards by which quality will be measured. 
In some cases, the governance participants may define such measures, which include:
u
u Minimum quality criteria and standards to be applied to all components of the program;
u
u Minimum requirements for quality planning, quality control, and quality assurance by components;
u
u Any required program-level quality assurance or quality control activities; and
u
u Roles and responsibilities for required program-level quality assurance and quality control activities.
Quality control activities may differ at the component level based on the complexity and uncertainty of the given 
component. More details of the Program Quality Management activities can be found in Section 8.
6.1.8 PROGRAM CHANGE GOVERNANCE
Program governance plays a critical role in the authorization of changes to the program. The program steering 
committee is responsible for defining the types of changes that a program manager would be independently authorized 
to approve and those changes that would be significant enough to require further discussion prior to approval. As a 
result of the monitoring, reporting, and controlling practices, the governance participants should be well positioned to 
assess proposed changes to the program’s planned approach or activities.
The program manager assesses whether the risks associated with potential changes are acceptable or desirable, 
whether the proposed changes are operationally feasible and organizationally supportable, and whether the changes 
are significant enough to require approval of the program steering committee. The program manager then recommends 
changes that require approval by program governance participants through the program steering committee. The 
extent to which a change can be authorized by program governance is bounded by the program business case and 
organizational strategy. A record of the proposed change, its rationale, and its outcome is maintained by the program 
team. Section 8.2.1 provides details of the program change governance activity.

75
6.1.9 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE REVIEWS
Program governance endorses reviews of programs at key decision points in the program life cycle. These reviews 
often are conducted at times that coincide with the initiation or completion of significant segments of a program to 
enable governance to approve or disapprove the passage of a program from one significant segment to another. They 
also facilitate the review and approval of any required changes to the program at key decision points.
Key decision points occur at the end of program phases. Phase-gate reviews are reviews at the end of a phase 
in which a decision is made to continue to the next phase, to continue with modification, or to end a program 
or program component. These enable governance to approve or disapprove the passage of a program from one 
significant phase to another.
Program governance endorses decision-point reviews and their specific objectives, which may include assessments 
of the:
u
u Strategic alignment of the program and its components with the intended goals of both the program and the 
organization;
u
u Outcomes of a program component’s activities, to assess the actual (versus planned) realization of program 
benefits and the potential need to adapt the program’s plan in response to such outcomes;
u
u Risk that the program faces, to ensure that the level of risk remains acceptable and to provide opportunity for 
program governance to assist in responding to risk;
u
u Program resource needs and organizational commitments in addition to capabilities for fulfilling them;
u
u Stakeholder satisfaction with current program performance;
u
u Potential impact of external (environmental) developments on program strategies and plans;
u
u Program compliance with organizational quality or process standards;
u
u Information critical to strategic prioritization or operational investments of the organization as part of its portfolio 
management activities;
u
u Issues that should be resolved in order to improve program progress;
u
u Potential need for changes to elements of the program, in order to further improve the program’s performance 
and likelihood of success; and
u
u Fulfillment of criteria for exiting the preceding phase and entering the succeeding phase.

76	
Section 6
Other reviews may be held to support the decision-making needs of the organization, for example, program reviews 
held in support of portfolio management or budgeting processes.
Through the conduct of reviews, the program steering committee has the opportunity to confirm its support for 
continuation of the program as defined or to initiate recommendations for adaptive changes to the program’s strategy, 
improving the program’s ability to pursue and deliver its intended benefits.
At times, decision-point reviews may result in termination of the program (for example, when it is determined, for any 
number of reasons, that the program is not likely to deliver its expected benefits, cannot be supported at the investment 
level required, or should no longer be pursued as determined in a portfolio review).
The frequency of program reviews and the specific requirements of those reviews may reflect the autonomy given 
to the program team to oversee and manage the program. The organization’s expectations for program governance 
reviews should be detailed in the program governance plan.
6.1.10 PROGRAM PERIODIC HEALTH CHECKS
Program periodic health checks, generally held between decision-point reviews, assess a program’s ongoing 
performance and progress toward the realization and sustainment of benefits. The importance and use of these reviews 
increase when there is an extended period between scheduled decision-point reviews. The program governance plan 
specifies governance requirements for the scheduling, the content, the participants, and the assessments (or metrics) 
to be used during such health checks.
6.1.11 PROGRAM COMPONENT INITIATION AND TRANSITION
Program steering committee approval is usually required prior to the initiation of individual components of the program 
to the extent that the initiation of a component requires: (a) the introduction of additional governance structures that are 
responsible for monitoring and managing the component, and (b) the firm commitment of organizational resources for 
its completion. The program manager frequently acts as the proposer when seeking authorization for the initiation of 
these components. The approval of the initiation of a new program component generally includes:

77
u
u Developing, modifying, or reconfirming the business case;
u
u Ensuring the availability of resources to perform the component;
u
u Defining or reconfirming individual accountabilities for management and pursuit of the component;
u
u Ensuring the communication of critical component-related information to key stakeholders;
u
u Ensuring the establishment of component-specific, program-level quality control plans (when required); and
u
u Authorizing the governance structure to track the component’s progress against its goals.
The approach used in managing activities within the component is generally dependent on the specific nature of the 
component. For example, component projects should be managed according to the principles and practices of project 
management, as defined in the PMBOK® Guide, while other programs should be managed according to the principles 
defined and described in this standard.
Upon initiation of a new component, all program-level documentation and records dealing with the component should 
be updated to reflect any changes to the affected components.
Approval is generally required for transition and closure of an individual program component. The review of any 
recommendation for the transition or closure of a program component generally includes:
u
u Confirming that the business case for the component has been sufficiently satisfied or that further pursuit of the 
component’s goals should be discontinued,
u
u Ensuring appropriate program-level communications of the component’s closure to key stakeholders,
u
u Ensuring component compliance with program-level quality control plans (when required),
u
u Assessing organizational- or program-level lessons learned as a consequence of performance of the component 
in transition, and
u
u Confirming that all other accepted practices for project or program transition or closure have been satisfied.

78	
Section 6
6.1.12 PROGRAM CLOSURE
The program steering committee reviews and makes decisions on recommendations for the closure of programs. It 
assesses whether conditions warranting the program are satisfied, and that recommendations for closure of a program 
are consistent with the current organizational vision, mission, and strategy. Alternatively, programs may be terminated 
because changes in the organizational strategy or environment have resulted in diminished program benefits or needs. 
Regardless of the cause for termination, closure procedures should be implemented. Practices and processes commonly 
used to conduct program closure are described in detail in Section 7.1.4.
At program closure, the importance of effectively transitioning the program governance to operational governance 
will directly impact the benefits realized (see Section 4.4). The final program report is approved by the governance 
participants during closure.
6.2 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE ROLES
Establishing an appropriate collaborative relationship between individuals responsible for program governance and 
program management is critical to the success of programs in delivering the benefits desired by the organization. 
Program managers rely on the program steering committee (also referred to as the program governance board, oversight 
committee, or board of directors) members to establish organizational conditions that enable the effective pursuit of 
programs and to resolve issues that inevitably arise when the needs of their program conflict with the needs of other 
programs, projects, or ongoing operational activities.
Establishing a collaborative relationship between the program steering committee and program managers is also 
critical to the success of the organization. In accordance with the program charter, program managers assume 
responsibility and accountability for effectively managing programs in the pursuit of organizational goals as authorized 
by the program steering committee.
Program governance structures are best defined in a manner that is specific to the needs of each organization and 
the requirements of the program. A comprehensive program governance model carefully considers the program and 
the organizational context in which it is pursued. However, within organizations, the relationship between the program 
governance and program management functions is often managed by assigning key roles to individuals who are part of 
those functions and who are recognized as important stakeholders. More details on the factors considered in designing 
the Program Governance Performance Domain are provided in Section 6.3.

79
While the design, participants, and roles fulfilling the program governance roles will be specific to the program within 
an organization, the following roles are commonly used:
u
u Program sponsor. An individual or a group that provides resources and support for the program and is 
accountable for enabling success.
u
u Program steering committee. A group of participants representing various program-related interests with the 
purpose of supporting the program under its authority by providing guidance, endorsements, and approvals 
through the governance practices. Members are typically executives from organizational groups that support the 
program’s components and operations.
u
u Program management office (PMO). A management structure that standardizes the program-related 
governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques.
u
u Program manager. The individual within an agency, organization, or corporation who maintains responsibility for 
the leadership, conduct, and performance of a program. In the context of governance, this role interfaces with the 
program steering committee and sponsor and manages the program to ensure delivery of the intended benefits.
u
u Project manager. The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for 
achieving project objectives. In the context of governance, this role interfaces with the program manager and 
program sponsor and manages the delivery of the project’s product, service, or result.
u
u Other stakeholders. These stakeholders include the manager of the portfolio of which the program is a 
component and operational managers receiving the capabilities delivered by the program.
The responsibilities assigned to each of the following roles are for guidance only. Carrying out the activities of the 
Program Governance Performance Domain will fulfill these responsibilities and the allocation between roles is often 
dependent on several design factors (see Section 6.3).

80	
Section 6
6.2.1 PROGRAM SPONSOR
The program sponsor is the individual responsible for committing the application of organizational resources to 
the program and for program success. The program sponsor role is frequently filled by an executive member of the 
program steering committee who has a senior role in directing the organization and its investment decisions, and who 
is personally vested in the success of related organizational programs. In many organizations, the program sponsor acts 
as the chairperson of the program steering committee and assigns and oversees the progress of the program manager.
Typical responsibilities of the program sponsor are to:
u
u Secure funding for the program and ensure program goals and objectives are aligned with the strategic vision;
u
u Enable the delivery of benefits; and
u
u Remove barriers and obstacles to program success.
As a member or chair of the program steering committee, the sponsor is integral to its responsibilities. It is critical 
that the organization selects an appropriate program sponsor and then allows him or her to perform the role effectively. 
Sufficient time and resources should be provided to enable success, which often requires relief from other management 
and executive duties.
The caliber, experience, and availability of the sponsor impacts the effectiveness of the program and, in some cases, 
is the difference between perceived success and failure. Very often, the program sponsor is required to drive changes 
through the organization so that operations can accommodate capabilities delivered by the program, and to secure 
the available positive benefits and steward the handling of negative benefits. As such, the sponsor is integral to the 
communication and stakeholder processes. Typically, an effective sponsor exhibits the following attributes:
u
u Ability to influence stakeholders,
u
u Ability to work across different stakeholder groups to find mutually beneficial solutions,
u
u Leadership,
u
u Decision-making authority, and
u
u Effective communication skills.

81
6.2.2 PROGRAM STEERING COMMITTEE
Most organizations seek to ensure appropriate program governance by establishing program steering committees 
that are responsible for defining and implementing appropriate governance practices. Program steering committees 
are usually staffed by individuals who are either individually or collectively recognized as having organizational insight 
and decision-making authority that is critical to the establishment of program goals, strategy, and operational plans. 
Program steering committees are usually composed of executive-level stakeholders who have been selected for their 
strategic insight, technical knowledge, functional responsibilities, operational accountabilities, responsibilities for 
managing the organization’s portfolio, and abilities to represent important stakeholder groups. Often, program steering 
committees include senior leaders from the functional groups responsible for supporting significant elements of the 
program, including, for example, the organizational executives and leaders responsible for supporting the program’s 
components. Program steering committees, staffed in this way, improve the likelihood that the activities described in 
the Program Governance Performance Domain will be well positioned to efficiently address issues or questions that 
may arise during the performance of the program. Program steering committees ensure that programs are pursued 
in an environment with appropriate organizational knowledge and expertise, well supported by cohesive policies and 
processes, and empowered by their access to those with decision-making authority.
Typical responsibilities include:
u
u Provide governance support for the program to include oversight, control, integration, and decision-making 
functions;
u
u Provide capable governance resources to oversee and monitor program uncertainty and complexity related to 
achieving benefits delivery;
u
u Ensure program goals and planned benefits align with organizational strategic and operational goals;
u
u Conduct planning sessions to confirm, prioritize, and fund the program;
u
u Endorse or approve program recommendations and changes;
u
u Resolve and remediate escalated program issues and risks;
u
u Provide oversight and monitoring so program benefits are planned, measured, and achieved;
u
u Provide leadership in making, enforcing, carrying out, and communicating decisions;
u
u Define key messages that are to be communicated to stakeholders and ensure they are consistent and transparent;
u
u Review expected benefits and benefits delivery; and
u
u Approve program closure or termination.

82	
Section 6
In small organizations, a single senior executive may assume the responsibilities of a program oversight committee.
Establishing a single committee that maintains and is accountable for all critical elements of program oversight 
within an organization is considered to be the most efficient means for providing effective and adaptive governance 
oversight. However, under certain circumstances, some programs may need to report to multiple steering committees; 
for example, programs that are sponsored and overseen jointly by private and governmental organizations, programs 
managed as collaborations between private but otherwise competitive organizations, or programs in exceedingly 
complex environments whose subject matter experts cannot be effectively assembled into a single program steering 
committee. Under these circumstances, it is critical that the systems and methods for program governance and the 
authority for program decision making be clearly established in the program governance plan.
6.2.3 THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OFFICE
The program management office (PMO) facilitates the governance practices. It is a management structure that 
standardizes the program-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, 
and techniques. It provides professional expertise using staff highly trained in applying program governance practices 
to provide oversight, support, and decision-making capability to the program. The PMO role may extend to monitoring 
compliance to program management practices.
The design and formation of a PMO is tailored to its environment. For example, organizations pursuing exceptionally 
large, complicated, or complex programs may establish multiple PMOs, each of which may be dedicated solely to the 
conduct of one or more critical organizational programs.
Alternatively, organizations pursuing multiple programs often seek to ensure a high level of consistency and 
professionalism in the management and governance of their programs by creating a PMO as a formal center of 
excellence in program governance practices that services a portfolio of different programs. For any program, the PMO 
may be created or may leverage an existing function. Depending on the context of the program, individuals with specific 
skills, such as change and benefits management specialists can be allocated to the PMO.
On occasion, the functions of a PMO may be delegated to an individual manager with an exceptional understanding 
of program management and governance practices, or directly to the individual program managers responsible for 
oversight of the organization’s programs. See Section 1.9 for more information on the PMO.

83
6.2.4 PROGRAM MANAGER
The program manager is the individual responsible for management and oversight of the program’s interactions with 
the program governance function.
The program manager is granted authority to make decisions on behalf of the program steering committee. For 
decisions outside of this agreed-upon authority, it is necessary for the program manager to secure authorization from 
the program steering committee. A number of factors may influence the authority granted to the program team, including 
the experience of the program manager, the size and complexity of the program and its components, and the degree of 
coordination required to manage the program within the context of the larger organization.
The program manager ensures that the program goals and objectives remain aligned with the overall strategic 
objectives of the organization. Typical governance-related responsibilities include:
u
u Assess the governance framework, including organizational structure, policies, and procedures, and, in some 
cases, establish the program governance framework;
u
u Oversee program conformance to governance policies and processes;
u
u Manage program interactions with the steering committee and sponsor;
u
u Manage interdependencies between components within the program;
u
u Monitor and manage program risks, performance, and communications;
u
u Manage program risks and issues and escalate critical risks and issues beyond the program manager’s control 
to the steering committee;
u
u Monitor and report on overall program funding and health;
u
u Assess program outcomes and request authorization from the steering committee to change overall program 
strategies;
u
u Create, monitor, and communicate the program integrated roadmap and key internal and external dependencies; 
and
u
u Manage, monitor, and track overall program benefits realization.

84	
Section 6
Program goals are pursued and benefits are delivered by means of the authorization and initiation of components. The 
authorization of components under the direction of a parent program is conceptually the same as the authorization of the 
parent program itself by its program steering committee. Thus, programs have a function similar to that of a governance 
board. Program managers and program teams may become responsible for a governance function that is often referred 
to as component governance. In this role, program managers are responsible for defining the framework, functions, and 
processes by which their program’s components will be monitored and managed. The degree of autonomy granted to 
program managers for oversight of their components, and the mechanisms provided by parent programs, differs among 
organizations and (at times) among programs being managed within a single organization. While some organizations 
choose to have components governed by the same program governance structure described for a parent program, 
others allow the parent program to assume independent responsibility for governance of program components. Under 
such circumstances, a program manager may assume responsibility for establishing a governing framework to manage 
components within the parent program.
See Section 1.7 for more information on the role of the program manager.
6.2.5 PROJECT MANAGER(S)
In the context of a program, the project manager role generally refers to an individual responsible for oversight or 
management of a project that is being pursued as a component of the program. In this context, the project manager 
responsibilities are defined in the PMBOK® Guide. They include effective planning, performing, and tracking of a 
program’s component project(s), and delivery of the project’s outputs as defined in the project’s charter and in the 
program management plan. In this capacity, the project manager is subject to component governance oversight by 
the program manager (acting in a role analogous to that of the program steering committee) and to the program team. 
While the role is not always central to program governance, the typical governance-related responsibilities of a project 
manager include:
u
u Manage project interactions with the program manager, steering committee, and sponsor;
u
u Oversee project conformance to governance policies and processes;
u
u Monitor and manage performance and communications;
u
u Manage project risks and issues and escalate critical risks and issues beyond the project manager’s control to 
the program manager, sponsor, or steering committee of the project;
u
u Manage internal and external dependencies for the project; and
u
u Foster engagement of key stakeholders.

85
6.2.6 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS
Several other stakeholders may have program governance related roles. The portfolio manager may have a role in 
ensuring that a program is selected, prioritized, and staffed according to the organization’s plan for realizing desired 
benefits.
As the program progresses, representatives of the business, such as functional representatives and product owners 
ensure that the program’s direction is aligned to the end customers’ potentially evolving requirements.
When the program delivers a capability to the organization, the expected or potential benefits can only be realized 
when the organization is prepared to integrate the capability into its operations. The operational manager is generally 
responsible for receiving and integrating the capabilities delivered by other program components for achieving desired 
organizational benefits. This integration initially often leads to disruption and, over the longer term, a steady state that is 
different from the previous environment. It is therefore important to the success of the organization and program that the 
capability is integrated effectively. The operational manager is supported by individual(s) assigned the role to manage 
this change. Such individuals can be the sponsor, representative(s) from the receiving business area, program manager, 
project manager, and in many cases a specialist in managing business change. This role has governance implications 
as it informs and performs the governance practices described in Section 6.1. Typically, the individual in this role will 
be supported by a team from the corresponding business area.
Other governance-associated roles include specialists in certain aspects of the domain, including risk specialists, 
buyers, and contracting experts to develop and govern agreements with third-party vendors.
6.3 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Program governance begins with the identification of governance participants and the establishment of governance 
practices. There is also a need to define the specific expectations for how governance-related roles are filled and 
responsibilities discharged. Governance practices may differ depending on the sector or industry that the organization 
serves. Governance of programs in such diverse fields as national or local government, aerospace and defense, banking 
and financing, and pharmaceutical development may have remarkably different needs based on the unique political, 
regulatory, legal, technical, and competitive environments in which they operate. In each case, however, a sponsor 
organization seeks to implement governance practices that enable the organization to monitor the program’s support 
of the organizational strategy.
Effective governance ensures that strategic alignment is optimized and that the program’s targeted benefits are 
delivered as expected. Governance participants also confirm that all stakeholders are appropriately engaged and that 
appropriate supportive tools and processes are defined and effectively leveraged. Governance practices provide the 
foundation for ensuring that decisions are made rationally and with appropriate justification, and that the responsibilities 
and accountabilities are clearly defined and applied. All of these activities are accomplished within the policies and 
standards of the host and partner organizations and are measured to attain compliance.

86	
Section 6
The design of program governance can have a significant influence on the success of the program. In extreme 
cases, inappropriate governance may create more problems than its absence as it can engender a false sense of 
alignment, progress, and success. There are many factors to consider when designing the program governance rules 
and framework. Common factors to consider when optimizing and tailoring program governance include:
u
u Legislative environment. Programs that are significantly influenced by changing legislation may benefit from 
governance designed for direct interaction with the legislative authorities. In other cases, the interaction is 
performed by elements of corporate governance on behalf of the program.
u
u Decision-making hierarchy. It is critical for decision-making responsibility to be at the level where competence, 
accountability, and authority reside. There are complexities to this approach. For example, in organizations 
where employees are not ultimately accountable for their actions or not made to feel accountable for their 
actions, there is a greater need for controlling practices. In other circumstances, a highly regarded, successful, 
and experienced program manager and team may be given greater autonomy and decision-making powers than 
is typically given to program managers.
u
u Optimized governance. Generally it makes sense for the size of the program governance to be optimized and to 
be as streamlined as possible, while still able to perform the practices of the domain. This will lead to role clarity, 
effective and targeted support from the organization, and ultimately more rapid and effective decision making, 
endorsements, and approvals. Program governance should not duplicate program management activity.
u
u Alignment with portfolio and organizational governance. Program governance is impacted by the portfolio 
governance that it supports. The degree to which program governance should align with organizational 
governance is based on the number, type, and relative importance of the program governance’s interactions with 
corporate groups and governance. Typically, the need for alignment with organizational governance is greatest in 
the program definition stage as the program governance and the program itself are being formulated.
u
u Program delivery. A program that regularly delivers benefits to the organization is likely to require different 
governance than a program delivering all or most of the benefits at the end. Regular delivery of benefits potentially 
requires constant change in the operations of the organization and the governance to manage this change is 
critical throughout the life cycle.
u
u Contracting. A program being managed and staffed by employees of the receiving organization is likely to 
require a different level of governance than a program being delivered by an external party when, in such cases, 
the management of the legal agreement requires a different governance focus.
u
u Risk of failure. The greater the perceived risk of program failure, the greater the likelihood the governance team 
will monitor progress and success more diligently. This may manifest in a higher frequency of health checks and 
less decision-making delegation to the program team.

87
u
u Strategic importance. High-value programs critical to the success of the organization and delivering benefits 
that need to be completely aligned with the strategy may require different or more senior participants on the 
governance team.
u
u Program management office (PMO). In many project- or program-based organizations, a centralized PMO 
supports the governance of all programs for that organization. In other organizations, PMOs may be formed 
specifically for a given program.
u
u Program funding structure. When funding is secured from outside the delivery organization, for example from 
the World Bank, there are likely implications on the design of the governance and the skills required.
In addition to these factors, the phase of the life cycle also influences program governance, because the relative 
importance of different governance practices differs as the program progresses. The corresponding design of the 
governance should align with required practices in a timely manner.
As a result of the factors described in Section 6.3, there are many considerations to account for in the optimization of 
program governance. Once program governance is designed and implemented, it is important to exercise mechanisms 
to assess its effectiveness and to continually improve and optimize it.
For a broader discussion of program governance within the context of organizational, portfolio, and project governance, 
see Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [7].

PROGRAM LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT
Program Life Cycle Management is the performance domain that manages program activities required to facilitate 
effective program definition, program delivery, and program closure.
This section includes:
7.1	 The Program Life Cycle
7.2	 Program Activities and Integration Management
In order to ensure the realization of benefits, programs provide the necessary alignment of the organization’s 
strategic goals and objectives with the individual components. These components may include projects, subsidiary 
programs, and additional program-related activities that are necessary to achieve the specified goals and objectives. 
Since programs, by nature, involve a certain level of uncertainty, change, complexity, and interdependency among the 
various components, it is useful to establish a common and consistent set of processes that can be applied across 
phases. These discrete phases, which may sometimes overlap, constitute the program life cycle. Program Life Cycle 
Management spans the duration of the program, during which it contributes to and integrates with the other program 
domains as well as the supporting program activities.
7.1 THE PROGRAM LIFE CYCLE
Programs function similarly to projects in that the program is defined, benefits are delivered, and the program is 
closed. However, unlike projects, programs involve the coordination and sequencing of multiple components above 
what is required at an individual project level. The activities executed within the program life cycle are dependent on 
the specific type of program and typically begin before funding is approved or when the program manager is assigned. 
There is often considerable effort expended prior to defining and approving a program. See Sections 3 and 6 for more 
information on Program Strategy Alignment and Program Governance.

90	
Section 7
During program delivery, components are authorized, planned, and executed, and benefits are delivered. Program 
closure is then approved by the program steering committee when the desired benefits or program objectives have been 
realized or the steering committee has determined that the program should be terminated. Reasons for early termination 
may be a change in organizational strategy with which the program is no longer aligned or an assessment that the 
planned benefits may no longer be achievable.
7.1.1 PROGRAM LIFE CYCLE PHASES OVERVIEW
Programs often span long durations—multiple years and, in some cases, decades. Regardless of duration, all 
programs follow a similar trajectory.
To successfully deliver benefits to an organization, programs are implemented using three major phases, 
which include:
u
u Program Definition Phase. This phase consists of program activities conducted to authorize the program and 
develop the program roadmap required to achieve the expected results. As part of program definition, the program 
business case and program charter are formulated. Once approved, the program management plan is prepared.
u
u Program Delivery Phase. Program delivery comprises the program activities performed to produce the intended 
results of each component in accordance with the program management plan. Throughout this phase, individual 
components are initiated, planned, executed, transitioned, and closed, while benefits are delivered, transitioned, 
and sustained.
u
u Program Closure Phase. This phase includes the program activities necessary to transition the program benefits 
to the sustaining organization and formally close the program in a controlled manner. During program closure, 
the program is transitioned and closed or terminated early, or work is transitioned to another program.
Figure 7-1 shows the phases that compose the program life cycle. These phases are further explained in Sections 
7.1.2 through 7.1.4.

91
Figure 7-1. Program Life Cycle Phases
7.1.2 PROGRAM DEFINITION PHASE
The program definition phase includes program activities conducted to authorize the program and develop the 
program roadmap required to achieve the expected results; it typically includes activities that are performed as the 
result of an organization’s plan to fulfill strategic objectives or achieve a desired state within an organization’s portfolio. 
There may be a number of activities executed by a portfolio management body prior to the start of the program definition 
phase. The portfolio management activity develops concepts (for products, services, or organizational outcomes), scope 
frameworks, initial requirements, timelines, deliverables, and acceptable cost guidelines.
The primary purpose of the program definition phase is to progressively elaborate the goals and objectives to be 
addressed by the program, define the expected program outcomes and benefits, and seek approval for the program. 
Program definition generally falls into two distinct but overlapping subphases: program formulation and program 
planning. The program manager is selected and assigned during program formulation.
Component Transition and Closure
Program Definition
Program Delivery
Organizational Strategy
Delivered
Value
Program Formulation
Program Planning
Component Authorization and Planning 
Component Oversight and Integration
Program Closure

92	
Section 7
7.1.2.1 PROGRAM FORMULATION
Program formulation involves the development of the program business case which states the overall expected 
benefits to be addressed by the program in support of the strategic initiatives. During this subphase, the sponsoring 
organization also assigns a program sponsor to oversee and govern the program. The sponsor’s key responsibilities 
include securing financing for the program and selecting the program manager who is responsible for conducting and 
managing the program. The assignment of the program manager and the definition of his or her roles, responsibilities, 
and organizational interfaces should be performed as early as possible, as this individual effectively guides the program 
formulation activity and facilitates the development of the required outputs. To demonstrate how the program will 
deliver the desired organizational benefits, the sponsor, sponsoring organization, and the program manager work 
closely together to:
u
u Initiate studies and estimates of scope, resources, and cost;
u
u Develop an initial risk assessment; and
u
u Develop a program charter and roadmap.
Studies of scope, resources, and cost are also performed to assess the organization’s ability to deliver the program. 
At this time, the candidate program is compared with other organizational initiatives to determine the priority of the 
program under consideration. This information serves as critical input into the creation of the business case, if it was not 
developed by the portfolio management function. When the business case was developed prior to program formulation, 
it is revised and updated accordingly. Additionally, an initial risk assessment is conducted to analyze threats and 
opportunities. This analysis helps determine the probability of the program’s successful delivery of organizational 
benefits and helps identify risk response strategies and plans. See Section 8 for additional information on program risks.
The program charter serves as the primary document that is reviewed by the program steering committee to decide 
if the program will be authorized. Approval of the charter formally authorizes the commencement of the program, 
provides the program manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to program activities, and connects 
the program to the organization’s ongoing work and strategic priorities. If the program is not authorized, this information 
should be recorded and captured in a lessons learned repository.

93
The contents of the program charter generally consist of the following questions and their answers:
u
u Justification. Why is the program important and what does it achieve?
u
u Vision. What is the end state and how will it benefit the organization?
u
u Strategic alignment. What are the key strategic drivers and the program’s relationship to the organizational 
strategic objectives and any other ongoing strategic initiatives? (See Section 3 for more information on Program 
Strategy Alignment.)
u
u Benefits. What are the key outcomes required to achieve the program vision and benefits?
u
u Scope. What is included within the program and what is considered to be out of scope at a high level?
u
u Benefit strategy. What is the approach to ensure the realization of the planned benefits? (See Section 4 for more 
information on Program Benefits Management.)
u
u Assumptions and constraints. What are the assumptions, constraints, dependencies, and external factors 
considered and how have they shaped or limited the program’s objectives?
u
u Components. How are the projects and other program components configured to deliver the program and the 
intended benefits?
u
u Risks and issues. What are the initial risks and issues identified during the preparation of the program roadmap?
u
u Timeline. What is the total length of the program, including all key milestone dates?
u
u Resources needed. What are the estimated program costs and resource needs (i.e., staff, training, travel, etc.)?
u
u Stakeholder considerations. Who are the key stakeholders, who are the most important stakeholders, and what 
is the initial strategy to engage them? This information contributes to the development of the communications 
management plan. (See Section 5 for more information on Program Stakeholder Engagement.)
u
u Program governance. What is the recommended governance structure to manage, control, and support the 
program? What are the recommended governance structures to guide and oversee the program components, 
including reporting requirements? What authority does the program manager possess? This information is 
updated in the program governance plan. (See Section 6 for more information on Program Governance.)
The outputs of program formulation may continue to be updated throughout the program definition phase as business 
results are measured and the planned outcomes become more defined.

94	
Section 7
7.1.2.2 PROGRAM PLANNING
Program planning commences upon formal approval of the program charter by the program steering committee. In 
this phase, a governance structure is established, the initial program organization is defined, and a team is assembled to 
develop the program management plan. The program management plan is the document that integrates the program’s 
subsidiary plans and establishes the management controls and overall plan for integrating and managing the program’s 
individual components. These controls measure performance against the program management plan using information 
that is collected and consolidated from the constituent projects. Its main purpose is to ensure the program is continually 
aligned with the strategic priorities of the organization in order to deliver the expected benefits. The program management 
plan is developed based on the organization’s strategic plan, business case, program charter, roadmap, and any other 
outputs from program formulation.
This plan is the key output created during program planning and may be combined into one plan or multiple plans 
that include the following subsidiary documents:
u
u Benefits management plan (see Section 4.2.1),
u
u Stakeholder engagement plan (see Section 5.3),
u
u Governance plan (see Section 6.1.1),
u
u Change management plan (see Section 8.1.2.1),
u
u Communications management plan (see Section 8.1.2.2),
u
u Financial management plan (see Section 8.1.2.5),
u
u Information management plan (see Section 8.1.2.6),
u
u Procurement management plan (see Section 8.1.2.7),
u
u Quality management plan (see Section 8.1.2.8),
u
u Resource management plan (see Section 8.1.2.9),
u
u Risk management plan (see Section 8.1.2.10),
u
u Schedule management plan (see Section 8.1.2.11),
u
u Scope management plan (see Section 8.1.2.12), and
u
u Program roadmap (see Section 3.3).

95
Once the program management plan has been approved, the program delivery phase can begin. However, it is important 
to remember that development of this plan is an iterative activity since it is prepared early in the program life cycle and 
conflicting priorities, assumptions, and constraints may arise due to changes in critical factors, such as business goals, 
deliverables, benefits, time, and cost. To address these factors, updates and revisions to the program management plan 
and its subsidiary plans are approved or rejected through the Program Governance Performance Domain.
The program delivery phase begins after the program management plan is reviewed and formally approved. Programs 
are typically authorized by a program steering committee.
7.1.3 PROGRAM DELIVERY PHASE
The program delivery phase includes program activities performed to produce the intended results of each 
component in accordance with the program management plan. This phase is considered iterative instead of linear, 
as the capabilities produced by each component are integrated into the overall program to facilitate delivery of the 
intended program benefits. The program management team provides oversight and support to position the components 
for successful completion. The component work and activities are integrated under the program umbrella to facilitate 
the management and delivery of program benefits. The work in this phase includes the program and execution of 
the program components. Component management plans (covering cost management, scope management, schedule 
management, risk management, resource management, etc.) are developed at the component level (component-level 
work) and integrated at the program level (integrative work) to maintain alignment with the program direction to deliver 
the program benefits. Interactions with components to accomplish goals, manage changes, and mitigate risks and 
issues are managed through the program in order to position the program for success.
Programs often have a significant level of uncertainty. While the program management plan and program roadmap 
may document the intended direction and benefits of the program, the full suite of program components may not be 
known in the program definition phase. To accommodate this uncertainty, the program manager needs to continually 
oversee the components throughout this phase and, when necessary, replan for their proper integration or realign to 
accommodate changes in program direction through adaptive change. The program manager is also responsible for 
managing this group of components in a consistent and coordinated way in order to achieve results that could not be 
obtained by managing the components as stand-alone efforts. Each program component will progress through the 
following program delivery subphases:
u
u Component authorization and planning,
u
u Component oversight and integration, and
u
u Component transition and closure.
Program delivery ends when program governance determines that the specific criteria for this phase have been 
satisfied or a decision is made to terminate the program.

96	
Section 7
7.1.3.1 COMPONENT AUTHORIZATION AND PLANNING
Component authorization involves the initiation of components based on the organization’s specified criteria 
and individual business cases developed for each component. These criteria are generally included in the program 
governance plan. The Program Governance Performance Domain provides guidance for processes leading to component 
authorization. A number of activities are required to verify that a component properly supports the program’s outcomes 
and aligns with the strategy and ongoing work of the organization prior to authorization. These activities may include 
performing a needs analysis, conducting a feasibility study, or creating a plan to ensure the projects realize their 
intended benefits. See Section 6 for more information on Program Governance.
Component planning is performed throughout the duration of the program delivery phase in response to events 
that require significant replanning or new component initiation requests (submitted by the requesting component). 
Component planning includes the activities needed to integrate the component into the program to position each 
component for successful execution. These activities involve formalizing the scope of the work to be accomplished by 
the component and identifying the deliverables that will satisfy the program’s goals and benefits.
Each component has associated management plans. These may include a project management plan, transition plan, 
operations plan, maintenance plan, or other type of plan depending upon the type of work under consideration. The 
appropriate information from each component plan is integrated into the associated program management plan. This 
includes information used by the program to help manage and oversee the overall program’s progress.
7.1.3.2 COMPONENT OVERSIGHT AND INTEGRATION
In the context of a program, some components may produce benefits as individual components, while other 
components are integrated with others before the associated benefits may be realized. Each component team executes 
its associated plans and program integrative work. Throughout this activity, components provide status and other 
information to the program manager and to their associated components so their efforts may be integrated into and 
coordinated with the overall program activities. There may be cases where the program manager may initiate a new 
component to consolidate the integration efforts of multiple components. Without this step, individual components may 
produce deliverables; however, the benefits may not be realized without the coordinated delivery.

97
7.1.3.3 COMPONENT TRANSITION AND CLOSURE
After the program components have produced deliverables and coordinated the successful delivery of their products, 
services, or results, these components are typically scheduled for closure or transition to operations or ongoing work. 
Component transition addresses the need for ongoing activities such as product support, service management, change 
management, user engagement, or customer support from a program component to an operational support function 
in order for the ongoing benefits to be achieved. The criteria for performing these activities and the organizational 
expectations are documented in the governance plan.
Prior to the end of the program delivery phase, all component areas are reviewed to verify that the benefits were 
delivered and to transition any remaining projects and sustaining activities. The final status is reviewed with the program 
sponsor and program steering committee before the authorizing formal program closure.
7.1.4 PROGRAM CLOSURE PHASE
The program closure phase includes program activities necessary to transition program benefits to the sustaining 
organization and formally close the program in a controlled manner. During program transition, the program steering 
committee is consulted to determine whether: (a) the program has met all of the desired benefits and that all transition 
work has been performed within the component transition, or (b) there is another program or sustaining activity that 
will oversee the ongoing benefits for which this program was chartered. In the second instance, there may be work 
required to transition the resources, responsibilities, knowledge, and lessons learned to another sustaining entity. Once 
the transitioning activities are completed, the program manager receives approval from the sponsoring organization to 
formally close the program. During this closure phase, specific activities are performed, which are described in detail 
in Section 7.2.2.5.

Section 7
7.2 PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
As defined in Section 1, program management refers to the alignment of various components, such as projects and 
other programs, to achieve the planned program goals. The practices applied during this process are used to optimize 
or integrate the costs, schedules, and effort of the individual components to gain control and deliver maximum benefits 
at the program level instead of the component level.
Program activities and integration management are concerned with collectively utilizing the resources, knowledge, 
and skills available to effectively deploy multiple components throughout the program life cycle. This process also 
involves making decisions regarding:
u
u Competing demands and priorities,
u
u Risks,
u
u Resource allocations,
u
u Changes due to uncertainty and complexity of the program scope,
u
u Interdependencies among components, and
u
u Coordination of work to meet the program objectives.
Program activities and integration management are more cyclical and iterative in nature as adjustments may be 
required based on the actual outcomes and benefits produced to realign the program with the strategic priorities.
7.2.1 PROGRAM ACTIVITIES OVERVIEW
All work performed in a program for the purpose of overall program management is collectively known as program 
activities. Typically, program activities are interdependent and complementary since the deliverables produced from 
one particular activity may be necessary to perform another activity. The names and descriptions of these activities 
may appear to be similar to those of project activities or processes; however, their content, scope, and complexity 
are different. For example, project risk management activities focus on risks to project execution and success, while 
program risk management incorporates escalated project risks and program risks and also monitors interdependencies 
that affect multiple component projects.
The processes and tools used in project-level activities can be found in the latest edition of the PMBOK® Guide. The 
corresponding program activities encompass a greater number of inputs and typically broader scope. For example, results 
of the individual component project risk planning efforts provide input to the program risk planning effort. Risk control is 
performed continuously at both the component level and the program level itself; project-level risks may be escalated to 
the program level or may have a cumulative effect that requires the risks to be addressed at the program level.

99
It is important to note that program activities directly support the individual components to ensure the component 
activities help achieve the program objectives. The deliverables created at the project level that directly contribute 
to the program benefits and milestones achieved are monitored at the program level by the program manager to 
ensure consistency with the overall program strategy. Management of component-level activities is still handled by 
the project manager.
7.2.2 PROGRAM INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
Program integration management is the core activity that occurs across the entire program life cycle. It includes the 
activities needed to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate multiple components into the program. Throughout 
the program integration activities, there are numerous interactions with other program performance domains (see 
Section 2). This section focuses on the following activities and when they are performed throughout the program life 
cycle phases:
u
u Program infrastructure development (see Section 7.2.2.1),
u
u Program delivery management (see Section 7.2.2.2),
u
u Program performance monitoring and controlling (see Section 7.2.2.3),
u
u Benefits sustainment and program transition (see Section 7.2.2.4), and
u
u Program closeout (see Section 7.2.2.5).
7.2.2.1 PROGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
Program infrastructure development is performed to investigate, assess, and plan the support structure that will 
assist the program in achieving its goals. This activity is initiated in the program definition phase and may be repeated 
again at any time during the program life cycle in order to update or modify the infrastructure.
The primary purpose of program infrastructure development is twofold. It establishes both the management and 
technical resources of the program and its components. This infrastructure refers to both personnel and to program-
specific tools, facilities, and finances used to manage the program.
Although the program manager is assigned during program definition, the program management core team is 
designated as part of establishing the program infrastructure. The core team members may not necessarily be assigned 
full-time to the program; however, these key stakeholders are instrumental in determining and developing the program’s 
infrastructure requirements.

100	
Section 7
For many programs, the program management office (PMO) is a core part of the program infrastructure. It supports 
the management and coordination of the program and component work. The PMO also establishes consistent 
policy, standards, and training for programs in the organization. Another key element of the program infrastructure 
is the program management information system (PMIS). A PMIS consists of tools used to collect, integrate, and 
communicate information critical to the effective management of one or more organizational programs. An effective 
PMIS incorporates the following:
u
u Software tools;
u
u Documents, data, and knowledge repositories;
u
u Configuration management tools;
u
u Change management system;
u
u Risk database and analysis tools;
u
u Financial management systems;
u
u Earned value management activities and tools;
u
u Requirements management activities and tools; and
u
u Other tools and activities as required.
These resources are separate and distinct from the resources required to manage the individual components within 
the program. The distinguishing factor is that the majority of resources and program costs are managed at the component 
level instead of the program level.
7.2.2.2 PROGRAM DELIVERY MANAGEMENT
Program delivery management includes the management, oversight, integration, and optimization of the program 
components that will deliver the capabilities and benefits required for the organization to realize value. These activities 
are performed throughout the program delivery phase and relate to the initiation, change, transition, and closure of 
program components.
It is typically the role of the program manager to present a request to initiate a new component or project. This 
request is evaluated by the program steering committee against the organization’s approved selection criteria. A 
decision is made utilizing the governance function on whether the component should be initiated. If the component is 
approved, the program manager may need to redefine the priorities of existing program components to ensure optimal 
resource allocation and management of interdependencies. Component initiation may be delayed or accelerated as 
defined by the program team and its needs. During the course of program delivery, change requests that fall within the 
program manager’s authority level will be approved or rejected to manage performance and any changes to the program 
management plan.

101
As the program components reach the end of their respective life cycles or as planned program-level milestones are 
achieved, the program manager collaborates with the customer or sponsor to present a request to close or transition 
the component. This formal request is sent to the program steering committee for review and approval. The process of 
component transition includes making updates to the program roadmap. These updates reflect both go/no-go decisions 
and approved change requests that affect the high-level milestones, scope, or timing of major stages scheduled 
throughout the program.
7.2.2.3 PROGRAM PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
Monitoring and controlling activities are performed by both program- and project-level components during delivery 
management. These activities include collecting, measuring, and disseminating performance information to track 
progress against the program objectives and assess overall program trends. Continuous monitoring gives the program 
management team insight into the current health of the program and identifies areas that require special attention. 
Monitoring activities determine if and when controlling activities, such as corrective or preventive action, are needed to 
bring the program back in alignment with the strategic priorities.
Based on thresholds authorized by program governance, requests to execute corrective or preventive action, in 
addition to adaptive change, may be approved at the component or program level. When the requests exceed the 
established program-level thresholds, the requests are presented to the program steering committee for approval. 
Typical outputs of this ongoing activity include program performance reports and forecasts.
Program performance reports include a summary of the progress of all program components. They describe whether 
the program’s goals will be met and benefits will be successfully delivered according to plan. These reports generally 
provide current status information about what work has been accomplished (especially milestones and phase gates); 
what work remains to be completed; earned value; and risks, issues, and changes under consideration. Forecasts 
enable the program manager and other key stakeholders to assess the likelihood of achieving planned outcomes and to 
provide predictions of the program’s future state based on the current information and knowledge available.
7.2.2.4 BENEFITS SUSTAINMENT AND PROGRAM TRANSITION
Some program components produce immediate benefits while others require a handoff or transition to another 
organization in order for the ongoing benefit to be realized. Benefits sustainment may be achieved through operations, 
maintenance, new projects, or other initiatives and efforts. This activity transcends the scope of individual program 
components since this work is typically performed as the program is closed. During this subphase, the stewardship of 
sustaining the benefits may need to transition to another organization, entity, or subsequent program.

102	
Section 7
7.2.2.5 PROGRAM CLOSEOUT
A program is closed either because the program charter is fulfilled or internal/external conditions arise that bring the 
program to an early end. These conditions may include changes in the business case that no longer make the program 
necessary or a determination that the expected benefits cannot be achieved. During closeout, benefits may have 
been fully realized or they may continue to be realized and managed as part of organizational operations. Successful 
completion of the program is judged against the approved business case, actual program outcomes, and the current 
goals and strategic objectives of the organization. All components should be completed or canceled and all contracts 
should be formally closed before the program itself is closed. Once these criteria have been met, the program will 
receive formal closure acceptance from the program steering committee.
As part of the program governance plan, a final program report may be required to document critical information that 
can be applied to improve the success of future programs and component projects. This final report may consist of:
u
u Financial and performance assessments,
u
u Lessons learned,
u
u Successes and failures,
u
u Identified areas for improvement,
u
u Risk management outcomes,
u
u Unforeseen risks,
u
u Customer sign-off,
u
u Reason(s) for program closeout,
u
u History of all baselines, and
u
u Archive plan for program documentation.
Upon program completion, knowledge transfer is performed when the program management team assesses the 
program’s performance and shares lessons learned with the organization. The final program report may also be updated 
with this information. Lessons learned should be readily accessible to any existing or future program to facilitate 
continuous learning and avoid similar pitfalls encountered in other programs. This knowledge transfer also supplements 
benefits sustainment by providing the new supporting organization with any relevant documentation, training, or 
materials (see Sections 3.4.2.5 and 8.2.4.1 for more information).
It is important to ensure that program resources are appropriately released as the program is being closed. This may 
involve the reallocation or reassignment of team members and funding to other initiatives or programs. Reassignment 
of resources at the component level could include transitioning resources to another component already in execution 
or another program within the organization that requires a similar skill set. Refer to the PMBOK® Guide for more 
information regarding resource disposition for component projects.

103
7.2.3 MAPPING OF THE PROGRAM LIFE CYCLE TO PROGRAM ACTIVITIES
Table 7-1 maps the program management life cycle’s three major phases to the program supporting activities 
discussed in Section 8. Although these supporting activities occur throughout the program life cycle, each activity 
is mapped where most of the work takes place. Informal preplanning exercises may take place in earlier phases for 
each consideration.

PROGRAM ACTIVITIES
Program activities are tasks and work conducted to support a program and which contribute throughout the program 
life cycle.
This section includes:
8.1	 Program Definition Phase Activities
8.2	 Program Delivery Phase Activities
8.3	 Program Closure Phase Activities
Given the scope and complexity of a program, numerous supporting program activities are performed throughout 
the program life cycle. The definitions and terminology associated with these activities at the program level are very 
similar to those at the project level. However, program activities operate at a higher level, dealing with multiple projects 
and other programs, and addressing links between the program and the organizational strategy. While they may utilize 
component-level information, the activities generally integrate the information to reflect a program perspective.
The program activities that support program management and governance include:
u
u Program Change Management,
u
u Program Communications Management,
u
u Program Financial Management,
u
u Program Information Management,
u
u Program Procurement Management,
u
u Program Quality Management,
u
u Program Resource Management,
u
u Program Risk Management,
u
u Program Schedule Management, and
u
u Program Scope Management.
The program activities enable a strategic approach to planning, monitoring and controlling, and delivering program 
outputs and benefits. Program management supporting activities require coordination with functional groups in the 
organization—but in a broader context than similar activities supporting a single project.

106	
Section 8
8.1 PROGRAM DEFINITION PHASE ACTIVITIES
The program definition phase establishes and confirms the business case for the program and then develops the 
detailed plan for its delivery. This phase is divided into two parts: program formulation and program planning.
8.1.1 PROGRAM FORMULATION ACTIVITIES
In program formulation, the high-level scope, risks, costs, and expected benefits of the program are assessed to 
confirm that the program represents a viable way forward for the organization and is well aligned with the organization’s 
strategic objectives. Program activities supporting program formulation are often exploratory in nature, looking at a 
number of possible alternatives to ensure the one best aligned with strategy and organizational preferences can be 
identified and approved for inclusion into the program. However, in some cases, program formulation leads to the 
conclusion that the program does not have a strong business case and the program is stopped.
Figure 8-1 illustrates how program formulation activities contribute to the development of the program business case 
and program charter through the core activity of program integration management (see Section 7.2.2).

8.1.1.1 PROGRAM CHANGE ASSESSMENT
As part of program formulation, potential change management considerations are identified and assessed to help 
develop the program’s business case. The program change assessment identifies sources of change, such as the 
volatility of the enterprise environmental factors, the sensitivity of the proposed program’s business case to changes in 
organizational strategy, and the possible frequency and magnitude of changes that may arise from components during 
program delivery. It then estimates the likelihood and possible impacts of the changes that could arise from these 
sources and proposes measures that could be taken to enable the program to respond to such changes in a positive, 
rather than disruptive, way.
The output of this activity is the program change assessment, which is an input to the program business case, 
program charter, and program change management planning.
8.1.1.2 PROGRAM COMMUNICATIONS ASSESSMENT
Program Communications Management is different from project communications. Since it affects a wider array of 
stakeholders with widely varying communication needs, different communication approaches and methods of delivery 
are required.
An initial assessment of the communication needs of the program is a key input to the program charter. Given the 
broad scope of a program, a wide range of stakeholders may be involved, and maintaining effective communications 
with internal and external stakeholders can prevent more serious problems from arising. It may be useful as part of 
program formulation to survey program stakeholders to identify their expectations for its outcome and their interests in 
staying informed and involved during its delivery.
The output of this activity is the program communications assessment, which is an input to the stakeholder 
engagement plan and program communications management planning.
8.1.1.3 PROGRAM INITIAL COST ESTIMATION
A critical element of the program’s business case is an estimate of its overall cost and an assessment of the level of 
confidence in this estimate. An initial cost estimate is prepared in the program definition phase to determine the cost 
of its planning and delivery. This initial rough order-of-magnitude estimate allows financial decision makers to decide 
if the program should be funded. Because of the limited information, time, and resources available, it may be difficult 
to develop a highly detailed or accurate cost estimate. Often the numbers will only be accurate to a rough order of 
magnitude. Given these challenges, it can also be useful to identify the nature and sources of those costs that could not 
be estimated.
The output of this activity is the program initial cost estimate, which is an input to the program business case and the 
program charter and detailed program cost estimation during program planning.

108	
Section 8
8.1.1.4 PROGRAM INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT
A program will likely generate a large amount of documentation, data, and other records throughout its life cycle. How 
easily this information can be collected, shared, and maintained may have a significant effect on both program team 
efficiency and how the program is perceived by its stakeholders. The information management needs of the program 
should be considered as part of program formulation so that possible financial, organizational, or resource implications 
can be assessed.
The output of this activity is the program information management assessment, which is an input to the program 
business case, program charter, and program information management planning during program planning.
8.1.1.5 PROGRAM PROCUREMENT ASSESSMENT
An assessment of the procurement needs of a program can be a valuable input to the program charter. Although 
procurement policies and practices are typically part of the organizational or environmental factors that exist before 
the program is authorized, there are cases (e.g., programs involving public-private partnership or programs involving 
organizations or work in multiple countries) where the program itself presents unique procurement challenges. A 
program procurement assessment should be prepared during program definition when procurement presents special 
challenges or represents a significant level of effort during program delivery.
The output of this activity is the program procurement management assessment, which is an input to the program 
business case, program charter, and program procurement management planning during program planning.
8.1.1.6 PROGRAM QUALITY ASSESSMENT
An assessment of quality constraints, expectations, risks, and controls should be included as part of program 
formulation. Organizational or regulatory quality standards may act as important constraints on program delivery, 
particularly in the case of a compliance program. Expectations about the quality of program outputs may serve as 
important inputs to determine program costs and required program infrastructure and resources. The ability of program 
suppliers to comply with quality standards may also be an important consideration for the program procurement and 
risk assessments. Finally, the need for program quality reviews or audits may be considered important to enable 
program governance.
The output of this activity is the program quality assessment, which is an input to the program business case, 
program charter, and program quality management planning during program planning.

109
8.1.1.7 PROGRAM RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ESTIMATION
The resources required to plan and deliver a program include people, office space, laboratories, data centers or 
other facilities, equipment of all types, software, vehicles, and office supplies. An estimate of the required resources—
particularly staff and facilities, which may have long lead times or affect ongoing activities—is required to prepare the 
program business case and should be reflected in the program charter.
The output of this activity is the program resource requirements estimate, which is an input to the program business 
case, program charter, and program resource management planning during program planning.
8.1.1.8 PROGRAM INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT
A program risk is an event or series of events or conditions that, if they occur, may affect the success of the program. 
Positive risks are often referred to as opportunities and negative risks as threats. These risks arise from the program 
components and their interactions with each other, from technical complexity, schedule or cost constraints, and with 
the broader environment in which the program is managed.
Two aspects of risk should be assessed during program definition. First, an identification of the key risks that the 
program may encounter and their relative likelihood and impact should be developed as an input to the program 
business case and the program charter. Second, an assessment of the organization’s willingness to accept and deal 
with risks—sometimes referred to as its risk appetite—is essential in understanding the level of effort that may be 
required to monitor and assess risks during program delivery.
The output of this activity is the program initial risk assessment, which is an input to the program business case, 
the program initial cost estimate, the program charter, the program roadmap, and program risk management planning 
during program planning.
8.1.1.9 PROGRAM SCHEDULE ASSESSMENT
An assessment of expectations for delivery dates and benefits milestones should be part of the program charter. This 
initial assessment should also state the level of confidence in the assessment of activity durations and identify where 
alternative activities could be initiated if activities run into excessive delays.
The output of this activity is the program schedule assessment, which is an input to the program business case, the 
program charter, the program roadmap, and program schedule management planning during program planning.

110	
Section 8
8.1.1.10 PROGRAM SCOPE ASSESSMENT
Program scope defines the work required to deliver a benefit (major product, service, or result with specified features 
and functions) at the program level. Program scope management is the activities that define, develop, monitor, control, 
and verify program scope. Scope management aligns the program scope with the program’s goals and objectives. It 
includes work decomposition into deliverable component products designed to deliver the associated benefits.
An assessment of program scope, which includes boundaries, links to other programs/projects, and ongoing activities, 
is required as part of the program charter and to support initial cost, change, resource, risk, and schedule assessments.
This initial program scope assessment develops the program scope statement from the program goals and objectives. 
This input to the program charter can be obtained from the program sponsor or stakeholders through the portfolio 
management or stakeholder alignment activities.
The output of this activity is the program scope assessment, which is an input to the program charter.
8.1.2 PROGRAM PLANNING PHASE ACTIVITIES
In program planning, the program organization is defined, and an initial team is deployed to develop the program 
management plan. The program management plan is developed based on the organization’s strategic plan, business 
case, program charter, and the outputs from the assessments completed during program definition. The plan includes 
the roadmap of the program components and the management arrangements through which program delivery will 
be monitored and controlled. The plan should be open for changes, taking into consideration that the success of a 
program is not measured against its baseline but is measured by how an organization is able to realize benefits from 
the program outcomes. The program management plan is therefore a reference document and should be seen as a 
managed baseline.
Figure 8-2 illustrates how program planning activities support development of the program management plan through 
the core activity of program integration management.

Section 8
8.1.2.1 PROGRAM CHANGE MANAGEMENT PLANNING
A change management activity should be established to administer changes during the course of the program. 
The program change management plan is a component of the program management plan that establishes program 
change management principles and procedures, including the approach for capturing requested changes, evaluating 
each requested change, determining the disposition of each requested change, communicating a decision to impacted 
stakeholders, documenting the change request and supporting detail, and authorizing funding and work. It is important 
to mention that the plan should focus on how to evaluate the impact of a change (e.g., change in a component, change 
in the roadmap, change in a technology, etc.) to the program outcomes and therefore on the benefits expected by the 
stakeholders. Based on that assumption, the program steering committee should agree on the level of program change 
thresholds that should trigger the change process.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program change management plan, and
u
u Program change thresholds.
8.1.2.2 PROGRAM COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT PLANNING
The importance of managing communications internal and external to the program cannot be underestimated 
or overlooked. Program managers spend a significant amount of time and effort communicating with the program 
stakeholders, including the program team, component teams, component managers, customers, and program sponsor. 
Significant problems may occur if sufficient effort is not committed to communications. Program Communications 
Management includes the activities for the timely and appropriate generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, 
and ultimate disposition of program information. These activities provide the critical links between people and information 
that are necessary for successful communications and decision making.
Program communications management planning is the activity of determining the information and communication 
needs of the program stakeholders based on who needs what information, when they need it, how it will be given to 
them, and by whom. The program communications management plan is the component of the program management 
plan that describes how, when, and by whom information will be administered and disseminated. Communication 
requirements should be clearly defined to facilitate the transfer of information between the program and its components 
and from the program to the appropriate stakeholders with the appropriate content and delivery methods. Communication 
requirements specific to particular stakeholders should be included in the stakeholder register.

113
As the program progresses, other components are added and new stakeholders become known and addressed. This 
distinction should be considered when planning communications. Cultural and language differences, time zones, and other 
factors associated with globalization should be considered when developing the program communications management 
plan. Although complex, program communications management planning is vital to the success of any program.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program communications management plan, and
u
u Communication requirements inputs to the stakeholder register.
8.1.2.3 PROGRAM COST ESTIMATION
Program cost estimating is performed throughout the course of the program. Many organizations use a tiered funding 
process with a series of go/no-go decisions at each major stage of the program. They agree to an overall financial 
management plan and commit to a budget only for the next stage at each governance milestone.
A weight or probability may be applied based on the risk and complexity of the work to be performed in order to 
derive a confidence factor in the estimate. Statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation can also be used. 
This confidence factor is used to determine the potential range of program costs. When determining program costs, 
decision makers need to consider not only the development and implementation costs, but also sustainment costs that 
may occur after the program is completed. Calculating full life cycle costs and including transition and sustainment 
costs result in total cost of ownership. Total cost of ownership is considered to be relative to the expected benefit of 
one program against another to derive a funding decision. There are numerous estimating techniques to derive program 
cost estimates.
Program cost estimates should also identify any critical assumptions upon which the estimates are made, as these 
assumptions may prove unfounded in the course of program delivery and require reconsideration of the program 
business case or revision of the program management plan.
Finally, program cost estimation can support or guide cost estimation at the component level. Any prevailing program-
level cost estimation guidance intended for use at the component level should be documented and communicated to 
component managers.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program cost estimates,
u
u Program cost estimation assumptions, and
u
u Component cost estimation guidelines.

114	
Section 8
8.1.2.4 PROGRAM FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHMENT
The type of program and the funding structure dictate the financial environment for the duration of the program. 
Funding models vary, from those that are:
u
u Funded entirely within a single organization,
u
u Managed within a single organization but funded separately,
u
u Funded and managed entirely from outside the parent organization, and
u
u Supported with internal and external sources of funding.
Often the program itself may be funded by one or more sources, and the program components may be funded by 
altogether different sources. In addition to funding sources, the timing of funding has a direct impact on a program’s 
ability to perform. To a much greater extent than for projects, program costs occur earlier (often years earlier) than their 
related benefits. The objective of financing in program development is to obtain funds to bridge the gap between paying 
out monies for development and obtaining the benefits of the programs. Covering this large negative cash balance in 
the most effective manner is a key challenge in program financing. Due to the large amount of money involved in most 
programs, the funding organization is rarely a passive partner but instead has significant inputs to program management 
and to decisions made by the business leads, technical leads, and program manager. Due to this, communications with 
the program sponsor and other key stakeholders should be proactive and timely.
A program financial framework is a high-level initial plan for coordinating available funding, determining constraints, 
and determining how funding is allocated. The financial framework defines and describes the program funding flows so 
that the money is spent as efficiently as possible.
As the program financial framework is developed and analyzed, changes may be identified that impact the original 
business case justifying the program. Based on these changes, the business case is revised with full involvement of the 
decision makers (see Section 3.1).
It is important to understand the specific and unique needs of the program sponsor and the funding organizations’ 
representatives with regard to financial arrangements. The program communications management and stakeholder 
engagement plans may need updates to reflect these needs.

115
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program financial framework,
u
u Business case updates, and
u
u Updates to the program communications management and stakeholder engagement plans.
8.1.2.5 PROGRAM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Program financial management comprises the activities related to identifying the program’s financial sources and 
resources, integrating the budgets of the program components, developing the overall budget for the program, and 
controlling costs during the program. In this context, the program financial management plan is a component of the 
program management plan that documents all of the program’s financial aspects: funding schedules and milestones, 
initial budget, contract payments and schedules, financial reporting activities and mechanisms, and the financial metrics.
The program financial management plan expands upon the program financial framework and describes the 
management of items such as risk reserves, potential cash flow problems, international exchange rate fluctuations, 
future interest rate increases or decreases, inflation, currency devaluation, local laws regarding finances, trends in 
material costs, and contract incentive and penalty clauses. The plan should include an approval or authorization process 
to allocate funds for program components. For programs that are funded internally, either through retained earnings, 
bank loans, or the sale of bonds, the program manager should consider scheduled contract payments, inflation, the 
aforementioned factors, and other environmental factors. When developing the program financial management plan, the 
program manager should also include any component payment schedules, operational costs, and infrastructure costs.
Developing the program’s initial budget involves compiling all available financial information and listing all income 
and payment schedules in sufficient detail so that the program’s costs can be tracked as part of the program budget. 
Once baselined, the budget becomes the primary financial target that the program is measured against.
It is important to develop financial metrics by which the program’s benefits are measured. This is usually a 
challenge as cause-effect relationships are often difficult to establish in an endeavor the size and length of a program. 
One of the tasks of the program team and program steering committee is to establish and validate these financial 
performance indicators.
As changes to cost, schedule, and scope occur throughout the duration of the program, these metrics are measured 
against the initial metrics used to approve the program. Decisions to continue, cancel, or modify the program are based, 
in part, on the results of these financial measures. Program financial risks that are identified as part of the financial 
management plan should be incorporated into the program risk register.

8.1.2.6 PROGRAM INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PLANNING
The program information management plan is a component of the program management plan that describes how 
the program’s information assets will be prepared, collected, organized, and secured. It is often composed of (but not 
limited to) information management policies, distribution lists, appropriate tools, templates, and reporting formats. 
Such information will be gathered and retrieved through a variety of media including manual filing systems, electronic 
databases, project management software, and systems that allow access to technical documentation such as engineering 
drawings, design specifications, and test plans. Program information distribution methods are determined once the 
program’s information management system is determined. Information technology allows for rapid dissemination of 
large amounts of data to a large number of recipients, which requires careful planning and setup of the program’s 
information management system.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program information management plan, and
u
u Program information management tools and templates.
8.1.2.7 PROGRAM PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Program procurement management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques necessary to acquire 
products and services to meet the needs of the overall program and the constituent projects/components. Program 
procurement management planning addresses the activities necessary to acquire products and services and therefore 
the specific procurement needs that are unique to managing the overall program and the needs of the constituent 
components. The program procurement management plan is a component of the program management plan that 
describes how the program will acquire goods and services from outside of the performing organization.

117
A program manager should understand the resources required for the delivery of benefits expected of the program. 
Techniques such as make-or-buy decisions and program work-breakdown-structure charts aid in this activity. The 
program manager needs to be cognizant of the available funding and the needs of all components.
Early and intensive planning is critical for successful program procurement management. Through the planning 
activity, the program manager looks across all program components and develops a comprehensive plan that 
optimizes the procurements to meet program objectives and for the delivery of program benefits. To do this, program 
procurement management addresses commonality and differences for the various procurements across the program 
scope and determines:
u
u Whether some of the common needs of several individual components could best be met with one overall 
procurement rather than several separate procurement actions;
u
u The best mix of the types of procurement contracts planned across the program; at the component level, a 
particular type of contract (e.g., firm-fixed-price) may appear to be the best procurement solution, but a different 
contract type (e.g., incentive fee) may be optimal for that same procurement when viewed at the program level;
u
u The best program-wide approach to competition (for example, the risks of sole source contracts in one area of 
the program could be balanced with the different risks associated with full and open competition in other areas 
of the program);
u
u The best program-wide approach to balancing specific external regulatory mandates; for example, rather than 
setting aside a certain percentage of each contract in the program to meet a small-business mandate, it may be 
optimal to award one complete contract to achieve the same mandate.
Often, an analysis of alternatives is performed in the planning stage. This may include requests for information (RFIs), 
feasibility studies, trade studies, and market analysis to determine the best fit of solutions and services to meet the 
specific needs of the program.
Due to the inherent need to optimize program procurement management and the requirements to adhere to all legal 
and financial obligations, it is essential that all personnel responsible for procurement at the component level work 
closely together, especially during the planning phase.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program procurement standards,
u
u Program procurement management plan, and
u
u Program budget/financial plan updates.

Section 8
8.1.2.8 PROGRAM QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Program quality management planning identifies the organizational or regulatory quality standards that are relevant 
to the program as a whole and specifies how to satisfy them across the program. The program quality management 
plan is a component of the program management plan that describes how an organization’s quality policies will be 
implemented. Often within a program, there are many differing quality assurance requirements as well as differing test 
and quality control methods and activities. Program quality management is the activities of the performing organization 
that determine program quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the program will be successful. Program 
quality management aims to align these varying requirements and control methods, and may add additional ones to 
ensure overall program quality. It is good practice for the program manager to document the overall program’s quality 
objectives and principles in a quality policy that is shared with all program components.
Program management is responsible for the planning of the proper quality assurance criteria throughout the life cycle 
of the program, which may in fact exceed the timeline of the individual components. New quality control tools, activities, 
and techniques may be introduced into the program and employed when appropriate; for example, when new laws are 
enacted or new components are introduced during the program’s life cycle.
When initiating the program, the cost of the level of quality requirements should be evaluated and incorporated into 
the business plan. Quality is a variable cost in all components and should be considered as such in the program quality 
management plan. It is beneficial to analyze program quality in order to evaluate it across the program with the goal 
of combining quality tests and inspections in order to reduce costs, where feasible. If the tests are not coordinated, 
products and deliverables could be tested several times throughout a program and a cost incurred for no valid reason. 
It should be noted that the output of this activity is a quality management plan that provides the quality assurance 
measures and quality controls that are incorporated in the program and the methods of inspection based on the 
program scope.
Quality management should be considered when defining all program management activity as well as for every 
deliverable and service. For example, when developing a program resource management plan, it is recommended that 
a program quality manager participate in the planning activity to verify that quality activities and controls are applied 
and flow down to all the components, including those performed by subcontractors.

119
The output of this activity is a program quality management plan that may contain:
u
u Program quality policy;
u
u Program quality standards;
u
u Program quality estimates of costs;
u
u Quality metrics, service level agreements, or memorandums of understanding;
u
u Quality checklists; and
u
u Quality assurance and control specifications.
8.1.2.9 PROGRAM RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Resource management at the program level is different from resource management at the component level; a 
program manager needs to work within the bounds of uncertainty and balance the needs of the components for which 
he or she is responsible. Program resource management ensures all required resources (people, equipment, material, 
etc.) are made available to the component managers to enable the delivery of benefits for the program.
Resource management planning involves identifying existing resources and the need for additional resources. In the 
case of human resources, the sum of resources needed to successfully complete each component can be less than 
the total quantity of resources needed to complete the program because the resources can be reallocated between 
components as the components are completed. The program manager analyzes the availability of each resource, in 
terms of both capacity and capability, and determines how these resources will be allocated across components to 
avoid overcommitment or inadequate support. Historical information may be used to determine the types of resources 
that were required for similar projects and programs.
The resource management plan is a component of the program management plan that forecasts the expected level 
of resource use across the program components and relative to the program master schedule to allow the program 
manager to identify potential resource shortfalls or conflicts over the use of scarce or constrained resources. The plan 
also describes the guidelines for making program resource prioritization decisions and resolving resource conflicts.
When resources are unavailable within the program, the program manager calls upon the larger organization for 
assistance. When necessary, the program manager should work with the organization to develop a statement of work 
(SOW) to contract the necessary resources.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program resource requirements, and
u
u Program resource management plan.

Section 8
8.1.2.10 PROGRAM RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Program risk management planning identifies how to approach and conduct risk management activities for a program 
by considering its components. The principles for risk management should be applied as outlined in the Practice 
Standard for Project Risk Management [8]. The risk management plan is a component of the program management 
plan that describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed.
Planning risk management activities ensures that the level, type, and visibility of risk management are appropriate, 
based on the risks and importance of the program to the organization. It identifies the resources and time required for 
risk management activities. In addition, it establishes an agreed-upon basis for evaluating risks.
The program risk management planning activity should be conducted early in the program definition phase. It is 
crucial for the successful performance of other activities described in this section. It may also need to be repeated 
whenever major changes occur in the program. A key output of this activity is the program risk register, which is the 
document in which risks are recorded together with the results of risk analysis and risk response planning. The program 
risk register is a living document that is updated as program risks and risk responses change during program delivery.
It is essential to define risk profiles of organizations to construct the most suitable approach to managing program 
risks, adjusting risk sensitivity, and monitoring risk criticality. Risk targets and risk thresholds influence the program 
management plan. Risk profiles may be expressed in policy statements or revealed in actions. These actions may 
highlight organizational willingness to embrace high-threat situations or a reluctance to forgo high-opportunity choices. 
Market factors that apply to the program and to its components should be included as an environmental factor. Culture 
of the organization and stakeholders also plays a role in shaping the approach to risk management.
Organizations may have predefined approaches to risk management such as risk categories, common definition 
of concepts and terms, risk statement formats, standard templates, roles and responsibilities, and authority levels for 
decision making. Lessons learned from executing similar programs in the past are also critical assets to be reviewed as 
a component of establishing an effective risk management plan.
The outputs from this activity include:
u
u Program risk management plan, and
u
u Program risk register.

121
8.1.2.11 PROGRAM SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLANNING
The program schedule management activity determines the order and timing of the components needed to produce 
the program benefits, estimates the amount of time required to accomplish each one, identifies significant milestones 
during the performance of the program, and documents the outcomes of each milestone. Typically, a program schedule 
is developed collaboratively with components as component schedules are elaborated. Program components include 
projects, subsidiary programs, and other work undertaken to deliver the program’s scope.
Program schedule management planning begins with the program scope management plan and the program work 
breakdown structure (WBS), which defines how the program components are expected to deliver the program’s outputs 
and benefits. The initial program master schedule is often created before the detailed schedules of the individual 
components are available. The program’s delivery date and major milestones are developed using the program roadmap 
and the program charter.
The program master schedule is the top-level program planning document that defines the individual component 
schedules and dependencies among program components (individual components and program-level activities) required 
to achieve the program goals. It should include those component milestones that represent an output to the program or 
share interdependency with other components.
The program master schedule should also include activities that are unique to the program including, but not limited 
to, activities related to stakeholder engagement, program-level risk mitigation, and program-level reviews. The program 
master schedule determines the timing of individual components, enables the program manager to determine when 
benefits will be delivered by the program, and identifies external dependencies of the program. The first draft of a program 
master schedule often only identifies the order and start/end dates of components and their key interdependencies with 
other components. Later, it may be enriched with more intermediate component results as the component schedules 
are developed.
Once the high-level program master schedule is determined, the dates for each individual component are identified 
and used to develop the component’s schedule. These dates often act as a constraint at the component level. When 
a component has multiple deliverables upon which other components rely, those deliverables and interdependencies 
should be reflected in the overall program master schedule. When a program is established over a set of existing 
components, the program master schedule needs to incorporate the milestones and deliverables from the individual 
component schedules.

122	
Section 8
The schedule model principles outlined in the Practice Standard for Scheduling – Second Edition [9] should also 
be applied to the program master schedule. Maintaining a logic-based program network diagram and monitoring the 
critical path for component outputs with interdependencies is essential to effective management of the program master 
schedule, while focusing on benefits realization based on deliverables along the critical path.
The program schedule management plan is a component of the program management plan that establishes the 
criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The program schedule management 
plan should include guidance on how changes to schedule baselines are to be coordinated and controlled across 
program components. The program master schedule identifies the agreed-upon sequence of component deliverables 
to facilitate effective planning of the individual component deliveries and of expected benefits. It provides the program 
team/stakeholders with a visual representation of how the program is going to be delivered through its life cycle. The 
program master schedule is a living document and provides the program manager with a mechanism to identify risks 
and escalate component issues that may affect the program goals.
Program schedule risk inputs that are identified as part of the program master schedule development should be 
incorporated into the program risk register. These risks may be a result of component dependencies within the schedule 
or on external factors identified as a result of the agreed-upon program schedule management plan. The program 
schedule management plan may establish scheduling standards that apply to all program components.
The program roadmap should periodically be assessed and updated to ensure alignment between the program 
roadmap and the program master schedule. Changes in the program master schedule may require changes in the 
program roadmap, and changes in the program roadmap should be reflected in the program master schedule.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program schedule management plan,
u
u Program master schedule,
u
u Inputs to the program risk register, and
u
u Updates to the program roadmap.

123
8.1.2.12 PROGRAM SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLANNING
Program scope management planning includes all of the activities involved in planning and aligning the program 
scope with the program’s goals and objectives. It includes work decomposition into deliverable component products 
designed to deliver the associated benefits. The objective is to develop a detailed program scope statement, break down 
the program work into deliverable components, and develop a plan for managing the scope throughout the program.
Program scope is typically described in the form of expected benefits but may also be described as user stories or 
scenarios depending on the type of program. Program scope encompasses all benefits to be delivered by the program, 
which are reflected in the form of a program WBS.
A program WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition encompassing the total scope of the program, 
and it includes the deliverables to be produced by the constituent components. Elements not in the program WBS are 
outside the scope of the program. The program WBS includes, but is not limited to, program management artifacts 
such as plans, procedures, standards, processes, program management deliverables, and program management office 
(PMO) support deliverables. The program WBS provides an overview of the program and shows how each component 
contributes to the objectives of the program. Decomposition stops at the level of control required by the program 
manager (typically to the first one or two levels of a component). The program WBS serves as the framework for 
developing the program master schedule and defines the program manager’s management control points. It is an 
essential tool for building realistic schedules, developing cost estimates, and organizing work. It also provides the 
framework for reporting, tracking, and controlling.
Program-level deliverables should be clearly linked to benefits and focus on those activities associated with stakeholder 
engagement, program-level management (as opposed to management within its components), and component oversight 
and integration. Program scope includes scope that is decomposed and allocated into components. Care should be 
taken to avoid decomposing component-level scope into details that overlap the component managers’ responsibilities.
Once the scope is developed, a plan for managing, documenting, and communicating scope changes should be 
developed during the program definition phase. The program scope management plan is a component of the program 
management plan that describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and verified.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program scope statement,
u
u Program scope management plan, and
u
u Program work breakdown structure (WBS).

Section 8
8.2 PROGRAM DELIVERY PHASE ACTIVITIES
Program delivery phase activities include program activities required for coordinating and managing the actual 
delivery of programs. These include activities around change control, reporting, and information distribution as well as 
activities around cost, procurement, quality, and risk.
These provide supporting activities and processes that run throughout the program life cycle and are aimed to 
provide the program monitoring and controlling functions. Figure 8-3 illustrates how program delivery activities support 
program and component management.

8.2.1 PROGRAM CHANGE MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
Program change monitoring and controlling are the activities whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or 
baselines associated with the program are identified, documented, approved, or rejected. Program change monitoring 
and controlling is a critical aspect of overall program delivery monitoring and controlling and should include monitoring 
factors internal and external to the program that might create the need for changes to the program.
A program change request is a formal proposal to modify any program document, deliverable, or baseline. Program 
change requests should be recorded in the program change log. The program change requests should be analyzed to 
determine their urgency and impact on program baseline elements and other program components. When there are 
multiple ways to implement the change, the costs, risks, and other aspects of each option should be assessed to enable 
selection of the approach most likely to deliver the program’s intended benefits.
Once a decision on the program change request has been made by the program manager or program steering 
committee, program change control should ensure that the request is:
u
u Recorded in the program change log;
u
u Communicated to appropriate stakeholders, according to the program communications management plan; and
u
u Reflected in updates to component plans, as warranted.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Approved change requests, and
u
u Updates to the program change log.
8.2.2 PROGRAM COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
Program communications management comprises the activities necessary for the timely and appropriate 
generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of program information. Program 
communications management includes coordination, direction, and support of component communications to ensure 
alignment with the program’s overall communications objectives. Program information is distributed to the receiving 
parties including the clients, program sponsor, program steering committee, component managers, and, in some 
cases, the public and press.

126	
Section 8
The outputs of this activity include program communications regarding:
u
u Status information on the program, projects, subsidiary programs, or other work, including progress, cost 
information, risk analysis, and other information relevant to internal or external audiences;
u
u Notification of program change requests to the program and component teams, and the corresponding response 
to the change requests;
u
u Program financial reports for internal or external stakeholders or for the purpose of public disclosure;
u
u External filings with government and regulatory bodies as prescribed by laws and regulations;
u
u Presentations before legislative bodies with the required prebriefs;
u
u Public announcements communicating public outreach information;
u
u Press releases; and
u
u Media interviews and benefits updates.
8.2.2.1 PROGRAM INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION METHODS
Program information is distributed using a variety of methods, including:
u
u Face-to-face meetings and presentations to groups of stakeholders or program team members;
u
u Electronic communications and conferencing tools, such as email, fax, voicemail, telephone, video and web 
conferencing, and web publishing;
u
u Electronic tools for program management, such as web interfaces to scheduling and project management 
software, meeting and virtual office support software, portals, and collaborative work management tools;
u
u Social media (internet-based group communication tools), interviews, conference presentations, marketing, 
publication articles; and
u
u Informal communications such as emails, small group conversations, and staff meetings. These are the primary 
methods for communicating day-to-day activities but are not used to formally communicate the program’s status.
Regardless of the distribution method, the information should remain in the program’s control. An incorrect 
message to an audience may cause problems for the program and in some cases lead to the stoppage of a program. 
Program Communications Management can be challenging and time-consuming and may require a full-time manager 
assigned to the task.

127
8.2.2.2 PROGRAM REPORTING
Program reporting is a critical element of program communications, as it supports both program governance and 
stakeholder engagement. Program reporting is the activity of consolidating performance and reporting related data 
to provide stakeholders with information about how resources are being used to deliver program benefits. Program 
reporting aggregates all information across projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities to provide a clear 
picture of the program as a whole.
This information is conveyed to the stakeholders by means of the information distribution activity to provide 
them with needed status and deliverable information. Additionally, this information is communicated to program 
team members and its constituent components to provide them with general and background information about 
the program. Communication should be a two-way information flow. Any communications from customers or 
stakeholders regarding the program should be gathered by program management, analyzed, and distributed back 
within the program as required.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Reports required by program sponsors or program agreements, including formats and reporting frequency,
u
u Customer feedback requests, and
u
u Periodic reports and presentations.
8.2.3 PROGRAM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Once the program receives initial funding and begins paying expenses, the financial effort moves into tracking, 
monitoring, and controlling the program’s funds and expenditures.
Monitoring the program’s finances and controlling expenditures within budget are critical aspects of ensuring the 
program meets the goals of the funding agency or of the higher organization. A program whose costs exceed the 
planned budget may no longer satisfy the business case used to justify it and may be subject to cancellation. Even 
minor overruns are subject to audit and management oversight and should be justified. Typical financial management 
activities include:

128	
Section 8
u
u Identifying factors that create changes to the budget baseline,
u
u Monitoring the environmental factors for potential impacts,
u
u Managing changes when they occur,
u
u Monitoring costs reallocation impact and results among components,
u
u Monitoring contract expenditures to ensure funds are disbursed in accordance with the contracts,
u
u Implementing earned value management (schedule performance index, cost performance index),
u
u Identifying impacts to the program components from overruns or underruns,
u
u Communicating changes to the budget baseline to the governance groups and to the auditors (at both the 
program and component levels), and
u
u Managing the expenditure on the program infrastructure to ensure costs are within expected parameters.
As part of this activity, payments are made in accordance with the contracts, with the financial infrastructure of 
the program, and with the status of the contract deliverables. Individual component budgets are closed when work is 
completed on each component. Throughout the program, as changes are approved that have significant cost impacts, 
the program’s budget baseline is updated accordingly and the budget is rebaselined. New financial forecasts for 
the program are prepared on a regular basis and communicated in accordance with the program communications 
management plan. Similarly, approved changes either to the program or to an individual component are incorporated 
into the appropriate budget. All of these activities may result in updates to the program management plan.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Contract payments,
u
u Closed component budgets,
u
u Program budget baseline updates,
u
u Approved change requests,
u
u Revised estimate at completion,
u
u Program management plan updates, and
u
u Corrective actions.

129
8.2.3.1 PROGRAM COST BUDGETING
Since programs are, by definition, composed of multiple components, program budgets should include the costs for 
each individual component as well as costs for the resources to manage the program itself. The baselined program 
budget is the primary financial target that the program is measured against. The majority of the program’s cost is 
attributable to the individual components within the program and not to managing the program itself. When contractors 
are involved, the details of the budget come from the contracts. The cost of program management and supporting 
program activities is added to the initial budget figure before a baseline budget can be prepared.
Two important parts of the budget are program payment schedules and component payment schedules. The program 
payment schedules identify the schedules and milestones where funding is received by the funding organization. The 
component payment schedules indicate how and when contractors are paid in accordance with the contract provisions. 
Once the baseline is determined, the program management plan is updated.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Updates to the program budget baseline,
u
u Program payment schedules, and
u
u Component payment schedules.
8.2.3.2 COMPONENT COST ESTIMATION
Because programs have a significant element of uncertainty, not all program components may be known when the 
initial order-of-magnitude estimates are calculated during the program definition phase. In addition, given the typically 
long duration of a program, the initial estimates may need to be updated to reflect the current environment and cost 
considerations. It is a generally accepted good practice to calculate an estimate as close to the beginning of a work 
effort as possible. This way, if the cost of the output is lower than originally planned, the program manager may present 
an opportunity to the program sponsor for additional products that would be acquired later in the program. Conversely, 
if the cost is significantly higher, a change request may be generated. In the approval activity, the benefit of additional 
products can be weighed against the new cost to determine the proper action.
Cost estimates for the individual components within the program are developed. The component costs are baselined 
and become the budget for that particular component. When a contractor is performing this component, this cost is 
written into the contract.
The outputs of this activity include component cost estimates.

130	
Section 8
8.2.4 PROGRAM INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Effective program management involves the extensive exchange of information among program management, 
component management, portfolio management, program stakeholders, and program governance functions of an 
organization. Managing this information and making it available to support program communications, program 
management, or archiving is a significant and continuous task, especially in organizations pursuing numerous programs 
or programs that are complicated or complex.
Using the information management tools and processes established in the program information management plan, 
this activity collects, receives, organizes, and stores the documents and other information products created by program 
activities, program governance, and program components. Attention should be paid to the accuracy and timeliness of 
the information to avoid errors and incorrect decisions. The program information repository can be an invaluable aid to 
other program activities, particularly when there is a need to refer to past decisions or prepare analyses based on trends 
reflected in historical program information.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Updates to the program information repository, and
u
u Inputs to information distribution and program reporting.
8.2.4.1 LESSONS LEARNED DATABASE
Lessons learned are a compilation of knowledge gained. This knowledge may be acquired from executing similar 
and relevant programs in the past, or it may reside in public domain databases. Lessons learned are critical assets to 
be reviewed when updating the program stakeholder register, program risk register, and program communications 
management plan or when considering major changes to the program management plan, including the introduction of 
new program components. The lessons learned database is updated when necessary, including at the completion of 
components and at the end of the program.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Lessons learned reports,
u
u Inputs to program stakeholder register and risk register updates,
u
u Inputs to program communications management plan updates, and
u
u Inputs to program management plan changes.

131
8.2.5 PROGRAM PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
Program managers utilize multiple tools and techniques to conduct program procurements, but the key objective 
of conducting program-level procurement is to set standards for the components. These standards may come in 
the form of qualified seller lists, pre-negotiated contracts, blanket purchase agreements, and formalized proposal 
evaluation criteria.
One common structure used by the program manager is to direct all procurements to be centralized and conducted 
by a program-level team rather than assigning that responsibility to individual components.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Request for quote (RFQ),
u
u Request for proposal (RFP),
u
u Invitation for bid (IFB),
u
u Proposal evaluation criteria,
u
u Agreements administration plan, and
u
u Signed agreements.
8.2.5.1 PROGRAM CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
Once the program standards are in place and the agreements are signed, administration and closeout of many contracts 
are transitioned to the components. The details of contract deliverables, requirements, deadlines, cost, and quality are 
handled at the component level. The individual managers at the component level report procurement results and closeouts 
to the program manager. Where contracts are administered at the program level, however, component managers coordinate 
or report deliverable acceptance, contract changes, and other contract issues with the program staff.
The program manager maintains visibility in the procurements to ensure the program budget is being expended 
properly to obtain program benefits.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Performance/earned value reports,
u
u Ongoing progress reports, and
u
u Vendor/contract performance reports.

132	
Section 8
8.2.6 PROGRAM QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
Program quality assurance and control involves the activities related to the periodic evaluation of overall program 
quality to provide confidence that the program will comply with relevant quality policies and standards. Once the initial 
quality assurance specifications are decided upon in the program planning subphase, quality should be continuously 
monitored and analyzed. Programs often conduct quality assurance audits to ensure proper updates are performed. New 
government laws and regulations may create new quality standards. The program management team is responsible 
for implementing all required quality changes. The lengthy duration of programs often requires quality assurance 
updates throughout the program’s duration. Program quality assurance focuses on cross-program, intercomponent 
quality relationships and how one component’s quality specification impacts another component’s quality, when they 
are interdependent. Program quality assurance also includes the analysis of the quality control results of the program 
components to ensure overall program quality is delivered.
The outputs from this activity may include:
u
u Quality assurance audit findings, and
u
u Quality assurance change requests.
8.2.6.1 PROGRAM QUALITY CONTROL
Program quality control involves the monitoring of specific components or program deliverables and results to 
determine if they meet the quality requirements and lead to benefits realization. The quality control activity ensures that 
quality plans are implemented at project and subsidiary program levels, using quality reviews usually performed with 
constituent component reviews. Quality control is performed throughout the duration of the program. Program results 
include product and service deliverables, management results and cost schedule, and performance, as well as benefits 
realized by the end user. End-user satisfaction is a powerful metric that should be obtained to gauge the program 
quality. The fitness for use of the benefits, product, or service delivered by the program is best evaluated by those who 
receive it. To that end, programs often use customer satisfaction surveys as a quality control measurement.
Outputs from this activity may include:
u
u Quality change requests,
u
u Quality control completed checklists and inspection reports, and
u
u Quality test reports or measurement results.

133
8.2.7 PROGRAM RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Throughout program delivery, the program manager will need to monitor, control, and adapt program resources to 
ensure benefits delivery. Resource prioritization allows the program manager to prioritize the use of resources that are 
not available in abundance and to optimize their use across all components within the program. This often involves 
human resource planning to identify, document, and assign program roles and responsibilities to individuals or groups.
During program delivery, the need for staff, facilities, equipment, and other resources change. These fluctuations 
are similar to the economics of supply and demand. The program manager manages resources at the program level 
and works with the component managers who manage resources at the component level to balance the needs of the 
program with the availability of resources.
Resource prioritization decisions should be based on the guidelines in the program resource management plan. As 
decisions to change existing program components or to initiate new ones may have impacts on program resources, the 
program resource management plan may need to be adapted as a result.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Program resource prioritization decisions, and
u
u Updates to the program resource management plan.
8.2.7.1 RESOURCE INTERDEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
Resources are often shared among different components within a program, and the program manager should work 
to ensure that the interdependencies do not cause delay in benefits delivery. This is achieved by carefully controlling the 
schedule for scarce resources. The program manager ensures resources are released for other programs when they are 
no longer necessary for the current program.
The program manager may work with the component managers to ensure the program resource management plan 
accounts for changes in use of interdependent or scarce program resources.
The output of this activity includes updates to the program resource management plan.

134	
Section 8
8.2.8 PROGRAM RISK MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
Throughout program delivery, program risk management will monitor and control program risks through:
u
u Program risk identification,
u
u Program risk analysis, and
u
u Program risk response management.
Risk monitoring is also conducted to determine whether:
u
u Program assumptions are still valid;
u
u Assessed risk has changed from its prior state, with analysis of trends;
u
u Proper risk management policies and procedures are being followed; and
u
u Cost or schedule contingency reserves are modified in line with the risks of the program.
Effective program risk monitoring and controlling also requires coordination with component risk management 
functions.
8.2.8.1 PROGRAM RISK IDENTIFICATION
The program risk identification activity determines which risks could affect the program, documents their 
characteristics, and prepares for their successful management. Participants in risk identification activities may include 
the program manager, program sponsor, program team members, risk management team, subject matter experts from 
outside the program team, customers, end users, component managers, managers of other program components, 
stakeholders, risk management experts, and external reviewers, as required.
Risk identification is an iterative activity. As the program progresses, new risks may evolve or become known. 
The frequency of iteration and involvement of participants may vary, but the format of the risk statements should be 
consistent. This allows for the comparison of risk events in the program. The identification activity should provide 
sufficient information to allow the risk to be analyzed and prioritized.
The output of this activity may include updates to the program risk register.

135
8.2.8.2 PROGRAM RISK ANALYSIS
Risk analysis at the program level should integrate relevant program component risks. Managing the interdependencies 
among the component risks and the program provides significant benefits to the program and its components.
Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis techniques are both useful to support program management decisions. This 
step in the risk management activity produces the best information supporting the contingency reserve and management 
reserve that should be set aside to deal with risks that actually occur. The assessments should include costs, schedules, 
and performance outcomes for the components as well as their interdependencies.
The impact of the negative risks (threats) and positive risks (opportunities) on the delivery of benefits to the organization 
or external stakeholders should be considered at the program level. One essential difference between programs and 
components is the time scale; component-level risks should be dealt with within a relatively short time frame (i.e., at 
the end of a phase or a component), while program risks may be applicable at a point in the potentially distant future.
The outputs of this activity may include:
u
u Proposed risk responses,
u
u Updates to the program risk register, and
u
u Periodic risk reports showing threat and opportunity trends.
8.2.8.3 PROGRAM RISK RESPONSE MANAGEMENT
To respond to risks, the program manager identifies and directs actions to mitigate the negative consequences or to 
enable realization of potential benefits. The program manager may hold contingency reserves at the program level to 
support risk responses. The program contingency reserve is not a substitute for the component contingency reserve, 
which is held at the component level.
Based on the program manager’s direction, components of the program risk register may be updated, including:
u
u Specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;
u
u Budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;
u
u Contingency plans and trigger conditions that call for their execution;
u
u Fallback plans for use as a response to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be inadequate;
u
u Residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that have 
been deliberately accepted; and
u
u Secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing the risk response.

136	
Section 8
The outputs of this activity may include:
u
u Direction to implement risk responses,
u
u Program risk register updates,
u
u Contingency reserve and management reserve, and
u
u Change requests.
8.2.9 PROGRAM SCHEDULE MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
Program schedule monitoring and controlling is the activity of ensuring the program produces the required capabilities 
and benefits on time. This activity includes tracking and monitoring the start and finish of all high-level component 
and program activities and milestones against the program master schedule planned timelines. Updating the program 
master schedule and directing changes to individual component schedules is required to maintain an accurate and up-
to-date program master schedule.
Program schedule monitoring and controlling works closely with other program activities to identify variances to 
the schedules and directs corrective action when necessary and as described in Section 7.2.2.2. Successful program 
management is dependent on the alignment of program scope with cost and schedule, which are dependent on each 
other. Schedule control involves identifying not only slippages but also opportunities to accelerate program or component 
schedules and should be used for proper risk management. Program schedule risks should be tracked as part of the 
risk management activity.
The program master schedule should also be reviewed to assess the impact of component-level changes on other 
components and on the program itself. There may be a need to accelerate or decelerate components within the schedule 
to achieve program goals. Identification of both slippages and early deliveries are necessary as part of the overall 
program management function. Identification of early deliveries may provide opportunities for program acceleration. 
Approval of deviations to component schedules may be necessary to realize program benefits as a result of component 
performance deviations. Due to the complexity and potential long duration of programs, the program master schedule 
may need to be updated to include new components or remove components as a result of approved change requests to 
meet evolving program goals. The program roadmap should be assessed for potential revision when there is significant 
change in the program master schedule.

137
The program schedule monitoring and controlling activity include updates to the program master schedule, updates 
to the program roadmap, and identification of schedule risks as outputs to the activity.
The outputs of this activity may include:
u
u Updates to the program master schedule,
u
u Updates to the program risk register, and
u
u Updates to the program roadmap.
8.2.10 PROGRAM SCOPE MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
It is important for the program manager to monitor and control scope as the program develops in order to ensure 
successful completion. Scope changes that have significant impact on a component or the program may originate from 
stakeholders, components within the program, previously unidentified requirements issues, or external sources.
Program scope monitoring and controlling should be exercised in line with the program change management and 
program scope management plans. This activity should capture requested scope changes, evaluate each requested 
change, determine the disposition of each requested change, communicate the decision to affected stakeholders, and 
record the change request and supporting detail. Major change requests, when approved, may require updates to the 
program management plan and program scope statement.
The program manager is responsible for determining which components of the program are affected when a 
program scope change is requested and should update the program work breakdown structure accordingly. In very 
large programs, the number of components affected may be substantial and difficult to assess. Program managers 
should restrict their activities to managing scope only to the allocated level for components and should avoid controlling 
component scope that has been further decomposed by the project manager or by subsidiary program managers.
The outputs of this activity may include:
u
u Updated program scope statement,
u
u Dispositions of requests with documentation of the rationale for the decision,
u
u Updates to the program management plan, and
u
u Updates to the program work breakdown structure.

138	
Section 8
8.3 PROGRAM CLOSURE PHASE ACTIVITIES
The program closure phase activities begin when the program components have delivered all their outputs and the 
program has begun to deliver its intended benefits. In some cases, program governance may decide to bring a program 
to an early close before all components have been completed. In either case, the goal of the program activities during 
this phase is to release the program resources and support the transition of any remaining program outputs and assets, 
including its documents and databases, to ongoing organizational activities.
Figure 8-4 illustrates how program closure activities support program closure and transition to sustaining 
organizational operations.

8.3.1 PROGRAM FINANCIAL CLOSURE
To enable program closeout, estimates may be required to determine the costs of sustaining benefits created by 
the program. While many of these costs are captured in operations, maintenance, or other activities initiated in the 
program delivery phase as components are delivered, there may be residual activities required to oversee the ongoing 
benefits. This stewardship may be structured as an individual project or as a resulting program, or may be incorporated 
as new work under a separate portfolio or program or in new or existing operations. As the program nears completion, 
the program budget is closed and the final financial reports are communicated in accordance with the program 
communications management plan. Any unspent monies are returned to the funding organization.
Program financial transition is complete once sustainment budgets are developed, benefits are delivered, and 
sustainment has commenced.
The outputs of this activity may include:
u
u Input to the program final report,
u
u Updates to the program financial management plan,
u
u Inputs into the knowledge repository,
u
u Documentation of new tools and techniques used in the course of the program into the knowledge management 
system,
u
u Financial closing statements, and
u
u Closed program budget.
8.3.2 PROGRAM INFORMATION ARCHIVING AND TRANSITION
For legal reasons or to support ensuing operations or other programs, there may be a need to collect program records 
and organize them for archiving or for use by other elements of the organization. The scope of this activity may include 
collection and archiving of records and documentation from components as well.
Proper information management during program closure also includes the transfer of program knowledge to support 
the ongoing sustainment of program benefits by providing the new supporting organization with documentation, training, 
or materials. The program manager may assess the program’s performance, collect observations from program team 
members, and provide a final lessons learned report that incorporates the individual findings from continuous lessons 
learned captured throughout the program/component activities. This report can inform the governance and management 
of other programs in the organization and to help them avoid pitfalls encountered during program delivery.

140	
Section 8
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Inputs to organizational archives, and
u
u Lessons learned report to organizational governance bodies.
8.3.3 PROGRAM PROCUREMENT CLOSURE
Program procurement closure activities are those that formally close out each agreement of the program after 
ensuring that all deliverables have been satisfactorily completed, that all payments have been made, and that there are 
no outstanding contractual issues. In the case of a program that is closed early, program procurement closure manages 
the termination of active contracts to avoid unnecessary costs.
The outputs of this activity include:
u
u Contract closeout reports,
u
u Updates to lessons learned, and
u
u Closed contracts.
8.3.4 PROGRAM RESOURCE TRANSITION
It is important to ensure that program resources are appropriately released as the program is being closed. This may 
involve the reallocation or reassignment of team members and funding to other initiatives or programs. Reassignment 
of resources at the component level could include transitioning resources to another component already in execution 
or another program within the organization that requires a similar skill set. Refer to the PMBOK® Guide for more 
information regarding resource disposition for component projects.
Efficient and appropriate release of program resources is an essential activity of program closure. At the program 
level, program governance releases resources as a part of activities leading to program closure approval.
The outputs of this activity include resources released to other organizational elements.
8.3.5 PROGRAM RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSITION
Although the program is closed, there may be remaining risks that could undermine the realization of benefits by the 
organization. Program risk management activities should transfer these risks, along with any supporting analysis and 
response information, to the appropriate organizational risk register. This may be managed by a different organizational 
group than the one intended to realize the benefits, such as an organizational PMO.
The outputs of this activity include inputs to other organizational risk registers.

APPENDIX X1
FOURTH EDITION CHANGES
X1.1 ABOUT THIS APPENDIX
To fully understand the changes that have been made to the structure and content of The Standard for Program 
Management – Fourth Edition, it is important for the reader to be aware of the update committee’s objectives as well 
as the evolution of the standard.
Through the process of updating the Third edition of the standard, it became clear that the growing importance 
of program management as an organizational competency was generating an increasing demand for clearer lines of 
distinction between The Standard for Program Management and PMI’s other core standards, including A Guide to the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide), and The Standard for Portfolio Management. It was also at 
this time that the document shifted from a process-based standard to a principle-based standard. The Fourth edition 
team continued down a similar path, and focused primarily on fine tuning the principles and concepts that make up 
the standard, as well as ensuring consistency with other foundational standards and applicable practice standards and 
practice guides.
X1.2 OBJECTIVES
Specifically, the update committee’s objectives included:
u
u Maintain the standard as a principle-based document that describes the fundamentals that shape program 
management and what constitutes good practice on most programs most of the time.
u
u Update the content to reflect current program management accepted practices.
u
u Ensure that the updates interlink and harmonize with other PMI standards as appropriate.

144	
Appendix X1
X1.3 APPROACH
To prepare the current update, the project committee developed an approach to the revision that incorporated a 
number of important strategies and principles, including format and layout (Section X1.3.1) and program management 
content (Section X1.3.2).
X1.3.1 FORMAT AND LAYOUT
When first encountering The Standard for Program Management – Fourth Edition, readers will immediately notice 
fundamental modifications that have been made to the format and layout of the standard. There are a number of 
important factors that were considered during the design of the framework for the Fourth Edition that will be beneficial 
as background information for readers familiar with earlier editions, and will help explain the transition from the format 
of the Third Edition to the current. To explain the current framework, a brief summary of the evolution of the standard 
from the first edition to the present is provided:
u
u First Edition. When it was published, the First edition of The Standard for Program Management presented three 
key themes that captured the prevailing understanding of program management work. These themes included 
Stakeholder Management, Program Governance, and Benefits Management. Accompanying the themes was the 
definition of the program management life cycle. This life cycle was integrated into the initial chapters of the 
standard and further elaborated on in the later chapters. This framework presents a decidedly “domain-oriented” 
approach to the standard; to the definition of program management work; and to the role of the program manager.
u
u Second Edition. The Second edition of The Standard for Program Management retained some discussion of the 
three program management themes described in the First edition. Many of the updates, however, focused on 
expanding the presence of the program management life cycle. This approach positioned the program management 
life cycle as the predominant thread throughout the entire standard document. In addition, a structure for the 
standard was adopted that mirrored the layout and format of PMI’s project management standard, the PMBOK® 
Guide. Within this structure, the program standard described specific program management Process Groups and 
Knowledge Areas. With this framework in place, the Second Edition revealed a clearly evident life-cycle-based, 
“process orientation” to the presentation of program management work and the role of the program manager.
u
u Third Edition. Considering the previous two editions, emphasis for the Third edition was on usefulness and 
readability. Careful analysis of the most effective elements of the earlier editions resulted in a decision to change 
from the Second edition’s structure that paralleled the PMBOK® Guide’s Process Groups, Knowledge Areas, and 
inputs/tools and techniques/outputs in favor of the domain-oriented presentation of the First Edition.

145
Within the Third Edition, the following key changes were made:
n
n The return to the domain-orientation of the First Edition,
n
n The focus on the program management performance domains presented in the RDS,
n
n The benefits of the learnings and advancements derived from both previous editions of PMI’s The Standard 
for Program Management, and
n
n An alignment to, and recognition of, other standards and writings in program management from outside the 
United States.
u
u Fourth Edition. It was determined that significant changes between the Third and Fourth Editions were not 
necessary, and changes instead focused on addressing deferred comments from the Third Edition update as 
well as comments submitted by subject matter experts through an internal review and exposure draft process. 
Given that a major update occurred between the Second and Third Editions through the shift to a principle-
based approach, it was also an opportunity to increase consistency throughout the eight sections. Table X1-1 
summarizes major changes across the sections:

146

Added a subsection on program complexity and interdependency
Shifted introduction of program life cycle phases into Section 7
Expanded to address program risk strategy
Expanded to address program stakeholder mapping and program stakeholder 
communication
PMI published a new Practice Guide -- Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and 
Projects: A Practice Guide. A careful review of the sections addressing program 
governance was performed so that both publications align. The standard and 
practice guide now reﬂect consistency in description of roles.
Expanded to address the roles associated within program governance 
Content reorganized with activity-based content shifted to Section 8
Absorbed introduction to life cycle phases
Relabeled “program beneﬁts delivery phase” to “program delivery phase”
Added an introduction to program activities to segue into Section 8
As the standard continues to shift closer to being principle-based, versus 
process-based, Section 8 shifted away from supporting “processes” to 
supporting “program activities.”
A major change to the structure of Section 8 also occurred to assist practitioners 
in mapping Sections 3 through 7 with the content of Section 8. Program activities 
are now aligned to the program life cycle phases versus topics. 
Program artifacts that were not explained or utilized were removed. Careful detail was 
also placed on harmonizing the descriptions of artifacts across the various sections.
Program. Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed 
in a coordinated manner to obtain beneﬁts not available from managing them 
individually.
Program Management. The application of knowledge, skills, and principles to 
a program to achieve the program objectives and to obtain beneﬁts and control 
not available by managing program components individually.

147
X1.3.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTENT
The Standard for Program Management – Fourth Edition presents concepts and practices unique to program 
management and does not imitate, copy, or represent concepts or processes that are easily referenced in the 
vast body of project management literature. Where program management processes rely on or may be performed 
similarly to those found in the project management domain, the user is directed to documentation and relevant 
readings in project management.
X1.4 OVERVIEW OF SECTIONS
Sections X1.4.1 through X1.4.8 describe each section of the standard and detail the changes the reader will find 
when comparing the Second and Third Editions.
X1.4.1 SECTION 1—INTRODUCTION
Minor changes were made throughout Section 1 to improve consistency within the standard and to ensure that key 
concepts covered in Sections 2 through 8 were introduced early in the document.
In Section 1.2 the role of programs in delivering benefits via the outcomes and outputs of component activities 
was emphasized. The term subsidiary program, which was defined as a program sponsored by another program, 
was also introduced.
In Section 1.3, the importance of ensuring that program components remain strategically aligned with the 
organization’s goals was emphasized.
Section 1.4 addressed the differences and interactions between program management and project management in 
greater detail, emphasizing the iterative nature of programs.
Content from the Third Edition appendix was absorbed into Section 1 in order to expand the discussion of roles 
important to programs, including the role of the program sponsor and the program management office. Section 1.7.1 
was also expanded to enhance the descriptions of important program manager skills including: communication, 
stakeholder engagement, change management, leadership, analysis, and component integration skills.
As with the previous editions, effort was made to harmonize this section with other PMI foundational standards. 
Table X1-2 outlines the revised Section 1.

X1.4.2 SECTION 2—PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAINS
Section 2 maintained the focus on explaining the Program Management Performance Domains and discussing 
and documenting the characteristics that uniquely define program management as something different from project 
management and portfolio management.
Sections 2.1.1 (Program Life Cycle Phases) was removed from Section 2. The rationale is that the focus of Section 2 
is on the explanation of the Program Management Performance Domains. The Program Life Cycle is discussed in detail 
in Section 7. In addition, Section 2.1.2 was also removed and moved to Section 7.
The logical flow of this section was addressed with Section 2.5 (Third Edition) moving to Section 2.3 (Fourth Edition). 
This provides this section with a more top-down approach. The differences between a portfolio, a program, and a project 
were revised. The logical order was changed to first discuss the difference between a portfolio and a program and then 
the difference between a program and a project. Three distinctions are made between a program and a project in this 
edition (complexity, change, and uncertainty) versus the two distinctions in the Third Edition (change and uncertainty).

X1.4.3 SECTION 3—PROGRAM STRATEGY ALIGNMENT
To further enhance the Program Strategy Alignment Performance Domain, the Fourth Edition added Program Risk 
Management Strategy as a means for ensuring the program is aligned with organizational strategy. The program risk 
management strategy is developed by defining program risk thresholds, performing the initial program risk assessment, 
and developing a high-level program risk response strategy, which will then be used to guide program risk management 
activities (actively identifying, monitoring, analyzing, accepting, mitigating, avoiding, or retiring program risk).
Other changes in Section 3 were minor and mainly included moving process level details to Section 8 while retaining 
high-level descriptions in this section.

and risk. This section was refined to be in agreement with the updates to the life cycle. Nomenclature was updated to 
agree with newly adopted terminology within the standard.
Figures and tables were updated to agree with the new text and the remainder of the standard.

X1.4.5 SECTION 5—PROGRAM STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Program Stakeholder Engagement appeared in the First Edition of the standard as one of the three themes in program 
management, along with benefits realization and governance. This domain is focused on stakeholder engagement 
rather than stakeholder management because the work of the program manager in organizations is to ensure the direct 
and frequent engagement of stakeholders and the active management of each engagement. In the Fourth Edition, the 
information was expanded by elaborating on stakeholder analysis and communication. These aspects are critical to 
understanding the organizational culture, politics, and concerns related to the program, as well as the overall impact, 
which in turn may impact or influence the delivery of benefits by the program.
Table X1-6 provides an overview of Section 5.
Table X1-6. Section 5 – Fourth Edition
X1.4.6 PROGRAM GOVERNANCE
Program governance appeared in the First Edition of the standard as one of the three themes in program management, 
along with benefits realization and stakeholder management. In the Fourth Edition, program governance is detailed as 
one of the four Program Management Performance Domains which enables and performs program decision making,

Where appropriate, the Fourth Edition leverages and aligns with Section 4 of Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and 
Projects: A Practice Guide covering roles and responsibilities and program and governance relationships. Specific synergies 
between sections covering ‘Roles and Responsibilities’ and ‘Program and Governance Relationships’ are included.
This edition introduces a description of the environment and organizational factors and the program attributes which 
the design of program governance accommodates (see Table X1-7). Content was also reorganized with activity-based 
content shifting to Section 8, where appropriate.

X1.4.7 PROGRAM
The Fourth Edition expands the program life cycle management section to emphasize the importance of program 
integration management. This is a core activity that occurs across the program life cycle. As a result, activities related to 
program integration management that were associated with the program level supporting activities have been relocated 
from Section 8 to Section 7. This update serves to provide a more complete explanation of how integration management 
combines, unifies, and coordinates the work of multiple components within the program.
Additionally, the Program Benefits Delivery phase has been renamed to Program Delivery. This change seeks to draw 
a clear distinction between the major phases of the program life cycle and the activities that are performed as part of 
Benefits Delivery in the Benefits Management performance domain. The Program Delivery phase includes the benefits 
analysis and planning activities, in addition to, the benefits delivery activities. It encompasses all the work required to 
deliver the intended benefits, such as prioritizing, initiating, planning, and executing the program components, as well 
as, monitoring each component to ensure its benefits are aligned to the benefit realization plan.
These key elements represent the evolution of program life cycle management and how program activities that are 
performed to support the individual components in achieving the overall program objectives.
Table X1-8 provides an overview of Section 7.

X1.4.8 PROGRAM ACTIVITIES
In the Third Edition, Section 8 was structured along the lines of program management supporting processes, including 
Program Financial Management, Scope Management, Communications Management, Procurement Management, and 
others, which provide the needed process information to complement Program Life Cycle Management, as described in 
Section 7. The Fourth Edition committee considered it more effective to align Section 8 with Section 7 by restructuring 
the material into program life cycle phases and describing the activities that support each phase. Program Change 
Management was introduced as a Program Activity to enable more formal planning, monitoring, and controlling of 
change during Program Definition and Delivery. Finally, Program Information Management was described as a Program 
Activity separate from Program Communications Management, recognizing the importance of managing program 
information resources and reflecting current best practices.

GLOSSARY
1. INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS
This glossary includes terms that are:
u
u Unique to program management (e.g., benefits management).
u
u Not unique to program management, but used differently or with a narrower meaning in program management 
than in general everyday usage (e.g., benefit, risk).
This glossary generally does not include:
u
u Application or industry area-specific terms.
u
u Terms used in program management which do not differ in any material way from everyday use (e.g., business 
outcome).
u
u Terms used in program management which do not differ from a similar term defined in the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth 
Edition, except that these terms are now used at a program level instead of a project level (e.g. a program charter
