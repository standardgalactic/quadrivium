This work has arisen from lecture courses given by the authors on impor-
tant topics within functional analysis. The authors, who are all leading re-
searchers, give introductions to their subjects at a level ideal for beginning
graduate students, as well as others interested in the subject. The collection has
been carefully edited to form a coherent and accessible introduction to current
research topics.
The ﬁrst part of the book, by Professor Dales, introduces the general theory
of Banach algebras, which serves as a background to the remaining material.
Dr Willis then studies a centrally important Banach algebra, the group algebra of
a locally compact group. The remaining chapters are devoted to Banach algebras
of operators on Banach spaces: Professor Eschmeier gives all the background
for the exciting topic of invariant subspaces of operators, and discusses some
key open problems; Dr Laursen and Professor Aiena discuss local spectral
theory for operators, leading into Fredholm theory.

Preface
This volume is based on a collection of lectures intended for graduate students
and others with a basic knowledge of functional analysis. It surveys several
areas of current research interest, and is designed to be suitable preparatory
readingforthoseembarkingongraduatework.Thevolumeconsistsofﬁveparts,
which are based on separate sets of lectures, each by different authors. Each part
provides an overview of the subject that will also be useful to mathematicians
working in related areas. The chapters were originally presented as lectures at
instructional conferences for graduate students, and we have maintained the
styles of these lectures.
The sets of lectures are an introduction to their subjects, intended to convey
the ﬂavour of certain topics, and to give some basic deﬁnitions and motivating
examples: they are certainly not comprehensive accounts. References are given
to sources in the literature where more details can be found.
The chapters in Part I are by H. G. Dales. These are an introduction to the
general theory of Banach algebras, and a description of the most important
examples: B(E), the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Banach space
E; L 1(G), the group algebra of a locally compact group G, taken with the
convolution product; commutative Banach algebras, including Banach algebras
of functions on compact sets in C and radical Banach algebras. Chapters 3–6
cover Gelfand theory for commutative Banach algebras, the analytic functional
calculus, and, in a chapter on ‘automatic continuity’, the lovely results that show
the intimate connection between the algebraic and topological structures of a
Banach algebra. Chapters 6 and 7 are an introduction to the cohomology theory
of Banach algebras, at present a very active area of research; we concentrate on
the basic structure, that of derivations into modules.
The chapters in Part II, by G. A. Willis, develop the theory of one of the
examples discussed by Dales: these are the group algebras L 1(G). Chapters 8
and 9 give a description of locally compact groups G and their structure theory,
vii

viii
Preface
and then describe the algebras L 1(G), and the related measure algebra M(G),
as a Banach algebra. The Gelfand theory for general commutative Banach
algebras, as described by Dales, becomes Fourier transform theory in the special
case of the algebras L 1(G). In Chapter 10, Willis discusses compact groups,
abelian groups, and free groups, and then, in Chapter 11, moves to a very
important class, that of amenable groups: many characterizations of amenability
arise in diverse areas of mathematics. Willis then expands a notion from Part I
by discussing the automatic continuity of linear maps from group algebras.
Parts III–V of this book develop the theory of another example mentioned
by Dales: this is the algebra B(E) for a Banach space E. However, they also
concentrate on the properties of single operators of various types within B(E).
A seminal question in functional analysis is the ‘invariant subspace problem’.
Let E be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(E). A closed subspace F of E is
invariant for T if T y ∈F (y ∈F) ; F is trivial if F = {0} or F = E. Does
such an operator T always have a non-trivial invariant subspace? A positive
answer to this question in the case where E is ﬁnite-dimensional (of dimension
at least 2) is the ﬁrst step in the structure theory of matrices. The question for
Banach spaces has been the spur for a huge amount of research in operator
theory since the question was ﬁrst raised in the 1930s. The question is still open
in the case where E is a Hilbert space – this is one of the great problems of
our subject – but counter-examples are known when E is an arbitrary Banach
space. Nevertheless, there are many positive results for operators T ∈B(E)
which belong to a special class.
The chapters in Part III, by J. Eschmeier, discuss in particular one very impor-
tant technique for establishing positive results: it descends from original work
of Scott Brown in 1978. One class of operators considered is that of subdecom-
posable operators. Part III concludes with remarks about the extensions, mainly
due to the author, of the positive results to n-tuples of commuting operators.
As explained by Dales, every element a of a Banach algebra has a spectrum,
called σ(a); this is a non-empty, compact subset of the complex plane C. In
particular, each operator T ∈B(E) has such a spectrum, σ(T ). In the case where
E is ﬁnite-dimensional, σ(T ) is just the set of eigenvalues of T . The notion of
the spectrum for a general operator T is at the heart of the remaining chapters,
by K. B. Laursen and P. Aiena.
Laursen discusses the spectral theory of operators in several different classes;
these include in particular the decomposable operators, which were also intro-
duced by Eschmeier. We understand the nature of an operator T by looking at the
decomposition of σ(T ) into subsets with special properties and also at special
closed subspaces of E on which T acts ‘in a nice way’. In particular, Laursen

Preface
ix
discusses super-decomposable and generalized scalar operators. In Chapter 25,
Laursen relates his description to notions introduced by Dales by discussing
when multiplication operators on commutative Banach algebras have the var-
ious properties that he has introduced. A valuable appendix to Part IV
sketches the background theory, involving distributions, to the ‘functional
model’ of Albrecht and Eschmeier that is the natural setting for many of the
duality results that have been obtained.
The ﬁnal chapters, those of P. Aiena, are closely related to those of
Laursen. The basic examples of the decomposable operators of Eschmeier’s
and Laursen’s chapters are compact operators on a Banach space and normal
operators on a Hilbert space. It is natural to study the decomposable operators
which have similar properties to those of these important speciﬁc examples: we
are led to the class of ‘Fredholm operators’ and related classes, a main topic of
Aiena’s lectures.
In these chapters, we see again, from a different perspective, some of the
key ideas – decomposition of the spectrum, invariant subspace, single-valued
extension property, actions of analytic functions, divisible subspaces – that
have featured in earlier chapters. The ﬁnal chapter by Aiena summarizes recent
work of the author and others.
The lectures on which this book is based were given at two conferences. The
ﬁrst was held in Mussomeli, Sicily, from 22 to 29 September 1999. We are very
grateful to Dr Gianluigi Oliveri, who organized this conference, and to the As-
sociazone Culturale Archimede of Sicily who sponsored it. The lectures given
at this conference were those of Dales, Eschmeier, Laursen, and Aiena. The
second conference was held at the Sadar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar,
Gujarat, India, from 8 to 15 January 2002. We are very grateful to Professor
Subhashbhai Bhatt and Dr Haresh Dedania for organizing this conference, and
to the Indian Board for Higher Mathematics and to the London Mathematical
Society, who supported the conference ﬁnancially. The lectures given in Gujarat
were those of Dales, Willis, and Laursen.
As we said, the original lectures were intended for graduate students and
others with a basic knowledge of functional analysis and with a background in
complex analysis and algebra typical of a ﬁrst degree in mathematics. In both
cases the students were enthusiastic and helpful; their suggestions led to many
improvements in the exposition, and we are grateful to them for this.
Infact,theactuallecturesasgivendidnotincludeallthatiswrittendownhere:
modest additions have been made subsequently. There is more in a ‘lecture’
than can easily be absorbed in one hour. However, we have maintained the fairly
informal style of the lecture theatre. At various points, the reader is invited to

x
Preface
check statements that are made: these are all routine, and follow in a few lines
from facts given in the lectures. There are also exercises at the end of each
lecture; the answers to all the exercises are contained in the references that
are speciﬁed. We hope that readers will work through the exercises as a step
towards the gaining of familiarity with the subject.
There are various cross-references between the sets of lectures; indeed topics
of one set of lectures often reappear, perhaps in a different guise, in other
lectures. All the book depends somewhat on the ﬁrst six chapters, and Part V
follows from Part IV. However, otherwise the various parts of the book can be
read independently. The references to each set of lectures are contained at the
end of the relevant part of this book, and not at the end of the whole book.
However, there are two indices for the whole book at the end (pp. 319–326):
these are the symbol index and the index of terms.
Some attempt has been made to make the notation consistent between the
various sets of lectures, but we have not always achieved this; we give a resum´e
of some standard notations at the end of this preface.
We very much enjoyed giving the original lectures and discussing the theory
and associated examples in the classes that were given in the same week as the
lectures. We hope that you enjoy reading them and, especially, working through
the examples.
In rather more detail, we expect the reader to be familiar with the following
topics:
r the deﬁnition of a Banach space and a locally convex space, weak topologies
on dual spaces;
r standard theorems of functional analysis such as the Hahn–Banach theorem,
closed graph theorem, open mapping theorem, and uniform boundedness
theorem;
r the theory of bounded linear operators on a Banach space, duals of such
operators, compact operators;
r the elementary theory of Hilbert spaces;
r undergraduate complex analysis, including Liouville’s theorem;
r undergraduate algebra, including the theory of ideals, modules, and homo-
morphisms.

Z = {0, ±1, ±2, . . .};

Deﬁnitions and examples
1.1 Deﬁnitions
A Banach algebra is ﬁrst of all an algebra. We start with an algebra A and
put a topology on A to make the algebraic operations continuous – in fact, the
topology is given by a norm.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1
Let E be a linear space. A norm on E is a map ∥· ∥: E →R
such that:
(i) ∥x∥≥0 (x ∈E) ; ∥x∥= 0 if and only if x = 0 ;
(ii) ∥αx∥= |α| ∥x∥
(α ∈C, x ∈E) ;
(iii) ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥
(x, y ∈E) .
Then (E, ∥· ∥) is a normed space. It is a Banach space if every Cauchy sequence
converges, i.e., if ∥· ∥is complete.
Deﬁnition 1.1.2
Let A be an algebra. An algebra norm on A is a map ∥· ∥:
A →R such that (A, ∥· ∥) is a normed space, and, further:
(iv) ∥ab∥≤∥a∥∥b∥
(a, b ∈A) .
The normed algebra (A, ∥· ∥) is a Banach algebra if ∥· ∥is a complete norm.
In Chapters 1–7, we shall usually suppose that a Banach algebra A is unital:
this means that A has an identity eA and that ∥eA∥= 1. Let A be a Banach
algebra with identity. Then, by moving to an equivalent norm, we may suppose
that A is unital. It is easy to check that, for each normed algebra A, the map
(a, b) →ab, A × A →A, is continuous.

1.2 Examples
Let us give some elementary examples.
(i) Let S be any non-empty set. Then CS is the set of functions from S into
C. Deﬁne pointwise algebraic operations by
(αf + βg)(s) = αf (s) + βg(s) ,
( f g)(s) = f (s)g(s) ,
1(s) = 1 ,
for each s ∈S, each f, g ∈CS, and each α, β ∈C. Then CS is a commutative,
unital algebra. We write ℓ∞(S) for the subset of bounded functions on S, and
deﬁne the uniform norm | · |S on S by
| f |S = sup{| f (s)| : s ∈S}
( f ∈ℓ∞(S)) .
Check that (ℓ∞(S), | · |S) is a unital Banach algebra.
(ii) Let X be a topological space (e.g., think of X = R). We write C(X)
for the algebra of all continuous functions on X, and Cb(X) for the algebra
of bounded, continuous functions on X. Check that (Cb(X), | · |X) is a unital
Banach algebra.
Now take 
 to be a compact space (e.g., 
 = I = [0, 1]). Then we have
Cb(
) = C(
), and so (C(
), | · |
) is a unital Banach algebra. This is a very
important example.
(iii) Let D = {z ∈C : |z| < 1}, the open unit disc. The disc algebra is
A(D) = { f ∈C(D) : f is analytic on D} .
Check that A(D) is a unital Banach algebra. (You just have to show that A(D)
is closed in C(D): why is this?)
Each f ∈A(D) has a Taylor expansion about the origin:
f =

.
Here Z is the coordinate functional, so that Z : z →z on C. Some functions
in A(D) have the further property that

(Are there any functions f in A(D) without this property?) The subset of func-
tions with this extra property is called A+(D). Check that A+(D) is a unital
Banach algebra for the norm ∥· ∥1, where
∥f ∥1 =

(iv) Let X be a compact set in the space Cn. Then P(X) is the family of func-
tions that are the uniform limits on X of the restrictions to X of the polynomials
(in n-variables). Check that (P(X), | · |X) is a unital Banach algebra. In fact,
A(D) = P(D).Weshallalsobeinterestedin P(T),whereT = {z ∈C : |z| = 1}
is the unit circle.
(v) Let X be a compact set in the complex plane C (or in Cn). Then A(X) is the
closed subalgebra of (C(X), | · |X) consisting of the functions which are analytic
on the interior of X, int X. Clearly A(X) = C(X) if and only if int X = ∅. Also
R(X) is the family of functions on X which are the uniform limits on X of the
restrictions to X of the rational functions: these are functions of the form p/q,
where p and q are polynomials and 0 /∈q(X). Clearly we have
P(X) ⊂R(X) ⊂A(X) ⊂C(X) .
The question of the equality of various of these algebras encapsulates much of
the classical theory of approximation.
(vi) Let n ∈N. Then C(n)(I) consists of the functions f on I such that f has
n derivatives on I and f (n) ∈C(I). Check that C(n)(I) is a Banach algebra for
the pointwise operations and the norm
∥f ∥n =
n

k=0

k!| f (k)|I
( f ∈C(n)(I)) .
(vii) Let E and F be linear spaces. Then L(E, F) is the collection of all
linear maps from E to F; it is itself a linear space for the standard operations.
Now let E and F be Banach spaces. Then B(E, F) is the family of all bounded
(i.e., continuous) linear operators from E to F; it is a subspace of L(E, F) and
B(E, F) is itself a Banach space for the operator norm given by
∥T ∥= sup{∥T x∥: x ∈E, ∥x∥≤1} .
We write L(E) and B(E) for L(E, E) and B(E, E), respectively. The product
of two operators S and T in L(E) is given by composition:
(ST )(x) = (S ◦T )(x) = S(T x)
(x ∈E) .

6
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Then trivially ∥ST ∥≤∥S∥∥T ∥(S, T ∈B(E)), and (B(E), ∥· ∥) is a unital
Banach algebra; the identity of B(E) is the identity operator IE. This is our ﬁrst
non-commutative example.
For example, let E be the ﬁnite-dimensional space Cn (say with the Euclidean
norm ∥· ∥2). Then L(E) = B(E) is just the algebra Mn = Mn(C) of all n × n
matrices over C (with the usual identiﬁcations).
(viii) The algebra C[[X]] of formal power series in one variable consists of
sequences
(αn : n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) ,
where αn ∈C, with coordinatewise linear operations and the product
(αr)(βs) = (γn) ,
where γn = 
r+s=n αrβs. It helps to think of elements of C[[X]] as formal
series of the form
∞

n=0
αn Xn ,
with the product suggested by the symbolism. This algebra contains as a sub-
algebra the algebra C[X] of polynomials in one variable – these polynomials
correspond to the sequences (αn) that are eventually zero.
A weight on Z+ is a function ω : Z+ →R+ \ {0} such that ω(0) = 1 and
ω(m + n) ≤ω(m)ω(n)
(m, n ∈Z+) .
Check that ωn = e−n and ωn = e−n2 deﬁne weights on Z+. For such a weight
ω, deﬁne
ℓ1(ω) =

(αn) ∈C[[X]] : ∥α∥ω =
∞

n=0
|αn| ωn < ∞

.
Check that ℓ1(ω) is a subalgebra of C[[X]], and that (ℓ1(ω), ∥· ∥ω) is a com-
mutative, unital Banach algebra.
(viii) Let G be a group, and let
ℓ1(G) =

f ∈CG : ∥f ∥1 =

s∈G
| f (s)| < ∞

.

1
Deﬁnitions and examples
7
Then (ℓ1(G), ∥· ∥1) is a Banach space. We can think of an element of ℓ1(G) as

s∈G
αsδs ,
where  |αs| < ∞; here δs(s) = 1 and δs(t) = 0 (t ̸= s).
We deﬁne a product on ℓ1(G) that is not the pointwise product; it is denoted
by ⋆and is sometimes called convolution multiplication. In this multiplication,
δs ⋆δt = δst
(s, t ∈G) ,
where st is the product in G. (Actually this formula deﬁnes the product.) Thus
( f ⋆g)(t) =

{ f (r)g(s) : rs = t}
(t ∈G) .
(1.2.1)
Check that ℓ1(G) is a unital Banach algebra for this product and the norm ∥· ∥1.
It is commutative if and only if G is an abelian group. Special case: take G = Z,
a group with respect to addition.
(ix) (Strictly, this example needs the theory of the Lebesgue integral on R.)
The Banach space L 1(R) has the norm ∥· ∥1 given by
∥f ∥1 =
 ∞
−∞
| f (t)| dt .
For functions f, g ∈L 1(R), deﬁne their convolution product f ⋆g by
( f ⋆g)(t) =
 ∞
−∞
f (t −s)g(s)ds
(t ∈R) .
Integration theory shows that f ⋆g is deﬁned almost everywhere (a.e.) and
that f ⋆g gives an element of L 1(R); further, ∥f ⋆g∥1 ≤∥f ∥1 ∥g∥1, and so
we obtain a commutative Banach algebra (which does not have an identity).
This example is central to the theory of Fourier transforms.
(x) Let U be a non-empty, open set in C (or in Cn). Then H(U) denotes the
set of analytic (or holomorphic) functions on U. Clearly H(U) is an algebra for
the pointwise operations. However the algebra H(U) is not a Banach algebra.
For each compact subset K of U, deﬁne
pK( f ) = | f |K
( f ∈H(U)) .
Then each pK is an algebra seminorm on H(U). The space H(U) is a Fr´echet
space with respect to the family of these seminorms; in this topology, fn →f
if and only if ( fn) converges to f uniformly on compact subsets of U. The
algebra is a Fr´echet algebra because pK( f g) ≤pK( f )pK(g) in each case.

1.3 Philosophy of why we study Banach algebras
There are several reasons why we study Banach algebras. They:
r cover many examples;
r have an abstract approach that leads to clear, quick proofs and new insights;
r blend algebra and analysis;
r have beautiful results on intrinsic structure.
1.4 Basic properties
We begin our study of general Banach algebras by considering invertible ele-
ments in such algebras.
Deﬁnition 1.4.1
Let A be a unital algebra. An element a ∈A is invertible if
there exists an element b ∈A with ab = ba = eA. The element b is unique; it
is called the inverse of a, and written a−1. The set of invertible elements of A
is denoted by InvA.
Check that a, b ∈InvA ⇒ab ∈InvA and (ab)−1 = b−1a−1.
Now let (A, ∥· ∥) be a unital Banach algebra. Check that, for each a ∈A, we
have
lim
n→∞∥an∥1/n = inf{∥an∥1/n : n ∈N} ≤∥a∥.
Theorem 1.4.2
Let (A, ∥· ∥) be a unital Banach algebra.
(i) Suppose that a ∈A and lim ∥an∥1/n < 1. Then eA −a ∈InvA.
(ii) InvA ⊃{b ∈A : ∥eA −b∥< 1}.
(iii) InvA is an open subset of A.
(iv) The map a →a−1,
InvA →InvA, is continuous.
Proof (i) The series eA + ∞
n=1 an converges to (eA −a)−1.
(ii) This is immediate from (i).
(iii) Take a ∈InvA, and then take b ∈A with ∥b∥< ∥a−1∥−1. Note that
a −b = a(eA −a−1b) and ∥a−1b∥< 1. By (i), eA −a−1b ∈InvA. Hence
a −b ∈InvA.

Then F´ejer’s theorem says that: for each f ∈C(T), σn( f ) →f uniformly
on T.
Deduce that the following are equivalent for f ∈C(T) :
(a) f ∈P(T) ;
(b) f = F | T for some F ∈A(D) ;
(c) f (−k) = 0 (k ∈N) .
We can now identify A(D) with P(T) (why?), and regard A(D) as a closed
subalgebra of C(T) – if we should wish to do this!

later chapters.
1.6 Additional notes
1. By an algebra A, we always mean a linear space over C together with
a multiplication such that a(bc) = (ab)c, a(b + c) = ab + ac, (a + b)c =
ac + bc, and α(ab) = (αa)b = a(αb) for a, b, c ∈A and α ∈C. The alge-
bra has an identity eA if eAa = aeA = a (a ∈A). Suppose that A does not
have an identity. Then A# = C ⊙A is a unital algebra for the product
(α, a)(β, b) = (αβ, αb + βa + ab)
(α, β ∈C, a, b ∈A) ;
if A is a Banach algebra, then so is A# for the norm ∥(α, a)∥= |α| + ∥a∥.
2. For f ∈CS, deﬁne f (s) = f (s), the complex conjugate of f (s). Then the
map f →f is an involution on CS and on C(
). Check that | f |2

 = | f f |
in the latter case. The algebra C(
) with this involution is the canonical
example of a commutative, unital C∗-algebra; see §3.5.
3. Let 
 be a locally compact space (e.g., R). For a continuous function f on

, supp f , the support of f , is the closure of the set {x ∈
 : f (x) ̸= 0}. We
write C00(
) for the algebra of functions of compact support, and C0(
) for

11
the algebra of functions f that vanish at inﬁnity, i.e., {x ∈
 : | f (x)| ≥ε}
is compact for each ε > 0. Check that (C0(
), | · |
) is a Banach algebra. Is
(C00(
), | · |
) also a Banach algebra? Is it dense in (C0(
), | · |
)?
4. A closed, unital subalgebra A of an algebra (C(
), | · |
) such that, for
each x, y ∈
 with x ̸= y there exists f ∈A with f (x) ̸= f (y), is called a
uniform algebra.
5. In the text, we deﬁned ℓ1(G) for a group G. Check that the construction
(with the product being deﬁned in (1.2.1)) also works for a semigroup S
instead of G – save that ℓ1(S) is unital only if S has an identity.
6. There is a common generalization of L1(R) and ℓ1(G). Each locally compact
group G has a left Haar measure m, and L1(G), consisting of measurable
functions f on G with
∥f ∥1 =

G
| f (t)| dm(t) < ∞,
becomes a Banach algebra for the product
( f ⋆g)(t) =

G
f (s)g(s−1t) dm(s) .
This is the group algebra of G. Note that G need not be abelian. See Part II
7. There is no norm ∥· ∥on H(U) such that (H(U), ∥· ∥) is a Banach algebra:
see Dales (2000, 5.2.33(ii)).

The disc algebra is utilized in Part III, Theorem 14.12. All the examples are
given in substantial detail in Dales (2000). See, for example, Dales (2000,
§2.1). Uniform algebras and group algebras are discussed in §4.3 and §3.3
of Dales (2000), respectively. The group algebras L 1(G) are a main topic of
Part II of this book; for the related measure algebra M(G), see Proposition
9.1.2. For the theory of topological algebras, including Fr´echet algebras, see
Dales (2000, §2.2).

Ideals and the spectrum
We now establish some basic results about Banach algebras. A key idea is that
of the spectrum of an element. Throughout A is a unital algebra with identity eA.
It is pleasing to see, ﬁrst, that the basic ideas of our subject can be proved so
quickly, and that the proofs are an attractive blend of basic results from complex
analysis and functional analysis.
2.1 The spectrum
Let us ﬁrst look at the spectrum of an element in a Banach algebra. The concept
generalizes that of the eigenvalues of a matrix.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1
Let A be a unital algebra, and let a ∈A. The resolvent set
of a is
ρA(a) = {z ∈C : zeA −a ∈InvA} ;
the spectrum of a is σA(a), the complement of ρA(a) in C, so that
σA(a) = C \ ρA(a) ;
the resolvent function of a is the function
Ra : z →(zeA −a)−1,
ρA(a) →InvA .
Usually we write ρ(a) for ρA(a), etc.
We shall use the following, easily checked identity: for each z, w ∈ρ(a), we
have
Ra(w) −Ra(z) = (z −w)Ra(z)Ra(w) .
(2.1.1)
12

2
Ideals and the spectrum
13
Now suppose that A is a Banach algebra, and let a ∈A. It follows from
Theorem 1.4.2(ii) that
σ(a) ⊂{z ∈C : |z| ≤∥a∥} .
Deﬁnition 2.1.2
Let A be a unital algebra, and let a ∈A. The spectral radius
of a is
νA(a) = ν(a) = sup{|z| : z ∈σ(a)} .
The element a is quasi-nilpotent if ν(a) = 0 (i.e., σ(a) = {0} or σ(a) = ∅); the
set of quasi-nilpotents is denoted by Q(A).
Check that, if a is nilpotent (i.e., an = 0 for some n ∈N), then a ∈Q(A);
for T ∈B(Cn) = L(Cn) ∼= Mn, the spectrum of the matrix T is the (ﬁnite)
set of eigenvalues of T ;
for f ∈C(
), σ( f ) is equal to f (
), the range of f , and ν( f ) = | f |
, so
that the only quasi-nilpotent in C(
) is 0.
The following is the key basic theorem of our subject.
Proposition 2.1.3
Let A be a unital Banach algebra, and let a ∈A.
(i) The resolvent set ρ(a) is open in C.
(ii) For each λ ∈A′, the function λ ◦Ra is analytic on ρ(a).
(iii) The spectrum σ(a) is compact and non-empty.
(iv) For each n ∈N and r > ν(a), we have
an =
1
2πi

|ζ|=r
ζ n(ζeA −a)−1 dζ .
(v) ν(a) = limn→∞∥an∥1/n.
Proof (i) The map
θ : z →zeA −a,
C →A ,
is continuous, and InvA is open. So the set ρ(a) = θ−1(InvA) is open in C.
(ii) Fix z ∈ρ(a), and let w ∈ρ(a) \ {z}. Set f = λ ◦Ra. Then
f (w) −f (z)
w −z
= λ
	 Ra(w) −Ra(z)
w −z

= λ(−Ra(w)Ra(z))
→−λ(Ra(z)2)
as w →z ,
using 1.4.2(iv). Thus f is analytic on ρ(a).

14
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
(iii) By (i), the spectrum σ(a) is closed. We know that σ(a) is bounded. So
σ(a) is compact.
Assume towards a contradiction that σ(a) = ∅. Take λ ∈A′. By (ii), the
function λ ◦Ra is entire. But
Ra(z) = z−1(eA −z−1a)−1 →0
as |z| →∞.
By Liouville’s theorem, λ ◦Ra = 0. Hence λ(Ra(0)) = 0. This is true for each
λ ∈A′, and so Ra(0) = 0 by the Hahn–Banach theorem. But this is a contra-
diction. Thus σ(a) is non-empty.
(iv) For r > ∥a∥, the series ∞
k=0 ak/zk+1 is uniformly convergent to
(zeA −a)−1 on {z ∈C : |z| = r}, and so the equation holds for this value of r.
Since Ra is analytic on ρ(a), the equation holds for all r > ν(a) by Cauchy’s
theorem.
(v) Let z ∈σ(a) and n ∈N. We check easily that zn ∈σ(an). Hence we have
|z|n ≤∥an∥, and so ν(a) ≤inf ∥an∥1/n.
Take r > ν(a), and set Mr = sup{∥Ra(z)∥: |z| = r}. Then, by (iv), we have
∥an∥≤rn+1Mr
(n ∈N) .
This shows that lim sup ∥an∥1/n ≤r. The result follows.
□
Part (iii) of the above result is the fundamental theorem of Banach algebras;
part (v) is the spectral radius formula.
Consequences: a ∈Q(A) if and only if ∥an∥1/n →0;
an →0 as n →∞
if and only if
ν(a) < 1 .
Example
Let A = ℓ1(ω) ⊂C[[X]] for a weight ω. Then ∥Xn∥= ωn and
ν(X) = lim
n→∞ω1/n
n
.
So X is quasi-nilpotent if and only if ω1/n
n
→0 as n →∞; this is the case
when ωn = exp(−n2), for example.
Recall that a unital algebra A is a division algebra if InvA = A \ {0}.
Theorem 2.1.4
(Gelfand–Mazur) Let A be a unital normed algebra which is
a division algebra. Then A = CeA.
Proof Deﬁne θ : z →zeA, C →A. Then θ is a monomorphism. Take a ∈A.
By Proposition 2.1.3(iii), σ(a) ̸= ∅(see the additional notes for the case where

2
Ideals and the spectrum
15
A is not a Banach algebra), and so there exists z ∈C with zeA −a /∈InvA. By
hypothesis, InvA = A \ {0}. Hence θ(z) = a, and θ is a surjection.
□
2.2 Ideals and the radical
Let A be an algebra. For subsets S and T of A, we write
S · T = {ab : a ∈S, b ∈T }
and
ST =

n

j=1
α ja jb j : α j ∈C, a j ∈S, b j ∈T

,
so that ST = lin S · T , where ‘lin’ denotes the linear span. We write S[2] for
S · S and S 2 for lin S[2]. A linear subspace I of A is a left ideal if AI ⊂A,
and an ideal if AI ∪I A ⊂I. A left ideal M is maximal if M ̸= A and if there
are no left ideals I with M ⊆
/ I ⊆
/ A. Every left ideal is contained in a maximal
left ideal (in the case where A is unital).
For an ideal I in A, A/I is the quotient algebra: of course,
(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I
(a, b ∈A) .
Check that, if A is a normed [Banach] algebra, and I is a closed ideal in A, then
A/I is a normed [Banach] algebra for the quotient norm.
Example
Let 
 be a compact space, with a closed subset F. Deﬁne:
I(F) = { f ∈C(
) : f | F = 0} ;
J(F) = { f ∈C(
) : f = 0 on a neighbourhood of F} .
Check that I(F) and J(F) are ideals in C(
), that I(F) is closed, and that J(F)
is dense in I(F). When is I(F) a maximal ideal?
Proposition 2.2.1
Let A be a unital Banach algebra.
(i) Let I be a [left] ideal in A. Then I is also a [left] ideal in A.
(ii) Let M be a maximal [left] ideal in A. Then M is closed.
Proof (i) This is immediately checked.
(ii) Set I = M. Assume that I = A. It follows from Proposition 1.4.2(iii)
that we have M ∩InvA ̸= ∅, a contradiction of the fact that M ̸= A. Hence
I = M because M is maximal.
□

16
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
The radical of an algebra A is deﬁned to be the intersection of the maximal
left ideals of A#; it is denoted by rad A. A (necessarily non-unital) algebra A
is radical if rad A = A. The algebra A is semisimple if rad A = {0}. It is easily
checked that, in the unital case,
rad A = {a ∈A : eA −ba ∈InvA
(b ∈A)} .
In fact rad A is an ideal in A, and A/rad A is a semisimple algebra.
Proposition 2.2.2
Let A be a unital Banach algebra. Then rad A is a closed
ideal and A/rad A is a semisimple Banach algebra.
□
Some people think that semisimple Banach algebras are ‘good’, and rad A is
the ‘bad’ bit; we should like to remove the bad bit by writing
A = (A/rad A) ⊕rad A
in some sense (but this is not always possible).
Proposition 2.2.3
Let A be a unital Banach algebra.
(i) rad A ⊂Q(A).
(ii) Suppose that I is a left ideal of A with I ⊂Q(A). Then I ⊂rad A.
(iii) In the case where A is commutative, rad A = Q(A).
Proof (i) Let a ∈rad A. Then eA −a/z ∈InvA for all z ̸= 0, and so we have
σ(a) = {0}.
(ii) Let a ∈I. For each b ∈A, ba ∈I because I is a left ideal. So ba ∈Q(A)
by (i) and eA −ba ∈InvA. Hence a ∈rad A.
(iii) Take a ∈Q(A) and b ∈A. We have (ba)n = bnan (n ∈N) because A
is commutative, and so
∥(ba)n∥1/n = ∥bnan∥1/n ≤∥b∥∥an∥1/n →0
as n →∞.
Hence ν(ba) = 0 and ba ∈Q(A). Thus Q(A) is an ideal, so that Q(A) = rad A
by (i) and (ii).
□
For example, the commutative Banach algebra C(
) is semisimple.
Notation: for a Banach space E, and for x0 ∈E and λ0 ∈E′, we deﬁne
x0 ⊗λ0 ∈B(E) by
x0 ⊗λ0 : x →⟨x, λ0⟩x0,
E→E .

2
Ideals and the spectrum
17
These maps show that, given x0, y0 ∈E \ {0}, there exists S ∈B(E) such that
Sx0 = y0. An operator T ∈B(E) is ﬁnite-rank if T (E) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Each ﬁnite-rank operator is a linear combination of rank-one operators of the
form x0 ⊗λ0 (where x0 ∈E and λ0 ∈E′). The collection of ﬁnite-rank opera-
tors on E is denoted by F(E); it is clearly an ideal in B(E).
Proposition 2.2.4
Let E be a non-zero Banach space. Then B(E) is semi-
simple.
Proof
Take T ̸= 0 in B(E). There exist x0, y0 ∈E \ {0} with T x0 = y0.
Choose S ∈B(E) with Sy0 = x0. Then clearly (IE −ST )x0 = 0, and so
IE −ST /∈Inv B(E). Hence T /∈rad B(E), and so rad B(E) = {0}.
□
However, the algebra B(E) contains many non-zero nilpotent operators, and
hence rad B(E) ̸= Q(B(E)).
Let E be a Banach space. An operator T ∈B(E) is compact if T (E[1])
is compact in E, where E[1] denotes the closed unit ball of E. The collection
K(E) of compact operators is a closed ideal in B(E). Clearly F(E) ⊂K(E); the
closure A(E) = F(E) of F(E) in B(E) is the ideal of approximable operators.
For many Banach spaces, we have A(E) = K(E) (technically, this is true at
least when E has the approximation property), but Banach spaces E such that
A(E) ⊆
/ K(E) are known.
In many ways, the ideal K(E) is the natural ‘inﬁnite-dimensional’ gen-
eralization of the algebras Mn of all n × n matrices over C. (Of course,
K(E) = B(E) = Mn when the Banach space E has ﬁnite dimension n.) It was
an early achievement of functional analysis to fully analyse the spectrum of a
compact operator.
Theorem 2.2.5
Let E be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space, and suppose
that T ∈K(E). Then:
(i) σ(T ) is a countable compact set of the form {zn : n ∈N} ∪{0}, where
{zn : n ∈N} is either ﬁnite or a sequence which converges to 0;
(ii) each z ∈σ(T ) \ {0} is an eigenvalue of T , and the corresponding
eigenspace {x ∈E : T x = zx} is ﬁnite-dimensional;
(iii) for each z ∈C \ {0}, the subspace (zIE −T )(E) is closed in E and
dim ker(zIE −T ) = dim(E/(zIE −T )(E)) ,
so that, in particular, zIE −T is surjective if and only if it is injective.

1. Let B be a closed subalgebra of A with eA ∈B. Let a ∈A. Show that

2. Let a ∈A. Show that there is a maximal (with respect to inclusion) com-

3. Let a ∈A, and let U be an open neighbourhood of σ(a) in C. Show that there
exists δ > 0 such that σ(b) ⊂U whenever b ∈A with ∥a −b∥< δ. (This

.
Show that C((X)) is a ﬁeld (use the identiﬁcation of Inv C[[X]]); it is the
quotient ﬁeld of C[[X]], called the Laurent ﬁeld (why?). Show that it is not
a normed algebra for any norm.
It can be shown that C[[X]] is not a Banach algebra for any norm. (This
is quite hard.) Is it obvious whether or not it is a normed algebra for some
norm?
5. Let a, b ∈A. Show that σ(ab) and σ(ba) differ by at most the point 0. (Hint:
if c inverts eA −ab, consider eA + bca.) Calculate σ(L), σ(R), σ(L R), and
σ(RL) when R and L are, respectively, the right and left shifts on the usual
Banach space ℓ1(N).
6. Let M be the operator (αn) →(αn/(n + 1)) on ℓ2, and let R be the right
shift operator. Set T = M R. Prove that T is compact and that σ(T ) = {0}.
Does T have any eigenvalues? Calculate ∥T n∥for n ∈N, and check that
limn→∞∥T n∥1/n = 0. (For these operators, and many others, see Part IV.)
7. Take A = ℓ1(ω) for the weight ω = (ωn), where ωn = e−n2
(n ∈Z+).
Show that
rad A = {(αn) : α0 = 0}
and
InvA = {(αn) : α0 ̸= 0} .
In particular, the commutative, unital Banach algebra A is not semisimple.

the spectral radius ν(u). Deduce that V is a radical Banach algebra.

Ideals and the spectrum

2.4 Additional notes
1. The deﬁnition of spectrum, etc., makes sense for an arbitrary unital algebra.
For example, calculate σ(X) for the algebra A = C[[X]]. Let H(C) be the
algebra of entire functions on C. What are the possibilities for σ( f ) when
f ∈H(C)?
2. Let A be a normed algebra. Then A has a completion, say B (Bonsall and
Duncan 1973, 1.12; Dales 2000, §2.1). Clearly σB(a) ⊂σA(a) for a ∈A. So
σA(a) ̸= ∅for each a ∈A even for a normed algebra A.
3. Suppose that A is not unital. Then σA(a) is deﬁned to be the spectrum of
(0, a) in C ⊙A = A#. The spectrum can also be deﬁned directly by using
quasi-inverses (Bonsall and Duncan 2000, §3; Dales 2000, 1.3.4): this is
actually quite important.
4. When A is non-unital, you must deal with maximal modular ideals, rather
than maximal ideals. A left ideal I in A is modular if there exists u ∈A such
that a −au ∈I for each a ∈A.
5. Our radical is strictly the Jacobson radical. There are many other radicals of
an algebra, but the Jacobson radical is certainly the most important one for
Banach algebra theory. For the algebraic theory of radA, see Dales (2000,
§1.5).
6. For §2.1, see Rudin (1973, Chapter 10) and Dales (2000, §2.3). For §2.2,
see Bonsall and Duncan (1973, Chapter 3) and Dales (2000, §2.3). For the
properties of B(E) and K(E) as Banach algebras, see Dales (2000, §2.5);
for individual operators, see the later chapters. Compact operators are ex-
tensively discussed in Part III.

The wonderful ‘Gelfand theory’ of commutative Banach algebras was laid down
by Gelfand in (1941), more than 60 years ago. We still essentially follow the
route of the master.
3.1 Characters
Deﬁnition 3.1.1
Let A be an algebra. A character on A is an epimorphism
ϕ : A →C.
Thus a character ϕ is a non-zero linear functional on A such that
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b)
(a, b ∈A) .
(Characters are sometimes called multiplicative linear functionals.) We write
A for the set of all characters on A; A is called the character space of A. If
A has an identity eA, then clearly ϕ(eA) = 1 (ϕ ∈A).
Example
Let A = C(
) and εx0( f ) = f (x0) ( f ∈A) for some x0 ∈
. Then
εx0 ∈A.
Let A be an algebra, and let ϕ ∈A. We write
Mϕ = ker ϕ = {a ∈A : ϕ(a) = 0} .
Proposition 3.1.2
Let A be a unital algebra. Then the map ϕ →Mϕ is a
bijection from A onto the set of maximal ideals of codimension 1 in A.
Proof Clearly each Mϕ is a maximal ideal of codimension 1.
Suppose that Mϕ = Mψ. Then ϕ = ψ because ϕ(eA) = ψ(eA).

Gelfand theory
21
Let M be a maximal ideal of codimension 1. Then the quotient map
ϕ : A →A/M = C
is a character with Mϕ = M.
□
Now let A be a unital Banach algebra. The next (easy) result is the key to
much of Banach algebra theory.
Theorem 3.1.3
Let ϕ ∈A. Then ϕ is continuous and ∥ϕ∥= 1.
Proof
First proof. The maximal ideal Mϕ is closed by Proposition 2.2.1(ii),
and so ϕ is continuous.
Second proof. Assume towards a contradiction that there exists a ∈A such
that ∥a∥< 1 and |ϕ(a)| = 1. By replacing a by a/ϕ(a), we can suppose that
ϕ(a) = 1. By Theorem 1.4.2(i), there exists b ∈A with b(eA −a) = eA. We
have
ϕ(b) −ϕ(b)ϕ(a) = ϕ(eA)
because ϕ is a homomorphism. But ϕ(a) = ϕ(eA) = 1, and so we have a
contradiction. Thus ϕ is continuous and ∥ϕ∥≤1. Since ϕ(eA) = 1, we have
∥ϕ∥= 1.
□
We thus see that A is a subset of the space
{λ ∈A′ : λ(eA) = 1 = ∥λ∥} ,
which is called the state space of A.
The weak-∗topology on A′ is denoted by σ = σ(A′, A), so that λν →λ in
(A′, σ) if and only if λν(a) →λ(a) for each a ∈A. Recall that the unit ball of
A′, written A′
[1], is weak-∗compact. The space A is taken to have the relative
weak-∗topology from A′: we shall call it the Gelfand topology.
Take a ∈A. We deﬁne a on A′ by
a(λ) = λ(a)
(λ ∈A′) .
The deﬁnition of the weak-∗topology shows immediately that a is continuous
on (A′, σ).
Theorem 3.1.4
The space A is compact (in the weak-∗topology).

Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Proof For each a, b ∈A, deﬁne
Ka,b =

λ ∈A′ : λ(ab) = λ(a)λ(b)

;
also deﬁne KeA =

λ ∈A′ : λ(eA) = 1

. Then each Ka,b and the set KeA are
all compact in A′ [why?], and clearly
A =

{Ka,b : a, b ∈A} ∩KeA .
Thus A is compact.
□
We now regarda as being deﬁned on A; for each a ∈A, we havea ∈C(A)
and |a|A ≤∥a∥.
For a general Banach algebra, the character space A may be empty; it does
not have a signiﬁcant role. But we shall now see that it is highly signiﬁcant for
commutative Banach algebras.
3.2 Gelfand theory
Throughout this subsection A is a commutative, unital Banach algebra.
Proposition 3.2.1
Every maximal ideal of A has the form Mϕ for some
ϕ ∈A.
Proof By Proposition 3.1.2, we must show each maximal ideal M of A has co-
dimension 1. We know that M is closed, and so A/M is a Banach algebra. But, in
a commutative algebra, A/M is a ﬁeld (this is a commutative division algebra).
By the Gelfand–Mazur theorem, 2.1.4, A/M = C, and so indeed we have
dim(A/M) = 1.
□
Thus A corresponds to the set of maximal ideals of A; for this reason A
is sometimes called the maximal ideal space of A.
Recall that C(A) is a Banach algebra for the uniform norm on A.
Theorem 3.2.2
(Gelfand representation theorem) Let A be a commutative,
unital Banach algebra. Then:
(i) the map G : a →a, A →C(A), is a norm-decreasing homomorphism;
(ii) σ(a) = a(A) = {a(ϕ) : ϕ ∈A};
(iii) νA(a) = |a|A;
(iv) a ∈InvA if and only if a ∈InvC(A);
(v) rad A = Q(A) = ker G.

3
Gelfand theory
23
Proof We show that (ii) holds. Indeed,
z ∈σ(a) ⇔zeA −a /∈InvA
⇔zeA −a belongs to some maximal ideal
⇔zeA −a ∈Mϕ for some ϕ ∈A
⇔z = ϕ(a) for some ϕ ∈A
⇔z ∈a(A) .
The rest is immediately checked.
□
Corollary 3.2.3
The following are equivalent:
(a) A is semisimple;
(b) G is a monomorphism;
(c) ν is a norm on A.
□
Thus a semisimple, commutative, unital Banach algebra is identiﬁed as a
subalgebra of C(
) for the compact space 
 = A. Such algebras are called
Banach function algebras. Recall that there are commutative, unital Banach
algebras which are not semisimple.
3.3 Examples
Let A be a unital Banach function algebra contained in C(
) for some compact

. We suppose that, if x ̸= y in 
, then there exists f ∈A with f (x) ̸= f (y).
For x ∈
, deﬁne
εx( f ) = f (x)
( f ∈A) .
The functionals εx are the evaluation maps on A.
Lemma 3.3.1
The map η : x →εx, 
 →A, is an embedding.
Proof
Certainly εx ∈A. If εx = εy, then x = y. Thus the map η is an
injection.
Let xν →x0 in 
. Then f (xν) →f (x0) for each f ∈A, and so εxν →εx0
in A (for the weak-∗topology). Thus the map η is continuous, and so it is a
homeomorphism by an elementary result from topology.
□

Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Now regard 
 as a closed subset of A. We say that A is natural if 
 = A,
so that the only characters on A are the evaluation maps.
Notation: for f ∈C(
), we deﬁne
Z( f ) = {x ∈
 : f (x) = 0} ,
the zero set of f .
Proposition 3.3.2
Let A be a unital Banach function algebra on 
. Then A is
natural on 
 if and only if, given f1, . . . , fn ∈A with n
j=1 Z( f j) = ∅, there
exist g1, . . . , gn ∈A with
f1g1 + · · · + fngn = 1 .
(3.3.1)
Proof Take f1, . . . , fn ∈A, and set
I =
 n

j=1
fig j : g1, . . . , gn ∈A

,
an ideal in A.
Suppose that A is natural and n
j=1 Z( f j) = ∅. Then, for each ϕ ∈A, there
exists f j with f j(ϕ) ̸= 0. Hence I ̸⊂Mϕ for any ϕ. So I = A and there exist
g1, . . . , gn satisfying (3.3.1).
Conversely, suppose that A is not natural, so that there exists ϕ ∈A \ 
.
For each x ∈
, take fx ∈Mϕ with fx(x) = 1; we have fx(y) ̸= 0 for y in
a neighbourhood of x. By an elementary compactness argument, there exist
f1, . . . , fn ∈Mϕ with n
j=1 Z( f j) = ∅, and so there cannot exist g1, . . . , gn ∈A
to satisfy (3.3.1).
□
Corollary 3.3.3
For each compact space 
, the Banach function algebra
C(
) is natural.
Proof
Take f1, . . . , fn ∈C(
) with n
j=1 Z( f j) = ∅, and set
g =
n

j=1
f j f j =


j=1
| f j|2 ,
so that g(x) > 0 (x ∈
) and g ∈Inv C(
). Set g j = f jg−1 ( j = 1, . . . , n).
Then (3.3.1) is satisﬁed.

3.4 Commutative group algebras
We show here that, for commutative group algebras, the Gelfand transform
coincides with the well-known Fourier transform.
Let G be a locally compact abelian (or LCA) group. (Think of the cases
where G = Z or G = T or G = R.) A character on G is a group morphism
from G onto T. The set  of all continuous characters is itself an abelian group
with respect to pointwise multiplication
⟨s, γ1 + γ2⟩= ⟨s, γ1⟩⟨s, γ2⟩
(s ∈G, γ1, γ2 ∈) ,
where we write ⟨s, γ ⟩for γ (s). Let  have the topology of uniform convergence
on compact subsets of G: then  is also an LCA group, called the dual group of
G. The Pontryagin duality theorem asserts that the dual of  is G, in a natural
way.
For example: the dual of Z is T, in the sense that every continuous character
on Z has the form n →zn for some z ∈T; the dual of T is Z; and the dual of
R is R, but the dual group is best thought of as a ‘different copy of R’.
Let G be an LCA group. For f ∈L 1(G), the Fourier transform of f is f ,
deﬁned on  by the formula
f (γ ) =

G
f (s)⟨−s, γ ⟩dm(s)
(γ ∈) .
For example, in the case where G = T, we have already deﬁned f on Z in
Exercise 1.5.4. Now suppose that G = R. Then
f (y) =
 ∞
−∞
f (t) e−iyt dt
(y ∈R) .
In the general case, set
A() = {f : f ∈L 1(G)} ,
the range of the Fourier transform. The Riemann–Lebesgue Lemma shows that
A() ⊂C0() .
In fact, A() is a self-adjoint, translation-invariant, dense subalgebra of C0():
it is a Banach function algebra on the locally compact space .
Theorem 3.4.1
Let G be an LCA group. Then the Fourier transform
F : f →f ,
L 1(G) →A() ⊂C0() ,
is a continuous homomorphism with ∥F∥= 1.
□

26
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
We can now identify the character space of L 1(G) with the dual group  (so
that ‘characters on G’ correspond to ‘characters on L 1(G)’, and this is why the
two meanings of the word ‘character’ become somewhat blurred).
Theorem 3.4.2
Let G be an LCA group. Then each character on L 1(G) has
the form f →f (γ ) for some γ ∈. Thus A() is a natural Banach function
algebra on , the algebra L 1(G) is semisimple, and the Gelfand transform
coincides with the Fourier transform in this case.
□
3.5 C∗-algebras
Deﬁnition 3.5.1
An involution on an algebra A is a map ∗: A →A such
that:
(i) (αa + βb)∗= αa⋆+ βb⋆(a, b ∈A, α, β ∈C) ;
(ii) (a∗)∗= a (a ∈A) ;
(iii) (ab)∗= b∗a∗(a, b ∈A) .
Deﬁnition 3.5.2
A C∗-algebra is a Banach algebra A with an involution such
that
∥a∗a∥= ∥a∥2
(a ∈A) .
Examples
(i) The algebras C(
) are commutative, unital C∗-algebras for the
involution f →f .
(ii) Let H be a Hilbert space with inner product denoted by [ · , · ]. For
T ∈B(H), take T ∗to be the adjoint of T , deﬁned by the formula:
[T x, y] = [x, T ∗y]
(x, y ∈H) .
Then B(H) is a unital C∗-algebra for the involution T →T ∗.
(iii) Let A be a closed subalgebra of B(H) such that T ∗∈A whenever T ∈A
(so that A is ∗-closed). Then A is a C∗-algebra.
Let A be a commutative, unital, semisimple Banach algebra. We know that
the Gelfand transform embeds A in C(A). When is this map a surjection? The
answer is given by the (commutative) Gelfand–Naimark theorem.
Theorem 3.5.3
(Gelfand–Naimark) Let A be a commutative, unital C∗-
algebra. Then the Gelfand transform
a →a,
A →C(A) ,
is an isometric ∗-isomorphism.

Prove that the map F →k(h(F)) is a closure operation on the family of
Gelfand-closed subsets of A. The topology it deﬁnes is the hull-kernel

be Hausdorff. Prove that the hull-kernel topology coincides with the Gelfand
topology if and only if A is regular, in the sense that, for each closed subset
F of A and each ϕ ∈A \ F, there exists f ∈A with f (F) = {0} and
f (ϕ) = 1. Prove that the algebras C(

x →εx,
X →βX,
is continuous and has dense range. Every bounded, continuous function on
X has a continuous extension to βX.
3.7 Additional notes
1. In the case where A is a non-unital Banach algebra, we can only say that the
character space A is locally compact. The Gelfand representation is then
a homomorphism into C0(A). We have seen that this happens in the case
where A is L 1(R).
2. The proof of the commutative Gelfand–Naimark theorem 3.5.3 is now an
easy exercise. The (harder) non-commutative Gelfand–Naimark theorem
shows that every C∗-algebra is ∗-isomorphic to a closed, ∗-closed subalgebra
of B(H) for some Hilbert space H.
3. We proved very easily that every character on a Banach algebra is automat-
ically continuous. It is a remarkable fact that it has been an open question
for more than 50 years whether or not every character on a Fr´echet algebra
is continuous. This is called Michael’s problem. For the best partial results,

3
Gelfand theory
29
see Dixon and Esterle (1986). Beware of fallacious ‘proofs’ that appear in
the literature.
4. Let A be a Banach algebra. A bounded approxmiate identity in A is a net
(eα) in A such that supα ∥eα∥< ∞and
lim
α (∥a −eαa∥+ ∥a −aeα∥) = 0
(a ∈A) .
An important theorem of Cohen says that a Banach algebra A with a bounded
approximate identity factors, in the sense that A = A[2].
It is important to note that many Banach algebras which do not have an
identity do have a bounded approxmiate identity, and hence this factorization
property. For example, every group algebra L 1(G) and every C*-algebra
has a bounded approximate identity. For more on bounded approximate
identities, see Part II, Chapter 9.
5. Let A be a natural Banach function algebra. Then A is weakly regular if, for
each proper closed subspace F of A, there exists f ∈A with f ̸= 0 such
that F ⊂Z( f ), and A has the unique uniform norm property (UUNP) if A
admits exactly one uniform norm, namely the spectral radius νA( · ). For the
relationships between these properties and regularity, see Bhatt and Dedania
(2002).
6. Gelfand theory is covered in Rudin (1973, Chapter 11), Bonsall and Duncan
(1973, §17) and Dales (2000, §2.3), for example. There have been enormous
studies of the algebras A(). For a sample, see Dales (2000, §4.5); various
substantial texts on this topic are listed in the bibliography. See §9.3 of Part II
for more on the Fourier transform of L 1(G).
The general (non-commutative) Gelfand–Naimark theorem (involving the
GNS construction) is in all the books listed on C∗-algebras. For example,
look at Kadison and Ringrose (1983, §4.5). See also Dales (2000, 3.2.29).
A book discussing the Stone– ˇCech compactiﬁcation is Gillman and Jerison
(1960); see also Dales (2000, §4.2). Cohen’s factorization theorem for a
Banach algebra with a bounded approximate identity, and several important
generalizations, are given in Dales (2000, §2.9) and many other sources listed
in the references.

The functional calculus
In Exercise 3.6.7 we described a ‘continuous functional calculus’ a for a
normal element a of a C*-algebra A. We now replace A by an arbitrary Banach
algebra and obtain a weaker, but very important, ‘analytic functional calculus’.
But ﬁrst we need some more examples of character spaces.
4.1 More character spaces
Deﬁnition 4.1.1
Let X be a compact set in Cn. Then the polynomial convex
hull of X is
X = {z ∈Cn : |p(z)| ≤|p|X
for all polynomials p} .
Proposition 4.1.2
Let X be a compact set in Cn. Then P(X) = X.
Proof Let ϕ be a character on C[X1, . . . , Xn] (the algebra of polynomials in n
variables). Then ϕ(p) = p(z0) for some z0 = (ϕ(X1), . . . , ϕ(Xn)) ∈Cn. This
character extends to a (continuous) character on P(X) if and only if z0 ∈X.
The result follows.
□
For a general compact set X in Cn, it can be difﬁcult to identify X. However,
it is quite easy to show that, for X ⊂C, the polynomially convex hull X is the
union of X and the bounded components of C \ X. Indeed, let V be a bounded
component of C \ X, and let z ∈V . Then, for each polynomial p ∈C[X], we
have |p(z)| ≤|p|∂V by the maximum modulus principle. But ∂V ⊂X, and so
|p(z)| ≤|p|X, whence z ∈X. The converse is also fairly easy.
For example P(T) = D, so P(T) really sits on D, not on T. Indeed P(T) is
isometrically isomorphic to A(D).

The functional calculus
31
Proposition 4.1.3
The Banach function algebra A+(D) is natural.
Proof Let A = A+(D). Then A is polynomially generated by Z. It is easy to
check that σ(Z) = D. So A+(D) is natural by Exercise 3.6.5.
□
This shows that, if f ∈A+(D) and f (z) ̸= 0 (z ∈D), then 1/f also belongs
to A+(D); this is not obvious just from the deﬁnition of A+(D).
Recall that ℓ1(Z) (with convolution product) and W(T) (with pointwise prod-
uct) are isomorphic; they are the ‘same’ algebra, so the following is a special
case of 3.4.2.
Proposition 4.1.4
The Banach function algebra W(T) is natural.
Proof Let ϕ ∈W(T), and set ζ = ϕ(Z). Then |ζ| ≤∥ϕ∥∥Z∥= 1. We have
Z = Z−1 and so ζ ̸= 0 and ϕ(Z) = ζ −1. Also |ζ −1| ≤∥ϕ∥∥Z∥= 1. Thus
ζ ∈T.
It follows that, for each trignometric polynomial p of the form n
k=−n ck Zk
(so that p(eiθ) = n
k=−n ckeikθ), we have ϕ(p) = p(ζ). But these polynomials
are dense in W(T), and so ϕ = εζ and W(T) is natural.
□
Corollary 4.1.5 (Wiener)
Let f ∈C(T) have absolutely convergent Fourier
series, and suppose that 1/f ∈C(T). Then 1/f has absolutely convergent
Fourier series.
□
Wiener’s original proof of this was rather long; the Banach algebra proof is
much nicer.
4.2 Analytic functional calculus
The idea of this section is to show how to deﬁne a function f (a) of an element
a of a Banach algebra and a certain analytic function f .
Let A be a unital algebra (not necessarily commutative), and let a ∈A. Then
we can certainly deﬁne p(a) for a polynomial p ∈C[X]: indeed, in the case
where p = n
j=0 α j X j, we set
p(a) =
n

j=0
α ja j
(where a0 = eA). We see that the map
a : p →p(a),
C[X] →A ,
is a unital homomorphism with a(X) = a.

Now suppose that r is a rational function, say r has the form p/q, where both
p, q ∈C[X] and q ̸= 0 (and r is deﬁned on {z ∈C : q(z) ̸= 0}). Provided that
q(a) ∈Inv A, we can sensibly deﬁne
r(a) = p(a)q(a)−1
in A. Check that r(a) is well-deﬁned, and that the map a →r(a) is a homo-
morphism.
The next step requires A to be a unital Banach algebra. Let f be an analytic
function on the disc U = D(0;r), centre 0, radius r > ν(a), say
f (z) =
∞

j=0
α jz j
(|z| < r) .
Then the series ∞
j=0 α ja j converges in A because ∞
j=0 |α j|∥a j∥< ∞– and
we deﬁne f (a) to be its sum. Clearly f (a) is well-deﬁned and the map
a : f →f (a),
H(U) →A ,
is a unital homomorphism with a(Z) = a.
The common generalization of these ideas is the single-variable analytic
functional calculus.
Thus, ﬁx a unital Banach algebra A, an element a ∈A, and an open neigh-
bourhood U of σ(a) in C.
Fact
There is an open set V in C with σ(a) ⊂V ⊂V ⊂U such that V has
only ﬁnitely many components, such that the closures of these components
are pairwise disjoint, and such that ∂V consists of a ﬁnite number of closed,
rectiﬁable curves (V is called a Cauchy domain). Set  = ∂V , the frontier of
V . Then the A-valued integral


f (ζ)(ζeA −a)−1 dζ
exists for each f ∈H(U) and is independent of the choice of V .
Deﬁnition 4.2.1
A functional calculus map for a (on U) is a unital homomor-
phism
θ : H(U) →A
such that θ(Z) = a. The map is continuous if θ( fn) →θ( f ) whenever fn →f
uniformly on compact subsets of U.

The functional calculus can be used to deﬁne many speciﬁc, important ele-
ments in A. For example, we have obvious deﬁnitions of
exp a,
sin a,
cos a
(for each a ∈A). Now suppose that U = C \ R−, and deﬁne log and Z1/2 on U
as analytic functions (with log 1 = 0 and 11/2 = 1). Then we can deﬁne log a
and a1/2 whenever σ(a) ⊂U. The usual rules apply – for example, it follows
immediately that exp(log a) = a and (a1/2)2 = a.
4.3 The idempotent theorem
Let A be an algebra. An idempotent in A is an element p such that p2 = p.
Two idempotents p and q are orthogonal, written p ⊥q, if pq = qp = 0.
The following result follows easily from the functional calculus.
Theorem 4.3.1
Let E be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(E). Suppose that
σ(T ) = σ1 ∪σ2,
where σ1 and σ2 are disjoint, non-empty, closed subsets of σ(T ). Then there
exist idempotents P, Q ∈B(E) with T P = PT and P + Q = IE such that
σ(T | P(E)) = σ1
and
σ(T | Q(E)) = σ2.

4
The functional calculus
35
Proof There exists a function f analytic on a neighbourhood of σ(T ) such that
f | σ1 = 1 and f | σ2 = 0. Deﬁne P = T ( f ) and Q = IE −P. Then P and
Q are idempotents in B(E), T P = PT , and P + Q = IE. Further, P(E) and
Q(E) are closed linear subspaces of E.
For ζ ∈C \ σ1, there exists a function g analytic on a neighbourhood of σ(T )
with (ζ1 −Z)g = f . Set S = T (g). Then
(ζ IE −T )S = S(ζ IE −T ) = P ,
and so ζ /∈σ(T | P(E)). Hence we have σ(T | P(E)) ⊂σ1. Similarly we see
that σ(T | Q(E)) ⊂σ2.
Now take ζ ∈C \ (σ(T | P(E)) ∪σ(T | Q(E))). Then
(ζ IP(E) −T | P(E))−1P + (ζ IQ(E) −T | Q(E))−1Q
is the inverse of ζ IE −T in B(E), and so ζ ∈ρ(T ). Thus we have shown that
σ(T | P(E)) = σ1 and σ(T | Q(E)) = σ2.
□
Let T ∈B(E), and let z be an isolated point of σ(T ). Then the corresponding
idempotent with spectrum {z} is denoted by Pz. The resolvent function RT is
an analytic function near z; if RT has a pole of order k at z, then k is exactly
the index of z – this is the minimum n ∈Z+ such that
ker(zIE −T )n = ker(zIE −T )n+1;
k is also the minimum n ∈Z+ such that (zIE −T )n Pz = 0. The func-
tional calculus in the case where σ(T ) is totally disconnected is called the
Riesz functional calculus. See the discussion of Riesz operators in Part IV,
Chapter 22.
In the case where T ∈K(E), each z ∈σ(T ) \ {0} is a pole of RT (and has
ﬁnite index); the projection Pz has non-zero, ﬁnite-dimensional range, and this
is Pz(E) = ker(zI −T )k, where k is the order of the pole.
There is a very well-developed theory of compact operators on a Hilbert
space. For example, let H be a Hilbert space, and take T ∈K(H) with T = T ∗
(so that T is self-adjoint), say σ(T ) = {zn : n ∈Z+}. Then z0 = 0 and (zn)
is a null sequence in R, and there is an orthonormal basis (en) in H such
that
T x =

4.5 Additional notes
1. We have deﬁned the functional calculus for a ﬁxed open neighbourhood U
of σ(a). In fact, the full theory deals with Oσ(a), the algebra of germs of
analytic functions on σ(a) formed by varying the neighbourhoods U, where
Oσ(a) is given the locally convex inductive-limit topology from the locally
convex spaces H(U), and we ﬁnally obtain a map a : Oσ(a) →A.
2. In the case where A is a unital C∗-algebra and a ∈A is normal, we have
deﬁned (in Exercise 3.6.6) a unital homomorphism
f →f (a),
C(σ(a)) →A .
This homomorphism extends the analytic functional calculus for a, in the
sense that the two deﬁnitions of f (a) agree when f is the restriction to
σ(a) of a function analytic on a neighbourhood of σ(a). For a related func-
tional calculus, with domain H ∞(D), see Part III, Corollary 14.1.14; similar
several-variable versions of this functional calculus are mentioned in Part III,
Chapter 20.

3. Let A be a commutative, unital Banach algebra, and let a = (a1, . . . , an)
belong to A(n), the n-fold Cartesian product of A with itself. Then the joint
spectrum σ(a) of a is
σ(a) = {(ϕ(a1), . . . , ϕ(an)) : ϕ ∈A} .
There is a several-variable analytic functional calculus
a : f →f (a),
Oσ(a) →A ,
a continuous, unital homomorphism with a(Z j) = a j for j = 1, . . . , n.
Again the spectral mapping theorem holds: σ( f (a)) = f (σ(a)) ⊂Cn for
a ∈A(n) and f ∈Oσ(a). This result depends on deep results in the theory of
analytic functions of several complex variables.
For another joint spectrum, see Part III, Chapter 20.
4. Theorem 4.3.1 features in Parts III and IV. The several-variable analytic
functional calculus can be used to prove an extension of Theorem 4.3.1 called
ˇSilov’s idempotent theorem. (It is not known how to prove this without using
the powerful several-variable calculus.) The theorem is as follows.
Theorem
Let A be a commutative Banach algebra, and suppose that K is
a compact and open subset of A. Then there is a unique idempotent p in
A such that p is the characteristic function of K.

5. For polynomial convexity, see Gamelin (1969) and Stout (1971). The func-

ample; the Riesz functional calculus is discussed in Part IV of this book.
There are two different approaches to the several-variable functional cal-
culus for commutative Banach algebras: for these, see Bourbaki (1960),
Gamelin (1969, §III. 4), Stout (1971, Chapter 1, §8), and Palmer (1994,

functional calculus maps, see Part III. More results on joint spectra and the
several-variable functional calculus can be found in Eschmeier and Putinar

Automatic continuity of homomorphisms
There is a deep and surprising connection between the algebraic and topological
properties of a Banach algebra: sometimes the algebraic properties determine
the topological properties. Let A be a unital Banach algebra. Then we have
already seen that a character on A (deﬁned algebraically as an epimorphism
from A ontoC)isautomaticallycontinuous.Infactmanyotherhomomorphisms
between Banach algebras A and B are automatically continuous. We explore
some of these ideas in the present chapter.
5.1 Automatic continuity
The ﬁrst result is a very old theorem of Gelfand.
Proposition 5.1.1
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let B be a commutative,
semisimple Banach algebra. Then each homomorphism θ : A →B is automat-
ically continuous.
Proof Let an →0 in A and θ(an) →b in B. By the closed graph theorem, it
sufﬁces to prove that b = 0.
Take ϕ ∈B. Then ϕ ◦θ ∈A ∪{0}, and so both ϕ and ϕ ◦θ are contin-
uous. We have
(ϕ ◦θ)(an) →(ϕ ◦θ)(0) = 0
and
(ϕ ◦θ)(an) = ϕ(θ(an)) →ϕ(b)
as n →∞, and so ϕ(b) = 0. Thus b ∈{ker ϕ : ϕ ∈B}.
38

5
Automatic continuity of homomorphisms
39
Since B is commutative, {ker ϕ : ϕ ∈B} = rad B (by 3.2.2(v)); since B
is semisimple, rad B = 0. Hence b = 0 and θ is continuous.
□
Deﬁnition 5.1.2
Let (A, ∥· ∥) be a Banach algebra. Then A has a unique
complete norm if each norm with respect to which A is a Banach algebra is
equivalent to the given norm ∥· ∥.
Corollary 5.1.3
Let (A, ∥· ∥) be a commutative, semisimple Banach algebra.
Then A has a unique complete norm.
Proof
Let ||| · ||| be another complete algebra norm on A. Then the identity
map (A, ∥· ∥) →(A, ||| · |||) is continuous by Proposition 5.1.1.
□
Even if we deviate slightly from semisimplicity by considering commutative
Banach algebras with one-dimensional radicals, the above result may fail – see
Exercise 5.3.1.
It was a major open question for many years whether every (perhaps non-
commutative) semisimple Banach algebra has a unique complete norm. This
was eventually proved in 1967 by B. E. Johnson. We shall present a proof due
to B. Aupetit (1982), as simpliﬁed by T. J. Ransford (1989).
One standard tool in automatic continuity theory is the separating space of a
linear map; it measures ‘how far a linear map is from being continuous’.
Deﬁnition 5.1.4
Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let T : E →F be a
linear map. Then the separating space of T is
S(T ) = {y ∈F : there exists xn →0 in E with T xn →y} .
It is easily checked that S(T ) is a closed linear subspace of F, and it
follows from the closed graph theorem that T is continuous if and only if
S(T ) = {0}.
Let A and B be Banach algebras, and let θ : A →B be a homomorphism with
θ(A) = B. Then it is also easy to check that S(θ) is an ideal in B. Proposition
5.1.1 really shows that S(θ) ⊂rad B in the case where B is commutative; we
shall establish this even for non-commutative B.
Lemma 5.1.5
Let (A, ∥· ∥) be a unital Banach algebra, let a ∈A, and let
ε > 0. Then there is a norm ||| · ||| on A such that ||| · ||| is equivalent to ∥· ∥,
|||eA||| = 1, and |||a||| ≤ν(a) + ε.

Proof Set b = a/(ν(a) + ε). Then S = {bn : n ∈Z+} is a bounded semigroup
in (A, ·). For c ∈A, set

|||c||| = sup{p(cd) : d ∈A, p(d) ≤1} .

Let A be an algebra. Then A[X] denotes the algebra of all polynomials with
coefﬁcients in A.

Let A be a Banach algebra, let p ∈A[X], and take R > 1.
Then
(νA(p(1)))2 ≤sup
|z|=R
νA(p(z)) ·
sup
|z|=1/R
νA(p(z)) .
Proof
Let q ∈A[X], and take λ ∈A′ with ∥λ∥= 1 and λ(q(1)) = ∥q(1)∥.
Set F = λ ◦q. By the maximum modulus theorem applied to the function
z →F(z)F(1/z) on the annulus {z ∈C : 1/R ≤|z| ≤R}, we obtain
|F(1)|2 ≤sup
|z|=R
|F(z)| ·
sup
|z|=1/R
|F(z)| .
It follows that
∥q(1)∥2 ≤sup
|z|=R
∥q(z)∥·
sup
|z|=1/R
∥q(z)∥.
(5.1.1)
Apply (5.1.1) with q = p2n, where n ∈N. By the spectral radius formula,
2.1.3 (v), we have
∥p2n(z)∥1/2n →νA(p(z))
as
n →∞
for each z ∈C. The sequence (∥p2n(z)∥1/2n) is monotone decreasing and the
function z →∥p2n(z)∥1/2n is continuous, and so it follows from Dini’s theorem
that, for each r ∈R+, we have
sup
|z|=r
∥p2n(z)∥1/2n →sup
|z|=r
νA(p(z))
as
n →∞.
Thus the result follows from (5.1.1).

(i) Suppose that b ∈S(T ). Then
(νB(Ta))2 ≤νA(a)νB(Ta −b)
(a ∈A) .
(ii) T (A) ∩S(T ) ⊂Q(B).
Proof (Ransford) (i) Choose (an) in A with an →0 and Tan →b as n →∞,
and take a ∈A.
For each ε > 0, we may, by Lemma 5.1.5, choose norms on A and B which
are equivalent to the given norms and which are such that
∥a∥≤νA(a) + ε, ∥Ta −b∥≤νB(Ta −b) + ε
(a ∈A, b ∈B) .
We apply Lemma 5.1.6 in the case where p = (Ta −Tan) + (Tan)X be-
longs to B[X], where n ∈N. We have p(1) = Ta, and so, for each R > 1,
(νB(Ta))2 ≤sup
|z|=R
νB(p(z)) ·
sup
|z|=1/R
νB(p(z)) .
(5.1.2)
Now νB(p(z)) ≤∥Ta −Tan∥+ |z| ∥Tan∥. Also p(z) = T (a −an + zan),
and so, by hypothesis,
νB(p(z)) ≤νA(a −an + zan) ≤∥a −an∥+ |z| ∥an∥.
Thus, from (5.1.2), we have
(νB(Ta))2 ≤(∥a −an∥+ R ∥an∥)(∥Ta −Tan∥+ ∥Tan∥/R) .
This holds for each n ∈N, and so, letting n →∞, we see that
(νB(Ta))2 ≤∥a∥(∥Ta −b∥+ ∥b∥/R) .
But this holds for each R > 1, and so, letting R →∞, we obtain
(νB(Ta))2 ≤∥a∥∥Ta −b∥≤(νA(a) + ε)(νB(Ta −b) + ε) .
Finally this holds for each ε > 0, and so the result follows.
(ii) This is immediate from (i).

Theorem 5.1.8 (Johnson)

Proof It is easy to see that Theorem 5.1.7 applies with θ for T . Since θ(A) = B,
Theorem 5.1.7(ii) shows that S(θ) ⊂Q(B). Since S(θ) is an ideal in B, it
follows from Proposition 2.2.3(ii) that S(θ) ⊂rad B.

□
The sharp-eyed will notice that we have not quite generalized Proposition
5.1.1tothecasewhere B isnotnecessarilycommutative.Toobtainananalogous
result, we certainly need to suppose that θ(A) = B, but we actually assumed
that θ(A) = B. Thus we have the following question, which has been open for
at least 30 years.
Question 5.1.10
Let A and B be Banach algebras, and suppose that B is
semisimple. Let θ : A →B be a homomorphism with θ(A) = B. Is θ automat-
ically continuous?
If you can solve this, please let me know quickly.
5.2 Homomorphisms from Banach algebras
Let θ : A →B be a homomorphism between Banach algebras. We have given
some conditions on the range B that ensure that θ is automatically continuous.
What about conditions on the domain algebra A? The key tool in this case is
the continuity ideal I(θ) of the homomorphism θ.
Deﬁnition 5.2.1
Let θ : A →B be a homomorphism. Then
I(θ) = {a ∈a : θ(a)b = bθ(a) = 0
(b ∈S(θ))} .
Thus I(θ) is the (two-sided) annihilator of the separating space S(θ).
It is an easy exercise to check that I(θ) is an ideal in A. (However, there is
no reason for I(θ) to be closed in A unless θ really is continuous – which is
what we are trying to show.) It is also easy to check that I(θ) is just the set of
elements a ∈A such that both of the maps x →θ(ax) and x →θ(xa) from
A into B are continuous. In the case where A is unital our aim is to show that
eA ∈I(θ), for then I(θ) = A and θ is continuous on the whole of A.
The following main boundedness theorem (MBT) is due to Bade and Curtis
(1960).
Theorem 5.2.2
Let A and B be Banach algebras, and let θ : A →B be
a homomorphism. Suppose that (an) and (bn) are sequences in A such that

(5.2.1)
Proof We may suppose that ∥an∥= ∥bn∥= 1 (n ∈N).
Assume towards a contradiction that there is no C such that (5.2.1) holds.
Then there is an injective map (i, j) →n(i, j), N × N →N, such that

∥θ(avi)∥≤∥θ(a)∥∥θ(vi)∥≤2 j(i) ∥θ(a)∥.
We conclude that ∥θ(a)∥≥2i for each i ∈N, clearly a contradiction.

Deﬁnition 5.2.3
Let A be a unital algebra. A continued bisection of the iden-

p1 + q1 and such that, for each n ∈N, we have pn ⊥qn, pn = pn+1 + qn+1,
and Apn A = Aqn A.
It is easy to check in this case that qm ⊥qn
(m ̸= n).
Theorem 5.2.4
Let A be a unital Banach algebra with a continued bisection

automatically continuous.

Let θ : A →B be a homomorphism into a Banach algebra B. Assume to-
wards a contradiction that qn /∈I(θ) for inﬁnitely many n ∈N. Then we may
suppose that the map
x →θ(qnx),
A →B ,
is discontinuous for inﬁnitely many n ∈N, and so there exists (xn) ⊂A such
that ∥xn∥= 1 and ∥θ(qnxn)∥≥n ∥qn∥2 for inﬁnitely many n ∈N. Apply the
MBT with an = qn and bn = qnxn (so that ambn = 0 when m ̸= n): there exists
C > 0 such that
∥θ(qnxn)∥≤C ∥qn∥2
(n ∈N) .
Thus C ≥n for inﬁnitely many n ∈N, a contradiction.
We have shown that there exists k ∈N with qk ∈I(θ). But now, successively,
we see that pk, pk−1, qk−1, . . . , p1, q1, eA belong to I(θ), and so I(θ) = A and
θ is continuous.

Corollary 5.2.5
Let E be a Banach space such that E ∼= E ⊕E. Then all
homomorphisms from B(E) into a Banach algebra are continuous.
Proof We have
E ≃E ⊕E ≃(E ⊕E) ⊕E ≃· · · ;
at the nth stage, E is linearly homeomorphic to the direct sum of n copies of
itself. Let Pn and Qn be the projections of E onto the ﬁrst and second of these
n components, respectively. Clearly IE = P1 + Q1 and,
Pn ⊥Qn,
Pn = Pn+1 + Qn+1
(n ∈N) .
Let Un be the operator on E which exchanges the ﬁrst two of the n components
at the nth stage of the decomposition. Then Pn = Un QnUn and Qn = Un PnUn
for each n ∈N. Thus {(Pn), (Qn)} is a continued bisection of the identity.

Eidelheit (1940) shows an even stronger result. Write out the details of the
following theorem.
Let E be a (non-zero) Banach space, and let A = B(E), a Banach algebra
for the operator norm, ∥· ∥. Let ||| · ||| be any algebra norm on A. Then there
is a constant C such that ∥T ∥≤C |||T ||| (T ∈A).
To obtain a contradiction, assume that there is no such C. Take a sequence
(Sn) in A such that |||Sn||| = 1 (n ∈N) and such that ∥Sn∥→∞. Then
there exists x0 ∈F with the sequence (∥Snx0∥) unbounded, and then there
exists λ ∈E′ such that the sequence (|λ(Snx0)|) is unbounded. Now deﬁne
zn = λ(Snx0) (n ∈N).
Deﬁne T x = λ(x)x0 (x ∈E), so that T ∈B(E). Check that we have
T SnT = znT (n ∈N), and obtain a contradiction.
3. Let 
 be a compact space, and let ∥· ∥be an algebra norm on C(
). Show
that | f |
 ≤∥f ∥( f ∈C(
)).
4. Let E and F be Banach spaces, let T : E →F be a linear map, and then let
Q : F →F/S(T ) be the quotient map. Show that QT is continuous.
Suppose that G is another Banach space, and that S ∈B(F, G). Show that
SS(T ) = S(ST ) ,
so that ST is continuous if and only if SS(T ) = {0}.
5. Show that to resolve Question 5.1.10 is equivalent to solving the following
question.
Let A and B be Banach algebras, let θ : A →B be a homomorphism,
and let b ∈S(θ). Is it necessarily true that σ(b) = {0}?

(It can be shown quite easily that σ(b) is always a connected set containing
0, but nothing further seems to be known.)
5.4 Additional notes
1. Let A be a commutative Banach algebra. We know that, in the case where
A is semisimple, A has a unique complete norm. However, this does not
characterizesemisimpleBanachalgebras.Forexample,automaticcontinuity
theory shows that the Banach algebras ℓ1(ω) all have a unique complete
norm, but they are not necessarily semisimple. Many other examples are
given in Dales (2000).
2. Despite an immense amount of work on the ‘uniqueness-of-norm’ problem,
basic questions remain open.
For example, let (A, ∥· ∥) be a commutative Banach algebra which is an
integral domain. Does A necessarily have a unique complete norm?
A Banach algebra A is topologically simple if the only closed ideals in
A are the trivial ones {0} and A. It is not known whether or not there is a
commutative, topologically simple Banach algebra other than C (this could
be the hardest question in Banach algebra theory). It was shown by Cusack
(1977) that, if there is a commutative Banach algebra which is an integral
domain and which does not have a unique complete norm, then there is a
commutative, topologically simple, radical Banach algebra.
3. Let H be a Hilbert space. We have shown that all homomorphisms from
B(H) are continuous. What about other C∗-algebras?
First note that it is a standard triviality that all ∗-homomorphisms between
C∗-algebras are automatically continuous, (see Dales (2000, 3.2.4) and all
books on C∗-algebras). But we are interested in homomorphisms which are
not ∗-homomorphisms.
The following result is proved in Sinclair (1976, 12.4) by a different
argument from the one we used in Theorem 5.2.4. Let A be a unital C∗-
algebra such that A has no proper closed ideals of ﬁnite codimension. Then
every homomorphism from A into a Banach algebra is continuous.
4. The above result does not cover the commutative C∗-algebras of the form
C(
) for a compact, inﬁnite space 
. It was a question of Kaplansky (1949)
whether or not every homomorphism from C(
) is automatically contin-
uous; this is equivalent to the question whether every algebra norm ∥· ∥
on C(
) is equivalent to the uniform norm | · |
. (Kaplansky proved that
necessarily | f |
 ≤∥f ∥( f ∈C(
)); see Exercise 5.3.3.)
A major advance was due to Bade and Curtis (1960). Let θ : C(
) →B
be a discontinuous homomorphism into a Banach algebra B. Then there

5
Automatic continuity of homomorphisms
47
is a ﬁnite subset F = {x1, . . . , xn} of 
 (the singularity set) such that the
restriction of θ to the ideal J(F) is continuous. Thus θ is continuous on a
‘big subalgebra’ of C(
). Further developments, due to Esterle (1978a) and
Sinclair (1975) showed that there is a maximal ideal M of C(
), a prime
ideal P ⊆
/ M, and an embedding of the algebra M/P into a radical Banach
algebra. However it was left open whether or not such embeddings exist.
Finally it was shown independently by Dales (1979) and Esterle (1978b)
that such embeddings do exist – at least if the continuum hypothesis (CH)
be assumed – for every inﬁnite compact space 
. It is a striking fact that this
result cannot be proved in the theory ZFC – see Dales and Woodin (1987)
for an exposition, and Dales and Woodin (1996) for further developments.
5. There is a non-commutative analogue of the Bade–Curtis theorem: see
Sinclair (1974). It is a conjecture of Albrecht and Dales (1983) that the
following are equivalent for a C∗-algebra A: (a) there is a discontinuous
homomorphism from A; (b) there exists k ∈N and inﬁnitely many maximal
ideals Mn in A such that A/Mn ∼= Mk.
For a short proof that (b) implies (a) (with CH), see Dales and Runde
(1997). For proofs that (a) implies (b) for various classes of C∗-algebras see
Albrecht and Dales (1983) and Ermert (1996).
6. Is every epimorphism from a C∗-algebra onto a Banach algebra automat-
ically continuous? There is an elegant proof of this for commutative C∗-
algebras in Esterle (1980) (see also Dales 2000, 5.4.27), but the general case
is open.
7. Let A be a Banach algebra with ﬁnite-dimensional radical. We would like to
know necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for A to have a unique complete
norm. For an attack on this and a plausible conjecture, see Dales and Loy
(1997).
8. Johnson’s original proof of the uniqueness-of-norm theorem is in Johnson
(1967). There are several proofs in Dales (2000) – uniqueness-of-norm the-
orems and counter–examples are in §5.1.
All the results which are mentioned in the Additional notes are discussed
in detail in Dales (2000, Chapter 5). In particular, the structure of all
(discontinuous) homomorphisms from C(
) is given in full detail.

Modules and derivations
After homomorphisms between algebras, the next most elementary maps from
an algebra A are derivations into an A-bimodule E. We discuss the algebraic
theory, and then the Banach version.
6.1 Modules
We ﬁrst recall the elementary theory of modules over an algebra.
Deﬁnition 6.1.1
Let A be an algebra. A left A-module is a linear space E
over C and a map (a, x) →a · x, A × E →E, such that:
(i) a · (αx + βy) = αa · x + βa · y (α, β ∈C, a ∈A, x, y ∈E);
(ii) (αa + βb) · x = αa · x + βb · x (α, β ∈C, a, b ∈A, x ∈E);
(iii) a · (b · x) = ab · x (a, b ∈A, x ∈E).
A right A-module is a linear space E over C and a map (a, x) →x · a,
A × E →E, such that:
(i) (αx + βy) · a = αx · a + βy · a (α, β ∈C, a ∈A, x, y ∈E);
(ii) x · (αa + βb) = αx · a + βx · b (α, β ∈C, a, b ∈A, x ∈E);
(iii) (x · a) · b = x · ab (a, b ∈A, x ∈E) .
An A-bimodule is a space E which is a left A-module and a right A-module
and which is such that
a · (x · b) = (a · x) · b
(a, b ∈A, x ∈E) .
Suppose that A is commutative and that E is an A-bimodule such that
a · x = x · a
(a ∈A, x ∈E) .
Then E is an A-module.

Modules and derivatives

Forexample,let I bealeftidealin A.Then I and A/I areleft A-modules;they
are A-bimodules in the case where I is an ideal. Again, let A be commutative,
and let ϕ ∈A. Then the linear space C is an A-module for the map
(a, z) →ϕ(a)z,
A × C →C ;
it is denoted by Cϕ. Finally, let A be a Banach function algebra on 
. Then
C(
) is a Banach A-module (for the module product equal to the pointwise
product).
Let E be a left A-module. Then the map ρ : A →L(E) deﬁned by
ρ(a)(x) = a · x
(a ∈A, x ∈E)
is a homomorphism, and every such homomorphism deﬁnes a left A-module.
The map ρ is called a representation of the algebra A on the linear space E.
Throughout, one could replace the language of modules by that of representa-
tions. This is the approach taken in Palmer (1994, 2001).
Suppose that A is unital. Then a left A-module E is unital if
eA · x = x (x ∈E) .
Let E be a left A-module. Then we write
A · E = {a · x : a ∈E, x ∈E},
AE = lin A · E .
We write aE for {a}E, etc. The module E is simple if A · E ̸= {0} and if {0}
and E are the only submodules of E. It is easy to check that, for a simple module
E, we have A · x = E for each x ∈E \ {0}.
Proposition 6.1.2
Let A be a unital algebra. An ideal I in A is primitive if
I = {a ∈A : aE = {0}}
for some simple left A-module E.
It is easy to check that I is a primitive if and only if
I = {a ∈A : aA ⊂M}
for some maximal left ideal M of A, and in this case the simple module E that
arises in the deﬁnition is isomorphic to A/M as a left A-module. Further, each
primitive ideal is the intersection of the maximal left ideals which contain it.
In some ways, primitive ideals play the same role for general algebras that the
kernels of characters play for commutative algebras.

50
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Let E and F be left A-modules. A left A-module homomorphism is a linear
map T : E →F such that
T (a · x) = a · T x
(a ∈A, x ∈E) .
Similarly we deﬁne A-bimodule homomorphisms.
Deﬁnition 6.1.3
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let E be a Banach space
which is a left A-module. Then E is a weak Banach left A-module if the map
ρ(a) : x →a · x,
E →E ,
is continuous for each a ∈A, and E is a Banach left A-module if the map
(a, x) →a · x,
A × E →E ,
is continuous. Similarly, for right A-modules and A-bimodules.
Thus E is weak Banach if, for each a ∈A, there exists a constant Ca > 0
such that
∥a · x∥≤Ca ∥x∥
(x ∈E) ,
and E is Banach if there exists a constant C > 0 such that
∥a · x∥≤C ∥a∥∥x∥
(a ∈A, x ∈E) ;
in this latter case we may suppose that C = 1 by moving to an equivalent norm
on E.
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let I be a closed left ideal in A. Then I and
A/I are Banach left A-modules. Let A be commutative, and take ϕ ∈A. Then
Cϕ is a Banach A-module. Let A and B be Banach algebras, and let θ : A →B
be a homomorphism. Then B is a weak Banach A-bimodule for the maps
a · b = θ(a)b,
b · a = bθ(a)
(a ∈A, b ∈B) ,
but we only know that B is a Banach A-bimodule in the case where θ is
continuous.
Proposition 6.1.4
Let A be a unital Banach algebra.
(i) Each primitive ideal in A is closed.

6
Modules and derivatives
51
(ii) Let E be a simple left A-module. Then there is a norm ∥· ∥on E such that
(E, ∥· ∥) is a Banach left A-module.
Proof (i) By Proposition 2.2.1(ii), each maximal left ideal is closed, and we
know that a primitive ideal is an intersection of maximal left ideals.
(ii) We may suppose that E = A/M as a left A-module for a maximal
left ideal M, and then E is a Banach left A-module for the quotient
norm ∥· ∥.
□
We now come to the important concept of a dual module.
Let E be a Banach space. Then the action of λ ∈E′ on x ∈E is denoted by
⟨x, λ⟩.
Deﬁnition 6.1.5
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let E be a Banach A-
bimodule. For a ∈A and λ ∈E′, deﬁne a · λ and λ · a by
⟨x, a · λ⟩= ⟨x · a, λ⟩, ⟨x, λ · a⟩= ⟨a · x, λ⟩
(x ∈E) .
Then a · λ, λ · a ∈E′, and E′ is a Banach A-bimodule, called the dual module
to E.
Check that E′ has the stated properties.
For example, take E = A. Then A′ is a Banach A-bimodule for the operations
⟨b, a · λ⟩= ⟨ba, λ⟩, ⟨b, λ · a⟩= ⟨ab, λ⟩
(a, b ∈A, λ ∈A′) .
This module is called the dual module of A.
6.2 Derivations
Deﬁnition 6.2.1
Let A be an algebra, and let E be an A-bimodule. A linear
map D : A →E is a derivation if
D(ab) = a · Db + Da · b
(a, b ∈A) .
(6.2.1)
Here is an obvious example: let A = C(1)(I), E = C(I), and D : f →f ′,
A →E. Then E is a Banach A-module for the pointwise product, and D is a
continuous derivation.
Equation (6.2.1) is the derivation identity. The set of derivations from A into
E is denoted by Z1(A, E); it is a linear subspace of L(A, E). For example, take
x ∈E, and set
δx(a) = a · x −x · a
(a ∈A) .

52
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Then, for a, b ∈A, we have
δx(ab) = a · (b · x −x · b) + (a · x −x · a) · b = δx(a) · b + a · δx(b) ,
and so δx is a derivation. Derivations of this form are termed inner derivations,
and an inner derivation δx is implemented by x; derivations which are not inner
derivations are called outer derivations. In particular, the map
δb : a →ab −ba,
A →A ,
is an inner derivation on the algebra A. The set of inner derivations from A to
E is a linear subspace N 1(A, E) of Z1(A, E).
Note that Z1(A, Cϕ) consists of linear functionals d : A →C such that
d(ab) = ϕ(a)d(b) + d(a)ϕ(b)
(a, b ∈A) .
These maps are point derivations at ϕ.
For example, let A = A(D), the disc algebra. Then the map f →f ′(0) is a
continuous point derivation at the character ε0 on A.
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let E be a Banach A-bimodule. The space
of continuous derivations from A to E is denoted by
Z1(A, E) ,
and the space of (necessarily continuous) inner derivations is now N 1(A, E).
A particular case to consider is that of derivations D : A →A for a Banach
algebra A; in this case, we can also deﬁne the maps Dn : A →A for each
n ∈N. It seems that the range of such a derivation must be ‘small’ in some
sense.
Theorem6.2.2 (SingerandWermer)
Let A beacommutativeBanachalgebra,
and let D : A →A be a continuous derivation. Then D(A) ⊂radA.
Proof Let z ∈C. Then zD ∈Z1(A, A).
It is easy to check (using Leibniz’s identity, Exercise 6.3.4 (iii)) that exp(zD)
is an automorphism in B(A). For ϕ ∈A and a ∈A, deﬁne
ϕz(a) = ϕ((exp(zD))(a)) = ϕ(a) +

Then the map
F : z →ϕz(a),
C →C ,
is an entire function. Also, for each z ∈C, we have ϕz ∈A, and so it follows
that |ϕz(a)| ≤∥a∥. Thus F is bounded. By Liouville’s theorem, F is constant.
In particular, ϕ(Da) = 0.
This is true for each ϕ ∈A, and so Da ∈rad A.
□
The following result is the non-commutative generalization of the Singer–
Wermer theorem.
Theorem 6.2.3 (Sinclair)
Let A be a Banach algebra, and let D : A →A be
a continuous derivation. Then D(P) ⊂P for each primitive ideal P of A.
Proof Let P be a primitive ideal, say P = {a ∈A : aE = {0}} for a simple
left A-module E. Then E is a Banach left A-module.
Assume towards a contradiction that D(P) ̸⊂P. Then there exists an
element a0 ∈P with Da0 · x ̸= 0 for some x ∈E. There exists b ∈A with
b · Da0 · x = x. But now D(ba0) · x = x because a0 · x = 0. It follows that
(D(ba0))n · x = x (n ∈N).
By a result in the additional notes, below, we have
Dn((ba0)n) −n!(D(ba0))n ∈P
(n ∈N) .
Hence n!x = Dn((ba0)n) · x, and so
∥x∥1/n ≤
	 1
n!

1/n
∥D∥∥ba0∥∥x∥1/n →0
as n →∞.
Thus x = 0, a contradiction. The result follows.

The completion of (E ⊗F, ∥· ∥π) is the projective tensor product of E

(x ∈E, y ∈F) .
Suppose that E and F are Banach left and right A-modules, respectively.
Show that E⊗F is a Banach A-bimodule for maps satisfying (6.2.2).
In particular, we have the following important example that will return

56
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Many attractive results are known about these questions, but there re-
main many challenging open questions. Perhaps the most important is
Problem 9.1.13 of Part II; in the notation of Chapter 7, this asks if
H1(L 1(G), M(G)) = {0} for every locally compact group G.
2. Theorem 6.2.2 was proved in Singer and Wermer (1955); the authors conjec-
tured that the result should hold without the assumption that the derivation
D be continuous. This was ﬁnally proved in the powerful paper (1988) of
Thomas, building on an earlier result of Johnson (1969).
3. We used the following algebraic calculation in Theorem 6.2.3.
Let D be a derivation on an algebra A, and let I be an ideal in A. Then,
for each a1, . . . , an ∈I, we have
Dn(a1 · · · an) −n!(Da1) · · · (Dan) ∈I .
The proof is as follows.
We ﬁrst make the claim that, for each k ≥2, we have D j(b1 · · · bk) ∈I
whenever j ∈{0, . . . , k −1}andb1, . . . , bk ∈I.Theclaimistruefork = 2,
for certainly
D(b1b2) = b1 · Db2 + Db1 · b2 ∈I
whenever b1, b2 ∈I. Assume that the above claim holds for k, and now take
elements b1, . . . , bk+1 ∈I. Then, by Leibniz’s identity,
D j(b1, . . . , bk+1) =

Di(b1 · · · bk) · D j−1(bk+1)
( j ∈N) ,
and so D j(b1 · · · bk+1) ∈I ( j = 0, . . . , k). By induction on k, the claim
holds.
We now prove the main result by induction on n. The result is certainly
true if n = 1. Assume that the result is true for n, and take a1, . . . , an+1 ∈I.
By Leibniz’s identity,
Dn+1(a1 · · · an+1) =

Each term on the right-hand side of this equality belongs to I, save perhaps
for the term (n + 1)Dn(a1 · · · an)D(an+1). By the inductive hypothesis, we
have
Dn(a1 · · · an) −n!(Da1) · · · (Dan) ∈I ,

57
and so
Dn+1(a1 · · · an+1) −(n + 1)!(Da1) · · · (Dan+1)
= Dn+1(a1 · · · an+1) −(n + 1)Dn(a1 · · · an)(Dan+1)
+ (n + 1)(Dn(a1 · · · an) −n!(Da1) · · · (Dan))(Dan+1)
belongs to I. The induction continues.
4. The natural non-commutative analogue of Thomas’s general version of the
Singer–Wermer theorem would be the following statement.
Let D be a derivation on a Banach algebra A. Then D(P) ⊂P for each
primitive ideal P of A.
This result has not been proved so far. However Thomas (1993) has proved
that D(P) ⊂P for all but ﬁnitely many primitive ideals P, and that each of
these exceptional primitive ideals has ﬁnite codimension in A.
A closely related open question is the following. Let D be a derivation on
a Banach algebra A. Suppose that a ∈A and that a · Da = Da · a. Does
it follow that Da is a quasi-nilpotent element? The Kleinecke–Shirokov
theorem states that this is true in the case where D is continuous. An attractive
survey of these questions is given in Mathieu (1994).
5. For many Banach algebras A, all derivations from A into an arbitrary Banach
A-bimodule E are continuous. For example, this is true for all C⋆-algebras
A. However there are discontinuous derivations from the disc algebra A(D)
into certain Banach A(D)-modules (despite the fact that all point derivations
on A(D) are automatically continuous).
6. The algebraic theory of modules and primitive ideals is contained in Dales
(2000, §1.4) and Palmer (1994). For Banach modules, see Dales (2000,
§2.6). The ‘attractive results’ about derivations that I know are all contained
in Dales (2000, §5.6). Theorem 6.2.3 is from Sinclair (1969).

Cohomology
There is a substantial interest nowadays in the cohomology of Banach algebras;
it is a development of an earlier, purely algebraic theory. This algebraic theory is
now usually presented in the language of homological algebra (exact sequences,
functors, Ext, Tor, injective and projective resolutions, . . . ), and this approach
has been adopted by Banach algebraists – see Helemskii (1989). We shall avoid
this terminology here, and give an approach that originates with Hochschild.
7.1 Hochschild cohomology
Notation: let A be an algebra, and let E be an A-bimodule. We write Ln(A, E)
for the linear space of all n-linear maps from A × · · · × A (n copies) into E. (Set
L0(A, E) = E.) The formal deﬁnition of the Hochschild cohomology groups
H n(A, E) is the following.
Deﬁnition 7.1.1
Let A be an algebra, and let E be an A-bimodule. For each
x ∈E, deﬁne
δ0(x) : a →a · x −x · a,
A →E ,
and, for n ∈N and T ∈Ln(A, E), deﬁne δnT ∈Ln+1(A, E) by
δnT (a1, . . . , an+1) = a1 · T (a2, . . . , an+1) + (−1)n+1T (a1, . . . , an) · an+1
+
n

j=1
(−1) jT (a1, . . . , a j−1, a ja j+1, a j+2, . . . , an+1) .
Let n ∈Z+. It is clear that δn is a linear map from Ln(A, E) into Ln+1(A, E);
these maps are the connecting maps. A direct but tedious calculation shows that

δn+1 ◦δn = 0, and so im δn ⊂ker δn+1. Indeed we have a complex:
L•(A, E) : 0 −→E
δ0
−→L(A, E)
δ1
−→L2(A, E) −→· · · −→
Ln(A, E)
δn
−→Ln+1(A, E)
δn+1
−→Ln+2(A, E) −→· · ·
(7.1.1)
of linear spaces and linear maps. For n ∈N, the elements of ker δn and im δn−1
are the n-cocyles and the n-coboundaries, respectively; we set
Zn(A, E) = ker δn
and
N n(A, E) = im δn−1 .
Deﬁnition 7.1.2
Let A be an algebra, and let E be an A-bimodule. For n ∈N,
the nth cohomology group of A with coefﬁcients in E is
H n(A, E) = Zn(A, E)/N n(A, E) ;
also, H 0(A, E) = ker δ0 = {x ∈E : a · x = x · a (a ∈A)} .
In fact, the cohomology groups H n(A, E) are linear spaces. Despite the
impressive generality of our deﬁnition of H n(A, E) for each n ∈N, we shall
really only consider H 1(A, E) in this chapter (but see the notes); let us see what
H 1(A, E) measures.
For T ∈L(A, E), we have T ∈im δ0 if and only if there exists x ∈E with
T (a) = a · x −x · a
(a, b ∈A) .
Also
(δ1T )(a, b) = a · T b −T (ab) + Ta · b
(a, b ∈A) .
(7.1.2)
Thus N 1(A, E) and Z1(A, E) coincide with our previous deﬁnitions of this
notation in §6.2, and H 1(A, E) is the quotient of the space of all derivations
by the space of inner derivations; clearly, H 1(A, E) = {0} if and only if every
derivation from A into E is inner.
Now let A be a Banach algebra, and let E be a Banach A-bimodule. Then
we write Bn(A, E) for the Banach space of bounded maps in Ln(A, E), and
then deﬁne the complex B•(A, E) as in (7.1.1), above, with B replacing L. The
elements of ker δn and im δn−1 are now the continuous n-cocyles and continuous
n-coboundaries, respectively, and the spaces thereof are
Zn(A, E)
and
N n(A, E) .

60
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
We then deﬁne the nth continuous cohomology group of A with coefﬁcients in
E as
Hn(A, E) = Zn(A, E)/N n(A, E) .
This is a seminormed space. (In general, N n(A, E) is not closed in Zn(A, E).)
Thus H1(A, E) is the quotient of the space of continuous derivations from A
to E by the space of inner derivations.
Although we shall not discuss H 2(A, E) in these lectures, we do note that,
for each T ∈Z2(A, E), we have the 2-cocycle identity
a · T (b, c) −T (ab, c) + T (a, bc) −T (a, b) · c = 0
(a, b, c ∈A) ,
and thus H 2(A, E) = {0} if and only if each such T has the form δ1S for some
element S ∈L(A, E). Even at the level of n = 2, direct calculations are not so
easy.
7.2 Amenable Banach algebras
Algebraists were interested in characterizing those algebras A such that
H 1(A, E) = {0} for each A-bimodule E.
Let A be a unital algebra, and let π : A ⊗A →A be the linear map such
that π(a ⊗b) = ab (a, b ∈A). A diagonal for A is an element u ∈A ⊗A
such that π(u) = eA and a · u = u · a (a ∈A).
Theorem 7.2.1
Let A be an algebra. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) H 1(A, E) = {0} for every A-bimodule E;
(b) A is unital and has a diagonal in A ⊗A;
(c) A is semisimple and ﬁnite-dimensional.
□
The analogue for Banach algebras is given in the notes.
However, the class of Banach algebras that has proved to be important is that
of amenable algebras.
Deﬁnition 7.2.2
(Johnson) Let A be a Banach algebra. Then A is amenable if
H1(A, E′) = {0} for every Banach A-bimodule E.
Thus A is amenable if every continuous derivation into a dual module is
inner. We shall explore this notion a little. Throughout A is a unital Banach

algebra. It can be checked that, to show A is amenable, it is sufﬁcient to show
that H1(A, E′) = {0} for each unital Banach A-bimodule E.
Let E and F be Banach spaces, and let T ∈B(E, F). The dual of T is the
element T ′ ∈B(F′, E′) speciﬁed by
⟨x, T ′λ⟩= ⟨T x, λ⟩
(x ∈F, λ ∈F′) ;
this map is continuous when E′ and F′ have their weak-∗topologies. The
second dual of T is T ′′ = (T ′)′ in B(E′′, F′′).
The following generalization of the notion of a diagonal was introduced in
Johnson (1972b).
Deﬁnition 7.2.3
Let A be a unital Banach algebra. A virtual diagonal for A is
an element M in (A⊗A)′′ such that π′′(M) = eA and a · M = M · a (a ∈A).
Theorem 7.2.4
Let A be a unital Banach algebra. Then A is amenable if and
only if A has a virtual diagonal.
Proof Let A have a virtual diagonal M, let E be a unital Banach A-bimodule,
and let D ∈Z 1(A, E′).
For each x ∈E, deﬁne x ∈(A⊗A)′ by
⟨a ⊗b, x⟩= ⟨x, a · Db⟩= ⟨x · a, Db⟩
(a, b ∈A) ,
and then deﬁne λ ∈E′ by
⟨x, λ⟩= ⟨M, x⟩
(x ∈E) .
For a, b, c ∈A and x ∈E, we have
⟨b ⊗c, a · x−x · a⟩= ⟨a · x −x · a, b · Dc⟩= ⟨x, b · Dc · a −ab · Dc⟩
and
⟨b ⊗c, a · x −x · a⟩= ⟨b ⊗ca −ab ⊗c, x⟩
= ⟨x, bc · Da + b · Dc · a −ab · Dc⟩,
and so
⟨b ⊗c, a · x−x · a⟩= ⟨b ⊗c, a · x −x · a⟩−⟨x, bc · Da⟩.

62
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Hence, for each v ∈A⊗A, it follows that
⟨v, a · x−x · a⟩= ⟨v, a · x −x · a⟩−⟨x · π(v), Da⟩
(a ∈A, x ∈E) .
(7.2.1)
Let v run through a bounded net (va) ⊂A⊗A that converges in the weak-∗
topology to M. Then π(va) →eA in the weak topology on A; a standard
averaging procedure (Mazur’s theorem) allows us to suppose that π(va) →eA
in the norm-topology of A, and then x · π(va) →x in E. Thus, from (7.2.1),
we have
⟨a · x −x · a, λ⟩= ⟨a · M −M · a, x⟩−⟨x, Da⟩
= −⟨x, Da⟩
(a ∈A, x ∈E) .
Hence Da = a · λ −λ · a (a ∈A) in E′, and D is inner. This shows that A
is amenable.
Now suppose that A is amenable. Deﬁne v = eA ⊗eA in A⊗A. Then
π′′(a · v −v · a) = π(a ⊗eA −eA ⊗a) = 0 ,
and so δv ∈Z1(A, ker π′′). Set
X = (A⊗A)′
π′(A′) .
Then X′ is identiﬁed with ker π′′ as a Banach A-bimodule. Since A is amenable,
there exists w ∈ker π′′ with δw = δv. Deﬁne u = v −w. Then, for each a ∈A,
we have
a · u −u · a = (δu −δw)(a) = 0
and
π′′(u) = π′′(v) = eA ,
and so u is a virtual diagonal.
□
Let G be a group, and let A = ℓ1(G). Given f, g ∈A, we deﬁne f ⊗g on
G ⊗G by
( f ⊗g)(s, t) = f (s)g(t)
(s, t ∈G) .
By an earlier remark, there is an isometric isomorphism A⊗A →ℓ1(G × G)
that identiﬁes f ⊗g in A ⊗A with f ⊗g as deﬁned above; we thus identify
A⊗A as ℓ1(G × G).

7
Cohomology
63
The dual space of ℓ1(G) is ℓ∞(G), and the actions of δs ∈ℓ1(G) on f ∈ℓ∞(G)
are given by
(δs · f )(t) = f (ts),
( f · δs)(t) = f (st)
(t ∈G) .
The dual of ℓ1(G × G) is (A⊗A)′ = ℓ∞(G × G), and this is a Banach A-
bimodule: the module operations · satisfy the equations
(δs · F)(u, v) = F(u, vs),
(F · δs)(u, v) = F(su, v)
(u, v ∈G) ,
where s ∈G and F ∈ℓ∞(G × G). Next we see that the dual of the induced
product map π : A⊗A →A is π′ : ℓ∞(G) →ℓ∞(G × G), where
π′( f )(u, v) = f (uv)
(u, v ∈G, f ∈ℓ∞(G)) .
Thus a virtual diagonal is a continuous linear functional M on ℓ∞(G × G) such
that
⟨F · δs, M⟩= ⟨δs · F, M⟩
(s ∈G, F ∈ℓ∞(G × G))
(7.2.2)
and
⟨π′( f ), M⟩= f (eG)
( f ∈ℓ∞(G)) .
(7.2.3)
Deﬁnition 7.2.5
Let G be a group. A mean on ℓ∞(G) is a continuous linear
functional  on (ℓ∞(G), | · |G) such that (1) = ∥∥= 1. The mean  is
left-invariant if
⟨f, ⟩= ⟨f · δx, ⟩
(s ∈G, f ∈ℓ∞(G)) .
The group G is amenable if there is a left-invariant mean on G.
Thus a mean on G is an element of the state space of the C∗-algebra ℓ∞(G).
It is easy to see that every abelian group and every compact group is amenable,
but the free group on two generators F2 is not amenable.
Here is the theorem that suggested the name ‘amenable’ for the class of
Banach algebras that we are considering.
Theorem 7.2.6
(Johnson) Let G be a group. Then the Banach algebra ℓ1(G)
is amenable if and only if the group G is amenable.

64
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
Proof
Suppose that G is amenable, and let  be a left-invariant mean on
ℓ∞(G). For F ∈ℓ∞(G × G), set

F(t) = F(t, t−1)
(t ∈G) ,
so that 
F ∈ℓ∞(G) with | 
F|G ≤|F|G×G, and then deﬁne
⟨F, M⟩= ⟨
F, ⟩.
(7.2.4)
Then M ∈ℓ∞(G × G)′ with ∥M∥= 1.
We claim that M is a virtual diagonal for ℓ∞(G). For F ∈ℓ∞(G × G) and
s, t ∈G, we have

F · δs(t) = (F · δs)(t, t−1) = F(st, t−1)
and

δs · F(t) = (δs · F)(t, t−1) = F(t, t−1s) ,
and so
δs · F(st) =
F · δs(t). Since  is left-invariant, (7.2.2) follows from
(7.2.4). Now take f ∈ℓ∞(G), and set F = π′( f ) ∈ℓ∞(G × G). Then

F(t) = f (tt−1) = f (eG)
(t ∈G) ,
and so ⟨π′( f ), M⟩= f (eG), giving (7.2.3).
Thus M is a virtual diagonal, as claimed, and so ℓ∞(G) is amenable by
Theorem 7.2.4.
For the converse, let M be a virtual diagonal for ℓ∞(G). For f ∈ℓ∞(G), set
f (u, v) = f (v)
(u, v ∈G) ,
so that f ∈ℓ∞(G × G) and
f

G×G = | f |G, and then deﬁne
⟨f, ⟩= ⟨f , M⟩.
(7.2.5)
Then(1) = 1.Also,foreachs ∈G and f ∈ℓ∞(G),wehave
f · δs = δs · f
and f · δs = f , and so
⟨f · δs, ⟩= ⟨
f · δs, M⟩= ⟨δs · f , M⟩= ⟨f · δs, M⟩= ⟨f , M⟩= ⟨f, ⟩.
Thus  is left-invariant. It may be that ∥∦= 1, but this can be ﬁxed by a little
trick, and so G is amenable. (See also 11.1.2.)

Proposition 7.2.7
Let A and B be Banach algebras, and let θ : A →B be a
continuous homomorphism with θ(A) = B. Suppose that A is amenable. Then
B is amenable.
Proof This is an easy exercise.

Theorem 7.2.8
For each compact space

Stone–Weierstrass theorem, θ has dense range. Since ℓ1(G) is amenable, so is
C(
).

7.3 Additional notes
1. The algebraic cohomology groups H n(A, E) were ﬁrst deﬁned by
Hochschild (1945, 1946).
2. We can regard L(A, E) itself as an A-bimodule for the products ⋆, where
(a ⋆T )(b) = a · T b,
(T ⋆a)(b)
= T (ab) −Ta · b
(a, b ∈A, T ∈L(A, E)) .
The formal identiﬁcation of Ln+1(A, E) with Ln(A, L(A, E)) then leads
to the representation of each Ln(A, E) as an A-bimodule. We then have
a useful reduction-of-dimension formula: for k, p ∈N, we have a linear
isomorphism H k+p(A, E) ≃H k(A, Lp(A, E)).
3. Let Ln(A, E) be the space A ⊗· · · ⊗A ⊗E, where there are n copies of
A. Then L1(A, E) is an A-bimodule for the products given by
(a ⊗x) ⋆b = a ⊗x · b, b ⋆(a ⊗x)
= ba ⊗x −b ⊗a · x
(a, b ∈A, x ∈E) .
The spaces Ln(A, E) form a complex of A-bimodules for certain connecting
maps dn, and the homology groups Hn(A, E) are deﬁned to be
ker dn−1/im dn .

66
Part I
Banach algebras, H. Garth Dales
We have Hn(A, E) = {0} if and only if H n(A, E×) = {0}, where E× is the
(algebraic) dual space of E.
4. The Banach algebra analogue of Theorem 7.2.1 is the following. Now π is
a (continuous) map from A⊗A onto A.
Theorem 7.3.1
Let A be a Banach algebra. Then the following are equiv-
alent:
(a) H1(A, E) = {0} for every Banach A-bimodule E;
(b) A is unital and has a diagonal in A⊗A.
□
The conditions probably imply that A is semisimple and ﬁnite-dimensional,
but this has only been proved for various classes of Banach algebras. For a
study of this question, see Runde (1998) and Runde (2002).
5. There is a reduction-of-dimension theorem for the continuous cohomology
groups: for k, p ∈N, we have Hk+p(A, E) ≃Hk(A, B p(A, E)). It follows
that, for an amenable Banach algebra A, Hn(A, E′) = {0} for each n ∈N
and each Banach A-bimodule E.
6. A somewhat different proof of Theorem 7.2.6 is given in Bonsall and Dun-
can (1973, §43).
7. Let G be a locally compact group. Then there is a deﬁnition of ‘G is
amenable’ which is essentially the same as Deﬁnition 7.2.5, and then it is
again true (Johnson 1972a) that the group G is amenable if and only if
the Banach algebra L 1(G) is amenable; see Dales (2000, §5.6). For a proof
related to that of Theorem 7.2.6, see Stokke (2003). For a further discussion
of amenable groups, see Part II.
8. There is an industry which seeks to calculate Hn(A, E) for many special
Banach algebras A and Banach A-bimodules E. For example, let A be a
von Neumann subalgebra of B(H). Then H1(A, B(H)) is calculated in very
many cases in Sinclair and Smith (1996). It is a deep theorem of Haagerup
(1983) and others that a C∗-algebra A is amenable if and only if A is what
is called nuclear. For a new version of this proof, see Runde (2002).
9. Let A be a uniform algebra on 
. Then A is amenable if and only if
A = C(
). This is a theorem of Scheinberg, given in Helemskii (1989).
10. A Banach algebra A is said to be weakly amenable if H1(A, A′) = {0}.
Every C*-algebra and every group algebra of the form L 1(G) is weakly
amenable. A paper by Dales, Ghahramani, and Helemskii (2002) deter-
mines when the measure algebra M(G) is amenable and when it is weakly
amenable. It is an interesting open question whether every natural, weakly
amenable uniform algebra on a compact space 
 is necessarily equal to
C(
).

7
Cohomology
67
11. Let G be an amenable group, so that there is a left-invariant mean on ℓ∞(G).
Then there is another mean on ℓ∞(G) which is both left- and right-invariant;
see Dales (2000, 3.3.49).
12. Let E be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space. Then we suspect that B(E)
is never amenable. This has been proved in the case where E is a Hilbert
space by surprisingly deep methods from C*-algebra theory. It has also
been proved for the case where E is ℓ1 by Read (2001). We should like to
have a proof that establishes the result at least for each of the spaces ℓp
(for 1 ≤p ≤∞).
13. Let A be a Banach algebra with radical R, and set A = A/R. Then

: 0 →R →A
q→A →0
is a short exact sequence of Banach algebras which is an extension of A.
The sequence  is admissible in the case where R is complemented as
a Banach space, and singular if R2 = 0; in the latter case R is a Banach
A-bimodule.
The algebra A has a strong Wedderburn decomposition (SWD) if there
is a closed subalgebra B of A such that B ∼= A amd A = B ⊕R. Then
we have a theorem that shows the role of the second cohomology groups
H2(A, · ) of A: in the case where  is admissable and singular, A has a
SWD if and only if H2(A, R) = {0}.
14. Algebraic cohomolgy theory is described in Dales (2000, §1.9), and Banach
cohomology in Dales (2000, §2.8). A substantial account, from a differ-
ent perspective, is given in Helemskii (1989). The seminal deﬁnition of
‘amenable Banach algebra’ is from Johnson (1972a), where we also ﬁnd
Theorem 7.2.6. There is an enormous literature on the cohomology of C*-
algebras: for a clear introductory account, see Sinclair and Smith (1995).
An attractive new book on amenable Banach algebras is Runde (2002). A
classic text on amenability is Paterson (1988); see also Part II, Chapter 11,
of the present book. For an essay on Wedderburn decompositions, including
references to earlier work, see Bade, Dales, and Lykova (1999).

The literature on Banach algebras
There is an enormous literature on Banach algebras. A good place to start is
the ﬁne pair of books by Rudin (1973, 1996). From there, one can progress to
more specialized accounts. See also Meise and Vogt (1997).
For the general theory, consult Bonsall and Duncan (1973) and Bourbaki
(1960). A more recent account at a fairly elementary level is Helemskii (1993).
For a work with an emphasis on the cohomology of Banach algebras, see
Helemskii (1989). A comprehensive account, with an emphasis on the algebraic
side, is in Palmer (1994, 2001). Everything mentioned in this part of the book,
and a huge amount more, is contained in Dales (2000).
The classic books on uniform algebras are Gamelin (1969) and Stout (1971).
It seems that this subject is not so fashionable in recent years.
There are many texts on harmonic analysis, which is the study of the Banach
algebras L1(G). For example, see Graham and McGehee (1979), Hewitt and
Ross(1963,1970),Kahane(1970),Katznelson(1976),andReiterandStegeman
(2000).
For the theory of amenable groups and amenable Banach algebras, see
Paterson (1988) and Runde (2002).
The theory of C∗-algebras was barely mentioned in the text; this is a world-
wide industry. See the following texts, for example: Doran and Belﬁ(1986),
Kadison and Ringrose (1983, 1986), Murphy (1990), Pedersen (1979), and
Takesaki (1979, 2002).
For the connection with abstract algebra and set theory (including the con-
struction of discontinuous homomorphisms from C(
)), see Dales and Woodin
(1987, 1996).
For more advanced work on spectral theory and the (several-variable) func-
tional calculus, see Eschmeier and Putinar (1996).
For a collection of articles on Banach algebra theory, including one on the
history of 13 conferences on the subject, see Albrecht and Mathieu (1998).

Locally compact groups
The set of real numbers, R, plays several fundamental roles in mathematics. It
appears as:
r an algebraic object – either an abelian group or a ﬁeld;
r a topological space – the concepts of continuous function on R and contin-
uous curve are the most basic in topology;
r a differential manifold – differentiability of functions is deﬁned ﬁrst for
functions on R and differentiability on higher dimensional manifolds is
deﬁned in terms of real parameters; and
r a measure space – the measure of interval length is the basis for theories of
integration.
These structures are related to each other and all are important in harmonic, or
Fourier, analysis.
Locally compact groups also possess all of these structures. The algebraic
and topological structures are hypothesized but differential and measure space
properties then follow automatically. The problems and applications of har-
monic analysis extend to the more general setting of locally compact groups
and the algebraic, topological, differential and integral structures continue to
be fundamentally important.
8.1 Deﬁnition and examples
The deﬁnition of the class of locally compact groups is very simple.

Deﬁnition 8.1.1
A topological group is a group G which is also a Hausdorff
topological space so that the maps
(x, y) →xy : G × G →G
and
(8.1.1)
x →x−1 : G →G
(x, y ∈G) ,
(8.1.2)
are continuous. The topological group G is a locally compact group if the
topology on G is locally compact.
In these notes group multiplication will be denoted by juxtaposition and
the group identity will be denoted by e. The class of locally compact groups
includes many important examples.
Examples
(a) Any group is locally compact when equipped with the discrete
topology. This includes in particular all ﬁnite groups. Here are some discrete
groups which will be mentioned.
The group of integers is denoted by Z. The cyclic group of order n is denoted
by Cn.
The free group on two generators, denoted by F2, is a frequently used ex-
ample. Let the generators be a and b. Then a word in a, b, a−1, and b−1 is a
ﬁnite sequence w = l1l2 · · ·ln, where l j = a, b, a−1, or b−1 for each j. A word
w is said to be reduced if no cancellation is possible, which means that we
do not have a and a−1 as adjacent letters in w, and similarly for b and b−1.
Thus abba−1ba is reduced and abbb−1a−1ba is not reduced. If w = l1l2 · · ·ln
is reduced, then n is called the length of w and denoted by |w|.
The free group on two generators a and b consists of all reduced words in a,
b, a−1, and b−1, including the empty word which is denoted by e. Two words are
multiplied by concatenating them and then performing any cancellations until a
reduced word is achieved. Thus, for example, if w1 = aba−1 and w2 = ab−1ab,
then
w1w2 = ab(a−1a)b−1ab = a(bb−1)ab = aab .
The empty word is the identity element in F2 and, if w = l1l2 · · ·ln, then we
see that w−1 = l−1
n
· · ·l−1
2 l−1
1 .
Free groups on any number of generators are deﬁned similarly. The free
group on a countably inﬁnite number of generators will be denoted by F∞.
(b) The groups (R, +) and (C, +) with their usual topology are both locally
compact and abelian, as are (R \ {0}, ×) and (C \ {0}, ×).
Similarly, (Rn, +) and (Cn, +) are locally compact groups, and so are all
matrix groups over R and C. Thus for instance SL(n, R), GL(n, C) and SO(n)

8
Locally compact groups
77
are locally compact groups with the subspace topology they inherit as subsets
of Rn2 or Cn2.
These matrix groups are all examples of Lie groups. A Lie group is a group
which is also a differential manifold such that the group operations (8.1.1) and
(8.1.2) are not just continuous but analytic.
(c) The circle group T := {z ∈C : |z| = 1} with the usual multiplication of
complex numbers is a compact Lie group. It is isomorphic to the rotation group
SO(2).
Any product of compact groups with the product topology is a compact
group, by Tychonov’s theorem. Thus T ∞is a compact group but is not a Lie
group. The inﬁnite product (C2) ∞of copies of the cyclic group of order 2 is
also a compact group.
(d) The ﬁeld Qp of p-adic numbers is a locally compact ﬁeld. Hence (Qp, +)
and (Qp \ {0}, ×) are locally compact abelian groups. The open subgroup
(Zp, +) of p-adic integers is compact.
In the same way as for the ﬁelds R and C, matrix groups over Qp are locally
compact groups with the subspace topology as subsets of Q n2
p . The notion of
an analytic map over Qp may be deﬁned as well and so may the notion of Lie
group over Qp.
The ﬁeld k((X)) of Laurent series over the ﬁnite ﬁeld k is locally compact.
The topology on this ﬁeld is deﬁned by letting the subgroups
k[[X]]n :=

f =
∞

j=n
k j X j : k j ∈k

be a base of neighbourhoods of 0. The subring k[[X]] = k[[X]]0 of Taylor
series over k is then compact and open, and the topology on k[[X]] is just the
product topology on k ∞. Matrix groups over k((X)) are also locally compact
groups.
(e) Let G be a locally ﬁnite graph. Then the automorphism group Aut(G)
equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets is a locally
compact group.
In particular, let Tq be the homogeneous tree where every vertex has de-
gree (or valency) q + 1. Then Aut(Tq) is a locally compact group. A base of
neighbourhoods for the identity e consists of the stabilizer subgroups
V (F) :=

x ∈Aut(Tq) : x(v) = v (v ∈F)

,
where F ranges over all ﬁnite subsets of the vertex set V . Then V (F) is a
compact open subgroup for each F.

8.2 Structure theory
Here are a couple of often used facts about topological groups whose proofs
are left as exercises.
Lemma 8.2.1
Let G be a locally compact group and V be a neighbourhood
of e. Then there is a symmetric neighbourhood W of e with compact closure
such that W 2 ⊂V .
□
Lemma 8.2.2
Let G be a topological group. Let K and U subsets of G with
K compact, U open and K ⊂U. Then there is an open neighbourhood V of e
such that
V K ∪K V ⊂U .
□
The following result is the starting point of the structure theory of locally
compact groups.
Theorem 8.2.3
Let G be a locally compact group. Then the connected com-
ponent of the identity, called Ge, is a closed normal subgroup, and the quotient
group G/Ge is a totally disconnected locally compact group.
Proof Connected components are always closed. We show that Ge is a normal
subgroup.
Let x and y be in Ge. Then e and x are in the same connected component and
so ey = y and xy also belong to the same component (because right translation
by y is a homeomorphism, see Exercise 8.4.1). Since y ∈Ge it follows that
xy ∈Ge. The map x →x−1 is also a homeomorphism and it ﬁxes e. Hence
G−1
e
= Ge and so Ge is a subgroup.
Next, let x ∈G. Then the conjugation map y →xyx−1 is a homeomorphism
and so xGex−1 is a connected component of G. Since conjugation ﬁxes e, we
have xGex−1 = Ge.
Since Ge is closed, G/Ge is Hausdorff. The image of a compact neighbour-
hood of e in G will be a compact neighbourhood of the identity in G/Ge. Hence
G/Ge is locally compact. The connected components in G/Ge consist of single
points, that is, G/Ge is totally disconnected.
□
The detailed study of the structure of locally compact groups thus divides
into the study of connected and of totally disconnected groups separately and
then of extensions.
Among the examples described above, the groups Rn, SL(n, R), T, and
C \ {0} are connected. Discrete groups are totally disconnected, but some

8
Locally compact groups
79
more interesting examples include matrix groups over Qp and k((X)), inﬁ-
nite products (Cn)∞and automorphism groups of locally ﬁnite graphs, such as
Aut(Tq).
Connected groups are relatively well understood through the following the-
orem. It was proved in the early 1950s by Gleason (1952), Montgomery and
Zippin (1952), and Yamabe (1953), and is the solution of Hilbert’s 5th problem.
Uniﬁed accounts are given in Montgomery and Zippin (1955) and Kaplansky
(1971).
Theorem 8.2.4 (Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin, Yamabe)
Let G be a con-
nected locally compact group, and let O be a neighbourhood of e. Then there
is a compact normal subgroup K ⊂O such that G/K is a Lie group.
□
The theorem shows that analytic structure emerges naturally in connected
groups, even though only topological structure is assumed. Many results about
connected locally compact groups are established by factoring out a small com-
pact normal subgroup and then applying Lie group techniques to the quotient.
This approach is known as ‘approximation by Lie groups’. The theorem also
says that each connected group is a projective limit of Lie groups or, in other
words, every connected group is pro-Lie.
The following result due to van Dantzig (1936) is the starting point for the
structure theory of totally disconnected locally compact groups.
Theorem 8.2.5 (van Dantzig)
Let G be a totally disconnected locally compact
group, and let O be a neighbourhood of e. Then there is a compact open
subgroup U ⊂O.
□
Note that each totally disconnected locally compact space has a base of
neigbourhoods consisting of compact open subsets and therefore has inductive
dimension equal to zero. For this reason totally disconnected locally compact
groups are also known as 0-dimensional groups. Van Dantzig’s theorem says
that there is in fact a base of neighbourhoods of e consisting of compact open
subgroups.
In the case where G is compact more can be said.
Corollary 8.2.6
Let G be a totally disconnected compact group. Then G has
a base of neighbourhoods of the identity consisting of compact open normal
subgroups. Hence G is proﬁnite and is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a
product of ﬁnite groups.
□

The theorem does not assert that, for a general totally disconnected locally
compact group, there is a base of neighbourhoods of compact open normal
subgroupshowever,andgroupssuchas SL(n, Qp)andAut(Tq)havenocompact
open normal subgroup. Although particular examples of these types are well
understood, the general theory of totally disconnected groups did not progress
far beyond van Dantzig’s theorem for a long time. Relatively recent progress
on the structure theory of totally disconnected groups (see Willis 1994, 2001,
2002) determines just how such groups may fail to have compact open normal
subgroups. It introduces methods which begin to parallel the Lie techniques
used to analyze connected groups.
When G is abelian, the structure of G can be described more fully. The
following theorem may be found in Hewitt and Ross (1979), Morris (1997) and
Rudin (1962).
Theorem 8.2.7
Let G be a compactly generated locally compact abelian
group. Then G is isomorphic to Rm × Zn × K, where m and n are non-negative
integers and K is a compact group.
□
A compactly generated group is one which is generated by a compact sub-
set. In a locally compact group, any compact neighbourhood of the identity
generates an open subgroup. Hence every locally compact abelian group has
an open compactly generated subgroup to which Theorem 8.2.7 applies. The
requirement that G be compactly generated is essential: the group (Qp, +) is
not compactly generated and does not satisfy the conclusion of the theorem.
Many classes of locally compact groups have been studied and some also
have more-or-less complete structure theories. These classes are given names
such as the [SIN]-groups (those which have arbitrarily small neighbourhoods
of e invariant under conjugation) and the [Z]-groups (those for which the
quotient by the centre is compact). An excellent survey of the current state
of knowledge of classes of locally compact groups can be found in Palmer
(2001).
8.3 Haar measure
The familiar Lebesgue measure on R is related to the additive group structure
because it is invariant under translation, that is, the measure of a set is equal
to the measure of its translate by any real number. Equivalently, the integral of
any function on R is equal to the integral of its translate by any real number.
All locally compact groups support a translation-invariant Borel measure. The
σ-algebra of Borel subsets of the locally compact group G will be denoted by
B(G).

Theorem 8.3.1 (Haar)
Let G be a locally compact group. Then there is a
positive Borel measure, mG, on G satisfying the following properties for every
B ∈B(G):
1. mG(x B) = mG(B) for each x ∈G;
2. mG(B) = inf{mG(U) : B ⊂U, U is open} and mG(U) > 0 for every non-
empty, open set U;
3. mG(B) = sup{mG(K) : K ⊂B, K is compact}.
Any measure satisfying these properties is equal to a positive multiple of mG.
□
The measure mG is called the Haar measure on G. Property 1 says that mG
is translation-invariant, while Properties 2 and 3 say that mG is a regular Borel
measure. When there is no ambiguity the Haar measure will be denoted simply
by m.
The translation-invariant measure was constructed for compact groups by
von Neumann, and he also proved the uniqueness up to a positive multiple.
The translation-invariant measure on locally compact groups was constructed
by Haar; see Hewitt and Ross (1979).
The Haar measure need not be right-invariant. However, if we ﬁx a Haar
measure m then, for each x ∈G, the measure mx : B →m(Bx), B(G)) →C,
is left-invariant and so is equal to a positive multiple of m.
Deﬁnition 8.3.2
Let m be a left-invariant Haar measure on G, and, for each
x ∈G, let (x) be the positive scalar such that mx = (x)m. Then the map
 : G →(R+, ×) is a continuous group homomorphism;  is called the mod-
ular function on G.
If  ≡1, then G is a unimodular group.
If G is discrete, then the counting measure is translation-invariant and it is
conventional to work with this measure.
Proposition 8.3.3
The locally compact group G is compact if and only if
mG(G) < ∞.
□
For compact groups it is conventional to normalize the Haar measure so that
mG(G) equals 1. Finite groups are both discrete and compact and these two
conventions are not consistent in this case.
In the case of compact groups there is an alternative way to produce the Haar
measure as a limit of convolution powers of a probability measure. The idea of
using convolution powers of a probability measure, or equivalently a random

walk on a group G, to obtain information about G will be used in some of the
results mentioned in later chapters.
Theorem 8.3.4 (Kawada–Itˆo)
Let G be a compact group, and let µ be a
probability measure on G such that the support of µ generates G. Then the
sequence of probability measures


converges to the Haar measure on G in the weak-∗topology on M(G).
□
A. Weil shows how a translation-invariant measure m on a group G may be
used to deﬁne a topology on G which essentially turns it into a locally compact
group and turns m into Haar measure (Halmos 1950; Weil 1951). Thus locally
compact groups are the only topological groups which support a translation-
invariant measure. This is an important observation because, as will be seen
later, the Haar measure is used to produce unitary representations of locally
compact groups.
This section concludes with the deﬁnitions of some spaces of functions on
groups and of the idea of the translate of a function.
Deﬁnition 8.3.5
Let f be a function on the group G. The left translate of f
by a ∈G is the function a f deﬁned by
a f (y) = f (a−1y)
(y ∈G) .
The right translate of f by a ∈G is the function fa deﬁned by
fa(y) = f (ya)
(y ∈G) .
Deﬁnition 8.3.6
Let G be a locally compact group.
(i) The space of bounded continuous functions on G will be denoted by C(G)
and the subspace of functions which converge to zero at inﬁnity by C0(G).
The norm of a function f in C(G) is
∥f ∥∞:= sup{| f (x)| : x ∈G} .

8.5 Additional notes
1. The structure theory of locally compact ﬁelds is more complete than that
of locally compact groups. It was shown by D. van Dantzig in the 1930s
that there are only two connected locally compact ﬁelds, namely R and
C. Shortly afterwards L. Pontryagin completely classiﬁed the non-discrete
totally disconnected locally compact ﬁelds. They are Qp and their ﬁnite
extensions (these are all the characteristic 0 ﬁelds) and k((X)) for k some
ﬁnite ﬁeld (these are all the positive characteristic ﬁelds).
The locally compact skew ﬁelds were completely classiﬁed by
N. Jacobson, also in the 1930s. There is one extra connected skew ﬁeld,

namely the quaternions, and the totally disconnected skew ﬁelds are all
division algebras over Qp or k((X)). See Weil (1995) and Jacobson (1980).
Pontryagin (1946) calls this the ‘logical necessity’ of these ﬁelds.
2. Discrete, compact, and abelian groups are all unimodular. An example of
a group which is not unimodular is the so-called ax + b-group. This is the
group of afﬁne motions of the line; it is isomorphic to the matrix group

3. The rate of convergence of the sequence of probability measures in Theorem
8.3.4 is of some interest; see work of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste (1995, 1996)
on ﬁnite groups. They compute the rate of convergence to the Haar measure
of powers of speciﬁc probability measures.

Group algebras and representations
Several Banach algebras may be associated with each locally compact group.
All of them are generalizations to locally compact groups of the algebraic group
algebra CG of the discrete group G.
Abstract harmonic analysis is essentially the study of the structure of these
Banach algebras. The development of Banach algebra theory was driven, in
part, by work on harmonic analysis.
Throughout this chapter, G is a locally compact group.
9.1 Convolution algebras
Deﬁnition 9.1.1
Let µ and ν belong to M(G). Their convolution is the
bounded measure µ ⋆ν deﬁned by
µ ⋆ν(B) = (µ × ν) ({(x, y) ∈G × G : xy ∈B})
(B ∈B(G)) .
For each µ ∈M(G), the adjoint of µ is the measure µ∗deﬁned by
µ∗(B) = µ(B−1)
(B ∈B(G)) .
Proposition 9.1.2
Convolution (µ, ν) →µ ⋆ν is an associative algebra
product on M(G), and satisﬁes ∥µ ⋆ν∥≤∥µ∥∥ν∥. The adjoint map µ →µ∗is
aconjugatelinearinvolutionon M(G),and(µ ⋆ν)∗= ν∗⋆µ∗.Thus(M(G), ⋆)
is a Banach ∗-algebra, called the measure algebra of the locally compact
group G.
□
The subspace of M(G) consisting of the discrete measures on G will be
denoted by Md(G), the subspace of continuous measures by Mc(G), and the
subspace of measures absolutely continuous with respect to Haar measure by
Ma(G).
86

9
Group algebras and representations
87
Proposition 9.1.3
(i) Md(G) is a subalgebra of M(G), and Mc(G) and Ma(G) are closed two-
sided ideals in M(G).
(ii) M(G) = Mc(G) ⊕Md(G), and the quotient algebra M(G)/Mc(G) is iso-
morphic to Md(G).
□
Proposition 9.1.4 (Hewitt and Ross 1979, Theorem 20.10)
The space Ma(G)
is isometrically isomorphic to the Lebesgue space L1(G) := L1(G, m) via
f ∈L1(G) →f · m ∈Ma(G) .
This isomorphism induces the convolution product ⋆on L1(G) speciﬁed by
f ⋆g(x) =

G
f (y)g(y−1x) dm(y)
( f, g ∈L1(G), a.e.(m)x ∈G) ,
and the isometric involution ∗speciﬁed by
f ∗(x) = f (x−1)(x)−1
( f ∈L1(G), x ∈G) .
□
The convolution formulæ in the proposition agree with those deﬁned in Part I
on Banach algebras for the special cases where G is discrete or equal to R.
Deﬁnition 9.1.5
The algebra (L1(G), ⋆, ∗) is the group algebra of the locally
compact group G. When G is discrete, L1(G) may be denoted by ℓ1(G).
The identiﬁcation of Ma(G) with L1(G) induces a convolution, µ ⋆f , for all
µ ∈M(G) and f ∈L1(G). Since Ma(G) is an ideal in M(G), µ ⋆f belongs
to L1(G).
Proposition 9.1.6
For each f ∈L1(G), the map x →δx ⋆f =x f is contin-
uous with respect to the given topology on G and the norm topology on L1(G).
□
When G is discrete M(G) = L1(G) = ℓ1(G) and this algebra has the identity
δe. When G is not discrete, L1(G) has a bounded approximate identity.
Deﬁnition 9.1.7
Let A be a Banach algebra. A left bounded approximate
identity for A is a net {uλ} in A such that supλ ∥uλ∥< ∞and
lim
λ ∥a −uλa∥= 0
(a ∈A) .

88
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
The notions of right bounded approximate identity and two-sided bounded
approximate identity are deﬁned similarly. Let X be a Banach left A-module
(see Part I, Chapter 5). Then a left bounded approximate identity {uλ} for A is
an approximate identity for X if uλ · x →x (x ∈X).
Proposition 9.1.8
Let {Eλ} be a base of compact neighbourhoods of the iden-
tity in G. This forms a net directed by inclusion. For each λ, let uλ = 1Eλ/m(Eλ).
Then ∥uλ∥1 = 1 for every λ and for every f ∈L1(G), and
∥f −f ⋆uλ∥1
λ→0
and
∥f −uλ ⋆f ∥1
λ→0 .
□
Thus L1(G) has a two-sided bounded approximate identity. The proof is an
exercise. One reason for the signiﬁcance of bounded approximate identities
is the following factorization theorem. The basic version of the theorem is
due to P. J. Cohen, but it has many applications and has been strengthened by
many authors, such as (Kisy´nski 2000). See also Bonsall and Duncan (1973,
Theorem 11.10) and Dales (2000, Theorem 2.9.24).
Theorem 9.1.9 (Cohen factorization)
Let A be a Banach algebra with a left
bounded approximate identity {uλ}, and let X be a Banach left A-module such
that {uλ} is an approximate identity for X. Then, for every element x ∈X, there
are a ∈A and y ∈X such that x = a · y. In particular, if I is a closed left
ideal in A and (bn) is a sequence in I with ∥bn∥
n→0, then there are a ∈A and
a sequence (cn) in I with ∥cn∥
n→0 in I such that bn = acn (n ∈N).
□
Corollary 9.1.10
Each f in L1(G) is a product f = g ⋆h, where we also have
g, h ∈L1(G). Moreover, if ( fn) is a sequence in L1(G) such that ∥fn∥
n→0,
then there are g, hn in L1(G) such that ∥hn∥
n→0 and fn = g ⋆hn (n ∈N).□
The group algebra L1(G) retains all information about G, as was shown by
Wendel (1952).
Theorem 9.1.11 (Wendel)
Let T : L1(G1) →L1(G2) be an isometric alge-
bra isomorphism. Then there is a continuous group isomorphism ϑ : G1 →G2
and there is a group character χ on G2 such that
T f (x) = χ(x)( f ◦ϑ−1)(x)
( f ∈L1(G1), x ∈G2) .
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that G1 is discrete, so that L1(G1) = ℓ1(G). Then the unit
ball in ℓ1(G1) is the convex hull of its extreme points and these are precisely
the points of the form tδx, where |t| = 1 and x ∈G1. Since T is an isometry,

9
Group algebras and representations
89
it follows that the unit ball in L1(G2) is the convex hull of its extreme points.
Hence the Haar measure on G2 is the counting measure and it follows that G2
is discrete.
For each x ∈G1, T (δx) is an extreme point of the unit ball in ℓ1(G2) and so
equals tδy, where |t| = 1 and y ∈G2. Deﬁne ϑ(x) = y and χ(h) = t. That ϑ
is a group isomorphism and χ is a character follows from the fact that T is an
algebra isomorphism.
The proof when G1 is not discrete is sketched after the next result, which it
uses.
□
Since L1(G) is an ideal in M(G), each bounded measure µ on G deﬁnes a
multiplication operator Mµ : f →µ ⋆f on L1(G). Clearly, Mµ satisﬁes the
identity,
Mµ( f ⋆g) = Mµ( f ) ⋆g
( f, g ∈L1(G)) .
A linear operator satisfying this identity is called a left multiplier. As was ﬁrst
shown by Wendel (1952), every left multiplier arises in this way.
Theorem 9.1.12 (Wendel)
Let M be a left multiplier on L1(G). Then M is
continuous, and there is a unique measure µ ∈M(G) such that M = Mµ.
Proof
Proof Suppose that ( fn) is a sequence in L1(G) such that ∥fn∥
n→0.
Then, by Corollary 9.1.10, there is g ∈L1(G) and a sequence (hn) in L1(G)
such that ∥hn∥
n→0 and fn = g ⋆hn for each n. Hence
M( fn) = M(g ⋆hn) = M(g) ⋆hn
n→0 .
Therefore M is continuous. (In fact, the continuity of M was hypothesized by
Wendel and this hypothesis was removed later by B. E. Johnson.)
Choose a bounded approximate identity {uλ} for L1(G). Then {M(uλ)} is
a bounded net in L1(G). Recalling that L1(G) is a subspace of M(G) and
that M(G) is the dual space of C0(G), it follows that {M(uλ)} has a weak-∗
accumulation point, µ say, in M(G). It may be veriﬁed that M = Mµ.
□
The proof of the non-discrete case of Theorem 9.1.11 may be completed by
lifting the isometric isomorphism T to be an isomorphism of multiplier algebras
and hence, following Wendel’s Theorem, an isomorphism M(G1) →M(G2).
Since the extreme points of the unit ball in M(G) are precisely those measures
of the form tδg, where |t| = 1 and g ∈G, the argument used in the discrete
case applies.

Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
Recall that a derivation on a Banach algebra A is a linear map D satisfying
the identity D(ab) = aD(b) + D(a)b (a, b ∈A). See Chapter 6 for more on
derivations. Each measure µ ∈M(G) determines a derivation, Dµ, on L1(G)
deﬁned by
Dµ( f ) = f ⋆µ −µ ⋆f
( f ∈L1(G)) .
At ﬁrst sight it might seem that it would be as straightforward as the proof of
Wendel’s Theorem to show that every derivation on L1(G) arises in this way.
This seems to be difﬁcult to prove however.
9.1.13 Problem
Let D be a derivation on L1(G). Does there exist a measure
µ ∈M(G) such that D = Dµ?
This question has been answered afﬁrmatively by B. E. Johnson for [SIN]-
groups (and hence for all discrete groups), connected groups, and amenable
groups (Johnson 1972, 2001). It has not been solved for all totally disconnected
groups, and nor has it been solved for extensions of connected groups by discrete
ones. (In fact, a positive solution to this problem has recently been announced
by V. Losert.)
9.2 Representations on Hilbert space
There is a correspondence between ∗-representations of L1(G) on Hilbert space
and continuous (with respect to the strong operator topology) unitary represen-
tations of G. (A unitary representation of G is a homomorphism from G into
the group of unitary operators on some Hilbert space.)
Proposition 9.2.1
Let V : G →B(H) be a unitary representation of G on the
Hilbert space H such that the map x →Vxv, G →H, is continuous for every
v ∈H. For f ∈L1(G), deﬁne
RV ( f ) =

G
f (x)Vx dm(x) .
(9.2.1)
Then RV : L1(G) →B(H) is a continuous ∗-representation of L1(G).
Conversely, every non-degenerate ∗-representation of L1(G) on Hilbert
space is equal to RV for some unitary representation V of G.
Proof The proof of the ﬁrst part is an exercise. For the proof of the second part,
note that, if R is a non-degenerate ∗-representation of L1(G), then Theorem
9.1.9impliesthat,foreveryv ∈H,thereare f ∈L1(G)andv′ ∈Hsuchthatv =
R( f )v′. A unitary representation V of G on H is then well-deﬁned by setting
Vgv = R(δg ⋆f )v′
(g ∈G, v ∈H) .
Then R may be recovered from V via the deﬁnition (9.2.1).
□

9
Group algebras and representations
91
Locally compact groups and their group algebras have natural representations
on the Hilbert space L2(G) := L2(G, m). The existence of Haar measure is thus
crucial for the existence of unitary representations of such groups.
Deﬁnition 9.2.2
For each x ∈G, let Ux be the unitary operator on L2(G)
deﬁned by
Ux f (y) = f (x−1y)
( f ∈L2(G), y ∈G) .
Then U : x →Ux is a representation of G on L2(G) and is continuous with re-
spect to the given topology on G and the strong operator topology on B(L2(G)).
The map U is the left regular representation of G on L2(G).
The strong operator closed subalgebra of B(L2(G)) generated by
{Ux : x ∈G}
is the von Neumann algebra of G; it is denoted by V N(G).
As shown in Proposition 9.2.1, there is a representation of L1(G) on L2(G)
corresponding to the left regular representation of G.
Deﬁnition 9.2.3
For each g ∈L1(G), let R(g) be the operator on L2(G)
deﬁned by
R(g) f (y) =

G
g(x) f (x−1y) dm(x)
( f ∈L2(G), y ∈G) .
Then R : L1(G) →B(L2(G)) is an injective ∗-homomorphism and ∥R∥= 1.
The map R is the left regular representation of L1(G) on L2(G).
The norm-closed subalgebra of B(L2(G)) generated by R(L1(G)) is the
reduced C*-algebra of G; it is denoted by C∗
r (G).
The full C*-algebra of G, denoted by C∗(G), is the enveloping C*-algebra of
L1(G) (see Palmer (2001, Deﬁnition 10.1.10) for the deﬁnition of the enveloping
C*-algebra).
Theorem 9.1.11 of Wendel shows that the group algebra L1(G) determines
G uniquely, but the same is not true for the C*-algebras C∗(G) and C∗
r (G) and
the von Neumann algebra V N(G), as is seen in Exercise 9.4.1.
Amongtheunitaryrepresentationsof G themostimportantaretheirreducible
ones. Every representation may be decomposed into irreducible representations.
Deﬁnition 9.2.4
The unitary representation V of G on the Hilbert space H
is reducible if H is the direct sum H = H1 ⊕H2 of proper subspaces such that
V (H j) = H j for j = 1, 2. A unitary representation which is not reducible is
irreducible.

Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
Unitaryrepresentationsofthegroup G arestudiedviathe∗-representationsof
C∗
r (G) and C∗(G). It is the deﬁning property of the enveloping C*-algebra that
there is a correspondence between ∗-representations of L1(G) (and therefore, by
Proposition 9.2.1, unitary representations of G) and ∗-representations of C∗(G).
One of the basic theorems about C*-algebras asserts that they have sufﬁciently
many irreducible ∗-representations to separate every non-zero point from 0.
Since the ∗-homomorphism R : L1(G) →C∗
r (G) is injective and has dense
range, it follows that there are sufﬁciently many irreducible representations of
L1(G) to separate every non-zero point from 0.
Theorem 9.2.5
Let G be a locally compact group. Then L1(G) is a semisimple
Banach algebra.
□
It also follows that there are sufﬁciently many unitary representations of G
to separate every non-identity element from e.
Theorem 9.2.6 (Gelfand-Raikov)
Let G be a locally compact group, and let
x ̸= e be in G. Then there is an irreducible, continuous unitary representation
V of G on a Hilbert space H such that V (x) ̸= IH.
□
The ‘sufﬁciently many’ ∗-representations of L1(G) guaranteed by these the-
orems are in fact representations of the reduced C*-algebra C∗
r (G). It may be
that there are other irreducible ∗-representations and in this case the full C*-
algebra C∗(G) is not the same as C∗
r (G). This phenomenon is discussed further
in Chapter 11; see Proposition 11.2.5.
Deﬁnition 9.2.7
Let V be a unitary representation of the locally compact
group G, and let RV be the ∗-representation of L1(G) deﬁned in (9.2.1). Then
V is weakly contained in the regular representation of G if ∥RV ( f )∥≤∥R( f )∥
for every f ∈L1(G).
One of the basic problems in harmonic analysis is to describe in some way
all the irreducible unitary representations of a given locally compact group G.
There are no completely general techniques for doing this and each descrip-
tion relies on particular properties of G. A great deal is known about unitary
representations of semisimple Lie goups and nilpotent Lie groups but there is
also still much to learn. The class of groups for which the representation the-
ory is most satisfactory is that of abelian groups. Representations of abelian
subgroups are also an important tool in the study of representations of other
classes of groups.

9.3 The Fourier transform
When G is abelian, L1(G), C∗(G), and V N(G) are commutative Banach alge-
bras. These algebras, which are discussed in Part I, are best understood with
the aid of the Fourier transform. In order to deﬁne this transform we must ﬁrst
say something about the irreducible representations of G.
Every irreducible unitary representation of a locally compact abelian group G
is one-dimensional. The irreducible representations thus correspond to bounded
homomorphisms from G to the multiplicative group T of non-zero complex
numbers, that is, to characters on G (see §3.4). The set  of all continuous
characters is itself an abelian group with respect to pointwise multiplication:
⟨x, γ1 + γ2⟩= ⟨x, γ1⟩⟨x, γ2⟩
(x ∈G, γ1, γ2 ∈) ,
where we write ⟨x, γ ⟩for γ (x). When equipped with the topology of uniform
convergence on compact subsets of G,  is also a locally compact group and is
called the dual group of G. The dual group of G is sometimes denoted by G.
For example, each character on Z has the form γz : n →zn for some z ∈T,
and it is easily seen that in fact Z ∼= T (exercise). With a little more work it
may be shown that each continuous character on T has the form γn : z →zn for
some n ∈Z, and that T ∼= Z. Similarly, each continuous character on R has the
form γy : t →eiyt for some y ∈R and R ∼= R. These basic examples and the
structure theory of locally compact abelian groups, Theorem 8.2.7, facilitate
the description of the dual group, that is, the set of irreducible representations,
of any abelian group.
Let G be a locally compact abelian group with dual group . For f ∈L 1(G),
the Fourier transform of f is the function f , deﬁned on  by the formula
f (γ ) =

G
f (s)⟨−s, γ ⟩dm(s)
(γ ∈) .
(9.3.1)
For example, if G = R, then
f (y) =
 ∞
−∞
f (t) e−iyt dt
(y ∈R) .
You are asked to show in an exercise that the Fourier transform converts the con-
volution product in L1(G) to pointwise product of functions on  and converts
the adjoint in L1(G) to complex conjugation.
Set
A() = {f : f ∈L 1(G)} ,

Analysis and amenability, George Willis
the range of the Fourier transform, as in §3.4. The Riemann–Lebesgue lemma
(see Rudin 1966, §5.14; or Helson 1983, §1.2) shows that A() is contained in
C0(). The Fourier transform is therefore a ∗-homomorphism from L1(G) into
C0().
Theorem 9.3.1
Let G be a locally compact abelian group. Then the Fourier
transform
F : f →f ,
L 1(G) →A() ⊂C0() ,
is continuous ∗-homomorphism with ∥F∥= 1.
□
In fact, the formula (9.3.1) when restricted to f ∈C00(G) ⊂L1(G) deﬁnes
an isometry with respect to the L2-norm. This isometry extends by continuity
to L2(G). The extended map is also known as the Fourier transform, and is also
denoted by F.
Theorem 9.3.2
Let G be a locally compact abelian group. Then the Fourier
transform
F : g →g,
L2(G) →L2() ,
is an isometric isomorphism. It satisﬁes the identity

(R( f )g)(γ ) = f (γ )g(γ )
( f ∈L1(G), g ∈L2(G), γ ∈) .
(9.3.2)
□
Equation (9.3.2) shows that the Fourier transform converts the regular rep-
resentation of L1(G) on L2(G) to a representation of A() by multiplication
operators on L2(). Since A() is self-adjoint and separates points in , the
Stone–Weierstrass theorem (Dunford and Schwartz 1958, Theorem IV.6.16)
shows that A() is dense in C0(), and it follows that C∗
r (G) is isomorphic
to C0(). Since  is the set of all irreducible representations of G, equation
(9.3.2) shows that every irreducible representation is weakly contained in the
regular representation and so C∗(G) = C∗
r (G) when G is abelian. (The fact that
 coincides with the set of all characters on L1(G) is Theorem 3.4.2 in Part I;
there is a full proof in Dales (2000, Theorem 2.5.4).) Further reasoning shows
that V N(G) is isomorphic to L∞().

9
Group algebras and representations
95
The Fourier transform of L1(G) to A() and the isomorphism of C∗(G)
with C0() are special cases of the Gelfand transform of commutative Banach
algebras. This transform is discussed in Part I, Chapter 3.
The convolution algebra M(G) is also a commutative Banach algebra. The
Fourier transform extends from L1(G) (identiﬁed with the ideal Ma(G)) to
M(G). This extension is called the Fourier–Stieltjes transform, and denoted by
µ →µ for µ ∈M(G). Here µ is deﬁned by
µ(γ ) =

G
γ (−s) dµ(s)
(γ ∈) .
(9.3.3)
The Fourier–Stieltjes transform is a ∗-homomorphism from M(G) onto an
algebra of continuous functions on ; the range of the transform is denoted by
B() and called the Fourier–Stieltjes algebra.
It is no longer the case however that the irreducible (one-dimensional) rep-
resentations of M(G) correspond to the irreducible representations of G. In the
terms introduced in Part I, not every character on M(G) corresponds to a char-
acter on G, and the Fourier–Stieltjes transform is not the same as the Gelfand
transform on M(G). Indeed, since M(G)/Mc(G) ∼= Md(G) (Proposition 9.1.3)
and Md(G) ∼= ℓ1(G), the character space of M(G) contains a copy of the dual
group of G with the discrete topology. The Banach algebra M(G) has been stud-
ied in some depth when G is abelian and many additional characters have been
identiﬁed (Taylor 1973). The character space of M(G) even contains analytic
discs (Brown and Moran 1976, 1978), which means that M(G) has quotients
isomorphic to algebras of analytic functions.

9.5 Additional notes
1. Wendel’s theorem (9.1.11) has been improved by N. J. Kalton amd G. V.
Wood by weakening the requirement that T be an isometry to require only
that it have small norm; see Kalton and Wood (1976) and Wood (1989).
Galindo (2000) considers the still weaker condition that T is an isomorphism
of topological algebras, but G1 and G2 are abelian and torsion-free.
2. Building on earlier work of Cohen (1960), Kepert (1997) has shown that
homomorphisms T : L1(G1) →L1(G2), where G1 and G2 are abelian, have
a very precise description and that they automatically have closed range.
3. The factorization theorem 9.1.9 was proved by Cohen (1959) in order to
answer the question of whether every element of L1(G) is a product. This
had previously been shown to be the case for certain locally compact groups
by Rudin (1957).
4. The theory of the decomposition of unitary representations of groups,
or, equivalently, of non-degenerate representations of C*-algebras, into

It has a norm ∥· ∥deﬁned by
∥h∥= inf{∥f ∥2∥g∥2 : h = f ⋆g, f, g ∈L2()} ,
which is in fact a Banach algebra norm on A(). When  = G is abelian,
A() is isomorphic to the convolution algebra L1(G). The Fourier algebra
was introduced by Eymard (1964). It carries a great deal of information
about ; see, for example, Forrest (1992) and Dales (2000, 4.5.30).

Convolution operators
The structures of the various group algebras A associated with G, which is
a large part of harmonic analysis, is best understood when G is abelian or
compact. In these cases the multiplication operators
Ma : f →a ⋆f
(a ∈L1(G), f ∈A) ,
are decomposable in the sense of Part IV, Deﬁnition 21.1.4.
10.1 Compact groups
If G is a compact group, then, for every a ∈L1(G), the convolution operator
Ma is a compact operator on L1(G) (Exercise 10.4.1) and on L2(G) (Exercise
10.4.2). Therefore, as shown in Chapter 21 on decomposable operators, Ma is
decomposable. The decomposability of this operator may be used to analyse
the ideal structure of L1(G). We begin by identifying elements in the centre of
L1(G).
Lemma 10.1.1
Let G be a compact group, and let U be an open neigbourhood
of e. Then there is a neighbourhood e ∋V ⊂U such that xVx−1 = V for every
x ∈G.
Proof
Since U is open, G \ U is compact. The function
(x, y) →xyx−1 : G × (G \ U) →G \ {e}
is continuous. Hence its image is compact, and it is also clearly invariant
under conjugation by elements of G. Choose V to be the complement of this
image.

If V is a neighbourhood of e which is invariant under conjugation, then
V ∩V−1 is invariant and symmetric.
Lemma 10.1.2
Let V be a symmetric neighbourhood of e which is invariant
under conjugation, and put u = 1V/m(V). Then u is a self-adjoint element of
the centre of L1(G).
Proof
That u is self-adjoint follows because it is a real-valued function and
V is symmetric.
To see that u is in the centre, let f ∈L1(G). Then, for each x ∈G, we have
f ⋆u(x) =

and so u is in the centre.
□
The group algebra L1(G) may now be analysed as a sum of full matrix
algebras.
Theorem 10.1.3
Let G be a compact group. Then
L2(G) =

σ∈$
Hσ

ℓ2
,
where each Hσ is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of L2(G) invariant under the left
regular representation U (see Deﬁnition 9.2.2). For each σ, there is a minimal
central idempotent zσ in L1(G) such that Hσ = zσ ⋆L2(G). Moreover, for each
σ, zσ ⋆L1(G) := Iσ is a minimal two-sided ideal in L1(G) and is isomorphic
to a full matrix algebra. The ideal 
σ∈$ Iσ is dense in L1(G).
Proof Let u = 1E/m(E), where E is a symmetric neighbourhood of e invariant
under conjugation. Then Mu is a compact, self-adjoint operator on L2(G).
Hence L2(G) is the direct sum of the eigenspaces of Mu.
Let H be an eigenspace of Mu corresponding to a non-zero eigenvalue. Then
there is a projection P in the algebra generated by Mu such that H = P(L2(G)).

100
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
Infact,thereis z inthealgebrageneratedbyu suchthat P = Mz.Sinceu belongs
to the centre of L1(G), by Lemma 10.1.2, so does z. Hence for each x ∈G we
have
Ux(H) = δx ⋆H = δx ⋆z ⋆H = z ⋆δx ⋆H ⊂H .
The eigenspace is thus G-invariant.
It must be shown that there are sufﬁciently many eigenspaces corresponding
to non-zero eigenvalues for L2(G) to be their direct sum. For this, consider all
central functions of the form u = 1E/m(E) := uE. Note that
U := {uE : e ∈E = E−1, xEx−1 = E (x ∈G)}
is a commuting family of functions, and so the corresponding convolution
operators on L2(G) have common eigenspaces. Suppose that f belongs to the
zero eigenspace for all uE ∈U. Then, since U contains an approximate identity
for L2(G) (by Exercise 9.4.2), f = 0. Hence L2(G) is the direct sum of ﬁnite-
dimensional eigenspaces for U. For each of these eigenspaces there is a central
idempotent in L1(G) which projects onto it, and so it is invariant under U(G).
Since G is compact, L2(G) ⊂L1(G). The eigenspaces for U are thus
eigenspaces in L1(G) also and, since L2(G) is dense in L1(G), the sum of
these eigenspaces is also dense in L1(G). Moreover, if z is a central idempo-
tent projecting onto an eigenspace, then z ⋆L2(G) is dense in z ⋆L1(G) and
so, since the ﬁrst space is ﬁnite-dimensional, z ⋆L2(G) = z ⋆L1(G). It fol-
lows that z ⋆L1(G) is a ﬁnite-dimensional, two-sided ideal in L1(G) and that
z belongs to this ideal.
Theorem9.2.5 showsthat L1(G)issemisimple.Henceeachideal z ⋆L1(G) is
a semisimple, ﬁnite-dimensional algebra, and is therefore isomorphic to a direct
sum of full matrix algebras. It follows that z is a sum of minimal idempotents
which project onto the full matrix algebras. Let {zσ : σ ∈$} be the collection
of all the minimal central idempotents arising in this way and deﬁne Hσ to be
zσ ⋆L2(G).
□
The orthogonal decomposition of L2(G) may be further reﬁned as follows.
Let dσ be the integer such that the minimal ideal Hσ is isomorphic to the algebra
Mdσ of dσ × dσ matrices. Then zσ = dσ
j=1 e j, where e j are minimal (no longer
central) idempotents. Put Kσ = Hσ ⋆e1. Then Kσ is a dσ-dimensional Hilbert
space and U(Kσ) = Kσ. Denote the restriction of U to Kσ by U (σ). Then U (σ)
is an irreducible representation of G.

We may now see that every irreducible unitary representation of G is con-
tained as a direct summand in the regular representation.
Proposition 10.1.4
Let G be a compact group. Then every irreducible con-
tinuous unitary representation of G is equivalent to U (σ) for a unique σ ∈$.
Proof
Let V be an irreducible unitary representation of G on the Hilbert
space HV . Then RV (zσ)HV ̸= {0} for at least one σ ∈$ because other-
wise Theorem 10.1.3 would show that RV (L1(G))HV = {0}. On the other
hand, if RV (zσ)HV ̸= {0} for two distinct central idempotents, z1 and z2 say,
then HV = RV (z1)HV ⊕RV (zσ)HV would reduce the representation V . Hence

RV (zσ)HV ̸= {0} for exactly one σ ∈$. It is left as an exercise to show that V
is equivalent to U (σ).

10.2 Abelian groups
One of the basic theorems of topology is Urysohn’s lemma, which asserts that,
if C and D are disjoint closed subsets of a normal space X, then there is a
continuous real-valued function f on X such that 0 ≤f (x) ≤1 for all x ∈X,
f (x) = 0 for all x ∈C, and f (x) = 1 for all x ∈D. (See Rudin (1963, 2.12)
or Engelking (1977, Theorem 15.10)). The class of normal spaces includes
all locally compact Hausdorff spaces, and Urysohn’s lemma is the basis of
all partition of unity arguments. In particular, it implies that multiplication
operators on C0(X) are decomposable.
It was seen in Section 9.3 that, if G is abelian, then the Fourier (or Gelfand)
transform of f ∈L1(G) belongs to C0(), where  is the dual group. The
continuous functions whose existence is guaranteed by Urysohn’s lemma need
not belong to A(), the algebra of Fourier transforms, however. The next result
showsthatsuitablefunctionsforpartitionofunityargumentscanneverthelessbe
found inside A(). See Rudin (1962, Theorem 2.6.1) and Reiter and Stegeman
(2000, Proposition 2.1.5).
Lemma 10.2.1
Let G be a locally compact abelian group. Let K and U be
subsets of its dual group , with K compact, U open, and K ⊂U. Then there
is a function f ∈L1(G) such that:
0 ≤f (γ ) ≤1 (γ ∈); f (γ ) = 1 (γ ∈K);
and f (γ ) = 0 (γ ̸∈U) .
Proof Let V be a neighbourhood of e such that VK ⊂U (see Lemma 8.2.2).
Let W be another neighbourhood of e which is symmetric and has compact
closure such that W 2 ⊂V (see Lemma 8.2.1).
Deﬁne functions on , ξ = 1W/m(W) and η = 1WK. Then ξ and η belong
to L2() ∩L1(): 0 ≤ξ ⋆η(γ ) ≤1 for all γ ∈; ξ ⋆η(γ ) = 1 for all γ ∈K;
and ξ ⋆η(γ ) = 0 for all γ ̸∈U.
Let h and k be the inverse Fourier transforms of ξ and η, respectively. Then
h and k belong to L2(G), and so hk is in L1(G). Put f = hk. Then
f = 
hk = h ⋆k = ξ ⋆η .
Hence f has the desired values on K and U.
□

The norm of f in L1(G) is usually bigger than 1, but it has the following
bound:
∥f ∥1 ≤∥h∥2∥k∥2 = ∥ξ∥2∥η∥2 = (m(WK)/m(W))1/2 .
The lemma is sometimes stated as L1(G) has local units. One consequence
is that L1(G) is a regular Banach algebra; see Exercise 3.6.1.
Local units and regularity are important in the study of spectral synthesis.
The question of spectral synthesis is as follows. Let F be a family of functions
in L1(G), and let g be a function such that g(γ ) = 0 whenever f (γ ) = 0 for
every f ∈F. Can g be synthesized from F in the sense that it belongs to
the closed ideal generated by F? (Note that the stated condition is necessary
for g to belong to this ideal.) The ﬁrst result in this direction was the so-called
‘Tauberian theorem’ of Wiener (1932), who showed that, if f ∈L1(Rn) satisﬁes
f (γ ) ̸= 0 for every γ ∈Rn, then f generates L1(Rn). Proposition 3.3.2 in Part I
is a similar result which applies when G is discrete and abelian. The Banach
algebraic proof of this result was an early application of Banach algebra theory.
Wiener’s Tauberian theorem has been considerably strengthened by
V. A. Ditkin (Rudin 1972) For the statement of this theorem the deﬁnitions
of the hull of an ideal and the kernel of a set of maximal ideals must be recalled
from Exercise 3.6.1 in Part I.
Theorem 10.2.2 (Ditkin)
Let G be a locally compact abelian group, and let
I be a closed ideal in L1(G). Suppose that the boundary of h(I) contains no
perfect set. Then I = k(h(I)).
□
(A perfect set is an inﬁnite compact set having no isolated points.)
A closed subset X of L1(G) such that k(X) is the unique ideal with hull X is
said to be a set of synthesis. Wiener’s original theorem asserts that the empty set
is a set of synthesis, and Theorem 10.2.2 asserts that any set whose boundary
does not contain a perfect set is a set of synthesis. Every ﬁnite set is therefore
a set of synthesis and so we have the following consequence.
Corollary 10.2.3
Let G be a locally compact abelian group, and let I be a
closed ideal with inﬁnite codimension in L1(G). Then h(I) is inﬁnite.
□
Lemma 10.2.1 implies that, for every γ ∈, there is an f ∈L1(G) such that
f has compact support and f (γ ) ̸= 0. Hence the common zero set of the ideal
F = {f : f has compact support}
is empty. It follows by Wiener’s theorem that L1(G) is the closure of this ideal.

104
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
A function algebra such that the functions with compact support are a dense
subalgebra is sometimes called a Wiener algebra.
Proposition 10.2.4
Let G be a locally compact abelian group, and let u ∈
L1(G). Then the operator f →u ⋆f, L1(G) →L1(G), is decomposable.
Proof Let U1 and U2 be open subsets of C with C = U1 ∪U2. Without loss of
generality, it may be supposed that 0 ̸∈C \ U1. Thenu−1(C \ U1) is a compact
subset of G because u ∈C0(G) and u−1(U2) is an open set with
u−1(C \ U1) ⊂u−1(U2).
Choose g ∈L1(G) such that g(γ ) = 1 for every γ ∈u−1(C \ U1) and such
that g(γ ) = 0 for every γ ̸∈u−1(U2). Put X1 = ((δe −g) ⋆L1(G))−and then
set X2 = (g ⋆L1(G))−. Then L1(G) = X1 + X2, and the spectrum of Mu|X j
is contained in U j for each j.
□
10.3 The free group
In contrast with the algebras of compact and abelian groups, convolution in
ℓ1(F2) need not be decomposable. This will be shown by the following calcula-
tion, which is an improved exposition of an example taken from Willis (1986b).
Several further consequences will be deduced from this calculation in the next
chapter.
Proposition 10.3.1
Let F2 = ⟨a, b⟩be the free group on two generators, and
letta, tb ∈Csatisfy|ta| = 1 = |tb|.Thenthelinearoperator T onc0(F2)deﬁned
by
T ϕ(w) = ϕ(w) + taϕ(aw) + tbϕ(bw)
(ϕ ∈c0(F2))
(10.3.1)
is surjective. More precisely, for each ϕ ∈c0(F2), there exists ψ ∈c0(F2) with
∥ψ∥≤∥ϕ∥such that ϕ = T ψ.
The convolution operator (δe + taδa + tbδb)⋆on ℓ1(F2) is the dual of T .
Hence this operator satisﬁes
∥(δe + taδa + tbδb) ⋆f ∥1 ≥∥f ∥1
( f ∈ℓ1(F2))
and has closed range.
Proof It is more convenient to carry out the calculation for a related convolution
operator on a larger group. This group will be the free product of three copies
of the cyclic group of order 2, C2 ∗C2 ∗C2 = ⟨u0, u1, u2⟩. The subgroup of

10
Convolution operators
105
C2 ∗C2 ∗C2 generated by u0u1 and u0u2 is just the subgroup consisting of
all words of even length and has index 2. This subgroup is isomorphic to
F2 = ⟨a, b⟩, with the isomorphism determined by a →u0u1 and b →u0u2.
We identify F2 with the subgroup generated by u0u1 and u0u2, and so we see
that C2 ∗C2 ∗C2 is the union of cosets
C2 ∗C2 ∗C2 = F2 ∪u0F2 = {words of even length} ∪{words of odd length}.
Then c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2) is the direct sum c0(F2) ⊕c0(u0F2). Equation (10.3.1)
then deﬁnes an operator T on c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2), and c0(F2) and c0(u0F2) are
invariant under T . Hence it will sufﬁce to show that T is surjective on the space
c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2). Since T is the composite T = SR, where R is deﬁned by
Rϕ(w) = ϕ(u0w) + taϕ(u1w) + tbϕ(u2w)
(ϕ ∈c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2))
and Sϕ(w) = ϕ(u0w), and since S is clearly invertible, it will sufﬁce to show
that R is surjective. For ease of exposition we will suppose that ta = 1 = tb.
Let ϕ ∈c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2). We deﬁne ψ ∈c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2) with Rψ = ϕ by
deﬁning ψ(w) inductively on the length of w. Begin by setting ψ(e) = 0 and
ψ(w) = ϕ(e)/3 for w = u0, u1 or u2. Then Rψ(e) = ϕ(e).
Assume that ψ(w) has been deﬁned for all words w with |w| ≤n such
that Rψ(w) = ϕ(w) for all w with |w| ≤n −1. Let w have length n. Then
|uw| = n −1 for u equal to one of u0, u1, and u2, and |uw| = n + 1 for u
equal to the other two. Suppose, for instance, that |u0w| = n −1 and that
|u1w| = n + 1 = |u2w|. In this case, deﬁne ψ(u1w) = (ϕ(w) −ψ(u0w)) /2 =
ψ(u2w). Then
Rψ(w) = ψ(u0w) + ψ(u1w) + ψ(u2w) = ϕ(w) .
The other cases are treated similarly to deﬁne ψ on all words of length up to
n + 1 to achieve Rψ(w) = ϕ(w) for all w of length up to n. Continuing in this
way we construct ψ with Rψ = ϕ.
It remains to show that ψ ∈c0(C2 ∗C2 ∗C2). For this, deﬁne for each w the
sequence of words (w j)n
j=0, where n = |w|, by removing letters one at a time
from the left of w. Thus, for example, w0 = w, wn = e, and |w j| = n −j.
(If the Cayley graph of C2 ∗C2 ∗C2 = ⟨u0, u1, u2⟩is deﬁned so that w is
adjacent to u0w, u1w, and u2w, then (w j)n
j=0 is the sequence of words on the
path from w to e.) Then it may be shown by induction that

The identities (10.3.2) and (10.3.3) may be used to show that the operator
T is surjective on ℓp(F2) for every p > 2. By duality, (see Dunford Schwartz
1958, §VI.6), T is injective with closed range on ℓp(F2) for every p < 2. The
map T is injective and has dense range on ℓ2(F2).
Proposition 10.3.2
The operator T deﬁned in the previous proposition has
non-trivial kernel. Hence the operator f →(δe + taδa + tbδb) ⋆f is not sur-
jective on ℓ1(F2).
Proof It sufﬁces to show that (δe + taδa + tbδb)⋆is not surjective on ℓ1(F2) (see
Dunford and Schwartz 1958, VI.6). For this, note that, since F2 is a free group,
a →t−1
a e2πi/3, b →t−1
b e−2πi/3 determines a character on F2. Then the element
δe + taδa + tbδb belongs to the kernel of the corresponding representation of
ℓ1(F2), which is an ideal. Hence the range of convolution by this element is
contained in this proper ideal.
We have shown that T ′ is not surjective. It follows that T itself is not
injective.
□
It is not difﬁcult to show that a surjective operator which is not injective
does not have the single-valued extension property (SVEP). Hence T does not
have property (β) and T ′ does not have (δ). (For deﬁnitions, see 21.2.1 and
21.2.4)
Corollary 10.3.3
The operator on ℓ1(F2) deﬁned by
f →(δe + taδa + tbδb) ⋆f
is not decomposable.
□
A ∗-algebra is symmetric if the spectrum of a∗a is contained in R+ ∪{0} for
every a ∈A (Dales 2000, §1.10). A locally compact group is symmetric if the
∗-algebra L1(G) is symmetric. Abelian and compact groups are symmetric, but
there is no known characterization of symmetric groups. Free groups are not
symmetric however.

Proposition 10.3.4
F2 is not a symmetric group.

∥(δe + δa + δb)∗⋆(δe + δa + δb) ⋆f ∥1 ≥∥f ∥1
for every f ∈ℓ1(F2). It follows that the unit disc is contained in its spectrum,
and so ℓ1(F2) is not symmetric.

2. (An alternative proof that f →a ⋆f is compact.)
Let G be a compact group. We show that for every a ∈L1(G) the operator
f →a ⋆f is a compact operator on L p(G) for 1 < p < ∞and on C(G).
Since the set of compact operators is closed and since L1(G) ∩L∞(G) is
dense in L1(G), it may be supposed that a ∈L1(G) ∩L∞(G).
(i) Let f ∈L p(G). Show that a ⋆f ∈C(G) and ∥a ⋆f ∥∞≤∥a∥q∥f ∥p,
where q is the conjugate index to p.
(ii) By using the fact that the map x →δx ⋆a, G →Lq(G), is continuous,
show that {a ⋆f : f ∈L p(G), ∥f ∥p ≤1} is an equicontinuous and
bounded subset of C(G). Conclude (with the aid of the Arzel`a–Ascoli
theorem; see Dunford and Schwartz (1958, Theorem IV.6.7) that this
set is totally bounded.
(iii) Use the fact that the inclusion map C(G) →L p(G) is continuous to
deduce that {a ⋆f : f ∈L p(G), ∥f ∥p ≤1} has compact closure in
L p(G), and hence convolution by a is a compact operator.

10.5 Additional notes
1. Theorem 10.2.2 suggests that it is not easy to ﬁnd subsets of  = G which
are not sets of synthesis for L1(G). However it was shown by Schwartz
(1948) that the unit sphere in R3 is not a set of synthesis for L1(R3). This
fact is the starting point of the construction in Grønbaek and Willis (1997).
2. By way of contrast, Herz (1958) showed that the unit circle in R2 is a set of
synthesis for L1(R2). The question of synthesis is thus a very subtle one.
3. If G is compact, then  is discrete and so every set is a set of synthesis. If
G is not compact, then there is a set of non-synthesis in , as was shown by
Malliavin (1959). These ideas are presented very clearly in Rudin (1962).

Amenable groups
Many, but certainly not all, results about abelian groups and compact groups
have a common extension to the class of amenable groups. Some of these results
are discussed in this chapter and it is seen that amenability may be regarded as
a type of ﬁniteness condition.
11.1 Deﬁnition and examples
Most of the deﬁnitions and results in this chapter may be found in the refer-
ences (Hewitt and Ross 1979, §17; Greenleaf 1969; Reiter and Stegeman 2000,
Chapter 8; Paterson 1988; Pier 1984). The ﬁrst deﬁnition repeats 7.2.5.
Deﬁnition 11.1.1
The locally compact group G is amenable if there is a left-
invariant mean on L∞(G). Thus G is amenable if there is a linear functional
M on L∞(G) such that:
1. M(ϕ) ≥0 whenever ϕ ≥0;
2. M(1G) = 1; and
3. M(xϕ) = M(ϕ) for every ϕ ∈L∞(G) and x ∈G.
Properties 1 and 2 say that M is a mean, and Property 3 says that M is
invariant under left translation.
It may be shown that L∞(G) has a left-invariant mean if and only if it has
a right-invariant mean and that this is equivalent to L∞(G) having a two-sided
invariant mean. It is also equivalent to L∞(G) having topologically invariant
mean, that is, a mean M such that
M( f ⋆ϕ) =
	
G
f dm

M(ϕ)
( f ∈L1(G)) .
The mean property of M implies that it is continuous (with norm 1), but it is

in the deﬁnition.
Proposition 11.1.2
The locally compact group G is amenable if and only if
there is a non-zero, left-invariant functional (continuous or discontinuous) on
L∞(G).
□
Here are some basic examples of amenable groups and of non-amenable
groups.
Proposition 11.1.3
Compact groups and abelian groups are amenable.
Proof
The Haar integral is an invariant mean on L∞(G) when G is compact.
An indirect proof valid for abelian semigroups is given in Hewitt and Ross
(1979, Theorem 17.5). We give a more direct proof for the case where G is the
group of integers.
For each n ∈Z+, let m(n) ∈ℓ1(Z) be speciﬁed by
m(n) =
1
2n + 1
n

j=−n
δ j .
Then m(n) ≥0 and ∥m(n)∥1 = 1. Moreover, when n > k > 0, we have

and so ∥m(n)

−m(n)∥1 = 2k/(2n + 1)
n→0 for every k ∈Z. It follows that each
weak-∗accumulation point of (mn)∞
n=1 is an invariant mean on ℓ∞(Z).
□
Proposition 11.1.4
The free group on two generators is not amenable.
Proof
Let ω = e2πi. Then the operator T ′′ ∈B(ℓ∞(F2)) given by
T ′′ϕ(x) = ϕ(x) + ωϕ(ax) + ω2ϕ(bx)
(ϕ ∈ℓ∞(F2))
is the second dual of the operator considered in Proposition 10.3.1, and so is
surjective by that proposition and Dunford and Schwartz (1958, VI.6).
Let M be a translation invariant functional on ℓ∞(F2). Then, for every ele-
ment ϕ ∈ℓ∞(F2), we have ϕ = T ′′ψ for some ψ ∈ℓ∞(F2), and so
M(ϕ) = M(T ′′ψ) = M(ψ) + ωM(ψa) + ω2M(ψb).

11
Amenable groups
111
Since M is translation-invariant, it follows that
M(ϕ) = (1 + ω + ω2)M(ψ) = 0 .
Hence there are no non-zero translation-invariant functionals on ℓ∞(F2), and
F2 is not amenable.
□
Proofs of the following stability properties of amenability may be found in
Greenleaf (1969) and Paterson (1988).
Theorem 11.1.5
(i) Let G be a locally compact group, and let N be a closed normal subgroup
of G. Then G is amenable if and only if N and G/N are amenable.
(ii) Let G be an amenable group, and let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism
such that ϕ(G) = H. Then H is amenable.
(iii) Let G be an amenable group, and let H be a closed subgroup of G. Then
H is amenable.

The above theorem enlarges the classes of groups shown to be amenable in
Proposition 11.1.3.
Corollary 11.1.6
(i) Solvable groups are amenable.
(ii) Central groups are amenable.

Proposition 11.1.4 may also be combined with the theorem to show that many
groups are not amenable.

Non-compact, semisimple Lie groups are not amenable.

For a long time it was an open question, asked originally by von Neumann,
whether every non-amenable, group had a subgroup isomorphic to F2. This
question was answered Ol’shanski˘ı (1980), where a non-amenable group is
constructed which has no non-abelian, free subgroup because every one of its
proper subgroups is cyclic.

Corollary 11.1.9

ﬁnite subset generates a ﬁnite subgroup, are amenable.

Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
The class of groups containing abelian and compact groups and closed under
extensions, dense homomorphic images, subgroups, and direct limits is the
class of elementary amenable groups. For some time these were the only groups
which were known to be amenable. However amenable groups which are not
elementary were constructed by Grigorchuk (1984, 1988).
11.2 Alternative characterizations of amenability
The amenability condition has many equivalent characterizations which re-
ﬂect the wide range of applications of amenability. Many of these aspects of
amenability show it to be a ﬁniteness condition in some way.
Invariant means
By deﬁnition, G is amenable if and only if there is a left-
translation invariant mean on L∞(G). (The name was invented by M. M. Day
as a pun.) As already remarked, amenability is equivalent to the existence
of right-translation invariant, two-sided translation-invariant, and topologically
invariantmeanson L∞(G).Itisalsoequivalenttotheexistenceofaleft-invariant
mean on C(G), the space of bounded continuous functions on G and on the
space of right uniformly continuous functions on G; a function f ∈C(G) is
right uniformly continuous if, for each ε > 0, there exists a neighbourhood U
of e such that | f (x) −f (y)| < ε whenever x, y ∈G with xy−1 ∈U.
A characterizing property of compact groups is that their Haar measure is
ﬁnite, and in this case the Haar measure of the entire group is usually normal-
ized to equal 1. Integration against Haar measure is then an invariant mean
on spaces of bounded functions. If G is not compact, bounded functions can-
not be integrated generally (because L∞(G, m) ̸⊂L1(G, m)). The existence of
translation-invariant means on L∞(G, m) therefore extends some features of
compact (and in particular ﬁnite) groups to the class of amenable, locally com-
pact groups. Indeed, it will be seen that certain results for ﬁnite and compact
groups which use the Haar measure in their proof have analogues for amenable
groups.
Although the Haar measure is unique, invariant means are not. Rudin (1972)
showed that the compact abelian group T has invariant means other than Haar
measure because it has invariant means which are not topological invariant
means. The exact number of invariant means on a general locally compact
group is found in Chou (1976).
Paradoxical decompositions
A paradoxical decomposition of the group G
consists of a ﬁnite partition G = A1 ∪· · · ∪Ak ∪B1 · · · ∪Bl into measurable

11
Amenable groups
113
subsets and elements x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yl such that G = x1A1 ∪· · · ∪xk Ak
and G = y1B1 ∪· · · ∪yl Bl are also partitions.
It was shown by Tarski (1938) that G is amenable if and only if it does not
have a paradoxical decomposition. Non-amenability of G thus says that G is
inﬁnite in a strong sense closely related to the algebraic structure: there is a
two-to-one map from G to itself which is a piecewise translation.
Amenability ﬁrst appeared in connection with paradoxical decompositions.
TheBanach–Tarskiparadoxshowsthatthespherecanbepartitionedintoﬁnitely
many sets which may be rotated and reassembled to form two copies of the
original sphere. It follows that there is no ﬁnitely additive measure on the fam-
ily of all subsets of the sphere which extends the familiar area measure on
Borel sets. This is in contrast to the circle T or the line R or the plane
R2, where the familiar Lebesgue measure can be extended to a translation-
invariant, ﬁnitely additive measure on all subsets. It was observed by von
Neumann (1929) that the paradoxical decomposition of the sphere arises from
a paradoxical decomposition of a free subgroup of the rotation group of the
sphere. The symmetry groups of the line, plane and circle do not contain free
subgroups.
The Følner condition
This condition says, roughly speaking, that amenable
groups have compact subsets almost invariant under translations. For example,
if G is compact, then the group itself is invariant under translation. For a second
example, the proof in Proposition 11.1.3 that Z is amenable uses the fact that,
for each n ∈N, the subset
K = {−n, −n + 1, . . . , n −1, n}
is almost invariant in a sense which we now make precise.
Deﬁnition 11.2.1
The locally compact group G satisﬁes Følner’s condition
if, for every ε > 0 and every compact subset C of G, there is a compact subset
K of G such that
m ((x K \ K) ∪(K \ xK)) /m(K) < ε
(x ∈C) .
The locally compact group G is amenable if and only if it satisﬁes Følner’s
condition.
Almost invariant probabilities
Closely related to Følner’s condition are sev-
eral formulations of almost invariance for probability measures on G. Denote
the set of non-negative, norm 1 functions in L1(G) by P(G). These are the

114
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
probability measures on G which are absolutely continuous with respect to
Haar measure.
Proposition 11.2.2
The locally compact group G is amenable if it satisﬁes
any one of the following three equivalent conditions.
1. There is a net { fλ} in P(G) such that {x fλ −fλ} converges weakly to 0 for
every x ∈G.
2. There is a net { fλ} in P(G) such that {∥x fλ −fλ∥1} converges to 0 for every
x ∈G.
3. There is a net { fλ} in P(G) such that {∥g ⋆fλ −fλ∥1} converges to 0 for
every g ∈P(G).
□
The proof that the ﬁrst condition implies the second, due to M. M. Day,
requires the functional-analytic fact (derived from the Hahn–Banach theorem)
that the weak and strong closures of a convex subset of a Banach space are the
same. The argument does not show that weak convergence of {x fλ −fλ} to 0
implies norm convergence. It in fact is shown in Rosenblatt and Willis (2001)
that there is a net with {x fλ −fλ} weakly convergent but not norm convergent.
This paper introduces the notion of conﬁguration sets, which could be useful
for further work on amenable groups.
The properties in Proposition 11.2.2 are very close to the p = 1 case of the
following condition introduced by H. Reiter.
Deﬁnition 11.2.3 (Property Pp)
Let 1 ≤p < ∞. The locally compact group
G satisﬁes Property Pp if, for every ε > 0 and every compact subset C of G,
there exists f ∈L p(G) such that f ≥0, ∥p∥p = 1, and
∥x f −f ∥p < ε
(x ∈C) .
Proposition 11.2.4 (Reiter and Stegeman 2000, Theorem 8.3.2)
The condi-
tions Pp for 1 ≤p < ∞are all equivalent, and the group G is amenable if it
satisﬁes any one of these conditions.
□
Unitary representations
Reiter’s condition P2 implies that there is a net
{ fλ} of norm 1 elements in L2(G) such that ∥x fλ −fλ∥2
λ→0. In other words,
∥Ux( fλ) −fλ∥2
λ→0, where U is the left regular representation of G on L2(G).
The trivial representation of G is the one-dimensional representation deﬁned
by Vx = 1 (x ∈G). Condition P2 therefore says that functions in the regular
representation approximate the trivial representation of G. That is the ﬁrst
statement of the next characterization of amenability.

11
Amenable groups
115
Proposition 11.2.5
Let G be a locally compact group. Then the following
conditions are each equivalent to G being amenable.
1. The trivial representation of G is weakly contained in the regular represen-
tation.
2. Every unitary representation of G is weakly contained in the regular repre-
sentation.
3. C∗
r (G) = C∗(G).
4. For every probability measure in M(G) (or in Ma(G) or Md(G)), the norm
of the operator f →µ ⋆f, L2(G) →L2(G), is equal to 1.
□
The facts, proved in Chapters 9 and 10, that C∗
r (G) = C∗(G) when G is
abelian or compact may now be seen to be consequences of the amenability of
abelian groups and compact groups, respectively. Alternatively, they might be
viewed as proofs that these groups are amenable.
The unitary representation theory of ﬁnite groups shows that, if G is ﬁnite,
then CG is isomorphic to a direct sum of full matrix algebras and that every
irreducible unitary representation of G is equivalent to a direct summand of the
regular representation. In Theorem 10.1.3 the same was seen to hold for compact
groups. Condition 2 of the above proposition extends this to amenable groups.
It is no longer the case that every irreducible unitary representation is a direct
summand in the regular representation; it is only weakly contained in it. Weak
containment of an irreducible representation V in the regular representation U
means that, for every ξ and η in HV , there are bounded nets { fλ} and {gλ} in
L2(G) such that the ‘matrix coefﬁcient’ x →⟨Vxξ, η⟩is approximated in the
sense that
⟨Vxξ, η⟩= lim
λ ⟨Ux fλ, gλ⟩,
where the limit is uniform on compact subsets of G. Amenable groups are
precisely those for which we have this weak version of a theorem about ﬁnite
groups. Amenability thus appears once again as a ﬁniteness condition.
An immediate consequence of Condition 4 in Proposition 11.2.5 is that, if G
is not amenable, there are x1, . . . , xn in G and positive numbers c1, . . . , cn with
n
j=1 c j = 1 such that | n
j=1(c jδx j⋆)|L2(G) < 1. (J. Dieudonn´e (1960) made a
direct calculation in the case of F2 and showed that |δe + δa + δb|l2(G) =
√
8.)
It is an exercise to deduce the following result from this fact.
Corollary 11.2.6
Let G be a non-amenable group. Then there is no non-zero,
translation-invariant functional on L2(G).

The ﬁxed point property
This property means that every continuous and
afﬁne action of G on a compact, convex subset C of a locally convex topological
linear space has a ﬁxed point. The next characterization was shown by Day and
by Rickert (1967).
Proposition 11.2.7
The locally compact group G is amenable if and only if
it has the ﬁxed point property.
□
Cohomology of L1(G)
One of the last formulations of amenability to be
obtained concerns the cohomology of L1(G). Some deﬁnitions are required in
order to state it.
Deﬁnition 11.2.8
Let A be a Banach algebra.
(i) A Banach A-bimodule is a Banach space X together with left and right
actions (a, x) →a · x and (a, x) →x · a which are bilinear maps sat-
isfying the associative laws
(ab) · x = a · (b · x), (a · x) · b = a · (x · b)
and x · (ab) = (x · a) · b
(a, b ∈A, x ∈X) .
These maps must also satisfy the bound condition
∥a · x∥X ≤∥a∥A∥x∥X and ∥x · a∥X ≤∥a∥A∥x∥X
(a ∈A, x ∈X) .
(ii) A derivation from A to a bimodule X is a linear map D : A →X satisfying
the Leibniz rule
D(ab) = a · D(b) + D(a) · b
(a, b ∈A) .
(iii) Let x be in X. The map Dx : A →X is an inner deriviation if
D(a) = a · x −x · a
(a ∈A) .
(iv) The set of continuous derivations is a linear subspace of B(A, X), de-
noted by Z1(A, X). The set of inner derivations is a subspace of Z(A, X),
denoted by N 1(A, X). The quotient space
H1(A, X) := Z1(A, X)/N 1(A, X)
is the ﬁrst continuous cohomology group of A with coefﬁcients in X.

11
Amenable groups
117
The ﬁrst and higher cohomology groups of Banach algebras are discussed
in Part I, §6.2. For further information, see Dales (2000) and Helemskii
(1989).
The dual module of a Banach A-module is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.1.5. The
dual actions of A on X′ are deﬁned so that the linear operator x′ →x′ · a is
the dual of the operator x →a · x and x′ →a · x′ is the dual of the operator
x →x · a. As part of his work on derivations on L1(G), B. E. Johnson proved
the following theorem; it gave rise to the deﬁnition of an amenable Banach
algebra. See Part I and also Johnson (1972, Theorem 2.5) or Dales (2000,
Theorem 5.6.2).
Theorem 11.2.9
Let G be a locally compact group. Then G is amenable if
and only if H1(L1(G), X′) = {0} for every Banach L1(G)-bimodule X.
□
In particular, since M(G) with the convolution action is the dual
L1(G)-bimodule of C0(G) with appropriately deﬁned actions, we have that
H1(L1(G), M(G)) = {0}.
Corollary 11.2.10
Let G be an amenable group, and let D : L1(G) →L1(G)
be a continuous derivation. Then there exists µ ∈M(G) such that
D( f ) = f ⋆µ −µ ⋆f
( f ∈L1(G)) .
□
A proof of Theorem 11.2.9 in the case where G is discrete was presented
in Chapter 7. That this theorem of Johnson’s is yet another manifestation of
amenability as a ﬁniteness condition can be seen by comparing it with a the-
orem from purely algebraic cohomology theory. For each algebra A and A-
bimodule X, the algebraic cohomology group H 1(A, X) is deﬁned just as in
Deﬁnition 11.2.8 except that there is no norm; see 7.1.2. Then it may be shown
that the algebra A satisﬁes H 1(A, X) = {0} for every A-bimodule X if and
only if A is ﬁnite-dimensional and semisimple; see 7.2.1. It is conjectured that
the same holds for Banach algebras and Banach bimodules but all proofs of
special cases assume that spaces concerned have the approximation property
or compact approximation property at some point, (see Taylor 1972; Selivanov
1976; Runde 1998). Vanishing of all cohomology groups of A with values in
dual A-bimodules is thus a weak version of a condition which, in the purely
algebraic case at least, implies the ﬁnite-dimensionality of A.

11.3 Approximate identities in ideals
Amenability of G is also equivalent to the existence of (bounded) approximate
identities in certain ideals of L1(G). The ﬁrst result is due to H. Reiter 1968.
For this, note that the codimension 1 subspace
L1
0(G) :=

f ∈L1(G) :

G
f dm = 0

is a closed ideal in L1(G). It is the kernel of the representation of L1(G) in-
duced by the trivial representation of G; see equation (7.2.1). It is called the
augmentation ideal.
Proposition 11.3.1
The locally compact group G is amenable if and only if
L1
0(G) has a left bounded approximate identity.
For a full proof, see Dales (2000, Theorem 5.6.42). See the exercises for a
direct proof that ℓ1
0 (F2) does not have an approximate identity. It had previously
been shown by W. Rudin that, when G is compact, all ideals in L1(G) have
bounded approximate identities. This was extended to the class of amenable
groups by Liu, van Rooij, and Wang (1973).
Proposition 11.3.2
Let G be an amenable group, and let I be a closed right
ideal in L1(G). Then I has a left bounded approximate identity if and only if it
is weakly complemented in L1(G).
(A subspace Y of a Banach space X is weakly complemented if the annihilator
of Y, which is deﬁned by Y ⊥:= {x′ ∈X′ : ⟨y, x′⟩= 0 (y ∈Y)}, has a Banach
space complement in X′.) It is not difﬁcult to see that any ideal which has a
bounded approximate identity must be weakly complemented. Amenability is
essential for the ‘if’ direction of the proposition. In fact, the result is proved in
Liu, van Rooij, and Wang (1973) for complemented ideals only. The stronger
version for weakly complemented ideals may be proved with the aid of the
cohomological property shown in Theorem 11.2.9; for this, see Curtis and Loy
(1989) and Dales (2000, Theorem 2.9.58).
The previous proposition applies in particular to ideals with ﬁnite codimen-
sion in L1(G) because such ideals are complemented. The ‘if’ direction of
Reiter’s theorem extends to these ideals (Willis 1982).
Proposition 11.3.3
Suppose that some closed right ideal of ﬁnite codimension
in L1(G) has a left bounded approximate identity. Then G is amenable.
□

11
Amenable groups
119
These results on approximate identities are related to another characteriza-
tion of amenability in terms of random walks. Each probability measure on
G determines a random walk on G; see for example Ka˘ımanovi˘c and Ver˘sik
(1983). An important tool in the study of a random walk is its boundary. The
boundary is a measurable G-space imagined as consisting of points ‘at inﬁnity’
which the walker approaches as times proceeds.
It is not directly relevant to make this precise here. For the purposes of this
chapter, we describe the boundary of the random walk corresponding to the
probability measure µ in Banach algebraic terms as follows. First, deﬁne
µJ := { f −µ ⋆f : f ∈L1(G)} .
Then µJ is a closed right ideal in L1(G) and has a left bounded approximate
identity consisting of functions of the form

⋆uE ,
where uE is a function as deﬁned in Proposition 9.1.8. It may be shown that
the quotient Banach space L1(G)/µJ is isometrically isomorphic to L1(
, ν),
where 
 is the boundary of the random walk; see Willis (1990, Theorem 2.1).
A random walk where the boundary consists of a single point is said to
be ergodic. It is clear that this occurs if and only if µJ has codimension 1 in
L1(G). Since µJ ⊂L1
0(G), it follows that the random walk is ergodic if and only
if µJ = L1
0(G). As shown in the exercises, µJ has a left bounded approximate
identity. Hence, by Proposition 11.3.1, if G supports an ergodic random walk,
then G isamenable.TheconversewasconjecturedbyH.Furstenbergandproved
independently by Rosenblatt (1981) and by Ka˘ımanoviˇc and Verˇsik (1983); also
see Willis (1990).
Theorem 11.3.4
The σ-compact locally compact group G is amenable if and
only if there is a probability measure µ on G such that L1
0(G) = µJ.

however. Theorem 8.3.4 is a universal statement applying to every probability

measure µ having large enough support, but Theorem 11.3.4 is an existential
statement and µ is quite difﬁcult to construct. A probability measure on an
amenable group need not be ergodic even if its support equals G; some exam-
ples illustrating how subtle the boundary of a random walk can be are given in
Ka˘ımanoviˇc (1983).

Harmonic analysis and automatic continuity
Knowledge of the structure of L1(G) can be used to show that derivations from
L1(G) are automatically continuous when G is abelian, compact, or is in one
of several other classes. However it is not known whether such derivations are
continuous for every locally compact group G. Work on this problem leads to
further questions in abstract harmonic analysis.
12.1 Automatic continuity of derivations
It was shown by Ringrose (1972) that every derivation from a C*-algebra A is
automatically continuous. Powerful general techniques for proving automatic
continuity results have been developed from this and earlier work; see Part I
and the substantial account in Dales (2000). The following general method for
proving automatic continuity of derivations was given by Jewell (1977).
Theorem 12.1.1
Let A be a Banach algebra such that:
1. every closed two-sided ideal with ﬁnite codimension in A has a bounded
approximate identity; and
2. if I is a closed two-sided ideal with inﬁnite codimension in A, then there are
sequences (an) and (bn) in A such that bna1· · · an−1 ̸∈I, but bna1· · · an ∈I
for each n ≥2.
Then every derivation D : A →X, where X is a Banach A-bimodule, is con-
tinuous.
□
Condition 2 of the theorem is used to show that the continuity ideal (see
Part I and Exercise 12.4.1) of any derivation D : A →X cannot have inﬁnite
codimension. A variant of the Main Boundedness Theorem of Bade and Curtis
121

122
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
(see Theorem 5.2.2) is used to show this. The existence of a bounded approx-
imate identity for the continuity ideal implies, via an application of Cohen’s
factorization theorem, that the restriction of D to its continuity ideal is contin-
uous. Since the continuity ideal has ﬁnite codimension, it follows that D must
be continuous.
Theorem 12.1.1 applies to all C*-algebras A. The ﬁrst condition is satisﬁed
because every ideal in a C*-algebra has a bounded approximate identity. To
verify the second condition, it is ﬁrst observed that, if A/I has an inﬁnite-
dimensional commutative *-subalgebra C, then its character space C (see
Deﬁnition 3.1.1) is inﬁnite, and C may be assumed to be C0(C). Then an inﬁ-
nite sequence of pairwise disjoint subsets of C may be chosen and Urysohn’s
lemma used to write down a sequence of non-zero functions ( fn) such that
fm fn = 0 whenever m ̸= n. These functions show that the second condition is
satisﬁed (exercise). If every ∗-subalgebra of A/I is ﬁnite-dimensional, then a
separate (and elementary) argument shows that A/I is itself ﬁnite-dimensional.
(For details, see Dales (2000, Corollary 5.3.7).) No such elementary argument
shows that the conditions of Theorem 12.1.1 are satisﬁed by L1(G) for general
locally compact groups G. However, they can be shown for certain classes of
groups, and Condition 1 can be replaced by a weaker hypothesis.
12.2 Finite-codimensional ideals in L1(G)
As we have already seen in Propositions 11.3.2 and 11.3.3, ideals with ﬁnite
codimension in L1(G) have a bounded approximate identity if and only if
G is amenable. Hence Theorem 12.1.1 can only apply to amenable groups
at best. However, Condition 1 of the theorem can be weakened. The bounded
approximate identity is needed only so that Cohen’s factorization theorem 9.1.9
may be applied. The requisite factoring can be achieved in ﬁnite-codimensional
ideals of general group algebras with the aid of the following result, which is
proved in Willis (2001).
Proposition 12.2.1
Let G be a σ-compact, locally compact group, and let I
be a closed two-sided ideal with ﬁnite codimension in L1(G).
(i) There is a closed left ideal L ⊂I having a right bounded approximate
identity, and a closed right ideal R ⊂I having a left bounded approximate
identity, such that
I = R + L .
(12.2.1)

12
Harmonic analysis and automatic continuity
123
(ii) For every sequence ( fn) in I with ∥fn∥1
n→0, there are elements a and b
and sequences (hn) and (kn) converging to 0 in I with
fn = hn ⋆a + b ⋆kn
(n ∈N) .
(12.2.2)
□
The factoring of null sequences described in Equation (12.2.2) is just what is
needed to complete the automatic continuity argument behind Theorem 12.1.1.
It is not possible to give the details of the proof of Proposition 12.2.1 here, but
we will compare the construction of the ideals R and L with the construction of
the approximate identities in Proposition 11.3.2 in the cases where G is ﬁnite,
where G is compact, and where G is amenable. It will be clearer to begin with
the case where I = L1
0(G).
When G is a ﬁnite group, the element δe −mG is an identity for the ideal
L1
0(G). When G is compact but not ﬁnite, this ideal has a bounded approximate
identity of the form
{uλ ⋆(δe −mG)} ,
(12.2.3)
where {uλ} is a bounded approximate identity for L1(G); see Proposition 9.1.8.
If G is not compact, the Haar measure mG is not bounded and (12.2.3) does not
make sense, but when G is amenable mG can be replaced by a net of probability
measures { fν} as in Proposition 11.2.2(3) or, when G is also σ-compact, by
convolution powers of a single probability measure as in Proposition 11.3.4.
Then L1(G) has a bounded approximate identity of the form
{uλ ⋆(δe −fν)}(λ,ν)

(12.2.4)
Random walks, that is, convolution powers of a single probability measure,
can also be used in the case where G is not amenable. Deﬁne
µJ := { f −µ ⋆f : f ∈L1(G)}
and
Jµ := { f −f ⋆µ : f ∈L1(G)} .
Then, as seen in the last chapter, µJ is a closed right ideal with a left bounded
approximate identity, and it may be seen in the same way that Jµ is a closed
left ideal with a right bounded approximate identity. These are the ideals R and
L in (12.2.1) when I = L1
0(G).
Proposition 12.2.2 (Willis 1990)
Let G be a σ-compact group, and let µ be a
probability measure on G which is absolutely continuous with respect to Haar

measure and with support equal to G. (The σ-compactness of G is required
only so that such a probability measure exists.) Then
L1
0(G) =µJ + Jµ .
□
Note that the assertion holds for any probability measure satisfying the hy-
pothesis; the probability measure is not specially constructed. (This hypothesis
can be weakened a little.) The proposition is in this way closer to the Kawada–
Itˆo theorem than to Proposition 11.3.4. It has also been long known that, if
G is abelian and the support of the probability measure µ generates G, then
Jµ = L1
0(G). This is known as the Choquet–Deny theorem (Choquet and Deny
1961). Proposition 12.2.2 might therefore be regarded as a common general-
ization of the Kawada–Itˆo and Choquet–Deny theorems. The proof represents
the quotient L1(G)/Jµ as L1(
) (where 
 is the boundary of the random walk
with law µ), and applies the ergodic theorem to a certain operator on this
space. A proof in more probabilistic terms has also been given by Ka˘ımanoviˇc
(1992).
Now we see how R and L are deﬁned when I is any ﬁnite-codimensional
ideal. The quotient space L1(G)/I is ﬁnite-dimensional and the regular rep-
resentation of G on L1(G) induces a representation V of G by isometries on
this quotient space. The closure of V (G) in B(L1(G)/I) is a compact group,
K say, and harmonic analysis on K plays an important part. The representation
V factors through K as V = V ◦ϕ, where ϕ : G →K is a group homomor-
phism and V is a representation of K. Then V is the direct sum of irreducible
ﬁnite-dimensional representations and there are corresponding minimal central
idempotents z1, . . . , zn in L1(K). When G is ﬁnite or compact, I has a bounded
approximate identity of the form

where {uλ} is a bounded approximate identity for L1(G). Compare this approx-

0(G), V is the trivial rep-
resentation and {z1, . . . , zn} = {mG}. When G is not compact but is amenable,
the functions z j do not belong to L1(G), but there are nets {z jν} of functions in
L1(G) such that I has a bounded approximate identity

Harmonic analysis and automatic continuity
125
Compare this with (12.2.4). The general case also relies on choices of nets of
functions in L1(G) to modify the bounded approximate identities of µJ and Jµ.
This is fairly delicate however, and much of the work in Willis (2001) involves
making these choices. The closed ideals R and L are then deﬁned to be the ideals
for which these nets are the respective left and right approximate identities.
Proposition 12.2.1 implies that all derivations from L1(G) are continuous
whenever Condition 2 of Theorem 12.1.1 is satisﬁed.
12.3 Inﬁnite-codimensional ideals in L1(G)
In this section we shall see that Condition 2 of Theorem 12.1.1 is satisﬁed
by L1(G) when G is abelian or compact. We shall also see that, when G is
connected, a similar condition is satisﬁed by M(G). This condition sufﬁces to
show that derivations are continuous.
Abelian groups
Suppose ﬁrst of all that G is an abelian group with dual group
, and let I be a closed ideal with inﬁnite codimension in L1(G). Recall from
Exercise 3.6.1 that the hull of I is
h(I) = {γ ∈ : f (γ ) = 0 ( f ∈I)} .
Then, by Corollary 10.2.3, h(I) is inﬁnite. Since  is Hausdorff, there is a
sequence (γn) of disjoint points in h(I) and pairwise disjoint open sets (Un) with
γn ∈Un for each n ∈N. Lemma 10.2.1 assures us that we can choose functions
fn ∈L1(G) such that, for each n ∈N, we have f n(γn) = 1 and f n(γ ) = 0 for
γ ̸∈Un. These functions then satisfy the following for each m and n in N:
f 2
n ̸∈I because f 2
n (γn) = 1, and fm fn = 0 whenever m ̸= n. It follows that
L1(G) satisﬁes Condition 2 of Theorem 12.1.1 when G is abelian.
Compact groups
Suppose next that G is compact, and let I be a closed
ideal with inﬁnite codimension in L1(G). Then inﬁnitely many of the central
idempotents zσ identiﬁed in Theorem 10.1.3 do not belong to I. Since they
are minimal central idempotents, zσ zτ = zσ if τ = σ and zσ zτ = 0 if τ ̸= σ.
These idempotents show that L1(G) satisﬁes Condition 2 of Theorem 12.1.1
when G is compact.
Connected groups
Finally, suppose that G is connected, and let I be a closed
ideal with inﬁnite codimension in L1(G). We aim to show that I cannot be the
continuity ideal of a derivation. Theorem 8.2.4 tells us that G can be approx-
imated by Lie groups and, after some argument, it may be supposed that G is

126
Part II

in fact a connected Lie group. Then G has many 1-parameter subgroups and
these are, in particular, abelian.
Let H be a closed abelian subgroup of G. Then M(H) is isomorphic to a
subalgebra of M(G), and L1(H) acts as multipliers on L1(G) via
f ⋆g(x) =

H
f (y)g(y−1x) dm H(y)
(a.e.x ∈G, f ∈L1(H), g ∈L1(G)) .
Deﬁne
IH := { f ∈L1(H) : f ⋆g ∈I (g ∈L1(G))} .
Then IH is a closed ideal in L1(H).
Since G is a Lie group, it has abelian subgroups H1, . . . , Hr and a com-
pact connected subgroup K such that G = H1 · · · Hr K; see Iwasawa (1949,
Theorem 8). Since K is a Lie group, it has 1-parameter subgroups, say
L1, . . . , Ls, such that L1 · · · Ls contains a neighbourhood O of e. Since K is
compact and connected, On = K for some n ∈N, and so it may in fact be sup-
posed that there are closed abelian groups H1, . . . , Ht such that G = H1 · · · Ht.
(Ifsome Hj isnotclosed,replaceitwithitsclosure.Theclosureisstillanabelian
group.) If IHj had ﬁnite codimension in L1(Hj) for every j ∈{1, . . . , t}, then
it would follow that I had ﬁnite codimension in L1(G) (see Willis 1992) in
contradiction to our hypothesis. Hence IH has inﬁnite codimension in L1(H)
for some closed abelian subgroup H.
Choose a closed abelian subgroup H so that IH has inﬁnite codimension in
L1(H). Then there are sequences of functions (an) and (bn) in L1(H) satisfying:
2′: (bna1 . . . an−1) ⋆L1(G) ̸⊂I, but (bna1 . . . an) ⋆L1(G) ⊂I for n ≥2.
These sequences may then be used, exactly as Condition 2 is used, to show that
I cannot be the continuity ideal of a derivation.
The above comments show that the continuity ideal of a derivation D from
L1(G) has ﬁnite codimension in L1(G) when G is abelian, compact, or con-
nected. Proposition 12.2.1 may then be used to show that the restriction of D
to its continuity ideal is continuous; see Exercise 12.4.3. Hence we have shown
the following result.
Proposition 12.3.1
Let G be a locally compact group which is either abelian,
compact or connected, and let X be a Banach L1(G)-bimodule. Then every
derivation D : L1(G) →X is continuous.
□
It can also be shown that all derivations are continuous for solvable and for
locally ﬁnite groups and for groups satisfying certain ﬁniteness conditions, such
as [FD]−-groups. Proofs of some of these cases can be found in Dales (2000) and

12

Willis (1986a, 1992). Moreover, it can be shown that, if there is a discontinuous
derivation from L1(G) for some locally compact group G, then there is one
where G is discrete. Since every discrete group is the quotient of a free group,
there would then be a discontinuous derivation from a free-group algebra.
Proposition 12.3.2
Assume that there is a locally compact group G with
a discontinuous derivation D : L1(G) →X. Then there is a discontinuous
derivation
D : ℓ1(F∞) →ℓ∞(F∞× F∞) .
□
A partial proof of this reduction is given in Willis (1986).
Apparent progress can be made towards a proof that all derivations from
ℓ1(F∞) are continuous. Free groups have many inﬁnite abelian subgroups be-
cause every non-identity element generates a subgroup isomorphic to Z. The
sameargumentasusedaboveforabeliangroupsshowsthat,if D : ℓ1(F∞) →X
is a derivation, then I(D) ∩ℓ1(H) has ﬁnite codimension in ℓ1(H) for every
such abelian subgroup H. The continuity ideal is therefore very large, but it
does not follow that it has ﬁnite codimension in ℓ1(F∞). This apparent progress
is misleading because there are groups for which our knowledge of automatic
continuity techniques and of the group algebra are not adequate to show that
the continuity ideal is non-zero.
W. Burnside asked in 1902 whether every ﬁnitely generated group in which
every element satisﬁes xn = e for some ﬁxed n ∈N must be ﬁnite. A negative
solution was announced by P. S. Novikov in 1959 and a proof was published,
for odd n ≥4381, by Novikov and S. I. Adian in 1968. Adian subsequently
improved the value of the exponent n, and established more results about the
counter-examples; see Adian (1979). Let B(m, n) denote the free periodic group
with m generators for which xn = e for every x in the group. Adian showed
that B(m, n) is inﬁnite when m ≥2 and n ≥665 is odd. Furthermore, every
abelian subgroup of B(m, n) is cyclic of ﬁnite order (Adian 1979). Hence the
group algebra of each abelian subgroup is ﬁnite-dimensional, and automatic
continuity techniques give no information about the continuity ideal.
The following problem is a weaker, functional-analytic version of Burnside’s
original question.
Problem 12.3.3
(i) Let f ∈ℓ1(B(m, n)). Is the spectrum of f always totally
disconnected?
(ii) Let I be an ideal in ℓ1(F∞) such that ℓ1(H) ∩I has ﬁnite codimension
in ℓ1(H) for every abelian subgroup H of F∞. Is the spectrum of f + I totally
disconnected for every f ∈ℓ1(G)?

128
Part II
Analysis and amenability, George Willis
A positive answer, or at least a positive answer for sufﬁciently many f , would
show that the continuity ideal of a derivation has ﬁnite codimension in ℓ1(G),
and hence that every derivation from a group algebra is continuous.
12.4 Exercises
1. Let D : A →X be a derivation, and let
I(D) := { f ∈A : f · S(D) = {0}}
be its continuity ideal. Show that I(D) is a closed two-sided ideal in A.
2. Let A be a Banach algebra, and suppose there are elements fn in A with
fm fn = 0 if m ̸= n and f 2
n ̸= 0 whenever m, n ∈N. Construct sequences of
elements (an) and (bn) in A such that bna1 · · · an−1 ̸= 0, but bna1 · · · an = 0
for n ≥2.
3. Let D : A →X be a derivation, and let I(D) be its continuity ideal. Show
that, if I(D) has a bounded approximate identity, then the restriction of D
to I(D) is continuous.
12.5 Additional notes
1. It is easy to see that, if X is an A-bimodule, then A ⊕X is a Banach algebra
under the product deﬁned by
(a, x)(b, y) = (ab, a · y + x · b)
(a, b ∈A, x, y ∈X) ,
andthat,if D : A →X isaderivation,thenthemap : A →A ⊕X deﬁned
by (a) = (a, D(a)) is a homomorphism. If D is discontinuous, so is .
Hence techniques for showing that homomorphisms from an algebra are
continuous can be expected to apply to derivations too.
V. Runde has studied extensively the question of automatic continuity
of homomorphisms from group algebras. He has shown that, if G is an
[FIA]−-group which for some integer n has an inﬁnite number of inequiv-
alent n-dimensional unitary representations, then (assuming the continuum
hypothesis) there is a discontinuous homomorphism from L1(G) (Runde
1994). Abelian groups fall into this class, and so there are indeed discon-
tinuous homomorphisms from some group algebras. Runde conjectures that
the existence of inﬁnitely many inequivalent irreducible representations of
G is both a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for there to be discontinuous
homomorphisms from L1(G).

Thischangestheemphasisofworkonthehomomorphismsquestionsome-
what. Runde has shown that there are groups for which all homomorphisms
are continuous, and has examined whether discontinuous homomorphisms
from L1(G) correspond to discontinuous homomorphisms from its centre;
see Runde (1994, 1996, 1997).
2. The question of the automatic continuity of derivations is a particular case
of the question of comparison of the continuous and algebraic cohomology
theories of Banach algebras. Let A be a Banach algebra, and let M be a
Banach A-bimodule. Let H q(A, M) denote the algebraic cohomology group
and Hq(A, M) the continuous group. Then there is a natural comparison
map,
iq : Hq(A, M) →H q(A, M) .
When q = 1, this map is injective, and automatic continuity of derivations
says that i1 is surjective as well.
M. Wodzicki (1991) has examined the comparison map for higher values
of q. He ﬁnds that iq = 0 for every Banach bimodule M provided that A
is an amenable Banach algebra and q ≥n + 3, where the cardinality of A
is equal to ℵn. Thus there often is no relation between the continuous and
algebraic cohomologies for large values of q, in sharp contrast to the case
where q = 1 when the two cohomology groups are often isomorphic to each
other.

Compact operators
13.1
Let T : V →V be a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional, complex linear
space V . Then T possesses eigenvalues. This means that there is at least one
complex number λ such that ker(λ −T ) ̸= {0}. Since the latter space is invariant
under any linear operator A : V →V commuting with T , it follows that either
T = λI orthereisanon-triviallinearsubspaceof V invariantunderanyoperator
in the commutant of T . Here a linear subspace M of V is called non-trivial if
M ̸= {0} and M ̸= V .
A famous question in operator theory, the invariant subspace problem, asks if,
more generally, for each continuous linear operator T on an inﬁnite-dimensional
complex, separable Banach space (or Hilbert space) X there is a non-trivial,
closed linear subspace of X that is invariant under T . This question has guided
a considerable amount of research in operator theory. In the beginning of the
1980s ﬁrst counter-examples were given by C. J. Read and P. Enﬂo in the case
of operators on certain non-reﬂexive Banach spaces. In the Hilbert-space case,
the question seems to be still open at the time of this writing.
Of course, in the inﬁnite-dimensional case, eigenvalues need no longer exist
as simple examples show such as the unilateral shift
S : ℓ2 →ℓ2,
S(xk) = (0, x0, x1, . . . ),
or the Volterra operator
V : C([0, 1]) →C([0, 1]),

Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
which is described in Part I, Exercise 1.5.6 and Part IV, Example 22.2.6.
A class of operators that is, in many respects, still close to operators on
ﬁnite-dimensional spaces is given by the compact operators. Any non-zero
complex number λ in the spectrum of a compact operator is an eigenvalue for
the operator such that the corresponding eigenspace is ﬁnite-dimensional (see
Part I, Theorem 2.2.5). Hence the invariant subspace problem for compact oper-
ators is immediately reduced to the case of quasi-nilpotent compact operators,
that is, compact operators T with spectrum σ(T ) = {0} (see Part I, 2.1.2).
In 1954 it was shown by Aronszajn and Smith that each compact operator
on an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space X has a non-trivial, closed invariant
subspace. Results of Bernstein and Robinson (1966) and Halmos (1966) show
that each bounded operator T on X such that p(T ) is compact for some non-zero
polynomial p has a non-trivial closed invariant subspace.
Theaimofthischapteristoproveaninvariantsubspaceresultforcompactop-
erators due to Lomonosov (1973) that contains the above results as special cases.
Throughout Chapters 13–20 we shall write B(X) for the Banach algebra of
all bounded linear operators on a (complex) Banach space X. Here the norm
on B(X) is the operator norm. We denote the closed unit ball of X by X[1].
Deﬁnition 13.1.1
A continuous linear operator K ∈B(X) on a Banach space
X is compact if K(X[1]) is a relatively compact subset of X.
In 1973, Lomonosov proved the existence of non-trivial hyperinvariant sub-
spaces for each operator T ∈B(X) \ C1X that commutes with a non-zero com-
pact operator; we ﬁrst describe the elegant proof of this theorem.
Deﬁnition 13.1.2
Let T ∈B(X), and let M ⊂B(X) be arbitrary.
(a) A closed invariant subspace for T is a closed linear subspace Y ⊂X such
that T Y ⊂Y. We write
Lat(T ) = {Y; Yis a closed invariant subspace for T } .
(b) More generally, we deﬁne
Lat(M) =

{Lat(A); A ∈M} .
(c) The spaces contained in
Hyp(T ) =

{Lat(A); A ∈(T )′} ,
where (T )′ = {A ∈B(X); AT = T A} is the commutant of T , are called
the hyperinvariant subspaces for T .
The following is the result of Lomonosov.

13
Compact operators
139
Theorem 13.1.3 (Lomonosov)
Let T ∈B(X) \ C1X. Suppose that T com-
mutes with a non-zero compact operator. Then Hyp(T ) is non-trivial.
For the proof of Lomonosov’s theorem we shall need a well-known ﬁxed
point theorem.
Theorem 13.1.4 (Brouwer)
Let K ⊂Rn be a compact and convex set. Each
continuous map f : K →K has a ﬁxed point, i.e., there is at least one point
x ∈K with f (x) = x.
□
A proof of this result can be found in almost every book on algebraic topology.
We are mainly interested in the following inﬁnite-dimensional generalization
due to Schauder.
Corollary 13.1.5 (Schauder)
Let X be a normed space. Suppose that B ⊂X
is convex and that C ⊂B is a compact subset. Then each continuous map
f : B →C has a ﬁxed point.
Proof We reduce Schauder’s result to Brouwer’s ﬁxed point theorem. To prove
the corollary, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a sequence (xk) in B with
∥f (xk) −xk∥
k
−→0 .
Indeed, if y is the limit of a subsequence of ( f (xk)), then obviously f (y) = y.
Let ε > 0. Since C is compact, there are c1, . . . , cr ∈C with
C ⊂
r
i=1
Bε(ci) .
Note that the convex hull K := ⟨{c1, . . . , cr}⟩is homeomorphic to a convex
compact set in Rn. The functions fi : C →[0, ∞) and F : C →K which are
deﬁned by fi(x) = max(0, ε −∥x −ci∥) and
F(x) =

are both continuous with ∥F(x) −x∥< ε for all x ∈C.
To complete the proof, observe that, by Brouwer’s ﬁxed point theorem, the
map
T : K →K,
T (x) = F ◦f (x) ,

140
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
has a ﬁxed point z ∈K and that, for any such point z, we have
∥f (z) −z∥= ∥f (z) −F( f (z))∥< ε .
Hence f has a ﬁxed point.
□
As a consequence of Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem we obtain the so-called
Lomonosov lemma.
Lemma 13.1.6 (Lomonosov)
Let A ⊂B(X) be a subalgebra with 1 ∈A, and
suppose that
Lat(A) = {{0}, X} .
Then, for any compact operator K ∈B(X) \ {0}, there are an operator A ∈A
and a vector x ∈X \ {0} such that K Ax = x.
Proof
Choose a vector y ∈X such that the compact and convex set C :=
K B1(y) does not contain the zero vector 0 ∈X. Here we write B1(y) for the
open ball with radius 1 and centre y in X. Since Lat(A) is trivial, it follows that
Ax = X for all x ∈X \ {0}. Hence the compactness of C allows us to choose
ﬁnitely many operators A1, . . . , An ∈A with the property that
C ⊂

i=1

Fix any continuous map r : R+ →R+ with r−1(0) = [1, ∞). Then the com-

has a ﬁxed point x by Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem. But then we see imme-
diately that x = F(x) = K Ax for a suitable operator A ∈A.
□
Lomonosov’s lemma and elementary linear algebra yield a proof of
Lomonosov’s invariant subspace theorem.
Proof of Theorem 13.1.3
Under the hypotheses of Theorem 13.1.3, assume
towards a contradiction that the algebra A = (T )′ has no non-trivial invariant

subspace. Then, by Lomonosov’s lemma, there are A ∈A and 0 ̸= x ∈X with
ker(1 −K A) ̸= {0} .
Since K A is compact and commutes with T , the space on the left is a ﬁnite-
dimensional invariant subspace for T . But then T possesses eigenvalues. This
is impossible, since any eigenspace for T belongs to Lat(A).
□
A weaker version of Theorem 13.1.3 can be proved without using a ﬁxed
point argument. The spectral radius argument used in the following proof is due
to M. Hilden.
Theorem 13.1.7
Each compact operator K ∈B(X) \ {0} on an inﬁnite-
dimensional Banach space X has a non-trivial hyperinvariant subspace.
Proof
Set A = (K)′. Assume towards a contradiction that Lat(A) is trivial.
Choose y, C, and A1, . . . , An with respect to A and the compact operator K
exactly as in the proof of Lemma 13.1.6.
Then K y ∈C. Hence Ai1 K y ∈B1(y) for some 1 ≤i1 ≤n. But then
K Ai1 K y ∈C, and again Ai2 K Ai1 K y ∈B1(y) for some 1 ≤i2 ≤n. Contin-
uing in this way, we obtain vectors
yN = AiN · · · Ai1 K N y ∈B1(y) .
Deﬁne s = max(∥A1∥, . . . , ∥An∥). Then
r ≤∥yN∥≤s N∥K N∥∥y∥
(N ∈N)
holds with a suitable real number r > 0.
We conclude that the spectral radius (see Proposition 2.1.3)
ν(K) = lim
N→∞∥K N∥1/N = max{|z|; z ∈σ(K)}
is positive. Since any non-zero element in the spectrum of a compact operator
is an eigenvalue, we obtain as before the contradiction that Lat(A) is non-
trivial.
□

4. Use Lomonosov’s lemma to show that each norm-closed, unital subalgebra A
of B(X) that contains a non-zero compact operator K and possesses no non-
trivial closed invariant subspaces contains a non-zero ﬁnite-rank operator.
5. Let T ∈B(X) \ C1X be a bounded operator such that p(T ) is a compact
operator for some non-zero polynomial p ∈C[z]. Show that T has a non-
trivial hyperinvariant subspace.
13.3 Additional notes
At the time when Lomonosov’s paper appeared, the question whether each
bounded operator on a complex and separable inﬁnite-dimensional Banach
space possesses a non-trivial closed invariant subspace was still open. Counter-
examples on certain non-reﬂexive Banach spaces were given by C. J. Read
(1984) and P. Enﬂo (1987) (see also Beauzamy 1985). In the Hilbert-space case
the question is still open at the time of this writing. Theorem 13.1.3 is from
Lomonosov (1973).
Lomonosov’s result has been applied and improved in several directions. In
1974, Pearcy and Shields used Lomonosov’s result to show that each unital sub-
algebra A of B(X) without non-trivial closed invariant subspaces that contains
a non-zero compact operator has to be strongly dense in B(X). This gives a pos-
itive answer to the so-called transitive algebra conjecture in a special case. In
1975, Kim, Pearcy, and Shields proved that each non-scalar operator T ∈B(X)
for which there is a non-zero compact operator K such that im(T K −K T )
is at most one-dimensional has a non-trivial invariant subspace. Other gener-
alizations have been obtained by Fong, Nordgren, Radjabalipour, Radjavi and
Rosenthal.

Unitary dilations and the H ∞-functional
calculus
14.1
In Chapters 14–20 we shall describe and apply a second general method to con-
struct invariant subspaces for certain classes of operators on Banach or Hilbert
spaces. This method is due to Scott Brown, who used it in 1978 in his thesis
to prove the existence of non-trivial, closed invariant subspaces for subnormal
operators. All applications of this so-called Scott Brown technique depend on
the existence of a suitable H ∞-functional calculus for the operators under con-
sideration. We begin by studying a classical case in which the existence of an
H ∞-functional calculus is well-known.
Let H be a complex Hilbert space. Throughout Chapters 14–20, we shall
denote by [x, y] the inner product of given vectors x, y ∈H. For an open set
V in C, we write H(V ) for the Fr´echet space of all complex-valued analytic
functions on V equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on all
compact subsets of V .
A famous theorem of Sz.-Nagy from 1953 says that every contraction T on
H possesses a unitary dilation.
Theorem 14.1.1
Let T ∈B(H) be a contraction. Then there exists a Hilbert
space K containing H and a unitary operator U ∈B(K) such that
T k = PU k|H
(k ∈N) ,
where P denotes the orthogonal projection from K onto H.

The operators D =

1 −T ∗T and D∗=
√
1 −T T ∗satisfy the relations
T D = D∗T
and
T ∗D∗= DT ∗.
Indeed, since T (1 −T ∗T ) = (1 −T T ∗)T , we obtain that
T p(1 −T ∗T ) = p(1 −T T ∗)T
holds for each polynomial p. But then the Stone–Weierstrass theorem implies
that
T f (1 −T ∗T ) = f (1 −T T ∗)T
for each continuous function f ∈C([0, 1]). Choosing f (t) = √t, we obtain
the ﬁrst intertwining relation. The second follows analogously.
AsaconsequenceweremarkthatthespacesD = DH andD∗= D∗H satisfy
the inclusions
T D ⊂D∗
and
T ∗D∗⊂D .
We regard H as a subspace of the Hilbert space
K = {(hn)n∈Z ∈H; h0 ∈H, hn ∈D and h−n ∈D∗for all n ∈N}
via the canonical isometry H →K deﬁned by
h →(. . . , 0, [h], 0, . . . ) ,
where the square bracket indicates the zero-th position.
We claim that the linear operator U : K →K deﬁned by
Uh = (. . . , h−3, h−2, [D∗h−1 + T h0], −T ∗h−1 + Dh0, h1, h2, . . . )
is a unitary dilation of T . To see that U is isometric, note that all the terms in
∥h∥2 −∥Uh∥2 = ∥h−1∥2 + ∥h0∥2
−[D∗h−1 + T h0, D∗h−1 + T h0]
−[−T ∗h−1 + Dh0, −T ∗h−1 + Dh0]

14
Unitary dilations and the H ∞-functional calculus

cancel each other. To check that U is surjective, note that the linear operator
V : K →K deﬁned by
V h = (. . . , h−1, D∗h0 −T h1, [T ∗h0 + Dh1], h2, h3, . . . )
yields a right inverse for U.
Identifying H with a subspace of K, an elementary induction shows that
U nh = (. . . , 0, [T nh], DT n−1h, . . . , Dh, 0, . . . ) .
Thus we have shown that U is a unitary dilation of T .
□
A unitary dilation U ∈B(K) of a contraction T ∈B(H) is called minimal
if the only reducing subspace for U containing H is the space K itself or,
equivalently, if
K =
 
n∈Z
U n H.
Remark 14.1.2
(a) It is elementary to check that the unitary dilation constructed in the proof
of Theorem 14.1.1 is minimal.
(b) If U ∈B(K) is a unitary dilation of a given contraction T ∈B(H), then
the restriction of U to K0 = !
n∈Z
U n H is a minimal unitary dilation of T .
(c) If U ∈B(K) and V ∈B(
K) are minimal unitary dilations of T ∈B(H),
then the unique continuous linear map  : K →
K with
(U nh) = V nh
(n ∈Z, h ∈H)
is a unitary operator with U = V .
As an important application of the dilation theorem, we obtain a continuity
property for the polynomial functional calculus of a contraction.
Corollary 14.1.3 (von Neumann’s inequality)
Let T ∈B(H) be a contrac-
tion. Then
∥p(T )∥≤|p|D
for all polynomials p ∈C[z].
Proof
Let U be a unitary dilation of T . Using the fact that the C(σ(U))–
functional calculus of the normal operator U is isometric (see Part I, Additional

146
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
notes, 4.5.2), we obtain the inequalities
∥p(T )∥= ∥Pp(U)|H∥≤∥p(U)∥= |p|σ(U) ≤|p|D .
□
Since the restrictions of the complex polynomials to the unit disc D are uni-
formly dense in the disc algebra A(D) (see Examples 1.2 (iii)), von Neumann’s
inequality is equivalent to the existence of a contractive disc algebra functional
calculus. For more on the functional calculus, see Chapter 4.
Corollary 14.1.4
Let T ∈B(H) be a contraction. Then there is a unique con-
tractive algebra homomorphism & : A(D) →B(H) extending the polynomial
functional calculus of the operator T .
✷
We want to describe conditions under which the disc algebra functional
calculus of T extends to H ∞(D).
Let V ⊂C be a non-empty, open set. Then L∞(V ) formed with respect to
the planar Lebesgue measure is the dual space of L1(V ), and hence carries
a weak-∗topology, denoted by σ. Let H ∞(V ) be the Banach algebra of all
bounded analytic functions on V (see Examples 1.2 (xi)).
Lemma 14.1.5
The space H ∞(V ) is a weak-∗closed subspace of L∞(V ).
Proof Let B be the closed unit ball of L∞(V ). By the Krein–Smulian theorem
(see Schaefer 1966, Theorem IV.6.4), it sufﬁces to show that H ∞(V ) ∩B ⊂B
is weak-∗closed. Since L1(V ) is separable, (B, σ) is metrizable. Let ( fk) be a
sequence in H ∞(V ) ∩B with σ −limk fk = f . By Montel’s theorem, we may
suppose, after passing to a subsequence, that ( fk)
k

As a consequence of the previous result we can identify H ∞(V ) with the
dual space of the separable Banach space Q := L1(V )/⊥H ∞(V ).

Lemma 14.1.6
A sequence ( fk) in H ∞(V ) is a weak-∗zero sequence if and
only if supk ∥fk∥< ∞and ( fk) converges to zero pointwise (or equivalently,
uniformly on compact subsets of V ).
Proof Let ( fk) be a weak-∗zero sequence. By the uniform boundedness prin-
ciple, ( fk) is norm-bounded. By the argument given in the previous proof, each
subsequence of ( fk) has a subsequence converging to zero in the Fr´echet space
H(V ). Hence limk fk = 0 in H(V ).
Conversely, suppose that ( fk) is norm-bounded and converges to zero point-
wise. By the dominated convergence theorem,


(ϕ ∈C00(V )) .
Since ( fk) is bounded in L1(V )′, this implies that ( fk) is a weak-∗zero
sequence.
□
Let X be a Banach space. Since the space H ∞(V ) has a separable pred-
ual, a linear map  : H ∞(V ) →X′ is weak-∗continuous if and only if it is
sequentially weak-∗continuous (Exercise 14.2.2). Thus in particular all point
evaluations
Eλ : H ∞(V ) →C,
f →f (λ)
(λ ∈V ) ,
are weak-∗continuous.
Let H be a Hilbert space. Then B(H) can be identiﬁed isometrically with
the dual space of the Banach space C1(H) of all trace-class operators on H via
the bilinear form
C1(H) × B(H) →C,
(A, T ) →Tr(AT ) .
For the deﬁnition of the trace and trace-class operators the reader is referred to
Conway (1991, Chapter 1). The weak-∗topology of B(H) with respect to this
duality is usually called the ultraweak operator topology. It is given by the
seminorms
px,y(T ) =

∞

k=1
[T xk, yk]
 ,
where x = (xk) and y = (yk) run through all square summable sequences in H
(see Stratila and Zsido 1979, Chapter 1). On the bounded subsets of B(H), the

148

weak operator topology and the weak-∗topology coincide. By deﬁnition the
weak operator topology is the locally convex topology on B(H) given by
the seminorms qx,y(T ) = |[T x, y]| where x, y ∈H are arbitrary.
Remark 14.1.7
By the previous discussion a map  : H ∞(V ) →B(H) is
weak-∗continuous if and only if, for each weak-∗zero sequence ( fk) in H ∞(V ),
lim
k [( fk)x, y] = 0
for all x, y ∈H.
Using the same principle, we obtain a useful characterization of those maps
& : A(V ) →B(H) that extend to a weak-∗continuous linear map
 : H ∞(V ) →B(H) .
Here A(V ) denotes the closed subalgebra of C(V ) consisting of all functions
f ∈C(V ) for which f |V is analytic; it is related to the uniform algebra A(V )
of Examples 1.2(v).
Deﬁnition 14.1.8
Let V be a non-empty, open set in C.
(i) A sequence ( fk) in A(V ) is a Montel sequence if ( fk|V ) is a weak-∗zero
sequence in H ∞(V ).
(ii) The space A(V ) is pointwise boundedly dense in H ∞(V ) if, for each func-
tion f in H ∞(V ), there is a sequence ( fk) in A(V ) with ∥fk∥≤∥f ∥such
that ( fk) is weak-∗convergent to f .
Let (Ak) be sequence of operators in B(H). We shall write
WOT −lim
k→∞Ak = A
if (Ak) converges to an operator A ∈B(H) in the weak operator topology, that
is, if limk→∞[Akx, y] = [Ax, y] for all vectors x, y in H.
Lemma 14.1.9
Suppose that A(V ) is pointwise boundedly dense in H ∞(V ).
Then a continuous linear operator & : A(V ) →B(H) extends to a weak-∗
continuous linear operator  : H ∞(V ) →B(H) if and only if
WOT −lim
k→∞&( fk) = 0
for each Montel sequence ( fk) in A(V ).

14
Unitary dilations and the H ∞-functional calculus
149
Proof The necessity of the stated condition is obvious.
Suppose that & satisﬁes the above continuity property. If f ∈H ∞(V ) and if
x, y are vectors in H, then, for each sequence ( fk) in A(V ) with weak-∗limit
f , the limit
fx,y = lim
k [( fk)x, y]
exists and is independent of the choice of ( fk). Since we can achieve that
∥fk∥≤∥f ∥, this argument gives an extension of & to a continuous linear map
 : H ∞(V ) →B(H) with ∥∥= ∥&∥and
[( f )x, y] = fx,y
( f ∈H ∞(V ), x, y ∈H) .
Using the facts that the unit ball B of H ∞(V ) is metrizable in the weak-∗
topology and that B ∩A(V ) is weak-∗dense in B, one can easily show that,
for each weak-∗zero sequence ( fk) contained in B,
lim
k→∞[( fk)x, y] = 0
(x, y ∈H) .
Therefore the extension  of & is weak-∗continuous.
□
Note that the extension constructed in the above proof satisﬁes ∥∥= ∥&∥.
It is elementary (Exercise 14.2.3) to show that  remains multiplicative if & is
supposed to be multiplicative.
A contraction T ∈B(H) is called completely non-unitary if there is no non-
zero reducing subspace for T such that T restricted to this subspace is a unitary
operator. A classical result of Sz.-Nagy and Foia¸s shows that each completely
non–unitary contraction T possesses a weak-∗continuous H ∞(D)-functional
calculus. A proof of this result can be found in Sz.-Nagy and Foia¸s (1970,
Chapter 3).
We indicate brieﬂy an alternative proof, which can be extended to more
general settings (see Eschmeier 1997).
Let & : A(D) →B(H) be a contractive algebra homomorphism. By the max-
imum modulus principle we may regard A(D) as a closed linear subspace of
C(T) (see Part I, Exercise 1.5.4). By the Hahn–Banach and the Riesz represen-
tation theorems, there is a family of measures µ(x, y) ∈M(T) (x, y ∈H) such
that
[&( f )x, y] =

and ∥µ(x, y)∥≤∥x∥∥y∥. We call (µ(x, y))x,y∈H a representing family for &.

Let m be the normalized linear Lebesgue measure on T. We call a measure µ
in M(T) absolutely continuous (singular) if µ ≪m (µ⊥m). By the Lebesgue
decomposition theorem, each measure µ ∈M(T) has a unique decomposition
µ = µa + µs
into an absolutely continuous part µa and a singular part µs.
Theorem 14.1.10
(F. and M. Riesz theorem) Let µ ∈M(T) be a measure

□
Deﬁnition 14.1.11
A contractive algebra homomorphism & : A(D) →B(H)
is absolutely continuous (singular) if it possesses a representing family of mea-
sures that are absolutely continuous (singular).
The Lebesgue decomposition for measures yields a corresponding decom-
position for disc algebra representations.
Theorem 14.1.12
Let & : A(D) →B(H) be a contractive algebra homomor-
phism. Then there are contractive algebra homomorphisms
&a, &s : A(D) →B(H)
such that & = &a + &s, &a is absolutely continuous, &s is singular, and
&a( f )&s(g) = 0 = &s(g)&a( f )
( f, g ∈A(D)) .
Proof Choose a representing family µ(x, y) of measures for &. Let
µ(x, y) = µa(x, y) + µs(x, y)
be the Lebesgue decomposition. Then the map
H × H →M(T)

A(D)⊥,
(x, y) →[µ(x, y)] ,
is sesquilinear. By the F. and M. Riesz theorem, the maps
H × H →M(T)

(x, y) →[µa(x, y)] ,
H × H →M(T),
(x, y) →µs(x, y) ,

14

are sesquilinear. It follows easily that there are unique contractive linear maps
&a, &s : A(D) →B(H) with
[&a( f )x, y] =

T
f dµa(x, y),
[&s( f )x, y] =

T
f dµs(x, y) .
For f, g ∈A(D) and x, y ∈H, we have

T
f g dµ(x, y) = [&( f )x, &(g)∗y] =

T
f dµ(x, &(g)∗y) .
Again by the F. and M. Riesz theorem and the uniqueness of the Lebesgue
decomposition, we have
gµ(x, y) −µ(x, &(g)∗y) = gµa(x, y) −µa(x, &(g)∗y) ∈A(D)⊥.
It follows that

T
f g dµa(x, y) = [&a( f )x, &(g)∗y] =

T
g dµ(&a( f )x, y) .
As above, we conclude that µs(&a( f )x, y) = 0 and that
f µa(x, y) −µa(&a( f )x, y) ∈A(D)⊥.
In this way, we obtain the multiplicativity of &a. Indeed,
[&a( f g)x, y] =

T
g dµa(&a( f )x, y) = [&a(g)&a( f )x, y] .
Furthermore, for f, g ∈A(D) and x, y ∈H,
[&s(g)&a( f )x, y] =

T
g dµs(&a( f )x, y) = 0 .
The remaining parts of Theorem 14.1.12 can be obtained in a similar way.

Deﬁnition 14.1.13
A measure µ ∈M(T) is a Henkin measure if

152
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
Since

f dm = f (0) for all f ∈A(D), the Lebesgue measure m is a Henkin
measure. If µ ∈M(T) is a Henkin measure, then, by Henkin’s theorem (see
Rudin 1980, Theorem 9.3.1), each measure ν ≪µ is a Henkin measure
(cf. Exercise 15.2.4).
It can easily be seen that the representations &a, &s in Theorem 14.1.12 are
uniquely determined by & (Exercise 14.2.4). By the preceding remarks, and
by Lemma 14.1.9, the absolutely continuous part &a of & extends to a weak-∗
continuous algebra homomorphism a : H ∞(D) →B(H).
Since the family (µs(x, y))x,y∈H depends in a sesquilinear way on x and y
and satisﬁes ∥µs(x, y)∥≤∥x∥∥y∥, we can deﬁne a contractive linear extension
s : BM(T) →B(H) of &s by the formula
[s( f )x, y] =

T
f dµs(x, y)
( f ∈BM(T), x, y ∈H) .
Here BM(T) is the Banach algebra of all bounded measurable functions on T.
An argument similar to the one used in the proof of Theorem 14.1.12 shows
that s is multiplicative. Since characteristic functions correspond to orthog-
onal projections under s, the map s is even a C∗-algebra homomorphism
(Exercise 14.2.5).
If one denotes by Hs = &s(1)H the singular part of H, then
C(T) →B(Hs),
f →s( f )|Hs ,
becomes a unital C∗-algebra homomorphism.
Corollary 14.1.14
(Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s) Let T ∈B(H) be a completely non-
unitary contraction on a Hilbert space H. Then there is a unique weak-∗
continuous algebra homomorphism  : H ∞(D) →B(H) with ∥∥= 1 and
(1) = 1H, (z) = T .
Proof If & : A(D) →B(H) is the disc algebra functional calculus of T then,
with the above notations, T |Hs = s(z)|Hs is a unitary operator on the reducing
subspace Hs for T . Hence Hs = {0} and & = &a has the claimed extension.

We call a contraction T ∈B(H) absolutely continuous if its disc algebra

14.3 Additional notes
The idea of proving the existence of the Nagy–Foia¸s functional calculus by
decomposing suitable representing measures into an absolutely continuous and
a singular part goes back to Mlak (1969). The same idea can be used to de-
compose representations of the ball algebra A(B) in the multivariable case
(see Eschmeier 1997 or Chapter 20). In this case the Lebesgue decomposition
theorem has to be replaced by a more general decomposition theorem due to
Glicksberg, K¨onig, and Seever (see Rudin 1980, Theorem 9.4.4). The classic
proof and many other applications can be found in the book of Sz.-Nagy and
Foia¸s (1970, Chapter 3).

Hyperinvariant subspaces
15.1
Let T ∈B(H) be a contraction, and let & : A(D) →B(H), f →&( f ), be
its disc algebra functional calculus. Recall that T is said to be of type C0·
(respectively, C·0) if
(T k)
SOT
−→0
(respectively, (T ∗k)
SOT
−→0).
By a result of Sz.-Nagy and Foia¸s, a contraction which is neither of type C0·
nor of type C·0 either is a scalar multiple of the identity operator or possesses
non-trivial hyperinvariant subspaces. The following observation will help us to
extend this result to more general settings.
Lemma 15.1.1
A contraction T is of type C0· if and only if (&( fk))
SOT
−→0 for
each Montel sequence ( fk) in A(D).
Proof Fix a Montel sequence ( fk) with ∥fk∥≤1 and a natural number N, and
then use the Taylor expansion of fk at zero to write
fk = pk + zN gk,
where pk is a polynomial of degree less than N. Then pk →0 uniformly on D,
and also, by the maximum modulus principle,
∥gk∥≤∥fk∥+ ∥pk∥≤2
for k sufﬁciently large. But then, for any given vector x ∈H, it follows that
lim sup
k→∞
∥&( fk)x∥≤2∥T N x∥.

This shows that the stated condition is necessary for T to be of type C0·. The
sufﬁciency of the condition is obvious.
□
If T is absolutely continuous, then an analogue of the last lemma for the
H ∞(D)-functional calculus follows in the same way. Let V be a bounded open
set in C and let & : A(V ) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomorphism. We
set V ∗= {z; z ∈V }, and we consider the continuous algebra homomorphism
& : A(V ∗) →B(H),
f →&(f )∗

where f (z) = f (¯z)

.
Deﬁnition 15.1.2
A continuous algebra homomorphism & : A(V ) →B(H)
is of type C0· if (&( fk))
SOT
−→0 for each Montel sequence ( fk) in A(V ). We say
that & is of type C·0 if & is of type C0·.
For representations  : H ∞(V ) →B(H), we deﬁne the C0·- and C·0-
properties analogously, replacing Montel sequences by arbitrary weak-∗zero
sequences in H ∞(V ). Our generalization of the Sz.-Nagy–Foia¸s result uses the
following property of Hankel-type operators.
Theorem 15.1.3
For each continuous function g ∈C(V ), the operator
Sg : A(V ) →C(V )/A(V ),
f →[g f ],
is compact.
□
For a proof of this result, we refer the reader to Cole and Gamelin (1982,
Theorem 6.3).
Corollary 15.1.4
Let g ∈C(∂V ). For each Montel sequence ( fk) in A(V ),
there is a Montel sequence (gk) in A(V ) such that
| fkg −gk|∂V
k
−→0.
Proof
We may suppose that g ∈C(V ). Let ( fk) be a Montel sequence. By
Theorem 15.1.3, each subsequence of ([g fk])k has a convergent subsequence in
C(V )/A(V ). Since weak-∗limk fk = 0, any such convergent subsequence has
limit zero. Hence limk[g fk] = 0 in C(V )/A(V ), and we can choose a sequence
(gk) in A(V ) such that (g fk −gk) converges to zero uniformly on V . Clearly
(gk) is a Montel sequence.

Let λ : ℓ∞→C be a continuous linear form of norm 1 such that λ((sk)) =
λ((sk+1)) for each sequence (sk) ∈ℓ∞and such that λ((sk)) = limk sk for each
convergent sequence of complex numbers. Then, for each bounded sequence
(xk) in H, there is a unique vector L(xk) in H with
λ(([xk, y])) = [L(xk), y]
(y ∈H) .
The resulting map
L : ℓ∞(H) →H, (xk) →L((xk)) ,
is continuous and linear, with norm 1, such that L((xk)) = (xk+1) for each
sequence (xk) in ℓ∞(H) and L((xk)) = x whenever (xk) converges weakly to
a vector x in H. The very deﬁnition of L implies that L((Axk)) = AL((xk)) for
each operator A ∈B(H) and each bounded sequence (xk) in H.
Theorem 15.1.5
Let & : A(V ) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomor-
phism. If & is not of type C·0, then there is a non-zero bounded linear map
j : C(∂V ) →H with &( f ) j = j M( f |∂V ) for all f ∈A(V ).
Proof If & is not of type C·0, then there is a Montel sequence ( fk) in A(V ) and
a vector x ∈H such that ∥fk∥≤1 and such that the limit ε = limk ∥&( fk)∗x∥
exists and is non-zero. Deﬁne xk = &( fk)∗x/∥&( fk)∗x∥.
Let g ∈C(∂V ). By Corollary 15.1.4, there is a Montel sequence (gk) in A(V )
such that |g fk −gk|∂V
k
−→0. The mapping
j : C(∂V ) →H,
j(g) = L(&(gk)xk) ,
is well-deﬁned, continuous and linear with ∥j∥≤∥&∥. Furthermore, by con-
struction, we have [ j(1), x] = ε and &( f ) j = j M f |∂V for all f in A(V ).
□
For sufﬁciently nice domains V in C (or even Cn), also the converse of the
last theorem holds (see Eschmeier 1997, Theorem 2.1).
Let T ∈B(H), and let j : C(∂V ) →H be a bounded operator intertwining
Mz on C(∂V ) and T on H. Denote by I( j) the largest closed ideal in C(∂V ) con-
tained in the kernel of j, and deﬁne the support s( j) of j as the common zero set
of the functions in I( j). For f ∈C(∂V ), let M f be the multiplication operator
M f : C(∂V ) →C(∂V ),
g →f g.
Using continuous partitions of unity one can prove the next result.

Lemma 15.1.6
Let j and T be as explained above. Then:
(i) if z ∈s( j) and if f ∈C(∂V ) satisﬁes f (z) ̸= 0, then j ◦M f ̸= 0;
(ii) s( j ◦M f ) ⊂s( j) ∩supp( f ) for all f ∈C(∂V );
(iii) if s( j) = {z}, then im( j) ∈Lat(T ) is one-dimensional and z ∈σp(T ). □
We leave the proof as an elementary exercise (Exercise 15.2.1). Using the
above observations, we can prove a generalization of the cited result of Sz.-Nagy
and Foia¸s.
Theorem 15.1.7
Let & : A(V ) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomor-
phism. If & is neither of type C0· nor of type C·0, then either T = &(z) is a
scalar multiple of the identity operator or Hyp(T ) is non-trivial.
Proof The hypothesis that & is neither C·0 nor C0· allows us to choose non-zero
bounded linear maps
j : C(∂V ) →H
and
k : C(∂V ) →H ′
such that j intertwines Mz on C(∂V ) with T on H, and k intertwines Mz on
C(∂V ) with the Banach-space adjoint T ′ ∈B(H ′) of T . By Lemma 15.1.6, we
may suppose that s( j) and s(k) are disjoint. By Tietze’s extension theorem, the
maps j and k extend to bounded intertwiners
J : C(s( j)) →H
and
K : C(s(k)) →H ′.
For each operator A commuting with T , the composition
X = X(A) : C(s( j))
A◦J
−→H
K ′
−→M(s(k))
intertwines Mz on C(s( j)) and Mz on M(s(k)). Since the last two operators have
disjoint spectra (their spectra are s( j) and s(k), respectively), a well-known
result of Rosenblum (1956) shows that X = 0. Hence the space
 
{im AJ; A ∈(T )′} ⊂ker(K ′)
is a non-trivial hyperinvariant subspace for T .
□
If A(V ) is pointwise boundedly dense in H ∞(V ) and if & : A(V ) →B(H)
is C0· or C·0, then, by Lemma 14.1.9, the map & extends to a weak-∗continuous
algebra homomorphism  : H ∞(V ) →B(H). It is elementary to check that
the C0·- or C·0-property is inherited by  (Exercise 15.2.2).

We end this section with an application of Theorem 15.1.5 to subnormal
operators.
Corollary 15.1.8
Let S ∈B(H) be subnormal, and let & : A(V ) →B(H) be
a continuous unital algebra homomorphism with &(z) = S for some bounded
open set V in C. If & is not of type C·0, then there is a non-zero reducing space
M for S such that S|M is normal with σ(S|M) ⊂∂V .
Proof Let N ∈B(K) be the minimal normal extension of the subnormal oper-
ator S, and let j : C(∂V ) →H be a non-zero bounded linear map intertwining
Mz on C(∂V ) and S on H. A Fuglede-type argument (Exercise 15.2.3) shows
that j intertwines Mz on C(∂V ) and N ∗on K. Therefore the image of j is
contained in the space
H0 = {x ∈H; N ∗kx ∈H for all k ∈Z+},
which reduces N, and hence also S. But then S|H0 = N|H0 is normal with
j(C(∂V )) ⊂X N|H0(∂V ) .
Clearly the space on the right-hand side can be chosen as M.
□
If in Corollary 15.1.8 the operator S is asked to be pure (or to possess no
normal part with spectrum in ∂V ), then & has to be of type C·0.

15.3 Additional notes
The classic result of Sz.-Nagy and Foia¸s saying that a contraction T which is
neither of type C0· nor of type C·0 is either a scalar multiple of the identity or
has non-trivial hyperinvariant subspaces can be found in Sz.-Nagy and Foia¸s
(1970, Theorem II.5.4). Results similar to Theorem 15.1.5 and Theorem 15.1.7
are contained in a paper of Apostol and Chevreau (1982). If in Corollary 15.1.8
the operator S is only supposed to be subdecomposable, then, if & is not of type
C·0, it follows that HS(∂V ) ̸= {0}. Since hyponormal operators are subdecom-
posable and since a hyponormal operator whose spectrum has planar Lebesgue
measure zero is normal, it follows that a hyponormal contraction is completely
non-unitary if and only if it is of type C·0.

Let T ∈B(H) be a contraction. In 1979 Brown, Chevreau, and Pearcy proved
that T possesses non-trivial invariant subspaces if its spectrum is rich enough
close to the unit circle. It is the aim of this chapter to give a proof of this result
and to explain, at the same time, the basic ideas of the Scott Brown factorization
technique.
Deﬁnition 16.1.1
Let V ⊂C be open. A set σ ⊂C is dominating in V if
| f |V = | f |V ∩σ for each f ∈H ∞(V ).
With this notion the cited invariant-subspace result is the following.
Theorem 16.1.2 (Brown, Chevreau, and Pearcy)
Let T ∈B(H) be a con-
traction such that σ(T ) is dominating in D. Then T has non-trivial invariant
subspaces.
For a subset M of a complex normed space E, we denote by C(M) and (M)
the convex and absolutely convex hull of M. We write C(M) and (M) for the
closures of these sets.
Lemma 16.1.3
A set σ is dominating in an open set V in C if and only if
({Eλ; λ ∈σ ∩V }) = Q[1] .
□
This result is a direct consequence of the separation theorem (Exercise
16.2.1). To prove Theorem 16.1.2, we are allowed to make certain reductions.
First, according to Corollary 14.1.14 we may suppose that T has a weak-∗-
continuous H ∞-functional calculus  : H ∞(D) →B(H). The second reduc-
tion concerns the type of the spectrum of T .

For an operator A ∈B(X) on a Banach space X, we consider the left essential
spectrum
σℓe(A) = {z ∈C; im(z −A) is not closed or dim ker(z −A) = ∞}
and the right essential spectrum
σre(A) = {z ∈C; dim(X/(z −A)X) = ∞} .
The essential spectrum σe(A) = σℓe(A) ∪σre(A) consists of all points z ∈C
such that dim ker(z −A) = ∞or dim(X/im(z −A)) = ∞. If we want to prove
the existence of a non-trivial invariant subspace for A, we may assume that
σ(A) = σℓe(A) = σre(A) (Exercise 16.2.2). For more on the essential spectrum,
see Chapter 24.
In view of these remarks we may and shall suppose until the end of the proof
of Theorem 16.1.2 that T has a weak-∗continuous H ∞-functional calculus and
that σ(T ) = σℓe(T ).
For x, y ∈H, the linear functional
x ⊗y : H ∞(D) →C,
x ⊗y( f ) = [( f )x, y] ,
is
weak-∗-continuous
and
deﬁnes
an
element
in
the
predual
space
Q = L1(D)/⊥H ∞(D) of H ∞(D). Note that it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a point λ in D
and vectors x, y in H with
Eλ = x ⊗y .
Indeed, in this case the space
M =
 
{( f )x; f ∈H ∞(D) with f (λ) = 0}
is an invariant subspace for T different from the whole space H. If M = {0},
then (λ −T )x = 0. So in any case Lat(T ) is non-trivial.
Let L be the set of all elements L in Q with the property that, for any given
ε > 0 and any choice of vectors a1, . . . , as, b1, . . . , bs in H (with s arbitrary),
there are vectors x, y in the closed unit ball of H with
(i) ∥L −x ⊗y∥< ε,
(ii) ∥x ⊗bi∥< ε, ∥ai ⊗y∥< ε
(i = 1, . . . , s) .
Proposition 16.1.4
The set L is norm-closed and absolutely convex.

Proof Obviously, L is norm-closed.
Let L1, L2 ∈L and c1, c2 ∈C with |c1| + |c2| ≤1 be given. We indicate
only how to ﬁnd vectors x, y for L = c1L1 + c2L2 that satisfy condition (i).
For any r > 0, there are x1, x2, y1, y2 in the closed unit ball of H with
∥Li −xi ⊗yi∥< r
(i = 1, 2)
and such that x1 ⊗y2, x2 ⊗y1, x2 ⊗x1, and y1 ⊗y2 have norm less than r.
Factor ci = tisi with complex numbers ti, si such that
|ti| = |si| = |ci|1/2
(i = 1, 2) .
Then x = t1x1 + t2x2, y = s1y1 + s2y2 satisfy max(∥x∥2, ∥y∥2) ≤1 + 2r as
well as
∥L −x ⊗y∥< 3r .
All that remains is to normalize x and y in a suitable way.

By Theorem 15.1.7 and the remarks following Theorem 15.1.7, we may
suppose that  is of type C0· or C·0. The next observation shows how these
continuity properties of the Nagy–Foia¸s functional calculus can be used. Recall
that a sequence (xk) in H is a weak zero sequence if limk→∞[xk, y] = 0 for
each vector y ∈H.
Lemma 16.1.5
If  is of type C0· and (yk) is a weak zero sequence in H, then
lim
k x ⊗yk = 0
(x ∈H) .
If  is of type C·0 and (xk) is a weak zero sequence in H, then
lim
k xk ⊗y = 0
(y ∈H) .
Proof Fix x ∈H. In the ﬁrst case, by a normal family argument, the set
K = {( f )x; f ∈H ∞(D)[1]} ⊂H
is compact. Hence, for each weak zero sequence (yk) in H,
∥x ⊗yk∥= sup{|[z, yk]|; z ∈K}
k
−→0 .
In the second case we use the same argument for  instead of .

A complex number z belongs to σℓe(T ) if and only if there is an orthonormal
sequence (xk) in H with ((z −T )xk)
k
−→0 (Exercise 16.2.3). The next result
shows why it is useful to have rich left essential spectrum.
Lemma 16.1.6
If (xk) is an orthonormal sequence with limk(z −T )xk = 0,
then
lim
k→∞xk ⊗y = 0
(y ∈H)
and lim
k→∞(Ez −xk ⊗xk) = 0 .
Proof Let f ∈H ∞(D)[1], and let λ ∈D. Then the unique function g ∈H(D)
with(z −λ)g(z) = f (z) −f (λ)for z ∈Disboundedwith∥g∥∞≤2/(1 −|λ|)
(Exercise 16.2.4). For f ∈H ∞(D)[1], choose g as above, and note that
|xk ⊗y( f )| ≤|[(g)(T −λ)xk, y]| + |[xk, y]|
(k ∈N) .
This proves the ﬁrst part of the assertion. Similarly,
|(xk ⊗xk −Eλ)( f )| = |[( f )xk, xk] −f (λ)| = |[(g)(T −λ)xk, xk]|
k

uniformly for f in the unit ball of H ∞(D).
□
Since Lat(T ) is non-trivial if and only if Lat(T ∗) is non-trivial, we may
suppose that  is of type C0·. Since σℓe(T ) is dominating in D, the previous
results imply that the closed unit ball of Q is contained in L. Now a standard
procedure, generally called the Scott Brown technique, can be used to factor all
elements in Q.
Lemma 16.1.7
For L ∈Q, x0, y0 ∈H, and ε > 0, there are x, y ∈H with
∥L −x ⊗y∥< ε and ∥x −x0∥, ∥y −y0∥≤∥L −x0 ⊗y0∥1/2 .
Proof Let d = ∥L −x0 ⊗y0∥> 0. By the above remarks, for eachr > 0 there
are vectors a, b in the closed unit ball of H with
∥(1/d)(L −x0 ⊗y0) −a ⊗b∥< r
and ∥x0 ⊗b∥< r, ∥a ⊗y0∥< r. In view of the estimate
∥L −(x0 + d1/2a) ⊗(y0 + d1/2b)∥≤∥L −x0 ⊗y0 −d(a ⊗b)∥+ 2d1/2r ,

164

it is clear that x = x0 + d1/2a and y = y0 + d1/2b will satisfy all assertions,
provided that r is small enough.
□
Theorem 16.1.8
For L ∈Q, x0, y0 ∈H, and ε > 0, there are x, y ∈H with
L = x ⊗y and ∥x −x0∥, ∥y −y0∥< ∥L −x0 ⊗y0∥1/2 + ε.
Proof Deﬁne d0 = ∥L −x0 ⊗y0∥and choose dk > 0 (k ≥1) with

k
< ε .
Inductively, using in each step Lemma 16.1.7, we can choose sequences (xk),
(yk) in H with ∥L −xk ⊗yk∥≤dk and
∥xk+1 −xk∥, ∥yk+1 −yk∥≤d1/2
k
(k ≥0).
Clearly, x and y can be chosen as x = limk xk and y = limk yk.
□
Applying the last result to the particular case that L is a point evaluation, we
obtain the existence of non-trivial invariant subspaces for T . Thus the proof of
Theorem 16.1.2 is complete.

16.3 Additional notes
The invariant subspace result stated as Theorem 16.1.2 is from Brown, Chevreau
and Pearcy (1979). If T is a contraction such that σ(T ) is dominating in D,
then σ(T ) contains the unit circle (Exercise 16.2.5). It was proved by Brown,
Chevreau and Pearcy (1988) that the latter condition sufﬁces to guarantee the
existence of a non-trivial invariant subspace. A very readable proof of this re-
sult is contained in Bercovici (1990). An extension to the case of polynomially
bounded operators on Banach spaces is given in Ambrozie and M¨uller (2003).
Results of Bercovici, Foia¸s and Pearcy show that the H ∞-functional calculus of
a completely non–unitary contraction whose essential spectrum σe(T ) is dom-
inating in D allows the factorization of inﬁnite matrices with coefﬁcients in
the predual Q of H ∞(D). It follows that contractions of this type possess an
extremely rich invariant subspace lattice. For details on this class of contrac-
tions, and many other results on the structure of the invariant subspace lattice
of contractions obtained with the Scott Brown technique, the reader is referred
to Bercovici, Foia¸s and Pearcy (1985).

Invariant subspaces for subnormal operators
17.1
In 1978 Scott Brown proved the following general invariant-subspace result.
Theorem 17.1.1 (Brown)
Each subnormal operator S on a Hilbert space H
of dimension at least 2 has a non-trivial invariant subspace.
The original proof of Brown (1978) was quite involved, and it was the starting
point for a whole new area in operator theory. Later J. E. Thomson (1986) gave
a simpler proof of the original Scott Brown result. We begin by explaining
Thomson’s proof of Theorem 17.1.1.
Fix a non-zero vector x in H. To prove Theorem 17.1.1, we may suppose that
H =
 
{Skx; k ∈Z+} .
But then there is a positive measure µ on a compact set K in C such that S
is unitarily equivalent to Mz ∈B(P2(µ)) (Exercise 17.2.4). Therefore we only
consider the case where S = Mz on P2(µ) as above. Clearly we may suppose
that P2(µ) ̸= L2(µ). As before we denote by λ the two-dimensional Lebesgue
measure on C.
Lemma 17.1.2
Let g ∈Lq(µ) \ {0} for some real number 1 < q < 2. Then
there is a point w ∈C such that
(i) g/(z −w) ∈Lq(µ)
and
(ii)

K
g(z)
z −w dµ(z) ̸= 0 .
Proof Fix R > 0 with |z| ≤R for all z ∈K. The function h deﬁned on K × K
by
h(z, w) = |g(z)|q/|(z −w)|q
(= 0 for z = w)

is measurable. Since, for each z in K, we have

K
|z −w|−qdw ≤

DR(z)
|w|−qdw ≤

D2R(0)
|w|−qdw < ∞,
Fubini’s theorem shows that the function h is (λ × µ)-integrable and that

K



K
h(z, w) dµ(z)

dw < ∞,
where the inner integral is ﬁnite for λ-almost every w in C.
Let ϕ ∈C1
00(C). In a similar way Fubini’s theorem shows that the function
(g/(z −w))∂ϕ(w) is µ-integrable for λ-almost every w in C and that

C



K
g(z)
z −w ∂ϕ(w) dµ(z)

C
∂ϕ(w)
z −w dw



K
g(z)ϕ(z) dµ(z) .
The last equality follows from the complex version of Green’s formula. By
Stone–Weierstrass, C1
00(C)|K is dense in C(K). Hence the last integral is non-
zero for some function ϕ as above.
In particular, on a set of positive Lebesgue measure the integral in condition
(ii) exists and is non-zero. Hence there are complex numbers w satisfying both
conditions.
✷
In the case where g = 1, the above proof shows that the Cauchy transform
µ(w) =

K
1
z −w dµ(z)
of µ exists λ-almost everywhere on C and is locally λ-integrable with
∂µ = −πµ
(in the distributional sense).
For µ as above and 1 ≤p < ∞, we denote by P p(µ) the closure of the set of
all polynomials in L p(µ).
Theorem17.1.3 (Brennan)
Let p > 2bearealnumberwith P p(µ) ̸= L p(µ).
Then there is a point w in C such that, for some positive constant c > 0,
| f (w)| ≤c∥f ∥p
( f ∈C[z]) .

Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
Proof
Choose g ∈Lq(µ) \ {0} with g⊥P p(µ), where q ∈(1, 2) is the con-
jugate exponent of p. By the previous lemma, there is a point w in C with
g/(z −w) ∈Lq(µ) and (gµ)(w) ̸= 0. But then from
0 =

K
f (z) −f (w)

K
f (z) g(z)
z −w dµ(z)
on C[z] extends to a continuous linear functional on P p(µ).
□
To prove the existence of an invariant subspace for S = Mz on P2(µ), where
we require that P2(µ) ̸= L2(µ), it sufﬁces to ﬁnd x, y ∈P2(µ) and w ∈C with
[p(S)x, y] = p(w)
for all polynomials p. Note that the hypothesis that P2(µ) ̸= L2(µ) implies
that we have P p(µ) ̸= L p(µ) for all p ≥2.
Proof of Theorem 17.1.1
Fix S and µ as above. Set p = 3 and q = 3/2.
According to Theorem 17.1.3, there is a point w in C such that
C[z] →C,
p →p(w) ,
extends to a continuous linear functional L on P p(µ). By Hahn–Banach, there is
afunction h in Lq(µ)with∥h∥q = ∥L∥suchthat h represents L on P p(µ).Since
P p(µ) is reﬂexive, there is a function r of norm 1 in P p(µ) with L(r) = ∥L∥.
Because we have equality in H¨older’s inequality
∥h∥q = ∥L∥= L(r) =

K
rh dµ ≤∥r∥p∥h∥q ,
there is a constant c > 0 (see Hewitt and Stromberg 1965, p. 190) with
|r|p = c3/2|h|q ,
or equivalently |r|2 = c|h| µ-almost everywhere.
Since u = h/r (= 0 where r = 0) belongs to L2(µ) and since
[p(S)r, u]L2(µ) =

Invariant subspaces for subnormal operators
169
for each polynomial p, it follows that
 
{p(S)r; p ∈C[z] with p(w) = 0} ∈Lat(S)
is non-trivial or w ∈σp(S).
✷
As a strengthening of the above result, we can prove (see Thomson 1986; or
Martin and Putinar 1989):
Theorem 17.1.4
Each rationally cyclic subnormal operator S on a Hilbert
space of dimension at least 2 has a non-trivial hyperinvariant subspace.
✷
It is not known whether or not each subnormal operator, which is not a
multiple of the identity has a non-trivial hyperinvariant subspace.
A point w as in Theorem 17.1.3 is called a bounded point evaluation for
P p(µ). More recently, it was shown by Thomson (1991) that Theorem 17.1.3
also holds in the case where p = 2.

is a positive measure µ ∈M(σ(S)) such that S is unitarily equivalent to Mz
on P2(µ) (= closure of C[z] in L2(µ)).
17.3 Additional notes
Using methods similar to the above, K. Yan (1988) proved that each subnormal
tuple, that is, each commuting tuple S = (S1, . . . , Sn) ∈B(H)n for which there
is a commuting tuple N = (N1, . . . , Nn) ∈B(K)n of normal operators on a
larger Hilbert space K ⊃H with Ni H ⊂H and Si = Ni|H, has a non-trivial
joint invariant subspace.
Let T ∈B(H) be arbitrary, and let M ≥1 be a constant. A compact set K
in C containing σ(T ) is called M-spectral for T if ∥r(T )∥≤M|r|K for each
rational function r with poles off K. For a subnormal operator S, its spectrum is
a spectral (= 1-spectral) set (Exercise 18.2.2). It was shown by Stampﬂi (1980)
that each operator T ∈B(H) for which the spectrum σ(T ) is an M-spectral set
possesses a non-trivial invariant subspace. Extensions of this result to the case
of operators on a Banach space are given in Prunaru (1996).

18
Invariant subspaces for subdecomposable
operators
18.1
Subnormal operators are examples of hyponormal operators. An operator
T ∈B(H) is hyponormal if ∥T ∗x∥≤∥T x∥for all x ∈H. The following gen-
eralization of Theorem 17.1.1 was obtained in Scott Brown (1987).
Theorem 18.1.1 (Brown)
Each hyponormal operator with thick spectrum has
a non-trivial invariant subspace.
□
Here a compact set K in C is called thick if there is a bounded open set V in
C such that K is dominating in V . If a compact set K in C is not thick, then
R(K) = C(K) (see Brown 1987). The uniform algebra R(K) is described in
Part I, Examples 1.2(v). In particular, each subnormal operator with non-thick
spectrum is normal (Exercise 18.2.3).
To prove the above theorem, Scott Brown used a result of Putinar showing
that each hyponormal operator is the restriction of an operator with a C∞(C)-
functional calculus (see Eschmeier and Putinar 1996, Chapter 6.4). Since oper-
ators of the latter type are decomposable, each hyponormal operator is sub-
decomposable, that is, it is the restriction of a decomposable operator. Therefore
the next result extends Theorem 18.1.1. For the deﬁnition and the theory of
decomposable operators, see Part IV.
Theorem 18.1.2 (Eschmeier and Prunaru)
Let S ∈B(X) be a subdecompos-
able operator on a complex Banach space X.
(i) If σ(S) is thick, then Lat(S) is non-trivial.
(ii) If σe(S) is thick, then Lat(S) is rich.
171

172
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
Here Lat(S) is called rich if it contains a sublattice which is isomorphic (as a
lattice) to the lattice of all closed linear subspaces of some inﬁnite-dimensional
Banach space.
One of the main difﬁculties in proving Theorem 18.1.2 is to extend the Scott
Brown technique to the Banach-space case. Below we indicate some of the main
ideas. First note that it sufﬁces to prove the second part. Indeed, if σ(S) ̸= σe(S)
and if dim(X) > 1, then Lat(S) is non-trivial.
To prove part (ii), it is enough to ﬁnd a complex number z and sequences
(x j) in X, (y j) in X′ such that
δ j,k p(z) = ⟨p(S)x j, yk⟩
for all natural numbers j, k and all polynomials p. In this case
M = !{p(S)x j; p ∈C[z] and j ∈N},
N = !{p(S)x j; p ∈C[z] with p(z) = 0 and j ∈N}
are invariant for S such that N ⊂M, (z −S)M ⊂N, and dim(M/N) = ∞. If
π : M →M/N is the quotient map, then
Lat(M/N) →Lat(S),
L →π−1(L),
deﬁnes a lattice embedding (Exercise 18.2.4).
Since S is subdecomposable, S′ is the quotient of a decomposable operator.
More precisely, there is a decomposable operator T ∈B(Z) on some Banach
space Z and a surjective, continuous linear map q : Z →X′ with qT = S′q.
Let σe(S) be dominating in V . For a given compact set K in C, we denote
by ZT (K) the local analytic subspace of the decomposable operator T ∈B(Z)
associated with K (see Chapter 22). The space
ZT (V ) =

{ZT (K); K ⊂V compact}
becomes an H(V )-module via
f z = f (T |ZT (K))z
whenever K ⊂V is a compact set with z ∈ZT (K). For x ∈X and z ∈ZT (V ),
the map
x ⊗z : H ∞(V ) →C,
f →⟨x, q( f z)⟩,
deﬁnes a weak-∗continuous linear functional.
The Scott Brown technique works best for the left essential spectrum. There-
fore the following observation is useful.

18
Invariant subspaces for subdecomposable operators
173
Lemma 18.1.3
Let S ∈B(X) be subdecomposable. Then
σe(S) = σre(S) = σℓe(S′) .
Proof
The second equality follows from standard duality theory (Exercise
18.2.5). If there were a point z in σe(S) \ σre(S), then
dim(X/(z −S)X) < ∞= dim ker(z −S) .
In this case S would not even possess the single-valued extension property
(see Finch 1975, proof of Corollary 11).
□
By Lemma 18.1.3, the left essential spectrum of S′ is dominating in V . Let
z ∈σℓe(S′). Then each closed ﬁnite-codimensional subspace M ⊂X′ contains
a sequence (yk) of unit vectors such that lim
k→∞(z −S′)yk = 0.
Question
If (yk) is as above, is there a sequence (zk) in Z with q(zk) = yk
and limk(z −T )zk = 0?
In Eschmeier and Prunaru (1990), essential use of a lifting property of the
above type for approximate eigensequences is made. However, simple examples
show that the answer to the above question is in general negative. For instance,
the bilateral shift
U : ℓ2(Z) →ℓ2(Z),
U((xk)k∈Z) = ((xk+1)k∈Z) ,
is a decomposable lifting of the backward shift
S : ℓ2 →ℓ2,
S((xk)k∈N) = ((xk+1)k∈N) .
Since σp(S) = D and σ(U) = T, there is no way to solve the above lifting
problem in this concrete case.
Fortunately it is possible to show that each operator that possesses a decom-
posable lifting at all has a canonical decomposable lifting which allows the
lifting of approximate eigensequences in the above sense (see Eschmeier and
Prunaru 1990, Proposition 1.4).
As in Chapter 16, deﬁne L as the set of all elements L in the quotient
space Q = L1(V )/⊥H ∞(V ) such that, for any given ﬁnitely many vectors
a1, . . . , as ∈X, b1, . . . , bs ∈ZT (V ) and any ε > 0, there are vectors x ∈X
and z ∈ZT (V ) with ∥x∥, ∥qz∥≤1 and
(i) ∥L −x ⊗z∥< ε ,
(ii) ∥x ⊗bi∥< ε, ∥ai ⊗z∥< ε
(i = 1, . . . , s) .

coefﬁcients in Q (see Eschmeier and Putinar 1996, Chapter 6.5) in the following
sense. For each matrix L = (L jk) ∈M(N, Q), we can prove the existence of
vectors xN in X N, zN in ZT (V )N (N ∈N) such that the limits
x( j) = lim

N→∞q zN( j) ∈X′
exist for each j ∈N and such that, for all j, k ∈N, we have
L jk = lim
N→∞xN( j) ⊗zN(k) .
Here xN( j) and zN(k) are the components of the N-tuples xN and zN. By
applying this result to the special case of a diagonal matrix of the special form
L = (δ j,kEλ) j,k∈N with λ in V arbitrary, one obtains the relations
δ j,k p(λ) = lim
N→∞⟨xN( j), q p(T )zN(k)⟩= ⟨p(S)x( j), y(k)⟩
for all polynomials p and all natural numbers j, k.
Since L is norm-closed, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a constant d > 0 such that, for
each absolutely convex combination L = r

points λ1, . . . , λr in σℓe(S′) ∩V , the factorization problems (i) and (ii) can
be solved with factors x ∈X and z ∈ZT (V ) bounded by ∥x∥, ∥qz∥≤d. A
straightforward decomposition into real and imaginary, positive and negative,
parts reduces the problem to the case of convex combinations. To indicate
a possible solution of the remaining problem we need two results from the
geometry of normed spaces.
Denote by F(X) the set of all ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of X and by

Exercise 18.1.6
Let I be an index set. For i ∈I, let Pi be a property that a unit
vector in X might have. Suppose that, for each i ∈I, each space N ∈Cof(X)
contains unit vectors with property Pi. Then, for each M in F(X) and each
ﬁnite set of indices i1, . . . , ir, there are unit vectors x1, . . . , xr such that xν has
property Piν and such that, with L = lin{x1, . . . , xr}, we have

combination r
i=1 µixi in the closed unit ball of X and a functional y on X
with norm less than 3 such that ⟨µixi, y⟩= ci for all i and such that y|M = 0.
Fix δ > 0. Let K ⊂V be compact. For λ in K, we say that a unit vector
y ∈X′ has property Pλ if there are z ∈Z and w ∈ZT (K) with
y = qz, ∥(λ −T )z∥< δ, ∥z −w∥< δ.
Since we are supposing that approximate eigensequences for S′ can be lifted and
since σ(T/ZT (K)) ∩int(K) = Ø, it follows that, for each λ in σℓe(S′) ∩int(K),
each space N ∈Cof(X′) contains unit vectors with property Pλ.
Hence, for λ1, . . . , λr in σℓe(S′) ∩int(K), M ∈F(X′) and c1, . . . , cr ≥0
adding up to 1, there are unit vectors y1, . . . , yr in X′ and associated vectors zi,

18.3 Additional notes
The ﬁrst applications of the Scott Brown technique to Banach-space operators
were given by Apostol (1981). Theorem 18.1.2 is from Eschmeier and Prunaru
(1990). Special cases of Theorem 18.1.2 for operators acting on quotients of
closed subspaces of ℓp (1 < p < ∞) have been obtained by Albrecht and
Chevreau (1987). A multivariable version of Theorem 18.1.2 is contained in
EschmeierandPutinar(1996).Usingdualitymethodsonecanproveananalogue
of Theorem 18.1.2 for quotients of decomposable operators (see Eschmeier
and Prunaru 1990, Theorem 2.1). Intrinsic characterizations of subdecompos-
able operators and of quotients of decomposable operators have been given
in Albrecht and Eschmeier (1997). For instance, a continuous linear operator
S ∈B(X) on a Banach space X is subdecomposable if and only if it satisﬁes
Bishop’s property (β), that is, all multiplication operators
H(U, X) →H(U, X),
f →(z −S) f
(U ⊂C open),
are continuous with closed range. For a discussion of property (β), see
Chapter 23. A proof of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 18.1.2 which does not make
use of canonical extensions and liftings was given more recently in Eschmeier
and Prunaru (2002).

19
Reﬂexivity of operator algebras
19.1
A subalgebra A ⊂B(H) is called reﬂexive if A = Alg Lat(A), where the space
on the right-hand side consists of all operatorsC ∈B(H) with Lat(A) ⊂Lat(C).
A single operator T ∈B(H), or more generally, an n-tuple T = (T1, . . . , Tn)
in B(H)n is called reﬂexive if the smallest WOT-closed subalgebra WT of B(H)
containing T1, . . . , Tn and the identity operator is reﬂexive. Equivalently, one
can ask that
Alg Lat(T ) = WT ,
where Alg Lat(T ) consists of all operators C ∈B(H) with Lat(T ) ⊂Lat(C).
Sarason proved in 1966 that each normal operator and each analytic Toeplitz
operator on H 2(T) is reﬂexive. In 1971 it was shown by Deddens that all
isometries are reﬂexive. Since all these operators are subnormal, the following
result of Olin and Thomson (1980) contains the above observations as special
cases.
Theorem 19.1.1 (Olin and Thomson)
Every subnormal operator is reﬂexive.
In the following we indicate some of the main steps leading to a proof of the
Olin and Thomson result. For simplicity, we shall restrict ourselves to the case
of pure subnormal operators.
Let S ∈B(H) be subnormal. It is easy to see that the set
V =

{U ⊂C bounded open; σ(S) is dominating in U}
is the largest bounded open set in C in which σ(S) is dominating. For a compact
set K in C, let R(K) and A(K) be as above and as in Chapter 1. As usual R(K)
178

19
Reﬂexivity of operator algebras
179
is called a Dirichlet algebra if
{Re( f |∂K); f ∈R(K)} ⊂CR(∂K)
is uniformly dense (see Conway 1991, Chapter V.14).
If V is empty, then one can show (Brown 1987) (this result is non-trivial!) that
R(σ(S)) = C(σ(S)). In this case, the operator S is normal (Exercise 18.2.3). If
the set V is non-empty, then it possesses very nice properties.
Theorem 19.1.2
Let σ ⊂C be compact. Suppose that the largest bounded
open set V in C in which σ(S) is dominating is non-empty. Then:
(i) ∂V = ∂V and V = int(V ) ⊂σ;
(ii) R(V ) is Dirichlet, R(V ) = A(V ) = A(V ), and the components of V are
simply connected;
(iii) R(V ) = A(V ) is pointwise boundedly dense in H ∞(V );
(iv) the polynomials are weak-∗dense in H ∞(V ).
□
A proof of Theorem 19.1.2 is given in the appendix to Part III.
In the following let S ∈B(H) be subnormal such that the largest bounded
open set V in C in which σ(S) is dominating is non-empty.
Lemma 19.1.3
If σ(S) is not contained in V , then S has a non-trivial normal
part.
Proof
Let D be a closed disc with D ∩V = Ø and centre λ ∈σ(S). Then
D ∩σ(S) is dominating in no open set anymore. Thus by the above remarks it
follows that R(D ∩σ(S)) = C(D ∩σ(S)). By a result of Clancey and Putnam
(1972), the operator S has a non-trivial normal part.
□
The results of Chapter 15 can be used to obtain an H ∞(V )-functional calculus
for pure subnormal operators.
Theorem 19.1.4
Let S ∈B(H) be a pure subnormal operator, and let V be
the largest bounded open set in C in which σ(S) is dominating. Then S has a
unique contractive weak-∗continuous functional calculus
 : H ∞(V ) →B(H) .
This functional calculus is isometric and of type C·0.

180
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
Proof The uniqueness follows from Theorem 19.1.2(iii).
Since σ(S) ⊂V , the subnormal operator S possesses a contractive functional
calculus over R(V ) = A(V ). By Corollary 15.1.8, this functional calculus is of
type C·0. By Theorem 19.1.2(iii) and the remarks following Theorem 15.1.7, it
extends to a contractive H ∞(V )-functional calculus of type C·0. To see that 
is isometric, note that
f (V ∩σ(S)) ⊂σ(( f ))
for each f ∈H ∞(V ). This spectral inclusion follows from the identity
(S −λ)
' f −f (λ)
z −λ
(
= ( f ) −f (λ) ,
which is valid for all f ∈H ∞(V ) and λ ∈V .
□
Since  is isometric and weak-∗continuous, its range is weak-∗closed. By
Theorem 19.1.2(iv), the range of  coincides with the smallest unital, weak-∗
closed subalgebra AS of B(H) containing S. Note that  : H ∞(V ) →AS is an
isometric isomorphism and a weak-∗homeomorphism if H ∞(V ) and AS are
regarded as the dual spaces of Q and C1(H)/⊥AS, respectively. In this situation,
 is called a dual algebra isomorphism.
Write V as the disjoint union of its connected components
V =

{Vk; 0 ≤k < N}
(N ∈Z+ ∪{∞}) .
Let ek ∈H ∞(V ) be the characteristic function of Vk. The operators Pk = (ek)
are orthogonal projections such that the spaces Hk = Pk H are pairwise orthog-
onal reducing subspaces for im() = AS. Furthermore,
SOT −

k
Pk = 1H .
For f ∈H ∞(Vk), let f be the trivial extension of f onto all of V . Then
k : H ∞(Vk) →B(Hk),
f →(f )|Hk ,
is an isometric weak-∗continuous functional calculus for Sk = S|Hk of type
C·0. Since the polynomials are weak-∗dense in H ∞(Vk), the algebra homomor-
phisms k : H ∞(Vk) →ASk are dual algebra isomorphisms again. Note that
AS = {C ∈B(H); Hk ∈Lat(C) and C|Hk ∈ASk for all k}
(Exercise 19.2.1). We abbreviate the space on the right by
)
0≤k<N
ASk.

19
Reﬂexivity of operator algebras
181
Fix k and a conformal map ϕ : Vk →D. The composition
(k) : H ∞(D) −→H ∞(Vk)
k
−→ASk,
where the ﬁrst map is given by substituting the argument by ϕ, is a dual algebra
isomorphism (of type C·0). A standard argument (Exercise 19.2.3) shows that
each operator in ASk is subnormal again. Hence (k) is an isometric weak-∗
continuous H ∞-functional calculus of the subnormal operator Tk = k(ϕ). In
particular, we have ATk = ASk.
Thus we have proved the following decomposition theorem.
Theorem 19.1.5 (Conway and Olin)
Let S be a pure subnormal operator.
Then there is an orthogonal decomposition H = )
0≤k<N Hk into countably
many reducing spaces for S such that, with Sk = S|Hk,
AS =

0≤k<N
ASk
and such that H ∞(D) ∼= ASk as dual algebras for all k.
✷
To prove that a pure subnormal operator is reﬂexive it therefore sufﬁces to
consider the following special case.
Theorem 19.1.6
Let T ∈B(H) be subnormal with a weak-∗continuous
isometric functional calculus  : H ∞(D) →B(H). Then T is reﬂexive and
Alg Lat(T ) = AT .
✷
Indeed, suppose that Theorem 19.1.6 holds and that C ∈Alg Lat(S) for some
pure subnormal operator S. Then, with the notations ﬁxed above,
C|Hk ∈Alg Lat(Sk) = Alg Lat(Tk) = ATk = ASk
for each k. Hence C ∈AS, and the reﬂexivity of S is proved.
Before we indicate some of the ideas leading to a proof of Theorem 19.1.6,
we consider an elementary, but typical, example.
Example 19.1.7
Let T = Mz on H = H 2(D). Since H is a Hilbert space of
analytic functions, it possesses a reproducing kernel. More precisely, there is a
conjugate analytic function k : D →H with
[ f, k(λ)] = f (λ)
( f ∈H, λ ∈D)

182
Part III
Invariant subspaces, J¨org Eschmeier
such that H is the closed linear span of all the kλ. It follows that
(λ −T )∗k(λ) ≡0 .
If C ∈Alg Lat(T ), then C∗∈Alg Lat(T ∗) acts on the eigenspaces of T ∗as a
scalar multiple of the identity (Exercise 19.2.4). Hence C∗k(λ) = g(λ)k(λ) for
λ ∈D with a bounded function g. Since
[C f, k(λ)] = g(λ)[ f, k(λ)] = (g f )(λ) ,
we conclude that C = (g) ∈AT , where  is the H ∞-functional calculus of T .
The above example motivates us to give the next deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 19.1.8
Let T ∈B(H). A space M ∈Lat(T ) is an analytic (or D-
analytic) invariant subspace for T if there is a non-zero conjugate analytic
function k : D →M with (λ −T |M)∗k(λ) ≡0.
In the situation of Theorem 19.1.6 one cannot expect the whole space H to
be an analytic invariant subspace for T (as in Example 19.1.7). Nevertheless
the proof of Theorem 19.1.6 depends on the observation that there is a dense
set of vectors x in H such that the spaces
Mx =
 
{T kx; k ≥0}
are analytic invariant subspaces for T . As before, for x, y ∈H, regard
x ⊗y : H ∞(D) →C,
x ⊗y( f ) = [( f )x, y] ,
as an element in the predual Q of H ∞(D). For k ∈Z+, deﬁne functionals E(k)
in Q by
⟨E(k), f ⟩= f (k)(0)/k!
( f ∈H ∞(D)) .
Suppose that x, yk are vectors in H such that x ⊗yk = E(k) for all k ∈Z+ and
such that k(λ) = 
j y jλ
j converges on D. Then Eλ = x ⊗k(λ) for λ ∈D, and
the function
D →Mx,
λ →PMxk(λ) ,
turns Mx into an analytic invariant subspace for T .
Thus to prove that there is a dense set of vectors x generating an analytic
invariant subspace for T , it sufﬁces to prove the second part of the next result.

19
Reﬂexivity of operator algebras
183
Theorem 19.1.9
Let T be as in Theorem 19.1.6.
(i) There is a constant r > 0 such that, for each L ∈Q and any given vectors
a, b ∈H, there are x, y ∈H with L = x ⊗y and
∥x −a∥≤r∥L −a ⊗b∥1/2,
∥y∥≤r(∥L −a ⊗b∥1/2 + ∥b∥) .
(ii) For each ε > 0, there is a constant c = c(ε) > 0 such that, for each se-
quence (Lk)k≥1 in Q and each vector a ∈H, there are vectors x, yk ∈H
with ∥x −a∥< ε and such that, for all k ∈N,
Lk = x ⊗yk,
∥yk∥≤ck12∥Lk∥.
✷
For a proof of Theorem 19.1.9 that even works in the multivariable case (for
subnormal n-tuples with isometric H ∞-functional calculus over the Euclidean
unit ball in Cn), the reader is referred to Eschmeier (1999, Theorem 1.10 and
Theorem 2.3).
Let Mx be an analytic invariant subspace for T via a conjugate analytic
function k : D →Mx. Then, as in Example 19.1.7, it follows (Exercise 19.2.5)
that, for each operator C ∈Alg Lat(T ), there is a function g = gC,x in H ∞(D)
with
(C|Mx)∗k(λ) = g(λ)k(λ)
for λ ∈D. Since by Theorem 19.1.9 the set
C = {x ∈H; Mx is a D–analytic invariant subspace for T }
is dense in H, to complete the proof of Theorem 19.1.6, it sufﬁces to show
that, for each operator C ∈Alg Lat(T ) and each vector x ∈C, we have
(gC,x)|Mx = C|Mx
and that all the functions gC,x (x ∈C) coincide.
For a complete proof of Theorem 19.1.6 along these lines, we refer the reader
to Section 3 in Eschmeier (1999, Theorem 3.6 and Theorem 3.7).

Invariant subspaces for commuting contractions
20.1
A tuple T = (T1, . . . , Tn) ∈B(H)n of commuting bounded operators on a
Hilbert space H is called a spherical contraction if n
i=1 T ∗
i Ti ≤1. We know
from Chapter 16 that a contraction T ∈B(H) with dominating spectrum in the
open unit disc has non-trivial invariant subspaces. Therefore it seems natural
to ask whether, for every spherical contraction T ∈B(H)n with dominating
joint spectrum in the open Euclidean unit ball B = {z ∈Cn; |z| < 1}, the joint
invariant subspace lattice of T
Lat(T ) =
n
i=1
Lat(Ti)
contains non-trivial spaces.
In Chapter 14, we used the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem to prove von
Neumann’s inequality for contractions T ∈B(H). Since the polynomials are
uniformly dense in the ball algebra A(B) = { f ∈C(B); f |B is analytic}, von
Neumann’s inequality on the unit ball, that is, the inequality
∥p(T )∥≤|p|B
(p ∈C[z1, . . . , zn]) ,
is equivalent to the existence of a contractive ball algebra functional calculus for
T . However, it is well known (see Drury 1978; or Arveson 1998) that, for each
n > 1, there are spherical contractions T ∈B(H)n for which the polynomial
functional calculus is unbounded, that is, for which
sup{∥p(T )∥; p ∈C[z1, . . . , zn] with |p|B ≤1} = ∞.
Our aim in the following is to indicate that some of the invariant-subspace
results valid for contractions with rich spectrum in the unit disc possess

Invariant subspaces for commuting contractions

multivariable analogues, at least for spherical contractions that admit normal
boundary dilations.
Deﬁnition 20.1.1
Let n ∈N, let H be a Hilbert space, and let T ∈B(H)n be
a commuting tuple.
(i) A spherical unitary on H is a commuting tuple U ∈B(H)n of normal
operators such that n
i=1 U ∗
i Ui = 1.
(ii) A spherical dilation of T is a spherical unitary U ∈B(K)n on a larger
Hilbert space K containing H such that
T k = P U k|H
(k ∈(Z+)n) ,
where P istheorthogonalprojectionfrom K onto H and T k = T k1
1 · · · T kn
n .
(iii) A spherical dilation U ∈B(K)n of T is minimal if the only reducing
subspace for U containing H is the space K itself.
A commuting tuple T = (T1, . . . , Tn) ∈B(H)n is called a spherical isometry
if n
i=1 T ∗
i Ti = 1. Let T ∈B(H)n be a spherical contraction with a spherical
dilation U ∈B(K)n. By the spectral theorem for commuting normal operators,
the polynomial functional calculus of U extends to a unique C∗-algebra ho-
momorphism π : C(∂B) →B(K). Thus T satisﬁes von Neumann’s inequality
and possesses a contractive ball algebra functional calculus & : A(B) →B(H).
We call &, or also T , absolutely continuous if & extends to a weak-∗contin-
uous algebra homomorphism  : H ∞(B) →B(H). If one wants to show that
T has non-trivial joint invariant subspaces, then one may suppose that T is
completely non-unitary, that is, possesses no non-zero reducing subspace M
such that T |M is a spherical unitary. In this case, T is absolutely continuous.
Indeed, the following decomposition theorem can be proved.
Theorem 20.1.2
Let & : A(B) →B(H) be a contractive algebra homomor-
phism. Then there are contractive algebra homomorphisms
&a, &s : A(B) →B(H)
with & = &a + &s such that &a is absolutely continuous, &s extends to a
C∗-algebra homomorphism s : C(∂B) →B(H), and
&a( f )&s(g) = 0 = &s(g)&a( f )
( f, g ∈A(B)) .
□
This theorem can be proved in the same way as Theorem 14.1.12. It sufﬁces
to replace the Lebesgue decomposition theorem and the F. and M. Riesz
theorem by suitable multivariable generalizations. To be more precise, let
M(∂B) be the space of all regular, complex Borel measures on ∂B. Denote

by M0 its weak-∗compact, convex subset consisting of all probability mea-
sures ρ ∈M(∂B) with
f (0) =

∂B
f dρ
( f ∈A(B)) .
Deﬁnition 20.1.3
Let µ ∈M(∂B). Then µ is called absolutely continuous if
µ ≪ρ for some measure ρ ∈M0. The measure µ is called singular if it is
concentrated on an Fσ-set N ⊂∂B with ρ(N) = 0 for all ρ ∈M0.
By the Glicksberg–K¨onig–Seever decomposition theorem (for example, see
Rudin 1980, Theorem 9.4.4), every measure µ ∈M(∂B) has a unique decom-
position µ = µa + µs into an absolutely continuous part µa and a singular part
µs. By Henkin’s theorem (Exercise 20.2.1) and the Cole–Range theorem (see
Rudin 1980, Theorem 9.6.1), a measure µ ∈M(∂B) is absolutely continuous if
and only if it is a Henkin measure in the sense that, for every Montel sequence
( fk) in A(B), we have
lim
k→∞

fk dµ = 0 .
Since every measure µ ∈A(B)⊥is obviously a Henkin measure, we obtain
in particular that the only singular measure µ ∈A(B)⊥is the trivial measure
µ = 0. Now, to prove Theorem 20.1.2, it sufﬁces to apply the Glicksberg–
K¨onig–Seever theorem to an arbitrary family of representing measures of &,
and then to argue exactly as in the one-variable case.
As a useful byproduct of the above proof of Theorem 20.1.2, one obtains:
Corollary 20.1.4
Let U ∈B(K)n be a minimal spherical dilation of a spher-
ical contraction T ∈B(H)n. If T is absolutely continuous, then so is U.
□
Let T ∈B(H)n be a commuting tuple with a continuous ball algebra func-
tional calculus & : A(B) →B(H). We say that T , or also &, is of type C0· if
&( fk)
SOT
−→0 for each Montel sequence ( fk) in A(B). We say that T , or &, is
of type C·0 if & : A(B) →B(H) deﬁned by
&( f ) = &(f )∗
(f (z) = f (z))
is of type C0·. Exactly as in the one-variable case, it is possible to prove that T
has always non-trivial invariant subspaces if T is neither C0. nor C·0. A proof
can be based on the ball analogue of Theorem 15.1.3.

Invariant subspaces for commuting contractions
189
Theorem 20.1.5
For each function g ∈C(B), the operator
Sg : A(B) →C(B)/A(B),
f →[g f ] ,
is compact.
□
Theorem 20.1.5 follows from well-known compactness properties of suit-
able Hankel-type operators (see Rudin 1980, Theorem 6.5.4). A proof valid in
more general situations can be found in Didas (2002; see also Cole and Gamelin
1982). A commuting tuple S ∈B(H)n is called subnormal if there is a commut-
ing tuple N ∈B(K)n of normal operators on a Hilbert space K ⊃H such that
H ∈Lat(N) and S = N|H. Exactly as in the one-variable case (Chapter 15),
one can use Theorem 20.1.5 to prove the following corollaries.
Corollary 20.1.6
Let & : A(B) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomor-
phism. Then & is not of type C·0 if and only if there is a non-zero bounded linear
map j : C(∂B) →H with &( f ) j = j M( f |∂B) for all f ∈A(B).
□
Corollary 20.1.7
Let & : A(B) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomor-
phism, and let T = (&(z1), . . . , &(zn)). If T is neither of type C0· nor of
type C·0, then either all components of T are scalar multiples of the identity
operator, or the hyperinvariant subspace lattice Hyp(T ) = Lat((T )′) of T is
non-trivial.
□
Corollary 20.1.8
Let S ∈B(H)n be a subnormal tuple that possesses a con-
tinuous A(B)-functional calculus. Then S is completely non-unitary if and only
if S is of type C·0.
□
Using the above results, it is possible to prove an invariant-subspace result
for spherical contractions that contains the corresponding one-variable result of
Brown, Chevreau, and Pearcy (Theorem 16.1.2) as a special case. To formulate
it, we need a suitable notion of joint spectrum. Let T ∈B(H)n be a commuting
tuple on H. The Harte spectrum σ H(T ) of T consists of those points λ ∈Cn
for which the map
H →H n,
x →((λi −Ti)x)n
i=1,
is not bounded below or for which the map

is not surjective. The Harte spectrum is a compact subset of Cn which, for
n = 1, reduces to the usual spectrum of an operator T ∈B(H). For this and
more results on joint spectra, see Eschmeier and Putinar (1996).
Theorem 20.1.9
Let T ∈B(H)n be a commuting tuple that possesses a spher-
ical dilation. Suppose that the Harte spectrum σ H(T ) of T is dominating in B.
Then T has non-trivial joint invariant subspaces.
□
Here a set σ ⊂Cn is, of course, called dominating in B if | f |B = | f |B∩σ for
all f ∈H ∞(B). The results preceding Theorem 20.1.9 can be used to reduce the
assertion to the case where T possesses a weak-∗continuous H ∞(B)-functional
calculus of type C·0. Then an application of the Scott Brown factorization tech-
niqueleadstoaproofofTheorem20.1.9.Anadditionalcomplicationarisesfrom
the fact that one is not allowed to assume that the Harte spectrum of T coincides
with the left essential spectrum of T , as we did in the one-dimensional case.
To overcome this difﬁculty, it can be shown that, in the above situation, the
tuple T has an absolutely continuous co-isometric extension, that is, there is
an absolutely continuous spherical isometry V ∈B(K)n on a Hilbert space K
containing H such that H ∈Lat(V ∗) and T = V ∗|H. The tuple V has a Wold-
typedecomposition V = S ⊕R∗intoacompletelynon-unitarysubnormaltuple
S and a spherical unitary R∗. By Corollary 20.1.8, the adjoint S∗is of type C0·,
and T istherestrictionof S∗⊕R.NowastandardapplicationoftheScottBrown
factorization technique, using the C·0-property of T and the C0·-property of S∗,
allows one to complete the proof of Theorem 20.1.9. For details, we refer the
reader to Eschmeier (1997).
An extension of the methods explained in Chapter 19 was used in Eschmeier
(1999) to prove a reﬂexivity result for algebras of subnormal operators on the
unit ball which extends Theorem 19.1.6.
Theorem 20.1.10
Let T ∈B(H)n be subnormal spherical contraction with
a weak-∗continuous isometric functional calculus  : H ∞(B) →B(H). Then
T is reﬂexive and Alg Lat(T ) = AT .
□
It is an open question whether the invariant-subspace result formulated in
Theorem 20.1.9 remains true when the Harte spectrum σ H(T ) is replaced by the
Taylor spectrum of T . The Taylor spectrum always contains the Harte spectrum,
and it is, in many respects, the more natural joint spectrum (see Eschmeier and
Putinar 1996). The answer to this question is positive in dimension n = 2 (see
Didas 2002).

20.2 Exercises
1. Use Theorem 20.1.5 and the ball analogue of Corollary 15.1.4 to prove that,
if µ ∈M(∂B) is a Henkin measure, then every measure ν ∈M(∂B) with
ν ≪µ is a Henkin measure. This result is usually referred to as Henkin’s
theorem.
2. Complete the proof of Theorem 20.1.2 as outlined in this chapter.
3. Let & : A(B) →B(H) be a contractive algebra homomorphism. Show that
there is at most one pair (&1, &2) consisting of contractive algebra homo-
morphisms &i : A(B) →B(H) with & = &1 + &2 such that &1 has a rep-
resenting family of measures that are absolutely continuous, and &2 has a
representing family of measures that are singular on ∂B.
4. Let & : A(B) →B(H) be a continuous algebra homomorphism. Show that
there is an extension of & to a weak-∗continuous algebra homomorphism
 : H ∞(B) →B(H) if and only if & has a representing family of measures
on ∂B that are absolutely continuous, or equivalently, if each representing
family of measures for & on ∂B consists of absolutely continuous measures.
5. Use Rudin (1980, Theorem 6.5.4) to prove Theorem 20.1.5.
6. Let T ∈B(H)n be a spherical contraction. Show that there is a unique or-
thogonal decomposition H = H0 ⊕H1 with reducing subspaces H0, H1 for
T such that T |H0 is completely non-unitary and T |H1 is a spherical unitary.
20.3 Additional notes
Henkin’s theorem and the Cole–Range theorem imply that on ∂B the set of
all Henkin measures coincides with the band of measures generated by the
set M0 of all measures that represent the point evaluation at 0 on A(B). Al-
though Henkin’s theorem fails on the unit polydisc Dn, one can still show (see
Eschmeier 2001a) that the band of measures generated by the set M0(Tn) of
all measures on Tn that represent the point evaluation at 0 on A(Dn) is the
largest band in M(Tn) consisting entirely of Henkin measures. This result is
used in Eschmeier (2001a, 2001b) to show that Theorem 20.1.9 remains true
if the open unit ball is replaced by the open unit polydisc, and to prove an
analogue of Theorem 20.1.10 on Dn. Since by Ando’s dilation theorem every
pair T = (T1, T2) of commuting contractions has a dilation to a commuting
pair U = (U1, U2) of unitary operators, we obtain in particular that every pair
T = (T1, T2) of commuting contractions with dominating Harte spectrum in
D2 has a non-trivial joint invariant subspace. It is an open question whether
the Harte spectrum can be replaced by the Taylor spectrum in this result. This
question has a positive answer, even in arbitrary dimension n, if the tuple T is

192

supposed to consist of doubly commuting contractions (see Albrecht and Ptak
1998).
Theorem 20.1.10 remains true if the condition that T possesses an isometric
weak-∗continuous H ∞(B)-functional calculus is replaced by the hypothesis
that the Taylor spectrum of T is dominating in B (see Eschmeier 1999). Reﬂex-
ivity results for spherical contractions that extend the above mentioned results
for subnormal spherical contractions can be found in Eschmeier (2001c). In
Didas (2002), many of the above results are shown to hold for commuting tu-
ples T ∈B(H)n which possess an isometric, weak-∗continuous H ∞-functional
calculus  : H ∞(D) →B(H) and a normal boundary dilation over a strictly
pseudoconvex domain D in Cn, or more generally, a strictly pseudoconvex open
set D in a Stein submanifold X of Cn. In particular, every subnormal n-tuple
with dominating Taylor spectrum in D, or with isometric weak-∗continuous
H ∞(D)-functional calculus, is shown to be reﬂexive.
By a result of Bercovici (1994) at least each commuting family of isometries
on a Hilbert space is reﬂexive. Azoff and Ptak (1995) extended this result to the
case of jointly quasinormal tuples. The question whether each spherical isome-
try is reﬂexive seems still to be open. Some partial results have been obtained in
M¨uller and Ptak (1999) and Eschmeier (2001c). The general question, whether
every subnormal tuple S ∈B(H)n on a Hilbert space is reﬂexive, is one of the
major open questions in this area at the time of this writing.

Appendix to Part III
It is the purpose of this appendix to indicate a possible proof of Theorem 19.1.2.
For each open set U in C, we denote by P∞(U) the weak-∗closure of
the polynomials in L∞(U) ∼= L1(U)′, where L1(U) and L∞(U) are formed
with respect to the planar Lebesgue measure. Then P∞(U) is a weak-∗closed
subalgebra of H ∞(U).
Let σ be a compact set in C. We say that σ is dominating for P∞(U) if
| f |U = | f |U∩σ
( f ∈P∞(U)) .
Let us assume that σ is dominating for P∞(U) for some non-empty, bounded
open set U in C. Then
V =

{U; U ⊂C is bounded and open, and σ is dominating for P∞(U)}
is the largest bounded open set such that σ is dominating for P∞(V ).
Deﬁne K = σ(Mz, P∞(V )). If λ ̸∈K, then 1/(λ −z) ∈P∞(V ). In par-
ticular, V ⊂int(K) and R(K)|V ⊂P∞(V ). A standard result in rational ap-
proximation theory (cf. the proof of Theorem 3 in Brown (1987)) shows that
there is a family (Li)i∈I of bounded components of C \ K such that the set
C = K ∪{Li; i ∈I} has the following properties:
(i) K is dominating in int(C) (i.e., for H ∞(int(C))),
(ii) R(C) is a Dirichlet algebra.
By Conway (1991, Theorem VI.4.8) the algebra R(C) is pointwise bound-
edly dense in H ∞(int(C)). Hence H ∞(int(C))|V ⊂P∞(V ). We claim that the
restriction map
H ∞(int(C)) →P∞(V ),
f →f |V ,
193

194
Part III

is isometric. Otherwise, |g|int(C) > |g|V for some g ∈H ∞(int(C)), and there
would be a point a ∈int(C) ∩K with |g(a)| > |g|V . But then a ̸∈V and be-
cause of the fact that
|(z −a) f |V ≥dist(a, V )| f |V
( f ∈P∞(V ))
the proper ideal (z −a)P∞(V ) ⊂P∞(V ) is weak-∗closed. By the Hahn–
Banach theorem this ideal is annihilated by some weak-∗continuous linear
functional ρ : P∞(V ) →C with ρ(1) = 1. Since on polynomials ρ acts as the
point evaluation at a, the functional ρ is multiplicative (cf. Exercise 14.2.3). By
the cited result in Conway (1991), there is a sequence (rn) of rational functions
with no poles on C which is uniformly bounded on C and converges to g
pointwise on int(C). We obtain the contradiction
|g(a)| = | lim
n rn(a)| = | lim
n ρ(rn|V )| = |ρ(g|V )| ≤|g|V .
The observation that
| f |int(C) = | f |V = | f |V ∩σ ≤| f |int(C)∩σ
for all f ∈H ∞(int(C)) shows that σ is dominating in int(C). The maximality
of V implies that V = int(C). It follows that
K = C,
H ∞(V ) = P∞(V ) ,
and that V coincides with the largest bounded open set in C such that σ is
dominating in V for H ∞(V ).
Using for a third time Conway (1991, Theorem VI.4.8), we see that R(V ) is
pointwise boundedly dense in H ∞(V ). Using the fact that ∂V ⊂∂V ⊂∂K and
that R(K) is a Dirichlet algebra, we can easily deduce that R(V ) is a Dirichlet
algebra. By Gamelin (1969, Corollary II.9.3), we have R(V ) = A(V ) = A(V ).
The last equality follows because V = int(V ), or equivalently, ∂V = ∂V . Since
R(V )isaDirichletalgebra,theconnectedcomponentsof V = int(V )aresimply
connected (see Conway 1991, Theorem VI.5.2).
To see that V is contained in the polynomially convex hull σ of σ (see
Deﬁnition 4.1.1) it sufﬁces to observe that, for each point z ∈V and each
polynomial p, we have
|p(z)| ≤|p|V = |p|V ∩σ ≤|p|σ .
Thus the proof of Theorem 19.1.2 is complete.

Basic notions from operator theory
21.1 Introduction
This part of the book is intended as an invitation to the subject of local spectral
theory. It contains the basics and some indications of the way the subject has
developed. I would like to thank Garth Dales and Michael Neumann for their
numerous good comments and suggestions. The entire story of the fascinating
subject that Chapters 21–25 deal with may be found in Laursen and Neumann
(2000), and I hope that after having been through these chapters you will want
to go for more in that book, which also contains a full bibliography.
The phrase local spectral theory carries many connotations. Among the ones
that are appropriate here you should expect to ﬁnd concepts such as spectral
subspaces, that is, invariant subspaces on which the restricted operator has
a spectrum consisting of a chunk of the original spectrum. The archetypal con-
ceptual framework is provided by the spectral theorem for normal operators
on a Hilbert space, which speciﬁes how this decomposition of the underly-
ing space and of the spectrum is supposed to look. Another similar exam-
ple is provided by the spectral theorem for compact operators on a Banach
space.
Both of these examples may be traced back to what is often a high point
of a ﬁrst course in linear algebra, namely a result on diagonalizing symmetric
matrices such as the following. (A symmetric matrix [ai j] satisﬁes the relations
ai j = a ji for all i, j, while for a symmetric operator T on a ﬁnite-dimensional,
real inner-product space V with inner product [·, ·], it is true that we have
[T x, y] = [x, T y] for all x, y ∈V .)

Theorem 21.1.1
A linear operator T : V →V, where V is a ﬁnite-
dimensional real inner-product space, is symmetric if and only if V has an
orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors for T.
□
For a Hilbert space this may be turned into the spectral theorem for normal
operators. To appreciate this from our chosen vantage point we need to know
what a spectral measure is. An operator N ∈B(H) is normal when it satisﬁes
N N ∗= N ∗N and self-adjoint when N = N ∗. Here T ∗is the adjoint of the
operator T ∈B(H) deﬁned by the formula
[x, T ∗y] = [T x, y]
for all x, y ∈H ,
as in §3.5.
Deﬁnition 21.1.2
Let B denote the collection of Borel subsets of C, and let
H be a Hilbert space. Then a spectral measure E is a map from B to the set
of projections on H (i.e. all self-adjoint idempotents in B(H)) which has these
properties:
r E(∅) = 0, E(C) = IH, the identity operator on H;
r E(B1 ∩B2) = E(B1)E(B2) for all Borel sets B1, B2;
r if {B j}∞
j=1 is a sequence of pairwise disjoint Borel sets, then
E
'∞
j=1B j
(
h = ∞
j=1E(B j)h ,
for every element h ∈H, the sum converging in the Hilbert space norm (the
terms are pairwise orthogonal).
Of course, in the statement to follow, the proper interpretation of the integral
needs attention; we shall not dwell on it, because this point will not be needed
elsewhere. The spectrum of an operator is deﬁned in Part I, §2.1.
Theorem 21.1.3
Let N be a normal operator on the Hilbert space H. Then
there is a unique spectral measure E on the Borel subsets of the spectrum σ(N)
of N for which
N =

z dE(z) .
Moreover, for every Borel set  ⊆C the subspace E()H is N-invariant and
σ(N|E()H) ⊆ ∩σ(N).

Basic notions from operator theory

It is in this light that the modern deﬁnition of a decomposable operator should
be viewed.
Throughout these Chapters 21–25, we shall be considering complex Banach
spaces (as well as Banach algebras), and it will be assumed that, unless some-
thing else is explicitly stipulated, the term X refers to a complex Banach space,
and the term A refers to a commutative complex Banach algebra.
Deﬁnition 21.1.4
A bounded linear operator T : X →X is decomposable if,
for every open cover {U, V } of C, there are closed T -invariant subspaces Y, Z
of X for which:
r X = Y + Z;
r σ(T |Y) ⊆U and σ(T |Z) ⊆V.
Chapter 22 will look at examples in more detail (but it is an easy consequence
of Theorem 21.1.3 that normal operators are decomposable – see Exercise
21.3.1). Here we shall concentrate on introducing the basic concepts.
If U ⊆C is open, then H(U) denotes the algebra (pointwise operations) of
analytic functions deﬁned on U. We give this algebra the topology of locally
uniform convergence, that is, of uniform convergence on all compact subsets of
U. It may be shown that this topology is locally convex and that it is induced by
a complete and translation-invariant metric; thus H(U) is a Fr´echet algebra (see
Part I, Examples 1.2 (x)). Among the elements of H(U) we ﬁnd the constant
function 1 and the identity function Z.
The analytic functional calculus is deﬁned in Chapter 4. We recall it this
way: if T ∈B(X) has spectrum σ(T ) and U is an open neighbourhood of σ(T )
on which the analytic function f is deﬁned, then the map
 : f →f (T ) :=
1
2πi


f (λ)(λ −T )−1 dλ
(where  is a contour in U surrounding σ(T ), as explained in Chapter 4) is an
algebra homomorphism from the Fr´echet algebra H(U) into B(X) for which
(1) = IX and (Z) = T.
There are connections between functional calculi and decomposability, al-
though in the case of the analytic functional calculus this connection is limited
to the situations in which the spectrum is disconnected. To display an extreme
case: this calculus may be used to show that, if σ(T ) is totally disconnected,
then T is decomposable (Exercise 21.3.2). (Recall from general topology that
a topological space is said to be totally disconnected if none of its connected
subsets contains more than one point.) The reason the argument goes through is

204
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
that a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space has a base for its topology
consisting of clopen sets, as shown, for instance, in Appendix A.7 of Rudin
(1991). For more on totally disconnected spaces, see Engelking (1977).
A class that displays a better connection is that of the generalized scalar
operators. To explain: look at the algebra C∞(C) of complex-valued functions
that have continuous partial derivatives of all orders with respect to the variables
x and y (as usual for a complex number z, we write z = x + iy, where x and
y are real). This algebra may be equipped with the topology determined by the
seminorms
∥f ∥k,Q :=

|α|≤k
1
α! sup {|D α f (λ)| : λ ∈Q}
for all f ∈C ∞(C) ,
where Q ranges over all compact subsets of C, k over Z+, and α = (α1, α2) is
an arbitrary double index of integers which speciﬁes the order of differentiation:
D α f (λ) = ∂α1
x ∂α2
y f (λ) ,
|α| := α1 + α2, and α! := α1!α2!; the factors 1/α! are there to ensure submul-
tiplicativity of the seminorm ∥· ∥k,Q. With the topology of this countable family
of seminorms, C∞(C) is a Fr´echet algebra. Obviously the set H(C) of entire
functions is a subalgebra of C∞(C).
Deﬁnition 21.1.5
Let T ∈B(X) be given. If there is a continuous algebra
homomorphism  from C∞(C) into B(X) for which (1) = I and (Z) = T ,
then T is a generalized scalar operator.
Note that the homomorphism of this deﬁnition will necessarily be an exten-
sion from H(C) of the homomorphism that appears in the analytic functional
calculus.
A generalized scalar operator is decomposable. This is a consequence of the
fact that in C∞(C) we have partitions of unity (cf. Exercise 21.3.3).
21.2 The properties (β) and (δ)
The main goal for the rest of this chapter is to introduce two seemingly merely
technical conditions, and to relate them to decomposability. Our aim is Theorem
21.2.8, which shows that these two conditions together are equivalent to de-
composability. It will become clear in the course of the next few chapters that
both conditions have some truly astounding relations, which go well beyond

21
Basic notions from operator theory
205
this ﬁrst result. Both properties (which are called properties (β) and (δ)) go
back to Errett Bishop’s PhD thesis (1959).
Deﬁnition 21.2.1
An operator T ∈B(X) has property (β) (or just: T has (β))
if, for every open subset U of C and every sequence ( fn) of analytic functions
fn : U →X with the property that (T −λ) fn(λ) →0 as n →∞, locally uni-
formly on U, it follows that fn(λ) →0 as n →∞, also locally uniformly on U.
This property may be conveniently rephrased in terms of an operator TU, de-
ﬁned on the Fr´echet space H(U, X) of X-valued analytic functions, topologized
by locally uniform convergence on U. This operator is speciﬁed by
(TU f )(λ) := (T −λ) f (λ)
for every λ ∈U .
It may then be shown that an operator T has (β) if and only if TU is injective
and has closed range, for every open set U in C (Exercise 21.3.4).
Incidentally, this last observation is also a possible lead-in to the notion of
the single-valued extension property SVEP, which is as follows.
Deﬁnition 21.2.2
An operator T ∈B(X) has SVEP if, for every open subset
U of C, the equation (T −λ) f (λ) = 0 has only one analytic solution, namely
f = 0.
Thus T has SVEP if and only if TU is injective for every open U. It is clear
that (β) implies SVEP. The converse is not true, although you may have to think
hard to come up with a counter-example (Exercise 21.3.5). We shall display
some later. For more on SVEP, see Part V, Chapter 27.
To introduce property (δ) we need the glocal subspaces.
Deﬁnition 21.2.3
Let T ∈B(X) be given and suppose that F ⊆C is closed.
Then the glocal spectral subspace is
XT (F) := {x ∈X :
there is an analytic function f : C \ F →X
for which (T −λ) f (λ) = x for all λ ∈C \ F}.
In other, and more formal, terms,
XT (F) = {x ∈X : x ∈TC\F H(C \ F, X)}.
On the resolvent set ρ(T ) we obviously have that every x ∈X may be written
as x = (T −λ)(T −λ)−1x for every λ ∈ρ(T ), which shows immediately that
X = XT (σ(T )). Also, it is an easy consequence of Liouville’s theorem that
XT (∅) = {0} (Exercise 21.3.6).

206
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
Deﬁnition 21.2.4
An operator T ∈B(X) has property (δ) (or just (δ)) if
X = XT (U) + XT (V )
for every open cover {U, V } of C.
If T : X →Y is a continuous linear operator between the Banach spaces X
and Y, then T induces a linear map T ♮: H(U, X) →H(U, Y), deﬁned by the
composition
(T ♮f )(λ) := T f (λ)
for all λ ∈U and f ∈H(U, X) .
You may want to convince yourself that T ♮is continuous; this is not hard
(Exercise 21.3.7).
Here we shall need this map only for open discs. We use D(a; b) to denote
the closed disc in C centred at a and of radius b, and D(a; b) to denote the
corresponding open disc. The open unit disc is called just D. If U = D(λ 0;r),
then every f ∈H(U, X) is given by a power series
f (λ) =
∞

n=0
an(λ −λ 0)n
for all λ ∈U ,
where the coefﬁcients an are elements of X. Since the convergence of this series
is locally uniform, the continuity of T ♮implies that
(T ♮f )(λ) =
∞

n=0
T (an)(λ −λ 0)n
for all λ ∈U .
We shall need the fact that surjectivity is transferred from T to T ♮.
Proposition 21.2.5
Let T : X →Y be a continuous linear surjection from the
Banach space X onto the Banach space Y. Then, for every open disc U ⊆C,
the induced map T ♮: H(U, X) →H(U, Y) is a continuous and open linear
surjection.
Proof Let U = D(λ 0;r), where λ 0 ∈C and r > 0. Then, for every function
g in H(U, Y), we have a power series expansion g(λ) =  ∞
n=0 bn(λ −λ 0)n,
valid for every λ ∈U. The radius of convergence of this power series is at leastr.
The open mapping theorem tells us there is a constant c > 0 for which, for
every y ∈Y, there is an x ∈X such that T x = y and ∥x∥≤c ∥y∥. So, for every
n ∈N, we may choose an element an ∈X so that Tan = bn and ∥an∥≤c ∥bn∥.
The estimates

∥an∥1/n ≤lim sup

tell us that the power series f (λ) :=  ∞
n=0 an(λ −λ 0)n converges for all λ in
the disc U, hence deﬁnes a function f ∈H(U, X). Since
(T ♮f )(λ) =
∞

n=0
T (an)(λ −λ 0)n =


n=0
bn(λ −λ 0)n = g(λ)
for all λ ∈U,
T ♮is surjective, hence also, by the open mapping theorem, open.
□
To obtain the proof of Theorem 21.2.8, we need ﬁrst some technical
observations.
Given T ∈B(X), for a T -invariant closed linear subspace Y of X, let
T | Y ∈B(Y)
denote the operator given by the restriction of T to Y, and let
T/Y ∈B(X/Y)
denote the operator induced by T on the quotient space X/Y. The subscript f
(f as in full) refers to σ(T ) with all its holes ﬁlled in. This is the polynomially
convex hull of σ(T ), as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.1.4.
Proposition 21.2.6
Let T ∈B(X) be an operator, and suppose that Y and Z
are T -invariant closed linear subspaces of X with the property that X = Y + Z.
Then
σ(T/Y) ⊆σ(T ) ∪σ(T | Y) ⊆σf(T )
and
σ(T/Z) ⊆σf(T | Y) ⊆σf(T ) .
Proof
We know that (T/Y)Q = Q T, where Q : X →X/Y is the natural
quotient map. For arbitrary λ ∈ρ(T ) ∩ρ(T | Y), T/Y −λ is surjective be-
cause both Q and T −λ are. Moreover, if (T/Y −λ)Qx = 0 for some x ∈X,
then (T −λ)x ∈Y, and hence x ∈Y because λ ∈ρ(T | Y); thus T/Y −λ is
invertible on X/Y. This shows that σ(T/Y) ⊆σ(T ) ∪σ(T | Y).
Next, the classical identity
(T −λ)−1 = −
∞

n=0
λ−n−1 T n
for all λ ∈C with |λ| > ∥T ∥,
shows that (T −λ)−1Y ⊆Y for all such λ and, since C \ σf(T ) is connected,
the identity theorem for vector-valued functions tells us that (T −λ)−1Y ⊆Y
for all λ ∈C \ σf(T ), hence that σ(T | Y) ⊆σf(T ).
Finally, the assumption that X = Y + Z provides us with a canonical
surjection from the space Y onto the quotient X/Z with kernel Y ∩Z.
If the corresponding isomorphism is called R : Y/(Y ∩Z) →X/Z, then

208
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
(T/Z)R = R (T | Y)/(Y ∩Z), and so σ(T/Z) = σ((T | Y)/(Y ∩Z)). From
the work already done, we know that
σ((T | Y)/(Y ∩Z)) ⊆σ(T | Y) ∪σ(T | (Y ∩Z)) ⊆σf(T | Y) ⊆σf(T ) ,
and hence σ(T/Z) ⊆σf(T | Y) ⊆σf(T ) .
□
Proposition 21.2.7
Suppose that Y and Z are closed linear subspaces of X
and that U ⊆C is an open disc. Then the following properties hold.
(i) The quotient map from X onto X/Y induces a canonical topological iso-
morphism H(U, X/Y) ∼= H(U, X)/H(U, Y).
(ii) If X = Y + Z, then the operator  : H(U, Y) × H(U, Z) →H(U, X),
given by ( f, g)(λ) := f (λ) + g(λ) for all f ∈H(U, Y), g ∈H(U, Z),
and λ ∈U, is a continuous and open linear surjection. In particular, if
X = Y ⊕Z (direct sum), then the map  yields a canonical identiﬁcation
H(U, X) ∼= H(U, Y) ⊕H(U, Z).
Proof (i) This is immediate from Proposition 21.2.5: let T : X →X/Y be the
canonical quotient map and observe that ker T ♮= H(U, Y).
For (ii) ﬁrst note that the deﬁnition &( f, g)(λ) := ( f (λ), g(λ)) for f in
H(U, Y), g in H(U, Z), and λ in U yields a topological linear isomorphism
& from H(U, Y) × H(U, Z) onto H(U, Y × Z). Next, let T : Y × Z →X
be the canonical continuous linear surjection from the product space Y × Z
onto X, given by T (u, v) = u + v for all u ∈Y and v ∈Z. Then Proposition
21.2.5 tells us that the corresponding map T ♮: H(U, Y × Z) →H(U, X) is
continuous, surjective, open, and linear. This implies our claims for , since
 = T ♮◦&.
□
And now the result itself.
Theorem 21.2.8
Decomposability implies (β) and (δ) – and vice versa.
Proof The ﬁrst step is to show that decomposability implies (β). Let U ⊆C
be open, and consider a sequence of analytic functions fn : U →X for which
(T −λ) fn(λ) →0 as n →∞, locally uniformly onU. It is enough to show that
fn →0 as n →∞uniformly on any closed disc in in U. So take an arbitrary
closed disc D ⊆U and choose an open disc E such that D ⊆E ⊆E ⊆U.
Apply the deﬁnition of decomposability of T to the open cover {E, C \ D}
of C. This gives us T -invariant closed linear subspaces Y, Z ⊆X for which
σ(T | Y) ⊆E, σ(T | Z) ∩D = ∅, and X = Y + Z. Proposition 21.2.7 then

21
Basic notions from operator theory
209
yields functions gn ∈H(U, Y) and hn ∈H(U, Z) such that
fn(λ) = gn(λ) + hn(λ)
for all λ ∈U and n ∈N .
Additionally, by Proposition 21.2.6, σ(T/Z) ⊆σ f (T | Y) ⊆E, so, for every
λ in the boundary ∂E of E, the operator T/Z −λ is invertible on the quo-
tient space X/Z. By compactness and continuity, we obtain a c > 0 such that
∥(T/Z −λ)−1 ∥≤c for all λ ∈∂E. Consequently, if Q : X →X/Z is the
natural quotient map, then
Qgn(λ) = Q fn(λ) = (T/Z −λ)−1Q(T −λ) fn(λ)
for all λ ∈∂E,
and therefore ∥Qgn(λ) ∥≤c ∥(T −λ) fn(λ) ∥for all λ ∈∂E. This estimate,
and our assumption on the functions fn, then imply that the analytic functions
Q ◦gn in H(U, X/Z) converge to zero uniformly on ∂E and therefore, by the
maximum modulus principle, uniformly on E. Now, by Proposition 21.2.7,
H(E, X/Z) may be identiﬁed with H(E, X)/H(E, Z), and consequently we
obtain functions kn ∈H(E, Z) for which gn + kn →0 as n →∞, locally uni-
formly on E, hence uniformly on D.
Now, fn = gn + hn = (gn + kn) + (hn −kn) on D for all n ∈N, and so it re-
mains to see that hn −kn converges to 0 uniformly on D. Observe that, because
σ(T | Z) ∩D = ∅, there is a constant c1 > 0 such that ∥(T | Z −λ)−1 ∥≤c1
for all λ ∈D. Since both hn and kn map into the space Z and hn = fn −gn,
we conclude that
∥(hn −kn)(λ) ∥≤c1 ∥(T −λ)(hn −kn)(λ) ∥
≤c1 ∥(T −λ) fn(λ) ∥+ c1 ∥(T −λ)(gn + kn)(λ) ∥
for all λ ∈D and n ∈N. We have now shown that hn −kn →0 uniformly
on D.
That decomposability implies (δ) is immediate: if C = U ∪V and Y, Z are
chosen in accordance with the deﬁnition of decomposability, then the inclusion
σ(T |Y) ⊆U implies that Y ⊆XT (U). Similarly, Z ⊆XT (V ). This establishes
(δ).
Finally, if T has both (β) and (δ) then decomposability will follow once we
have seen that each XT (F) is closed. And this follows from (β). Here is a sketch
of the argument. Since XT (F) := {x ∈X : x ∈TC\F H(C \ F, X)}, we see that
XT (F) = TC\F H(C \ F, X) ∩X.
We leave it as an exercise (21.3.8) that the closedness of XT (F) follows from
this. Next, if U ∪V = C is an open cover, then choose open sets U1 and V1,

210
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
still covering C, so that U1 ⊆U and V1 ⊆V. We have
X = XT (U1) + XT (V1) .
It is then not too difﬁcult, using the open mapping theorem, to see that
σ(T |XT (U1)) ⊆U1 ⊆U ,
and also that
σ(T |XT (V1)) ⊆V1 ⊆V
which establishes the decomposability of T (Exercise 21.3.9).
□

21.4 Additional notes
Decomposability may be described entirely in terms of spectral capacities
(subspace-valued functions from the Borel sets of C which behave pretty much
like the ranges of spectral projections, cf. Deﬁnition 21.1.2), which brings it
conceptually even closer to the spectral theorem. The class of decomposable
operators is but one of the natural extensions based in the spectral theorem. We
shall deﬁne a couple of them in the next chapter, but there are others: spectral
and scalar operators, going back to Dunford, as well as various strengthenings
of the decomposability requirement. Chapter 1 of Laursen and Neumann (2000)
tells more. Of course, Hilbert space operator theory has a history and dynamics

21
Basic notions from operator theory
211
of its own, displayed by the appearance of several classes containing the normal
ones, such as sub- or hyponormal operators.
The history of decomposability is quite interesting. The subject has generated
many classes of operators, as well as a conceptual evolution, for instance of the
very deﬁnition of decomposability, which was quite complicated when Foia¸s
ﬁrst proposed it, but now, thanks to Albrecht and Lange, reads very simply.
Among the leading classical practitioners of this branch of operator theory we
ﬁnd people such as Dunford, Bishop, Foia¸s, Vasilescu, Frunza and Albrecht,
while the more recent developments have been strongly inﬂuenced by, inter alia,
Albrecht, Lange, Eschmeier and Putinar. Chapter 1 of Laursen and Neumann
(2000) contains an account of all this.
In Gleason (1962), it was shown that Proposition 21.2.5 actually holds for
arbitrary open subsets U of C. The proof of this general version is considerably
more involved, and such a high level of generality is not needed in the present
work.

22
Classes of decomposable operators
22.1 Local properties of operators
In this chapter we shall take a closer look at super-decomposable and at gen-
eralized scalar operators. Along the way we also obtain some examples of
operators with (β), namely all isometries.
The companion concept of the glocal subspace is the local analytic spectral
subspace. Here is ﬁrst the deﬁnition of local spectrum.
Deﬁnition 22.1.1
Let T ∈B(X) and x ∈X. The local resolvent ρT (x) of T at
x is the set of λ ∈C for which there is an open neighbourhood N(λ) on which
the equation (T −µ) f (µ) = x has an analytic solution f : N(λ) →X. The
local spectrum is
σT (x) := C \ ρT (x) ,
and, given a closed subset F of the complex plane, the local analytic subspace is
XT (F) := {x ∈X : σT (x) ⊆F} .
It follows directly from the deﬁnition that XT (Fα) = XT (Fα) for arbi-
trary collections {Fα} of closed subsets of C.
There are some immediate connections between the glocal and the local
spectral subspaces. In fact, it is clear that, if x ∈XT (F), then C \ F ⊆ρT (x),
and hence XT (F) ⊆XT (F) for every closed set F ⊆C. As a matter of fact it
is not difﬁcult to tell when these two classes of subspaces coincide.
Proposition 22.1.2
For T ∈B(X), we have XT (F) = XT (F) for every closed
set F ⊆C if and only if XT (∅) = {0}, and this happens precisely when T has
SVEP.

The surjectivity spectrum is deﬁned as
σsu(T ) := {λ ∈C : T −λ is not surjective} ,
while the approximate point spectrum is
σap(T ) := {λ ∈C :
there is a sequence {xn} of unit vectors
for which (T −λ)xn →0 as n →∞} .
Among the basic properties of the surjectivity spectrum, we note the fol-
lowing (the proofs are left as exercises – think of the open mapping theorem
when you solve them). For every λ ∈C \ σsu(T ), there is a c > 0 for which
X = XT (C \ D(λ; c)) (cf. Exercise 24.3.3). In particular, σ(T ) \ σsu(T ) ⊆
σp(T ), and, if T has SV E P, then σ(T ) = σsu(T ). The most immediate con-
nection to local spectral theory is that
σsu(T ) =  {σT (x) : x ∈X} .
Similarly, for the approximate point spectrum it is a basic fact that it is a closed
set which contains the topological boundary of the spectrum.
Proposition 22.1.3
Let T ∈B(X) be decomposable. Then
σ(T ) = σap(T ) = σsu(T ) =  {σT (x) : x ∈X} .
Proof
We know from Theorem 21.2.8 that T has (β), hence SVEP, so the
remarks just made show us that σ(T ) = σsu(T ) =  {σT (x) : x ∈X} . To see
that σap(T ) = σ(T ), we may argue this way: given any λ ∈σ(T ) and ε > 0,
let U ⊆C be an open set for which λ /∈U and U ∪D(λ; ε) = C. By decom-
posability, there are T -invariant closed linear subspaces Y, Z ⊆X for which
X = Y + Z, σ(T | Y) ⊆U and σ(T | Z) ⊆D(λ; ε). The subspace Z must be
non-trivial, since otherwise X = Y, and hence σ(T ) = σ(T | Y) ⊆U, which
would contradict that λ /∈U. Since Z is non-trivial and since
∂σ(T | Z) ⊆σap(T | Z) ⊆σap(T ) ,
it follows from the inclusion σ(T | Z) ⊆D(λ; ε) that D(λ; ε) ∩σap(T ) ̸= ∅.
Thus we have λ ∈σap(T ) because this set is closed.
□
Here is another useful observation:

214
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
Lemma 22.1.4
Let U be an open subset of C. If T ∈B(X), x ∈X, and
f ∈H(U, X) are chosen so that TU f ≡x on U, then f (λ) ∈TU H(U, X) for
all λ ∈U. Moreover, σT (x) = σT ( f (λ)) for all λ ∈U.
Proof Given an arbitrary λ ∈U, we deﬁne g : U →X by
g(λ) := f ′(λ)
and
g(µ) := ( f (µ) −f (λ))/(µ −λ)
for all
µ ∈U \ {λ} .
Then g ∈H(U, X). Since (T −µ) f (µ) = x for all µ ∈U, a short calculation
reveals that (T −µ)g(µ) = f (λ) for all µ ∈U \ {λ}, and, by continuity, also
(T −λ)g(λ) = f (λ). That settles the ﬁrst part of the lemma. It also shows that
U ⊆ρT ( f (λ)).
On the other hand, for any ω ∈ρT (x) \ U, we may choose an open neigh-
bourhood W of ω such that λ /∈W and an analytic function h : W →X for
which (T −µ)h(µ) = x, identically on W. If we then deﬁne
k(µ) := (h(µ) −f (λ))/(µ −λ)
for all µ ∈W, we have obtained an analytic function k : W →X for which
(T −µ)k(µ) = f (λ)
for all
µ ∈W .
This shows that ω ∈ρT ( f (λ)), and hence that ρT (x) ⊆ρT ( f (λ)).
For the opposite inclusion, take any ω ∈ρT ( f (λ)), and consider an an-
alytic function h : W →X on an open neighbourhood W of ω such that
(T −µ)h(µ) = f (λ) for all µ ∈W. Substitution of this leads to
(T −µ)(T −λ)h(µ) = (T −λ)(T −µ)h(µ) = (T −λ) f (λ) = x
for all µ ∈W, which shows that ω ∈ρT (x), and hence that ρT ( f (λ)) ⊆ρT (x).
All in all, σT (x) = σT ( f (λ)) for all λ ∈U.
□
22.2 Super-decomposable operators
Here is our ﬁrst class of examples of decomposable operators. The super-
decomposable operators are based on the idea of operator-valued partitions
of unity. More speciﬁcally, we are considering a class of operators for which
the condition of decomposability is implemented by certain operator ranges.
Deﬁnition 22.2.1
An operator T ∈B(X) is super-decomposable if, for every
open cover of C by two subsets U and V, there is an operator R ∈B(X) which

22
Classes of decomposable operators
215
commutes with T and for which
σ(T | RX) ⊆U
and
σ(T | (I −R)X) ⊆V .
This deﬁnition makes sense because, by the condition R T = T R, the spaces
RX and (I −R)X are T -invariant. It is obvious that super-decomposable
operators are decomposable.
Proposition 22.2.2
Every operator T ∈B(X) with totally disconnected spec-
trum is super-decomposable.
Proof For any open cover {U, V } of C, σ(T ) ∩U is a relatively open neigh-
bourhood of the closed subset σ(T ) \ V of σ(T ). Hence a standard compactness
argument provides us with a clopen subset G of σ(T ) for which G ⊆U and
σ(T ) \ G ⊆V. We may then choose disjoint open sets U1, V1 ⊆C so that
U1 ⊆U, V1 ⊆V, U1 ∩σ(T ) = G, and V1 ∩σ(T ) = σ(T ) \ G.
Subsequently we pick a contour  in U1 ∪V1 that surrounds σ(T ), and let
R :=
1
2πi


f (λ) (λ −T )−1 dλ ,
where now f ∈H(U1 ∪V1) is the characteristic function of U1. The operator
R ∈B(X) is a projection, it commutes with T, and it is not difﬁcult to show
that
σ(T | RX) = G ⊆U1 ⊆U
and
σ(T | (I −R)X) = σ(T ) \ G ⊆V1 ⊆V ;
(see, e.g., Theorem 7.3.20 of Dunford and Schwartz 1958; or Part I, Theorem
4.3.1). This shows that T is super-decomposable.
□
This result applies to all operators with countable spectrum, and hence, in
particular, to all quasi-nilpotent operators (cf. Part I, Chapter 2). It also covers all
algebraic operators T ∈B(X), those for which p(T ) = 0 for some non-trivial
polynomial p (since the spectra of such operators are ﬁnite). Further examples
are: compact operators and Riesz operators (where an operator T ∈B(X) is a
Riesz operator if, for each λ ∈C \ {0}, the spaces ker(T −λ) and X/(T −λ)X
are both of ﬁnite dimension; in other words, T is Riesz if T −λ is Fredholm,
for every λ ∈C \ {0}). See also Part V.
We have touched on the analytic functional calculus (cf. the account in Part
I, Chapter 4). We now show that non-analytic functional calculi tend to gen-
erate super-decomposable operators. To be speciﬁc, let A be an algebra of
complex-valued functions, deﬁned on an arbitrary non-empty subset 
 of C,

216
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
so that the following two conditions are fulﬁlled. First, we suppose that A is
richly endowed, which is to mean that A contains the restrictions to 
 of all
polynomials, and that, for every f ∈A and every λ ∈C \ supp f, there exists a
function g ∈A for which (Z −λ)g = f. Here it is natural to deﬁne the support
of a function f ∈A as the set
supp f := {λ ∈
 : f (λ) ̸= 0} ,
where the closure is taken in C, not just in the relative topology of 
. Secondly,
we suppose that A admits partitions of unity, in the sense that, for an arbitrary
ﬁnite open cover {U1, . . . , Um} of 
, there are functions f1, . . . , fm ∈A for
which supp fk ⊆Uk for k = 1, . . . , m and f1 + · · · + fm ≡1 on 
.
Obvious examples of such algebras are the algebras C m(
) of all m times
continuously differentiable functions deﬁned on an open set 
 ⊆C, for ar-
bitrary m ∈{0, 1, . . . , ∞}. Moreover, if, additionally, 
 is bounded, then ex-
amples are provided by the algebras C m(
) of all functions in C m(
) which,
together with all their partial derivatives up to order m, have continuous exten-
sions to the closure 
.
Deﬁnition 22.2.3
Suppose that the algebra A is richly endowed and admits
partitions of unity. An operator T ∈B(X) is an A-scalar operator if there
exists an algebra homomorphism  : A →B(X) for which (1) = IX and
(Z) = T.
Here IX is the identity operator on X. There is no continuity assumption
on  in this deﬁnition (although it may be shown that such homomorphisms
have quite remarkable automatic continuity properties). The map  is called
a non-analytic functional calculus for T . An important special case occurs
when A = C ∞(C), and we also require that  be continuous with respect to
the natural Fr´echet algebra topology on C ∞(C): in this case, we have already
introduced the terminology that the operator T is generalized scalar. We shall
give more details on these operators below.
It is immediate that the spectrum of any A-scalar operator is contained in

, where 
 is the domain of the functions in the algebra A. But our ambition
now is to show that A-scalar operators are super-decomposable and to give an
explicit description of the local spectral subspaces.
Theorem 22.2.4
Let A be an algebra of functions on an arbitrary non-
empty set 
 ⊆C, and suppose that A is richly endowed and admits partitions
of unity. Also, let the A-scalar operator T ∈B(X) be given by an algebra

22

homomorphism  : A →B(X) for which (1) = I and (Z) = T. Then T is
super-decomposable, and the local spectral subspace XT (F) for a closed set
F ⊆C is given by
XT (F) =

{ker ( f ) : f ∈A and supp f ∩F = ∅} .
Proof The idea of the proof is, for arbitrary closed F ⊆C, to establish enough
properties of the right-hand set
E(F) :=

{ker ( f ) : f ∈A and supp f ∩F = ∅} .
to see that it is indeed XT (F). Evidently, E(F) is a closed linear subspace of X
and E(F) is invariant under (g) for all g ∈A, hence, in particular, under T. An
argument involving both partitions of unity and the fact that A is richly endowed
then shows that σ(T | E(F)) ⊆F. It is now clear that E(F) ⊆XT (F). The next
step then establishes that T is super-decomposable: let {U, V } be an open cover
of C, and choose f ∈A for which supp f ⊆U and supp (1 −f ) ⊆V. The
operator R := ( f ) commutes with T, and
RX ⊆E(supp f )
and
(I −R)X ⊆E(supp (1 −f )) .
By the spectral inclusions from the preceding paragraph, it follows that T is
super-decomposable.
Finally, the inclusion E(F) ⊇XT (F) is a bit of a technical tour de force:
we ﬁrst establish that E(∞
n=1Fn) = ∞
n=1E(Fn) for every countable family
{Fn} of closed sets in C. Here the inclusion ⊆is obvious. For the other one,
let x ∈∞
n=1E(Fn), and let f ∈A be any function for which supp f ∩F = ∅,
where F := ∞
n=1Fn. By compactness, there exists k ∈N such that
σ(T ) ∩supp f ⊆(C \ F1) ∪· · · ∪(C \ Fk) .
If we supplement this union with the complement of σ(T ) ∩supp f, we have
a ﬁnite open cover of C. Consequently, we may choose functions f0, . . . , fk
∈A for which f0 + · · · + fk is 1 on 
, σ(T ) ∩supp f ∩supp f0 = ∅, and
supp f j ∩Fj = ∅for j = 1, . . . , k. It is clear that
( f f0)X ⊆E(supp ( f f0)) ⊆XT (supp ( f f0) ∩σ(T )) = {0},
and hence ( f f0)x = 0. Moreover, since x ∈E(Fj) and supp f j ∩Fj = ∅, we
obtain ( f j)x = 0 for j = 1, . . . , k. All in all, we conclude that
( f )x =
k

j=0
( f f j)x =
k

j=1
( f )( f j)x = 0 ,
and therefore x ∈E(F).

Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
With this knowledge about E(F) we are now in a position to show that
E(F) ⊇XT (F). To do this, we ﬁx an arbitrary open neighbourhood U of F,
and choose an open set V ⊆C so that U ∪V = C and V ∩F = ∅. From what
we did before, we see that X = E(U) + E(V ). Since
E(U ∩V ) = E(U) ∩E(V ) ,
the quotient spaces X/E(U) and E(V )/E(U ∩V ) are seen to be canonically
isomorphic. This implies that
σ(T/E(U)) ⊆σ(T | E(V )) ∪σ(T | E(U ∩V )) ⊆V ∪(U ∩V ) = V ,
by Proposition 21.2.6. On the other hand, we know that σ(T | XT (F)) ⊆F.
Now, if Q : X →X/E(U) denotes the canonical quotient map, then clearly
(T/E(U)) Q | XT (F) = Q (T | XT (F)) .
By the analytic functional calculus, it follows that
f (T/E(U)) Q | XT (F) = Q f (T | XT (F))
for every function f analytic on some open neighbourhood of V ∪F. Since
V ∩F = ∅, there is an analytic function f for which f ≡1 on an open neigh-
bourhood of V and f ≡0 on an open neighbourhood of F. For this func-
tion, it follows that f (T/E(U)) is the identity operator on X/E(U), while
f (T | XT (F)) is the zero operator on XT (F). We conclude that Q | XT (F) = 0,
and hence that XT (F) ⊆E(U). Since F may be written as an intersection of
countably many open neighbourhoods, and E preserves countable intersections,
we have ﬁnally shown that XT (F) ⊆E(F).
□
Example 22.2.5
This example is based on Laursen and Neumann (2000,
Example 1.4.11). Consider a commutative Banach algebra A with totally dis-
connected character space A and let  denote an algebra homomorphism
from A to some B(X). We claim that (a) ∈B(X) is super-decomposable for
every element a ∈A. Once this is established, we see (taking  to be the left
regular representation of A) that all multiplication operators on such an algebra
are super-decomposable. This covers the case of the group algebra L1(G) of a
compact abelian group G. (Since the character space of L1(G) may be identi-
ﬁed with the dual group of G, and since the dual group of a compact abelian
group is discrete, we have that, in this case, L1(G) is discrete, and hence totally

22

219
disconnected.) For a brief discussion of the algebras L1(G), see Part I, §3.4 and
Part II.
The proof uses the ˇSilov idempotent theorem (see Part I, Additional note
4.5.4). If A is as stipulated, and we also suppose (to cover the more compli-
cated case) that A has no unit element, let A# := A ⊕C be the unitization of A,
and let 1 : A# →B(X) denote the canonical extension of the given , so that
1(a + λ) := (a) + λI for all a ∈A and λ ∈C. An operator T ∈B(X) is
super-decomposable if and only if this holds for T −λ, for any ﬁxed λ ∈C,
so we may replace a by a −λ, if necessary, and hence may add the assump-
tion that a ∈A# be invertible in A#. To establish that 1(a) ∈B(X) is super-
decomposable, let {U, V } be an open cover of C. If µ ∈C is the scalar for
which a −µ ∈A, we may suppose that µ ∈V. The Gelfand transform of
a −µ vanishes at inﬁnity on A, so the set
K := {ϕ ∈A : ϕ(a) ∈C \ V }
is compact, and it is clear that K is contained in the open set
L := {ϕ ∈A : ϕ(a) ∈U} .
By local compactness and total disconnectedness of A, its Gelfand topology
has a base consisting of compact and open sets. Consequently, there is a com-
pact and open set C ⊆A for which K ⊆C ⊆L. Now we invoke the ˇSilov
idempotent theorem: there is an idempotent r ∈A for which ϕ(r) = 1 for all
ϕ ∈C and ϕ(r) = 0 for all ϕ ∈A \ C. Evidently, R := (r) commutes with
T . Moreover, for the spectrum σ(ar) of ar ∈A, elementary Gelfand theory
tells us that
σ(ar) = {ϕ(ar) : ϕ ∈A} ∪{0} ⊆U ∪{0} .
Hence ar −λ is invertible in A# if 0 ̸= λ ∈C \ U. This implies that, for every
such λ, there is an element aλ ∈A# for which (ar −λ)aλ = r, and therefore
(a −λ)aλr = r.Thisequalityalsoholdsforλ = 0ifwechoosea0 := a−1. Now
apply the homomorphism 1: we see that (T −λ)1(aλ)R = R, and hence that
(T −λ)1(aλ)x = x
for all x ∈RX and λ ∈C \ U. Since (aλ) commutes
with T and leaves RX invariant, this establishes that σ(T | RX) ⊆U. An anal-
ogous argument gives σ(T | (I −R)X) ⊆V. So T is super-decomposable.
□
It is interesting that for many super-decomposable operators it is possible to
give a description of their local spectral subspaces in purely algebraic terms.

220
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
This is important in applications of local spectral theory to automatic continuity
questions, where we want topological conclusions, but not topological assump-
tions. The way to do this is to relate the local spectral subspaces to spaces
(dating back to Johnson and Sinclair (1969) which are called the algebraic
spectral subspaces.
For a subset F of C and a linear map T on a vector space X, consider the
collectionofalllinearsubspacesY of X withthepropertythat(T −λ)Y = Y for
every λ ∈C \ F. The linear span E T (F) of all such subspaces Y will evidently
itself have the property that (T −λ)E T (F) = E T (F) for every λ ∈C \ F. This
shows that E T (F) is the largest linear subspace with respect to this surjectivity
condition.
A simple example: if the map T is injective then
E T (C \ {0}) =
∞

n=1
T n X.
This intersection is often called the generalized range and denoted by T ∞X.
Indeed, the inclusion ⊆is immediate, and the other one follows from the obser-
vationthat,byinjectivity,∞
n=1 T n X = T (∞
n=1 T n X).Thespace E T (C \ {0})
is also studied in Part V, where it is called the algebraic core (Deﬁnition 26.1.5;
the above formula for E T (C \ {0}), when T is injective, is a special case of
Proposition 26.1.10).
The space E T (∅) is of particular interest. It is the largest linear subspace Y
of X for which (T −λ)Y = Y for all λ ∈C, and is called the largest divisible
subspace for T. In the theory of automatic continuity, it is often crucial to
exclude the existence of non-trivial divisible subspaces, because their presence
tends to preclude the desired continuity conclusions. For this sort of reason, we
are particularly interested in classes of operators T for which E T (∅) = {0}.
Now getting back to the case of a bounded linear operator T ∈B(X), it is
easy to see that E T (F) = E T (F ∩σ(T )) for all sets F ⊆C. Furthermore, it is
clear that XT (F) ⊆E T (F) for all sets F ⊆C. In general, these inclusions will
be strict, even when F = ∅. Indeed, XT (∅) = {0} precisely when T has SVEP,
but even super-decomposable operators may well have non-trivial divisible
subspaces.
For an example of this, let T ∈B(X) be both quasi-nilpotent and injective.
By Proposition 22.2.2, T is super-decomposable. Thus XT (∅) = {0}, while it
follows from the observations we have just made that
E T (∅) = E T ((C \ {0}) ∩{0}) = E T (C \ {0}) = T ∞X .
The generalized range may be quite large, as illustrated, for instance, by the
Volterra operator:

22
Classes of decomposable operators
221
Example 22.2.6
The Volterra operator (cf. Part I, Exercise 1.5.6) We deﬁne
X := C([0, 1]) , and let T ∈B(X) be given by
(T f )(t) :=

t
0
f (s) ds
for all
f ∈X
and
t ∈[0, 1] .
Then T is injective, compact, and quasi-nilpotent. In particular, it follows that
T is a super-decomposable operator with XT (∅) = {0}. On the other hand, from
the identity E T (∅) = T ∞X, we may conclude that E T (∅) is the set of all in-
ﬁnitely differentiable functions on [0, 1] which, along with all their derivatives,
vanish at 0. Thus E T (∅) is strictly larger than XT (∅).
□
As another typical example (where E T (∅) is small) we mention the case
of decomposable multiplication operators on semisimple commutative Banach
algebras. They will be discussed in Chapter 25, but if T is any multiplication
operator on a commutative Banach algebra A, then it is easily seen that the
intersection  {(T −λ)A : λ ∈C} is contained in the radical of A, and hence
must be trivial when X is semisimple.
Here is a simple special case in which we can readily give an explicit, al-
gebraic description of the local spectral subspaces. We shall mention a similar
one a bit later, for generalized scalar operators (Theorem 22.3.2).
Proposition 22.2.7
Let T ∈B(X) be super-decomposable and suppose that

λ∈C
(T −λ)pX = {0}
for some p ∈N .
Then, for every closed set F ⊆C,
XT (F) = E T (F) =

λ∈C\F
(T −λ)pXx .
Proof
The idea of proof is similar to that of Theorem 22.2.4: given a closed set
F ⊆C, let GT (F) be the intersection of the spaces (T −λ)pX where λ ranges
over C \ F. The containments XT (F) ⊆E T (F) ⊆GT (F) are immediate and,
to show the converse, it is enough to show that GT (F) ⊆XT (U) for an arbitrary
open neighbourhood U of F.
By deﬁnition of super-decomposability and properties of the spectral sub-
spaces, there is an operator R ∈B(X) for which T R = R T, RX ⊆XT (C \ F),
and such that (I −R)X ⊆XT (U). Hence to establish that GT (F) ⊆XT (U),
it remains to be seen that RGT (F) = {0}. By the assumption on T, for this it
sufﬁces to show that RGT (F) ⊆(T −λ)pX for every λ ∈C. If λ ∈C \ F,

222
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
this inclusion follows from the very deﬁnition of GT (F) and the fact that
the operators R and T commute. On the other hand, if λ ∈F, the inclusion
RGT (F) ⊆(T −λ)pX follows from
RX ⊆XT (C \ F) = (T −λ)XT (C \ F) .
Thus RGT (F) = {0}, and consequently GT (F) ⊆XT (U).
□
22.3 Generalized scalar operators
We have mentioned already that an operator T ∈B(X) is generalized scalar if
T = (Z) for some continuous algebra homomorphism  : C ∞(C) →B(X)
with (1) = IX. We have also observed that, as A-scalar operators, generalized
scalaroperatorsaresuper-decomposable,hencealsodecomposable.Muchmore
is true.
The continuity of  means that there exist a compact subset Q of C, a
constant c ≥0, and k ∈Z+ such that
∥( f )∥≤c ∥f ∥k,Q
for all f ∈C ∞(C) ,
where C is canonically identiﬁed with R2, and
∥f ∥k,Q :=

|α|≤k
1
α! sup {|D α f (λ)| : λ ∈Q}
for all f ∈C ∞(C) .
To start off, here is a speciﬁc example of a generalized scalar operator.
Example 22.3.1
Every surjective isometry T ∈B(X) is generalized scalar: a
functional calculus on C∞(C) for such an operator is given by
( f ) :=
∞

n=−∞
f (n) T n
for all f ∈C∞(C) ,
where f (n) is the nth Fourier coefﬁcient of the restriction of the function f to
the unit circle T, that is,
f (n) := 1
2π

f (eiθ) e−inθ dθ

22
Classes of decomposable operators
223
If, as in Part I, Exercise 1.5.4, we let g(θ) := f (e iθ) for all θ ∈[−π, π],
then, for every n ∈Z \ {0}, repeated integrations by parts lead to the formula
f (n) =
1
(in) p
1
2π

π
−π
g(p)(θ) e−inθ dθ
for all p ∈Z+.
This shows that |f (n)| is O(|n|−p) for any given p ∈Z+. Since ∥T n∥= 1 for
all n ∈Z, it follows that the inﬁnite series
∞

n=−∞
f (n) T n
converges in the operator norm of B(X), and hence there is a well-deﬁned
continuous linear map  : C ∞(C) →B(X) with (T ) =  f (n)T n. (This
argument works not just for invertible isometries, but also for any T ∈B(X)
that satisﬁes σ(T ) ⊆T and has polynomial growth in the sense that there is
a bound ∥T n∥= O(|n| α) for some α ≥0, as |n| →∞. In particular, every
doubly power-bounded operator is generalized scalar.)
□
Incidentally, knowledge of the order of a generalized scalar operator T in
B(X) (which is deﬁned to be the smallest k ∈Z+ for which the estimates
involved in the above speciﬁcation of continuity of  hold, for appropriate
choice of , Q, and c) makes it possible to give a very precise description of
the local spectral subspaces. The proof of that part of the next theorem is rather
involved, and we omit it here. It may be found in Laursen and Neumann (2000,
Theorem 1.5.4).
Theorem 22.3.2
Let T ∈B(X) be a generalized scalar operator of order
k ∈Z+. Then T is super-decomposable, and the representation
XT (F) = E T (F) =

λ∈C\F
(T −λ)pX
holds for every closed set F ⊆C and every integer p for which p ≥k + 3. In
particular, T has no non-trivial divisible subspace.
□
Finally, we may combine the observation of Example 22.3.1 with the fact
(noted in Chapter 21) that a restriction of a decomposable operator to a closed
invariant subspace will have (β). The conclusion is that (β) holds for any
isometry. A simple proof comes from the following extension result, due to
Douglas (1969).

Proposition 22.3.3
Let T ∈B(X) be an isometry. Then there is a Banach
space Y into which X may be isometrically embedded and an invertible isometry
S ∈B(Y) which (via the embedding) extends T.
Proof (sketched)
Deﬁne Y0 to be the vector space (pointwise operations) of
all sequences u = {u1, u2, . . . } in X for which um+1 = T um for all sufﬁciently
large m. Since T is an isometry, the norms ∥um∥are, for each such sequence,
eventually constant, so the deﬁnition p(u) = limm→∞∥um∥provides us with
a seminorm on Y0. If we quotient out N = {u ∈Y0|p(u) = 0} and complete
the quotient space Y0/N, we obtain a Banach space, say Y. It is easy to see
that the assignment x →{T nx}∞
n=1/N yields an isometric embedding of X
into Y.
In Y0 we may deﬁne the map S0 by S0({um}∞
m=1) = {T um}∞
m=1. Clearly, S0
induces an isometry S on Y. This isometry is invertible and extends T (Exercise
22.4.5).

Corollary 22.3.4
Every isometry has property (β).

22.4 Exercises
In these exercises, let X be a Banach space, and consider an operator T in B(X).
1. Show that, XT (F) = XT (F) for every closed set F ⊆C if and only if
XT (∅) = {0}, and this happens precisely when T has SVEP.
2. Show that, for each λ ∈C \ σsu(T ), there is a constant c > 0 for which
X = XT (C \ D(λ; c)). In particular, show that σ(T ) \ σsu(T ) ⊆σp(T ), and
σ(T ) = σsu(T ), if T has SVEP.
3. Show that σsu(T ) =  {σT (x) : x ∈X} .
4. Show that E T (F) = E T (F ∩σ(T )) for all sets F ⊆C.
5. Fill in the details of the proof of Proposition 22.3.3.
22.5 Additional notes
As already mentioned, a general source for virtually everything that is touched
on here is Laursen and Neumann (2000). A speciﬁc instance of this: as we saw
in Example 22.3.1, if the operator T has powers (negative and positive) of poly-
nomial growth, then T must be generalized scalar; in Laursen and Neumann
(2000) there are more speciﬁc results along these lines: it turns out that, for
operators with spectrum in T, these two properties are essentially equivalent.

22
Classes of decomposable operators
225
This result was originally due to Colojoara and Foia¸s, but Laursen and Neumann
(2000, Theorem 1.5.12) has a simpler proof. There it is also shown that these
conditions are equivalent to the condition that σ(T ) ⊆T provided that the
following norm estimate holds for the growth of the resolvent near the spectrum:
there exist a constant d > 0 and an m ∈N such that
∥(T −λ)−1∥≤d |1 −|λ||−m
for all λ ∈C with |λ| ̸= 1.

Duality theory
In this chapter we shall explore the surprising relations between decomposabil-
ity and properties (β) and (δ).
23.1 Duality between (β) and (δ)
We have already seen, in Theorem 21.2.8, that T is decomposable if and only if it
has both (β) and (δ). But the main reason for emphasizing these two properties
is not just that they together describe decomposability – surely (β), in particular,
is too technical, and too non-intuitive, to gain fame just for that! Their main
conceptual raison d’ˆetre is that they possess a remarkable dual relationship: an
operator will have one of them (either one!) precisely when its adjoint operator
has the other one. This is the signiﬁcant conclusion that is provided by the
duality theory. (You should note that the adjoint operator is called the dual
operator in Part I.)
The duality theory for operators that we are talking about here goes back to
Errett Bishop’s PhD thesis, published in Bishop (1959), where he developed a
spectral theory for an arbitrary bounded linear operator on a reﬂexive Banach
space. Bishop called his development a duality theory, because the operator
and its adjoint are involved. In Bishop (1959) we can see, in more or less fully
developed form, much of what are now basic tools and concepts of the ﬁeld,
such as the glocal spectral subspaces, and conditions (β) and (δ). There was even
a precursor of decomposability (which Bishop called duality theory of type 3).
Theorem 21.2.8 (that T is decomposable if and only if it has both (β) and
(δ)) was of course not available to Bishop. But he did show that, if both T and
T ′ satisfy (β), then T has a duality theory of type 3, that is, T is decomposable.
This result was established without Bishop’s reﬂexivity condition by Frunz˘a
(1971). Bishop also showed that, if T ′ has (β), then T has (δ). This was a result
that rather glaringly used reﬂexivity, because it showed that (T ′)′ has (δ).
226

23
Duality theory
227
The full duality theory owes its spectacular completion to Albrecht and
Eschmeier (1997). It contains the following results. They are not complicated
to state, but a lot of ingenuity lies behind their proofs. You will ﬁnd reasonably
accessible proofs in Laursen and Neumann (2000, Chapter 2).
Theorem 23.1.1
A continuous linear operator on a Banach space has (δ) if
and only if it is a quotient of a decomposable operator with respect to a closed
invariant subspace.
□
Theorem 23.1.2
A continuous linear operator on a Banach space has (β) if
and only if it is a restriction of a decomposable operator to a closed invariant
subspace.
□
Incidentally, the latter theorem explains why operators with (β) are often
called sub-decomposable operators.
In both theorems, the if parts are easy enough. The approach to proving, say,
Theorem 23.1.2 may be explained in fairly non-technical terms as follows. At
its root is a pair of 3-space lemmas both of which may be combined into the
following statement. The proof for the (β) case is easy, the (δ) case is not.
Lemma 23.1.3
Consider a commutative diagram of continuous linear oper-
ators between Banach spaces

with exact rows. If both A and C have (β) (or (δ)) then so does B.
□
Now, through considerable technical effort, it may be established that for an
arbitrary T there is a particular commutative diagram

with exact rows, in which the operator C is generalized scalar, in particular de-
composable, and B, as a quotient of a generalized scalar operator (not displayed
in this diagram), has (δ). Now, if we suppose that T has (β), then the 3-space

228
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
lemma implies that B will also have (β), and hence B is decomposable. This
establishes that T is the restriction of a decomposable operator.
Although the next result would be an easy consequence of Theorem 23.1.5,
we state it separately, because in the actual development of the duality theory
it is used in the proof of Theorem 23.1.5 – and doing so makes it possible for
us to sketch quite a bit of the arguments.
Theorem 23.1.4
An operator T ∈B(X) is decomposable if and only if the
adjoint T ′ ∈B(X′) is decomposable.
□
The proof may be found in Laursen and Neumann (2000, Section 2.5). Not
too surprisingly it makes extensive use of annihilators and preannihilators of
local spectral subspaces. The only if part begins by showing that, if T has the
property that all its local spectral subspaces XT (F) are closed, for every closed
F ⊆C (this is called property (C) for T ), then X′ = XT (C\U)⊥+ XT (C\V )⊥
for every open cover {U, V } of C. This is followed by establishing that, if
T is decomposable, then X′
T ′(F) = XT (C\F)⊥. Finally, this then implies that
T ′ is decomposable. To establish that decomposability of T ′ implies the same
property for T is somewhat more delicate, but the main step consists in showing
that, on the assumption that T ′ have SVEP, X′
T ′(F) is norm-closed if and only
if it is weak-∗closed.
Theorem 23.1.5
A operator T ∈B(X) will have one of the properties (β) or
(δ) if and only if its adjoint T ′ ∈B(X′) has the other one.
Proof
We sketch how to show that, if T has (β), then T ′ has (δ). If T has
(β), then, by Theorem 23.1.2, T has a decomposable extension, say S. By
Theorem 23.1.4, the adjoint operator S′ is also decomposable. Moreover, T ′
may be realized as a quotient of S′. Hence, by Theorem 23.1.1, T ′ has (δ). □
The hardest part of all this, by far, is the proof that, if T ′ has (β), then T has
(δ). You may wish to consult Laursen and Neumann (2000, Chapter 2).

2. Use Theorems 23.1.2, 23.1.1, and 23.1.4 to show that, if T has (δ), then T ′
has (β). Then prove that, if T ′ has (δ), then T has (β).

23.3 Additional notes
The actual functional model is explained in some detail in the Appendix to
Part IV, ‘The functional model’. A fairly elementary account, from which this
background material is culled, is in Laursen and Neumann (2000, Chapter 2).
The complete duality theory was ﬁrst described in Eschmeier’s Habilitations-
schrift and in Albrecht and Eschmeier (1997).
The properties (β) and (δ) have been used in some of the most general so-
lutions of the invariant-subspace problem. Here is a sample, from Eschmeier
and Prunaru (1990): if T ∈B(X) has (β) or (δ) and if V ⊆C is open and
bounded, then if σ(T ) is dominating in V (a technical condition that is satis-
ﬁed, for instance, when σ(T ) has non-empty interior), then T has a non-trivial
closed invariant subspace. Moreover, if the smaller set consisting of the essen-
tial spectrum of T is dominating in V (the essential spectrum is deﬁned at the
beginning of the next chapter), then T has many closed invariant subspaces.
These invariant-subspace results, and much more, are described in Part III of
this book.

24
Preservation of spectra and index
It is well known that, if two linear operators on a ﬁnite-dimensional space are
similar, then their spectra are equal, and that this equality extends to distin-
guished parts of the spectra, such as the point spectra, etc. Here we consider
natural extensions of this situation, where similarity is replaced by weaker
conditions, and where concepts and techniques from local spectral theory are
used.
24.1 An intertwining result
We will concentrate on proving the following result.
Theorem 24.1.1
Suppose that S ∈B(Y) and T ∈B(X) both have property
(β) and that A ∈B(X, Y) and B ∈B(Y, X) are operators with dense ranges
for which SA = AT and T B = BS. Then σ(T ) = σ(S), σe(T ) = σe(S) and
ind(T −λ) = ind(S −λ) for all λ ∈ρe(T ).
First we shall explain the terms. Recall that an operator T ∈B(X) is a
Fredholm operator (or just Fredholm) if its null space ker T is of ﬁnite di-
mension and its range T X is of ﬁnite codimension in X; the range is then
automatically closed (Exercise 24.3.1). The essential spectrum σe(T ) of T is
the set of complex numbers λ for which T −λ is not Fredholm (often expressed
this way: λ is not a Fredholm point for T .) Fredholm theory is developed more
fully in Part V.
A relation such as SA = AT is described by saying that A intertwines the
pair (S, T ). If A is a bijection, then S and T are similar, and A is a similarity. As
we mentioned, a similarity preserves spectra, and even the ﬁner structure of the
spectra (point spectrum, approximate point spectrum, Fredholm points, etc.).
Here we shall see what happens if the conditions on the intertwining operator
230

24
Preservation of spectra and index
231
are weakened, for example to that of being a quasi-afﬁnity, that is, an injective
map with dense range, or even if both (S, T ) and (T, S) are intertwined by
quasi-afﬁnities; in this latter case the operators S and T are said to be quasi-
similar. Note, incidentally, that the answer provided by Theorem 24.1.1 is made
on intertwining assumptions that are slightly weaker than quasi-similarity.
The index of a Fredholm operator T ∈B(X) is
ind(T ) := dim ker T −dim(X/T X) .
Here are a few basic results from classical Fredholm theory: an operator
T ∈B(X)isFredholmifandonlyifitsadjointoperator T ′ ∈B(X′)isFredholm;
in fact, since the dimension of the null space of one equals the codimension of
the range of the other, we see that
ind(T ′) = −ind(T ) .
The product of two Fredholm operators is again Fredholm. In particular,
every power of a Fredholm operator is Fredholm. The index theorem says that
the index is a homomorphism, that is,
ind(T S) = ind(T ) + ind(S)
for all Fredholm operators T, S ∈B(X). Since invertible operators are
Fredholm operators of index zero, it follows that the Fredholm property as
well as the index are preserved under similarity.
Does this hold for quasi-similarities also?
Example 24.1.2
(Fialkow (1977), here reproduced from Laursen and
Neumann 2000, Example 3.7.12). Let T be the unilateral right shift on ℓ2(N),
and let S be the unilateral weighted right shift on ℓ2(N) with weight sequence
(1/(n + 1))n∈N. Then T has (β), σ(T ) = D, and σe(T ) = T, while S is compact
with σ(S) = σe(S) = {0}. Thus σe(T ) and σe(S) are disjoint. However, the pair
(S, T ) is intertwined by a quasi-afﬁnity, namely the multiplication operator A
on ℓ2(N) given by
Ax := (xn/n!)n∈N
for all x = (xn)n∈N ∈ℓ2(N).
It is easy to see that A is injective, has dense range, and that SA = A T.
□
Even when (β) or (δ) is assumed, very little is true about inclusions for the
essential spectra of one-sidedly intertwined operators,

valued analytic functions f deﬁned on the open unit disc D for which
sup

Observe that, for any choice of p, q such that 1 < p < q < ∞, the canonical
embedding A of H q(D) into H p(D) is injective and it has dense range (the
polynomials on D are dense in H p(D)). For arbitrary 1 < p < ∞, the Ces`aro
operator C p on the Hardy space H p(D) is deﬁned by
(C p f )(λ) := 1

In Miller, Miller and Smith (1998) it is shown that C p has (β), that
σ(C p) = D(p/2; p/2),
and that σe(C p) = ∂D(p/2; p/2). The intertwining C p A = A Cq is clear, so
here we have one-sided intertwining, but no nice containment for the essential
spectra; in fact, we have σe(C p) ∩σe(Cq) = {0}.
□
The proof of Theorem 24.1.1 is relatively elementary, but lengthy. It begins
by using an observation about restrictions of Fredholm operators to certain
invariant subspaces.
Proposition 24.1.4
Suppose that T ∈B(X), and that Z ⊆X is a T -invariant
closed linear subspace of ﬁnite codimension in X. Then T is a Fredholm op-
erator on X if and only if T | Z is a Fredholm operator on Z. Moreover, if the
two operators are both Fredholm, they have the same index.
Proof Pick a projection P ∈B(X) with range Z, and observe that the space
(I −P)X = ker P is ﬁnite-dimensional. Since T (I −P) is of ﬁnite-rank,
and T equals T P + T (I −P), it follows that T and T P are Fredholm
simultaneously, and that, in this case, ind(T ) = ind(T P). Moreover, since an
easy calculation will reveal that we have ker(T P) = ker(T | Z) ⊕ker P and
(T P)(X) = (T | Z)(Z),we conclude that T P and T | Z also are Fredholm si-
multaneously and that, when this happens, they will have the same index.
□
Another fundamental fact of Fredholm theory, the punctured disc theorem,
says that, if T is Fredholm, then there is a positive number c with the property
that, for each λ ∈D(0; c), the operator T −λ is Fredholm, and the quanti-
ties dim ker(T −λ) and dim(X/(T −λ)X) are constant on the punctured disc
D(0; c) \ {0}. Moreover,
dim ker(T −λ) ≤dim ker T
and
dim(X/(T −λ)X) ≤dim(X/T X)

24
Preservation of spectra and index
233
for all λ ∈D(0; c). The jump of T is then the non-negative integer
dim ker T −lim
λ→0 dim ker(T −λ) = dim(X/T X) −lim
λ→0 dim(X/(T −λ)X) ,
and the zero-jump theorem says that, for a Fredholm operator T with positive
jump, there exists an invariant closed linear subspace of ﬁnite codimension on
which the restriction of T is Fredholm, with jump zero. Versions more general
than we need here may be found in Kato (1958) and West (1990). See also
Part V.
The zero-jump theorem that we will use, Proposition 24.1.6, has a simple
local-spectral-theory-based proof. We make one observation ﬁrst.
Lemma 24.1.5
Every surjective operator with complemented kernel is right
invertible.
Proof If T ∈B(X) is surjective and if there is a closed subspace Y for which
X = ker T ⊕Y, then, for every x ∈X, there is a unique element y ∈Y such
that T y = x. It is clear that T |Y : Y →X is a bijection, so it has an inverse, say
W ∈B(X, Y). We may regard W as a bounded linear operator on X. Obviously
T W = IX.
□
The converse of the above lemma happens to be true as well, but we shall
not need this.
Proposition 24.1.6
Given a Fredholm operator T ∈B(X), there are numbers
n ∈Z+ and c > 0 for which the dimension of ker(T −λ) | T n X is constant for
all λ ∈D(0; c). This constant value is dim ker(T −λ) for all λ ∈D(0; c) \ {0}.
If T also has SV E P, then this constant value is 0.
Proof
If we add the assumption that T be surjective, this is quite easy: by
Lemma 24.1.5 there is an operator S ∈B(X) for which T S = I. The invertibles
form an open subset of B(X), so the operator (T −λ)S is invertible for all λ in
some open disc D(0; c); in fact, by standard arguments (see Part I, Theorem 1.4.2
(iii)), this holds for c = 1/ ∥S∥. By shrinking the radius c > 0, if necessary,
we may suppose that D(0; c) ⊆ρe(T ). Thus T −λ is a surjective Fredholm
operator for all λ ∈D(0; c). Because the index is locally constant, it follows
that dim ker(T −λ) = dim ker T for every λ ∈D(0; c).
Now we drop the surjectivity assumption on T. Recall the generalized range
T ∞X :=
 
T n X : n ∈N

.

234
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
It can be proved that R := T | T ∞X is surjective and Fredholm (Exercise
24.3.2). So the ﬁrst part shows that there is a c > 0 such that dim ker(R −λ) is
constant for all λ ∈D(0; c). If we choose an n ∈Z+ so that
ker T ∩T n X = ker T ∩T ∞X,
then we see that the constant dim ker(R −λ) is dim ker T | T n X. However, for
every non-zero λ ∈C, ker(T −λ) ⊆T ∞X, and therefore
ker(T −λ) = ker(T | T n X −λ) = ker(R −λ) .
This shows that the constant value is dim ker(T −λ) for all λ ∈D(0; c) \ {0}.
Finally, if T also has SVEP, then its restriction R is a surjective operator with
SVEP. Thus ker R = {0} (Exercise 24.3.3. Exercise before Proposition 22.1.3:
if ker R is non-trivial then surjectivity of R allows the construction of a power
series with sum f, say, for which (R −µ) f (µ) = 0 in a neighbourhood of 0)
and the last assertion follows.
□
The principal tool in the rest of the proof is the next lemma. For an open set
U ⊆C and a W ∈B(X, Y), recall from Chapter 21 the notation
W ♮: H(U, X) →H(U, Y)
fortheoperatorgivenby(W ♮f )(λ) = W( f (λ))forall f ∈H(U, X)andλ ∈U.
Lemma 24.1.7
Suppose that T ∈B(X) is Fredholm, and that the operator
C ∈B(X) commutes with T and has dense range. Then there is an open disc
V := D(0;r) for which C induces a surjection
C ♦: H(V, X)/TV H(V, X) →H(V, X)/TV H(V, X)
by the assignment
C ♦( f + TV H(V, X)) := C ♮f + TV H(V, X)
for all
f ∈H(V, X).
Additionally, if T is also injective, then r > 0 may be chosen so that C ♦is
bijective.
Proof
Evidently, since C T = T C, the deﬁnition of C ♦makes sense. The
range T X is of ﬁnte codimension, so there is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace F
of X for which X = T X ⊕F. Using this splitting, we observe that
C X = C T X + C F = TC X + C F ⊆T X + C F.
The space T X + C F is closed and C has dense range, so X = T X + C F. In
particular, the dimension of C F is at least as big as that of F, that is, C | F is
injective and X = T X ⊕C F. Similarly, X = T X ⊕C n F for every n ∈N.

24
Preservation of spectra and index
235
If we now deﬁne an analytic operator function η on C taking its values in
B(X × F, X) by
η(λ)(x, u) := (T −λ)x + Cu
for all λ ∈C
and
(x, u) ∈X × F,
then we have shown that η(0) is surjective. Moreover, since T X ∩C F = {0},
the space ker η(0) = ker T × {0} is ﬁnite-dimensional. It follows, by Lemma
24.1.5, that η(0) has a continuous linear right inverse, so that η(0)S = IX for
some S ∈B(X, X × F). Continuity of η then implies that invertibility holds
for η(λ)S for all λ near 0, that is, there is an r > 0 such that η(λ)S is invertible
for every λ ∈V := D(0;r). Thus, given any f ∈H(V, X), the assignment
( f1(λ), f2(λ)) := S(η(λ)S)−1 f (λ)
for all λ ∈V
yields analytic functions f1 ∈H(V, X) and f2 ∈H(V, F) such that we have
f = TV f1 + C ♮f2. The surjectivity of C ♦is now obvious.
Next we add the assumption that T is also injective, and we deﬁne
ξ(λ)(x, u) := (T −λ)x + u
for all λ ∈C
and
(x, u) ∈X × F.
The function ξ : C →B(X × F, X) is analytic, and ξ(0) is bijective. Hence,
shrinking the radius of V = D(0;r), if necessary, we may suppose that, for
every λ in V, the operator ξ(λ) is both right and left invertible, that is bijective.
This implies that the operator T −λ is injective and Fredholm, and that
(T −λ)X + F = X for all λ ∈V. Since, by continuity of the index,
dim(X/(T −λ)X) = −ind(T −λ) = −ind(T ) = dim F
for all λ ∈V,
we conclude that, in fact, X = (T −λ)X ⊕F
for all λ ∈V, and the same
argument as before then shows that (T −λ)X ∩C n F = {0} for every n ∈N.
Now, if f, g ∈H(V, X) are functions for which C ♮f = TV g, then, writing, as
above, f = TV f1 + C ♮f2 forsuitable f1 ∈H(V, X)and f2 ∈H(V, F),wesee
that(C 2) ♮f2 ∈TV H(V, X),andconsequently f2 = 0,sothat f ∈TV H(V, X).
This shows that C ♦is injective, and therefore bijective.
□
Proof of Theorem 24.1.1
We begin by establishing the equality of the two
spectra. For this we need two useful observations:
1. Let T ∈B(X) be arbitrary. For each closed F for which F ∩σ(T ) = ∅,
we have XT (F) = {0}. This follows from Liouville’s classic theorem: in
fact, if x = (T −λ) f (λ) for all λ ∈C \ F, where f is analytic, then in a
neighbourhood of F we must have f (λ) = (T −λ)−1x. This implies that f
may be extended analytically (by means of the expression (T −λ)−1x) to
all of C, and since this yields a bounded entire function, f must be constant.
The only possible constant is 0.

2. If T ∈B(X), S ∈B(Y), and if A ∈B(X, Y) intertwines (S, T ), then
σS(Ax) ⊆σT (x) for every x ∈X. This is immediate from the fact that, if the
equation x = (T −λ) f (λ) holds, with f analytic, in some open subset of
C, then Ax = (S −λ)Af (λ) in that same subset, and Af is analytic. By the
same argument we conclude that, if F ⊆C is an arbitrary closed set, then
AXT (F) ⊆YS(F).
Now suppose that T and S are intertwined by A, as in Observation 2, and
suppose that A is injective (this part of the argument will soon be applied to the
adjoint operators, thus the injectivity assumption, which is dual to the density
assumption of Theorem 24.1.1). If λ ∈σp(T ), then
{0} ̸= ker(T −λ) ⊆XT ({λ})
(the last inclusion is Exercise 24.3.4), and hence {0} ̸= AXT ({λ}) ⊆YS({λ}).
But then, by Observation 1, λ ∈σ(S). We have shown that σp(T ) ⊆σ(S). Since
we have σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σsu(T ), we next consider points of the surjectivity
spectrum σsu(T ).
Continuing for a little while in our dual mode, we impose the assumption
that T has (δ). Let U be an open neighbourhood of σ(S) and pick another open
set V with closure V disjoint from σ(S) such that C = U ∪V. By Observation
1, YS(V ) = {0}, and consequently, by the injectivity of A, also XT (V ) = {0}.
By using (δ), we see that
X = XT (U) + XT (V ) ,
and hence X = XT (U). An immediate consequence of this is that σsu(T ) ⊆U.
Since the set U is an arbitrary neighbourhood of σ(S), we may conclude that
σsu(T ) ⊆σ(S). All in all σ(T ) ⊆σ(S), if T has (δ) and A is injective.
Now we position ourselves in the setting of Theorem 24.1.1, and suppose
that S and T have (β) and that the intertwining maps A and B have dense
ranges. Then S′ and T ′ have (δ), they are intertwined by B′ and A′, and these
two maps are both injective. It follows that σ(T ′) = σ(S′), and consequently
σ(T ) = σ(S).
To establish the claim about the essential spectra and the index, we must
show that if T is Fredholm, then so is S, and ind(T ) ≤ind(S).
If we replace X by T n X, where n is speciﬁed in Proposition 24.1.6, and T
by T | T n X, then this restriction also has (β). Moreover, by Proposition 24.1.4,
T | T n X is a Fredholm operator with the same index as T.
What will change in the passage from S to S | S nY? First of all, S | S nY
inherits (β) from S. Moreover, obviously A | T n X maps into S nY, densely, and
B | S nY maps into T n X, also densely. The originally assumed intertwining

24

relationships hold for the four restrictions. Since T ′n is Fredholm and
A′ ker S ′n ⊆ker T ′n, it follows from the injectivity of the adjoint A ′ that
ker S ∗n is ﬁnite-dimensional. The space S nY is the pre-annihilator of ker S ′n,
hence it is of ﬁnite codimension (this is a consequence of the annihilator the-
orem; see, for example, Laursen and Neumann (2000, Theorem A.1.8)). Thus,
by Proposition 24.1.4, S is Fredholm precisely when S | S nY is Fredholm.
Moreover, when they are, S and S | S nY have the same index.
Consequently, we may continue the argument with T | T n X. Because T has
SVEP, this means that, by Proposition 24.1.6, we may invoke the additional
assumption that T is injective. We shall do this, but continue using the shorter
symbols T, S, A, B, rather than those of their restrictions.
The operator B A commutes with T, and has dense range. Consequently, since
T is injective, Lemma 24.1.7 tells us that there is an open disc V := D(0;r) for
which
(B A) ♦: H(V, X)/TV H(V, X) →H(V, X)/TV H(V, X) ,
deﬁned, as before, by (B A) ♦( f + TV H(V, X)) := (B A) # f + TV H(V, X) for
all f ∈H(V, X), is a bijection.
Since T and S have (β), we know that the ranges TV H(V, X) and SV H(V, Y)
are closed (cf. the remark immediately after Deﬁnition 21.2.1). Hence
H(V, X)/TV H(V, X)
and
H(V, Y)/SV H(V, Y)
are Fr´echet spaces in the natural quotient space topology. By the open mapping
theorem, the continuous bijection (B A) ♦is a topological linear isomorphism.
The canonically deﬁned map
A ♦: H(V, X)/TV H(V, X) →H(V, Y)/SV H(V, Y)
is obviously continuous, and we now show that A ♦is a bijection. Since
(B A) ♦= B ♦A ♦, and (B A) ♦is bijective, A ♦is certainly injective. Moreover,
as a map from the range of A ♦to H(V, X)/TV H(V, X), B ♦is a continuous
bijection. Since the linear span of functions of the form λ →f (λ)y, V →Y (as
f ranges through H(V ) and y through Y) is dense in H(V, Y), and A has dense
range, so does A ♦. But this range is closed because (B A) ♦is a topological
isomorphism (so that the range of A ♦is the pre-image with respect to B ♦of
H(V, X)/TV H(V, X)), and therefore A ♦is surjective. It then follows that also
B ♦: H(V, Y)/SV H(V, Y) →H(V, X)/TV H(V, X)
is bijective.

238
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
Since A ♦is surjective, there is, for every g ∈H(V, Y), a function f in
H(V, X) for which
g −A # f ∈SV H(V, Y).
In particular, if we evaluate this expression at 0, and use the fact that g is
arbitrary, we see that, for every y ∈Y, there are elements x ∈X and z ∈Y so
that y = Sz + Ax. Thus Y = S Y + AX. If F, as before, is a ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace of X for which X = T X ⊕F, then
AX ⊆A T X + AF = SAX + AF ⊆S Y + AF,
and therefore Y = S Y + AF. This shows that S Y is of ﬁnite codimension in
Y. In fact, dim(Y/S Y) ≤dim(AF) ≤dim F.
Moreover, if y ∈ker S and we view y as an analytic function on V, then its
class y + SV H(V, Y) satisﬁes B ♦(y + SV H(V, Y)) = 0; this holds because
T B y = BS y = 0, and T is assumed to be injective. We have already estab-
lished that B ♦is injective, so it follows that y ∈SV H(V, Y), and therefore
y ∈YS({0}) ∩YS(C \ V ) = YS(∅) = {0},
because S has SVEP. This shows that S is injective, and hence establishes that
S is Fredholm. Moreover, it follows that
ind(S) = −dim(Y/SY) ≥−dim F = ind(T ),
and therefore ind(T ) ≤ind(S). By symmetry, we are done.
□
There is an analogous result for operators with (δ). It says that if S ∈B(Y)
and T ∈B(X) both have (δ), and if A ∈B(X, Y) and B ∈B(Y, X) are injective
operators for which SA = AT and T B = BS, then σ(T ) = σ(S), σe(T ) =
σe(S) and
ind(T −λ) = ind(S −λ)
for all λ ∈ρe(T ) .
This is proved by relying heavily on the natural dualities; but you should be
aware that, although the adjoint of an injective operator always has weak-∗
dense range, this range is not necessarily norm-dense. Hence the (δ) result is
not an immediate consequence of Theorem 23.1.5 via the duality between the
properties (β) and (δ). The details may be found in Laursen and Neumann
(2000, Section 3.7).

24.2 Automatic continuity
Automatic continuity theory for homomorphisms and derivations is discussed
in Part I, Chapter 5. Just to give an impression of the kind of automatic con-
tinuity results that may be established on the basis of local spectral theory, I
quote one theorem. There is not sufﬁcient space here to dwell on how it is
proved, but it and others like it may be found in Laursen and Neumann (2000,
Chapter 5). However, signiﬁcant in the arguments is the simple observation that
the algebraic spectral subspaces, discussed immediately after Example 22.2.5,
have the property (analogous to what is true for both the local and the glocal
spectral subspaces and continuous , in the notation of this next theorem) that
ET (F) ⊆ES(F), when S = T.
Theorem 24.2.1
Suppose that T ∈B(X) is decomposable, while S ∈B(Y)
is generalized scalar. Suppose also that  : X →Y is a linear transformation
for which S = T. Then there is a ﬁnite set  ⊂C such that |XT (F) is
continuous for every closed F ⊆C which is disjoint from . Moreover, there
is a non-zero polynomial p, all of whose roots are eigenvalues of S, such that
the composition p(S) : X →Y is continuous. In particular,  is continuous
if S has no eigenvalues.
□
The ﬁnite set  is called the singularity set. The condition on T may be
relaxed to that of assuming (δ), while that on S could be replaced by super-
decomposable and ES(∅) = {0}, and even more general conditions. For other
results on automatic continuity, see Part I, Chapter 5.
24.3 Exercises
1. Show that, if the range T X of the operator T is of ﬁnite codimension in X,
then the range is automatically closed.
2. Referring to the proof of Theorem 24.1.6, assume that T is Fredholm. Prove
that R := T | T ∞X is surjective and Fredholm.
3. (cf. the exercise before Proposition 22.1.3) Show that, if R is a surjective,
non-injective operator, then there is a power series with sum f, say, for which
(R −µ) f (µ) = 0 in a neighbourhood of 0.
4. Prove the inclusion ker(T −λ) ⊆XT ({λ}) for an arbitrary operator T .
24.4 Additional notes
The issue of spectral overlaps has received a lot of attention. For general Banach
spaces, the classical Lumer and Rosenblum (1959) result says that two operators

240
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
(S, T ) intertwined by a non-zero intertwiner must have overlapping spectra, and
this result was reﬁned by Davis and Rosenthal (1974) to σsu(T ) ∩σap(S) ̸= ∅.
Both of these results are provable, in even greater generality, by local spectral
methods. Laursen and Neumann (2000, Chapter 3) has details, and work on this
may also be found in Laursen and Neumann (1994): it is not even necessary to
suppose that SA = AT . There are ways of saying how close parts of the two
spectra must be in terms of the commutator SA −AT.
Fialkow (1977) also showed that, in contrast to Example 24.1.2, the essential
spectra of arbitrary quasi-similar operators on a separable Hilbert space always
have non-empty intersection. Moreover, Herrero (1988) showed that, for every
pair of quasi-similar operators T ∈B(X) and S ∈B(Y) on the Banach spaces
X and Y, each connected component of σe(T ) touches σe(S), and vice versa.
This result now has an attractive sheaf-theoretic proof (see Eschmeier 2000).
In this chapter we presented a proof of the (β) part of Theorem 24.1.1.
This proof is quite elementary compared with previous ones. Theorem 24.1.1
has a background that may be traced to a problem from Clary (1975): having
established the equality of the spectra for quasi-similar hyponormal opera-
tors (hyponormal T means that the commutator T ∗T −T T ∗≥0), Clary asked
whether this extends to the essential spectra. This problem received consider-
able attention. The ﬁnal solution, due to Putinar (1992) and, independently, to
Yang (1993), revealed that the assumption of hyponormal is not really needed:
all that matters is that hyponormal operators have (β). But generally, of course,
Hilbert space operators have their own theory.

Multipliers on commutative Banach algebras
25.1 Multipliers
In this chapter I want to give an impression of what sort of information becomes
available via local spectral theory when it is applied to a particular class of op-
erators, namely the multipliers on a commutative Banach algebra. Throughout
this chapter, the letter A will denote a commutative, complex Banach algebra.
Deﬁnition 25.1.1
A linear map T : A →A is a multiplier if aT (b) = T (a)b
for all a, b ∈A. The set of multipliers on A is denoted by M(A).
The most obvious example, given A, is the multiplication operator La in-
duced by a ﬁxed element a ∈A, that is, the operator La(b) := ab for all b ∈A.
If A has a unit e (A is unital) then every multiplier T is a multiplication operator.
In this case T = LT (e) (Exercise 25.3.2).
If the map a →La : A →B(A) is injective (faithful), then A is said to be
a faithful algebra. Every unital algebra is faithful, as is every semisimple, and
also every semiprime algebra – the latter term means, in our commutative case,
that the algebra contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.
Example 25.1.2
Let A := C0(
) be the Banach algebra of all continuous
complex-valued functions vanishing at ∞on the locally compact Hausdorff
space 
, and let f ∈Cb(
) be a bounded continuous function on 
. Then
T := L f (notation self-explanatory by now) is a multiplier. Conversely, it can
be shown that a multiplier gives rise to a bounded continuous function on 
with respect to which the multiplier acts by pointwise multiplication (Exercise
25.3.4).
□
The group algebras are perhaps the most important class of examples.
241

242
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
Example 25.1.3
Let G be a locally compact abelian group, with Haar measure
m, and let L1(G) denote the group algebra of G, as described in Parts I and II.
Also let M(G) denote the measure algebra, that is, the algebra of all bounded,
regular,complex-valuedmeasureson G.Equippedwiththetotalvariationnorm,
given by ∥µ∥:= |µ| (G), M(G) is a commutative unital Banach algebra (point
mass at the unit e ∈G is the identity) and since the convolution of an element
f ∈L1(G) and a measure µ ∈M(G),
( f ⋆µ)(s) =

G
f (st−1) dµ(t) ,
is an element in L1(G), we see that every µ ∈M(G) deﬁnes a multiplier on
L1(G). It is a classical result of Wendel (1952) and of Helson (1953) (see
Theorem 9.1.11) that all multipliers on L1(G) arise this way. This shows that
M(L1(G)) = M(G).
□
The next result (the proof of which is left to the reader, Exercise 25.3.5)
claims, inter alia, that M(A) is a full subalgebra of B(A). This means that, if
T ∈M(A) is invertible as an operator on A, that is, invertible in B(A), then
T −1 ∈M(A). You should also note that the deﬁnition of a multiplier does
not require the map to be a priori continuous, so the proposition contains an
automatic continuity result.
Proposition 25.1.4
Let A be faithful. Then the multiplier algebra M(A) is a
closed, commutative, unital, full subalgebra of B(A) which contains A as an
ideal.
□
Here is our ﬁrst explicit allusion to local spectral theory.
Proposition 25.1.5
Let A be semiprime. Then every multiplier T ∈M(A) has
SVEP.
Proof We observe, to begin with, that ker T ∩T A = {0}: if u ∈ker T ∩T A,
then T u = 0 and u = T v for some v ∈A; hence (T v)2 = (T 2v) v = 0 v = 0,
and therefore u = T v = 0, since A contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.
Now, on an open subset U of the complex plane we consider an analytic
function f : U →A such that (T −λ) f (λ) = 0 for all λ ∈U. For each λ ∈U,
it is clear that f (λ) ∈ker(T −λ); moreover f (λ) ∈(T −λ)A, by Lemma 22.1,
and so
f (λ) ∈ker(T −λ) ∩(T −λ)A = {0} ,
since T −λ is also a multiplier. Thus f (λ) = 0 for all λ ∈U. This proves that
T has SVEP.

We next proceed to study the extent to which decomposability is transferred
by algebra homomorphisms. This development has some of the same ﬂavour
as Theorem 22.2.4. We suppose that A is faithful and that ϕ : A →B(X) is an
algebra homomorphism. This turns X into a left A-module, with module action
deﬁned by a · x := ϕ(a)x for all a ∈A and x ∈X. Although the following
facts may be established without continuity assumptions about ϕ, the simpler
proofs presented here cover only this case.
As our ﬁrst step we extend the homomorphism ϕ from A to its multiplier
algebra M(A). For this to go through, we shall impose two conditions. The ﬁrst
condition is one of non-degeneracy.
Deﬁnition 25.1.6
The left A-module X is non-degenerate if, for each non-zero
x ∈X, there exists an element a ∈A for which a · x is non-zero.
We also say that the homomorphism ϕ is non-degenerate. Note that when
the algebra A is viewed as a module over itself (with module action given by
the algebra multiplication), non-degeneracy is the same as faithfulness.
In the non-degenerate case, there is at most one algebra homomorphism
 : M(A) →B(X)
that extends ϕ, in the sense that (La) = ϕ(a) for all a ∈A. Indeed, if 1 and
2 are two such extensions, then
ϕ(a) (1(S)x −2(S)x) = ϕ(Sa)x −ϕ(Sa)x = 0
for all S ∈M(A), x ∈X,
and
a ∈A,
and therefore 1 = 2 if ϕ is non-degenerate. Non-degenerateness will also,
with much the same argument, establish that the extension  of ϕ maps the
identity operator on A to the identity operator on X.
We shall also assume about the module action that AX = X. Here, for arbi-
trary subsets B ⊆A and Y ⊆X, we deﬁne
BY = lin{b · y; b ∈B and y ∈Y } ,
where lin denotes the linear span. Evidently, the condition that AX = X is
fulﬁlled whenever  {ran ϕ(a) : a ∈A} = X.
If A has an identity element e, and if ϕ(e) = IX, then X is clearly non-
degenerate and satisﬁes AX = X. Actually, these two conditions are fulﬁlled
in lots of situations: for instance, if the homomorphism ϕ is continuous, and if
A has a bounded approximate identity (eλ)λ∈ for which ϕ(eλ)x →x for each

244
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
x ∈X, then the left A-module X is obviously non-degenerate, and the Cohen
factorization theorem implies that AX = X.
Lemma 25.1.7
Let A be faithful, and consider an algebra homomorphism
ϕ : A →B(X) which provides us with the module action a · x := ϕ(a)x for
all a ∈A and x ∈X. Suppose that X is non-degenerate and that AX = X. If
x ∈Xis represented as x = n
k=1 ϕ(ak)xk with ak ∈A and xk ∈X for each
k = 1, . . . , n, and if we deﬁne
(S)x :=
n

k=1
ϕ(Sak)xk
for all S ∈M(A), then  : M(A) →B(X) is a unital algebra homomorphism
that extends ϕ, in the sense that (La) = ϕ(a) for every a ∈A. The extension
 is continuous on M(A) if and only if ϕ is continuous on A.
Proof
Let S ∈M(A). First we must make sure that the above deﬁnition of
(S) : X →X makes sense: since AX = X, every element x ∈X has a repre-
sentation x = n
k=1 ϕ(ak)xk, so if  n
k=1 ϕ(ak)xk = 0, then, for every a ∈A,
we see that
ϕ(a)
 n

k=1
ϕ(Sak)xk

= ϕ(Sa)
 n

k=1
ϕ(ak)xk

= 0 ,
because ϕ is a homomorphism and S is a multiplier. The module X is non-
degenerate, so this implies that  n
k=1 ϕ(Sak)xk = 0.
The linearity of the operator (S) is immediate, and, by the closed graph
theorem, (S) is continuous: if un →0 in A and (S)un →v in X, then
clearly, for each a ∈A, ϕ(Sa)un →0 and ϕ(a)(S)un →ϕ(a)v as n →∞.
But a computation similar to the one above shows that
ϕ(a)(S)un = ϕ(Sa)un
for all n ∈N .
Thus ϕ(a)v = 0 for each a ∈A, and therefore v = 0 by non-degeneracy.
It is straightforward to check that  is a unital algebra homomorphism that
extends ϕ, and it is clear that ϕ is continuous whenever  is. On the other
hand, if ϕ is continuous on A, then, for every x ∈X, the deﬁning expression
for (S)x shows that the map S →(S)x is continuous on M(A). This, by the
principle of uniform boundedness, is enough to establish continuity of .
□
The following theorem is a key result for the preservation of decomposability
under homomorphisms. I have chosen to show only a special case; there is a

25

245
rather more elaborate version of it, avoiding continuity assumptions on ϕ, in
Laursen and Neumann (2000, Lemma 4.2.4).
Theorem 25.1.8
Let A have a bounded approximate identity (eλ)λ∈ and
ϕ : A →B(X) be a continuous algebra homomorphism for which ϕ(eλ)x →x
for each x ∈X. If S ∈M(A) is a multiplier with (δ) and SVEP, then the operator
T := (S) ∈B(X) is decomposable, and
XT (F) = {x ∈X : ϕ(a)x = 0 for all a ∈A for which σS(a) ∩F = ∅} ,
for all closed sets F ⊆C.
Proof
We shall establish the decomposability of T by checking the very
deﬁnition,
and
show
that
the
spaces
ZT (F) := {x ∈X : ϕ(a)x = 0
for all a ∈A for which σS(a) ∩F = ∅} give us the claimed spectral sub-
spaces.
Right away we note that, for every closed set F ⊆C, ZT (F) is a closed
linear subspace of X with the property that (R) ZT (F) ⊆ZT (F) for each
R ∈M(A). In particular, ZT (F) is T -invariant.
We ﬁrst show that X = ZT (U) + ZT (V ) for every open cover {U, V } of C.
By Cohen’s factorization theorem, AX = X, and we may represent an arbitrary
x ∈X as x = ϕ(a0)x0 with a0 ∈A and x0 ∈X. Since S has (δ), there exist ele-
ments u0, v0 ∈A for which σS(u0) ⊆U, σS(v0) ⊆V , and a0 = u0 + v0. Thus
x = ϕ(u0)x0 + ϕ(v0)x0. We claim that ϕ(u0)x0 belongs to ZT (U): consider an
arbitrary a ∈A with the property that σS(a) ∩U = ∅. Since
σS(au0) ⊆σS(a) ∩σS(u0) ⊆σS(a) ∩U = ∅,
au0 = 0, because S has SVEP. This implies that ϕ(a)ϕ(u0)x0 = 0, and hence
we have u ∈ZT (U). The same argument shows that v ∈ZT (V ). We have
proved that
X = ZT (U) + ZT (V ) .
We now claim that σ(T | ZT (F)) ⊆F for every closed set F ⊆C. To es-
tablish this, ﬁx an arbitrary open neighbourhood U of F, and observe that
AZT (F) = ZT (F),againbyCohenfactorization.Hence,givenany x ∈ZT (F),
we have a representation of the form x = ϕ(a)z with a ∈A and z ∈ZT (F).
Since S has (δ) and C = U ∪(C \ F), we may write a = u + v with u, v ∈A
chosen so that σS(u) ⊆U and σS(v) ∩F = ∅. Because z is in ZT (F), we know
that ϕ(v)z = 0, and hence x = ϕ(u)z. Since S has SVEP, and σS(u) ⊆U, there
is an analytic function f : C \ U →A for which (S −λ) f (λ) = u for every

246
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
λ ∈C \ U. Now apply the homomorphism ; this gives
(T −λ)ϕ( f (λ)) = ϕ(u),
and therefore (T −λ)yλ = x, where we set yλ := ϕ( f (λ))z ∈ZT (F) for all
λ ∈C \ U. Consequently, for each λ ∈C \ U, the operator T −λ maps ZT (F)
onto itself.
Additionally, it does it injectively. To see this, let
λ ∈C \ U
and
z ∈ZT (F) ∩ker(T −λ) .
Since X is non-degenerate, it sufﬁces to show that ϕ(a)z = 0 for each a ∈A.
Clearly x := ϕ(a)z belongs to ZT (F). Hence the preceding argument supplies
an analytic function f : C \ U →A for which (T −λ)ϕ( f (λ))z = x. Thus
x = ϕ( f (λ))(T −λ)z = 0 ,
proving that (T −λ) | ZT (F) is injective. It follows that σ(T | ZT (F)) ⊆U for
every open neighbourhood U of F, and therefore that σ(T | ZT (F)) ⊆F.
We conclude that T is decomposable, and that ZT (F) ⊆XT (F) for every
closed set F ⊆C.
The opposite inclusion ZT (F) ⊇XT (F) follows easily from the continuity
of ϕ. In fact, given any x ∈XT (F) and a ∈A for which σS(a) ∩F = ∅, we
obtain from the continuity of ϕ that ρS(a) ⊆ρT (ϕ(a)x), and hence that
σT (ϕ(a)x) ⊆σS(a) ∩σT (x) ⊆σS(a) ∩F = ∅.
Since T has SVEP, this implies that ϕ(a)x = 0, and consequently x ∈ZT (F).
□
Here is a pleasing observation which is immediate from what we have said
so far.
Corollary 25.1.9
Let A have a bounded approximate identity. Then a multi-
plier on A is decomposable if and only if it has (δ) and SVEP. In particular, if A
is also semiprime, a multiplier on A is decomposable precisely when it has (δ).
Proof
Simply let ϕ : A →B(A) be the left regular representation given by
ϕ(a) := La for all a ∈A. Then ϕ is a continuous algebra homomorphism, and
the extension of ϕ to the multiplier algebra M(A), as in Lemma 25.1.7, is
the identity map on M(A). By Theorem 25.1.8, every multiplier on A with
(δ) and SVEP is decomposable. The last statement is immediate from this in
conjunction with Proposition 25.1.5.

25.2 The hull-kernel topology
The second main result of this chapter is Theorem 25.2.2. To appreciate all of it,
it is necessary to realize that, in addition to the Gelfand topology, there is another
topology on the character space A of A. And it is also worth knowing that
the condition of continuity of the Gelfand transform of a given algebra element
with respect to this other topology, which is the main assumption of Theorem
25.2.2, is really a decomposability condition in disguise: in Proposition 25.2.5
it is established that, if A is faithful and if T ∈M(A) is a multiplier with (δ),
then the restriction T | A is hk-continuous. This of course applies in particular
to a multiplication operator.
The topology that we are referring to is introduced in the next proposition,
stated here without proof; it is called the hull-kernel topology, or hk-topology,
of A. This topology is deﬁned via speciﬁcation of the closure of any given
subset of the character space. This involves the following steps, already given
as Exercise 3.6.1 in Part I. For a set S ⊆A, the kernel of S is the ideal of A
deﬁned as
k(S) := {a ∈A : ϕ(a) = 0 for all ϕ ∈S} ,
and, symmetrically, for an ideal J ⊆A, the hull of J in A is
h(J) := {ϕ ∈A : ϕ(a) = 0 for all a ∈J} .
For an arbitrary subset S of A, we then deﬁne the hk-closure of S by
hk(S) := h(k(S)) = {ϕ ∈A : a(ϕ) = 0 for all a ∈A with a ≡0 on S} .
Proposition 25.2.1
Let A be a commutative complex algebra. The sets of the
form hk(S), where S ranges over the subsets of the character space A, are the
closed sets of a topology, the hk-topology of A. This topology has the following
properties:
(i) for any S ⊆A, the closure of S in the hk-topology is precisely hk(S);
(ii) the hk-topology is coarser than (or equal to) the Gelfand topology.
□
As noted in Part I, these two topologies coincide exactly when A is regular
(regular: whenever F is a Gelfand closed subset of A and ϕ ∈A\F then
there is a ∈A for which a vanishes on F, but not at ϕ).
With these basic facts listed, we can state the theorem.
Theorem 25.2.2
Suppose that A is semisimple and that a ∈A is an element
for which a is hk-continuous on A. Then, for an arbitrary homomorphism

ϕ : A →B(X), the operator ϕ(a) ∈B(X) is super-decomposable on X. If,
additionally, ϕ is non-degenerate, then
Xϕ(a)(F) =
{x ∈X : ϕ(u)x = 0 for every u ∈A for which a (supp u) ∩F = ∅} .
Note that one consequence of this is that, if a ∈A is an element for which
a is hk-continuous on A, then a deﬁnes a super-decomposable multiplication
operator on A. The converse is also true, as we shall see in Proposition 25.2.5.
The proof of Theorem 25.2.2 comes after the next two lemmas. Both of these
are classical; see Laursen and Neumann (2000, Section 4.3).
Lemma 25.2.3
The following statements are true for every commutative
Banach algebra A.
(i) If S is a compact hull in A, and if S ⊆U1 ∪· · · ∪Un for ﬁnitely many
hk-open sets U1, . . ., Un ⊆A, then there are elements u1, . . ., un ∈A such
that u1 + · · · +un ≡1 on S and uk ≡0 on A \ Uk for k = 1, . . ., n.
(ii) If S1 and S2 are two disjoint hulls in A, and if S1 is compact in the
Gelfand topology, then there is an element u ∈A for which u ≡1 on S1 and
u ≡0 on S2.
(iii) If S ⊆A is a hull such that there exist v ∈A and δ > 0 for which
|v | ≥δ on S, then there is an element w ∈A for which 
vw ≡1 on S.
□
Lemma 25.2.4
Suppose that A is semisimple and has an identity element
e, and suppose that ϕ : A →B(X) is a homomorphism such that ϕ(e) = I.
Moreover, let a ∈A be an element for which a is hk-continuous on A. Then,
for every open cover {U, V } of C, there exists an element r ∈A for which
r ≡0 on a −1(C \ U), and for which r ≡1 on a −1(C \ V ), and is such that
σ(T | RX) ⊆U and σ(T | (I −R)X) ⊆V, where R, T ∈B(X) denote the
commuting operators given by R := ϕ(r) and T := ϕ(a).
Proof Start with the open cover {U, V } of C. Choose open sets G, H ⊆C for
which G ⊆U, H ⊆V, and G ∪H = C. Since the complements C \ G and
C \ H are closed and disjoint, hk-continuity of a implies that their preimages
a −1(C \ G) anda −1(C \ H) are hulls in A, of course also disjoint. Moreover,
since A has an identity, both sets are compact in the Gelfand topology of the
compact space A. Consequently, by Lemma 25.2.3 (ii), there is r ∈A for
which r ≡0 on a −1(C \ G) and r ≡1 on a −1(C \ H). Evidently, r satisﬁes

25

249
the ﬁrst two conditions of this lemma, and the operator R := ϕ(r) commutes
with T := ϕ(a).
To show that σ(T | RX) ⊆U, look at an arbitrary λ ∈C \ U. The distance δ
from λ to G is strictly positive. Furthermore, |a −λe| ≥δ on the hulla −1(G).
Hence, by Lemma 25.2.3 (iii), there is a uλ ∈A for which
(a −λ) 
uλ ≡1
on
a −1(G) .
Since r ≡0 on a −1(C \ G), the identity (a −λ) 
uλr ≡r holds everywhere
on the character space A. Thus (a −λ)uλr = r, by semisimplicity of A.
Now apply the homomorphism ϕ to the last identity. If Uλ := ϕ(uλ) ∈B(X),
then
(T −λ)Uλ(Rx) = Uλ(T −λ)(Rx) = Rx
for all x ∈X ,
and therefore (T −λ)Uλ = Uλ(T −λ) = I on RX. This space is Uλ-invariant,
so λ ∈ρ(T | RX). This proves that σ(T | RX) ⊆U. A similar argument will
show that σ(T | (I −R)X) ⊆V.
□
Proof of Theorem 25.2.2
First extend the homomorphism ϕ to the unitization
A# = A ⊕C by deﬁning
(u + λe) := ϕ(u) + λI
for all u ∈A and λ ∈C.
Clearly,  : A# →B(X) is a homomorphism with (e) = I and (u) = ϕ(u)
for all u ∈A. It may be shown thata remains hk-continuous on A#, so Lemma
25.2.4 establishes the super-decomposability of T.
To prove the formula for the local spectral subspaces of T when ϕ is assumed
non-degenerate, we consider, for each closed set F ⊆C, the space
ZT (F) := {x ∈X : ϕ(u)x = 0 for all u ∈A for which a (suppu) ∩F = ∅} .
This is the space which is claimed to equal XT (F). Note that ZT (F) consists of
all x ∈X which satisfy ϕ(u)x = 0 for all u ∈A for which u ≡0 on a −1(U)
for some open neighbourhood U of F, depending on u.
The equality XT (F) = ZT (F) is established in several steps. The ﬁrst step
is to show that ZT (F) ∩ZT (G) = {0} for arbitrary closed and disjoint F, G in
C. No number can belong to both F and G, so we may as well suppose that
0 /∈F. Then we may select open sets U, V ⊆C such that F ⊆U, G ⊆V,
0 /∈U, and U ∩V = ∅. By the hk-continuity ofa on A, the setsa −1(U) and

250
Part IV
Local spectral theory, Kjeld Bagger Laursen
a −1(V ) are disjoint hulls in A. Moreover, if δ denotes the positive distance
from 0 to U, then |a| ≥δ on a −1(U). This shows that a −1(U) is Gelfand
compact in A. By Lemma 25.2.3 (ii), there is an element u ∈A for which
u ≡1 on a −1(U)
and
u ≡0 on a −1(V ) .
Hence, for arbitrary c ∈A, we have that c −
cu ≡0 on a −1(U) and 
cu ≡0
on a −1(V ). For every x ∈ZT (F) ∩ZT (G), we get both that ϕ(c −cu)x = 0,
and ϕ(cu)x = 0, and consequently that ϕ(c)x = 0 for all c ∈A. The homo-
morphism ϕ is non-degenerate, so it follows that x = 0. Thus we have as our
ﬁrst step that the spaces ZT (F) and ZT (G) have trivial intersection.
The next step consists in showing that XT (F) ⊆ZT (F) for every closed set
F ⊆C. To this end, consider an arbitrary u ∈A for which u ≡0 on a −1(U)
for some open neighbourhood U of F, and choose an open set V ⊆C so
that F ∩V = ∅and U ∪V = C. We now apply Lemma 25.2.4 to the open
cover {U, V } of C and to the unitization of A and ϕ. Let r ∈A# denote the
corresponding element provided by Lemma 25.2.4. Sincer ≡0 ona −1(C \ U),
wehavethat
ur ≡0onA,andhence,bysemisimplicity,ur = 0.Furthermore,
with R := ϕ(r) ∈B(X), σ(T | (I −R)X) ⊆V, and so (I −R)X ⊆XT (V ).
Because R T = T R, this implies that
(I −R)XT (F) ⊆XT (F) ∩XT (V ) = XT (F ∩V ) = XT (∅) = {0} .
For each x ∈XT (F), we conclude that (I −R)x = 0, hence x = Rx, and
therefore ϕ(u)x = ϕ(u)Rx = ϕ(ur)x = 0. Thus x ∈ZT (F), and this shows
that XT (F) ⊆ZT (F).
It remains to establish that ZT (F) ⊆XT (F), for every closed set F ⊆C. For
thisitisenoughtoprovethat ZT (F) ⊆XT (U),foreveryopenneighbourhoodU
of F. As in the preceding paragraph, givenU, we may choose an open V ⊆C for
which F ∩V = ∅and U ∪V = C, and put R := (r) ∈B(X), where r ∈A#
denotes the element provided by Lemma 25.2.4, again applied to the open cover
{U, V } of C and to the unitization of A and ϕ. The two spectral inclusions from
Lemma 25.2.4 imply that R X ⊆XT (U) and (I −R) X ⊆XT (V ). Moreover,
it is clear that the space ZT (F) is invariant under R. Gathering the results of
the preceding two paragraphs, we obtain
(I −R) ZT (F) ⊆ZT (F) ∩XT (V ) ⊆ZT (F) ∩ZT (V ) = {0} ,
and consequently ZT (F) = R ZT (F) ⊆XT (U). This completes the proof of
the inclusion ZT (F) ⊆XT (F).

I want to conclude this chapter by stating a converse to Theorem 25.2.2. As a
consequence of this, and because (as pointed out in connection with Proposition
25.2.1) there is a close connection between equality of the two topologies on
A and regularity of A, we obtain a nice result that expresses this connection
in terms of decomposability.
Proposition 25.2.5
Suppose that A is faithful and that T ∈M(A) is a multi-
plier with (δ). Then the restriction T | A is hk-continuous.
Proof Given any closed F ⊆C. Our task is to show that
E := {ϕ ∈A : T (ϕ) ∈F}
is hk-closed.
So consider any ψ ∈A \ E, and choose an x ∈A so that ψ(x) = 1. Since
λ := T (ψ) does not belong to F, there exists an open cover {U, V } of C for
which U ⊆C \ {λ} and V ⊆C \ F. By (δ), we may decompose x = y + z,
with y ∈AT (U) and z ∈AT (V ). Since λ /∈U and y ∈AT (U), we know that
y = (T −λ)u for some u ∈A, and therefore
ψ(y) = (T (ψ) −λ) ψ(u) = 0.
Thus ψ(z) = ψ(x) = 1. On the other hand, for any ϕ ∈E, clearly µ := T (ϕ)
belongs to F, and hence not to V . Since z ∈AT (V ), z = (T −µ)v for suitable
v ∈A, and therefore
ϕ(z) = (T (ϕ) −µ) ϕ(v) = 0 .
Since ϕ(z) = 0 for all ϕ ∈E and ψ(z) = 1, we see that ψ /∈hk(E). Thus the
set E = hk(E) is closed, and we have established the hk-continuity of T | A.
□
Corollary 25.2.6
Suppose that A is semisimple. Then A is regular if and only
if, for every a ∈A, the multiplication operator La is decomposable.
Proof If A is regular then, by the remark immediately after Proposition 25.2.1,
a is hk-continuous for every a ∈A.
Conversely, if every La is decomposable then Proposition 25.2.5 implies that
a is hk-continuous for every a ∈A. But the Gelfand topology is, by deﬁnition,
the coarsest topology on A for which all these functions are continuous. Con-
sequently, the hk-topology coincides with the Gelfand topology on A. By the
remark after Proposition 25.2.1, this establishes the regularity of A.

25.4 Additional notes
Concerning examples of non-degenerate modules, it is easily seen that X is non-
degenerate and satisﬁes AX = X whenever the left A-module X is irreducible;
see Proposition 24.4 of Bonsall and Duncan (1973).
The best results about decomposability of multipliers are obtained when
certain vanishing-at-inﬁnity conditions are imposed.
Deﬁnition 25.4.1
Suppose that A is semisimple and has multiplier algebra
M(A), and character space A (respectively, M(A)). Then
M0(A) := {T ∈M(A) : T |A vanishes at inﬁnity on A ⊆M(A)}
and
M00(A) := {T ∈M(A) : T vanishes on M(A)\A} .
In the simple case of A = C(
), where 
 is a locally compact Hausdorff
space, it is easy to picture these two ideals. Evidently, we always have
A ⊆M00(A) ⊆M0(A) ⊆M(A) ,

25

and in general all these containments are strict; notably, this holds when
A = L1(G) is the group algebra for a locally compact, non-discrete, abelian
group.
The next result, and its proof, may be found in Laursen and Neumann (2000,
Theorem 4.5.4).
Theorem 25.4.2
Let A be semisimple. For T ∈M0(A), the following are
equivalent:
(a) T is super-decomposable on A;
(b) T is decomposable on A;
(c) T has (δ);
(d) T ∈M00(A) and T |A is hk-continuous on A;
(e) T is hk-continuous on M(A);
(f) multiplication by T is decomposable on M(A).
In the case where A is also regular, T ∈M0(A) satisﬁes all these conditions
exactly when T ∈M00(A).

Appendix to Part IV: The functional model
The following material forms a key background to our subject; a fuller account
of it is given in Laursen and Neumann (2000, Chapter 2).
We ﬁrst review some notions from the theory of scalar-valued functions and
distributions in two variables. Fuller expositions of this may also be found in
Rudin (1991) and Tr`eves (1967).
As before, we identify C and R2, write z = x + i y = (x, y) for z ∈C and
x, y ∈R, and let ∂x and ∂y denote the usual operators of partial differentiation
with respect to x and y, acting on functions of the real variables x and y. In
Chapter 21 we touched on C ∞(C), in particular the notation
D α := ∂α1
x ∂α2
y , |α| := α1 + α2
and
α! := α1! α2!
for every pair α = (α1, α2) ∈(Z+)2. We then consider, for a compact subset K
of C, the space of smooth functions
D(K) := { f ∈C ∞(C) : supp f ⊆K} ,
topologized by the submultiplicative seminorms given by
∥f ∥m,K :=

|α|≤m
1
α! sup {|D α f (z)| : z ∈K}
for all f ∈C ∞(C) and m ∈Z+. Thus the convergence of a sequence ( fn)n∈N
in D(K) with respect to this topology is that of uniform convergence of all
sequences of derivatives (D α fn)n∈N, for every α ∈(Z+)2. It is a standard fact
that D(K) is a Fr´echet space.
For an open subset U of C, we choose a sequence of compact sets
(Kn)n∈N such that Kn ⊂int Kn+1 for all n ∈N and U =  {Kn : n ∈N} ,
and let D(U) := ∞
n=1 D(Kn). This space we topologize as the locally convex
254

25
Multipliers on commutative Banach algebras
255
inductive limit of the spaces D(Kn), which means that a set in D(U) is open if
and only if its intersection with every D(Kn) is open (this deﬁnition does not
depend on the choice of the sequence (Kn)n∈N). Moreover, a linear map from
D(U) into an arbitrary locally convex topological vector space is continuous if
and only if its restriction to D(K) is continuous for every compact subset K of
U. Topologized this way, the space D(U) is the space of test functions on U.
The space of continuous linear functionals on D(U), customarily denoted by
D ′(U), is the space of distributions on U.
Adistributionϕ ∈D ′(U)issaidtovanishonanopensubset V ofU ifϕ( f ) =
0 for all f ∈D(V ). There is a largest open set V ⊆U on which ϕ vanishes,
and the complement of this set with respect to U is called the support of ϕ, and
will be denoted by supp ϕ. Evidently, supp ϕ is a relatively closed subset of U.
If g : U →C is locally integrable with respect to the restriction of two-
dimensional Lebesgue measure µ, then g induces a distribution ϕ ∈D ′(U) via
the formula
ϕ( f ) :=

U
g f dµ
for all f ∈D(U) .
Since two locally integrable functions induce the same distribution exactly
when they coincide almost everywhere with respect to µ, this formula leads to
a canonical embedding of the space L 1
loc(U) into D ′(U), where L 1
loc(U) consists
of all equivalence classes modulo µ of the locally integrable functions on U. In
particular, each element of L 1
loc(U) has a support in the sense of distributions.
It also follows that each of the spaces C(U) and L p(U) (1 ≤p < ∞) may be
regarded as a linear subspace of D ′(U). Here of course L p(U) is the classical
Banach space of all pth power integrable complex-valued functions on U (with
two functions identiﬁed when they coincide almost everywhere with respect to
Lebesgue measure). The fact that all pth power integrable functions on U are
locally integrable is a consequence of H¨older’s inequality. For the space L ∞(U)
of all µ-essentially bounded measurable complex-valued functions on U, it is
immediate that L ∞(U) is contained in L 1
loc(U), and hence in D ′(U).
We equip D ′(U) with the strong topology, that is, the topology of uniform
convergence on the bounded subsets of D(U).
It is immediate that, for every α ∈(Z+)2, the differential operator D α deﬁnes
a continuous linear map on D(K) for each compact subset K of U, and hence
on D(U). To extend this differential operator from D(U) to the larger space
D ′(U), one uses the notion of a signed adjoint: for each ϕ ∈D ′(U), let
(D αϕ) ( f ) := (−1)|α| ϕ (D α f )
for all f ∈D(U).
It is obvious that D αϕ ∈D ′(U).

256

Given a function g ∈C m(U) for some m ∈N, integration by parts leads to

U
(D αg) f dµ = (−1)|α|

U
g D αf dµ
for all f ∈D(U) and α ∈(Z+)2 with |α| ≤m. It follows that, for |α| ≤m, the
distribution induced by the function D αg ∈C(U) coincides with the distribu-
tional derivative D αϕ of the distribution ϕ corresponding to g. This justiﬁes
the factor (−1)|α| in the deﬁnition of the distributional derivative, and shows
that differentiation in the sense of distributions extends the usual notion of
differentiation for continuously differentiable functions.
An important tool in the theory of partial differential equations is the class of
Sobolevspaces.FollowingTr`eves(1967),theclassicalSobolevspace H m(U)of
order m ∈Z+ consists of all functions f ∈L 2(U) for which the distributional
derivative D α f belongs to L 2(U) for every α ∈(Z+)2 with |α| ≤m. Of course,
here the space L 2(U) is considered as a linear subspace of D ′(U).
Weshallneedavariantofthis,moreconvenientforthestudyofthe∂-operator.
As usual, let
∂:= (∂x + i ∂y)/2
and
∂:= (∂x −i ∂y)/2.
As we have just explained, these differential operators (and their powers) are
canonically deﬁned on the space D ′(U), and hence act, in the sense of distribu-
tions, on functions in L 2(U). Be aware, however, that, for arbitrary f ∈L 2(U),
the distributions ∂f and ∂f need not be implemented by functions in L 2(U).
For every m ∈Z+, our Sobolev-like space of order m is deﬁned as
W m(U) := { f ∈L 2(U) : ∂
kf ∈L 2(U) for k = 0, . . . , m}.
The proof of the following result may be found in Laursen and Neumann (2000).

The connection between distributional and old-fashioned differentiation is
described very well by the Sobolev embedding theorem.
Proposition A.2
The inclusion W m+2(U) ⊆C m(U) holds for every open set
U ⊆C and every m ∈Z+.
□
We proceed now to the vector-valued situation, and let L 2(U, X) denote the
space of all X-valued measurable functions on U (here X is a given complex
Banach space and U an open subset of C) which are Bochner square-integrable
with respect to two-dimensional Lebesgue measure µ on U. With respect to the
norm given by
∥f ∥2 :=
	 
U
∥f (ζ)∥2 dµ(ζ)

1/2
for all f ∈L 2(U, X) ,
L 2(U, X) is a Banach space. Concerning integration of functions with values in
a Banach space, it may be sufﬁcient here to indicate what is involved by referring
to a classical result due to Pettis (Dunford and Schwartz 1958, Theorem 3.6.11),
which shows that an X-valued function f on U is measurable (with respect to
µ) if and only if it is µ-essentially separably valued in X and has µ-measurable
composition ϕ ◦f with every continuous linear functional ϕ on X.
For every m ∈Z+, we deﬁne the vector-valued Sobolev-like space
W m(U, X) := { f ∈L 2(U, X) : ∂
kf ∈L 2(U, X)
for k = 0, . . ., m} ,
where the differential operator ∂:= (∂x + ∂y)/2 is of course taken distribution-
ally. A result like Proposition A.1 will then show that W m(U, X) is a Banach
space when endowed with the obvious norm.
If X is a Hilbert space, then so are the two spaces L 2(U, X) and W m(U, X)
with respect to the canonical inner product.
Next we mention a vector analogue of the Sobolev embedding theorem,
sufﬁcient for our purposes. This one relates the Sobolev-like spaces to the space
C ∞(U, X) of all inﬁnitely differentiable X-valued functions on U. This space
is a Fr´echet space with respect to the topology of locally uniform convergence
for the functions and all their derivatives.
We let D(U, X) denote the space of all functions in C ∞(U, X) with compact
support in U. One convenient thing about the space C ∞(U, X) is that a function
f : U →X belongs to C ∞(U, X) if and only if ϕ ◦f ∈C ∞(U) for every

ϕ ∈X′ (this follows from the nuclearity of the Fr´echet space C ∞(U) and is
included in Th´eor`eme 2.13 of Grothendieck (1955)).
Proposition A.3
For every open set U ⊆C and every Banach space X, we

Sketch of proof
We refer the interested reader to Laursen and Neumann
(2000, Proposition 2.3.6). The argument is a beautiful piece of functional anal-
ysis: it makes use of the Pettis result mentioned before. It also relies on the
Krein–Smulian theorem: a linear functional ψ on X′ is weak-∗continuous
on X′ exactly when the restriction ψ |(X′)[r] is weak-∗continuous for each
r > 0. Additional classic tools employed are Lebesgue’s dominated conver-
gence theorem, the result of Grothendieck (1955) mentioned above, and the
Hahn–Banach theorem.
□
Proposition A.3 may be used to show that the vector-valued Bergman space
A 2(U, X) := H(U, X) ∩L 2(U, X)
consists of all f ∈L 2(U, X) for which ∂f = 0 in the distributional sense (ex-
ercise). Consequently, A 2(U, X) is a closed linear subspace of W m(U, X) for
every m ∈Z+. Moreover, it is easily seen that the Banach space A 2(U, X) is
continuously embedded in the Fr´echet space H(U, X). As in the scalar-valued
setting, it is clear that the ∂-operator acts as a continuous linear map from
W m(U, X) into W m−1(U, X).
From now on, let T ∈B(X) be given, and suppose that U is a bounded open
subset of C containing the spectrum σ(T ). We need the deﬁnition of the local
analytic functional calculus
ℓ( f ) =


(λ −T )−1 f (λ) dλ
for all f ∈H(U, X),
where  is a contour in U surrounding σ(T ). The map ℓ: H(U, X) →X
is continuous, and the Bergman space A 2(U, X) is continuously embedded in
H(U, X), so that
B 2(U, X) := { f ∈A 2(U, X) : ℓ( f ) = 0}
is a closed linear subspace of A 2(U, X). The null space of the natural surjection

onto W m(U, X)/A 2(U, X) may be identiﬁed with A 2(U, X)/B 2(U, X). Thus
we obtain a short exact sequence
0 →A2(U, X)/B 2(U, X) →W m(U, X)/B 2(U, X)
→W m(U, X)/A2(U, X) →0
of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces.
Here the surjectivity of the local analytic functional calculus allows us to
identify the quotient A 2(U, X)/B 2(U, X) with the given Banach space
X. Moreover, the ∂-operator induces an identiﬁcation of the spaces W m
(U, X)/A 2(U, X) and W m−1(U, X). Hence the preceding exact sequence may
be rephrased as
0 →X →W m(U, X)/B 2(U, X) →W m−1(U, X) →0 .
This explains the meaning of the spaces appearing in this next theorem.
Theorem A.4
Let T ∈B(X) be an arbitrary operator, let U be a bounded
open subset of C such that U contains the spectrum σ(T ), and let m ∈N. Then
the assignments
r J (x) = 1 ⊗x + B 2(U, X)
for all
x ∈X,
r Q( f + B 2(U, X)) = ∂f
for all
f ∈W m(U, X),
r S( f + B 2(U, X)) = Z f + B 2(U, X) for all f ∈W m(U, X),
r R (g) = Zg
for all g ∈W m−1(U, X)
yield a commutative diagram with exact rows of continuous linear operators

Moreover, R is generalized scalar with σ(R) = U, while S is a quotient of a

Since the statement of Theorem A.4 includes the speciﬁc forms of the maps
involved, carrying out the proof of this result is more a matter of tenacity
than of ingenuity, as may be seen by looking at Laursen and Neumann (2000,
Theorem 2.4.3). I have elected to leave out the details, and instead concentrate
on our main uses for this result.

It is interesting that the above theorem establishes a certain kind of universal-
ity of generalized scalar operators: every bounded linear operator on a Banach
space is a restriction of a quotient of a generalized scalar operator. However,
our main concern is expressed in the next result, which is now simple. Its proof
follows by applying the 3-space lemma, Lemma 23.1.3, for (β).
Theorem A.5
A continuous linear operator on a Banach space has (β) if and
only if it is similar to the restriction of a decomposable operator to one of its
closed invariant subspaces. Moreover, if T is an operator with (β), then the
operator S, in the functional model of Theorem A.4 for T, is a decomposable
extension of T .
□
To get a handle on how to establish the remaining duality property we have
to mention a second functional model.
Theorem A.6
Let T ∈B(X) be an arbitrary operator on a Banach space X,
let m ∈N be given, and suppose that U is a bounded open subset of C such
that U contains σ(T ). Let
Y := {V ∈B(W m(U), X) : V ( f ) = f (T )V (1)
for all
f ∈A 2(U)} ,
where the operator f (T ) ∈B(X) is given by the analytic functional calculus
for T . Then the assignments:
r J (C) := C ◦∂;
r R (C) := C ◦MZ
for all
C ∈B(W m−1(U), X);
r Q (V ) := V (1);
r S (V ) := V ◦MZ for all V ∈Y
yield a commutative diagram with exact rows of continuous linear operators
between Banach spaces:

Moreover, R is generalized scalar, and S is subscalar.

The 3-space lemma for (δ), also contained in Lemma 23.1.3, is used in
proving the ‘only if’ part.

Finally, here are the detailed duality statements. Evidently, it is an immediate
consequence of the fact (Theorem 21.2.8) that an operator is decomposable if
and only if it has both (β) and (δ), combined with Theorem A.8, that an operator
and its adjoint are simultaneously decomposable. However, the proof of A.8
proceeds by showing this latter fact ﬁrst, so we state it separately. That will also
serve to emphasize its importance.
Theorem A.7
An operator T ∈B(X) is decomposable if and only if the ad-
joint T ′ ∈B(X′) is decomposable.
□
Theorem A.8
For every operator T ∈B(X), the following assertions hold.
(i) If T has (β), then T ′ has (δ).
(ii) If T has (δ), then T ′ has (β).
(iii) If T
′ has (δ), then T has (β).
(iv) If T
′ has (β), then T has (δ).
Proof
We sketch the proof of (i). If T has (β), then T has a decomposable
extension, say S. By Theorem 23.1.4, the adjoint operator S′ is also decom-
posable. Moreover, T ′ may be realized as a quotient of S′. Hence, by Theorem
23.1.1, T ′ has (δ). Exercise: ﬁll in the details.
(ii) and (iii): exercises.
We leave out entirely the details of how to establish part (iv) because this
is so much harder than the rest. This result is one of J. Eschmeier’s great
achievements. It can be done via a tensor version of the functional model of
Theorem A.4. The details are omitted here, except for the diagram itself. For
full details, see Laursen and Neumann (2000).

Morever, the information in the last part of the theorem may be used in a proof
of Eschmeier–Prunaru’s result on the existence of closed invariant subspaces
for operators with (β) and thick spectrum. There is more on this in Chapter 18.
As a consequence we have Theorem 23.1.5, that is, every operator T ∈B(X)
has one of the properties (β) or (δ) if and only if its adjoint operator T ′ ∈B(X′)
has the other one.

Semi-regular operators
Let T be a bounded operator on a Banach space X. It has been observed in
Chapter 21 that, if the spectrum σ(T ) is totally disconnected, then T is decom-
posable. In particular, every compact operator K is decomposable, because
σ(K) is either ﬁnite or a sequence which converges to 0. The classical Riesz–
Schauder theory for compact operators shows that, for every λ ̸= 0, the space
λI −T has a ﬁnite-dimensional kernel and a ﬁnite-codimensional range, that
is, λI −T is a Fredholm operator, see Part I, Theorem 2.2.5 or Heuser (1982).
Similarly, the class of normal operators on a Hilbert space consists of decom-
posable operators (see Part IV, Chapter 21), and has many remarkable properties
from the point of view of Fredholm theory. For instance, for normal operators
some of the spectra originating from Fredholm theory coincide, as in the case
of compact operators.
A natural question is to what extent the results which hold for compact and
normal operators in Fredholm theory may be extended to decomposable oper-
ators. In this part of the book we shall give some answers to this question, and
establish important connections between Fredholm theory and the single-valued
extension property, a property which plays a leading role in the investigation
of decomposable operators.
26.1 Deﬁnitions
Among the various concepts of regularity originating from Fredholm theory, the
concept of semi-regularity, which will be introduced in this chapter, seems to
be the most appropriate to investigate some important aspects of local spectral

theory. The concept of semi-regularity originates in the classical Kato’s treat-
ment (1958) of perturbation theory of Fredholm operators.
To introduce the class of semi-regular operators, we need ﬁrst to establish
some connections between the kernels and the ranges of the iterates T n of an
operator T on a vector space X.
Proposition 26.1.1
For a linear operator T on a vector space X, the following
statements are equivalent:
(i) ker T ⊆T m(X) for each m ∈N;
(ii) ker T n ⊆T (X) for each n ∈N;
(iii) ker T n ⊂T m(X) for each n ∈N and each m ∈N;
(iv) ker T n = T m(ker T m+n) for each n ∈N and each m ∈N.
Proof (i)⇒(ii) We proceed by induction. The case n = 1 is obvious from the
assumption (i). Assume that (ii) holds for n = k, and let x ∈ker T k+1. Then
T kx ∈ker T ⊆T k+1(X) ,
by assumption (i). Hence there exists y ∈X such that T kx = T k+1y. It is obvi-
ous that T k(x −T y) = 0. Hence, if z := x −T y, then z ∈ker T k ⊆T (X) by
the inductive assumption. Therefore x = z + T y ∈T (X), so that the inclusion
ker T k+1 ⊆T (X) is proved.
(ii)⇒(iii) We proceed by induction on m. The case m = 1 is true by assump-
tion.Assumethat(iii)isvalidform = k andeachn ∈N,thatis,ker T n ⊆T k(X)
foreveryn ∈N.Let x ∈ker T n,wheren ∈Nisarbitrary.Sinceker T n ⊆T (X),
we have x = T y for some y ∈X. From 0 = T nx = T n+1y, we obtain that
y ∈ker T n+1 ⊆T k(X), and this implies that x = T y ∈T k+1(X). Hence (iii) is
proved.
(iii)⇒(iv) Clearly, if x ∈T m(ker T n+m), then T nx = 0, so that
T m(ker T n+m) ⊆ker T n.
To prove the opposite inclusion, let x ∈ker T n for a ﬁxed n ∈N. If m ∈N,
then, by assumption (iii), there exists y ∈X such that x = T m y. From the
equality 0 = T nx = T n+m y, we conclude that y ∈ker T n+m; so (iv) is proved.
(iv)⇒(i) It sufﬁces to consider the equality (iv) in the case where n = 1. In
fact, in this case, for each m ∈N, we have
ker T = T m(ker T m+1) ⊆T m(X).

Semi-regular operators
269
Deﬁnition 26.1.2
Given a Banach space X, a bounded operator T ∈B(X) is
semi-regular if T (X) is closed and if T satisﬁes one of the equivalent conditions
of Proposition 26.1.1.
It is not difﬁcult to show that T is semi-regular if and only if the dual operator
T ′ is semi-regular.
Given a bounded operator T ∈B(X, Y), where X, Y are Banach spaces, the
property of T (X) being closed may be characterized by means of the following
quantity associated with T .
Deﬁnition 26.1.3
If T ∈B(X, Y), where X and Y are Banach spaces, the
minimal modulus of T is
γ (T ) :=
inf
x /∈ker T
∥T x∥
dist(x, ker T ) ,
with the convention that γ (T ) = ∞if T = 0.
A classical result from perturbation operator theory (which is easy to see
directly) establishes that γ (T ) > 0 if and only if T (X) is closed. Moreover, if
T ′ is the dual of T , then γ (T ) = γ (T ′) for every T ∈B(X); see Kato (1966) or
Goldberg (1966) for details. Of course, this implies that T (X) is closed if and
only if T ′(X′) is closed.
The next result gives a useful condition which ensures that T (X) is closed.
Proposition 26.1.4
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and suppose
that there exists a closed subspace Y of X such that T (X) ∩Y = {0} and
T (X) ⊕Y is closed. Then T (X) is also closed.
Proof Consider the product space X × Y under the norm
∥(x, y)∥:= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥
(x ∈X, y ∈Y) .
Then X × Y isaBanachspace,andthecontinuousmap S : X × Y →X deﬁned
by S(x, y) := T x + y has range S(X × Y) = T (X) ⊕Y, which is closed by
assumption. From this, it follows that the minimal modulus
γ (S) :=
inf
(x,y)/∈kerS
∥S(x, y)∥
dist((x, y), ker S) > 0 .

270
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
Moreover, ker S = ker T × {0}, so dist((x, 0), ker S) = dist(x, ker T ), and
hence
∥T x∥= ∥S(x, 0)∥≥γ (S) dist((x, 0), ker S)) = γ (S) dist(x, ker T ) .
This implies that γ (T ) ≥γ (S), and therefore T has closed range.
□
Recall that every subspace M of a vector space X admits at least one algebraic
complement N, that is, X = M + N and M ∩N = {0}. The codimension of a
subspace M of X is the dimension of each algebraic complement N of M. An
immediate consequence of Proposition 26.1.4 is that, if Y is a ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace of X and T (X) + Y is closed, then T (X) is closed. In particular, it
follows from Proposition 26.1.4 that, if codim T (X) < ∞, then T (X) is closed.
The following T -invariant subspace for a linear operator T on a vector space
has been introduced by Saphar (1964).
Deﬁnition 26.1.5
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X. The al-
gebraic core C(T ) is deﬁned to be the greatest subspace M of X for which
T (M) = M.
Evidently, C(T ) coincides with the algebraic spectral subspace ET (C \ {0})
deﬁned in Chapter 22.
It is not difﬁcult to show that C(T ) may be characterized in terms of se-
quences. In fact, a recursive argument proves that x ∈C(T ) if and only if there
exists a sequence (un)n∈Z+ ⊂X such that x = u0 and T un+1 = un (n ∈Z+).
The subspace C(T ) is deﬁned in purely algebraic terms. The second subspace
that we shall consider is, in a certain sense, the analytic counterpart of C(T ).
Deﬁnition 26.1.6
Let X be a Banach space. The analytical core of T ∈B(X)
is the set K(T ) of all x ∈X for which there is a sequence (un) and a δ > 0 such
that:
(i)
x = u0 and T un+1 = un (n ∈Z+);
(ii) ∥un∥≤δn∥x∥(n ∈Z+).
It is easily seen from deﬁnition that K(T ) is a linear subspace of X con-
tained in C(T ) and that T (K(T )) = K(T ). We shall see in Theorem 27.2.2
that K(T ) = XT (C \ {0}), where XT denotes the local analytic subspace, as
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 22.1.1. Observe that in general neither K(T ) nor C(T ) is

26
Semi-regular operators
271
closed. The next result shows that, under the assumption that C(T ) is closed,
these two subspaces coincide.
Proposition 26.1.7
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and let F be
a closed subspace of X such that T (F) = F. Then F ⊆K(T ). In particular, if
C(T ) is closed, then C(T ) = K(T ).
Proof Let T0 : F →F denote the restriction of T to F. By assumption, F is a
Banach space and T (F) = F, and so, by the open mapping theorem, T0 is open.
This means that there is a constant δ > 0 with the property that, for every x ∈F,
there exists u ∈F such that T u = x and ∥u∥≤δ∥x∥. Let x ∈F be arbitrarily
given, let u0 = x, and consider an element u1 ∈F such that T u1 = u0 and
∥u1∥≤δ∥u0∥. By repeating this procedure, we can ﬁnd an element un ∈F for
every n ∈Z+ such that T un+1 = un and ∥un∥≤δ∥un−1∥. The last inequality
gives the estimate ∥un∥≤δn∥u0∥= δn∥x∥for n ∈Z+. Thus x ∈K(T ), and
hence F ⊆K(T ).
The last assertion is clear.
□
Deﬁnition 26.1.8
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X. The gen-
eralized range and generalized kernel of T are
T ∞(X) :=

n∈N
T n(X)
and
N ∞(T ) :=

n∈N
ker T n .
A simple inductive argument shows that the inclusion C(T ) ⊆T n(X) holds
for all n ∈N. From this it follows that C(T ) ⊆T ∞(X). By Proposition 26.1.1,
we easily obtain that T ∈B(X) is semi-regular if and only if T (X) is closed
and N ∞(T ) ⊆T ∞(X).
The next lemma shows that under certain conditions the algebraic core and
the generalized range of an operator coincide.
Lemma 26.1.9
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X. Suppose that
the equality
ker T ∩T m(X) = ker T ∩T m+k(X)
(k ∈Z+) ,
(26.1.1)
holds for some m ∈N. Then C(T ) = T ∞(X).
Proof
We need only to prove the inclusion T ∞(X) ⊆C(T ), that is,
T (T ∞(X)) = T ∞(X). The inclusion T (T ∞(X)) ⊆T ∞(X) is obvious for every
linear operator, so we need only to prove the opposite inclusion.

Suppose that (26.1.1) holds for m ∈N, and consider D := ker T ∩T m(X).
Clearly, D = ker T ∩T ∞(X). Now, let y be an arbitrary element of T ∞(X).
Since y ∈T n(X) (n ∈N), there exists xk ∈X such that y = T m+kxk. We now
set
zk := T mx1 −T m+k−1xk
(k ∈N) .
Then zk ∈T m(X), and from the fact that T zk = T m+1x1 −T m+kxk = 0 we
obtain that zk ∈ker T . Hence zk ∈D. The inclusion
D = ker T ∩T m+k(X) ⊆ker T ∩T m+k−1(X)
now entails that zk ∈T m+k−1(X). This implies that
T mx1 = zk + T m+k−1xk ∈T m+k−1(X)
(k ∈N) ,
and therefore T mx1 ∈T ∞(X). From the equalities T (T mx1) = T m+1x1 = y,
we ﬁnally conclude that y ∈T (T ∞(X)), and therefore T ∞(X) ⊆T (T ∞(X)),
as required.

Proposition 26.1.10
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X. Suppose
that one of the following conditions holds:
(i) dim ker T < ∞;
(ii) codim T (X) < ∞;
(iii) ker T ⊆T n(X) (n ∈N).
Then C(T ) = T ∞(X).
Proof
(i) It is evident that, if ker T is ﬁnite dimensional, then there ex-
ists a positive integer m ∈N such that the equality (26.1.1) holds. Hence
Lemma 26.1.9 applies.
(ii) Assume that X = F ⊕T (X) with dim F < ∞. Clearly, if
Dn := ker T ∩T n(X),
then Dn ⊇Dn+1 for all n ∈N. Suppose that there exist k distinct subspaces Dn.
There is no loss of generality if we assume that D j ̸= D j+1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
Then for each one of these j, there exists w j ∈X such that Tjw j ∈D j
and T jw j /∈D j+1. By means of the decomposition X = F ⊕T (X), we can
ﬁnd u j ∈F and v j ∈T (X) such that w j = u j + v j. We claim that the set
{u1, . . . , uk} is linearly independent.

From T kwk ∈ker T , we obtain λkT kwk ∈Dk+1 and, since T kwk /∈Dk+1, this
is possible only if λk = 0. Analogously we have λk−1 = . . . = λ1 = 0, and con-
sequently the set {u1, . . . , uk} is linearly independent. From this, we conclude
that k ≤dim F. But then, for a sufﬁciently large m, we have
ker T ∩T m(X) = ker T ∩T m+ j(X)
( j ∈Z+) .
So we are again in the situation of Lemma 26.1.9, and so (ii) implies that
C(T ) = T ∞(X).
(iii) Obviously, if ker T ⊆T n(X) for all n ∈N, then
ker T ∩T n(X) = ker T ∩T n+k(X) = ker T
(k ∈Z+) .
Hence also in this case we can apply Lemma 26.1.9.

Lemma 26.1.11
Suppose that T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and that
T has closed range T (X). For each (not necessarily closed) subspace Y ⊆X,
T (Y) is closed whenever Y + ker T is closed.
Proof Let x be the equivalence class x + ker T in the quotient space X/ker T ,
and denote by T : X/ker T →X the canonical injection which is deﬁned by
T (x) := T x, where x ∈x. By assumption, T (X) is closed, so that T has a
bounded inverse T
−1 : T (X) →X/ker T . Let Y := {y : y ∈Y}. It is evident
that T (Y) = T (Y) is the inverse image of Y under the continuous map T
−1.
Thus T (Y) is closed whenever Y is closed.
It remains to show that Y is closed whenever Y + ker T is closed. Let (xn) be
a sequence of Y which converges to x ∈X/ker T . Then there exists a sequence
(xn) with xn ∈xn such that dist(xn −x, ker T ) converges to zero, and so there
exists a sequence (zn) ⊂ker T with xn −x −zn →0 as n →∞. Evidently,
the sequence (xn −zn) ⊂Y + ker T converges to x, and since, by assumption,
Y + ker T is closed, we conclude that x ∈Y + ker T . This implies x ∈Y, and
hence Y is closed.

Proposition 26.1.12
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X) be semi-
regular. Then:
(i) the subspace T n(X) is closed for each n ∈N;
(ii) C(T ) is closed and C(T ) = K(T ) = T ∞(X).
Proof
(i) We proceed by induction. The case n = 1 is obvious because, by
assumption, Y := T (X) is closed. Assume that T n(X) is closed for some n ∈N.
Since T is semi-regular, ker T n ⊆T (X) = Y. From this, it follows that the sum
Y + ker T n = Y is closed, and hence, by Lemma 26.1.11, T n(Y) = T n+1(X)
is closed.
(ii) The operator T is semi-regular, and so, by Proposition 26.1.10,
C(T ) = T ∞(X) =

26.2 The Kato spectrum
Among the many concepts dealt with in Kato’s extensive treatment of perturba-
tion theory (Kato 1958), there is a very important part of the spectrum deﬁned
as follows.
Deﬁnition 26.2.1
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X). The Kato
resolvent set of T is
ρK(T ) := {λ ∈C : λI −T is semi-regular}.
The Kato spectrum of T is the set σK(T ) := C \ ρK(T ) .
It is clear that σK(T ) ⊆σ(T ) and ρ(T ) ⊆ρK(T ). Later we shall prove that
σK(T ) is a non-empty, compact subset of C.
Recall that an operator T ∈B(X) is bounded below if T is injective and has
closed range. This is equivalent to saying that there exists K > 0 such that
∥T x∥≥K∥x∥for all x ∈X. Clearly, if T is bounded below or surjective, then
T is semi-regular. A standard result of duality theory shows that T is bounded
below (respectively, surjective) if and only if T ′ is surjective (respectively,
bounded below).

26
Semi-regular operators
275
Lemma 26.2.2
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X). Then T is
bounded below (respectively, surjective) if and only if λI −T is bounded below
(respectively, surjective) for every |λ| < γ (T ).
Proof Suppose T bounded below. Since T (X) is closed, γ (T ) > 0 and
γ (T ) · dist(x, ker T ) = γ (T )∥x∥≤∥T x∥(x ∈X) .
Take |λ| < γ (T ). Then
∥(λI −T )x∥≥∥T x∥−|λ|∥x∥≥(γ (T ) −|λ|)∥x∥,
and so λI −T is bounded below.
The case where T is surjective now follows easily by considering the dual
T ′ of T .
□
Theorem 26.2.3
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X) be semi-regular.
Then λI −T is semi-regular for |λ| < γ (T ). Consequently, σK(T ) is closed.
Proof First we show that C(T ) ⊆C(λI −T ) for all |λ| < γ (T ). Indeed, let
T0 : C(T ) →C(T ) denote the restriction of T to C(T ). By Proposition 26.1.12,
C(T ) is closed and T0 is surjective. Thus, by Lemma 26.2.2, the equalities
(λI −T0)(C(T )) = (λI −T )(C(T )) = C(T )
hold for all |λ| < γ (T0).
On the other hand, T is semi-regular so, by Proposition 26.1.10, we have
ker T ⊆T ∞(X) = C(T ). From this it easily follows that γ (T0) ≥γ (T ) and,
consequently, we see that (λI −T )(C(T )) = C(T ) for all |λ| < γ (T ). Note
that this last equality implies that
C(T ) ⊆C(λI −T )
(λ ∈D(0, γ (T )) .
(26.2.1)
Moreover, for every λ ̸= 0, we have T (ker(λI −T )) = ker(λI −T ), and so,
by Proposition 26.1.12 and Proposition 26.1.7, we have ker(λI −T ) ⊆C(T )
for λ ̸= 0. From the inclusion (26.2.1), we now obtain that the inclusions
ker(λI −T ) ⊆C(λI −T ) ⊆(λI −T )n(X)
(26.2.2)
hold for all |λ| < γ (T ), λ ̸= 0 and n ∈N. This is still true for λ = 0 since T is
semi-regular, so that (26.2.2) is valid for all |λ| < γ (T ).

276
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
To show that λI −T is semi-regular for all |λ| < γ (T ), it only remains
to prove that (λI −T )(X) is closed for all |λ| < γ (T ). Observe that, as a
consequence of Lemma 26.2.2, we can limit ourselves to considering only
the case where {0} ̸= C(T ) ̸= {X}. Indeed, if C(T ) = {0}, then we have ker
T ⊆C(T ) = {0}, and hence T is injective, while, if C(T ) = X, the operator T
is surjective.
Let X := X/C(T ), and let T : X →X be the continuous quotient map,
deﬁned by T (x) := T x where x ∈x. The operator T is injective, since from
T x = T x = 0 we have T x ∈C(T ) and this easily implies, since T is semi-
regular, that x ∈C(T ), which yields x = 0.
Next we prove that T is bounded below. Evidently, we only need to prove
that T has closed range. To see this we show the inequality γ (T ) ≥γ (T ). In
fact, for x ∈X and u ∈C(T ), we have
∥x∥= dist(x, C(T )) = dist(x −u, C(T ))
≤dist(x −u, ker T ) ≤∥T x −T u∥/γ (T ) .
From the equality C(T ) = T (C(T )), we obtain ∥x∥= ∥T x∥/γ (T ) and, con-
sequently, γ (T ) ≥γ (T ). Therefore T is bounded below. By Lemma 26.2.2,
λI −T is bounded below for all |λ| < γ (T ) and a fortiori for all |λ| < γ (T ).
Finally, to show that (λI −T )(X) is closed for all |λ| < γ (T ), let us con-
sider a sequence (un) of (λI −T )(X) which converges to x ∈X. Clearly, the
sequence (xn) converges to x and xn ∈(λI −T )(X). The last space is closed
for all |λ| < γ (T ), and hence x ∈(λI −T )(X). Let x = (λI −T )v and v ∈v.
Then
x −(λI −T )v ∈C(T ) = (λI −T )(C(T ))
(|λ| < γ (T )) ,
and so there exists u ∈C(T ) such that x = (λI −T )(v + u), that is,
x ∈(λI −T )(X), for each |λ| < γ (T ). Therefore (λI −T )(X) is closed for
|λ| < γ (T ), and consequently λI −T is semi-regular for |λ| < γ (T ), that is,
ρK(T ) is an open subset of C.
□
The set ρK(T ) is open, and therefore it can be decomposed into open,
connected, pairwise disjoint, non-empty components. We want to prove that
C(λI −T ) is constant on each component 
 of ρK(T ). To show this, we ﬁrst
need some preliminary results on gap theory.
Let M, N be two closed linear subspaces of a Banach space X, and deﬁne
δ(M, N) := sup{dist(u, N) : u ∈M, ∥u∥= 1}.

26
Semi-regular operators
277
Lemma 26.2.4
Let M and N be two closed subspaces of a Banach space X.
For every x ∈X and 0 < ε < 1, there exists x0 ∈X such that x −x0 ∈M and
dist(x0, N) ≥(1 −ε)1 −δ(M, N)
1 + δ(M, N)∥x0∥.
(26.2.3)
Proof
The case x ∈M is obvious: it sufﬁces to take x0 = 0. Hence as-
sume that x /∈M. Let X := X/M be the quotient space, and set x := x + M.
Then ∥x∥= infz∈X ∥z∥> 0. We claim that there exists x0 ∈X such that
∥x0∥= dist(x0, M) ≥(1 −ε)∥x0∥. Indeed, were this not so, then
∥x∥= ∥z∥< (1 −ε)∥z∥
for every z ∈x and, consequently, ∥x∥≤(1 −ε) infz∈x ∥z∥= (1 −ε)∥x∥.
This is impossible because ∥x∥> 0.
Let µ := dist(x0, N) = infu∈N ∥x0 −u∥. We know that there exists y ∈N
such that ∥x0 −y∥≤µ + ε∥x0∥. From this we obtain
∥y∥≤(1 + ε)∥x0∥+ µ .
On the other hand we have dist(y, M) = δ(N, M) · ∥y∥, and so
(1 −ε)∥x0∥≤dist(x0, M) ≤∥x0 −y∥+ dist(y, M)
≤µ + ε∥x0∥+ δ(N, M) · ∥y∥
≤µ + ε∥x0∥+ δ(N, M)[(1 + ε)∥x0∥+ µ] ,
and therefore
µ ≥
	1 −ε −δ(N, M)
1 + δ(N, M)

∥x0∥.
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, this implies the inequality (26.2.3).

Then
γ (λI −T ) ≥γ (T ) −3|λ|

(26.2.4)
Proof Of course, for every T ∈B(X) and |λ| ≥γ (T ), we have
γ (λI −T ) ≥0 ≥γ (T ) −3|λ| ,
hence we need only to prove the inequality (26.2.4) in the case where
|λ| < γ (T ).

If C(T ) = {0}, from the assumption that ker T ⊆T ∞(X) = C(T ), we con-
clude that ker T = {0}, that is, T is bounded below. From an inspection of the
proofofLemma26.2.2,weobtainthatγ (λI −T ) ≥γ (T ) −|λ| ≥γ (T ) −3|λ|
for all |λ| < γ (T ). Also the case where C(T ) = X is trivial, because in this case
T is surjective and hence T ′ is bounded below, so that
γ (λI −T ) = γ (λI ′ −T ′) ≥γ (T ′) −3|λ| = γ (T ) −3|λ| .
It remains to prove the inequality (26.2.4) in the case where C(T ) ̸= {0} and
C(T ) ̸= X. Suppose that |λ| < γ (T ), and let x ∈C(T ) = T (C(T )). Then there
exists u ∈C(T ) such that x = T u, and hence
dist(u, ker T ) ≤∥T u∥/γ (T ) = ∥x∥/γ (T ) .
Let ε > 0 be arbitrary, and choose w ∈ker T such that
∥u −w∥≤[(1 −ε)∥x∥/γ (T ).
Let u1 := u −w, and µ := (1 −ε)γ (T ). Clearly, u1 ∈C(T ), T u1 = x, and
∥u1∥≤µ−1∥x∥. Since u1 ∈C(T ), by repeating the same procedure, we obtain
a sequence (un), where u0 := x, such that un ∈C(T ), T un+1 = un, and ∥un∥≤
µ−n∥x∥.
Let us consider the function f : D(0, µ) →X deﬁned by

µ −|λ| =

Now, let δ := δ(ker T, ker (λI −T )). By Lemma 26.2.4, to the element u and

dist(v, ker T ) ≥1 −δ

From this it follows that

≥γ (T ) · dist(v, ker T ) −|λ|∥v∥
≥γ (T )1 −δ
1 + δ (1 −ε)∥v∥−|λ|∥v∥.
Then, by using the inequality (26.2.5), we obtain
∥(λI −T )u∥≥[(1 −ε)(γ (T ) −2|λ|) −|λ|]∥v∥
≥[(1 −ε)(γ (T ) −2|λ|) −|λ|]∥u −z∥
≥[(1 −ε)(γ (T ) −2|λ|) −|λ|] · dist(u, ker (λI −T )) .
From the last inequality, it easily follows that
γ (λI −T ) ≥(1 −ε)(γ (T ) −2|λ|) −|λ| ,
and, since ε is arbitrary, we conclude that γ (λI −T ) ≥γ (T ) −3|λ|.
□
Theorem 26.2.6
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and consider
a component 
 of ρK(T ). If λ0 ∈
, then C(λI −T ) = C(λ0I −T ) for all
λ ∈
, that is, the subspaces C(λI −T ) = K(λI −T ) are constant on 
.
Proof Observe ﬁrst that, by the ﬁrst part of the proof of Theorem 26.2.3, we
have C(T ) ⊆C(δI −T ) for every |δ| < γ (T ). Now take |δ| < γ (T )/4 and
deﬁne S = δI −T . From Lemma 26.2.5, we obtain
γ (S) = γ (δI −T ) ≥γ (T ) −3|δ| > |δ| ,
and hence, again by the observation above,
C(S) = C(δI −T ) ⊆C(δI −(δI −T )) = C(T ) .
This shows that C(δI −T ) = C(T ) for δ sufﬁciently small.
Assume now that λ, µ ∈
. Then λI −T = (λ −µ)I −(T −µI), and the
previous argument shows that, if we take λ, µ sufﬁciently close to each other,
then
C(λI −T ) = C((λ −µ)I −(T −µI)) = C(µI −T ) .
A compactness argument shows that we have C(λI −T ) = C(µI −T ) for all
λ, µ ∈

In the next deﬁnition we introduce another important T -invariant subspace
for a bounded operator T .
Deﬁnition 26.2.7
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space. The quasi-
nilpotent part of T is the set
H0(T ) := {x ∈X : lim
n→∞∥T nx∥1/n = 0} .
As in Deﬁnition 2.1.2, the operator T ∈B(X) is said to be quasi-nilpotent
if its spectral radius ν(T ) := inf{∥T n∥1/n} = limn→∞∥T n∥1/n is zero.
Clearly, H0(T ) is a linear subspace of X, generally not closed.
Lemma 26.2.8
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X) be semi-regular.
Then γ (T n) ≥γ (T )n (n ∈N).
Proof We proceed by induction. The case n = 1 is trivial. Assume inductively
that γ (T n) ≥γ (T )n. For every element x ∈X and u ∈ker T n+1, we have
dist(x, ker T n+1) = dist(x −u, ker T n+1) ≤dist(x −u, ker T ) .
Since T is semi-regular, Lemma 26.1.1 implies that ker T = T n(ker T n+1).
Therefore
dist(T nx, ker T ) = dist(T nx, T n(ker T n+1)) =
inf
u∈ker T n+1 ∥T n(x −u)∥
≥γ (T n) ·
inf
u∈ker T n+1 dist(x −u, ker T n)
≥γ (T n) dist(x, ker T n+1) .
From this we obtain
∥T n+1x∥≥γ (T ) dist(T nx, ker T ) ≥γ (T ) γ (T n) · dist(x, ker T n+1) .
Consequently, γ (T n+1) ≥γ (T )γ (T )n = γ (T )n+1, so the proof is com-
plete.

Let M⊥denote the annihilator of M ⊆X, and ⊥N the pre-annihilator of
N ⊆X′.
Proposition 26.2.9
For every bounded operator T ∈B(X), where X is a
Banach space, we have H0(T ) ⊆⊥K(T ′) and K(T ) ⊆⊥H0(T ′). Moreover, if T
is semi-regular, then H0(T ) = N ∞(T ) = ⊥K(T ′) and K(T ) = ⊥H0(T ′) .

26
Semi-regular operators
281
Proof Consider an element u ∈H0(T ) and f ∈K(T ′). Then, according to the
deﬁnition of K(T ′), there exists δ > 0 and a sequence (gn) ⊂X′ such that g0 =
f, T ′gn+1 = gn, and ∥gn∥≤δn∥f ∥for every n ∈Z+. These equalities entail
that f = (T ′)ngn, and hence that f (u) = (T ′)ngn(u) = gn(T nu), for n ∈Z+.
From this it follows that | f (u)| ≤∥T nu∥∥gn∥for n ∈Z+, and therefore
| f (u)| ≤δn∥f ∥∥T nu∥(n ∈Z+) .
(26.2.6)
Now, from u ∈H0(T ), we obtain that limn→∞∥T nu∥1/n = 0, and hence,
by taking the nth root in (26.2.6), we conclude that f (u) = 0. Therefore,
H0(T ) ⊆⊥K(T ′).
The inclusion K(T ) ⊆⊥H0(T ′) is proved in a similar way.
Now, suppose that T is semi-regular. The inclusion N ∞(T ) ⊆H0(T ) is
obvious for every operator. To show the reverse inclusion, let suppose that
x /∈N ∞(T ) and take
δ := dist(x, N ∞(T )) = dist

Obviously, δ > 0 and, by Lemma 26.2.8, we have
∥T nx∥≥γ (T n) dist(x, ker T n)) ≥γ (T n) δ ≥γ (T )n δ ,
so that limn→∞∥T nx∥1/n ≥γ (T ) > 0, and hence x /∈H0(T ). This shows the
reverse inclusion, so that we have H0(T ) = N ∞(T ).
Finally, we show the equality H0(T ) = ⊥K(T ′). From the ﬁrst part, it is
enough to show the inclusion ⊥K(T ′) ⊆H0(T ). For T ∈B(X) and n ∈N, we
have ker T n ⊆H0(T ), and hence
H0(T )⊥⊆ker T n⊥= (T ′)n(X′) ,
where the last equality holds since T ′ is semi-regular and therefore, by Propo-
sition 26.1.12(i), (T ′)n(X′) is closed for n ∈N. This easily implies that
H0(T )
⊥= H0(T )⊥⊆(T ′)∞(X′) = K(T ′) ,
again by Proposition 26.1.12. Consequently, ⊥K(T ′) ⊆H0(T ) .
The equality K(T ) =⊥H0(T ′) is proved in a similar way.

Theorem 26.2.11
Let T ∈B(X), and denote by  a connected component of
σ(T ). Then the topological boundary ∂ is contained in σK(T ). In particular,
if X ̸= {0}, the Kato spectrum σK(T ) is a non-empty, compact subset of C
containing ∂σ(T ).
Proof Let λ0 ∈∂, and suppose that λ0 ∈ρK(T ). Let 
 denote the component
of ρK(T ) containing λ0. The set 
 is open, so there exists a neighbourhood U
of λ0 contained in 
 and, since λ0 ∈∂σ(T ), U also contains points of ρ(T ).
Hence 
 ∩ρ(T ) ̸= ∅.
Consider a point λ1 ∈
 ∩ρ(T ). Clearly, N ∞(λ1I −T ) = {0}, and hence,
by Theorem 26.2.10 and Proposition 26.2.9, we have
H0(λI −T ) = H0(λ1I −T ) = N ∞(λ1I −T ) = {0}
(λ ∈

This shows that ker(λI −T ) = {0} for every λ ∈

On the other hand, from Theorem 26.2.6, we know that
K(λI −T ) = K(λ1I −T ) = X (λ ∈

so that λI −T is onto for every λ ∈

conclude that λ0 ∈ρ(T ), a contradiction. Hence the ﬁrst assertion is proved.
The second assertion is clear: σK(T ) is compact by Theorem 26.2.3 and
∂σ(T ) ⊆σK(T ) by the ﬁrst part.

26.4 Additional notes
The concept of semi-regularity of an operator T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach
space, arose from the treatment of perturbation theory due to Kato (1958), even
if originally these operators were not given this name. Subsequently, this class
of operators has received a lot of attention from several other authors (see, for
instance, Mbekhta 1987, 1990; Mbekhta and Ouahab 1994; Schmoeger 1990;
M¨uller 1994). The Kato spectrum, also known as the Apostol spectrum in the
literature, was ﬁrst introduced by Apostol (1984) for Hilbert space operators
and was deﬁned as the set of all complex λ such that either λI −T is not closed
or λ is a discontinuity point for the function λ →(λI −T )−1. Subsequently,
the spectrum σK(T ) has been studied by different authors in the more general
framework of Banach spaces.
The local constancy of the analytic core on the components of the Kato
resolvent has been established by several authors (see, for instance, F¨orster
1966; ´O Searc´oid and West 1989), but the methods adopted in this notes are
inspired by the paper of Mbekhta and Ouahab (1994). A different approach to
this result may be found in Section 3.7 of Laursen and Neumann (2000). The
section on the quasi-nilpotent part of an operator is modelled after Mbekhta
(1990).
The concept of algebraic core of an operator has been introduced by Saphar
(1964), while the analytical core has been introduced by Vrbov´a (1973) and,
subsequently, studied by Mbekhta (1990), Mbekhta and Ouahab (1994). Lemma
26.1.9 and Proposition 26.1.10 are taken from Aiena and Monsalve (2000).
Proposition 26.1.12 is due to Schmoeger (1990), while the subsequent part,
except Lemma 26.2.4 due to Kato (1958), can be found in Mbekhta (1990).
Theorem 26.2.11 is due to Schmoeger (1990), who also showed that a spectral
mapping theorem holds for σK(T ).

27
The single-valued extension property
The basic role of the single-valued extension property (SVEP) arises in the
spectral decomposition theory, since every decomposable operator T enjoys
this property, as does its dual T ′. Indeed, in part IV, Chapter 21 it has
been shown that the decomposability of an operator may be viewed as the
union of two properties, the so-called Bishop’s property (β) and the prop-
erty (δ). Property (β) for T implies the SVEP for T (see part IV, Chapter
21) and, as observed in part IV, Chapter 23, properties (β) and (δ) have a
complete duality, so that, if T has (δ), then the dual T ′ has (β) and therefore
SVEP.
The main goal of this chapter is to investigate in detail a localized version of
SVEP. First we shall show that local spectral theory provides a suitable frame
for some characterizations of the analytical core and of the quasi-nilpotent part.
Then we shall use these characterizations to describe the localized SVEP by
means of a variety of conditions that involve the analytical core and the quasi-
nilpotent part of an operator, as well as the generalized range and the generalized
kernel.
27.1 The SVEP at a point
To explain the role of SVEP in local spectral theory we begin with some pre-
liminary and well-known facts from operator theory.
The resolvent function R(λ, T ) := (λI −T )−1 of T ∈B(X), where X is a
complex Banach space, is an analytic operator-valued function deﬁned on the
resolvent set ρ(T ). Setting fx(λ) := R(λ, T )x for each x ∈X, we obtain a
vector-valued analytic function fx : ρ(T ) →X which satisﬁes
(λI −T ) fx(λ) = x
(λ ∈ρ(T )) .

Part V
SVEP Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
(λI −T ) fx(λ) = x for some (sometimes even for all) values of λ that are
in the spectrum of T , as the following example shows.
Let T ∈B(X) be a bounded operator on a Banach space X such that the spec-
trumσ(T )hasanon-emptyspectralsubsetσ ̸= σ(T ),thatis,σ andσ(T ) \ σ are
closed. From the functional calculus, if P := P(σ, T ) denotes the spectral pro-
jection of T associated with σ, we know that P(X) is a closed T -invariant sub-
space and σ(T | P(X)) = σ, so the restriction (λI −T ) | P(X) is invertible for
all λ /∈σ (see part I, Theorem 4.3.1). Let x ∈P(X). Then the equation (27.1.1)
has the analytic solution fx(λ) := ((λI −T ) | P(X))−1x for all λ ∈C \ σ.
These considerations lead in a natural way to the concepts of local resolvent
ρT (x) at x of a bounded operator T on a Banach space X. This is deﬁned as the
set of all λ ∈C for which there is an open disc D(λ, ε) and an analytic function
f : D(λ, ε) →X such that the equation
(µI −T ) f (µ) = x
(µ ∈D(λ, ε))
holds. See Part IV, Deﬁnition 22.1.1. The local spectrum σT (x) at x is de-
ﬁned σT (x) := C \ ρT (x). Recall that, if λ ∈ρT (x) and f : D(λ, ε) →X is an
analytic function on D(λ, ε) which satisﬁes the equation (µI −T ) f (µ) = x
(µ ∈D(λ, ε)), then σT ( f (µ)) = σT (x) for all µ ∈D(λ); for this, see Part IV,
Lemma 22.1.4.
The single-valued extension property has been deﬁned in Part IV, Chapter 21.
In this chapter we shall consider a localized version of this property.
Let X be a complex Banach space, and let T ∈B(X). The operator T has
the single-valued extension property at λ0 ∈C, abbreviated ‘T has SVEP at
λ0’, if, for every open disc D(λ0) centred at λ0, the only analytic function
f : D(λ0) →X for which the equation (λI −T ) f (λ) = 0 holds is the constant
function f ≡0. Obviously, if T has SVEP for every λ ∈C, then T has SVEP.
Remark 27.1.1
(i) If x ∈X and T has SVEP at λ0 ∈ρT (x), then there exist an open disc
D(λ0, ε) and a unique analytic function f : D(λ0) →X satisfying the equa-
tion (λI −T ) f (λ) = x for all λ ∈D(λ0, ε). Consequently, SVEP implies
the existence of a maximal analytic extension f of
R(λ, T )x := (λI −T )−1x
to the set ρT (x) for every x ∈X. It is evident that this function identically
satisﬁes the equation
(λI −T )f (λ) = x
(λ ∈ρT (x)) ,
and that f (λ) = (λI −T )−1x for every λ ∈ρ(T ).

27
The single-valued extension property
287
(ii) Trivially, a bounded operator T ∈B(X) has SVEP at every point of the re-
solvent ρ(T ). Moreover, from the identity theorem for analytic functions,
it easily follows that T ∈B(X) has SVEP at every point of the bound-
ary ∂σ(T ) of the spectrum. In particular, every operator having discrete
spectrum has SVEP.
27.2 Local analytic subspace
For every subset 
 of C, let XT (
) denote the local analytical subspace of T
associated with 
, as in Deﬁnition 22.1.1, so that
XT (
) := {x ∈X : σT (x) ⊆
} .
The next result gives a precise description of the analytical core K(T ) by
means of the local spectrum σT (x).
Theorem 27.2.1
Let T ∈B(X) be a bounded operator on a Banach space X.
Then
K(T ) = XT (C \ {0}) = {x ∈X : 0 /∈σT (x)} .
Proof Let x ∈K(T ) and, according to the deﬁnition of K(T ), let δ > 0 and
(un) ⊂X a sequence for which x = u0, T un+1 = un, ∥un∥≤δn∥x∥for every
n ∈Z+. The function f : D(0, 1/δ) →X, where D(0, 1/δ) is the open disc
centred at 0 and with radius 1/δ, deﬁned by f (λ) := −∞
n=1 λn−1un, is an
analytic vector-valued function which satisﬁes the equation (λI −T ) f (λ) = x
for every λ ∈D(0, 1/δ). This means that 0 ∈ρT (x), and hence σT (x) ⊆C \ {0}.
Conversely, if σT (x) ⊆C \ {0}, then 0 ∈ρT (x), and hence there is an open
disc D(0, ε) and an analytic function f : D(0, ε) →X such that
(λI −T ) f (λ) = x
(λ ∈D(0, ε)) .
(27.2.1)
Since f is analytic on D(0, ε), there exists a sequence (un) ⊂X such that
f (λ) := −

(27.2.2)
Obviously, f (0) = −u1 and, taking λ = 0 in (27.2.1), we obtain the equation
T u1 = −T ( f (0)) = x.

On the other hand, we have
x = (λI −T ) f (λ) = T u1 + λ(T u2 −u1) + λ2(T u3 −u2)
+ · · ·
(λ ∈D(0, ε)) .
From x = T u1 we obtain T un+1 = un for n ∈N. Letting u0 = x, the sequence
(un)satisﬁesthecondition(1)ofthedeﬁnitionof K(T ),soitremainstoprovethe
condition ∥u −n∥≤δn∥x∥for a suitable δ > 0 and all n ∈Z+. Take µ > 1/ε.
Then there exists c > 0 such that
∥un∥≤c µn−1
(n ∈N) .
(27.2.3)
From (27.2.1) and (27.2.2) we easily obtain T u1 = u0 and T un = un−1 for
every n = 2, 3, . . . . Obviously, if x = 0, then x ∈K(T ). Suppose that x ̸= 0.
From the estimates (27.2.3), it then follows that ∥un∥≤∥x∥(µ + c/∥x∥)n, and
hence x ∈K(T ).

and this happens if and only if, for every x ̸= 0, the local spectrum σT (x) is
non-empty, that is, XT (∅) = {0}. See Proposition 22.1.2.
Theorem 27.2.2
For every operator T ∈B(X) on a Banach space X and
every ε ≥0, we have
XT (D(0, ε)) = {x ∈X : lim sup
n→∞
∥T nx∥1/n ≤ε} .
(27.2.4)
In particular, H0(T ) = XT ({0}) and, if T has SVEP, then H0(T ) = XT ({0}).
Proof Let x ∈X such that δ := lim supn→∞∥T nx∥1/n ≤ε. The series

λ ∈C \ D(0, ε). For |λ| > max {ε, ∥T ∥}, we obtain

(|µ| < 1/max{ε, ∥T ∥}) .
(27.2.5)
Since g is analytic on D(0, 1/ε), it follows, exactly as in the scalar setting
from Cauchy’s integral formula, that the equality (27.2.5) holds even for all
µ ∈D(0, 1/ε). This shows that the radius of convergence of the power series
representing g(µ) is greater than 1/ε. The standard formula for the radius of
convergence of a vector-valued power series then implies that δ < ε. Therefore
the equality (27.2.4) holds.
The equality H0(T ) = XT ({0}) is clear, taking ε = 0 in (27.2.4). Finally,
if T has SVEP, then XT (
) = XT (
) for every closed 
 ⊆C, in particular
XT ({0}) = XT ({0}).
□
We know that T does not have SVEP if and only if there exists an element
0 ̸= x ∈X such that σT (x) = ∅. The next result shows a localized version of
this fact.
Theorem 27.2.3
Suppose that T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space. Then
the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) T has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) ker (λ0I −T ) ∩XT (∅) = {0};
(iii) ker(λ0I −T ) ∩K(λ0I −T ) = {0} .
Proof (i) ⇔(ii) We can suppose that λ0 = 0. Assume that, for some x ∈ker T ,
we have σT (x) = ∅. Then 0 ∈ρT (x), so there is an open disc D(0, ε) and an
analytic function f : D(0, ε) →X such that (λI −T ) f (λ) = x (λ ∈D(0, ε)).

SVEP Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
Then
T ((λI −T ) f (λ)) = (λI −T )T ( f (λ)) = T x = 0
(λ ∈D(0, ε)) .
Since T has SVEP at 0, then T f (λ) = 0, and therefore T ( f (0)) = x = 0.
Conversely, suppose that, for every 0 ̸= x ∈ker T , we have σT (x) ̸= ∅. There
is an analytic function f : D(0, ε) →X such that
(λI −T ) f (λ) = 0 (λ ∈D(0, ε)).
Then f (λ) = ∞
n=0 λnun for a suitable sequence (un) ⊂X. Clearly,
T u0 = T ( f (0)) = 0,
so that u0 ∈ker T . Moreover, from the equalities
σT ( f (λ)) = σT (0) = ∅(λ ∈D(0, ε)),
we obtain σT ( f (0)) = σT (u0) = ∅, and therefore, from the assumption, we
conclude that u0 = 0. For all 0 ̸= λ ∈D(0, ε), we have
0 = (λI −T ) f (λ) = (λI −T )

and therefore 0 = (λI −T )(∞
n=0 λnun+1) for every 0 ̸= λ ∈D(0, ε). By con-
tinuity this is still true for every λ ∈D(0, ε). At this point, by using the same
argument as in the ﬁrst part of the proof, it is possible to show that u1 = 0 and,
by iterating this procedure, we conclude that u2 = u3 = · · · = 0. This shows
that f ≡0 on D(0, ε), and therefore T has SVEP at 0.
To show the equivalence (ii) ⇔(iii), it sufﬁces to prove the equality
ker T ∩K(T ) = ker T ∩XT (∅) .
From Theorem 27.2.1 we have
ker T ∩K(T ) = ker T ∩XT (C \ {0}) ⊆XT ({0}) ∩XT (C \ {0}) = XT (∅) ,
so that ker T ∩K(T ) = ker T ∩K(T ) ∩XT (∅) = ker T ∩XT (∅), as required.

Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space. Then T does
not have SVEP if and only if there exists λ0 ∈σp(T ) and a corresponding
eigenvector x0 (̸= 0) such that σT (x0) = ∅. In such a case, T does not have
SVEP at λ0.

ItisclearfromthedeﬁnitionofSVEP,that,ifthesetofeigenvaluesofoperator
T has empty interior, then T has this property. Consequently, all operators
T ∈B(X) with real spectrum have SVEP. But not every bounded operator
enjoys SVEP. In fact, from Theorem 27.2.3, T has SVEP at 0 precisely when
ker T ∩K(X) = {0}, so that every non-injective, surjective operator does not
have SVEP at 0.
Corollary 27.2.5
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and let λ0 ∈C.
(i) If either
K(λ0I −T ) ∩H0(λ0I −T ) = {0}
or
N ∞(λ0I −T ) ∩(λ0I −T )∞(X) = {0},
then T has SVEP at λ0.
(ii) T has SVEP ⇔K(λI −T ) ∩H0(λI −T ) = {0} for every λ ∈C.
Proof Part (i) is an obvious consequence of Theorem 27.2.3, since both con-
ditions imply that ker (λ0I −T ) ∩K(λ0I −T ) = {0}.
Suppose that T has SVEP and x ∈K(λI −T ) ∩H0(λI −T ). By Theorem
27.2.1, we have σλI−T (x) ⊆{0} and hence σT (x) ⊆{λ}. On the other hand,
we also have, by Theorem 27.2.2, 0 /∈σλI−T (x), and hence λ /∈σT (x). Conse-
quently, σT (x) is empty and therefore, since T has SVEP, x = 0. The reverse
implication is clear from (i).

This example, based on the theory of weighted shifts, shows

□
An immediate consequence of part (ii) of Corollary 27.2.5 is that, for a quasi-
nilpotentoperator T ,wehave K(T ) = {0}.Infact, T hasSVEPand H0(T ) = X,
so that
H0(T ) ∩K(T ) = K(T ) = {0}.
We shall use this fact in the proof of the following result.
Proposition 27.2.7
Suppose that a bounded operator T ∈B(X) on a Banach
space X either has a closed quasi-nilpotent part H(λ0I −T ) or is such that
that H0(λ0 −T ) ∩K(λ0I −T ) is closed. Then
H0(λ0 −T ) ∩K(λ0I −T ) = {0},
and hence T has SVEP at λ0.
Proof Without loss of generality, we may consider λ0 = 0.
Assume ﬁrst that H0(T ) is closed. Let T denote the restriction of T to the
Banach space H0(T ). It is easily seen that H0(T ) ∩K(T ) = K(T ). On the
other hand, we have H0(T ) = H0(T ). Thus T is quasi-nilpotent, and hence
K(T ) = {0}.
Suppose now that Y := H0(T ) ∩K(T ) is closed. Clearly, Y is invariant under
T , so we can consider the restriction S := T | Y. If y ∈Y, then
∥Sny∥1/n = ∥T ny∥1/n →0
as n →∞.
Thus y ∈H0(S), and hence H0(S) = Y. This shows that S is quasi-nilpotent,
and hence has SVEP. This implies that σS(y) = {0} for all 0 ̸= y ∈Y.

27
The single-valued extension property
293
On the other hand, we also have K(S) = Y. Indeed, take an element y ∈Y.
Then there is a sequence (yn) ⊂X and a δ > 0 such that
y0 = y, T yn = yn−1
and
∥yn∥≤δn∥y∥
for all n ∈Z+. From y ∈Y = H0(T ), we obtain that yn ∈H0(T ) for each
n ∈N. Moreover, since y ∈K(T ) = XT ({0}), we easily obtain that yn ∈K(T )
(n ∈N). Thus yn ∈Y, and therefore y ∈K(S). This shows that Y ⊆K(S). The
opposite inclusion is clear since K(S) = K(T ) ∩Y ⊆Y. Hence Y = K(S).
Finally, from Theorem 27.2.1 we have
H0(T ) ∩K(T ) = Y = X S({0}) = {0}.
□
Proposition 27.2.8
Suppose that the sum H0(λ0I −T ) + (λ0I −T )(X) is
norm-dense in X. Then T ′ has SVEP at λ0.
Proof Also here we suppose that λ0 = 0. From Proposition 26.2.9, we have
the inclusion K(T ′) ⊆H0(T )⊥. Now a standard duality argument shows that
ker (T ′) ∩K(T ′) ⊆T (X)⊥∩H0(T )⊥= (T (X) ∩H0(T ))⊥.
Finally, if H(T ) + T (X) is norm-dense in X, then the last annihilator is zero.
Thus ker T ′ ∩K(T ′) = {0}, and hence, by Theorem 27.2.3, T ′ has SVEP at 0.
□
Corollary 27.2.9
Suppose for T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, either
that
H0(λ0I −T ) + K(λ0I −T )
or
N ∞(λ0I −T ) + (λ0I −T )∞(X)
is norm-dense in X. Then T ′ has SVEP at λ0.
□
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, and let f be an analytic function
on the open neighbourhoodU of σ(T ). Let f (T ) ∈B(X) be the operator deﬁned
by the classical Riesz functional calculus, as explained in Part I, Chapter 4].
We have the following remarks.
(i) If the operator T has SVEP, then f (T ) also has SVEP: see Theorem 3.3.6 of
Laursen and Neumann (2000). If f is non-constant on each of the connected
components of U, then T has SVEP if and only if f (T ) does: see Theorem
3.3.9 of Laursen and Neumann (2000).

SVEP Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
(ii) We have f (σT (x)) ⊆σ f (T )(x) (x ∈X). If T has SVEP or if the func-
tion f is non-constant on each of the connected components of U,
then f (σT (x)) = σ f (T )(x) (x ∈X): see Theorem 3.3.8 of Laursen and
Neumann (2000).
For an arbitrary operator T ∈B(X) on a Banach space X, let
((T ) := {λ ∈C : T does not have SVEP at λ} .
From the identity theorem for analytic functions it readily follows that ((T )
is open and, consequently, is contained in the interior of the spectrum σ(T ).
Clearly, ((T ) is empty precisely when T has SVEP.
The next result shows that ((T ) behaves canonically under the Riesz func-
tional calculus.
Theorem 27.2.10
Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space. Let f : U →C
be an analytic function on an open neighbourhood U of σ(T ), and suppose that
f is non-constant on each of the connected components of U. Then f (T ) has
SVEP at λ ∈C if and only if T has SVEP at every point µ ∈σ(T ) for which
f (µ) = λ. Moreover, f (((T )) = ((( f (T )).
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that f (T ) has SVEP at λ ∈C. Let µ ∈σ(T ) be such that
f (µ) = λ. In order to show that T has SVEP at µ, it sufﬁces, by Theorem
27.2.3, to show that
ker (µI −T ) ∩XµI−T (∅) = {0} .
Let x ∈ker (µI −T ) ∩XµI−T (∅) be given. Since f (µ) = λ, there exists an
analytic function g on U such that λ −f = (µ −Z)g. The Riesz functional
calculus preserves multiplication, and so
λI −f (T ) = (µI −T )g(T ) ,
and therefore x ∈ker(λI −f (T )). Moreover, from σµI−T (x) = ∅, we obtain
σT (x) = ∅, and hence σ f (T )(x) = f (σT (x)) = ∅. Consequently,
ker(µI −T ) ∩XµI−T (∅) ⊆ker(λI −f (T )) ∩XλI−f (T )(∅) ,
and hence, again by Theorem 27.2.3, T has SVEP at µ.
Conversely, let λ ∈C and suppose that T has SVEP at every µ ∈σ(T ) for
which f (µ) = λ. From the classical spectral mapping theorem, f (σ(T )) =
σ( f (T )), and so λ ∈σ( f (T )). By assumption, f is non-constant on each of
the connected components of U, and thus the function f −λ has only ﬁnitely

27
The single-valued extension property
295
many zeros in σ(T ), and these zeros are of ﬁnite multiplicity. Hence there exist
an analytic function g on U without zeros in σ(T ) and a polynomial p, of
the form p(z) = (z −µ1) · · · (z −µn), with not necessarily distinct elements
µ1, . . . , µn ∈σ(T ) such that the factorization f −λ = pg holds.
Now, assume that x ∈ker(λI −f (T )) ∩XλI−f (T )(∅). In order to prove that
f (T ) has SVEP at λ, it sufﬁces, again by Theorem 27.2.3, to show that x = 0.
From the classical spectral mapping theorem, we know that g(T ) is invertible.
Thus the equality f (T ) −λI = g(T ) f (T ) implies that p(T )x = 0, and hence
(µ1I −T )y = 0, where y := q(T )x and q(z) := (z −µ2) · · · (z −µn). On the
other hand, x ∈XλI−f (T )(∅) and f is non-constant on each of the connected
components of U. By Remark (ii) after Corollary 27.2.9, we have f (σT (x)) =
σ f (T )(x) = ∅, and therefore, since T and q(T ) commute,
σT (y) = σT (q(T )x) ⊆σT (x) = ∅.
But T has SVEP at µ1, by assumption, so, again by Theorem 27.2.3, y = 0.
Repetitions of this argument for µ2, . . . , µn then lead to the equality x = 0.
Thus f (T ) has SVEP at λ.
The last claim is obvious, being nothing else than a reformulation of the
equivalence proved above.
□
Note that in the preceding result the additional condition on the analytic
function is essential. In fact, if f is constant in U, then ((( f (T )) is certainly
empty, while f (((T )) is empty only when T has SVEP.

of SVEP at a point λ0 ∈C given in Theorem 27.2.3, the kernel ker(λ0I −T )

For every bounded operator T on a Banach space X the
following properties are equivalent:
(i) T has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) T n has SVEP at λ0 for each n ∈N;
(iii) N ∞(λ0I −T ) ∩XT (∅) = {0};

Proof The equivalence (i) ⇔(ii) is obvious from Theorem 27.2.10. Combining
this equivalence with Theorem 27.2.3, we then obtain that T has SVEP at λ0
if and only if ker(λ0I −T )n ∩XT (∅) = {0} for every n ∈N. This argument
shows the equivalence (i) ⇔(iii). The equivalence (i) ⇔(iv) follows from

27.4 Additional notes
The single-valued extension property appeared ﬁrst in Dunford (1952, 1954),
and then received a systematic treatment in Dunford and Schwartz (1958, 1963,
1971). This property also forms a preliminary topic of the book by Colojoar˘a
and C. Foia¸s (1968). The fundamental role of SVEP in local spectral theory is
more clearly explained in the recent monograph Laursen and Neumann (2000).
The characterizations of the analytical core and the quasi-nilpotent part of
an operator given in Theorem 27.2.1 and Theorem 27.2.2 are due to Vrbov´a
(1973) and Mbekhta (1987, 1990); see also Proposition 2.2 of Laursen (1992).

Except for Corollary 27.2.5, which is due to Mbekhta (1990), the source
of the results of the second section is essentially that of Aiena, Miller and
Neumann (2001) and Aiena, Colasante and Gonzalez (2002). In particular,

SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
In Chapter 27 we established many conditions which imply SVEP at a point.
The main goal of this chapter is to show that all these implications become
equivalences for an important class of operators, the class of all semi-Fredholm
operators. It will be also shown that, for these operators, SVEP at a point
λ0 ∈C is equivalent to the ﬁniteness of two important quantities, the ascent and
the descent of the operator λ0I −T . These equivalences also provide useful
information on the ﬁne structure of the spectrum. In particular, we shall show
that many spectra originating from Fredholm theory coincide whenever T or
T ′ have SVEP.
28.1 Ascent, descent, and semi-Fredholm operators
Let us recall the deﬁnition of some classical quantities associated with an op-
erator. Given a linear operator T on a vector space X, it is easy to see that
ker T n ⊆ker T n+1 and T n+1(X) ⊆T n(X) for every n ∈N.
Deﬁnition 28.1.1
The ascent of T is the smallest positive integer p = p(T ),
whenever it exists, such that ker T p = ker T p+1. If such p does not exist, set
p = ∞. Analogously, the descent of T is deﬁned to be the smallest integer
q = q(T ), whenever it exists, such that T q+1(X) = T q(X). If such q does not
exist, set q = ∞. If both p(T ) and q(T ) are ﬁnite, then T has ﬁnite chains.
Note that p(T ) = 0 means that T is injective and q(T ) = 0 means that T is
surjective. Clearly, T has ﬁnite ascent if and only if N ∞(T ) = ker T k for some
k ∈N, and, analogously, T has ﬁnite descent if and only if T ∞(X) = T k(X)
for some k ∈N.
The relevant fact is that the ﬁniteness of the ascent p(T ) may be expressed
by means of some intersection properties between kernels and ranges of the
iterates of T .

SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
299
Lemma 28.1.2
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X, and let
m ∈Z+. Then
(i) p(T ) ≤m < ∞if and only if, for every n ∈N, T m(X) ∩ker T n = {0}.
(ii) q(T ) ≤m < ∞if and only if, for every n ∈N, there exists a subspace
Yn ⊆ker T m such that X = Yn ⊕T n(X).
Proof
(i) Suppose that p(T ) ≤m < ∞and that n ∈N. Let us consider an
element y ∈T m(X) ∩ker T n. Then there exists x ∈X such that y = T mx and
T ny = 0. From this we obtain the equality T m+nx = T ny = 0, and therefore
we have x ∈ker T m+n = ker T m. Hence y = T mx = 0.
Conversely, suppose that T m(X) ∩ker T n = {0} for some m ∈N, and let
x ∈ker T m+1. Then T mx ∈ker T , and therefore
T mx ∈T m(X) ∩ker T ⊆T m(X) ∩ker T n = {0}.
Hence x ∈ker T m. We have shown that ker T m+1 ⊆ker T m. Since the opposite
inclusion is satisﬁed for all operators, we conclude that ker T m = ker T m+1.
(ii) Let q := q(T ) ≤m < ∞, and let Y be a complementary subspace to
T n(X) in X. Let {x j : j ∈J} be a basis of Y. For every element x j of the
basis there exists an element y j ∈X such that T qx j = T q+ny j. This fol-
lows because T q(Y) ⊆T q(X) = T q+n(X). Set z j := x j −T ny j. Then clearly
T qz j = T qx j −T q+ny j = 0. From this it follows that the linear subspace Yn
generated by the elements z j is contained in ker T q and a fortiori in ker T m.
From the decomposition X = Y ⊕T n(X), we obtain for every x ∈X a repre-
sentation of the form
x =

j∈J
λ jx j + T ny =

j∈J
λ j(z j + T ny j) + T ny =

j∈J
λ jz j + T nz ,
so that X = Yn + T n(X). We show that this sum is direct. Indeed, choose an
element x ∈Yn ∩T n(X). Then x = 
j∈J µ jz j = T nv for some v ∈X, and
therefore

j∈J
µ jx j =

j∈J
µ jT ny j + T nv ∈T n(X) .
From the decomposition X = Y ⊕T n(X), we then obtain that µ j = 0 for all
j ∈J, and hence that x = 0. Therefore Yn is a complement of T n(X) contained
in ker T m.
Conversely, if for n ∈N the subspace T n(X) has a complement Yn ⊆ker T m,
then T m(X) = T m(Yn) + T m+n(X) = T m+n(X), and therefore q(T ) ≤m.
□
Theorem 28.1.3
If both p(T ) and q(T ) are ﬁnite, then p(T ) = q(T ).

300
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
Proof
Set p := p(T ) and q := q(T ). Assume ﬁrst that p ≤q, so that the
inclusion T q(X) ⊆T p(X) holds. Obviously, we may suppose that q > 0. From
part (ii) of Lemma 28.1.2, we have X = ker T q + T q(X), so every element
y := T p(x) ∈T p(X)admitsthedecomposition y = z + T qw,with z ∈ker T q.
From z = T px −T qw ∈T q(X), we then obtain that z ∈ker T q ∩T q(X), and
the last intersection is {0} by part (i) of Lemma 28.1.2. Therefore, we have
y = T qw ∈T q(X), and this shows the equality T p(X) = T q(X), from which
we obtain p ≥q, so that p = q.
Assume now that q ≤p and p > 0, so that ker T q ⊆ker T p. From part (ii)
of Lemma 28.1.2, we have X = ker T q + T p(X), so that an arbitrary element
x of ker T p admits the representation x = u + T pv, with u ∈ker T q. From
T px = T pu = 0, it then follows that T 2pv = 0, so that v ∈ker T 2p = ker T p.
Hence T pv = 0, and consequently x = u ∈ker T q. This shows that we have
ker T q = ker T p, and hence q ≥p. Therefore p = q.
□
If p(T ) < ∞, then C(T ) = T ∞(X). This is a consequence of Lemma 26.1.9
and part (i) of Lemma 28.1.2. The equality C(T ) = T ∞(X) is still true when
q := q(T ) < ∞. Indeed, in this case, by deﬁnition,
ker T ∩T q(X) = ker T ∩T q+k(X)
for k ∈Z+,
so that Lemma 26.1.9 again applies.
Two other important quantities associated with a linear operator T on a vector
space X are the nullity α(T ) := dim ker T and the defect β(T ) := codim T (X).
Let (X) denote the set of all linear operators on the vector space X for which
α(T ) and β(T ) are both ﬁnite. For every T ∈(X), the index of T , deﬁned by
ind T := α(T ) −β(T ) ,
satisﬁes the basic index theorem:
ind (T S) = ind T + ind S ( T, S ∈(X)) .
See Theorem 23.1 of Heuser (1982).
In the next theorem we establish the basic relationships between the quantities
α(T ), β(T ), p(T ), and q(T ).
Proposition 28.1.4
Let T be a linear operator on a vector space X. Then the
following properties hold.
(i) If p(T ) < ∞then α(T ) ≤β(T ).
(ii) If q(T ) < ∞then β(T ) ≤α(T ).
(iii) If p(T ) = q(T ) < ∞, then α(T ) = β(T ) (possibly inﬁnite).
(iv) If α(T ) = β(T ) < ∞, and, if one chain is ﬁnite, then p(T ) = q(T ).

28
SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
301
Proof
(i) Let p := p(T ) < ∞. Obviously, if β(T ) = ∞, there is nothing to
prove. Suppose that β(T ) < ∞. It is easy to check that also β(T n) is ﬁnite. By
Lemma 28.1.2(i), we have ker T ∩T p(X) = {0}, and this implies the inequality
α(T ) < ∞. From the index theorem, we obtain
n · ind T = ind T n = α(T p) −β(T n)
(n ≥p) .
Now, suppose that q := q(T ) < ∞. We see that, for each n ≥max{p, q},
the quantity n · ind T = α(T p) −β(T p) is constant, so that ind T = 0, that is,
α(T ) = β(T ).
Consider the other case, where q = ∞. Then β(T n) →0, as n →∞, so
n · ind T eventually becomes negative, and hence ind T < 0. Therefore in this
case we have α(T ) < β(T ).
(ii) Letq := q(T ) < ∞. Also here we can suppose that α(T ) < ∞, otherwise
there is nothing to prove. Consequently, as is easy to check, we also have
β(T n) < ∞and, by Lemma 28.1.2(ii), X = Y ⊕T (X) with Y ⊆ker T q. From
this, it follows that
β(T ) = dim Y ≤α(T q) < ∞.
With appropriate changes, the index argument used in the proof of (i) shows
that β(T ) = α(T ) if p(T ) < ∞, and β(T ) < α(T ) if p(T ) = ∞.
(iii) This is clear from (i) and (ii).
(iv) This is an immediate consequence of the equality
α(T n) −β(T n) = ind T n = n · ind T = 0 ,
which is valid for every n ∈N.
□
Proposition 28.1.5
For a bounded operator T on a Banach space X, the
following implications hold:
(i) p(λ0I −T ) < ∞⇒N ∞(λ0I −T ) ∩(λ0I −T )∞(X) = {0} ⇒
T has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) q(λ0I −T ) < ∞⇒X = N ∞(λ0I −T ) + (λ0I −T )∞(X) ⇒
T ′ has SVEP at λ0.
Proof (i) There is no loss of generality in supposing that λ0 = 0. We deﬁne
p := p(T ) < ∞. Then N ∞(T ) = ker T p and T ∞(X) ⊆T p(X). From Lemma
28.1.2 (i), we then conclude that N ∞(T ) ∩T ∞(X) ⊆ker T p ∩T p(X) = {0}.
The second implication is a consequence of Theorem 27.2.3 because
ker T ∩XT (∅) ⊆N ∞(T ) ∩T ∞(X) = {0}.

302
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
(ii) Again we may suppose that λ0 = 0. Suppose that q := q(T ) < ∞. Then
T ∞(X) = T q(X) and X = T n(X) + ker T q (n ∈N) by Lemma 28.1.2(ii).
From this it easily follows that X = N ∞(T ) + T ∞(X).
In order to show that the second implication of (ii) holds, we ﬁrst note that, if
X = N ∞(T ) + T ∞(X), then N ∞(T )⊥∩T ∞(X)⊥= {0}. Now take an element
x′ ∈ker T ′ ∩XT ′(∅). Then
x′ ∈ker T ′ ⊆ker (T ′)n = ker (T n)′ = T n(X)
⊥= T n(X)⊥,
for every n ∈N and therefore x′ ∈T ∞(X)⊥.
On the other hand, from σT ′(x′) = ∅we obtain, by Theorem 27.2.1, that
x′ ∈K(T ′) ⊆(T ′)n(X′) = (T n)′(X′) ⊆(ker T n)⊥
for every n ∈N. From this, it easily follows that x′ ∈N ∞(T )⊥, and this implies
that x′ ∈N ∞(T )⊥∩T ∞(X)⊥. Therefore x′ = 0. From Theorem 27.2.3, we
then conclude that T ′ has SVEP at 0.
□
The preceding result is quite useful to establish SVEP for several classes of
operators. In fact, there are several operators which satisfy the condition that
p(λI −T ) < ∞for all λ ∈C; see the Exercises.
28.2 Fredholm operators
Deﬁnition 28.2.1
A bounded operator T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space,
is upper semi-Fredholm if α(T ) < ∞and T (X) is closed. The operator T in
B(X) is lower semi-Fredholm if β(T ) < ∞. Denote by +(X) the class of all
upper semi-Fredholm operators, and by −(X) the class of all lower semi-
Fredholm operators. The class (X) of all Fredholm operators is deﬁned by
(X) := +(X) ∩−(X), while the class of all semi-Fredholm operators is
deﬁned by ±(X) := +(X) ∪−(X).
Note that, if β(T ) < ∞, then T (X) is closed (see Chapter 26). If T ∈±(X),
we can deﬁne the index of T as above. Obviously, the index of a semi-Fredholm
operator is an integer or ±∞.
The three sets +(X), −(X), and (X) are semi-groups, in the sense that,
if T, S belong to one of these sets, then also the products T S and ST lie in the
same set. Moreover, these three sets are each open, T ∈+(X) if and only if
T ′ ∈−(X′), and dually, T ∈−(X) if and only if T ′ ∈+(X′); the reader
can ﬁnd these classical results on Fredholm theory in Caradus, Pfaffenberger
and Yood (1974).

28
SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
303
Note that, if T ∈±(X), then T n ∈±(X (n ∈N), and this implies that
T ∞(X) is closed because the subspaces T n(X) are closed for each n ∈N.
From Proposition 26.1.10, we then have T (T ∞(X)) = T ∞(X), and hence it fol-
lows from Proposition 26.1.7 that T ∞(X) ⊆K(T ). But the opposite inclusion
K(T ) ⊆T ∞(X) is true for every operator T ∈B(X), so that K(T ) = T ∞(X)
for every T ∈±(X).
To explore SVEP at a point in the case of semi-Fredholm operators, we need
a decomposition property for these operators due to Kato (1958). We state this
classical result without proving it (the proof of this decomposition is rather
involved; the interested reader will ﬁnd a clear proof in West (1987)).
Theorem 28.2.2
Let T ∈±(X), where X is a Banach space. Then there
exist closed T -invariant subspaces M, N of X such that X = M ⊕N, T | M
is semi-regular, T | N is nilpotent, and N is ﬁnite-dimensional.
For an arbitrary bounded operator T ∈B(X), a pair (M, N) of closed T -
invariant subspaces is called a Kato decomposition for T if the decompo-
sition observed in Theorem 28.2.2 for semi-Fredholm operators holds, that
is, X = M ⊕N, T | M is semi-regular, T | N is nilpotent, and N is ﬁnite-
dimensional. In the literature the operators which admit a Kato decomposition
are called essentially semi-regular; see M¨uller (1994). A semi-regular operator
is obviously another example of an operator which admits a Kato decomp-
osition. Note that not every semi-Fredholm operator is semi-regular; a semi-
Fredholm T is semi-regular precisely when its jump j(T ) = 0; see Part IV,
Chapter 24 for the deﬁnition and also West (1987).
It is not difﬁcult to show that, if (M, N) is a Kato decomposition for T ,
then the pair (N ⊥, M⊥) is a Kato decomposition for T ′. The proof of this fact
requires methods of standard duality theory (Exercise).
Lemma 28.2.3
Suppose that (M, N) is a Kato decomposition for T ∈B(X).
Then:
(i) K(T ) = K(T | M) and K(T ) is closed;
(ii) ker T | M = K(T ) ∩ker T ;
(iii) K(T ) = T ∞(X).
Proof (i) To prove the equality K(T ) = K(T | M), we need only to show the
inclusion K(T ) ⊆M. Let x ∈K(T ) and, according to the deﬁnition of K(T ),
let (un) be a sequence of X and δ > 0 be such that x = u0, T un+1 = un, and
∥un∥≤δn∥x∥
(n ∈Z+).

Clearly, T nun = x (n ∈N). From the decomposition X = M ⊕N, we know
that x = y + z, un = yn + zn, with y, yn ∈M and z, zn ∈N for every n ∈N.
Then x = T nun = T nyn + T nzn, hence, by the uniqueness of the decomposi-
tion, y = T nyn and z = T nzn. Let P denote the projection of X onto N along
M. From the estimate
∥((T |N)P)n∥1/n ≤∥(T | N)n∥1/n∥Pn∥1/n = ∥(T | N)n∥1/n∥P∥,
we infer that (T |N)P is quasi-nilpotent, since, by assumption, T | N is nilpo-
tent, and hence quasi-nilpotent. Therefore, if ε > 0, there is a positive integer
n0 such that ∥(T | N P)n∥1/n < ε (n > n0). Now we have
∥z∥= ∥T nzn∥= ∥T n Pvn∥= ∥T n Pnvn∥∥(T P)nvn∥≤εnδn∥x∥
(n > n0) .
Since ε is arbitrary, the last term of the previous inequality converges to 0, so
z = 0 and hence x = y ∈M.
The ﬁnal assertion is a consequence of Proposition 26.1.12 since T | M is
semi-regular.
(ii) This equality is an immediate consequence of (i). Indeed, K(T ) ⊆M and,
since T | M is semi-regular, from Proposition 26.1.12 and part (i) we obtain
that
ker T | M ⊆(T | M)∞(M) = K(T | M) = K(T ) .
Hence
K(T ) ∩ker T = K(T ) ∩M ∩ker T = K(T ) ∩ker T | M = ker T | M .
(iii) If (T | N)d = 0, then we have
T n(X) = T n(M) ⊕T n(N) = T n(M) ⊕{0}
(n ≥d) ,
and this implies that T ∞(X) = (T | M)∞(M). The semi-regularity of T | M
then yields that K(T | M) = (T | M)∞(M), and hence, by (i), we have
T ∞(X) = K(T | M) = K(T ).
□
Remark 28.2.4
It should be noted that, if (M, N) is a Kato decomposition
for λ0I −T , then T has SVEP at λ0 if and only if T | M has SVEP at λ0. In
fact, if T has SVEP at λ0, then T | M has SVEP at λ0 since the SVEP at a point
is inherited by the restrictions to closed invariant subspaces. On the other hand,
if T | M has SVEP at λ0, the semi-regularity of (λ0I −T ) | M entails that the
restriction (λ0I −T ) | M is injective, and therefore
ker(λ0I −T ) | M = K(T ) ∩ker(λ0I −T ) = {0}.

SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
305
Thus, by Theorem 27.2.3, T has SVEP at λ0. Note that this argument also
shows T has SVEP at λ0 if and only if (λ0I −T ) | M is injective. An obvious
consequence of this fact is that a semi-regular operator T has SVEP at λ0 if and
only if λ0I −T is injective, or, equivalently, λ0I −T is bounded below.
Lemma 28.2.5
Let T ∈B(X), and suppose that X is the direct sum of two
closedsubspaces M, N eachinvariantunder T ,forwhich T | M issemi-regular.
Then T | M is surjective if and only if T ′ | N ⊥is injective.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that T (M) = M and x′ ∈ker T ′ | N ⊥= ker T ′ ∩N ⊥. For
every m ∈M, there exists m1 ∈M such that T m1 = m. We have
⟨m, x′⟩= ⟨T m1, x′⟩= ⟨m1, T ′x′⟩= 0 ,
and hence x′ ∈M⊥∩N ⊥= {0}.
Conversely, suppose that T (M) ⊂M and T (M) ̸= M. By assumption, T (M)
is closed since T | M is semi-regular, and hence, via the Hahn–Banach theorem,
there exists z′ ∈X′ such that z′ ∈T (M)⊥and z′ /∈M⊥. Now, from the decom-
position X′ = N ⊥⊕M⊥, we have z′ = n′ + m′ with n′ ∈N ⊥and m′ ∈M⊥.
For every m ∈M, we obtain
⟨m, T ′n′⟩= ⟨T m, n′⟩= ⟨T m, z′⟩−⟨T m, m′⟩= 0 .
Hence T ′n′ ∈T ′(N ⊥) ∩M⊥= N ⊥∩M⊥= {0}, so that
0 ̸= n′ ∈ker T ′ ∩N ⊥.
□
Theorem 28.2.6
Suppose that λ0I −T ∈±(X). Then the implications (i)
and (ii) of Proposition 28.1.5 are equivalences.
Proof
To show the equivalence in (i) of Proposition 28.1.5, we need only
prove that, if T has SVEP at λ0, then p(λ0I −T ) < ∞. Let (M, N) be a Kato
decomposition for λ0I −T , and let k ∈N be such that ((λ0I −T ) | N)k = 0.
Suppose that p := p(λ0I −T ) = ∞. Then (λ0I −T )|M is not injective; other-
wise, if (λ0I −T )|M were injective, for n ≥k we would have
ker(λ0I −T )n = ker(λ0I −T ) | M)n = ker(λ0I −T ) | N)n = {0} ,
and hence p(λ0I −T ) < ∞. Hence (λ0I −T )|M is not injective, and therefore
T does not have the SVEP at λ0.
Analogously, to show the equivalence in (ii) of Proposition 28.1.5, we need
only prove that, if T ′ has SVEP at λ0, then q(λ0I −T ) < ∞. Suppose that

306

SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
q(λ0I −T ) = ∞. Then λ0I −T | M is not surjective; for otherwise, for every
positive integer n ≥k, we would have
(λ0I −T )n(X) = (λ0I −T )n(M) ⊕{0} = M,
and hence q(λ0I −T ) < ∞. Now, by Lemma 28.2.5, it follows that
λ0I ′ −T ′ | N ⊥is not injective, and hence T ′ does not have SVEP at λ0.
□
Recall that T is said to be a Riesz–Schauder operator if T is a Fredholm
operator having both ascent and descent ﬁnite. Note that, by Lemma 28.1.2, a
Riesz–Schauder operator has index 0.
The next result shows that the class of operators without SVEP is rather large,
since every Fredholm operator having index greater than 0 belongs to the class.
Corollary 28.2.7
If λ0I −T ∈±(X), where X is a Banach space, and if T
has SVEP at λ0, then λ0I −T is upper semi-Fredholm and
ind(λ0I −T ) ≤0.
Additionally, if also T ′ has SVEP at λ0, then λ0I −T is a Riesz–Schauder
operator.
Proof The ﬁrst assertion is clear since the condition p(λ0I −T ) < ∞entails
that α(λ0I −T ) ≤β(λ0I −T ) by Proposition 28.1.4. The second assertion
is also clear because, if both the operators T and T ′ have SVEP at λ0, then
p(λ0I −T ) < ∞
and
q(λ0I −T ) < ∞.
Consequently,
p(λ0I −T ) =
q(λ0I −T ) by Theorem 28.1.3, and therefore, by Proposition 28.1.4,
α(λ0I −T ) = β(λ0I −T ) < ∞.
□
It should be noted that the last assertion of Corollary 28.2.7 applies to every
decomposable operator T on a Banach space, that is, if T is semi-Fredholm
and decomposable, then T is a Riesz–Schauder operator.
Proposition 28.2.8
Let λ0I −T ∈±(X) and suppose that (M, N) is a Kato
decomposition for λ0I −T . Then the following properties are equivalent:
(i) T has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) H0(λ0I −T ) = N;
(iii) H0(λ0I −T ) is ﬁnite-dimensional;
(iv) H0(λ0I −T ) is closed;
(v) H0(λ0I −T ) ∩K(λ0I −T ) = {0};

28
SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
307
In this case, set p = p(λ0I −T ). Then
H0(λ0I −T ) = N ∞(λ0I −T ) = ker (λ0I −T )p .
Proof There is no loss of generality if we suppose that λ0 = 0.
Clearly, (ii) ⇒(iii) ⇒(iv), and, from Proposition 27.2.7, we know that the
implications (iv) ⇒(v) ⇒(i) hold, so we need only prove that (i) ⇒(ii).
(i) ⇒(ii) First note that, if the operator T admits a Kato decomposition
(M, N), then H0(T ) = H0(T | M) + H0(T | N). The inclusion
H0(T ) ⊇H0(T | M) + H0(T | N)
is obvious. In order to show the opposite inclusion, let us consider an arbitrary
element x ∈H0(T ), and let x = u + v, with u ∈M and v ∈N. Since T | N is
quasi-nilpotent, we have N = H0(T | N) ⊆H0(T ). Consequently,
u = x −v ∈H0(T ) ∩M = H0(T | M),
and therefore H0(T ) ⊆H0(T | M) + H0(T | N). Hence
H0(T ) = H0(T | M) + H0(T | N) = H0(T | M) + N .
Now, suppose that T has SVEP at 0. Then, as observed in Remark 28.2.4,
T | M is injective and therefore, by Proposition 26.2.9,
H0(T | M) =
∞

n=1
ker (T | M)n = {0} .
This shows that H0(T ) = N.
To prove the last assertion, observe ﬁrst that the inclusions
ker T n ⊆N ∞(T ) ⊆H0(T )
hold for every T ∈B(X) and n ∈N. Let k ∈N be such that (T |N)k = 0. Then
H0(T ) = N ⊆ker T k, and hence H0(T ) = N ∞(T ) = ker T k. From this, it fol-
lows that p := p(T ) ≤k, and therefore ker T k = ker T p.
□
Proposition 28.2.9
Let λ0I −T ∈±(X), and suppose that (M, N) is a Kato
decomposition for T . Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) T ′ has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) K(T ) = M;
(iii) K(T ) is ﬁnite-codimensional;

308
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
(iv) X = H0(λ0I −T ) + K(λ0I −T );
(v) H0(λ0I −T ) + K(λ0I −T ) is norm-dense in X.
In this case, set q = q(λ0I −T ). Then
K(λ0I −T ) = T ∞(λ0I −T ) = (λ0I −T )q(X) .
Proof Also here we suppose that λ0 = 0.
(i) ⇒(ii) We know that the pair (N ⊥, M⊥) is a Kato decomposition for the
semi-Fredholm operator T ′, thus T ′ | N ⊥is semi-regular, T ′ | M⊥is nilpotent,
and further dim M⊥= codim M < ∞. From the assumption, T ′ has SVEP at 0,
so the semi-regularity of T ′ | N ⊥entails that T ′ | N ⊥is injective, and hence, by
Lemma 28.2.5, T | M is surjective. This shows that M = K(T | M) = K(T ).
The implication (ii) ⇒(iii) is obvious.
(iii) ⇒(i) Since K(T ) = T ∞(X), the space T ∞(X) has ﬁnite codimension.
Because T ∞(X) ⊆T q(X) for every q ∈N, we then conclude that q(T ) < ∞,
so T ′ has SVEP at 0 by Proposition 28.2.6.
(i) ⇒(iv) Assume that T ′ has SVEP at 0, or, equivalently, that q < ∞,
where q = q(T ). Then K(T ) = T ∞(X) = T q(X). Moreover, we see that X =
ker T q + T n(X) (n ∈N) by Lemma 28.1.2(ii), and therefore it follows that
X = H0(λ0I −T ) + K(λ0I −T ).
The implication (iv) ⇒(v) is obvious, while the implication (v) ⇒(i) has
been proved in Corollary 27.2.9.
The last assertion is clear.
□
Let σap(T ) be the approximate point spectrum of T and let σsu(T ) be the sur-
jectivity spectrum of T ; for the deﬁnitions, see Part IV, Chapter 22. Obviously,
these spectra are non-empty sets since they both contain σK(T ), and hence, by
Theorem 26.2.11, they contain also the boundary of σ(T ). From Remark 28.2.4
it easily follows that, if T has SVEP, then σK(T ) = σap(T ). We have already
observed that T has SVEP at every point which is not a limit point of σ(T ).
What happens if we consider instead of σ(T ) some distinguished parts of the
spectrum? A simple argument shows the following implications:
σap(T ) does not cluster at λ0 ⇒T has SVEP at λ0 ,
(28.2.1)
and
σsu(T ) does not cluster at λ0 ⇒T ′ has SVEP at λ0 .
(28.2.2)
Indeed, if σap(T ) does not cluster at λ0, then there is an open disc D(λ0, δ)
centred at λ0 such that λI −T is injective for every λ ∈D(λ0, δ) with λ ̸= λ0.
Let f : D (λ0, ε) →X be an analytic function deﬁned on another open disc
D(λ0, ε) centred at λ0 for which the equation (λI −T ) f (λ) = 0 holds for

28
SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
309
every λ ∈D(λ0, ε). Obviously, we may suppose that ε ≤δ. It is clear that
f (λ) ∈ker (λI −T ) = {0} for every λ ∈D(λ0, ε) with λ ̸= λ0. Thus f (λ) = 0
for every λ ∈D(λ0, ε) with λ ̸= λ0. From the continuity of f at λ0, we conclude
that f (λ0) = 0. Hence f ≡0 in D(λ0, ε), and therefore T has SVEP at λ0.
The second implication is an immediate consequence of the equality
σsu(T ) = σap(T ′).
Note that neither of the implications (28.2.1) and (28.2.2) may be reversed
in general. Indeed, if λ0 is a non-isolated boundary point of σ(T ), then σap(T )
and σsu(T ) cluster at λ0, but, as observed before, T and T ′ have SVEP at λ0.
An example of an operator T having the SVEP and such that every spectral
point is the limit of points of σap(T ) may be found among the unilateral weighted
right shift operators. Indeed, there exist unilateral weighted right shift opera-
tors T on ℓp(N) which have SVEP and for which σ(T ) = σap(T ) = σsu(T ) and
σ(T ) is a closed ball centred at 0 with radius r > 0; see Laursen and Neumann
(2000).
The next result shows that the implications (28.2.1) and (28.2.2) are actually
equivalences when λ0I −T is semi-Fredholm.
Theorem 28.2.10
Suppose that λ0I −T ∈±(X). Then the following equiv-
alences hold:
(i) T has SVEP at λ0 ⇔σap(T ) does not cluster at λ0;
(ii) T ′ has SVEP at λ0 ⇔σsu(T ) does not cluster at λ0.
Proof
(i) We need only to prove that, if T has SVEP at λ0, then σap(T ) does
not cluster at λ0. Evidently, we may suppose that λ0 = 0. Assume that T has
SVEP at 0 and T ∈±(X). Because ±(X) is open there exists ε > 0 such that
λI −T is semi-Fredholm, and hence has closed range, for every |λ| < ε. Then
λ ∈(D(0, ε) \ {0}) ∩σap(T ) if and only if λ is an eigenvalue for T . Now it is
easy to see that ker (λI −T ) ⊆T ∞(X) for every λ ̸= 0, so that every non-zero
eigenvalue of T belongs to the spectrum of the restriction T | T ∞(X).
Finally, suppose that 0 is a cluster point of σap(T ). Let (λn) be a sequence
of non-zero eigenvalues which converges to 0. Then λn ∈σ(T | T ∞(X)) for
every n ∈N, and hence 0 ∈σ(T | T ∞(X)) since the spectrum of an operator
is closed . But T has SVEP at 0, and thus T | M is injective. From part (ii) of
Lemma 28.2.3, we have
{0} = ker T | M = ker T ∩T ∞(X) ,
so the restriction T | T ∞(X) is injective.
On the other hand, from the equality T (T ∞(X)) = T ∞(X), we know that
T | T ∞(X) is surjective, so that 0 /∈σ(T | T ∞(X)), a contradiction.

(ii) The equivalence follows from the ﬁrst part once we have observed that
always σap(T ′) = σsu(T ).
□
The result of Theorem 28.2.10 is quite useful for establishing the mem-
bership of cluster points of some distinguished parts of the spectrum to the
semi-Fredholm spectrum σs f (T ) and to the essential spectrum σe(T ), which
are deﬁned as follows:
σs f (T ) := {λ ∈C : λI −T /∈±(X)}
and
σe(T ) := {λ ∈C : λI −T /∈(X)} .
Clearly σs f (T ) ⊆σe(T ). A ﬁrst application is given in the following result,
which improves a classical Putnam theorem about the non-isolated boundary
points of the spectrum as a subset of the essential spectrum.
Corollary 28.2.11
For every operator T ∈B(X) on a Banach space X, every
non-isolated boundary point of σ(T ) belongs to σs f (T ), and in particular to
σe(T ).
Proof If λ0 ∈∂σ(T ) is non-isolated in σ(T ), then σap(T ) clusters at λ0 because
∂σ(T ) ⊆σap(T ). But T has SVEP at every point of ∂σ(T ), and so, by Theorem
28.2.10s, λ0I −T /∈±(X).
□
Corollary 28.2.12
Suppose that T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, has
SVEP. Then all cluster points of σap(T ) belong to σs f (T ). Analogously, if T ′
has SVEP, then all cluster points of σsu(T ) belong to σs f (T ).
Proof
Suppose that λ0 /∈σs f (T ). Since T has SVEP, and in particular has
SVEP at λ0, then σap(T ) does not cluster at λ0, by Theorem 28.2.10.
Analogously, suppose that λ0 /∈σs f (T ). Since T ′ has SVEP at λ0, then σsu(T )
does not cluster at λ0, again by Theorem 28.2.10.
□
All the results established above have interesting applications. Recall that
the upper semi-Fredholm spectrum and lower semi-Fredholm spectrum are
deﬁned by
σu f (T ) := {λ ∈C : λI −T /∈+(X)} ,
σl f (T ) := {λ ∈C : λI −T /∈−(X)} ,
respectively. Clearly,
σs f (T ) ⊆σu f (T ) ⊆σap(T ) .
(28.2.3)

SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators
311
In the next result we consider a situation which occurs in some concrete cases.
Proposition 28.2.13
Let T ∈B(X) be an operator for which σap(T ) = ∂σ(T )
and every λ ∈∂σ(T ) is not isolated in σ(T ). Then
σs f (T ) = σu f (T ) = σap(T ) = σK(T ) .
Proof The operator T has SVEP at every point of the boundary as well as at
every point λ which belongs to the remaining part of the spectrum since σap(T )
does not cluster at this λ. Hence T has SVEP. By Corollary 28.2.12, we have
σap(T ) ⊆σs f (T ), and hence, from the inclusions (28.2.3), we conclude that
σs f (T ) = σu f (T ) = σap(T ).
Finally, σK(T) = σap(T) because T has SVEP, so the proof is complete.
□
Corollary 28.2.14
Suppose that σsu(T ) = ∂σ(T ) and that every λ ∈∂σ(T )
is not isolated in σ(T ). Then
σs f (T ) = σl f (T ) = σsu(T ) = σK(T ) .
Proof From the assumption, we obtain σsu(T ) = σap(T ′) = ∂σ(T ) = ∂σ(T ′),
and so we can apply Proposition 28.2.13. The statement then follows once we
have observed that σs f (T ) = σs f (T ′), that σl f (T ) = σu f (T ′), and ﬁnally that
σK(T ) = σK(T ′).
□
Proposition 28.2.13 applies to arbitrary non-invertible isometries. In fact for
these operators we have σ(T ) = D(0,r(T )) and σap(T ) = ∂D(0, ν(T )), where
ν(T ) is the spectral radius of T ; see Proposition 1.3.2 of Laursen and Neumann
(2000).
Proposition 28.2.13 also applies to the Ces´aro operator C p deﬁned in Part IV,
Example 24.1.3. As noted in T. L. Miller V. G. Miller, and Smith (1998), the
spectrum of the operator C p is the closed disc D(p/2, p/2) and
σe(C p) = σap(C p) = ∂D(p/2, p/2).
From Proposition 28.2.13, we also have
σs f (C p) = σu f (C p) = σK(C p) = ∂D(p/2, p/2) .
Proposition 28.2.15
Let X be a Banach space, and suppose that λ0I −T in
(X) has index 0. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) T has SVEP at λ0;
(ii) T ′ has SVEP at λ0;

312
Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
(iii) p(λ0I −T ) < ∞;
(iv) q(λ0I −T ) < ∞;
(v) N ∞(λ0I −T ) ∩(λ0I −T )∞(X) = {0};
(vi) X = N ∞(λ0I −T ) + (λ0I −T )∞(X);
(vii) X = N ∞(λ0I −T ) ⊕(λ0I −T )∞(X);
(viii) σ(T ) does not cluster at λ0;
(ix) λ0I −T is a Riesz–Schauder operator.
Proof If α(λ0I −T ) = β(λ0I −T ) < ∞, then
p(λ0I −T ) < ∞⇔q(λ0I −T ) < ∞.
The equivalence of the statements (i)–(ix) then easily follows by combining the
preceding results.
Two other important spectra originating from the theory of Fredholm op-
erators are the Weyl spectrum and the Browder spectrum. The Weyl spectrum
σw(T ) of T ∈B(X) is deﬁned to be the complement of those complex λ ∈C
such that λI −T ∈(X) and ind(λI −T ) = 0. The Browder spectrum σb(T )
of T is deﬁned to be the complement of those complex λ ∈C such that λI −T
is Riesz–Schauder. Obviously,
σs f (T ) ⊆σe(T ) ⊆σw(T ) ⊆σb(T ) .
The next result extends to decomposable operators on Banach spaces some
classical results valid for normal operators on Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 28.2.16
Let X be a Banach space, and let T ∈B(X). Suppose that
T or T ′ has SVEP. Then σb(T ) = σw(T ). If both T and T ′ have SVEP, then
σs f (T ) = σe(T ) = σw(T ) = σb(T ) .
In particular, these equalities hold for every decomposable operator.
Proof Suppose ﬁrst that T has SVEP. By Proposition 28.2.15, T is a Fredholm
operator having index 0 if and only if T is a Riesz–Schauder operator, and hence
σb(T ) = σw(T ). The same argument works also in the case that T ′ has SVEP
since T and T ′ are simultaneously Weyl or Browder, so that σw(T ) = σw(T ′)
and σb(T ) = σb(T ′). If both T and T ′ have SVEP then, from Corollary 28.2.7,
we easily obtain that σs f (T ) = σe(T ) = σb(T ).

1. Let T be a bounded linear operator on a Banach space. Each of the two con-
ditions ‘p(λ0I −T ) < ∞’ and ‘the space H0(λ0I −T ) is closed’ implies

other. Hint: consider the operator T deﬁned in Exercise 27.3.4, and the opera-

has SVEP. Hint: show that p(λI −T ) ≤1 (λ ∈C). Alternatively, show that
H0(λI −T ) = ker (λI −T ) (λ ∈C).
4. An operator T satisﬁes a polynomial growth condition if there exists K > 0
and δ > 0 for which
∥exp(iλT )∥≤K(1 + |λ|δ)
(λ ∈R) .
Let P(X) denote the class of all operators which satisfy this condition. The
polynomial growth condition may be reformulated as follows: T ∈P(X) if
and only if σ(T ) ⊆R and there are constants K > 0 and δ > 0 such that
∥(λI −T )−1∥≤K(1 + |Im λ|−δ)
for all λ ∈C with Im λ ̸= 0; see Theorem 1.5.19 of Laursen and Neumann
(2000). Show that p(λI −T ) < ∞(λ ∈C). Hint: show that, if T ∈P(X)
and if c := Im λ > 0, then
(λI −T )−1 = −i
 ∞
0
eiλt e−itT dt .
Assume then that λ = 0 and put m := [δ] + 1, where δ is as above. Show
that p(T ) ≤m for every λ ∈C. See Barnes (1989) for details. Note that
P(X) coincides with the class of all generalized scalar operators having real
spectra; see Theorem 1.5.19 of Laursen and Neumann (2000).
5. Let λ0 be an isolated point of σ(T ), and denote by P0 the spectral projection
associated with λ0, as in Part I, Chapter 4. Show that ker P0 = K(λ0I −T )

Part V
SVEP and Fredholm theory, Pietro Aiena
and that P0(X) = H0(λ0I −T ). The proof of the second equality is not
obvious; see Proposition 49.1 of Heuser (1982).
6. Let R and L denote the right and the left shift operator, respectively, on
ℓ2(N). Show that the operator T := L ⊕R ∈L(ℓ2(N) × ℓ2(N)) is a Fred-
holm operator with ind T < 0 and that T does not have SVEP at 0.
7. Show that, if T ∈B(X) is essentially semi-regular, then there exists a disc
D(0, ε) for which λI −T is semi-regular for all λ ∈D(0, ε) \ {0}. Hint: if
(M, N) is a Kato decomposition for T and T0 := T | T ∞(X), take
ε := min{γ (T | M), γ (T0)}.
8. Show that, if T ∈B(X) is essentially semi-regular, then there exists a ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace F of X such that N ∞(T ) ⊆T ∞(X) + F. The con-
verse is true if we assume that T (X) is closed; see M¨uller (1994).
9. Suppose that T, S ∈B(X) are commuting operators for which T S is es-
sentially semi-regular. Show that both T and S are essentially semi-regular.
Hint: use the result of Exercise 8, and see the remark after Proposition 26.1.4.
10. Let T ∈B(X), where X is a Banach space, be essentially semi-regular.
Then the operator T : X/T ∞(X) →X/T ∞(X) induced by T is upper
semi-Fredholm and also p(T ) < ∞.
11. Let f be an analytic function deﬁned on an open set containing σ(T ) such
that f is non-constant on the connected components of ρ(T ). Show that
f (σap(T )) = σap( f (T )) and f (σsu(T )) = σsu( f (T )). Hint: show ﬁrst that
σsu(T ) = 
x∈X σT (x), and then use remark (ii) before Theorem 27.2.10.
12. Let X be a Banach space, and take T ∈B(X). Show that
σb(p(T )) = p(σb(T ))
for every polynomial p. Hint: use Theorem 27.2.10. It should be noted that
this equality holds if we replace p by an analytic function deﬁned on an
open neighbourhood U of σ(T ); see Gramsch and Lay (1971).
13. Let X be a Banach space, and take T ∈B(X). Suppose that T is essentially
semi-regular and quasi-nilpotent. Show that X is ﬁnite-dimensional and T
is nilpotent.
28.4 Additional notes
Most of the material of this chapter is a sample of results of Aiena and
Monsalve (2000, 2001), Aiena, Colasante and Gonzalez (2001), and Aiena
and Rosas (2003). In these papers the results have been established in the more

SVEP for semi-Fredholm operators

general situation of Kato type operators, that is, operators on a Banach space for
which there exists a decomposition X = M ⊕N, where M and N are closed
T -invariant subspaces, such that T | M is semi-regular and T | N is nilpotent.
Some of these results, in the special case of semi-Fredholm operators, may be
found in Finch (1975) and Schmoeger (1995). Note that some of the equiva-
lences of Proposition 28.2.6, Proposition 28.2.8, and Proposition 28.2.9 have
been established in West (1987) by using methods of Fredholm theory, without
involving local spectral theory.
The condition that p(λI −T ) < ∞for all λ ∈C has been investigated in
Laursen (1992) by different methods. In this paper the reader may ﬁnd some
interesting open problems. Finally, results very close to those established in the
corollaries of Theorem 28.2.10 may be found in Section 3.7 of Laursen and
Neumann (2000).
