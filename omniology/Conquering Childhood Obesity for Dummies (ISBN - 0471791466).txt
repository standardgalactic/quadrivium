About the Authors
Kimberly A. Tessmer, RD, LD, is a registered dietitian and freelance writer
who currently owns and operates Nutrition Focus, a consulting company spe-
cializing in nutrition and weight management. She has authored numerous
books and has written articles for several national magazines. Kim is a
member of the American Dietetic Association and the ADA Practice Group
“Nutrition Entrepreneurs.” Kim resides in Cleveland, OH, with her husband
Greg and daughter Tori.
Meghan Beecher is a Project Coordinator in the Childhood Weight Control
Clinical Research Study at the University of Buffalo, a two-year study funded
by a grant from the National Institutes of Health and run by Dr. Leonard
Epstein, a leading expert in the field of childhood obesity. The study teaches
obese children and their parents how to adopt a healthier lifestyle, which
includes instruction about portion control, counting calories, and exercise.
Prior to her involvement in the UB study, Meghan taught preschool and 
was also employed by the Montana Conservation Corps (a branch of
Americorps), where she introduced adolescents to outdoor activities as a
means of improving their lives. Because she is an avid runner, Meghan is well
aware of the benefits of exercise and nutrition and was eager to find a career
that would combine her love of children with her interest in health. When the
UB study concludes, Meghan, a graduate of Xavier University with a BA in
Social Work, plans on continuing in this field, educating children on the
merits of a healthy lifestyle. 
Shelly Hagen is the co-author of Baby’s First Year For Dummies and has also
authored eight books in the bestselling Everything series, including The
Everything Destination Weddings Book, The Everything Father of the Bride
Book, and The Everything Body Language Book. As a freelance writer and
editor, Ms. Hagen has also performed extensive ghostwriting and book edit-
ing work, and has written features for The Saratogian daily newspaper. She
has a degree in Literature from SUNY Empire State and lives in Saratoga
Springs, NY, with her husband, Mike, and three sons, Sam, Hal, and Nolan. 


Dedication
Kimberly Tessmer: To my beautiful new daughter, Tori, the light of my life!
Meghan Beecher: To my father, you have been an amazing role model my
whole life. You have always supported me in all of my activities and life’s
challenges. You have set a perfect example as a father, a friend, a business
man, and an avid morning runner. I am so grateful for the guidance you have
given me throughout my life. To Will, from the very beginning you have been
the support I needed to make significant changes in my life. Your trust and
encouragement in me and my abilities means so much.  Here’s to the rest of
our lives together.
Shelly Hagen: For my husband, the love of my life, who always knows that
everything will work itself out in the end.

Kimberly Tessmer: Thanks to various dietitians that I counted on for their
expert advice and opinions. Thank you also to The American Dietetic
Association for their invaluable resources.
Meghan Beecher: Thank you to Leonard H. Epstein for giving me the oppor-
tunity to be apart of your important research and for having confidence in
my abilities as a project coordinator. To Jennifer and Molly, you are not only
my sisters but my friends, and you have helped me become who I am today.

Shelly Hagen: Many thanks to Jessica Faust at Bookends Literary Agency for

Negrin, Megan Brenn-White, and Cindy Guirino for their outstanding recipe

both are incredibly knowledgeable in their fields and so eager to help children
lead healthier lives. Without them, this book honestly would not have been
possible, and I am very grateful for their insight and assistance. Lastly, I need
to thank to my husband, Mike, and my boys, Sam, Hal and Nolan, for their
support and for being so patient when I’m working my way through a pile of

Introduction
W
hat is it about overweight children that just breaks your heart? Is it that
they sometimes have a hard time fitting in with their peers, or is it that
they suffer from health problems that used to mainly afflict adults? Truly obese
children used to be an anomaly in most schools; one or two were common, but
you didn’t see anywhere near as many severely overweight children as you see
today. The increased number of obese children means that there are a lot of
kids out there who have serious issues with food, lack of physical activity, and
the emotional and physical conditions that result from being obese.
We wrote Conquering Childhood Obesity For Dummies not to say that, “Every
child should be skinny, skinny, skinny!” We know that’s not realistic (no more
realistic than saying that every adult woman should weigh 110 pounds and
have curves in all the right places — please). People come in different shapes
and sizes; that’s just the way nature works. What we’re concerned with is the
detrimental health effects that obese children face.
This book is all about making healthy lifestyle changes to improve the physical
and emotional well-being of the obese child and her entire family. Studies have
shown that a child does far better, both in the short and long term, if at least
one parent is involved with her weight-loss efforts. And because healthy living
never hurt anyone, we want to get your whole family eating more healthfully
and making physical activity a part of their normal, everyday routines!
About This Book
What makes this book different from all the other weight-loss and diet books
flooding the market is that it doesn’t focus on weight loss. We’re much more
interested in helping obese kids feel better about themselves by improving
their health. We’re not working on the assumption that every child whose
parents read this book is going to end up being thin. Some people are just
programmed to be larger than their peers. However, cutting back on fat and
increasing your child’s activity level will lead to better health. When he feels
better, he can do more, and the more he does, the better he feels.
This book isn’t about eating specific foods on certain days in order to lose
weight (in other words, this isn’t a new-age diet book); rather, it’s about breaking
down the cycles of unhealthy living and replacing them with healthy habits.

What You’re Not to Read
Assume that all the really super-important information in this book is found in
the text itself and not in the sidebars, which are shaded gray boxes of informa-
tion scattered throughout each chapter. Although we think the sidebars are
incredibly interesting (naturally), we understand that many people don’t want
to be bothered with reading anything other than need-to-know information. (If
you’re interested in all facets of this topic, by all means soak up those side-
bars.) Also, you can safely skip over information marked with a Technical Stuff
icon. Like sidebars, these icons mark interesting information that isn’t vital to
your understanding of the text.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you’re reading this book because you either have an over-
weight child or because you work with children and are concerned for their
well-being. Either way, you need not be an expert of any sort to understand
the information presented here. Conquering Childhood Obesity For Dummies
isn’t a medical text, nor is it a book about exercise physiology. When we do
discuss anatomy and medical conditions, we stick to the bare minimum of
scientific detail and break that down into language that’s simple to read and
understand. We assume that you don’t want to have to read this book with a
dictionary and a calculator in each hand; so you can assume that we don’t
overly complicate the subject.
How This Book Is Organized
This book breaks down into 5 parts and 19 chapters. We organized the informa-
tion by following a chronicle of family involvement: First, you educate yourself
on the issues surrounding the problem. Next, you get into the meat of how to
solve the problem. You follow that up by troubleshooting any areas of difficulty,
and you finish with some quick ideas for making the process as easy as possible.
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity
The chapters in Part I focus on the underlying causes of obesity but also go
into great detail about the physical and emotional effects of being a severely
overweight kid. We address specific medical conditions related to obesity,
how to handle bullies who torment your child, and how to initiate a healthier
lifestyle in your home.

Part II: The Weight Is Over:
Making Changes, One at a Time
In this part, we get down to the business of overhauling your family’s
lifestyle. We discuss how to encourage everyone to become more active, the
essentials behind proper nutrition, what kind of foods are best for weight
loss, and how to plan a menu and make your life a whole lot easier. We also
talk about the healthiest ways to prepare food (and how to convince your
family that the vegetables on their plate mean them no harm — really).
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and
Keeping the Weight Off
Changing your family’s lifestyle around — and keeping it healthy — isn’t
always the easiest task. Problems such as weight gain, rebellion against the
new system in the house, or simply falling back into old habits may pop up
now and then. And, of course, your child is bound to face certain temptations
at school and at friends’ homes. We talk about all these issues in Part III and
also include a chapter on how to determine whether your child may benefit
from outside help.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
If you’re familiar with For Dummies books, you know that the Part of Tens is
often the quickest read and just the thing to keep you motivated on a busy
day! The chapters in this part include fast, easy ideas for helping you to get
your family on the healthy-living track and keep them there. Flip to this part
whenever you need to remind yourself why you decided to take your family’s
health under control in the first place.
Part V: Appendixes
The Appendix offers 34 easy, low-calorie, low-fat recipes that not only taste
good but are good for you. Your family will love them.

Childhood Obesity

In this part . . .
T
he numbers are in, and childhood obesity has been
declared a public health crisis in the United States.
Not only are obese children at higher risk for developing
serious health issues that were previously only seen in
adults, but they also tend to deal with heartbreaking 
emotional turmoil on a regular basis.
In this part, we talk about what’s causing so many 
children to become severely overweight these days, and
we also discuss the specific health risks these kids face.
Throughout these chapters, we offer tips for creating 
a healthier home environment and for supporting your
child as you start to make the changes that will result 
in better health for the whole family.

I
f you’ve picked up this book and have made it to Chapter 1, we assume
that you’re interested in the topic of managing childhood obesity either on
a personal or professional level. If you have kids or you work with kids (heck,
if you see kids), you know that children these days are heavier than ever.
Your kids’ friends (and your friends’ kids) are bigger, heavier, and less
healthy than children were even 10 or 15 years ago. What’s going on in this
world that’s causing this kind of weight gain?
Well, nothing’s going on throughout the world. Childhood obesity (and obe-
sity in general) affects wealthy, industrialized nations. The adult populations
in third-world countries aren’t worried about the ever-increasing size of their
pants, nor are they concerned that their children are becoming too heavy. (In
fact, these countries often have the exact reverse situation, wherein they’re
concerned about their kids having enough to eat.) In the United States, people
have become accustomed to eating whatever they want, whenever they want,
and eating too much of it. In addition, unlike their forefathers or friends in
underdeveloped areas of the world, most Americans don’t perform any sort of
physical labor as a means of supporting their families. You’d think that would
give everyone even more energy to exercise in the downtime, but apparently,
everyone’s all too interested in what’s happening on TV. Sixty percent of adult
Americans and 15 percent of American children are overweight. Neither chil-
dren nor adults are using their stored energy (conserved from a day of sitting
behind a desk or in front of the TV filling up on too many calories) to make
themselves more fit.
Making oneself healthier usually involves two relatively simple steps:

 Cutting back on high-fat foods
 Increasing daily physical activity levels
You may be surprised to hear that although the consequences of childhood
obesity are varied and complex, the causes and remedies of the condition are
relatively simple. This chapter breaks the topic of childhood obesity down to
address two main questions: Where did this problem come from, and what
can parents do to help correct a child’s weight issue (without making things
worse)?
Gauging the Epidemic of Obese Children
With more and more kids getting bigger and bigger these days, doctors and
other health professionals have to deal with diverse issues. Obesity isn’t 
a condition that limits itself to weight, with the worst effect being low self-
esteem. Childhood obesity can lead to some serious illnesses (like diabetes,
high blood pressure, and heart disease) that can have long-lasting effects. 
So how bad is the problem of childhood obesity? We get to the bottom of 
that question in this section.
The widespread nature of childhood obesity
Thirty years ago, less than 5 percent of children were considered obese.
Today’s figures put the number of obese American children somewhere
between 12 percent and 15 percent! That translates into millions of children,
preteens, and teens suffering from very adult conditions like diabetes and
depression related to weight gain.
Only a physician can make the official diagnosis of obesity. He or she does
this by using height and weight charts along with BMI-for-age charts (see
Chapter 5). These tools give the doctor a clear indication of
 How heavy a child is in relation to the normal weight for his or her age
 The types of interventions the doctor should recommend in order to
improve the child’s health
Although some areas of the country are touted to have larger populations of
heavy adults and kids, childhood obesity isn’t really a regional problem. The
surgeon general has said that it’s an epidemic affecting the entire country; he
doesn’t single out one specific state or city.
8
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity

Changes for the worse at home
A large part of the childhood obesity epidemic is the result of some major
lifestyle changes. Thirty years ago, back when a tiny percentage of children
qualified as obese, there weren’t 800 cable television channels to choose
from. Video games were boring and low-tech, to say the least, and most
people didn’t even know what a computer was. Kids simply didn’t have end-
less indoor entertainment options, so they played outside more often. They
were active without even knowing it. It’s simply what kids did back then!
Today, many kids are glued to some sort of screen much of the time. However,
some kids aren’t allowed to play outside because they come home from
school to an empty house or to a babysitter who isn’t quite up to the task of
keeping the kids safe outdoors. Thirty years ago, in comparison, a large number
of households had at least one parent who stayed home full time, who booted
the kids out the door when they got on her nerves, and who prepared meals
from scratch. We’re not knocking moms who work full time outside the home
nowadays. (Indeed, many homes depend on two full-time salaries just to keep
things moving toward the black and away from the red.) Families are just far
more dependent on fast food and convenience foods these days, both of which
tend to be very high in fat, and both of which are believed to contribute might-
ily to obesity. (Chapter 7 has more detailed information on the drawbacks of
the typical fast-food fare.)
With so many meals eaten on-the-go, families don’t sit down to dinner together.
People have forgotten how to eat for the sake of nutrition; instead, food has
become part of entertainment (as when families eat in front of the TV) or a
contest to see how fast one can finish an entire bagged meal (because she’s
running late and only has five minutes for dinner). People don’t know what
normal portions look like anymore, and they’ve forgotten how to slow down
and evaluate the merits of what they’re eating. (For more on family dinners,
check out Chapter 11.)
Vending junk at school
In addition to the changes in the average home, many children also face the
rigors of making healthy choices at school. In many school cafeterias, finding
healthy options is difficult, especially if the school has allowed fast-food 
vendors to set up shop in the lunchroom. Vending machines have become so
commonplace in schools that kids and parents hardly give them a second
glance anymore; however, because these machines usually aren’t stocked with
apples and oranges but instead with soda and candy bars, even kids who want
a healthy snack often find themselves out of luck.

Chapter 1: Looking for Answers 

What’s to Be Done?
You can’t fight the system, right? Kids are kids, and they’re going to be
exposed to ads for junk food and junk-food vendors their entire life. What’s a
parent to do?
Whether your child has a weight issue or not, you can’t throw your hands up
in the air and leave his health to fate. The human body — adult or child — is
not programmed to subsist on a diet comprised mostly of fat and refined 
carbohydrates. Cavemen didn’t eat French fries. The Pilgrims didn’t visit the
drive-thru window every evening. Native Americans didn’t whip up milkshakes.
And guess what? These populations also weren’t obese.
Parents of obese children are often tempted to make a concerted effort to
improve the child’s weight and health, but most kids will try and fail if at least
one parent isn’t also involved in the regimen.
Easing into activity
Just cutting fat out of your family’s diet is a huge step in the right direction.
Adding physical activity is another important step. Exercise helps the weight
come off faster and also helps keep it off. Plus, exercise has been shown to
improve mental states and alleviate depression and anxiety, so it’s good for
the body and the soul.
We’re not advocating that you start your heavy child off in some sort of
marathon training program. Just get him outside to play. If he’s little, play with
him. If he’s bigger, let him find his own playmates or encourage him to sign up
for a sport. Of course, turning off the TV is an essential part of ensuring that
your child’s activity level increases, so be prepared for an argument — but
also be prepared to stand your ground. For more on incorporating physical
activity into your family’s lifestyle, turn to Chapter 10.
Educating the kids
Your first instinct when faced with an obese child’s health crisis may be to
take the reins and make his meals, drag him outside for walks, and record his
weight every single day. However, the best results in improving a child’s
health come from a parent leading the way but also allowing the child to
make some of his own decisions.
10
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity

Educating your child without dictating his every move makes him feel empow-
ered to make the right choices when push comes to shove (for example, when
he’s at a friend’s house and surrounded by high-fat treats). If he’s been taking
care of himself under your watchful eye, he’ll be able to take care of himself in
the real world, too. Chapter 12 contains ideas for educating your child on
making the best choices when he’s faced with not-so-healthy options.
Facing Trouble Head-On
If losing weight and keeping it off were easy, everyone would be super-thin.
The fact is, making changes to your family’s lifestyle takes time. It takes time
to institute changes and time for the family to get used to them. It also takes
time to start reaping the benefits of healthy living. Because this is a gradual,
permanent change, it’s not unusual for boredom and frustration to set in.
During the adjustment period, you’re your child’s number one cheerleader.
She needs you to remind her of the health benefits of losing weight, so be
prepared to be patient with her.
Kids sometimes gain weight when parents think they should be losing. Your
child may hit a plateau, when weight gain seems to come to a grinding halt
for several weeks. At these times, everyone needs to keep their cool and stick
with the new, healthy routines. Setbacks are normal, and despite the frustration,
moving forward rather than settling into old habits is still the better way to
go. For more on setbacks and remaining supportive, see Chapter 11.
If you suspect that your child would benefit from some sort of professional
intervention, such as talking with a therapist or joining a support group for
overweight kids, don’t hesitate to find her help. Weight is an emotional issue
that can leave permanent scars on a person’s self-esteem. Improving her
physical health is a wonderful goal; just make sure her emotional health is
along for the ride. Chapter 14 contains advice on bringing in outside help for
your child.

Childhood Obesity
In This Chapter
 Looking at the origins of childhood obesity

 Switching your family to an active lifestyle
 Setting a good example for your kids
I
t’s no secret that today’s children are different from the kids that roamed
the planet a generation or two ago. Children today seem to mature faster
in so many ways: They’re smarter than we were at that age, they seem to be
taller, and studies show that some kids even hit puberty at an earlier age.
Although debate continues as to whether these changes are for better or
worse, one trend is particularly disturbing because it encompasses so many
potential long-term emotional and physical problems. You know what we’re
talking about: The trend towards obesity in children.
Statistics show that a significant percentage of children in the United States
are obese, but what does obese really mean? And why is there a sudden spate
of severely overweight children? Is your child part of that group? And most
important, what can you do about it? In this chapter, we take a look at what’s
going on with kids today and talk about how our society has taken a turn
toward inactivity that has resulted in adults and children alike packing on the
pounds. We provide an overview of the dangers associated with being an
obese child, and we also discuss how family life plays a role in the way your
child eats as well as the way she spends her time.
As you read through this chapter, you may think to yourself, “This is too
much! I can’t help my child fix this!” Yes, you can. The first thing you have to
do is take a step back and assess the situation your child is facing. Is she
truly obese? Does she have a plethora of bad habits? Is she modeling what
she sees in the home? A parent who’s able to be honest about his or her
child’s problem is much more likely to be able to help that child correct it.

Is It Baby Fat or Something More?
Fat babies are cute. People want to snuggle them, pinch their cheeks, and tickle
their plump bellies. Fathers beam with pride when someone remarks on the
size of a huge baby boy and respond, “Yep, he’s going to be our linebacker!”
Mothers are only concerned that their big child doesn’t know his own strength
and will unwittingly crush the other children on the playground. In fact, if a
mother expresses concern about a toddler’s plumpness, she’s often made to
feel as though she’s overly concerned with weight and/or appearance. She’s
assured (usually by the child’s grandparents) that nothing’s amiss and the
child will grow into his weight.
Fortunately, many times these assurances are true. As children grow taller and
simultaneously become more active, they tend to thin out. So when should a
parent truly become concerned about a child’s weight? Is a chubby infant a
candidate for a baby aerobics class? What about a toddler or preschooler who
shows no signs of limiting his food intake but who seems to be genuinely
hungry? In this section, we discuss the criteria for differentiating between
normal childhood chubbiness and childhood obesity. We also talk about the
emotional pitfalls that obese children face and the reasons that make trying 
to correct bad habits as soon as possible so important.
Making the call: Is she obese or 
merely plump?
First things first: Infants and babies are never, ever diagnosed as being obese.
Determining whether toddlers are truly overweight is difficult because they
still have their protruding bellies. For older children, however, research has
made clear that parents are often the last people to acknowledge their child’s
weight problem. A healthcare professional, on the other hand, is completely
objective.
If your child’s doctor is telling you that your child is obese, listen. He’s not trying
to be judgmental or mean spirited. He has seen the effects obesity has on the
body, and he really has your child’s best interest at heart — just as you do.
Diagnosing obesity
The one person who can make the diagnosis of true obesity is your child’s
doctor, who evaluates adiposity, a medical term for “how much fat a person
14
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

has.” There are several ways to assess adiposity, including the use of an MRI
or an underwater scale, but these methods are expensive (and, some would
argue, excessive).
Some physicians use calipers to measure subcutaneous fat at specific points
on the body. Caliper readings are a really accurate way to diagnose the
amount of fat a person has, but they’re notoriously difficult to reproduce.
The doctor may come in, do a measurement, and hand the calipers over to
the nurse practitioner to confirm the reading . . . only to get a different mea-
surement. So in terms of reliability and ease of use, calipers are great in the
hands of a true expert but not so helpful when used by someone less skilled.
Measuring and comparing the distribution of body fat is another way doctors
sometimes evaluate children for obesity, but again, this is a less-than-perfect
science. Debate exists in the medical community as to which circumferences
and ratios are most important in terms of obesity. For example, although it’s
widely accepted among doctors that belly fat is particularly dangerous in
adults, this doesn’t appear to be the case for children. (In short, more
research in the area of children’s body fat distribution needs to be done.)
Doctors most commonly use a chart called the body mass index (BMI) to
make the differentiation between an overweight child and one who is obese.
This chart, used for children and adults alike, measures the amount of fat a
person carries around on his or her body frame.
You know that when you take your child to the pediatrician for a checkup,
someone measures her height and weight and records the numbers on a
chart, and the doctor turns to you and says, for example, “Susie is in the 90th
percentile for height.” Obese children tend to fall into the highest percentiles
for weight, which can be deceiving because BMI uses height as one of the fac-
tors in calculation. So although your child may fall into a high weight per-
centile, she may not be obese if she also falls into a high percentile for height.
We cover BMI (along with other criteria used for diagnosing obesity in chil-
dren) in great detail in Chapter 5, but for now, here’s what you should know
about the BMI chart:
 For adults, a BMI score of 30 or above indicates obesity.
 Children’s BMI scores are evaluated according to their age.
 A child is considered obese if she scores in the 95th percentile for her
age on the BMI scale.
The English formula for calculating BMI is:
[Weight (lb) ÷ Height (in) ÷ Height (in)] × 703
15
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

Whereas an adult has to hit the 30 mark on the BMI scale to be considered
obese, an obese child’s score is much lower. For example, a 6-year-old girl
with a BMI score of 19.65 is considered obese because that score falls into
the 95th percentile of BMI for her age. A child who falls into the 85th per-
centile (in this case, the 6-year old girl’s BMI score would be 17.20) is consid-
ered overweight or at risk for becoming obese.
But why label kids as obese when they hit this point? When a child reaches
the point of being severely overweight, it’s time to do something about it, and
a solid tool like the BMI scale allows both doctors and parents to say, “Look,
this child is past the point of simply being a little too heavy. She’s moving
into critical territory with her weight, and we need to correct this condition
before she develops dangerous health problems.”
A doctor’s level of concern may be directly associated with the child’s age.
An obese 6-year-old still has years of growing ahead of her and plenty of time
to undo any damage that’s starting to take hold inside of her body. An obese
16-year-old, on the other hand, is reaching the apex of her height potential
and is at higher risk for carrying bad habits into adulthood. Depending on
how long she’s been obese, she may also be at high risk for developing health
problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, and sleep apnea,
all of which carry long-term risks of serious illness. (For more on these and
other health problems, see Chapter 3.)
Super-Sized Babies: Born Big 
and Staying that Way
Some people question whether the increase of obese children is due to
increased birth weight. The answer: Yes and no. Yes, birth weight can cer-
tainly affect a child as he grows, but no, an obese child doesn’t always start
life out in the 100th percentile for weight.
For the most part, physicians believe that most babies who are 12 pounds
and over at birth are born to women with untreated gestational diabetes.
Because the mother has too much glucose in her body during pregnancy, the
baby receives too much glucose in the womb and grows well beyond every-
one’s expectations. Babies who measure in at or above the 90th percentile at
birth (that is, they’re larger than 90 percent of other babies who were in the
womb for the same period of time, normally 38 to 40 weeks) are termed large-
for-gestational age. Children who are this large at birth tend to stay large
throughout childhood and adulthood.
16
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

Here’s another twist to babies who aren’t necessarily born big but who end
up being too chubby within the first year: Doctors are struggling to treat a
significant percentage of obese pregnant women. An obese mother may have
other health issues, like diabetes or high blood pressure, that lead to premature
births and/or low birth weight babies. (Yep, you read that correctly.) The fact
that many of these children will, in time, become obese has far more to do
with the environment they’re raised in than their birthing experience.
Generally speaking, though, obese women tend to give birth to larger-than-
average babies. These babies tend to remain large throughout childhood and
adolescence and into adulthood. The factors involved may be genetic or envi-
ronmental, but the end result is the same: These children are at higher risk
for developing the long-term obesity-related complications and illnesses that
we talk about in the following section and in Chapter 3.
Statistics from the Center for Disease Control show that 30 percent of adult
Americans are obese, and more than 60 percent of adult Americans are at
least overweight! It stands to reason, then, that many children are born to
obese parents and the cycle of unhealthy lifestyle choices continues.
Studies have shown that babies who gain too much weight in the first week of
life may actually reset their biological systems, making it easier for them to
gain weight throughout their lifetimes. You certainly don’t want to withhold
food from a baby, so your pediatrician is your best resource for determining
how much to feed your baby at any given point in time. Our point is that the
trend toward obesity can start as early as the first few days of life; indeed,
this research has indicated that excessive weight gain in the first week is far
more likely to cause obesity later in life than excessive weight gain over the
first several months of a child’s life.
Physical and Emotional 
Dangers of Obesity
The reason that the trend toward obesity is so alarming to physicians is that
excess weight can cause very damaging conditions — both physically and
emotionally. And while the emphasis is on correcting and/or mitigating any
permanent changes to a child’s physical health, anyone who’s ever been
teased about their physical appearance can attest to the fact that the emo-
tional scars can be just as painful as any physical hurt.
17
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

Aches, pains, and disease
Pediatricians see many serious health issues in obese children that used to
be seen only in adults. Obese children have a higher risk of developing the
following conditions:
 Type 2 diabetes
 High blood pressure
 Asthma
 Sleep apnea
 Rashes, fungal infections, and other skin conditions
 Early puberty in girls
 Delayed puberty in boys
 Orthopedic strains and fractures
 Heart disease (in early adulthood)
Chapter 3 goes into more detail about each of these conditions.
No one should have to worry about these conditions until adulthood, but they
can start to develop as early as childhood. In fact, doctors are seeing more
and more instances of type 2 diabetes and elevated cholesterol in children as
more and more children become obese.
As for the worst of the worst, some of the most serious long-term side effects
of type 2 diabetes include:
 Increased risk for heart disease and stroke
 Blindness
 Amputations
Some of the long-term complications of elevated cholesterol are an increased
risk of heart disease and stroke. Combine a couple of these conditions, and a
person can end up with very serious health issues. An adolescent who has
both diabetes and high cholesterol, for example, has a much higher risk of
developing heart disease than a teen who has one or the other. Unfortunately,
because obesity predisposes people to developing these diseases, it’s more
common for an obese person to have more than one obesity-related disease.

Aching for acceptance: Emotional issues
As though the physical risks of obesity aren’t enough, their peers put obese
children through the emotional wringer each and every day. Overweight kids
are easy targets for bullies, and unfortunately, even though we’ve done away
with all kinds of overt discrimination in this country, a fat prejudice still
exists and still is accepted among certain factions of the population.
Consider this: Obese adults face discrimination and outright nastiness from
total strangers. (If you’re severely overweight or obese, you can probably
recall a time or two when someone had the nerve to judge you on nothing
more than your physical appearance.) What are these strangers teaching
their children, who are in school with your child? It’s a hard, cruel world out
there, but it’s even worse for an obese child faced with taunts and name-
calling on a daily basis. In Chapter 4, we talk more about the social issues 
and emotional wounds that overweight children face.
Self-esteem and isolation
Obese children are more likely than other kids to feel like they’re on the out-
side of their peer social settings and, as a result, suffer from low self-esteem.
Few children can tolerate being different from the other kids in their classes.
Obese children look different, move differently, and have physical needs that
other children don’t (such as needing a larger desk, for example, or more
time to complete a task in physical education class). Most kids want nothing
more than to be accepted by other kids their own age. A child may feel like
he stands out either because he’s being made to feel that way by others or
because he perceives himself as an alien being. Either way, the result is the
same: The child doesn’t succeed in social settings.
Problems during puberty
Obese girls tend to reach puberty earlier than other girls their age, which
only adds to the problem of feeling like an outcast. When a 9-year-old faces
weight issues and a burgeoning bosom and getting her period, she’s dealing
with some very adult issues at a very young age. Her friends are bound to
look at her differently, as are adults. No one knows quite how to speak to a
child who looks like a young woman.
Obese boys tend to go through puberty at a later age than boys who are of
normal weight. While the other guys are starting to sprout upward and show
signs of entering adulthood, obese boys are left wondering why their bodies
are betraying them. Why aren’t their voices getting deeper? Why aren’t they
shaving yet? A boy in this situation may wonder, “Isn’t it bad enough being
overweight without also being stuck in childhood?”
19
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

The teen scene
Obese children with low self-esteem tend to be stuck on the sidelines (at
best) while their peers start going to dances and on group dates. It’s not as
though obese children don’t take an interest in the opposite sex; they simply
have fewer opportunities to test the waters, so to speak, and this setback fur-
ther affects the way they view themselves as well as the way they’re viewed
by their peers.
Avoiding the Fat Lifestyle
Some obese adults and children truly believe that their weight problems stem
from some sort of glandular problem, but this theory is true in a very small
percentage of cases. Most of the time, obesity is caused by a synergy of two
separate but equally powerful bad habits:
 Ingesting too much food (especially high-fat food)
 Leading a sedentary lifestyle
Being overweight and/or obese is usually what doctors call a voluntary 
condition — that is, the only reason for it is that a particular person has 
fallen into certain habits that have contributed to skyrocketing weight. But
the fact that it’s voluntary means that you can do something about it. Obesity
isn’t an incurable condition — it responds well to lifestyle modifications.
Kick the kids out!
Does your child ever play outside? Lack of physical movement contributes
mightily to obesity.
Food is nothing more than edible energy. Calories are the measurement of the
potential energy that a given amount and type of food contains. A body needs
a minimum amount of calories in order to perform its basic functions, and
the recommended caloric intake for this purpose varies according to age,
body frame, and activity level. For example, a 22-year-old average-sized foot-
ball player in training needs to ingest more calories than a skinny 35-year-old
computer programmer who does little more than type all day long. The foot-
ball player is younger, larger, and more active than the programmer, so he
burns more calories and burns them faster.
Children’s bodies need caloric energy in order to grow properly, but doctors
often recommend restructuring the types of food an obese child gets her
calories from. By eating healthy foods with fewer calories, your child will
20
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

actually consume more food than if she were eating unhealthy foods with
more calories, but the healthy foods will make her feel fuller sooner.
Because very few people take in only the bare minimum amount of calories
that they need to operate each day, everyone needs to get their bodies
moving in order to burn off the extra energy that’s contained in food. In addi-
tion, children need to engage in physical activity to encourage the proper for-
mation of bones and muscles. When a child never goes outside to play, a few
things happen as a result:
 He gains weight. (No physical activity usually results in extra pounds.)
 He doesn’t learn to interact with other kids.
 He doesn’t discover how to use his imagination.
Obviously, the weight gain is the issue we focus most on in this book, but the
other effects may also contribute to a child never wanting to go outside. If he
sees other children playing a game he’s never participated in, he may feel like
the odd man out, even if he wants to join them. This feeling, in turn, makes
him withdraw from the other kids even more and miss out on other activities.
How does he console himself? With a snack and some time in front of the TV.
It’s a vicious cycle.
Do whatever you can to get your children outside every day, starting when
they’re babies. Make it a natural part of the day by calling it Outside Time,
Playtime, Yard Time, or whatever sounds good to you. When they’re very
small, you can play games like tag or kickball or have simple “races” (where
you let them win every time, of course). When they’re older, you can encour-
age loosely organized sports in the yard, bike rides, or walks.
Even if you live in an area where winter hangs on for half the year, find some
way to get those kids outside and moving. Take up skiing, go sledding (drag-
ging that sled back up the hill takes energy!), or try ice-skating, hockey, or
snowshoeing. Make activity a normal part of your kids’ day, year-round, and
you’ll all lose weight.
If you live someplace where letting your children play outdoors is difficult or
unsafe, find a nearby community center or a family program that offers chil-
dren’s activities. Many programs are available to youths at little or no cost.
Turn off the TV!
Given a free minute, most kids are glued to the television set. And they’ll
watch anything, which proves that their minds are turning to mush. (Kids
used to be able to tell a good cartoon from a bad one. Not so these days. Put
it on the air, make it talk, and most kids will watch it.)
21
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

Why TV is bad (as if you don’t already know)
The telltale sign of a sedentary lifestyle is sitting around doing not much of
anything; this type of nonactivity leads to weight gain because the person’s
not engaging in any physical activity that uses up the calories ingested over
the course of the day. Studies have shown that watching a lot of TV
 Can actually lower metabolism, the body’s way of effectively using calo-
ries for energy
 Encourages kids to snack without thinking about what they’re eating
For some reason, kids are particularly drawn to snacking on high-fat, high-
carbohydrate foods, like chips or cookies, while watching TV. Why this is the
case is anyone’s guess, but it’s a good bet that those commercials hawking
junk food have something to do with it.
TV viewing is like a perfect storm for weight gain. The very act of sitting down
to stare at a screen causes metabolism to take a nose-dive while kids continue
to take in more calories of the very worst kind. (Now, if your kids wanted to sit
down and snack on a bowl of raw carrots, you’d still have the excessive TV
viewing to contend with, but obesity wouldn’t be as much of an issue.)
Why do people sit down in front of the TV with a snack, anyway? One reason
is boredom. Watching TV day in and day out is really boring. (Many kids are
so hooked on TV that they’re completely immune to its entertainment value.)
As a result of this boredom, some kids look for something else — anything
else — to do while watching TV, and eating is the easiest activity when your
mind is completely numb.
Also, if you haven’t personally been exposed to children’s television shows,
sit down and watch with your kids some time. A lot of the commercials that
air during children’s programming are for food — and not healthy food.
Chips, soda, cookies, yogurt loaded with sugar and cookie stir-ins, ice cream,
various fast food restaurants. . . . Occasionally, you see an ad for milk, but
you rarely see anyone pushing fruits and vegetables. Even the occasional
public service announcements that try to educate young children on the
virtues of eating a healthy diet are lost in the overwhelming deluge of ads
promoting junk.
Simple solutions
No matter how long your children have been accustomed to snacking in front
of the TV, make a new rule, effective immediately: No more eating while
watching television. Taking away the background noise of cartoons and mind-
less shows forces the kids to consider what they’re putting into their mouths
and whether they’re actually hungry.
22
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

Because TV is even geared toward babies these days, kids can easily fall into
an all-TV, all-the-time routine. Add the old adage “Everything in moderation”
into your daily parenting routine; a little TV watching isn’t going to hurt your
children, but spending hours upon hours in front of the tube may cause them
to gain weight and, in any event, certainly won’t do them any good, especially
when they could be spending that time playing with friends.
Some households have the television on almost nonstop, so kicking a con-
stant TV-watching habit can be as difficult as quitting smoking. Everyone has
their shows that they watch every day or every week, but TV can become a
physical dependence, a comfort, a member of the family. Do yourself and
your kids a big favor by taking the following actions:
 Limit the amount of television that your children are allowed to
watch. Pediatricians recommend that children under 2 years of age
don’t watch TV at all. After the age of 2, the recommendation is no more
than two hours per day.
 Enforce a no-snacking-while-watching rule. Turn off the tube and con-
centrate on the food in front of you and the people around you. In
Chapter 11, we talk about setting firm ground rules for mealtimes.
 Make sure that you follow the new rules, too. Studies have shown that
kids are more likely to be hooked on TV if their parents are avid viewers.
You can’t really expect a child to accept a limit on her TV time if you
continue to watch the tube ’round the clock.
 Encourage your children to replace TV time with even a moderately
active pastime. You’re likely to see big changes, both in their weight and in
their attitudes, as they gain self-confidence and a renewed interest in life.
23
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity
Do electronics truly cause weight gain?
You may be reading this chapter and thinking,
“Well, I have one skinny kid and one overweight
kid, and they both watch a lot of TV, so some-
thing besides the use of electronics must cause
obesity in children.” Certainly, not every child
who spends too much time in front of the TV or
computer is obese — but plenty are, or at least
are headed in that direction.
The plain truth is that inactivity and excessive
eating cause people to become overweight.
Most cases of obesity aren’t the result of 
glandular problems or inactive thyroids, and
although obesity may have a genetic link (obese
parents are more likely than thin parents to
have children who are obese), environment
plays a big role. Poor eating habits and inactive
lifestyles are usually passed along from gener-
ation to generation. So can you blame TV for
your children’s weight problems? Not really, 
no. You have to look to yourself and your habits
first . . . and then turn off those electronics.

Game over: Shut down the video games
You may have read the preceding section thinking, “My child never watches
TV. He’s off learning things on his computer.” Although some computer and
video games have educational components and are deemed “interactive,”
most are a far cry any sort of fat-burning activity. The problems linked with
excessive TV viewing are echoed with video and computer games: They’re
sedentary activities. While playing these games, kids are apt to snack without
thinking, and they’re not outdoors interacting with other kids or getting rid of
some energy.
Some doctors feel that video games are a little less harmful than excessive TV
viewing as far as developing obesity is concerned. The theory is that com-
puter and video games engage kids in activity that involves a lot of hand-eye
coordination and other fine motor movements, and these kinds of motions
utilize more caloric energy than simply sitting and staring at a TV screen.
This theory may have some truth to it, but it’s far from a solid endorsement
of video games and computers.
In order to burn off a meaningful amount of fat and calories, a person has to
be engaged in some sort of aerobic activity — something that raises the heart
rate, uses the large muscles in the body, and gets the blood pumping. Video
games just don’t offer this health benefit.
Cut out the fast food
Suppose researchers were working in reverse and wanted parents to encour-
age their children to become obese. What would one of their very first recom-
mendations be? Swing through the fast food drive-thru on a regular basis.
Yep, that should do the trick.
To be fair, over the past few years, the fast food giants have made a real point of
advertising healthier choices for adults. For the most part, they’ve done a fair
job of providing nonfried foods, such as salads or grilled chicken sandwiches,
for us older people. However, in most restaurants, kids’ meals haven’t changed.
Fried Anything and Everything is still pretty much the meal du jour, along with
the standard greasy burger. Throw in a shake or a soda to wash down the fatty
food, and you’ve got instant weight gain — in a fun box with a toy!
Parents often don’t think that feeding children fatty foods is going to do them
any harm. Just because they’re kids doesn’t mean that their bodies can
handle it any better than adults’ bodies. Not only do children get fat on these
meals, but evidence indicates that they can develop what cardiologists refer
to as fatty streaks in the arteries. Fatty streaks are indicators of high choles-
terol taking root and starting to do its damage — in children!
24
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

The fast food giants are some of the biggest advertisers during children’s
television shows. These guys poke their heads right into your family room
and tell your kids how great their food is. Your kids, in turn, beg you to take
them, and you fall prey to these ads, too. Put your foot down and say, “No
more fast food for my family!”
What’s wrong with fast food
You know how the whole fast food habit gets started with kids: They want the
toy in the kids’ meal, and they eat the meal because it’s there. Before you
know it, they’re bugging you for a kids’ meal two or three times a week, and
because it’s so easy — and because you’ve finally found a meal that even
your pickiest child will scarf down — you’re only too happy to oblige.
Fast food is such bad news that it’s hard to know where to begin. Here are the
biggies:
25
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity
DDR is a-ok
Interestingly, one video game gets the thumbs
up from doctors and researchers in the field of
childhood obesity. It’s called Dance Dance
Revolution (DDR) and is so effective in getting
kids off the couch and moving to the beat that
at least one health insurance company is con-
sidering paying for the game for children who
are diagnosed as being obese.
The game works like so:
1. A dance pad with arrows pointing to the
front, back, and sides is laid on the floor and
hooked up to a video game system.
2. The DDR disc is loaded into the game
system.
3. Kids dance to the songs as animations on
the TV screen light up the arrows to indi-
cate which direction their feet should move
on the dance pad.
4. The game keeps track of correct steps and
missteps, and the dancer collects points
accordingly.
This game gets kids dancing like wild people —
they end up sweating bullets, trying to perfect
the dance combinations. (A separate compo-
nent can even be hooked up to include hand
movements.)
The beauty of this game is that it’s a good fit for
almost any kid. Your son doesn’t need to be an
all-star athlete to get his groove on in the family
room. The competitive nature of DDR also drives
kids to want to continue playing — against
friends or against the machine — and that
keeps them moving. So far, the official prelimi-
nary studies done by the insurance agency look
promising, and this game may well end up being
a prescription for overweight kids.

 Fast food is loaded with fat, cholesterol, triglycerides, and all sorts of
things you don’t want floating around and taking up residence in your
child’s body. Not only do these compounds cause obesity, but they’ve
also been linked with the development of heart disease and diabetes.
The fats that are most prevalent in fast food are saturated fats and 
trans fats — the kinds that are most likely to cause damage to the arteries
(as opposed to unsaturated and monounsaturated fats).
 You child can become hooked on fast food because it appeals to 
biological cravings for salt, sugar, and fat.
 The soda that usually accompanies a child’s meal contains no nutrients,
only calories from sugar that are easily converted into fat.
 Children who eat fast food on a regular basis (at least three times a
week) are less likely to choose healthier foods like fruits, vegetables,
milk, and whole grains when given the opportunity.
 Fast food feeds into the “super-size” mentality of larger-than-normal
portion sizes, which can carry over into the home.
Finding alternative restaurant food
In many cases, take-out restaurants are no better than drive-thrus where nutri-
tion’s concerned. Your local pizzeria may offer a salad or two, but a pizza
crust that’s made with lard and topped with extra pepperoni, extra cheese,
and bacon is every bit as unhealthy as that double-bacon cheeseburger your
teenagers love so much. And dishes like chicken parmesan and fish and chips
are loaded with grease and fat. Just because something takes a little longer to
cook than fries and a burger doesn’t make it healthier.
Fortunately, many larger sit-down restaurants have turned the corner and
offer kids healthier choices. Red Lobster is a great example of this trend. Their
children’s menu actually offers grilled fish served with raw veggies (and dip),
a salad, or applesauce! That’s quite an improvement over the standard
chicken fingers and fries that are on almost every kid’s menu everywhere.
In a sit-down restaurant, you can modify the standard child’s meal and make
it less fattening, but you have to know what to avoid in the first place. When
you peruse a children’s menu, eliminate the following right off the bat:
 Fried mozzarella cheese sticks: Although cheese is loaded with calcium,
an essential nutrient for growing bones, most of the nutritional value of
any food is lost the moment it enters the deep fryer. (Plus, that cheese in
the middle is not of the low-fat variety.)
 Chicken fingers, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, and popcorn chicken:
Although chicken is hailed as a low-fat meat, breast meat isn’t usually
used to produce processed chicken foods (like nuggets or patties). And
26
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

even if it were white meat, after it’s breaded and cooked in oil, it’s just
fried meat, which is high in fat no matter where it comes from.
 Burgers with extra cheese, bacon, and mayo: The burgers served in
restaurants may be slightly lower in fat than drive-thru burgers, which
makes them a marginally better choice than anything fried.
If a burger is your only option, encourage your children to leave off extra
fattening toppings. If they have to have something on that burger, lettuce,
tomato, pickles, ketchup, and mustard are some good low-fat choices.
Also, adding veggies may satisfy an older child by adding more zing to
the texture of a burger or sandwich.
 Specialty drinks: Your child opens the menu to find a milkshake layered
with cookie pieces served in the world’s tallest mug and topped off with
whipped cream. Say no to his request for dessert-before-the-meal and
encourage him to drink water or low-fat milk instead.
 Fries: Because childhood obesity has become such a far-reaching issue,
many restaurants will honor your request to substitute a small salad or
some type of fruit or vegetable in place of French fries that come with a
kid’s meal, even if these options aren’t listed on the menu. Ask and you
just may receive.
 Dessert: In many chain restaurants, servers are trained to push decadent
cakes, sundaes, and pies on their customers. Desserts are usually big-
profit items (along with appetizers), and because purchasing a round of
ice cream boosts your bill, it also increases your server’s tip. Just say no
to dessert in restaurants and have some fresh fruit waiting at home.
Changing the dining-out habits of a child who has already firmly established
what she will and won’t eat can be hard. Young children tend to be much
more malleable — that is, you can change their palates (their desire for cer-
tain foods) much more easily than older kids’ because you’re the boss, for
one thing. If you say no to fried chicken, then the answer is no (and should
remain no, no matter how much begging, whining, or crying goes on).
An older child may be interested in ordering from the adult menu, which gen-
erally offers more low-fat options or meals that are easily modified into lower-
fat versions of what’s listed on the menu. If your child is ordering from the
regular section of the menu, check out which side dishes are included with a
sandwich or meal. Grilled chicken with a side of fries is two steps forward
and one step back.
If an adult meal is just too much for your child to handle, consider splitting a
low-fat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The portions served up in many restau-
rants are too large for many adults, so splitting a meal may work out perfectly
for you and your child. Also, sharing is a great way for you to show her that
you’re also eating more healthfully.
27
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

For more advice on how to maintain healthy eating habits in restaurants and
other places outside the home, flip to Chapter 12.
Eat healthy at home when time is limited
Every mother and father in the world — whether they work or stay at home
with the kids — has, at one time or another, realized that there just isn’t
enough time in the day to do everything that needs to be done — including
cooking.
Falling back on convenience foods
Today, countless precooked and frozen meal options make life easier. Deli
counters and grocery store freezer cases full of frozen foods offer up fast and
easy meal options that require no more work than turning the oven up to 400
degrees or punching a few buttons on the microwave.
These meals are often referred to as convenience foods because they’re so
easy to prepare. In fact, little or no preparation is required! You don’t have to
cut, measure, or season anything. If you can work the temperature gauge on
the oven and operate the microwave, you’re good to go.
Convenience foods are usually — but not always — frozen and may include:
 Casseroles
 Pizza
 Burritos or enchiladas
 Egg rolls
 Mini burgers
 TV dinners
Convenience foods tend to be high in saturated and trans fats, which translate
into increased body fat and high cholesterol levels. Saturated and trans fats
occur naturally in certain foods; however, most of the trans fats we end up
eating are man-made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil, which basically
converts a liquid fat into a solid fat. For this reason, trans fats are also called
hydrogenated fats. They’re added to foods for two main reasons:
 To increase shelf life
 To make the taste more appealing to consumers
28
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

But so what? What’s the deal with trans fats? Who cares if they help foods
last longer and make them taste better? That’s what we want! Well, along with
“better” taste, you and your family get a healthy dose of a substance that
contributes to elevated cholesterol levels and, subsequently, heart disease.
These conditions can take root in childhood, especially in severely over-
weight and obese children.
Fat comes in different packages. Unsaturated, monounsaturated, and polyun-
saturated fats tend not to be converted into body fat as easily as saturated
and trans fats are. In addition, saturated and trans fats cause cholesterol
levels to rise (even in kids). Trans fats are usually listed on food labels as par-
tially hydrogenated oils.
High-fat convenience foods also tend to be high in sodium, which acts as a
preservative and a taste enhancer. However, excessive sodium raises blood
pressure and contributes to heart disease.
Finding convenient — and healthy — options
We’re not saying that prepared meals aren’t a godsend once in awhile. If you’re
working full time, two of your kids are involved in eight different activities
during the week, and you’re not even sure which kid you’re supposed to pick
up or where he or she might be at the moment, the least of your concerns is
putting a balanced meal on the table. You’re fairly sure that your children
wouldn’t eat it anyway! They prefer frozen lasagna over your home cooking,
and the act of tossing a block of frozen noodles and cheese into the oven will
just meet your tolerance for meal preparation this evening. We understand —
honest. But healthy cooking doesn’t have to be difficult or take hours on end.
Plenty of foods in the frozen-food aisle also qualify as healthy convenience
foods. Frozen vegetables, for example, usually don’t have any fat or salt
added to them; frozen fruit is another healthy option, as are low-fat frozen
meals (although these are often on the small side and may need to be cou-
pled with salad or a separate side of vegetables). So we’re not advising that
you skip the frozen aisle altogether; rather, we advise that you take a closer
look at what you select there.
If you just don’t have time to cook dinner every night, consider cooking two
or three big meals over the weekend and freezing leftovers for the week. Or
browse cookbooks and surf the Internet for easy, low-fat recipes. Vegetable
stir-fry, for example, can be very low in fat if you don’t use a lot of oil from
the get-go. It involves chopping and steaming veggies, but it’s still a lot less
involved than, say, preparing a huge turkey in the oven. Chapter 9 has more
tips for preparing healthy meals in your kitchen.

Eat As I Say, Not As I Eat: How Parents
Pass Along Bad Habits
To help your child lose weight, you can turn off the TV, make her go outside
to play, encourage her to make healthier choices in restaurants, and start
cooking low-fat meals for her at home. But if you don’t change your own bad
habits, your child is less likely to succeed in changing hers.
Studies have shown time and time again that an obese child needs intensive
parental involvement in order to lose weight and keep it off in the long run. A
big part of this requirement is due to the fact that parents control the purse
strings and the family car and therefore also have a lot of control over the
food that comes into the house.
If you push fresh green beans on your kids at dinnertime while you prepare a
batch of frozen pizza bagels for yourself, they’re going to have a hard time
accepting your spiel about living a healthier lifestyle. And it doesn’t matter if
you’re thin and your kids aren’t. They need to see that you’re committed to
health, first and foremost.
Conquering obesity isn’t about improving your child’s appearance, although
that may be a side effect of weight loss. Adapting to a healthier lifestyle is all
about improving health, and that’s something that every person, regardless
of size or weight, should aim for.
Most obese children don’t have glandular problems that cause weight gain,
nor do they have thin parents; one or both parents usually have weight prob-
lems (and just to be absolutely clear, the parents don’t have glandular prob-
lems, either). Even the parents’ parents may have weight problems. One
reason doctors have such difficulty nailing down the nature-or-nurture aspect
of obesity is because it’s probably a little bit of both. Some families may be
predisposed to weight gain, but they also make poor lifestyle choices that
lead to obesity and pass their attitudes about food and exercise on to the
next generation.
Obese children tend to come from families in which:
 At least one parent is significantly overweight or obese.
 Food is everything. It’s love, it’s comfort, it’s entertainment, and it’s the
topic of almost every conversation. As a result, life revolves around the
next meal.
30
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

 Television is a constant presence. There may be a TV in the kitchen, the
family room, and each bedroom, so no one misses out on more than five
minutes of TV while they’re at home.
 Activity is regarded as a burden. The thought of leaving the house to
do something outdoors or at a community center seems overwhelming
or like a waste of time.
Does this sound like your family? An obese child doesn’t commonly appear in
a family in which people are active, healthy meals are the norm, and every-
one is of normal weight. Bad habits in the family contribute significantly to
the development of obesity in children. Even if you’ve acknowledged your
own weight issues and made a good effort to prevent your child from becom-
ing overweight, children tend to copy their parents’ behaviors. And if you
don’t have a handle on your own eating habits, you can’t really judge how
well your child is doing with hers.
If you have weight issues, educating yourself on the issue of obesity in gen-
eral is the key to helping your child. This book will certainly help, but you
may also want to:
 Read books that address adult weight problems.
 Join a weight-loss group, where you find out more about nutrition.
 Speak to your doctor about the best options for your own weight-loss
program.
Schools Paying the Price for Obesity
Overweight children who are victimized by bullies are more apt to fake illness
in order to skip school. Not only does this behavior affect the child, but it also
affects the school. Consider this:
 Some states base their funding for schools on an acceptable level of
attendance.
 Other states base funding on each school’s performance on standardized
tests.
 When a school has a high absentee rate, its funding is likely to drop.
“Well, so what?” you may say. “If the school isn’t providing my child with the
services he needs, why should I care if it gets its money?” You should care
because the less money a school receives from the state, the less chance
31
Chapter 2: The Growing Problem of Childhood Obesity

there is that anything will change and work to the advantage of overweight
children. A school that’s short on funding may not have a gym teacher, for
example, or an outdoor play area that’s suitable for kids. A school that’s in
dire financial straits is also more likely than other schools to fall prey to fast-
food vendors who are more than eager to set up shop in any school cafeteria.
Schools that enter into contracts with fast food vendors make (and save) a
great deal of money from the partnership. The fast food vendors, meanwhile,
are more than happy to hook loyal customers for life. The best interests of
the students and their health are lost in the shuffle.
Take a good look at your child’s school to figure out whether it’s a relatively
healthy environment or one that’s detrimental to its students’ overall health.
Here are some questions to ask as you examine the school and its practices:
 Does the school have a physical education program? How many times a
week do students participate? What kinds of activities do they do? If
your child is in elementary school, is there time (and space) for daily
recess?
 Does the cafeteria have a fast-food banner hanging over the serving
area? Are any healthy options offered, like salads, low-fat meats (a
chicken breast sandwich, for example), and whole-grain breads?
 Are the walls of the cafeteria lined with vending machines stocked with
soda and candy bars?
 What’s the school’s line on discrimination of any kind, including “fat 
discrimination”?
If you’re not exactly the activist type, you may be wondering what good this
type of investigation can do. Because your child spends most of her time at
school, you need to know whether the school is helping or hurting your
efforts to institute a healthy lifestyle with your family. You can talk about
health at home until you’re blue in the face, but if your child’s unable to walk
into that cafeteria and purchase a healthy lunch . . . you need to know that. If
the school feels that bullying is something that kids should work out between
themselves . . . you need to know that. If recess is nothing more than a time for
youngsters to sit and play hand-held video games . . . you need to know that.
You’re trying so hard to un-teach your child about unhealthy habits. If she’s
hearing one thing at home and living the complete opposite experience at
school, she may end up being confused at best; at worst, she may end up
doing as the Romans do, so to speak, when she’s at school, which will signifi-
cantly impede her progress at home.

Mixed messages between home and school can affect your child’s physical and
emotional well-being. If she’s in a mostly healthy environment at school, she’ll
probably fare much better in her quest to adapt to a healthy lifestyle. If she’s
facing obstacles every which way she turns (like if she really wants to go out-
side after lunch but instead is only given free time to read in the classroom, or
if she has her mind set on choosing a healthy lunch but can’t find one in the
cafeteria), however, maintaining a healthy lifestyle will be harder — which is
not to say it will be impossible. She may have to start packing her own lunch,
for example, and you may have to make sure that she gets outside after school
for more time than if she were also playing on the playground at school each
day. The point is, the school environment affects her life substantially, and you
need to see it firsthand in order to counteract any negative messages she
brings home.

Facing the Physical Effects 
of Childhood Obesity: The 
Damage You Don’t See
In This Chapter
 Increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes
 Straining the heart and joints
 Taking in breathing problems
 Scratching the surface of rashes and other skin issues
 Dealing with digestive issues
 Stopping trouble in its tracks
A
s the parent of an obese child, you face a plethora of worries: Not only
does your child deal with all sorts of emotional and social issues (like
low self-esteem that stems from teasing), but he’s also at high risk for devel-
oping serious, life-long physical ailments. The threat of these conditions is
enough to keep you awake at night, worried for your obese child’s life. The
good news, however, is that many of these conditions are reversible or can 
at least be diminished if caught early enough.
Some parents are fooled by youth; they think that kids are resilient and that
it’s just not possible for something as commonplace as extra weight to do
serious and sometimes permanent damage to a child’s body. That kind of
thinking is very dangerous, though, because it keeps parents from dealing
with the gravity of their child’s physical condition. So the first step in dealing
with the serious physical effects of childhood obesity is acknowledging that
they do occur with great frequency among obese children and that the
sooner you can stop the problem, the more likely you are to mitigate the
damage or reverse it altogether.

36
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 
This chapter delves into the most common medical complications that arise
from childhood obesity. Keep in mind that this chapter isn’t intended to help
you diagnose or cure ailments; only your child’s doctor can do that. Rather,
it’s an overview of what can and does happen in the obese body on a regular
basis. We shy away from using medical jargon as much as possible in the
interest of keeping the information as easy to understand as possible.
Perhaps the most frustrating part of these conditions is that they begin
silently. Your child may not even realize when these ailments start to occur,
so it’s a safe bet that you won’t, either. This chapter doesn’t give you a partic-
ularly sunny view of what lies down the road for a child who remains obese.
Is this information some kind of scare tactic? A bucket-of-ice-water-in-the-face
wake-up call? Something to make you worry even more about your child? No.
These are simply the facts.
Type 2 Diabetes
You probably know or have known someone with type 2 diabetes, and
chances are, that person is an overweight adult. It wasn’t until fairly recently
that type 2 diabetes began popping up with some regularity in kids. And what
do most of these kids have in common? You guessed it — they’re obese.
But what is diabetes? How does it start? What does it do? Why is it such a
dangerous disease? Basically, the condition results either from the body’s
inability to produce insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, or from
the body’s inability to use insulin properly. Insulin is necessary for breaking
down sugar in the body and using its byproducts for energy. When sugar isn’t
metabolized properly, it builds up in the body, wreaking all sorts of havoc
(which we get into later in this section).
A little background on diabetes
The two types of diabetes are
 Type 1: Occurs when the body simply doesn’t produce enough insulin.
Its onset is usually rapid and not related to weight gain; in fact, one
symptom of this type of diabetes is weight loss.

Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because it was once
the only type of diabetes that doctors commonly saw in people under
30. Nowadays, type 2 diabetes is becoming so common among younger
people that using the term juvenile to describe type 1 is misleading.
 Type 2: Occurs when a person has too much fatty tissue. In this environ-
ment, insulin just can’t do its job correctly, which leads to a condition
called insulin resistance; for that reason, type 2 is also sometimes called
insulin-resistant diabetes. Due to the amount of food that they consume,
obese children routinely rely on their bodies to produce an increased
amount of insulin. One theory is that these kids’ bodies just can’t keep
up with the demand, which is a pretty frightening thought considering
children have to rely on their bodies for a long, long time.
Among kids, type 2 diabetes is most often found in obese adolescents and
obese kids who have reached puberty. (Obesity can speed puberty along,
which is why pubescent kids aren’t always necessarily adolescents — at
least not age-wise). Most of the obese kids who develop type 2 diabetes
also have a family history of the disease. Some ethnic groups, including
African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians, are at
higher risk than others for the disease.
Metabolic syndrome
In obese children who haven’t yet reached puberty or adolescence, it’s not
uncommon to find what doctors call metabolic syndrome, a precursor to type
2 diabetes (and another condition that used to be seen mostly in adults). A
doctor can diagnose metabolic syndrome if a child meets three of the follow-
ing criteria:
 Obesity
 High blood sugar
 Increased blood pressure
 Raised levels of triglycerides
 Decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the “good” 
cholesterol
Pretty alarming, yes? These conditions sound better suited to your old Uncle
Sal, who’s been eating sausages and smoking like a fiend for 50 years — not
your child! The good news is that metabolic syndrome can be corrected and
reversed through exercise, healthy eating, and weight loss; the bad news is
that as soon as it progresses to diabetes, there’s no going back.
37
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Recognizing type 2 symptoms 
and complications
The health conditions that obese kids face are often insidious — they begin
without much notice. Although your child may not have any sense of feeling
unwell, symptoms of type 2 diabetes often include:
 Increased thirst and urination
 Blurry vision
 Increased appetite
 Constant tiredness
 Frequent infections, or infections or wounds that are very slow to heal
And what are the long-term complications of diabetes? Diabetes damages the
blood vessels, which leads to:
 Kidney damage
 Eye problems
 Nerve damage
 Vascular disease
Common long-term complications of diabetes are varied and include blind-
ness, amputation of the feet and legs, and complete kidney failure. (By long-
term, we’re talking about some of these conditions developing as early as the
20s or 30s if a person is diagnosed with diabetes in childhood.) Because the
biggest risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes is obesity, stopping an
obese child’s weight gain as soon as possible is imperative. To get started,
check out Part II of this book.

Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 
Good cholesterol?
In a nutshell, cholesterol comes in two vari-
eties: LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL
(high-density lipoprotein). LDL is the “bad” cho-
lesterol; it’s what sticks to the arterial walls,
causing blood clots and, by extension, heart
attacks, poor circulation, and so on. HDL is the
body’s helper in that it helps to clear out those
arteries, thus reducing one’s chance of devel-
oping serious complications from cholesterol.
The latest recommendations on cholesterol are
to not just lower the overall level but increase
the HDL level. The easy way to remember
which cholesterol is which is to look at it this
way: You want LDL levels to be low and HDL
levels to be high.

Up, Up, and Away: High Blood Pressure
Blood pressure technically measures the force of your blood pumping against
the arterial walls. If you take a look at where that pressure comes from, you
can say that blood pressure is the measure of how hard the heart is working.
When a nurse straps that cuff on your child’s arm and pumps it up, she’s
measuring his blood pressure. Normally, you’re informed right then and there
if the reading is high (indicating that the heart is working overtime). Children
whose readings are marginal (on the high side) are often diagnosed with
something called prehypertension, an indication that blood pressure may
soon be out of control.
Increased blood pressure used to be seen primarily in adults but now is 
also a serious threat to obese children and adolescents. High blood pressure
means that the heart is working harder than it should. Elevated blood pres-
sure can be traced to a number of factors, like stress and certain kidney dis-
eases, but being overweight is also a major cause.
Overweight and obese people tend to eat foods that are high in fat and 
cholesterol. When that food is broken down in the body, the cholesterol is
deposited in the blood vessels, narrowing the passageways for blood to flow
through. As a result, the heart pumps harder to get that blood through.
The serious ramifications of high blood pressure include an increased risk of
heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. Sure, these are serious ailments, but
we’re talking about children. These things just don’t happen to kids, do they?
Well, with increasing regularity, they are happening to kids. Although the 
frequency of strokes, for example, in children is still quite low, the fact that
these serious, adult-type ailments are striking obese kids at all is really fright-
ening. Pediatricians are at a loss to compare these problems to anything
they’ve seen in the past.
The danger of high blood pressure is that it does its damage over time. Even
though your obese 10-year-old may seem to be doing well enough, he’s at risk
for developing serious complications as he gets older. When the rest of his
friends are going strong through their early adulthood, your son’s obesity
and high blood pressure may catch up to him, and unfortunately, it’s not all
that uncommon to hear of an obese 30-year-old with heart disease. That’s
just too young for someone to be faced with a lifetime of illness.
Children who suffer from sleep apnea, a serious sleep disorder, also tend to
have high blood pressure. We talk about sleep apnea as it relates to obesity
in the “Sleep apnea” section later in this chapter.
39
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Now for some good news about weight-induced high blood pressure: Even 
if an obese child’s blood pressure is high enough to warrant medication,
lifestyle changes can usually correct the condition to the point where the
child doesn’t have to stay on medication indefinitely. Eating healthy, low-fat
foods and exercising, which increases blood flow and also helps to cleanse
those arteries, can produce great results if the condition’s caught and cor-
rected early enough.
Strains and Pains
If a 100-pound person jumped up and sat on your shoulders, you’d notice,
right? Aside from the immediate annoyance you’d feel toward whoever was
taking up residence on your person, eventually your legs would feel tired,
your knees might buckle, and you’d have to sit down (or toss the joker off 
his perch — or both).
The human body is only able to handle so much weight before joints, mus-
cles, and bones start giving way. Because weight gain is usually a gradual
process, it may seem reasonable enough to expect body parts to simply
adapt to the extra pounds, but that’s just not the way things turn out. 
Obese kids have an increased risk of:
 Decreased movement
 Fractures
 Joint deformities
 Joint pain
From decreased movement to fractures
Decreased movement is a big issue because obese children are often unable to
move in all the ways that children should move. They’re less likely to run and
play sports because they find it too difficult to bend, stretch, and keep up with
everyone else. Even the mundane activities of everyday life, like cleaning a
bedroom, become impossible. And this inability to move properly leads to
less movement, which makes the existing weight problem even worse.
Bones need weight-bearing exercise (which isn’t nearly as involved as it
sounds — walking is a weight-bearing exercise) to become strong and stay
that way. When a person isn’t able to strengthen bones through exercise, the
40
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

bones actually become weaker, which makes them more prone to fracture.
Fractures can further reduce mobility, which, of course, makes bones even
more frail. The problem can build upon itself until a person is effectively
immobile.
Simple physics also increase obese kids’ risk of bone fractures. When these
kids tumble, they bring their own weight down upon themselves. So if your
daughter is 50 pounds overweight and she trips, it’s like she has a 50-pound
weight strapped to her back, pushing her into the ground with that much
force. If she lands the wrong way on her wrist or her knee, you can imagine
how easily the bone would break.
Loss of mobility is a problem that doctors take very seriously, and not just
where obese children are concerned. The elderly, for example, are another
population in which weak bones are a primary concern. The fact that chil-
dren and elderly men and women share a common diagnosis is startling.
Joint points
Joint abnormalities are somewhat common among obese kids, but that doesn’t
make them any less serious. Conditions in the joints caused by obesity can
lead to permanent deformity. Some of the more common joint problems
include:
 Bowing: The knees and shins of overweight children obviously bear a
lot of extra weight, so these bones may bow, causing pain and decreas-
ing movement (which leads back to the preceding section).
 Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: In this hip condition, the ball of the
hip joint doesn’t develop properly, causing pain in either the hip or knee
of an obese child.
Bone and joint pain can be the toughest obstacle to introducing an obese
child to an exercise program. Exercise is sure to feel out of the question if
your child’s in pain whenever she moves. If your child suffers from bone or
joint pain, non-weight-bearing exercises like swimming and cycling may be
better options until she’s lost at least some of the weight.
Back it up!
Back problems are an area of great concern with obese children. The spine 
is made up of joints called vertebra that are stacked on top of each other.
41
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Excess weight causes them to compress, which results in back pain. This
compression can lead to incredibly painful arthritic conditions of the spine.
Other back problems brought on by obesity include:
 Degenerative disc disease: Deterioration of the discs of the vertebra,
leaving bone rubbing on bone
 Sciatica: Inflammation of the sciatic nerve running from the spine down
the back of each leg
 Spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the spine, leading to increased pressure
on the spinal cord
Obese children also tend not to have the best posture, which is something
else that can bring on back pain and strain. Reminding your child to stand or
sit up straight may help alleviate back pain.
If you know anyone who has suffered from back pain, then you know that it
can be a debilitating condition. Taking the pressure off the vertebra before
any permanent damage results is necessary for preventing years and years 
of excruciating pain.
Heavy Breathing: Asthma 
and Sleep Apnea
Obese children often experience labored breathing, and as a parent, you can
only imagine how terrifying and frustrating it must be for your child to try as
hard as he can and still feel as though he isn’t filling his lungs sufficiently.
Asthma is a fairly common condition, and it can be brought on by a variety 
of triggers, one of which is obesity. There are a couple of theories as to how
asthma relates to obesity. In this section, we talk about how obesity may
bring on asthmatic conditions, and we also discuss sleep apnea, a condition
marked by difficulty breathing during sleep.
Asthma and obesity
Asthma and obesity are both on the rise in this country, and there’s some
question as to whether obesity causes asthma . . . or asthma causes obesity.
42
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

The current thinking on the issue is that instead of being a trigger for asthma,
obesity is a condition that it makes a bad situation even worse.
More and more kids are being diagnosed with obesity, and more kids are having
a hard time with their lung function. Because these children are having a tough
time catching their collective breath, they aren’t getting much exercise — either
by choice or because their parents won’t allow it for fear of bringing on an asth-
matic episode.
Wow. That’s a tough position for a parent to be in. If your child is legitimately
having trouble breathing because she has asthma, you obviously aren’t going
to send her off to the playing fields. And if she’s also obese, you may be wrack-
ing your brain, trying to figure out how in the world you can help this child
lose weight if she can’t take 20 steps without her inhaler.
The 411 on asthma
To best understand asthma as it relates to obesity, you need a good, solid
understanding of asthma on its own. Essentially, asthma causes a swelling 
of the lining of the airways. The muscles around the airways tighten, and the
mucus produced clogs the airways and makes breathing difficult (and some-
times next to impossible). The following is a list of things that can trigger
asthma attacks:
 Allergens: Cat hair, dust, mold, pollen
 Stress: Strong emotional reactions, like fear or shock
 The elements: Cold air, heat, humidity
 Pollutants: Smoke, smog, perfume, anything with a strong odor
 Respiratory infections: A bad cold, flu, sinus infection
 Exercise: Physical activity, particularly in cold weather
The role of obesity in triggering asthma
For decades, doctors have believed that people are either born with asth-
matic tendencies or they aren’t and that the right triggers have to be in place
for someone with a genetic predisposition to the disease to actually develop
it. (In other words, you may be born with asthmatic tendencies and never
know it if nothing ever triggered an asthma attack.)
Recall that asthma causes a tightening of the muscles around the airways.
Part of the new theory about obesity and asthma suggests that a significant
amount of extra weight adds to the pressure exerted on the airways during
an asthma attack. Another part of the obesity/asthma theory suggests that
43
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

extra weight around the lungs may actually trigger an asthmatic episode
because the excess weight narrows the airway passages, but, to date, this
theory hasn’t been proven.
What doctors know for sure is that adipose tissue (that’s simply fat tissue,
dressed in up medical terms) releases an inflammatory chemical called inter-
leukin into the bloodstream and that this substance is found in elevated
amounts in the blood of obese men, women, and children. Asthma symptoms
result from an inflammation of the airways, so it stands to reason that some-
one with a genetic predisposition toward asthma and an excess amount of
this inflammatory chemical floating around in the bloodstream would proba-
bly go on to develop asthma and that the asthma may only be exacerbated by
the individual’s weight problem.
Studies have shown that obese asthmatic children tend to have more severe
reactions to triggers like smog and smoke; these reactions are most likely
linked to increased levels of interleukin.
What else do doctors know for sure about asthma and obesity? Although
many normal-weight children outgrow asthma by the time they reach their
teen years, obese children are more likely to hang onto the condition through
adulthood. Doctors aren’t quite sure why this is so, but it’s something they’re
seeing more and more frequently.
The final word on the connection between asthma and obesity in children is
that it’s a chicken-or-the-egg kind of issue. As of this writing, no one really
knows which brings on which or if one condition makes the other one worse.
Because both asthma and obesity are becoming so prevalent among kids, it’s
safe to say that research on these topics will continue and that, hopefully
soon, a definitive link will be made between the two and improve treatment
options.
Sleep apnea
Admit it: You still sneak into your kids’ rooms at night just to make sure
they’re breathing. The parents of obese children sometimes get a shock when
they realize their children aren’t breathing, at least temporarily. Obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that occurs in overweight children and adults
and results in a person not breathing for ten seconds or more on a regular
basis throughout the night. The person then wakes up gasping for breath and
may or may not remember the episode in the morning.
44
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

OSA also affects older people and is usually associated with having a large
neck. The neck is so full of fatty tissue that when the child lies down, the
throat narrows, making breathing extremely difficult. Snoring is one of the
classic symptoms of OSA (though not all people who snore have a breathing
problem).
On the surface, OSA sounds scary — anything that causes your child to stop
breathing, however temporary, is frightening. OSA and resulting sleepless-
ness can lead to some pretty grave social and health conditions, including:
 Constant fatigue
 Morning headaches
 Inability to concentrate and decreased attention span, leading to lower
grades and poor judgment
 Hyperactivity
 Bedwetting
 Weight gain
 Depression
Sleep is incredibly important for children and adolescents; it’s the time when
their bodies grow and reenergize for what lies ahead the next day. And OSA
often isn’t limited to just one episode of gasping for air; some children awaken
repeatedly throughout the night, every night, and don’t remember anything
about it (because they’re exhausted).
When a child loses sleep on a regular basis, her body doesn’t perform as it
should. Metabolism slows down, which results in unused calories and, in
turn, excess weight. Hormones are also thrown off balance, resulting in an
increased feeling of hunger. Overall, OSA is linked to a definite decline in 
the enjoyment of life. How can a child have a productive day if she’s fatigued
and otherwise not feeling well? The findings that reveal that OSA can cause
weight gain make this another vicious cycle that obese kids face: They’re too
tired to exercise but are physically unable to catch up on their sleep so that
maybe tomorrow they’ll feel (and do) better.
Even if your child isn’t suffering any apparent daytime effects of OSA, the
condition can lead to very serious physical ailments down the road, including
high blood pressure and heart disease.
45
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Fatty Liver
When we say “fatty liver,” we’re talking about an actual medical diagnosis;
we’re not insulting an oversized liver. The full name of this condition is nonal-
coholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and it refers to the tendency of fat to accu-
mulate in the livers of obese children and adults and people with diabetes.
So what does the liver do? A lot. Functions of the liver include:
 Absorbing fat
 Filtering toxins
 Regulating blood sugar
 Producing hormones and vitamins
 Storing minerals and iron
Wow! That’s some organ!
While fatty liver in and of itself isn’t all that harmful, its potential for destruction
is big. NAFLD can cause inflammation of the liver, which can lead to scarring
and other irregularities in the tissue. This damage can lead to a more serious
inflammatory condition of the liver called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Some doctors argue that all obese children should be tested for liver prob-
lems in order to stop the most serious damage before it goes too far. Ask your
child’s doctor about testing.
These liver conditions are diseases that progress very slowly, and the end
results are rarely positive. Studies suggest that a child who develops NASH
has a fairly good chance of going on to suffer from cirrhosis (scarring) of the
liver later in life. The scarring blocks blood flow and pretty much shuts down
the liver altogether. It’s irreversible and very serious. Cirrhosis of the liver is
also most commonly seen in long-term alcoholics, which gives you some idea
of the damage that excess fat can do to the liver.
The concern here isn’t that obese children are in immediate danger of devel-
oping a terminal illness of the liver; rather, the worry is that they’re laying the
groundwork for these ailments to more easily take root later in life. Liver dis-
ease is very hard to treat, let alone cure, so patients often end up on the list
for donor livers (with varying degrees of success, of course). Liver donation
is another worry within the medical community, because with the way obe-
sity rates among children are climbing, it seems likely that in 10 or 15 years,
the waiting list for donor livers may be filled with relatively young people.
46
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

Skin Eruptions
Yes, this chapter is called “The Damage You Don’t See,” and you can, of
course, see most skin problems. However, at least one skin condition that’s
common among obese children stems from an inner physical condition. So
you see, what we see isn’t always the result of what we’re seeing. (Confused?
Read on.)
Pigment problems
Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by markings around the
armpits, neck, or groin. The marks are light to dark brown and look like flat
velvet. Acanthosis nigricans doesn’t affect only obese people, but in obese
people, the condition’s the result of elevated insulin levels.
What on earth do insulin levels have to do with brown marks on the skin?
When there’s too much insulin wandering around inside the body, it looks 
for a place to crash; the insulin goes in search of insulin receptors for this
purpose, and it finds them in certain areas of the body (neck, armpits, and
groin). Although acanthosis nigricans is a painless condition, it can be embar-
rassing. Sometimes a change in diet is enough to minimize its appearance; in
other cases, a topical ointment may be prescribed.
When acanthosis nigricans appears, you know something’s going on inside
the body. Skin eruptions usually don’t do any permanent damage (aside from
acne, which can leave scars behind in thin kids and heavy kids), but they can
be uncomfortable. Don’t lose sleep over them, but do take your child for a
doctor’s visit.
Rashes
Obese kids are more susceptible than others to heat rash, an irritation of the
top layer of the skin due to excessive perspiration. It doesn’t need to be a
hot, humid day in order for someone to break out in heat rash. Overweight
people tend to perspire more than their thinner counterparts regardless of
the environment, and sweat is the key player in this irritating rash.
Although rashes may seem like the least of your worries where your obese
child is concerned, they’re one more physical side effect of being overweight.
47
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Fungus among us
Fungal infections can pop up in the skin folds of obese kids because fungi
need a damp, warm environment in order to grow, and flaps of flesh do just
fine. Fungal rashes are serious because
 They can be very painful.
 They can spread rapidly.
 They need to be treated with a topical antifungal. Soap and water won’t
do the trick, nor will any over-the-counter lotions or ointments.
If you suspect your child has a fungal skin infection, she should see her
doctor as soon as possible.
All Backed Up: Digestive Problems
Kids love to tell jokes about constipation and dirty underwear. Digestive
problems aren’t so funny, though, when your child suffers from them on a
chronic basis.
Obese kids are more prone to constipation than other kids because they’re
more likely to eat cookies, chips, and ice cream rather than healthy, fibrous
foods such as fruits, veggies, and whole grains. If your child isn’t eating
enough (or any) fiber, his body will have a pretty tough time getting the rem-
nants of the food moving through the intestines. Cleaning out the colon is
fiber’s main job and the reason why it’s so important for good health. (Fiber
also fills the stomach faster than sugar- or fat-loaded snacks do.)
Some of the side effects of constipation include:
 Nausea
 Gas pain
 Heartburn
 Painful straining in the bathroom (which can lead to hemorrhoids and
fissures, which are tears in the rectal opening)
So, these may not be the most serious of all medical conditions, but chronic
constipation can be very uncomfortable and cause depression (wouldn’t you
be depressed if you felt bound up all the time?); it also puts one at risk for
48
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

developing colon cancer later in life. Cleaning out that bowel every day
should be your child’s goal! (Well, one of his goals.)
Not only are obese kids at a higher risk for constipation, but they’re also
more prone to fecal soiling (having an accident — large or small — in their
underpants). As for why fecal soiling occurs more frequently in obese chil-
dren, there’s no solid answer, but it may be due to diet. Certain foods rich in
sugar and grease can result in loose stools. The amount of food that an obese
child takes in is substantial, and the substantial byproducts have to come out
eventually.
Fecal soiling isn’t considered a harmful condition, but certainly it can be a
mortifying experience for a kid who’s dealing with enough problems already.
Kids may be too embarrassed to talk about it or ask for help. If you suspect
that your child is having fecal soiling accidents, let him know he can talk to
you without being embarrassed. Together, you can talk to his doctor and
attempt to find a solution.
Heart Disease
You’re an adult. If you’re even slightly overweight, you’ve no doubt heard
your doctor say, “Lose the weight!” But why? If you’re not obese, and you’re
not at high risk for developing any of the ailments we talk about in this chap-
ter, what harm can a few extra pounds do?
Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women in the United States.
Damage to the heart and blood vessels can begin in childhood and is due to
an unhealthy lifestyle! Although not all heart disease can be prevented, most
of it can be. Being overweight puts a major strain on the heart and is one of
the main factors in developing heart trouble. So if lugging around 15 extra
pounds is reason for concern, carrying 50, 60, or 100 excess pounds is really
reason to worry.
High cholesterol
High cholesterol plays a major part in the development of heart disease. We
talk about HDL and LDL levels earlier in this chapter (see the sidebar “Good
cholesterol?”), and we also discuss how cholesterol deposits itself on the
walls of blood vessels. High cholesterol means that one has significant cho-
lesterol buildup in his or her blood vessels. As blood tries to churn its way
through the blood vessels, it gets caught on the cholesterol, causing a blood
49
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

clot. Ultimately, the blood clot may finally break free and either travel to the
heart and cause a heart attack or travel to the brain and cause a stroke.
What does high cholesterol and heart disease have to do with your obese
child? The damage to the blood vessels can start in childhood! This is some-
times shocking news to parents who can’t imagine that their child’s arteries
may look like those of a middle-aged man (and one who doesn’t take very
good care of himself, at that).
Strokes kill and impair 150,000 men and women every year. It’s a condition
that isn’t always the result of being obese, but obesity significantly increases
the risk of having a stroke.
Another condition that often begins in childhood and significantly increases
an adult’s chances of developing cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, or
damage to the heart arteries.
Enlarged heart
When a cardiologist runs a risk factor score on an adult — a man, for 
example — to determine whether he’s at high risk for heart disease, the doc
very often takes a look at whether or not this patient has a condition of 
the heart called left ventricular hypertrophy, or what’s commonly called an
enlarged heart. (If the patient has an enlarged heart, that’s not good news for
him or his risk factor score.)
Now here’s the frightening part: Even though this man is being evaluated as
an adult, the enlargement may have begun in childhood, especially if he was
obese. In some people, the heart fights back against resistance (narrowed
blood vessels) it meets as it works to pump blood throughout the body by
making itself larger. The heart doesn’t know that it can’t win this game by
morphing into a monster organ.
Obesity and Development Problems
Take an informal survey of your own friends and colleagues and ask them
what the most difficult time of their life was (excluding specific events like
the death of a loved one or the loss of a job). We’re willing to bet that a lot of
your pals will say that junior high and/or high school were nightmare years, a
time that they’d never return to even if they were given the chance and
offered a million dollars to do so.
50
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

These years are hard for so many young people for different reasons, but
when you think back on it, what was everyone dealing with? Puberty. Surely
you remember it — feeling awkward in your new supposedly almost-adult
body, dealing with the moodiness of shifting hormones, and wondering if
anyone else was feeling the same way that you were. (Shudder.)
Early development in girls
Puberty for girls is occurring at younger ages these days. On average, girls
start to develop one to two years earlier than their mothers did. What’s caus-
ing these changes? You know the answer — obesity.
Just how obesity plays a role in the early development of puberty isn’t crys-
tal clear. However, obesity has been linked to a hormone called leptin that’s
found in fat cells. Research indicates that girls with high levels of leptin in
their blood are entering puberty earlier than their thinner pals.
Are there any negative effects of early puberty? The jury is still out on the
issue. It’s possible that early puberty in girls may raise their risk for breast
cancer in adulthood because they have increased levels of estrogen coursing
through their bodies earlier and for a longer duration than their peers.
For the most part, the effects of early puberty in girls are mostly emotional.
Being the first kid in the classroom to go through puberty — being not only
obese but also the tallest and the only girl wearing a bra — is difficult, espe-
cially if all the other girls in the class seem to be light years away from
making the leap. Different development is just another way that obese kids
can feel different and separated from their peers.
Delayed development in boys
Interestingly, early studies have shown that obesity has the opposite effect
on boys than it does on girls — that is, obesity may actually slow puberty in
males. So where obese girls are feeling strange about being the first ones to
develop breasts and tower over their friends, obese boys are often the short-
est kids in their classrooms. While they listen to their friends’ voices change
and watch the other boys shoot past them on the growth charts, obese boys
are left behind, feeling left out and different from everyone else.
51
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Puberty and depression
Even though obese children may be relatively alone in their conditions (that
is, they may only have a classmate or two in the same boat), dealing with the
emotional highs and lows and the confusing physical changes of puberty at
the age of 9 or 10 (for girls) is no easy task. It’s hard enough for 12- and 13-
year-olds. And being the last one to develop (as obese boys often are) also
leaves a child feeling as though there’s something wrong with him — why
isn’t he like his friends?
Obesity and puberty are two difficult conditions to deal with separately.
Taken together, a child may come to feel depressed and isolated from his or
her peers. We talk more about the emotional and social ramifications that
puberty has on children in Chapter 4.
Making Changes: Time Is of the Essence!
Given all the terrible health problems your obese child could face, is there
any good news? Should you just hang it up right now and forget about trying
to help your child? The key word here is could — if the damage hasn’t already
been done, these conditions are, for the most part, preventable (where there
isn’t any genetic predisposition to an illness, like asthma, for example). And
many of them are reversible. But as with the weight, the first priority is to
stop the condition from getting any worse.
Avoiding cumulative effects
Most of the conditions we talk about in this chapter are like hurricanes at sea
in that they get stronger with time, until one day you and your child realize
that you’re facing a crisis. The big storm comes blowing through, but unlike 
a natural disaster, it won’t leave. With obesity-related health problems, you’re
left to deal with the ongoing damage.
This chapter examines the long-term effects of diseases that can begin in
obese children. This doesn’t mean that every obese child will go on to suffer
from these ailments. This information is more like a storm warning: If nothing
changes, conditions are favorable for these illnesses to develop.
Because these ailments are, for the most part, preventable, it’s an awful
waste not to at least try to stop them from occurring. The benefits of heading
trouble off at the pass are so plentiful, and the long-reaching effects of these
52
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obesity 

conditions are so harmful that it’s in your entire family’s best interest to 
start now. Twenty years from today, you don’t want to be watching your 
child struggling with obesity-related health conditions, lamenting the fact
that none of you took the risks seriously when she was young.
As we say throughout the chapter, the damage starts early. Youth doesn’t
protect obese kids from suffering long-term health effects related to excess
weight. Your child’s doctor is the best source of information on your child’s
health, so pay him a visit, share your concerns, and listen to what he advises.
There is no later. The damage done today only opens the door for more
damage tomorrow, so help your child to cut it short.
Reversing adverse effects
In overweight kids, heart problems begin with elevated levels of cholesterol
and a sedentary lifestyle. Cholesterol builds up in the blood vessels, raising
blood pressure and putting your child at risk for developing blood clots,
which put her at risk for all kinds of cardiovascular nightmares. However, 
if it hasn’t gone too far, she can reverse some of this damage by increasing
her activity and decreasing her intake of fatty foods.
The same thing goes for elevated blood pressure: A good diet and exercise go
a long way toward counteracting the negative effects of obesity. As soon as
your child gets on track, her heart function will improve, which means that
her heart will pump more efficiently. If she’s eating healthy foods and exercis-
ing, her LDL (bad cholesterol) levels will drop, and her HDL (good choles-
terol) levels may rise, thus helping to clear out any narrowed blood vessels.
There’s not a whole lot anyone can do about established diabetes, so preven-
tion is really the key. Diabetes is such a serious condition with such varied
effects and long-term complications that it’s just best never to open the door
to its arrival. Once established, diabetes can be managed through diet, exer-
cise, and medication. Studies show that diabetics who adhere to their doc-
tors’ advice do much better in the long run than their diabetic counterparts
who do nothing to improve their overall health. Doctors’ advice most often
includes losing weight, increasing activity, following a strict diet, and moni-
toring blood glucose levels closely.
Like diabetes, puberty is impossible to reverse. If your obese daughter has
entered into puberty at an early age, her hormones are operating at an adult
level. You can’t undo her period or her breasts, but you can help her accept
these changes and assure her that the other girls will eventually catch up.
The same advice goes for boys experiencing delayed puberty.
53
Chapter 3: Facing the Physical Effects of Childhood Obesity

Which of the other conditions discussed in this chapter are preventable?
 Joint, muscle, and bone problems: Fractures and bone deformities can
cause lifelong pain. Losing weight and participating in weight-bearing
exercise can help build bone density and promote bone health.
 Sleep apnea: Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by the throat closing in
on itself. Losing weight shrinks the amount of fatty tissue surrounding
the neck, thus preventing this problem.
 Liver disease: “Fatty liver,” caused by an accumulation of fat cells in the
liver, isn’t a particularly harmful condition, but it can lead to more seri-
ous problems. Lose the fat, and you lose the potential for damage to the
liver.
 Skin problems: Obese kids are more prone to rashes because the shape
and condition of their bodies give bacteria and fungi a place to go to
work. Increased sweating and folds of skin open the door to all sorts of
infections. Losing weight and therefore changing the shape of the body
is the most effective way to avoid common skin problems.
 Constipation: Adding fiber to the diet heads bowel trouble off at 
the pass.
This list includes almost everything we discuss in this chapter, so as frighten-
ing and depressing as this chapter is, it’s all a prelude to this big message:
These things don’t have to happen to your child!
Considering that these ailments, at best, can make life miserable for your child
and, at worst, can actually put your child’s life in jeopardy, it makes perfect
sense for a parent to want to put some plan into action. You want to stop the
wheels of obesity and its related damage and steer your child toward a health-
ier life today. Just remember that change takes time. Losing the weight is well
worth the effort, but it isn’t going to happen overnight. Weight loss is a long-
term commitment, and your child has to be willing to make some sacrifices in
order to have a better, longer, happier life. This book can help, but your best
resource where health matters are concerned is your child’s pediatrician.

The Emotional Effects of
Childhood Obesity
In This Chapter

I
n Chapter 3, we talk about the possible long-term physical consequences
of children carrying around excess weight. In addition to health problems
(or often because of these conditions), obese children’s weight keeps them
on the sidelines of life, quite literally: A severely overweight child is unlikely
to be capable up keeping up with her thinner peers on the playing field.
Worse, she may not even want to try; obese children are so often the objects
of ridicule and finger-pointing at school and on the playground.
The type of torment that overweight kids face is different from what obese
adults encounter for a couple of reasons: First, children are still discovering
who they are, what they’re capable of, and how they view themselves. A con-
stant barrage of name-calling and teasing during these formative years can
affect the way a kid feels about herself for the rest of her life. Second, unlike
most adults, who are supposed to mature and accept one another as they
age, children say what’s on their little minds all the time. Most youngsters
don’t have a filtering switch, and even if little Susie asks your daughter only
once why she’s so heavy . . . your child has already faced the question from
50 other children.
The goal of this book is to help you help your child work toward better
health and feel better about herself. We’re not pushing the concept that all

children must be stick-thin in order to be happy. But children have to feel
well, both emotionally and physically, in order to feel good. This chapter
addresses some of the emotional horrors that obese children face and gives
you some tips to help your child steer her way through to better times.
Sticks and Stones? They’re Nothing!
Everyone knows that the old self-esteem booster, “Sticks and stones may
break my bones, but names will never hurt me” isn’t true. It’s a great concept,
but try explaining it to an overweight preteen boy who’s sitting in his room
alone thinking about how he was teased in the school cafeteria last week.
That vision is enough to just break your heart wide open, right? Why are
other kids so cruel?
Although its small comfort to any parent whose child is suffering at the
hands of peer emotional terrorists, your child isn’t the first to go through 
this experience and, unfortunately, he won’t be the last. Children are all
about conformity, and your child isn’t the only one being picked on. Kids 
who go after an overweight child also pick on someone from a different
socioeconomic group, race, or even academic ranking; you name it, and 
it’s fair game for some rotten apples out there.
What’s really upsetting is that good apples are often influenced to treat peers
badly, also. Most times, this type of behavior is nothing more than an attempt
to protect themselves and/or conform to what everyone else is doing. It’s the
rare kid who can break free from the pack and truly not give a hoot about
what the others are saying to or about him and his friends. Facing ridicule at
the hands of a known bully is devastating enough for a child, and it’s about a
hundred times worse when his own friends turn on him.
In this section, we explain what your obese child may be facing in social situ-
ations and what you can do to help him stay strong.
Helping your child deal with bullies
If your child were one of a group of minority students in her school and
someone tossed a racial epithet her way, you’d expect her teacher to step 
in and prevent it from happening again, right? And if your child were handi-
capped and a classmate constantly teased her about being in a wheelchair,
you’d think that the school would find this type of behavior 100 percent
unacceptable and take the bully to task, correct? Even though society’s done
56
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

away with condoning most types of discrimination, prejudice against over-
weight people still runs rampant.
The good news is that many school districts teach character education (com-
passion, acceptance of others, and how to stick up for other children) along
with the three R’s these days. However, some teachers (and schools) are
better at nurturing these ideas than others. Teachers are only human, and
they come with their own baggage, which may include very little tolerance
for settling disputes between children when the letter of the law isn’t
involved (as it is in the case of a racial incident).
Even if your child has a wonderfully insightful and talented teacher, over-
weight kids who are picked on by their peers are often darned if they do, and
darned if they don’t — get the teacher involved, that is. If the teacher comes
to your child’s rescue on a regular basis, her classmates may label your kid a
“tattletale” or a “baby.” On the other hand, if your child doesn’t report bully-
ing, she may be setting herself up for further incidents. Bullies love a victim
who sits quietly and takes the abuse, but they also love a kid who fights
them, because then they feel completely justified in hurling insults at the
child (in the name of self-defense).
Being the victim of a bully doesn’t make kids tougher, nor does it teach them
much about peer-to-peer relationships. Kids who are the victims of bullies:
 Tend to have low self-esteem and no self-confidence
 Often suffer from depression
 May develop nervous tics or compulsive habits
 Show signs of anxiety (such as having irrational fears or a general feeling
of panic all the time)
 Have trouble sleeping
 May have thoughts of suicide
 Sometimes exhibit uncontrollable rage towards others
 Often have trouble with their schoolwork
Many of these effects can last well beyond the years when kids are actually
being bullied, so it’s safe to say that being tormented by a bully can have a
profound, long-lasting effect on a child’s life. It’s even safe to say that being
the victim of a bully can shape a child’s life. (For more on the effects of bully-
ing, see the section “How Emotional Abuse Hurts Your Child” later in this
chapter.)
57
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

Understanding relational bullying
Bullying comes in many different forms. There’s overt bullying — as in physi-
cal or verbal abuse or other physical acts of intimidation — and then there’s
relational bullying, which involves shutting the victim out of social groups
and/or spreading rumors about the child.
If your child has been fortunate enough to escape being bullied or teased,
she still may not be in the clear. Overweight kids often feel isolated from their
classmates, who, studies have shown, perceive obese children as being less
intelligent, lazier, and not as hygienic as the average kid. (Never mind the fact
that your daughter may be smart as a whip, always eager to help around the
house, and obsessed with keeping her desk as neat as a pin.) When kids
intentionally ignore a peer or leave her out of group activities, that’s rela-
tional bullying. It’s not as obvious to the naked eye as someone beating your
child up on the playground, but it’s every bit as damaging to her self-esteem.
Although relational bullying usually doesn’t involve physical contact, it’s
meant to demean and intimidate the victim.
Relational bullying often takes the form of a classic passive-aggressive situa-
tion in which a child is left out of a group but isn’t necessarily called names
or teased. So where’s the damage? The child feels invisible and not worthy of
her peers’ attention.
While it’s debatable whether this type of bullying is preferable to your 
child being physically harmed by a classmate, it’s just as harmful to her self-
esteem. The one good thing — if there is a good thing — about physical bully-
ing is that you know it’s going on, you know who’s doing it, and your child
may have a legitimate recourse against the perpetrator(s). It’s easier for a
teacher or another adult to step in and stop physical bullying (although they
don’t always do it, of course).
Relational bullying is something that even the nicest, quietest kid in the class-
room may be doing to your child (and what’s worse, she may not even realize
she’s doing it at all!). Whereas many kids realize that overt bullying is wrong
and would never dream of calling names or hitting a classmate, relational bul-
lying tends to take on a life of its own, and before anyone knows what’s hap-
pened, one or two children have been singled out. Unfortunately, because of
the stereotypes associated with overweight people, obese children are an
easy target for this type of social isolation.
Bullying is harmful to the psyche regardless of your child’s age or gender, 
but girls seem to be particularly tough on obese peers during the teen years.
Adolescent girls are more likely than boys to mock, taunt, or just ignore their
overweight female schoolmates. And given that adolescents depend on peers
58
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

to validate them (it’s that conformity thing again), an obese teen girl who’s
teased by her peers on a daily basis is at high risk for depression.
An obese kid has to work twice as hard to convince his peers that there’s
more to him than a weight issue. He’s often viewed as “the fat kid” — the one
without any real feelings, interests, or goals in life. And the twist to this is
that because overweight kids are so often teased, they’re more likely to keep
quiet in the classroom and to isolate themselves at recess or free time as a
protective mechanism. No one gets to know your child because he’s afraid of
what may happen if he opens his mouth.
Taking action for your child
How can you help your child when she’s being shunned and bullied by her
classmates? It’s always best for a child to try and work things out by herself
first by ignoring unkind comments and walking away from the children who
are making them. Many times, removing oneself from the situation is enough
to stop cruelty in its tracks. However, when bullying escalates into a day-in,
day-out, business-as-usual situation, you need to step in. You have a number
of different ways to handle things:
 If your child’s teacher is someone you trust to help, take up the issue
with him or her. Good teachers are a special breed unto themselves,
and they often come up with creative solutions that other people would
never think of.
 If the teacher isn’t so great and the bullying is nonstop in the class-
room, talk to him or her first, but be prepared to go to the principal if
the situation doesn’t improve. Your child is at the very least entitled to
learn in a nonthreatening environment.
 Be there for your child, and continue with your weight-loss/health-
improvement goals at home. Offer your child loads and loads of sup-
port and plenty of opportunities to talk. Knowing that you’re on her 
side no matter what happens outside of your home is exactly what 
she needs.
 Let your child know that bullies are usually very weak people. No one
who likes themselves teases someone else. Also, remind her that bullies
most often act only in front of their peers because they’re seldom brave
enough to act so badly all by themselves.
 Encourage your child to stick with a group of pals. Just as a bully is
more likely to act when his buddies are in tow, he’s somewhat less likely
to attack if your child is with a group.
59
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

 Encourage your child to portray confidence, even if it’s just for show.
Funny thing about that bully — he’s quick to pick on a child who’s always
staring down at her shoes and walking with her shoulders slumped. He
just may have second thoughts if his victim learns to stand up straight
and stare him in the eye. A subtle difference in her demeanor can have
big effects.
Discourage your child from returning taunts; instruct your child to keep her-
self civil and even-tempered. Bullies who open a back-and-forth dialogue with
their victims often feel justified in continuing their tirades, and your child
may even be blamed in the future for instigating trouble. Plus, there’s a big
difference between sitting quietly and taking the abuse, speaking up for her-
self, and getting lured into the bitterness that always results from trading
insults with other people.
If the bullying problem is bad enough (that is, if your child is being hurt phys-
ically or tormented to the point where she refuses to go to school), insist
upon an intervention at school. You want your child and the bullying ring-
leader to sit down and talk — that’s all. The younger the kids, the more effec-
tive this meeting will be because younger bullies often only need to realize
that the person they’ve been tormenting is a real, live person — and not a
60
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 
Cyberbullying
One of the worst kinds of relational bullying is
cyberbullying, which is a growing problem in
this technological day and age. Cyberbullies
either post lies or gossip about their victims in
chat rooms or on Web sites or they insult vic-
tims in instant-messaging (IM) sessions. The
anonymity of this type of bullying means that it
tends to get very ugly, very quickly. And track-
ing down a cyberbully can be very difficult,
depending on how computer-savvy the bully is
and how well you and/or your child know your
own way around cyberspace. Most experts in
the field of cyberbullying advise kids to simply
ignore a one-time incident because responding
to taunts or threats is likely to make the situa-
tion worse.
If your child is being bombarded with threats
and insults, though, you should save and print
all the messages you can and take them to your
child’s principal. School officials should be
trained in combating this type of harassment,
and many times, messages can be traced back
to a specific computer. You can also contact the
police if the threats are physical in nature (like
someone telling your child she’s going to be
harmed).
To prevent this type of bullying in the first place,
advise your child to only chat with known bud-
dies and not to give out personal information to
anyone who isn’t already an established pal.
Many times, kids are “baited” into chatting by
acquaintances who then turn around and use
the children’s words against them.

punching bag — before they call it quits. Parents and teachers should be pre-
sent to lead the conversation and act as moderators.
Older bullies may be a little harder to convince, so you’ll need the school on
your side. Here’s your angle: Your child has the right to learn in a nonthreat-
ening environment; if the school isn’t willing to take steps to create such an
environment (by giving the bully a chance to knock it off or face detention or
suspension), you’ll be forced to take further action, in the form of hiring a
lawyer who deals in discrimination. Period. Your child’s well-being is at stake,
so you really have no other choice than to take a course of action that’s in
her best interest.
When bullying persists and you start getting all fired up, keep two caveats in
mind:
 Don’t threaten legal action until it becomes apparent that it’s your last
course of action.
 Don’t threaten unless you mean it. The threat itself makes you a threat to
the school district, and you’ll be treated as such even though you’re in
the right.
You may feel as though it’s only fair to give the school time to remedy the sit-
uation. Fair enough. Give the principal and the teacher a couple of weeks —
maximum — to formulate a plan that’s acceptable to you and your family, and
be prepared to be given the bum’s rush a few times. Be firm but polite, and
don’t give up on this. If the principal doesn’t return your calls, clear some
time to sit in the school office until she can see you. And if that doesn’t work,
speak to her boss and watch how fast she jumps into action. Remember to
remain calm and polite, and document every communication between your-
self and the school.
Maybe you feel like demanding change from your child’s teacher and princi-
pal is taking things too far; the school certainly is looking out for your child,
and anyway, kids are kids. What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, right?
Make no mistake about it: It may well be up to you to see that your child’s
school protects her emotional well-being. School administrators love to
spout off for a crowd about their interest in child advocacy; the sad reality is
that many times (though not always), the higher-ups are first and foremost
school advocates (worried most about how test scores and negative gossip
and publicity may affect their schools and, consequently, their jobs) and
somewhere way, way down the line, they’re concerned with the needs of 
each individual child.
61
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

And what about the notion that teasing acts as some sort of mechanism for
developing a tougher skin? It’s not true. Teasing often leads to:
 Depression
 Isolation
 Additional weight gain
 Anxiety
 Anger
Resolving bullying is a quality-of-life issue. The more your child is teased and
bullied, the worse she feels about herself. And the worse she feels about her-
self, the worse her weight problem is likely to be. If she doesn’t have any
friends and is scared to leave the house, what else is she supposed to do
besides watch TV and console herself with a snack?
Turning the tables: When obese kids become bullies
Here’s an interesting twist to the bullying tale: Not only are obese children
more likely to be bullied, but they’re also more likely to turn the anger they
feel toward other children and become bullies themselves. It makes perfect
sense, if you think about it: How much isolation and taunting can a child bear
before he starts hating everyone and wanting to hurt someone as badly as
he’s been hurt?
Mental health specialists see this type of behavior (abused becoming abuser)
in victims of any sort of abuse. The victim has nothing to lose, nothing to
look forward to, nothing to make him feel good about himself, and no one to
turn to, so he lashes out. In obese children, this reaction is just as much a
defense mechanism (as in “I’ll hurt them before they can hurt me”) as it is an
action born of anger and depression.
So preventing your child from becoming a bully, too, is another very impor-
tant reason for you to get involved and make sure your child’s school is pro-
moting a safe learning environment. We know, your parents never handled
things this way. In your day, kids were expected to settle their own disputes,
and parents often never knew a thing about what was really happening. Put
that argument aside, and take a look at the world right now. Kids who are iso-
lated from their peers often exhibit signs of severe depression, and the fallout
can be extremely damaging in the long term, leading to a lifetime of poor self-
esteem. School violence — often perpetrated by kids who’ve been bullied for
years — and teen suicide have become things that parents cross their fingers
and hope their kids don’t get involved in.
62
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

It’s not your job to hold your child’s hand all the way up through high school,
but it is your job to make sure that the school does everything it can to pro-
vide a learning environment that’s safe for your child and that doesn’t make
your child say things like, “I’d rather die than go to school.” Because you can
be sure of one thing: If your kid is being targeted, others are also suffering
from the same type of injustice. That kind of environment breeds violence,
and . . . yes, it’s up to you to see that it stops here and now.
Facing fat prejudice
The torment that obese children face each day in school and on the play-
ground is just a symptom of a much broader issue: Overweight people are
fair game for overt discrimination, even in this day and age of supposed toler-
ance for everyone.
If you were walking down the street and someone made a derogatory com-
ment about the color of your skin, bystanders would most likely be horrified.
Some may even yell insults back to the perpetrator, defending not only your
dignity but also civilized society, which doesn’t tolerate such public displays
of nastiness . . . except when it comes to overweight and obese people. If you
were walking down the street and someone made a comment about the size
of your thighs, not only would you feel ashamed, but also you probably
wouldn’t receive a whole lot of support from strangers on the street. The
reason is simple: Overweight people are perceived to be lazy, unintelligent,
responsible for their own situations, and therefore, no good.

Obesity and income: Chicken or the egg?
Researchers have found an inverse link
between income and obesity in this country;
that is, obese people are more likely to fall into
a lower household income bracket. The studies
don’t explain why this is the case, though. Is it
because obese people face discrimination in
the job market and therefore aren’t as likely as
their peers to land high-paying jobs, or is it that
healthy foods are just too expensive, so low-
income families are forced to make less healthy
choices at mealtimes? (In Chapter 8, we talk
about this myth and give tips for shopping for
healthy foods on a budget.) Or does it possibly
go even deeper than that? Researchers are
looking into the possibility that obese children
have such low self-esteem that they’re less
likely to be overly ambitious in planning their
futures, which makes them less likely to attend
college and therefore less likely to end up in
high-paying professions. The results aren’t in,
but this theory certainly makes sense from a
logical point of view.

In the section “Understanding relational bullying” earlier in this chapter, we
describe how obese children are viewed by their peers, and the adjectives
are exactly the same as the ones listed here. Weight prejudice is a societal
problem, spanning all age groups. Logic would dictate that as the numbers 
of overweight children and adults increase, so would other people’s under-
standing and tolerance. The fact of the matter is that things seem to be 
getting worse. Whether it’s because society on the whole doesn’t value
politeness or because we don’t encourage kindness between strangers, 
the fact is that overweight people deal with personal insults from complete
strangers on a regular basis. This abuse is the emotional equivalent of walk-
ing along, minding your own business, and then stepping on a land mine,
over and over again.
If you’re overweight, you know what we’re talking about, and you know how
painful it is when someone catches you off guard with a nasty comment. In
defense, perhaps your guard is up all the time or you have some nasty come-
backs of your own. You know the toll this prejudice has taken on your own
self-esteem, and you know you’d do anything to prevent your child from
going through the same thing as an adult.
The fact is, she’s already experiencing weight prejudice, and it will only con-
tinue. Whereas your boss, for example, is very likely to have a zero-tolerance
policy for discrimination of any kind in the office (including weight discrimi-
nation, as lawsuits pop up all over the country), schools and the general
world of kids aren’t so well defined. You are your child’s first line of defense
and best source of information on the topic of weight discrimination; how
you react to inappropriate remarks or behavior — whether or not you instruct
her to follow your lead — speaks volumes about how you view yourself, your
child, and the people you come into contact with. Make sure you’re sending
her the right message — namely, that it’s not acceptable to judge anyone
based on their weight.
Recognizing discrimination in the doctor’s office
Many pediatricians (and heck, plenty of internists and other physicians who
primarily treat adults) have come to view obesity as the health crisis that it
is; they’re compassionate and kind when discussing the issue of weight with
their patients. However, some old-school doctors (which doesn’t necessarily
mean that they fall into an advanced age bracket) view overweight patients
with contempt and believe that shaming the patient is the best way to get
him or her to lose weight. If you’ve encountered this type of doctor, your
blood is probably boiling right now; if not, your hair may be standing on end
just imagining the damage this person could do to your child’s self-esteem.
64
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

Because obese children are in a higher risk category for many illnesses
(which we discuss in Chapter 3), they need to be completely comfortable
speaking with their primary care doctors. Although the doctor should be
looking for certain conditions commonly seen in overweight children, if 
your child is reluctant to report symptoms because he doesn’t want another
lecture about his weight, some conditions could go undiagnosed, at least for
a time.
If your child is in elementary school, you probably hear every word that
passes between him and the doctor. If you have an overweight teen, you 
need to be more vigilant about knowing how that relationship is faring. Don’t
expect your child to tell you everything that’s said in the exam room, but do
try to get a general feel for how much he likes — or dislikes — his doctor.
And if you sense some tension in the doctor-patient relationship, find another
doctor.
Studies have shown that obese women tend to have higher death rates from
ovarian cancer than their thinner peers. One theory surrounding this finding
is that obese women are less likely to visit their doctors on a regular basis
because of medical fat discrimination. Ovarian cancer happens to be one ill-
ness that, if not detected early, is particularly lethal. The general gist of this
finding can be carried over to your child’s health: You don’t want illness to
get a stronghold in her, so make sure her doctor is thorough and compassion-
ate enough that your child doesn’t fear regular visits.
Accepting overweight people
One criticism we faced after deciding to write this book was that it could 
possibly perpetuate discrimination against obese children by suggesting that
they can slim down easily and should start immediately. We were told that we
should promote “fat acceptance” rather than tell parents how to help their
kids lose weight.
Honestly, we’re all for acceptance of every kind, and we couldn’t care less
about how much a person weighs or how well someone’s pants fit. Childhood
obesity isn’t an aesthetic issue for us; we’re primarily concerned with your
child’s physical and emotional health, and it’s a fact that overweight kids
tend to deal with a lot of adverse health and social issues. They certainly
aren’t alone — adolescence can be trying for thin kids, too — but obese chil-
dren are at much higher risk for certain diseases. Poor health and low self-
esteem can lead to major episodes of depression, anxiety, and isolation. It’s
bad enough that adults feel this way; it’s a downright shame that so many
kids experience adultlike illnesses and subsequent emotional roller coasters
in their formative years.
65
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

How Emotional Abuse Hurts Your Child
Emotional abuse is very serious; name-calling and social isolation can result
in lifelong feelings of unworthiness and self-doubt, even if an overweight
child goes on to lose a substantial amount of weight. The wounds that go 
the deepest are usually the ones no one else sees.
In this section, we talk about some of the consequences of emotional abuse
that overweight kids face; we also explore how missing out on some of the
normal rites of passage of childhood may affect them in the long run.
Isolation
Social isolation can be a perpetual state. The average obese kid has a hard
time breaking free of an “outcast” label, and it gets more difficult the older
the age group. Being on the outside of peer activities often leads to depres-
sion and general anxiety; for example, a kid may become fearful of leaving the
house, wondering who’s going to insult or ignore him on that particular day.
66
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 
Overweight and healthy?
Debate rages about whether people can be “fit
and fat” or whether it’s truly necessary to drop
down to a particular weight in order to be
healthy. Some kids will never be “thin,” no
matter how hard they try. Their body types and
genetic predispositions just have them pro-
grammed to be larger-than-average people.
Does this mean they shouldn’t even bother
trying, or can they remain heavy and just eat
low-fat foods for good health?
The research on this topic has shown that it’s
better to be heavy and physically active than to
be thin and lead a sedentary lifestyle. However,
because being overweight can lead to other
health problems, you should still consult your
child’s doctor and have her health evaluated.
Just because your older child is heavy, active,
and healthy doesn’t necessarily mean that your
younger child will have the same luck with her
health. Regardless of your child’s age, obesity
must be viewed as a risk factor in the develop-
ment of certain diseases.
The good thing about being active is that it’s
often a remedy for certain physical ailments.
The more your child moves, the better her
health is going to be for it. Exercise is also a
mood lifter. You’ve probably heard about how
exercising releases hormones called endor-
phins, which make you feel good. So being
active is great for the body and the mind, which,
in turn, can lead to your child’s increased self-
esteem and enthusiasm about continuing to
lead a healthy lifestyle.

Thanks to social isolation, self-esteem levels drop like a stone in the adolescent
years, when the opposite sex becomes the main reason many kids bother show-
ing up to school at all. Watching as her peers become involved in relation-
ships, make plans for the weekend, and discuss their prom dresses all the
while knowing that she won’t be asked to join in the fun can be emotionally
devastating for an obese teenager.
We don’t want to give you the idea that obese or overweight kids are the 
only children who deal with social isolation, because that’s just not true. The
point is that this kind of isolation can affect the course of your child’s entire
life. Some kids find their own way in time; they either lose weight or just
become more comfortable in their own skin and feel better about themselves.
Other kids never get over these lonely, sad years. They may quit school, end
up in dead-end jobs, and choose partners who treat them badly (because at
least he or she is there).
How a child fares through difficult times such as social isolation largely
depends on her support system at home. You need to be willing to talk,
listen, or just sit quietly with a child who feels left out. Just as important, do
what you can to help her feel better physically. The more successful she is at
sticking to a healthy lifestyle, the better she’s going to feel. This is true for
several reasons:
 Physical aches and pains, in addition to social problems, can lead to
depression. The more she moves, the better she’ll feel physically, which
may produce a great improvement in her outlook on life.
 The foods that are a large part of an unhealthy diet — sugar, in 
particular — can lead to mood swings and heighten feelings of 
anxiety and depression. Eating a more balanced diet should 
(eventually) help to balance out her mood.
 Exercise releases endorphins that put her in a good state of mind, at
least temporarily (and that’s a start).
 Sticking to a healthier lifestyle (regardless of weight loss) is an accom-
plishment in and of itself, and that’s a great self-esteem booster.
When she’s feeling good, it’s time to encourage her to find a social outlet. It
doesn’t need to involve school; if she has a particular interest (art, reading,
writing, animals, crafts — whatever), look for a group in your area with which
she can sharpen her skills and get to know other people her own age. Settling
into groups tends to be easier when everyone is gathered for the same
reason — at least they all have something in common and something to talk
about. And if she can learn to talk to people in a setting like this, her social
67
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

skills — and her self-esteem — will get a bit of a boost that just may make
things easier for her elsewhere.
Nose-diving grades
The emotional effects of being bullied — depression, anxiety, difficulty sleep-
ing, low self-esteem, and diminished self-confidence — can have a negative
impact on schoolwork. Anxiety, for example, often causes a child to worry
irrationally, which decreases his ability to concentrate on anything. In addi-
tion, anxiety is emotionally exhausting, and your child may have no energy
left over to devote to schoolwork after he’s spent an entire week worrying
about a tornado leveling your house (even though it’s December and there
hasn’t been a tornado in your town . . . ever).
Anxiety over social standing at school can produce exhaustion, as well. And
again, exhaustion leads to unfinished homework as well as an inability to 
concentrate. Grades start to slip when he doesn’t do his reading for English
class, and the teacher doesn’t hide her disappointment when he’s unable to
answer a simple question. His report card arrives at the house, and you’re
dismayed to see that although your child is very bright, he’s pulling Cs and
Ds and negative comments from teachers.
Here’s where the spiral that’s tough to break free from starts. The lower 
the grades go, the lower his self-confidence dips, and he actually begins to
believe that he is unintelligent and that he really isn’t capable of doing any
better. Studies have also shown that teachers may feed into (or buy into) the
perception that overweight kids are less intelligent than their peers, either by
calling on them less often in the classroom or by grading their papers more
harshly than those of thinner students.
In addition, obese children who are victimized by bullies are more apt to
feign illness in order to miss school (or, in the case of older kids, just skip
class without bothering to fake the sore throat). Of course, obese children
may have legitimate physical conditions (like asthma, for example) that keep
them out of school more often than their classmates. But missed days in the
classroom often translate into missed schoolwork and lower grades.
Teens who are suffering from anxiety, depression, and other emotional issues
stemming from obesity may benefit from speaking to a school psychologist or
therapist who’s trained in dealing with overeating issues (which are generally
grouped in with other eating disorders). Parents can help by remaining posi-
tive and supportive in the child’s quest for a healthier lifestyle.
68
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

Mirror, mirror . . . I hate what 
I see: Low self-esteem
Every kid, regardless of age, shape, size, or attitude (if you have teenagers,
you know what we mean), is lovable in some way. Each one has his or her
own special abilities and talents, and each child is a shining star in some 
way. That’s why it’s so heartbreaking to watch kids go through phases of 
self-doubt and low self-esteem. Typically, adolescents are the prime targets
for this kind of self-hatred, though more and more, younger children are expe-
riencing low self-esteem, too. It makes sense for the average teenager to go
through a period of finding out who they are (and who they aren’t) and com-
paring themselves with their peers, trying to see how they measure up (liter-
ally and figuratively). With teenagers’ raging hormones and changing bodies,
this attitude shift comes as no surprise to parents, who remember their own
days of gazing in the mirror and crying about what they saw.
Obese children sometimes fall into a special category of people with ultralow
self-esteem. Given the emotions and physical effects of being an overweight
youngster, it’s difficult to imagine how scary life must be at times for an
obese child, especially when diminished self-confidence is added to a 
serious weight-related illness, like diabetes.
How low self-esteem can make weight problems worse
For children who suffer from self-loathing (including those who aren’t obese),
every day looks bleak. They feel ostracized from their peers, they often feel
physically unwell, and they honestly can’t see a bright light at the end of the
tunnel, even though you know that leading a healthier lifestyle will lead to
better days. Kids are often unable to visualize where they’ll be in a year; to
them, that’s an eternity.
Aside from being a dark cloud from which a child is unable to escape, low self-
esteem can often make a weight problem even worse. When your daughter is
feeling sad all the time, she may turn to comfort foods to see her through.
Because weight loss takes a significant effort and a lot of time to produce 
visible results, she may also feel as though she has nothing to lose by eating
more and nothing to gain by tossing out her favorite foods. And then when
she overeats, she feels even worse about herself for not being able to break
the unhealthy habit.
This kind of despair sometimes leads obese teens to risky behaviors, like
drinking and smoking. Drinking, obviously, is a means of escape and of 
numbing those feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness. Smoking, on the
other hand, is often rumored among teens to be a great way to lose weight.
69
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

(The argument goes something like, “Pop that cigarette in your mouth
instead of food, and you’re all set.” Note how the risks of heart disease 
and cancer don’t enter the conversation.)
Plenty of people actually have lost weight by becoming smokers, but it obvi-
ously isn’t the best plan of action. You’re trying to teach your child about
making healthy choices that will see her through the rest of her life, so don’t
turn a blind eye to her new nicotine habit. A teen may mistakenly believe that
losing weight by smoking is actually healthier than being obese. Educate her
on the health risks associated with smoking, and don’t accept it as a weight-
loss measure.
Family matters
You may think that the increase in the rate of obese children and teens
during just the last ten years would result in overweight kids being accepted
for who they are, and as a result, obese kids wouldn’t feel badly about their
bodies. Unfortunately, even though the percentages of obese adults and chil-
dren have risen dramatically, being obese is still grounds for becoming a
social pariah. Other kids are cruel, and even teachers aren’t always above
being judgmental.
Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the self-esteem of obese
children and determine whether lowered self-esteem among these kids is
truly the result of being overweight or if it’s just a natural phase of matura-
tion. Researchers have found that children who had unconditional support at
home were happier than other obese kids. Not surprisingly, kids whose fami-
lies picked on them for being obese had the lowest levels of self-esteem. If a
child is the subject of taunts and teasing at school because of his weight and
he comes home to hear more of the same from the people who are supposed
to love him, he’s going to feel as though he has no one to turn to. That’s despair,
and that’s just what a child with a weight problem doesn’t need. Your child is
more likely to adapt to a healthy lifestyle if he feels as though he has your
support instead of fearing that he’s going to disappoint you.
Make your house a safe haven for your child. No one is allowed to tease him
about his weight, and no negative comments about his size are permitted.
Every kid, regardless of weight, needs to be able to come home and just relax
without fearing ridicule from family members.
Make it clear to your child that you’re not going to judge; you’re only there to
help. Studies have shown that children who have a hand in developing a plan
for a healthy lifestyle have higher self-esteem than kids whose parents put
them on regimented eating plans. Obviously, age plays a big part in how
much a child is capable of caring for himself, but the older the child, the
more leeway you should allow him. Supervise, and don’t step in unless you
70
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

see some obvious errors in judgment (if, for example, your child plans a
“healthy” breakfast menu that consists of sausage, bacon, and a bagel with
cream cheese).
Resist the urge to do everything for your child, and instead teach him how to
make himself healthier. You can do this by:
 Allowing him to have some input on the grocery list
 Encouraging him to help you prepare healthy meals
 Letting him choose the physical activities he’s most interested in
 Not punishing him for the occasional slip-up
We talk more about making healthy food and cooking choices in Chapters 8
and 9, respectively, and about choosing fun physical activities in Chapter 10.
Backsliding and resisting the urge to punish your child are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 13.
Sibling versus Sibling
Most of the research done on childhood obesity shows that children who are
significantly overweight most often come from families in which the parents
are also overweight due to genetic and/or environmental factors (that is to
say, the parents are either predisposed towards obesity, or their lifestyles
have contributed to their weight problems, or both). As a result, it’s not
unusual for all the children in one family to have weight problems.
However, plenty of families exist in which only one child is heavy and the
others are thin. And especially in this day and age of mixed families, you may
have a couple of thin kids living with a set of thin parents, and an overweight
half or step sibling who follows the genetic code of a parent living elsewhere.
How can a parent deal with the weight problem of one child while keeping
peace in the home?
All’s fair in health at home
Many parents struggle with instituting a healthy lifestyle in the home if only
one child is overweight. They feel as though it isn’t fair to the other kids to
deny them their favorite foods and treats, cut down on television-viewing
time, and insist that everyone get outdoors and partake in some kind of 
physical activity just to accommodate the child who’s obese.
71
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

If you’re struggling with how all the kids in your house are affected by a
healthy lifestyle, you have to restructure your way of thinking. An unhealthy
lifestyle, which includes being sedentary and consuming too much fat, is
unhealthy whether or not someone gains weight because of it.
Your thin child may appear to be perfectly fine and healthy, but if she’s not
eating foods that are high in essential nutrients, she may not be as healthy 
as you think. All children need to eat healthy foods and exercise in order to
achieve their optimum levels of health. So it shouldn’t come down to an issue
of who’s being forced to give up junk food and get outside to play because of
whom — your entire family should be onboard for health reasons.
Still not convinced? You’re thinking that you can still buy the treats for your
skinny kids and just hide them from your overweight child? Don’t do it! First
of all, you only make your obese child feel like an outcast because everyone
else can eat junk except for him. Even if you’re supportive in every other way,
making this type of differentiation between kids can have lasting and pro-
found effects on the way your obese child views his place in the family. He
may come to think of himself as “the fat one” or “the one with a problem.”
Second, kids are kids. Imagine someone telling you that you can’t eat your
very favorite food anymore but everyone else in the house can. And because
heaven knows you can’t control yourself — there’s one more blow to your
child’s self-esteem — the food is hidden from you. You know exactly what
you’re going to do: Hunt high and low for that treat until you find it, even if it
means facing the disappointment of the family when they discover what
you’ve done (yet another strike to your child’s self-esteem).
When you go grocery shopping, assume that whatever you bring home is fair
game for everyone in the household to eat. If it’s not healthy, leave it right
where it is — on the shelf.
Encouraging peace, love, and 
understanding at home
Children need to know that home is where they can be themselves without
fear of cruel taunts and humiliation. Siblings are capable of being both best
friends and worst enemies (sometimes going from one extreme to another in
the span of two minutes!). No matter what the relationship is between your
kids, teach them that cruel words hurt and that unkind exchanges in the
home can be especially devastating, even if the person who’s being made 
fun of doesn’t show any emotion.
72
Part I: Understanding Childhood Obsesity 

Because home is supposed to be the place where everyone lets their hair
down, family is the first group setting in which people explore who they are;
and no matter how old they get, they always fall into the same roles they
played as children. The oldest child is often the boss of everyone else, and
the youngest is sometimes viewed as the “flake,” no matter what she achieves
later in life. People are molded by how their families treat them in their early
years.
The sibling who has been made to feel different — ugly, stupid, or fat —
sometimes never forgives her siblings for casting her in that role. Obese chil-
dren suffer enough at the hands of other kids; to come home and know that
her own family sees her in the same light is incredibly hurtful. The child has
no place where she can just be herself and feel unconditional love, and then
the weight becomes even more of an issue because it prevents her from fit-
ting in anywhere.
Should you force your children to love and respect one another and say only
kind things when they speak to each other? (If you’re laughing so hard at
imagining that scene that you can barely see the words in front of you . . . we
are, too.) We know that you can’t make kids like their siblings. But you can
enforce a no-nastiness rule in your house. It’s no easy task, but you need to
lay down the following laws:
 No one is allowed to call names based on physical characteristics or
character traits (this includes monikers like “Elephant Ears,” “Big Nose,”
and “Failure,” as well as fat-inspired names).
 Privileges (or favorite toys) will be removed, one at a time and one for
each offense, if you hear mean names being tossed back and forth. The
privileges can be earned back when you start seeing respectful behavior.
Be prepared for your kids to break the rules, and be prepared to act when
that happens. Also, don’t be surprised when they’re quite angry with you
when you take away video games and computer privileges. But stick to your
guns or the situation will never improve.
You have to follow the rules, too. You may call your forgetful child an “air-
head” on a regular basis without even realizing it. Your kids will be more than
happy to call you out on this behavior, so watch your own tongue.
If the kids are able to break away from name-calling, consider it a job well
done. Don’t go pushing for more just yet. Some siblings are just so different
from each other that they really don’t have a lot to talk about; however,
enforcing the rules of respect eliminates a lot of potential problems, and 
you may find that, in time, the kids are willing to be civil to one another . . .
and maybe even spend some time together of their own free will.
73
Chapter 4: Hurting from the Inside Out

Sibling cruelty in social settings is especially devastating, so establish a firm
rule forbidding this behavior, as well. The humiliation a child feels when his
sister calls him a name on the school bus or encourages another child to do
her dirty work (because she knows she’ll lose computer time if she opens her
mouth), for example, is unparalleled by any other feelings of shame in the
universe. When an obese child’s own family tears him to shreds in front of
other people, other kids get a tacit green light to follow suit.

Chapter 5
Assessing Your Child’s Health
In This Chapter
 Determining your own biases concerning your child’s weight
 Consulting with the pediatrician
 Diagnosing obesity with charts and other tests
H
ow can you tell if your child is truly obese or merely overweight? One
of the most remarkable things about the childhood obesity epidemic is
that parents often don’t recognize obesity in their own children. Regardless
of the reason, the end result is usually the same: The child’s weight goes
unacknowledged as a serious health threat, and the condition worsens and
worsens until the child starts developing secondary problems, such as
asthma or diabetes. By that time, the child’s health is in jeopardy, and 
parents feel as though they should have done something sooner.
Because obesity tends to be a household problem, parents of obese children
tend to have weight problems themselves. If a parent has always struggled
with her own weight but has never had any weight-related health problems,
then it makes sense for her to look at her own heavy child and think, “He’s
just heavy like I was as a kid. My health was fine, and his will be, too.” How-
ever, so much more is known these days about the long-term effects of child-
hood obesity that clearing up any doubt or confusion about a child’s weight
before disease takes hold in his body is the smart thing to do. When he’s 25,
he should be looking to a bright future, not lamenting the years of weight gain
behind him that have left him with a lifetime of health problems.
Obesity has very specific criteria for diagnosis. In this chapter, we advise you
on spotting some signs of obesity, and we discuss many of the diagnosis cri-
teria so that you’re well informed when you take your child to visit his or her
doctor.

He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Child
Missing the signs of obesity in your child sounds like an impossibility. After
all, because obesity manifests itself in weight gain, you should be able to tell
without a doubt just by looking at your child whether he’s a little heavy or
has a serious weight issue that may threaten his health.
You’d think it would be easy. In reality, parents often overlook their child’s
obesity for several reasons:
 If the parents are overweight, they may not be able to accurately judge
their child’s size and may underestimate it.
 Parents often think that their child is simply carrying baby fat well into
his elementary school years.
 Adults tend to coo over fat babies, so a child who was plump in his first
years of life may continue to be viewed as an adorable chubby imp, even
when he’s clearly not a baby anymore.
 Excess weight is sometimes misinterpreted as a sign of strength, espe-
cially in boys. Fathers sometimes look at their obese sons and remark,
“That’s my linebacker!”
On the opposite end of the weight issue, some parents are worried sick 
that their normal-weight, pot-bellied toddlers and preschoolers are headed
for a lifetime of weight problems. So you need to know what’s normal and
what isn’t.
Recognizing the signs of obesity
You really can’t simply look at a heavy child and definitively say that she’s
obese, even though it may seem obvious to you. A child can have the follow-
ing symptoms, all of which are commonly seen in obese children, but techni-
cally be merely overweight:
 Excess weight gain
 Shortness of breath upon exertion
 Sedentary lifestyle
 Orthopedic aches and pains
 Skin eruptions
78
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

In contrast, obese children often develop secondary conditions that are
related to obesity, such as:
 Type 2 diabetes
 Metabolic syndrome
 Asthma
 Sleep apnea
 High blood pressure
 Delayed (boys) or early (girls) puberty
All these conditions are discussed in Chapter 3.
If your child has been diagnosed with one or more of the conditions listed
and is markedly overweight, there’s a good chance that she’s obese, but only
a doctor can make that call. Doctors use specific charts as diagnostic tools for
childhood obesity. To help you better understand what the doctor is telling
you about your child’s weight, we break down this information in the section
“Weighing In: Diagnosing Obesity” later in this chapter.
Talking to your child’s doctor
At what point should you be concerned enough to discuss your child’s
weight with his doctor? If your child sees his pediatrician for regular check-
ups, the doctor will alert you to any potential weight issues that your child is
facing. If you’re concerned about your child’s weight, make an appointment
with your child’s doctor for a physical exam. Medical conditions other than
obesity can cause weight gain, so play it safe, especially if the weight appears
quite suddenly rather than gradually over a period of time.
If you’re hearing from the doctor that your child’s weight is cause for con-
cern, take that warning seriously! Even in the face of a serious warning from 
a pediatrician, many parents simply don’t believe that their child is obese.
Chapter 3 talks about the physical ailments that are commonly caused by
obesity; Chapter 4 discusses the emotional pain that obese children often
suffer. Both can cause serious, long-term distress for a significantly over-
weight child, so the sooner you acknowledge the problem and start working
to correct it, the better off your child (and your entire family) will be.
A child who has a weight issue needs to have a doctor that he’s comfortable
talking with. Obesity can cause some very serious health issues, and an
obese child may end up spending a significant amount of time in the doctor’s
office. If your current pediatrician loves to lecture your child on his weight
79
Chapter 5: Assessing Your Child’s Health

and you can see your child’s discomfort whenever the topic comes up, it may
be in everyone’s best interest to find a more compassionate doc.
Weighing In: Diagnosing Obesity
There’s no way to merely look at a child and determine whether he’s obese.
Doctors use specific diagnostic criteria to determine how serious a child’s
weight problem is and the likelihood of the child developing (or already
having) weight-related health issues. Because it’s always best to nip prob-
lems in the bud before they spiral out of control (health issues like diabetes,
in particular, can be very difficult to manage), play it safe and let your child’s
doctor evaluate his weight.
If the doctor determines that your child isn’t obese but merely overweight, he
may recommend putting some preventive measures against obesity into prac-
tice in your home, such as a healthier diet and increased physical activity.
Differentiating between baby 
fat and a true weight issue
If your child is taller and larger than his peers or has a round, chubby face, it
can be really tough to say whether that’s his natural, healthy state of being or
an indicator that he may be on the heavy side. It’s a call for your pediatrician
to make, using height and weight charts as his main diagnostic tools.
Babies are hardly ever diagnosed with weight problems, and they’re never put
on calorie-restricting diets. The same is true of toddlers. Small children need
to eat enough calories to ensure proper development; a healthy diet provides
enough calories for kids to grow at an appropriate rate. One exception: For
kids under the age of 2, doctors usually recommend whole milk because it
aids in development of the nervous system.
Understanding family history 
and other factors
When assessing your child’s weight, one thing that a doctor takes into con-
sideration is any factors that may predispose your child to becoming obese.
These factors may include:
80
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 Family history: A child who has at least one obese parent is more likely
to become obese.
 Race: African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics have a higher
rate of obesity. Approximately one-quarter of the children from each of
these minority groups are obese.
 Lifestyle: A sedentary lifestyle coupled with a high-fat diet is a recipe for
obesity.
Obviously, family history and ethnicity can’t be changed. However, lifestyle
factors are usually very malleable if at least one parent is willing to jump in
and contribute to making significant changes in the child’s diet and activity
level. When a doctor talks to you about making changes to your child’s
lifestyle, you need to already be in the mindset that your entire family 
will be taking part in a healthier way of life.
Evaluating height and weight
Doctors diagnose obesity by using a BMI (body mass index) chart, which we
talk about in detail in the next section. In order to use the BMI, the doctor has
to evaluate your child’s height and weight in relation to children who are the
same age as him. He makes this comparison by using a height and weight
chart. There are several different height and weight charts; one is used for chil-
dren from birth to 36 months, and another is used for kids from ages 2 to 20.
Also, each chart is gender specific. Figure 5-1 shows a sample chart for boys.
When your child enters the pediatrician’s office, he’s weighed and his height is
measured. These measurements are plotted vertically on the height and weight
chart (age is plotted horizontally). The doctor gives you a report along the
lines of, “Your child is in the 60th percentile for height and the 95th percentile
for weight.” What this means, simply, is that your child is taller than roughly 60
percent of kids his age and weighs more than 95 percent of those same kids.
Understanding body mass index 
(BMI) and children
When diagnosing obesity, the doctor takes the three components of the
height and weight charts (see the preceding section) and plugs them into a
formula for assessing BMI. The formula, in English measurements, is:
[Weight (lb) ÷ Height (in) ÷ Height (in)] × 703

Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Here’s an example of how to use the BMI formula to figure out a child’s BMI.
Suppose a girl is 8 years old; 4 feet, 6 inches tall; and weighs 100 pounds.
Plugging those numbers into the formula above tells you that this child’s BMI
is roughly 24.1. Simply calculating this child’s BMI doesn’t give an accurate
indication of obesity, though. Because children are still growing, doctors use
a special table for assessing their BMI scores that produces the BMI-for-age
score (see Figure 5-2).
Plotting this child’s age and her BMI number on the chart in Figure 5-2 shows
that she’s above the 95th BMI percentile for her age. But what does that
mean, exactly?
If you’re familiar with adult BMI tables, you know that obesity isn’t a concern
until someone reaches a BMI of 30 or more. However, evaluating BMI for chil-
dren is different in that it takes into account the child’s age, gender, and rate
of growth. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) breaks down the criteria for
overweight children as follows:
 A child with a BMI-for-age greater than the 95th percentile is considered
overweight.
 A child with a BMI-for-age in the 85th to 95th percentile is considered at
risk for becoming overweight.
 A child with a BMI-for-age less than the 5th percentile is considered
underweight.
Note that these ranges don’t use the word “obese.” The American Obesity
Association (www.obesity.org), however, doesn’t shy away from the term;
it considers a child with an 85th percentile BMI-for-age overweight and a
child with a 95th percentile reading obese.
The risk for obesity-related health issues increases along with BMI-for-age
readings. Recent studies have shown that more than 50 percent of kids with a
BMI-for-age over the 95th percentile had at least one obesity-related health
issue, like diabetes or sleep apnea.
Along with these readings, your child’s pediatrician can give you a healthy
weight range for your child’s age, height, and gender. Sometimes, the differ-
ence between their child’s current weight and their ideal weight is what truly
shocks parents into facing the magnitude of their child’s weight problem.

Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Although BMI charts give a fairly accurate reading of how overweight a child
may be, they aren’t perfect, especially where adults are concerned. A profes-
sional weight lifter, for example, can meet the BMI criteria for being over-
weight even though his extra weight is pure muscle. We talk about other 
ways to diagnose body fat in the following section.
Going beyond BMI to diagnose obesity
If you’ve ever been faced with weight-related medical tests, you know that
several other procedures give more accurate readings of body fat than a BMI
chart does. If an obviously overweight child scores a high BMI-for-age read-
ing, a doctor will assume that the extra weight comes from body fat and not
muscle. Despite its limitations, BMI is by far the most common method of
diagnosing childhood obesity because it’s quick, easy, cheap, and fairly 
accurate.
Other tests that can be used for diagnosing obesity include:
 Hydrostatic water test: A person is submerged in water and weighed.
 Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA): One X-ray with two energy
levels scans the entire body and gives a reading of the amount of body
fat. This test is commonly used to assess bone density.
 Bioelectrical impedence (BIA): An electrical impulse is sent throughout
the body to assess the amount of water contained in the body. A higher
amount of water generally translates into more lean tissue.
 Calipers: A trained professional uses this instrument consisting of two
moveable, curved legs fastened at one end to assess skin-fold thickness
at various points of the body. Calipers give an accurate reading when
used correctly; unfortunately, they’re often used incorrectly.
If these tests are performed, they’re usually done on adults. The hydrostatic
water test and DEXA are both costly tests to perform and aren’t widely avail-
able. BIA and calipers are both used in some health clubs but usually aren’t
seen in a pediatrician’s office. Doctors can easily make obesity diagnoses by
putting together their observations of children and their BMI-for-age read-
ings, so those are the criteria pediatricians usually rely on and consider 
when recommending options for correcting the condition.
85
Chapter 5: Assessing Your Child’s Health

Discussing the family’s lifestyle
Your child’s pediatrician probably won’t stop at diagnosing your child with 
a weight problem and recommending that you do something about it. He’ll
want to get a good feel for your family’s lifestyle and for the factors that may
have contributed to your child’s weight gain. He may ask about your child’s:
 Diet: What types of food does your child typically eat over the course of
a day? Would you say that she eats a large amount of food?
 Eating habits: Does she sit in front of the TV and eat or take a bag of
chips up to her room before bed?
 Activity level: Does she enjoy getting outside with friends? Is she inter-
ested in sports?
 State of mind: Does she seem concerned or depressed over her weight?
 Physical well-being: Is she feeling well, generally speaking, or does she
complain of various ailments that may be related to her weight?
Be prepared to answer these types of inquiries — and be honest! The doctor
already knows that a child usually doesn’t become obese in the absence of
unhealthy lifestyle factors. In other words, there’s no use trying to sugarcoat
your answers, so to speak. The more forthcoming you are about your family’s
lifestyle, the better equipped the physician will be to help your child.
86
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes One at a Time 
Waisting your child’s time?
For overweight adults, the risk for conditions
like heart disease and diabetes is thought to
increase with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a mea-
surement calculated by dividing the waist cir-
cumference by the hip circumference. Men
with a WHR of 0.9 or lower and women with a
WHR of 0.8 or lower are considered to be in the
safe zone; adults with a WHR of 1.0 or higher
are in a high-risk category for developing
weight-related illnesses.
While WHR may be a worthwhile tool for
assessing an adult’s risk of illness, it’s not used
on obese children. Studies have shown that it
doesn’t accurately reflect a child’s level of
health; when a child reaches adolescence,
however, WHR is a more useful diagnostic tool.

Taking additional tests
The doctor may want to do a full physical exam to evaluate whether your
child is at risk for obesity-related health issues or if she may already be bat-
tling a condition or two. Some tests the doctor may recommend include:
 Blood screening: He may want to test your child’s insulin level to rule
out diabetes. He may also evaluate her cholesterol levels.
 Cardiac evaluation: Heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output
(how much blood the heart puts out per minute) tend to be elevated in
obese children, putting a greater strain on the heart, so all three may be
tested.
 Orthopedic evaluation: Obese children may have malformations in the
bones or ligament and muscle strains from carrying around excess
weight.
 Examination of the skin: Because overweight and obese children can
suffer from various skin eruptions (discussed in Chapter 3), the doctor
may recommend treating them as soon as possible so they don’t
worsen.

In This Chapter
 Exploring your own attitudes toward food and exercise
 Making easy changes for big results
 Convincing kids that weight loss is possible
P
arents often wonder if their child’s weight gain is due to an underlying
medical condition. Does the child have a glandular problem, for exam-
ple? Has his or her metabolism shut down for some reason? What else, these
parents reason, could possibly cause an otherwise healthy child to become
obese?
There very well may be some sort of genetic component that contributes to
weight gain, but in most cases, obesity in adults and children alike is due to
an unhealthy, inactive lifestyle. Although certain genetic factors may make
weight gain more likely, lack of exercise and a high-fat diet are two variables
that give a person an added push toward obesity. These habits are usually
passed on from one generation to the next so that overweight or obese chil-
dren grow up without knowing that there’s a different way of doing things,
that healthy foods and exercise are staples in many households.
Kids also pick up on their parents’ attitudes about food and weight. Your
child knows whether your relationship with food is a love/hate or love/love
situation, and what’s more, his own attitudes are shaped by what he sees and
hears at home. Getting to the bottom of those feelings concerning food can
reveal how unhealthy habits got established in the first place, which may be
an eye-opener for how to break those habits in the future.
Obviously, a child can’t learn healthy habits unless his parents teach him;
that’s where you come in. Even if you grew up in a house where unhealthy
habits were the order of the day, even if you’ve never led anything resembling a
healthy lifestyle, it’s not too late for you to turn things around if your intentions
are in the right place. A healthy lifestyle focuses on preventing weight-related

illness like diabetes and heart disease; it’s not about losing weight in order to
look like a model. Even though the initial changes to the family’s diet and activ-
ity levels can be made over a relatively short period of time, the results take
longer to show themselves. For that reason, it’s important for everyone to have
a realistic idea of what these healthy changes are all about and what they can
realistically expect from their efforts.
Recognizing How Your Own Actions 
and Attitudes Affect the Family
Before you can begin to help your child on her quest toward a healthier
future, you have to first be able to assess your own relationship with and 
attitudes toward food and physical activity. On the surface, it would seem as
though your eating habits and level of daily physical activity only affect one
person (yourself); however, that’s just not so. Parents are the ultimate role
models for their children, especially in the kids’ earliest, attitude-forming
years. The fact of the matter is, when a child develops a relationship with
food that goes way past basic nourishment, the end result is often an eating
disorder of some kind, either related to overeating or undereating.
Passing the buck . . . and your 
own attitudes about food
The relationship you have with food can be complex. You need food to sur-
vive, but you may love it, hate it, or feel indifferent toward it — or feel every
which way about it depending on the time of day, year, or the particular phase
of life you’re in at any given time. For example, when adults are experiencing
particularly stressful times, it’s not unusual for them to experience weight
loss or weight gain, which means that people often either eat more or far 
less than usual when they’re feeling pressured.
Emotions obviously come into play here, and they may affect the hunger 
cues you feel. Someone who’s horrifically depressed, for example, may not
feel hunger pangs at all and may actually forget to eat, resulting in weight
loss. By the same token, depression can make people feel more hungry 
than usual or turn to certain so-called comfort foods even when they 
aren’t hungry. Weight gain is often the end result here.
90
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

You needn’t be extremely depressed to have a relationship with food that’s
rather askew, although having an unhealthy relationship with food can cer-
tainly lead to depression. Depression is an extreme example of how the mind
can either turn people toward food or turn them away from it. This section
focuses on determining whether your own eating habits are born of genuine
hunger or whether you eat based on external factors (which is often the case
in families where obesity in an issue).
Obsessing over food
Food has become nothing short of an obsession; instead of depending on
food for survival, people have broken food down into so many subcategories
that it’s often the one thing the entire day revolves around. What did you eat
for breakfast? Who’s ordering lunch? Where are you going to eat dinner? Do
you have anything for dessert at home?
Just for comparison’s sake, think about how past generations viewed food. It
was a means to nourish tired bodies after they spent the day working in the
fields or factories. You can bet that the laborer who spent the day breaking
his back in a steel mill wasn’t really thinking about whether he was going to
have chocolate cake that evening; if he thought about food at all (and he
probably only gave it some thought when his stomach started rumbling), 
he thought that his next meal was the fuel he needed to keep him going.
That’s a relationship born of sheer necessity.
These days, most people have no worries about securing their next meal, 
nor do they work at physically demanding jobs that make food an essential
source of energy. They can stop off at the grocery store on the way home
from work or breeze into a restaurant and literally order someone to bring
heaping plates of food to them. While people still need food for nourishment,
it’s become something of a luxury, too. No one needs chocolate cake, for
example, in order to see them through the day.
Food is everywhere. Ads for fast food show up on TV and billboards, and you
can’t drive more than a mile in many areas without seeing a fast-food restau-
rant, and in urban areas, sit-down restaurants are everywhere. As a popula-
tion, we can’t seem to get enough food! And the statistics of overweight and
obese Americans (some 60 percent of adults in this country are at least over-
weight; 30 percent are obese) seem to bear this out.
Social eating
In addition to the ubiquitous ads and restaurants, many social functions
revolve around food. When was the last time you had a morning meeting
without coffee cake, bagels, or Danish? When was the last time you invited
91
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

someone over for a visit without setting out cookies or brownies? Maybe
your family has a tradition of a huge Sunday family gathering with a buffet
that looks like something straight off a cruise ship.
You’re thinking, “Of course we do this kind of thing. It’s tradition; it’s polite;
it’s simply what’s done.” Sure, it’s polite to feed people, but food doesn’t 
have to be the focal point of almost every gathering. That’s exactly how many
people end up becoming overweight in the first place. It’s engrained in your
mind that passing up a treat a host or hostess offers is impolite, so you prob-
ably end up eating everywhere you go. Unfortunately, when you get away
from eating three square meals a day, snacking your way through the morn-
ing, afternoon, and night is a piece of cake . . . er, as easy as pie . . . well, you
get the idea.
Emotional connections
For some people, a connection to food may start with depression or be
caused by depression — it’s kind of a chicken-or-the-egg–type scenario:
Where did this whole unhealthy relationship start? The end result is that
these people become dependent on food as a means of calming their nerves
and making them feel safe. Many obese people describe overeating as a way
of filling up an emotional emptiness they feel, but the sense of serenity is only
temporary. Overeaters often feel regret over their unhealthy eating patterns,
and that regret is only exacerbated by the depression they feel over their
weight.
92
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 
Is food an addiction?
Is it possible to be addicted to something we
need for survival? Isn’t that a slight exaggera-
tion? No, it’s not. It’s one thing to think about
food, prepare a menu for the week, or even look
forward to a favorite meal. It’s quite another to
plan your entire day around food and think
about it almost constantly. Food addiction is
thought to have a biological component — that
is, the body craves certain elements or com-
pounds contained in particular foods. In
Chapter 7, we discuss the theory that fast food
has some rather addictive components, such
as caffeine and sugar; that same theory is the
basis for food addiction, except that it extends
to include all sorts of foods and the feeling of
being completely out of control where food is
concerned.
According to this theory, food addiction is every
bit as real as a chemical dependence on drugs
or alcohol. Cutting back on certain foods may
result in withdrawal symptoms, such as irri-
tability or a general sense of malaise. Like other
addictions, help is available for people who feel
as though they can’t kick their unhealthy eating
habits on their own. A therapist who’s experi-
enced in treating eating disorders may employ
cognitive or behavioral therapy in order to help
someone with this disorder.

The cycle goes on: Depression may cause withdrawal from social contacts
(often because obese people fear rejection or are embarrassed by their size,
or both), and isolation makes food all the more attractive. Food can’t reject
overtures of friendship, and food sticks around for as long as one needs it to
be there. The immediate satisfaction food gives seems irreplaceable. It’s not
unlike a smoker’s addiction to nicotine — the smoker knows smoking’s an
unhealthy habit with serious health consequences, but the body (along with
the mind) has this uncontrollable craving for another cigarette.
Giving kids the wrong idea
You may think that issues like social eating and depression apply only to
adults, but they affect kids in several ways:
 Kids take in everything and look to their parents as examples. If your
child watches one or both parents eat throughout the course of the day
(in addition to or in place of regular meals), he’ll follow suit. A small
child in particular doesn’t know the first thing about healthy and
unhealthy habits. He assumes that whatever his parents do is right;
thus, if you snack on a package of cookies to pass time in front of 
the TV, he’ll follow your example.
 Households rarely have more than one set of rules concerning food, so 
if you have unhealthy eating habits, it’s very unlikely that your child is
eating low-fat, low-sugar, high-fiber meals when he’s hungry.
 Ever hear that expression, “If mom’s not happy, no one’s happy”? Kids
feel their parents’ emotional pain. If you’re depressed, it’s affecting your
child in some way. He may feel distant from you, or he may even think
that he’s caused your sadness. If he sees that you’re “medicating” your-
self with food, he’s likely to use this form of comfort when he’s feeling
blue.
Some parents have the absolute best intentions and try desperately not to
pass their eating habits on to their children. However, leading by example is
the only method of truly breaking this cycle. In other words, you simply can’t
continue to eat a high-fat and/or high-sugar diet and expect your children to
accept their veggies and lean meats at mealtimes. We know that breaking life-
long (or at least long-term) habits is hard, but in order to instill in kids the
best ways to stay healthy, parents have to live a healthy lifestyle, too.
Studies have shown that obese children do far better in their long-term
weight loss goals if at least one of their parents is involved in creating a
healthier lifestyle in the home.
93
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

Analyzing what goes in your grocery cart
Because parents are almost entirely in control of the food that comes into the
home, they’re also in charge of overhauling the family’s eating habits. You can
assume that anything that you buy is fair game for the entire family, so don’t
buy candy for your spouse if your child’s trying so hard to eat healthier
foods; it’s a temptation that’s best left in the store.
Some items that have no place in a home that’s undergoing a health
makeover include:
 Fried foods: Fresh or frozen, they’re high in fat and don’t belong in your
fridge or freezer.
 Most convenience foods: Pay attention to food labels (see Chapter 8) so
that you don’t bring home almost-prepared foods that are high in sugar
and/or saturated fats.
 Sugary treats: Part of this whole healthier-living process is discovering
how to enjoy foods in their most natural states. An apple is a good
dessert, for example, because it’s low in fat and naturally sweet. Eating
lots of refined sugar can make fruit taste sugarless, by contrast, and
that’s not the direction you want to go in.
 Refined carbohydrates: When the natural fiber is stripped from flour,
the body has a tough time metabolizing it. Whole grains are best; they’re
high in fiber (which is very filling) and nutrients.
 High-fat dairy: Whole milk, whole-milk cheeses, ice cream, and 
whipped cream are all high in fat. Buy skim milk and low-fat counter-
parts as alternatives.
 High-fat condiments: Mayonnaise, salad dressings, and tartar sauce can
all catapult otherwise low-fat meals into the fat stratosphere. Use vine-
gar, olive oil, or lemon instead.
 Processed meats: Pepperoni and sausages are usually high in fat. Read
those nutrition labels on meat products and look for lower-fat versions
of these foods.
Many juices, popsicles, cereals, and yogurts — all favorites of the typical
American child — fall into one or more of the categories listed above.
If you’re thinking that we’ve pretty much wiped out your grocery list, you
may be wondering what we expect you to feed your family. Low-fat, low-sugar
foods, of course. Foods that are in as natural a state as possible (like fruits,
veggies, and whole grains) come power-packed with vitamins and minerals
94
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

and also fill up the stomach so that your child will be far less hungry, say, an
hour after eating an apple than she would be an hour after eating a candy bar.

Chapter 8.
You may have a hard time making the switch from buying the kinds of foods
that your family has enjoyed for so many years to buying healthy foods only.
(Fortunately, in practice, it’s very easy these days to find low-fat alternatives
in almost every grocery store in this country!) To make the transition as
quick and painless as possible, pick a day to clean out the pantry and fridge,
tossing the last vestiges of unhealthy foods. Don’t keep one bag of chips
around for an “emergency.” If it’s in the house, somebody’s going to find it
and eat it. If unhealthy snacks are nowhere to be found, truly hungry family
members have to settle for a low-fat alternative. And if they’re looking for
snacks because they’re bored . . . well, sometimes going to the pantry and
discovering their favorite treats aren’t there is just the thing that breaks kids
(and adults) of unnecessary snacking habits.
No life-threatening event will ever be solved by tearing open a bag of fried
potato slices; if that were possible, emergency rooms would keep chips under
lock and key. The worst that’s going to happen when the treats are gone is
that the family will express their displeasure. They’ll live through that kind 
of disappointment — without an emergency chip infusion.
Curing your exercise allergies
Eating healthier foods is only one part of instituting an overall healthier
lifestyle in your home. Setting an example of physical activity is the other
essential part of this equation. For parents who loathe and despise exercise,
this can be a bit of a sticking point: They’re willing to encourage their chil-
dren to become more active, but they aren’t quite willing to get involved in
exercise themselves. Why should they, they wonder? They work all day;
they’re exhausted; they have no energy or desire to become super-fit, so
what’s the point?
Recall that children pick up on their parents’ attitudes. Your child no doubt
already knows how you feel about physical activity, especially if you’ve dropped
comments like these in the past:
 “I’m allergic to exercise.”
 “Exercise makes me cranky.”
 “It’s impossible for me to exercise.”
95
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

Of course, there are some people for whom exercise may actually be impossi-
ble. However, many people who claim that they can’t exercise usually have
the wrong idea of what exercise is all about. A significantly overweight
woman who has led a sedentary lifestyle for the past ten years may not be
able to run a mile, but she can take a walk. Perhaps she could ride a bike or
even do some water aerobics. Barring any true physical debilitation diag-
nosed by a doctor, overweight people can find some form of low-impact activ-
ity to help them on their way to a healthier lifestyle. (And to date, no one has
been diagnosed with an actual case of an “exercise allergy.”)
Is getting active going to be easy? No. But the fact that becoming more active
isn’t easy when you’re overweight yourself sends a very powerful message to
your child: This is hard work. I didn’t particularly want to do this, but it’s impor-
tant enough to my health that I am doing it. And if I can do it, so can you.
Exercise doesn’t always result in a person becoming ultrathin or super-fit,
but it almost always leads to better health, especially in people who have
high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels (two conditions that are
fairly common in overweight adults and kids).
Adults should check with their doctors before beginning exercise programs,
just to rule out any potential problems. Even adults who are in a healthy
weight range should heed this advice because health issues can occasionally
pop up seemingly out of nowhere.
When your child sees that you’re making a concerted effort to exercise in
order to improve your health, he’s going to think that this is the right way 
to live, simply because it’s what you’re teaching him through your actions.
Keep in mind that kids don’t exercise in the same way adults do; they play.
Encourage him, and help him find an activity or two that he enjoys and that
he can participate in on a regular basis (at least four to five times a week).
The more fun his physical activity is, the more likely he is to think of it as
playtime and not as some sort of torture. You can find tips for helping your
child in this regard in Chapter 10.
Weighty judgments
The ways in which parents judge others by their weight influence how kids
view the world. If you’re overweight, you no doubt already know that a fat
prejudice is unfortunately alive and (un)well in this country. But ask yourself
this: Do you judge thin people based on their appearance? Be honest. When a
thin model or actress is on TV shilling for a car manufacturer or a cosmetics
96
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

company, do you find yourself thinking (or saying) things like, “She’s so
stupid” or, “She’s not even talented; they just hired her because she’s thin”
or, “Why doesn’t she eat something once in a while?”
Judging people based on their appearances isn’t right, and many times, 
those judgments end up being inaccurate, but it’s human nature to draw 
certain conclusions between a person’s personality and his or her appear-
ance. Whereas overweight people are often judged to be lazy, dumb, and
unhygienic, very thin people are sometimes judged to be vain, egotistical,
and unhealthy.
When you say things like, “She’s so skinny, I hate her!” or, “She’s so thin, she
looks like a cadaver,” you’re teaching your child to judge a person based on
how he or she looks. You may also unwittingly pass along the idea that thin
people are bad people. This kind of blanket judgment can affect your child’s
relationship with other people. If a thin classmate approaches your daughter
and her first reaction is, “She’s thin, so she’s probably mean,” where do you
think that relationship is going?
On the flip side, if you’re one to go on and on about how you wish you were
as skinny as so-and-so, if you’re always talking about weight (yours and other
people’s) and looking at life from a perspective of weight loss or weight gain,
you’re essentially telling your child that the only thing that matters is weight
and appearance. For example, comments like these are not at all unusual:
 “I saw my cousin last night. She gained 20 pounds! Oh, and she won
some big award at work, but you should see how heavy she is!”
 “My sister lost her job and her husband left her. She was so depressed
that she lost 20 pounds. At least she looks really great.”
These very realistic comments are examples of how many people think 
that weight loss cures everything and weight gain diminishes achievements.
These aren’t the kinds of messages that children should be learning. And
although you can’t do a whole lot about the advertisements that your kids
are exposed to on a regular basis or the things they hear at school, you can
make sure you’re communicating healthy messages about weight at home.
And what are those messages?
 Weight isn’t the ultimate issue; health is.
 People come in all different shapes and sizes.
 A person’s appearance is not necessarily a reflection of his or her 
personality.
97
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

Maybe you were teased by thin kids when you were younger; maybe your
child has experienced the same kind of cruelty, and you both think you have
every right to dislike skinny people. Turn that thought around: What if an
overweight child teased you? Would that affect how you felt about all heavy
people? Probably not, especially if you’ve always been heavy yourself. People
tend to fear (or outright dislike) people who look different from themselves.
Remind your child (and yourself) that everyone is different and that you 
can’t group people and their personality traits together based on general
appearance.
Judging a book by its cover isn’t right, but how on earth do your feelings
about Ms. Model affect your child’s weight? Even if you have a kid who argues
with everything you say, your point of view on major issues comes through
loud and clear. For the most part, your views dig themselves into your child’s
very impressionable mind, and she’s very likely taking whatever you say and
turning those words into her very own feelings on any given issue. When you
berate skinny people, she may think to herself, “Who’d want to be thin?” If
you’re obsessed with becoming thin, however, she may worry that she’ll
never meet your ideals for body weight.
Little Changes, Big Long-Term Results
So what does overhauling your family’s lifestyle really entail? Do you have to
hire a personal chef, make room for a home gym, and bring a personal trainer
into the family fold? Wouldn’t it be easier to move everyone out to the wilder-
ness where you’d be forced to build your own log cabin and grow your own
food?
If you’ve been thinking about uprooting the family and leaving society behind
anyway, then by all means go right ahead. But if you’re looking to stay right
where you are, improve your family’s health, and not lay out a fortune in the
process, then we have great news for you: Big health benefits can come from
changes that are relatively easy to make. Cutting fat out of the family’s diet,
reducing calories and portion sizes, and finding ways to increase physical
activity are the main ways of improving health.
Cutting back on fat and calories
Theoretically, all you need to cut fat out of your family’s diet is some knowl-
edge about fat itself and the will to follow through on your best intentions.
Here are some tips for keeping fat to a minimum:
98
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 Learn to read food labels. Know the difference between saturated
(unhealthy) and unsaturated (acceptable in moderate amounts) fat.
 Buy foods in their most natural state whenever possible. Fruits, veg-
gies, and whole grains are all naturally low in fat and high in fiber.
 Look for low-fat alternatives. Don’t buy whole-milk products; choose
skim or fat free.
 Avoid fast food. Most of it is loaded with saturated fat.
 Check out school lunches. If you’re seeing a plethora of meals with high-
fat contents (or worse, there’s a fast-food vendor in your child’s cafete-
ria), pack your child’s lunch at home.
 Don’t let fat sneak in at snack or dessert time. You’re trying to teach
the family that healthy foods are best; don’t make an exception like,
“We’ll eat healthy all day long, but we’ll have pie for dessert.” You’ll 
be sending a mixed message.
These are ways to keep the fat out of your house; however, the best foods 
for weight loss pack the one-two wallop of being low in fat and sugar. Low-
fat foods can still have a high-sugar content, which can contribute to weight
gain. Sugar is high in calories, and calories that aren’t used for energy are
stored as fat. An obese child only needs 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day; to meet
that goal, low-sugar, low-fat foods are your child’s best bet. When you’re actu-
ally setting out to make low-fat meals, you can find more-specific cooking tips
in Chapter 9.
Making exercise a part of life
The family that plays together gets healthy together. Start changing your
family’s lifestyle to include healthier options by going on family outings.
Outings get everyone out the door and introduce exercise in the form of a 
fun activity that everyone can do — young, old, heavy, or thin. The outings
you plan (at least at first) should be based on what your family enjoys most.
Walking, swimming, hiking, biking — these are all good activities for families
who are just making their foray into the world of physical activity. Remember
to pack a healthy snack and water for everyone!
Although an activity should be fun for everyone, it should not be centered
around food! If the whole family wants to go bowling, for example, that’s 
certainly better than sitting home and watching TV. But if you end up with a
pizza, a pitcher of soda, and a basket of fries, that’s not good. For this reason,
heading to the great outdoors where the only food present is the low-fat fare
you’ve packed yourself is usually better.
99
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

Making exercise a regular part of everyone’s day takes effort. Start by limiting
the time your family spends in front of the TV, computer, and video game con-
sole. Electronics have become such a part of life that families often don’t real-
ize how much time they spend staring at those screens.
You can’t expect family members to spend every minute that they aren’t
watching TV exercising, but in order to get them doing anything active, you
have to lead by example. So cut back on your own TV viewing. Go outside
with them. Stock your garage and yard with fun games. Some toys that can
get your child playing outside include:
 Bike
 Rollerblades
 Basketball hoop
 Scooter
 Skateboard
 Jump rope
Make sure, of course, that you take safety into consideration by providing
helmets and adult supervision where applicable.
Younger children usually need a parent to get them outside and play with
them; older kids are more likely to want to play with kids their own age. You
can make a difference here by encouraging your child to invite active kids
over. (You know, some children love to play outside and others like to park it
in front of the TV all day long.) Getting your child to exercise and be active
will be much easier on you if he has a pal or two to play with outside. On the
other hand, allowing him to invite over a friend who refuses to do anything
even remotely active may be a big pain in the neck for you. You shouldn’t start
banning lifelong friends who are otherwise not objectionable little people; you
just have to make it clear that you have new limits on electronic playtime
when these friends visit.
Stick to your rules limiting TV watching and outdoor activity even when
friends are visiting. Your child needs to realize that there’s no going back and
that the healthier lifestyle rules are in effect no matter who comes into the
house.
Chapter 10 contains more advice for making exercise an enjoyable activity for
the entire family — rain or shine!

Yes, You Can!
Most cases of obesity are caused by overeating and underexercising. Flipping
unhealthy habits around are the keys to better health. There’s no magic pill
or hoops to jump through. Achieving weight loss and health goals is possible
for every family, regardless of how many times you’ve all tried without suc-
cess. Think of it as an opportunity to change the future.
If you and/or your child did well on a health-improvement program in the
past and then lost your focus and fell back into bad habits, that’s not failure!
It’s proof that you can do it. You just need to take it farther than you did the
last time and make those lifestyle changes permanent.
We’re not advocating what experts call “yo-yo dieting,” a pattern of weight
loss followed by weight gain, followed by weight loss, and so on. Over the
years, yo-yo dieting can take a toll on the body and lead to serious health
issues. It can also result in stubborn weight gain that doesn’t respond to
healthy lifestyle modifications.
Losing weight is possible!
But it takes determination, effort, and the right mindset. Changing your
family’s point of view about diet and exercise is essential in this whole
process. An obese child, for example, probably knows only one way of life —
the one he’s leading right now. When a kid has been raised with unhealthy
habits, he simply has no idea that there’s any other way of doing things. An
obese child may not realize, for example, that:
 Turning off the TV and video games adds a whole lot of playtime to 
the day.
 Eating dinner with the TV off gives everyone the opportunity to talk
about what happened at work or school.
 Playing outside is a terrific way to make new friends.
 Trying new activities teaches him a lot about himself and his abilities.
 Substituting low-fat, high-fiber foods for high-sugar, high-fat snacks
makes him feel fuller, longer.
 Making permanent lifestyle changes takes time, but the results are 
worth it!
101
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

Obviously, a child who’s never known a different way of life isn’t going to
make these realizations on his own. A healthier lifestyle starts with at least
one parent displaying a healthier outlook on life, one that starts with not
having any illusions about weight loss and how hard or easy it’s going to be.
Changes to the grocery list and activity level are, theoretically, not so difficult
to make. Leaving the cookies in the grocery store, opting for fruits and veg-
etables as snacks, learning to bake or broil foods instead of fry them, and
taking a walk several times a week are nothing compared to, say, cooking
gourmet meals with exotic ingredients and training for a marathon. We’re
talking about starting with little changes, which make all the difference in 
the world.
Losing heart with the whole healthier living process is common when a child
(or family) expects too much, too soon. Emphasize to everyone that this is a
slow, steady process, that these are permanent changes, and that there’s no
going back. You can help everyone stay committed by not wavering from
your stance and by showing your positive attitude. For example:
 Don’t give in to requests, pleas, or demands for high-fat and high-sugar
foods.
 Don’t allow TV to remain the focal point of every day.
 Don’t shame or yell at kids when they’re less than enthusiastic about a
healthy meal or playing outside.
 Do encourage family outings and outdoor playtime.
 Do experiment with healthy foods and new recipes.
 Do get the kids involved in the cooking.
 Do use positive reinforcement, such as complimenting your child on his
efforts and acknowledging his progress.
Successful weight loss is all about getting to the roots of the weight problem —
eating too many unhealthy foods and leading a sedentary lifestyle — and treat-
ing them like they’re weed roots. You can’t go halfway; you have to get rid of
them so that they can’t get a stranglehold on the family again!
Sticking with the changes
Making changes to your family’s lifestyle is a major accomplishment in and of
itself. If you’ve cleared the junk food out of the house, found some healthy
recipes to try out, and discovered ways to get the kids out the door and play-
ing in the yard, kudos to you. Those are major steps in the right direction.
102
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Hopefully, your family has been accepting of these changes. Depending on
their personalities, kids may be excited or . . . less than excited.
Helping kids see the long-term goals
Obviously, working with a child who wants to become healthier is much
easier than working with one who doesn’t; however, sometimes even children
who are eager to start a healthy living turnaround become less and less
excited as time goes on. Kids want immediate results, so if something isn’t
going to happen in a short period of time, they may have serious doubts
about whether it will happen at all. Depending on age, a child honestly may
not have the ability to rationally say to herself, “If I just stick with it, I’ll feel
so much healthier three months from now.” Three months is a long, long way
off as far as she’s concerned.
If your child’s losing interest in the healthy living plan, find ways to point 
out how major things take time. Remind her of the seasons, for example, and
how, in the dead of winter, it seems as though it will never be spring. When
it’s freezing outside, it’s hard to believe that the cold will eventually disap-
pear and everyone will be outside running around in shorts. And yet spring
does show up every year. Change just takes time.
Teens are a different story. They have a better handle on the passage of time;
however, they also often want instant gratification. Your teen may benefit
more from keeping a weight-loss journal that provides a visual aid of her
progress. As often as she needs to, she can refer to the journal and see that
she’s indeed making progress. Perhaps the weight loss is slow-going (for best
results, it should be), but as long as she can see that her efforts are paying
off, she’s more likely to remain strong in the face of boredom or frustration
with the new lifestyle.
Dealing with resistance
Convincing a kid to make healthy changes is a little different when she’s
opposed to any changes in her way of life. Can you drag her outside and
make her play with you? If she’s small enough, yes, you can (as long as you’re
pleasant about it); a younger child is dependent on you to lead the way, and
because you’re still the boss of this child (no matter what she may say or
think), you absolutely can plan outings with and for her. Heck, that’s your
responsibility.
A teen who’s resistant to change is another matter, however. Because older
kids can be notoriously defiant and rebellious, you don’t want to push her
too much or you may make matters worse. You don’t want to create a battle-
ground over her weight issue or she may very well continue to overeat just to
spite you and show you that she’s in control of her body. Instead, she needs
103
Chapter 6: Overhauling the Family’s Lifestyle

to be the one to take the initiative. You’re playing a supporting role, so the
best thing you can do for a teen in this situation is lead by example. Keep the
junk foods out of the house, and live your own healthy lifestyle. When she’s
ready, she’ll come around, and if she sees that you actually know what you’re
talking about (having changed your own unhealthy habits), she’ll be that
much more interested in what you have to say. For more on this topic, 
check out Chapter 13.

nitiating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in your home begins with
knowing something about nutrition. Nutrients give everyone in the house
a boost and make them feel well enough to begin participating in physical
activities, a vital part of weight loss and healthy living.
Aside from helping one gear up for physical outings, nutrition plays an impor-
tant part in the day of a growing child. Many studies have shown that kids
who skip breakfast don’t perform as well in school as their pals who take the
time to eat in the morning. Kids need
 Calcium for developing bones and teeth
 Vitamins and minerals in order to grow well
 Good hydration to keep their organs in tiptop shape
 Protein for muscle development
In addition to eating a healthy diet, children need to learn how to balance
that diet by including food groups of all sorts. This is where the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) food pyramid can be a big help; it contains
realistic recommendations of the kinds of foods everyone should work into
their daily diet and how much of these foods they should be eating. In this
chapter, we talk about everything nutrition, from the food pyramid and typi-
cal sources of fat in the diet to calorie counts and fast food.

Understanding Nutritional Requirements:
Look to the Food Pyramid
In January 2005, the USDA responded to criticism of its old, standard food
pyramid by launching an entirely new, interactive pyramid (see Figure 7-1).
The main goals of this new program are:
 To spread the news that one eating plan isn’t right for every single
person
 To provide clearer, more specific information for each individual person
according to his or her age, weight, and gender
The Web site (www.mypyramid.gov) that accompanies this new program
provides helpful, realistic recommendations and information about how your
individual eating plan stacks up against the government recommendations.
You can type in all the food that you and your child have eaten in the last 24
hours, and the site analyzes its nutritional values and lets you know (with a
series of happy or sad-faced icons) how you’re doing.

Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

The latest incarnation of the food pyramid is more in touch with middle
America, taking into account that . . . well, most people just didn’t get the 
old pyramid, which seemed to have a whole lot of food listed willy-nilly. The
pasta and grain group, for example, recommended 6 to 11 servings per day
but didn’t tell you specifically what kinds of breads and grains you should 
be eating — or how much. (Eleven whole-grain rolls sure seems like a lot of
bread to ingest day after day!) The revised pyramid, in contrast, breaks rec-
ommendations down into how many specific measurements (ounces or cups)
of a food group you should be shooting for each day — and it makes these
recommendations based on age and gender. Now that makes sense!
Look at all the pretty colors: 
What the pyramid means
The recommendations contained in the new food pyramid are based on daily
caloric intake, which means that one serving size doesn’t fit all. Based on a
daily caloric intake of 2,000 calories, here’s what the colors of the food pyra-
mid translate into, foodwise:
 Orange: Grains. The recommendation is 5 to 8 ounces of whole grains
per day.
 Green: Veggies. The recommendation starts out at 21⁄2 cups each day 
for a person who consumes 2,000 calories daily, and the amount is
raised or lowered with individual caloric intake. In addition, the USDA
recommends regularly choosing from different veggie groups (specifi-
cally, leafy, orange, dark green, legumes, and starches).
 Red: Fruits. The recommendation is 2 cups per day of a variety of fruits;
choose fresh, frozen, canned, or dried, but go easy on fruit juices, which
tend to be packed with sugar.
 Yellow: Oils. The pyramid makes a distinction between healthy fats 
(like those from fish and nuts) and unhealthy fats (like those from butter
and lard). The recommendation is to choose sparingly from healthy fat
sources.
 Blue: Milk/Dairy. The recommendation is 3 cups of low-fat or fat-free
milk or dairy products each day.
 Purple: Beans and meats. The recommendation is to choose lean meats,
use healthy cooking methods (no frying!), and work different sources of
protein into the diet (like nuts, fish, seeds, and peas).
107
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

The revised pyramid gives a general recommendation for daily caloric intake
and then advises monitoring weight to see how that recommendation is
working out. If your child seems to be gaining weight, you should cut her
calories down a bit more. When we talk about daily caloric intake for obese
children later in this chapter (see the section “Counting Up the Calories: How
Much Should My Overweight Child Be Eating?”), we advise going a bit lower
than 2,000 calories per day, which puts your child in the same general ball-
park as the above recommendations, but we stick by the recommendation
that monitoring weight is the only way to know whether your child’s daily
intake is adequate or if it’s too much.
In addition to specific nutrition recommendations, the revised USDA food
pyramid also includes:
 An emphasis on activity: The little person on the side of the pyramid is
climbing the pyramid’s steps. The new program recommends at least 60
minutes of activity per day for kids (on most days).
 Recommendations for working various foods into your family’s diet:
Throwing carrots at the kids each night isn’t enough, according to the
pyramid. Instead, you should shoot for green veggies on one night and
orange veggies the next night in order to get the most benefit from
healthy foods.
 A de-emphasis on sugar: Although the old pyramid also advised using
sugars sparingly, the revised pyramid specifically advises against sugar-
laden drinks, like many fruit juices and sodas. (Hooray, we say!)
 An explanation of healthy fats: Fish oils, for example, are a good source
of essential fatty acids, but butter is simply a source of fat. This pyramid
makes the distinction clear.
The Web site for the revised food pyramid, www.mypyramid.gov, includes
helpful links to other sites (such as the President’s Challenge for physical fit-
ness, in the event your family members want to make a friendly competition
out of becoming fit). It also has loads of helpful tips for preparing healthy
foods and snacks as well as an entire page of interactive games just for kids!
Putting the pyramid to good use
Taking the recommendations from the food pyramid under advisement is 
the first step in knowing what kinds of foods should show up at mealtimes 
in your home. A healthy plate has two things going for it:
108
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 It has foods representing all the major food groups (which are repre-
sented on the food pyramid by the different-colored stripes).
 The portions are under control.
A discussion about the appropriate types of food must also address portion
sizes. Simply put, many people eat too much food and don’t even know what 
a normal-sized portion looks like anymore. A single serving in a restaurant is
very often enough to feed at least two people or enough to be eaten by one
person at two separate sittings; however, because huge portions have become
the norm when eating out in this country (and because so many people eat
out so often for various reasons), we seem to have forgotten that leaving the
table feeling ready to burst isn’t normal or healthy.
Structuring a healthier lifestyle for the family includes redefining how much
food is enough to get each body through the day without depriving it of fuel
for its most basic functions and physical activities. Anything more than that
results in weight gain. We talk more about portion sizes in Chapter 9.
Fat Is As Fat Does: Recognizing 
the Fat in Your Family’s Diet
When you’re gathering information and knowledge about nutrients and nutri-
tion, you can’t really go halfway. It all snowballs until you know more than
you ever expected. When you begin to understand how a couple of nutrients
benefit or negatively affect the body, you also find out about the effects of
other nutrients. Nutrition may seem like a complicated topic, but we can
assure you that it really isn’t. All you need is a desire to learn and a willing-
ness to commit yourself to becoming more informed. You don’t need an
advanced degree in medicine to comprehend this information!
Avoiding fat
You can’t initiate and maintain a healthy lifestyle in your home if you unwittingly
undermine yourself by making uninformed nutrition choices. Consider this sce-
nario: You plan a lovely dinner for the family, making sure to include something
from each of the food groups: chicken, broccoli, whole-grain rolls, and milk to
wash everything down. At first glance, this meal sounds very balanced and
healthy. But what’s this — you’re serving fried chicken? Broccoli with cheese
sauce? Butter slathered on the roll? Whole milk with chocolate syrup?
109

This meal, which was headed in the right direction, has taken a nose dive
with the addition of a whole lot of fat, which the USDA food pyramid recom-
mends using “sparingly.” (The same advice goes for sugar, by the way, which
is why that glass of milk would have been a healthier choice if it were skim
and plain.) Fat is practically the central nutrient of the meal, and regardless
of what you’re serving — whether it’s low-fat meat, fish, or vegetables — if
you add a not-so-healthy dose of fat to it (by frying it, smothering it in a fatty
sauce, or dousing it with a high-fat condiment), you’re undoing the health
benefits of that food.
Adding fat to meals really is that bad for the body, whether that body’s heavy
or thin. Not only can excessive dietary fat lead to the development of obesity
and all its associated health risks (outlined in Chapter 3), but it also can lead
to elevated cholesterol levels, which in turn can increase a person’s risk of
cardiovascular disease. In addition, fat can cause damage to some of the
internal organs (the liver, for instance, and the intestines), even if a person
isn’t overweight.
Making healthier food choices
A healthy food covered with fat is no longer healthy. There’s really no excep-
tion to this rule. Excessive amounts of fat negate the healthy qualities a food
has to offer, and this rule applies to eating foods in combination with one
another, as well. For example, upon entering your favorite fast-food
establishment, you may peruse the menu and settle upon a grilled chicken
salad, which is a great choice. The chicken gives you your protein, and the
veggies pack a nutritional wallop loaded with vitamins and minerals. Heck,

Fat in baby and toddler diets
The one exception to cutting down fat in your
household is if you have a baby or toddler. Small
children need some fat in their diet for the
development of their central nervous systems,
which is why youngsters who aren’t breast-fed
drink formula or whole milk (both of which are
good sources of fat) for the first two years of
life. Breast-fed infants get an adequate amount
of fat from their mother’s milk.
Most pediatricians recommend formula for the
first year of life, supplemented with a healthy,
balanced diet. Doctors don’t recommend putting
toddlers on an all-fish-fry diet, as this would
provide kids with far more fat in their diets than
is healthy. Chances are, kids will get a sufficient
amount of fat from the foods they eat, even in
the healthiest households.

you even decide to go with the low-fat dressing in order to keep the salad 100
percent healthy. Great work!
Ooh, but then you spy the milkshake that you really need to have. That quali-
fies as dairy, right? And the French fries? One more veggie can only mean
more goodness for you at this meal!
Things were going really well until the shake and the fries appeared on your
tray or in your bag. Technically, the shake may qualify as a dairy product
(although more and more, fast-food milkshakes are made from man-made
products and don’t include any milk at all), but it also provides a whole lot 
of fat and refined sugar. And the fries? They don’t have even one redeeming
quality, even though they started out as healthy spuds.
With fried foods, not only is fat absorbed into the food, but the frying process
itself is thought to increase the risk of certain kinds of cancers. No matter the
food (vegetable, fish, meat, cheese — whatever), once it hits the oil in the deep-
fryer, it goes in a food group that doesn’t merit its own space on the food pyra-
mid: Fat on a Platter. It’s even worse than eating plain fat, so avoid it at all costs.
Other misguided attempts at nutrition may include:
 Candy-coated fruits: A raisin shouldn’t be covered in chocolate; it’s
sweet enough on its own. And even though allowing your kids to dip
their apple slices in caramel isn’t the end of the world, the apple is
much, much healthier on its own. Plus, you don’t want them to get the
idea that fruit is only edible when it’s covered in sugar.
 Super-sweetened yogurts: The lowest-fat varieties of fruit-flavored
yogurts provide your child with a healthy serving of dairy. Hint: These
yogurts usually aren’t the ones that are shocking blue or neon green in
color, nor are they the yogurts with the stir-in candy pieces.
 High-fat dressings and condiments: Dipping carrot sticks into chunky
blue cheese dressing may sound like a great after-school snack (and isn’t
nearly as bad as substituting Buffalo wings for the carrots), but it pro-
vides your child with far more fat than you’ve bargained for. (And the
cheese in the high-fat dressing is definitely not the best way to work
dairy into your child’s day.)
 Chips: Potato or corn, fried chips aren’t healthy. If your child loves the
crunch of a chip for a snack, give him a baked snack instead, like pret-
zels, which are much lower in fat than their fried counterparts, or try
corn or rice cakes. Both are low in fat and calories. And by the way,
potato chips don’t qualify as veggies.
111
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

 Too many servings, or too-large portion sizes: Too much of anything
isn’t good. Although healthy foods like fruits and vegetables have a high
fiber content and are therefore quite filling, it’s still possible to consume
too much of them, especially if your child is accustomed to large portion
sizes. Excess calories cause weight gain, whether those calories come
from fruit or chocolate!
Making the occasional error doesn’t spell disaster for your child’s weight-loss
or maintenance goal, but repeating several mistakes for a long period of time
could be the reason your child continues to gain weight despite your best
efforts. It’s in your best interest to educate yourself regarding the major facts
about nutrition and to keep yourself informed, especially as new products hit
the grocery store shelves. Take an interest in how food is prepared and how
that food will be used (or stored) in the body.
When you get a handle on the basics of nutrition, the rest falls into place. For
example, when you begin planning your weekly menus to include all the basic
food groups, you’ll start thinking in a new way: “Does this food fall into the
protein or fat category?” or “Is this condiment a spice or a fat?” (Spices can
be used with a liberal hand; fats, as you know, are used sparingly.)
Counting Up the Calories: How Much
Should My Overweight Child Be Eating?
The human body only needs so much fuel in order to maintain its most basic
functions. Food provides this fuel in the form of calories, and everyone needs
a minimum amount of calories per day. Recommended caloric intake varies
according to age, gender, and activity levels; some bodies simply need more
fuel than others. When too much food is consumed and the additional caloric
fuel isn’t used for bodily functions or physical activity, the extra fuel is stored
as fat.
The recommendation for daily caloric intake for obese children is 1,500 to
1,800 calories per day. When the child reaches a healthy weight range and
incorporates activity as a normal part of his day, you can start adding calo-
ries back in, little by little (100 to 200 calories at a time), until he achieves a
healthy maintenance level.
Weighing in regularly when adding calories back into the diet is important for
assessing how many calories are too many.
112
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

An obese child is usually overweight due to excessive eating (even though
genetics may play a role and make him more prone to weight gain). Excessive
eating leads to excessive caloric intake. Therefore, decreasing portion sizes
automatically decreases caloric intake and produces major results in the
weight-loss area. Combining physical activity with a reduction in his daily
caloric consumption is the key to success.
The average school-age child needs between 1,600 and 2,500 calories each
day (depending on age, size, and activity level). The average obese child’s
caloric intake far exceeds these margins, which leaves a surplus of fat and
stored energy. Cutting calories back until a healthy weight range is achieved
doesn’t sound like an easy task; in fact, we know that it’s going to take a lot 
of effort and determination on your part as well as on the part of your child.
However, this technique really does work, and it’s not harmful to your child.
Rather than keeping a rigid record of caloric intake, try first cutting your
child’s food intake back to include only the daily food group recommenda-
tions for a child his age. (You can easily find these recommendations on the
food pyramid Web site.) Hit the major food groups, and encourage whole
grains and fiber, which are very filling.

Getting your vitamins from the foods you eat
As you discover more and more about the
basics of nutrition, you may become more inter-
ested in specifics, like which vegetables offer
the highest amounts of a particular vitamin. A
lot of this information tends to become individ-
ualized from family to family. For example, if
your family has a long history of poor eyesight,
you may be most interested in finding vegeta-
bles packed with vitamin A (like carrots), which
is beneficial for the eyes. Or if your family is sick
from October to April every year, you may be
interested in providing them with megadoses of
vitamin C in its natural form (citrus fruits are a
good choice here). Rest assured, feeding your
family a balanced diet consisting of all the
major food groups is usually enough to ensure
good health all around.
Research has shown that vitamins from their
natural sources (food) tend to provide more
benefits than those taken in pill form. So eating
healthy has a dual benefit: It’s a low-fat way of
life and one that may prevent illnesses like the
common cold, too!

food; we’re talking about choosing the right kinds of food. To demonstrate a
day’s worth of food following these recommendations, this section contains a
sample menu of low-fat, low-sugar meals and snacks.
The following menu plan is appropriate for a female child between 7 and 
9 years of age who engages in 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity daily.

ity. Check out www.mypyramid.gov to find out what your child’s calorie

Dietary fat versus body fat: They’re not 
the same, but they’re related
Dietary fat is very dense in calories, so the more
fat your child eats, the better the chance that it
ends up stored in her body as fat. Body fat,
meanwhile, has a biological function: insulation
from the elements. For this reason, fat is always
looking for more unused calories to grab and
hold onto. Unfortunately, this function of body
fat was much more useful to our ancestors,
who performed manual labor all day long and
were routinely exposed to the elements, than it
is to us in this day and age.

Am I shortchanging my child?!
You may be asking, “Are 1,500 calories per day enough for my child? Is my
child going to starve?” Absolutely not. In order to lose weight, your child
needs to eat enough food to maintain her bodily functions and no more. In
her overweight condition, her body has so much stored fat (which, remem-
ber, is stored energy) that cutting back her caloric intake to the point of
simply maintaining her bodily functions doesn’t have any adverse effects.
The body simply turns to the stored fat for energy.
This is not a starvation diet! In fact, this diet isn’t about dieting at all; it’s about
understanding food. How much food is necessary to survive? How much extra
food is your child consuming each day? How is that affecting her body? How
does cutting back on food make her feel physically? These are questions that
obese children never give a moment’s thought. For them, overeating is a way
of life, and it has nothing to do with food’s true purpose, which is to keep the
body up and running.
115
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

Your child may not be happy about the change, and, no doubt about it, 
she’ll be hungry when you first make the switch from unhealthy to healthy
foods (and portion sizes) in your home. But a lot of her reaction is due to 
the fact that:
 She’s used to eating certain types of foods. Greasy foods and sweet
foods are thought to have a calming effect on the brain, which makes
them almost addictive to some people.
 She’s used to eating while doing certain activities, like watching TV.
Viewing a show without her usual snack may make her downright 
irritable.
 She’s used to eating larger-than-normal portion sizes. Her stomach 
is accustomed to being overfilled, so even if she’s eats enough food to
keep her functioning, her stomach won’t feel full.
A child whose meals follow the food pyramid recommendations gets not only
plenty of food but also foods that give her lots of energy to boot. A healthy,
balanced diet makes engaging in physical activity, which is also vital to
weight loss, much easier.
Managing mealtimes and hunger
Studies have shown that obese people tend to eat because of external factors
instead of responding to the body’s natural cues of hunger, like stomach rum-
bles and contractions. For example, if your child is accustomed to setting
herself up in front of the TV just before bedtime each night with a bowl of 
ice cream and a glass of soda, there’s a good chance that she’s not actually
hungry, especially if she just ate dinner an hour or two earlier. But the ice
cream and soda is her evening routine, so she’s attached to it; it’s the way
she winds down after a long day.
There’s nothing wrong with routines, of course. Children thrive on them, but
when routines include food — especially high-fat and/or high-sugar foods —
you can almost bet that weight gain is the end result. Every person (children
and adults) should learn how to listen to their body’s cues for hunger and eat
only when they’re legitimately hungry. This awareness is the first step in con-
trolling the amount of food — and how many calories — your child consumes
each day.
If your child just isn’t hungry at 6 p.m. when you’re ready to put a healthy
dinner on the table, don’t make her eat. Even though having family dinners
several times each week is a good routine, it’s also a flexible one. A child who
116
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

isn’t hungry should still come to the table with everyone else; however, if she
doesn’t feel like eating, don’t make her sit through the entire meal. Let her
talk with the family for a few minutes, and when she’s ready, allow her to
wrap her plate and put it in the fridge for later. Gathering around the table 
is less about the food and more about being together and catching up on
each others’ days. Most important, the family dinner is about not mindlessly
consuming food — and calories — in front of the TV. We talk more about the
importance of family meals in Chapter 11.
One of the worst best-intentioned moves that parents can make is forcing a
child to eat simply because it’s mealtime. However, you don’t want your child
to start skipping meals, either, because that isn’t healthy. So have her come
to the table at the dinnertime. If she isn’t hungry right then and there, wrap
her plate up and put it in the fridge for when she is hungry.
Farewell Forever, Favorite Foods?
The most distressing part of adopting a healthier lifestyle is saying goodbye
to the old one. Putting a stop to family moments that have revolved around
food for as long as you can recall may seem downright impossible. Sunday
dinners, holidays, spur-of-the-moment gatherings, your nightly chats over 
pie and ice cream . . . you name it, and it’s a tradition in someone’s family.
Occasionally indulging yourselves in a celebration that includes sweets or a
hot dog or two isn’t the end of the world (that kind of all-or-nothing thinking
is as dangerous as giving into cravings at every turn); the trick is to see these
times as special events and not as everyday occurrences.
Healthy food is always 
the better choice, kids!
If you can’t imagine telling your kids that healthy foods are best without them
laughing in your face, you’re not alone; moms and dads everywhere have this
same problem. But getting through to the overweight child on this topic is
especially important. It’s one thing to talk at the kid about healthy choices;
it’s another thing entirely to have him understand why you’ve changed how
you do things in the kitchen.
Accepting a new, healthy eating regimen takes time and a lot of effort. Don’t
trick yourself into thinking that your kids are going to be just tickled pink
when you refuse to serve up their beloved chicken Parmesan and garlic
117
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

bread smothered in mozzarella cheese. Unhealthy goodies are all they’ve
ever known, after all, and they may cling to their old favorites like a rock
climber on a sheer mountain face.
Convincing your child that a healthy diet isn’t a study in deprivation is a
helpful first step in helping him accept this new way of life.
Visualizing the differences
Because fat and sugar are so densely packed with calories, your child can
actually eat larger quantities of low-fat, low-sugar foods for the same amount
of calories. In addition, the larger quantities of food (and fiber) make your
child feel full in a way that high-fat, high-sugar foods can’t (at least not in
single servings of these foods).
For example, the average candy bar has about 300 calories, give or take a few.
What kinds of healthy snacks can your child substitute for roughly the same
number of calories?
 9 cups of air-popped popcorn
 6 small apples
 Almost 90 pretzel sticks (not the larger pretzel rods)
 2 large pieces of whole-wheat bread
 100 grapes
 75 baby carrots
 300 blueberries (230 calories)
 3 cups of oat-ring cereal with milk (360 calories)
Do you think your child could really eat 100 grapes or 75 carrot sticks, or even 9
cups of popcorn? Obviously, he’s going to feel full on these foods well before he
reaches the caloric equivalent of the candy bar (which is good because these
portions aren’t exactly ideal and should only be used for comparison’s sake).
When we talk about cutting back on fat and sugar in order to lose weight and
lead a healthy lifestyle, we’re not really talking about eating tiny quantities of
food; we’re talking about choosing the right kinds of food.
Leading the way
Convincing your child that healthy food is best is your job. Start by educating
yourself about healthy foods, and then educate your child. When you’re
making his sandwich in the morning and he’s whining about not having white
118
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

bread, tell him why you’re giving him whole wheat. Explain why you’re pack-
ing him a tuna sandwich rather than salami. Let him know why low-fat milk is
a better choice than whole milk and why you’re tossing an orange in his
lunch box for dessert rather than cookies.
Kids are much more apt to give into a healthier lifestyle if they see that you’re
leading the charge! For that reason, it’s as important for you to follow through
on your own words and instructions in your own life. Demanding that your
child eat whole grains while you continue to eat your own refined carbohy-
drates because you just hate the taste of whole-wheat bread is setting a poor
example. So is ordering fried chicken for yourself in a restaurant while you
order grilled chicken for your child. You have to live the life before you can
sell it to your child.
Even if only one child in your household is overweight, everyone should
follow the same set of healthy rules. The change is about good health, first
and foremost, and bad habits are bad for you, no matter what your weight.
Educating your child about the effects of being obese is also an effective tool.
You don’t want to scare your child, of course, but because serious health
issues are common in obese children and adults, your child needs to know
what he’ll be up against if things don’t change in your household.
Learning the ropes in the kitchen
Encourage your kids to get in the kitchen and make their own healthy snacks
as well as help you when you’re preparing meals. Not only is food prep a
great learning tool, but it also gives kids a feeling of being in control. If the
only foods in your house are healthy choices, then you don’t have to worry
about them making unhealthy snacks, no matter how unappetizing some of
their healthy combinations may look to you.
Don’t say a word if your child chooses to make a healthy snack that seems
unpalatable to you. Exploring food is as much a part of growing up as grow-
ing hair long or wearing pants with holes in the knees: Kids need to establish
their food likes and dislikes on their own, or they may never be able to make
healthy decisions for themselves. Observe and keep an eye on portion sizes,
but otherwise . . . mum’s the word.
Getting used to the taste of nonfried foods
In recent years, the recommendation for weight loss has moved away from
dieting (that is, temporarily giving up high-fat, high-sugar foods in order to
achieve weight loss) toward redesigning one’s entire lifestyle.
119
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

To people who are very entrenched in their eating habits, conventional diet-
ing can seem like the lesser of two evils when compared with changing every-
thing about the way they — and their families — have been eating (and
probably not exercising). However, reworking an unhealthy lifestyle is the
only thing that works for permanent weight loss and improved health! We
know that it isn’t easy for you to make a blanket statement to the family along
the lines of, “Well, we can never, ever, ever have fried foods again. Sorry.” For
one thing, you’re likely to be met with rebellion; for another, it’s not exactly a
true statement. A more accurate statement is, “We’re going to start eating
grilled, baked, and broiled foods on a regular basis.”
Your kids probably won’t like healthy foods, at least not in the beginning.
What do you do when your child refuses to eat your low-fat dinner, saying
that he hates the taste? Eat the food on your own plate, and put his plate in
the refrigerator for later. If the only foods in your house are healthy options,
you don’t have to worry about him sneaking a cookie or a piece of candy.
Consistency is the name of the game when you’re introducing the family to
new tastes and textures. Be firm, don’t give in, and don’t make separate
meals. (For more on healthy meals and picky eaters, check out Chapter 9.)
New foods may taste strange to your kids (and to you) at first. Introduce
foods that they’ll find most palatable first — no sense giving them ammuni-
tion to work with by serving up a healthy dish containing a food no one has
ever liked, fried or not. For example, if your family has always refused to eat
fish of any sort, don’t serve up tuna steaks during your first week of healthy
eating. You want to keep their spirits high and get their palates to accept 
nongreasy, nonsugary foods first; then you can branch out with meals.
Here area some other tips for getting those taste buds in gear:
 Have a positive outlook: You’re the leader of the pack, but that doesn’t
mean that you won’t have your own moments of weakness. Do your best
to keep in mind that all your efforts will pay off for every member of the
family — even if they don’t like what you’re serving for dinner tonight.
 Keep a journal: Note the new foods you try and your family’s reactions.
When you’ve found several meals that are acceptable to everyone,
making your weekly menu will be easy. You’ll also have an easier time
experimenting with new recipes using staple items, like chicken or
pasta.
 Watch the snacks: Your kids certainly need an afternoon snack, but
don’t let them load up too much — even on healthy items like fruit. You
want them to be hungry enough to at least want to eat their dinner. (On
the flip side, if they fill up on snacks, they won’t have much motivation
to try out your new recipe.)
120
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Your family will get used to the taste of healthy foods as long as you’re willing
to stick with your resolve to buy and serve only healthy foods. Cooking low-
fat, healthy foods is all about changing your family’s palate (the foods that
they crave and accept at mealtimes). After they get used to low-fat, low-sugar
meals, you may find that fried and sugary foods actually give your family
members stomachaches!
Don’t forget to compliment your child for being a trooper in this whole
process. It’s not easy for a kid to fall into step in a healthy lifestyle, so when
you see that he’s doing well and keeping up a positive attitude, tell him how
proud you are — regardless of whether he’s lost any weight. Having the right
attitude is the toughest part of accepting a new lifestyle; if he has a good out-
look, the rest is more likely to fall into place.
The Lures and Dangers of Fast Food
Fast food is bad for your child and your entire family. Stop buying it. (Is that
the end of the story? Oh, hardly!)
We understand — really, truly, sincerely comprehend — that fast food is the
ultimate godsend on a busy weeknight when you’ve worked a full day and the
kids are going in different directions. At the end of a busy day, you feel as
though you can’t commit to any dinner that isn’t already prepared and
bagged up for your convenience.
Although completely understandable, these still aren’t good enough reasons to
feed your family the typical drive-thru fare. In this section, we talk about why
eating fast food has become so common, why it’s so unhealthy, and why cut-
ting out this habit completely — especially in families with weight issues — is
so important.
Fa(s)t food: What you crave
Recently, many fast-food chains have started offering their customers health-
ier options, like salads and grilled chicken sandwiches. Heck, you can even
find bottled water in a lot of places these days. So if you’re really in a pinch,
you can definitely find a healthy option or two for your kids. You’d think we’d
lay off fast food for this reason.
Well, you’d be wrong. The problem with fast food is that so many people
crave and consume the unhealthy items on the menu, which far outnumber
121
Chapter 7: The Basics of Good Nutrition

the healthier options. And the reason that people crave these foods, accord-
ing to some researchers, is because they’re loaded with addictive com-
pounds, including:
 Sugar
 Fat
 Caffeine
 Refined carbohydrates
Thinking that there may be addictive compounds in fast food isn’t such a big
leap in logic. If you don’t just love your morning coffee but actually have to
have it or else your entire day is ruined, you know the feeling of having a
chemical dependence. This addiction isn’t as serious as heroin or nicotine
addiction, but it’s still real. Caffeine and sugar tend to act on the body by pro-
viding a burst of energy; fats and carbohydrates tend to have an opposite,
more mellowing (sometimes tiring) effect. Combine these substances in one
sitting on a regular basis and your child’s body doesn’t know what’s going on;
all it knows is that it wants these substances and wants them now.
Some critics of the fast-food industry have gone so far as to suggest that restau-
rants know exactly what they’re doing by pushing unhealthy foods with addic-
tive compounds: They’re creating a nation of addicts who truly feel a physical
craving for burgers, shakes, and fries. Whether you believe that there’s a true
intention to hook people on fast food is your own call, but you can’t deny the
argument that a regular fast-food habit can be very hard to break.
Addictive qualities aside, the average frequent fast-food customer may
expect weight gain, heart disease, and/or diabetes after consuming a diet
high in fat and sugar for several years. Although an exception to this rule may
exist somewhere (like someone who’s eaten huge burgers every day of his life
for the past ten years and looks and feels fit as a fiddle), most people who eat
fast food on a regular basis can pretty much expect that their weight will
climb and their overall health will decline.
Kids and fast-food meals
The average kids’ meal at a fast-food place contains:
 Burger: 280 calories; 13 grams total fat; 4 grams saturated fat
 Small fry: 240 calories; 13 grams total fat; 2.75 grams saturated fat
 Small soda: 270 calories; 30 grams sugar

Good fat, bad fat, and really bad fat
It’s no secret that most fast-food items are high
in fat. However, what many people don’t know
is that not all fat is created equally, and before
you can truly understand how bad fast food is
for the body, you have to know a little bit about
the chemistry of fat. (And we promise, it’s a very
little bit of chemistry.)
All fat consists of chains of carbon atoms with
hydrogen attached. The number of hydrogen
atoms attached to the carbon determines what
kind of fat the molecule is and how it will be
used in the body. For example, monounsatu-
rated and polyunsaturated fats each have a
hydrogen atom attached but also have a space
open for a molecule other than hydrogen to
attach itself. These fats aren’t saturated with
carbon.
The saturated fat molecule, meanwhile, has
hydrogen atoms attached at every open spot.
While mono and polyunsaturated fats can be
used elsewhere in the body (depending on what
kind of element attaches itself to their open
area), saturated fats can never be anything but
fat. That’s why saturated fat tends to raise cho-
lesterol levels (a measurement of fatty deposits
inside the arteries; these deposits can lead to
heart attacks and strokes).
Trans fats (also called hydrogenated fats) are a
type of saturated fat usually manmade in a
process called hydrogenation, which adds
hydrogen to the chemical makeup of unsatu-
rated fats. This process was initiated in order to
make fat more stable and give foods a longer
shelf life. You can think of saturated and trans
fats as solid fat; shortening, for example, con-
tains both types of fats. Now imagine that kind
of substance floating around in your blood-
stream, through your arteries. Trans and satu-
rated fat are far more likely than unsaturated fat
to start raising blood cholesterol levels, clog-
ging up the works and leading to heart disease
and strokes in adults.
Trans and saturated fats are believed to lower
HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which is the
“good” cholesterol, and raise LDL (low-density
lipoprotein), which is the “bad,” artery-clogging
cholesterol. HDL may actually help to lower LDL,
but only if the HDL measurement in the blood is
higher than the LDL. (Which it definitely won’t
be if you’re eating lots of saturated and trans
fats.)
The really scary thing about saturated and trans
fats is this: With childhood obesity on the rise,
more doctors are doing research into the
damage that the youngest bodies sustain from
eating a diet too high in fat. They’re finding that
kids in elementary school are already showing
signs of high cholesterol!
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration consid-
ers trans fats such a serious health risk that as
of January 1, 2006, food manufacturers are
required to list the number of grams of trans fats
per serving on their nutrition labels. Fast-food
places aren’t required to list their nutritional
counts on every hamburger wrapper and
French fry container that crosses their counter,
but they’re supposed to make that information
available to the public. Some places keep their
pamphlets out in the open, whereas others only
hand them out to customers upon request. Most
of the bigger chains also list nutritional infor-
mation on their Web sites.

This one meal adds up to 790 calories, 26 total grams of fat, and 30 grams of
sugar. You know what’s missing, though? Vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Also, 790 calories is on the high side for one meal (and the smallest “com-
plete” meal you’ll find in a fast-food place, at that), especially when we’re talk-
ing about limiting calories to about 1,500 to 1,800 per day for obese children.
You can do better than this kids’ meal for your child. She could have a plate
of grilled chicken, salad, and a baked potato and consume far fewer calories,
fat, and sugar! Or try one of the recipes in Appendix A of this book. For exam-
ple, the Salmon Patties and Mini Black Bean Burgers are interesting, tasty,
and healthy substitutions for fat-laden drive-thru fare.
What you can do: Dust off the burners
When was the last time you prepared a meal with fresh ingredients? If you
can scarcely recall making a meal from scratch, you’re not alone. In this day
and age of parents working full time and single parents doing everything, it
makes sense that the fast-food industry should step in and help us out where
we most need it — at mealtimes.
But fast food is what you make of it, and you can prepare meals for nights
when the family is on the run. Chapter 9 offers tips for preparing and freezing
meals ahead of time for nights when you know everyone will be taking off in
different directions. All you need to do is find a way to transport those serv-
ings, and even that’s simple: Pack food in small plastic containers and bring
along plastic utensils for eating in the car or at the game. (Loading up your
cabinets with the right equipment makes any meal portable! Check out
Appendix A for ideas for healthy take-along meals, like Creamy Carrot Soup
or Turkey Burgers.) Add bottled water, and you’ve just replaced your family’s
normal fast-food dinner with something healthy.
No, it’s not as easy as ordering at the drive-thru speaker, but it’s far better for
your family’s health. After you’ve made your own version of fast food a few
times, you’ll see that it really isn’t difficult and your family can eat healthy
foods just about anywhere!

iven a choice between having a maid, a nanny, or a cook, plenty of par-
ents would choose the cook, especially as their children get older and
more independent. As a parent, you’re eventually freed from the chains of
diapering and constantly picking up toys, but you always have to feed the
kids. Planning meals that are acceptable to the entire family isn’t always an
easy task even under the best circumstances because children are wont to
change their tastes without consulting the person working so hard to prepare
their meals (that would be you). It can be especially trying, however, to con-
vince a child who’s accustomed to eating sweet, greasy and/or salty foods
that fresh produce is a better choice. (Heck, it can be difficult to coax an adult
into eating a more healthful diet!)
Switching a family from eating almost nothing except fattening foods to a
healthy diet can be so frustrating that parents are left bewildered, disheart-
ened, and without hope. (How is it that your sister, your neighbor, or your
best friend manages to feed her children grapes and apples while your kids
pull the old gag-and-faint-on-the-floor routine when presented with a lovely
fruit plate?) Is it possible — really, truly within the realm of reality — to
entice your family into better eating habits? The answer, of course, is yes, 
but you can’t do it without some planning.
Conquering your child’s weight problem begins at home with the creation of
weekly menus and solid grocery lists featuring healthy foods. This chapter
offers tips for preparing to feed your family more nutritious foods and also

includes advice on how to get the kids involved in (and maybe even excited
about) this new venture.
Eating Right Requires a Plan!
Turning your family’s eating habits around requires diligence and dedication.
What’s at stake is a loss of physical mobility, a loss of health, and a loss of self-
esteem in your obese child. In fact, the situation is pretty dire because your
child only has one body to see him through the many, many years ahead.
Mobility, good health, and positive self-esteem play a huge part in the lives of
happy people, but unhealthy eating habits can diminish or destroy these fac-
tors. When you think about it, it would be a shame not to jump in and play
referee between your family and fatty foods, right?
Taking charge of the food that comes into the house isn’t actually all that dif-
ficult (at least theoretically), especially if you have small kids — after all,
you’re the boss. You’re the keeper and manager of the food funds and the
guardian of the gate. Stand tall and repeat the mantra, “No junk shall pass
through these doors.”
Correcting your family’s eating habits is made much more difficult when you
happen to be a junk-food junkie yourself. Taking the cupcake from your tod-
dler’s hand is easy; tossing it in the trash may not be. To this end, a solid 
grocery-shopping plan is a must. If the cupcakes aren’t in the house to begin
with, you spare yourself and your family the temptation any time the pantry
door opens.
Making a List and Checking It Twice:
What to Shop For and Why
A lot of parents aren’t keen on the idea of hitting the grocery store armed
with a page-long list and loading up the cart until it overflows. “Too much of a
bother,” they say. The grocery store isn’t going anywhere; it’s easy enough to
pop in on a day-to-day basis to pick up dinner fixings, and hey, it’s even easier
to swing through the burger (or taco) drive-thru after picking up staples like
milk and bread. And why should parents fight the crowds at the market when
some fast-food joints offer healthy-ish choices?
126
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Well, for starters:
 Preparing a list forces you to take inventory at home. What do you
need? What’s been lingering in your cabinets and refrigerator drawers?
Out with the old, in with the new (and fresh)!
 Having a list in hand actually saves time. If you hate the grocery store,
it could be because you often feel lost wandering the aisles looking for
items that you may or may not need. It could also be because you’re
there every other day, stressing over what to make for dinner.
 Preparing food in your home is always cheaper and healthier than
buying fast food. In fact, the healthy choices in the drive-thru are often
the most expensive items on the menu! For example, you may pay close
to $4 for a grilled chicken sandwich at your favorite burger place, but
you can buy several chicken breasts for the same price at the grocery
store.
Fair enough, you say. Perhaps making a commitment to visit the grocery
store on a weekly basis is more cost-efficient. But what should you be buying
if your main goal is to promote healthier eating habits in your home? By and
large, the foods that you end up feeding your family will depend on taste —
yours and theirs. You don’t have to serve poached fish and celery when
everyone would rather be eating Mexican or Italian meals. The most impor-
tant thing is to plan a menu for the week and then base your grocery list on
that menu.
Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 Plan for at least five family dinners a week. Studies show that families
who eat together tend to have fewer weight issues, perhaps because
everyone is focused on the gathering and paying attention to what
they’re eating. Weekends can be a bit more relaxed, and you may find
that instead of ordering pizza and wings out of necessity, you have some
healthy leftovers to serve up at a moment’s notice.
 If your family has never been big on meals together and you have no
idea what to feed them, start thinking about your main dishes. Will
you feed them meat, fish, eggs, vegetarian meals? Your favorite ethnic 
or family recipes can be modified to be less fattening and healthier, so
don’t count them out just because you’ve been preparing them with lard
for the last 15 years. For more on modifying recipes, see Chapter 9.
 How you prepare food is just as important as what you prepare.
Bear in mind that it’s not enough to choose chicken over pizza with the
works; how you prepare the chicken determines how healthy a choice it
127
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

is. We discuss food preparation more in Chapter 9, but know that frying
even the healthiest foods negates their good qualities. So although your
kids may love fried zucchini at every meal . . . it’s really no better for
them than French fries.
Although getting the weekly menu up and rolling takes some effort (particu-
larly if you’ve been shopping by the seat of your pants for decades), in the
long run, you’re likely to find that it simplifies your life. No more scrambling
for dinner ideas night after night, and you’ll free up some time every day
that’s otherwise spent waiting in line at the market. Plus, posting the menu
somewhere in the kitchen not only reminds you of what you need to defrost
for that evening’s meal, but it also lets everyone in the house know what
they’ll be eating for the week. This information can be particularly good for
family members who don’t accept change easily. (Conversely, waiting until
dinnertime to spring a healthy surprise on these same folks can backfire in 
a big way.)
To a large degree, an obese child’s success or failure with a weight-loss pro-
gram depends on his parents’ attitudes and efforts. Changing your own views
on food can be difficult, especially if you don’t particularly want or need to
lose weight. But if you’re worried about your child’s size, you just can’t stock
the pantry with healthy foods for your obese child and junk food for the rest
of the family. Most children don’t have the willpower to walk away from their
favorite treats, no matter what their size or weight. For this reason, it’s very
important to keep high-fat, sugary foods out of the house.
Don’t forget the produce
No more breezing right on through the produce section on your way to the
bakery! Make sure your weekly menu includes a vegetable dish for each
dinner. If your kids have a favorite, great; if they’ve never eaten veggies in
their lives, start off with something safe before branching off into Brussels
sprouts territory. Most kids will eat a couple of the following choices:
 Corn (canned, frozen, or on the cob)
 Carrots (boiled or raw with plain yogurt or low-fat dressing for dipping)
 Cucumber slices (it may help to peel the cuke — the skin can taste
bitter)
 Celery sticks (another option that’s often best served peeled)
128
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Slow and steady wins the race; you don’t have to convince them in one day
that all vegetables are as delicious as potato chips (although one day they
may come to decide this for themselves).
Introduce one vegetable at a time, go easy on the butter and salt (and don’t
even think about hiding those veggies under Hollandaise sauce, which is basi-
cally just liquid fat), and set a good example for the kids by eating your own
veggies. Although veggies are healthiest au naturel, a fat-free salad dressing
may be just the thing to convince a reluctant vegetable eater that these good-
ies from the garden are actually edible and don’t taste so bad after all.
Take it easy on the bread and pasta
When it comes to bread and pasta, try to include as many whole-grain
choices as you can. They’re filled with fiber, minerals, and vitamins — all 
elements that refined flour products (such as white bread and regular pasta)
just don’t offer (at least not naturally).
Feeding the early birds and 
packing a power lunch
Your grocery list isn’t limited to dinnertime entrées and side dishes; you still
have to think about healthy breakfast and lunch options.
Breakfast is a tricky, sometimes volatile meal, especially if you have kids 
who aren’t morning people. You’d do almost anything to get them off to
school without any major emotional meltdowns, and if that means serving
doughnuts and a fruit drink at the breakfast table, then so be it. You figure
that they have a long day ahead of them and need their energy, which the 
ton or so of sugar contained in this unhealthy meal should provide.
All right, so you’re not offering up an officially calibrated ton of sugar, but 
you can do much better. For one thing, sugar contains empty calories, 
which means that although the body takes the calories contained in sugar
and either uses them or stores them, no actual nutrients are absorbed along
with those calories. Sugar has no protein, no vitamins, no minerals . . . not
much except fat-building potential.
A hiker or runner may need (and easily convert) sugar calories into energy,
but the average child has enough natural energy (and then some) to make it
through the day without a sugar boost.
129
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

Rather than sugar-laden breakfast treats, consider these alternatives:
 Low-sugar, high-fiber cereals, with fruit added if they really need some-
thing sweet in their bowls
 Eggs, which are packed with protein (something kids need for healthy
growth)
 Whole-wheat toast with low-sugar jelly to deliver fiber a-plenty and
some vitamins as well
 Oatmeal that isn’t supersweetened
Even though your child gets on the bus and out of your hair, you still have to
do your best to monitor her meals. If you happen to live in a school district
that takes healthy meals seriously, you can feel good about sending your
child off to school with lunch money. (Chapter 12 talks about checking out
school lunch programs.) More typically, though, kids attend schools that pay
a lot of lip service to balanced meals but don’t follow through in the cafeteria.
If fried foods, heavily buttered veggies, and ice cream treats are the rule at
your child’s school, consider loading up on the following lunch staples to
pack in her lunchbox:
 Whole-wheat bread
 Tuna fish packed in water (and prepared with light mayo)
 Pita pockets or tortillas to fill with veggies and/or cheese
 Fresh fruit
Your goal is to eventually convince your child that a banana or applesauce is
a treat all by itself. But if she just isn’t buying this and insists on some sort of
dessert, try these alternatives:
 Graham crackers
 Animal crackers
 Fig bar cookies
 Low-fat yogurt
Fight the temptation to buy the lighter, low-fat versions of your child’s
favorite treats. She may accept the low-fat cookies initially, but in several
weeks, she may have a craving for a cookie with all the bells and whistles
(that is, sugar and fat). She’s more likely to fall back into old habits if her
tastes haven’t truly changed and she’s just been tricking her taste buds 
for a while.
130
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Attacking snacks
When your child comes home from school, he’s starving, of course. He’s put
in some tough hours learning, and he needs something to tide him over until
dinner. Snack time is no time to let your good intentions slide! Forget the
brownies and offer the following instead:
 Cut-up fruits and vegetables (the less work kids have to do to make
these foods ready-to-eat, the more likely they are to eat them)
 Dried fruits
 Low-fat yogurt
 Air-popped popcorn
 Pretzels
 Cereal-based snack mixes
 Fig bar cookies, animal crackers, or graham crackers
 Low-sugar cereals
You don’t want to starve your kid, but you also can’t let all heck break 
loose at snack time. If he sits down to eat an entire bag of pretzels and fol-
lows that up with three containers of yogurt, that’s just too much. Remember,
he’s accustomed to ingesting large portions, and he may not realize what a
normal portion looks (and feels) like. If he’s old enough, try to explain that he
has to relearn the feeling of being full and also the feeling of true hunger.
Smaller portions will be the norm from this point on.
The bottom line: Snacks are okay — in moderation.
Make sure snacks have their parameters; for example, your child may be
allowed to fill a small bowl with pretzels, but draw the line at letting him take
the entire bag to his room while he does his homework. That’s not a snack;
that’s just excessive eating.
A sample shopping list
When it comes time to figure out what good food items should go on your
weekly grocery list, plan ahead and think about keeping the pantry stocked
in preparation for healthy last-minute meals, school lunches, quick break-
fasts, and low-fat snacks. Your list should include staples like:
131
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

 Skim or 1 percent milk: Soy milk is another low-fat option that some
kids just love. Other dairy products should be at least part skim.
Margarine is much lower in fat than butter, and cheese made with 
skim milk is lower in fat than regular cheese.
 Whole-grain breads: Whole-grain pitas and wraps fall under this cate-
gory along with whole-grain pastas.
 Vegetables: Fresh veggies are preferable, but canned or frozen are better
for long-term planning and storage. Just make sure that butter and/or
cheese aren’t added to your veggie choices.
 Fruit: Load up on fresh fruits (berries, apples, bananas, oranges, kiwi —
whatever your kids will eat!) whenever you can, but avoid fruits that are
canned or frozen in heavy syrups. For convenience, natural applesauce
(without added sugar) is usually a pretty safe bet, as are raisins, prunes,
and other dried fruits. And low-sugar jellies are great toppers for whole-
grain toast in the morning.
 Low-fat meats: Chicken and turkey breast have lower fat contents than
beef and dark meats (like poultry legs). On nights when convenience
and quickness are priorities, try an already-roasted chicken (usually
found in or near the deli section) rather than a fried bird. (Chapter 9
contains more information on choosing the healthiest meats.)
 Soy products: If you’re thinking about cutting meat out of your diet 
altogether, give soy a chance. You can purchase it in blocks or cubes 
(as in tofu) to add to meatless dishes, or you can buy soy foods, like 
soy hot dogs.
 Low-fat snacks: Stock up on pretzels, graham crackers, popcorn kernels
(for air popping), rice cakes, low-fat yogurt, ice pops made with real fruit
(and no sugar added), granola bars, gingersnaps, and vanilla wafers.
 Spices: Salt and pepper, of course, are staples, but other spices add
flavor to recipes without adding fat. Experiment with different tastes, 
or purchase spices for specific recipes.
Basically, your shopping list should contain mostly low-fat, low-sugar
choices. A small treat here or there obviously isn’t going to cause weight
gain, but remember, you’re trying to change tastes and cravings in your
family. It’s dangerous to bring home a box of donuts and expect an over-
weight child to stop at eating just one, especially if he’s used to eating three
or four in one sitting. And don’t expect treats to just sit around uneaten —
when you bring unhealthy foods into the house, they will get eaten.
132
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

What to leave off your list
Maybe you want to come at healthy grocery shopping from the other direc-
tion. The following kinds of things shouldn’t make the cut when you prepare
your weekly list:
 Whole-milk diary products: Butter, sour cream, cream cheese, cheese
curds, blocks of cheese . . . they’re all filled with fat. Look for their low-
fat counterparts. You’ll be surprised at how quickly your family gets
used to the new taste.
 High-sugar cereals: Sugar is nothing but empty calories. Look for low-
sugar cereals or choose plain oatmeal and let the kids stir in some fresh
peaches, bananas, or raisins.
 Pastries: They’re high in fat and sugar, which makes them no good.
Leave the donuts in the bakery and the frozen breakfast pastries on ice.
 High-fat meats: Even the low-fat versions of bacon, hot dogs, burgers,
sausages, and cold cuts are high in sodium, which contributes to the
development of heart disease. You’re better off cutting items like these
off the grocery list for good.
 Convenience foods: Items like TV dinners, pot pies, and frozen pizzas
contain high amounts of fat and sodium to prolong their shelf lives and
improve their taste. They’re also usually fairly expensive, so pass them by.
 Sugary juices and soda: These beverages are grouped together here
because both have high sugar contents. Your child gets very few nutri-
ents from sugared juices and no nutrients from soda. For the most part,
these drinks contain empty calories.
 Fake sweeteners: The jury is still out on the long-term safety of some
sugar substitutes, and anyway, you don’t want to replace a real sugar
addiction with a fake one.
 High-fat snacks: TV dinners and frozen pizzas have no place in a healthy
home, and chips, microwave popcorn, cookies, cupcakes, and ice cream
should also be replaced with low-fat snacks (see “Attacking snacks” ear-
lier in this chapter).
 High-fat condiments: Replace regular mayo with a lighter version; ditto
for salad dressings and sauces. Skip the sour cream and use plain low-fat
yogurt instead.
Ideally, high-fat and sugary treats should be the exception to the healthy-
eating rule in your household. We’re not advocating complete self-flagellation
and a lifelong sacrifice of desserts and such. Realistically speaking, everyone
133
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

enjoys a treat now and then — but the fact that you don’t eat them every single
day is what makes them treats! Your child will probably be surprised at how
much more enjoyable treats are when she gets them just every now and then;
and you’ll probably be surprised when you realize that the family doesn’t miss
having cake every night. With your support and determination to stick to your
guns, your family can and will get to the point at which healthy shopping — and
healthy eating — is just the order of the day and not something that requires
a lot of thought. We know that to many parents, this sounds like a bunch of
hooey. It isn’t. This lifestyle isn’t impossible, but an obese child needs at least
one strong authority figure to implement and enforce it.
Getting the Kids Involved in the Planning
Kids are more apt to learn the finer points of choosing the best foods if
they’re involved in making decisions about the food that enters the house.
You may have a hard time accepting your child’s input if you like to be in con-
trol of everything in the household and especially when you first begin this
weight-loss process. However, the sooner you let your child throw her opin-
ions into the mix of meal planning and grocery shopping, the sooner you’ll
know if your words are having any effect on her. Sure, it’s usually easier to
take matters into your own hands and just do the cooking and the shopping
yourself, but children have to know the difference between healthy and
unhealthy foods if they’re to have long-term weight-loss success.
Some of the foods that you try when you’re implementing a healthier diet 
for the family will be trial and error. Don’t let a flop in the kitchen discourage
you from continuing on with your new healthy eating plan. It takes time for
the palate to adjust to these different foods. And in any event, there may be
some foods that your family just doesn’t like. Don’t lose heart; just keep
trying.
Deciding on the menu for the week
At some point, many moms get tired of hearing that there’s nothing to eat
and that the family doesn’t really like what’s being served for dinner. The
simple solution is to get the kids involved in what goes on in the kitchen. Let
them help you plan the menu for the week. Hand over the grocery list and
allow them to add their own healthy choices.
There are a couple of benefits of getting kids involved in menu planning:
134
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 You allow them some freedom within the new eating plan. You don’t
simply demand that they eat certain fruits and vegetables; rather, you
lead them in the right direction and then allow them to choose which
fruits and vegetables they’d like to try. Instead of being a dictator, you’re
instituting a plan for the kids, by the kids.
 You educate them to make better choices. When your son lists
microwave popcorn as a treat he’d like to have for the week, take the
opportunity to discuss why air-popped popcorn is better for his health.
(In case you don’t know why: Air-popped is lower in fat and calories;
microwave popcorn is usually smothered in oil and a butterlike sub-
stance.) You want to have these conversations without being preachy 
or overbearing. Your job is simply to inform.
If you have to guide your child away from his first choices for the menu, be
prepared to face some whining — at least initially — along the lines of, “Who
cares if it’s high in fat? I like it! I won’t eat anything else!” Your response should
be to take the grocery list back into your own hands. Your child can refuse 
to eat the healthy foods you bring home; that’s his choice. If he’s hungry
enough, he’ll have to try them. And after he tries them, he’ll find that they’re
not nearly as bad as he expected them to be (even if he won’t admit it). When
he’s ready, let him have another chance to put his two cents in on the gro-
cery list.
What you’re trying to do for a child who’s reluctant to change his eating
habits is just open a door in his mind. All he has to do is realize that there’s
another way to eat — a healthy way, a way that doesn’t cause him to gain
weight and feel unwell — and he’ll be on his way to accepting the changes 
to his diet.
Helping out in the kitchen
Part of reeducating kids about food is letting them help prepare meals. When
your child hangs around the kitchen while you’re preparing meals, it’s easy
for you to say things like, “Baking this chicken is so much easier than bread-
ing it and frying it, and it’s healthier for us, too.” Sharing information in this
casual manner goes over much better than throwing a nugget of information
out there while you’re driving to school. Other topics of conversation during
meal prep may include:
 Nutritional high points of certain foods: Berries, for example, are high
in antioxidants and thought to protect against certain types of cancers.
Lycopene is an element found in high levels in tomatoes and is also
believed to play a part in fighting off cancer.
135
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

 Nutritional low points of particular foods: There’s some confusing
information out there about some food groups. For example, kids need
calcium, but they don’t need it from whole milk. Your explanation of why
you cut out unhealthy foods is imperative to your child learning to make
good choices for himself.
 Healthy substitutions: You may mention to your child that you’re substi-
tuting applesauce for vegetable oil in a cake recipe because it’s lower in
fat and better for everyone’s health. (The recipes in Appendix A show
you how favorite recipes can also be low fat when you use the right
ingredients.)
Healthy Shopping on a Budget
You may be thinking that the advice in this chapter is fine and well for people
who don’t have to mentally tally up their grocery bill as they place items in
the cart. Perhaps the reason your family eats unhealthy foods is because you
can’t afford to buy fresh produce and low-fat meats.
Some parents avoid the healthy-food route because they think that it costs
more to purchase separate ingredients than simply to buy the prepackaged
version of the meal. There’s more to the story. The most expensive part of
overhauling your refrigerator or pantry is the initial stock-up. (Spices, in 
particular, can be costly.) But after you make the switch from junk food to
healthy food, as long as you continue to monitor the weekly specials at your
grocery store, your food bill should settle out somewhere close to what you
used to spend on convenience foods. You may not end up saving money
when you switch to low-fat meals, but you won’t go broke, either.
Avoiding the high-priced traps
Convenience foods are expensive, and we’re not just talking about high-fat
convenience foods like frozen pizzas and sandwich pockets. The price of
healthy convenience foods, like baby carrots (you know, the cute little car-
rots that you don’t have to wash, peel, or cut), can lead consumers to believe
that it’s impossible to feed a family healthy foods and still make ends meet.
And as more and more grocery stores reinvent themselves into meccas of
gourmet food, you see more and more healthy, convenient, and expensive
offerings that only bolster this myth.
136
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

If you’re choosing a snack for the kids, for example, a 99¢ bag of cheese curls
is cheaper than a $2.99 bag of baby carrots. But the bag of baby carrots is
more expensive than the big bag of whole carrots that need washing, peeling,
and cutting but taste the same. If you consider the cost per unit, those big
carrots come pretty darn close to the cheese curls, and they’re obviously
healthier.
Keep in mind that healthy, fiber-filled foods tend to fill the stomach more
than high-sugar and low-fiber snacks and foods. Your child may be able to
consume half a bag of cheese curls without feeling satisfied, but a large apple
and a piece of whole-grain toast will fill her stomach and tide her over until
dinnertime. These are healthy snack choices, and of course, she also gets
nutrients from the apple and toast that the cheese curls just can’t offer.
As soon as you walk through the doors of almost any grocery store, you find
yourself in the produce department, which nowadays often includes a refrig-
erated case of peeled and cubed fruits, expensive organic juices, and out-of-
season fruits. These items are pricey, and that’s why they’re in the prettiest
spot in the produce department. Take a look behind you and you’ll see that
almost everything else is laid out in plain bins. There are bargains to be
found in the produce aisle if you know where to look and what to avoid.
Suppose you’re thinking about tossing a nice salad to add to the family
dinner. You head over to the bags of precut, prewashed lettuce and are
shocked to find that one package costs almost $5. That’s an insane amount 
of money to spend on lettuce, right? Head down the aisle a ways and you’ll
find an entire head of iceberg lettuce (generally the least expensive lettuce)
for a fraction of the price. Sure, you have to wash and tear the leaves, but you
get a lot more use out of an entire head of lettuce than you get from that bag
of salad.
If you’ve been loading up your freezer with precooked or ready-to-cook foods,
you may be surprised to find that your grocery bill doesn’t skyrocket when
you switch to raw materials, so to speak. When you purchase convenience
foods, you’re really paying for someone else to take most of the work out of
preparing those meals or snacks. Conversely, when you purchase separate
ingredients with which to prepare your meals, you not only save money, but
you also have complete control over what goes into the dishes you make for
the family. For example, when you serve up a frozen pizza, you have no idea
about the quality or freshness of the ingredients. But if you make a pizza from
scratch, you do.

Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

Having a plan = saving money
Eating healthfully requires a plan, and shopping for healthy foods without going
broke requires even more planning. You’re right in thinking that people who
have money to burn have an easier time buying the foods that they need — but
you could say the same thing about anything in life. The lack of a bottomless
bank account shouldn’t prevent you from buying healthy foods; it only means
that you need to do some extra research and planning before you head to the
grocery store.
What kind of planning, you ask?
 Get your Sunday paper. It contains coupons and sale fliers from the gro-
cery stores in your area and is worth every penny of the $2 you spend at
the newsstand.
 Know what’s on sale for the upcoming week before you make your
menu and shopping list.
 Clip coupons for extra savings, but only clip the ones for foods you
would normally buy.
 Make a shopping list for the entire week. The bill may seem high at
first, but if your current shopping habits include popping into the store
every day to buy essentials for only the next 24 hours, you’ll probably
end up spending more.
 If you see a sale item that you know you want to keep around, such as
whole-wheat bread or chicken breasts, stock up while the price is low.
 Check the unit or per pound prices on items that you use frequently.
Buying items in large quantities is usually less expensive.
 Try the store brands. They’re usually just as good as the national
brands and are often cheaper — which adds up to big savings when
you’re totaling up a basket full of groceries. In many cases, you can actu-
ally save more by purchasing the store brands than by clipping coupons
for the national brands (which often require that you buy three or four
units of an item in order to save a quarter).
 Resist the temptation to stock up on high-fat convenience foods, even
if they’re on sale.
Shopping wisely is much cheaper than eating out or swinging through the
fast-food drive-thru. Consider this: You can take your family of four out to
dinner at a sit-down family restaurant three times and spend $100. Or you can
take that same $100 and stock your fridge and pantry for the week with just
138
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

about everything you need for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks — if you
plan ahead and look for specials.
Putting food in the deep freeze
One of the best ways to get the most bang for your buck at the grocery 
store is to purchase items that are on special, plan several meals around
those items, and then freeze the extras. That way, you’re always preparing
your healthy meals at the absolute lowest cost. For example, boneless, skin-
less chicken breasts are a healthy, versatile, easy-to-prepare item, but they
tend to be fairly pricey. When you see them on sale, stock up for the coming
weeks so that you don’t spend twice as much on your meal next week as you
did this week.
If you don’t necessarily want to prepare meals ahead of time, at least stock
up on the sale-item ingredients and plan to store or freeze them until you’re
ready to cook.
Prepare your menu, prepare your list, and then prepare to prepare more than
you normally would in the kitchen. If you hate to cook, it may seem to you
that merely planning healthy meals is bad enough; asking you to cook even
more food is nothing short of pure torture. But that’s where you may be a
little shortsighted. If you’re in the kitchen and cooking anyway, doubling or
tripling the recipe and freezing the extra portions is nothing — in fact, it
saves time in the future. Do the work once, and reap the benefits for several
meals. (This idea is sounding better and better, isn’t it?)
To put your freezing plan into action, you need to:
 Prepare your list and menu. You know the drill (see “Making a List and
Checking It Twice: What to Shop For and Why” earlier in this chapter for
a refresher).
 Clear room in your freezer. Toss the junk food (ice cream, onion rings,
and the like) once and for all.
 Invest in good freezerware. You can go with trial and error here, but
the more expensive freezer bags usually provide better protection for
meats and veggies. Ditto for the better-quality plastic containers.
 Know how to freeze. Casseroles and soups are better off in glass or
plastic containers; uncooked meat and raw veggies are best protected in
freezer bags. (For more tips, see the bulleted list later in this section.)
139
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

Although family meals are important, we know that every family also has its
wild and crazy evenings when it’s darn near impossible to get everyone in the
same room for five minutes, much less an entire meal. So you may also want
to consider freezing individual portions of meals for nights when you know
that your teenager will be fending for herself while you and your husband
work late. She can fix a nutritious meal without having to do anything except
pop it into the microwave.
Freezing individual portions also allows you to send a healthy home-cooked
meal to school with your child. Defrost it the night before, heat it in the
microwave in the morning, pack it in a thermos or insulated container, 
and stick it in her lunchbox.
Here are a few things you need to know about properly freezing and defrost-
ing foods:
 Meats have a “use or freeze by” label on their packaging. Adhere to
this advice. If you find chicken in your fridge that’s a week past this date,
throw it out.
 Don’t stick steaming hot food in the freezer, but don’t let food sit out
for more 30 minutes before freezing it. It may start to grow bacteria.
 Label everything that you freeze. If you’re using glass or plastic 
containers, write the name of the meal, the date, cooking instructions,
and the number of portions on some masking tape and attach it to the
container.
 Remove as much air as possible from food storage bags before 
freezing.
 If you’re using glass or plastic containers, leave at least 11⁄2 inches of
space between the food and the lid for expansion.
 Defrost safely. Never defrost poultry and other meats at room tempera-
ture. Put them in the fridge instead. Roughly speaking, it takes about
four hours per pound to defrost poultry and eight hours per pound 
of beef.
 To defrost quickly, put frozen items in cold water. Make sure that the
frozen item is in a watertight wrap or container, and change the water
every 30 minutes to guard against contamination.
 Defrost in the microwave. Use a low power setting to defrost frozen
foods, and check the food intermittently to make sure the edges don’t
get overcooked. When you nail down the perfect defrost procedure for a
particular dish, write it down and attach it to the container the next time
you cook and freeze that meal.
140
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

With freezing and defrosting, you’ll eventually figure out which meals freeze
nicely and which don’t. Melted cheese, for example, tends not to regain the
right consistency after defrosting. For this reason, if you’re freezing some-
thing like low-fat lasagna, freeze it uncooked.
Changing the Way You Look 
at the Grocery Store
When you head to the grocery store, you want to be able to walk in as an 
educated consumer and stick to your guns and your plan while you shop.
Grocery stores almost always follow a standard setup, and they do so for one
reason: To get you to stay longer and spend more money. So that you don’t
fall victim to this trickery, this section advises you on how best to handle all
those aisles and options.
Which aisles to avoid
You’ve been going to the grocery store for . . . oh, about forever. You have your
routine, and you’re very attached to it. Or maybe you’re taking the shopping
duties over from your spouse and aren’t all that familiar with where to find
everything. Don’t be intimidated; the key is knowing what you don’t need.
If you and your child have created a menu of healthy meals for the week (see
the section “Deciding on the menu for the week” earlier in this chapter), the
majority of your ingredients are not in the center aisles of the grocery store.
Some items, such as cereal, canned fruits and vegetables, and whole-grain
pasta may be located in the middle of the store, but there are also entire aisles
that you can pass by, like the candy aisle, the soda aisle, and the chips-and-
microwave-popcorn aisle. If an item you need is next to an unhealthy food (if
pretzels are on the shelf below the chips, for example), grab your list item
and keep on walkin’.
The aisles in the middle of the store are there to keep you shopping. For
example, many people stop and buy milk on their way home from work.
You’d think putting the milk near the store entrance would be a pretty good
idea — maybe next to a separate checkout line for milk buyers, even — but
store owners would lose money if that were the case. When you’re forced to
walk through an entire warehouse-sized building, past cookies and candy and
nacho chips, just to get your milk, chances are pretty good that you’ll stop
141
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

and grab a couple of extra things in addition to your must-have item. The
same thing happens when you shop without a list or stray from the list (for
shame!) — you end up buying more than you need. Ka-ching! Someone just
made more money off of you.
Where to best spend your time and money
The freshest foods — and therefore, usually the healthiest options — are
almost always located around the perimeter of the grocery store. These
items include:
 Dairy: Low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese
 Produce: Fresh fruits and veggies
 Seafood: Universally low in fat, as long as it isn’t fried
 Breads: Whole grains are best
 Meat and poultry: Low-fat beef and white-meat poultry
Because your list should be heavy on these items, you should spend little
time in the interior of the store. However, you may need to venture into the
interior aisles to pick up:
 Canned fruits and veggies
 Legumes
 Cereal
 Whole-grain pasta and brown rice
 Frozen veggies
 Low-fat snacks like crackers and pretzels
And that’s about it. Honestly. Sure, you may need to pick up mustard or a spice
now and then, but you can plan a menu and prepare your meals with these
basic foods. (Note that frozen pizza is nowhere to be seen on these lists.)
Reading Nutrition Labels
One of the most important things that you can do to help reorganize your
family’s diet is read and evaluate nutrition labels. As you probably know,
142
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

nutrition labels appear on every food item you purchase. The only exception
to this rule is sometimes produce, but chances are good that if you look hard
enough, you just may find some nutrition facts posted near a bin of apples or
potatoes.
In any event, reading the label is one thing; understanding what that label is
trying to tell you is another thing. When you become adept at understanding
nutrition labels, you can teach your child how to break down the label infor-
mation himself, thus educating him in the finer points of nutrition.
Take a look at Figure 8-1, which presents a sample nutrition label from a
healthy breakfast cereal. In the list that follows, we start at the beginning of
the label and work our way down, focusing on what you need to know for
weight-loss purposes.
 Serving size: Tells you what portion size the rest of the label deals with —
and it’s usually not the entire box or bag of food. In this example, the serv-
ing size is 1 cup.
Figure 8-1:
A nutrition
label.
143
Chapter 8: Planning Your Menu and Shopping

 Servings per container: Tells you how many servings are contained in
the entire package.
 Calories: Refers to the number of calories contained in one serving. 
In this example, if your child eats 1 cup of dry cereal, he takes in 200
calories.
 Calories from fat: Tells you just that — in this example, of the 200 calo-
ries your child ingests, 30 come from fat. That’s about a 7:1 ratio, which
isn’t too bad. Conversely, a hamburger patty may have about 250 calo-
ries, 150 of which come from fat. Over 50 percent of those calories came
from fat — that’s a high percentage.
 Percentage of daily value readings: Tell you how much of a particular
nutrient the food item contains based on recommended daily allowances
for a 2,000-calorie diet. In this example, the serving size provides 3
grams of total fat, or 5 percent of the daily recommended allowance 
of fat.
 Total Fat: Breaks down into subcategories, like saturated, trans, polyun-
saturated, and monounsaturated fats. These fats are listed in descending
order, from the worst type of fat — the types that are most likely to con-
tribute to high cholesterol and heart disease — to the types that are less
harmful to the heart.
 Total Carbohydrates: Tells you how much of the body’s main source of
energy the food contains. Debate has raged in the last few years over
whether people who are trying to lose weight should cut carbohydrates
out of their diet. The answer is no. Everyone needs carbohydrates —
just in moderation. Children should get around 60 percent of their calo-
ries from carbs. Try to avoid refined carbs, like those found in white
breads and white sugar. Whole grains, fruits, legumes, and vegetables
contain carbohydrates in their natural forms and are best for the body.
• Dietary Fiber: Listed under Total Carbohydrates. Foods high in
fiber tend to be filling and also help to keep the bowels moving.
The label in Figure 8-1 is from a high-fiber cereal.
• Sugars: Listed under Total Carbohydrates. The location of the
sugar count can be confusing because fruits, for example, may be
high in sugar but are still a healthy choice because they’re also
packed with other nutrients (like fiber and vitamins). Candy and
soda, on the other hand, contain high amounts of added sugar and
no nutrients to speak of.
 Vitamins and Minerals: Tells you how much of these elements are con-
tained in one serving of the food. When you see nice, high numbers
here, you can feel confident about feeding the family something that’s
good for them.
144
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

It’s not that hard to get used to reading and assessing food labels, but it may
be time consuming on your first few trips to the grocery store. Here are a few
things to keep in mind as you get started:
 When you’re initially trying to cut fat out of your child’s diet, look for
foods that are low in total fat but high in nutrients. Children need vita-
mins and minerals for their bodies’ essential functions. Remember,
they’re still growing and need plenty of energy to sustain them through-
out the day. They just don’t need a whole lot of fat.
 Not all calories are the same, which is why the nutrition label contains
a Calories from Fat measurement. Instead of cutting total calories, it’s
sometimes just as helpful for weight loss to make sure that your child
consumes foods that don’t provide a lot of calories from fat and have a
low percentage of saturated and trans fats. Saturated and trans fats are
more likely to end up as artery-clogging junk. Polyunsaturated and
monounsaturated fats, on the other hand, don’t seem to contribute 
to clogged arteries in the way the other fats do.
 Don’t be misled by labels that claim a product is “Lite,” “Fat-free,”
“Sugar-free.” Take the time to read the nutrition label in its entirety and
evaluate the food based on its sugar, fat, vitamin, and caloric contents. A
food can be fat free, for example, but still quite high in sugar and calo-
ries (and contain no nutrients to speak of).
As we discuss in Chapter 7, when an obese child is trying to lose weight, a
good range for caloric intake is about 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day (but
never lower than 1,500). When she gets into a healthy weight range for her
age and height, she can gradually start adding 100 to 200 calories per day
until she’s able to maintain a healthy weight. Teach your child that her calo-
ries are like money — she only has so much to spend every day. Snacks
should be lower in calories than meals, and she should try to shoot for as few
fat calories as possible. This new way of thinking about food, combined with
increased activity, will help her on the road to weight loss.

Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Laying down some new laws at the dinner table
 Adopting the healthiest cooking styles
 Avoiding unhealthy foods and preparations
 Getting kids involved in healthy food preparation
N
o one can become an expert on healthy eating in the span of 24 hours.
It takes time, a willingness to learn, and a certain amount of dedication
to first educate yourself on the merits of a healthy lifestyle and then put the
knowledge you’ve gathered into action.
Because food is one of those things that we all need for survival, some people
scoff at the thought of exploring its complexities. “What is there to know?”
they ask. “You eat it, it tastes good, and you’re hungry again later in the day.
Hand me a blue ribbon for being an authority on the subject.” While we
appreciate the content of this “lesson,” there’s far more to know about food
than just when to eat it. In Chapter 8, we talk about how to navigate the gro-
cery store and choose the healthiest options for your family. In this chapter,
we help you do something with those choices by explaining how to prepare
and serve food in the healthiest and most family-friendly ways possible. It’s
not enough to opt for fish over marbled beef, for example; you have to know
how to keep your fish dish healthy throughout the preparation process.
Cooking healthier meals for your family can be stressful, particularly if you
don’t like to be in the kitchen in the first place. In order to ensure that your
family gets the healthiest meals possible, though, you have to take the reins
at the stove, so to speak. Your family may be reluctant to accept your new
ideas, but they’ll come around to your way of thinking as long as you show
them that healthy cooking isn’t a whim — it’s the way things are going to be
from now on.

Dealing with Different Palates
Some children are very set in their ways where food is concerned and are
completely unwilling to stray from their favorites. Any kid can be stubborn
and uncooperative when it comes to trying something new, which makes
exposing your family to a healthy diet one tough task. And it certainly doesn’t
help if there’s also an adult in the house who gags when steamed veggies
appear on the dinner table.
Dealing with picky palates is no fun. In fact, hearing a whining chorus of, “I
don’t like this!” or “This looks too weird to eat!” may just send you right back
into the drive-thru lane. This section offers tips on how to ease your family
into low-fat meals and make your healthy cooking a smashing success.
Taking on picky eaters
No one really knows how picky eaters develop. Some people think that kids
are just born with certain preferences, while others swear that parents allow
their kids to challenge food choices and ultimately take charge of meals. We
think that the truth lies somewhere in the middle of the two arguments. The
good news is that you can do certain things to take back control of what your
family eats — and make life easier for yourself. After all, you’re the one doing
the cooking!
Some studies suggest that from birth, some children are very sensitive to
taste, including bitterness or sourness. This theory may explain why some
people (adults included) just don’t care for strong-tasting vegetables like pep-
pers, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, and certain fruits (grapefruit, in particu-
lar, can taste very bitter to some).
The best way to deal with picky eaters (both young and old) is to make it
clear from the beginning that one meal is served each night. (For more on
limiting the family menu options, see the section “Putting your foot down on
separate meals” later in this chapter.) If the kids want to have some input on
what they’ll be eating, that’s great. Let your kids help you plan the menu for
the week (see Chapter 8). The more they start thinking about healthy foods
for themselves, the faster they’ll learn about good nutrition. Let each child
plan a dinner, even if it’s something that the other kids moan and groan about.
Kids are more apt to try something that another kid has chosen, even if that
child happens to be a pesky sibling.
148
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Of course, just about everyone has one or two foods that they just don’t like.
We’re not suggesting that you go out of your way to feed broccoli to a child
who screams at the very sight of it. As long as she isn’t screaming at the sight
of every veggie, you have plenty of other options for healthy side dishes. And
if she hates all veggies equally, chances are she’s a little picky and you have
some work ahead of you. Start by introducing her to tame veggies like corn,
carrots, and beans before moving on to really exotic fare like beets and
turnips.
If your children are teenagers and refuse to eat what you make, so be it. You
can’t always convince a stubborn 15-year-old to try a dish, and sometimes
the coaxing can make matters worse. Teens are old enough to prepare
healthy meals of their own, and if they get hungry enough — and if you 
only bring healthy foods home from the grocery store — they will.
Putting your foot down on separate meals
If you’re new to the kitchen and chef duty, you may be wondering what you,
as the person preparing your family’s meals, are supposed to do when one
kid only eats Mexican food, another one wants to try vegetarian meals, and
your spouse just wants red meat. Do other parents really prepare separate
meals for every picky eater in the family?
No! Although some parents get pulled into this type of appeasement, the
person doing the cooking usually gets sick and tired of so many special
requests. You don’t want to spend the entire afternoon fixing what amounts
to a restaurant-style menu of choices for the family. That’s beyond the call of
duty. And anyway, if your family has been subsisting on high-fat, high-calorie
meals for as long as you can remember, part of the reason you’re cooking
now is to help them change their preferences towards healthier foods.
Your family can’t possibly develop new tastes if they’re allowed to success-
fully avoid all but one or two healthy meals per week. In other words, the
more healthy foods you expose them to, the better their chances are of find-
ing several meals that they really like — and then they can build on those
tastes.
Obviously, if tears and tantrums accompany every meal, you’re working on
an entirely different level. When your son objects to something new you set
before him, continue to be encouraging, and don’t fix him a separate meal. Let
him wrap up his dinner plate, put it in the fridge, and leave the table. When
he gets hungry enough, he’ll either try your healthy dinner, or he won’t.
Either way, he will survive.
149
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

Here’s where parents tend to get bogged down in the meal department: We all
want to do what’s best for our kids, and we want them to be happy to boot. If
one meal makes them unhappy, many of us are only too eager to fix something
else that’s sure to please them. In a household with a significantly overweight
child, this eagerness to please the child may be the root of food problems. In
the end, servitude doesn’t do anyone any good — you’re stuck playing the
role of short-order cook, and your child discovers that he can get away with
eating just one or two healthy meals every week. That’s not your goal.
Cook one palatable meal for the entire family and be done with it. You’ll be
happier, and in the long run, you’ll break your kids of their pickiest habits.
You may never convince your son that red onions are tasty, but he’ll end up
eating a lot of healthy foods that he otherwise wouldn’t have tried. (It’s amaz-
ing what happens when you stop playing Cook. They eat what you make!)
And as long as you’re keeping the junk out of your house, you can be sure
that your children aren’t bingeing on candy after refusing to eat dinner.
A healthier lifestyle means that you change the way you do everything in
your home: the way you shop, the way you cook . . . and the way you serve
dinner. Regardless of what you did in the past, dinner consists of one meal 
for everyone. Be firm on this rule. You’re trying to teach your family about
healthy options and making good choices out in the real world. When your
child’s at a friend’s house, that mother or father won’t prepare two separate
meals — one for the family and one for your child. And when your child goes
to school, he won’t choose the tossed salad over the onion rings as a side
dish if he’s never had a salad in his life. You’re the one who has to introduce
your children to good foods so that when they leave home, they consider
good foods valid options!
Encouraging everyone to try new things
Is it right to essentially force a child who hates salad to eat a bowl of crisp
greens? Of course not. It’s wrong to force-feed anyone anything. But getting
your child (and other family members) to try something new doesn’t mean
you have to cram it into his mouth with a plunger. You can be much more
subtle than that. Muster up a good supply of enthusiasm because you’re
going to play the middleman between your family and healthy food.
Get everyone involved
Arm yourself with some healthy recipes you’d like to try out (either from
Appendix A of this book or from other cookbooks), and just do it. Not everyone
150
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

will be head-over-heels excited about cutting the fat out of their diets, but in
due time, they’ll come around. Just remember that choosy eaters sometimes
need someone to get them on the right track before they can jump in and 
participate.
Experimenting with a whole new way of cooking is exciting. You’re constantly
looking for new recipes, you’re bringing different foods home, and you’re
approaching cooking from a whole new direction. Let your family see your
excitement. Encourage them to give you ideas, and listen to what they say.
Your goal is not just to cut the fat from your family’s meals but also to teach
them how to take care of themselves and how to make good choices where
food is concerned.
If you get positive input from your children on the weekly menu from the 
very beginning, that’s great. If they’re acting as though this healthy menu-
planning thing is complete torture and suggesting things like fried chicken
and bacon cheeseburgers for your healthy meals, then you just have to take
control and plan the menu yourself. When they’re ready, they’ll suggest
appropriate foods.
Another way to get the kids involved at mealtime is to let them set the table
however they see fit. Encourage them to make place cards, fold napkins into
unique shapes, or set up a picnic-style dinner (in the family room or out in
the yard). If they feel they’re playing a part in bringing everyone to the table,
they’ll be more likely to join in on the actual dining.
Ease into it with small changes
If your kids aren’t happy about the changes you make in the kitchen, take it
slowly. In other words, don’t try to switch them from eating fast food almost
every night to a completely vegan diet in a week’s time. Instead, start out with
some healthy meat options (like grilled chicken breasts or turkey burgers) or
a healthy pizza in order to make the transition from high-fat foods to healthy
meals easier.
After you win them over with some normal-sounding (albeit healthy) meals,
you can use parental logic on them: “You loved the pizza I made last night.
The chicken I made tonight is just as good, but you’ll never know until you try
it!” If this argument convinces them, you’re good to go. If it doesn’t, you may
want to try out a rule that many parents enforce at the dinner table: Everyone
has to try one bite of the meal in order to give it a fair shot. As long as you’re
not serving something extremely spicy or exotic, this “try it and see” rule may
work wonders for opening up a stubborn mind. If your son has never had any
problem eating French fries, for example, there’s no reason he can’t at least
try a baked potato. If you can just get that first bite into his mouth without
151
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

him dissolving into tears or a major meltdown, he may discover he actually
likes it . . . and the rest of your meals may go much more smoothly.
Part of the reason you want your family to try as many foods as possible is 
so that they know that healthy eating isn’t boring. You’re not asking them to
eat a bowl of plain lettuce every night or give up every food that they love.
Healthy eating just means that the food is prepared differently.
For example, suppose your preteen daughter has been hooked on chicken
nuggets ever since she was a toddler. Instead of telling her that she has to
give up her favorite food immediately and for the rest of time, find a way to
help her broaden her horizons — slowly, at first. Serve grilled chicken sand-
wiches for dinner one night (with low-fat condiments, of course, like low-fat
mayo or mustard); add some carrot sticks and low-fat dressing as an alterna-
tive to French fries. You haven’t taken her into some land of completely alien
food; you’ve just taken what she likes and restructured it so that it’s healthy.
She may complain that it’s not fried, and that’s where your encouragement
will make all the difference. By saying, “No, it’s not, but it actually tastes very
good,” you’re being encouraging; responding with “Too bad. You’re not eating
fried food anymore,” won’t improve her attitude about accepting the changes
to her diet.
Prepping and Cooking the Healthy Way
Maybe you’re a pro in the kitchen and whip up gourmet dishes so good that
the neighbors appear at your door when they catch a whiff of your cooking.
But if you’ve been using fat as one of your main ingredients, it’s time to
explore a healthier way to prepare tasty meals for your family. On the flip
side, if you’ve successfully avoided cooking lessons up to this point, it’s 
time to become skilled in preparing low-fat food in your own kitchen.
When you’re trying to help your child lose weight, cooking your own meals 
is unavoidable. Even though many sit-down restaurants provide healthy
menu options and some fast-food places are starting to look out for their 
customers’ health, eating out every night is very expensive. And besides, 
it limits your family’s options and taste experiences to what’s offered on
menus. When you open yourself up to healthy cooking, you find that you 
can prepare almost any meal in a healthy way.
In this section, we talk about the basics of setting up a healthy cooking envi-
ronment and ways you can go about cutting the fat from your cooking.

Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

The fresher, the better
When you’re cooking healthy, choose your ingredients wisely by reading nutri-
tion labels (for more on deciphering nutrition labels, flip back to Chapter 8)
and cook from scratch as much as possible. When you’re planning your meals
for the week, steer clear of any foods with a high fat content, which include
convenience foods such as frozen TV dinners, frozen pizzas, or prepackaged
meals of any sort (see Chapter 8 for more on convenience foods). These foods
are usually very high in fat and sodium, both of which add to the flavor of the
meals but also contribute to weight gain and the development of high blood
pressure. Cooking from scratch lets you rest assured that what you’re feeding
your family doesn’t have any hidden fat.
Now, you may be thinking, “If I’m not serving a TV dinner, I obviously won’t be
using it to make dinner.” True enough. But convenience foods extend beyond
entire meals to include frozen or flaked mashed potatoes, canned soups, and
macaroni and cheese if it’s partially prepared.
Frozen vegetables are an acceptable option for a side dish — but not if they’re
smothered in cheese. And because overcooking vegetables lessens their 
nutrient-packed punch, buying fresh rather than canned is best, although
canned is better than nothing (and also better than fried, obviously).
Even though some healthier convenience foods are available these days, con-
venience foods still tend to be more expensive in the long run than preparing
your own meals at home, and they don’t really provide you (and more impor-
tant, your child) with the hands-on learning she needs concerning healthy
cooking. At some point, your child will have to choose a meal that doesn’t
come in a can or box with a low-fat label on it. She has a better chance of
choosing well if she’s been in the kitchen watching you actively cut the fat
from your family’s meals.
We’re not suggesting that you till your backyard and turn it into an organic
garden to supply your kitchen (although if you’re interested in that sort of
thing, go for it). Instead, try to break recipes down into their most natural
components. When you’re preparing a casserole, for example, don’t use
canned meat, which is almost always high in sodium. Try to use fresh vegeta-
bles whenever possible because they have more vitamins than canned veg-
gies. In other words, if you’re cooking a healthy meal, you may as well make 
it as healthy as you possibly can.
Preparing veggies
Veggies make a great snack or side dish for any dinner. Your family probably
likes them slathered in butter or — gulp — fried, but you know that those
153
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

preparations just don’t fly with limiting fat intake. So what’s the best way to
serve up veggies that aren’t objectionable? Here are a few tips:
 Choose vegetables that are acceptable to everyone. We all have foods
that we just don’t like, and some people are very sensitive to the bitter-
tasting chemical contained in some vegetables. If everyone moans over
spinach, pick something else. Beans, carrots, corn, and peas agree with
most kids’ taste buds, so give them a try.
 Go raw. Raw veggies are excellent because they’re full of nutrients and
easy to serve. Carrot or celery sticks served as a side dish with a low-fat
or yogurt-based dressing may just satisfy everyone at the dinner table.
 Resist the urge to cut veggies into teeny-tiny pieces before you cook
them. While it takes less time to cook chopped veggies, leaving them in
large pieces helps to keep their nutrients intact.
 Leave the peels on whenever possible; they’re packed with nutrients.
Leave the skins on potatoes when you mash them, and serve snap peas
in their shells.
 Steaming veggies in a double boiler or microwave basket is the best
way to preserve their nutrients.
 If you boil vegetables, use just enough water to cover the veggies, and
boil just until they become tender. Overcooking causes vegetables to
lose vitamins and minerals.
After you start working with vegetables on a regular basis, you’ll know what
your family will eat without complaining — and hopefully that complaint list
will be on the short side. If they continue to balk at eating anything green,
leafy, or grown in a garden, just look for new ways to prepare those veggies.
For example:
 Toss veggies into soups.
 Add lettuce, cucumber slices, avocado, and/or tomato to sandwiches.
 Slice up some potatoes, brush them with olive oil, and bake in the oven
for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Healthy fries!
 Skewer veggies, brush them with some olive oil, and grill them.
 Stir-fry veggies and serve them over brown rice.
 Experiment with different herbs to give steamed veggies a whole new
twist.
Vegetables have endless possibilities, and the more comfortable you become
in the kitchen and the more familiar you become with herbs and different
154
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

cooking methods, the more creative you can be. (And the better the possibil-
ity that your kids will come running to the dinner table rather than hide
behind the sofa when you call them.)
Getting fruity-licious
Fruits make great snacks, anytime, anywhere. Thanks to modern technology
and transportation, you can find almost any fruit at any time of the year,
although out-of-season fruits tend to be expensive. Still, the luxury of eating
fresh red raspberries in the middle of January makes them worth every penny!
As with vegetables, many of the nutrients that fruits offer are in their skins,
so offering your child an unpeeled apple or pear is best.
Children are often more willing to accept fruits than vegetables in their diets
because although fruits aren’t candy, they do contain some natural sugars
and hardly ever have a bitter taste. So, finally, there’s something that may
work in your favor — Mother Nature created a sweet snack for kids with a
sweet tooth!
Although raw fruits are considered healthiest, canned or dried fruits some-
times travel better, particularly in lunchboxes. (Smashed bananas and apples
bruised beyond recognition may result in a child’s refusal to eat the brown
fruit — and can you blame him, really?) When you need fruit that travels well,
keep the following things in mind:
 Purchase small plastic containers to protect fruit on its journey.
 Fruit juice counts as a serving of fruit and comes in handy portable
boxes and pouches. Read the labels, though, and make sure your child’s
getting real, 100 percent juice. Most so-called fruit juices contain very
little evidence of actual fruit (or nutrition).
 Raisins, banana or apple chips, and dried cherries, blueberries, papaya,
and mango are all very sweet and completely uncrushable.
 Make sure that applesauce and other canned fruits aren’t packed in 
(or contain) high-fructose corn syrup. Fruits packed in their own juices
are best.
One way to expose your child to a whole grove of fruits at once is to make a
fresh fruit salad. Fruits tend to blend together well, so toss in whatever you can
find in the produce section, including grapes, apples, oranges, mango, straw-
berries, bananas, kiwi, and pears. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little 100
percent fruit juice to the mix, and serve it up for a snack or as dessert.
155
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

And speaking of desserts, fruits baked into pies don’t count as a healthy
choice unless you’ve personally cut the fat from the pie crust and haven’t
added any sugar.
Ahoy! Eating from the deep blue sea
If the thought of eating fish makes your family crinkle their noses, or if the
only way your family would ever consider eating fish is if it were deep-fried,
the time has come to reevaluate those feelings about our friends with fins.
As for health benefits, fish has a lot going for it:
 Most fish is very low in fat.
 It’s packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to have
wide-reaching and significant health benefits, mostly in the reduction of
heart disease.
 Researchers have found evidence that eating fish may help prevent
asthma, improve the health of the brain and eyes, possibly reduce the
risk of certain cancers, improve the health of diabetics, and alleviate
symptoms of depression.
You may have heard media reports about fish being associated with high
levels of mercury in the bloodstream, which in turn can cause neurological
problems. So are we crazy for advising you to feed fish to your family? No.
Almost every variety of fish has traces of mercury, but only certain kinds
tend to have very high levels. The FDA recommends avoiding shark (at the
table and in the water), king mackerel, and tilefish, which all tend to have
high levels of mercury. According to the FDA, shrimp, canned light tuna, 
pollock, salmon, and catfish tend to have low levels of mercury.
Frying fish (or anything else, for that matter) isn’t the way to go when 
you’re trying to improve your family’s health and help your child lose 
weight. Instead, you can broil, bake, poach, steam, or grill fish, depending 
on the variety and the thickness of the cut. When you purchase fresh fish, 
ask the fishmonger for cooking recommendations.
Marinate or sprinkle fish with herbs before cooking it, and serve it with a
slice of lemon, which really does add flavor and cut the fishy taste. If your
child can’t do without a condiment, give her some ketchup instead of tartar
sauce, which is high in fat.
156
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Shellfish such as lobster, shrimp, and scallops are also low fat and contain
the good omega-3 fatty oils. Not long ago, doctors advised that shellfish be
eaten only sparingly because it was thought to be high in cholesterol. Turns
out it’s lower in cholesterol than was previously believed, so go ahead and
serve your family a lobster or clam bake! (Just skip the drawn butter.)
The lowdown on meat: What’s 
healthy and what’s not
As we explain in Chapter 8, there are healthy ways to include meat in your
family’s diet. In fact, healthy cooking should include meat because meat pro-
vides protein, something a growing child needs. Forget everything you know
about meat, and read the following sections to find out how to choose the
right cuts and prepare them in healthy ways.
Fowl’s anything but foul
Chicken breasts and turkey breasts are both healthy meat choices that are
easy to prepare, even for kitchen novices. To seal in the juices, bake or grill
chicken breasts. A turkey breast requires no more preparation than defrost-
ing it, unwrapping it, and following the cooking instructions on the wrapper.
(Heck, it may even include a handy pop-up timer!) If you’ve never cooked a
turkey breast and believe you’re just not capable of doing so without ruining
it, you’re wrong. (You can thank the experts at the turkey factory for making
the process incredibly easy.)
Before serving them, be sure to remove the skin from chicken and turkey. The
skin holds the juices in during cooking, but it’s also very high in fat and turns
a healthy meal into a not-so-healthy one. Needless to say, frying poultry also
detracts significantly from its health benefits.
When your family gets used to the taste of baked or grilled poultry sans the
skin, something really interesting is waiting for you at the grocery store:
ground chicken and turkey, which you can substitute for ground beef in any
recipe. Think turkey burgers, spaghetti sauce with ground chicken, and
turkey meatballs. If you don’t reveal the switch to your family right away,
they may not even notice the difference in taste. These meat products look
almost identical to ground beef both before and after cooking, so if you’re
worried that your youngster will think that you’re mean for serving up
Chicken Little tacos, keep that information to yourself for the time being.
157
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

When you’re choosing a package of ground turkey or ground chicken at the
grocery store, read the label carefully to make sure that you’re purchasing
ground breast meat! Ground dark meat (from the legs and thighs) isn’t all 
that healthy; you’d be better off buying lean ground beef.
Some safety concerns you should consider when working with poultry
include:
 When you bring poultry home and stick it in the fridge, make sure to use
it or freeze it within 48 hours.
 Defrost frozen poultry in the fridge to keep bacteria growth at bay.
 Poultry contains salmonella, bacteria that can cause severe gastroin-
testinal illness. To protect yourself and your family from contamination,
wash your hands after touching raw poultry or its packaging, keep raw
poultry and its juices away from other foods in the fridge, and use a sep-
arate cutting board and knife when preparing poultry.
 Cook breasts to an internal temperature of 170 degrees and whole birds
to 180 degrees before pulling them out of the oven. Ground poultry
shouldn’t appear pink when it’s fully cooked.
With so many ways to serve it, poultry can become a staple of your family’s
diet. You can cook whole birds or whole breasts, cut up breasts, or use
ground poultry. Because breast portions are low in fat and high in protein,
you have no reason not to add poultry to salads, soups, sandwiches,
casseroles, stir-fry, pizzas, tacos, and more!
Lean and not mean (to your health)
Walk through the meat department of your grocery store and you’ll realize
just how many different cuts of meat there are. Some are much better for you
than others, and getting it all straight may seem like an overwhelming task.
Never fear! Here are some simple guidelines to follow when looking for the
leanest meats:
 Pay attention to the labels. Meats that have a USDA Prime label tend 
to have a higher fat content than meats labeled USDA Choice or USDA
Select. Pass those Prime labels right by.
Ground beef labels give you fat content information, usually in the form
of “75/25,” “85/15,” or “90/10.” The second number indicates the percent-
age of fat in the meat, so choose ground meat that’s 15 percent fat or less.
 Don’t choose meat that has a marbled (white, streaky) appearance.
That’s fat you’re looking at.
158
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 Sirloin, round, chuck, and tenderloin are lean cuts of beef.
 To get really lean ground beef, ask the butcher to grind up some sir-
loin. Also ask him to remove the fat from the edges before he grinds it.
 Lean pork cuts include tenderloin and loin chops — not bacon or
pork sausage.
After you go to all the trouble to buy lean mean, you want to keep it lean on
its way to your table. In order to keep lean meat lean, bake it, broil it, or grill
it, but don’t fry it! When preparing meat for cooking, get yourself a sharp knife
and cut off any excess fat around the edges. After browning ground beef,
drain the fat off by placing the meat in a colander. To get even more fat out
(or off), rinse the meat in the colander with hot water before using it in a
sauce or casserole.
Meat requires the same safety precautions as poultry: Use it or freeze it
within 48 hours of purchase, defrost it in the fridge, and avoid contaminating
other foods or surfaces with the juices. Beef may contain E. coli, a bacteria
that can produce serious illness in children, so make sure any beef you serve
to your kids is cooked to 155 degrees (there should be no pink left). This high
temperature kills any E. coli that may be present. Undercooked pork, mean-
while, may contain a parasite which can cause an illness called trichinosis, so
make sure you cook pork products to at least 144 degrees before serving.
Knowing What to Avoid
Giving up certain recipes can be difficult because they mean so much to us.
They’re more than food — they’re comfort, a way to pass the time, and a big
part of who we are. The good news is that many, many recipes can be modi-
fied to be low in fat and all-around healthier.
Modifying your eating habits begins with understanding why certain foods
contribute to poor health. This section explains what makes some foods and
cooking choices far less healthy than other options.
Pass the fried whatever
It’s possible to deep-fry just about any food, and by gum, it seems as though
people are out to prove that point these days. Take a look at this list of foods
that are regularly dipped in boiling fat and served to kids and their families:
159
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

 Chicken
 Vegetables
 Cheese
 Dough
 Meat
 Fish
Here’s the amazing thing about this list: Everything on it can be 100 percent
healthy if it isn’t fried!
Frying foods usually involves oils that contain trans fats, which are among
the worst offenders when it comes to clogging arteries and contributing to
heart disease. (For more on the kinds of fat, see Chapter 7.) Imagine taking a
lovely little eggplant, full of vitamins and yearning to do your child some
good, and dipping it in egg and bread crumbs (nothing too offensive yet).
Then . . . you toss it in a hot pan of oil and watch its fat content jump 
through the roof!
Some foods don’t have a shot at being a healthy choice in the first place, so
frying them just makes them even worse. At county fairs, for example, the big
thing these days is frying up cookies. Now, no one is fooling anyone here —
cookies aren’t a healthy snack even before they hit the oil. But the thing that
sometimes trips people up — kids, in particular — is thinking that because a
fried food started out healthy, it must retain some good qualities even after it’s
been soaked in hot fat. Needless to say, this isn’t true. A fried “healthy” food
(like a vegetable or lean meat) is no longer a healthy choice. Even if the food
in question manages to hold onto some of its nutrients, the amount of fat it
gains in the frying process pretty much negates the lingering nutrients. In
other words, the bad qualities of fried food completely overshadow any trace
of goodness that may remain after the frying process.
In the end, we can say without reservation that fried food is just not a healthy
option, especially not for a child who is already overweight. We know that
fried foods taste good. We also understand that when a child loves his fried
foods, he truly craves them. But you have so many other options for cooking
tasty, healthy meals that frying should go right out your kitchen window.
Curb the bad carbs
You’re probably somewhat familiar with the debate over carbohydrates: Do
they cause people to gain weight, and should we all do away with carbs in
160
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

our diets? Carbohydrates are natural sugars, and the fact is that humans’ pri-
mary source of energy comes from carbohydrates, so it’s especially impor-
tant for a child to eat enough carbs. The type of carbohydrate a person
consumes, however, is what determines the effect on weight gain.
The following foods contain carbohydrates:
 Fruits
 Vegetables
 Whole grains
 Bread (and breadlike products, like crackers and cereals)
 Pasta
Carbohydrates fall into two vastly different groups:
 Low glycemic index: The carbohydrates you find in most fruits, veggies,
and whole grains (including whole-grain bread products) have what’s
called a low glycemic index, which means that the body easily uses the
natural sugars found in these foods for energy. For the most part, these
foods are in a fairly natural, unrefined state, which means that all their
vitamins, minerals, and fiber is intact, and this condition makes it easy
for the body to use those elements for energy and essential functions.
161
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle
No hope for “healthy” frying
When you see packaged fried chicken adver-
tised as containing “all white meat” or “all
breast meat,” don’t be lured into buying it for
your kids, thinking that it’s a somewhat healthy
option. After all, it’s fried, which means it’s high
in fat and not a healthy choice. Period. Nothing
else matters — not where the meat came from
or how lean the cut was before it fell into the
deep fryer.
If you’re looking for a healthy way to fry your
family’s favorite foods, you’re not likely to find
one. The chemical processes that take place
between hot oil and food have led scientists to
theorize that in addition to adding loads of fat to
the diet, fried foods may also cause a cancer
risk. And changing your frying method to use
different oils only changes the risks, it doesn’t
eliminate them.
Different oils containing different types of fat
(saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated,
and trans fats) have been tested to see if any
can produce a healthy fried food. The end result
of these tests is basically this: The chemical
composition of each type of fat and the way it
reacts with food results in different health risks,
like cancer and cardiovascular disease.

 High glycemic index: Foods that contain white sugar and/or white flour
(like white bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, and doughnuts) have a high
glycemic index. These foods have high levels of refined carbohydrates
(meaning that the natural grain has been stripped away), which cause
the body’s blood sugar levels to jump higher. If that blood sugar isn’t
used fairly quickly, it’s stored as fat.
Like we said, everyone needs carbohydrates for energy, but when you serve
up bread and flour products, make sure they’re in as natural a state as possi-
ble. Stick with good carbohydrates by following these guidelines:
 Buy whole-grain foods, like whole-grain bread and brown rice. Whole
grains provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
 Use whole-wheat flour, and avoid using white sugar as much as 
possible.
 Avoid white-flour breads and pastas. If you compare a white-bread label
to a whole-wheat bread label, you can see that the vitamin and mineral
content of the white bread pales in comparison. (No pun intended).
Cheese: Friend or foe?
Cheese contains calcium, which kids need for growing bones, so can it really
be that bad? If whole-milk cheese is a part of your child’s daily diet, she’s
probably gaining weight unless she’s extremely active. Low-fat dairy is an
excellent alternative and is readily available in stores these days.
Steer clear of cheese sauce, which is very high in fat. Cheese sauce is an even
more unhealthy choice when it’s poured on top of a refined carbohydrate
(like pasta) or a fried food (like tortilla chips). If your kids have a hankering
for some cheese to top their broccoli, melt a sprinkling of low-fat shredded
cheese on top of the veggies in the microwave.
When preparing pizza at home, use low-fat mozzarella for the topping and
your kids will never know the difference.
Mom, I’m Starving!
No matter what age group you’re dealing with, when kids are looking for
something to eat, seize the opportunity to teach them about making healthy
162
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

choices, first by making sure that your kitchen is loaded with healthy, 
edible foods, and then by making suggestions for a healthy breakfast, 
lunch, or snack.
Getting help in the kitchen
You probably already know that cooking at home takes more time and energy
than ordering out or even using convenience foods on a regular basis. To
ease your kitchen burden, take advantage of opportunities to let your child
help with the cooking. Don’t be shy about giving him duties at mealtime.
Requiring his help in the kitchen:
 Makes your life a little easier, which may, in turn, allow you to maintain
your enthusiasm surrounding your new, healthy recipes (as opposed 
to feeling as though you’ve taken on so much work and no one appreci-
ates it).
 Encourages conversation between you and your child about the upcom-
ing meal. Working on the meal together is a great time for you to drop
little pearls of wisdom concerning making healthy choices.
 Encourages conversation about the day and what’s happening in your
lives, and fosters a sense of support, which is just what your child needs
right now. If he can talk to you about his math test while he washes the
lettuce, he also may be willing to talk about his hopes for weight loss.
But what kinds of kitchen jobs should you give to children? Isn’t it dangerous
to hand a kid a knife and a hunk of meat? Sure, that’s dangerous. Ultimately,
the tasks you give your kid really depend on the age of the child. Younger kids
can do easy tasks, like washing vegetables and tearing lettuce for a salad, set-
ting healthy condiments out on the table, and setting the table with plates and
silverware. Older kids can take on more responsibility, within reason. You may
not want your 10-year-old using a food processor, but you can have him chop
veggies for stir-fry with a small, plastic, dome-covered chopper. You can also
show your preteen how to work the stove while you teach him what kind of
safety measures are involved in using lit burners and hot pots and pans.
If you have a budding chef on your hands who wants to add herbs and spices
to every meal, let him go at it. The two of you may come up with something
your family will love.
163
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

Giving lessons in portion sizes
Before you let your child loose in the kitchen, even a kitchen that contains
nothing but healthy foods, you have to explain portion sizes, or how much
food he should be eating at a single sitting. Some experts say that a handful
of whatever a kid’s eating is an appropriate serving size. We think a better,
more helpful-in-the-long-term method is to teach kids how to read food labels
and then apply the label information.
What the heck are we talking about, you ask? Here’s an example: Suppose
your child wants some cereal after he comes home from school. That’s fine;
you’ve purchased whole-grain oat rings, which provide lots of vitamins and
minerals. The serving size on the label is 1 cup. Hand him a measuring cup
and let him pour 1 cup of cereal into it and then into a bowl he regularly eats
out of. Do the same thing with the milk — find the serving size, and then let
him measure it out and pour it into the bowl. If he wants a banana in the
cereal, no problem. Again, it provides essential nutrients — but one banana 
is enough.
Now, let him look at the bowl in front of him. That’s a normal serving size of
cereal, milk, and fruit. Overweight children and adults are often so used to
eating larger-than-average food portions that they don’t realize how much or
how little they should be eating to adapt to a healthier lifestyle. Encourage
your child to measure out portion sizes until he’s able to easily estimate the
amount of food in an appropriate serving size. (Even better, some serving
sizes are listed in quantities, like “12 pretzels” or “10 crackers.”) Measuring
may seem like a lot of trouble to go through every time he has a snack, but it
won’t take long before he realizes what one serving of pretzels looks like.
Encouraging self-sufficiency
Giving kids certain responsibilities (like feeding themselves from time to
time) encourages good decision making and, in turn, bolsters their confi-
dence because they know that they really can take care of themselves — and
others, if need be. The biggest bonus of teaching your child about making
healthy food decisions is that she learns skills she needs in the real world.
When she slides her tray past the choices in the school cafeteria, she knows
which foods are better for her, healthwise, and she chooses the plain turkey
sandwich on whole-wheat bread over the suspicious-looking macaroni and
cheese.
164
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

Take things slowly at first. When you begin to bring healthy foods home, talk
about them as you put them away. Explain why you’ve chosen whole-grain
flour over white flour, for example, and why you’ve switched from whole milk
to 1 percent or skim. Of course, there’s a fine line between explaining and lec-
turing (especially as far as kids are concerned), so do your best to keep the
tone light and friendly, and don’t get pulled into any kind of debate or argu-
ment over why you won’t bring home donuts or cupcakes.
Although you need to teach your child about the healthy choices the family
is going to be making from now on, take care not to overwhelm her with too
much information all at once. Obviously, an older child can understand more
complex information than a toddler can, but even an adolescent has her
limits on how much she wants to hear from her parents. When she seems 
like she’s had enough of the conversation, continue it at a later time.
After you talk with your child about healthier options and why you won’t
bring certain foods into the house anymore, she’s ready to start preparing
her own snacks and meals. Watch from a distance, and resist the urge to criti-
cize her preferences. (Just because you would never dream of dipping pret-
zels in plain yogurt doesn’t mean that she shouldn’t.) Make sure she’s paying
attention to serving sizes, but give her guidance without making decisions for
her. Encourage the transition from learning what’s best for her health to
putting what she’s learned into action.
Promoting creativity
Experimenting with healthy foods is something to play up in your household.
So many times, people — not just kids, but adults, too — hear the words
“healthy foods” and immediately conjure up an image of dry toast, cottage
cheese, and a leaf of lettuce . . . at every meal. You know that this isn’t the
case; plenty of foods are legitimately great tasting and healthy, so no one has
to feel as though they’re surviving on something that tastes like cardboard.
As long as you make sure that you’re bringing healthy foods into the house,
you can feel comfortable letting your kids make their own choices at snack
time and whenever they may be left to feed themselves. Your daughter seems
to like low-sugar jam on a toasted pita pocket? Great! She wants to pack a
low-fat cheese stick and graham crackers for a snack at school? Wonderful!
She’s stirring low-fat granola into her yogurt for an added kick? Terrific!
These are all healthy snacks, and whether anyone else will find her prefer-
ences appetizing is beside the point. She’s experimenting with new tastes and
textures, she’s making good choices, and she’s learning that healthy does not
equal boring. That’s the lesson you want her to remember.
165
Chapter 9: Cookin’ Up a Healthier Lifestyle

When kids are ready to start preparing actual meals on their own, you may
see an added burst of creativity. Herbs, spices, and low-fat condiments can 
all make or break a meal, so encourage your child to try out these new tastes
and combinations. She may discover a new way to fix a meal she already
enjoys, which will give her more reason to continue experimenting with
healthy foods — there’s just so much to discover!

ating the right kinds of foods in the right amounts, as we discuss in

healthy lifestyle isn’t possible without some form of regular physical activity.
Although it is possible to be heavy, active, and healthy, most overweight
people aren’t physically active. And the less physically active a person is, 
the more weight he’s likely to gain, making it even harder for him to become
physically active even if he wants to. In Chapter 3, we talk about the orthope-
dic pains and strains and the breathing problems that obese kids sometimes
deal with on a daily basis. If your child doesn’t feel well physically, he can
easily make a legitimate argument against engaging in physical activity by
saying, “I can’t go outside and play. I can’t breathe when I move, and it hurts
my legs to walk very far.” Unlike a child who’s unwilling to break away from
the TV simply because he doesn’t want to, an obese kid often has genuine
health issues that discourage him from becoming more active.
But these are the exact reasons that it’s so important for him to do some-
thing. The more time he spends being inactive, the more likely it is that he’ll
never believe he’s capable of turning his physical state around. We’re not sug-
gesting that a significantly overweight child turn over a new leaf by running
around the block a couple of times. When someone is obese, any increase in

his amount of daily physical activity is an improvement. The goal is to
increase activity little by little. The more your child moves, the better he’s
going to feel — both physically and emotionally. You may encounter some
bumps in the road, but throughout this chapter we talk about ways to handle
them and to continue encouraging your child’s progress.
In this chapter, you find out about the best ways to introduce children to physi-
cal activity (which aren’t necessarily the same methods we’d offer for adults).
The name of the game is to keep it fun and interesting so that it doesn’t seem
like work! (Come to think of it, this is the same kind of advice we’d give to
grown-ups!)
If your child isn’t obese but you fear he’s headed in that direction, it’s impor-
tant to start adding physical activity into his daily routine. As with all adverse
physical conditions, preventing obesity is better than treating its myriad side
effects, so discovering how to incorporate exercise into your youngster’s life
now will have long-lasting positive effects.
I’ve Fallen Onto the Couch and I 
Won’t Get Up: Battling Laziness
Obesity doesn’t just happen on its own — not in kids and not in adults. 
Most cases of obesity are caused by unhealthy diets and lack of exercise. 
We talk about establishing a healthy diet in Chapters 7, 8, and 9. This section
addresses the bad habits associated with a sedentary lifestyle. The combina-
tion of eating low-fat, low-sugar foods and adding physical activity to your
child’s day packs a one-two punch against obesity.
Doctors often say that some people are predisposed to weight gain, but that
doesn’t mean that someone whose entire family is overweight will absolutely,
positively become obese; it means that a person who comes from an over-
weight family has to be especially vigilant in his or her efforts to prevent obe-
sity. And if that person happens to be a child, a predisposition means that his
or her parents have to take a very proactive approach to keeping their kid
healthy.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that everyone
engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate activity each day for good health,
but any improvement in your child’s level of physical activity is for the best,
no matter how small it may seem at first. Minor victories are still victories!

Living the sedentary life
Many times, when a doctor or nutritionist is calculating how many calories a
person needs each day, they ask the person about his or her level of activity:
Is it active, moderately active, or sedentary? What do these terms mean
where kids are concerned?
 Active: Playing hard for sustained periods of time. For example, a kid
who’s outside playing football for hours on end is considered active.
 Moderately active: Thirty minutes of physical activity every day in addi-
tion to the everyday tasks of life (such as physical chores like raking or
mowing the lawn, walking to a friend’s house, and so on).
 Sedentary: Sitting in one spot, watching TV or playing video games.
Movement of any kind is extremely limited.
Most obese children fall into the sedentary category, which starts a vicious
cycle. The less active a child is, the more likely he is to become overweight.
As he becomes more overweight, he may be less able to easily engage in
physical activity, plus any health issues that arise from being overweight (like
asthma or aching joints) make it less likely that he’ll participate in some sort
of regular exercise. As time goes on, the situation worsens until the child
feels as though there’s just no way that he can get up and get moving.
Things may be made even worse by the child’s embarrassment over his
weight and lack of participation in activities. For example, a school-age over-
weight child who’s never been one to play outdoors with the other neighbor-
hood kids isn’t likely to be eager to start when his weight reaches a crisis
point. He may fear that the others will make fun of his weight or his lack of
coordination, and if these fears become reality, he’ll be discouraged from pur-
suing physical activity in the future as well.
The best way to introduce your child to a lifetime of physical activity is 
to start out slowly and to keep expectations to a minimum. Exercise helps
burn off body fat, but it doesn’t happen in one day or even in a week. Losing
weight, like gaining weight, takes time. (The difference, of course, is that it’s a
heck of a lot easier to put on extra pounds than it is to take them off.)
In the beginning, don’t concentrate on how long it will take before your child
starts seeing the results of physical efforts. Instead, think of physical activity
as a way to improve the health of your entire family, and encourage everyone
to do the same. Throughout this chapter, we give you tips for including exer-
cise as a regular part of your family’s lifestyle — that’s your primary goal. The
weight will come off with regular activity and a healthy diet, but you can’t
force it and you can’t make it happen any faster than Mother Nature intends.

Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

Sneaking activity into your family’s day
The younger the kid, the less engrained her unhealthy habits are and the
easier it is to convince her that moving her body is fun, fun, fun! Plus, you’re
in complete control of her day, so when you tell your 5-year-old that it’s time
for the two of you to walk the dog, that should be the end of the discussion.
Get the leash, grab the dog, grab the kid, and head out the door.
If you’re encountering resistance with even starting to incorporate physical
activity into your family’s lifestyle, other ways to get everyone moving with-
out them really realizing it include:
 Taking the kids on little errands: Safety is always your first concern, 
of course, so you may have to accompany young children on walks to
borrow eggs from a neighbor down the street or to the corner market 
for fresh vegetables.
 Giving the kids work to do: Hand the kids shovels after a snowstorm
and tell them to clear the driveway instead of hiring someone to plow.
Let them rake, mow, and haul yard debris. Or if you don’t have a yard for
them to work in, give everyone a list of indoor chores. Dusting, mopping,

Gaining weight, losing health in America
Turn on the news any day of the week and you’ll
probably hear about how Americans are more
overweight than they’ve ever been in the past.
Sixty percent of adults in the United States are
heavier than their ideal weight, and obese kids
make up about 10 percent of the population.
These percentages have skyrocketed in the
past ten years, so what’s going on here?
The typical, modern American lifestyle includes
a lot of sitting around — in cars, in offices, at
home — and munching on high-fat and/or high-
sugar convenience foods and junk foods. It’s
really no wonder that, on the whole, Americans
are heavier than they were several generations
ago, when people moved more and ate health-
ier out of necessity. What’s most unsettling is
that the obese children of today are the obese
parents of tomorrow, and research has indi-
cated that heavy parents are more likely to
have heavy children, at least in part because of
the poor lifestyle habits they model for their
kids. Are Americans destined to become heav-
ier and heavier?
No. You already know the ways to turn this
problem around: a healthy diet and more phys-
ical activity. Although not every child (or adult)
will become stick thin by incorporating these
elements into their lives, they will become
healthier, and years down the road, they’ll pass
good habits on to their own kids, which is a
starting point for turning around the health of
the entire country.

vacuuming, and even washing windows gets them up and moving and
accustomed to some light physical activity.
 Trolling for the farthest parking spots: When you head to the mall, gro-
cery store, or anywhere else, choose a parking spot that’s a good dis-
tance from the door. The relatively short walk is a good way to ease your
child into a physical activity.
 Creating a fun zone in your house: If your kids don’t have any room to
let loose inside, they may be less apt to give up their seats on the couch.
Turn a corner of the basement or a spare bedroom into a well-padded
place where they’re free to dance, jump, or roll to their hearts’ content.
An older child is more likely to know what you’re up to when you park far, far
away from the entrance to the store. She may want to debate the physical
activity issue with you and, in fact, may argue with you until she’s worn her-
self out. What do you do with this kid? Drag her outside? Force her to have
fun in the yard? With an older child, you have to take a step back, think about
the reasons she’s opposed to activity, and find out what’s going to work best
for her. She may be holding back because of:
 Physical pain: Her knees, hips, lower back, ankles, and legs may ache
when she engages in physical activity.
 Difficulty keeping up: Whether she has asthma or she simply becomes
winded easily, not being able to breathe can be a real deterrent to any
form of exercise.
 Embarrassment over her lack of coordination: If she’s concerned about
being able to move easily or about what others will say to her concern-
ing her weight, she may protest against any efforts you make toward her
physical fitness.
Even something as seemingly innocuous as walking a long distance from the car
to the store can seem like torture to a child who’s sensitive about her weight, so
do everything in your power not to make it an issue. All the changes you make
are for the health of the entire family, and that’s the card you need to play with a
child who’s reluctant to jump on the Active Train. Simply tell her, “Honey, we’re
parking here because I need the exercise.” Even if you don’t need to lose weight,
approaching exercise from this angle is a really effective way to set a good
example for your child.
Aside from making small changes like walking to school or to the store rather
than driving, the best way to get a reluctant older child moving is to find
some sort of sport that she can tolerate physically and that she enjoys. We
talk more about this option in the section “Organized sports” later in this
chapter.
171
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

Exercise Is Not a Form of Torture
Physical activity is essential to a healthy lifestyle, and not because it can
make your child skinny. In addition to burning off calories, exercise provides
the following benefits:
 It helps to lower cholesterol and improve heart health.
 It can help lower blood pressure.
 Activity aids the proper development of bones and muscles in children.
 Exercise releases endorphins into the bloodstream that help to lift 
one’s mood.
Exercise jump-starts a healthy cycle of feeling good both physically and men-
tally. Although it may be difficult at first, the more your child moves, the more
she’ll be able to do. She’ll feel those endorphins kicking in, which will give her
a sense of well-being during and after an activity. In addition, as she continues
to exercise, her self-esteem and physical feeling of wellness will both improve.
And then there’s the fat-burning benefit that exercise offers, as well. Simply put,
an obese child can’t lose a significant amount of weight without exercising — 
at least not in a way that would be considered healthy. Starvation isn’t an
advisable means of losing weight for anyone, let alone a child or teen who’s 
still growing and developing. Although an undernourished body will eventually
look to fat reserves for the calories it needs, eating a low-fat diet and burning
those calories off through exercise is a much healthier way to achieve a weight-
loss goal. Finding one or more activities that your child can stick with in the
long term is also a way to ensure that her health improves no matter what the
number on the scale reads.
Getting the whole family involved
An overweight child usually comes from a family for which weight is an issue.
His parents are overweight, and his siblings probably are, too. Although obe-
sity is sometimes linked with a genetic predisposition, it’s often caused or
exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyle choices. When choices like overeating
high-fat foods and watching TV around the clock are the norm inside a home,
everyone usually suffers the adverse effects in the form of weight gain.
Our point here is that most families for which obesity is a concern aren’t
dealing with only one overweight member of the clan, so no one feels singled
out when a plan for leading a healthy lifestyle is put into effect. That’s not to
172
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

say everyone is happy about the changes in the household, but the alter-
ations in diet and activity level should be enforced across the board. What’s
good for the kids is good for the adults, and vice versa.
Taking that idea one step farther, what’s good for an overweight member of
the family is just as good for a member of the family who doesn’t have a
weight problem. Unhealthy choices are unhealthy regardless of how they
affect weight. High-fat foods contribute mightily to the development of car-
diovascular disease (namely clogged arteries), and recent studies have shown
that this type of damage can start in childhood! Pairing a low-fat diet with reg-
ular exercise helps counteract this damage, so cutting out the fat and getting
those bodies moving is in everyone’s best interest!
Start with fun and easy activities
Some low-impact, low-key activities that are great for your family’s initial
foray into becoming more active include:
 Walks: Find a park with a decent trail, and explore!
 Swimming: Because of the buoyancy water provides, swimming is a great
activity for overweight kids or adults who suffer from aching joints.
 Bike rides: Biking is an activity that you can adapt to everyone’s individ-
ual athletic abilities. Take it slowly at first — no need to break any
records!
 Toys that encourage activity: Invest in a basketball hoop, rollerblades, a
skateboard ramp, a badminton net . . . anything that gets the family out
the door and doing something.
The more active the entire family becomes, the more apt each member will
be to find his or her own favorite modes of exercise.
Avoid the “E” word
“Now wait a minute,” you’re saying. “My family hasn’t participated in physical
activity in years. What are you suggesting we do, break out the Jane Fonda
tapes?” Well, if your family happens to find these tapes entertaining and
inspiring, then sure — dust off the VCR and give it a whirl! But realize that
exercise is sometimes a loaded word, fraught with all sorts of (negative)
expectations and likely to meet with resistance. And the fact is, kids don’t
“exercise” in the same way that adults do.
For some people (including kids), exercise can conjure up images (or 
actual memories) of becoming breathless, sweating profusely, and generally
feeling completely helpless. Physical education class can be a nightmare 
173
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

for overweight and obese kids (see the “Evaluating Your Child’s Physical
Education Class” section later in this chapter); unfortunately, these bad experi-
ences are often linked to exercise, souring kids on the whole idea of getting
physical. If they’ve been in situations in which they couldn’t keep up and were
teased by other kids or even put down by a teacher for their lack of stamina,
sometimes there’s no winning kids back to the idea that exercise is a good thing.
Ultimately, you may want to avoid using the term exercise. Call it “getting out
of the house.” Or call the activity by its name, as in “Let’s go for a walk,” “Hey,
we’re headed out for a little hike this afternoon,” or “Why don’t we jump in
the pool for a swim?” The most important thing, at least initially, is to make
the family realize that they can be active without feeling as though they’re
going to drop and without feeling as though they’ve failed at something
(those gym class memories again). If you can get this message through,
they’ll end up feeling as though participating in activity can be fun!
Encouraging your kids to 
move it (and lose it)
As we say in the introduction to this chapter, kids usually don’t exercise the
way that adults do. Adults are eager to quantify everything about physical
activity: what they did, when they did it, how long they did it for, and how
many calories (and even how many fat calories) they burned in the process.
Children, of course, just want to do something that’s fun. Your obese 8-year-
old isn’t going to keep checking her watch to see how many more minutes she
has to walk before she can feel good about herself and her weight-loss efforts
today. She’ll feel good about herself as long as she does something that she
enjoys. The goal is to work 30 minutes of activity into most days, but if your
child isn’t expected to keep track, then how do we expect this whole physical
activity thing to work? Does it run on some sort of honor system or what?
The initial goal isn’t exercising for a specific amount of time; it’s teaching
your child that physical activity is enjoyable. When she’s confident that she
can participate in activities, it’s up to you to encourage her to find one that
she likes well enough so that she’ll do it on her own. You won’t have to sneak
around with a stopwatch because active kids like to be active. Here are two
points to ponder:
 Most kids really enjoy and are encouraged by group participation in
physical activity.
174
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 When they aren’t playing in organized, scheduled activities (like soccer
games), most kids play in short spurts — ten minutes or so at a time. It’s
okay, then, for your child to run around in the yard for relatively short
increments of time, as long as she does it several times a day.
Although teens are usually in the age group that’s big on keeping journals,
some younger children may also benefit from keeping logs of their activities,
just to have a visual concept of how things are going. Appendix B provides an
exercise log that they can use.
Organized sports
Participating in sports can really give overweight kids the boost they need,
both physically and emotionally. Feeling a sense of accomplishment — that
realization that, “Oh my gosh, I really can do this!” — is something that these
kids really need in order to continue on the healthy-living track.
Let your child decide what kind of sport she’d most enjoy. Don’t push her
into ballet lessons when she’d much rather be somersaulting in a gymnastics
class. Also, if she’s not an athletic child and wants to try out a sport that
she’s never played before, make sure you sign her up for a noncompetitive
teaching league, at least for her first time out. (This is good advice for any
kid, regardless of his or her weight.) Jumping into a league with mini-pro play-
ers (kids who were either born with a gift for athleticism or who have been
playing the sport practically since infancy) may leave her feeling like a deer
in the headlights, like an outsider, and like this whole physical activity thing
stinks just as badly as she feared it would.
Competitive sports leagues are all about the competition, naturally.
Inexperienced or weaker players often sit on the bench and end up feeling
ashamed of their lack of prowess on the playing field. Teaching leagues, by
contrast, are all about learning the basics of the sport and giving everyone
equal time and opportunity to play. As a result, these leagues are much better
starting points for any child who isn’t well versed in a particular sport.
Your child probably won’t be confined to choosing between gymnastics and
soccer. Kids’ sports are big these days, so when your child is ready, look for
all sorts of opportunities to sign her up for something she’d enjoy. Some
activities to research in your area include:
 Hockey
 Speed skating
 Figure skating
 Skiing
175
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

 Snowboarding
 Baseball
 Softball
 Lacrosse
 Horseback riding
 Basketball
 Football
 Dancing
 Rowing
 Swimming
 Martial arts
 Tennis
 Skateboarding
Many sports leagues are coed (at least until adolescence, when the difference
in size and strength between the average boy and girl becomes more of a
safety issue), and a child can choose between team activities and being a
team of one (in activities like skiing, running, or horseback riding).
Activities for youngsters
The youngest children usually offer the least resistance to including physical
activity in their regular routines. It truly is fun for them to chase and be chased,
and preschoolers don’t yet feel self-conscious about their weight — they’re
more interested in playing, either with other kids or with Mom or Dad.
If you have an overweight youngster, start improving her physical fitness by cut-
ting way down on her TV time. She doesn’t need eight hours of educational pro-
gramming each day. When she does watch TV, choose shows that have some
sort of physical component to them. Many kids’ shows these days ask the kids
to get up and dance along with the characters, for example. From a health
standpoint, these interactive programs are the least objectionable form of TV
(even though kids jumping on the couch tend to grate on parents’ nerves!).
When you want to get her moving outdoors, think back to your own child-
hood. Kids love a good game of chase, hide-and-seek, or tag. A friendly game
of kickball is a blast for little ones, and walking the dog around the block is
nothing short of an adventure! Here are some other ideas for getting little
ones outside and having some physical fun:
176
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

 Visit local playgrounds and encourage her to run and climb to her
heart’s content.
 Take her on scavenger hunts in the yard or park. Hunt for pine cones,
rocks, and pretty leaves.
 Sign her up for a kid-friendly gymnastics class or a learn-to-swim group.
 If you’re a stay-at-home parent, look for play groups in your area.
Keeping her busy is easier if she has other kids to run around with!
Although little ones thrive on routine, some young kids always seem to be
switching gears. The name of the game here is being open minded and flexi-
ble. She doesn’t need to follow a strict exercise regimen as long as she’s
doing something that involves moving her body!
Weight resistance training: Added activity for adolescents
In addition to aerobic activities, which are an effective way to burn calories,
adolescents may become interested in weight training, which is also a good
way to fight a weight problem. Muscle tissue burns calories even when it’s at
rest, so an activity that adds muscle to the body is good for anyone.
If your child is interested in weight training, make sure he’s doing it safely!
Don’t stand by and watch him try to lift a 300-pound barbell when he’s never
lifted anything heavier than a laundry basket in his entire life! Take your child
to meet with a professional trainer, or do some research together to lessen
the possibility of mild or severe injury.
A weight machine is safe for a teenager to use as long as he’s not straining to
lift the weight. Before you buy him that bench press that he’s got his eye on,
though, remember that bench-pressing should only be done with a spotter —
someone who can lift the weight off your teen’s chest if he’s unable to do it
himself. If you know you’re not capable of this feat of strength (and no one
else in the house is, either), don’t bring the bench press into your home.
Remind your child that weight training is a gradual process and that results
often take several months to become visible. Trying to do too much too soon
can result in an injury that will hamper his future progress and maybe turn
him off the whole idea forever.
Keeping boredom at bay
Ever heard the phrase “Familiarity breeds contempt”? Repetition of any 
activity — whether it’s physical activity, school, chores, or playing with the
177
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

same friend for days on end — can lead to boredom. Although some kids find
one or two activities that they love and will stick with from now until the end
of time, most kids need to shake things up a bit in order to stay interested in
physical activity.
Parents, meanwhile, are easily frustrated by children who seem to be darting
from one activity to the next, never quite settling into anything permanently.
If your child begins Tae Kwon Do lessons, for example, and complains about
having to go to his classes midway through the three-month session, should
you let him quit? What about the wasted time and money?
Here’s a good rule of thumb for your child (and not just for sticking with physi-
cal activity, but for making his way through life): When he makes a decision, he
has to see it through to the end. You want to give him the power to choose the
activities he wants to try, after all, and you don’t want to force him into doing
something he truly hates. Fine. But before you hand over a check to a sports
league, gym, or dojo, explain that after he’s signed up, he has to honor his com-
mitment to this activity until the class or season is completely finished.
Even if your child ends up disliking the activity he’s chosen, seeing some-
thing through to the end provides a valuable life lesson: Don’t quit in the
middle of anything because you’re bored with it. If he actually ends up liking
the activity after some hesitation, that’s an even better life lesson: Give every-
thing a fair shot because you just never know how things will turn out.
Staying with an activity even when it’s more difficult and/or less interesting than
he expected it to be also speaks volumes about his efforts towards improving
his health. If the kid quits enough activities in his life, he’ll never feel as though
he’s capable of finishing anything. But if he learns to stick with things, he’s going
to feel far more confident in his abilities to try just about anything.
Kids often get bored or discouraged with activity when they don’t see immedi-
ate results in their weight or when they hit a weight-loss plateau (a standstill).
Encourage your child to continue his efforts but switch to another type of exer-
cise. Sometimes changing activities is just the thing to jump-start weight loss.
Taking weight and health 
into consideration
Everything about adapting to a healthier lifestyle takes effort and time. We
don’t expect an obese child to show immediate results, compliance, or even
an eager attitude when it comes to physical activity. Obviously, a school-age
child who’s never been active in her lifetime may have to work up to the idea
178
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

of becoming physically fit. And we know it’s difficult for a child with legiti-
mate health issues to begin an exercise regimen of any sort.
On the other hand, we also know that introducing physical activity into a
child’s routine is well worth the effort in the long run. Engaging in any sort of
physical activity is better than doing nothing at all, but we aren’t advocating
tossing your obese child into a sports league at this very moment. The basic
start-up plan involves turning off the TV, putting the video games away, and
taking part in some sort of low-impact activity, like walking or doing yard
work. That’s enough for this initial stage. As your child’s stamina increases,
encourage and help her to do more.
Slow and steady wins the race! Every little bit of activity helps, but trying to
do too much too soon can definitely hinder her progress and make her feel as
though she’s faltering.
The benefits of helping your child achieve a certain level of physical fitness
are twofold: Not only do you see her health improve, but you also may notice
an improvement in her self-esteem. The better she feels physically and emo-
tionally, the more likely she is to continue on with a healthy lifestyle and 
not fall back into her old habits. All these elements of healthy living work
together; if one falls out of place, you can expect that the others will, too.
Snowed In or Rained Out?
In the sunny, warm areas of this country, physical fitness is often a way of life.
Families walk, bike, and skateboard year-round. They wonder how people
survive in the colder climates, where physical fitness is often a seasonal
thing: In the spring and summer, everyone looks and feels fit, but come
winter, it’s time to hunker down in the house and hibernate.
If you live in an area where it’s cold literally half the year, you have to know
how to adjust and find a way to keep physically active even when it’s below
freezing outside. Shutting down for months on end just isn’t physically or
mentally good for anyone. Committing to a healthier lifestyle includes finding
a way to keep the family active from January through December and then
doing it again, year after year.
Studies have shown that people who live in northern, cold climates are often
negatively affected by the lack of sunlight in the winter months. They may
develop a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is like
the winter blahs but worse. Exercise has been shown to alleviate symptoms
of depression in people who suffer from SAD.

Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

Finding fun indoor activities
You may feel as though the only options for activity available in the winter
months are skiing, snowboarding, and sports of that nature; and because
your entire family hates the cold, you’re pretty much out of luck. Not true!
You live in an era in which the surgeon general is worried sick about the epi-
demic of obesity, and, as a result, more and more communities offer year-
round indoor activities in the interest of maintaining physical fitness
throughout the winter months.
For you nonskiers, here are some ideas for finding indoor activities when it’s
cold, rainy, snowy, or all three for months on end:
 Look for a community gym in your area. Private gyms are often expen-
sive and may not allow young children. Gyms run by municipalities, in
contrast, tend to be much more family oriented, with activities for every
age group.
 Check out after-school activities. After-school programs are often a
great place to find the teaching leagues we talk about earlier in this
chapter (see the section “Organized sports” earlier in the chapter).
 Research indoor athletic arenas in your area. Because some areas are
snowy from October to April, you may be able to find indoor pools,
indoor horseback riding rings, or even a sports dome offering soccer,
lacrosse, baseball, softball, or golf during the coldest months.
 Think about investing in home equipment. Obviously, you aren’t going
to put a preschooler on a treadmill, but if you have a teenager who’s
trying to lose some weight, a treadmill in your home may be a terrific
way for her to maintain her fitness routine when it’s too cold and icy to
walk outside. Before you make any big purchases, however, make sure
that your teen is interested in exercising at home and able to test out the
equipment (so that you don’t spend a lot of money on something that
eventually turns into a clothes hanger).
 Let them dance. Although cutting back on video games is wise, if your
kids want to play Dance Dance Revolution, let them! The game’s really
popular with kids, and it gets them working up a sweat!
Keeping the little ones busy
If you have small children, get creative and make a safe play area indoors
where they can run and climb without getting into too much trouble! A small
180
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 

indoor climbing gym may be just the thing to keep your preschooler busy, or
maybe she’d prefer a tricycle to ride in the basement.
Take a good look at your home and think about the safest options (taking
things like stairs and sharp countertops into consideration). Pad hard sur-
faces with foam rubber, old towels, or pillows; remove rickety furniture that
your child may be tempted to climb on; and use old furniture cushions to
create soft landing pads for crazy jumps. In addition to wearing herself out,
your child will come to think of certain times of the day as times to be physi-
cally busy. (Although that may wear you out, it’s actually one of the best
things you could hope for in terms of her health!)
Resisting the tube
Before you dismiss indoor activity ideas in favor of letting the kids have a
little extra TV time during the cold months (after all, those gray winter days
can be mighty long without some form of electronic entertainment to help
pass the time), realize that limiting TV time is one of the essential compo-
nents in a healthy lifestyle. Studies have shown that without any other inter-
vention (like actually becoming more active), cutting back on TV time cuts a
child’s percentage of being overweight significantly! And we know for a fact
that sitting around staring at a screen does nothing to help kids lose weight,
so stick to those TV-viewing limits, even when it’s 3 degrees outside.
If your child has a TV in his room, get it out! Not only does that type of access
lead to time spent not being active, but it can also lead to a dependence on
TV at bedtime. Many kids stay up late watching their shows or movies, fall
asleep with the TV on, and don’t get a full night’s rest — making it harder for
them to be active the following day.
Playing It Safe Outdoors
In this chapter, we talk a lot about taking the family out of the house and into
the great unknown (which may be nowhere more exotic than your local play-
ground). Although physical activity is your goal here, safety is your very first
priority, no matter where you’re headed or what kind of activity you have
planned. Accidents are the leading cause of injury and death to children in
this country, so please take the time to make sure that you’ve addressed
every possibility whenever you take your child out of the house.
181
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

Common sense is usually your best instinct as long as it’s not coupled with 
a “That will never happen to my family” attitude. Here are some very basic
safety tips that you should enforce every single time your children engage in
a particular activity:
 Cyclists always wear helmets.
 Skateboarders also always wear helmets. Elbow and knee pads and wrist
guards are also advisable for kids.
 Swimming is only allowed when an adult is present. Nonswimmers wear
floatation devices when they’re near a pool or body of water.
 Use the buddy system when riding bikes or walking in the neighbor-
hood, and never talk to strangers. Of course, an adult should always
accompany young children.
 Hikers always carry a map of the area they’re visiting, dress for the ele-
ments, and let a third party know where they’re headed.
 Walkers walk facing traffic; cyclists ride with traffic.
 Children don’t ride bikes or walk from house to house after dark. Teens
and adults who are out at night wear reflective clothing.
 Kids need to inform a parent of where they’re headed (to a friend’s, over
to the playground, and so on) before they leave the house.
The great thing about your child becoming more active and confident is that
he’ll probably be busier — and that’s exactly when your safety antennae have
182
Part II: The Weight Is Over: Making Changes, One at a Time 
A little prep work goes a long way
Part of being safe is packing the appropriate
gear when you’re off on a family outing. For
example, if your family is heading out on a hike,
you need to dress them for the changing cli-
mate as you head up the mountain, and you
need to pack food and water, a map, sunscreen,
bug repellent, and bandages. Packing up the
bikes for a long ride? Same deal: Fortifications,
appropriate clothing, bandages, sunscreen,
bug repellent, a map if you’re headed off-trail,
and repair gear for use in the event of a flat tire.
Your motto should be, “Be prepared for any
event that’s in the realm of possibility.” It’s pos-
sible, for example, that your child could sustain
a scrape while on a bike ride, so you should
have some bandages handy; it’s much less
likely, however, that she’s going to need to use
the headlight on her bike in the middle of the
afternoon, so you can leave the extra batteries
at home. Get creative with your thinking, but
stay on this side of the sane parenting line.

to go up and stay up. These are nonnegotiable rules. Things that may be
negotiable are the time your son needs to come home from a friend’s house
or whether he’s allowed to bring a friend home for supper. When it comes to
your child’s safety, make no concessions. Expect the rules to be followed, and
enforce them to the very best of your ability.
Evaluating Your Child’s Physical
Education Class
If you pay fairly high school taxes, you probably assume that your child is
getting plenty of bang for your buck in his gym class at school, right? Well,
that depends on where you live and how your community feels about physi-
cal activity. In some areas of the country, physical education classes are dis-
appearing, while in others, schools are installing state-of-the-art gyms in an
effort to catch kids’ interest in exercise — and maintain it.
No matter how your school fares, there’s no doubt that, if done correctly,
physical education class can produce lifelong benefits, such as:
 Learning about working as part of a team
 Learning the old adage, “You win some, you lose some”
 Learning fitness skills that carry over into adulthood
A good physical education program emphasizes these lessons in an attempt
to enhance a child’s overall learning experience. In other words, gym class
shouldn’t be about taking a break from the school day; the lessons learned
there should carry over into the classroom and back home, also.
What to look for
If you’re unsure about how your child’s gym class compares to the physical
education classes offered by other schools, go in and observe the class in
progress. While you’re watching, ask yourself these questions:
 Are all the kids participating, or are only the most athletic kids 
having fun?
 Is the class actually learning something of value, or are they playing a
game of elimination (and humiliation) like dodge ball?
183
Chapter 10: Move It and Lose It: Getting Physical

 Is what they’re learning in any way relevant to a healthy lifestyle? In
other words, are they learning about a sport or game that they could
actually play outside of the confines of gym class?
The problem with a gym class that emphasizes games of extreme competition
and/or elimination is that the most athletic kids end up playing, and every-
one else ends up sitting around, waiting for gym class to be over. The game’s
great for the athletes, of course, but it’s a big waste of time for the other kids.
Gym class activities should be fun and fair for everyone. After all, the athletic
kids play their sports after school anyway. The kids who are most likely to be
turned off by these types of classes take home the lesson that physical activ-
ity is boring, humiliating, and something to be avoided.
How to take action and 
improve phys ed class
The number of gym classes available to high school students, in particular, is
dwindling because of the amount of schoolwork and other classes (such as
computer, foreign language, and college-level courses) that kids are expected
to complete these days. High schoolers may be required to take only one year
of physical education in order to graduate, which obviously doesn’t send the
message that physical fitness is important! Of course, academics are extremely
important, but teaching adolescents about the long-term benefits of a healthy
lifestyle is also vital.
So what can you do if your child’s school has a less-than-adequate physical
education program? Take your concerns to the administration. If the school
district simply doesn’t have the money to provide high-tech equipment (like
a rock-climbing wall or a weight room), think about becoming active in
fundraising for this purpose. Physical fitness is such a timely issue that
you’re likely to find a lot of support from other parents and businesses who
are more than eager to jump on the “Helping Kids to Become More Fit” band-
wagon (or whatever label you happen to choose for your efforts).
If, on the other hand, your main objection is to the types of “sports” the kids
are playing, then make that clear. A teacher who has a degree in physical edu-
cation can (and should) do much better by his or her students than forcing
them to participate in activities that end up with half the class sitting on the
sidelines. In this day and age, kids should be learning about ways to keep
themselves healthy, and they also should be exposed to activities that they
may actually want to take up in real life, like swimming, badminton, tennis,
and golf — not dodge ball!

O
ne of the hardest parts of weight loss is the 
maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. It’s just so 
easy to slip back into old habits, especially in times of
stress or boredom. In this part, we offer tips for helping
your child stick to the new way of doing things and
encouraging her continued success. We also talk about how
to find outside help if you feel as though you’ve done all
you can for your child and have seen less-than-encouraging
results or suspect that she may have an eating disorder.

W
hen you see your child succeeding in his or her weight loss venture,
you may be tempted to breathe a sigh of relief and think that you’re
out of the proverbial woods. You can feel good about the direction your child
is headed in, but it’s important for the entire family to stay tuned in to the
issue of obesity. Healthier habits should be a lifetime goal, not things that you
come back to only now and then to lose a few pounds.
Studies show that obese children (especially preteen and younger) who don’t
have full parental involvement and support are more likely to fail in their
attempts to lose weight and/or keep that weight off long term. An 8-year-old
can’t do the weekly grocery shopping, after all. He has very little control over
the rules of the house and what kind of food comes into it. If a child is eager to
lose weight but faces snack cakes and chocolate cookies every time he opens
the pantry, he’s at a disadvantage and has to work even harder. However, if the
child is clamoring for snack cakes but there aren’t any in sight, he just has to
learn to live without them.
Parents play vital roles in children’s weight loss — not just in jump-starting
the process but also in teaching them that weight loss isn’t a short-term goal.
It involves choices that we make about what goes in our mouths every single
day. Your attitudes about food and physical activity are contagious, so make

sure that you send the right messages to ensure that your child stays on the
right track toward weight loss and a healthy lifestyle. In this chapter, we talk
about how you can help your child by setting a good example with your
actions and your attitude toward this healthier-living venture.
Setting Realistic Goals for Your Child
You’d never do anything to purposefully hurt or discourage your child, but
expecting too much too soon in the way of weight loss can backfire. We’re
sure you’ve seen stories on television talk shows about people losing 100,
200, or 300 pounds over the course of a year, so you may expect your child’s
weight loss to come about relatively easily. After all, if you’re changing the
family’s diet and exercise plans, the weight should just melt away, right?
No. It took a long time for your child to become obese, which means that he
needs adequate time to take the weight off. Experts recommend a loss of 1⁄2
pound per week for children and 1 pound a week for adults (older adolescents
fall into the latter category). Did you read that correctly? Eight ounces a week?
Although that may seem like a pitifully small expectation, your child is far
more likely to keep weight off when it comes off slowly.
Don’t expect too much too soon
Quick weight loss is often attributed to water loss and/or the effects of what
amounts to malnutrition (see the sidebar “Beware fad diets”). You can’t cut
your child down to 700 calories a day and expect her to be able to function
normally. Sure, she loses weight that way, but you take two big risks:
 She’s hungry all the time, which means that, eventually, she has to give
into that hunger and eat whatever she can get her hands on.
 She may become ill, suffering from dizziness and exhaustion, experiencing
heart palpitations, and having difficulty concentrating.
Your goal is to teach your child to make healthy choices about food and exer-
cise that eventually become second nature to her. You just can’t accomplish
that overnight, no matter how badly you want to. So take things slowly, and
cheer her on every time the scale shows that she’s lost a fraction of a pound.
She’s moving in the right direction, and she’ll get to the finish line when she
gets there.
188
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Cutting your child’s caloric intake by just 250 calories per day is enough to
produce weight loss of 1⁄2 pound per week and significant long-term results. To
give you an idea of how much food you actually have to cut from your child’s
diet, here’s a list of some food items that contain approximately 250 calories
each:
 A full-size candy bar
 A 16-ounce can of sugar-sweetened soda
 Two 8-ounce glasses of sugar-sweetened juice
 A small bag of chips
 Three average-sized chocolate chip cookies
 Six chicken nuggets
 Three to four fried (small) mozzarella cheese sticks
 A small serving of French fries
 One regular plain fast-food burger
These are fairly average snacks, so you can see that it doesn’t take much to
start the weight-loss process. (Increasing daily activity is the other factor in
this equation and something we talk about in the section “Getting Everyone
Moving” later in this chapter.) By eliminating sugar-sweetened drinks from
your child’s diet, for example, you subtract more calories than you probably
realize. Do the math: The number of cans of soda your child drinks per day ×
250. If you’re shocked at the final tally, you should be more resolved than
ever to get the food issue under control in your home.
189
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss
Beware fad diets
Part of being a good role model for your child is
making the healthiest choices where food is
concerned. If you’re always jumping on the
latest fad diet bandwagon, stop. These diets
show very poor results as far as long-term
weight loss goes and even worse results where
nutrition is concerned. (You really can’t expect
to eat nothing but cabbage for a month and
have your body thank you for it.) More impor-
tant, don’t encourage your child to embrace fad
dieting as a means of controlling her weight!
These diets are designed for adults, not grow-
ing children whose daily nutritional needs are
very different and far more complex. You also
don’t want to send the message that there’s a
quick fix for her weight problem. Conquering
obesity once and for all requires long-term plan-
ning and permanent changes. She’s more likely
to learn how to keep the weight off if she’s well
versed in good nutrition and healthy foods (not
just cabbage).

When you eliminate one hidden source of calories, be sure not to replace it
with another. For example, at dinnertime, don’t replace soda with whole milk,
which is loaded with calories and fat. Skim milk is a much better choice; not
only is it low in calories, but it also contains calcium, which is an essential
nutrient for bone strength.
It may be easier than you think to make small changes in your family’s diet.
Don’t close your eyes to the obvious: Take an honest look at some of the
hidden calories your child ingests each day and eliminate some of them.
Paying attention to nutrition labels is a vital part of removing hidden calories
from your child’s diet; you can find out more about these labels in Chapter 8.
The beauty of helping a younger child through the process of losing weight is
that you’re the one controlling the purse strings. Learning to say no to some
of your child’s requests (or demands, depending on the child) is part of 
supporting her weight loss. “No, we aren’t having chicken nuggets for dinner,”
or “No, we aren’t buying soda anymore,” are just two phrases you can work
into your parent-in-control routine. And don’t waste time feeling guilty, even
when she cries that she simply can’t live without French fries. You don’t do
her any favors by allowing her to continue ingesting foods loaded with fat
and sodium. Remember, everything you do is intended to help her, even
though she doesn’t see it that way — or at least not yet.
Accept that setbacks happen
Don’t expect perfection from your child. We can’t say it more simply than
that. Either from personal experience or from watching friends or family
members struggle with their own weight issues, you know that losing weight
and sticking to a new diet and exercise regime can be tough for an adult.
Because kids are more adaptable and far less set in their ways than adults,
you may think that settling into new eating and exercising habits is easier for
them, but that’s not always the case.
Some kids accept change better than others. For kids who have come to
depend on food as a comfort measure or who have been settling down to
watch after-school cartoons with a bag of chips for as long as they can recall,
understanding that certain behaviors are no longer acceptable is a real chal-
lenge. Some days will be fine; other days, you may find yourself at odds with
your son when you spot what looks suspiciously like chocolate cake crumbs
clinging to his chin.
Don’t flip out if your child has ice cream or cookies at a friend’s house. An
occasional slip-up shouldn’t affect his long-term weight-loss goal. If he’s doing
well otherwise, let an isolated incident go without lecturing him about it.
190
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

What should you do when your child is losing weight at a steady clip and
then starts putting pounds back on? Take a minute to realize that your child
is struggling in some way. The pounds are obviously not reappearing by
themselves; he’s either consuming more calories or not getting enough activ-
ity, or both. Get his opinion on how things are going. Ask where he thinks he’s
having difficulty; maybe he just needs to find some activity he enjoys more
than what he’s doing now, or perhaps a friend offers him snacks when they
play after school, and he doesn’t know how to say no without hurting his
pal’s feelings.
Try to rule out the most obvious problems (which are, of course, a high-fat
diet and lack of exercise) before you start investigating other possible causes
of weight gain (see the sidebar “Keeping thyroid concerns in check”). Remind
him that you’re in this together and you’ll help any way you can. Ultimately,
especially in the case of an adolescent, he has to do the work. You can’t
always shield him from his generous (but misguided) friends, and you can’t
exercise for him. You can continue to encourage him without nagging him
about the weight, which is dangerous territory, especially where teenagers
are concerned. Weight issues are such emotionally laden topics that harping
on slip-ups can make things much, much worse; he may tune you out com-
pletely and do the exact opposite of what you suggest.
The worst thing you can do when your kid is regaining weight is to make a
setback seem like the end of the world. Your child is trying. Even though
you’re frustrated and anxious about what may happen to him if he doesn’t
get with the program, remind yourself that you’re the adult in this scenario
and therefore need to keep cool.
191
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss
Keeping thyroid concerns in check
Among parents of overweight kids, thyroid func-
tion is sometimes a source of major concern,
especially when it seems that a child is having
trouble losing weight despite his efforts. The
thyroid controls the body’s metabolism, so if your
child’s thyroid is somewhat sluggish and not
doing its job, then it makes perfect sense for
your child to be overweight. Correct the thyroid
problem and the weight issue will fall right into
line, right?
Sure . . . except more often than not, overweight
children do not have thyroid problems. Testing
the thyroid of an obese child is standard proce-
dure for pediatricians, but usually the findings
reflect that the thyroid just can’t keep up with
the child’s caloric intake. Parents looking to the
thyroid as a way to achieve a quick fix for their
child’s weight problem are sometimes disap-
pointed to hear that the problem is more com-
plicated. Reduced calorie intake and increased
activity levels are usually the most effective
cures for what ails an overweight or obese kid.

To deal with your child’s weight-loss setback calmly and rationally, acknowl-
edge these facts:
 Your child isn’t putting on weight to make you mad.
 Your child is just a child, with a child’s viewpoint. Even if he’s an adoles-
cent, he may not realize the seriousness of his weight problem and, by
extension, how serious backsliding can be.
 Backsliding is correctable if you catch it early and don’t make matters
worse by punishing him or belittling him for it.
Your best bet is to nip a backslide in the bud, so to speak. Brainstorm new
activities. Correct any errant eating habits. Offer helpful bits of advice. In the
case where a friend is supplying snacks, the solution may be as simple as
teaching your child to say, “I don’t want to spoil my appetite for dinner,” or,
“I’m really not hungry, but thanks anyway.”
Don’t say things like, “When you’re ready to lose weight, let me know!” or, “I
can’t help you if you’re not going to do what I tell you!” Continue with business
as usual, stick to your low-fat cooking and plans for more family activities, and
assure your child that you aren’t angry with him.
Laying a guilt trip on a backsliding child or otherwise turning the situation
into one in which he’s hurting you only serves to further damage his self-
esteem. This kind of reaction on your part also may drive a wedge in your
relationship with your child to the point where he stops trying to lose the
weight or decides he’d rather go it alone than deal with you at weigh-in time.
Either way, the weight becomes an issue that separates the two of you, which
leads to incredibly painful emotional wounds — for you and for him.
Remind your child how great you think he is right now and that you love him
just the way he is. Make it clear to him that you don’t want him to lose weight
so that he’ll be better looking or more popular but so that he’ll feel better
physically and emotionally. In other words, the weight loss should be all
about your child, not about your ideals of how he should look or what his
classmates want him to look like. Let your child know that you support him
in every phase of his weight loss (good and bad) and that you’ll see him
through to his goal.
Being Consistent and Supportive
Supporting your child through the long process of losing weight requires 
consistency, a skill that comes naturally to some parents and not so naturally
to others. Even if you know that you’ve been less than consistent in your 
192
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

parenting up to this point (for example, you tell the kids they can’t have a friend
over but then give in when they cry about it; or you tell them they can’t have
another bowl of ice cream but relent when they beg and beg), it’s not too late
to set a firm resolve now. Obviously, helping your child lose weight means
saying no to some of her less-than-healthy food requests, but it’s important to
remember that “no” means absolutely nothing to your child if she knows that
you’ll give in if she just keeps asking.
Chances are you’ve heard the timeworn advice: “Kids love rules. They need
limits.” Well, we don’t know that kids love being told what to do, but they do
need someone older and wiser to set limits for them. Most children can’t
institute and follow through on major lifestyle changes without at least one
parent helping them out, cheering them on, and leading by example.
However, even with an amazing support system, some kids are still reluctant
(to say the least) to stick with the changes associated with weight loss. Your
consistently positive attitude about a healthier way of life provides a stable
environment in which weight loss is more likely to occur. Remind yourself
that you really do know what’s best for your child, at least when it comes to
conquering her weight problem.
Making a permanent lifestyle change
This weight-loss project isn’t a temporary solution; it’s a lifestyle makeover.
Don’t talk to your child as though all he has to do is lose the weight and then
he can go back to eating snack cakes for breakfast and nacho cheese on
crackers for lunch. Make sure he knows that the days of sitting around eating
junk are over — for the entire family.
Weekends, holidays, and birthdays aren’t free passes to take a break from this
healthy new lifestyle. Healthful eating and exercise are regular parts of your
family’s life from this point on — this plan doesn’t have an expiration date. If
you hear your child saying things like, “I can’t wait until we can have fried
chicken every Saturday night again!,” or, “The first thing I’m going to do when I
lose all my weight is order a pizza all for myself!,” gently remind him that
those habits got your family into this situation to begin with and that you’re
all able to make better choices now. You don’t want to instill panic in him,
where all he can think is, “I can never, ever have fried food again. What is my
mother doing to me????” The goal is to kill his craving for that kind of food,
and that takes time. Hopefully, by the time he reaches his goal, your child
won’t still be dreaming of hitting all the fast-food places in town in one night.
Any kind of permanent lifestyle change is heady stuff for a kid, so it may help
your child to keep a weight-loss journal where he can keep track of how he feels
and how things are progressing. Writing down his feelings about certain foods
may help him sort them out and actually minimize his cravings. (If he’s really
193
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

expressive in his writing, for example, he may come to the conclusion that
although he loves fast food, it was harming him physically and emotionally —
and that realization may be enough to make him turn his back on it for good.)
A journal also can be a real blessing for an older kid who needs to be able to
look back on how far he’s come over the course of a long weight-loss journey.
It may be just the thing to keep him going when he’s midway to his goal and
feels like he’ll never get there. He can easily remind himself of his continuing
achievement and be proud of the fact that he’s already done half the work.
Setting a good example
Working on a weight-loss program with your child is not the time to fall back
on the “Do as I say, not as I do” defense, especially if you’re struggling with
your own weight issues. You can’t expect a child to tackle her obesity problem
on her own; she’s much more likely to succeed if she’s following your lead.
For example, she’s more likely to resist changes to her diet if she’s eating
steamed veggies and grilled chicken at dinnertime while everyone else enjoys
pizza.
Increasing your child’s activity level is another sticking point: You may have
the best of intentions when you tell her to go for a bike ride, but you’re
undermining yourself when you get in your car to drive three houses down to
visit your neighbor. You’re full of knowledge about how to help her lose the
weight; now show her that following through isn’t impossible. Even if you
don’t need to lose any weight, get on your bike and go for a ride with her, or
take her for a long walk in the park. If you’ve never been an active person and
she sees that you’re making a real effort to get out and move your body, your
actions will impress her more than anything you could ever say.
Setting a good example involves making changes throughout the household.
Convincing other members of the family to jump on this healthy lifestyle ride
can be difficult if only one child has a significant weight problem. Your thin
kids may present a very reasonable-sounding case, telling you that whatever
they’ve been eating hasn’t hurt them, so there’s no reason for their treats to
be curtailed (or for them to move their fannies off the couch). You know better
now, though. Tell them that scarfing down saturated fats and leading a seden-
tary lifestyle isn’t good for anyone, no matter how old they are or how skinny
they may be. Be the leader and take charge of your entire family’s well-being.
When setting a good example, do it in such a manner that your child takes
notice, but don’t constantly call attention to your actions. A child quickly
learns to ignore preaching about healthy foods and exercise, so live by 
194
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

example, give your child relevant information (such as what you’ll be having
for dinner or where the family will be hiking this weekend), and leave it at
that.
When your child realizes that the entire family is doing things differently now,
she’s more likely to accept healthful foods and activity as a natural part of life
as opposed to something she alone is being forced to do. You can see the dif-
ference in the mindset: If it’s a family affair, she’s just following along with
everyone else’s healthy choices; otherwise, she’s completely on her own,
and, as a result, she may be scared and resentful of being the odd one out
and less than eager to comply with the program.
Sticking with it when the going gets rough
Parents of severely overweight kids are sometimes faced with a kid who loses
interest in the weight-loss program or who finds it hard to accept the changes
that are expected of him. These reactions are to be expected. Like any major
life change, adapting to a healthy lifestyle can be tough and, at times, dull.
Don’t be afraid to shake things up when you notice your child’s interest
waning. Explore new, healthy recipes, for example, or introduce the family to
a fun new activity, like checking out your park’s bike trails or joining a family
swim program. Expose your family to the possibilities life has to offer in the
way of interesting food and enjoyable activities — things that they may have
been missing out on when they were parked in front of the TV for the last few
years. (For more ideas on how to keep your family’s attention focused on
healthy living, see Chapter 13.)
When your child is in a rough patch, resist the urge to throw your hands up
in the air and say, “Well, if you aren’t interested, we’ll come back to this when
you are.” You’re trying to be consistent, right? Teaching your family to make
healthy choices is undoubtedly the right thing, so don’t give up on them
when they start grumbling about whole grains and vegetables. You’re break-
ing them down, but your goal is to build them back up, stronger and more
confident of themselves than they were before.
Are your kids bored with the healthy choices routine? Let them pick their
own activities every once in a while. If they want to skip the family excursion
next weekend and instead play a game of soccer with their friends, let them.
They’re finding independent, kid-friendly activities, and they aren’t angling
for TV time (and you can’t ask for anything better in the way of progress).
Finding their own preferred activities is a huge step in embracing a healthy
lifestyle.

Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

Refusing to give treats for tears (or make
other common mistakes)
Following your plan has been easy, you say. You’re an organized person, so all
you had to do was create a healthy menu and an activity chart, and every-
thing just worked itself out. Except for that time your daughter cut her finger
and you had to give her a brownie before she would stop crying. Oh, and
there’s that time she fell and needed some ice cream to make her feel better.
And what about that time she ran right into the wall? A couple of cookies
helped to soothe those bumps, but . . . wow, is it possible that this weight-
loss program is making her clumsy? She sure seems accident prone all of the
sudden.
More likely, she’s too smart for her own good. If she knows the only way to
get a treat is to come to you howling in pain, guess what? She can come up
with all sorts of ingenious ways to feign injuries (at least let’s hope she’s
faking them).
Obviously, you want to make sure she isn’t really hurt. But even if she legiti-
mately skins her knee, a piece of candy can’t heal that wound. What does an
injured child truly need? Some medical attention if the injury is significant,
and some TLC from Mom or Dad (or Grandma, Grandpa, or Aunt Sue . . . who-
ever happens to be in charge).
Aside from the fact that she may be lying to you in order to score some
sugary treat, you don’t want your child to equate food with anything other
than hunger and nourishment. Like everybody else, she’s going to face hard
times sooner or later in life. Using food as a comforting tool is one of the
worst habits she can develop because it creates a vicious cycle of depression
linked to being overweight (which is caused by overeating . . . which leads to
being overweight . . . which leads to depression . . . which leads to more
overeating to comfort herself).
Other food messages to avoid include:
 “Eat your peas and you can have ice cream.” Meals don’t have to end
on a sugar-high note! Promises like this one reinforce the importance of
a super-sweet dessert rather than underscore the importance of eating a
balanced meal. Peas become a punishment your child has to endure
rather than a building block for a healthy body.
 “Let’s have a clean-your-plate club.” Even if you’re attempting to get
your kids to eat their veggies, let them decide when they’ve had enough.
Part of controlling one’s weight is recognizing the feeling of fullness,
something your kids are likely to ignore if they’re competing against one
another for “first-one-done” status.
196
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

 “You can’t leave the table until you’ve finished your dinner.” Your
child needs to be able to recognize his own inner physical feeling of
being satiated. Preparing a healthy meal is great; forcing him to finish
every morsel of it when he’s no longer hungry cancels out your best
efforts and confuses your child. (Should he eat when his stomach is
rumbling or when you tell him to? How will he know when he’s full if he
depends on you to tell him when he’s through?)
Just about every parent has used one of these lines at one time or another,
usually in an attempt to get kids to eat the healthy foods on their plates.
Knowing that these tricks can backfire in a huge way should be enough to put
them to rest for good in your own home. Focus on the good foods, but don’t
force ’em down.
Setting Mealtime Ground Rules
It can be difficult or darn near impossible for a child to lose weight and/or
keep it off if the rules of the house don’t support this venture. Skipping meals
and eating in front of the TV sabotage healthy-eating efforts. On the flip side,
getting everyone involved in preparing and gathering for a meal focuses
attention not only the meal itself, but on the family unit. This meeting of the
minds is an important step in the weight-loss process.
Successful weight loss is most likely to occur in households with lots of
parental involvement and support. Rounding up the troops at mealtime
allows plenty of time for chitchat about the day while simultaneously allow-
ing you to set a good example with your own eating habits.
Establishing family dinner nights
For years, experts in various areas of child development have lamented the
loss of the family dinner table, arguing that:
 Young children in particular thrive on the routine that regular dinners
provide.
 Sitting down together on a regular basis gives everyone in the family a
chance to talk about the day.
 Family dinners give parents the chance to model good eating habits for
their kids.
 Family dinners set the precedent for kids to prepare balanced meals for
themselves when they’re off on their own, in college and beyond.
197
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

We know that finding time to eat together (let alone cook an entire meal) is
hard when you and/or your partner work and your kids’ schedules are jam-
packed with friends, music lessons, and sports. But you need to do whatever
it takes to gather your family for dinner together at least three to four times a
week. Your obese child needs this kind of consistency and modeling in order
to learn long-term healthy eating habits; your other kids benefit from the
togetherness, too.
Rounding up the family for dinner several times a week may sound like an
impossible task when one kid has soccer, another has band practice, and you
regularly take conference calls during the dinner hour. Think about moving
dinner time to a later — or earlier — hour when everyone is able to sit down
and connect for 20 minutes or so.
Some parents are overwhelmed just thinking about plunking an entire home-
cooked meal on the table, especially if they haven’t done this before. If you’re
in this camp, start by concentrating on your main dish, and don’t fret over
how to prepare veggies and other healthy side dishes — yet. You can always
offer the kids raw carrot sticks with a low-fat dressing for dipping or pur-
chase salad and add a tomato or cucumber to the mix before serving it up.
When you get into a groove preparing dinners on a regular basis, you can
expand your repertoire to include more-involved vegetable dishes. Check out
Chapter 8 for useful advice about planning family meals and Appendix A for
recipes to try.
Obese children (and adults) often eat large portions of whatever food strikes
their fancy throughout the day. Planned mealtimes give the day structure as
far as food as concerned so that the whole family eventually understands
that they shouldn’t eat plates of food that amount to an entire meal unless it’s
an actual mealtime.
If your child is still hungry after he finishes his main course, steer him away
from a complete second helping by offering more of the vegetable side dish.
After all, veggie dishes are full of fiber, low in fat, and a great way to fill up a
stomach without adding a lot of calories into the mix. Fresh fruit is another
great choice for dessert for these same reasons.
Sticking around for breakfast
Adolescents, even those who have grown up in households with healthy
eating habits, routinely scoff at balanced meals. They delight in eating junk
and rebelling against their parents’ best intentions at mealtimes — especially
breakfast.
198
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Teenagers are apt to skip breakfast, either as a way to lose weight or because
sitting down to a bowl of healthy grains when you’re in high school just isn’t
cool. You can’t force a piece of whole-wheat toast down your child’s throat,
but you can mention to him how important breakfast is and that kids who
skip breakfast tend to drag through the morning and overeat at lunch. The
most you can do is provide the meal and set a good example. Make sure you
prepare yourself for the day by taking the time for breakfast before you head
out the door; otherwise, your words fall on deaf ears.
Interestingly, studies have shown that kids are more likely to eat healthy
meals if parents are simply present for those meals. You don’t have to hold
your teenager’s hand and help him operate the microwave so that he can have
his oatmeal in the morning. Rather, like the family dinner concept (see the pre-
ceding section), your presence makes the morning seem like more of a family
mealtime, even if the morning is all hustle and bustle in your home (as it is in
most homes with school-age kids). Of course, taking the time to prepare a
healthy breakfast for yourself makes the morning something of a follow-the-
leader event: You take the time to eat breakfast so your child will, too.
Turning off the TV
No TV (or computers, books, or anything else distracting) during meals can
be a tough rule to enforce, especially if your household includes TV junkies
of the adult variety (that is, you and your partner). Sure, catching the news at
dinnertime is a great way to kill two birds with one stone (and to hear the full
report about that poor little bird being assaulted with some sort of rock). But
think about what a distraction TV is: You know how hard it is to concentrate
on a show and talk on the phone at the same time, or how difficult it can be
to read a book when the kids have their cartoons blaring. The TV seems to
command all your energy and attention, and you have a fully formed adult
brain. Just imagine what it does to your kids!
Here’s what we know about TV and its negative effect on weight-loss pro-
grams and healthy lifestyles:
 TV is chock-full of commercials that encourage kids to eat unhealthy
foods.
 No one burns a significant amount of calories while watching the tube.
 Kids who watch a significant amount of TV (as in four or more hours a
day) are more likely to have difficulty making social connections with
their peers and other people.
199
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

Imagine what goes on in your child’s head when the TV is on. Her full focus is
on the show, right? So give her a plate of food and guess what happens: She
ingests the entire thing quickly, without ever speaking a word to anyone else,
and she probably doesn’t realize how much she ate or that she ate anything
at all.
The entire point of having a family meal is to pull everyone together and
make the meal meaningful. It’s a time to model good eating habits and to 
discuss — in context! — the benefits of certain types of foods. Sitting every-
one down at the table and turning the TV on goes against everything that
you’re attempting to accomplish.
Pediatricians recommend no more than two hours of television a day for kids,
and this time limit actually includes video and computer game usage. So if
you’re looking for a good way to cut TV out of your kids’ day, banning it from
mealtimes is an excellent place to start.
Having everyone pitch in
If you’ve never sat down to a family meal (not even when you were growing
up), you may feel funny about suddenly using the kitchen table for something
other than organizing the laundry and doing homework. And your family may
roll their eyes when you tell them how nice it’s going to be to eat dinner
together every night.
The best way to get your family used to the idea of family mealtimes and
comfortable with it as a normal part of everyone’s day is to get them involved
in the mealtime event. Here are a few recommendations:
 Let the kids help. Need to make a salad? Your 7-year-old can do it for you.
Let him tear the salad, and consider purchasing a hand-held chopper
(where the blades are all contained in a domelike device) so that he can
manage most of the veggie cutting, too. Involving kids in meal prepara-
tions makes them feel more a part of it and cuts down on your workload.
 Have your kids set the table for dinner. Forks on the left, knives on the
right, napkins at each place or in a big basket in the middle of the table,
if you prefer. Everyone needs a glass, and the serving dishes need serv-
ing spoons. Tell the kids what the meal is and let them decide what kind
of (low-fat) condiments to put out. If you have some particularly crafty
and/or eager kids, ask them to make place cards or fold the napkins into
creative shapes!
200
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

 Let imperfect manners slide — at first. Good behavior can be a very dif-
ficult part of learning to eat as a family. Be firm with basic rules (no
throwing food, no whining, no dancing on the chair) but hold off on
more stringent expectations (no elbows on the table) until your kids are
more comfortable with the structure and routine of family mealtime.
 Encourage conversation. If your family doesn’t sit down together on a
regular basis, you may need to plan what to say to each other until
casual conversation becomes a natural part of the process. Some fami-
lies go around the table and share the best thing that happened to each
person that day. It’s a good way to get everyone talking.
Don’t rush the meal; let everyone talk to their hearts’ content, even if
that means they take a break from eating their healthy dinner. Unlike TV
viewing, computer use, and reading, conversation isn’t a distraction
from the meal and actually enhances the experience of coming together
as a family. And if everyone ends up talking more and eating less, that’s
another benefit of friendly chitchat during dinnertime.
Family dinners should eventually evolve into a relaxed part of the day and
hopefully something everyone looks forward to.
Getting Everyone Moving
Getting the family out of the house and doing something active together on a
regular basis may seem silly if you’ve never done it before in your entire life.
However, your obese preschooler isn’t going to slim down all by herself (and
an obese school-age or adolescent child is going to need some help and
encouragement to get started, also). Like family mealtime (see the “Setting
Mealtime Ground Rules” section earlier in the chapter), family outings serve
a dual purpose: You bring the family together while teaching your kids that
activity isn’t harmful — in fact, it’s a necessary part of life!
Here’s the deal with family activities: Obese kids tend not to be very active.
As they get older, even if they want to participate in sports or other activities
with kids their own age, they’re often too self-conscious about their lack of
coordination and their weight to join in spontaneously (such as at recess).
And because they’re forced to participate in physical education classes at
school, where they probably fall far behind their classmates skillwise, obese
kids may equate physical activity with pure torture.
Boys in particular learn to socialize with each other through sports. Even
though today’s girls are more involved in sports than past generations, they
still tend to solidify their relationships off the playing field. Regardless,
although it’s certainly possible for a child to go through life without playing
201
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

football, soccer, lacrosse, baseball, or any other sport, it’s heartbreaking to
see a kid who so badly wants to play sitting on the sidelines and feeling out of
the social loop because of it.
So if you find yourself debating the merit of family activities, remember that
you want to give your children the basic skills to be able to keep up with
their peers when they need to (in gym class), which will hopefully lead to a
desire and enough confidence to join in on unorganized play (like recess or a
neighborhood game of kickball).
If your older kids grumble about having to give up time with their friends for
family outings, invite the friends along. The purpose of the outings is to make
activity fun; a friend actually may be very helpful in helping you reach that
goal, especially if it’s a child who really loves to be outdoors doing anything.
Most obese kids have at least one parent who is also significantly overweight,
so it’s probably safe to say that activity hasn’t ranked high on the family’s list
of priorities. Where do you begin if your family can best be described as totally
inactive? Start off small. Don’t attempt to conquer Mount Kilimanjaro (or
your local equivalent) on your first foray out of the house. Do something that
everyone will enjoy so that when it comes time for the next outing, you aren’t
faced with tantrums and complaints about how bored everyone was last time.
Also consider taking turns choosing what you’re going to do so that, at the
very least, everyone is happy on a rotating basis.
Here are some tips and ideas for getting your family up and moving:
 Walk. Walking is one of the best exercises for all age groups and activity
levels. Have the kids leash up the dog (he needs exercise, too!) and
explore your local park or nature trail.
 Dust that bike off. Biking is a low-impact exercise that’s perfect for fami-
lies looking for a fun way to increase their activity levels. (Be sure to set
a good example by wearing a helmet!)
 Keep it fresh. You’ll undoubtedly find that the family enjoys some out-
ings more than others, but you don’t want your favorites to become
stale. Explore new places and activities on a regular basis.
 Ban TV, computer, and video games on outing days. If your kids are
griping about going on a walk in the woods, they may stop if they know
that they’re not missing out on TV time.
 Bring along healthy snacks and water. Pack a backpack with enough
sustenance to get the family through your walk, hike, or bike ride.
 Be patient. You may be gung-ho to ride your bike five miles and chat the
day away, but your kids may not take to these outings as quickly. Take
your cue from them, and be encouraging but not overbearing.
Eventually, they’ll come around.
202
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

When you’re feeling more confident in your ability to get the family out of the
house and doing something physical, you can start getting more creative with
your activities. Take the family ice skating, go for a hike up that mountain, or
join your local YMCA and sign up for a family-swim program. And when the
children are ready, let them choose more independent activities, like a
Sunday afternoon of flag football with the neighborhood kids. You’ll know
you’ve done well by them when they’re confident enough to go off and play
with their peers. In the interest of keeping alive your message that this is an
active family, find your own preferred method of exercise and continue to
plan family outings at least once a month.
Sometimes going on a family outing just isn’t possible because so much
needs to be done around the house. The solution: Introduce your kids to
chores. Older kids can push the mower, younger children can help rake
leaves, and kids of all ages can help shovel snow. Work together, and show
them that hard work never killed anyone (well, no one their age, anyway).
Keeping Up with Your End of 
the Weight-Loss Bargain
After you get the family off on the right foot and things seem to be going
fairly well in the weight-loss department, you may be tempted to rest on your
laurels, but you can’t. Losing weight and living a healthy lifestyle is a lifelong
quest. It doesn’t have to be painful or dull, but it does take a certain amount
of vigilance, especially on the part of the person who’s planning the meals,
doing the grocery shopping, encouraging activity, and setting the good exam-
ple. (That would be you.)
Must you stand guard in the kitchen for the rest of time, making sure that no
one sneaks an unhealthy snack? Should you get a bullhorn to announce
morning exercise time? Only if your family responds well to these tactics.
Keeping yourself interested and engaged in the weight-loss process is a much
smarter way to lead the family toward a permanently healthy lifestyle.
Realizing you’re the key to 
your child’s success
We can’t say it enough: Children who are successful at weight loss have sup-
port at home. This isn’t a temporary project that you can toss to your child
for completion in a few weeks’ time. He needs you to be involved from the
beginning and to stay involved.
203
Chapter 11: Supporting Your Child’s Weight Loss

Think about how easy it is to slip back into bad habits. We aren’t dependent
on these habits for survival (even though it may not feel that way when we’re
longing for another drag on a smoke, for example). Imagine that food is your
bad habit — that’s what your child is faced with. He can’t just ignore his
temptation completely because he has to eat every day for the rest of his life,
and that means that he has to choose well every single day. He may slip up
now and again, and that’s where you come in, cheering him on in the right
direction, reminding him that one cookie doesn’t spell disaster, and making
sure that he’s doing what’s best for himself. That’s a parent’s job, after all.
You may wonder when an older child, for example, is able to conquer his bad
habit all by himself. When you see that losing weight and eating healthy
foods aren’t just chores to him but things he’s eagerly accepted, and when
you can see how happy he is to have shed his old skin, chances are he’s
almost there.
Keeping abreast of the newest info
These days, staying connected and up-to-date on matters of interest is so
easy. The Internet is filled with information on obese children, weight loss,
exercise programs, nutrition — just about everything you need to maintain a
healthy lifestyle and infuse it with new ideas every now and then. The USDA’s
updated food pyramid site (www.mypyramid.gov/kids), for example, is
entertaining, educational, and something that kids can navigate all by them-
selves. Parents can check out the American Obesity Association’s Web site at
www.obesity.org/subs/childhood for statistics, causes, and the latest
research information on childhood obesity.
Alternatively, if you’re just itching to talk to other parents of obese children,
ask your pediatrician or nutritionist about local support groups. (Because
childhood obesity is a growing problem in the United States, parent support
groups are more prevalent than they were years ago.) If you’re lucky enough
to find such a group, don’t shy away from attending a meeting and participat-
ing in discussions. You’re likely to hear different points of view on everything
from cooking to exercise (and dozens of other topics). You may be inspired
to try something new that will work well for your own family.

 Preparing kids for food-related peer pressure
 Evaluating school meals
You can set down all the rules you want, but if your child doesn’t have to
follow through on them when he leaves the house, you’re just wasting
your time. Because you’re probably like most parents and aren’t with your
child 24 hours a day, take some time to consider where and how your child
spends his time away from home: Is he in a day-care setting where he can
snack all day long (or are the snacks he’s given less than ideal)? Do your par-
ents stuff your children with sweets every time they visit? Are your child’s
friends undermining your best intentions by providing him with chips and
soda every day after school?
And what about what happens in school? You may assume that your child is
getting a healthy lunch every day, but very few school districts provide meals
that are low in fat and high in vitamins and minerals. Snacks at school are
another area where fat and empty calories sneak their way into your child’s
mouth.
If you’ve followed the advice in Chapter 8, you’ve taken control of your own
pantry and refrigerator. But your child’s faced with plenty of other opportuni-
ties to break your healthy-food rules each day. Although many of these oppor-
tunities are out of his control, particularly if he’s a younger child, this chapter
takes you through some of these situations and shows you how to teach your
child to make good food choices.

Advising Caregivers of the New Rules
You know it’s not easy to revamp the food and exercise rules in your own
home. It took a lot of effort and determination to even begin that major pro-
ject, but now that the plan is underway and your family’s moving toward a
healthier lifestyle, you can see that the work was well worth it.
Now how do you convince your mother and your babysitter of the same
thing? If you’re lucky, your child’s caregivers care as much about what’s best
for your child as you do, and, more important, they agree that your child
needs to start losing weight now.
If you’re not so lucky and are, in fact, in a more typical situation, you may find
yourself butting heads with your mother-in-law and pulling your hair when
you tell her for the umpteenth time that a healthy snack for your child doesn’t
consist of Tootsie Rolls dipped in peanut butter with a tall glass of sugar-
sweetened juice to wash it all down. So how do you handle caregivers who
don’t follow your family’s new program?
Feeding issues at day care
First of all, let us explain what we mean by day care: It’s the place you drop
your child off when you go to work. Obviously, we advocate selecting a
licensed day-care center for safety reasons: The center undergoes at least
minimal inspections, and workers are supposed to be screened for criminal
backgrounds. In reality, we realize that a lot of day-care situations out there
aren’t regulated by anyone, like neighborhood sitters and unlicensed day-
care centers. For the sake of this discussion, however, we lump all these care-
givers together. (For information on choosing good day care, check out
Choosing Childcare For Dummies, which is published by Wiley.)
Suppose your child comes home from day care bouncing off the walls. Is she
just imitating what she sees other kids doing, or is she burning off the sugar
fuel in her tank?
Identifying feeding problems at day care
One of the many benefits of losing weight is an increased energy level, and
obviously your daughter’s desire to act as a pinball in the family room shows
that she has plenty of vim and vigor. But if she’s not eating healthy snacks
and meals at day care, you’ll notice it in the following ways:
206
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

 She may still strongly crave sweets and fatty foods. Cutting these
unhealthy foods out of your family’s diet should eventually change their
palates. That’s not to say that your child won’t crave chocolate every
now and then, but the occasional craving shouldn’t feel like a need to
your child if she’s really off the fats and sweets.
 She’s not losing weight. If you’ve cut out all the junk at home and you’re
taking walks after dinner and she’s not losing, something’s up. She’s
probably getting extra calories somewhere else.
 Her energy level isn’t picking up. Sugar may act as rocket fuel to your
child, or it may make her drowsy and crabby. Healthy foods usually pro-
vide healthy side effects — that is, more energy and a better overall
physical feeling.
 She balks at your healthy snacks. If your child’s getting her treats when
you’re not with her, she won’t commit to this new plan you’ve come up
with. To her, those carrot sticks you’re offering are just a nuisance; she
knows she’ll get her chips tomorrow at day care.
The fact of the matter is that you can’t be sure what your child is eating at
day care unless you go in and check it out for yourself. But don’t rely on
someone else’s word (or on the word of your 4-year-old). Show up at snack
time and take a look at what the kids are eating. Yes, we know it can be very
hard to negotiate time out of the office and that a story about checking out
your child’s snack may not fly with your boss; however, you have to acknowl-
edge that everything you’re trying to do for her is probably going to fail
unless you completely remove the fats and sweets from her diet. Just take a
minute and think of everything you’ve done to ensure healthier eating and
more activity at home. It seems like a big waste if she can effectively take a
break from this lifestyle every day, doesn’t it?
If your day-care provider is licensed, she should be participating in the USDA
Food Program, which provides caregivers with detailed instructions on feed-
ing young kids and also cuts checks each month to reimburse caregivers for
feeding children healthy meals and snacks. Ask your day-care provider if she
participates in this program.
Getting on track at day care
At this point, you know what healthy snacks are and what they aren’t. So let’s
say you pop into your child’s day care and find her noshing on chicken nuggets
and French fries while sipping whole milk (only the most outlandish day care in
the world would give kids soda, but a high fat content in their lunches may be
207
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

par for the course). She’s as happy as a clam, looking forward to those home-
baked cookies on the counter for dessert. Meanwhile, your hair is standing on
end. You’d never allow this type of food!
Can you really hope to correct your chosen day care’s errant feedings?
Probably not. After all, the reason many day-care centers provide meals like
nuggets and fries is they’re cheap and easy and kids love ’em. The low cost of
the meals and their nonexistent preparation methods, in turn, keep the cost
of the day-care center down. And that’s the Achilles heel of working parents
everywhere — finding decent day care that you can afford. If your child is
otherwise safe in this place, should you make a big deal about the food?
Yeah, you should. Your child will not be safe from physical harm if she doesn’t
start to lose her excess weight — or, at the very, very least, stop putting it on —
right away. And you can’t expect either change to happen in a place where
she’s being fed the very foods that spell certain failure for her new, healthier
eating program.
So if you can’t insist that the center improve its mealtime standards, what
can you do? You have two choices:
 Talk with the director about your child’s nutritional needs and 
even offer to pack healthy meals for your child to have at snack and
mealtimes.
 Start looking for another day care. We suggest that you try a licensed
provider who’s required to follow certain dietary guidelines. If your child
is in unlicensed day care, you can’t force the care providers to feed your
child healthy foods. Licensed providers are getting money from the
USDA, and they have to prove that they’re feeding kids according to the
pyramid guidelines. It comes down to looking out for the best interest of
the child, and if that means switching sitters, then that’s what it takes.
The second option, looking to change your day-care arrangement, is better,
for this reason: Imagine you’re a preschooler, you’re in a familiar environ-
ment, and suddenly you’re eating differently from all your friends. You aren’t
allowed to have the cookies or even the same lunch as everyone else. How
well does that go over with you?
Some day-care centers are equipped to deal with specific dietary requests;
others aren’t. In other words, your child’s day care may accommodate your
low-fat, pack-it-yourself menu, or it may just feed your kid whatever she
wants when she starts whining and crying about it. There are different levels
of care, and although some day-care providers may truly love your child,
others may just go for the quick, keep-the-kid-quiet fix.
You may be tempted to look at this situation and say, “Hey, I’m the customer.
I’m the one paying the bills, this is what I want for my child, and the sitter or
208
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

center should cooperate.” But you also know how compliant your child is
likely to be when she’s not able to eat the same things as her friends. If you
think the change will be nothing more than a tiny blip on her daily radar and
your sitter will follow your wishes, then give the new system a try. If you just
know it’s going to be a fight — between your child and the sitter and between
the sitter and you — then difficult as it may be, you probably need to look for
new day care.
Being proactive about activity
In addition to food, another concern with day care is activity. Although most
young kids are naturally active, especially when put in a room with other chil-
dren, you want to make sure that your child isn’t allowed to opt out of physical
activity. If her group is going for a walk and she refuses, does her “teacher” allow
her to stay behind and play with clay with another group? Does her sitter allow
her to sit in the corner of the yard rather than play tag with other children?
Again, the level of care — and tolerance for an uncooperative child — varies
from center to center and from sitter to sitter, so check it out for yourself.
If you suspect that your child isn’t getting enough activity, talk with your
child’s day-care provider. Express your concern; explain that your child needs
to get in on the action for her health. Get the sitter’s take on the situation; after
all, she’s the one who hears your child’s reasons for not playing. If your child is
shy, for example, she may benefit from having a play date with a day-care pal at
your home, where she and her friend can connect and strengthen their bond
one-on-one (a bond that’s likely to carry over into the play yard at day care). If
your child complains that she gets too hot or too cold playing outside at day
care, send a water bottle along or an extra pair of socks. Try to get to the root
cause of her unwillingness to play and then correct it.
Breaking the news to cookie-pushing
grandmas
Dealing with your day care or sitter is nothing compared to dealing with your
own parents or — heaven help you — your in-laws. These people love your
child just the way he is; they want to know why you can’t just accept him
instead of trying to reshape him.
Addressing sensitive issues with care
If the relatives in question are also obese or very overweight, you may find
that it’s especially hard to ward off comments and questions that force you to
defend your parenting decision. In this case, your best intentions toward
your child can be perceived as a blanket judgment on anyone who’s heavy.
But don’t buy into this attempt at a guilt trip, no matter how skilled the other
party may be at laying on the criticism.
209
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

If you feel that you’re under attack, remind yourself why you took the reins of
your child’s eating and exercise habits in the first place: Not because you’re
concerned with the way he looks, but because you’re concerned for his over-
all well-being. Now that you’ve educated yourself about the long-term physi-
cal and emotional effects that obese children deal with, you can inform
others about the dangers of childhood obesity as well.
Even though you’re well within your rights as a parent to explain and defend
(if necessary) your family’s new, healthier lifestyle to relatives who are
actively working against you, resist the urge to preach to others about how
they should change their eating habits. You run the risk of turning others off
the idea of losing weight altogether.
As you well know, food and weight are highly charged issues; a suggestion
here and there (about ways to cut fat or a great new exercise program you’re
involved in) to your overweight sister or mother is probably all right, but con-
tinual chatter about losing weight and eating healthfully may only result in
your family members tuning you out. We know that you’re excited about turn-
ing your family’s lifestyle around, and you want to open everyone’s eyes to the
possibilities that a healthy life offers! The best way to get your message across
is by becoming a living example. When others see that you’re reaping the ben-
efits of a healthier lifestyle, they may be inspired to follow suit.
In any event, you’ve established a healthy program for your child, one that
simply can’t be disposed of when he’s visiting overweight relatives. One
sweet treat isn’t going to undo all the work you’ve done; however, if he’s at
his grandmother’s on a regular basis and you know that Gram serves your
child nothing but fried foods and sugary snacks, it’s up to you to put a stop
to it. Feed your child before he goes to Gram’s, or buy healthy snacks for
your child to eat at Gram’s house.
Take care not to offend an overweight relative. As bad as her eating habits
may be, she may not know any better. Also, she’s probably fairly set in her
ways, especially where food is concerned. Keep in mind that you’re not
trying to overcome her weight issue; your focus is on your child’s health.
Dealing with someone who blatantly breaks the rules
What’s worse than trying to sensitively deal with an overweight relative who
feeds your child junk food? A relative who doesn’t have a weight problem,
who thinks your obese child is adorable, and who sneaks your child
unhealthy foods not because she doesn’t know any better but as a means of
winning your child’s love.
In this situation, the gloves can come off. It’s one thing for someone who isn’t
well informed on the issue of obesity to feed your child fatty or sugary foods;
that’s like the blind leading the blind. A relative who purposely undermines
210
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

your authority and does something that’s actually harmful to your child is an
entirely different matter. That’s like tossing gasoline on a fire to watch the
pretty colors it makes. (In other words, it’s a dumb thing to do, especially
when your child’s weight problem is the fire. Everyone knows that fire can
spark out of control when conditions are right.)
Don’t worry about offending someone who’s deliberately working against all
the bad habits you’re trying to change in your child’s life. Lay down the law
as often as you need to. Just take care not to hash things out in front of your
child, lest he feel like his weight issue is the cause of a family rift.
Families are funny. The roles we all play as children never really change, even
when we’re adults. So if your younger sister is the one who’s slipping your
child candy when your back is turned, let her know that her childish behav-
ior is no longer acceptable and that you won’t tolerate it, especially when it
affects your child negatively. Mothers, in particular, sometimes have a hard
time letting go of their authority and try to run the lives of as many genera-
tions as they can get their hands on. If your mom is the offending cookie-
pusher, remind her that you are the boss where your child is concerned and
what you say goes.
Of course, in the end, you may find yourself doing battle over what seems like
a nonissue. After all, as the parent, you have the final say of what’s best for
your child. So why must your mother-in-law (or sister, or father, and so on)
feed your child foods that she knows you don’t approve of? The answers to
that question likely depend on so many things, from how she feels about you
to how she feels about her own weight, so don’t try to psychoanalyze her jus-
tification. Focus on what’s most important — the health of your child — and
don’t stand for any actions that will only confuse or harm him (and make
your job more difficult in the end).
Leading the way
Because you’ve reevaluated your entire household’s eating and exercise
habits, perhaps the best way to deal with nonsupportive extended family is
to invite them to your home for a healthy meal. Show them what you’re
doing; give them a taste of healthy food. Heck, if you can manage it, take
them along on an activity-focused family outing (but be careful not to expect
too much in the way of compliance, especially if they’re not particularly
active people).
Sometimes, the resistance you meet from family members stems from your
individual history with losing weight in the past. If you’ve tried and failed to
drop your own excess pounds several times, your family may not believe that
you’re serious about helping your child or that you’ll succeed in this venture.
However, what they don’t know is that you’re better informed this time
around, and more important, you have a child who needs your help. There’s
no better motivation than that.
211
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

Resist the urge to preach to your parents or siblings about your goals and
plans for your child (and for yourself). Allowing them to see how well your
child takes to this program may be all the incentive they need to stop fighting
you and to actually encourage your child along the way. At the very least, wit-
nessing firsthand the effort that you and your child put into his weight loss
should be enough to stop any deliberate sabotage.
Sticking With It Away from Home
When your family’s away from the controlled environment of home, you may
be tempted to take a break from monitoring everyone’s food intake and activ-
ity levels, but remember: Obesity doesn’t take a vacation — at least not for
long! Letting things slide for a week on vacation, for example, is the first step
toward diving headfirst right back into the problems you’ve worked so hard
to leave behind. Maintaining the new program takes vigilance and dedication,
even when you’re away from your everyday environment.
After your family truly turns the corner toward accepting healthy foods and
activity (as opposed to just following along with whatever you’re doing), it’s
much easier to stick to healthier lifestyle routines. No one bugs you to eat at
the Deep Fried Palace because, first of all, they know you’ll say no, and
second, they know how bad that food is for them. Until then, it’s up to you to
make sure that healthy habits are enforced on special occasions and when
the family is out of town.
Don’t take a vacation from 
your healthier lifestyle!
Ah . . . the sun, the sand, the ocean waves . . . you’re taking a well-deserved
break from the harsh world. Who’s this coming your way now? Oh, it’s the
waiter with frosty drinks on his tray. And there’s the all-you-can-eat buffet
stocked with corn dogs, fried cheese sticks, and bottomless tubs of ice
cream. Oh, what the heck? You’re all on vacation — let everyone live a little!
Not so fast. Loosen the rules a bit, and you’ll be sorry. Vacations are prime
weight-gain occasions for several reasons:
 People are eager to let others serve them, and they take whatever’s
offered.
 Resorts and cruise ships are often all-inclusive trips, meaning you can
eat until you burst (theoretically, of course).
212
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

 Vacationers are more likely to honestly forget what they’ve eaten
because they’re off their normal routines.
 For many people, vacations signal a time to lie on a chaise lounge and do
very little (aside from downing those cool drinks). Activity is out; rest is in.
“Well, so what?” you say. “Vacations only come once or twice a year, and we
want to enjoy ourselves!” While it’s true that most families have limited time
or opportunity to escape from the real world, vacation shouldn’t be an
excuse to gorge yourselves on unhealthy food. Imagine a travel agent selling
you that package: “Set sail with Silver Wave Cruise Lines and stuff yourself
with fattening foods! Eat till you’re uncomfortably full! Go to bed at night
wishing you hadn’t piled your plate so high! Lounge by the pool and feel your
waistline increasing day by day!” (Hmmm . . . if only there were more truth in
advertising.)
We’re not saying that your family should stay home for the rest of your lives to
avoid any possibility of falling off the healthy bandwagon. We’re only remind-
ing you that vacations require extra vigilance on your part because it’s so easy
to overindulge and slip right back into bad habits that may continue after the
family returns home. One little break could turn out to be a permanent vaca-
tion from a slimmer, healthier, happier future, and no one wants that.
Stay active
Don’t think of vacation as a time to do absolutely nothing but rather as a time
to broaden your horizons. If you’re headed to the tropics, take the plunge and
try scuba diving, or make sure the kids spend afternoons in the pool — playing
and swimming, not hanging out at the swim-up bar drinking milkshakes. Walk
on the beach, go sightseeing on foot, and take a guided tour up a volcano or
mountain. All this activity will make everyone hungry, so plan ahead for healthy
snacks. For example, fruit is readily available in warmer climes, and it’s fresh
and juicy, so don’t miss the opportunity to share it with the family.
Expose your children to as many new things as you can when you’re out of
town. You’ll keep everyone active, and who knows? You may open the door to
some lifelong interests they wouldn’t have otherwise discovered.
Avoid temptation
When it comes to mealtimes, skip the buffet! All-you-can-eat setups are just
that — setups for weight gain. No one needs to pile a plate high and deep,
time and time again, in one meal sitting. You don’t need all that food to sur-
vive, and neither do your kids. Because your vacation activities are likely to
leave everyone feeling famished, enjoy a piece of fruit or a salad before the
main meal. Not only do these snacks help to fill the stomach, they’re also
healthier choices than buttered rolls or greasy appetizers.
213
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

Something else to outlaw on vacation: the dreaded hotel mini-bar. Don’t even
open it. Most of the time, these refrigerators are filled with candy, chips, and
other snacks that the family doesn’t need. In addition, they’re outrageously
expensive, so you’re effectively paying exorbitant rates to make your family
fat. By leaving the mini-bar sealed shut and only providing your family with
healthy snacks, you eliminate a temptation that your kids may face every day.
If unhealthy foods are kept out of reach, their decisions are already made for
them. Skipping the mini-bar may be a good jump-start to healthy habits when
you get back home.
If the kids are crazy for room service, order the healthiest options. Look for
low-fat meats such as grilled chicken breasts. A plate of fried chicken fingers
doesn’t cut it as a healthy meal, even if the kitchen swears that they only use
white meat (which, unless it’s processed and fried, as in this case, is lower in
fat than dark meat). Fried is fried, and it’s no good for the family.
In theory, vacations can be a great opportunity for weight loss as long as you
don’t base your entire trip around what the resort or cruise ship serves for
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. If food has always been your focus when
it comes to vacations, change it. Center your vacation on activities rather
than food. Choose a particular cruise line because it sails to ports your family
wants to get out and see — not because it serves the best drinks and has
around-the-clock smorgasbords.
Making healthy choices when eating out
Meals should be about being together, reconnecting, sharing your views and
experiences. Don’t lose sight of that just because you’re eating in a restau-
rant. Encourage conversation, and you’ll find that everyone has plenty of
food left over for a doggie bag — after all, you can’t eat and chat at the same
time (or at least you shouldn’t — so here’s your opportunity to teach table
manners, too!).
You don’t have to be halfway around the world on vacation to be faced with
making healthy choices from a menu. Whether you’re eating at your favorite
restaurant or popping into the fast-food joint down the street, how can you
be sure that you’re choosing well?
The first thing to consider is portion size. Portions have gone haywire in this
country in the last decade or so, and what you get at the typical restaurant is
about twice as much food as you should have in front of you. Large portions
are one reason why many families have a skewed idea of how much food they
should be ingesting at one meal — they’re used to servers bringing them
large, loaded plates!
214
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

To combat portion problems, split an entrée with someone else in your party.
Most likely, you’ll find that neither of you goes home hungry (and the side
benefit is that you spend less money). If your child is hankering for some-
thing on the menu that no one else wants to eat, ask for a to-go box as soon
as the meals are served, and put half of her meal away for later. Although you
could just tell her that she can only eat half of what’s on her plate, removing
half the food from her sight leaves her with a smaller portion and ensures
that she won’t be tempted to continue eating long after her stomach is filled.
When helping your child choose from a menu, take care to stay away from
the following options:
 Fried foods: They’re essentially soaked in hot fat, which, aside from
exacerbating a weight problem, also clogs the arteries.
 Cream soups and/or sauces: These items are usually prepared with
heavy creams and butter, making them loaded with fat.
 Seared foods: They’re usually prepared with butter.
 High-fat condiments: Mayonnaise, tartar sauce, cheese sauce, salad
dressings — they’re all loaded with fat. Substitute lower-fat condiments
such as mustard, ketchup, vinegar, and low-fat salad dressings.
With salads, heavy-handed servers can effectively drown a bowl of good-
ness with several ladles of liquid fat. Instruct your child to order low-fat
dressing (oil and vinegar or vinaigrettes are good choices, along with
anything deemed “low-fat”) and to ask for it on the side. Even low-fat
condiments can become pitfalls if your child douses his food with them.
 Sodas, milkshakes, and juices: All three beverages are full of empty
sugar calories, and shakes are also loaded with fat. Low-fat milk or water
are better choices.
Going easy on the bread
You can probably remember a few instances of having loaded up on bread
before your entrée arrived (and regretting it). The bread basket isn’t exactly
woven with evil (after all, one roll should actually decrease your child’s hunger,
making her less likely to consume an entire plate of food for dinner), but your
child shouldn’t have license to eat its entire contents. One lightly buttered roll
(this means using one pat of butterlike spread — margarine is preferable to
butter, and plain bread is even better) before dinner should be enough to keep
her hunger pangs at bay, especially if you remind her to eat slowly. If her usual
habit is to have three or four rolls while waiting for her meal, she saves several
hundred calories by cutting back here.
215
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

Some families stick to a “no bread basket” rule in restaurants, passing up the
rolls as soon as they’re offered. This approach may be easier if your child is
still young because you can bring healthy, predinner snacks (like animal
crackers or cereal) along to tide her over until her meal makes its appear-
ance. If you have a teenager who gets really hungry before dinner (and who
would just die of embarrassment if you pulled some grapes out of your
purse), stick with the one-roll rule or, even better, encourage her to order a
predinner salad (with low-fat dressing, of course).
Turning to the light menu
Fortunately, many sit-down restaurants are coming around to a healthier way
of thinking (and serving). Try the “light” section of the menu, making sure that
what’s listed there actually fits the bill. (Some places still put items like chicken
fingers on their “light” menus, indicating that it’s a smaller meal than anything
offered on the regular menu.) Often, the light menu includes smaller portions
of grilled foods and sandwiches that can easily be made to order. (Grilled
chicken breast on whole wheat, hold the mayo and cheese? Sounds good!)
Light menus often include salads, too. Older kids, especially, may be inter-
ested in a bowl of lettuce topped with all sorts of food. Help your child
choose carefully here. Just because there’s salad somewhere beneath a pile
of chili and cheese doesn’t mean that it’s a low-fat, low-calorie meal. When
hidden from view by greasy (or fried) meat or encased in a fried tortilla shell,
the salad is nothing more than a fibrous accompaniment to junk food. Look
for a salad that’s mostly vegetables (what a concept!); if meat’s involved, it
should be grilled.
If you’re ordering your child a meal from the children’s section of the menu,
feel free to ask for healthy substitutions. Some restaurants offer kids a small
salad or fruit in place of fries, for example.
Dealing with dessert
When dining out, your best approach is to adopt a “no dessert” policy.
Remember, you’re trying to change your child’s palate so that she doesn’t
crave a syrupy-sweet ending to every meal. Many restaurants just don’t offer
healthy dessert options like plain, uncaramelized fruit or a plate of graham
crackers. Desserts also are usually fairly expensive menu items, so if you must,
use that defense to initially break the restaurant dessert habit (“Eight dollars is
too much money for a piece of cake!”). Eventually, all you’ll have to do is say
“no” to the request for dessert, and your child will know why — and accept it.
If you absolutely can’t get out of dessert (like if you’re dining with your
extended family, all the kids are having dessert, and you just know that deny-
ing your child a treat is going to backfire), split it between yourself and the
child or between two kids. Dessert portions are usually far too large, anyway,
especially for children.
216
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Finding good fast-food options
In fast-food restaurants, healthy choices certainly don’t overwhelm you.
However, you can avoid choosing the worst things on the menu, which
include anything fried, those heavy croissant sandwiches, and most breakfast
sandwiches (they’re often loaded with cheese and sausage). Triple-decker
burgers are also out. Soda? Out. Milkshakes? Out.
So what’s left that your child will actually eat? If your child eats grilled chicken
or salad, those are usually the healthiest options on a fast-food menu. If not, a
plain burger (no cheese, no mayo, no extra burger on top) is all right every
now and then, and in place of fries, ask for fruit or salad. Choose low-fat milk
or water rather than soda or a shake. Most of the time, kids are more inter-
ested in the toys that come with a child’s meal than they are in the meal itself,
so even if you can’t substitute something healthy for the fries, let him have the
toy, the burger, and the milk (and chuck the fries in the trash).
Don’t negate the benefits of a healthy choice by adding mayo or cheese to a
grilled chicken sandwich or heavy dressing to salad. Encourage your child to
use low-fat condiments like mustard on sandwiches and low-fat salad dress-
ing or vinegar on salads.
On Their Own: Preparing Children to
Make Healthy Choices
When you think about it, controlling what your child eats at home and in a
restaurant is relatively easy. (We said relatively — we know it’s not truly
easy.) When he leaves the house, you really have no control over what goes
into his mouth — especially if he’s older and more independent than a young
child. (For the scoop on food-related issues with young kids and day-care set-
tings, check out the “Advising Caregivers of the New Rules” section earlier in
this chapter.)
Sleepovers, play dates, and junk food
What the heck can you do to prevent your overweight preteen or teenager
from breaking all the rules when he’s at a friend’s house or even when he’s at
school? To start, he needs a solid foundation to stand on, and that comes
from you. While you’re helping him to lose weight, you also need to be edu-
cating him. Don’t spare him the details: Tell him why he needs to drop his
excess weight, and let him know that some serious health issues associated
with being obese can be prevented if the two of you start working together.
217
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

Avoid using health issues as a scare tactic to threaten your child into a
healthier lifestyle. That’s just traumatic, for one thing, and it may only make
him feel that there’s something wrong with him; after all, “normal” teenagers
aren’t worried about heart disease.
Common sense tells us that teenagers love to rebel and take risks. They’re
immortal, in their own eyes. They truly believe that health risks don’t affect
them, so very few teenagers are likely to say to one another, “You know, I’m
going to have some raisins instead of potato chips because I’m a little con-
cerned about clogging my arteries. High cholesterol can start doing damage
as early as childhood.” (Yeah . . . we’d love to hear that conversation play
out, too.) It’s fair to say that plenty of teens don’t adhere to healthy eating
standards.
So, logically speaking, it’s fair to assume that your preteen or teenager will
come across some peer pressure when it comes to eating junk food. When
he’s at a sleepover, for example, he’s bound to be faced with temptation.
There’s very little chance that his friends will also be snacking on carrot
sticks and apples all night long. Educating your child in healthful eating is
one thing; expecting him to educate others is quite another. Older kids just
want to be like their friends, which is the problem. Your kid doesn’t want to
be the one opting out of the junk-food frenzy!
Fending off peer pressure
Banning your child from social situations isn’t the answer to protecting him
from temptation; the last thing an overweight child needs is encouragement
to feel alone and different. Accompanying an older kid to parties and friends’
homes to check out the cuisine is even worse (talk about being different!).
Preparing him to ward off peer pressure is a much better approach. Consider
the following suggestions of things you can do to help your kid before he
visits the home of a junk-food junkie:
 Have him eat at home before he leaves. If he’s not famished, he’ll have
an easier time passing up unhealthy snacks. A full stomach is also a
good excuse for saying “No thanks” to a stack of cookies — he can
simply tell the truth: “I’m not hungry; I just ate.”
 Give him his own fun (but healthy) snack to take along. If your child is
going to be at a friend’s house for the entire day (or night), taking some-
thing to share is just polite. Even older kids get a kick out of animal
crackers. (Don’t believe us? Hand a couple of teenagers a box and watch
them bite the heads off the lions and the toes off the bears and laugh
about it.) If he arrives at his friend’s place with a healthy snack, he’ll
know that there’s something he can have when he gets hungry.
218
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

 Remind him about portion control. If he’s going to a sleepover, for
example, he’ll probably have to eat a meal away from home. You can’t
exactly go over to the friend’s house and cook a low-fat breakfast for the
boys, so remind your child that he shouldn’t load his plate up until the
pancakes tower above him, especially if he’s offered high-fat foods.
 Discourage mindless snacking. Video games, computer games, TV . . .
these are the “activities” teens commonly enjoy. Remind your child that
eating while lounging around is a bad habit and a bad idea for anyone
trying to lose weight.
 Tell him to take a football. Or a couple of hockey sticks. Or rollerblades.
Whenever possible, your child should try to be the one saying, “Let’s go
do something!”, even when he’s at a friend’s house. Added bonus: Other
parents love friends who drag their own kids away from the video
games. If he gets everyone up and moving, your child is likely to be
invited back.
When your child invites his friends over, should you let them have junk food
in the interest of keeping his pals happy? No. Don’t feel pressured to break
with your own routine for anyone. Different parents have different rules; it’s
that simple. If your child is embarrassed, let him blame you for the lack of
sugary, fatty treats in the house. It may be a lot easier for him to say, “My
mom is on a health kick. She won’t buy cupcakes anymore,” than for him to
say, “I need to lose weight, so we don’t have any high-fat foods in the house.”
Grading Your Child’s School Lunch
Schools have all sorts of protective measures these days. Drug-Free Zones and
Weapons-Free Zones surround the buildings where children spend most of their
days, so why no Healthy-Eating Zones or Junk-Food-Free Areas? After all, con-
suming fatty foods is a major long-term health threat, especially in this country!
Take a look at your child’s school lunch menu. You’re bound to find chicken
nuggets, cheeseburgers, hot dogs, French fries, macaroni and cheese, and
pizza, among other things. You may as well be feeding your child at a fast-
food restaurant every day. Find a few minutes to take a walk through your
child’s school’s cafeteria. Are there vending machines in sight? What’s in
them? They probably aren’t stocked with fruit and mineral water but rather
with candy, chips, and soda.
The National School Lunch Program is responsible for feeding hundreds of
thousands of schoolchildren around the country every day. The average
parent may assume that the kids are being well taken care of in the cafeteria
because schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program have
to serve meals that adhere to specific dietary guidelines:
219
Chapter 12: When You Can’t Be There: Conquering Tempting Scenarios

 No more than 30 percent of calories from fat
 Fewer that 10 percent saturated-fat calories
To find out if your child’s school participates in this government program,
simply call the school and ask. Schools that don’t participate in the program
are more likely to have even more unhealthy options (like fast food vendors
right in the cafeteria) as a means of cutting costs.
However, many school lunches come processed and ready to be opened,
warmed, and fed to the children. You can bet that these foods have fairly high
levels of saturated fat to improve taste and shelf life. Most schools also only
offer whole or 2 percent milk in their cafeterias. The bottom line regarding
school lunches is this: Although the meals may adhere to government guide-
lines, they could be so much better if they included fresher, greener, truly
low-fat options.
The real danger in the cafeteria lies in the a la carte items, like ice cream
treats, chips, and soda. These empty-calorie foods do little except make chil-
dren overweight. The treats, which are sold separately from the school
lunches, are a major source of income for schools, which explains why
they’re within your child’s reach.
To find out the nutritional breakdown of your child’s school lunch, take the
menu to a nutritionist. With a little time, she can evaluate the calorie count of
each meal and snack.
Is it impossible to change the way your child’s school feeds its pupils? Stranger
things have happened, but your voice is more likely to be heard if you can
gather up a group of concerned parents before bringing the issue before the
school administration. Keep in mind that the National School Lunch Program
provides low-cost or free breakfasts and lunches to students who otherwise
may not have a morning or noontime meal, so your school district’s reluctance
to drop the program in favor of healthier (and more expensive) options may
legitimately be out of concern for its less fortunate pupils.
220
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 
Cafeterias go green
Some schools have adopted healthy, green
cafeteria practices. Organic, naturally low-fat,
high-fiber, pesticide-free foods make up the
menus in these lunchrooms. In fact, some of
these schools actually have gardens on the
school grounds in which the produce for the
school lunches is grown, picked, and sent
straight into the kitchen. What a way to teach
kids how easy it is to grow and eat healthy
foods! As of this writing, most of these schools
are located in the western United States, but the
trend is growing.

So what can you do to help your child eat healthier at school? Let her choose
one day a week to buy the school lunch, and make her a healthy lunch from
home the other four days. (For tips on packing healthy lunches, check out
Chapter 9.) Often, you have no control over how your child spends her lunch
money. For all you know, your already overweight child could be purchasing
an entire school lunch and four ice cream treats for dessert! When she
chooses to buy lunch, send enough money with her to cover the cost of the
meal — no extras.
No matter how young your child is, encourage her (with a little guidance,
especially for the youngest kids) to make her own healthy choices at meal-
times, whether she’s packing a lunch or purchasing one at school. If you pack
her lunch in an effort to make low-fat eating as easy as possible for her, she’s
not really learning anything except that a nutritious meal magically appears
in her lunchbox every day. Remember, your ultimate goal is for her to make
healthy choices all by herself, and that’s something she can learn to do best
through hands-on experience.
Don’t send your child to school with loads of money! Granted, you can’t do
much to prevent your teenager from spending her own cash on soda at
school, but you can keep money for treats out of the hands of a younger
child. And no matter what your child’s age, if the school has a prepaid lunch
account system, don’t put extra money in it! Often, you have no control over
what that money buys.

 Countering your child’s arguments against healthy changes
 Responding effectively when your child ignores the weight-loss plan
T
he heartbreak of obesity and all its associated problems are enough to
make a parent cry. But doing your best to improve your child’s health
when he seems to have no intention of following your lead can be incredibly
frustrating and result in your abandonment of the whole thing. While it may
be an understandable reaction, throwing in the towel is obviously bad news
for your child’s future.
Convincing a reluctant child to join the healthy parade that’s marching
through your home isn’t just something you should do, it’s something you
must do. It’s simply what’s best for him. The alternative — his remaining
obese, or worse, putting on more weight — is fraught with danger. As we say
throughout this book, the best way to guide your child toward a permanently
healthier lifestyle is to lead by example. So even if your child isn’t jumping for
joy at the thought of hitting the pool for some swimming or cycling around
the block after dinner, his attitude doesn’t let you off the hook.
In addition to being a coach, you’re also a full-time cheerleader in this weight-
loss game (although you aren’t required to wear the skirt, wave the pompons,
and smile incessantly). Obesity is certainly a cosmetic issue, but some of the
most serious ramifications of carrying around excess weight can’t be seen.
Finding ways to remind your child of what’s at stake — his health and his
future — without getting sucked into argument after argument is essential to
his success (and your sanity).

Shooting Down Arguments 
Before They Arise
Some children are naturally eager-to-please and ultracompliant (these kids
usually don’t even need to be told to do something; they just know what
needs to be done and do it), while others must question every order they’re
given (“Why should I clean my room? It’s just going to get dirty again” or,
“Wash the dishes? Why can’t we just use paper plates?!”). In some cases, 
personality styles are the result of how a child has been parented, but more
often than not, kids are born with a certain temperament, and you can do
very little to change it. If you have more than one kid and notice significant
differences in each child’s outlook on life, you know what we’re talking about.
Even if you’re fortunate enough to be dealing with a compliant child while
establishing healthy guidelines in your home, you may still run into some
problems with her adherence to a weight-loss routine. She wants to be
healthy, but the process is long, slow, and sometimes arduous. In addition,
your child has come to associate food with reward, and no matter how hard
she works at this program or how much weight she loses, she knows a 
chocolate-covered, marshmallow-filled treat isn’t waiting for her at the end.
Her desire to have sweet, salty, and/or fatty foods will hopefully wane over
time (after all, one of the main goals of this whole program is to change her
taste and overwhelming desire for goodies). But there’s little you can do to
speed up the weight-loss process, and that fact can be disheartening for even
the most upbeat, enthusiastic child.
The ideal amount of weight loss for children is about 8 ounces a week,
which means that you won’t start to see a physical change in your child for a
significant amount of time after you start a low-fat diet and exercise program.
Although you may have the patience to wait for these lasting results, your child
may become frustrated almost from the get-go when she’s weaning herself off
her favorite treats, increasing her activity, and seeing little in the way of
results.
So how do you handle a child who isn’t wholeheartedly onboard with the
new healthy lifestyle? You don’t want to set up a battle of the wills with a
child of any age, of course. Remind yourself that you’re the adult and she’s
the child. Then explore the following strategies for easing the transition,
anticipating and preventing your child’s resistance to the changes you’re
making, and getting your child back in the game.
224
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Remove temptation from the house
The argument: “You let Jack and Emily and Dad eat all the cookies they want,
so why can’t I?”
Expecting your obese child to keep his hands out of a cookie jar filled with
treats for you, your spouse, and your other kids is both unfair and unrealistic.
By the time a child reaches an obese state, he’s developed bad eating habits
and insatiable cravings. Keeping unhealthy foods in the house is like leaving a
pack of smokes in the nightstand of a person who’s suffering from lung disease.
Your child may legitimately yearn for his next candy or chip fix, and because
he thinks the damage has already been done, he may figure there’s no sense
in not indulging himself.
Because he’s already obese and feeling lousy physically, and because it may
seem very unlikely to him that he could ever lose the weight, your child
really can’t see the harm in continuing down the same path. And because he
may also be feeling isolated and depressed, food may be his sole source of
comfort. You know that adopting a new, healthy lifestyle can change a lot of
his negative feelings about himself and the future — but he’s just a kid. He
doesn’t have an adult’s perspective on life. All he knows is what’s happening
here and now, and as far as he’s concerned, it ain’t all that great.
Keep telling yourself and your child that the health risks and long-term impli-
cations of obesity are very serious and that your child still has a shot at a
healthy, normal future if the two of you can work together now to lose the
weight. This reassurance can be incredibly helpful when you’re dealing with a
child who doesn’t necessarily appreciate what you’re trying to do for him.
To keep your overweight child on track, your entire family has to be involved
in a healthier lifestyle. You can’t keep fruit pies and soda in the pantry for
your average-weight daughter while you dole out skim milk and pretzels to
your obese son. Even the most agreeable obese child will have a hard time
accepting this arrangement, which in the end is only another reminder that
he’s different from everyone else. Clean out the pantry, clear out the fridge,
and either toss or donate any food that’s high in fat, high in sugar, or both. In
particular, get rid of the following:
 Juice: Frozen cans of juice concentrate are nothing but water and sugar,
for the most part, and sugar is just an empty-calorie food. Excessive
amounts of sugar in the bloodstream of obese children is also thought to
play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes (because the pancreas
just can’t keep its production of insulin high enough to meet demand).
225
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program

 Soda: Each time your child drinks a soda, she’s not getting any nutrients
at all — just a bunch of sugar. Soda also rots the teeth; if a child has
plaque on her teeth, the carbonation from the soda can cause a sort of
chemical reaction with that plaque and eat away at the tooth’s enamel.
(Even diet sodas can cause this type of erosion.)
 Whole milk: Some dairy foods are fine, and for healthy bone development,
calcium is a necessity in a child’s diet. But skim milk has everything
whole milk does — except a lot of extra fat. Pediatricians recommend
keeping toddlers on whole milk or formula until the age of 2 (because
they need the fat for brain development); after that age, however, you
should replace whole milk with skim.
 High-fat condiments: Your child may be crazy about veggie wraps for
lunch, but if she’s covering her sliced carrots and tomatoes with high-fat
salad dressing, she’s adding unnecessary fat to her meal and sabotaging
her own best intentions. In addition to regular salad dressings, eliminate
regular mayo, dips, and high-fat sauces from your home. Grilled chicken
smothered in a high-calorie honey-mustard sauce hardly counts as a
truly healthy meal.
 White bread: Your child should get used to eating whole grains, which
are full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. White bread just can’t hold up to
the nutrients offered in a loaf of whole grain. The same holds true for
pasta — whole-grain pastas are better, nutritionally speaking.
 Sugared cereals: Even the most innocuous-looking cereal (such as
frosted wheat squares and frosted corn flakes) can be a sugar-laden
choice. Whole grains are where it’s at — plain oatmeal with fresh fruit is
a very healthy and delicious breakfast.
 The obvious treats: Cookies, candy, chips . . . you know the drill. They’re
chock-full of sugar, fat, and salt — none of which your child needs.
 And the not-so-obvious treats: Replacing regular cookies and chips with
low-fat alternatives may sound like a good option, but it’s actually not
the best idea. One problem with low-fat cookies and chips is that they
taste too much like the real thing, so they aren’t helpful at all in changing
your child’s craving for sweets and salty, high-fat snacks. You want your
child to eventually choose healthier foods, like fruits, for snacks and
desserts.
After you clean out your fridge and pantry and your child says, “There’s nothing
good to eat!,” how do you respond? Offer up skim milk, fresh fruits and veggies,
plain yogurt (and by “plain” we mean yogurt that doesn’t come with cookie
stir-ins), low-fat cheese, juice without added sugar, skim-milk cottage cheese,
eggs, fish or chicken from last night’s dinner, whole-grain cereals and breads,
and low-fat, low-sugar treats like animal crackers and pretzels. Surely, your
child can survive on these foods, right?
226
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Absolutely. Even if she gives you a hard time, whining and complaining that
there’s nothing to eat, you can breathe a sigh of relief, for the moment. You’ve
eliminated temptation at home, so she’ll just have to eat whatever’s on hand.
(Chapter 8 offers plenty of additional ideas for healthy snacks to keep on hand.)
Set a good example
The argument: “You haven’t changed the way you eat, and you watch TV all
day long. Guess that means I can follow your lead, Mom [or Dad].”
Eating well and working exercise into your daily routine are two important
things you can do to ensure your child’s successful weight loss. In order to
help your child lose weight, you have to know whether the foods you’re offer-
ing her are at all palatable, and you can’t know that unless you eat them, too!
You can’t convincingly sell her on the idea of a baked apple for dessert if
you’ve just eaten a package of cookies hidden in your closet. (And lest you
think that being forced to eat cookies in a closet is the extent of your sacri-
fice, it isn’t. Check out the sidebar “Just say ‘no’ to a secret stash.”) You have
to join in the program; you have to live it — and live it in a credible manner.
You may find it difficult to adjust to healthier eating if you aren’t overweight
yourself. Remind yourself that eating high-fat and high-sugar foods can lead
to major health issues like heart disease, even in thin people.
Eating together
Preparing a healthy dinner for the family tells your child that you’re all in this
together. Picking at the food on your own plate (without ever raising a forkful
of salad or fish to your own lips) while you encourage her to eat her healthy
meal sends an entirely different message: She needs to eat these foods, but
you don’t.
227
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program
Just say “no” to a secret stash
Avoid the urge to keep your own stash of good-
ies around, reasoning that you aren’t the one
with the weight problem. Chances are, you’ll
slip up at some point: Your child will be able to
smell chocolate on your breath, or she’ll see you
with a piece of candy — and what a betrayal
that will feel like to her! Also, by keeping a
hidden bag of candy in the house, you risk your
child’s discovery of these treats. Add her anger
at your “cheating” to her frustration at being
denied her own treats, and she may just sit
down and consume the whole thing.

Refusing to change your own less-than-healthy eating habits almost guaran-
tees that your child will fail to embrace the newest options on her plate.
Remember, although an older child may seem mature enough to truly under-
stand and appreciate the logic behind switching to a low-fat diet, watching
the rest of the family indulge in a high-fat, high-sugar diet is a bitter pill for
her to swallow. You can’t continue to eat burgers and fries in front of her and
convince her that eating unhealthy foods can lead to serious health problems
in years to come.
When you feed your child healthy foods while you continue to eat high-fat
fare, you set up a serious credibility issue for yourself. When your child cries,
“Hypocrite!” she has a point. No matter how skilled a debater you may be,
you’ll have a hard time counteracting her argument that if you’re eating that
food, then it can’t be all that bad.
Moving together
Fitting exercise into an otherwise jam-packed day may be difficult, but you
can’t expect an obese child to get moving all by herself. Even if she’s highly
motivated at first, that excitement may fade over time, and that’s where
family support comes into play. Planned activities ensure that your child
knows what she will be doing, where she’ll be doing it, and with whom.
For a younger child, lead the way by taking her outside and playing with her.
If you haven’t played with a child since you were one, some activities to con-
sider include:
 Tag
 Kickball
 Soccer
 Bike rides
 Foot races in the yard or driveway
 Walking the dog
 Walking to a friend’s home
Fun stuff? You bet! All these activities get the two of you off and running with-
out thinking about how hard you’re working. Make sure that you allow your
child as many water breaks as she needs, and concentrate on making out-
door play as enjoyable as possible so that when you call her outside after
lunch every day, she won’t kick up a fuss.
An obese teenager will probably refuse to play a game of tag with you in the
yard (and who can blame her?). If she seems to lack direction in choosing an
228
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

exercise she enjoys, suggest something the two of you can do together — at
least initially. Embarking on this part of the program alone can be very scary for
an overweight adolescent because she’s naturally self-conscious and not in top
physical form. Suggest low-impact exercises that are easy on the joints, like:
 Walking
 Swimming
 Biking
These activities are easy to do in pairs (just you and her) or with the rest of
the family. They’re also easy enough for beginners while leaving lots of room
for gradual improvement. You and your teen may start out walking just one
mile, for example, but as your stamina increases, you’ll find yourselves cover-
ing twice the distance in the same amount of time.
Starting a fitness routine isn’t easy. If your child tries an activity and comes
away feeling as though it was a disaster, she won’t be eager to try again. If
you’re not a regular partaker of exercise, let her know that you understand
how she feels. Then give her some helpful suggestions, like walking in a park
instead of on a busy road where she’s more likely to feel as though people are
watching her. And go with her. If she doesn’t want to talk, let her wear her
headphones.
Getting physical and showing your child that you’re as committed to finding
fun activities and getting fit as she is reassures her that she isn’t in this all
alone. Buddying up to walk or swim together is a great way for both of you to
stick with a program because you know that you’re going to hold one another
to your exercise “dates.”
Focus on other traits
The argument: “I’m sick and tired of talking about my weight!”
Adapting to a healthy lifestyle can be all consuming. Changing the way the
family eats and exercises affects so many aspects of everyone’s regular rou-
tine that, for a while, it may be all the family can talk about (for better or for
worse).
Concurrent with the discussion of food and exercise, the topic of your child’s
weight may be front and center, and that’s completely understandable when
you’re starting to make major changes. After time, though, you need to make
sure that your child’s weight isn’t the only thing you ever discuss with him.
229
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program

When your child begins his weight-loss program and is weighing in each
week, you’ll naturally talk about how well he’s doing and areas in which he
feels he may be struggling. Discussions about the grocery list or ideas for
dinner over the course of the following week are a normal part of everyday
life in almost every house. They’re fair game — for now.
But you don’t want to make your child’s weight the center of attention after
you get the healthy lifestyle ball rolling. He’s more than an obese child; he
has other traits aside from being overweight, so talk about those. This may
be easier said than done if your child seems to have no interests outside of
watching TV and snacking. Many overweight children aren’t involved in any
extracurricular activities, which is part of their weight problems. They need
to fill their time with healthy habits, like music, art, or sports, instead of
spending their afternoons in front of the tube. Encourage your child to find
some other interests, either at school or in the neighborhood. He’ll come to
see himself differently when he’s involved in multiple activities, and as a
result, he’ll be far less likely to fall back into his old habits.
In some homes, weight has been the central topic for so long that no one can
think of anything else to talk about. If this is the situation in your house, it’s
time to find something to do — and then talk about that. Here are some ideas
to get you talking about other topics:
 Play a game together — inside or outside.
 Go visiting to a friend’s house.
 Ask your child about school, friends, his hobbies, or a good book he’s
reading.
 Talk about goals for his healthier future: Does your child want to learn
to ski next winter? Is he looking forward to making an academic honor
society?
The great thing about entering into a healthy lifestyle program together is
that it gives your whole family the opportunity to get know each other all
over again. Start by making sure that the conversations at the family dinner
table focus on the day’s events rather than your child’s size and shape. (For
more about family meals, turn to Chapter 11.)
Promote harmony at home
The argument: “You’re too hard on me! You want me to be like my perfect
skinny sister [or brother]!”
Being obese isn’t easy in a culture obsessed with thinness and beauty, and it
can be even more difficult to be extremely heavy in a family obsessed with
230
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

weight and appearance. This book advocates getting the entire family
involved in a healthier lifestyle, but concentrating on one child’s weight prob-
lem while holding his thin sibling up as an example of ideal thinness is not
conducive to a supportive weight-loss atmosphere. Comparing children is
one of the most hurtful things a parent can do, even if it’s not done with
malice. The differences between a thin child and an obese one are stark
enough, and no one needs to point them out.
Some parents compare their children to one another as a means of creating
good-natured competition and lighting a fire under everyone to see who can
do their best in any given situation. Grades, behavior, neatness . . . nothing
seems to be off limits in these households. Some families may thrive in this
type of competitive environment, but most often, siblings end up resenting
one another for making their own lives difficult. Even the child who’s hailed
as the brain of the family may come to feel as though she’s sick and tired of
playing that role. In extreme cases, a child may shut down and decide that
she’s no longer going to be whoever it is that her parents and siblings think
she is.
Your intentions for using one child as a model of the ideal body may be good,
especially if there’s no preexisting tension between the siblings. If your
younger, obese child really looks up to her thinner sister, for example, then
perhaps you figure that using the older child as an inspirational tool can only
help matters. But the younger child already wants to be like her sister, so
there’s no need for you to push the matter any farther.
Each child needs to feel special and loved for who she is regardless of her
weight. By pitting a heavy child against a thin one, either by saying “Your
sister doesn’t eat two sandwiches; and neither should you,” or “Look how
skinny your sister is; if she can do it, you can too,” you create distance
between your kids. And during this period of weight loss, your obese child
needs all the support she can get. No matter what her relationship is with her
siblings, she doesn’t need to feel singled out and separated from them.
Pointing out another child’s weight to your obese child may send the mes-
sage that you want her to be just like her sibling in every way — and that’s
never going to happen. In fact, the heavy child may end up feeling disap-
pointed (or feel as though she’s disappointed you) when she drops the
weight only to discover that she’s exactly the same person she’s always been,
only lighter. (And if she doesn’t lose the weight, that feeling of having disap-
pointed you will be magnified.)
Comparing your children also harms your relationship with your overweight
child. When she hears you praising another child’s traits — and knocking her
down in the process — she gets scared of disappointing you or angry at you
for humiliating her. Or both. Either way, she’s less likely to view you as a
source of unconditional support, and that’s what she really needs from you
throughout this entire weight-loss process.
231
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program

Even if you’ve used comparisons of the kids to some success in the past,
weight is off-limits! The possibility of long-term emotional wounds is just too
great and could prevent your child from ever feeling good about how she
looks.
Reining In Those Sneaky Little Devils
Suppose you’re a little surprised at how well your child has adapted to the
changes in your household. He isn’t at all upset about packing a salad for his
lunch, and he readily accepts the no-more-soda rule. Maybe this weight-loss
thing is going to be easier than you thought. Maybe you were worried for no
reason. Things couldn’t be going any better.
And then you find a candy bar wrapper in the washing machine and an empty
soda can under his bed. After the initial shock of this active deception wears
off, you feel your blood pressure rising. Haven’t you told him time and time
again how dangerous obesity is? Doesn’t he understand that the whole family
has made lifestyle changes in an attempt to help him overcome his weight
issues? Doesn’t he want to get healthy and feel better?!
Weight is an issue that’s all wrapped up in other emotions: guilt, sadness,
anger, and low self-esteem. You don’t want to make matters worse, but you
can’t allow him to break with the program on a regular basis and, even worse,
become a huge sneak. The danger of confronting him is that he’ll try harder
to make sure he doesn’t get caught again. This section gives you some tips
for talking with a child who’s willing to go to great lengths to get his sugar fix.
We talk about whether punishment is the best option and recommend alter-
native measures you may find useful in this situation.
Breaking with the program at school 
and friends’ homes
When your kid leaves the house, you have to accept that he’s at the helm of
his own ship. You can’t stalk him to make sure he’s not down at the pizza
place or peek through the windows of the school cafeteria to make sure he’s
eating a healthy, well-balanced meal.
School lunches aren’t always the healthiest meals. Most schools offer treats
in the lunch line, like cookies, cake, brownies, ice cream, and chocolate
whole milk. Some schools even have fast-food vendors on campus selling
232
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

their fat-laden wares to the innocents and making the obesity crisis in this
country even worse. (Okay, we’re stepping down off the soapbox now.)
In Chapter 12, we talk about ways to make sure your child gets a healthy meal
at lunchtime. But what do you do when he’s eating everything but the salad he
packed in his lunch box this morning? Can you march into that cafeteria and
spoon-feed him a low-fat, low-sugar diet? Should you make him wear a sign
that says, “My mom won’t let me buy snacks”? Of course not; humiliating your
child doesn’t do anything but make him feel as though he can’t trust you.
To help ensure that your child has a healthy lunch:
 Close your wallet. If you’re not handing out money for treats at school,
your young child will be hard pressed to come up with the cash for a
cookie or other treat.
 Have your child pack his own lunch. Provide him with plenty of
healthy, tasty options for his lunchbox: low-fat turkey slices, whole-grain
breads or pita pockets, fresh fruits and vegetables, and low-fat condi-
ments like mustard, balsamic vinegar, salsa, hot sauce, or low-fat salad
dressing.
 Think beyond the sandwich. Healthy soups, whole-grain pastas, low-fat
stews, or last night’s healthy leftovers are easily packed in an insulated
container or thermos and pulled out at lunchtime.
 If your child insists on buying lunch (many kids would rather die than
brown-bag it), review the school’s lunch menu with him. Point out the
healthiest choices; explain why the high-fat, high-sugar items aren’t con-
ducive to good health. Because they’re often armed with their own
money, older kids really need to have a firm grasp on the concept of
what makes one food healthier than another. (Chapters 7, 8, and 9 are
filled with information on healthy versus unhealthy food choices.)
When he’s heading to a friend’s house, reduce the chances that he’ll sneak
unhealthy snacks by doing any of the following:
 Feed him at home before he leaves.
 Give him a fun (but healthy) snack to take along and share.
 Tell him to take along a game, football, soccer ball, or something else
that will get him and his friends active.
Sneaking snacks happens every once in a while, and it’s not the end of the
world. But why, you ask, would your child jeopardize his weight-loss progress?
For the same reasons we all eat unhealthy foods at times: He may be truly
233
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program

hungry, and he may just be tempted beyond his ability to say no at this point
in time. Don’t forget that he’s used to eating whatever’s handy, and you can’t
expect a miraculous change in behavior overnight. Even the most motivated
kids slip up now and then, and one misstep won’t hinder the headway he’s
making.
Even if he’s going off to college in a few years, your child isn’t a mini-adult. He
doesn’t have the ability to think long term like you do. While you’re worried
sick about the risks that obesity pose to his health, he’s probably taking
those threats much less seriously, especially if he’s been lucky enough up to
this point to avoid serious medical issues related to his weight.
Emphasizing choices
How do you deal with a child who has grabbed autonomy by the horns and is
leading a double life (a healthy one at home and a not-so-healthy one else-
where)? Drive home the concept of choices, explaining that the goal is to
avoid making bad choices that can lead to lifelong ramifications. Explain this
concept to your child in language that she can understand.
In Chapter 3, we talk about the serious long-term health risks associated with
being obese. Even though you may have discussed these issues with your
child (hopefully without scaring the living daylights out of her), she may not
fully appreciate the seriousness of what lies ahead. Teenagers are notorious
for thinking that nothing bad is ever going to happen to them.
You’ve got to get this newsflash through to her: Obesity is serious, the
damage is happening now, and she doesn’t have the luxury of time to decide
whether or not to get with the program. If she waits too long, her health
could be too far gone to do much about it. Tell her:
 She has a choice between a healthy future and one filled with fear over
what will happen with her body.
 She has a choice to feel better or to suffer the pain (emotional and phys-
ical) associated with obesity.
 She has a choice to participate fully in life or to be sidelined by her
weight.
She’s the only one who can make these choices for herself, and they’re
dependent on her making the right decisions on a day-to-day basis. You can
help her by educating her about which foods are healthy and which foods
aren’t, but you can’t always be there to make the right choice for her.
234
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

You may be tempted to pack her lunch every day and prepare her snacks at
home, and that’s fine when you’re first beginning a weight-loss program. Just
make sure your child is at least nearby, watching and learning how to do
these things for herself. After a couple of days of instruction, even a young
child can prepare a healthy veggie wrap for herself or decide that she’d
rather have fruit salad for lunch. An older child can and should pick up on
the process very quickly.
Children learn about making good choices when they’re allowed to think for
themselves. If you have a child who’s overwhelmed by decision making or
who chooses unhealthy foods time and time again, narrow the choices down
for her. Let her know what she can have instead of only telling her what isn’t
allowed. For example, if you’re preparing the grocery list and your daughter
asks for a fish-fry dinner next week, do the following:
1. Definitely say no to that request and remind her that fried foods are
high in fat and are something the entire family is no longer eating.
2. Let her choose from some healthier options, such as grilled chicken,
fish, vegetarian dishes, or egg-white omelets.
For additional healthy food options, check out Chapter 9.
Resisting the urge to punish
You may be disappointed to hear that there’s no punishment system for obese
kids who break the rules (and hence, their mothers’ hearts). Punishing and/or
shaming a child for sneaking unhealthy foods will only make her better at
hiding the evidence. Younger children are usually easier to get back on track
simply because they have less freedom and opportunity to stray from your
new rules regarding food. Teenagers, though, need to feel as though parents
aren’t completely in charge of their lives anymore. That’s why they can be so
cranky and even outright mean when you’re just trying to help them. They
want to do it themselves, and they don’t want to have to say, even to them-
selves, “My mom helped me figure this out.”
Although doling out serious punishment may seem like the right thing to do
when you’ve had it up to your eyeballs with your teen’s lack of cooperation,
back off for a minute and cool down. Yelling at her, grounding her, and making
her do the worst chores in the house for two weeks only feed the resentment
she feels toward the situation. And yet, by completely ignoring the issue, you
may send the message that you don’t care, that it’s all right for her to con-
tinue breaking her weight-loss rules, that you don’t mind if she stops off for a
submarine sandwich with the works on her way home from school.
235
Chapter 13: Dealing with a Child Who Hasn’t Bought into the Program

Find some creative way to continue to educate her on the topic without
making it seem as though you’re truly punishing her. Let her prepare dinner
for you a couple of nights a week. Take it one step farther and ask her to
make the grocery list for next week. Give her the responsibility of taking care
of her own health.
Keep in mind that true change takes time and that backsliding isn’t the end of
the world. Whatever her age, continue to support your child, and don’t
berate her for her shortcomings and mistakes. Before you know it, your child
will be out the door and living her own life. And when she reaches that point,
the decisions she makes will have to be her own. (Sorry, but you can’t move
into her dorm room and cook for her.) If you’ve done all you can to educate
her on the dangers of remaining obese and how to care for herself, no matter
what the outcome is, you’ll know you did everything possible to help her
control her weight problem and commit to a healthy lifestyle.

I
n theory, the (relatively) easy modifications to your family’s lifestyle that
we recommend throughout this book should help your and your child’s
goal to achieve better health. However, we know that some families have a
really tough time adjusting their eating and exercise habits. When you’ve
been doing something a certain way for years and years, figuring out and
sticking to an entirely new system takes time and effort and can be exhausting,
both mentally and physically.
You may reach a point when you’ve tried everything you can think of and still
nothing seems to be helping your child. Or perhaps the weight is coming off
slowly, but your child is still unhappy. Or maybe your child’s dropping the
weight extremely fast and you’re concerned that your child has lost too much
weight, that’s she’s developed an obsession with becoming too thin. When
you hit the wall of frustration or worry, don’t be afraid to seek help outside of
your home. You want your child’s emotional state to improve as a result of
adapting a healthier lifestyle; a slimmer body is no consolation if her mindset
is suffering.
Do We Need Professional Help?
It can be difficult for any parent to know what’s “normal” for a child and what
isn’t. That’s one big reason so many parents gather in formal playgroups or
informal meetings at the playground — they want to touch base with other
moms and dads to figure out if what their kids are doing and experiencing at
any given stage of childhood is typical or slightly out of the ordinary.

238
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a network of friends who are also turning
their homes into healthy-living havens, then you already know what a god-
send it can be to simply sit down and share information with these people.
On the other hand, if your family is going through this health-improvement
venture alone, you’re bound to face times when you don’t know if a situation
is cause for concern or a natural part of the process. You may need some out-
side help if:
 Your child is actually gaining weight despite her best efforts at low-fat
eating and increased activity.
 Your child is exhibiting signs of anxiety and/or depression related to
weight.
 Your child is exhibiting signs of an eating disorder (obsessing over food
and weight, for example, or losing far too much weight too quickly and
refusing to eat).
Keep your eyes open for any signs of your child’s weight-loss efforts going
askew. A teen who’s desperate to lose weight may turn to weight-loss pills
sold in a health-food store, some of which can have serious side effects and,
in any event, aren’t a long-term solution to her weight issue. Other, legitimate
weight-loss medications are available by prescription but may have serious
side effects. (We address the side effects of weight-loss medications in the
section “Investigating medications for weight loss” later in this chapter.)
Exploring Your Options
When you’re concerned enough about your child’s weight-loss experience 
to discuss things with a third party, it’s important to find a professional you’re
comfortable speaking with and who, in return, has great communication skills.
You can’t leave this issue hanging, with questions unanswered and miscom-
munications swirling about, so be prepared to do some research to find the
right professional or support group for your child.
Talking with your child’s doctor
Hopefully, your child’s doctor has been in on your family’s health-improvement
goals from the beginning. If not, bring him in now. Not only is he most familiar
with your child’s health history, but he’s also a source of knowledge on your
family’s health history. He can connect the dots between predisposing factors
that may play a role in any unusual difficulty that your child is having with
her weight loss. (If she’s doing everything right and she’s gaining weight, for
example, your pediatrician may be able to shed some light on the cause.)

Some of the topics to discuss with your child’s doctor include:
 Your child’s refusal to adhere to a healthy lifestyle
 Lack of results despite a good effort from your child
 Self-esteem or social issues
 Weight-related health issues
Your child’s pediatrician should be compassionate and sensitive to the issue
of weight, especially if your child is shy and/or approaching the teen years.
For introverted or self-conscious children (and most adolescents are nothing
if not self-conscious, regardless of their weight), talking to an authority figure
can be very difficult if they fear this person is going to lecture or somehow
berate them for their shortcomings. Of course, if you talk with the doctor and
get a sense of aloofness or condescension without having your concerns
addressed, find someone who’ll do a better job communicating with you and,
in turn, your child.
You need solid guidance on these major issues. Any parent whose child is at
increased risk for developing serious illnesses needs to know that she can
make a call for advice and not feel as though she’s intruding on the doctor’s
lunch hour. If your child’s doctor either takes the issue of obesity too lightly
or is far too judgmental about your family’s lifestyle, you may be so uncom-
fortable asking for help that you just don’t. We’re not advocating a particular
personality style that’s ideal for a pediatrician; we’re simply saying that your
doc’s way of doing business needs to gel with yours for the best results.
Investigating medications for weight loss
Can’t your pediatrician just prescribe one of those weight-loss pills to help
your child get down to a healthy weight? After all, given that obesity causes
some serious health issues, isn’t it best to lose the weight fast and then
address lifestyle issues that may have contributed to weight gain? Well, if
you’ve read through much of this book, you know that we advocate long-term
lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes, but some situations may call for the
help of medication.
Prescription medications
Some weight-loss medications on the market are considered safe for use in
kids as young as 12 years old. (The one drug that has been shown to be
safest is orlistat.) Studies indicate that children who used these medications
had a reduction in their BMIs (body mass index), which translates into a
decrease in weight-related health risks. Some concerns that surround the use
of these medications, however, include:
239
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help

 Long-term effects: Doctors simply don’t know how effective these med-
ications are at keeping weight off; they aren’t quite sure if teens who use
these drugs will have to use them for one year, two years, or for many,
many years in order to maintain their weight. Along with weight mainte-
nance, doctors aren’t sure how long the health benefits will last.
 Side effects: Many of the less-than-pleasant side effects affect the gas-
trointestinal tract and may be embarrassing for teens.
 Underlying factors: A child must adhere to a healthier lifestyle for best
results.
We advise you to explore every other avenue of weight loss with your child’s
doctor before putting your child on a weight-loss pill.
If your child is prescribed one of these medications, explain to him that he
doesn’t get a free pass to ease up on his healthy lifestyle. Medication isn’t
meant to be a quick solution to what is really a lifelong process. Weight-loss
drugs should be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise,
not in place of them.
One weight-loss drug that has been used in teens, sibutramine HCl monohy-
drate, has been associated with some serious heart-related side effects.
Although weight-loss drugs are available by prescription, in this day and age,
kids may be able to secure pills via the Internet or from a friend’s parent’s
supply. Advise your teen that these drugs should only be used under a
doctor’s supervision.
Over-the-counter medications: Teen buyer, beware
Plenty of unregulated pills are widely marketed as cures for obesity. Some are
sold in pharmacies (without a prescription, of course); others are on the
shelves of “health” stores; some are advertised on TV; some are sold through
magazines. School-age children aren’t likely to fall prey to these ads because
they’re unlikely to have money at their disposal and because customers must
be 18 years of age to purchase most of these over-the-counter products.
Teenagers, as a group, are risk takers. Talk to your teenager about taking any
kind of pill or supplement that’s touted as having weight-loss benefits. Tell
him that if weight loss were as simple as taking a pill, everyone in the world
would be skinny! Warn him about possible side effects, which may include:
 Heart palpitations
 Faintness
 Electrolyte imbalances (with use of diuretics)
240
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

The real problem with these pills is that they don’t address the real issues
that contribute to weight gain. As a result, even if your teen were to experience
weight-loss success with these medications, he’s very likely to put the weight
right back on after he stops taking them if he hasn’t modified his diet and
exercise habits. And taking medications like laxatives and ipecac for weight
loss are in a whole other category of danger, which we talk about in the “Weight
loss gone too far: Eating disorders” section at the end of this chapter.
Weight-loss programs and support groups
Weight loss is sometimes easier, especially for teens, with the support of a
peer group. Being surrounded by other kids dealing with similar issues often
helps children work through their problems and realize that they aren’t the
only ones facing certain obstacles.
Despite the fact that there are more overweight children now than there have
been at any time in history, hooking your child into a support network for
kids may not be a snap. If you don’t know of any organized groups in your
area, ask your child’s doctor for advice. Even if she doesn’t personally know
of any groups, she should be able to point you in the right direction, like sug-
gesting you call the local hospital, a particular church, a social worker, or a
group like Weight Watchers or Overeaters Anonymous.
Weight Watchers has proven their program to be an incredibly effective
means of modifying those lifestyle factors that contribute to being over-
weight and obese. However, a child under the age of 17 can’t participate in
meetings without a doctor’s note. And if your teen is looking for a group filled
with people her own age, you may need to look elsewhere.
In most groups, a moderator plays the role of referee, making sure that no
bullying occurs or overly harsh judgments are tossed around the room. Your
child should expect to encounter many different personality types and be
ready to support others in their times of need — support groups are a two-
way street, after all. Make sure that she understands that she won’t always be
the center of attention; also, make sure that a shy child knows that, at some
point, she’ll be expected to share her feelings.
Many support groups center around sharing personal experiences and
advice, but a support group is only as good as the people who run it. Before
you send your child off to a support group meeting, talk at length with the
moderator to get a feel for what goes on in meetings. If you hear something
about radical new therapies that involve a lot of yelling at each other, or if
there seems to be an emphasis on shaming one another out of their unhealthy
habits, you may want to move on and find a different group, one that under-
scores the importance of compassion, understanding, and guidance through
experience.
241
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help

Obese children deal with enough discrimination out in the real world. A sup-
port group should be an oasis from that kind of cruelty.
In the end, your child may love being surrounded by other kids dealing with
similar issues, or she may find that she isn’t really digging the group interac-
tion. Let her decide what’s working and what isn’t in terms of a support
group, and if she wants to call it quits for a while, respect that decision.
Recognizing and Dealing with 
Severe Weight-Related Issues
When concern over your child morphs into the type of anxiety that haunts
you day and night, you probably need to intervene in an entirely new way.
Obviously, an obese child deals with issues that may stem mostly from her
weight, and normal, age-related stress is made worse by the condition of obe-
sity. Most teenage girls, at one time or another, worry about finding a date for
the prom, whether they’re popular, and how pretty they are compared to
other girls. Teenage boys, meanwhile, are concerned with where they stand
in the pecking order of high school males as well as how they’re viewed by
the opposite sex. Obese teens have these same worries, often coupled with a
devastatingly low self-esteem. These circumstances can lead to chronic,
severe depression, which in turn can make a weight issue even worse.
242
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 
Supporting the family
As you research support groups for your child,
you may come across groups that focus on sup-
porting the overweight family. Again, do your
research and find out what these groups are all
about. Get answers to these questions:
 How often does the group meet?
 How are age groups divided?
 Who moderates meetings?
 What are the ground rules for meetings?
 What are the goals of the meetings?
One big issue to know more about is the kinds
of topics discussed. For example, do adults talk
only about their children’s weight-loss strug-
gles, or is there a forum for talking about adult
weight loss as well? Does the group discuss
medical breakthroughs regarding obesity or
legislation regarding obesity discrimination? In
order for you to get the most out of any support
group, it has to deal with issues that concern
you. Keep looking until you find a good fit.

In this section, we talk about the kinds of worries that may be keeping you
awake at night and advise you on how to find help for your child. These 
worries include:
 The need for therapy
 Surgical options
 Eating disorders such as binge eating, bulimia, and anorexia
Therapy for psychological problems
Years ago, the medical community believed that most obese people suffered
some sort of psychological trauma that was the impetus for their overeating;
essentially, they were attempting to silence their nerves with food. These
days, doctors believe this theory holds little credence, at least for most
people. The theory surrounding obesity today is not that it’s caused by psy-
chological issues, but that it certainly can cause psychological problems.
Doctors consider obesity the result of overeating, lack of exercise, and a pre-
disposition toward becoming severely overweight. Although some childhood
or even adult traumas can cause a person to seek out comfort foods, most
often, this isn’t the cause of true obesity.
If you believe that your child may benefit from the intervention of a therapist,
she probably won’t work to find some hidden, repressed trauma that may
have caused him to begin overeating. Rather, she’ll probably deal with the
issues that are secondary to his weight gain, such as:
 Depression
 Feelings of isolation
 Anxiety or panic attacks
 Low self-esteem
 Eating disorders such as bulimia
To determine whether your child needs this type of help, first check with
your child’s doctor. He can give you his medical opinion on what kinds of
therapy your child may benefit from and also recommend a psychologist,
social worker, or psychiatrist.
243
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help

You can also work the recommendation another way: Contact your medical
insurer to find out about your mental health benefits. The insurance company
should be able to provide you with a list of therapists who participate in your
medical plan. You can then hand that list to your pediatrician, and he can
give you his recommendations based on the names in front of him.
A bad therapist (or one who’s completely unversed in dealing with obesity
and its emotional effects) can end up doing more harm than good. Children
are especially vulnerable to therapy, which is great if they’re in the hands of a
miracle worker and horrific if they’re working with someone who’s insensi-
tive to the needs of obese children.
When you finally hook up with a qualified therapist, make sure you speak
with her about her philosophies before you send your child in for a session.
Ask about the following:
 What a typical session entails
 How many obese children she’s worked with in the past
 What her goals are for your child
 How long she typically treats children
 How she handles emergencies (like if your child has a major panic attack
when her office is closed)
A qualified therapist won’t share with you any information that passes
between herself and your child inside her office, but she’s required by law to
let you and the police know if your child is a threat to himself or to others.
Again, the wrong match between therapist and patient can do more harm
than good, and whereas adults may benefit from some combative interplay 
in a therapist’s office, depressed children generally fare much better with
someone who’s nurturing (at least on some level). Overweight children often
end up working on accepting themselves, which, as you can imagine, is also 
a task best left to a nurturing, kind therapist.
Surgical options
You’ve no doubt heard about gastric bypass surgery, which is being hailed as a
cure for many obese adults. Basically, in this surgery, a doctor goes in and
reroutes the plumbing in the stomach. The alteration makes the stomach
smaller and narrows the connection between the stomach and the small
intestine. The person can no longer eat large amounts of food, and weight
loss is the ultimate result of this surgery.
244
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Gastric bypass is becoming more and more common among obese adults,
and physicians are also performing the surgery in severely obese teenagers
(those who have reached their full growth potential), but only after the teens
have tried unsuccessfully for at least six months to lose weight.
Gastric bypass for teens isn’t easy to come by. The surgery’s only performed
on teens in a handful of hospitals in the United States.
The screening process: Is your child a good candidate? 
If you live near one of the few medical centers that perform gastric bypass on
teens and you and your child are seriously considering this option, you can
expect that your child will be put through a rigorous screening process,
which will include:
 Evaluating his BMI to ensure he’s actually obese enough to benefit from
the surgery
 Evaluating any weight-related ailments such as diabetes or high blood
pressure
 Evaluating his maturity level to assess whether he can handle modifying
his lifestyle after the surgery
 Evaluating his home life to determine whether the family’s willing to
change its entire family’s lifestyle in order to ensure the child’s success
A child who suffers from serious health conditions such as diabetes or sleep
apnea because of his weight is more likely to be approved for the surgery. If
obesity merely causes your child embarrassment and difficulty performing
everyday tasks, his case may not be considered serious enough for surgery.
Children have a long life ahead of them, and doctors want to make darn sure
that the surgery is going to be a success. Collecting these assurances is a
major part of the screening process for weight-related surgery. Doctors don’t
want to see your child back in the hospital in a year because he didn’t change
his eating habits. Failing to follow doctors’ orders (like eating small, low-fat
meals) after the surgery can lead to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
The risks involved with surgery
Some serious risks and issues surround gastric bypass, so in the event that
your child is considering gastric bypass, you both need to:
 Realize that this is major surgery and, as such, it involves some major
risks, including infection and death. Complications can also extend a
year or two after surgery, resulting in major nutritional deficiencies and
(occasionally) death.
245
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help

 Acknowledge that the long-term effects of gastric bypass surgery done
on teens aren’t fully understood. Your child may experience nutritional
deficiencies or other problems related to the surgery when she reaches
middle age, for example. The surgery is so new that there’s just no
telling what lies ahead.
 Make sure that your child is prepared for the recovery process.
Gastric bypass isn’t outpatient surgery; recovery is long, complicated,
and involves sticking with a healthy diet and exercise.
One big complication of this surgery is that sometimes patients lose so much
weight that they need cosmetic surgery to remove (or tuck) the excess skin
they’re left with.
Our point of view on this surgery is that it’s a complicated procedure, and the
recovery can be as complicated and dangerous as the operation itself. The
long-term effects of gastric bypass haven’t been fully evaluated in teen patients,
so we’re not comfortable recommending it as a weight-loss option. However,
we present the information here so that you can make an informed decision if
your teen is interested in this surgery.
Weight loss gone too far: Eating disorders
You want your child to lose enough weight to feel well, both physically and
emotionally. However, obsessing over the number on the scale can be just as
devastating to her self-esteem as being overweight in the first place, and it
can lead to serious health issues, as well. This section informs you about
some common eating disorders, why they happen, what their symptoms are,
and what you can do to help in the event that your child seems to be slipping
into this dark and dangerous realm of weight loss.
Exact numbers on eating disorders are unknown. These conditions carry a
great deal of self-inflicted shame, so sufferers are more concerned with hiding
the problem than with getting the appropriate help.
Talk to your teen if you’re worried about the possibility of an eating disorder;
however, because eating disorders involve considerable shame and secrecy,
don’t take her word for it that everything’s fine. If you really suspect a prob-
lem, take her to see her doctor, and let the two of them talk alone. She’s much
more likely to open up to someone who effectively says, “I’m a medical pro-
fessional, and I know what’s going on here. Let’s get you some help.”
246
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Binge eating disorder
One relatively new area of research in the area of eating disorders surrounds
a condition called binge eating disorder. The main components of this eating
disorder are:
 Frequently overeating (or “bingeing” on abnormally large amounts of
food)
 A sense of being completely out of control while bingeing
 A deep feeling of regret or guilt during and after bingeing episodes
 Eating more quickly than usual during binges
Unlike bulimia, which involves bingeing and then purging oneself of the food,
people who suffer from binge eating disorder don’t vomit or use laxatives
after a binge. For this reason, binge eating disorder often leads to obesity and
all its related health issues.
Scientists are trying to determine if and how brain chemicals and normal
bodily functions may play into this problem. It seems to affect more women
than men and is associated with a history of depression (although depression
may be the result of binge eating and not its cause).
Like other eating disorders, binge eating can wreak havoc on a teen’s self-
esteem and health. Because binge eaters feel as though they’re unable to 
control themselves around food, they’re often unable to stick with weight-loss
efforts. They feel completely out of control where food is concerned and will
do almost anything to secure forbidden foods (those not kept in the home);
they may even binge on healthy foods. The guilt that they feel about bingeing
can also result in severe depression, making them feel as though they’ll never
succeed in losing weight. This vicious cycle of depression and overeating
continues to fuel itself on guilt.
The binge eater doesn’t simply overeat. She eats abnormally large amounts 
of food and may eat it very quickly, feeling as though she can’t get it in fast
enough. So where one person may eat five slices of pizza and say, “I can’t
believe how I binged tonight,” the true binge eater may eat an entire pizza, a
half-gallon of ice cream, a bag of chips, a box of cookies, and wash it down with
a gallon of milk. Obviously, that’s more food than anyone should eat in one 
sitting, and it’s the type of eating that’s the hallmark of this eating disorder.
If you suspect that your teen has this disorder, don’t try to handle it yourself.
Therapy has been shown to be effective in treating this disorder. If you’re
concerned that your teen is a true binge eater, talk to her doctor to get a 
recommendation for a therapist who’s well versed in eating disorders.
247
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help

Bulimia
Like binge eaters, bulimics eat large amounts of food. However, bulimics
purge themselves of the food by forcing themselves to vomit or by using laxa-
tives. For this reason, bulimia is also called binge-purge disorder.
Girls are more vulnerable to bulimia than boys are, although the causes of
this disorder are unknown. Bulimia is associated with some very serious
physical side effects, including:
 Dehydration, possibly resulting in faintness
 Electrolyte imbalances, possibly resulting in an irregular heartbeat
 Damage to kidneys and liver
 Esophageal tearing and rupture
 Intestinal damage and upset
 Dependence on laxatives
 Damage to tooth enamel from repeated vomiting
 Severe depression
Unlike anorexics (see the following section), bulimics often maintain a normal
weight; some are even overweight, so you can’t look to rapid and unusual
weight loss as a sign that something’s amiss. Teens may become entangled in
bulimia after they’ve lost weight because they know that they don’t want to
gain the weight back but feel powerless when faced with food. Bingeing and
purging seems to work for a time, until they realize that they can’t stop and
experience a sense of hopelessness and depression.
Bulimia isn’t something that you can treat at home. If you think that your
teen is struggling with bulimia, find a therapist for her to work with. She
needs to regain a sense of control over her life in order for the bingeing to
come to a stop.
Anorexia
Anorexia, an aversion to food and obsession with weight loss, usually isn’t
something that formerly obese teens struggle with; they seem to be more 
predisposed to the bingeing disorders addressed in preceding sections.
However, because bulimia is occasionally linked to anorexia, we discuss the
disorder briefly here.
248
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off 

Like other eating disorders, anorexia affects more females than males, and
usually begins as a response to some sort of stress. Anorexics are usually
characterized as perfectionists, so concerned about their physical appearance
that they’ll go to any lengths to make sure they don’t gain an ounce. Symptoms
of anorexia are usually easier to spot than bingeing symptoms, which are 
usually kept under wraps by the sufferer. Anorexia can result in:
 Extreme weight loss, to the point where the teen looks unwell
 Anemia
 Dehydration
 Dry skin and brittle hair
 Cold extremities and low blood pressure
 Irregular heartbeat
 Loss of teeth
 Cessation of menstruation
 A light, downy covering of hair over the body (called lanugo)
The anorexic truly believes that she is overweight, even after she’s dropped
down to a dangerously low body weight. Regardless of her size, she fears
food and refuses to eat it.
249
Chapter 14: Bringing In Outside Help
Torn between food and the “perfect” figure
It’s no wonder that eating disorders plague
women especially. Society is obsessed not just
with weight and appearance but also with food!
Food is everywhere we turn, so you’re sup-
posed to eat food, love food, and maintain the
perfect figure. What a confusing message for a
teen to sort out! In addition to being hammered
with these messages, by nature, teens are risk
takers. They don’t believe that the natural con-
sequences of their actions (especially risks to
their health) are going to catch up with them, so
to a teenager, using laxatives to control or main-
tain her weight may seem like a great idea.

 Dealing with weight-loss related changes
 Praising children’s weight-loss accomplishments
 Looking to the future
L
osing weight is a major accomplishment for an obese child. As she makes
significant strides toward her goal weight, you can see the pride in her
face as she starts to feel as though all the effort really is going to pay off.
However, keeping the weight from coming back full force takes equal effort.
Obesity isn’t a hit-and-run problem, where your child drops the weight and is
home free for the rest of her life. Anyone who has lived a sedentary lifestyle
with bad eating habits is at risk for falling back into those old routines because
they’re easy. It’s so much easier for your child to sit and watch TV rather
than go outside to play, just as it’s easier for you to pick up pizza and wings
rather than light up the grill for some fish and veggies for dinner. If scientists
could come up with a way for every man, woman, and child to be fit by sitting
on the couch and snacking, how many of us would bother to venture outside
for some fresh air and exercise or wash the lettuce for a salad?
There’s bound to be a period of time before your child reaches her goal
weight when everyone in the household just gets bored with the healthiness.
They want to go back to the way things were — the way they should be, in
their opinion, and the way they’re going to be when you come back to your
senses (or so they think). Stand firm when faced with such dissension in the
ranks. Just as you’ve led your child to the threshold of weight loss, you’re
going to see her (and the rest of the family) all the way — to an entirely new
lifestyle.

Maintaining Positive Change
The hardest thing about losing weight and keeping it off is that the job never
ends, especially for a formerly obese child. Think about what kinds of habits
caused your child to become overweight in the first place: Eating large 
quantities of fattening foods, leading a sedentary lifestyle, and perhaps even
feeling too far gone or too scared (or both) to do anything about it. Now put
these habits and emotions into perspective: Isn’t it much easier to grab a
handful of cookies and a can of soda for a snack — especially when you’re
feeling blue or bored — than to prepare a veggie pita or munch a fibrous
piece of fruit? Doesn’t it feel good to settle in on the couch after a long day
of sitting at your desk? (And doesn’t the prospect of taking a walk seem like
a real drag in comparison?) Isn’t it simple to get tangled up in depression
and to start feeling as though you can never begin to crawl out from what-
ever trouble you’ve found yourself in, and isn’t it easy to soothe those feel-
ings with a hot fudge sundae?
The reason so many children (and adults) in this country are obese is
because it’s easy to get that way — much easier than it is to get healthy and
easier than establishing and sticking with healthier habits. Formerly obese
children may have an especially hard time maintaining good habits because
they’ve come to associate food with so many other emotions: sadness, happi-
ness, boredom, guilt, nervousness. And because these kids have been eating
at all times of the day and night, it may be hard for them to accept structured
meals and snacks. If your child has been settling down in front of the TV just
before bedtime with a box of something for as long as you can remember, it’s
part of his nighttime routine. It gives him comfort and relaxes him before he
heads off to dreamland. And changing that routine is like taking a pacifier
away from a baby.
If your child has a hard time giving up his nighttime snack, replace it with
something healthy like fruit or a whole-wheat bagel. If the swap doesn’t work,
change his whole bedtime routine so that the absence of his snack isn’t so
obvious — or heartbreaking. In fact, you can use this time to institute newer,
healthier habits. For example, instead of spending the evening watching
videos with your child, take a walk together or play outside just before bath
time, or snuggle up together with a good book (rather than a tasty snack) at
bedtime. 

Taking things one day at a time
Weight loss for an obese child can go one of two ways:
 He may still be young enough so that the changes you’ve introduced
into the house become second nature to him. He may never look back
longingly on his former ways.
 He may be so set in his ways that, for him, keeping the weight off is like
an alcoholic staying away from liquor. He has good days and bad days,
but weight loss is something he can absolutely conquer.
Obviously, you hate to think of your child struggling with addiction, because
being hooked on anything — whether it’s booze or drugs or food — can be a
living hell. And trying to give the addiction up, even though you know it’s lit-
erally killing you, can be even worse, at least initially.
The hard thing about leaving an addiction behind (aside from any physical
dependencies) is the realization that the habit gave you comfort and made
you feel good (at least some of the time). Kicking a habit reminds people of
their shortcomings — at least until they’ve been over their addictions for a
good amount of time and can acknowledge how strong they are and how far
they’ve come.
The worst thing about a food addiction is that your child can no longer eat
the foods he’s come to depend on (for comfort, to pass time, and so on), and
he can’t make a clean break from food altogether. You make all the difference
in how well your child does in the long run; he needs you to be consistent on
a daily basis. Sure, it’s fine to celebrate a birthday with cake, and it’s all right
for the entire family to relax together and watch some TV now and then. But
if you start to feel as though things are spiraling down into unhealthy terri-
tory again, you have to say, “Enough!” and pull everyone back up to where
they should be. You need to regularly evaluate how his new, healthy routines
are going and correct them as soon as you see them deteriorating. Clean out
the pantry from time to time and toss out any unhealthy foods that have
(somehow) found their way into your home. Encourage your child to make
his own breakfast, lunch, and snacks while you stand by silently, ready to
reeducate him on the finer points of nutrition if need be. Help him measure
out portion sizes and/or decipher food labels, for example.
253
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

Keeping your guard up without 
going overboard
When it comes to your continued observations and corrections about your
family’s healthy lifestyle, you may start to feel like a sentry at the pantry door,
and what’s worse, you may start acting that way. Your kids may start to avoid
the issue of food and weight when you ask, and you may start to resemble an
unsympathetic drill sergeant rather than a concerned parent.
It’s very easy to fall into compulsive behavior where weight loss is concerned:
Counting calories, fat grams, and time spent exercising start out as necessities
but can turn into obsessions. And the very last thing in the world you want to
do is to turn your child into a nervous, obsessive weight-watcher. She’s more
likely to suffer from other eating issues (like anorexia and/or bulimia) when
weight and food become the only things she’s interested in and when she
thinks she has to keep the weight off in order to please you.
Being the one in charge of maintaining your family’s healthier lifestyle is a
tough balancing act. You know that you couldn’t have helped your child
become healthier without getting tough, so how can she continue to succeed
if you lose your edge? It’s not really a matter of losing your edge but rather
remembering that no matter how old your child is (from toddler to teenager),
she’s still a child who needs a consistent, balanced adult to keep her on the
right track. Children tend to mimic what they see, so if you behave in an
overly aggressive manner where your child’s weight is concerned, you may
get that attitude thrown right back at you. In the case of a teenager, you also
may incite a rebellion, and then all the strides your child has made are for
naught.
And what about the worry? Will you ever be able to look at your child and
breathe a sigh of relief, thinking that she’s completely free of the shackles of
obesity? Probably not. You can be proud (and elated) that she’s lost the weight,
but you may never fully let go of those obesity-related concerns. Having
those worries in the back of your mind shows that you’re an educated and
concerned parent; you’re determined to do everything you can to keep your
child from backsliding because of your concern.
If you toss all your worry out the window and assume that because your
child has come so far, excess weight will never bother her again, you’re less
likely to recognize the early signs of backsliding. You’re also more likely to
allow bad habits to reenter the home.
Your child’s weight loss should be about your child pleasing herself and
keeping herself healthy. She’s so much more than the number on the scale.
When she successfully loses weight, help her find new interests and activities
254
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off

to take the place of her old bad habits. If she can fill her time productively,
she’s less likely to fall back into her unhealthy routines, and you’re less likely
to lose your mind worrying that she will.
Comparing the past and present
Feeling as though your child’s weight loss is only a temporary respite from
her weight problem is normal. Because you’ve been dealing with the obesity
for quite some time, you’re bound to think at one time or another that he’s
going to be a statistical failure. You want him to succeed so badly that it
breaks your heart to know that he may not. Plus, this whole process is taking
so long that you can’t believe he’ll ever reach his goal weight. And if you feel
that way, you can’t imagine that he’s feeling much differently.
Keeping your chin up during these less-than-hopeful times is important
because relaying a feeling of hopelessness or a “What’s the use?” attitude to
your child doesn’t help him continue to succeed. Even if he’s still a long way
from his goal weight, things are going well as long as he’s moving in the right
direction.
Losing a substantial amount of weight takes a long time, and maintaining a
high level of enthusiasm throughout the entire process is difficult. Just keep
telling yourself — and your child — that slow weight loss is more likely to be
permanent weight loss.
Compare your child now to the way he was several months ago (or whenever
it was you adopted a healthier lifestyle). Note the significant differences
between then and now. If he’s made great strides in this healthy new lifestyle:
 He’s feeling better about himself emotionally.
 He’s feeling better physically.
 He may be doing better socially.
 His personality may have undergone a big change — for the better —
because of all the other changes.
Remembering how far your child’s already come when you know he still has a
long way to go can be rough, and playing cheerleader every day for a year or
more, especially when your new lifestyle starts to feel like just another rou-
tine, can be even worse. However, these are the times when you should look
back on the family’s old, unhealthy lifestyle and ask yourself if you’re willing
to go back. To regain your energy and motivation, recall everything you’ve
learned about obesity and its health risks, and remember your child at his
lowest point of self-esteem.
255
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

You can’t take care of the family if you haven’t taken the time to care for your-
self. Your child is less likely to maintain his weight loss and continue with his
healthy lifestyle if you don’t stick with this program, also. It may not seem
fair, but it’s the truth. The family that sticks together keeps the weight off —
together.
Evaluating what your child has learned
In order to maintain your child’s positive weight-loss results, you have to
remain on the ball as far as your family’s lifestyle goes; you can’t let down
your guard to the point where you no longer take an interest in what your
child eats or how she spends her time. However, she needs to take as active a
role as possible in her own life, too. Now, you may think, “She’s losing the
weight; she’s outside playing with her friends; of course she’s taking an active
role!” She’s made a great start, but if you were to stop nudging her toward the
right decisions, would she continue on in a healthy direction, or would she
think to herself, “Hey, I’m free to do whatever I want now!”?
Because everyone in the household has to eat every day, asking your child
questions about her choices in an appropriate context is a breeze. And
because activity should also be a regular occurrence in everyone’s lives, 
raising that issue shouldn’t seem odd, either. You need to bring these topics
up to your child in order to assess how much she’s learned about healthy
lifestyles and to make sure she’s not just going through the motions. Now,
don’t get us wrong — the motions are great. Most kids begin the weight-loss
process by doing what they’re told. Eventually, however, as we discuss in
Chapter 12, your child will be faced with outside influences and find herself
in situations where she has to make important choices.
In order to gauge whether your child is developing the skills and knowledge
she needs to maintain weight loss and an overall healthier lifestyle, look for
the following sorts of behavior modifications:
 An increase in her intake of fresh fruits and veggies
 A decrease in her intake of high-sugar, high-fat foods
 An increase in her activity level
 A decrease in TV viewing or other sedentary activities
 An increase in interests outside of the home
 A decrease in her self-esteem issues
 An increase in the amount of positive communication between yourself
and your child
 A decrease in tension between the two of you
256
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off

Your child trots off to school each day to learn about science, math, and
spelling. When she returns home, you become the teacher, imparting knowl-
edge about living a life of wellness. And just as teachers in the primary
grades have a higher-level involvement with their pupils, you have to hold
your child’s hand in the beginning of the program, but as she learns more,
you can back off a bit and let her make her own decisions.
What if you realize that after months of effort, nothing has really sunk into
this child’s mind? What if your work and dedication has actually taken the
responsibility out of her hands and made her dependent on you? As long as
the numbers on the scale are headed in the right direction, she’s playing a
part in improving her health. You just need to reconstruct parts of your plan
in order to get her more involved (and this goes for children of all ages). Here
are a few recommendations for getting your child back on the learning track:
 Instead of handing her an already-prepared snack, give her choices.
Even a toddler can decide whether she wants applesauce or a cut-up
banana, pieces of bagel or pretzels. By providing choices, you let her
know that she has options, that she can make choices between good
foods and other good foods, and — most important — that you aren’t
going to make every decision in her life. An older child should be able to
narrow healthy choices down for herself.
 Let older children help out in the preparation of healthy meals so that
they learn what’s bad and what’s good. Explain to your child the differ-
ences between grilled foods and fried foods, for example, and why
you’ve been preparing the family meals in a certain way. Show her that
creating healthy foods isn’t difficult. (So that she doesn’t get over-
whelmed and frustrated, choose easy recipes when she’s starting out
with you in the kitchen.)
 When your child has a solid idea of what’s healthy and what isn’t,
work together to create weekly menus. Let her look through cookbooks
and choose meals that pique her interest. Tell her that many not-so-
healthy recipes can be modified into low-fat meals. (Chapter 9 is a good
resource for ways to cut back on fat in your favorite recipes.)
Whether you do everything for your child or teach her to do it for herself,
she’s going to lose weight, at least initially. But if she has a deeper under-
standing of the process — for example, which foods are high in fat, which are
better choices, and how and why you prepare her meals a certain way —
she’s more likely to carry that information into her daily decision-making
process. It’s never too late to start teaching her these things, but the sooner
she learns, the better off she’ll be in the long run.
257
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

Even if you think your child is learning a lot about weight loss, avoid taking
the topic too far by discussing and teaching her about calories (for a calorie
lesson, see the sidebar “The scoop on calories”). Drilling calorie counts into a
child’s head often results in the replacement of one eating problem with
another (usually bulimia or, in extreme cases, anorexia). This kind of informa-
tion is also probably more complex than your child can understand. You’d
think a calorie is a calorie, but there’s a big difference between a calorie that
comes from a protein-rich food, for example, and one that comes from a fatty
source. You can ingest 200 calories from either type of food, but the calories
from fat convert themselves into body fat much more easily, and that’s bad
news for someone on a weight-loss plan. 
Being alert for signs of backsliding
Backsliding, falling off the wagon . . . call it whatever you want — it’s when
your child makes great progress in losing weight and then falters and starts
putting weight back on. Backsliding, which we discuss further in Chapter 11,
happens to adults and kids, even when you think you’ve done everything to
prevent it. A backsliding child is at the mercy of parents who have put all
kinds of effort into revamping the entire family’s lifestyle. The kid probably
feels bad enough already about putting a few pounds back on, but when his
parents make him feel as though he’s disappointed them personally, he has
even more self-esteem issues to deal with.
258
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off
The scoop on calories
Calories, calories, calories. You hear about them
all the time, but do you know what they are? A
calorie is a measure of the potential energy a
unit of food contains. If you eat a banana con-
taining 100 calories, you put a certain amount of
stored energy into your body. In order for those
calories not to be stored as fat, you have to use
that energy through physical activity.
The body — especially a growing body —
needs a certain amount of calories each day
just to maintain its proper functioning, so you
can’t just say, “Well, we’ll just cut out calories
all together, and my child will lose weight
easily.” Caloric recommendations vary accord-
ing to a person’s age, body-frame size, and
activity level. But healthy eating doesn’t just
mean taking in the right number of calories.
There’s also a difference in the type of calories
a person can ingest. Calories that come from
fatty foods are more dense and more easily
converted into fat in the body than calories that
come from other sources. The fact that not all
calories are created equal is just one reason
why counting calories can be misleading.

If the numbers on the scale start going up again, don’t freak out. You need to
get to the bottom of what’s happened in order to help your child get back on
the losing track (and that’s meant in only the most positive way). Some ques-
tions to ponder and issues to consider include:
 How are things in the cafeteria? If he’s packing a healthy lunch, is he
actually eating it or chucking it and purchasing cheeseburgers and chili
fries every day?
 What kinds of activities has he been involved in? Losing weight 
effectively takes a combination of activity and healthy food choices.
Perhaps he’s not enjoying whatever activity he’s been involved in and
needs to explore other options.
 How’s his mindset? Is he feeling hopeless or resentful of this new
lifestyle? Is he longing for the old days of sitting around and eating in
front of the TV? He may need some gentle reminders about the long-term
health effects of obesity (see Chapter 3).
 What do his friends have to say about his weight loss? Is he being teased
because he won’t dive into the bag of chips at a pal’s house? Peer pressure
is a powerful force in a child’s life. Reassure him that losing weight is the
best thing for him, and his friends shouldn’t enter this picture.
We understand how, faced with a child’s backsliding, you can start to lose
heart. After all, weight loss isn’t the only thing going on in your busy life, and
you can’t follow your child around every minute of the day to ensure he’s
making the right decisions. But you have to remain a constant source of
unconditional love and support for your child, even when you’re feeling
upset or scared or angry with him for not following through in every aspect
of his weight-loss agenda. It may not be the only thing going on in your
household, but weight loss is one of the most important things you’ll ever be
faced with correcting. We’re talking about your child’s health. You’ve got a
limited window of opportunity to mitigate the damage his weight will eventu-
ally do to him and lead him away from a future filled with illness, such as
heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
Childhood obesity experts recommend a weekly weigh-in session for kids on
a weight-loss program. Fluctuations in weight over the course of a single day
are common, but stepping on the scale every morning or evening can be a
frustrating (and disheartening) experience for your child — and for you, too.
Instead, let your child pick a specific time of day one day during the week for
weigh-in. (Weighing in before breakfast one Monday and after dinner the fol-
lowing Monday won’t give you the truest weight-loss readings.)
Do your best to be encouraging even when the scale doesn’t help matters.
And remember that permanent weight loss takes time. If your child acknowl-
edges that he’s made a couple of mistakes in judgment during the past week
259
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

that have resulted in a backslide, that’s good. He’s learning what types of
behaviors result in weight gain and seeing the results of bad choices, right in
front of his eyes. Ensure him that he’ll do better next time, and then drop it.
Seeing Your Child Through Major Change
Every stage of childhood has its downside. A kid in elementary school wants
to be more independent, a high schooler often wants independence she’s not
ready for emotionally, and toddlers are simply ornery little people sometimes
who just want everything.
Parenting children is hard enough without adding the stress of weight loss
into the picture. When your obese child starts to drop pounds, you may sense
that she’s changing — for better or for worse. Of course, change is a normal
part of growing up. Most children, at some point, struggle with their identity,
test their parents’ limits and try their parents’ patience. Slimmed-down kids
are faced with unique challenges, however. Formerly obese children may find
themselves suddenly accepted by the very peers who have shunned them for
so long. In addition, a child who’s never had a social life is often ill equipped
to jump into peer group settings and make all the right moves after she’s lost a
significant amount of weight. This section will give you advice on how to see
your child through these types of major transitions without driving her — or
yourself — crazy. 
Dealing with a new identity
Now that your child has started to lose weight, you’ll hopefully start to see a
change in her personality for the better. She should be feeling better about
herself physically and emotionally. She may be making new friends and
branching out socially. In fact, she may seem like a different kid altogether
(and that’s not always a welcome sort of change when she seems a little full
of herself).
To put these changes in perspective, think about what she’s been through.
Overweight people of any age are often subjected to cruel remarks and
unkind behavior, and your child lived for several years (at least) with the
burden of being grossly overweight. She wasn’t able to participate in activi-
ties with her peers, and, as a result, she may have been an outcast. Now all of
that is changing. She’s being accepted — at last! With this acceptance, she’s
learning how to behave around other kids her age; what’s more, she’s trying
to figure out how to be like other kids her age.
260
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off

An obese child who has spent years being shunned by her classmates may
not know how to behave when they start accepting her. Give her time to
figure out who she really is — but don’t back down on rules you set for her
own good.
Setting rules for their own good
You probably already have rules in place in your home, such as no swearing,
no smoking, and no drinking. Maybe these activities were never an issue
because your child never had contact with anyone else, and he certainly
never went anywhere. Now that he’s becoming more social and trying new
things in his new body, stick to your guns and don’t relax the rules. Losing an
immense amount of weight, although it’s a great accomplishment, can result
in a scary change of identity for a child, and it won’t help him adjust if he
feels as though he’s been tossed out into a new world of endless possibilities
and no one’s keeping watch. If it was heartbreaking for you to watch him be
left out of dances and parties all these years, you may be very, very excited
that he’s finally going to have some sort of social life. Just keep everything in
perspective: He’s still a child, and like any child, he needs guidelines and
rules.
Here’s one truism about children: They’ll always try to push their limits and
break your rules. Kids who don’t have any rules to break are the ones who
often end up in real trouble because they need something to rebel against
(and they often end up fighting societal authorities, like teachers and cops,
instead of parental ones).
Putting your child’s change in perspective
Some of the change that a formerly obese child experiences is a normal part
of growing up. Preteens and teenagers aren’t always the easiest people to
deal with. Their hormone levels are all out of whack, which makes them
moody, and when you throw the emotional issue of weight and weight loss
into the mix, you may feel as though you’ve created a monster.
No matter how your child is behaving at the moment, you can bet the farm
that only some of it is related to his weight loss, which is why it’s vital that
you keep the lines of communication open. Imagine this scenario: Your preteen
son was teased for years by a group of popular kids that he (naturally) came
to hate. Now that he’s lost weight, these same kids aren’t being so mean to
him; in fact, during lunch and gym class, they’re actually being pretty cool,
talking to him, letting him in on their jokes, and treating him like he’s someone
worthy of their attention.
Of course this switch confuses your child. He knows that these kids haven’t
always been nice to him, so now he doesn’t know what to make of their 
attention. He may be so eager for their acceptance that he begins behaving 
261
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

in ways that he knows are wrong (like making fun of other kids who are obese,
just like he used to be). But of course, he wants to have friends — every kid
does. And almost every kid struggles with befriending bad influences at one
time or another.
If he can talk to you openly, assure him that problems with peers are a
normal part of growing up and that he’d probably feel the same confusion
even if he didn’t used to be obese. Remind him that overcoming obesity
taught him to make good choices in his life and he can carry that lesson over
into social settings now because he’ll face more big decisions as his peers
accept him as a “normal” kid.
Seeing a change in your child’s body that results in a change in his social life
is exciting — for him and for you. Just do your best to make sure that now
that he’s safe from the perils of obesity he doesn’t get himself into other
kinds of trouble.
Accepting newfound independence
As your child starts losing weight, the best situation you can hope for is a
happy balance between your involvement in your child’s weight loss and her
independence in the same venture. It’s a tough row for you to hoe when your
daughter orders you to stop fixing her meals, to stop accompanying her to
the scale on weigh-in day, and to stop talking to her about her weight. Period.
“Well!,” you think. “That’s a fine thank-you after all I’ve done for her!” Don’t
take it too personally. She needs to build this kind of self-confidence in her
own abilities to take care of herself. Do you really want her hanging around
your kitchen at age 30, waiting for you to make her lunch?
Girls and their mothers are particularly hard on one another where weight is
concerned. Although your daughter may have desperately needed your help
when she was obese, even then, the two of you may have had a hard time
agreeing on a weight-loss plan. If you’re also overweight (or if you’ve lost a
large amount of weight), you may be communicating unspoken messages to
your child without even realizing it. (Do you fret when she weighs in or wince
when she opens the refrigerator door?) 
Any parent who has a child with a health problem (and obesity falls into that
category) tends to be a bit overprotective at times. You’ve been worried
about this child for so long that you don’t know when it’s okay to stop. And
with obesity, it’s so easy for her to fall back into old habits. Some studies
even suggest that obese children who lose weight may tend to gain it back
more easily in the future.
262
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off

So where do you draw the line? You have no intention of standing by and
allowing her to undo all the good you’ve both worked so hard to achieve.
Well, you have to back off a little or else you risk mutiny. Show her you trust
her by easing up on the weight issue. You’ll always be able to discuss food in
some context (she has to eat, and someone has to shop for groceries), but for
now, do your best to avoid specific questions like, “What did you eat for
lunch today?” and “You haven’t been drinking soda at Amy’s house after
school, have you?”
Your child may be very eager to put the past behind her. If she’s conquered
her weight problem, she doesn’t want to associate herself with her former
overweight self anymore. You need to recognize that and stop asking her
questions that only make her feel that you’re dragging her back into an emo-
tional place that she doesn’t want to even think about anymore.
Let her embrace her independence and her new self. She has a lot to be
proud of and a lot to look forward to, so allow her to make her own choices
and decisions. You’ll always be watching out for problems with her weight,
but you don’t have to voice those concerns. If she starts putting the weight
back on, then it’s time to actively step in and be encouraging, not disparag-
ing. Until then, let go and let her find her own way. She may just surprise you.
Celebrating Your Child’s Accomplishment
What kind of celebration is appropriate when your child reaches her goal
weight? Is it wrong to make a big deal out of her success? What if she back-
slides? Will a big acknowledgement now only make her feel worse if she puts
the weight back on?
Yes, make a big deal out of her accomplishment because it’s worth celebrating!
She’s on her way to a happier, healthier, brighter future unencumbered by the
burden of extra weight and all the miseries (both physical and emotional)
associated with it.
Obviously, you don’t want to center this celebration around food, so get 
creative and do something that your child will enjoy. Encourage an activity
that has somewhat healthy benefits, whether they’re social or physical. For
example, don’t send mixed messages by renting five videos for her to watch
in one weekend. Avoid promoting her old habits, which are so easy to slip
right back into. Consider the following celebration ideas (and reshape them
as needed to suit your own child).
263
Chapter 15: Keeping the Weight Off

 Let loose with friends: Has she been bugging you to have a big sleepover?
Now’s a great time for it. She’s feeling more comfortable in her own skin
and may need opportunities to strengthen her social skills. Be sure to
supply plenty of healthy snacks, and limit the videos to one or two.
Encourage other activities, like crafts or games.
 Get sporty: Has she been asking for a ski pass or a new bike? Awesome.
If her sporting heart’s desire is too expensive, encourage her to join
local sports games or other activities. You want her to enjoy and pursue
social and physical activities.
 Try some new clothes: Is there some article of clothing she’s wanted for
a long time and could never wear when she was heavy? Maybe she was
never comfortable in jeans, and now she’s asking for a stylish pair. She’s
starting to feel like a regular kid now, and she wants to look the part,
too, so take her on a shopping trip.
 Have a mini-makeover: Does she want to try a new hairstyle or pierce
her ears? These minor cosmetic alterations are often rites of passage for
kids. In addition, your child may want to leave her old self behind as
much as possible. Let her do it on the condition that any changes she
makes are gradual. She’s undergone a lot of physical changes during the
past several months and should take things slowly whenever possible.
Let your child know how proud you are of her determination to stick to the
program, and then take time to congratulate yourself. Plenty of parents don’t
recognize the signs or seriousness of childhood obesity (even when the signs
are obvious to everyone else). You’ve done your absolute best by this child,
and that’s the mark of a truly great parent.
Your family has learned so much throughout this weight loss process, and
you’re all now well educated in the finer points of losing weight and keeping
it off for good. As we say in the “Being alert for signs of backsliding” section
earlier in the chapter, backsliding does happen, but children whose parents
are involved in establishing and enforcing healthy rules around the house do
much better in the long term than children whose parents don’t do these
things.
Looking to a Happier, Healthier Future
Realistically speaking, what measure of long-term success can you expect
from your child’s weight loss? Because childhood obesity is such a common
health problem these days, you’d think an abundance of information would
be available. Shockingly, few studies have been done on how obese children
fare in the long term where weight loss is concerned. As we discuss in
264
Part III: Managing, Troubleshooting, and Keeping the Weight Off

Chapter 3, doctors are very concerned about the health effects of obesity on
children as they grow into adults, but so far, that concern hasn’t trickled
down into funding studies examining how successful obese children are at
keeping the weight off.
However, Dr. Leonard H. Epstein, an expert in the field of childhood obesity,
has conducted several studies on the role that parents play in their child’s
weight loss. He’s found that children whose parents join them in some sort of
educational weight-loss program are more likely to lose the weight to begin
with and to keep it off years down the line.
Years ago, pediatricians spoke directly to obese children about losing weight
and eating healthy foods, gym teachers talked to them about increasing 
physical activity, and teachers took special interest in their social needs.
Nowadays, most adults who deal with children realize that in order to get a
message through to a child, they have to go through the parent. Parents 
usually have more of an influence on their children than any other authority
figure in that child’s life. 
You have more power over your child’s long-term weight-loss success than
you may realize; recognize that fact and use it to her advantage. To do this,
you can’t simply be involved. You have to commit to leading a healthy life.
Learn about nutrition (see Chapter 7 for help); know how to plan a menu
(check out Chapter 8 for menu planning tips, Chapter 9 for cooking information,
and Appendix A near the end of this book for meal ideas); and have a solid
plan in place for getting and keeping everyone active (read Chapter 10 for
exercise tips). 
Above all else, remember that you have a tremendous amount of power and
influence over your child. You largely control how well (or how poorly) your
child eats. Your encouragement has a tremendous impact on how she feels
about exercise. Become your child’s primary source of information and support
by keeping yourself interested and educated on the subject (by reading up on
the latest studies and trying out new recipes and activities). If you can stick
with it, your child will be more likely to succeed — by simply following along
with your plan.

hen you first begin changing the way you shop, the way you cook, the
way your family eats, and the ways in which everyone in the household
spends their time, it seems like you have a long, long road ahead and that
permanent change and its positive effects are light years away. Well, they aren’t.
Now, don’t get us wrong; we’re not saying that any of this is going to be easy.
But when the family makes significant strides in beating back old habits,
you’ll probably be amazed at how happy you all are to have left the old ways
behind. Yes, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to get there, and at
times it may seem as though you’ll never reach that point. This chapter gives
you a glimpse into the great changes you can expect to see for your child in
the future.
Increasing Self-Esteem
An obese child has a hard time fitting in with her peers; she may be the subject
of teasing and cruel comments at school or in public. When she starts losing
weight and feeling better both physically and emotionally, you’ll see a change
in her mood. She may become more outgoing and show interest in activities
you never would have dreamed she’d want to try! At the very least, her attitude

about things in general will be markedly improved when she feels good about
herself. If you’ve spent years worrying about this child, this change in her
outlook on life will be a relief — like letting go of a deep breath you didn’t
even know you were holding.
Getting Rid of Aches
Excess weight has a tremendous negative effect on bones and ligaments. Obese
children can suffer from aches and pains that prevent them from partaking in
physical activities. This problem can be so serious, in fact, that the shinbones
in obese children can become deformed from the amount of weight they bear
(see Chapter 3 for more). If permanent damage like this hasn’t already
occurred, then a child will feel her orthopedic aches and pains start to subside
when she starts losing weight. The better she feels physically, the more active
she can become. And the more she can do, the more she’ll want to do.
Elevating Energy
An overweight child may have a hard time getting involved in any kind of
activity because he has no energy. The foods he’s been eating probably provide
little in the way of significant nutrition, and his body just isn’t up to the task
of being active — at least not yet. It takes time, but leading a healthy lifestyle
results in an increase of energy. It’s only natural: Vitamins and minerals work
inside the body; their job is to make us feel well. (For the scoop on nutrition,
check out Chapter 7.) Being active may wear your child out at first, but as his
muscles become accustomed to regular exercise, you should see a definite
change — a decrease in the panting and huffing and the ability to play for
longer periods of time. And the very best part of increased energy levels —
the desire to get outside and move.
Opening the Lines of Communication
Enforcing the no-eating-in-front-of-the-TV rule in your household may just
encourage everyone to actually — gasp! — talk to each other at mealtimes.
Even if you don’t sense any major communication gaps in your family unit,
you’ll probably be surprised by how sitting down to a meal together really
makes everyone feel connected, just by being together for a period of time.
You discuss problems and share happy times, and everyone feels as though
270
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

they belong to something solid — the family. And if the kids help out with the
preparation of the meal, that’s a great time to subtly educate them on the
finer points of healthy eating. (Chapter 11 has lots of ideas for initiating
enjoyable family mealtimes.)
Looking for New Adventures
When your family’s looking for new ways to eat and new opportunities to
become active, new worlds open up to you. For example, places you never
would have thought of visiting before are now your family’s weekend stomping
(and hiking) grounds, and you’re regularly cooking foods you never tried
before! When overall health improves, energy increases, and life seems brand
new. You won’t believe all the things your family has been missing. Don’t fight
it; get out there and explore, explore, explore! (Read Chapter 10 for tips on
getting the whole family involved in exercise, and see the Appendix A for
some interesting low-fat menu options.)
Finding Hidden Talents
In addition to discovering places that you never knew existed, by increasing
your activity levels, your whole family is likely to uncover abilities that they
may not have known they had. After all, your son probably won’t discover
that he has an aptitude for ice skating if he’s sitting in front of the TV every
day, and your daughter may never know that she’s a great swimmer if she
never tries it. And as for you, you may find out that, contrary to everything
you’ve believed all these years, you’re a great cook! In order to learn about
yourselves, you have to try out as many activities as you’re capable of . . .
and see what happens.
Inspiring and Helping Others
Your child is likely to have great sympathy and empathy for other overweight
kids. When he’s down to a healthy weight range, he may feel as though he
wants to help everyone overcome their weight problems! Although it may not
be a great idea to let him set up a soapbox in the yard, if you find some sort
of weight-loss advocacy group in your area, he may make a great peer counselor
for an overweight child who truly needs a pal and a role model.
271
Chapter 16: Ten Reasons Lifestyle Changes Will Make a Difference

He Loses, You Lose (The Worry),
Everyone Wins
Here’s a simple way to look at your child’s weight loss: When he’s at a healthy
weight and he knows all about making healthy choices, he’s at lower risk for a
lot of health problems. He’s also at lower risk for feeling like an outcast among
his peers, and he’s more likely to have the confidence to go out and develop
his natural talents, which translates into a better chance for a happy, secure
future. Now, we’re not saying that losing weight is a cure-all for every problem
your child will ever encounter, but let’s face facts: Growing up is hard enough
without the added burden of being obese. If your child can get rid of the
weight, he’ll have licked a significant problem, which will only bolster his confi-
dence when he’s faced with other dilemmas. And when he can successfully
deal with anything life throws his way, you’ll sleep better at night. Honestly.
Achieving Better Long-Term Health
It’s almost inconceivable to think a young adult in his 20s could be at high
risk for heart disease and stroke, but that’s the case more and more as the
youth of this country become heavier. An obese child is at risk for developing
type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, sleep apnea, and a myriad of
other health problems and dealing with these problems for the rest of his or
her life. (Flip to Chapter 3 for more on obesity-related health problems.)
Dropping weight improves both short- and long-term health. Your 8-year-old
could be laying the groundwork in his body right now that will contribute to
future health problems. Changing your family’s lifestyle can prevent and
sometimes even correct health issues that are related to excess weight.
Looking Good!
Of course, a healthy lifestyle is primarily about health. But when the family is
eating healthy foods, being more active, learning about their hidden talents,
and feeling better about life in general, you’ll start to see more smiles more
often. You’ll catch a little twinkle in your son’s eyes, and your daughter may
suddenly start paying more attention to her appearance as she gets ready for
school. These changes are in addition to the physical changes associated with
weight loss, and all the changes add up and make your child feel better both
emotionally and physically. You’re sure to see the glow that a person gets when
he’s comfortable in his own skin — and that’s what’s really important.

Ten Tips for Maintaining 
Weight Loss
In This Chapter
 Fighting cravings
 Keeping active
 Involving the whole family
 Leaving old habits behind
A
s you well know, changing your family’s lifestyle is no easy feat, and it’s
not as though you can circle a day on your calendar when you expect to
be “finished” with the task. A healthy lifestyle is a lifelong goal and an ongoing
process. Stressful events or boredom may knock your child off the healthy-
living track, and he may want to revert right back to his old ways. After your
child loses weight and is feeling and looking healthier, how can you help him
maintain his enthusiasm and energy level so that you never have to start this
whole process over again? This chapter provides some useful tips for keeping
everyone in a healthy state of mind and body.
Turning Away from Temptation
To keep your child on track with his healthy lifestyle, teach him to walk 
away from tempting situations — literally, if possible. There’s nothing weak
or cowardly about removing oneself from a potentially harmful situation. If
your adolescent sees a cake in a bakery window, for example, all he has to do 
is make his feet take him somewhere else. Teach your school-age child how
to say no politely but with conviction so that when he has to make the right
decision, like when he’s offered an ice cream sundae at a friend’s house, he
isn’t pressured into accepting the treat by a well-meaning adult. (Chapter 12
offers more advice that you can give your child on how to resist temptation.)

Keeping Moving
Teach your child that all activity counts, whether it’s 10 minutes or 30 minutes
at a time. The point is to move more throughout the day, and the goal is to fit
30 minutes of at least moderate activity (such as walking, biking, or playing
tag) into every day. (Check out Chapter 10 for activities that are appropriate
for every age group.)
Suppose your high-schooler doesn’t have time for structured exercise every
single day. Tell her to park her car at the farthest point of the school parking
lot and walk the extra distance. Instead of driving her to her friend’s house,
let her hoof it down the street. Encourage her to think about making the
choice to be the most active that she can be, in every situation, and activity
will become second nature to her. (And she’ll never waste time looking for a
close parking spot again!)
Weighing In
You don’t want your child to become obsessed with the scale, but he does
need to check in with it every now and then, just to make sure that every-
thing is proceeding as it should. A once-a-week weigh-in is plenty. Weighing in
every day is too frequent and may frustrate your child because weight can
fluctuate from day to day; weighing once a month is too seldom because any
backsliding may be difficult to correct if it has gone on for several weeks.
Encourage your child to choose a weigh-in day, and advise him to weigh in at
the same time each day.
Enforcing the House Rules
At the very least, the rules in a healthy house should include the following:
 No eating in front of the TV
 Family dinners several times a week
 No distractions during meals (meaning no TV, laptops, books, newspapers,
and so on)
For more on household ground rules, check out Chapter 11.
274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Getting Everyone Involved
When the entire family is subject to the same set of standards regarding
meals and activity, enforcing health-promoting rules (like no eating in front of
the TV, shutting the TV off altogether on nice days, and taking everyone on a
bike ride) is a lot easier. A child of any age will have a hard time accepting
that her mom, dad, or siblings can do and eat whatever they want while she
has to give up her favorite treats and nonactivities. Your child stands a better
chance of long-term success if the entire family switches to a healthier
lifestyle, regardless of who’s thin and who needs to lose a few pounds. 
Junking the Junk Food for Good!
When the initial enthusiasm over replacing sugary or fat-laden snacks with
healthy foods in your household dies down, or after your child has shown
significant strides in losing weight and increasing her activity level, you may
be tempted to start buying your family’s old favorite snacks — just enough so
that everyone can have a little, but not so much that anyone will start gaining
weight. What’s life without a treat now and then, you ask?
You’re entering very dangerous territory with this kind of thinking. Sure, an
occasional treat is fine, but bringing junk food into the house — even in small
quantities — can undo everything your child has worked so hard to achieve.
Remember, one of your goals in making healthier choices is to change your
child’s craving for sweets and other treats — the foods that, by the way,
made him overweight in the first place. To offer these foods to him is just
confusing and counterproductive. And completely unnecessary. A piece of
cake at a birthday party isn’t the end of the world, but if you bring home a
cake and he eats the whole thing, he may feel like a failure. Save yourselves
the confusion and just stick to a no-junk policy.
Sacking Mealtime Snacks
Letting the kids help out when you’re preparing healthy meals is a great way
for them to learn about healthy living, and it’s also a chance for you to connect
with them after a busy day spent doing your own things. However, make sure
that they’re not snacking throughout the meal prep. Even if it’s healthy food,
if your child overeats, he’s going to gain weight. That’s the simple truth. It’s
possible to eat the equivalent of an entire meal while preparing a meal, so
keep an eye out for this kind of behavior and nip it in the bud. Mealtime
snacking is just a bad habit to get into.
275
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Maintaining Weight Loss

Kissing Off Bad Habits
Be vigilant about not allowing your child to slide back into her old ways after
the weight has come off. For example, when she’s feeling healthier and you can
see a major difference in her energy and happiness levels, she may forget that
her love of watching TV contributed to her weight gain in the first place; and
because she isn’t obese anymore, she may figure that she’s in a kind of “safe
zone.” She may believe, for example, that she can watch TV to her heart’s con-
tent because she isn’t heavy anymore. That kind of thinking is just the first step
toward cutting corners in other areas, too. (Maybe she’ll just take a walk twice
a week rather than every day, and maybe she can have cookies every day as
long as she doesn’t also have a cheeseburger.) Encourage her to cling to her
new, healthy habits and leave the past where it belongs. (Chapter 15 offers tips
on catching this type of backsliding and correcting it before it goes too far.)
Getting Support
If you know of a support group in your area for overweight children and their
families, check it out (even if you’re not normally a “joiner”). Knowing that you
aren’t the only parent to face a child’s weight problem can be a tremendous
relief in times of stress. And letting your child know that he isn’t some sort of
unusual specimen — that there are other kids out there who are also changing
their lifestyles and trying to lose weight — may just be the boost he needs to
continue on this path when he’s gets a little tired of the whole thing. (Chapter
14 has tips on when and where you might look for some outside help.)
Seeking Out New Information
Even if you consider yourself pretty well informed, there’s always more to dis-
cover about healthy living and weight loss. Dedicate some time each week to
finding new recipes and investigating new activities for your child and the rest
of the family to try. Experts devote their entire careers to finding ways to
improve and maintain weight loss, so don’t let their hard work go unnoticed —
become an expert yourself by doing regular research on these topics. As we
say throughout the book, healthy living isn’t synonymous with leading a
boring, bland life. The more you know about healthy options (both for eating
and exercising), the more likely your family is to stick with this healthier
lifestyle.

Ten Ways to Cut Fat and Calories
from Your Family’s Diet
In This Chapter
 Doing away with hidden fat
 Preparing your kitchen for healthy cooking
 Making healthy substitutions
W
hen you begin the process of turning your family’s lifestyle around,
you have so much to consider that it’s easy to miss a major thing or
two. If you ban fast food but continue to bring home sugary drinks, you’ve
done half the job well. If you prepare a healthy sandwich for your teenager
and watch him heap gobs of mayonnaise on top . . . again, that’s only partially
healthy. To help you go all the way, this chapter is filled with reminders for
cutting out the hidden sources of fat and calories in your family’s diet.
Skip Fast Food
One of the best things you can do for both your child’s weight loss and your
entire family’s health is declare a moratorium on fast food. Don’t just cut
back to once or twice a week — cut it out completely and start cooking
healthy meals at home. Most fast food contains an enormous amount of fat;
some items even contain more fat than an adult’s recommended daily
allowance! So if the kids are clamoring for shakes and burgers, pretend your
car just won’t make the turn into the parking lot anymore and head for the
safety — and healthfulness — of your own kitchen.

Say Fry-Bye
Before you do anything else in your kitchen, toss your deep fryer into the
trash. If you use a frying pan for your deep-fried foods, stop! Frying is hands
down the worst form of cooking as far as your family’s health is concerned.
Fried foods absorb so much fat that even healthy foods like veggies can’t
offer anything in the way of nutrition after they’ve been crisped to within an
inch of their lives. Plus, research indicates that eating fried foods not only
contributes to heart disease but may also lead to the development of certain
types of cancer.
Choose Snacks Wisely
You don’t have to cut snacks out of your kids’ lives in order to keep their fat
consumption low. Let them have low-fat yogurt, pretzels, animal crackers,
skim-milk string cheese, fruit, whole-wheat toast, low-sugar cereal, veggies . . .
there’s plenty out there to choose from. Just remember: An entire bowl of low-
sugar cereal with skim milk and fruit is far better nutritionally and fat-wise
than half a doughnut.
Hey, Hey! Ho, Ho! Condiments 
Have Got to Go!
We’re talking high-fat condiments, such as high-fat dressings, regular 
mayonnaise, and cheese- or butter-based sauces. Condiments are one of
those food items that people tend to think don’t really count because 
they’re added to other foods. Make sure that you read the nutrition labels 
on condiments, and teach your kids to do the same. Your child may make 
a beautiful veggie wrap and then douse it with blue cheese dressing, not
realizing that she’s adding fat to her otherwise extremely nutritious meal.
Vinegar, mustard, salsa, hot sauce, plain yogurt, salt, pepper, and various
herbs (dried or fresh from the garden — experiment with different tastes!)
are good low-fat, low-calorie, all-purpose toppers to food.

Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Cut Fat and Calories from Your Family’s Diet
So Long, Sweet Drinks
Sugar-sweetened juices and sodas are among the worst beverages you can
keep in the house. Sugary juice contains almost no nutrients to speak of, and
soda contains absolutely nothing that a growing child needs. Kids who drink
these beverages tend to drink a lot of them (in other words, they don’t stop
at one 8-ounce serving), which means they take in vast amounts of excess
sugar, which is then converted into fat. Rather than sugar-sweetened drinks,
keep skim or 1 percent milk in the fridge, and encourage kids to drink lots of
water. The body actually needs and can use certain elements contained in
those liquids. If your kids absolutely must eat something sweet, give them
some fresh fruit.
Prep Your Kitchen
Get more comfortable in a well-stocked kitchen, and your meal planning will
be a snap. Instead of falling back on your old, timeworn (but not very
healthy) recipes, you’ll be eager to try new things and repeat new favorites.
You’re less likely to fall into old ways if you’ve made things as easy as possible
for yourself, so if you need new kitchen equipment — sharper knives, a food
processor, a steaming basket for veggies, and so on — to handle your veggies
and lean cuts of meat, go stock up!
Know Your Substitutes
Did you know that you can use applesauce rather than vegetable oil in many
cooking recipes, or that you can use low-fat ricotta cheese in place of cream
cheese? Skim milk replaces whole milk in almost any recipe, and frozen
yogurt can stand in for whipped cream topping. You really can make almost
any recipe healthier by knowing how to replace high-fat ingredients with
healthier substitutes. After you make a switch here and there, you get the
hang of it, and you may even come up with your own favorite substitutes!
Prepare for Busy Days
Your family is far less likely to fall prey to the lures of fast food or ordering in
if the freezer holds a week’s worth of healthy meals. Double or triple the
recipes when you cook, and freeze the extras for days when you just don’t
have the time to lay out a freshly prepared meal.

Go Skimmy Dipping
Everyone needs dairy in their diets. The USDA food pyramid recommends
two to three servings daily, and kids, especially, need calcium for their growing
bones and developing teeth. But your family does not need whole-milk 
products; their high fat content doesn’t make them healthier. Skim dairy
products provide your family with all the vitamins and minerals they need with-
out all the fat. (And plain low-fat yogurt, by the way, is a great substitute for
sour cream!)
Make Healthy Even Better
When you make a healthy meal, make it the best it can be. Rinse cooked lean
ground beef with hot water after draining it to get more fat out. Separate your
gravy, and skim the fat off the top of your homemade soups (just stick the
container in the fridge and wait for the fat to congeal on the top). Trim the 
fat from cuts of meat before cooking them. Don’t drown salads in high-fat
dressings. Keep butter out of your skillet when you stir-fry. Always ask yourself,
“Is there a way I can make this meal even better for my family?” and then do it.

Ten Fun Ways to Fit Exercise 
Into Your Child’s Day
In This Chapter
 Rethinking the meaning of “exercise”
 Exploring the great outdoors
 Letting loose
W
hen you get to be a certain age, it’s exhausting to even consider
putting an exercise DVD on and jumping around your living room for
an hour. However, you know that in order to help your child lose weight, you
have to play a part in getting her moving. You set an example for your child,
so if you hate exercise, why shouldn’t she? How on earth are you going to get
motivated past your own feelings on exercise, anyway?
We’ve got good news for your whole family: Exercise doesn’t have to be a
structured, timed activity. It can include almost any type of movement. And
the more fun the activity, the better the chance your child — and you — will
want to do it again and again! This chapter gives you some fun and easy exer-
cise ideas to get everyone moving.
Walk
Walk with your child wherever and whenever you can. Walk to the store, to
the park, to Grandma’s, and to friends’ homes. Don’t let the weather be an
excuse to drive wherever your feet can take you. Invest in some rain- and
cold-weather gear, and hop to it! Walking is one of the easiest exercises to do,
even for a child who is significantly overweight. Chat him up while you walk
to take his mind off the fact that he may be getting tired. Make it fun, and he’ll
want to do it again.

If your child is older and independent enough to travel on foot alone, don’t
drive him to a destination that’s within walking distance. He needs to start
thinking of the healthiest ways to get through his day, which start with being
as active as possible.
Bring the Dog
A child who is less than eager to take a walk, play in the yard, or explore a
nature trail may be persuaded to do so if a little four-legged friend is allowed
to come along. If you don’t already have a pet, borrow a friend’s dog (as long
as it’s kid friendly). If your child sees the activity as doing something nice for
a lovable animal, he may be more excited about moving his feet down the
street or through the park.
Tag!
Play games in the yard that involve running. Tag, Capture the Flag, Ghost in the
Graveyard, Manhunt . . . remember these from your own childhood? There’s no
reason you can’t get outside with your kids and instigate a little fun. Some kids
really need that kind of extra nudge from Mom and/or Dad to get the game
going. If they’re ready to take things to another level, try a game of kickball, flag
football, or soccer. It’s good for the kids, and it’s good for you, too.
Dust Off the Bikes
Biking is a fun, easy, low-impact way to get your family exercising. Ride
around the neighborhood, or find parks or bike trails to explore. Make sure
everyone is outfitted with a helmet, including yourself. (We know it gives you
helmet head, but you’re setting a good example, remember?) If your child is
reluctant to pedal his way around the block, think about adding some bells
and whistles to his cycle. Sometimes having a cool bike to show off to his
friends is all it takes to get a kid off and burning some rubber.
282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Racers, Take Your Marks
Encourage your kids to race each other, either on foot in the yard or around
the block on their bikes (as long as it’s safe to do so, of course). Make sure
the competition is fair — you can’t put your overweight youngster up against
an older, more active child and expect a fair race. If you can’t find an even
match, race your child yourself (and don’t try too terribly hard to come out
the winner). You can also let him compete against himself by investing in a
stopwatch and timing how long it takes him to get from one point to another.
When his time starts to drop, you’ll see him put in more and more effort to
get that time even lower.
Visit Mother Nature
One way to introduce your child to hiking trails is to make a game out of it.
Nature is always changing, so pick a theme for the day, like, “Who can find the
most interesting rock?” or “How many different kinds of leaves can we find
today?” It may sound silly, but kids love to have a mission, and it keeps them
busy for a long, long time. Don’t forget to bring along a bag so that your child
can carry her treasures home if she wants to (and if it’s appropriate — you
don’t want her to pick rare flowers when a posted sign says not to).
Introduce Something New
Being active is a lifelong goal. You want your child to be active every day, so
from time to time, he may become bored with whatever he’s doing. When
things start getting a little stale — you’ve taken 100 nature walks together,
he’s played soccer in the yard 87 times, and his bike’s tires have gone flat
from all the riding he’s done — help him look for something new. Take him
golfing. Sign him up for tennis lessons. Maybe he’d love rollerblading. Skiing
may be a blast for him. With so many activities out there, he’s sure to find
one he likes. Whatever he wants to try, encourage him. If it doesn’t work out,
try something else.
283
Chapter 19: Ten Fun Ways to Fit Exercise Into Your Child’s Day

Work Those Kids
Yard work or other household chores can be pretty labor intensive, so stop
doing everything yourself, and let your child help out with the chores. Have
her rake the leaves and haul them back to the edge of your property, mow
the lawn, or wash the car. Of course, some kids don’t consider this kind of
work fun, but others can’t wait to start building leaf piles and sudsing up the
minivan.
Try not to have high expectations of the quality of work, especially if your
child is still young. The point is getting her to move her muscles, not create a
perfectly manicured lawn.
Dance, Baby, Dance!
Turn up the radio and start grooving with the kids. They’ll never even know
what hit them, but when you’re all through, everyone will be sweaty and
laughing. Encourage creative moves, and show them a few steps from back in
your day. (The Bus Stop? Electric Slide? Macarena?) Your kids won’t believe
their eyes when they see you showing off your expertise.
Make a Kid-Safe Playroom
When it’s raining or all of 4 degrees outside, you may have some trouble get-
ting your child involved in activities. So create a kid-safe room in the house
where he can run, jump, and somersault to his heart’s content. (Young kids,
especially, need room to roam.) Consider putting a small climber somewhere
in your house for your child to play on in inclement weather. Have an old
couch sitting around? Let your child use its cushions for jumping and rolling
(and throwing). Just remember, if you have kids, your house is never going to
look perfect until they move out, anyway — you may as well let them have a
safe, padded space of their own to get a little crazy in.

earning to eat well isn’t about sacrificing every
food your family has ever enjoyed. We assure
you, healthy meals can go way beyond plain greens
and bland chicken breasts. In this Appendix, 
we’ve compiled tasty, out-of-the-ordinary, low-fat,
healthy recipes to cover the day from sunup to sun-
down. One thing you should know — and 
your family should learn — is that cutting the 
fat out of your diet doesn’t mean that you have to eat
the same foods prepared the same ways all the time.
What a bore that would be for your taste buds!
Unfortunately, many families never get beyond this
misconception, and their attempts at healthy eating
end before they’ve done much in the way of culinary
exploration. We’re sure that you’ll find something of
interest and a few new favorites here!
In addition to recipes provided by this book’s 
coauthors, this Appendix includes contributions
from several professionals in the healthy-eating
arena: Megan Brenn-White, a chef and author who
has worked in New York City and California and is a
frequent contributor to the Food Network Web site;
Julie Negrin, Director of Culinary Arts at the JCC in
Manhattan, who has appeared on the Today Show;
and Cindy Guirino, RD, LD, CDE, ACE Personal
Trainer, and founder of UB-Fit, LLC Medical Nutrition
Therapy.

school, but you can also use this time as a way to connect with each other
and discuss (and prepare for) your plans for the busy day ahead. Toss those
high-sugar cereals in the trash can and send everyone off fortified with a
nutritious meal.
Egg White Omelet
For a nutritionally complete start to the day, serve this tasty and colorful omelet with
toast, fresh fruit, and juice.
Preparation Time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
2 eggs
1⁄4 cup skim milk
1⁄2 tomato, diced 
1⁄4 cup fresh spinach
1-ounce slice nonfat cheese
1 Spray a medium skillet with cooking spray and heat for 2 minutes over medium heat.
2 Separate the egg whites from the yolks, and beat the whites in a bowl with the skim
milk. Discard the yolks.
3 Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, tilting the pan so that the egg covers the bottom.
Add the veggies and cheese to one half of the egg, and fold the other side over top.
Remove from skillet when egg is set. Season to taste.

(Dietary Fiber 1g); Protein 20g.
T Apple Carrot Muffins
These muffins combine a fruit and a veggie into one tidy, portable package. And they’re
moist enough that you and your kids won’t be tempted to slather them in butter — trust
us! (This recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Yield: 12 muffins

289
Appendix A: Recipes
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a large bowl, mix the whole-wheat flour, white flour, baking powder, salt, and 
cinnamon.
3 In a separate bowl, blend the eggs, sugar, and vegetable oil until well combined. Stir in
the grated apple and carrot.
4 Pour the wet ingredients from Step 3 into the bowl containing the dry ingredients from
Step 2, and mix thoroughly.
5 Fill the muffin cups three-quarters full with batter, and bake for 25 minutes.

26g (Dietary Fiber 2g); Protein 4g.
T Oatmeal with Stir-Ins
Oatmeal is a warm, nutritious start to a child’s day. Unfortunately, children who love
oatmeal are usually accustomed to the super-sweetened varieties that offer up more
sugar than anything else. This recipe starts with basic rolled oats and sweetens the
bowl naturally.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1 cup white flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 eggs
1⁄2 cup sugar
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup grated apple (unpeeled)
1 cup grated carrot (peeled)
1⁄2 cup old-fashioned oats
1 cup water or 1 percent milk
1⁄2 cup sliced fresh fruit
1 Prepare oats according to package directions. Use milk in place of water for creamier
oatmeal.
2 Stir your child’s favorite fresh fruit into the oats before serving.

(Dietary Fiber 5g); Protein 6g.

T Roll-Ups
Kids will love this breakfast because it’s tasty and fun in a finger-food kind of way. You’ll
love these roll-ups because they’re so easy, quick, and healthy. (This recipe comes from
Cindy Guirino, founder of UB-Fit in Dayton, Ohio.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
290
Part V: Appendixes 
One 8-inch whole-wheat tortilla
1 medium apple
1-ounce slice low-fat or nonfat cheese
Cinnamon to taste
1 Wash the apple and cut it into thin slices.
2 Lay the tortilla flat on your work surface, and place the apple slices down the center of
it. Top with the cheese, and sprinkle with cinnamon.
3 Fold the sides of the tortilla in toward the center, and then roll the whole thing up.
4 Microwave the roll-up for 15 to 30 seconds before serving.
Per serving: Calories 204 (From Fat 27); Fat 3g (Saturated 1g); Cholesterol 6mg; Sodium 345mg; Carbohydrate 42g
(Dietary Fiber 6g); Protein 10g.
Lunch
Resist the urge to hand your child’s nutritional needs over to the school cafe-
teria. Some schools provide healthy meals, but many others don’t. Fast food,
soda, and ice cream are the rules rather than the exception in some school
lunchrooms. The good news is that you can teach your child to prepare her
own healthy, delicious lunch to take with her. And you can bet your bottom
dollar that, unlike junk food, the following meals will provide her with the
long-lasting energy she needs to see her through the rest of the school day!

Turkey Pita
Who says a healthy lunch can’t also be delicious and fun to make? Pita bread looks just
like a pocket when you cut it in half and separate the two layers, so it’s not surprising
that kids love it. They’re sure to get a kick out of stuffing the pocket with food — just
make sure the filling’s healthy!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
291
Appendix A: Recipes
1⁄2 pita
3 ounces precooked white-meat turkey
3 lettuce leaves
2 tomato slices
1 tablespoon mustard
1 Carefully separate the two sides of the pita pocket.
2 Trim any fat from the turkey slices. If you’re using cold cuts, make sure it’s breast meat.
3 Arrange the turkey, lettuce, and tomato inside the pocket. Top with mustard.
Tip: Serve this pita sandwich with carrot sticks, and offer animal crackers or fresh fruit for
dessert.
Per serving: Calories 222 (From Fat 15); Fat 2g (Saturated 0g); Cholesterol 71mg; Sodium 380mg; Carbohydrate

T Fruit Pizza
What better way to get your kids to eat fruit than to put it on a pizza? Everybody loves
pizza! This recipe is quick and fun because it allows everyone to get creative with their
favorite fruits.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
292
Part V: Appendixes 
Pizza crust mix (preferably one made with
whole-wheat flour)
1⁄2 cup natural applesauce
2 cups fresh or thawed frozen fruit of your
choice (allow fruit to drain well)
1 Mix crust according to package directions and spread onto a baking sheet. Bake the
crust at the oven temperature listed on the package until it’s golden brown, and then
remove it from the oven.
2 Spread applesauce on top of the partially cooked pizza crust.
3 Place the fruit on top of the pizza and put it back into the oven for 10 minutes.

T Fruit-Filled Spring Rolls
If your family’s clamoring for Chinese, spring this recipe on them! These rolls go over
well with kids because they have a lot of different fruits in them and are especially tasty
dipped in low-fat yogurt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
2 bananas, thinly sliced into rounds
11⁄2 cups strawberries, cut lengthwise into
quarters
2 peaches, peeled and sliced
1 cup raspberries
1 cup blueberries
3⁄4 cup low-fat strawberry yogurt
12 large square sheets rice paper
Chopped mint for garnish (optional)
2 cups low-fat strawberry yogurt for dipping
(optional)

1 Place 1 sheet of rice paper into a bowl of warm water and press down gently to sub-
merge it. Allow the paper to sit in the water for 1 minute, and then remove it carefully,
taking care not to tear it. Place the rice paper sheet flat on a plate.
2 Spread 1 tablespoon of yogurt over the top, and spread slices of fruit down the middle
of the sheet.
3 Fold 2 sides of the rice paper in over the fruit, and roll up the rest of the paper.
4 Cut the roll in half diagonally. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 to make 12 spring rolls.
5 Garnish the rolls with mint and serve with yogurt for dipping (if desired).
Tip: In place of fresh peaches, raspberries, and blueberries, you can use thawed frozen
fruit.
Per serving: Calories 93 (From Fat 3); Fat 0g (Saturated 0g); Cholesterol 0mg; Sodium 37mg; Carbohydrate 25g
(Dietary Fiber 3g); Protein 2g.
T Walking Fruit Salad
When you’re heading out the door for a hike or a day in the park, you need a healthy,
portable snack. These fruit-filled apples certainly qualify, and they provide lots of
energy, too!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄2-apple servings
293
Appendix A: Recipes
2 medium apples, any variety
1⁄4 cup grapes, halved
1⁄4 cup raisins
1⁄4 cup crushed pineapple, drained

Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

1 red or green bell pepper, chopped 
1⁄2 cucumber, chopped 
1 red tomato, chopped
1⁄4 cup sliced red onion
1⁄3 cup grated carrots
1⁄4 cup crumbled nonfat or low-fat feta cheese
1 cup alfalfa sprouts
1 Spread 2 tablespoons of salsa over one side of each tortilla.
2 Divide the remaining ingredients evenly among the tortillas, sprinkling the veggies and
cheese down the center of each tortilla.
3 Roll up each tortilla, and cut it in half diagonally.
Tip: You can substitute your favorite vegetable for any of the ones in the ingredient list.

Snacks, Drinks, and Frozen Treats
Snack time may be when your best intentions break down. While you’re scram-
bling to put together a healthy meal for dinner, the kids are clamoring for chips,
microwave popcorn, and soda, and you consider letting down your guard just
because it’s the easiest thing to do — or so you think. Healthy snacks can be
convenient and delicious; the key is to prepare them ahead of time.
T Veggies and Yogurt Dip
This dip is a great way to work more veggies and dairy (from the yogurt) into your child’s
diet. Serve it as a side dish with lunch or dinner, or enjoy it as a snack all by itself.

295
Appendix A: Recipes
8 ounces low-fat plain yogurt
1 tablespoon powdered ranch or Italian
dressing mix, or to taste
1⁄2 cup baby carrots
1 red, green, or yellow bell pepper cored and
cut into strips
2 celery stalks, cut into 3-inch strips
1 cup cucumber slices
1 In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt and powdered dressing mix. Serve with veggies.
Per serving: Calories 64 (From Fat 10); Fat 1g (Saturated 1g); Cholesterol 3mg; Sodium 241mg; Carbohydrate 10g
(Dietary Fiber 1g); Protein 4g.
T Black Bean Dip
Beans are a great source of protein and fiber. You can use this quick dish either as a dip,
a side dish, or an excellent burrito filling. The yogurt isn’t necessary if you’re avoiding
dairy; it adds creaminess, but the beans themselves yield a fairly smooth purée. (This
recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: Six 11⁄2-cup servings
Two 15-ounce cans black beans, drained
1⁄2 cup plain low-fat yogurt
1 jalapeño, seeded and roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
1⁄2 cup roughly chopped red or yellow onion
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 Combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth. Season
with salt and pepper to taste.
Vary It! For extra spice, retain all or some of the jalapeño seeds and add them to
the food processor with the vegetables.
Tip: You can make this dip in a blender, but you may have to add a bit more yogurt
or lime juice to keep the ingredients liquid enough to blend.
Per serving: Calories 142 (From Fat 52); Fat 6g (Saturated 1g); Cholesterol 1mg; Sodium 283mg;
Carbohydrate 16g (Dietary Fiber 6g); Protein 7g.

Tools: 8 small paper cups (approximately 2 inches in size), 8 wooden ice-pop sticks
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
297
Appendix A: Recipes

42g (Dietary Fiber 2g); Protein 13g.
T Strawberry Sorbet
You can make this quick sorbet with a blender or food processor, but I recommend a
food processor because it doesn’t require as much liquid as the blender. You end up
with something very close to what you would get from an ice cream maker. (This recipe
comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes (plus 30 minutes thaw time)
Yield: 6 servings
299
Appendix A: Recipes
10-ounce bag frozen strawberries 
(about 2 cups)
2 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 Allow the frozen strawberries to thaw slightly, about 30 minutes. (Alternatively, you can
use your microwave to thaw the berries for 3 to 4 minutes on medium power.)
2 Place the strawberries in a food processor along with remaining ingredients. Pulse until
you achieve a smooth texture, scraping down the sides occasionally.
3 Scoop into serving dishes. If the sorbet’s too soft, place the dishes in the freezer for
about 10 minutes.
Tip: To make this sorbet even creamier, throw some frozen bananas into the food proces-
sor with the other ingredients.

T Creamy Hummus and 
Crunchy Pita Chips
Hummus and pita chips are a delicious, healthy alternative to the standard potato
chips-and-dip fare. They’re also quick and easy to prepare. (This recipe comes from
Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Hummus
300
Part V: Appendixes

1⁄2 cup water
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

more lemon juice, olive oil, salt, or pepper to adjust the flavor to your taste.
Pita Chips
3 whole wheat pitas
Olive oil
3 tablespoons of dried mixed herbs (oregano
and basil)
1 teaspoon salt

3 Brush the pitas liberally with olive oil, and sprinkle them with the herbs, salt, and
pepper.
4 Cut each circle into 6 or 8 pieces, as you would a pizza, and spread them on a baking
sheet.
5 Bake for about 8 minutes or until golden. Allow the chips to cool before serving them
with hummus.

rally sweetened frozen treat without adding an ounce of fat to the mix. (This recipe

Dinner
Studies have shown that families who eat dinner together several times a
week are less likely to have weight problems. Dinnertime is an excellent
opportunity for everyone to talk about healthy eating options. It’s also a
great time to get your child involved in the preparation of the meal and to
explain why and how you’ve cut the fat from the meal. We’ve included lots of
options in this section so that when everyone is ready, you can try out some
really interesting new tastes. Healthy eating is not boring, and these recipes
prove it!

T Summer Squash Stir-Fry
Stir-fry lets you serve your family all kinds of different veggies at one sitting. And
because stir-fry is relatively easy to prepare, it allows you to experiment with different
tastes and textures. Start with their favorites, and then play around with the recipe,
adding some interesting newcomers to the dish.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: Five 1⁄2-cup servings
302
Part V: Appendixes 
1 bag or box of brown, long-grain
rice (enough for 6 to 8 servings)

2 medium zucchini, sliced
2 medium yellow squash, sliced
1 medium onion, chopped
1 large ripe tomato, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon salt
1 Boil water for rice or prepare rice in the microwave according to package instructions.
2 Preheat a large skillet or wok for about 1 minute at medium heat, and then add the
broth and garlic. Stir it around for 1 minute.
3 Add the zucchini, yellow squash, and onion. Stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes.
4 Add the remaining ingredients, and reduce the heat to simmer. Stirring occasionally,
simmer 3 or 4 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked but not limp. Serve over
brown rice.

These grilled vegetables are a delicious alternative to raw or steamed, and they’re so
quick and easy to prepare that you’ll want to have them every night!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 to 4 servings

1 Slice the zucchini and yellow squash into spears. Cut the pepper in half, and remove the
core. Cut the pepper halves in quarters.

1⁄2 cup grated low-fat cheddar cheese
1⁄2 cup plain low-fat yogurt
4 soft tortilla shells
1 Combine the vinegar and soy sauce in a bowl. Cut the chicken breasts into cubes or strips,
and marinate them in the vinegar and soy mixture for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.
2 Prepare the rice according to package instructions.
3 Cut the peppers and onion into strips.
4 Spray a nonstick pan with vegetable spray. Add the peppers and onions to the pan, and
sauté over low-to-medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes until vegetables are soft. Add the
chicken to the peppers and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the chicken’s
cooked through (no pink remains).
5 Place one-fourth of the chicken and vegetable mixture in one tortilla shell, and add 1⁄8
cup each of cheese and yogurt. Serve with a 1⁄2 cup of rice on the side.

Taco Salad
Salad doesn’t have to be boring! Add some life to lettuce by serving it up Mexican-style.
This recipe substitutes baked tortilla chips for the traditional taco shells, which are
usually deep-fried and very high in fat and calories.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Fish Tacos with Mango-Jicama Salsa
We all know that fish is a great source of lean protein that cooks up quickly, but it can
be easy to get in a rut with how we prepare it. Fish tacos are a very simple (and differ-
ent) way to give nearly any piece of grilled, pan-seared, or broiled piece of fish a
Mexican flavor. The mango-jicama salsa adds crunch and a sweet and spicy flavor to
your taco, but guacamole or other salsas work equally well. (This recipe comes from
Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Fish Tacos
306
Part V: Appendixes 
Four 5- to 6-ounce fish fillets (red snapper,
salmon, flounder, or your favorite)
Salt
Pepper
Olive oil
Juice of 1 lime
8 small corn tortillas
1 Wash the fish, and dry it with paper towels. Rub it with a little bit of olive oil, and sprinkle
it with salt and pepper.
2 Preheat a nonstick pan over medium heat, and cook the fish until it flakes easily (for
most fish, that’s about 3 to 4 minutes per side).
3 Sprinkle cooked fish with lime juice. Divide each fillet in half, and place 2 pieces in each
warmed corn tortilla. Flake the fish a bit with a fork, garnish with mango-jicama salsa
along with hot sauce and/or additional cilantro to taste, and serve.

1 Peel the jicama by cutting it in half, laying one half flat on the cutting board, and cutting
1⁄8-inch strips of peel off all the way around.
2 Repeat Step 1 with the other half, and then chop the jicama into 1⁄4-inch pieces. Place the
chopped jicama in a medium bowl.
3 Cut the mango into 2 large slices alongside the pit, score the flesh into 1⁄4-inch squares
with a paring knife, and then cut the fruit away from the peel. Add the diced mango to
the jicama.
4 Finely chop the cilantro (you need about 3 tablespoons), and add it to the jicama along
with the rest of the ingredients. Mix well before serving.
Tip: The acidity of the lime juice preserves the mango-jicama salsa fairly well, so it will
keep at least 2 days covered in the refrigerator.
Tip: If you have leftovers, serve the fish for lunch the next day on a bed of mixed greens
with a citrus dressing and some of the mango-jicama salsa for extra crunch.

Appendix A: Recipes
1⁄2 small jicama

2 teaspoons chili powder
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Mango-Jicama Salsa

Grilled Cilantro-Lime Chicken Tacos
The grilled chicken used here as a taco filling is equally delicious on top of a healthy
salad. The fresh cilantro and lime juice make this dish taste authentic and extremely fla-
vorful. (This recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
308
Part V: Appendixes 
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 garlic clove, minced
1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped
11⁄4 teaspoons hot sauce (Mexican is
preferred, but others work just as well)
Juice of 2 limes
1 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 lime wedges
6 small corn tortillas
Mixed greens
Soy cheese
Salsa
Pickled jalapeño peppers
Guacamole
Fresh cilantro
1 Mix the olive oil, cilantro, garlic, jalapeño, hot sauce, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a
medium bowl. Set aside.
2 Place the chicken breasts between two layers of plastic wrap, and pound them with a
mallet or rolling pin until they’re about 1- to 3⁄4-inch thick. Add them to the marinade,
rub the marinade into the chicken a bit, and allow it to marinate for at least 20 minutes
in the refrigerator.
3 Preheat a grill pan or grill, and grill the chicken for about 5 to 7 minutes or until no
longer pink. Remove the chicken to a cutting board, and let it rest for another 2 to 3
minutes. Slice it into thin strips, and sprinkle with additional lime juice.
4 Divide the chicken among the corn tortillas, and dress the tacos with any combination
of the remaining ingredients. Serve immediately.

Turkey Burgers
These delicious burgers taste enough like meatloaf that you can eat them without buns.
Using low-fat turkey cuts some of the saturated fat normally found in burgers, and pack-
ing them full of tasty vegetables and fresh herbs increases their general goodness. (This
recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings (4 large patties or 8 small ones)
309
Appendix A: Recipes
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cups fresh chopped spinach
1⁄2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
11⁄2 pounds lean ground turkey
9 medium basil leaves, finely chopped
1⁄4 cup finely chopped parsley
1 egg, lightly beaten
Pinch each of salt and pepper
Olive oil for cooking
1 Heat a small sauté pan over medium heat, and toast the pine nuts, stirring frequently.
When they’re slightly golden, remove them from the pan, and allow them to cool. Finely
chop the nuts and set aside.
2 In a medium sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, and add the onion. Stir
frequently until the onion begins to soften, and then add the spinach and bell pepper.
Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the spinach has wilted and the peppers also begin to
soften. Remove the vegetables from the pan, and allow them to cool.
3 Place the turkey in a large mixing bowl, and with your hands or a utensil (being careful
not to overmix), gently incorporate the pine nuts, vegetables, fresh herbs, egg, salt, and
pepper. Form into patties and place on a sheet pan or tray.
4 Heat a large nonstick sauté pan or grill coated with a little bit of olive oil. Cook the pat-
ties for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until they’re done to your liking.

T Creamy Carrot Soup
Creamy soups don’t have to be unhealthy; adding oats, arborio rice, or other grains and
then blending well produces a thick, creamy texture that’s sure to please calorie counters.
This carrot soup is quick and delicious, and your family will never guess that the creami-
ness comes from standard breakfast oats. (This recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Six 1-cup appetizer servings; three 2-cup main course servings
310
Part V: Appendixes 
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch
rounds
5 cups vegetable or chicken stock
1⁄4 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
Pinch of grated ginger
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 In a medium pot, heat olive oil over medium heat, and then add the onions and salt.
Cook until the onions are softened and translucent (about 5 to 8 minutes), stirring often
to prevent browning.
2 Add the carrots, cover the pot, and cook over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occa-
sionally to prevent browning.
3 Pour the stock into the pot, and add the oats. Raise the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes, covered, until the carrots are very tender.
4 Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy, adding additional stock until
it’s your desired consistency. If you use a countertop blender, blend the soup in small
batches, taking care to vent the top of the blender to avoid an eruption of hot soup.
5 Add lemon juice and grated ginger, adjusting seasoning to taste. Garnish the soup with
dill, and serve.

T Spicy Napa Cabbage Salad
This quick salad is a great accompaniment to Asian meals. The dressing is nice on all
types of greens, but it works particularly well with the mild-cabbage flavor of the napa
cabbage. (This recipe comes from Megan Brenn-White.)
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
311
Appendix A: Recipes
1 medium napa cabbage
11⁄2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1⁄2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon mirin or rice wine
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 teaspoon lime juice
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed chili flakes
1 Clean the cabbage, and chop it into strips. Place the chopped cabbage in a large bowl.
2 Toast the sesame seeds in a small pan over medium heat until they’re golden, stirring
frequently. Set aside to cool.
3 Mix the remaining ingredients well in a small bowl.
4 Add the dressing to the cabbage, toss, and top with the toasted sesame seeds.

Salmon Patties
Salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and is considered to be one of the most
beneficial sources of animal protein. These patties are a beautiful addition to a brunch,
but they also work as appetizers or a light lunch or dinner. (This recipe comes from
Conscious Cuisine by Cary Neff (Sourcebooks).)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
312
Part V: Appendixes 
1 small potato
1⁄2 pound fresh salmon filets without skin or
bone
1 large egg white
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
3⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1⁄4 cup chopped scallion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chervil, parsley,
dill, or cilantro
1⁄2 cup chopped seedless grapes
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Peel the potato and finely chop it. Blanch the chopped potato by boiling it in water until
tender and then removing from the heat. When the potato is cool, drain the water off,
and dry the chopped pieces on a kitchen towel.
3 Place the salmon in a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped (3 pulses or so).
Add the egg white, salt, and pepper. Process until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a
bowl, and fold in the scallion, herbs, grapes, and potato.
4 Heat a griddle or sauté pan over medium heat, and coat it with cooking spray or olive
oil. Using a 1⁄4-cup measure, form 6 patties and place them in the pan. Brown the patties
on both sides (approximately 3 minutes per side).
5 Place the patties on an ungreased baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 5
minutes.
Tip: Be sure to make fairly thin patties if you plan to skip Step 5 (baking in the oven). Heat
the sauté pan or griddle with a bit of oil to a fairly high heat and brown on both sides. Turn
the heat down to medium and continue to cook the patties, flipping them once, until they’re
cooked all the way through. You may want to cover the pan to speed the cooking time.

Orange Beef and Vegetables
Here’s a recipe that combines your standard stir-fry with an unexpected treat: fruit
juice! Kids love this meal because of the tangy and crunchy combination. Add low-fat
meat for protein, and you have a complete and nutritious meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
313
Appendix A: Recipes
2 medium seedless oranges
1 package brown rice
1 tablespoon canola oil
12-ounce beef top round steak, thinly sliced
across the grain
10-ounce bag frozen stir-fry vegetables
1 Grate the peel off one orange, and set aside. Juice both oranges, and set the juice aside.
2 Prepare the rice according to package instructions.
3 Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet. Add the sliced beef, and stir-fry until no longer pink.
Remove to a bowl.
4 Put the frozen vegetables in the skillet with the orange peel and juice. Cook for 4 
minutes.
5 Add the beef back in, and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until the beef is heated through.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Vary It! If your family isn’t particularly fond of rice, you can serve this dish over whole
wheat noodles. Prepare 6 to 8 servings according to package instructions.
Per serving: Calories 230 (From Fat 88); Fat 10g (Saturated 3g); Cholesterol 48mg; Sodium 44mg; Carbohydrate
15g (Dietary Fiber 5g); Protein 20g.

1 Heat broiler, and brush a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of oil.
2 In a small skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil, and then add the scallions
and sauté 1 minute (until softened). Add the garlic and sauté 30 seconds. Transfer to a
large bowl.
3 Add approximately three-quarters of the beans to the bowl, and mash them with a fork
or potato masher. Add in the remaining beans, and season the mixture generously with
salt and pepper.
4 Fold the yam, egg, and breadcrumbs into the beans. Divide the mixture into small balls
of equal size, and flatten them into patties. Place the patties 1⁄2 inch apart on the baking
sheet. Broil 4 inches from the heat 8 to 10 minutes.
5 With a thin metal spatula, carefully turn the burgers over. Put them back under the
broiler for 2 to 3 minutes more, until they’re crisp. Top the burgers with salsa, and
serve them with guacamole.

Appendix B
Weight Chart and Exercise Log
You can use the weight chart provided on the following page of this
appendix to keep track of your child’s progress as he or she loses
weight. Filling in the chart and recording progress is an excellent motivator.
Just photocopy the weight chart page that follows so that you’re not limited
to the one page in this book. Here are a few sample entries:

With the exercise log, which comes right after the weight chart, your child
can record the amount of physical activity he or she is participating in. As
with the weight chart, you should photocopy the exercise log page because,
with any luck, your child will be logging pages and pages of activities. Here
