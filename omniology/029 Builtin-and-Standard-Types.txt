Not all types are in the builtin module…
Certain types that we use commonly in Python
int
str
list
tuple
are part of the builtins
l = [1, 2, 3]
type(l) is list
à True
isinstance(l, list)
But some types are not available directly in the builtins
functions
modules
generators
list is a type
def my_func():
pass
print(type(my_func))

à 'function'
this is a string
but type(my_func)
actually returns a type (think class)

import types
def my_func():
pass
type(my_func) is types.FunctionType
isinstance(my_func, types.FunctionType)
à True
Nothing fancy, just that some standard types are not 
available directly in the builtins
types.ModuleType
types.FunctionType
types.GeneratorType
