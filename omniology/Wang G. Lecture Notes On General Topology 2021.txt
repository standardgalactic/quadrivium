Preface
This book is intended as a one-semester course in general topology for un-
dergraduate students as well as ﬁrst-year graduate students.
One of the ways in which general topology has been inﬂuencing science
is by introducing a language consisting of terminologies and using it every-
where. The study of general topology therefore resembles a language study
that one has to learn many words as studying abstract algebra.
Here are some highlights of this book. This is a book with a concentra-
tion on basic concepts in general topology. Though it is hard to determine
precisely which concepts therein are basic and which are not, I make eﬀorts
in selecting basic ones according to personal experience on the occurrence
frequency of notions in advanced mathematics. The selections are listed as
chapter titles: topological spaces, continuous maps and homeomorphisms,
connectedness, separation and countability axioms, compactness, and prod-
uct and quotient spaces. Interrelationships among concepts are also taken
into account carefully. Twelve particular topological spaces are labeled and
one may use them to learn concepts as examples. This book contains exer-
cises for each chapter, some solutions, and well-organized indices.
Much material of this book comes from Viro, Ivanov, Netsvetaev and
Kharlamov’s problem textbook [42, Part 1].
There are books on gen-
eral topology with an emphasis on intuitions like Prasolov [32], on geo-
metric insights like Armstrong [4] and Weeks [43], and on aspects that
are most useful in analysis like Pervin [31]. In comparison, this book fo-
cuses on general topology itself. Besides Kelley’s classical book [22] and
Munkres’ [29,30], textbooks on general topology with more extensive con-
tent include Dugundji [13], Hocking and Young [18], Willard [44], and
You [45].

Introduction
A topologist is one who doesn’t
know the diﬀerence between a
doughnut and a coﬀee cup.
John Leroy Kelley
Topology, without the word “general”, has a wide audience and is a research
area at the frontier of science. This can be seen from the Nobel Prize in
Physics 2016, which was awarded for “theoretical discoveries of topological
phase transitions and topological phases of matter.”1 “Topology was the key
to the Nobel Laureates’ discoveries, and it explains why electrical conduc-
tivity inside thin layers changes in integer steps.”2
General topology, whose language and idea appear ubiquitously in math-
ematics, is the basis to all kinds of advanced topology studies, such as al-
gebraic, diﬀerential, geometric, and combinatorial topology. One may ﬁnd
natural interplay between general topology and other branches of mathemat-
ics, computer science and biology, such as Banach spaces, digital topology,
measure theory, homology, homotopy, shape theory, manifolds, economics
and game theory, and phenotype spaces; see [1, 10, 17]. A recent applica-
tion [34, 35, 40] of topological ideas is nonlinear dimensionality reduction,
which appears in scientiﬁc works with large volumes of high-dimensional
data, such as global climate patterns, image processing, gene distribution,
word-document counts, etc.

Chapter 1
Introduction
We would like to give three inspiring examples of smart use of general
topology in solving interesting mathematical problems.
The inﬁnitude of primes, which has a classical proof due to Euclid, was
reproved by Furstenberg [15] using general topology (when he was an un-
dergraduate student). After devising the evenly spaced integer topology, he
exhibited, by contradiction, a ﬁnite open set in the topological space which
should not exist from deﬁnition. See Page 12 for details.
The Borsuk-Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from
an n-sphere into the n-dimensional Euclidean space maps some pair of an-
tipodal points to the same point. Matouˇsek [26] collected many of its appli-
cations in combinatorics and geometry. By using the Borsuk-Ulam theorem,
Alon and West [3] gave a very short proof for the necklace splitting problem
that every necklace with k colors of beads has a bisection of size at most k.
See also [2].
The square peg problem, a conjecture posed by Toeplitz more than a
hundred years ago, states that every continuous simple closed curve in the
plane contains four points that are the vertices of a square; see Fig. 1.1 for an
illustration. Many particular cases of this conjecture have been conﬁrmed;
see Matschke [27] for a survey and Tao [39] for a recent study. A weaker
version of the square peg problem that asks for the existence of a rectan-
gle inscribed in a continuous simple closed curve was solved aﬃrmatively
by using general topology by Vaughan with the aid of M¨obius strips; see
Meyerson [28] and Fig. 1.2.
Fig. 1.1. A square inscribed in a continuous simple closed curve.
There are handbooks such as [6–8] on the history of general topology,
however, there is no uniform viewpoint for the starting time of general topol-
ogy, nor for that of topology. Progress on general topology up to 2014 can
be found in the paper collections [16,20,21].

Introduction

We tell some stories along the history of topology. The Seven Bridges
of K¨onigsberg, which is a historically notable problem in mathematics, is
considered to be the beginning of a topological idea by some mathematicians;
see [1, Section 0.2]. Abstracted by Euler to the graph in Fig. 1.3, the problem
asks for the existence of a walk along each of the seven edges exactly once.
The idea is to regard bridges in reality as edges in a graph whose lengths and
shapes can be reasonably ignored. In 1736 Euler gave the negative answer
to this problem; see Exercise 1.4
Fig. 1.3. A graph schematic of the Seven Bridges of K¨onigsberg.
Another great work is Euler’s polyhedral formula: the Euler character-
istic
χ = v −e + f
of any convex polyhedron is 2, where v, e and f are the number of vertices,
edges and faces of a polyhedron, respectively. For instance, a cube has 8
vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, and it is veriﬁed that the Euler characteristic
of a cube is
8 −12 + 6 = 2.
After introducing the concept of homeomorphisms (Deﬁnition 3.16), one
accepted intuitively that an object keeps invariant under operations such as

4
Chapter 1
Introduction
thickening, stretching, bending and twisting, but does not keep invariant
under operations such as identifying and tearing.
Around 1860, M¨obius
gave the idea of explaining topological equivalence by thinking of spaces as
being made of rubber. One realized that topologically equivalent polyhedra
have the same Euler characteristic. In other words, the Euler characteristic
is a topological invariant (Deﬁnition 3.31). This explains Kelley’s joke3 since
both doughnuts and coﬀee mugs have Euler characteristic 0.
Technically, how to determine that two topological spaces are homeo-
morphic or not? Generally speaking, to show that two topological spaces
are homeomorphic, one needs to construct a homeomorphism between them.
In contrast, to conﬁrm that two topological spaces are not homeomorphic,
it suﬃces to look for a topological invariant or property that distinguishes
the spaces. For example, the line is not homeomorphic to the plane since
removing a point from the line produces a disconnected space while remov-
ing a point from the plane gives rise to a connected space. A particular
way to judge non-homeomorphic spaces is adopting Poincar´e’s idea, which
assigns a group, called the fundamental group, to each topological space so
that homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic groups.
The axioms for a topological space appeared for the ﬁrst time in 1914
in a work of Hausdorﬀ. In 1922 Veblen published the ﬁrst textbook [41] on
topology, in which one may ﬁnd the ﬁrst deﬁnition of a topological manifold,
systematizations of the fundamental groups and the topological classiﬁcation
problem; see Hodge [19] and Batterson [9].
The classiﬁcation theorem of closed surfaces is an important result in
topology. It states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to
either a connected sum of a nonnegative integer number g of tori whose
Euler characteristic is
2 −2g,
or a connected sum of a positive number k of real projective planes whose
Euler characteristic is
2 −k.
In other words, any closed surface is homeomorphic to either the sphere
with a ﬁnite number of handles added, or the sphere with a ﬁnite number of
M¨obius strips added. This classiﬁcation leads to the concepts of orientable
and non-orientable surfaces respectively. In fact, the surfaces in the classi-
ﬁcation theorem are non-homeomorphic to each other since no two surfaces
have isomorphic fundamental groups.
3John Leroy Kelley (1916–1999), American. See the epigraph of Chapter 1 for his joke, which
can be found from [33].

Chapter 1
Introduction

A close and deep interrelation of topology and geometry is exhibited in
Singer and Thorpe’s book [36], which has been used at Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology (MIT) for a one-year course. Though some mathemati-
cians consider topology as a branch of geometry, some diﬀerences between
topology and geometry can be caught from a talk [25] of MacPherson’s at
the Institute for Advanced Study in 2015. He presented that one says
the point M is the midpoint of the straight line segment L
connecting A to B,
in geometry, while a statement in topology in contrast would be
the point M lies between A and B on the curve L con-
necting A to B.
In conclusion, studying topology is a long and interesting journey. We
are now starting the trip for the ﬁrst step on general topology.

1.4) A graph is said to be Eulerian if it has a walk that uses each edge
exactly once. A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if either it has
exactly two vertices of odd degrees or it has no vertex of an odd degree.
The graph shown in Fig. 1.3 is connected and it has four vertices of
odd degrees. Therefore, it is impossible to transverse each of the seven
bridges of K¨onigsberg once and exactly once.
1.5) Five. Let P be a Platonic solid with v vertices, e edges and f faces.
Suppose that each vertex is of degree d and that each face is a regular
r-polygon. Then
(1.1)
d, e, r ≥3.
By double counting the pairs (x, y), where y is an edge of P and x is an
end of y, we obtain that
2e = rf = dv.
Dividing both sides of the Euler’s formula
v + f = e + 2
by the number 2e, we ﬁnd
(1.2)

2 + 1
e = 1
d + 1
r.
If d, r ≥4, then the right hand side of Eq. (1.2) is at most 1/2, contra-
dicting e > 0. In view of Ineq. (1.1), we obtain
d = 3
or
r = 3.
If d = 3, then Eq. (1.2) reduces to
1
6 = 1
r −1
e,
which implies that r ≤5. For r = 3, 4, 5 we solve out the regular tetrahe-
dron, the regular cube, and the regular dodecahedron, respectively. The
other cases r = 3 and d ∈{3, 4, 5} give rise to the regular tetrahedron,
the regular octahedron, and the regular icosahedron, respectively.
1.6) Two, of course. The regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20
faces of regular triangles. The regular dodecahedron has 20 vertices, 30
edges and 12 faces of regular pentagons. The Euler’s characteristic does
not depend on the regularity.

Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
Think geometrically, prove
algebraically.
John Tate
In this chapter, we introduce basic notions in general topology in modern
mathematical language.
2.1. Topological structures
It took a long time in forming the following deﬁnition of a topological space.
According to Munkres [30, page 75], “mathematicians . . . wanted, of course,
a deﬁnition that was as broad as possible, so that it would include as special
cases all the various examples that were useful in mathematics . . . but they
also wanted the deﬁnition to be narrow enough that the standard theorems
about these familiar spaces would hold for topological spaces in general.”
Deﬁnition 2.1. A topology on a set X is a collection Ω∈2X satisfying
the axioms
(1) ∅∈Ωand X ∈Ω;
(2) the union of any members of Ωlies in Ω; and
(3) the intersection of any two members of Ωlies in Ω.
A topological space is a pair (X, Ω), where Ωis a topology on X. An
open set in (X, Ω) is a member in Ω. A closed set in (X, Ω) is a subset
A ⊆X such that X\A ∈Ω. A clopen set in (X, Ω) is a subset A ⊆X that
is both closed and open. A neighborhood of a point p ∈X is a subset
U ⊆X such that p ∈O ⊆U for some open set O∈Ω.

10
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
Throughout this book, we use the letter Ωto denote an open set,4 and
the letter U a neighborhood since it is the ﬁrst letter of the German word
“umgebung”, which means neighborhood. The deﬁnition of a neighborhood
follows the Nicolas Bourbaki group5 [11,12].
Example 2.2. Are the following pairs (X, Ω) topological spaces?
(1) X = R is the set of real numbers, and
Ω= {inﬁnite subsets of R} ∪{∅}.
Answer. No.
□
(2) X = R2 is the set of points on the plane, and
Ω= {open disks centered at the origin} ∪{∅, X}.
Answer. Yes.
□
Note that being closed is not the negation of being open! A set might
be (i) open but not closed, or (ii) closed but not open, or (iii) clopen, or
(iv) neither closed nor open.
Since X is the union of all sets in Ω, the topology Ωcarries enough
information to characterize a topological space (X, Ω). However, a space
(X, Ω) is often denoted simply by X, because (i) it is quite seldom to consider
diﬀerent topologies for the same set X simultaneously, and (ii) to exclaim a
set is usually easier than to clarify a topology. As will be seen in Section 2.2,
subspace topology further helps the clariﬁcation by calling the knowledge of
common topologies.
Below are some basic examples of topological spaces, which should be
kept in mind as our story unfolds. A singleton (resp., doubleton) is a set
of cardinality one (resp., two).
Space 1. A discrete space is a space X with the topology 2X of all subsets
of X, called the discrete topology. A space is discrete if and only if every
singleton is open.
Space 2. An indiscrete space is a space X with the topology {∅, X},
called the indiscrete topology. Such a space and its topology are also
called a trivial space and the trivial topology, respectively.
4A topology is a collection of open sets.
One says open in English, otvoren in Croatian,
otevˇreno in Czech, open in Dutch, ouvert in French, oﬀen in German, otkrytyj in Russian, and
¨oppna in Swedish.
5Nicolas Bourbaki is the collective pseudonym under which a group of (mainly French) 20th-
century mathematicians, with the aim of reformulating mathematics on a formal and self-contained
basis, wrote a series of books from 1935. There is another custom that a neighborhood of a point
is deﬁned to be an open set containing that point.

2.1. Topological structures
11
Intuitively, in a certain sense, a discrete space is a space whose points are
isolated from each other, while an indiscrete space is a space whose points
cannot be distinguished.
Space 3. The Sierpi´nski space is a pair (X, Ω), where X is a doubleton
and Ω= 2X \ S for some singleton S. In other words, the Sierpi´nski space
is a pair (X, Ω) such that
X = {a, b}
and
Ω= { ∅, {a}, X}
for some elements a and b.
Space 4. The real line is the set R of real numbers with the topology
ΩR = {unions of open intervals},
called the standard topology on R.
Space 5. The coﬁnite space is the pair (R, Ω), where
Ω= {complements of ﬁnite subsets of R} ∪{∅},
called the coﬁnite topology.
Space 6. The arrow is the topological space (R≥0, Ω), where R≥0 is the
set of nonnegative numbers, and
Ω= {(a, ∞): a ≥0} ∪{∅, R≥0},
called the arrow topology.
Space 7. A particular point space is a topological space (X, Ωp), where
p is a given point in X and
Ωp = {S ⊆X : p ∈S} ∪{∅},
called a particular point topology.
Space 8. An excluded point space is a topological space (X, Ω′
p), where p
is a given point in X and
Ω′
p = {S ⊆X : p /∈S} ∪{X},
called an excluded point topology.
The condition “the intersection of any two members of Ωlies in Ω” in
Deﬁnition 2.1 is equivalent to that “the intersection of any ﬁnite family of
members of Ωlies in Ω”. When the ﬁniteness restriction is dropped, that is,
when the above condition is replaced by that “the intersection of any family
of members of Ωlies in Ω”, the resulting topology is called an Alexandrov
topology.
From Deﬁnition 2.1, we see that to clarify a topological structure on a
set X is equivalent to designate a collection of subsets in 2X and to name

12
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
them by open sets. It is also possible to deﬁne a topology by designating
closed sets; see Exercise 2.2. This leads us to the idea of “generating sets”;
see Deﬁnition 2.3 and Exercise 2.8.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A base of a topological space (X, Ω) is a collection
β ⊆Ω
such that any open set of X is the union of some members of β. When β is
a base for Ω, the topology Ωis said to be generated by β, and denoted
Ω= ⟨β⟩.
Bases are useful partially because many statements about a topology can
be reduced to those about a base generating that topology, and partially
because many topologies are easily deﬁned in terms of a base. Here is a
quick example. Denote by Z the set of integers, and Z+ the set of positive
integers. Let
K =
n 1
n : n ∈Z+o
be the set of unit fractions (see Munkres [30, page 82]).
Space 9. The K-topology is the pair (R, ΩK), where
ΩK = ⟨ΩR ∪{(a, b) \ K : a < b} ⟩.
Recall that Furstenberg showed the inﬁnitude of primes by using a topol-
ogy on the set of integers. The topology can be described in terms of bases
as follows.
Space 10. The evenly spaced integer topology is the pair (Z, Ω),
where Ωis generated by the set of arithmetic integer progressions.
Furstenberg’s proof of the inﬁnitude of primes. In the evenly spaced
integer topology, each set
P(a, d) = {a + nd: n ∈Z}
is clopen. Note that
Z \ {−1, 1} =
[
p is prime
P(0, d).
If the number of primes is ﬁnite, then the set {−1, 1} is clopen. However,
every open set is inﬁnite from deﬁnition, a contradiction.
□
Consider a set X and a collection β ∈2X. Theorem 2.4 is a characteriza-
tion for β such that there exists a topology on X with a base β; Theorem 2.5
is a characterization for β to be a base for a prescribed topology on X.

2.2. Subspace topology
13
Theorem 2.4. Let X be a set. Then a collection β ∈2X is a base for a
topology on X if and only if
(1) X is the union of all members of β, and
(2) the intersection of any two members of β is the union of some sets
in β.
Proof. Suppose that β is a base for a topology on X. Since any member
of β is open for the topology generated by β, the intersection of any two
members is open and hence can be generated by the base β. Conversely,
deﬁne Ω⊆2X to be the collection of unions of members of β. By using
distributive law for the unions and intersections, one may verify that Ωis a
topology on X.
□
Theorem 2.5. Let (X, Ω) be a topological space with β ⊆Ω. Then β is
a base for Ωif and only if for any pair (x, O) such that x ∈O ∈Ω, there
exists B ∈β such that x ∈B ⊆O.
Proof. Let O ∈Ω. If β is a base, then there exists Γ ⊆β such that
O =
[
B∈Γ
B.
Conversely, for any x ∈O, let Bx ∈β such that x ∈Bx ⊆O. Then
O =
[
x∈O
Bx.
This completes the proof.
□
2.2. Subspace topology
Deﬁnition 2.6. Let (X, Ω) be a topological space with a subset A ⊆X.
The subspace topology of (X, Ω) induced by A is the collection
ΩA = {O ∩A: O ∈Ω}.
The topological subspace induced by A is the pair (A, ΩA).
Subsets of topological spaces are equipped with the subspace topology
by default, so that one often says “the subspace A” or even “the topolog-
ical space A” without mentioning the space (X, Ω) of which one naturally
considers A as a subset.
Propositions 2.7 to 2.9 are basic properties on subspace topologies.
Proposition 2.7. Let X be a topological space. The subspace topology in-
duced by A ⊆X can be deﬁned alternatively in terms of closed sets as that
a set S is closed in A if and only if S = F ∩A for some closed set F ⊆X.

□
Let X be a topological space and A ⊆M ⊆X. We consider the relations
of the topologies of A, M, and X.
Proposition 2.8. Let X be a topological space with
A ⊆M ⊆X.
Then we have the following.
(1) If A is open (resp., closed) in X, then A is open (resp., closed)
in M.
(2) If A is open (resp., closed) in M, and if M is open (resp., closed)
in X, then A is open (resp., closed) in X.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 2.6 and Proposition 2.7.
□
The conditions that M is open (resp., closed) in X in Proposition 2.8
are necessary. For instance, the set
{x ∈Q: x >
√
2}
is clopen in the space Q of rational numbers, but is neither closed nor open
in the real line.
Proposition 2.9. Let (X, Ω) be a topological space with
A ⊆M ⊆X.
Denote by ΩM the subspace topology of (X, Ω) induced by M.
Then the
subspace topology of (X, Ω) induced by A coincides with the subspace topology
of (M, ΩM) induced by A.
Hint. It will be clear if one notices that
{O ∩A: O ∈ΩM} = {(O′ ∩M) ∩A: O′ ∈Ω}
= {O′ ∩A: O′ ∈Ω}.
□
Talking about a topological subspace A whose topology is induced by
some space X whose topology is clear from context, we often call X the
ambient space. To designate the subspace topology of a subset A of X,
which is also a subset of M ⊆X, it is unnecessary to clarify that which of
the two spaces (X, Ω) and (M, ΩM) is considered as the ambient topological
space, for Proposition 2.9 tells us the induced subspace topologies induced
by these two ambient topologies coincide with each other.
The unit interval in the real line is the interval [0, 1], denoted by I.

2.3. Covers
15
Example 2.10. The Cantor set6 is the set of numbers created by itera-
tively deleting the open middle third from a set of line segments, with the
unit interval being the initial line segment; see Fig. 2.1. The Cantor set,
equipped with the subspace topology of R, is closed.
Fig. 2.1. Illustration of the procedure of forming the Cantor set.
The Cantor set is a popular research object. For instance, every element
in the interval [0, 1] is the product of three elements in the Cantor set;
see [5].
Some of its topological properties are collected in Exercise 2.9.
Another interesting subset of the real line is the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set;
see Exercise 2.15.
2.3. Covers
In this section, we introduce the notion of covers of a set, which will be used
also in the sequel, see Theorem 3.8 and Deﬁnitions 5.28 and 6.1.
Let X be a set. A cover of X is a collection Γ of sets such that
X ⊆
[
A∈Γ
A.
We say that Γ covers X if Γ is a cover of X. A subcover of Γ is a subfamily
of Γ which covers X. A reﬁnement of Γ is a cover of X whose every member
is contained in a member of Γ. A partition of the set X is a cover Γ of X
such that X is the disjoint union of members A in Γ, i.e.,
X =
G
A∈Γ
A.
Deﬁnition 2.11. Suppose that
X =
[
A∈Γ
A
is a topological space. The cover Γ is open (resp., closed) if every member
of Γ is open (resp., closed). The cover Γ is locally ﬁnite if every point in X
6The Cantor set was discovered by the Irish mathematician Henry John Stephen Smith in
1874, and introduced by the German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.

16
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
has a neighborhood that meets only a ﬁnite number of members of Γ. The
cover Γ is fundamental if the following equivalence holds:
a set O is open in X ⇐⇒O ∩A is open in A for any A ∈Γ.
Theorem 2.12 (Characterizations of fundamental covers). Let X be a topo-
logical space with a cover Γ. Then
Γ is fundamental
⇐⇒a set O ⊆X is open, provided O ∩A is open in A for all A ∈Γ
⇐⇒a set F ⊆X is closed, provided F ∩A is closed in A for any A ∈Γ.
Proof. For the ﬁrst equivalence, it suﬃces to check from right to left. In
fact, when O is open in X, by deﬁnition of the subspace topology, the
intersection O ∩A is certainly an open set of A.
Let us show the second equivalence. ⇒: for any A ∈Γ, the set
(X \ F) ∩A = A \ (F ∩A)
is open. Thus X \ F is open, i.e., F is closed. The converse statement can
be shown similarly.
□
Theorem 2.13 collects some criteria for the fundamentality of a cover,
which will be used in the proof of Theorem 4.28.
Theorem 2.13 (Criteria for the fundamentality). A cover Γ is fundamental
(1) if it has a fundamental reﬁnement;
(2) if it is open;
(3) if it is locally ﬁnite and closed;
(4) if there exists a fundamental cover Σ such that the cover
ΣS = {A ∩S : A ∈Γ}
of S is fundamental for any S ∈Σ;
(5) if every point has a neighborhood U such that the cover
ΓU = {A ∩U : A ∈Γ}
of U is fundamental.
Proof. We will show them individually.
(1) Let O ⊆X. Suppose that O ∩A is open in A for any A ∈Γ. Let Γ′ be
a fundamental reﬁnement of Γ. Let B ∈Γ′. Then there exists AB ∈Γ such
that B ⊆AB. By Proposition 2.9, we can regard the topology of AB ∩B as
the one induced from AB. It follows that
O ∩B = O ∩AB ∩B

2.3. Covers
17
is open in AB ∩B = B. By the arbitrariness of B, and since Γ′ is funda-
mental, we infer that O is open in X. This proves that Γ is fundamental.
(2) Let O ⊆X such that O ∩A is open in A for any A ∈Γ. By Proposi-
tion 2.8, O ∩A is open in X, and so is the set
[
A∈Γ
(O ∩A) = O.
By Theorem 2.12, Γ is fundamental.
(3) Each point p ∈X has an open neighborhood Op meeting only a ﬁnite
number of members of Γ. Then the cover
Σ = {A ∩Op : A ∈Γ}
of Op is ﬁnite and closed, and thus fundamental. Let O ⊆X be a set such
that O ∩A is open in A for any A ∈Γ. We shall show that O is open in X.
In fact, let p ∈X and A ∈Γ. Consider the topology of A ∩Op as the
one induced from the topology of A, we infer that
(O ∩Op) ∩(A ∩Op) = (O ∩A) ∩Op
is open in A ∩Op.
By the arbitrariness of A, and since the cover Σ is
fundamental, we infer that the set O ∩Op is open in Op, and thus open in X
by Proposition 2.8. Hence
O = O ∩X = O ∩
[
p∈X
Op =
[
p∈X
(O ∩Op)
is open in X.
(4) Let O ⊆X such that O ∩A is open in A for any A ∈Γ. Let S ∈Σ.
Then O ∩A ∩S is open in A ∩S. Since the cover ΣS is fundamental, we
infer that O ∩S is open in S. Since the cover Σ is fundamental, we derive
that O is open in X. This proves that Γ is fundamental.
(5) For any p ∈X, let Up be a neighborhood of p such that the cover ΓUp
is fundamental. We claim that the cover
Σ = {Up : p ∈X}
of X is fundamental. In fact, suppose that O ⊆X such that O ∩Up is open
in Up for any p ∈X. Since Up is a neighborhood of p, there exists an open
set Op such that
p ∈Op ⊆Up.
Therefore, the set
O ∩Op = O ∩Up ∩Op
is open in
Op = Up ∩Op,

18
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
and thus open in X. Hence the set
O =
[
p∈X
(O ∩Op)
is open in X. This proves the claim. Now, by using (4), we obtain that Γ is
fundamental.
□
From Theorem 2.13 (5), we see that the cover fundamentality is a “local
property”.
2.4. Point position with respect to a set
We introduce some terminologies on point positions with respect to a set.
Deﬁnition 2.14. Let X be a topological space with a subset A ⊆X. A
limit point of A is a point p ∈X such that
 A \ {p}

∩U ̸= ∅
for any neighborhood U of p. An isolated point of A is a point p ∈A such
that
 A \ {p}

∩U = ∅
for some neighborhood U of p. The set A is perfect if it is closed and has
no isolated points. The closure of A is the union of A and its limit points,
denoted A, i.e.,
A = {p ∈X : N ∩A ̸= ∅for any neighborhood N of p}.
An adherent point of A is a point in the closure A. An interior point
of A is a point having a neighborhood in A. The interior of A, denoted A◦,
is the set of interior points. An exterior point of A is a point that has a
neighborhood in the complement
Ac = X \ A.
The exterior of A is the set (Ac)◦of exterior points. A boundary point of
A is a point such that each of its neighborhood meets both A and Ac. The
boundary of A is the set A \ A◦of boundary points, denoted ∂A. When
one expresses the closure of A with an emphasis on the operation of taking
closure, he may use the symbol Cl(A) (or ClX A when there is a possibility of
confusion). The symbols Int(A), Ext(A), and Bd(A) are used in the similar
manner.
For instance, any subset A ⊆X satisﬁes A◦⊆A and Ext A ⊆Ac. It is
true that Ext ∅= X. In R, we have
Int Q = Ext Q = ∅.

2.4. Point position with respect to a set
19
More basic properties relating to the notions in Deﬁnition 2.14 are collected
in Proposition 2.16. Theorem 2.15 are characterizations of the closure and
the interior of a set.
Theorem 2.15. The closure of a set is the smallest closed set that contains
that set. The interior of a set is the largest open set that is contained in that
set.
Proof. The closure of a set is the intersection of all closed sets containing
it, and the interior of a set is the union of all open sets contained in it.
□
In operator theory, one denotes the set operators of closure, interior, and
complement respectively by k, i, and c. A function f : X →X is said to be
• an involution if the composition f ◦f is the identity;
• an idempotent if f ◦f = f.
For instance, the complement operator c is an involution.
Proposition 2.16. For any topological space X with a subset A, we have
the following.
(1) The interior and exterior of a set are open, and the boundary of a
set is closed.
(2) The set A is the disjoint union of the sets of limits and isolated
points of A.
(3) A = A◦⊔(∂A).
(4) ∂A = A ∩Ac.
(5) ∂(A◦) ⊆∂A.
(6) X = (Cl A) ⊔(Ext A).
(7) A◦⊆X◦and A ⊆X.
(8) A ∩B ⊆A ∩B and (A ∪B)◦⊇A◦∪B◦.
(9) A ∪B = A ∪B and (A ∩B)◦= A◦∩B◦.
(10) If A ⊆M ⊆X, then
ClM(A) = M ∩ClX(A).
(11) ci = kc.
(12) The operators k, i, and ki = kckc are idempotent.

20

Proof. All can be veriﬁed by Deﬁnition 2.14. Here is a proof for (10):

A⊆C
C is closed in X

□
For some other relations among the operators, see Exercise 2.14.
A
natural question is how many distinct sets can be obtained from a given
subset of a topological space by repeatedly applying the set operators k and
c. Kuratowski [23] published the answer 14 in 1922. Here is an example in
the real line:
(0, 1) ∪(1, 2) ∪{3} ∪
 [4, 5] ∩Q

.
Deﬁnition 2.17. Let X be a topological space with subsets A and B. We
say that
• A is dense in B, if B ⊆A;
• A is everywhere dense, if A = X, i.e., if Ext A = ∅; and
• A is nowhere dense, if Ext A is everywhere dense.
Example 2.18. The whole set is everywhere dense, and the empty set is
not everywhere dense. The set Q is everywhere dense in R. The Cantor set
is nowhere dense in the unit interval.
A good exercise for understanding Deﬁnition 2.17 is to describe the
everywhere dense sets and nowhere dense sets in each of the running spaces
introduced in Section 2.1; see also Exercise 2.17.
Theorem 2.19 is a characterization for an everywhere dense set.
Theorem 2.19. Let X be a topological space with a subset A. The following
are equivalent.
(1) The set A is everywhere dense.
(2) The set A meets every nonempty open set in X.
(3) The set A meets every neighborhood in X.
Proof. It is clear that (2) is equivalent to (3). We shall show that (1) is
equivalent to (2).

2.4. Point position with respect to a set
21
⇒. Let O ∈Ωsuch that
A ∩O = ∅.
Then A is a subset of the closed set Oc. It follows that
X = A ⊆Oc.
Hence O = ∅.
⇐. Let F ⊂X be a proper closed set containing A. From premise, we have
A ∩F c ̸= ∅,
that is, A ̸⊆F. Therefore, the smallest closed set containing A is X. By
Theorem 2.15, we have A = X. Hence A is everywhere dense.
□
Corollary 2.20. If A is everywhere dense and O is open, then
O ⊆A ∩O.
Proof. If not, then there exists p ∈O with a neighborhood U such that
U ∩(A ∩O) = ∅.
Without loss of generality, we can suppose that U is open. Then the every-
where dense set A does not meet the open set U ∩O. By Theorem 2.19, we
infer that
U ∩O = ∅,
contradicting the fact that p ∈U ∩O.
□
Theorem 2.21 is a characterization for nowhere dense sets.
Theorem 2.21. A set A is nowhere dense in a topological space X if and
only if each open set in X contains an open set that is contained in Ac.
Proof. By Theorem 2.19, we deduce that
A is nowhere dense
⇐⇒Ext A is everywhere dense
⇐⇒Ext A meets every neighborhood
⇐⇒each neighborhood contains an exterior point of A
⇐⇒each neighborhood contains a neighborhood that is contained in Ac
⇐⇒each open set contains an open set that is contained in Ac.
This completes the proof.
□
Theorem 2.22. The real line is not the union of a countable number of
nowhere dense sets.

22
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
Proof. Assume to the contrary that
R =
[
n∈N
Yn
for some nowhere dense sets Yn in R, where
N = {n ∈Z: n ≥0}
denotes the set of natural numbers. Since Y0 is nowhere dense, by Theo-
rem 2.21, there exists an interval
[a0, b0] ⊆Y c
0 .
Since Y1 is nowhere dense, by Theorem 2.21, there exists an interval
[a1, b1] ⊆[a0, b0] ⊆Y c
1 .
Continuing in this way, one obtains a nested sequence of closed intervals
[an, bn] which is contained in Y c
n. From calculus, we know that the intersec-
tion
A =
\
n∈N
[an, bn] ̸= ∅.
But
A ⊆
\
n∈N
Y c
n =
 [
n∈N

= Rc = ∅,
a contradiction. This completes the proof.
□
2.5. Metrics and the metric topology
This section is devoted to a special kind of topological spaces — the metric
spaces. A parallel context is Sutherland’s book [38], which puts an emphasis
on metric spaces.
The Cartesian product of two sets X and Y is the set
X × Y = {(x, y): x ∈X, y ∈Y }.
It is also called the direct product. The Cartesian product of n copies of
a set X is usually denoted as Xn. A function
f : Xn →C
is said to be symmetric if
f(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = f(xi1, xi2, . . . , xin)
for any rearrangement (i1, i2, . . . , in) of the subscripts 1, 2, . . . , n, where C
is the set of complex numbers.

2.5. Metrics and the metric topology
23
Deﬁnition 2.23. A metric on a set X is a symmetric function
d: X × X →R≥0
satisfying the subadditivity
d(x, y) ≤d(y, z) + d(z, x),
which is also called the triangle inequality, and the equivalence
d(x, y) = 0 ⇐⇒x = y.
A metric space is a pair (X, d), where d is a metric on X.
We will distinguish the notation of a topological space (X, Ω) and the
notation of a metric space (X, d) by statements.
As will be seen in Deﬁnition 2.31, a metric induces a topology.
Example 2.24. For any set X, the function d0 : X × X →R≥0 deﬁned by
(2.1)
d0(x, y) =
(
0,
if x = y,
1,
if x ̸= y
is a metric.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 2.23.
□
Metrics may produce new metrics in some way.
Example 2.25. For any metrics d1 and d2 on a set X, the functions
ρ+ = d1 + d2
and
ρmax = max{d1, d2}
are also metrics on X.
Proof. The symmetry and positive semi-deﬁnity for each of the functions ρ+
and ρmax are clear. The subadditivities are shown below.
ρ+(x, z) + ρ+(y, z) =
 d1(x, z) + d2(x, z)

+
 d1(y, z) + d2(y, z)

=
 d1(x, z) + d1(y, z)

+
 d2(x, z) + d2(y, z)

≥d1(x, y) + d2(x, y) = ρ+(x, y);
ρmax(x, z) + ρmax(y, z) = max{d1(x, z), d2(x, z)} + max{d1(y, z), d2(y, z)}
≥max{d1(x, z) + d1(y, z), d2(x, z) + d2(y, z)}
≥max{d1(x, y), d2(x, y)} = ρmax(x, y).
The properties of being deﬁnite can be shown as follows.
ρ+(x, y) = 0
⇐⇒
d1(x, y) = 0
and
d2(x, y) = 0
⇐⇒
x = y.
ρmax(x, y) = 0
⇐⇒
d1(x, y) = 0
and
d2(x, y) = 0
⇐⇒
x = y.
This completes the proof.
□

24
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
Exercises 2.19 and 2.20 give other two ways of self-production of metrics.
The concept of norm in linear algebra, functional analysis and related
areas has a close relationship with metrics. Let X be a set. A function
f : X →R
is subadditive if
f(x + y) ≤f(x) + f(y)
for any x, y ∈X. Let V be a vector space over R. A seminorm on V is a
function
∥·∥: V →R
that is subadditive and absolutely scalable:
∥λv∥= |λ|· ∥v∥,
∀λ ∈R, ∀v ∈V.
The trivial seminorm is the function that maps every vector to zero. Any
seminorm is positive semi-deﬁnite, i.e.,
∥v∥≥0,
∀v ∈V.
In fact, the absolute scalability implies
∥0∥= 0
and
∥−v∥= ∥v∥.
Taking u = −v in the subadditivity condition that
∥u + v∥≤∥u∥+ ∥v∥,
we obtain ∥v∥≥0. A seminorm is a norm if it is deﬁnite, that is, if it
satisﬁes the implication
∥v∥= 0 ⇒v = 0.
Deﬁnition 2.26. A normed space is a vector space equipped with a norm.
Any norm ∥·∥on a vector space V over R induces the metric d deﬁned by
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥,
called the metric induced by the norm.
Denote
H = {x ∈R: x ≥1} ∪{+∞}.
Let p ∈H and
x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈Cn.
The p-norm of x is the function deﬁned by
(2.2)
∥x∥p =
 n
X
i=1
|xi|p
!1/p
.

2.5. Metrics and the metric topology
25
The 1-norm is also called the grid norm, the Manhattan norm, or the
taxicab norm.
The 2-norm is also called the Euclidean norm.
The
∞-norm is equivalent to the maximum norm, which is deﬁned by
∥x∥max = max
1≤i≤n|xi|.
In fact,
∥x∥∞= lim
p→∞
 n
X
i=1
|xi|p
!1/p

∥x∥p
max
!1/p
= ∥x∥max · lim
p→∞|{1 ≤i ≤n: |xi| = ∥x∥max}|1/p
= ∥x∥max.
It is clear that the function deﬁned by Eq. (2.2) satisﬁes the absolutely
scalability and deﬁniteness in Deﬁnition 2.26. The subadditivity of a p-norm
is called Minkowski’s inequality; see Theorem A.5 for its proof.
Let p ∈H. Consider the metric
(2.3)
ρ(p)(x, y) =
 n

i=1
|xi −yi|p
!1/p
induced by the p-norm. In particular, the metric
ρ(2)(x, y) =
v

n
X
i=1
(xi −yi)2
is called the Euclidean metric, and the metric
(2.4)
ρ(∞)(x, y) = max
1≤i≤n|xi −yi|
is called the Chebyshev distance or chessboard distance. The Cheby-
shev distance is used in warehouse logistics, as it eﬀectively measures the
time that an overhead crane needs to move an object from one place to
another; see [14, page 96].
Let (X, d) be a metric space. Let r ≥0. The open ball of radius r
centered at x ∈X is the set
B(x, r) = {y ∈X : d(x, y) < r}.
The disk of radius r centered at x ∈X is the set
D(x, r) = {y ∈X : d(x, y) ≤r}.

26
Chapter 2
Topological Spaces
The sphere of radius r centered at x ∈X is the set
S(x, r) = {y ∈X : d(x, y) = r}.
The unit open ball in Rn is denoted as Bn, that is,
Bn = {y ∈Rn : d(0, y) < 1}.
The unit disk in Rn is denoted as Dn, that is,
Dn = {y ∈Rn : d(0, y) ≤1}.
The unit sphere in Rn+1 is denoted as Sn, that is,
Sn = {y ∈Rn+1 : d(y, 0) = 1}.
A subset of X is bounded if it is contained in a ball.
For instance, the set D1 is the interval [−1, 1], the set D2 is a plane disk,
and the set D3 is a ball; the set S0 is the doubleton {±1}, the set S1 is a
circle, and the set S2 is a sphere. The names “ball” “disk” and “sphere” are
borrowed from those in the Euclidean space. However, they may be rather
surprising in other metric spaces.
Example 2.27. The unit ball in R2 equipped with the metric ρ(1) is a
closed square of side length
√
2, and the unit ball in R2 equipped with the
metric ρ(∞) is a closed square of side length 2.
Deﬁnition 2.28. Let (X, d) be a metric space with A ⊆X. The diameter
of A is the number
sup
x,y∈A
d(x, y).
The distance between A and a point x ∈X is the number
inf
a∈A d(x, a),
denoted as d(x, A) or d(A, x) equivalently. The Hausdorﬀdistance be-
tween two subsets A and B of X is the number
dH(A, B) = max

sup
a∈A
d(a, B), sup
b∈B
d(A, b)

.
In computer graphics the Hausdorﬀdistance is used to measure the
diﬀerence between two diﬀerent representations of the same 3-dimensional
object.
Proposition 2.29. Let A be a closed set. Then
d(A, b) = 0 ⇐⇒b ∈A.

2.5. Metrics and the metric topology
27
Hint. If d(A, b) = 0, then each ball centered at b has a nonempty intersec-
tion with A. Hence
b /∈Ac
and
b ∈Cl(A) = A.
□
Theorem 2.30. For every metric space, the Hausdorﬀdistance is a metric
on the set of its closed bounded subsets.
Proof. We should verify the three conditions for a metric. Let (X, d) be a
metric space. Let A, B, C be closed bounded subsets of X.
(1) Symmetry and positivity. Clear from deﬁnition.
(2) Deﬁniteness. By Proposition 2.29, we can infer that
dH(A, B) = 0
⇐⇒sup
a∈A
d(a, B) = sup
b∈B
d(A, b) = 0
⇐⇒d(a, B) = d(A, b) = 0
for all a ∈A and b ∈B
⇐⇒a ∈B
and
b ∈A
for all a ∈A and b ∈B
⇐⇒A ⊆B
and
B ⊆A
⇐⇒A = B.
(3) Subadditivity. Let
r(A, B) = sup
a∈A
d(a, B).
Then
dH(A, B) = max
 r(A, B), r(B, A)

.
To show the subadditivity of dH, it suﬃces to show the subadditiv-
ity of the function r. By the subadditivity of d, for all a ∈A and
all b ∈B, we have
d(a, C) ≤d(a, b) + d(b, C)
≤d(a, b) + r(B, C).
It follows from the arbitrariness of b, we infer that
r(A, C) ≤d(a, C)
≤d(a, B) + r(B, C)
≤r(A, B) + r(B, C).
This completes the proof.

Every metric space is a topological space in the following sense.

Ωd = ⟨open balls in X⟩
on X generated by d. A topological space (X, Ω) is metrizable if
Ω= Ωd
for some metric d on X. Two metrics d1 and d2 on X are equivalent if
Ωd1 = Ωd2,
denoted d1 ∼d2.
Theorem 2.32. Let X be a ﬁnite topological space. Then X is metrizable
if and only if it is discrete.
Proof. Let (X, Ω) be a ﬁnite space. If X is discrete, then Ω= 2X from
deﬁnition. Under the metric d0 deﬁned by Eq. (2.1), every singleton in X is
open since
{x} = B(x, 1/2) ∈Ω.
Hence every subset of X is open under the topology generated by d0. Con-
versely, suppose that Ωis generated by a metric d. Let
mx = min

d(x, y): y ∈X \ {x}
	
.
Since X is ﬁnite, we have mx > 0. Then every singleton
{x} = B(x, mx/2)
is open. Thus Ωis the discrete topology.
□
Theorem 2.33. Let d1 and d2 be two metrics on a set X. If there exist
positive numbers c and C such that
c · d1(x, y) ≤d2(x, y) ≤C · d1(x, y)
for all points x, y ∈X, then d1 and d2 are equivalent.
Proof. Let Ωi (i = 1, 2) be the topology on X generated by di. The desired
equivalence says Ω1 = Ω2.
First, we show that Ω2 ⊆Ω1. Since any open set O2 ∈Ω2 is the union of
some open balls with respect to the metric d2, it suﬃces to recast a typical
ball of the form
B(x, r) = {z ∈X : d2(x, z) < r}
as a member in Ω1, i.e., the union of open balls with respect to the metric
d1. Deﬁne
U(x, r) =
[
z∈B(x,r)
{y ∈X : d1(y, z) < L},

2.5. Metrics and the metric topology

where
L = r −d2(x, z)
2C
.
Then U(x, r) ∈Ω1. We shall show that
B(x, r) = U(x, r).
On one hand, for any z ∈B(x, r), since
d1(z, z) = 0 < L,
we have z ∈U(x, r). On the other hand, for any y ∈U(x, r), there exists
z ∈B(x, r) such that
d1(y, z) < L.
Then
d2(x, y) ≤d2(x, z) + d2(y, z)
≤d2(x, z) + C· d1(y, z)
≤d2(x, z) + C· L
< r.
Thus y ∈B(x, r). This proves
B(x, r) = U(x, r)
and
Ω2 ⊆Ω1.
From premise, we have
d1(x, y) ≤c−1· d2(x, y).
Along the same lines, one may show that Ω1 ⊆Ω2, which implies
Ω1 = Ω2
immediately.

2.8) In linear algebra, a set B of elements in a vector space V is called a
basis if every element of V may be written in a unique way as a ﬁnite
linear combination of elements of B. In contrast to a basis, it is not
necessary for a base to be maximal. For example, any open set can be
added to a base to form a new base. Moreover, a topological space may
have disjoint bases of distinct sizes. For example, the standard topology
on the real line has a base of all open intervals with rational ends, and
another base of all open intervals with irrational ends.

2.11) Let x ∈R with a neighborhood U. Since the set Uc is ﬁnite, we have
n ∈U for large n. In other words, the point x is a limit of the sequence N.
2.13) Yes. Let X be a set. Let
Cl∗: 2X →2X
be a map such that
(a) Cl∗∅= ∅;
(b) A ⊆Cl∗A for all subsets A ⊆X;
(c) Cl∗is distributive with the union operation:
Cl∗(A ∪B) = (Cl∗A) ∪(Cl∗B);
(d) Cl∗is idempotent:
Cl∗Cl∗A = Cl∗A.
Then the collection
Ω= {O ⊆X : Cl∗(Oc) = Oc}
is a topology on X. Moreover, the set Cl∗A is the closure of a set A in
the topological space (X, Ω).
2.14) (c) X = R2 and M = A = R.
2.16) Assume that R has an irreducible base β. Let A ∈β. By Theorem 2.5,
there exists a pair (xA, OA), where
xA ∈OA ⊆ΩR
such that the set A is the unique M ∈β such that
xA ∈M ⊆OA.
Note that the open set A is the union of some open intervals. Let IA be
the maximal open interval in A which contains xA.
We shall show that
A = IA.
In fact, since β is a base, the open set IA can be generated by β. If
A ̸= IA, then
IA ⊂A,
and IA can be generated by β \ {A}. It follows the existence of
B ∈β \ {A}

such that
xA ∈B ⊆IA.
Hence, both A, B ∈β well play the role of M, contradicting the unique-
ness of M. This proves
IA = A.
Let A = (u, v). Suppose that u ∈R. Since for each n ≥1, the open
interval
Jn =

, v

can be generated by β \ {A}, the interval
A =
[
n≥1
Jn
can be generated by β\{A}. This proves that the base β can be reduced
by removing the member A. Along the same lines we can prove the
reducibility if v ∈R. Otherwise
A = (−∞, ∞).
Since the interval (−n, n) can be generated by β \ {A} for each positive
integer n, so can the interval A. Hence β is reducible.
2.17) (a) Let A ⊆X such that
A /∈{∅, X}.
If X is indiscrete, then there is only one nonempty open set, that
is, the whole set X. Certainly A meets X. By Theorem 2.19, the
set A is everywhere dense. Conversely, since
A = X ̸= A,
no A is closed. Hence X is indiscrete.
(b) Let A ⊆X such that
A /∈{∅, X}.
If X is discrete, then A is closed, and
A = A ̸= X.
Conversely, by Theorem 2.19, the set A does not meet some nonempty
open set. Taking A to be the complement of each singleton, we ﬁnd
that every singleton is open. Hence X is discrete.
(c) If sup S = ∞, then
(s, ∞) ∩S ̸= ∅

Thus S meets every nonempty open set, and is everywhere dense
by Theorem 2.19. Conversely, if
sup S ̸= ∞,
then there exists M > 0 such that s < M for any s ∈S. It follows
that
S ∩(M, ∞) = ∅.
By Theorem 2.19, we infer that S is not everywhere dense.

⇐⇒d(x, y) = 0
⇐⇒x = y.
2.20) We check that the function ρ(x, y) satisﬁes the 3 conditions for a metric.
(a) Subadditivity. Since
ρ(x, z) = min{d(x, z), 1} ≤1,
by the non-negativity of the metric d, the desired inequality holds
if
d(x, y) ≥1
or
d(y, z) ≥1.
Consequently, we may suppose that
d(x, y) < 1
and
d(y, z) < 1.

38
Chapter 2

Then, by the subadditivity of d, we can infer that
ρ(x, y) + ρ(y, z) = d(x, y) + d(y, z)
≥d(x, z)
≥ρ(x, z).
(b) Symmetry. Directly by the symmetry of d.
(c) Being positive-deﬁnite. We have
ρ(x, y) ≥0
since d(x, y) ≥0, and
ρ(x, y) = 0 ⇐⇒d(x, y) = 0 ⇐⇒x = y.
2.24) Let (X, ΩX) be an indiscrete space. Then
ΩX = {∅, X}
from deﬁnition. Suppose that
|X| ≥2.
Then X contains two distinct points, say, x and y. If X is metrizable,
say, ΩX is generated by some metric d. Then
d(x, y) > 0
from deﬁnition, and the set
S = B
 x, d(x, y)/2

is open. But x ∈S and y /∈S, we infer that
S /∈ΩX,
a contradiction!
2.25) The number d∆(A, B) is the area of the symmetric diﬀerence A∆B.
Thus the symmetry and being positive-deﬁnite are clear. The subaddi-
tivity holds because
A∆C ⊆(A∆B) ∪(B∆C)
for any bounded plane polygons A, B, and C.

Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and
Homeomorphisms
The concept of continuous maps often appears as the ﬁrst notion in a book
on calculus or analysis. The epsilon-delta deﬁnition of continuity of a func-
tion on the real line was ﬁrst given by Bolzano in 1817. Generalizing it
without using the metric structure, one may deﬁne continuous maps be-
tween topological spaces. In Section 3.1, we shall formulate a deﬁnition of
continuity that includes all kinds of continuities as special cases and study
various properties of this general continuity. The essential concept of home-
omorphisms between topological spaces comes out in Section 3.2.
In this book, the words map and function are used interchangeably.
Let X be a topological space with a subset A ⊆X. The identity map
is the map
id: X →X
x 7→x.
It is a notion on the level of sets, rather than the level of topological spaces.
As a result, the identity map from a topological space A = (X, Ω) to another
space B = (X, ΩB) is not continuous when B has an open set that is not
open in A. The inclusion from A to X is the map
ι: A →X
x 7→x.
Let Y be a topological space with a subset B ⊆Y . A map
f : X →Y

40
Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
is a constant map if the image f(X) is a singleton. Let
f(A) ⊆B.
The submap of f from A to B is deﬁned by
f|A,B : A →B
x 7→f(x).
The submap
f|A = fA,Y
is the restriction of f to A. Note that the submap f|A,f(A) is considered
to be diﬀerent from the restriction f|A in general. For any map
f : X →X
on a set X, a point x ∈X is said to be a ﬁxed point of f if f(x) = x.
3.1. Continuous maps
Deﬁnition 3.1. A map
f : (X, ΩX) →(Y, ΩY )
between topological spaces is open if every open set of X is mapped to an
open set of Y . The map f is closed if every closed set of X is mapped to
a closed set of Y . The map f is continuous if the preimage of any open
set of Y is an open set of X. It is continuous at a point x ∈X if the set
f−1(V ) is a neighborhood of x for every neighborhood V of f(x).
Example 3.2 exhibits that the notion of continuity in topology and that
in calculus are diﬀerent.
Example 3.2. Consider topological spaces (X, ΩR) and (Y, ΩY ), where
X = Y = [0, 2].
If ΩY = ΩR, then the function
f : X →Y
x 7→
(
x,
if x ∈[0, 1),
3 −x,
if x ∈[1, 2]
is not continuous. This coincides with what we learnt from analysis. If the
topology ΩY is induced from the arrow, then the function
f : X →Y
x 7→
(
x,
if x ∈[0, 1],
x + 1,
if x ∈(1, 2]
is continuous! This is diﬀerent from what we know from analysis.

3.1. Continuous maps
41
We collect Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 to 3.8 for justifying the continuity of a
map, and give some properties of continuous maps in Theorems 3.9 and 3.10
and Corollaries 3.11 and 3.12.
Theorem 3.3 (Characterizations of map continuity). Let
f : (X, ΩX) →(Y, ΩY )
be a map between topological spaces.
Then the following statements are
equivalent.
(1) The map f is continuous, namely, the preimage of any open set
under f is open.
(2) The preimage of any closed set under f is closed.
(3) The preimage of any member of a base under f is open.
(4) The preimage of any neighborhood under f is a neighborhood, i.e.,
the map f is continuous at each point.
(5) f(A) ⊆f(A), ∀A ⊆X.
(6) f−1(B) ⊆f−1(B), ∀B ⊆Y .
Proof. It is straightforward by deﬁnition that each of (2) to (4) is equivalent
to (1). We will show that (4) ⇐⇒(5) and (6) ⇐⇒(2).
(4) ⇒(5): Let x ∈A. Let V be a neighborhood of f(x). By (4), the
preimage f−1(V ) is a neighborhood in X. Since f−1(V ) is a neighborhood
of x, we have
f−1(M) ∩A ̸= ∅
and
V ∩f(A) = f
 f−1(V ) ∩A

̸= ∅.
(5) ⇒(4): Let x ∈X. Let V be a neighborhood of f(x). Assume that (4)
is false. Then the preimage f−1(V ) is not a neighborhood of x. Deﬁne
A = X \ f−1(V ).
Then x ∈A. It follows that
f(x) ∈f(A) ⊆f(A).
Thus the image f(A) meets every neighborhood of f(x). In particular, we
have
f(A) ∩V ̸= ∅,
contradicting the deﬁnition of A.
(6) ⇒(2): Let B be a closed subset of Y . Then B = B, and
f−1(B) ⊆f−1(B) = f−1(B).

42
Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
It follows that
f−1(B) = f−1(B)
is closed. (2) ⇒(6): Since B ⊆B, we have
f−1(B) ⊆f−1(B).
By Theorem 2.15, the closure B is closed, we infer that f−1(B) is closed.
Since the closure f−1(B) is the smallest closed set containing the preim-
age f−1(B), we derive that
f−1(B) ⊆f−1(B).
This completes the proof.

Proposition 3.4 consists of some common maps which are continuous.
Proposition 3.4. We have the following.
(1) The identity map is continuous.
(2) Any constant map is continuous.
(3) Any inclusion is continuous.
(4) Any submap of a continuous map
f : X →Y
is continuous. In particular, for any subset A ⊆X, both the re-
striction f|A and the submap f|A,f(A) are continuous.
(5) The composition
g ◦f : X →Z
of any continuous maps f : X →Y and g: Y →Z is continuous.
(6) Any metric with respect to the metric topology is continuous.
(7) For any subset A of a metric space (X, d), the function
dA : X →R
x 7→d(x, A)
is continuous.
Hint. (1) to (5) can be derived by Deﬁnition 3.1.

The proof of Theorem 3.6 needs Lemma 3.5.
Lemma 3.5. Let f : X →R be a continuous function. Then for any p ∈X,
there exists a neighborhood U of p such that f is bounded in U. If
0 /∈f(X),
then there exists a neighborhood V of p in which
(1) the absolute value |f(x)| has a positive lower bound in V , and
(2) f(x)f(p) > 0.
Proof. Let p ∈X and ϵ > 0. Since f is continuous, for any ϵ > 0, there
exists a neighborhood U of p such that
|f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ.
Thus
|f(x)| ≤|f(p)| + ϵ,
i.e., f is bounded in U. If 0 /∈f(X), then
f(p) ̸= 0,
and one may require the above ϵ < |f(p)/2|. Then
|f(x)| ≥|f(p) −ϵ| > ϵ.
Moreover, the inequality
|f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ
implies that f(x)f(p) > 0.
□
Theorem 3.6. Let f, g: X →R be continuous functions. Then the func-
tions X →R deﬁned by the following formulas are all continuous:
x 7→f(x) ± g(x),
x 7→f(x)g(x),
x 7→f(x)/g(x),
if 0 /∈g(X),
x 7→|f(x)|,
x 7→min{f(x), g(x)},
x 7→max{f(x), g(x)}.
Proof. We show them individually. Let p ∈X and ϵ > 0.
(1) The continuity of the function f −g can be obtained by considering
the continuous functions f and −g. Deﬁne
h(x) = f(x) + g(x).

Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
For each function w ∈{f, g}, since w is continuous, there exists a
neighborhood Uw of p such that
|w(x) −w(p)| < ϵ/2
for all x ∈Uw. Hence
|h(x) −h(p)| ≤|f(x) −f(p)| + |g(x) −g(p)|
< ϵ
for any x ∈U, where
U = Uf ∩Ug
is a neighborhood of p. In other words, for any open interval J,
the preimage h−1(J) is a neighborhood in X.
This proves the
continuity of h(x).
(2) Let
h(x) = f(x)g(x).
Since f is continuous, by Lemma 3.5, there exists a neighbor-
hood Uf of p such that
|f(x)| < 1
and
|g(p)| · |f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ/2.
Since g is continuous, there exists a neighborhood Ug of p such that
|g(x) −g(p)| < ϵ/2.
Therefore, one may infer that
|h(x) −h(p)| ≤|f(x)| · |g(x) −g(p)| + |g(p)| · |f(x) −f(p)|
< ϵ
for any x ∈U, where
U = Uf ∩Ug
is a neighborhood of p. This proves the continuity of h(x).
(3) By using the continuity of the product of continuous functions, it
suﬃces to show that the function
h(x) = 1/g(x)
is continuous.
In fact, by Lemma 3.5, there exist ℓ> 0 and a
neighborhood U1 of p such that
|g(x)g(p)| ≥ℓ.
By the continuity of g, there exists a neighborhood U2 of p such
that
|g(x) −g(p)| < ϵℓ.

(4) Let
h(x) = |f(x)|.
By Lemma 3.5, there exists a neighborhood U1 of p such that
f(x)f(p) > 0.
Since f is continuous, there exists a neighborhood U2 of p such that
|f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ.
Therefore, we infer that
|h(x) −h(p)| = |f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ
for any x ∈U1 ∩U2.
(5) Hint. Use the continuities of the sum and absolute value of con-
tinuous functions, and the fact that
min{f(x), g(x)} = f(x) + g(x)

−|f(x) −g(x)|

(6) The continuity of the function
max{f, g} = −min{−f, −g}
can be obtained by the continuity of the minimum of continuous
functions.
This completes the proof.

Theorem 3.8 provides a way of proving the continuity of a map in the
spirit of divide-and-conquer; see Theorem 4.28 for an application.

Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
Theorem 3.8. Let f : X →Y be a map between topological spaces. Let Γ
be a fundamental cover of X such that the restriction
f|A : A →Y
is continuous for any A ∈Γ, then f is continuous.
Proof. Let O be an open set in Y . Since f|A is continuous, we have
f−1(O) ∩A = f
−1
A (O)
is open in A for all A ∈Γ. Since Γ is a fundamental cover, we ﬁnd f−1(O)
is open in X. Hence f is continuous.
□
Theorem 3.9. Any continuous image of an everywhere dense space is ev-
erywhere dense.
Proof. Let f : X →Y be a surjective continuous map between topological
spaces. Let A be an everywhere dense set of X. Since f is surjective, we
have
f(A) = f(X) = Y.
Since f is continuous, by Theorem 3.3 (5), we have
f(A) ⊆f(A).
Therefore, we obtain f(A) = Y , i.e., f(A) is everywhere dense.
□
When the codomain Y is the real line, a continuous map has some more
properties.
Theorem 3.10. Let
f1, f2, . . . , fl, g1, g2, . . . , gm, h1, h2, . . . , hn : X →R
be continuous functions. Let

f1(x) ≤0, . . . , fl(x) ≤0,

B =
(
x ∈X :
(
f1(x) < 0, . . . , fl(x) < 0,
h1(x) > 0, . . . , hn(x) > 0.
)
Then the set A is closed and the set B is open.
Proof. The set A is the intersection of a ﬁnite number of preimages of the
closed sets

Before ending this section, we introduce the concept of a retract, which
is a basic concept in the study of algebraic topology.
Deﬁnition 3.13. Let X be a topological space with a subset A. A map
ρ: X →A
is a retraction if ρ is continuous and
ρ|A = idA .
The subspace A is a retract of X if there exists a retraction X →A.
In analog with Proposition 2.8, we have Proposition 3.14.
Proposition 3.14. Let X be a topological space with
A ⊆M ⊆X.
(1) If A is a retract of X, then A is a retract of M.
(2) If A is a retract of M, and if M is a retract of X, then A is a
retract of X.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 3.13.
□
The signiﬁcance of retractions can be seen from Theorem 3.15.

Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
Theorem 3.15. A subset A of a topological space X is a retract of X if
and only if for any space Y every continuous map A →Y extends to a
continuous map X →Y .
Proof. ⇒. Let
ρ: X →A
be a retraction. Then any continuous map
f : A →Y
extends to a continuous map
f ◦ρ: X →Y.
⇐. Take Y = A. The identity map
A →Y
extends to a continuous map X →Y , that is, a retraction X →A.
□
3.2. Homeomorphisms
This section concerns a key concept in topology — the homeomorphism
between topological spaces.
We will see along with examples that many
spaces are essentially the same up to homeomorphism.
Deﬁnition 3.16. Given topological spaces X and Y . An invertible map
h: X →Y
is a homeomorphism if both h and h−1 are continuous. The space X is
homeomorphic or topologically equivalent to Y , denoted X ∼= Y ,7 if
there exists a homeomorphism between them.
Proposition 3.17. For any continuous bijection h: X →Y between topo-
logical spaces, the following are equivalent:
• The map h is a homeomorphism.
• The map h is open.
• The map h is closed.
Proof. Note that when a map h is invertible, the inverse h−1 is continuous
if and only if h is open. The results then follow from Deﬁnition 3.16.
□
Since the identity map of any topological space is a homeomorphism,
and both composition and inverse preserve homeomorphisms, we conclude
that being homeomorphic is an equivalent relation. Proposition 3.17 reveals
the importance of open maps and closed maps.
7One may see any sign closed to but distinct from the equal sign =, such as ∼, ≃, ≈from
other resources, which are used to denote the homeomorphism.

3.2. Homeomorphisms
49
Example 3.18. The function
f : [ 0, 1) →C
x 7→e2πix
is continuous but not open. This can be seen from the fact that the image
of the open set [ 0, 1/2) is not open. As a consequence, the spaces [ 0, 1) and
the set C are not homeomorphic.
Theorem 3.19. For any homeomorphism h: (X, ΩX) →(Y, ΩY ), we have
the following.
(1) A subset A ⊆X is open if and only if h(A) is open.
(2) A subset F ⊆X is closed if and only if h(F) is closed.
(3) A subset A ⊆X is a neighborhood of a point x ∈X if and only if
the subset h(A) ⊆Y is a neighborhood of the point h(x) ∈Y .
(4) The homeomorphism h commutes with the set operators Cl and Int,
that is,
h(A) = h(A)
and
h(A◦) =
 h(A)
◦
for any A ⊆X.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 3.16.
□
When the notion of topological spaces had not yet been developed, math-
ematicians studied only subspaces of Euclidean spaces, the continuous maps
and homeomorphisms between them. In his famous Erlangen Program8 pub-
lished in 1872, Klein classiﬁed various geometries that had emerged up to
that time, like Euclidean geometry, aﬃne geometry, and projective geome-
try, and deﬁned topology as a part of geometry that deals with properties
that are preserved by homeomorphisms.
Example 3.20. The spaces Z, Q, R, the coﬁnite space, and the arrow are
pairwise non-homeomorphic. In fact, we can ﬁnd properties that distinguish
them: Z is discrete, Q is countable, each proper closed subset of the coﬁ-
nite space is ﬁnite, and any two nonempty open sets in the arrow have a
nonempty intersection.
Example 3.21. An aﬃne transformation on Rn is a map
f : Rn →Rn
x 7→Ax + b,
8Named after the University Erlangen-N¨urnberg, where Klein worked.

50
Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
where A is a matrix and b is a vector. It is said to be nondegenerate if A
is invertible. Every nondegenerate aﬃne transformation on Rn is a homeo-
morphism. In fact, since f is nondegenerate, we have
x = A−1 f(x) −b

= A−1 f(x)

−A−1(b),
which means that f is a bijection and f−1 is also a nondegenerate aﬃne
transformation.
Since the maps f and f−1 are given in coordinates by
linear formulas, they are continuous.
Example 3.22. For any R > 0, the inversion
τ : Rn \ {0} →Rn \ {0}
x 7→R ·
x
|x|2
is a homeomorphism. In fact, the inversion τ is an involution. One may use
Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 to show the continuity.
Example 3.23. Let
H = {z ∈C: ℑz > 0}
be the upper half plane. Let a, b, c, d ∈R such that
ad > bc.
Then the M¨obius transformation
f : H →H
z 7→az + b
cz + d
is a homeomorphism. In fact, since
ℑ
 f(x + yi)

= (ad −bc)y
|cz + d|2 ,
we have
f(H) ⊆H.
One may ﬁnd the inverse and use Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 to show the conti-
nuity.
Example 3.24. The graph of a map f : X →Y is the set
Γf(X) =
 x, f(x)

: x ∈X
	
⊆X × Y.
The notion “graph” here requires the set
Γf ∩
 {x} × Y


3.2. Homeomorphisms
51
to be a singleton for any x ∈X. Since the vertical projection determines a
homeomorphism, the graph of a continuous real-valued function deﬁned on
an interval is homeomorphic to the interval.
Theorem 3.25. Let p ∈Sn. The punctured sphere Sn\{p} is homeomorphic
to Rn.
Proof. Let
p = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) ∈Rn+1
be the north pole of Sn. Deﬁne two maps
f : Sn \ {p} →Rn
(x1, . . . , xn+1) 7→

x1
1 −xn+1

|x|2 + 1

|x|2 + 1

,
where
|x|2 =
n
X
i=1
x2
i .
By Theorem 3.7, the maps f and g are continuous.
We claim that the map f is a homeomorphism. In fact, it is routine to
check that f ◦g is the identity map on Rn, and that g ◦f is the identity map
on Sn \ {p}. This completes the proof.
□
The map
f : Sn \ {p} →Rn
in the proof of Theorem 3.25 is a particular mapping that projects a sphere
onto a plane, and called the stereographic projection.
Example 3.26. D2 ∼= I2.
Proof. Let
S = {(x, y) ∈R2 : x, y ∈[−1, 1]}.
We have the homeomorphisms
I2 →S
(x, y) 7→(2x −1, 2y −1)

Geometrically, this means that each segment joining the origin with a point
on the contour of the square is linearly mapped to the part of the segment
that lies in the circle.
□
Deﬁnition 3.27. Let X and Y be topological spaces. A topological em-
bedding is a continuous map
f : X →Y
such that the submap f : X →f(X) is a homeomorphism, denoted as
f : X ,→Y.
The space X is embeddable in Y if there is an embedding
f : X ,→Y.
Suppose that (X, dX) and (Y, dY ) are metric spaces. An embedding
f : X ,→Y
is isometric if
dY
 f(a), f(b)

= dX(a, b)
for all a, b ∈X. An isometry is a bijective isometric embedding.
Proposition 3.28. The identity map is an embedding. Any inclusion is an
embedding. The composition of embeddings is an embedding.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 3.27.
□
Proposition 3.29. Any isometry is a homeomorphism.
Proof. By Deﬁnitions 3.16 and 3.27.
□
Theorem 3.30. For any metric spaces (X, dX) and (Y, dY ), there exists a
metric space Z such that both X and Y are isometrically embeddable in Z.
Proof. Consider the set
W = X ⊔Y
of disjoint union of X and Y . Fix x0 ∈X and y0 ∈Y . For x, y ∈W, we
deﬁne a function
f(x, y) =





dX(x, y),
if x, y ∈X;
dY (x, y),
if x, y ∈Y ;
dX(x, x0) + dY (y, y0) + 1,
if x ∈X and y ∈Y .

3.3. Topological properties
53
We shall show that f is a metric on W. The positive-deﬁniteness and sym-
metry of f are clear. It remains to show the triangle inequality for f with
respect to three elements in W. If the three elements are all in X, or all
in Y , then the subadditivity of X or Y itself works. Otherwise, we can
suppose that x1, x2 ∈X and y ∈Y , and it suﬃces to show that
f(x1, x2) + f(x1, y) ≥f(x2, y)
and
f(x1, y) + f(x2, y) ≥f(x1, x2),
that is,
dX(x1, x2) + dX(x1, x0) ≥dX(x2, x0)
and
dX(x1, x0) + dX(x2, x0) + 2dY (y, y0) + 2 ≥dX(x1, x2).
Both of them hold as the triangle inequalities with respect to the elements
x0, x1 and x2 in X.
□
3.3. Topological properties
In order to prove that two spaces are homeomorphic, it suﬃces to present
a homeomorphism between them. In contrast, to prove that two spaces are
not homeomorphic, we usually look for a property or a characteristic shared
by homeomorphic spaces such that one of the spaces has it and the other
one does not.
Deﬁnition 3.31. A topological invariant is an invariant of a topological
space which is invariant under homeomorphisms. A topological property
is a topological invariant which is a property of that topological space.
Obvious examples include the cardinality or inﬁniteness of a space. Less
obvious properties are the main object of the subsequent chapters. Propo-
sition 3.32 is a criterion for topological properties which will be frequently
of use in the sequel.
Proposition 3.32. Let X be a topological space satisfying a property P.
Then P is a topological property if it is satisﬁed by every topological space Y
such that a continuous surjection f : X →Y exists.
Proof. Let
f : X →Y
be a homeomorphism. Then Y is the continuous image of X. From premise,
if X satisﬁes a property P, then so does Y . This proves that P is a topo-
logical property.
□
Proposition 3.33. Any topological property which is preserved by any con-
tinuous image is inherited by a retract.

54
Chapter 3
Continuous Maps and Homeomorphisms
Proof. By Deﬁnition 3.13.
□
Deﬁnition 3.34. A topological property is hereditary if it is inherited by
any of its subspaces. A topological property is closed-hereditary if it is
inherited by any of its closed subspaces.
It is clear that the heredity of a topological property implies the closed-
heredity of that property. A quick example is that the ﬁniteness of a set is
hereditary and the inﬁniteness of a set is not hereditary.
Proposition 3.35. Any hereditary topological property of the ambient space
is inherited by a retract.
Proof. By Deﬁnitions 3.13 and 3.34.
□
The remaining of this book is devoted to three kinds of studies on topo-
logical spaces. One is to show that some properties of topological spaces are
topological properties and give suﬃcient, necessary, or suﬃcient and neces-
sary conditions for them to be satisﬁed. Another is to study the interactions
of topological properties. A typical result is of the form that if there exists
a continuous map
f : X →Y
between topological spaces X and Y , where X and Y satisfy some topolog-
ical properties, then X or Y must satisfy certain properties. The third kind
of study is about properties that satisﬁed by topological properties, such
like the heredity.

Chapter 4
Connectedness
The intermediate value theorem says that for any real-valued continuous
function f on a closed interval [a, b] and for any number r between f(a) and
f(b), there exists some number c ∈[a, b] such that
f(c) = r;
see Corollary 4.15. It depends on both the continuity of f and some property
of the domain [a, b]. The latter property is what we call connectedness for
a general topological space.
4.1. Connected spaces
Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological space X is connected if it has no clopen
subsets except the empty set and X itself. A topological space is discon-
nected if it is not connected. A connected component of a topological
space X is a maximal nonempty connected subset of X. A disconnected
space is totally disconnected if every singleton is a component.
Note that the connectedness is not hereditary. Intuitively, being con-
nected means being all in one piece. But it is not the case sometimes.
Example 4.2. The following topological spaces are connected.
(1) The empty set.
(2) Any singleton space.
(3) Any indiscrete space.
(4) The coﬁnite space.
(5) The arrow.

Chapter 4
Connectedness
Example 4.3. The following topological spaces are totally disconnected.
(1) Any discrete space X with
|X| ≥2.
In particular, the set
S0 = {−1, 1}
is totally disconnected.
Proof. Let A ⊆X such that
|A| ≥2.
Let S be a singleton of A. Then
A = S ∪Sc
is the union of nonempty open sets of A, and thus disconnected.
Thus any connected component of X is a singleton.
□
(2) Q.
Proof. Let A ⊆Q such that
|A| ≥2.
Let x, z ∈A and x < z. Then there exists y ∈R \ Q such that
x < y < z. It follows that
(4.1)
A =
 A ∩(−∞, y)

∪
 A ∩(y, ∞)

is the union of nonempty open sets, and thus disconnected. Hence
any connected component of Q has at most one element.

Theorem 4.4 (Characterization of the disconnectedness). Let X be a topo-
logical space. Then the following are equivalent.
(1) The space X is disconnected.
(2) There exist nonempty open sets A and B such that
(4.2)
X = A ⊔B.
(3) There exist nonempty closed sets A and B satisfying Eq. (4.2).
(4) There exist nonempty clopen sets A and B satisfying Eq. (4.2).
(5) There exists a continuous surjection from X to S0.

4.1. Connected spaces
61
Proof. If X is disconnected, then X has a nonempty proper clopen subset,
say, A. Let B = Ac. Then B is nonempty and open, and A and B satisfy
Eq. (4.2).
If X = A ⊔B for some nonempty open sets A and B, then the sets
A = Bc
and
B = Ac
are closed. Hence both A and B are clopen. In this case, we deﬁne a map
f : X →S0
x 7→
(
−1,
if x ∈A;
1,
if x ∈B.
Since A and B are nonempty, the function f is surjective. Since the preimage
of every subset of S0 is open, we infer that f is continuous.
Suppose that there exists a continuous surjection
f : X →S0.
Since the singleton {1} is a clopen subset of S0, the preimage
A = f−1(1)
is clopen. Since f is surjective, we have
A ̸= ∅
and
A ̸= X.
This proves that X is disconnected.
□
As will be seen, Theorem 4.4 is powerful in proving the connectedness of
a space. For convenience, we call the last suﬃcient and necessary condition
of disconnectedness the S0-condition.
Theorem 4.5. Any continuous image of a connected space is connected. As
a consequence, the connectedness is a topological property, and the number
of components is a topological invariant.
Proof. Let f : X →Y be a continuous surjection. If Y is disconnected, by
Theorem 4.4, there exists a continuous surjection
g: Y →S0.
Since the composition
g ◦f : X →S0
is a continuous surjection, by Theorem 4.4, X is disconnected, a contradic-
tion. The consequence follows from Proposition 3.32.
□
Corollary 4.6. Any retract of a connected space is connected.
Proof. By Theorem 4.5 and Proposition 3.33.

Chapter 4
Connectedness
Here are two examples of distinguishing topological spaces by using The-
orem 4.5.
Example 4.7. R ̸∼= Rn for n ≥2.
Hint. Removing a point from R produces a disconnected space while re-
moving a point from Rn for any n > 1 produces a connected space. Use
Theorem 4.5.
□
Example 4.8. The topological spaces I, [ 0, 1), R and S1 are pairwise non-
homeomorphic.
Proof. First, one may remove an inﬁnite number of points from S1 and
keep the resulting space connected. This is not true for any of the other
three spaces. Second, the space I \{0, 1} is connected but removing any two
points from [ 0, 1) or from R yields a disconnected space. Third, the space
[ 0, 1)\{0} is connected but removing any point from R yields a disconnected
space. By Theorem 4.5, the four spaces are pairwise non-homeomorphic.
□
When
A ⊆M ⊆X,
it is safe to say that “A is connected” without specifying the ambient topol-
ogy (ΩM or ΩX) from which ΩA is induced. This is because the connected-
ness of a space relies only on the topology of that space; by Proposition 2.9
the topology of A induced from ΩM coincides with that induced from ΩX.
Theorem 4.9. Clopen sets “separate” connected sets.
Namely, if A is
clopen in X, and if C is connected in X, then either
C ⊆A
or
C ⊆X \ A.
Proof. If not, then C ∩A is a nonempty clopen subset of C, contradicting
the connectedness of C.
□
Theorem 4.10 and Corollary 4.11 provide two ways of proving the con-
nectedness of a space.
Theorem 4.10. Let Γ be a family of connected sets. If a connected set C
meets every member in Γ, then the union
[
A∈Γ
A ∪C
is connected.

4.1. Connected spaces
63
Proof. Let
X =
[
A∈Γ
A ∪C.
Suppose that
X = U ⊔V,
where U and V are clopen. By Theorem 4.9, the connected set C is contained
in either U or V . Without loss of generality we can suppose that
C ⊆U.
For any A ∈Γ, since
A ∩U ̸= ∅,
we can infer that
A ⊆U
by Theorem 4.9. Hence
V = V ∩X =
[
A∈Γ
(V ∩A) = ∅.
This proves the connectedness of X.
□
An alternative proof. If X is disconnected, by Theorem 4.4, there exists
a continuous surjection
f : X →S0.
Let A ∈Γ and xA ∈C ∩A. Without loss of generality we can suppose that
f(xA) = 1.
By Theorem 4.5, we infer that
f(x) = 1,
∀x ∈C ∪A.
For any other A′ ∈Γ, let x′ ∈C ∩A′. Since x′ ∈C, we have
f(x′) = 0.
By Theorem 4.5, we ﬁnd
f(x) = 1,
∀x ∈A′.
This proves that
f(x) = 1,
∀x ∈X,
contradicting that f is a surjection.
□
Corollary 4.11. Let {Ak}k∈Z be a family of connected sets such that
Ak ∩Ak+1 ̸= ∅
for all k. Then the union S
k∈Z Ak is connected.

64
Chapter 4
Connectedness
Proof. By Theorem 4.10, we can show by induction that the set
Bn =
n[
k=−n
Ak
is connected for all n ∈N. Using Theorem 4.10 again, we obtain the con-
nectedness of the union
[
k∈Z
Ak =
[
n∈N
Bn.
□
Theorem 4.12. Any point in a topological space is contained in a unique
component. As a consequence, any two distinct connected components are
disjoint.
Proof. The union of connected components which contains a point p is the
unique component. It is connected by Theorem 4.10.
□
As a particular case of Theorem 4.12, any connected space has only one
component.
Theorem 4.13. A subset of R is connected if and only if it is an interval.
Proof. Let A ⊆R. If A is not an interval, then there exist x, z ∈A and
y ̸∈A such that
x < y < z.
Then Eq. (4.1) holds true, and the set A is disconnected. Below we present
two proofs for the connectedness of any interval.
By the bisection method. Assume that an interval J is disconnected.
Then there exist nonempty closed sets U and V such that
J = U ⊔V.
Without loss of generality, we can suppose that there exist a0 ∈U and
b0 ∈V such that a0 < b0. For n ∈N, we write
cn = an + bn
2
and deﬁne
(an+1, bn+1) =
(
(an, cn),
if cn ∈V ;
(cn, bn),
if cn ∈U.
We obtain a sequence an in U and a sequence bn in V . It is clear that an
increases and bn decreases, and that
sup an = inf bn.
Since both U and V are closed, this limit lies in U ∩V , a contradiction.

4.1. Connected spaces
65
By the S0-condition.
Assume that A is a disconnected interval.
By
Theorem 4.4, there exists a continuous surjection
f : A →S0.
Then
f−1(±1) = A ∩
G
J∈Γ±
J,
where each Γ± is a nonempty collection of disjoint open intervals, and
J−∩J+ = ∅,
∀J± ∈Γ±.
It follows that
A = f−1(−1) ∪f−1(1) = A ∩
G
J∈Γ−∪Γ+
J.
Since the collection Γ−∪Γ+ contains two disjoint open intervals, the set A
is not an interval, a contradiction.
□
Corollary 4.14. Let X be a connected space. Let
f : X →R
be a continuous function. Then the image f(X) is an interval of R. In
particular, any continuous function R →R maps intervals to intervals.
Proof. By Theorems 4.5 and 4.13.
□
Corollary 4.15 (The intermediate value theorem). Any continuous func-
tion
f : [a, b] →R
takes every value between f(a) and f(b).
□
A set A ⊆Rn is convex if [a, b] ⊆A for all a, b ∈A.
Theorem 4.16. Any convex set in Rn is connected.
In particular, the
sets Bn and Dn are connected.
Proof. Let A be a convex set in Rn with x0 ∈A. Then the interval [a, x0]
is connected for any a ∈A. Therefore, the union
A =
[
a∈A
[a, x0]
is connected by Theorem 4.10.
□
In particular, the real line is convex and hence connected.
Theorem 4.17. Let X be a topological space with A ⊆X. If A is connected
and everywhere dense in X, then X is connected.

66
Chapter 4
Connectedness
Proof. Let X = U ⊔V , where U and V are open. Then
A = A ∩X = (A ∩U) ⊔(A ∩V ).
It follows from the connectedness of A that either
U ∩A = ∅
or
V ∩A = ∅.
By Theorem 2.19, any everywhere dense set meets every nonempty open set.
Therefore either U or V is empty. This proves the connectedness of X.
□
An alternative proof of Theorem 4.17. Suppose not. By Theorem 4.4,
there exists a continuous surjection f : X →S0. By Theorem 4.5, we can
suppose without loss of generality that f(a) = 1 for all a ∈A. By Theo-
rem 2.19, the open set f−1(−1) meets A, a contradiction.
□
Corollary 4.18. If A is connected and
A ⊆B ⊆A,
then B is connected. In particular, the closure operator preserves the con-
nectedness.
Proof. Since the set A is everywhere dense in B, the set B is connected by
Theorem 4.17.
□
Corollary 4.19. Any component of a topological space is closed.
Proof. Let C be a component. By Corollary 4.18, the closure C is con-
nected. By Theorem 4.12, the component C = C is closed.
□
Theorem 4.20 (Extension of the connectedness). Let A be a connected
subset of a connected space X. Then A ∪B is connected if B is a clopen
subset of Ac.
Proof. Let B be a clopen subset of Ac and let
C = A ∪B.
Assume to the contrary that C is disconnected. Then there exist open sets
U and V such that
U ∩C ̸= ∅,
V ∩C ̸= ∅,
U ∩V ∩C = ∅,
and
C ⊆U ∪V.
Let
W = U ∪V.

4.2. Path-Connectedness
67
By Proposition 2.8, both the sets U and V are clopen in W. Since A is
connected, A ⊆W. We infer from Theorem 4.9 that
A ⊆U
or
A ⊆V.
Without loss of generality we can suppose that
A ⊆U.
Let
D = V ∩C.
Then
D ̸= ∅.
We shall show that D is a clopen subset of X, which yields an immediate
contradiction to the premise that X is connected.
In fact, consider the topological space Ac with a subset V . Since B is
open in Ac from premise, the intersection
D = V ∩B
is an open subset of V . Since V is open in X, we infer by Proposition 2.8
that D is open in X. On the other hand, consider the topological space Ac
with a subset Uc. Since B is closed in Ac, the intersection
D = Uc ∩B
is closed in Uc. Since Uc is closed in X, we infer by Proposition 2.8 that D
is closed in X. This completes the proof.
□
4.2. Path-Connectedness
The concept of paths is used in constructing the elements of fundamental
groups in topology.
Deﬁnition 4.21. Let X be a topological space. A path in X is a continuous
map
γ : I →X
from the unit interval I to X, with the beginning point γ(0) and the end
point γ(1). We say that γ joins γ(0) with γ(1). The inverse path of γ is
the path
τ : I →X
t 7→γ(1 −t).
The space X is path-connected if there is a path joining any two points.
A path-connected component of X is a maximal path-connected subset
of X. A stationary path is a constant map I →X.

68
Chapter 4
Connectedness
Note that the inverse of a map γ is usually denoted by γ−1. It is diﬀerent
from the the inverse path τ of γ.
Theorem 4.22. Any path-connected space is connected.
Proof. Let X be path-connected. Assume to the contrary that X is dis-
connected. By Theorem 4.4, there exists a continuous surjection
f : X →S0.
Let
x ∈f−1(−1)
and
y ∈f−1(1).
Since X is path-connected, there exists a continuous map
g: I →X
connecting x and y. Then the composition
f ◦g: I →S0
is a continuous surjection, contradicting Theorem 4.5.
□
Conversely, a connected space is not necessarily path-connected, such
like the set of real numbers with the K-topology; see Exercise 4.12. Note
that the path-connectedness is not hereditary.
Theorem 4.23. Any continuous image of a path-connected space is path-
connected. As a consequence, the path-connectedness is a topological prop-
erty, and the number of path-connected components is a topological invariant.
Proof. Let
f : X →Y
be a continuous map between topological spaces, where X is path-connected.
Let
y1 = f(x1)
and
y2 = f(x2).
Let
u: I →X
be a path connecting x1 and x2. Then the composition
f ◦u: I →Y
is a continuous map connecting y1 and y2. The consequence follows from
Proposition 3.32.
□
Corollary 4.24. Any retract of a path-connected space is path-connected.
Proof. By Theorem 4.23 and Proposition 3.33.
□
Theorem 4.25. If each point of a connected space X has a path-connected
neighborhood, then X is path-connected.

4.2. Path-Connectedness
69
Proof. Let p ∈X with a path-connected neighborhood N. Let C be the
path-connected component of X containing p. Then
N ⊆C.
It follows that p is an interior point of C, and C is open. If X has two
path-connected components C1 and C2, then it is the union of at least two
nonempty open sets, contradicting its connectedness.
□
Corollary 4.26. For open sets of Euclidean spaces, path-connectedness is
equivalent to connectedness.
□
Example 4.27. Here are some examples for path-connected spaces.
(1) The image of a path.
Proof. Let
f : I →X
be a path. Let x, y ∈I. Consider the map
g: I →f(I)
t 7→(1 −t)f(x) + tf(y).
Then g is continuous. It follows that f(I) is path-connected.
□
(2) The Euclidean space Rn.
Hint. Let x, y ∈Rn. Consider the map
f : I →Rn
t 7→(1 −t)x + ty.
□
(3) The unit sphere Sn for n ≥1.
Proof. Let x, y ∈Sn. Let p ∈Sn such that
p ̸= x
and
p ̸= y.
By Theorem 3.25, there exists a homeomorphism
h: Sn \ {p} →Rn.
Since Rn is path-connected, there exists a path
γ : I →Rn
connecting h(x) and h(y). Then the map
f = h−1 ◦γ : I →Sn \ {p}
is continuous such that
f(0) = x
and
f(1) = y.
□

Chapter 4

Theorem 4.28. Let x, y, z ∈X. Let α be a path joining x with y, and β a
path joining y with z. Then the map
γ : I →X
t 7→
(
α(2t),
if 0 ≤t ≤1/2,
β(2t −1),
if 1/2 ≤t ≤1
is a path joining x with z.
Proof. The cover

[0, 1/2], [1/2, 1]
	
of I is ﬁnite and closed, thus it is fundamental by Theorem 2.13. Since α
and β are continuous, by Theorem 3.8, the map γ is continuous.
□
Deﬁnition 4.29. Let x, y, z ∈X. Let α be a path joining x to y, and β
a path joining y to z. The path γ deﬁned in Theorem 4.28 is called the
product of α and β, denoted αβ.
Corollary 4.30. The union of pairwise intersecting path-connected sets is
path-connected.
Proof. Let x ∈A, y ∈B, and z ∈A ∩B. Then there exists a path u
connecting x and z, and a path v connecting z and y. By Theorem 4.28,
the product uv is a path connecting x and y.
□
Corollary 4.31. Any two distinct path-connected components are disjoint.
□
Some properties of connectedness do not carry over to path-connectedness;
see Exercise 4.14. For the properties that carry over, proofs for the path-
connectedness are usually easier; see Exercise 4.15.

4.3) (a) No. For instance, take Ω1 to be indiscrete and take Ω2 to be dis-

(b) Yes.
Assume that (X, Ω1) is disconnected.
Then (X, Ω1) has a
nonempty proper clopen subset, say, A. Since

the set A is clopen in Ω2. Hence (X, Ω2) is disconnected.
4.4) (a) Any subset. Assume that A ⊆[0, ∞) is disconnected. By Theo-

f : A →S0.
Note that any open set in A consists of the elements of A that are
larger than some number M, and that any closed set in A consists of
the elements of A that are smaller than or equal to some number m.
Therefore, the clopen set f−1(1) in A has to be either the empty
set or the whole set A, contradicting that f is surjective.
(b) Any inﬁnite subset. On one hand, any non-singleton ﬁnite set A
is the union of two nonempty ﬁnite subsets. Note that a subset is

an inﬁnite set A is disconnected. By Theorem 4.4, there exists a
continuous surjection

where U and V are nonempty clopen sets in A. Since A∩B is a connected
subset of A, we infer that either
A ∩B ⊆U
or
A ∩B ⊆V.
Without loss of generality we suppose that
A ∩B ⊆U.
Since A ∪B is connected, in order to obtain a contradiction, it suﬃces
to show that V is clopen.
In fact, if both A and B are open (resp., closed), then both U and V
are open (resp., closed) by Proposition 2.8.
On the other hand, the
complement
V c = U ∪B

The condition of being open or closed is necessary. This can be seen

Chapter 5
Separation and
Countability Axioms
In this chapter, we consider natural restrictions on the topology of a space
that measures how far away the space is from a metrizable space.
The
restrictions are called Separation Axioms. As will be seen, metric spaces
satisfy all of the separation axioms. Topologists assigned the classes of spaces
satisfying diﬀerent axioms the names T1, T2, T3, and T4 spaces, respectively.
Later this system of numbering was extended to include T0, Te, Tπ, T5,
and T6. The idea was supposed to be that every Ti space is a special kind
of Tj space if i > j. But this is not necessarily true, as commonly accepted
deﬁnitions vary. For example, a T3 space may do not satisfy the T2 axiom.
In Section 5.1 we introduce topological spaces satisfying the Ti axiom for
each i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. We further study Hausdorﬀspaces in Section 5.2 and
regular and normal spaces in Section 5.3. We end this chapter by discussing
common countability axioms.
Let f, g: X →Y be maps between sets. The coincidence set of f
and g is the set
C(f, g) =

x ∈X : f(x) = g(x)
	
.
5.1. Axioms T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4
Deﬁnition 5.1. Two points p and q in a topological space are topologi-
cally indistinguishable if they have exactly the same neighborhoods, and
topologically distinguishable otherwise. Two sets in a topological space
are separated by neighborhoods if they have disjoint neighborhoods. A
separation axiom is a condition that a topological space may satisfy.

78
Chapter 5
Separation and Countability Axioms
The T0 axiom, also called the Kolmogorov axiom, is the condition
that each pair of distinct points is topologically distinguishable.
The T1
axiom, also called the Tikhonov9 axiom, is the condition that each one
of two distinct points has a neighborhood that does not contain the other
point. The T2 axiom, also called the Hausdorﬀaxiom, is the condition
that any two distinct points are separated by neighborhoods. The T3 axiom
is the condition that any singleton and any closed set that does not contain
the singleton are separated by neighborhoods. The T4 axiom is the condition
that any two disjoint closed sets are separated by neighborhoods.
A space satisfying the Ti axiom (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) is a Ti space.
A
T0-space is also called a Kolmogorov space. A T1 space is also called an
accessible space. A T2 space is also called a Hausdorﬀspace. A regular
space is a space satisfying both the T1 and T3 axioms. A normal space
is a space satisfying both the T1 and T4 axioms.10 We say that two sets A
and B in X are separated by a continuous function if there exists a
continuous function f : X →R such that
f(A) = {0}
and
f(B) = {1}.
The letter T in the terminologies of Ti axioms and Ti spaces originates
from the German word Trennungsaxiom, which means separation axiom.
Remark 5.2. Topological spaces deﬁned by Hausdorﬀin 1914 is equivalent
to a Hausdorﬀspace in Deﬁnition 5.1. People agree on the T0, T1, and T2 ax-
ioms. But diﬀerent authors use diﬀerent deﬁnitions for the other separation

Theorem 5.3 (Characterizations of T0-spaces). Let X be a topological
space. Then the following are equivalent.
• X is a Kolmogorov space.
• Any two diﬀerent points in X have diﬀerent closures.

• X is an accessible space.
• Every singleton in X is closed.
• Every ﬁnite set in X is closed.
• Every point is the intersection of all its neighborhoods.
Proof. By deﬁnition.

The last characterization in Theorem 5.4 can be compared with Theo-
rem 5.5.
Theorem 5.5 (A characterization of Hausdorﬀspaces). A topological space
is Hausdorﬀif and only if every point is the intersection of the closures of
all its neighborhoods.
Proof. Let X be a space with diﬀerent points x and y.
We show the
suﬃciency and necessity individually.
⇒. Since X is Hausdorﬀ, there exists a neighborhood Nw of w ∈{x, y} such
that
Nx ∩Ny = ∅.
It follows that
y /∈Nx.
Hence
(5.1)
y /∈

x∈N
N.
⇐. Due to the relation (5.1), there exists a neighborhood N of x such that
y /∈N.
Then the open set N
c is a neighborhood of y, without intersection with the
neighborhood N of x. This completes the proof.

See Theorem 7.9 for another characterization of Hausdorﬀspaces in
terms of product spaces.
Theorem 5.6. A topological space is regular if and only if it satisﬁes both

Theorem 5.7 reveals some relations between spaces satisfying diﬀerent
collections of separation axioms.

Chapter 5
Separation and Countability Axioms
Theorem 5.7. We have the following.
(1) Any normal space is regular.
(2) Any regular space is Hausdorﬀ.
(3) Any Hausdorﬀspace is accessible.
(4) Any accessible space is Kolmogorov.
Proof. By Theorems 5.3 to 5.6.
□
Example 5.8. Let A be a subset of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Let XA be the set of
topological spaces X such that X satisﬁes the Ti axiom if and only if i ∈A.
By Theorems 5.6 and 5.7, the set XA is empty for some sets A. Here are
examples of nonempty XA; see also Exercise 5.1.
(1) A = {0}: the coﬁnite space.
(2) A = {3, 4}: any indiscrete space with at least two points.
(3) A = {0, 4}: the Sierpi´nski space and the arrow.
(4) A = {0, 1, 2}: the space (R, ΩK).
Proof. The singleton {0} and the closed set K of unit fractions
are not separated by neighborhoods.
□
(5) A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}: any metric space.
Proof. Let A and B be disjoint closed sets in a metric space (X, d).
Consider the sets
U = {x ∈X : d(x, A) < d(x, B)}
and
V = {x ∈X : d(x, A) > d(x, B)}.
It is clear that
A ⊆U,
B ⊆V,
and
U ∩V = ∅.
By Proposition 3.4 (6), both U and V are open. Hence X is normal.
□
Here is a T3 space which is not Hausdorﬀ.
Space 11. The bug-eyed line is the topological space
 R ∪{0′}, ⟨ΩR, I⟩

,
where
I =

(a, b) ∪{0′} \ {0}: a < 0 < b
	
.

5.2. Hausdorﬀspaces
81
One may check that any closed set in the bug-eyed line is either of the
form Oc or of the form Oc ∪{0′}, where O ∈ΩR.
More examples can be found in Steen and Seebach’s book [37].
Theorem 5.9. The separation axioms Ti (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) are hereditary.
Proof. By deﬁnition.
□
The normality is closed-hereditary and is not hereditary; see Theo-
rems 5.16 to 5.18.
5.2. Hausdorﬀspaces
Recall from Deﬁnition 2.14 that a limit point of a set A in a topological
space is a point p ∈X such that
 A \ {p}

∩U ̸= ∅
for any neighborhood U of p.
Proposition 5.10. Any sequence in a Hausdorﬀspace has at most one
limit.
Proof. Let A = {an}n be a sequence in a Hausdorﬀspace X.
Assume
that A has distinct limits p1 and p2. Since X is Hausdorﬀ, there exists a
neighborhood Ui of pi (i = 1, 2) such that
(5.2)
U1 ∩U2 = ∅.
Since pi is a limit, there exists N such that an ∈Ui for n > N, contradicting
Eq. (5.2).
□
Theorem 5.11. Let f, g: X →Y be continuous maps, where Y is a Haus-
dorﬀspace. Then the coincidence set of f and g is closed.
Proof. We shall show that the complement of the coincidence set is open.
Let x ∈X \ C(f, g), i.e.,
f(x) ̸= g(x).
Since Y is Hausdorﬀ, there exists an open neighborhood U of f(x) and an
open neighborhood V of g(x) such that U ∩V = ∅. Let
W = f−1(U) ∩g−1(V ).
Then
x ∈W ⊆X.
Since f and g are continuous, we deduce that W is open. It suﬃces to show
that
W ⊆X \ C(f, g).

82
Chapter 5
Separation and Countability Axioms
Let y ∈W. Then
f(y) ∈U
and
g(y) ∈V.
It follows that
f(y) ̸= g(y).
This completes the proof.
□
Corollary 5.12. The set of ﬁxed points of a continuous map from a Haus-
dorﬀspace to itself is closed.
Hint. Consider the identity map together, and use Theorem 5.11.
□
Corollary 5.12 generalizes Corollary 3.12.
Corollary 5.13. Any retract of a Hausdorﬀspace is a closed Hausdorﬀ
space.
Proof. Let X be a Hausdorﬀspace with a retract A. Then there is a con-
tinuous map from X to itself whose ﬁxed-point set is A. By Corollary 5.12,
A is closed. By Proposition 3.35 and Theorem 5.9 A is Hausdorﬀ.
□
Corollary 5.14. Let
f, g: X →Y
be continuous maps, where Y is a Hausdorﬀspace. Suppose that X has an
everywhere dense set A such that fA = gA. Then
f = g.
Proof. Since fA = gA, we ﬁnd
A ⊆C(f, g).
By Theorem 5.11, we deduce that
X = A ⊆C(f, g).
Hence C(f, g) = X, i.e., f = g.
□
5.3. Regular spaces and normal spaces
Theorem 5.15. Let X be a topological space. We have the following.
• X satisﬁes the T3 axiom if and only if every neighborhood of every
point p ∈X contains the closure of a neighborhood of p.
• X satisﬁes the T4 axiom if and only if every neighborhood of every
closed set F ⊆X contains the closure of some neighborhood of F.

5.3. Regular spaces and normal spaces
83
Proof. We prove the equivalence for the T3 axiom.
⇒. Let W be a neighborhood of p. Then there exists an open set O such
that
p ∈O ⊆W.
Applying the T3 axiom to the point p and the closed set Oc, we obtain
disjoint open sets U and V such that
p ∈U
and
Oc ⊆V.
Since U ⊆V c and the set V c is closed, we can infer by Theorem 2.15 that
U ⊆V c.
In conclusion, we have
p ∈U ⊆U ⊆V c ⊆W.
⇐. Let F be a closed set and p ∈F c. Then the set F c is a neighborhood
of p. From premise, there exists an open set U such that
p ∈U ⊆U ⊆F c.
Then the open set
 U
c is a neighborhood of F which is disjoint with the
neighborhood U of p. This proves the equivalence for the T3 axiom.
Replacing the point p in the above proof by a closed set gives a proof
for the desired equivalence for the T4 axiom.
□
Theorem 5.16. The normality of spaces is closed-hereditary.
In other
words, every closed subspace of a normal space is normal.
Proof. Let X be a normal space with a closed subspace F. Let A and B
be closed sets in F. By Proposition 2.8, the sets A and B are closed in X.
Since X is normal, there exists a neighborhood U of A and a neighborhood V
of B such that
U ∩V = ∅.
Then A and B have disjoint neighborhoods U ∩F and V ∩F.
□
The Moore space introduced below is an example of regular spaces which
are not normal, as well as an example of closed-hereditary spaces which are
not hereditary; see Theorems 5.17 and 5.18.
Space 12. Let H denote the upper half plane. Then
H = H ∪R
is the closed upper half plane. The Moore space is the space H with the
topology generated by the base
β = ΩH ∪

B′(x, y) ∪{(x, 0)}: x ∈R, y > 0
	
,

84
Chapter 5

where ΩH is the subspace topology of H induced from the standard topology
of R2, and
B′(x, y) = B
 (x, y), y

is the open ball centered at the point (x, y) with radius y; see Fig. 5.1.
Fig. 5.1. An open set in the Moore space.
Theorem 5.17. The Moore space is regular but not normal.
Proof. By Theorem 5.4, the Moore space is accessible since every point is
the intersection of all its neighborhoods. By Theorem 5.15, the Moore space
satisﬁes the T3 axiom since

B′(x, y/2) ∪(x, 0)
	
⊂D′(x, y) = B′(x, y) ∪{(x, 0)},
where D′(x, y) is the disk centered at the point (x, y) with radius y. This
proves that the Moore space is regular. Below we shall show that it is not
normal.
From deﬁnition, the subspace topology of R induced from H is discrete.
It follows that any subset of R is closed in R. Since R is a closed subset of
H, we can infer by Proposition 2.8 that any subset of R is closed in H. In
particular, the sets Q and R \ Q are closed. In order to show that H is not
normal, it suﬃces to show that any neighborhood of R \ Q in H meets any
neighborhood of Q in H.
Let U be an open neighborhood of R \ Q. For each x ∈R \ Q, ﬁx a
number r(x) such that
B′ x, r(x)

⊆U.
Consider the set
Zn =

It is clear that
[

Zn = R \ Q.

Consider the standard topology on R. Note that
Q =

nk
n : k ∈Z
o
is the union of a countable number of nowhere dense sets. By Theorem 2.22,
there exists m such that the set Zm is not nowhere dense in R. By Theo-
rem 2.21, there exists a set O ∈ΩR such that
O′ ∩Zm ̸= ∅
for any open set
O′ ⊆O.
By Theorem 2.19, there exists an open interval J such that Zm is everywhere
dense in J. Let
q ∈J ∩Q.
For any open set V containing Q, there exists rq > 0 such that
B′(q, rq) ⊂V.
Since Zm is everywhere dense in J, there exists x ∈Zm ∩J such that
|x −q| < min(rq, 1/m).
Then
B′(x, 1/m) ⊆U
and
B′(x, 1/m) ∩B′(q, rq) ̸= ∅.
It follows that
U ∩V ̸= ∅.
This proves that H is not normal.
□
Theorem 5.18. The Moore space can be embedded in a normal space such
that the complement of the image of the embedding is a singleton.
Proof. Let
H∗= H ∪{x∗}.
Deﬁne the topology Ω∗on H∗to be obtained from the topology Ωon H by
adding the sets of the form {x∗} ∪U, where U ∈Ωcontains all but a ﬁnite
number of points in R. One may verify that (H∗, Ω∗) is a normal space.
□
Urysohn characterized normal spaces as spaces in which any two disjoint
closed subsets can be separated by a continuous function; see Theorem 5.20.
Lemma 5.19. Let A and B be nonempty disjoint closed subsets of a normal
space X. Then there exists a collection {Or}r∈Λ of open subsets of X, where
Λ = {k/2n ∈I : k, n ∈Z},
such that
A ⊆O0,
B = Oc
1,
and
Op ⊆Oq,
∀p < q.

86
Chapter 5
Separation and Countability Axioms
Proof. By Theorem 5.15, A has an open neighborhood O0 such that
O0 ⊆O1.
Now let O0 play the role of A, the closed set O0 has an open neighborhood
O1/2 such that
O1/2 ⊆O1.
Along the same line, the set O0 has a neighborhood O1/4 such that
O1/4 ⊆O1/2,
and the set O1/2 has a neighborhood O3/4 such that
O3/4 ⊆O1.
Continuing in this way, one obtains a desired collection {Or}r∈Λ.

Theorem 5.20 (Urysohn’s lemma). Any two nonempty disjoint closed sub-
sets are separated by a continuous function.
Hint. Let A and B be nonempty disjoint closed subsets of a normal space X.
Keeping the notation in Lemma 5.19, we deﬁne
f(x) =

otherwise.
Then
f(A) = {0}

Theorem 5.21 (Tietze extension theorem). Let F be a closed subset of a
normal space X. Let
f : F →[−1, 1]

such that g|F = f.

0 (J+

Theorem 5.20, there exists a continuous function
g0 : X →K0
such that
g0(A−

and
g0(A+
0 ) = {1/3}.
By Theorem 3.6, the function
f1 = f0 −g0 : F →R

f1(F) ⊆I1.
Again, the sets
A−
1 = f−1
1 (J−

and
A+

are closed in X. By Theorem 5.20, there exists a continuous function
g1 : X →K1
such that
g1(A−
1 ) = {−2/9}
and
g1(A+
1 ) = {2/9}.
Then the function
f2 = f1 −g1 : F →R
is continuous and
f2(F) ⊆I2.
Continuing in this way, there exists a continuous function
gn : X →Kn
such that
gn(A−

5.4. Countability axioms
In this section, we study topological properties that are additionally imposed
on a topological structure in order to make the abstract situation under
consideration closer to special situations. The properties require something
to be countable. We consider three countability axioms.
Deﬁnition 5.22. Given a topological space (X, Ω). A neighborhood base
at a point p ∈X is a collection Σ of neighborhoods of p such that each neigh-
borhood of p contains a member of Σ. We say that X is ﬁrst-countable
or that X satisﬁes the ﬁrst axiom of countability if X has a countable
neighborhood base at each point. X is second-countable or that X sat-
isﬁes the second axiom of countability if Ωhas a countable base. X is
separable if it contains a countable dense subset.
Note that the separability is one of the three countability axioms to be
considered. From deﬁnition, it is clear that both the ﬁrst axiom of count-
ability and the second axiom of countability are hereditary.
Example 5.23. The arrow is second-countable. Any metric space is ﬁrst
countable.
Theorem 5.24. The second axiom of countability implies both the ﬁrst
countability and the separability.

5.4. Countability axioms
89
Proof. From deﬁnition, it is straightforward that the second countability
implies the ﬁrst countability. Let
β = {Bi}i∈N
be a countable base of a space X. Let pi ∈Bi. We claim that the set
A = {pi}i∈N
is dense. In fact, any open set O is the union of some members Bi. Suppose
that
Bj ⊆O.
Then
pj ∈O ∩A.
By Theorem 2.19, the set A is dense.
□
Theorem 5.25. Any separable and metrizable space is second-countable.
Proof. Let A be an everywhere dense set of a metric space X. By Theo-
rem 2.5, the collection
{B(x, r): x ∈A, r ∈Q+}
is a countable base of X.
□
Corollary 5.26. The Euclidean space Rn is second-countable.
Hint. The set Qn is countable and everywhere dense in Rn.
□
Theorem 5.27. Any continuous image of a separable space is separable.
As a consequence, the separability is a topological property.
Proof. By Theorem 3.9 and Proposition 3.32.
□
The separability is not hereditary; see Exercise 5.6.
Deﬁnition 5.28. A Lindel¨of space is a topological space in which every
open cover has a countable subcovering.
Theorem 5.29 (Lindel¨of’s lemma). Any second-countable space is Lindel¨of.
Proof. Let X be a second countable space, with a countable base β and an
open cover Γ. Let
Λ = {B ∈β : B ⊆Vi for some Vi ∈Γ}.
For each B ∈Λ, take a set Vi ∈Γ such that
Bi ⊆Vi.
Then the collection Λ is a cover of X, and the sequence {Vi}i∈N is a countable
subcovering of Γ.

Corollary 5.30. Each base of a second countable space contains a countable
sub-base.
Proof. Let X be a second countable space with a countable base β0 and a
base β. By Theorem 5.29, each set in β0 is the union of a countable number
of sets in β.

Chapter 6
Compactness
We know that a closed interval on the real line has the property that is
crucial to prove the maximum value theorem. It has been a long time that
people do not know how this property should be formulated for a general
topological space. The nowadays formulation is what we call compactness;
see Munkres [30, page 163].
6.1. Compact spaces
Alexandrov and Urysohn introduced the following deﬁnition of compactness
of a topological space in 1923.11
Deﬁnition 6.1. A topological space is compact if its every open cover has
a ﬁnite subcovering.
Compactness is a sort of topological counterpart for the property of
being ﬁnite in the context of set theory.
Theorem 6.2. Let X be a topological space. Then a set A ⊆X is compact
if and only if every open cover of A contains a ﬁnite subcovering.
Proof. ⇒. Let A be a compact subset of X. Let O be an open cover of A.
Then the collection
{O ∩A: O ∈O}
is an open cover of A, and has a ﬁnite cover, say,
{O ∩A: O ∈O′},

we do not follow.

⇐. Let O be an open cover of A. By the subspace topology, each member
in O can be written as O ∩A, where O is an open set of X. Let O′ be the
collection of these open sets O. From premise, there exists a ﬁnite subset O′′

A ⊆

Example 6.3. Let (X, Ω) be a topological space. If the topology Ωis ﬁnite,
then X is compact. In particular, every ﬁnite space is compact, and every
indiscrete space is compact.
Theorem 6.4. The n-cube
In = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈Rn : xi ∈I}
is compact, where I = [0, 1].
Proof. We shall show it for n = 1. Let O be an open cover of I. Assume
that I is not compact. Then the interval
I0 = I
has no ﬁnite subcoverings of O. Let
I1 ∈

[0, 1/2], [1/2, 1]
	
be an interval that has no ﬁnite subcoverings of O. Then we bisect I1 and
let I2 be one of the two resulting subintervals that does not have a ﬁnite
subcovering of O. Continuing in this way, we obtain a sequence {Im}m∈N of
nested closed intervals, none of which has a ﬁnite subcoverings of O, where
I0 = I.
It is clear that the intersection

is a singleton. Let O be the set in O which covers the singleton. Then the
set O covers all but a ﬁnite number of the intervals Im, contradicting the
choice of the intervals Im. This proves that the interval I is compact.
For n ≥2, the compactness of the cube In can be shown by subdividing
the subcube In
m into 2n smaller ones in the above proof.

only if any of its every countable open cover contains a ﬁnite subcovering.
Proof. Immediate from Theorem 5.29.
□
A collection of subsets of a set is said to have the ﬁnite intersection
property if each ﬁnite sub-collection has a nonempty intersection.
Lemma 6.10. A collection Σ of subsets of a set X has the ﬁnite intersec-
tion property if and only if there is no ﬁnite subset Σ′ of Σ such that the

Theorem 6.11. A topological space is compact if and only if every collection
of its closed subsets with the ﬁnite intersection property has a nonempty
intersection.
Proof. Let X be a topological space.

Chapter 6
Compactness
⇒. Suppose that X is compact. Let F be a collection of closed subsets of X
with the ﬁnite intersection property. If
\
F∈F
F = ∅,
then the collection
{F c : F ∈F}
is an open cover of X, and it has a ﬁnite subcovering, say,
{F c : F ∈F′},
where F′ is a ﬁnite subset of F. In other words, we have
[
F∈F′
F c = X.
Applying de Morgan’s law, we obtain
\
F∈F′
F = ∅,
contradicting the ﬁnite intersection property.
⇐. Assume that X is not compact. Then there exists an open cover O of X
which does not contain a ﬁnite subcovering. By Lemma 6.10, the collection
{Oc : O ∈O}
of closed sets has the ﬁnite intersection property. From premise, we have
\
O∈O
Oc ̸= ∅.
Applying de Morgan’s law, we obtain
[
O∈O
O ̸= X,
contradicting the assumption that O is a cover of X.

Hint. Let p be a point of the subset. Then the open cover

Lemma 6.13. Let A be a compact subset of a Hausdorﬀspace X, and let
b ∈Ac. Then there exist disjoint open sets U and V of X such that
A ⊆U
and
b ∈V.
Proof. For any a ∈A, since X is Hausdorﬀ, there exists an open neighbor-
hood Ua of a and an open neighborhood Va of b such that
Ua ∩Va = ∅.
Since A is compact, the open cover
[
a∈A
Ua
of A contains a ﬁnite subcovering, say,
{Ua : a ∈A′},
where A′ is a ﬁnite subset of A. Then the sets
U =
[
a∈A′
Ua
and
V =
\
a∈A′
Va
are qualiﬁed as desired.
□
Theorem 6.14. Any compact subset of a Hausdorﬀspace is closed.
Proof. Let A be a compact subset of a Hausdorﬀspace X. By Lemma 6.13,
every point b ∈Ac is an interior point. Hence the set A is closed.
□
Corollary 6.15. The intersection of any family of compact subsets of a
Hausdorﬀspace is compact.
Proof. Let X be a Hausdorﬀspace with a collection
{Kλ : λ ∈Λ}
of compact subsets. By Theorem 6.14, every set Kλ is closed. Thus the
intersection
J =
\
λ∈Λ
Kλ
is closed. Let o ∈Λ. Now J is a closed subset of the compact set Ko. By
Theorem 6.6, J is compact.
□
The Hausdorﬀaxiom in Corollary 6.15 is necessary; see Exercise 6.4.
Theorem 6.16. Any compact Hausdorﬀspace is normal.

98
Chapter 6
Compactness
Proof. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀspace with disjoint closed sets A
and B. By Theorem 6.6, both sets A and B are compact. Since A is compact,
by Lemma 6.13, for any b ∈B, there exists an open neighborhood Ub of A
and an open neighborhood Vb of b such that
Ub ∩Vb = ∅.
Since B is compact, the open cover
[
b∈B
Vb
of B has a ﬁnite subcovering, say,
{Vb : b ∈B′},
where B′ is a ﬁnite subset of B. Let
U =
\
b∈B′
Ub
and
V =
[
b∈B′
Vb.
Then both sets U and V are open,
A ⊆U,
B ⊆V,
and
U ∩V = ∅.
This proves the normality of X.
□
Theorem 6.17. Let X be a Hausdorﬀspace, let
{Kλ : λ ∈Λ}
be a family of its compact subsets, and let U be an open set containing the
intersection
\
λ∈Λ
Kλ.
Then there exists a ﬁnite subset Λ′ of Λ such that
\
λ∈Λ′
Kλ ⊆U.
Proof. Let λ0 ∈Λ. Let
J =
\
λ∈Λ
Kλ.
By Theorem 6.6, the closed set Kλ0 \ U is compact. On the other hand,
applying de Morgan’s law, we infer that
Kλ0 \ U ⊆Uc ⊆Jc =
[
λ∈Λ
Kc
λ.
It follows that the open cover
{Kc
λ : λ ∈Λ}

6.2. Interaction of compactness with other topological properties
99
of the set Kλ0 \ U has a ﬁnite subcovering, say,
{Kc
λ : λ ∈Λ′},
where Λ′ is a ﬁnite subset of Λ. Hence
\
λ∈Λ′
Kλ ⊆U.
□
Corollary 6.18. Let {Kn}n∈N be a decreasing sequence of nonempty com-
pact connected sets in a Hausdorﬀspace. Then the intersection
\
n∈N
Kn
is nonempty and connected.
Proof. By Theorem 6.6, every set Kn is a closed subset of the compact
set K1. It is clear that the collection {Kn} satisﬁes the ﬁnite intersection
property. By Theorem 6.11, the intersection
J =
\
n≥1
Kn
is nonempty. Assume to the contrary that J is disconnected. Then
J = F1 ⊔F2
for some closed sets F1 and F2. By Theorem 6.16, the set K1 is normal.
Therefore, there exists an open neighborhood Ui of Fi (i = 1, 2) such that
U1 ∩U2 = ∅.
Let
U = U1 ∪U2.
Now we have J ⊆U.
By Theorem 6.17, there exists a ﬁnite subset A ⊂N such that
\
n∈A
Kn ⊆U,
that is,
Km ⊆U,
where
m = max A.
Therefore, the set Km is the disjoint union of open sets
U1 ∩Km
and
U2 ∩Km.
If
U1 ∩Km = ∅,

100
Chapter 6
Compactness
then
F1 ⊆J ⊆Km ⊆U2,
a contradiction. Hence
U1 ∩Km = ∅.
For the same reason, we can show that
U2 ∩Km = ∅.
This contradicts the connectedness of Km and completes the proof.
□
Theorem 6.19. A subset of Rn is compact if and only if it is closed and
bounded.
Proof. Let A ⊆Rn.
⇒. Suppose that A is compact. Since Rn is a metric space, by Theorem 6.12,
the set A is bounded. Since Rn is Hausdorﬀ, by Theorem 6.14, A is closed.
⇐. Suppose that A is closed and bounded. Then there exists a cube Jn
containing A. From Example 6.3, we see that any cube is compact. By
Theorem 6.6, the set A is compact.
□
Theorem 6.20. A continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorﬀ
space is closed.
Proof. Let F be a closed set in a compact space X. Let
f : X →Y
be a continuous map, where Y is Hausdorﬀ. By Theorem 6.6, the set F is
compact. By Theorem 6.7, the image f(F) is compact. By Theorem 6.14,
the set f(F) is closed.
□
Theorem 6.21. Any continuous bijection from a compact space to a Haus-
dorﬀspace is a homeomorphism.
Proof. Direct from combining Proposition 3.17 and Theorem 6.20.
□
Corollary 6.22. Any continuous injection from a compact space to a Haus-
dorﬀspace is an embedding.
Proof. Use Theorem 6.21.
□
Corollary 6.23. A continuous real-valued function on a compact space is
bounded and attains its maximal and minimal values.
□
Corollary 6.24. Let A ⊆Rn.
Then A is compact if and only if each
continuous real-valued function on A is bounded.

6.2. Interaction of compactness with other topological properties
101
Proof. ⇒. By Corollary 6.23.
⇐. By Theorem 6.19, it suﬃces to show that A is bounded and closed. In
fact, by Proposition 3.4 (7), the function d(0, x) is continuous. Since it is
bounded from premise, the set A is bounded. On the other hand, assume
that A is not closed. Then there exists a point
x0 ∈A \ A.
It follows that the continuous function
1
d(x0, x)
is unbounded, a contradiction.
□
Theorem 6.25. In any metric space, a compact subset and a closed subset
have zero distance if and only if they meet.
Proof. Let (X, d) be a metric space with a compact subset A and a closed
subset F such that
A ∩F = ∅.
By Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 6.23, the continuous function dF (x) attains
its minimum, say, m. In other words, there exists x ∈A such that
dF (x) = m.
Note that
m = d(A, F)
from deﬁnition of the distance between two subsets. It is clear that m ≥0.
When m = 0, we infer that x ∈F, contradicting
A ∩F = ∅.
Hence m > 0.
□
Theorem 6.26 will be applied several times in the sequel.
Theorem 6.26 (Lebesgue’s number lemma). Let (X, d) be a compact metric
space with an open cover F. Then there exists δ > 0 such that any subset
of X of diameter less than δ is contained in some member of F.
Proof. If X ∈F, then any δ > 0 is qualiﬁed. Below we can suppose that
X /∈F.
Let {A1, A2, . . . , An} be a ﬁnite subcovering of F. Then
Ac

f : X →R
x 7→1
n

X
i=1
d(x, Ac
i)
is continuous.
Since X is compact, by Corollary 6.23, the function f attains its mini-
mum, say, m. Let
δ = m
2 .
By Theorem 6.6, the set Ac
i is compact. By Theorem 6.25, we have
f(x) = 0
⇐⇒
d(x, Ac
i) = 0,
∀i
⇐⇒
x ∈
n\
i=1
Ac
i.
But {A1, A2, . . . , An} is a cover of X, there is no point
x ∈
n\
i=1
Ac
i.
In other words, the minimum δ is positive.
Let A ⊆X with diameter less than δ. Take a ∈A. Then
A ⊆Bδ(a).
Since
f(a) ≥2δ,
there exists 1 ≤i ≤n such that
d(a, Ac
i) ≥2δ.
It follows that
A ⊆Bδ(a) ⊆Ai.
□
6.3. Gromov-Hausdorﬀdistance
With the notion of compactness in hand, we can introduce the Gromov-
Hausdorﬀdistance, which measures how far two compact metric spaces are
away from being isometric. The Gromov-Hausdorﬀdistance was introduced
by David Edwards [24] in 1975 and it was later rediscovered and generalized
by Gromov in 1981.

6.3. Gromov-Hausdorﬀdistance
103
Deﬁnition 6.27. Let X and Y be topological spaces. A realization of the
pair (X, Y ) is a triple
(X′, Y ′, Z)
consisting of a topological space Z and its subsets X′ and Y ′ isometric to
X and Y , respectively. The Gromov-Hausdorﬀdistance
dGH(X, Y )
between X and Y is the inﬁmum of the numbers r for which there exist
realizations (X′, Y ′, Z) of the pair (X, Y ) with
dGH(X′, Y ′) ≤r.
Denote by M the set of all compact metric spaces considered up to an
isometry.
It is clear that every isometry is a homeomorphism.
Lemma 6.28. Any pair of metric spaces has a realization.
Proof. Let (X, dX) and (Y, dY ) be metric spaces. Deﬁne
Z = {(x, 1): x ∈X} ∪{(y, 2): y ∈Y }.
Take x0 ∈X and y0 ∈Y . Deﬁne a function
d: Z × Z →R≥0
by
d(a, b) =





dX(a, b),
if a, b ∈X;
dY (a, b),
if a, b ∈Y ;
dX(a, x0) + d(b, y0) + 1,
if a ∈X and b ∈Y .
It is routine to check that d is a metric.
□
Lemma 6.29. The distance function dGH restricted to the set of isometric
classes of compact metric spaces is a metric.
Hint. In the set of isometric classes of metric spaces, the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ
distance is symmetric and satisﬁes the triangle inequality. With the condi-
tion of compactness, or precisely speaking, the set of isometric classes of
compact metric spaces satisﬁes the following equivalence
dGH(X, Y ) = 0 ⇐⇒X = Y.
See Exercise 6.9.

The Gromov-Hausdorﬀspace is the metric space

“Creeping along” proof. Deﬁne
X = {x ∈[a, b]: [a, x] is covered by a ﬁnite subfamily of F}.
Let s be the supremum of X. Since the member of F containing s covers
a neighborhood of s, we infer that s ∈X and s = b.
“Subdivision” proof. Deﬁne Ik to be a half interval of Ik−1, which
cannot be covered by a ﬁnite subcover. Then the intersection T Ik is
a singleton, which can be seen by considering the sequence of the left
ends of intervals Ik and the sequence of the right ends. The singleton
is covered by some member S ∈F, which contains all the intervals Ik
from some k, a contradiction.

Chapter 7
Product Spaces and
Quotient Spaces
In this chapter, we introduce two new topological spaces from old, that is,
product spaces and quotient spaces.
Let
f : X →Y
be a map between sets. A ﬁber of f is a set of the form f−1(y) for some
y ∈Y . The notion of a preimage is a generalization of the concept of a ﬁber.
The f-saturation of a set A ⊆X is the set
f−1 f(A)

.
The set A is f-saturated if
A = f−1 f(A)

.
Note that any f-saturated set is of the form
f−1(B)
for some B ⊆Y .
7.1. Product spaces
In this section, we ﬁrst investigate topological properties which are satisﬁed
by all product spaces X × Y as long as it is satisﬁed by both X and Y ; see
Theorem 7.3. Then we consider how product spaces behave if one of the
factor spaces satisﬁes some properties.

108
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let (X, ΩX) and (Y, ΩY ) be topological spaces. An ele-
mentary open set of X × Y is a set U × V , where U ∈ΩX and V ∈ΩY .
An elementary neighborhood of a point p ∈X × Y is a subset of X × Y
containing an elementary open set U such that p ∈U. The product space
of X and Y is the pair (X × Y, Ω), where the product topology Ωis the
collection generated by elementary open sets. The maps
projX : X × Y →X
(x, y) 7→x
and
projY : X × Y →Y
(x, y) 7→y
are canonical projections. A ﬁber of the space X × Y is a ﬁber of one of
the projections projX and projY . A ﬁber of X × Y is a ﬁber of a canonical
projection, namely, a set of the form
{a} × Y
or
X × {b}.
A ﬁber {a} × Y is simply denoted as a × Y . A ﬁber X × {b} is simply
denoted as X × b.
For any subspaces A ⊆X and B ⊆Y , the product topology of the space
A × B coincides with the subspace topology induced from X × Y .
Lemma 7.2 shows that the closure and interior operators admit certain
distributivity; c.f. Proposition 2.16 (9).
Lemma 7.2. For any subspaces A ⊆X and B ⊆Y , we have
A × B = A × B
and
(A × B)◦= A◦× B◦.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 2.14.
□
Some properties are satisﬁed by any product space X × Y as long as it
is satisﬁed by both X and Y .
Theorem 7.3. We have the following results.
(1) The product of connected spaces is connected.
(2) The product of Hausdorﬀspaces is Hausdorﬀ.
(3) The product of regular spaces is regular.
(4) The product of separable spaces is separable.
(5) The product of second countable spaces is second countable.
(6) The product of path-connected spaces is path-connected.
(7) The product of compact spaces is compact.

7.1. Product spaces
109
Proof. (1) Let X and Y be connected spaces and let
pi = (xi, yi) ∈X × Y
for i = 1, 2. By using classical homeomorphisms, we infer that the ﬁbers
X × y2 and x1 × Y are connected. By Theorem 4.10, the set
W = (X × y2) ∪(x1 × Y )
is connected. Since pi ∈W for i = 1, 2, the product X × Y is connected.
(2) Let X and Y be Hausdorﬀspaces and let X and Y be connected spaces
and let
pi = (xi, yi) ∈X × Y.
for i = 1, 2. Suppose that the points p1 and p2 are distinct in X×Y . Without
loss of generality, we suppose that
x1 ̸= x2.
Since X is Hausdorﬀ, there exists an open neighborhood U of x1 and an
open neighborhood V of x2 such that
U ∩V = ∅.
Then the disjoint sets
U × Y
and
V × Y
are open neighborhoods of p1 and p2, respectively.
(3) Let X and Y be regular spaces. Let U × V be an elementary neighbor-
hood. Since X is regular, by Theorem 5.15, there exists an open neighbor-
hood S of x such that
S ⊆U.
For the same reason, there exists an open neighborhood T of y such that
T ⊆V.
It follows that the set
W = S × T
is an elementary neighborhood of p. By Lemma 7.2, we have
W = S × T ⊆U × V.
By Theorem 5.15, the space X × Y is regular.
(4) Let A and B be countable dense subsets of X and Y respectively. Then
A × B is countable and dense in X × Y .
(5) Let (X, Σ) and (Y, Γ) be spaces with bases U and V respectively. It
suﬃces to show that the set
{U × V : U ∈Σ, V ∈Γ}

110
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
is a base of X × Y . In fact, this because
[
α
Uα ×
[
β
Vβ =
[
α,β
(Uα × Vβ).
(6) Let X and Y be path-connected spaces and let
(xi, yi) ∈X × Y
for i = 0, 1. Let u be a path joining x0 and x1. Let v be a path joining y0
and y1. Then the map
f : I →X × Y
t 7→
 u(t), v(t)

is a path joining the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).
(7) Let X and Y be compact spaces. Let
{Uλ × Vλ : λ ∈Λ}
be the cover of X×Y consisting of elementary open sets. Since Y is compact,
each ﬁber x × Y has a ﬁnite subcovering

Ux
γ × V x
γ : γ ∈Λx
	
,
where Λx is a ﬁnite subset of Λ. Put
W x =
\
λ∈Λx
Ux
λ.
Since X is compact, the cover {W x : x ∈X} has a ﬁnite subcovering
{W x : x ∈X′},
where X′ is a ﬁnite subset of X. Then
{Ux
λ × V x
λ : x ∈X′, λ ∈Λx}
is a ﬁnite subcovering.
□
However, the product of normal spaces is not necessarily normal; see
Exercise 7.6.
For the purpose of giving Corollary 7.6 as a criterion for the continuity
of a map to a compact space, we consider canonical projections. It is clear
that any canonical projection is open. Though it is not closed in general,
we have Theorem 7.4.
Theorem 7.4. The projection
projX : X × Y →X
is closed if Y is compact.

7.1. Product spaces
111
Proof. Let F be a closed set in X × Y . Let
x ∈(projX F)c.
For any y ∈Y , the point (x, y) ∈F c has an open neighborhood Uy × Vy.
Since the ﬁber x × Y is compact, the open cover
{Uy × Vy : y ∈Y }
has a ﬁnite subcovering
{Uyi × Vyi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n}.
It is clear that the set
n\
i=1
Uyi
is an open neighborhood of x, and that it is disjoint with the image projX(F).
Hence projX(F) is closed.
□
Recall from Theorem 3.3 for several characterizations of continuous maps.
Below is yet another one in terms of projections.
Lemma 7.5. A map f : X →Y is continuous if and only if the projection
projX : Γf(X) →X
is a homeomorphism.
Proof. The projection projX is obviously a bijection. The inverse map
proj−1
X : X →Γf(X)
is continuous if and only if the map
g: X →X × Y
x 7→
 x, f(x)

is continuous. The latter is true because
g−1(U × V ) = U ∩f−1(V ).
Conversely, the map
f = projY ◦proj−1
X
is the composition of continuous maps.
□
Here is the criterion for the continuity of a map to a compact space.
Corollary 7.6. Let f : X →Y be a map from a topological space X to a
compact space Y . If the graph Γf(X) is closed, then f is continuous.

112
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
Proof. By Theorem 7.4, the projection
projX : X × Y →X
is a closed map. Since the set Γf(X) is closed, the restriction
projX

Γf(X)
is a closed map. By Proposition 3.17, it is a homeomorphism. By Lemma 7.5,
the map f is continuous.
□
Deﬁnition 7.7. Let
g1 : X1 →Y1
and
g2 : X2 →Y2
be maps. The Cartesian product of g1 and g2 is the map
g1 × g2 : X1 × X2 →Y1 × Y2
(x1, x2) 7→
 g1(x1), g2(x2)

,
which is also called the direct product.
Similar to Cartesian product of spaces, the Cartesian product of maps
preserves some properties of maps.
Theorem 7.8. We have the following results.
(1) The Cartesian product of continuous maps is continuous.
(2) The Cartesian product of open maps is open.
Hint. The properties can be shown by using the following identities respec-
tively.
(g1 × g2)−1(B1 × B2) = g−1
1 (B1) × g−1
2 (B2),
(g1 × g2)(A1 × A2) = g1(A1) × g2(A2).
□
The notion of product spaces can be used to characterize the Hausdorﬀ
property; see also Theorem 5.5. The diagonal map on X is the map
∆: X →X × X
x 7→(x, x).
The diagonal of the product X × X is the set
∆(X) = {(x, x): x ∈X}.
Theorem 7.9. A space X is Hausdorﬀif and only if the diagonal ∆(X) is
closed in the product space X × X.

7.1. Product spaces
113
Proof. ⇒. Let
(x, y) ∈∆(X)c.
Then x ̸= y. Since X is Hausdorﬀ, there exists an open neighborhood U
of x and an open neighborhood V of y such that
U ∩V = ∅.
Then
(U × V ) ∩∆(X) = ∅.
This proves that ∆(X)c is open.
⇐. Let x and y be distinct points in X. Then
(x, y) ∈∆(X)c.
Since ∆(X) is closed, there exists an elementary neighborhood U × V of
(x, y) such that
U × V ⊆∆(X)c,
that is,
U ∩V = ∅.
This proves that X is Hausdorﬀ.
□
Corollary 7.10. Let
f : X →Y
be a continuous map, where Y is a Hausdorﬀspace. Then the graph Γf(X)
is closed in X × Y .
Proof. The map f × idY is a composition of continuous maps. By Theo-
rem 7.9, the diagonal ∆(Y ) is closed, and so is the graph
Γf(X) = (f × idY )−1 ∆(Y )

.
□
Cf. Theorem 5.11 and Corollary 7.6.
Deﬁnition 7.11. Let f : Z →X ×Y be a map between a topological space
and a product space. Each of the compositions
projX ◦f
and
projY ◦f
is called a component of f.
Theorem 7.12. Let
f : Z →X × Y
be a map between a topological space and a product space. Then f is contin-
uous if and only if each component of f is continuous.

Proof. ⇒. For W ∈{X, Y }, the map projW ◦f is a composition of contin-
uous maps and thus continuous.
⇐. Let A ∈ΩX and B ∈ΩY . Then the inverse
f−1(A × B) = (projX ◦f)−1(A) ∩(projY ◦f)−1(B)
is the intersection of two open sets and thus open.

Before ending this section, we introduce the deﬁnition of product topol-
ogy on the Cartesian product of an uncountable number of spaces.
Deﬁnition 7.14. Let
X =
 (Xλ, Ωλ): λ ∈Λ

be a collection of topological spaces. The Cartesian product of spaces
in X is the set
Q =
(
f : Λ →
[
λ∈Λ
Xλ
 f(λ) ∈Xλ, ∀λ ∈Λ
)
,
often denoted as
Y
λ∈Λ
Xλ.
The λth projection is the map
projλ : Q →Xλ
f 7→f(λ).
The product topology on Q is
ΩQ =

proj−1
λ (Ωλ) : λ ∈Λ

.
The product space of the collection X is the pair (Q, ΩQ).
The box
topology on Q is the collection
ΩB =
* Y
λ
Ωλ
+
.

7.2. Quotient spaces
115
The Cartesian product of spaces is also called the direct product. The
case
|Λ| = 2
in Deﬁnition 7.14 is compatible with the usual deﬁnition of Cartesian prod-
uct of two spaces.
The product topology can be deﬁned alternatively as that every member
in ΩQ is a union of sets of the form Q
λ Oλ, where Oλ ∈Ωλ and Oλ ̸= Xλ
for only ﬁnitely many λ.
The product topology makes the product space a categorical product
of its factors, whereas the box topology is too ﬁne; this is the sense in which
the product topology is a “natural topology”.
Tikhonov proved that the product of any collection of compact topo-
logical spaces is compact with respect to the product topology, which is
considered as one of the most important results in general topology in sev-
eral texts; see [44, page 120] for instance.
7.2. Quotient spaces
The idea of quotient exists ubiquitously in set theory, algebra, combinatorics
and topology.
Deﬁnition 7.15. Let
f : (X, Ω) →Y
be a map from a topological space to a set. The quotient topology on Y
generated by f is the collection
Ωf =

U ⊆Y : f−1(U) ∈Ω
	
.
Suppose that (Y, ΩY ) is a topological space. A map
q: (X, Ω) →(Y, ΩY )
is a quotient map if
(1) q is surjective, and
(2) ΩY = Ωq.
In this case, the space Y is the quotient space of X generated by q.
It is easy to check that the collection Ωf in Deﬁnition 7.15 is a topology
by Deﬁnition 2.1, and that any quotient map is continuous. Similar to The-
orem 7.3, some properties are satisﬁed by all quotient spaces of a topological
space X if it is satisﬁed by X itself.
Proposition 7.16. The following statements hold true.
(1) Any quotient space of a connected space is connected.

116
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
(2) Any quotient space of a path-connected space is path-connected.
(3) Any quotient space of a separable space is separable.
(4) Any quotient space of a compact space is compact.
Proof. Any quotient space is a continuous image of the ambient space. The
results follow from Theorems 4.5, 4.23, 5.27, and 6.7
□
We remark that a quotient space of a Hausdorﬀspace is not necessarily
Hausdorﬀ; see Exercise 7.11.
The importance of quotient maps can be seen from Theorem 7.17.
Theorem 7.17. Let X, Y, Z be topological spaces. Suppose that
q: X →Y
is a quotient map. Then a map
f : Y →Z
is continuous if and only if the composition
f ◦q: X →Z
is continuous.
X
Y
Z
q
f◦q
f
Proof. If f is continuous, then the composition f ◦q is continuous by Propo-
sition 3.4 (5). Conversely, suppose that U ⊆Z is open. Since the composi-
tion f ◦q is continuous, the preimage
q−1 f−1(U)

= (f ◦q)−1(U)
is open. In other words,
f−1(U) ∈Ωq.
Since q is a quotient map, Ωq = ΩY and the above relation becomes
f−1(U) ∈ΩY ,
that is, the set f−1(U) is open. This proves the continuity of f.
□
Propositions 7.18 to 7.21 are criteria for quotient maps.
Proposition 7.18. Let q: X →Y be a surjective map between topological
spaces. Then the following are equivalent.
• The map q is a quotient map.
• For any U ⊆Y ,
U
is open ⇐⇒q−1(U) is open.

7.2. Quotient spaces
117
• For any V ⊆Y ,
V is closed ⇐⇒q−1(V ) is closed.
Proof. By Deﬁnition 7.15.
□
Proposition 7.19. Let q: X →Y be a continuous surjective map between
topological spaces. Then the following are equivalent.
• The map q is a quotient map.
• The map q sends saturated open sets to open sets.
• The map q sends saturated closed sets to closed sets.
Proof. By Proposition 7.18; see Exercise 7.9.
□
Recall from Proposition 3.32 for the importance of continuous surjec-
tions. By Proposition 7.19, we can derive immediately that any continuous
surjection which is either open or closed is a quotient map.
Proposition 7.20. Let
f : X →Y
and
g: Y →X
be continuous maps between topological spaces such that
f ◦g = idY .
Then f is a quotient map.
Proof. Since f ◦g = idY , the map f is surjective. Let U ⊆Y such that
f−1(U) is open. Since g is continuous, the preimage
g−1 f−1(U)

is open. Since f ◦g = idY , we have
g−1 ◦f−1 = idY ,
and the set
U = g−1 f−1(U)

is open. By Proposition 7.18, the map f is a quotient map.
□
Proposition 7.21. Let q: X →Y be a quotient map between topological
spaces. Let A ⊆X be q-saturated. Consider the submap
f = q|A, q(A) : A →q(A).
(1) If the subset A is either open or closed, then f is a quotient map.
(2) If the map q is open or closed, then f is a quotient map.

118
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
Proof. By Proposition 3.4, the submap f is continuous.
(1) Let U ⊆A be an f-saturated open set. Since A is q-saturated, we can
derive that
q−1 f(U)

⊆q−1 f(A)

= q−1 q(A)

= A.
Since f is a submap and since U is f-saturated, we ﬁnd
q−1 f(U)

= f−1 f(U)

= U.
Now, since q is a quotient map and since U is open, we obtain that f(U)
is open. By Proposition 7.19, the map f is a quotient map. For the same
reason, f is a quotient map if A is closed.
(2) By Proposition 7.19, the submap f is a quotient map.
□
The concept of quotient maps is stronger than that of continuous maps
in the sense of Proposition 7.19, but weaker than that of a homeomorphism
in the sense of Theorem 7.22.
Theorem 7.22. Any bijective quotient map is a homeomorphism.
Proof. Let
q: X →Y
be a bijective quotient map. Let U ⊆X be open. Then
q−1 q(U)

= U ∈ΩX.
By Proposition 7.18, the set q(U) is open. Thus the map q is open. By
Proposition 3.17, q is a homeomorphism.
□
The partition of X with respect to f is the collection
Γf = {f−1(y): y ∈Y } \ {∅}
of nonempty ﬁbers.
The fact that any map f : X →Y determines the partition Γf of X
uniquely leads to the deﬁnition of a quotient space of X with respect to a
partition.
Deﬁnition 7.23. Let X be a set with a partition Γ. The canonical pro-
jection
projΓ : X →Γ
sends every point x ∈X to the member of Γ that contains x. Suppose that
(X, Ω) is a topological space. The quotient space of X with respect to Γ
is the pair (Γ, ΩΓ), where
ΩΓ = ΩprojΓ =

U ⊆Γ: proj−1
Γ (U) ∈Ω
	

7.2. Quotient spaces
119
is the quotient topology with respect to Γ. Let A ⊆X. The Γ-saturation
of A is the set
proj−1
Γ
 projΓ(A)

.
The set A is Γ-saturated if A coincides with its saturation. If all but one
member, say, γ, of the partition Γ are singletons, then the quotient space
(Γ, ΩΓ) is the contraction of γ to a point, denoted X/γ.
From now on, we can simply call a partition Γ of a topological space
a quotient space, with topological structure the quotient topology ΩΓ. In
particular, the set Γf of nonempty ﬁbers is a quotient space. From Deﬁni-
tion 7.15, we see that any canonical projection is a quotient map.
Example 7.24. Consider the partition Γ of the unit interval I that consists
of the intervals
[ 0, 1/3 ],
( 1/3, 2/3 ],
and
( 2/3, 1 ].
Then the quotient space Γ consists of three elements, written as
Γ =

[a], [b], [c]
	
,
where
proj−1([a]) = [ 0, 1/3 ],
proj−1([b]) = ( 1/3, 2/3 ],
and
proj−1([c]) = ( 2/3, 1 ].
Then
ΩΓ =
n
∅,

[c]
	
,

[b], [c]

.
The injective quotient of f is the map
g: Γf →Y
f−1(y) 7→y.
Note that it is possible that an injective quotient is not a quotient map,
since it might be not surjective.
Theorem 7.25. Let
q: X →Y
be a quotient map between topological spaces. Then Y ∼= Γq.
Proof. Since q is a quotient map, it is surjective. Thus the injective quotient
h: Γq →Y
q−1(y) 7→y

120
Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
is a bijection. Let
π: X →Γq
x 7→q−1 q(x)

be the canonical projection. Consider the commutative diagrams
X
Γq
Y
π
q
h
and
X
Y
Γq
q
π
h−1
Note that both the maps q and π are quotient maps. By Theorem 7.17,
both maps h and h−1 are continuous. Hence h is a homeomorphism.
□
Example 7.26. I/{0, 1} ∼= S1; see Fig. 7.1.
∼=
Fig. 7.1. The homeomorphism I/{0, 1} ∼= S1.
Proof. Consider the surjection
f : I →S1
x 7→e2πxi.
Any open set in S1 is the union of open arcs, where an open arc is the
intersection of an open ball and S1. The topology of the contraction
J = I/{0, 1}
is
ΩJ = {U ⊆J : proj−1(U) is the union of open intervals},
where proj: I →J is deﬁned by
proj(x) =
(
{0, 1},
if x ∈{0, 1};
{x},
otherwise.
It is easy to show that
ΩJ =
D
(a, b): 0 < a < b < 1
	
∪

[ 0, a) ∪(b, 1 ]: 0 < a < b < 1
	E

7.2. Quotient spaces
121
By Theorem 7.22, the map
g: J →S1
[x] 7→e2πxi
induced by f is a bijective quotient map, and thus a homeomorphism.
□
An accurate literal description of a partition can often be somewhat
cumbersome, but usually it can be shortened and made more understand-
able by ﬂexibly phrasing as pass to a quotient, attach, glue, identify, paste,
and so on. Let
h: A →B
be a homeomorphism between disjoint subspaces of a topological space X.
Identifying the pair of points (a, h(a)) for each point a ∈A, we denote the
resulting quotient space as
X/[a ∼h(a), ∀a ∈A],
or simply X/[a ∼h(a)] or X/h.
Deﬁnition 7.27. The cylinder is a topological space which is homeomor-
phic to the product space
S1 × I.
The torus is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the product
space
S1 × S1.
The M¨obius strip is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the
quotient space
I2/[(0, t) ∼(1, 1 −t)].
The Klein bottle is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the
quotient space
I2/[(t, 0) ∼(t, 1), (0, t) ∼(1, 1 −t)].
The projective plane is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the
space obtained from the disk D2 by identifying each boundary point with
its antipodal point.
The M¨obius strip is obtained by identifying the vertical sides of a square I2
in such a way that the directions shown on them by arrows are superimposed;
see Figs. 1.2 and 7.2.
Fig. 7.2. The left ﬁgure is a M¨obius strip; the right ﬁgure is a Klein bottle.

Chapter 7
Product Spaces and Quotient Spaces
Example 7.28. The following hold true.
(1) I2/[(0, t) ∼(1, t)] ∼= S1×I. Intuitively, identifying an opposite pair
of edges of a square produces a cylinder; see Fig. 7.3.
Fig. 7.3. A homeomorphism for cylinders.
(2) (S1 × I)/[(t, 0) ∼(t, 1)] ∼= S1 × S1. Intuitively, identifying the base
cycles of a cylinder gives a torus. For a proof, consider the product
map f × idI, where f is deﬁned in the proof of Example 7.26.
(3) I2/[(0, t) ∼(1, t), (t, 0) ∼(t, 1)] ∼= S1 × S1. Intuitively, identifying
the sides of a square according to the left part of Fig. 7.4 produces
a torus.
Fig. 7.4. A homeomorphism for tori.
Remark 7.29. Neither the Klein bottle nor the projective plane is embed-
dable in R3. Identifying a disk and a M¨obius strip via a homeomorphism
between their boundary circles results in a projective plane.
