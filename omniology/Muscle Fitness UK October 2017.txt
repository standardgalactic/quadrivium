F
FROM THE MOMENT  
I RETURNED from the 
2016 World’s Strongest 
Man to the moment I set 
off for the 2017 event, I 
gave 100%. I didn’t miss 
one training session, one 
meal, or one physical 
 therapy or cardio session. 
I didn’t miss a beat. I was 
basically obsessed.
I trained at my usual gym, Strength 
Asylum in Stoke, with my usual train-
ing partner Luke Fulbrook. We didn’t 
periodize or back off at any point. We 
just trained heavy all year.
The way I train hasn’t changed much 
over the years. I consistently train 
heavy but never one-rep max. I work 
at about 80 to 90% of my one-rep max 
for up to six reps. If I can do more than 
six reps I add more weight next time. 
I’ve followed this six-rep rule ever since 
I started training. If I feel good at a 
weight I might do more than six reps, 
but in general, you’ll never see me do 
more than six.
The only thing I changed was I 
cut down on assistance exercises for 
smaller muscles like biceps, calves, and 
abs. I just didn’t feel they were making 
any difference. I was putting too much 
energy and recovery into repairing 
those muscles when I needed to be 
focusing on the big, key muscles like 
quads and glutes that do the grunt of 
the work.
Some strongmen have separate days 
for gym and event training, but I find 
it more effective to combine the two. 
If you are going to train yoke you want 
to thrash your legs first to get them 
burned out. Not only are you warming 
up properly, you’re also simulating a 
competition scenario because it’s highly 
unlikely you will start an event fresh. 
Here’s how a typical week broke 
down. As you’ll see, it’s pretty basic—
it’s what I did out of the gym to recover 
that gave me an edge over my rivals. 
EDDIE HALL
MONDAY ////LEGS
I just did squats, leg press, and yoke. Simple. But to 
do those three exercises could take four hours, which 
may sound hard to believe but when you’re doing stupid 
heavy sets you need lots of rest. Remember, I could be 
squatting 350kg-plus so I needed a good 10 or 15 minutes 
to recover between sets. Doing three or four sets at that 
weight can easily take an hour when you’re resting that 
much. I did the same on leg press, working up to huge 
amounts of weight and having plenty of rest between 
sets. That could take another hour, then I’d spend an hour 
or so on the yoke.
TUESDAY ////CHEST
This day was about building my pressing 
power. There is always a pressing event at the 
World’s Strongest Man. Again, I kept it simple 
and had long rests between sets. I’d do flat 
bench and incline bench, then do triceps. I took 
it nice and easy, working up to a megaheavy 
weight on the presses and then just doing one 
set on triceps.

BUY EDDIE'S BOOK!
What does it take to be-
come the strongest man 
in the world?  The man 
who knows the answer 
is newly crowned Stron-
gest Man in the World, 
Eddie Hall, and now he 
reveals all in his autobi-
ography—STRONGMAN: 
My Story.  In the book, 
Eddie takes you inside 
the world of professional 
Strongman—the nutrition, 
the training and the com-
petitions themselves.  It’s 
the incredible story of a 
man on a path to being 
the best in the world.
 Everything about 
Eddie is huge.  He calls 
himself ‘The Beast’ 
and stands at 6ft 3in 
tall.   He weighs over 
30 stone and to make 
it through his hellish 
4-hour gym sessions, 
he has to eat a minimum 
of 10,000 calories a day.  
He puts himself under 
so much strain, his left 
eyeball once burst out 
of its socket!
 Eddie has been 
Britain’s Strongest Man 
for the last 4 years.  He’s 
broken world records in 
front of his hero, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, and in 
2016 he became the first 
man in history to deadlift 
500kg, which is the 
equivalent to an overfed 
racehorse.  And then in 
May 2017, he did it, he 
became the Strongest 
Man in the World.
 Is he superhuman?  
Eddie wouldn’t say so.  
He believes anything is 
possible if you put your 
mind to it:  “Be who you 
want to be.  Be a champi-
on” is his motto.
 In STRONGMAN he 
tells his remarkable story 
in his own words. 
 STRONGMAN: MY STORY 
by Eddie ‘The Beast’ Hall 
will be published by Vir-
gin Books on October 19.

WEDNESDAY  
//// FULL RECOVERY DAY
My idea of a recovery day is different for most people. I 
had something small to eat first thing, then did an hour’s 
cardio, which could be tyre flipping, sledge pushing, or 
boxing. Straight after that I’d have a regular exercise 
session, then I’d go home and eat until my personal 
trainer  arrived. I’d have a full English breakfast, cereal, 
beef jerky, yogurt…basically eat no end of food until he 
arrived at 10:30 a.m. for 1½ hours of intense exercise. I’d 
then eat dinner, which would be something like a huge 
steak or chicken pasta. Then I’d visit another therapist for 
shock wave therapy, which helps the muscles recover by 
breaking them down. I did this to treat any little injuries in 
areas such as shoulders and biceps. Then I’d eat again, 
something like chicken and rice, and have another 
1½ -hour exercise session in the afternoon doing full hip 
mobility and breaking down the glutes. I then stretched in 
the pool for 1½ hours and did a good 1½ hours of hot-cold 
treatments, which consisted of a sauna followed by an ice 
bath several times. Then I’d go home, eat, and go to bed. 
That was my day off! It was nonstop.

FRIDAY  
////SHOULDERS
I warmed up on dumbbell press-
es, working up to 30 to 40 reps 
using 60kg dumbbells just to get 
some blood into the shoulders. 
Then I went straight in to a log 
press and finished with some 
side delts. Two months before 
the World’s Strongest Man, 
I heard Viking press would 
be included in the events so I 
switched to that, but fortunately 
it requires a similar technique to 
log press. 
SATURDAY  
////FULL-RECOVERY 
DAY
I did the same as I did on 
Wednesdays. I also did personal 
appearances and media inter-
views on this day. 
SUNDAY  
//// LIGHT-RECOVERY 
DAY
I swam for an hour in the 
afternoon, then stretched for  
1½ hours followed by hot-cold 
treatments for another 1½ hours. 
I didn’t do any physical therapy 
on this day.
THURSDAY
//// BACK  
Again, I kept things 
simple. I did deadlifts 
first followed by two 
assistance exercises, 
such as lat pulldowns 
and a rowing exercise. 
With the weights I 
used that could eas-
ily take three or four 
hours, no problem.

four or five times a week 
plus additional sessions to 
treat any niggles. On aver-
age I was having six physical 
therapy sessions a week, 
which easily cost £200. 
Add the cost of this 
up over 52 weeks,

pricey. But phys-
ical therapy is 
crucial. I even 
took Richard

That’s how I lived for 
a year. I didn’t have any 
alcohol, holidays, or nights 
out with my wife or days out 
with the kids because they 
would tire me out too much. 
My family understood it 
was what I needed to do to 
be the best and left me to 
it. It was 100% dedication. 
Looking back, I don’t know 
how I did it. It was a mas-
sive obsession to become the 
World’s Strongest Man.

WHEY PROTEIN 
IMPROVES  
LEAN MASS  
WHEN CUTTING
Research in The Journal of 
Strength & Conditioning 
Research shows that taking 
whey protein before, during, 
and after your training can 
help you keep muscle when 
trying to drop fat. The study, 
of guys lifting four days per 
week for eight weeks, com-
pared whey with a carb sup-
plement and found that 
those taking the protein lost 
fat and gained lean mass. The 
carb group lost lean muscle.

Acute exercise, defined as a single session of physical

peared in the journal Brain Plasticity. Researchers 
discovered two main things: First, acute exercise 
boosted executive function, improved mood, and 
dropped stress levels. Two, it created widespread 
changes across the brain at the physiological and 
chemical levels. Translation? Keep hitting the gym;  
it’s good for your body and your mind.

HIT THE 
WEIGHTS TO CUT 
INFLAMMATION
If you want to keep 
inflammation in your 
body to a minimum, 
lifting weights—no 
matter how heavy—can 
increase the amount  
of some cytokines, or 
anti-inflammatory 
compounds, in the 
blood. These com-
pounds attack  
the free radicals  
that can trigger disease.

Applied Physiology)

THE NEW  
ANTIDEPRESSANT
Bouldering, a type of rock 
climbing done on rocky  
outcroppings close to the 
ground (7 metres high  
or less) with no ropes or  
harnesses, has been shown 
to help heal the mind  
and strengthen the body. 
Researchers looked at more 
than 100 people and found 
that the scores on tests for 
depression for those doing 
bouldering were significantly 
better. The difference was 
equal to moving from a diag-
nosis of moderate to mild 
depression. (University of 
Arizona and University  
of Erlangen in Germany)
Minutes of lifting weights needed per week  
to lower your risk of developing metabolic 
disease—a cluster of symptoms that up your 
risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes—
according to a study in the journal Mayo  
Clinic Proceedings.

BANDED HIP THRUST
H O W  T O  D O  I T
THRUST 
IN TIME
Use the banded hip 
thrust to improve 
your strength and 
range of motion
F
ew moves build lower-body 
strength and increase the 
force of your hip drive better 
than the hip thrust. That 
means adding this move 
into your routine can translate  
to stronger squats and deadlifts. 
And even if you already thrust 
like crazy (in the gym—get  
your head out of the gutter), 
simply changing the modes of 
resistance—like adding bands 
to the mix—can unleash new 
benefits. In this case, the payoff is 
improved range of motion and 
efficiency in the movement. Sure, 
heavy hip thrusts increase 
strength and size, but thrusting 
too much weight will lead to 
improper form, which can result 
in injury and lacklustre results in 
1
Grab a super band and loop 
each end around a dumb-
bell (the heavier the better). 
You can also loop it around 
either end of a power rack,  
with a bench set in the middle. 
The band should be taut.
 2
Once the band is set up,  
get under it so it’s at your 
belt line. Place your shoulder 
blades on a bench or plyo  
box, then thrust your hips off  
of the floor, driving through 
your heels. Be sure to hold the 
contraction at the top of the 
movement for one second.
R A I N
other compound lifts. 
Not only are bands easier on 
your body since you don’t have to 
load a barbell across your hips, but 
they also provide resistance 
throughout the whole motion, not 
just the top or bottom. This means 
that your body has to fight back for  
the entire duration of the move, 
which forces your body to react  
by keeping everything tight and  
in a straight line. This will not only 
optimize your range of motion but 
also bolster your efficiency at 
performing hip thrusts (after all, 
practise makes perfect).
So, master this movement for 
stronger hips and glutes, better 
lifts, and any other activity that 
includes thrusting. But we’ll let you 
figure that out on your own.

akin to needing £100 and taking 
out a loan from the bank, with the 
intent of paying it back later. After 
intense exercise, you need to pay 
back your oxygen “debt” so that 
your body can return to its base 
level of function.
WHY IT WORKS
Over the course of 72 hours, your 
body is working hard to replace the 
oxygen used, so your metabolic 
rate increases by about 5%. That 
equates to about 100 extra calories 
burned per day, for three days.
W
hen it comes to maximizing your training, the devil is in the 
details. Don’t get us wrong, knowing the basics—like exercise 
selection, sets and reps schemes, and how much weight to lift 
based on your goal—will take you pretty far. But understand-
ing how your body responds to exercise, and what certain 
responses can do, is how you take your fat loss to the next level. 
Enter: Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC). While  
EPOC is a biological function, not a tangible method, it shows how you 
can change your training methodology to elicit a stronger fat-burning 
response. Below, we outline exactly what EPOC is and how you can use  
it to torch extra calories for up to three days after a workout.
PAY YOUR DEBT
HOW IT WORKS
During bouts of intense exercise, 
like wind sprints or high-rep 
training, your body uses more 
readily available energy sources, 
like Adenosine Triphosphate 
(ATP), since oxygen takes longer 
for your body to process. This is 
WHAT IT IS
EPOC is a biological response 
following intense exercise, which 
returns your body to its baseline 
level of functions. These functions 
include heart rate, body tempera-
ture, muscle tissue quality, and 
glycogen levels.
EPOC It Up
Use these two protocols to 
elicit an EPOC response
R A I N
T
DIRECTIONS: Use this template for 
your main lift, like a squat or bench 
press. Then perform your normal 
accessory work.
DIRECTIONS: Hold the equivalent of 
your body weight, with either a trap 
bar or two dumbbells, and walk  
25 metres. Put the weight down and 
sprint back to your starting point. 
Then sprint back to where you 
dropped the weight, for a total of  
75 metres covered. That’s one set.

THE 
GREATEST 
STRETCH 
EVER
This one move will 
have you feeling  
loose in less than 
five minutes
S
tretching before you lift can 
help you avoid injuries that 
can leave you sidelined for 
weeks or even months. 
Unfortunately, many lifters 
come to this conclusion after it’s 
too late. 
   “Most guys neglect stretching 
until they get hurt,” says Brad 
Baldwin, C.S.C.S., a New York City– 
based personal trainer. “And  
then, all of a sudden it’s important 
to them.”
If “I don’t have time!” is your 
main excuse to skip a warmup, 
there’s good news: Spending 
20-plus minutes getting your 
muscles and joints loose isn’t 
necessary. However, using a few 
minutes to run through the 
World’s Greatest Stretch, a pigeon 
stretch, and inchworms can help 
you “cover all of your bases,” 
explains Baldwin. “The World’s 
Greatest Stretch is excellent for 
increasing your thoracic mobility 
and extending out your spine 
before compound movements. 
Specifically, it will open up your 
hips and stretch your psoas, a 
major muscle that starts in your 
quad and inserts into your low 
back, which can cause back 
tightness, so targeting this will 
help combat tightness.”

Hold for 20 seconds, 
then lower your

leg. Repeat on the 
other side.

LEAVING 
LINDA
One famous full-body 
WOD gets a muscle- 
building facelift
C
rossFitters have a nickname for 
the Linda workout: “three bars 
of death.” When you see the 
WOD on paper, it makes sense: 
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 reps for time 
on the deadlift (1½ times body 
weight), bench press (body weight), 
and power clean (¾ body weight).
For a 90-kg guy, that means 
136-kg deadlifts, 90-kg bench 
presses, and 68-kg cleans, 10 sets of 
each with as little rest as possible. 
Those last few sets of 3, 2, and 1 
reps would be easy if not for those 
seven gruelling sets before-
hand. The Linda WOD is a 
whole-body killer that 
demands power and 
strength in the face of 
fatigue—a combo 
more conducive to 
enhancing stamina 
and grit than promot-
ing mass gains.
Perhaps you’re more 
interested in packing on 
muscle than tackling Linda. 
We get it. That’s why we’re offering 
a hypertrophy-focused variant, 
designed by Robert Ciresi Jr., 
I.S.S.A. Ciresi’s version nixes the 
deadlifts and cleans in favour of 
barbell bentover rows and barbell 
curls. “This will keep the original 
formula of the workout,” he says, 
“which is a pull, push, pull. It will 
also train opposing muscle groups 
[back and chest via rows and 
bench presses], which is very 
powerful for muscle hypertrophy.”
Plus, with this exercise selec-
tion, the “three bars of death” 
theme is maintained. (Thank

goodness!) However, you have the 
freedom of using dumbbells on 
one or more of the exercises if 
you prefer. Just make sure the 
dumbbell rows are performed 
two arms at a time to keep the 
workout moving along.
Ciresi recommends performing 
this routine once a week for six 
weeks, increasing weight each 
time. “Add 1, 2.25, or 4.5 kilos to 
each lift every week,” he says, “and

here is hardly a core exercise 
more basic or notorious  
than the plank. And when  
performed “actively”— 
meaning you’re engaging 
every muscle you can, from head  
to toe—it neutralizes the spine and 
taxes your entire body. Which, 
according to Chris Frankel, head  
of performance at TRX, “brings 
awareness to alignment and  
posture with intention and 
strength.” Unfortunately, most  
people “passively plank,” which  
visually resembles a proper plank, 
but doesn’t feel like one, and does 
nothing to bolster core strength.  
So, check for any of the following 
blunders to make sure you’re  
getting all the benefits.

You shrug your 
shoulders.
Many lifters instinctively 
shrug their shoulders, 
which doesn’t look or feel right. 
To fix it, squeeze your shoulder 
blades together and pull your 
forearms toward your hips to 
maximize core engagement 
and proper positioning. 
4
You move 
your head.
Many amateur lifters 
tend to flex and 
hyperextend their 
neck, which screws up their 
positioning. Try to aim your 
gaze a few centimetres in front 
of your fingers to maintain a 
neutral head position, which 
will in turn help keep your hips 
and shoulders aligned.
Brace yourself 
(literally) for better 
movement by  
avoiding these  
plank mishaps

70% OF

RESTAURANTS
Recent research appearing  
in the journal Circulation 
showed that almost 71% of 
our sodium intake comes 
from food outside the home. 
Salt added to food cooked at 
home came in around 6%. 
The study, which looked at 
450 people of all ages and 
races in three U.S. regions 
over one year, also found 
that people get an average  
of 3,500mg of sodium a  
day, much higher than the

COFFEE ADDICTS 
STILL GET AN 
EXERCISE BOOST 
FROM CAFFEINE
Researchers took 40 experi-
enced cyclists and divided 
them into three groups 
based on daily caffeine  
consumption: One had 
about 60mg a day, another 
had 143mg, and the third had 
351mg (about three cups of 
coffee). After ingesting either 
600mg of caffeine, placebo, 
or control, they cycled as 
hard as possible for three 
time trials until they burned 
450 calories. The results 
showed that caffeine was a 
performance enhancer  
for all three groups. Most 
experts agree that the  
optimal dose of caffeine to 
help boost performance is 
300 to 900mg. (Journal of 
Applied Physiology)

MEAT THE CONTENDERS
Wings vs. ribs
 W
ings and ribs: two very 
different yet equally 
satisfying foods you’ll  
find on menus across the 
globe. And with access to 
a grocery store and some basic 
cooking skills, you can easily whip 
up both at home.
But which one (if either) can you 
reach for without undoing all that 
hard work you put in at the gym? 
Susan M. Kleiner, Ph.D., R.D., a 
high-performance nutritionist and 
the author of the best-selling book 
Power Eating, says that neither 
wings nor ribs is a great choice 
when health and fitness are your 
goals. But hey, sometimes you just 
want to eat them. When that’s the 
case, look at the nutrient break-
down. Both contain similar 
amounts of protein, but pork ribs 
have more fat, which translates to 
about 50% more calories.

It’s also important to consider 
what you eat with the wings or ribs. 
“If you add vegetables, especially 
raw vegetables, to your meal, you’ll 
fill up on fibre and eat fewer wings 
or ribs,” Kleiner says. This can 
benefit you more than simply 
choosing one over the other.
And pay attention to how the 
foods are prepared. Instead of 
frying the wings and slathering 
them with a sugary sauce, Kleiner 
recommends baking them and 
using a lighter, tomato-based sauce. 
For the ribs, try a savoury marinade, 
then bake, boil, or slow-cook them 
to remove extra fat.

USN’s Hardcore Series, this 
anabolic muscle builder is 
packed with every 
nutritional component 
necessary to fuel your body to 
build maximum mass. Any lifter 
worth his salt knows that there are 
three critical ingredients to 
promote muscle growth: protein, 
carbs and plenty of quality 
calories. Throw in a few anabolic 
nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, 
and minerals and you’ll get an 
even bigger bang for your buck. 
Fortunately, USN’s team have done 
all the hard work in assembling the 
perfect ingredient profile to satisfy 
these requirements.
For starters, Muscle Fuel Anabol-
ic boasts 55 grams of high-quality 
protein with a precisely formulated 
blend for fast uptake and extended 
amino acid release. This potent 
combination includes fast-digest-
ing whey protein concentrate, 
medium-digesting soya protein 
isolate and egg albumen, plus 
slow-digesting calcium caseinate 
and milk protein concentrate. Add 
to this a massive 77 grams of carbs 
from a high-quality proprietary 
blend (dubbed the Carbohydrate 
Matrix) and you’re getting a 
muscle-expanding 564 calories 
per 150 gram serving.
Equally impressive: This power-
ful all-in-one shake is also chock- 
ful of amino acids, including 8.5 
grams of BCAAs in a leucine-load-
ed 2:1:1 ratio, plus 8 grams of 
glutamine and 2 grams of arginine. 
It is also packed with 5 grams of 
performance-enhancing creatine, 
plus 1 gram each of beta-alanine 
(for attenuating fatigue and 
increasing time before exhaus-
tion), and HMB (to reduce catabolic 
muscle breakdown and further 
enhance recovery).
Finally, your body won’t work 
efficiently and correctly without 
the proper vitamins, minerals, and 
other bioreactive catalysts and 
coenzymes. Muscle Fuel Anabolic 
provides a wide variety of critical 
nutrients including a potent blend 
of 12 vitamins and 6 minerals. 
On the vitamin side, B6 boosts 
energy metabolism and protein 
synthesis, while B12 enhances the 
immune system. Vitamin E is a 
strong antioxidant to protect cells 
against oxidative stress, and C 
contributes to collagen production 
and cartilage function. Among the 
minerals, calcium is required for 
strong bones and proper muscle 
function, while zinc aids fatty acid 
metabolism, promotes healing and 
recovery, and supports testoster-
one production. Magnesium is 
important to boost nerve and 
muscle function, plus increase 
energy levels. In other words, 
pretty much every important 
muscle-building nutrient you need 
is part of this formula.
And lest you fear that supple-
menting with huge amounts of 
milk protein may cause stomach 
distress, Muscle Fuel Anabolic is 
exclusively fortified with Tolerase 
L, a pH-stable lactase created 
especially for anyone who’s 
lactose-intolerant. 
USN’s Muscle Fuel Anabolic is 
available in Chocolate, Strawberry, 
Vanilla, and Cookies & Cream 
flavours. For more information on

BENCH PRESS p 
Lie back on a bench set at a 30- to 
45-degree angle. Grasp the bar just out-
side shoulder width and pull it out of the 
rack. Lower the bar to the upper part of 
your chest, then press it back up.

On an incline bench, hold a dumbbell in 
each hand over your chest. Spread your 
arms apart and lower the dumbbells out 
to your sides. Squeeze your pecs as 
you bring the weights together again.
ABEL SAYS: “I am all about doing incline 
work on chest. I’ve always had a well-
developed chest, and I think that’s why. While 
my friends were going to the gym and seeing 
how much they could bench on a flat bench, I 
was doing incline. It engages your chest more 
than the flat bench—especially the upper 
chest, which is where most guys are lacking.”

ABEL SAYS: “This is the one muscle group I 
train in circuit form. But just like with any 
other muscle group, I lift as heavy as I can, 
using good form. So I’m going for 10 to 15 reps 
for each exercise. I don’t love doing ab work—
honestly, I hate it—but I work them all the time 
because I know I need to.”

Hang from a pullup 
bar with a wider-
than-shoulder-width 
grip. Brace your core 
and lift your legs up, 
keeping them straight 
throughout the dura-
tion of the movement. 
If that’s too difficult, 
start with your knees 
bent and work up to 
extending your legs.

CARDIO
To get the most bang for his buck, 
Abel opts for high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT) over steady-state 
cardio. His favourite: bike sprints. 
Here’s the workout: Get on a 
stationary bike and do 30 seconds 
of all-out sprinting—“Trying to kill 
yourself for those 30 seconds,”  
says Abel. Then rest for 90 seconds. 
Repeat for a total of 10 rounds. Do 
this twice per week.
“When you do HIIT, the calorie  
burn goes on afterward,” says Abel. 
“You might not be burning as many 
calories during the workout, but your 
metabolism is boosted the rest of 
the day. With HIIT cardio, you can 
maintain more of that hard-earned 
muscle mass.” 
Other good cardio activities: hill 
sprints, track sprints, and “deadmill” 
sprints (running on a turned-off 
treadmill at the highest incline). 
BARBELL CURL p 
Hold a barbell and curl the weight to 
your shoulders while keeping your 
upper arms at your sides. Hold the con-
traction at the top for a second, then 
slowly lower the bar to the bottom of 
the movement.
EZ-BAR SKULL 
CRUSHER u 
Lying on a bench, press an EZ-bar over 
your chest. Lower it toward your fore-
head, then drive it back to the top.
ABEL SAYS: “With arms, I make sure to do 
plenty of work on both the biceps and the 
triceps. And just like with all my muscle 
groups, I start with relatively heavy weight 
for the first few exercises. Later, I go a little 
lighter and do more reps to further deplete 
the muscle. But when you’re trying to build 
muscle, you want to lift as heavy as possible—
especially early on in the workout, when 
you’re fresh—while keeping good form.”

1
BARBELL  
CURL
Do only the top halves  
of reps, going from  
halfway to contraction. 
This is when the biceps 
are most activated. 
Performing  barbell curls 
seated (so each rep 
begins with the bar  
hitting your thighs)  
makes certain you do 
only upper-half reps.

 6
Rope Pushdown
At each contraction, separate 
the rope ends as far as pos-
sible with your palms facing down. 
This better targets the triceps 
lateral heads. It also makes you 
switch from a parallel grip through-
out much of the movement to a 
palms-down grip at contractions, 
effectively giving you two push-
downs in one. If you’re accustomed 
to doing rope pushdowns with a 
parallel grip throughout, you’ll likely 
need to lighten the weight to 
maximally separate the rope ends  
at contractions.

work your hamstrings and glutes. 
Alternate some backward elliptical 
work with forward work.
 5
Front Raise
Tense your glutes to lock your 
lower back and legs and prevent 
cheating. This is simply the most 
effective way to stay tight. Near the 
set’s end, you can progressively 
loosen the tension on your glutes to 
get more reps. This works with most 
standing exercises: dumbbell curls, 
side laterals, etc.
 8
Pushup
Push yourself entirely off the 
floor with each rep and then 
catch yourself and return immedi-
ately to the floor. Doing so adds 
explosiveness, which carries over 
to weighted exercises, too. And it’s 
a great way of adding a degree of 
difficulty to a simple exercise.
2
4
Preacher Curl
Use chains. Doing so adds 
resistance to the top half of the 
movement where it is otherwise 
lost as gravity’s pull lessens. 
Alternately, perform preacher curls 
on a machine with a vertical weight 
stack, which provides consistent 
resistance throughout each rep.
DEADLIFT
Pull the bar from power rack supports 
set at knee level or slightly lower. The 
greatest advantage of deadlifts, which 
is that they work a wide variety of 
 muscles, is also their greatest  dis- 
advantage if you’re doing them primari-
ly for your back. By starting each rep a 
little higher up, you’re working your 
lower-body less and your back more.
7 DUMBBELL CURL
Do these as fast as possible, 
alternating arms. Slow down as 
you approach failure. Increasing 
speed is a technique that can be 
applied to many exercises, but it’s 
especially effective with isolation 
lifts like dumbbell curls. This will 
better stimulate fast-twitch muscle 
fibres. Try preceding or following 
this quick exercise with a slow 
exercise, like preacher machine 
curls, to focus on slow-twitch 
fibres as well.
25 EXERCISE TWEAKS
9 CRUNCH
Hold your arms up as if 
reaching for the ceiling 
and slightly forward 
throughout each rep. 
Most people put their 
hands behind their 
heads, but crunches 
are already easy 
enough without tugging 
to help you get up. By 
reaching up, not only do 
you stop tugging, but 
you also use the weight 
of your arms as 
resistance. Hold up  
a resistance ball or a 
weight plate to make 
crunches even harder.

 10
Cardio
Alternate time on the tread-
mill or stationary bike with 
time on the StepMill, elliptical, or 
rowing machine. The StepMill 
should be low-intensity while the 
rowing machine should be 
high-intensity. Alternating intensity 
is superior for fat burning, and 
this has the added advantage of 
imparting variety throughout your 
cardio session to keep you alert 
and to stress different muscles. In 
an uncrowded gym, you can do a 
circuit, working your way through 
four or more unique machines, 
each used for only a few minutes 
at a time.
 13
Leg Curl
Throughout every set, flex 
your toes (as if standing on 
your tiptoes). This puts your calves 
in a weakened position by keeping 
them tensed and, in turn, forces 
your hamstrings to work harder.
 12
Calf Raise
Pause for four seconds at the 
top of every rep and contract 
your calves as hard as possible. 
Most people never give their lower 
legs—which are accustomed to 
low-intensity, high-rep work (like  
walking)—the stimulation they really 
need to grow.
SQUAT
At the bottom of each rep, sit briefly on 
a box or bench before rising. Unlike a 
standard squat, wherein you reverse 
your downward momentum to upward, 
you begin your ascent each time from 
a dead stop. This works your lower 
body in a different manner and may 
help you stay more upright, stressing 
your spinal erectors less. Box squats 
can also accustom you to hitting  
parallel or below on  regular squats.

 15
Lying Triceps  
Extension
Perform on an incline bench. 
Doing so allows the bar to clear 
your head for a full range of motion 
and prevents you from putting the 
“crush” in “skull crusher.”
 16
Pulldown 
Pull the bar down as fast as 
you can and then resist its 
ascent, taking five seconds. 
Altering pace can be applied to 
many exercises. With pulldowns, a 
training partner can easily apply 
extra pressure to the bar during 
the negative reps.
 17
Hack Squat
Keep your feet under your 
hips, as if squatting on the 
floor. Most people place their feet 
forward, which shortens the 
distance they need to bend to get 
their thighs parallel to the platform. 
This allows them to use more 
weight, but it also works their 
glutes and hamstrings more and 
their quadriceps less. To target 
your quads and put them through a 
greater range of motion, keep your 
feet under you.
 14
Dumbbell  
Shoulder Press
Instead of standard dumbbell 
presses, with your elbows flared 
out, perform Arnold presses to 
recruit all three heads of your 
deltoids. To do so, begin with your 
palms facing backward toward your 
face as you hold two dumbbells. 
Press them up and simultaneously 
rotate them outward, allowing  
your elbows to flare out, until your 
arms are fully extended in the top 
position. Slowly reverse the motion 
as you lower them back down to 
the starting position.
18
BENCH PRESS
Follow each full rep with a half rep, 
going only halfway up. The bottom 
halves of bench-press reps work 
the pecs more than the tops, so 
doing one-and-a-halves places a 
greater emphasis on the pecs but 
also allows you to stress your upper 
body through full ranges of motion. 
This technique can be applied to 
many moves, like squats and curls. 
 19
Upright Row
Hold dumbbells with your 
palms facing your sides, and 
raise your elbows as high as 
possible while keeping the weights 
at your sides. This better targets 
your medial deltoids than a barbell 
upright row. As an added bonus, it 
puts less strain on your wrists. The 
tendency, however, is to turn this 
into more of a shrug. Use a weight 
you can properly handle, resist 
bringing your traps too high too 
fast, and instead focus on raising 
your elbows up and out as you 
bend your arms.

23
OVERHEAD PRESS
Take an underhand or a neutral grip. Whether 
done with a barbell or a log-press bar or on a 
super squat machine, pressing with your elbows 
in front of your body instead of flared out to 
your sides better isolates your front deltoids.
O C T O B E R  2 0 1 7 / M U S C L E  &  F I T N E S S    6 1 
 24
Machine Crunch
Follow two fast reps with one 
slow rep. This forces you to 
stay focused instead of going 
through a set on autopilot, so it’s 
especially effective for short-
range, high-rep exercises like 
machine crunches.
 22
Leg Extension
Point your toes in, so that 
your shoes touch, to focus 
more on your outer quads. Point 
your toes out to target your inner 
quads. If you don’t have a 
preference, alternate a set with 
toes in with a set with toes out.
 21
Seated Wrist Curl
Let the bar roll down your 
palms and into the cradle of 
your fingers at the start of each 
rep and then curl it back up into 
your palm before curling your 
entire hand up. This strengthens 
your grip. Expanding the short 
wrist curl movement won’t rob 
much strength from the rest of the 
lift, so you should do at least some  
of your wrist curls with these 
additional “hand curls.”
25 EXERCISE TWEAKS
 25
Rear Lateral
Keep your arms straight. 
Technically, this is a reminder 
for proper form, but bending your 
arms will enable you to use more of 
your back to move the weight, 
taking the tension off your delts. 
With that said, you can bend your 
arms as the set progresses to eke 
out a few extra reps. 
20 LEG PRESS
Use one leg at a time. Going unilateral forces you to focus more on the muscles 
of each thigh, and you can get fuller ranges of motion. As an added bonus, you 
need to load only half as much weight.

HINK CAREFULLY 
about your biceps 
workouts. Do you tend  
to perform the same 
exercises over and over 
at every session—barbell 
curls, preacher curls, 
seated dumbbell curls, and so on? 
Now go ahead and flex your 
biceps. Are you satisfied with their 
current size and shape? If the 
answer is yes (which I doubt), 
then go ahead and flip to the 
next article. However, if 
your answer is no, then 
please keep reading, 
because it is my goal to 
greatly increase ticket 
sales to your “gun show.”
Personally, I am a huge 
advocate of variety when it 
comes to designing individual 
training programmes. If my 28 
years of experience as a competi-
tive bodybuilder and coach have 
taught me anything, it is that the 
human body is a profoundly 
adaptable machine—and because 
of this, we must continually 
present new challenges by 
switching up the stimuli we thrust 
upon it (that is, exercises, angles, 
tempos, and techniques).
While there are many effective 
ways to tweak your workouts with 
the goal of pushing past plateaus 
or staving off stagnation, the one 
we shall focus on in this article is 
introducing a few novel move-
ments. Of course, each of the 
exercises I will present are 
nothing more than variations of 
the basic curl. By simply changing 
the arc of pull, the angle of the 
torso, and the positioning  
of the elbows and shoulders, you 
can attack a unique set of motor 
unit pools (and muscle fibres). 
This, along with giving the central 
nervous system something new  
to deal with, can help take your 
biceps development—and arm 
measurements—to an entirely 
new level!

60-DEGREE-INCLINE  
PALMS-OUT DUMBBELL CURL 
TARGET: INNER BICEPS
HOW: Set an incline bench to 
about 60 degrees. Grab a pair of 
moderately weighted dumbbells 
(maybe only 50% of what you 
would use for normal dumbbell 
curls) and lean back on the bench. 
To get into position, you need to 
externally rotate the shoulders so 
that your palms are facing away 
from your torso. Just how far you 
can rotate will be a matter of 
personal shoulder flexibility, so I 
recommend that you warm up the 
delts a bit before hitting this 
movement. Keeping the chest high, 
shoulders back, and elbows locked 
in place, slowly curl the dumbbells 
O P P O S I T E  PAG E :  D U S T I N  S N I P E S .  T H I S  PAG E :  B R I A N  K U H L M A N N
to full contraction. Hold the squeeze 
for a moment, then lower carefully 
until the arms are straight and the 
biceps fully stretched. 
TIP: Getting the greatest stretch 
possible on this exercise is vital for 
activating powerful anabolic 
pathways that will trigger rapid 
muscle growth. To make sure your 
biceps get the intense stretch 
required, try raising your rib cage 
high and dropping your shoulders 
while allowing your arms to fully 
straighten at the conclusion of the 
eccentric rep.

PRONE INCLINE BARBELL CURL  
TARGET: BRACHIALIS, OVERALL BICEPS MASS
HOW: Grab a moderately loaded 
barbell (about 50% of what you 
would normally curl on a preacher 
bench), head over to an adjustable 
incline bench set to about 45 
degrees, and lie prone (chest 
against bench) with the shoulders 
positioned near the top of the 
incline. You can either rest your 
knees on the seat of the bench or 
straddle it with legs to the sides. 
Have someone hand you the barbell, 
and take a shoulder-width grip. 
Allow your arms to hang straight 
down to start, then begin slowly 
curling the barbell with movement 
only occurring at the elbow joint. Do 
not allow the elbows or shoulders 
to come forward at any point  
of the curling motion. After a hard 
contraction at the top, carefully 
lower back to the starting position.
TIP: This exercise can be made 
even more intense by keeping the 
wrists bent back while curling. By 
doing so, the forearm flexors are 
almost entirely removed from the 
movement.

HOW: Set an incline bench to 
about 60 degrees and place it 
directly in front of a low-cable 
pulley with a short straight bar 
attached. Take hold of the bar 
and lie back against the bench, 
making sure you are far enough 
away so that your arms can be 
fully extended. Keep your chest 
high, shoulders back, and elbows 
locked into your sides throughout 
every rep. Curl forcefully from 
the bottom, and when you get to 
the top, flex the biceps hard for  
1 to 2 seconds. Lower slowly  
and repeat with no bounce at  
the bottom of the rep. Strict  
form is a must.
TIP: To really light your biceps 
on fire, try performing as many 
quick, short, partial repetitions  
as possible after you reach 
“full-range” failure.

any shoulder or upper-arm move-
ment, strictly curl the bar toward 
the forehead. Make sure not to curl 
too explosively so as not to bang 
the bar against your head. Hold 
the peak contraction for 1 to 2

Just YouTube 
“calisthenics” and 
you’ll see what we 
mean. With a 
minimum amount 
of stationary 
equipment—a 
pullup bar and 
dipping bars—or 
no equipment  
at all, you can 
train your entire 
physique. So, 
when you can’t get 
to a gym, you 
have no excuse for 
not squeezing in  
a workout. 

CHEST
Dips focus on your lower pecs—be 
sure to lean into each rep to take 
tension off the triceps—while a 
standard pushup is the body-
weight version of a barbell bench 
press. But there are several 
variations you can perform: Elevate 
your legs on a bench to target your 
upper chest; place your hands on a 
bench for your lower pecs; and do 
them with a close grip for more 
triceps and inner-chest activation. 
THE BASICS
BICEPS
Go underhand on pullups or 
inverted rows (and set the bar 
higher so you’re more upright), and 
you’ll work the biceps more and 
your back less. You can also 
shorten your range of motion to 
keep the tension on your biceps.

BODY-WEIGHT  
TRAINING TIP SHEET
 When you can do 15 reps of a 
body-weight exercise, increase  
difficulty by reducing rest. 
 Boost intensity by doing  
supersets, trisets, or giant sets. 
 Use a training partner to add or  
reduce resistance.  
 Leg exercises usually require 
high reps and maximum ranges  
of motion.
BODY-WEIGHT  
BASICS
 Body-weight workouts can be 
done almost anywhere. 
 The easiest way to use virtually 
all your body weight as resistance 
is to pull or push while suspended, 
as with a pullup or dip. 
 Because choices are limited, 
you may need to focus on a single 
exercise for eight or more sets. 
 Change hand or foot placements.

PULL YOUR WEIGHT
TRICEPS
Stay upright on your dips and do 
your pushups with narrow hand 
placement to focus more on your 
triceps and less on your pecs. You 
can also do bench dips with your 
hands slightly behind you and your 
legs straight out in front of you, or 
elevated on another bench.
INVERTED 
ROW
Increase the 
difficulty of 
inverted rows by 
placing your feet 
on a bench or 
box. Decrease 
the difficulty by 
raising the height 
of the bar.

DIP
To better target your chest, lean 
forward to increase the stretch 
in your pecs. For more triceps 
activation, keep your torso straight.

degrees. Continually 
lunge until you  
reach the allotted 
rep count. 
PULL YOUR WEIGHT
DECLINE PUSHUP 
With your feet on a bench, assume a 
pushup position with your hands 
underneath your shoulders. Lower 
yourself and then drive back up.

SHOULDERS
Though extremely difficult to do, 
the handstand pushup is a suitable 
substitute for the barbell military 
press. Face away from a wall, 
with your heels against the wall. 
Get into an extended handstand 
position and then press yourself 
up and down. A regression of this 
is to prop your feet onto a bench 
in a pushup position and then walk 
your hands in so your body is 
making an L shape. From there, 
press yourself up and down. This 
is called a modified handstand 
press and will help you build up to 
the handstand pushup. 
ABDOMINALS
Many ab exercises—leg raises, 
planks, crunches—can be very 
productive with only your  
body weight.
WIDE-GRIP PULLUP
Hang from a pullup bar and 
squeeze your shoulder blades 
together. Then pull yourself up, 
leading with your elbows, until 
your chin is over the bar. 
THIGHS
Perform air squats, split squats 
(with your back foot elevated on a 
bench), assisted pistol squats 
(holding on to a suspension trainer), 
unassisted pistol squats, jump 
squats, and walking lunges. All of 
these should be done for high reps, 
in the 20 to 30 range. 
BACK
Like your chest, the back is an 
easy body part to hit without 
weights thanks to the almighty 
pullup. Pullups are great because 
they can be performed with a 
variety of grips: wide, moderate, 
close, overhand, and underhand. 
You can also vary the difficulty. 
For example, if you’re not strong 
enough to get more than a few, 
then you can use a band or an 
assisted pullup machine to help 
you bang out more reps. Con-
versely, if you’re a pullup deity 
who can rep out more than 15, 
you can hang weight from a dip 
belt or close your feet around a 
dumbbell to make them harder. 
The other key back exercise is the 
inverted row, which is essentially 
a pullup with your heels on the 
floor and body held flat. Set a 
Smith machine bar or a barbell in 
a power rack at slightly higher 
than arm’s length when you’re 
lying on the floor, and pull yourself 
up as if rowing upside down. 
CALVES
Stand barefoot on a flat floor, not 
holding on to anything to steady 
yourself, and rise up very slowly, 
squeeze hard, and hold each 
contraction. You can also do 
weightless calf raises unilaterally, 
raising and lowering yourself with 
only one calf at a time.

HIGH-LOW TRAINING
RESEARCH HAS PROVED THAT 
lifting within the eight- to 12-rep range 
is best for muscle growth, but it’s not the 
only way to grow. In fact, if you stick 
with it too long, your gains will likely 
stall. Translation: Don’t be too predict-
able. Besides, higher and lower reps have 
advantages, too. Higher reps maximize 
blood volumization and stamina. Lower 
reps are best for boosting strength.  
And both can generate growth. For  
this reason, the best strategy is likely  
a mixture of rep ranges. Alternating 
between high and low reps is going to 
throw out the middle, temporarily, and 
focus only on the high (15 to 30) and the 
low (four to seven). Let’s analyze the 
three distinct ways you can incorporate 
high-low in your routine.
HIGH-LOW  
BASICS
 High-rep sets are 15 to 
30 reps. Low-rep sets 
are four to seven reps. 
 Alternate high-rep 
and low-rep sets of the 
same exercise. 
 Or do all high-rep 
sets of one exercise 
and then all low-rep 
sets of the next 
exercise, seesawing 
throughout the workout. 
 Or do all high-rep 
sets one workout and 
all low-rep sets the 
next time you train that 
body part. Alternate for 
at least six workouts.
HIGH-LOW  
TIP SHEET
 It’s best to do high-low 
set sequences with  
exercises that allow  
you to easily change 
the resistance, like 
pulldowns. 
 On the other hand, 
heavy exercises like 
deadlifts or leg presses 
would likely involve too 
much plate loading 
between sets. 
 During a high-low 
cycle, avoid mid- 
range sets of eight  
to 12 reps. 
 High-low can  
effectively shock 
calves and abs, which 
are not usually worked 
with low reps.
Front Lat Pulldown 
As you row the bar down to your collarbone, arch your 
back and lean back a little. This increases the stretch of 
the muscle by increasing the distance that your arms 
have to travel to move the weight. 
O P E N E R  S P R E A D :  P E R  B E R N A L .  T H I S  S P R E A D  F R O M  L E F T :  P E R  B E R N A L  ( 2 ) ;  M A R I U S  B U G G E

O C T O B E R  2 0 1 7  /  M U S C L E  &  F I T N E S S    8 9 
THE FIRST WAY to incorpo-
rate high-low training is to 
alternate between all high reps 
one workout and all low reps 
the next time you train that 
body part. (Be sure to avoid 
midrange sets of eight to 12 
reps, as this defeats the 
purpose.) If you hit more than 
one body part per workout, 
you can also stress each with 
different rep ranges. For 
example, if you work chest 
before triceps, do all low reps 
for chest and nothing but high 
reps for triceps, then flip that 
script on your next chest/tri’s 
day. Utilizing high-low workout 
to workout lacks the benefit of 
“muscle confusion,” which you 
get via attacking your muscles 
with rep variety in the same 
session. However, it allows 
you to better focus on one 
range at a time.

T-bar Row
When performing T-bar 
rows, allow your elbows  
to flare out slightly. This 
lets you row the bar a  
little higher, which, given 
the fixed position of  
the implement, is more  
comfortable on your joints. 

9 0    M U S C L E  &  F I T N E S S  /  O C T O B E R  2 0 1 7
THIS IS THE MOST radical way 
to utilize high-low and the method 
that best distinguishes it from other 
workout styles: alternating high and 
low reps each set of the same 
exercise. This will have you see-
sawing back and forth from a 
pumping set to a power set. Be 
thoughtful of your exercising 
HIGH-LOW TRAINING
SET TO SET
pairings. For example, heavy free- 
weight exercises will have you 
changing plates from the bar every 
set, which is a pain compared with 
a cable pushdown machine that 
allows you to simply select weights 
with a pin. 
Another approach is to turn the 
set into a superset, alternating 
between a heavy move, like the 
bench press, and a lighter exercise, 
such as the dumbbell flye. This way, 
the lighter work complements and 
expands upon the heavier work. 
The potential downside of set-to-
set high-low training is that you’ll 
lose your focus. It’s easy to forget 
your immediate goal when you just 
did a light set and you’ve grabbed a 
much heavier weight. Rededicate 
yourself to the task at hand before 
each set, aiming for your rep target. 
(A logbook can help you hit your 
goals as well.)
The upside is that your muscles 
never quite know what’s coming. 
Will it be a few reps with a heavy 
weight or many reps with a light 
weight? Answer: It’s going to 
change every set. You’re going to 
pump up and power up as you 
attack your muscles with high and 
low combinations—again and again.
Low-cable Row 
Keep your torso rigid when doing low- 
cable rows, allowing your shoulders 
to slightly roll forward during the  
lowering phase. To initiate the lift, 
squeeze your shoulder blades  
together and then row the D-handle 
to your stomach.

HIGH-LOW  
BACK ROUTINE
ANOTHER WAY TO go high and 
low is to do all high-rep sets of 
one exercise and then perform all 
low-rep sets of the next exercise. 
Alternate that way throughout  
the workout, seesawing from 
pump-up to power-up. Plan  
your workout, so you go low on 
compound exercises that let you 
slide on the most plates (like 
bench presses and deadlifts) and 
high on isolation lifts, which don’t 
easily lend themselves to low 
reps. It’s usually best to start 
with a sequence of high-rep sets 
because this serves as a working 
warmup. However, you can go 
low first as long as it’s preceded 
by a sufficient warmup.

You could be forgiven for 
thinking so given the sea of 
smiling gym selfies that infest 
social media. But the deeper 
truth is that even the best can 
find the daily grind a little 
tedious at times. There is only 
so long that you can do chest on 
Monday, back on Tuesday, etc., 
and 45 minutes on the treadmill 
every morning  before enthusi-
asm wanes and progress stalls.
It happened to bikini  
fitness competitor Billie 
Whyatt when she was prepar-
ing for the UKBFF English 
Grand Prix a couple of years 
ago. “I got bored easily, so I 
started looking for ways to 
keep the excitement go-
ing,” she explains. “I knew I 
needed to vary my training, 
otherwise I wouldn’t see re-
sults,” she says.

replaced steady-state
cardio as her main tool for 
getting lean. The change paid 
off—Billie became the overall 
female champion at the grand 
prix and has since continued 
to refine her high intensity ap-
proach. “It is super-effective 
and fun,” she says.
Abandoning the traditional 
approach to getting lean was 
a big leap of faith for Billie, 
who was brought up in an old 
school bodybuilding environ-
ment. Her dad, Paul, founded 
Shapers gym in Wisbech, 
Cambridgeshire where cardio 
machines were the main  
fat-blasting tools. But Bil-
lie, who now divides her 
time between London and 
Cambridgeshire found HIIT 
worked better for her and now 
advocates it for others. 
She admits that she’s better 
suited to it than most. Being 
a mesomorph, she can build 
muscle easily, but getting lean 
can be difficult. “I hold a lot 
of muscle naturally and, if I 
continued to do mainly just 
weights, I would not fit the 
bikini criteria,” she says. 
Here, Billie gives an over-
view of her approach as well 
as seven days of the exact 
programme she follows in the 
run-up to her contests. Re-
member, she’s at the top of her 
game but the beauty of HIIT 
is you can adjust the intervals 
so allow longer for recovery if 
necessary and aim to shorten 
the gaps between exercises 
over time.

study found
that subjects who dieted and weight-
trained for 90 days lost an average 
of 16 kilos while gaining significant 
muscle mass. Don’t get too excited, 
as the subjects were obese women, 
but it proves that muscle gain isn’t 
dependent on big eating alone.
So what should you do? Start by 
eating 14 to 18 calories per half kilo 
of your body weight, and adjust 
from there. Consume one gram of 
protein per half kilo of your body 
weight daily, two grams of carbs, 
and 0.4 grams of fat. (For a visual 
breakdown, see the “Start-Up 
Formula for Bulking” sidebar on the 
next page.) In other words, an 82-kg 
man looking to gain weight would 
eat between 2,500 and 3,200 
calories daily, consisting of approxi-
mately 180 grams of protein, 360 
grams of carbs, and 70 grams of fat. 
To make adjustments, tweak your 
carbs and fat, but keep your protein 
intake constant. (See the “M&F-
Approved Bulking Foods” sidebar for 
a list of approved eats.) The most

important factor, however, is getting 
in the gym and training your ass off.
 “The key element to bulking is to 
focus on increasing strength,” Alvino 
says. Stronger muscles inevitably 
become bigger muscles, so while  
you can’t quickly eat your way to  
5 extra muscle kilos without storing 
a lot of fat, you can—eventually—
train your way there.

*NOTE: We’ve excluded grains and vegetables from this list. Grains such as oats and 
wheat contain compounds that make them difficult to digest for many people and can 
cause stomach upset and bloating. However, if you feel you do fine on these foods, 
you’re welcome to consume them in small doses, but make starches such as potatoes 
and rice your main carb sources.
Green vegetables, on the other hand, should be consumed liberally, but because of 
their very low caloric value, aren’t to be counted toward your daily calorie and 
macronutrient totals.
**Most of your fat intake should come as a by-product of your protein foods. For 
instance, egg yolks contain protein and fat, as do even the leanest cuts of beef. 
However, if you need extra fat to hit your allotment for the day, you can pick from this 
list of foods.
Timing Is Nothing
For the past decade, bodybuilding 
hype has stressed the importance of 
the so-called “pre- and post-workout 
windows.” The idea here is that 
ingesting protein and carbs up to an 
hour before weight training and 
within an hour after training will 
result in better absorption of these 
nutrients for superior muscle growth. 
Some product marketers and 
so-called nutrition experts have even 
threatened that your workout will be 
a complete waste if you don’t ingest 
protein and carbs at these times.
But the science to back this notion 
doesn’t exist. A 2013 meta-analysis 
published in the Journal of the 
International Society of Sports 
Nutrition found no significant 
benefit to rushing protein intake 
within one hour before or after 
training. In other words, as long as

INVENTOR:  
ARNOLD 
SCHWARZENEGGER
EXERCISE:  
Back in the day, legendary 
bodybuilder-turned-movie 
star-turned-governor, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger put a new 
twist (literally) on the dumb-
bell shoulder press. He claims 
his version recruits more 
shoulder muscle, and consid-
ering that Arnold won his first 
Mr. Olympia at age 20, who 
can argue?
HOW TO DO IT: Hold two 
dumbbells at your shoulders, 
palms facing you. Press and 
rotate your palms outward in 
one fluid motion. Reverse the 
motion on the eccentric.

J.M. BLAKELY
EXERCISE:  
J.M. PRESS
Powerlifter J.M. Blakely is 
known for gaining and then 
cutting 45.4 kg before com-
petition—he would go so far 
as to douse a large pizza in 
olive oil, in addition to scarf-
ing down 10 to 15 Hershey 
bars. Don’t do this. If you’re 
looking to push past your 
bench-press plateau, then 
definitely try his signature 
move, the J.M. Press—a 
close-grip bench press, skull 
crusher hybrid that has 
helped many big-time 
benchers increase their 
kilos. It strengthens your tri-
ceps by overloading them 
with more weight than you 
could normally lift with 
moves like the skull crusher. 
HOW TO DO IT: Set up on a 
bench press with a close 
grip. Lower the bar and, 
when you start to feel the 
tension in your triceps shift 
to your chest, bring the bar 
back toward your skull. The 
bar path should resemble 
a capital L. Contract the 
triceps hard and reverse  
the bar back to the starting 
position.

JOHN MEADOWS
EXERCISE:
MEADOWS ROW 
John “the Mountain Dog” Meadows is a 
bodybuilder—famous for his grainy con-
ditioning and muscle-numbing workouts 
and a coach who has prepped a pletho-
ra of musclemen, like IFBB pros Mark 
Dugdale and Amit Sapir, for the stage. 
The reason he’s sought out is he’s  
an innovator in the gym, using various 
implements and angles to try and recruit 
every last muscle fibre he can. And out 
of that experimentation came the 
Meadows Row, his namesake exercise 
that is now known among lifters as a 
notorious upper-back blaster with a 
long range of motion that recruits 
maximum muscle.
HOW TO DO IT: Prop a bar in a corner 
or use a landmine attachment. Stand 
perpendicular to the bar and grip the 
end with the hand closest to the bar. 
Then, pull your shoulder blades back 
and row the bar to your rib cage, 
holding at the top for a two count.

Turn-of-the-century strongman George 
Zottman was quite a character. He had

with a seated one-arm clean and press 
of 79 kg—a mark that has yet to be bro-
ken. But his greatest claim to fame is 
undoubtedly the  Zottman Curl, which he 
did regularly to build his beastly grip 
strength. You might want to try it from 
time to time, too.
HOW TO DO IT: Curl the dumbbells up

ahead of his time in nutrition and train-
ing methods, and his spin on the chinup, 
which increases the range of motion, is 
still practised today. 
HOW TO DO IT: Hang from the bar 
with a normal chinup grip. Start the 
movement like in a regular chinup and 
pull yourself up toward the bar. Halfway 
through the movement, lean back and 
contract your lats hard to bring your 
lower chest or sternum to the bar.

Leaning back

pullup, a  vertical pull, 
into a  horizontal pull, 
which recruits  
more muscle in

 An apple a day is one of nature’s 
best prescriptions and a perfect 
example of synergy within a single 
food. They’re a great source of 
polyphenols, vitamin C, fibre, and 
potassium. Numerous studies have 
linked eating apples with a reduced 
risk of some cancers, cardiovascu-
lar disease, asthma, and diabetes.
Researchers at Cornell University 
found that eating apple slush  
with skin worked five times better 
to prevent the oxidation of free 
radicals than apple slush alone. 
“The phenolic phytochemicals  
in apple peel account for the 
majority of the antioxidant and 
antiproliferating activity in apples,” 
says Elaine Magee, R.D., the author 
of Food Synergy.

But while you may know that the

colorectal cancers and heart

Rice and beans are usually inexpen-
sive and readily available, and when 
eaten together they form a complete 
protein. A protein is “complete” if it 
contains all nine of the essential 
amino acids (those that can’t be 
made by our bodies and therefore 
must be ingested). 250 grams of red 
beans with 100 grams of brown rice 
provides 327 calories, 1g of fat, 42.5g 
of carbohydrates, 18g of fibre, and

2 PULLUP
Reps: 10
Hang from a bar with hands outside 
shoulder width and palms facing  
forward. Squeeze your shoulder blades 
together as you pull yourself up until 
your chin is over the bar. You may  
alternate your grip each round if you  
like (switching to a neutral grip or  
performing chinups, for example).
3 KETTLEBELL SWING
Reps: 20
Stand with feet hip-width apart and the 
weight on the floor, about 15 centime-
tres in front of you. Hinge forward at 
your hips and grasp the handle. Keep 
your elbows tucked in, draw the weight 
back as if you were hiking a ball, then 
forcefully drive your hips forward until 
the weight reaches to your chest level.
1 BARBELL THRUSTER
Reps: 5  (PICTURED ON PREVIOUS PAGE)
Grasp a barbell in a front rack position, 
with your elbows up, and assume a 
shoulder-width stance. Squat down and 
then explosively drive up, pressing the 
bar overhead. Lower it back to your 
shoulders. That’s one rep. If you’re new 
to thrusters, use an empty barbell. If 
you’re experienced, use 40 kilos.

QUICK FACT
For all three 
exercises, 
beginners should 
use a 20– to 30-
kilo weight.  
Intermediates 
can use 40 to 52 
kilos.

1 FRONT SQUAT
Reps: 10
Set up as you did for the barbell thruster 
on Day 1 but perform only the squat, not 
the press. Also, remember to squeeze 
your shoulder blades together and keep 
your chest up throughout the duration 
of the lift. Neglecting to do so will result 
in you leaning forward and possibly 
dropping the bar. 
2 OVERHEAD SQUAT
Reps: 5
Grasp the bar with hands double- 
shoulder-width apart and press it over-
head. Stand with feet shoulder-width 
apart and toes pointed outward. Bend 
your hips back and squat as low as you 
can without losing your back’s arch. If 
you have never attempted this move, 
don’t load the barbell with any weight. 
3 SQUAT
Reps: 15 (PICTURED ON NEXT PAGE)
Rest a loaded barbell on your upper 
traps and get into a shoulder-width 
stance. Take a deep breath and bend 
your hips back, then bend your knees to 
lower your body as far as you can with-
out losing the arch in your lower back. 
Extend your hips to come back up.

1 PUSH PRESS
Reps: 5
Grasp the bar with hands shoulder- 
width apart so your forearms point to 
the ceiling. Dip your knees to gather 
momentum and then explosively press 
the weight straight overhead.
2 FARMER’S WALK
Reps: Walk for 50 metres
Pick up the heaviest dumbbells you can 
handle and walk as quickly as you can, 
without allowing the weights to touch 
your sides. Stand tall with your chest 
out. Aim to use dumbbells that together 
total 70% of your own body weight.
3 ROWING MACHINE
Reps: Row for 500 metres (NOT PICTURED)
Set the drag on the machine to between 
three and five, grasp the handle, and sit 
back so your torso is almost vertical. 
Drive with your feet to push your  
body back and then row the handle to 
your sternum.

Yes, it’s safe. Daily Undulating 
Periodization (DUP) is simply 
a way of organizing your 
training—based around compound 
movements like the deadlift, 
bench press, squat, and clean and 
jerk—by varying the sets and reps. 
For example: During a training 
week, you will do the same 
movements each time you’re in the 
gym, but perform a different rep 
scheme—typically the sets and 
reps cycle between 4x12, 6x3, and 
5x5—for each of those movements 
(hence the term undulating). By 
doing each lift three times per 
week, you’ll become more profi-
cient at the exercise. And the 
undulating rep scheme ensures 
that you won’t burn out as you 
cycle between a light, moderate, 
and heavy load for each.

New lifters are better off 
sticking to a rep range of  
five to eight. It will induce both

It seems like you have good 
intentions and a good work 
ethic, but your progress might 
be stagnant because your 
body is looking for a change. I 
would suggest training four times per 
week and splitting the workouts  into 
three full-body workouts and one 
conditioning-focused workout. And 
focus on upping your bench, squat, 
and deadlift while supplementing 
with bodybuilding-style sets and reps 
for accessory work.

First and foremost, make sure 
you’re eating .75 to 1 gram of 
protein per half-kilo of body 
weight daily—so if you weigh 82 kg, 
aim for 135 to 180 grams of protein 
each day. Next, I would recom-
mend adding a daily serving of 
creatine—it’s been shown to 
increase power output, strength, 
and the development of lean mass.

First, you can try a mixed 
grip, in which one palm is 
facing up and the other 
down—it doesn’t matter which one 
is up or down, although most 
people put their dominant hand 
facing up. To maximize your 
strength with this particular grip, 
curl the “up” palm up and twist the 
“down" palm down, like you’re 
revving a motorbike. You should 
also train your grip during your 
workouts. The best way to do this 
is to get a pair of Fat Gripz or 
Grip4orce and add them to your 
accessory lifts—do your rows, 
A
Accessory work is great for 
building muscle and boosting 
strength on your main lifts, 
but not all accessory exercises are 
equal. To maximize strength gains, 
focus on compound lifts such as 
close-grip bench presses, weighted 
chinups and dips, speed or deficit 
deadlifts, and paused or box 
squats. These exercises will have 
more carryover to your main lifts 
compared with moves like pec 
flyes, triceps rope pressdowns, and 
leg extensions. Aim to perform 
three to four sets of three to six 
reps for each exercise once a week.

I
n each issue of Muscle & Fitness 
we take special pride in deliver-
ing to you as many workouts as 
possible within our 200 pages. 
Whether it’s a mass-gaining plan  
or a six-minute shoulder blast, we 
make an effort every month to 
provide a wealth of workouts  
that you can take to the gym or 
perform at home as you strive to 
achieve your fitness goals. I’m sure 
you’ve already noticed that this 
issue is no exception.
Sincerely,
Shawn Perine
Yet, while we can give you the 
training information you need to 
get bigger, stronger, and leaner,  
we can’t do the workouts for you; 
those you’ll have to power through 
on your own (though my editors 
and I do often try out the routines 
ourselves). And while we certainly 
feature a wide variety of training 
protocols in every issue, all are 
equally effective or ineffective 
based on a single common thread: 
the effort you put in.
WORTH THE EFFORT
Fact is, there are a lot of paths 
you can take to build your pecs  
or get shredded, but the difference 
in approaches is not nearly as 
significant as the yawning gap 
between those who put in maxi-
mal effort and those who mail it in. 
I see this exemplified every day at 
the gym I train at, where there is a 
handful of guys and girls who are 
in terrific shape. Not coincidentally, 
all of them work hard for the hour 
or so they’re at the gym.  
The vast majority of the gym’s 
members, however, seem far more 
preoccupied with incoming texts 
and social media updates than with 
any exercise. And not coincidentally, 
they each look like someone who 
prioritizes a phone over a workout. 
In their cases, a Google search of the 
phrase, “Why am I not responding to 
my workouts?” won’t provide them 
nearly as accurate an answer as 
would putting down their phones 
and trying to follow the lead of their 
fellow, hardworking members. 
They’d soon learn that their failures 
have nothing to do with their 
workouts but rather with their lack 
of focus, effort, and dedication.
You can try every single routine 
in this magazine, but if your effort 
is lacking, your results will be, too. 
I’m such a strong believer in the 
power of intention that I maintain 
that a truly dedicated trainee who 
is limited to doing only pushups 
and lunges would make better 
progress than a distracted one who 
has access to a fully loaded gym. 
So if you’re serious about signifi-
cantly improving your physique, 
know that good, old-fashioned hard 
work will be your winning ticket 
every time. And if you apply that 
effort to the expert-designed 
workouts we provide you with in 
each issue of M&F, well, you’ll find it 
hard not to be the fittest, best built 
guy in your gym.
If you want to 
achieve your best 
physique, then put 
everything else  
aside and focus.
