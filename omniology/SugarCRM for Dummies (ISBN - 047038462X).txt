Dedication
This book is dedicated to new and existing CRM users. I know that you’ll be 
able to use this book to take your business to “the next level.” I hope you 
enjoy reading it as much as enjoyed writing it!

Acknowledgments
The people at Wiley Publishing are fantastic to work with and have made 
writing this book a pleasure! My acquisitions editor, Kyle Looper, is a joy 
to work with. This is the third book I’ve done with my project editor, Blair 
Pottenger; I know when to stick with a good thing! Brian Walls, my copy 
editor, made sure that all “T’s” were crossed and the “I’s” dotted; Brian, your 
edits were always right on!
Family, friends, and fun go together, and fortunately for me I have lots of all 
three. Special recognition goes to my daughter, Alyssa, on her graduation 
from that “other” Florida school and to my mother for still going strong in 
her nineties. Boca’s Swim and Racquet Club has the friendliest group any-
where; hellos go out to my various “games” and especially to my “Almost 
Champions” team mates on the USTA 4.0 league.
Writing a book is not easy, but having someone special in your life certainly 
makes it a lot more fun! Gary Kahn has loved and supported me during the 
writing of my last 9 books. You’re the best — I couldn’t have done it without 
you. Can’t wait to see where the next Bruce concert will be!

SugarCRM For Dummies 
xiv

Introduction
You just have to love any product with the word sugar in its name. 
SugarCRM is one of the best-selling customer relationship management 
(CRM) software products on the market today. For many users, SugarCRM 
represents their first foray into the area of CRM. CRM software is a little more 
complex to understand than other types of software. With a word processor, 
each document that you create is totally separate; if you make a mistake, you 
need only to delete your current document and start fresh. CRM, however, 
builds its way into a final product; if you don’t give a bit of thought as to what 
goal you wish to achieve, you could end up with a muddled mess.
I’m excited about the product and know that by the time you discover 
how to unleash the power of SugarCRM, you’ll be excited, too. You can 
use SugarCRM at work. You can use SugarCRM on the road. You can use 
SugarCRM at home. Most importantly, you can use SugarCRM to grow your 
business.
So what am I so excited about? I’ve seen firsthand how SugarCRM can save 
you time and make you more efficient. To me, accomplishing more in less 
time is an exciting thought — it allows more time for the fun things in life. 
Best of all, SugarCRM is a program that’s very easy to get up and running in 
a very short time. You’ll be amazed at not only how quickly you can set up a 
database but also at how easily you can put that database to work.
About This Book
SugarCRM For Dummies is a reference book. As such, each chapter can be 
read independently in the order you want. Each chapter focuses on a specific 
topic, so you can dive right in and head straight for the chapter that interests 
you most. I must say, however, that I’ve tried to put the chapters into a logi-
cal sequence so that those of you who are new to Sugar can just follow the 
bouncing ball from chapter to chapter. More experienced users can use the 
Table of Contents and the index to simply navigate from topic to topic as 
needed.

SugarCRM For Dummies 
Essentially, this book is a nuts-and-bolts how-to guide for accomplishing vari-
ous tasks. Drawing on many of my own experiences as a full-time CRM con-
sultant and trainer, I also include specific situations to give you a feel for the 
full power of Sugar.
Sugar is Open Source software which means that programmer types can access 
the most inner parts of the software and make modifications. It also means that 
many Sugar users are very verbal when it comes to the changes that want to 
see in the software. Fortunately, the nice folks at Sugar are extremely respon-
sive to the requests they receive so you’ll find that your version of Sugar will 
constantly update itself. This book is based on version 5.0, although most of 
the functionality covered applies to earlier versions as well.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like in most Windows-based software programs, you often have several dif-
ferent ways to accomplish a task in SugarCRM.
For the most part, I show you how to perform a function by using the 
SugarCRM menus. If I say to “click the Accounts tab,” you must click the word 
Accounts located on the Module bar that runs along the top of every Sugar 
window. When an instruction reads, “click the Create Contact shortcut,” you 
must click the words Create Contact (located at the left side of the SugarCRM 
screen). In most cases, you can access these commands from anywhere 
within Sugar, but I generally advise new users to always start a task from the 
Home page, which is the first window you see when Sugar opens. If you must 
be in a particular area to complete a task otherwise, I tell you where.
What You Should Read
Of course, I hope that you’re going to sit down and read this entire book 
from cover to cover. Then again, this book isn’t The Great American Novel. 
You’re probably finding yourself with too much to do and too little time in

 Introduction
which to do it. So, like a kid in the candy store, you’ll want to race from one 
area to another as quickly as possible so that you can reach your final goal as 
quickly as possible.
For the time being, I’m going to let you get away with reading just the parts 
that interest you most. You can read the last chapter first and the first 
chapter last if you like because this book is designed to allow you to read 
each chapter independently. However, when you find yourself floating in a 
swimming pool, soaking up the sun, and wondering what to do with all your 
spare time, you might want to go back and read some of those chapters you 
skipped. You just might discover something!
What You Don’t Have to Read
This book is intended for both new and existing SugarCRM users. Most of the 
instructions apply to both groups of readers. Occasionally, I include some 
information that might be of special interest to more advanced readers. 
Newbies, feel free to skip these sections! Also, any information tagged with a 
Technical Stuff icon is there for the truly technically inclined. Everyone else 
can just skip this info.
Foolish Assumptions
One of my least favorite words in the English language is the word assume, 
but I have to admit that I’ve made a few foolish — albeit necessary — 
assumptions when writing this book. First, I assume that you own a computer 
and have Internet browser software. Second, I assume that you have a basic 
knowledge of how to use your computer, keyboard, and mouse, and that 
SugarCRM isn’t the very first application that you’re trying to master.
I also assume that you have a genuine desire to organize your life and grow 
your business and have determined that SugarCRM is the way to go. Finally 
(and I feel quite comfortable with this assumption), I assume that you’ll grow 
to love SugarCRM.

SugarCRM For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this book into six parts. Each part contains several chapters cov-
ering related topics. The following is a brief description of each part, with 
chapter references directing you where to go for particular information.
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life
In Part I, you get an introduction to the concepts of CRM and Open Source 
software and find out why SugarCRM has become such a popular choice of 
CRM users (Chapter 1). In this part, you read about how to install Sugar and 
how to tweak some of your user preferences (Chapter 2). You discover how 
to navigate your way around Sugar (Chapter 3) and then start sweetening the 
pot by adding a few Contacts, Accounts, and Leads to Sugar (Chapter 4).
Part II: Cooking with Sugar
Part II focuses on helping you keep your business day organized and pro-
ductive. You start by scheduling appointments, finding your way around 
the Sugar calendars, and taking a few notes (Chapter 5). You might find that 
your activities evolve into major projects (Chapter 6), or that you need help 
organizing your sales opportunities (Chapter 7). If you have trouble organiz-
ing your filing system, you might benefit from the Sugar library (Chapter 8), 
where you can store your customer-related documents. And, after you’ve 
filled your Sugar bowl with lots of information, you’ll need ways to get to that 
data quickly and easily (Chapter 9).
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your 
Customers Happy
CRM stands for customer relationship management, and that’s exactly the 
focus of Part III. The customer is always right and if he’s not happy, you’ll 
want to create a case to resolve his issues (Chapter 10). If you are a manufac-
turer, Sugar can come to the rescue of your quality control issues by helping 
you report bugs in your products and perhaps create a Knowledge Base (KB) 
to help you find the proper solution (Chapter 11).

 Introduction
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl
One of the best features of SugarCRM is the ability to communicate easily with 
the outside world. Part IV shows you how to set up your e-mail and work with 
e-mail templates to automate routine communications (Chapter 12). If you’re 
serious about expanding your business, you’ll want to set up a campaign — 
and track its success — by creating lead forms, sending newsletters or other 
templates, and then analyzing the success of the campaign (Chapter 13).
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar
We’re all different and often like to do things in our own unique way. 
SugarCRM understands that concept, and Part V helps you customize Sugar 
to your heart’s content. SugarCRM comes in three flavors, and you’ll want to 
make sure you’re using the right one (Chapter 14). At first glance, SugarCRM 
might seem to include everything you need to organize and grow your busi-
ness, but by adding fields and modules, and placing them on customized 
layouts (Chapter 15), you’ll be able to transform Sugar into your own unique 
software application.
Every CRM product needs an Administrator. If you’re elected to the job, you 
need to know how to take control of your users and perform administrative 
tasks, such as performing routine maintenance, backing up your database, 
and troubleshoot problems if they arise (Chapter 16).
Part VI: The Part of Tens
With apologies to David Letterman, Part VI gives you a few of my favorite 
SugarCRM lists. First, I list the features that are found only in the Professional 
and Enterprise editions of SugarCRM (Chapter 17). SugarCRM is Open Source 
software, which makes it easy for developers to create products that give 
Sugar even more power and functionality; I highlight a few of these products 
in Chapter 18. Finally, I give you ten ways to help you understand everything 
there is to know about SugarCRM — and then some (Chapter 19)!

Where to Go from Here
For those of you who are Sugar old-timers, you might want to skim the entire 
contents of this book before hunkering down to read the sections that seem 
the most relevant to you. My experience is that the average Sugar user prob-
ably employs only a portion of the program and might not even be aware of 
some of the really cool features of SugarCRM. You might be surprised to dis-
cover all that SugarCRM has to offer!
For the SugarCRM newbie, I recommend heading straight for Part I, where 
you can acquaint yourself with Sugar before moving on to other parts of the 
book and the Sugar program.

Part I
Adding Sugar 
to Your Life

In this part . . .
I
 know that you’re excited about all the possibilities 
SugarCRM has to offer and that you want to dive into 
the program as soon as possible. Here’s where you find an 
overview of some of the cool features that you find in 
Sugar. You also become familiar with the many faces of 
Sugar; after all, you wouldn’t want to get lost along the 
way. But first, you have to do a bit of homework and whip 
Sugar into shape by fiddling with a few preference settings 
to ensure that Sugar produces the type of results you’re 
looking for. Finally, you add in a dash of Contacts records, 
sprinkle in a few Accounts records, and top it off with a 
few Leads records.

▶ Determining who should be using Sugar
▶ The different flavors of Sugar
S
o what is SugarCRM, anyway? I find that one of the hardest things that 
I have to do with SugarCRM is to explain exactly what it is. In this chap-
ter, I give you a bit of background into the company and explain some of the 
terms that you’re likely to hear bantered around. I also give you a few ideas 
on the types of folks who are using Sugar, and give you a few ground rules 
that I’ve established over the years after watching new users wrestle with 
certain aspects of CRM. I even point out the various flavors of Sugar.
The History of Sugar
It’s not imperative that you commit the history of SugarCRM to memory, but 
I do think it can give you a bit more of an understanding as to why the soft-
ware is so functional — and why it will work so well for your business.
Once upon a time, there were three young men. I could refer to them as the 
three Musketeers, but actually, they were John, Jacob, and Clint. They had 
brains. They were tech-savvy. They had a vision. Unfortunately, they didn’t 
have a lot of money.
Our three heroes soon found that their one edition of Microsoft Office (Student 
Edition) wasn’t sufficient to run a business, so they sought out low-cost alterna-
tives. As their coffers were limited — okay, they were empty — they discovered 
Open Office, a free alternative to the more expensive Microsoft Office software. 
Like Scarlet O’Hara, they vowed never to go software hungry again and to pur-
chase the more robust Office when their business expanded.

10
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
If this were a big budget Hollywood movie, the seas would part and the music 
would crescendo; a light bulb went off in their collective heads. “What if,” 
they wondered, “we built a really great piece of software and gave it away 
free in the hope that businesses would upgrade to something pricier when 
they could afford it?” Thus, SugarCRM was born.
As in most Hollywood movies, this story has a happy ending. Since its incep-
tion in 2004, over 4 million users have downloaded SugarCRM Community 
Edition (CE) — it’s available in 75 different languages and over 3,000 compa-
nies (representing approximately 150,000 users) have actually purchased the 
software. And yes, our heroes are now using Microsoft Office as are several 
hundred of their employees.
Getting Started with a 
Few Basic Concepts
Nobody likes technical jargon, but in the course of showing you how to use 
SugarCRM I might lapse into Geek Speak and use a handful of somewhat tech-
nical terms; I just can’t avoid it. Becoming familiar with them now is less pain-
ful in the long run.
What in the world is Open Source?
SugarCRM is Open Source software, which means the underlying source code 
is available to programmer- and developer-types who want to totally trans-
form the software. I like to explain SugarCRM initially by using very politically 
correct terminology:
 
✓ Free redistribution: Open Source software is free; as in, it doesn’t cost 
you anything.
 
✓ Includes the source code: The source code is the actual language that 
the programmer used to create the product. By making the source 
code available, users can change the software at will — and continue to 
embellish it.
 
✓ Derived works: Once downloaded, you can share the software legally 
with any of your friends, neighbors, and relatives.
 
✓ License must not restrict other software: When you download Open 
Source software, any tools that you need to run it are included free — 
there are no hidden charges.
 
✓ License must be technology-neutral: Many software programs will only 
work with specific operating systems; Open Source products, such as 
Sugar, will work on virtually any operating system.

11
 Chapter 1: Adding Sugar to Your Life
By now, you might be scratching your head and wondering, “Why in the 
world would anyone want to go to the bother of creating software and giving 
it away for free?” I’m glad you asked because there’s a bit of method to what 
you might consider madness:
 
✓ By giving a version of the software away free, you’re able to put your 
software in the hands of a lot of users who will try it, hopefully like it, 
and eventually buy a fee-based version if the need arises.
 
✓ Companies like SugarCRM spend very little money on marketing; free 
distribution leads to a great deal of “word of mouth” advertising.
 
✓ Companies like SugarCRM spend very little money on a sales force 
because most users that want to upgrade to a fee-based product have 
already tried the free version for a while and just want to add a little 
extra functionality.
 
✓ Manufacturers of Open Source receive lots of free feedback on their 
products, which helps them to both identify any bugs or problems in the 
software and increase the functionality of the software.
What in the world is CRM?
Just in case you feel like your drowning in a vat of alphabet soup, I’d like to 
give you a bit more of a feel for customer relationship management (CRM). In 
a nutshell, CRM can help you manage any interaction a company has with its 
customers — or potential customers. CRM can
 
✓ Provide you with a unified database to house the contact details for 
all of your prospects and customers.
 
✓ Allow you to associate notes, histories, appointments, and even docu-
ments with a specific contact record.
 
✓ Give you automated methods to improve your marketing effectiveness.
 
✓ Improve your relationship with your current customers by providing 
you with customer service tools.
 
✓ Provide executives with tools to track their sales performance.
In addition, really good CRM software can:
 
✓ Be easily customized by adding fields and changing layouts based on 
your company’s requirements.
 
✓ Offer a variety of deployment options so that it can be used by busi-
nesses ranging from single owners to mammoth corporations.

12
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
A few other terms to know
SugarCRM is a database program. A database is a collection of informa-
tion organized in such a way that the user of the database can quickly find 
desired pieces of information. Think of a database as an electronic filing 
system. Although most Sugar users create a database of contacts, some 
users develop Sugar databases to collect information about things other than 
contacts. For example, you might create a Sugar database to track the serial 
numbers of the products you’ve sold or the properties that you manage.
Traditional databases are organized by fields, records, and instances:
 
✓ Field: A field is a single piece of information. In databases, fields are 
the smallest units of information. A tax form, for example, contains 
a number of fields: one for your name, one for your Social Security 
number, one for your income, and so on. In SugarCRM, you start with 
numerous fields for Contact, Accounts, and Leads to hold information 
such as name, address and shoe size.
 
 You find out how to add information into these fields in Chapter 4. 
And, in Chapter 15, I show you how to change the attributes of existing 
fields and how to add new fields to your database if you’re the database 
administrator.
 
✓ Record: A record is one complete set of fields. In SugarCRM, all the infor-
mation you collect that pertains to one individual Contact, Account, or 
Lead is a record.
 
✓ Instance: An instance is the entire collection of data or information. Each 
database that you create in SugarCRM is given a unique MySQL instance. 
You can create more than one instance or database in SugarCRM — 
head to Chapter 2 to find out how.
Sugar, Sugar!
Fortunately for you, you can’t hear me singing my somewhat off-key rendi-
tion of Sugar, Sugar. I have to admit that I start to hum a few bars every 
time I think about some of the cool feature of SugarCRM. In this section, 
I’ve put together a little shopping list of features so that you can see all that 
SugarCRM can do for you, too. In parentheses after each item, I include a 
chapter reference where you can find more information about a particular 
feature (if you’re so inclined).
One of the things you might find interesting is that the folks at SugarCRM “eat 
their own dog food.” What I mean by that is everyone from the top-level execu-
tives and the folks at tech support to the marketing gurus, administrative staff, 

13
 Chapter 1: Adding Sugar to Your Life
and even the product managers use Sugar. By doing so, they see firsthand 
whether Sugar provides them with all the tools they need to run a successful 
business.
SugarCRM is a multifaceted business management tool that
 
✓ Stores complete contact information, including name, company, 
phone numbers, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses. (Chapter 4)
 
✓ Comes with enough predefined fields to get you rolling. If you want to 
add additional fields and modules to meet your specific needs, go right 
ahead (Chapter 15).
 
✓ Records an unlimited number of dated notes, histories, and activities 
for each of your contacts so that you can easily keep track of impor-
tant conversations and events. This feature is particularly useful for 
those of us who (unlike our friend, the elephant) do forget things on 
occasion (Chapter 5).
 
✓ Keeps on top of any issues that your customers are having. Create 
a case (Chapter 10), track bugs in your product line (Chapter 11), or 
produce individualized customer portals that offer customers access to 
your company’s Knowledge Base and FAQ’s (Chapter 10).
 
✓ Allows you to stay in front of your customers and prospects. Merge 
your contact information into a template that you create, and then send 
merged documents via e-mail (Chapter 12), snail mail, or as part of a full-
scale marketing campaign (Chapter 13).
 
✓ Manages your sales pipeline. Create sales opportunities, track their 
progress, and analyze the results (Chapter 7).
 
✓ Shares your data with remote users. If you have other SugarCRM users 
in remote locations, they can view database changes online, offline, or 
even via the browser of their PDA.
 
✓ Automates your follow-up, assuring that none of your contacts “fall 
through the cracks.” Sugar’s Workflow feature assures that you contact 
your customers and prospects automatically by relying on a schedule 
and method that you design (Chapter 14).
Identifying the Typical SugarCRM User
Who is the typical SugarCRM user? Well, with more than 4 million user down-
loads of the free SugarCRM Community Edition (CE) and over 3,000 busi-
nesses currently using a subscription edition of Sugar, you’re safe to assume 
that nearly every industry is represented among its user base.

14
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
I think it’s only fair to warn you that once you develop a sweet tooth, you’ll 
soon find that Sugar is indispensible. You’ll become addicted to SugarCRM 
and eventually use it to manage all facets of your business. You might just 
become a Sugar junkie. (Quite simply, a Sugar junkie is a SugarCRM user who 
has become addicted to using SugarCRM.)
So, just who is using SugarCRM? Everyone!
 
✓ A CEO or sales manager uses SugarCRM because they want to know 
what the salespeople are doing and how successful their efforts are.
 
✓ An administrative assistant uses SugarCRM to automate routine tasks 
and to keep a schedule of various tasks and activities.
 
✓ A salesperson uses SugarCRM to make sure that she’s following up on 
all her prospects.
 
✓ Customer Service representatives use Sugar to make sure that all cus-
tomers are happy customers.
 
✓ The IT department uses Sugar to help prioritize — and resolve — any 
computer-related issues that the staff might encounter.
 
✓ Tech Support uses Sugar to track and follow through on customer 
problems.
 
✓ The Marketing department uses SugarCRM to send mailings and mar-
keting campaigns — and to measure their success.
So what kinds of businesses use SugarCRM? All kinds!
 
✓ Manufacturers who need to organize any problems that their customers 
might encounter, and keep track of any known product defects.
 
✓ Financial planners who need to track very detailed information on each 
of their clients.
 
✓ Businesses in any industry looking for software that can automate their 
business and make them more productive in less time.
 
✓ Large businesses that want to improve communication among employees, 
track their leads, and keep their customers happy.
 
✓ Small businesses that have to rely on a small staff to complete a multi-
tude of tasks.

 Chapter 1: Adding Sugar to Your Life
Knowing the Basic SugarCRM 
Ground Rules
Sometimes you just need to figure out things the hard way. After all, experi-
ence is the best teacher. Luckily for you, however, I’ve compiled a list of 
rules based on a few mistakes that I see other Sugar users commit. You’re 
not going to find these rules written down anywhere else, and they might not 
even make a whole lot of sense to you. However, as you become more and 
more familiar with Sugar, these rules will make all the sense in the world. You 
might even want to refer to them from time to time.
Karen’s Four Rules of Always:
 
✓ Always log in to SugarCRM as yourself.
 
✓ Always strive for standardization in your database by entering your 
data in a consistent manner.
 
✓ Always input as much information into your database as possible.
 
✓ Always have a well-trained administrator who will be able to upgrade 
Sugar when necessary, perform required maintenance, and make sure 
your administrator is backing-up your database routinely!
Looking at the Three Versions 
of SugarCRM
SugarCRM comes in three separate editions, which are
 
✓ SugarCRM Community Edition (CE): This is the free version of Sugar. As 
the saying goes, the best things in life are free and that just might be the 
case with Sugar CE. Typically used by businesses with 1–10 users, it is 
possible to use CE with businesses of virtually any size; in fact, one busi-
ness with over 2,000 users is currently using Sugar CE.
 
✓ SugarCRM Professional: This version is generally used by larger organi-
zations wanting additional “team” functionality, improved quoting and 
forecasting, and reporting capabilities. However, smaller organizations 
also use the Professional version to take advantage of other features, 
including integration with Microsoft Office products and wireless PDA 
access. Professional will cost you $275 per user per year.

16
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
✓ SugarCRM Enterprise: Enterprise is generally the version of choice for 
companies with one hundred or more users. In addition to having all the 
features found in the CE and Professional versions, Enterprise throws 
Oracle support, Advanced SQL Reporting, and an offline client into the 
mix. Enterprise costs $449 per user per year.
 
Every feature found in SugarCRM Community Edition is found in the other 
versions of SugarCRM as well. In fact, you’ll find that 85% of the content of 
the Professional and Enterprise versions is identical to the content of Sugar 
Community Edition. However, from time to time, I point out a feature that is 
found only in the Professional or Enterprise (Pro and Ent, respectively) ver-
sions. You might want to look at Chapter 14, which highlights features that you 
find only in Pro and Ent, or at Chapter 17 for a full list of some of the cooler Pro 
and Ent features. Figure 1-1 is a visual comparison of the three versions.
 
Both the Professional and Enterprise versions of Sugar include the addition of 
phone-based support. For other support options, take a gander at Chapter 19.
 
Not ready to bite the bullet and start paying for your Sugar rush? You might 
consider one other option — Sugar Network. Sugar Network, which runs $119 
per user per year, supplies you with the plug-ins to the Microsoft Office prod-
ucts (Word, Outlook, and Excel) and gives you access to phone-based sup-
port. Such a deal!
So what are you waiting for? Boot up your computer, grab this book, and get 
going. After all, it’s time to satisfy your sweet tooth!

efore you start using SugarCRM, you need to install it. You have a couple 
of options for doing this and I show you what they are. I show you how to 
set up a second database as well. You also discover how to log in — and how 
to change some of the preference settings after you do.
Taking the Sugarland Express
In Chapter 1, you find out about the various flavors of SugarCRM. In this 
chapter, I discuss the three deployment options available to you.
Ultimately, the deployment option you choose rests on two important factors:
 
✓ Your comfort level in knowing that another company is managing — 
and has full access to — your company data.
 
✓ The amount of IT expertise that resides within your company.
 
If you require a bit of handholding you might want to check out www.sugar
crm.com/crm/crmquiz which offers a nifty little deployment calculator. 
You’ll also find a white paper link there explaining the various deployment 
options in even greater detal.

18
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
Hosting SugarCRM On-Site
Quite simply, the On-Site deployment option means that your SugarCRM 
is kept in your very own location — or at a data center that you selected. 
At first glance, this may seem like a logical approach. However, before you 
decide this is the way to go, you might want to weigh the pros and cons.
Hosting your own SugarCRM installation has a number of benefits:
 
✓ You don’t have to pay anyone a monthly fee to host Sugar for you.
 
✓ Your data is on your very own site, which means you don’t have to 
worry that the host might possibly abscond with your data.
 
✓ You’re in compliance if your company prohibits letting customer 
information outside your firewall.
 
✓ You can integrate your data with other applications, such as Web or 
accounting data, that you may have on-site.
Now you’re wondering why someone wouldn’t want to host his own database. 
Although it’s very easy to host a Sugar database, you need to consider a few 
details before proceeding:
 
✓ You have a static IP address or dynamic DNS service if you want other 
remote users to be able to access your database using a web address 
via the Internet.
 
✓ Your IT infrastructure must meet the demand of housing — and 
hosting — a database. You need to make sure that your server and 
bandwidth are up to the challenge.
 
✓ Your IT department understands what running a Web server entails.
 
✓ Your IT department is responsible for any data loss you might experi-
ence through improper maintenance procedures.
Demanding to have your Sugar hosted
The folks at SugarCRM aim to please. Want free software? Not a problem — 
just download the CE version. Want to host it yourself? SugarCRM makes the 
process so easy that even a Dummy can do it — as you can see later on in this 
chapter. But how about you folks who are feeling a bit intimidated by thoughts 
of Web servers, IP addresses, and the responsibility of being the administrator 
of the whole enchilada? Not to worry, SugarCRM has your back.
Sugar offers “hosted” solutions for both its Professional and Enterprise edi-
tions. The fees include both the Sugar software and a server to host it on. 
Best of all, these solutions include all the IT expertise needed to ensure that 
your database remains alive and kicking.

19
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
 
✓ Sugar Professional On-Demand: For $480 per year per user, Sugar will 
have you and your company up and running on one of their servers 
quicker than you can say, “Show me the Sugar!” When you consider that 
this works out to be approximately $17 per user per month more than 
just purchasing Professional, this is a great bargain!
 
✓ Sugar Enterprise On-Demand: For those of you who want every sugary 
bell and whistle — and want someone else to worry about all the gory 
details — this might just be the way for you to go. Although this solution 
will set you back $75 per user per month, the hosting portion works out 
to be less than $40 per month, which is considerably less than the typi-
cal server rental cost. In exchange, you’ll have every feature that Sugar 
has to offer — and you’ll sleep well at night knowing that your data is in 
good hands.
 
Although SugarCRM doesn’t offer hosting for the Sugar Community Edition, 
a number of companies out there do specialize in Sugar hosting. In addition, 
some companies lease servers so that all you have to do is install Sugar — 
they do all the rest!
Building a Sugar Cube
By now, you might feel that your beloved author has had so much sugar that 
it’s gone to her head. Fear not; with a name like Sugar, it’s only natural that 
some form of the product be named Sugar Cube.
Sugar Cube — or appliance — deployment is the icing on the cake, the cherry 
on the top — okay, it’s a turn-key system that includes a server that’s already 
configured for Sugar. This is an ideal solution for companies who don’t want 
to have a third-party vendor control their data, but don’t have the IT exper-
tise to set up a Web browser. Plug in the server, open your Web browser, and 
you’re ready to go.
Sugar Cube deployment offers the following benefits:
 
✓ A Web-based CRM solution — without having a full-time IT department.
 
✓ Fast deployment — Sugar has already configured your hardware and 
software.
 
✓ Data security — your data is located on your premises, safely behind 
your firewall.
 
The folks at Sugar tell me that Sugar Cube deployment is mostly used by gov-
ernmental agencies who want to make sure that their data is totally secure, 
but it certainly seems like a viable option for many other companies as well.

Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
Preparing for Your Sugar Installation
After you’ve made the decision to host your own Sugar, you can literally be 
up and running in about 15 minutes if you do a bit of homework first. On 
paper — or at least on the side of the software box — placing a database on 
the Web sounds easy. However, you’ll want to check out a few things before 
you start installing — you don’t want to install the software first and then 
find out that your system isn’t up to the task.
 
Compatibility is always an issue when it comes to integrating new software 
into your current mix. However, the basic rule of thumb is that if your existing 
component runs PHP 4.4 or higher, it will work with Sugar.
Adding Sugar to your Web server
All you need to put your database on the Internet for all the world (or at least 
your company) to see is a Web server. Sugar isn’t picky and will give you two 
Web server options:
 
✓ Apache
 
✓ Windows Internet Information Server (IIS)
What’s in an IP name?
Although you and I might name our computers with endearing names, such 
as Hal or Son of a Pitchfork, programmers think in terms of numbers and 
name their computers with names like 192.168.2.38. Guess that has a ring 
to it, if you’re a computer. This name/number is a computer’s internal IP 
address. A computer’s internal IP address identifies it from the other comput-
ers in your internal network: hence, the modifier internal. Within your net-
work, you can assign IP addresses at random as long as each one is unique.
When you connect to the outside world, you have an external IP address. This 
number identifies you to the great big world outside your internal network. 
Your external IP also has a cute name, such as 67.87.243.62.
External IP addresses come in two flavors: dynamic and static. A dynamic IP 
address is like a cute little toddler — it bounces around all over the place. A 
dynamic external IP address is assigned to you by your ISP (Internet service 
provider) on a round-robin, first-come-first-served basis. Consequently, one 
day, your name is 67.87.243.62; the next day, it’s 1.160.10.240.

21
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
Your remote users log in to your Web server via your Web server’s external 
IP address. The trouble is that remote users might feel like they’re playing a 
giant game of keep-away if they have to use a different IP address every time 
they want to get into Sugar. Enter the static IP address. A static IP address 
doesn’t change, making life much easier for your remote users.
If you have a dynamic IP address, you have to get a static one or risk having 
your remote users being unable to access the database. This is the hardest 
part of the entire procedure: You have to check with your ISP to get one. 
Surprisingly enough, if you pay your ISP a little extra money each month, 
most are happy to accommodate you.
 
If you really want to get fancy, consider registering a domain name. You can 
substitute it for your external IP address number so that you can go to your 
Web site by using mywebsite.com instead of 12.34.567.89.
Operating under the right 
operating system
The neat thing about Sugar is that it plays nicely with most of the other kids 
in the technology playground.
Sugar works with most any operating system (OS) including:
 
✓ Linux
 
✓ Windows
 
✓ Mac
 
✓ Solaris
BYOD (Bring Your Own Database)
Sugar needs a database and, unlike many other CRM programs, will work 
with many different flavors. You don’t need to go out and purchase one, how-
ever, because Sugar works with MySQL, which is free. If you already have a 
pricey database on hand, Sugar also works with
 
✓ SQL Server 2005
 
✓ Oracle

22
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
No browser, no Sugar
Sugar is browser-based software, which means that your information opens 
in a browser window. Therefore, it only stands to reason that you’ll need a 
browser if you’re going to be using Sugar. If you can surf the Internet, you can 
most likely surf Sugar because it works on any of the popular browsers:
 
✓ Mozilla 
 
✓ Firefox 
 
✓ Internet Explorer
Just to be safe, you’ll want to make sure that you are in the latest and greatest 
version of your browser.
Plugging in to a Plug-In
Sugar plug-Ins connect Sugar to Word for purposes of mail merge, and to 
either Outlook or Thunderbird for purposes of e-mail. Make sure you have 
one of the following versions:
 
✓ Microsoft Office 2003, Office XP, or Office 2007
 
✓ Thunderbird 1.5 or 2.0
 
The plug-ins are available with the Professional or Enterprise versions of 
Sugar, or can be purchased as part of the Sugar Network support plan.
Ready, Set, Install!
Now that your homework is done, it’s time to move on to the fun stuff — 
installing Sugar! Okay, you might not think this is the most fun you’ve ever 
had, but it’s certainly going to be one of the easiest things you’ve done.
How does this stack up for you?
SugarCRM features FastStack installers, which means all the software you 
need to get up and running is included in one easy file. You can download it 

23
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
from www.sugarcrm.com/crm/download/sugar-suite.html. Like pan-
cakes at IHOP, you can get your stack in a number of flavors; regardless of 
the flavor, all stacks include the following elements:
 
✓ The newest version of PHP.
 
✓ Web server software: You can use your existing Windows IIS or install 
the free Apache software.
 
✓ A database engine: You can choose a stack that includes the free 
MySQL, or you can bring your own SQL Server or Oracle database to the 
party.
 
✓ Sugar software: You can pick your favorite flavor of Sugar including 
Windows, Linux, and Mac. Sorry, blueberry and apple aren’t yet 
available.
 
.NET 2.0 must be installed on your system before you attempt to install Sugar 
FastStack, so make sure that your Windows operating system is up to date and 
loaded with the latest patches.
 
Feel a bit overwhelmed? Try using the Download Wizard if you’re unsure 
about which stack to download. Figure 2-1 shows you exactly what the down-
load page looks like.
 
Downloading a file is half the fun. The other half is remembering exactly where 
you downloaded that file. You might want to jot down the location.

Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
It’s typical to use the Typical install
After you download the appropriate FastStack file, you need to run it. 
Fortunately, Sugar has removed the guesswork and made the installation pro-
cess extremely easy. Follow these steps: 
 
1. Double-click the file that you downloaded and then click Run.
 
 After a moment of silence, the first screen of the FastStack Setup Wizard 
appears (see Figure 2-2).
 
Figure 2-2: 
Starting the 
FastStack 
Setup 
Wizard.
 
 
2. Click Next, accept the EULA (End User License Agreement), and then 
click Next to continue.
 
 Like most software, if you don’t agree to play by the rules you don’t get 
to play the game!
 
3. Select your installation directory and then click Next to continue.
 
 Sugar very nicely suggests an appropriate installation directory with a 
clever name like SugarCRM_5.0B (if you’re installing the 5.0B version of 
Sugar).
 
4. Select the components that you want to install and then click Next to 
continue.
 
 As you see in Figure 2-3, this isn’t an earth-shattering decision; it’s a given 
that you’re installing Sugar. Optionally, you can install phpMyAdmin, 
which will come in handy if you want to do a bit of the advanced mainte-
nance I mention in Chapter 16.

25
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
 
Figure 2-3: 
Selecting 
the com-
ponents 
you want to 
install.
 
 
5. Select Typical install and then click Next to continue.
 
 Unless you are very conversant in the language of Apache and PHP, I 
recommend that you go with the Typical installation and let Sugar do all 
the thinking. If IIS is installed on your system, the Sugar Installer will use 
it instead of Apache Web Server; if IIS isn’t installed, the Sugar Installer 
will install Apache.
 
6. Type a System Name and then click Next to Continue.
 
 This name will appear in the title of the browser that your users use to 
access the Sugar database. As shown in Figure 2-4, you want to choose a 
name with some semblance of logic.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Assigning 
a System 
Name.
 

26
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
7. Assign a password for the SugarCRM administrator, type it a second 
time to make sure you got it right the first time, and then click Next to 
continue.
 
 Sugar automatically names your administrator Admin. Suffice it to say, 
you’ll want to remember that password because you’ll need it to open 
up your database!
 
8. Indicate whether you’d like to install the demo database and then 
click Next to continue.
 
 If you are a Sugar newbie, you just might want to install the demo database.
 
 You can install as many databases as you’d like on your Web server, as I 
show you in the next section.
 
9. Select Yes to install Sugar as a Service and then click Next to continue.
 
 This means that Sugar will automatically run every time you fire up 
your computer — and that any remote users will be able to see your 
database.
 
10. Enter the port number Sugar will use to listen for visitors and then 
click Next to continue.
 
 By default, Sugar cheerfully suggests that you use port 80, which is a great 
choice unless another program on your Web server is also using port 
80. In that case, Sugar politely informs you that the port is already being 
used; you can then suggest another port number — such as 81 or 82.
 
11. Enter the SSL Port number and then click Next to continue.
 
 Again, Sugar recommends the port wine, er, port number of 443. If it’s 
being used, feel free to choose 444 or 445.
 
12. Enter your Web server domain and then click Next.
 
 Here’s where you add your static IP address or your domain name (see 
Figure 2-5), if you registered one.
 
13. Type the MySQL port number and then click Next.
 
 In case you’re feeling dazed and confused in the maze of port numbers, 
don’t worry. Once again, Sugar will come to the rescue, providing you 
with a suggested port number. If that one doesn’t work, just type the 
next sequential number until you hit a winner.
 
14. Assign a password for the MySQL user, type it a second time to make 
sure you got it right the first time, and then click Next to continue.
 
 Previously you entered the Sugar password; now you’re entering the 
MySQL password.
 
15. Assign a password for the phpMyAdmin tool user, type it a second 
time to make sure you got it right the first time, and then click Next to 
continue.

27
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
 
 Here’s where you type the third — and last — password. This one allows 
you to access the phpMyAdmin tool that installs with Sugar.
 
 If you have a mind like a steel trap, you might want to use three separate 
passwords. However, if you occasionally suffer from “senior moments,” 
you might consider using the same password for all three instances. You 
might also want to write down this information — and put it in a safe 
spot — just in case you need to use those passwords again.
 
16. Click Next to complete the installation.
 
 You see an indicator bar scroll across your computer screen while Sugar 
installs.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Assigning 
the Web 
server 
domain.
 
Creating a second database
After you install Sugar, you might want to peruse the file structure of your 
computer to get a feel for what was actually installed, especially if you want 
to install a second database.
In the previous section, you install Sugar using the FastStack installer. When 
installing a second database, it’s only necessary to install an additional 
instance of Sugar. The other elements — PHP, MySQL, and Apache — do not 
need to be installed again.
Here’s what you’ll do to get that second database up and running:
 
1. Download the Sugar install file from www.sugarcrm.com/crm/
download/sugar-suite.html.
  
 This time, make sure that you’re not installing a FastStack.

28
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to the Htdocs folder.
 
 You’ll find that folder lurking under the SugarCRM folder in the Program 
Files area of your computer. If you look inside the Htdocs folder, you 
see a subfolder that corresponds to the name you gave your database in 
Step 6 of the previous section.
 
 To make life easier, you might want to give the folder that will hold your 
extracted files a moniker that corresponds to the name of your new 
database.
 
3. Open your Web browser and navigate to the section of your Web 
server that holds the newly downloaded files.
 
 This takes a little more explaining, Lucy. Say your IP address is 
65.7.123.456 and you extracted your Sugar files to a subfolder of 
Htdocs that you named Dummy. Let’s also assume that you opened 
Port 81 in Step 10 of the previous section. You would be typing in 
http://65.7.123.456:81/dummy/install.php.
 
4. The Installation Wizard opens.
 
 At this point, you’re free to follow the Installation Wizard — or the steps 
in the previous section.
  
 For the sake of simplicity, give the System Name the same name as the 
Htdocs folder that is holding the extracted Sugar files.
Logging in to SugarCRM
Whew! The hard part is over and you’re now free to share your Sugar data-
base with all your friends and enemies — or at least your co-workers.
Finding your database requires three components:
 
✓ The static IP or domain name.
 
✓ The Web server port.
 
✓ The name of the folder containing your database.
So, using the example in the previous section, you’d access your database by 
typing http://65.7.123.456:81/dummy.
 
After you’ve navigated to the Sugar database, feel free to save the URL in your 
Internet Favorites folder because this is bound to become one of your favorite 
sites!

29
 Chapter 2: Acquiring a Sweet Tooth
SugarCRM presents you with a login screen each time you attempt to open 
your database. Essentially, the login screen (shown in Figure 2-6) asks you 
for your user name and your password. You need to make sure that you cor-
rectly enter your user name and password information. For example, if your 
user name includes your middle initial with a period, you must type that 
middle initial — including the period — to gain access to your database.
 
Your user name is not case sensitive (that is, you can enter your name by 
typing either lowercase or UPPERCASE letters). However, your password is 
case sensitive, so make sure you’re not typing WITH THE CAPS LOCK ON.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Logging in to 
SugarCRM.
 
Generally, the administrator of your database determines your password. 
The database administrator is the person responsible for making major 
changes to the database and for performing routine database maintenance. 
(For more information, see Chapter 16.)
Notice that dots appear while you type your password. That’s normal. Just 
like when you type your ATM card PIN, your SugarCRM database password 
is hidden while you type to prevent any lurking spies from discovering your 
password. 

30
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
The Importance of Being Yourself
The first thing that you see when you log in to a SugarCRM database is your 
Home page. The Home page contains all the information pertaining to you — 
Contacts, Leads, Appointments — so if you log in to Sugar as someone else, 
you just might find yourself sending a birthday card to someone’s Aunt Bertha.
Logging in as yourself allows you to use a few other important SugarCRM 
features:
 
✓ Permission to perform various functions is based on the security level 
of each user.
 
✓ Every time you enter a new Contact, Account, or Lead record, your 
name appears as the creator.
 
✓ When you edit a Contact, Account, or Lead record, your name appears 
in the log file.
 
✓ Every time you add a note, history, or activity to a Contact record, 
your name appears as the Record Creator.

fter getting the hang of maneuvering in SugarCRM, you’ll find that it’s an 
amazingly easy program to master. The key is to become familiar with 
the lay of the land before you start building your database. By doing so, you 
avoid playing hide-and-seek later. Although initially getting around in SugarCRM 
is pretty easy, you might become lost in the maze of views and tabs that Sugar 
is divided into. I help you navigate through that maze by taking you on a Sugar 
tour so that you can become familiar with the various sweet screens.
There’s No Place Like Home
The purpose of this book is to serve as a reference for both new and existing 
SugarCRM users. I certainly don’t want to lose anyone along the way. New Sugar 
users might be somewhat intimidated when they encounter Sugar for the first 
time. Be assured that this experience is akin to the first time you drive a new car 
at night in the rain — momentary panic sets in. After you’ve driven the car for 
a week or so, the location of the light and windshield wiper controls becomes 
second nature. I guarantee you’ll have the same experience with Sugar.
Navigating through Sugar is fairly easy. However, to make the navigating even 
easier, I highlight throughout this section a number of pitfalls that you want 
to avoid.
When you first open your Sugar Web site, you land smack in the middle of 
the Home page. The Home page is divided into separate areas, or dashlets; 
Chapter 9 shows you how to make changes to your Home page. You can see 
the Home page, along with other key elements of Sugar, in Figure 3-1.
Although you’ll be accessing the various Sugar modules, most of the modules 
have the same common elements.

You can go Home again
The best way to learn about a new piece of software is to try it out. Go ahead: 
kick the tires, click the buttons, and try those hyperlinks. However, don’t 
panic if you start to feel slightly lost. You can always return to your Home 
page by using one of the two following cures for the “I’m lost!” blues:
 
✓ Click the back button on your browser until you reach your Home page.
 
✓ Click the Home tab.

Treading on the title bar
You must view Sugar in your Web browser. The title bar at the top of the 
browser (refer to Figure 3-1) shows you the System Name you indicate when 
installing Sugar (refer to Chapter 2). Don’t overlook the importance of this 
piece of information! If your title bar reads Google, you’ve stumbled into the 
wrong Web site.

33
 Chapter 3: Finding Your Way Around Sugar
 
Chapter 16 shows you some of the neat things that your administrator can 
do to customize Sugar. You might consider replacing the SugarCRM logo with 
your company’s logo to make it even easier to identify your database.
System links
The system links are located near the top of just about any module you 
happen to stumble in to (refer to Figure 3-1). They are designed to help you 
customize Sugar to your liking and have easy access to system information. 
The system links include
 
✓ Logout: You’ll notice that Sugar cheerfully greets you by name. If, how-
ever, Sugar greets you by a name that doesn’t happen to be yours, you 
might want to click the Logout link and log in as yourself!
 
✓ My Account: Allows you to add your contact information to the Sugar 
database, as well as change the user-defined preferences.
 
✓ Employees: Where you find a company directory like the one you see in 
Figure 3-2. You can click the name of an employee to see more detailed 
contact information, or you can click an e-mail address to send an e-mail 
to that employee.
 
 Every user in your database has an attached Employee Record. 
However, you can also add employees to your database who are not 
users of the Sugar database.
 
✓ Admin: This link is only visible to database administrators; you find a 
bit more about the Administrative settings in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Training: This link takes you to the Sugar University Web site where you 
can download documentation, take a recorded learning session, or sign 
up for a more extensive workshop.
 
✓ About: Click here to find out which version and release of Sugar your 
company is using.
 
✓ Sitemap: Although maps have pretty much fallen by the wayside with 
the advent of the GPS, the sitemap is alive and kicking — at least in 
Sugar country. The sitemap, tastefully displayed in Figure 3-3, shows you 
virtually all the elements of SugarCRM. Click any link and you’re magi-
cally transported to your desired destination.
 
✓ Search field: The amount of information that you can store in Sugar 
might seem overwhelming at times. However, the Search field helps you 
to find any of your information at the click of a button. Type in a name 
and Sugar will scour your database looking for any possible matches. 
Figure 3-4 shows you the results of a search.

34
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
✓ Print: Although it doesn’t appear on the Home page, you’ll see the Print 
link on all the other Sugar modules (refer to Figure 3-4 for an example). 
As its name implies, clicking Print sends a copy of the current module to 
your printer.
 
✓ Help: Context-sensitive help is always right at your fingertips — if you 
click the Help link!
Working with Colored Sugar
If nothing else, Sugar aims to please. There are three tweaks you can make to 
Sugar that, although not imperative, make working with Sugar a bit more fun:
 
✓ Color Changer: Click one of the colored boxes (refer to Figure 3-1) and 
watch as the font colors and borders change right before your eyes!
 
✓ Font Changer: You young’ens in the crowd might not have to worry about 
this, but you old geezers might want to use a larger font (refer to Figure 3-1).
 
✓ Theme Changer: For those of you who are artistically inclined, you 
might want to try some of the themes that come packaged with 
SugarCRM. Located on the very bottom of the screen, a theme can 
change the entire look and feel of Sugar at the click of a button.
 
 Changing a theme also changes various other elements of Sugar. For 
example, the different themes display different shortcuts, module tabs, 
and system links. You’ll also notice that a few of the more “graphically 
intensive” themes will take a bit longer to appear on your screen.
The Module tabs
The Sugar Community Edition comes with 22 modules or elements of the 
program. By default, Sugar displays 12 of these elements as tabs across the 
top of the screen. In addition, the rest of the modules can be accessed by 
clicking the double right-pointing arrows on the right side of the Module Tab 
bar (refer to Figure 3-1). Later in this chapter, you’ll see how to decide which 
tabs to display — and in what order. The object of the game is to click a tab 
to display the corresponding module. By changing modules, other elements 
(including the Shortcuts menu and the Quick Form) will change as well.
The main purpose of a module is to add new information, view existing infor-
mation, and change that information if the need arises. Each module contains 
anywhere from 15–50 fields of information pertaining to that specific module. 
For example, the Contact module gives you fields to input basic contact infor-
mation including name, address, and phone numbers. Chapter 15 shows you 
how to add custom fields to a module.

The basic Sugar modules are:
 
✓ Home: Provides a quick snapshot of your most pressing information.
 
✓ My Portal: Gives you a quick way to access your favorite Web sites from 
within Sugar.
 
✓ Calendar: Where you can view your activities by day, week, or month.
 
✓ Activities: Here’s where you create new activities including:
 
• Calls
 
• Meetings
 
• Tasks
 
• Notes
 
 Although theoretically separate modules, there aren’t separate tabs 
for Calls, Meetings, Tasks, and Notes. They can only be accessed from 
within the Activities tab.
 
✓ Contacts: You can add and keep track of the contacts you keep in Sugar.
 
✓ Accounts: Your accounts are the businesses that you work with. In 
Chapter 4, you discover how to associate numerous contacts with the 
same Account.
 
✓ Leads: Here’s where you add all of your potential customers!

37
 Chapter 3: Finding Your Way Around Sugar
 
 Although not a module, Sugar also allows you to enter Targets or 
Prospects (Sugar uses the terms interchangeably) into the mix. A target 
is the coldest of contacts and is entered through the Campaign module; 
you read more about Targets in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Opportunities: Most companies are in business to make money and 
here’s the place to keep track of all the money you hope to make.
 
✓ Cases: You use this module to help you manage problems or support 
issues your customers are experiencing, or any inquiries they might 
have.
 
✓ Emails: Here’s where you can send and receive e-mail as well as create 
personalized e-mail templates.
 
✓ Bug Tracker: If you’re a manufacturer, this module can help you keep 
track of any product defects although, hopefully, you won’t find too 
many bugs in the sugar!
 
✓ Documents: This is a great module to use if you have a need to share 
documents among your employees. It works particularly well if several 
people are editing the same document — and you need to keep track of 
the various versions.
 
✓ Campaigns: You use this module to track and manage your telemarket-
ing, mail, or e-mail marketing efforts.
 
✓ Projects: You might want to bundle related tasks into a project so that 
you can assign the various tasks to different members of your team, and 
track the progress.
 
✓ RSS: If you’re into RSS (RDF Site Summary) feeds, you can add them here 
and peruse the headlines of your favorite ones.
 
✓ Dashboard: If a picture is worth a thousand words, a dashboard must 
be worth a million. Dashboards give you a graphical view of your sales 
opportunities.
 
✓ Forums: You won’t find this module listed unless your administrator 
installs it for your organization. Here’s where you can create internal 
forums to discuss anything from technical and sales topics to this year’s 
holiday party.
The Last Viewed bar
SugarCRM is designed for busy people; and as a busy person, you probably 
do a lot of multi-tasking. The Last Viewed bar gives you a quick way of return-
ing to the last eight records that you were viewing. The most recent item 
appears on the left edge of the menu, and the oldest item appears on the 
right. You’ll see a little icon to the left of each item that corresponds to the 
module of the item (refer to Figure 3-1).

38
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
For example, you might be looking up the address of one of your employ-
ees when one of your major accounts calls with a new order. You create an 
opportunity but before you can act on it, one of your best customers calls 
with a problem. The Last Viewed bar automatically captures each of these 
records so that you can return to them at a click of a button.
The Shortcuts menu
The SugarCRM Shortcuts menu is located along the left side of the program. 
The Shortcuts menu allows you to move quickly between the various areas 
in Sugar. The Shortcuts menu changes depending on which Sugar module 
you’re in. From the Home page, you see shortcuts for the most common 
tasks, including creating Contacts, Accounts, and Leads, and scheduling calls 
and meetings (refer to Figure 3-1). Switching to the Campaign module will 
result in options that are more “campaign-centric,” including creating target 
lists and e-mail templates.
 
Want a bit more room to spread out? You can hide the shortcuts menu by 
clicking the left pointing arrow at the top of the shortcuts menu. Need to get 
them back again? Click the right pointing arrow.
Quick Form
SugarCRM is the ideal tool for busy people. One of the Sugar tools you might 
like the best is a Quick Form. Using a Quick Form, you can create a new 
record for the module that you’re in. The Quick Form only requires you to 
add two or three fields of information; required fields are marked with an 
asterisk. For example, the New Contact Quick Form (refer to Figure 3-1) only 
requires that you add a last name and the user responsible for the contact. 
Once entered, you can go back to the main module and edit the new record 
to fill in any gaps you might have missed.
Giving Sugar the Preferential Treatment
Although the Sugar administrator is responsible for changing system-wide 
default settings, a number of preference settings are available to the Sugar 
end-user.
Follow these steps to modify your preference settings:
 
1. Click the My Account system link near the top of the Home page.
 
 The User Preferences window opens. Feel free to scroll down this 
window to see all your preference settings.

39
 Chapter 3: Finding Your Way Around Sugar
 
2. Click the Edit button.
 
 You edit your preference settings in the window you see in Figure 3-5. 
Notice that the settings are arranged in a number of panels.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Changing 
the User 
Prefer-
ences.
 
 
3. (Optional) Supply your first, last, or user name.
 
 You probably won’t have to change this unless you’ve recently gotten 
married — or the administrator misspelled your name.
 
4. Change any applicable User Settings.
 
 This panel shows you the privileges and system settings that the admin-
istrator has configured. You can change only some of these settings, 
such as whether you want to receive an alarm for upcoming meetings or 
be able to perform mail merges. The options that you can’t change are 
grayed-out.
 
5. Tinker with the Locale Settings.
 
 This is where you can specify your time zone, how dates are formatted, 
and even the currency you’re using (see Figure 3-6).
  
 Preference settings are specific to the user, which means you might 
be in the good old US of A playing with dollars while your counterpart 
might be in Japan counting his yen.
 
6. Edit your User Information.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-7, here’s the spot where you enter tidbits of info, 
including your title and phone numbers.

 There’s nothing like one-stop shopping. The administrator sets up users — 
and creates an employee directory in the bargain. Here’s where you enter 
your home address if you want to make sure you’re invited to the next 
party.
 
8. Tweak your Calendar Options.
 
 A Sugar database — including the calendar — is meant to be shared. If 
you don’t want public access to your calendar, assign it a Publish key; 
only those with the key will be able to see your calendar.

41
 Chapter 3: Finding Your Way Around Sugar
 
9. Change the Layout Options.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-8, you have lots of options here. This is where you 
can specify the order of the tabs, or even hide ones you don’t want to 
use. You can even specify how many tabs you want to display.
 
 Hiding some modules can have unexpected consequences and make 
other modules not work as expected. You might consider moving 
unused modules to the far right end of the display order instead. 
  
 If the Administrator did not give you access to a module, you won’t be 
able to see it here.
 
10. Set your Email Options
 
 As shown in Figure 3-9, this is where you indicate your e-mail address, 
an additional Reply to address if you have one, and the default e-mail 
client.
 
11. Click Save to save your preferences.
 
 Making changes is only half the fun. You’ll want to save them so you can 
actually use them!

Working with Passwords
When you start Sugar, it prompts you for a user name and password. The 
database administrator is required to assign a password to each new user.
The individual database user can reset his password after he logs in to the 
database. The theory for this is that the individual can pick a password that 
has some meaning to him — and so, hopefully, he doesn’t forget it. If a user 
does forget his password, however, the administrator can reset it; you see 
how to do this in Chapter 16.
Here’s how you reset your individual password:
 
1. From any of the Sugar screens, click the My Account system link and 
then click the Change Password button.
 
 The Set Password dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-10.

2. Fill in your old password in the Old Password text box.
 
3. Type your new password in the New Password text box. Then, for added 
excitement, type it once more in the Confirm Password text box.
 
4. Click Save to save your password.

A
 database is only as good as the records it contains. In SugarCRM, 
adding, deleting, and editing the records in your database is easy. In 
this chapter, I show you how to do all three of these tasks to maintain an 
organized, working database. Because your business — and your database — 
expands, I show you how to link Contact records to Account records, as well 
as promote Leads to Contacts. For the overly zealous members in the audi-
ence, I show you how to get rid of any duplicates — just in case you manage 
to get the same record in there twice. And, if you change your mind about 
how records are added, I show you how to update all the information with 
the click of a button.
Having a Record Is a Good Thing
In this chapter, I show you how to add Accounts, Contacts, and Leads 
records. Before you can add any of these new records, you need to know the 
differences among them.

44
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
An Accounts record is basically a company. Generally, your business does 
business with other businesses — unless of course you mind your business 
and don’t do business with anyone else!
A Contacts record is a person. You’ll probably find that most of your Contacts 
work at a company, so you might want to associate a Contacts record with 
an Accounts record. Sound confusing? You’ll know how to navigate this maze 
after you read this chapter.
A Leads record is a person with whom you are hoping to do business. Like 
the Contacts record, you can associate Leads with Accounts, or you can con-
vert a Leads record to a Contacts record.
Looking at the List View
There’s a lot of uniformity among Sugar modules, which means that when 
you master one module, you’re well on the way to becoming a master chef in 
all modules. You create, view, and edit all records the same way. Rather than 
repeating myself — and probably putting you to sleep in the process — I take 
you through the areas that are similar for all three record types, pointing out 
any differences along the way.
The List view is the view you land in when you click on the Accounts, 
Contacts, or Leads tab. The List view displays all the records in a table 
format. Each record is represented by a line in the table; you click a name to 
drill down to the Detail view. The Account List view is shown in Figure 4-1.
All List views contain the following elements:
 
✓ An indicator on the top-right corner of the List view lets you know 
how many records you have. Only 20 display at a time. To view the next 
20 records, click the right-pointing arrow.
 
✓ You can sort the List view by clicking the appropriate column heading.
 
 One interesting thing to note is that the when you click the Name 
column in the Contact List view, your Contacts records sort alpha-
betically by last name. However, in the Leads view, clicking the Name 
column sorts your Leads records alphabetically by first name. Go figure!
 
✓ The List view contains both a Basic and Advanced Search tab. Chapter 
9 explains these tabs in more detail.
 
✓ You can select records by selecting the check box to the left of a 
record. Alternatively, you can click the Select drop-down button and 
choose This Page, to select only those records that you are currently 
viewing, or All Records, to select all of your records.

Accounting for Your Accounts
There’s an old adage that asks which comes first — the account or the con-
tact? Okay, maybe that’s not exactly the way the saying goes, but you might 
wonder which type of records you should add to your database first. You 
might want to start by adding in your Accounts records; you’ll be able to 
associate any new Contacts or Leads records to them as you enter them.
Adding a new Accounts record
Adding an Accounts record is simple if you follow these steps:
 
1. If you aren’t already in the Account List view, go there by clicking the 
Accounts tab on the Module Tab bar.
 
 Don’t know about the Module Tab bar? Check out Chapter 3, where you 
find out all you need to know about accessing a module and then some.
 
2. Click Create Account from the Shortcuts menu to add a new account 
to your database.
 
 The Accounts window (shown in Figure 4-2) opens.

46
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
Figure 4-2: 
Adding 
a new 
Accounts 
record.
 
 
3. Add the company’s name in the Name field.
 
 This is the only required field — the rest of the fields are optional but 
important never the less.
 
 Alternatively, you can fill in the account’s name, who it’s assigned to, 
and (optionally) a phone number and Web site in the Quick Form fields. 
However, it’s well worth the effort to fill in as much information as 
possible.
 
4. Click the next field you want to add information to and start typing.
 
 You can also use the Tab key to advance to the next field. As I mention in 
Chapter 2, SugarCRM comes with the typical preprogrammed fields that 
are needed by most users. Many of the fields are fairly self-explanatory 
(and reflect the type of information that you probably expect to garner for 
any company): Ticker Symbol, Industry, Annual Revenue, and so forth.
 
 Not seeing the field you want? Chapter 15 takes you on a tour of the 
Sugar Studio where you can add fields to your heart’s content!
 
 
 You can always go back to a record and delete, add, or change any infor-
mation in any field, so don’t worry if you leave a field blank.
 
5. Scroll down.
 
 Seek and ye shall find a few more fields to fill in, such as the ones shown 
in Figure 4-3.

47
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
Figure 4-3:

you find 
all of the 
account’s

 A few features are particularly noteworthy:
 
• Select the Copy Address From Left check box to copy the 
Billing Address information into the Shipping Address if the two 
addresses are the same.
 
• The Email Address(es) area allows you to enter multiple e-mail 
addresses so you can keep track of old addresses that you might 
want to mark as Opted Out or Invalid.
 
6. Click the Save button at the bottom of the screen and, like magic, your 
new Account will be saved for posterity.
Accessing an existing Accounts record
After you enter an Accounts record, you’ll want to view the fruit of your 
labor. Chapter 9 shows you several search options, but for now, you can 
simply click an account name from the Account List view; the Accounts 
record will come to life in all of its glorious detail, as shown in Figure 4-4.
You’ll notice five buttons running across the top of the Accounts Detail view 
(refer to Figure 4-4):
 
✓ Edit: Give this baby a click and you’re able to make any necessary 
changes.

48
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
✓ Duplicate: This will start you on your way to adding a new Accounts 
record; however, certain key pieces of information (including the 
Accounts record’s name, phone numbers, and Web site) will already 
be filled in. Tweak the Accounts record’s name and voilà! — you have 
another division at the same company.
 
✓ Delete: This is the button you click to delete the record. Fortunately, 
you’ll receive a warning notice before Sugar bids adieu to the record 
permanently.
 
✓ Find Duplicates: You find out how to merge duplicates from the List 
view later in this chapter in the “Checking for Duplicate Records” sec-
tion; click this button if you prefer to merge your duplicates from the 
Details view.
 
✓ View Change Log: If you work in a large company, you’re probably used 
to playing “Point the Finger.” For those of you who aren’t familiar with 
the game, this is where information changes — and everyone places the 
blame on someone else. Figure 4-5 shows you the Change Log, which 
tracks every time a user changes information in any of the fields for 
which the Administrator has turned on the auditing property in the 
Sugar Studio.

Accounting for an Accounts 
record’s subpanels
By definition, CRM software helps you track all of your interactions with your 
customers. By scrolling down an Accounts record, you’re able to view sub-
panels with all the associated records linked to the current Accounts record. 
Talk about one-stop shopping.
Knowing the subpanels
The subpanels offer a wealth of information related to the Accounts record, 
including:
 
✓ Activities: See all the Tasks, Meetings, and Calls for an Accounts record.
 
✓ History: View the notes, documents, and e-mail attached to the 
Accounts record.
 
✓ Contacts: Here’s where you can see a list of all the Contacts records that 
are associated with the Accounts record.
 
✓ Opportunities: This subpanel shows you the money — or at least all the 
deals that will (you hope) close and lead to big bucks.
 
✓ Leads: Gaze at your list of leads, cross your fingers, and hope that these 
people will soon become Contacts and/or Accounts records.
 
✓ Cases: Shows you a list of all the customer service issues that have been 
opened on the account’s behalf — along with their status.

50
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
✓ Member Organizations: This is a fancy moniker for Division. You can 
link Accounts records to each other so that you can see the various 
departments from within the Accounts record.
 
✓ Bugs: If you’re a manufacturer, you might want to cross-reference any 
product defects to the Accounts record that was being bugged by 
the bug.
 
✓ Projects: If you’re in the service industry, you’ll find this panel particu-
larly effective; here’s where you can view all the projects assigned to an 
Accounts record — and check their status.
 
Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the various subpanels? Like a good fast food res-
taurant, Sugar lets you have things your way. Notice the tabs running across 
the top of Figure 4-6; you can break the subpanels into bite-sized pieces by 
clicking the appropriate tab so that only the corresponding subpanels display.
 
Figure 4-6: 
The 
Accounts 
record 
subpanels.
 
 
Want to get rid of a panel entirely? You can click the double up arrows at the 
top of each subpanel to close the panel. Need to get the panel back? Click the 
double down arrows to open the panel again.
More subpanel fun and games
Sugar’s subpanels are more than just pretty faces. In addition to viewing 
account-related information, they also let you create new information and edit 
existing information. Talk about a time saver!

51
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
Any changes that you make are forever preserved in the Change Log, so 
be careful what you change — others will be able to see a record of those 
changes!
As you saw in Figure 4-6, the subpanels offer lots of functionality:
 
✓ Create: You can create a new record directly from the corresponding 
subpanel. Need to add another Contacts record? Want to create a note? 
Clicking the Create button at the top of a subpanel takes you to the cor-
responding new record view.
 
✓ Select: You might find yourself in a situation where you’ve added a 
record but forgot to associate it with the main Accounts record. For 
example, you might have added Max Wineburg as a contact but failed 
to mention that he worked at Stone Pony Productions. By clicking the 
Select button, you can navigate to Max’s Contacts record and link him to 
the Accounts record for Stone Pony Productions.
 
✓ Edit: Sugar aims to make your life easy as pie and here’s a great exam-
ple. If you notice an error while you peruse the subpanels, feel free to 
click the Edit link to correct the entry on the fly.
 
✓ Rem: Short for remove, this link allows you to unlink a record from the 
master Accounts record if you feel it’s linked in error.
Contacting Your Contacts
On the very simplest level, the main purpose of SugarCRM is to serve as a 
place to store all your contacts. You can add and edit your contacts from the 
Contacts Detail view — it contains all the information that pertains to one 
particular record and allows you to see all your contact’s fields.
Adding a Contacts record
You probably have lots of contacts that you’re dying to enter into your data-
base, so what are you waiting for? Jump right in and follow these steps:
 
1. If you aren’t already in the Contact List view, click the Contacts tab on 
the Module Tab bar.
 
2. Click Create Contact from the Shortcuts menu to add a new contact to 
your database.
 
 A blank contact record screen opens like the one you see in Figure 4-7; 
you’re now ready to enter the new contact’s information.

52
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
Figure 4-7: 
Adding 
a new 
Contacts 
record to 
Sugar.
 
 
 Alternatively, you can fill in the contact’s first and last name, office 
phone number, and e-mail address in the Quick Form fields. However, 
it’s well worth the effort to fill in as much information as possible.
 
 A very nice Sugar feature is the ability to import vCards (virtual/elec-
tronic business cards). Should a potential contact send you one, you can 
import it by clicking the Create From vCard option in the Contacts Detail 
Shortcuts menu.
 
3. Click the Last Name field and enter the Contact’s last name.
 
 This is the only required field.
 
4. Click the next field you want to add information to and start typing.
 
 Every time you add a new contact, SugarCRM automatically fills in infor-
mation to the Assigned To and Date Created fields. When you add a new 
contact, Sugar inserts your name into the Assigned To field and your 
name and the current date into the Date Created field. The Date Created 
field serves as a permanent record; you can’t change it. However, you 
can override the contents of the Assigned to field if you desire.
 
5. Continue filling in fields.
 
 Most of these are conveniently located in the top half of the Contacts 
Detail view. A few of the fields are a little less obvious:

53
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
• Account Name: This is where you can associate a contact with an 
Accounts record. If you type in the first few letters of an Accounts 
record name, Sugar will suggest an existing Accounts record name. 
Alternatively, you can click the Select button and search for an 
Accounts record name.
 
 
You can associate as many Contacts records as you like with the 
same Accounts record.
 
• Lead Source: If you’re paying for advertising in two newspapers 
or putting a lot of time and effort into your Web site optimization, 
it’s nice to know whether your efforts result in any new business. 
Here’s where you enter just such information.
 
• Campaign: Chapter 13 shows you how to create a marketing cam-
paign, but I give you a bit of a sneak preview here. A campaign 
targets a large group of individuals or organizations. Here’s where 
you can associate a specific Contacts record with a marketing cam-
paign to help you measure the success rate of those campaigns.
 
• Reports To: Corporate food chains are alive and kicking. Because 
it’s not always easy to identify the key players without a scorecard, 
you can associate this contact with his direct superior from the 
same company.
 
• Assigned To: By default, your name appears in the Assigned To 
field. However, feel free to place the name of one of your co-work-
ers here instead if she is responsible for this contact.
 
6. Scroll down and continue adding new contact information.
 
 Many cool contact fields are just waiting for data, and you don’t want to 
miss any of them.
 
• E-mail addresses: Feel free to add as many as you like.
 
• Address: Out of the box, Sugar comes equipped with both Primary 
and Other address fields. If they are the same, select the Copy 
Address from Left check box to copy the Primary address informa-
tion to the Other address field.
 
7. Add your data as uniformly as possible.
 
 One sure-fire way to sabotage your database is to develop new and cre-
ative ways to say the same thing. In Florida, users often vacillate between 
Fort, Ft, and Ft. Lauderdale, resulting in a bad sunburn and the inability 
to find all their contacts correctly. Notice that several of the SugarCRM 
fields contain drop-down lists. In these fields, you can choose an item 
in the list or you can type the first few letters of an item; the field then 
automatically fills with the item that matches what you typed or clicked. 
Chapter 15 shows you how to add — and modify — drop-down lists.
 
8. Click the Save button to save the new contact information.

54
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
The contacts they are a changing
As I mention earlier, there’s a lot of similarity among Accounts, Contacts, and 
Leads records. When you click on a Contacts record from the Contact List 
view, you end up in the Contacts Detail view that you see in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
The 
Contacts 
Detail view.
 
From here, you can edit, duplicate, delete, find duplicates, and view the 
Change Log exactly as you do for an Accounts record. Not wanting to bore 
you, you can read the earlier section, “Accessing an existing Accounts 
record,” substituting contacts for accounts.
Managing subscriptions
One difference you’ll notice between a Contacts and Accounts record is the 
ability to manage subscriptions directly from the Contacts Detail view. In Sugar, 
a subscription refers to a newsletter that you are producing. Chapter 13 shows 
you how to create marketing campaigns — including newsletters — but for 
now, here’s how to make sure your contact is set to receive your literary work.
 
1. Click the Manage Subscriptions button on the Contacts Detail view.
 
 The Manage Subscriptions window (shown in Figure 4-9) springs to life.
 
 The Newsletters Subscribed To box gives you a list of the newsletters 
that the contact is receiving; the Available Newsletters box shows you 
other newsletters that are available to the Contacts record.

55
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
Figure 4-9:

Contacts 
record to a

list.
 
 
2. Drag a newsletter from the Available Newsletters box to the 
Newsletters Subscribed To box.
 
 Alternatively, if you want to remove someone from your mailing list, you 
can drag in the reverse direction.
 
3. Click Save to save your changes.
 
 The Contacts record becomes a part of the Target List that Sugar associ-
ates with a marketing campaign.
 
 It would seem logical that after hitting the Save button to associate a 
Contacts record with a newsletter you’d return to the Contacts Detail 
view where you started. Wrong. However, you’ll notice that the Contacts 
record’s name now appears on the Last Viewed bar; click the name and 
you’ll end up right where you started.
Leads Lead to Bigger Things
Sugar makes a distinction between a Leads and a Contacts record. In Sugar-
speak, a lead is someone that has icicles hanging from his forehead — or at 
least hasn’t started speaking with you in a warm and fuzzy manner about 
purchasing your products or services. A contact, on the other hand, is some-
one you feel you have a great shot at closing — or maybe they’re someone 
you’ve already had some dealings with. In any case, you can always promote 
a lead to a contact when the ice starts to melt from his checkbook.

56
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
Adding a few Leads records 
to sweeten the deal
If you’ve already noted the similarities between Accounts and Contacts 
records, you’re going to feel a very strong sense of déjà vu when it comes to 
working with Leads records. I’ll try not to bore you with any ABC (already 
been covered) information, but I want to point out a few of the subtle differ-
ences between the record types:
 
1. Click the Leads tab on the Module Tab bar.
 
 One interesting thing to note is that the Lead List view alphabetizes by 
first name rather than by last name.
 
2. Click Create Lead from the Shortcuts menu to add a new lead to your 
database.
 
 On cue, a blank Leads record opens and you can commence entering 
your new lead into the window that you see in Figure 4-10.
 
Figure 4-10: 
Adding a 
new Leads 
record to 
Sugar.
 
 
 You probably already know the drill by now, but you can also use the Quick 
Form and fill in the lead’s last name to add a bare-bones Leads record.
 
 Sugar will not warn you if you’re adding a new Leads record that’s iden-
tical to an existing Contacts record. Nor can you merge the two records 
together when you see the error of your way. You have to either delete 
the Leads record or promote her to a Contacts record and then merge 
the two Contacts records together.

57
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
3. Click the Lead Source drop-down field and indicate the source of the 
new lead.
 
4. Click the next field you want to add information to and start typing.
 
 Just like a Contacts record, the only Leads record field that is required 
is the Last Name field. And, just like a Contacts record, every time you 
add a new contact, SugarCRM automatically fills your name into the 
Assigned To field and the date into the Date Created field. Feel free to 
change the contents of the Assigned To field.
 
5. Continue filling in fields.
 
 One difference you might notice is that the Account Name field is not 
linked to the Accounts module, as it is when you enter a new Contacts 
record. The theory here is that if the Leads record is ice-cold, it’s not 
worth adding his company permanently to the Accounts list.
 
6. Scroll down and continue adding new contact information.
  
 Your mantra is consistency!
 
7. Click the Save button to save the new Leads record information.
A promotion is a very sweet thing!
By now, you might be tired of hearing about all the timesaving features that 
are incorporated into SugarCRM. Personally, I don’t think you can ever get 
too much of a good thing.
Converting a Leads record to a Contacts record is ridiculously easy — and 
saves you having to enter all that information a second time. Here’s all you 
need to do:
 
1. Click the name of the lead from the Lead List view.
 
 The Leads record opens in the Leads Detail view.
  
 
Having trouble finding the lead you’re looking for? Chapter 9 shows you 
a couple of ways to find just the record you need.
 
2. Click the Convert Lead button.
 
 The Leads Detail window changes slightly. The top half of the screen 
allows you to edit or add basic contact information including name, 
address, and phone numbers.
 
3. (Optional) Click the Create Note or Attachment link to add a note or 
attachment to the new Contacts record.
 
 Figure 4-11 shows you the expanded window, which allows you to 
include fields to add a note subject and body, and attach an attachment 
if you so desire.

58
Part I: Adding Sugar to Your Life 
 
Figure 4-11:

converting.
 
 
4. (Optional) Scroll down further to the Related Records area of the 
window, select the Create Account, Create Opportunity, and/or the 
Create Appointment check boxes and fill in the appropriate information.
 
 Here’s your chance to add an Account, Opportunity, or Appointment — 
and have it automatically link to the record that you’re promoting. If 
you’re adding a new account, the one you previously added for the 
Leads record will automatically appear. The account phone number will 
also appear based on the Leads record’s office phone number.
 
5. Click Save to complete the transformation from Lead to Contact.
There’s a Whole Lot of 
Updating Going On
Good software helps you manage the more mundane aspects of your life. 
SugarCRM is a great piece of software because it helps make mincemeat of 
your work.
If you scroll to the bottom of the List view, you’ll see the Mass Update por-
tion of the screen. Here’s where you can update all the selected records in a 
click of a button:

59
 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
1. Select the records in the List view that you want to update.
 
2. Fill in the field information that you want to change.
 
 Figure 4-12 shows you the fields that you can update for your Accounts 
records. Updating Leads or Contacts records information gives you 
slightly different choices. Regardless of the record type, you can change 
the Assigned User field. This list draws from the user list of your Sugar 
database. You can type a user name, or click the Select button and choose 
the name of a user.
 
3. Click the Update button.
 
 A prompt appears, asking you if you really want to update the records.
 
4. Click OK to update the records.
 
 The field information will update on the records that you selected, and 
the Account List will show only those records.

Deleting Records
What do you do if you find that you’re no longer doing business with one of 
your accounts? Or that one of your contacts is MIA — or no longer works for 
a company? For whatever reason you decide that a record no longer needs to 
be a part of your database, you can just delete that record.
SugarCRM allows you to delete a single record from the Detail view, or 
selected records from the List view. In either view, clicking the Delete button 
brings up the warning shown in Figure 4-13. Click OK and your records will 
disappear. Forever.

Thinking before deleting a record
Although the procedure is rather simple, you might want to rethink deleting 
records. When you delete a record, you also delete all the associated notes 
and histories tied to that record. For example, suppose that State College uses 
SugarCRM to keep track of all the prospective students it has contacted — 
or has been contacted by. State College admissions personnel receive thou-
sands of inquiries per month and fear that the database will become too large 
to manage — and subsequently think that deleting all prospects that they 
haven’t had contact with in over a year is the best course of action. However, 
some of those prospects might be attending different schools that they aren’t 
happy with and might want to enter State College as transfer students. Other 
prospects might transfer after completing two years at a community college, 
and still others might consider attending State College as graduate students.
What to do in such a situation? You have a few options. Consider moving the 
contacts that you no longer need into another archival database. That way, 
should the need ever arise, you can still find all the original information on 
a contact without having to start again from scratch. How nice to be able to 
rekindle a relationship by asking, “So tell me, how did you find the account-
ing department at Podunk University?” Another option is to change the con-
tact’s status to inactive.
Two warnings before deleting a record
Losing contacts in your database is a very scary thought. You undoubtedly 
rely very heavily on your SugarCRM database; therefore, losing that data can 
be potentially devastating to your business. Worst of all, when you realize 
that you just accidentally removed several — or even hundreds — of records 
from the database, panic can set in!
Avert this panic by following these tips before you attempt to delete any of 
your records:

 Chapter 4: Working with Accounts, Contacts, and Leads
 
✓ Read the warning and make note of the number of contacts that 
you’re about to delete. Don’t be afraid to click Cancel.
 
✓ Remember the three rules of computing: back up, back up, back up! 
Chapter 16 provides you with instructions on how to create a backup. 
A good backup provides the easiest method to restore all your informa-
tion after you accidentally delete it.
Checking for Duplicate Records
It’s a good practice to make sure that a record doesn’t already exist in your 
database before you set about adding it a second time. However, if you real-
ize that a record exists multiple times in your database, you can easily merge 
them from either the List or Detail view.
You’ll probably run across duplicate records while perusing the List view. 
Here’s how you can fix the problem:
 
1. Indicate the duplicated records by selecting the appropriate check 
boxes.
 
 If necessary, you can merge more than two records together, as shown 
in Figure 4-14.
 
2. Click the Merge Duplicates button.
 
 The Merge Records With window opens. The left column shows you the 
data to be kept when the records are merged; the column on the right 
shows what data — if any — will be lost.
 
3. Click the double left arrows next to any data you want to save.
 
 In the example in Figure 4-15, you see that the Industry information is 
different for the two records. If you’d like to retain Communications as 
the industry, click those arrows and the data will copy over to the first 
record’s information.
 
4. Click the Save Merge button when you’re finished.
 
 A prompt appears, warning you that your record(s) will disappear after 
the merge.
 
5. Click OK to continue.
 
 Say sayonara to the old record(s) and howdy to the newly merged 
record. You might even hear a faint Ta-Dum in the background.

Exporting Your Records
You might want to export a list of your records for a number of reasons. You 
might need to give a list of your Accounts records to a mailing house in order 
for them to send out those slick new brochures they’ve created for you. Or, 
maybe you want to share a list of the Contacts records belonging to a trade 
association with a non-Sugar user. Whatever the reason, it’s quite simple to 
export that list by following these steps:
 
1. Select the records you wish to export from any List view.
 
2. Click the Export button.
 
 The window in Figure 4-16 magically appears, making this a foolproof 
operation.

3. Click Save.
 
 The Save As window opens.
 
4. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file and give it a 
name.
 
5. Click Save.
 
 Sugar creates a .csv (comma-separated values) file containing all your 
selected records.

Cooking with 
Sugar

In this part . . .
O
kay, after you whip Sugar into shape (see Part I 
of this book), it’s time to get your life in order. 
The CRM in SugarCRM stands for customer relationship 
manager, which (as the name implies) makes it a great 
place to manage your customers. You can schedule an 
activity with any one of them, set a reminder, and maybe 
add some notes for good measure. (Sure beats the heck 
out of a yellow sticky note!) If you’re working on a special 
project with a customer, you’ll want to track it in Sugar. 
You’ll also want to keep track of your sales opportunities 
so you can add even more customers to the fold. Sugar 
can even help you keep track of the paperwork associated 
with your customer. And, after you have everything 
organized, you’ll want to be able to access all that data 
again from one central location.

I
n this chapter, I show you how to schedule activities with your contacts, 
how to view those activities (and modify them if necessary), and even 
how to find out whether you completed a scheduled activity. You discover 
the intricacies of navigating through the various SugarCRM calendars, how to 
use your Task List to keep you on top of your activities, and the joy of shar-
ing your scheduled activities with others. Finally, you find out how to take 
notes so you can say “hasta la vista” to the sticky notes and paper scraps 
decorating your office.
Actively Working with Activities
One of the most useful of Sugar’s features is its ability to tie an activity, such 
as a call, meeting, or task, to a specific record. Most basic calendaring pro-
grams allow you to view your appointments and tasks on your calendar, 
but they don’t offer a way of cross-referencing an appointment to a record. 
For example, if you schedule an appointment with me and forget when that 
appointment is, you have to flip through a traditional calendar until you see 
my name. Plus, you can’t easily see a list of all appointments that you’ve ever 
scheduled with me. However, SugarCRM offers these helpful features.
In Sugar, you can associate an activity with just about any record type. You’ll 
probably schedule most activities with Accounts and Contacts records, but 
you can schedule them with virtually any type of Sugar record including 
Opportunities, Projects, and even Bugs.

68
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
Creating an activity
You can schedule activities from a number of places in Sugar including:
 
✓ The Calendar module
 
✓ The Activities module
 
✓ The Activities subpanel of any record
 
✓ The Shortcuts menu on the Home page
 
Using different methods to schedule different activities is a smart plan of 
action. For example, I recommend scheduling meetings through the calendars 
to make sure that you don’t have a conflict for a specific time slot. However, 
when you’re scheduling calls and tasks, which are generally “timeless” activi-
ties that don’t have to be set for a specific time, you might prefer scheduling 
from the Activities module where you can view your existing Call List.
 
You might find that many of your individual activities revolve around a single 
goal or project. If this is the case, you’ll want to head over to Chapter 6 where 
you find out how to work with projects. 
 
In an ideal world, you could set up various tasks and have your software 
complete the tasks for you automatically without having to consult your Task 
List. You might then consider Sugar to be an ideal piece of software because 
Chapter 16 shows you how you can use the Scheduler to automate various 
processes, such as following up on leads.
Follow these steps to create an activity:
 
1. Open the Calls, Meetings, or Tasks window.
 
 The three types of Sugar activities are Calls, Meetings, and Tasks. All 
three are scheduled in pretty much the same way. There are two ways 
to get to them:
 
• Click Schedule Call, Schedule Meeting, or Create Task from the 
Shortcuts menu on the Home page, or on the Activities or Calendar 
modules.
 
• Click Create Task, Schedule Meeting, or Schedule Call from the 
Activities subpanel of any record.
 
 Not sure which method floats your boat? Consider creating new activi-
ties from a record’s subpanel. As shown in Figure 5-1, the associated 
Related To field will already be filled in. Better yet, schedule from a 
Contacts record and both Contacts and Accounts records’ information 
will automatically associate with the activity!

69
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
 
Figure 5-1: 
Scheduling 
a meeting 
from a

record.
 
 
 Two additional methods allow you to create calls and meetings quickly — 
albeit in a somewhat abbreviated manner:
 
• The Calendar tab on the Module Tab bar also includes the Create 
Appointment Quick Form (shown in Figure 5-2), which allows you 
to schedule a call or meeting by simply adding a Subject, Start 
Date, and Time.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Scheduling 
a call or 
meeting 
quickly.
 
 
• Clicking a time in the Day calendar view will allow you to schedule 
a call or meeting by simply adding a subject.

70
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 Hopefully, you live by the “no pain, no gain” philosophy of activity 
scheduling and used one of the first three methods.
 
2. Fill in the required fields.
 
 You’ll find the procedures for adding calls, meetings, and tasks to be 
almost identical because all three activity types use just about the same 
fields. Here’s a run-down of the various activity fields — and where you 
find them.
 
• Subject: All activity types require a subject.
 
• Status: Although all activity types include a Status field, it is only a 
required field for Tasks and Calls.
 
• Location: It never hurts to let everyone know, including yourself, 
where the big event will take place. Not surprisingly, only Meetings 
include a location field.
 
• Inbound/Outbound: This option is for Calls only and lets you spec-
ify whether you’ll be placing or receiving the call.
 
• Start Date: Although all activity types include the Start Date field, 
it is only required when scheduling calls and meetings. Feel free 
to click the calendar icon to view a mini-calendar if you need help 
selecting a date.
 
• Assigned To: Scheduling a task is only half the fun; the other half 
comes when someone actually completes the task. The Assigned 
To field shows just who the responsible party is. By default, your 
name will be that person.
 
• Duration: I’m not sure of the logic here, but only calls have a 
required duration; however, feel free to add one for your meetings 
as well.
 
• Related To: The beauty of Sugar is that the various components all 
link together. Here’s where you relate the activity to another type 
of record.
 
• Reminder: Select this check box if you want the system to send a 
reminder to everybody on the list prior to the call or meeting.
 
• Description: Add additional information regarding an activity. For 
example, you might want to add special instructions about the 
items that you need to bring to a meeting.
 
• Due Date: If you’re scheduling a task, you can optionally include a 
Due Date.
 
• Start Time: Enter a start time for the event. Choose 00 for the Start 
Time if you’re scheduling a call or task that doesn’t need to occur 
at a specific time.

71
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
 
• Priority: Although not available when scheduling calls or meet-
ings, this is a required Task field; High, Medium, or Low are your 
options in the drop-down list.
 
3. Click Save.
 
 You have a real, live scheduled activity!
Scheduling a sweet rendezvous
A particularly useful feature of Sugar is the ability to invite other users or 
contacts to participate in a meeting or call. Once invited, Sugar will send 
out e-mail invitations and keep track of the responses, which you can view 
directly from the Call or Meeting window.
To add invitees to the party:
 
1. Scroll to the Scheduling subpanel of the Schedule Call or Schedule 
Meeting window.
 
 Figure 5-3 shows you what it looks like, just to make sure you don’t get lost.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Inviting 
invitees to 
the party.
 
 
2. Enter the invitee’s first name, last name, or e-mail address in the Add 
Invitees subpanel and then click Search.
 
 Sugar will race through your database looking for possible matches.

72
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
3. Click Add to add the name to your list of invitees.
 
 If you’re into appearances, you’ll note that any users you invite to the 
soiree have a slightly different icon than that of a plain old ordinary 
contact.
 
4. Click the Send Invites button to send out e-mail invitations to all of 
your invitees.
 
5. Click Save to save your activity.
 
 The activity includes two sub-panels: invited Contacts and invited 
Users. And, as shown in Figure 5-4, you can see whether the invitee has 
accepted your invitation.

Accessing Your Activities
After you create activities, Sugar is a worse nag than your mother! You 
can see your activities — and Sugar reminds you to complete them — in a 
number of ways:
 
✓ Per record: The Activities subpanel for a selected record enables you to 
see what specific activities you scheduled with that particular record.
 
✓ Per List: Sugar provides you with a Call List, Meeting List, and a Task 
List to let you see your calls, meetings, and tasks.
 
✓ Calendar: The Day, Week, and Month calendars show a listing of the cur-
rent day’s activities. The Year calendar places the date of any day that 
includes a scheduled activity in bold type.

73
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
Viewing the “Honey-Do” lists
Like the “Honey-Do” list hanging from your spouse’s workbench, the various 
Sugar activity lists give you a listing of all the activities.
The lists are readily accessible by clicking the Calendar or Activities modules 
on the Modules Tab bar and then choosing Calls, Meetings, or Tasks from the 
Shortcuts menu, which opens the Call, Meeting, or Task List. Figure 5-5 shows 
you a sample of the Task List.
 
Figure 5-5: 
Looking at 
a very full 
Task List.
 
 
Just as your boss will see red if you fail to complete a task, Sugar displays the 
due date of any overdue tasks in — you guessed it — red.
Quickly printing an Activity List
As great as Sugar is, it can be totally useless if you don’t have access to a 
computer or handheld device. Or maybe you work with a technically chal-
lenged co-worker (your boss?) who prefers to have a copy of her Task List 
printed on a daily basis. No need to fret; Sugar can easily perform this task 
for you. Although these instructions are for the Task List, they work equally 
well for the Call List and Meeting List:

74
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
Unfortunately, the Shortcuts menu will print right along with your Task List. 
To avoid its appearance, you’ll want to close the Shortcuts menu before 
proceeding.
 
1. Click the Print icon at the top of the Task List page.
 
 A new page opens looking pretty much like the page that’s already open.
 
2. Click the Printer icon at the top of your browser window.
 
 With luck, your printer will snap to attention.
 
3. Race to the printer, collect the hard copy of the Task List, and race it 
over to your co-worker’s desk.
 
 I know, you really don’t need to race around but it does make for a nice 
cardio workout!
Viewing the Activities tab
If you scroll to the Activities subpanel at the bottom of any record’s Detail 
view, SugarCRM displays all the activities scheduled with the current record. 
This is a great way to have a list of all the activities you’ve scheduled with a 
contact.
You can see the Activities subpanel for a Contacts record in Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-6: 
The 
Activities 
subpanel.
 
 
You can click the column heading of any column to sort your activities.

75
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
Editing your activities
Like all the best-laid plans of mice and men, activities change, and you need 
a way to make note of these changes in Sugar. Changing an activity is all in 
the click of the mouse. If you can see an activity, you can edit it. That means 
you can edit your activities from the Activities subpanel, the appropriate list 
(Task, Call, or Meeting), or from any of the Sugar calendars.
 
Resist the urge to simply change the date for rescheduled activities. Although 
this is easy enough to do, you might end up losing some key information. Say, 
for instance, that a particularly high-maintenance customer stands you up 
four times — and then complains to your boss about your lack of service. If 
you simply edit the original activity, you won’t be able to document the dates 
of all four activities. You might like to think of this as CYA (um, cover your 
sweet . . .) technology!
Clearing activities
After you complete a task, clearing the task is very important because then Sugar
 
✓ Stops reminding you about the activity.
 
✓ Removes the X in the Close column of the Task, Call, or Meeting List.
 
✓ Changes the activity’s status.
To clear an activity, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Activity List that contains the activity you want to clear.
 
 Again, if you can see the activity you can clear the activity. If you happen 
to be working in the Task List, you can clear the activity from there. Or, 
if you happen to be looking at a record that contains an activity — be 
it an Accounts, Contacts, or Opportunities record — you can clear the 
activity right from the Activities subpanel.
 
2. Click the X to the left of the activity you wish to clear.
 
 The Edit page opens. If you look at the Status field, you’ll notice that it’s 
changed. For example, if you mark a meeting as closed, the Status field 
contains Held. If you clear a task, the Status field changes to Completed.
 
 It might seem a bit counterintuitive, but Open items have an X next to 
them; once completed, the X disappears.
 
3. Click Save to save your changes.

76
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 Don’t hold your breath waiting to hear champagne corks popping in the 
background. You’ll have to be satisfied in knowing that the next time 
you run across the activity anywhere in Sugar, the item will be missing 
the X — and you’ll have one less thing to worry about!
The miniature Task List
Generally, you schedule meetings — and often times, calls — for a specific 
time. These items will then appear to a specific time slot on your calendars. 
On the other hand, tasks have a due date; as long as you complete them by 
that date, the actual completion time is insignificant.
Sugar supplies you with a miniature Task List that appears to the right of 
Sugar’s daily calendar. This Task List provides you with a quick way to view 
your entire day at a glance without having to click elsewhere. The smaller 
Task List provides all your scheduled tasks for a specific day. Figure 5-7 
shows a sample of a Day calendar and its Task List.
 
Figure 5-7: 
A Day 
calendar’s 
Task List.
 
Viewing the various calendars
The various Sugar calendars are great for viewing scheduled tasks. As you 
might suspect, you can view the calendars by clicking the Calendar tab of the 
Module Tab bar. Doing so opens your Day calendar.

77
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
You can view your calendar (any scheduled activities will appear) four differ-
ent ways by clicking the appropriate tab at the top of the Calendar module:
 
✓ Day calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected day 
as well as a listing of the day’s tasks. (Refer to Figure 5-7.) The day is 
divided into hour intervals.
 
✓ Week calendar: Not surprisingly, the Week calendar shows you the 
activities of the selected week arranged in a single column, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Wondering 
about the 
week’s 
activities.
 
 
✓ Monthly calendar: As you can see in Figure 5-9, this view shows you the 
activities of the selected month.
 
✓ Year calendar: Although this view won’t show you any scheduled 
activities, it will show you a calendar of the current year. Click a date to 
launch the corresponding Day calendar. You’ll notice that the dates on 
the calendar that include scheduled activities will appear bolded.
 
✓ Shared calendar: This is a cool feature. Follow these steps to view 
another user’s calendar:
 
1. Click the Shared tab, which launches a slightly different version 
of the Week calendar.
 
2. (Optional) Click Previous or Next to navigate to the week you 
want to view.
 
3. Click the Edit link to open a list of Sugar users.
 
4. Select the user whose calendar you want to view.
 
 If you’d like to view the calendar of several users, hold down the 
Ctrl key while selecting the user names.

78
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
5. Click Select.
 
 You now can view the weekly calendar of another user, or multiple 
users, as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
Figure 5-9:

 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
No matter which calendar view suits your fancy, they all share some common 
functionality:
 
✓ Activity types are represented by specific icons. For example, sched-
uled calls are represented by a telephone icon.
 
✓ Clicking an activity opens the Tasks record in its full glory where you 
can then edit the activity.
 
✓ Hovering your mouse over an activity reveals any additional details 
you might have included about the activity. Figure 5-11 shows you an 
example of those details.
 
Figure 5-11:

✓ Clicking a date in the Week, Month, or Year calendars opens that date 
in the Day calendar.
 
✓ Clicking the Previous and Next links moves you backward or forward 
in a calendar. For example, to view next month’s calendar, click the Next 
Month link located at both the top and bottom of the Month calendar.
Creating Sweet Love Notes
Look around your desk. If you have more than one sticky note attached to it, 
you need to use SugarCRM. Look at your computer monitor; if it’s decorated 
with sticky notes, you need to use SugarCRM. Does a wall of sticky notes 
obscure your file folders? Do you panic when you can’t find your pad of 
sticky notes? Do you have small sticky notes clinging to larger sticky notes? 
You need to use SugarCRM!
What if one of your best clients calls requesting a price quote? You quote 
him a figure from the top of your head — and then promptly forget what you 
quoted him. Or imagine that one of your more high-maintenance customers 
calls you on March 1 in immediate need of an imported Italian widget. You 
check with your distributors and guarantee him one by March 15. On March 
10, he calls you, totally irate that he hasn’t yet received his widget.

80
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
Sound familiar? Creating notes is one of the easiest features to master but 
one that too many users overlook. A simple note in Sugar provides you with 
several benefits:
 
✓ Your entire office can operate on the same page by having access to 
the same client data.
 
✓ You have a record, down to the date and time, of all communications 
that you have with each of your contacts.
 
✓ You won’t forget what you said to your customer — or what your cus-
tomer said to you.
 
✓ You have pertinent information at your fingertips without having to 
strip-search your office looking for a lost sticky note.
Adding a note
Considering the importance of notes to the overall scheme of your business, 
they are amazingly easy to add. Most importantly, notes can be attached to 
a contact in your database. In addition, a note can be attached to most Sugar 
records, including Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities records.
Here’s all you have to do to add a note to Sugar:
 
1. Open the Detail view of the record you want to attach a note to.
 
 For example, if you want to add a note about John Smith, you’d open his 
Contacts record.
 
 An alternative way of adding a note is to click the Activities tab on the 
Module Tab bar, choose Notes from the Shortcuts menu, and then fill in 
the Note Quick Form. Resist the temptation to use this method! As you 
can see in Figure 5-12, the Quick Form does not allow you to associate the 
note with a record type — thus depriving you of the true power of a note.
 
Figure 5-12: 
Warning –
don’t be 
too quick in 
creating a 
note.
 

81
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
 
2. Scroll down to the History subsection of the detail screen and click 
the Create Note or Attachment button.
 
 The History tab expands, revealing the Note input screen shown in 
Figure 5-13.
 
Figure 5-13: 
Adding a 
Sugary note.
 
 
3. Fill in the appropriate information (only the note’s Subject field is 
required).
 
 Although Subject is the only field that’s required, you’ll want to add as 
much information as possible. Some of the information may already 
be filled in, depending on the type of record you started with and the 
amount of information the record contains. For example, if you start 
with a Contacts record that you’ve already associated with an Accounts 
record, both items fill in automatically in the Note input screen.
 
 Sugar makes entering the Contact and Related To fields as easy as pie; 
type the first few letters and Sugar will supply you with a list of choices 
that match. Alternatively, you can always select the appropriate record 
from the drop-down list.
 
4. Click Save to record your note.
 
 Your note will appear on the History subpanel along with any other 
notes you added to the record.
 
As strange as it may seem, Notes is the only module that does not automati-
cally fill in the user’s name who created the note — nor can you add it after 
the fact. Don’t look for a name in the Assigned User column of the History sub-
panel because you won’t find one.

82
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
Working with notes
After you create a note, it appears on the record’s History subpanel. Being 
the astute reader that you are, you might notice that the note’s creation date 
displays as well.
After you create a note, you can work with it in a number of ways:
 
✓ Click the Edit link to the right of the note to edit a note.
 
✓ Click the Rem link to remove a note.
 
✓ Click the View Summary button to view or print a list of your notes, 
including the body of the note.
Working with the Note List
You’ll probably access most notes through the record’s Detail view. After all, 
it’s nice to be able to view all the information relating to a record from one 
location. However, should you want to view all of your notes at one time, you 
can do so from the Note List. Here’s all you need to do:
 
1. Click the Activities tab on the Module Tab bar.
 
2. Select Notes from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Note List, similar to the one in Figure 5-14, opens.
 
Figure 5-14: 
The Note 
List.
 

83
 Chapter 5: Keeping Track of the Sweet Things in Life
You can perform several tasks while in the Note List:
 
✓ Delete a note: To delete a note, you must first select it by selecting the 
check box to the left of the note and then clicking the Delete button. You 
can select as many notes as you’d like. Sugar presents you with a warn-
ing before you remove the note(s) permanently.
 
 Now that you know how easy deleting a note is, you might want to pre-
vent other users of your database from deleting them. If you’re the data-
base administrator, check out Chapter 16 to find out how.
 
✓ Export notes: You might want to share your Note List with other, non-
Sugar users — if those people actually exist! Again, select the note(s) 
you want to export and then click the Export button. You’re prompted 
to give the file a name and location; click the Save button and you’ll be 
the proud owner of a .csv file containing your Note List.
 
✓ Duplicate a note: You might want a note from one contact record 
attached to another record. Or maybe you’re so pleased with the con-
tents of a note that you want to clone it for future use. Luckily, Sugar 
gives you the ability to copy notes:
 
a. Click the subject of the note you want to duplicate. The Notes Detail 
window opens, as shown in Figure 5-15.
 
b. Click the Duplicate button. The Notes input screen appears; notice 
that the fields are already filled in.
 
c. Change the Contact and/or the Related To record type information 
and then click the Save button.

Creating a Project Isn’t 
a Major Project
In This Chapter
▶ Creating a project
▶ Working with Project Tasks
▶ Tracking your project’s progress
T
he Projects module is designed to create and manage projects for your 
organization. Working with the Projects module in SugarCRM is a three-
step process and that’s exactly how I organize this chapter. First, you create 
a Projects record, then you create the individual tasks necessary to complete 
the project, and finally, you track the progress of the project. In addition, this 
chapter looks at the additional tools for the Projects module that come with 
the Professional Edition of SugarCRM.
Adding a Bit of Management 
to Your Projects
You’ve probably been involved in projects of some sort ever since you had 
to create your first science project back in the third grade. By the time you 
advanced to high school, you had probably moved on to group projects in 
which the various members of your group were responsible for different 
aspects of the project.
By definition, a project is a large or major undertaking that usually requires 
many steps. In the business world, most projects resemble your high school 
group projects because several players are needed to reach your goal. But, 
unlike high school group projects, business projects often involve consider-
able money, personnel, and equipment. Additionally, rather than receiving 

86
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
a report card, business projects are often graded by how much money the 
project makes — or loses. Ultimately, a poorly managed project may result in 
hearing those words made famous by Donald Trump: “You’re fired!”
Although Sugar can’t guarantee that you’ll get an A on your report card, it 
can make sure that you stay on top of your projects — and that nothing falls 
through the cracks.
Creating a Projects record
Creating a Projects record is your first step when working with the Projects 
module. You create a Projects record in just about the same way you create 
any other Sugar records, so you might have a vague feeling of déjà vu as you 
follow along the steps:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar.
 
 Expectedly, doing so opens the Projects Home page shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The 
Projects 
Home 
page.
 
 
2. Choose Create Project from the Shortcuts menu on the left.
 
 The new Projects record page opens; you can see it for yourself in 
Figure 6-2.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the Quick Form to create the Projects record 
quickly by supplying only the project name and its start and end date.

87
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
 
Figure 6-2:

record 
page.
 
 
3. Fill in the Projects record’s fields.
 
 Although you can probably do this in your sleep, I want to give you the 
411 on the Projects record’s fields and tell you which ones are required.
 
• Name (required): Enter a name for the project, hopefully one that 
will help identify the project to both you and your co-workers.
 
• Status: From the drop-down list, choose the project status of Draft, 
In Review, or Published.
 
 You might scratch your head wondering about the choices in the 
Status drop-down menu; feel free to skip over to Chapter 15 to find 
out how to change those wacky choices.
 
• Start Date (required): Click the calendar icon and select the proj-
ect start date.
 
• End Date (required): Click the calendar icon and select the project 
end date.
 
 Having an end date prior to the start date doesn’t make much 
sense to anyone, including Sugar. If you try to forge ahead in this 
direction, Sugar will display an error message — and not allow you 
to save the Projects record.
 
• Assigned To (required): Every Projects record is assigned to a 
user. The assigned user is the project manager. Enter the name of 
the user who has ownership of the project. By default, this is the 
user who created the Projects record. The assigned user can assign 
the Projects record to another user if he’d like to pass the buck.

88
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 Although Assigned To doesn’t have the asterisk normally associ-
ated with a required field, it is required.
 
• Priority: From the drop-down list, choose the importance of the 
project (Low, Medium, or High).
 
• Description: Enter a brief description of the project if it needs a bit 
more explanation.
 
4. Click Save to create the Projects record.
 
 You’ll now see the Projects record’s detail page.
 
5. (Optional) Associate the Projects record with other subpanel records.
 
 You can associate a project with multiple Activities, Contacts, Accounts, 
Opportunities, Bugs, and Cases records by following these steps:
 
a. Scroll down to the appropriate subpanel.
 
b. Click Select.
 
 The Record search page opens.
 
c. Fill in the parameters you are searching for.
 
 For example, if you are attaching a Contacts record to the Projects 
record, you might search on last name.
 
d. Click Search.
 
 If there are matches in your database, they appear at the bottom of 
the search page.
 
e. Click the hyperlink of the record you’d like to add to the Projects 
record.
 
 The search page closes, and the record is added to the appropriate 
Projects record’s subpanel.
 
 Unfortunately, you can’t associate a Projects record with multiple users; 
there’s only one project manager, so everyone knows whom to blame 
should things not work as planned. However, you can associate multiple 
tasks to a Projects record — and those tasks can be the responsibility of 
various users, as you’ll see in the next section.
Creating Project Tasks
Projects include lots of minute details that someone — usually you — has to 
take care of. So, after you’ve defined your Projects record, you’ll probably be 
itching to jump into it a bit further to start taking care of business.
You can define multiple Project Tasks for each project. A Project Task differs 
from a plain vanilla Task in that you must associate a Project Task with a 
Projects record.

89
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
To create a Project Task:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar and then choose Project List 
from the Shortcuts menu.
 
2. Click the name of the Projects record to which you want to add a 
Project Task.
 
 The Project Details view opens. Figure 6-3 shows you what it looks like.
 
Figure 6-3: 
The 
Project 
Details 
view.
 
 
3. Click Create in the Project Tasks subpanel.
 
 The new Project Tasks page opens, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
4. Enter information on the Project Tasks page for the following fields:
 
• Name (required): Enter a name for the task. Try something catchy 
like “get this done or else.”
 
• Task ID (required): I’m not sure why, but you need to include a 
number for the task. Guess you can refer to a task by its number 
instead of its name, as in “did you finish your twenty.”
 
• Start Date: Click the calendar icon and select a start date for the 
task.
 
• Finish Date: Click the calendar icon and select the due date for task 
completion.
 
• Percent Complete (%): Enter the percentage of the task that has 
been completed. You’ll want to continue to edit this percentage 
while your task reaches its completion.

90
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
• Priority: Choose a priority level, such as High, Medium, or Low 
from the drop-down list.
 
• Milestone: Select this check box if the completion of this task is 
considered a milestone for project completion.
 
• Project Name (Required): Fill in the name of the project. 
Alternatively, you can click Select and search for the project name.
 
 Although Project Name is missing the asterisk used to denote a 
required field, it is, indeed, required.
 
• Description: If you feel that that name of the project isn’t enough, 
enter a brief description of the task.
 
5. Click Save to create the task.
 
 You return to the Project Detail view where you can add additional tasks 
if necessary.

Managing a Project
After you define your Projects record — and create a handful of Project 
Tasks to help move you along to your final goal — it’s time to kick back 
and relax, right? Wrong! Creating the Projects record is only half the fun — 
now you have to put your nose to the grindstone and start on that project. 
Fortunately for you, Sugar will be with you every step of the way.

91
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
You can edit or delete projects, or even export a list of your current projects to 
a non-Sugar user (if such an animal actual exists) on the Projects Home page.
Here’s how you access the Projects Home page:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page opens. Refer to Figure 6-1 if you want to follow 
along at home.
  
 Click any column title to change the sort order of the Projects Home page.
 
2. (Optional) Pick the Projects record you want to work with by selecting 
the corresponding Select check box.
 
 This will allow you to perform one of the following operations:
 
• Delete
 
• Export
 
• Mass Update
 
3. Click on a project name to edit it.
 
 The Project Detail view opens.
 
4. Click Edit.
 
 You are now free to roam around the cabin — or make whatever editing 
tweaks you feel are appropriate.
 
5. Click Save to save the Projects record changes.
Adding a Professional Touch 
to Your Projects
As I mention in Chapter 1, the three flavors of Sugar are Community, 
Professional, and Enterprise. You might be very content with the functional-
ity of the Sugar Community Edition. However, if your company is involved in 
lots of large projects, you’ll want to move up to Sugar Professional where you 
have access to several additional project management tools.
Passing the project buck
One of the big differences between the SugarCRM Community and 
Professional editions — besides the price — is that the Professional version 
gears itself toward larger organizations. This doesn’t necessarily mean that 
your company is part of the Fortune 500, but it generally means that your 
company has many users that interact with each other.

92
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
By definition, a project is a compilation of many tasks. If you’re the head 
cook and bottle washer of your company — or need to have your head 
examined — then the sole responsibility for most projects rests smack dab 
on top of your head. However, if you’ve learned to delegate — or pass the 
proverbial buck — then you’ll find a couple of the features found only in the 
Professional version to be quite appealing.
Relying on your resources
In Sugar-speak, a resource is a user of the Sugar database; one who can be 
added to a Projects record and in turn be responsible for Project Tasks.
Follow these steps to add resources to a Projects record:
 
1. Click the project’s name on the Projects Home page.
 
 The Projects Detail view opens.
 
2. Scroll to the Resources subpanel and then click Select User to add one 
of your users to the project.
 
 The User panel (shown in Figure 6-5) opens.
 
 Two kinds of resources can be added to a project: Users (people who are 
part of your organization) and Contacts (folks who are not part of your 
organization).
  
 You can only manage resources for projects that are assigned to you.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Adding 
users to a 
project.
 

93
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
 
3. Select the names of the users you want to add to the project (by select-
ing the corresponding check boxes) and then click Select.
 
 The assigned users are now listed in the Resources subpanel.
 
4. (Optional) Click Select Contact in the Projects Detail view.
 
 You can select the names of contacts using the exact same method that 
you do for users.
Taking the team approach
If you’re working with a great big project, you just might need a great big 
team of folks to help you complete it. The Professional version allows you to 
create teams of users who work and play together happily for a unified goal. 
Chapter 14 shows you how to create a team. The Team field appears in the 
Projects Detail view when you create a new project.
Going, going, Gantt!
A company that deals with project management generally will purchase spe-
cial software to help organize the mountains of tasks associated with a large 
project. Most project management software includes the ability to create 
a Gantt chart. A Gantt chart is a chart that graphically depicts the progress 
of tasks and schedules as they relate to a project. If you’re using SugarCRM 
Professional, you can save your pennies because you’re able to create Gantt 
charts directly in Sugar.
 
If you — or someone else on your team — has already invested in Microsoft 
Project you can save a Sugar project in MS Project format. Once saved, you 
can open the MPX file in MS Project. Simply click Export to MS Project in the 
Projects Detail view. When the message appears, opt to save the MPX file.
You create Projects records exactly the same way in both Sugar Community 
Edition and Sugar Professional. However, when you start creating Project 
Tasks, you use Gantt charts — and you have many more ways to track and 
view the progress of those tasks.
Follow these steps to create a Project Task in SugarCRM Professional:
 
1. Click Project on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page appears.
 
2. Click the project’s name in the Project List area of the Projects Home 
page.
 
 The Projects Detail view opens.

94
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
3. Click the View Gantt butto in the Project Tasks subpanel.
 
 You can view your Project Tasks in any one of the following ways:
 
• Grid view: The Grid view displays such details as the task name, 
completion percentage, project start and end dates, estimated 
and actual duration time, dependencies, and assigned resources. 
You can view specific information (such as completed tasks or 
milestones) by choosing an option from the View drop-down list. 
Project managers can edit any task and add additional tasks as 
needed. Users can specify the completion percentage and actual 
duration for their assigned tasks. You can export the project tasks 
to a PDF file by clicking the Export to PDF button.
 
• Gantt view: The Gantt view displays the total time needed for each 
task from start to finish. Figure 6-6 shows you a sample Gantt view.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Sugar’s 
Gantt view.
 
 
• Grid/Gantt view: As you might guess, the Grid/Gantt view is a com-
bination of both the Grid and Gantt views.
 
 You can view a project in Grid/Gantt, Grid, or Gantt view, but you can 
only create and edit Project Tasks in Grid/Gantt or Grid view.
 
4. Click the Grid view button.
 
 Although you can create your Project Tasks in the Grid/Gantt view, you 
might find the Grid view to be a bit less confusing. The various icons 
on the Grid view are labeled in Figure 6-7 to help you with the following 
instructions.
 
 You can also right-click anywhere within the body of the grid to view the 
contextual menu shown in Figure 6-8.

5. Click the Insert Row icon to create a new Project Task.
 
 A new row is added at the end of the grid. Tasks are listed in numerical 
order in the ID column.
 
 To add a new row above an existing row, click the task ID number to 
select that row and then click the Insert Row icon.
 
6. (Optional) Select a row and then click the Indent icon on the toolbar.
 
 Your project might be so large and complex that you need subtasks 
to help you manage it. By clicking the Indent icon, you can make the 
selected line item a subtask of the preceding task. You can then use the 
Expand All and Collapse All icons to view all or some of your tasks.
 
7. Double-click the Task Name cell and give the Project Task a name.
 
8. Add a Start and Finish Date.
 
 A little calendar appears if you click either of the date fields so that 
you can click the date you want. Alternatively, you can type a date and 
ignore the calendar. In any event, Sugar automatically calculates the 
duration of the task.
 
9. (Optional) Specify any Predecessors.
 
 When managing a project you might find that you can’t complete one 
task prior to finishing another task. When you create Project Tasks, you 
can specify Predecessors. For example, if you need to receive inventory 
(Task 1) before barcoding (Task 2), you can specify Task 1 as the prede-
cessor of Task 2.
 
10. (Optional) Choose a Resource from the drop-down list in the Resource 
column.
  
 I know the naming convention seems a bit strange, but Resources are 
actually the users assigned to a project.
 
11. (Optional) Tweak your Project Tasks if necessary.
 
 If you want to delete a task, select the task and then click the Delete 
icon. Or, if you’re adding many similar tasks, you might want to select 
the task, click the Copy icon and then paste the task to another location
 
12. Click the Save icon to save your tasks.
 
 You might be wondering about the last column in the Task Projects grid — 
Actual Duration. That column fills when you actually complete a task.
Creating Project Templates
Many companies experience a sense of déjà vu when creating projects. For 
example, swimming pool contractors might find that all their projects require 
pretty much the same steps in the same order. If you are very lazy — or 

97
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
extremely smart — you might turn to SugarCRM Professional, which includes 
the ability to create Project Templates.
You can create a Project Template for projects with similar tasks. When you 
create a Project Template, you can include the Project Tasks. You can also 
assign resources to a Project Template if the same loyal group of folks works 
on similar projects repeatedly. You can then use the saved Project Template 
to create new Projects records. And, once created, the Projects records you 
create based on a template can be edited exactly like any other project.
The two methods for creating Project Templates are
 
✓ Create one from scratch.
 
✓ Save an existing project as a template.
Cloning existing projects
You might prefer to create a Projects record first just to get comfortable with 
the process. You can then save it as a template after you have the opportu-
nity to fine-tune the project. This procedure is extremely easy:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page opens.
 
2. Select the name of the Projects record you want to copy from the 
Project List subsection.
 
 The Project Detail view displays.
 
3. Click the Save as Template button.
 
 A new page opens, prompting you for a Template name.
 
4. Give the Template a name and then click the Save as New Template 
button.
Creating a new Project Template
As easy as it is to transform an existing Projects record into a template, 
sometimes you need to create a Project Template from scratch. Perhaps your 
company has already created project guidelines which you now need to cap-
ture in Sugar.
Creating a new Project Template from scratch isn’t a whole lot harder than 
cloning an existing Projects record if you follow these steps:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page opens.
 
2. On the Projects Home page, choose Create Project Template from the 
Shortcuts menu.

98
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 The Project Template page opens as seen on stage, screen, and Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Creating 
a Project 
Template.
 
 
3. Fill in the Project Template information.
 
 You need to fill only a few fields. If you fail to add information to one of 
the required fields, SugarCRM has a hissy fit — or at least highlights the 
missing fields in bright red and stops you from continuing until you add 
information to the required fields:
 
• Name (required): Enter a name for the template.
 
• Status: Specify the template’s status (Draft, In Review, or 
Published) from the drop-down list.
 
• Start Date (required): Enter a start date for the project.
 
• End Date (required): Enter an end date for the project.
 
• Assigned To: Click Select to select an individual from the Users list. 
By default, it is assigned to you.
 
• Team (required): Click Select to select a team from the Team List.
 
• Priority: From the drop-down list, specify the project’s priority, 
such as High, Medium, or Low.
 
• Description: Feel free to write a book — or at least add a few 
words — to describe the Project Template.
 
4. Click Save to save the template.

99
 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
Using Project Templates
After you save a template, it is added to the Project Template List. You can 
now edit the template by adding Project Tasks or use it to create a new 
Projects record.
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar to open the Projects Home page.
 
2. Choose Project Templates from the Shortcuts menu to open the Project 
Templates Home page.
 
3. Click the name of the Project Template from the Project Templates 
Home page to open the Project Template Detail view.
 
• Click the View Gantt button to add Project Tasks to the Project 
Template in the same way that you add Project Tasks to a Projects 
record.
 
• Click Save as Project to create a new Projects record from the 
Project Template. A new window opens. Give the Projects record a 
new name, click Save as New Project, and you have a new project 
waiting for you.
Taking a holiday from your project
All work and no play makes most of us pretty cranky. Additionally, having 
two projects to complete at the same time might result in serious damage to 
any small inanimate objects that aren’t firmly attached to your desk.
When you create a Projects record, you may need to take holidays into con-
sideration. The project manager can create a Projects Holiday to account for 
someone’s absence. Any holidays that you schedule appear in the Projects 
Holiday subpanel so panic doesn’t set in when one of your teammates is MIA.
You can schedule a holiday for one of the following reasons:
 
✓ A project team member takes a vacation.
 
✓ A project team member takes time off from one project while working on 
other projects.
Although you aren’t guaranteed an all-expense paid trip to the Caribbean, 
you will have a reprieve from your existing project(s) if the project manager 
follows these steps:
 
1. Click Projects on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page opens.

100
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
2. Click a project name to view its details. 
 
 The Project Detail view opens.
 
3. Scroll to the Project Holidays subpanel and then click Create.
 
 To avoid scrolling past a whole lot of subpanels, you might consider 
clicking the project’s Other tab, which cuts to the chase and just dis-
plays the project’s Resources, Project Tasks, and Project Holidays sub-
panels.
 
 A Holidays form opens, which looks very much like the one shown in 
Figure 6-10.
 
Figure 6-10: 
Taking a 
holiday from 
a project.
 
 
4. Enter information for the following fields:
 
• Holiday Date: Enter the holiday or vacation date.
 
• Description: Enter a description or reason for the holiday.
 
• Resource Name: From the Resource Name drop-down list, choose 
the resource type (User or Contact) who is taking the holiday and 
then select the appropriate name in the second drop-down list.
 
5. Click Save to save the holiday.
 
 The saved holiday is listed in the project’s Holidays subpanel in the 
Projects Detail view.

 Chapter 6: Creating a Project Isn’t a Major Project
Taking a look at the big picture
SugarCRM Professional edition is the flavor of choice among small to mid-
sized businesses. Larger companies thrive on cubicles, trips to the water 
cooler, and reports.
Project reporting is one of the areas in which Sugar shines. Chapter 14 shows 
you how to create custom reports — and you can create a custom project 
report if you wish. This section, however, shows you a couple of cool “out of 
the box” ways to help keep your grubby finger on the pulse of your projects.
Creating Project Resource Reports
One of a project manager’s main tasks is making sure that all the players 
are on task and completing their tasks according to schedule. You can run a 
Resource Report from either the Grid view or the Gantt view. The Resource 
Report displays all the Project Tasks along with other pertinent tidbits of 
information, including the project name, the workload percentage per proj-
ect, duration of each project, and any scheduled holidays. The Resource 
Report not only breaks down a user’s workload across projects but also lists 
the percentage of busy time for each day. This enables managers to better 
evaluate the status of ongoing projects.
 
Resources are either the users or contacts that you have associated with a 
project.
Here’s how to create a Project Resource Report:
 
1. Click Project on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Projects Home page opens.
 
2. Click the name of the Projects record you’d like to report on in the 
Project List subpanel.
 
 The Project Detail view opens.
 
3. Click the View Gantt button in the Project Tasks subpanel.
 
 The Grid/Gantt view opens. If you prefer to work in the Grid or Gantt 
view, feel free to click the appropriate tab.
 
4. Click the Resource Report button.
 
 The Resource Report form opens.
 
5. Choose the user from the Resource drop-down list.
 
6. Click the Tasks That Start or Finish After field and select the start date 
of the report.

102
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 You might find that the field name is a bit confusing — I know I did! The 
purpose of the Resource Report is to view the tasks scheduled to occur 
within a specific time frame.
 
7. Click the And Before field and select the end date of the report.
 
8. Click the Report button to run the report.
 
 The report opens in a new window and displays the daily status, 
assigned Project Tasks, and any scheduled Holidays that occur during 
the specified period. As shown in Figure 6-11 the % Busy column indi-
cates if the user has one (100%), two (200%), or even four (400%) tasks 
scheduled for a specific day.

Chapter 7
Working with Opportunities
In This Chapter
▶ Creating an Opportunities record
▶ Keeping track of your opportunities
▶ Working with Opportunities records in Sugar Professional
I
n this chapter, I lead you through the entire sales process with SugarCRM. 
I show you how to create an initial opportunity, make changes to it while 
a sale makes its way through the sales pipeline, and view your opportunities 
in a variety of ways. And, if you’re using SugarCRM Professional, I show you 
some of the advanced Opportunities functionality.
Creating Opportunities
In SugarCRM, an opportunity is a potential sale to an Accounts record. Each 
opportunity must be associated with an Accounts record. All sales information 
for an Accounts record appears on the Opportunities subpanel of the Accounts 
record. When you create an opportunity, you associate it with a sales stage and 
forecasted close date so that you can see how close you are to closing the sale.
You can associate an opportunity with additional record types, typically 
Contacts and Leads records. You can associate an opportunity with only 
one account, but you can associate it with multiple leads and contacts. 
Opportunities records are often linked to Campaigns records so you can mea-
sure the success — or failure — of a campaign.
After creating an Opportunities record, you can go to the Opportunity List 
where you can see all your opportunities listed together. Additionally, you 
can view the opportunity from any record you’ve associated with the oppor-
tunity. If that weren’t enough, there are a slew of sales dashlets ranging from 
a basic pipeline to a Campaign ROI (return on investment). Whew!
By automating the sales process with Sugar, you have a better chance of 
closing more sales. First, if you follow up on your activities, as I show you in 
Chapter 5, you have significantly fewer contacts falling through the cracks of 

104
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
your database. Secondly, you can adjust your predictions while the oppor-
tunity moves through the sales stages. Most importantly, you can filter the 
Opportunity List (Chapter 9), allowing you to focus on the deals that you 
think you have the best chance of closing.
Initiating the opportunity
Sugar gives you several methods of creating an opportunity, depending 
on which module you happen to be working in at the time. Opportunities 
records can be created with 
 
✓ The Create Opportunity link from the Shortcuts menu on the Home 
module or on the Opportunities module’s Home page.
 
✓ The Create Opportunity Quick Form on the Opportunities module’s 
Home page.
 
✓ The Create button in Opportunity subpanels within Accounts and 
Contacts records.
 
✓ The Convert Lead button in the Leads Detail view; when you convert a 
lead, you also find an option to create an opportunity.
 
✓ The Create Opportunity from Quote button in the Quotes Detail view 
(Professional version only).
For the purposes of this book, I use the first method, but feel free to experi-
ment with the other methods to find the one that works best for you. Who 
knows? You might even find that you eventually generate opportunities using 
all the methods.
So why are you sitting around reading a book? It’s time for you to go out 
there and make some money. Here’s how you’ll make your first million:
 
1. Click the Opportunities tab on the Module Tab bar.
 
 The Opportunities module’s Home page opens.
 
2. Create a new opportunity by choosing Create Opportunity from the 
Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Opportunities record opens, as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
 If you’ve been following along from chapter to chapter, you might 
already be a few steps ahead of me. You are correct in assuming that 
you can simply use the Quick Form to create an Opportunities record 
quickly (albeit slightly abbreviated). And yes, you can scroll to the 
Opportunities subpanel of just about any record and click Create to 
create the new Opportunities record.

105
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
Figure 7-1: 
Creating
 a new 
Oppor-
tunities 
record.
 
 
3. Fill in the pertinent information for the Opportunities record.
 
 Knowledge is power, so the more information you enter about an oppor-
tunity the more power you will have to (hopefully) make the sale. You 
can supply a lot of information here. Although much of this information 
is optional, you’ll find that the little bit of extra effort you spend now to 
enter data will result in huge benefits down the road.
 
 Here’s a rundown of the Opportunities record fields:
 
• Opportunity Name (required): After you create the opportunity, 
you can track it down by searching for its name, so consider 
assigning a name that starts with the company name that you’re 
doing business with or the Purchase Order number.
 
• Account Name (required): Type the first several letters of the 
account related to the opportunity and Sugar will supply you with 
a list of possibilities. Alternatively, click the Select button, and 
click the account name.
  
• Type: From the drop-down list, specify whether the opportunity is 
from an existing customer or a new customer.
 
• Lead Source: Select the lead source, such as Trade Show or Cold 
Call, from the drop-down list.
 
• Campaign: Enter the campaign name or click Select to choose one 
from the Campaigns list if the opportunity was the direct result of 
one of your marketing campaigns.

106

• Assigned To: Enter the name of the user who is responsible for the 
opportunity, or click Select and choose the person from the User 
List. By default, a new opportunity is assigned to you.
 
• Amount (required): Enter the estimated amount of the sale.
 
• Expected Close Date (required): Indicate when you estimate the 
opportunity will close.
 
• Next Step: Enter your next step in closing a sale.
  
 Not happy with some of the choices in the drop-down lists, or not sure 
what information to add to a field? Chapter 15 shows you how to change 
the drop-down items in the various drop-down lists, or add a drop-down 
list to an existing field.
 
• Sales Stage (required): If you’re hearing a nagging voice in the 
back of your head, it’s because I’m nagging you. An important con-
cept in computing is Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO). You want 
to set the sales stage to know where this opportunity lies in your 
sales pipeline so the opportunity doesn’t fall by the wayside.
 
• Probability (%): In this field, you can assign a probability to each 
sales stage when you set up the sales process. Feel free to over-
write the probability percentage based on your hunch for each 
opportunity.
 
• Description: Generally, a database consists of many fields with 
each containing a single piece of information. But sometimes, stor-
ing all your important information into a bunch of teeny-tiny fields 
isn’t possible. That said, you can use the description to write The 
Great American Novel — or at least a few important tidbits of addi-
tional info — about your opportunity.
 
4. Click Save to save the Opportunity.
At this point, you’re essentially done with creating the Opportunities record. 
Sit back and relax a moment while Sugar records the Opportunities record on 
the subpanel of any associated records.
Editing Opportunities records
The Opportunities subpanel provides you with the sales information on any 
given record. You can use the information contained on the Opportunities 
subpanel to create a 360-degree view of a record. For example, you might be 
trying to sell some white widgets to ABC Company. By taking a peek at the 
Opportunities subpanel, you can see when they placed their last order and 
even the dollar amount of their order. Figure 7-2 shows you an example of an 
Opportunities subpanel.

107
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
Figure 7-2: 
The Oppor-
tunities 
subpanel.
 
The Opportunities subpanel serves another important purpose. As your oppor-
tunity progresses, you’ll find it’s often necessary to modify the sales stage.
 
Sales information appears in the various dashlets, so updating your 
Opportunities records is vitally important.
The process of updating your sales information is quick and painless:
 
1. Go to the record of the account for whom you want to track the 
opportunities.
 
 Because you must associate every Opportunities record with an 
account, you might start by going to the Accounts Detail view of the 
account in question. However, because it’s possible to associate mul-
tiple Leads, Contacts, Campaigns, and Projects records, you’ll find the 
Opportunities subpanel on those records as well.
 
2. Click the Edit link to the right of the opportunity you want to view.
 
 The Opportunities record opens (refer to Figure 7-1).
 
3. Change the information as necessary.
 
 The purpose of Sugar’s Opportunities records is to allow you to track a 
potential sale from its inception to its outcome. You’ll want to edit the 
Sales Stage field while the opportunity progresses through the sales 
pipeline. This allows you to view any of your opportunities to assess 
exactly where you stand.
 
 Naturally, you’ll also want to record that you won an opportunity; unfor-
tunately, you might also find it necessary to record an opportunity as 
lost. And — win, lose, or draw — it’s a good idea to change the Expected 
Close Date to the actual date that you closed the opportunity so that the 
information displays correctly on any date-driven sales dashlets.
 
4. Click Save when you finish editing the opportunity.
 
 As usual, Sugar scurries around trying to make life easier for you. The 
dashlets will update automatically and the Opportunity List and sub-
panel will reflect the updated information.
 
 Additionally, you can add contacts to the Contact subpanel that are 
associated with the opportunity. The more accurately you cross-link 
information like this, the more effective Sugar becomes.

108
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
Keeping an Eye on the Prize
You poor reader, you! You work so hard in filling out the numerous 
Opportunities record fields. Knowing that you need a little break, SugarCRM 
rewards you with an abundance of ways to view your opportunity information.
Viewing the Opportunity List
The Opportunity List provides you with a way to view all your opportunities 
for all your contacts. Chapter 9 shows you how to filter the Opportunity List 
to display only those opportunities that match your specifications. You can 
then print the Opportunity List by clicking the Print button at the top of the 
Opportunities Home page.
Getting to the Opportunity List is almost too easy: Just click the Opportunities 
module tab to open the Opportunities Home page. Scroll to the Opportunity 
List to see your opportunities (see Figure 7-3). Notice that the Opportunity List 
comes equipped with its very own toolbar containing buttons that allow you to 
Delete, Export, and Merge Duplicates.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The 
SugarCRM 
Opportunity

 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
Graphically viewing your Opportunities
In Sugar-speak, a dashlet is one of the charts and graphs located on the 
Dashboard Home page. You can monitor the opportunities that you have 
at each stage of the sales development cycle and display this information 
graphically by making use of Sugar’s pre-defined sales dashlets. Whether you 
want to compare the progress of your sales people or measure the success of 
your lead sources, Sugar has a way of giving you the information, as you can 
see in Figure 7-4.
 
Figure 7-4: 
Viewing 
your Oppor-
tunities 
graphically.
 
All you need to do to see all your opportunities translated through the 
wonder of modern technology into a graph is to click Dashboard on the 
Module Tab bar.
For added excitement, try performing one of these neat party tricks:
 
✓ Hover your mouse over any section of a dashlet and a mouse over 
appears that gives you the details of the particular dashlet. 
 
✓ Click on any section of a dashlet and Sugar drills down to the underlying 
data.
 
Chapter 9 gives you more information on working with the Dashboard.

Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
Seeing what’s changed in the Change Log
All record types include a Change Log and Opportunities records are no 
exception. And, because Opportunities records tend to be one of the most 
volatile of all record types, they’re a great way of tracking an individual 
opportunity.
By now, you’re an old hand at opening an Opportunities record using one of 
the following methods:
 
✓ Click the opportunity from the Opportunity List that’s located on the 
Opportunities Home page.
 
✓ Click the opportunity from the Opportunities subpanel of any record 
Detail view associated with the opportunity.
Click the View Change Log button located at the top of the Opportunities 
Detail view and the Change Log will open in a new window, like the one 
shown in Figure 7-5.
 
Figure 7-5: 
The Oppor-
tunities 
Change Log.
 
The Change Log shows you the important milestones for the opportunity, 
such as when it moved from one sales stage to another. It will also detail any 
changes that were made to key fields — such as Expected Close Date and 
Amount — and give you the name of the user who made the change. You can 
click the Print link to create a hardcopy of the Change Log.

 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
SugarCRM Professional Opportunities
So far, this chapter has focused on the Opportunities functionality found 
in the Community Edition of SugarCRM. The remainder of this chapter 
shows you some of the advanced Opportunities features that are a part of 
SugarCRM Professional. Specifically, you’ll see how to add Products to Sugar, 
associate those products with an Opportunities record, and even create a 
quote using those products. If that isn’t enough to get your juices flowing, the 
Professional Edition allows you to e-mail your quote as a PDF file and even 
pull up some nifty Opportunities reports to help you keep track of the entire 
operation.
Producing sugary products
If you’re like most people, you’ll find this part to be fun. Here’s where you get 
to count the cash, bill for the beans, dream of the dollars . . . In any event, the 
Products module is where you get to add all of the products and/or services 
that you sell. Once added, you can add the product line items to a quote for 
your opportunity and sit back while Sugar crunches the numbers for you.
The Products module helps you to create and manage products for your 
company. You can either select an item from the product catalog, or create a 
new product that is not in the product catalog.
Sounds like a job for the Administrator!
If you happen to find yourself wearing the Database Administrator hat, you’ll 
need to read this section — and possibly asks for a raise and/or a corner 
office. If you aren’t a database administrator, feel free to skip this section 
unless you’re wondering what the administrator does to deserve a raise or a 
corner office.
The database administrator is responsible for several very important prod-
uct areas. You’ll want to make sure that he’s doing the job before you set 
your users loose on the Products module in SugarCRM Professional.
The administrator defines all the products, product types, categories, and 
manufacturer information within Sugar. If your organization doesn’t maintain 
a product catalog or if users need to create a product that isn’t in the cata-
log, you can create a freestanding product. However, freestanding products 
aren’t added to the product catalog.
 
You can have more than one administrator for a Sugar database. If you have 
lots of users and only one administrator, you might consider letting another 
user share the fun — and responsibilities — of being an administrator.

112
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
You can enter into the land of Administrative Products by using either of the 
following methods:
 
✓ Click the Admin system link at the top of any Sugar page and then click 
Create Product from the Shortcuts menu shown in Figure 7-6.

Manufacturing Manufacturers
For centuries, man has contemplated his navel and the age-old question of 
which comes first — the product, the catalog, or the manufacturer. Okay, 
maybe that discussion was about eggs and chickens, but I’m going to veer 
slightly from the order of the Shortcuts menu and start by adding some of the 
simpler Products elements:
 
1. Click Create from the Manufacturers Home page.
 
 The Manufacturers Home page expands to show you the new Manufac-
turers record. Figure 7-8 gives you a good idea of what all this looks like.
 
2. Enter the manufacturer information.
 
 When I say I like to start simple, I mean just that. You have only three 
fields to fill in here:
 
• Manufacturer: Enter the manufacturer’s name.
 
• Status: Select Active to add the name to the manufacturer’s drop-
down list.

113
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
• Order: Enter a number to specify the order in which the manufac-
turer will display in the manufacturer’s drop-down list.
 
3. To create the manufacturer, click Save; to create another manufac-
turer, click Save & Create New.

Typecasting your products
When you first start creating a product list in Sugar, it seems fairly simple: 
create a product or two and you’re off and running. However, as you add 
more and more products, your list can become more and more disorganized. 
Adding product types is an easy way to control the chaos.
Here’s all you need to do to add a product type:
 
1. Click the Create button in the Product Type List subpanel.
 
 The Product Types Home page opens, as shown in Figure 7-9.
 
 Not sure how to get there? The easiest way is to click Product Types in 
the Products and Quotes subpanel of the Administration Home page.
 
2. Enter information into the following fields:
 
• Product Type: Enter a name for the new product type. You might 
want to divide your products into Retail and Wholesale, or include 
various types of services.
 
• Description: Enter an optional description for the product type.

114
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
• Order: Enter a number to specify the order in which the product 
type will appear in the Product Type drop-down list.
 
3. Click Save to save the Product Type, or click Save & Create New to 
create another product type.
 
Figure 7-9:

Product 
Types.
 
Categorizing your products
It’s good to walk before you run, look before you leap — and enter in the vari-
ous product parameters before you delve too deeply into the exciting world 
of product management.
After you have the feel for adding product types and manufacturers, you’re 
ready to start thinking about how your products will be categorized.
 
1. Click the Product Categories option in the Product and Quotes sub-
panel on the Administration Home page.
 
 Just try saying that instruction five times fast! While you tie your tongue 
in circles, the Product Categories Home page opens (see Figure 7-10).
 
2. Click the Create button on the Product Categories Home page.
 
 The Product Category subpanel displays fields to let you create a new 
product category.

115
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Product 
Categories 
Home page.
 
 
3. Enter information for the following fields:
 
• Product Category: Enter a name for the category. You can have 
parent categories and subcategories. And, if you really want, you 
can have subcategories of your subcategories. For example, you 
might sell red, white, and blue widgets. You could set up Widgets 
as the first category before setting up the additional categories of 
Red, White, and Blue.
 
• Parent Category: Here’s where you can sculpt your product hier-
archy. In the widget example above, you could indicate Widgets 
as the Parent category when setting up the Red, White, and Blue 
products by clicking Select to choose the parent from the Product 
categories. Figure 7-11 shows you a sample of the hierarchy that 
appears when you click Select.
 
• Description: Enter a brief description of the category.
 
• Order: Enter a number to specify the order in which this category 
will appear in the Product Category List. I’m not sure how why, but 
this is a required field — and conceivably all your product types 
can have the same order number.
 
4. Click Save to create the category or click Save & Create New to create 
another category.

Giving the taxman what he’s owed
The only certainties in life are death and taxes — or so I’m told — and I’m 
fairly certain that if you sell products you’re going to have to pay taxes on 
them somewhere down the line. Sugar takes the bitter edge off taxes by pro-
viding you with a handy dandy way of configuring the various tax jurisdic-
tions you deal with.
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page, scroll down the Administration Home 
page to the Products and Quotes subpanel, and then click Tax Rates.
 
 The Tax Rate Home page opens, as shown in Figure 7-12.
 
2. Click Create.
 
3. Fill in the required fields.
 
 Actually, all the fields are required but don’t worry — there’s only four 
of them. Kind of ironic that something as complicated as taxes (at least 
according to the bill I receive every year from my accountant) is so easy 
to set up.
 
• Tax Rate Name: Give the Tax Rate a catchy name; you might find 
that the name of the appropriate state works rather well.
 
• Percentage: Add in the tax percentage.
 
• Status: Choose Active from the drop-down list to display the rate in 
the appropriate areas of Sugar.
 
• Order: Enter a number to specify the order in which the tax rate 
will display in the Tax Rate drop-down list.
 
4. Click Save to save the tax rate.

117
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
 For additional fun and excitement, you might prefer to click Save & 
Create New if you want to save this tax rate and create a new one.

Sending your products via carrier pigeon
Sometimes it seems as though Sugar has thought of everything. Granted, 
it hasn’t thought of a way to help me win an argument with my significant 
other, but it sure makes life easy when running a business.
Unless people are coming to you to pick up all their purchases in person, 
you’ll probably need to have a method of delivering your products directly to 
their fat, little fists. Here’s how you can set up the shipping methods:
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page to open the Administration Home 
page.
 
2. On the Administration Home page, scroll to the Product and Quotes 
subpanel and click Shipping Providers.
 
 The Shipping Provider Home page opens.
 
3. Click Create.
 
 The Shipping Provider Home page expands to include the Shipping 
Provider page, as shown in Figure 7-13.
 
4. Fill in the Shipping Provider fields, all of which are required.
 
• Shipping Provider: Enter the name of the shipping provider.
 
• Status: Choose Active from the drop-down list so that you can actu-
ally use the shipping method.

118
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
• Order: Enter a number to specify the order in which the name will 
display in the Shipping Provider drop-down list.
 
5. Click Save to save your new shipping method for posterity.
 
Figure 7-13: 
The 
Shipping 
Provider 
Home page.
 
Producing a Catalog
In Sugar, you don’t actually create a catalog. Rather, any products that the 
administrator adds are automatically placed into the Catalog and grouped by 
product types. The Catalog List allows the administrator to keep track of how 
much inventory she has on hand as well as other important tidbits of infor-
mation, including the cost and price of each item.
After you’ve done all the initial setup, you’re ready to start entering your wid-
gets, gadgets, and other products into the product catalog:
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page to open the Administration Home page.
 
2. Choose Create Product from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Product Catalog page opens. If you prefer, you can also scroll down 
the Administration Home page to the Products and Quote subpanel, 
click Product Catalog, and then choose Create Product for Catalog from 
the Shortcuts menu, but I was always taught that the shortest distance 
between two points is a single click.
 
3. Enter the product information into the various fields.
 
 You might start to see the method to my madness. Many of the areas 
that you had set up previously, such as Manufacturer and Category, will 
now be available to you. The thing to remember here is that you are 

119
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
actually creating a catalog of your products. By that, I mean that in addi-
tion to adding information about your product, you’re adding informa-
tion that will help you with reporting and tracking later.
 
 There are lots of fields to enter here, but I want to share a few of the 
more important ones with you:
 
• Product Name (required): Enter the name of the product.
 
• Category: Click Select to choose the category to which the new 
item belongs.
 
• Date Available: If this is a new product, you might want to indicate 
exactly when it’s going to be available to your adoring fans.
 
• Quantity in Stock: I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty disap-
pointed when I order something — only to learn that it’s out of 
stock.
 
• Tax Class: Choose the appropriate option from the drop-down list 
to specify whether the item is taxable.
 
• Manufacturer: Choose the manufacturer of the item from the drop-
down list.
 
• Cost (required): Enter the cost price of the item. This price will not 
appear in quotes.
 
• List Price (required): Enter the list price of the item.
 
• Discount Price (required): Show the discounted price; if you don’t 
offer discounts, just enter the List Price.
 
4. Click Save to save your product to the product catalog.
Creating a product using the Products module
 
Products set up using the Products module are not part of the product cata-
log. For that reason, it’s probably a better idea to let the administrator deal 
with setting up products and let the users sell the products.
The Products Home page typically lists products that you create but not 
those from the product catalog. However, when you create a quote from the 
product catalog, the products in the quote are automatically added to your 
Products List.
One reason you may want to set up products from the Products module is 
that you can also associate a product with an Accounts record. This enables 
you to view and edit the product from the Accounts’ Detail view. This func-
tionality is helpful if you manufacture specific items for specific accounts.
Follow the bouncing ball to create a product from the Products module:

120
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
1. Click the Products module tab on the Home page.
 
 The Products Home page opens.
 
2. Click Create Product on the Products Home page.
 
 The Products page opens.
 
3. Enter information for the fields on the Products page.
 
 If you’ve been following along at home, you might think that this form is 
slightly different from the form you see when you create a product from 
the product catalog. Smart reader! Although the fields are fairly similar, 
they are arranged a wee bit differently. And, if you really want to be lazy, 
only one field — Product Name — is required. Either you can feel sorry 
for the administrator who was required to add more fields, or you can 
roll up your sleeves and start entering information.
 
 One of the problems with being lazy is that you might inadvertently 
enter default information into some of the non-required fields. For exam-
ple, the Manufacturer and Product Type fields auto-populate with the 
first item that appears on their drop-down lists.
  
 You might see Product fields that you just plain don’t need. For example, 
the Support fields show when support starts and expires. You can opt to 
leave those fields blank — or flip over to Chapter 15 where you find out 
how to edit and/or delete those fields.
 
4. Click Save to create the product.
Adding a touch of product management
If you’ve hung in there during the entire Product section, you deserve a gold star 
on your forehead — and to make lots of money in the future. At last, your hard 
work is over and you can sit back and relax. First, however, you might want to 
tear yourself away from the golf course for a minute and review some of the neat 
things you can do with your products — besides sell them, of course!
As you might have guessed, you’re able to see a list of your products from 
the Product List that you access by clicking Products on the Module Tab bar.
 
Not seeing all of your products? Items that the administrator added to the prod-
uct catalog will not appear in the Product List until you use them in a quote.
You can manage your opportunities directly from the Product List in a 
number of ways:
 
✓ Sort: Click any column title to sort the List view.
 
✓ Delete: Select a product and then click Delete to delete it.
 
✓ Edit: Click a product name in the list to view the details of the product. 
Once there, you can click Edit to edit the product details.

121
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
✓ Duplicate: Click Duplicate in the Product Detail view. This is a great 
timesaver if you have a lot of similar products, such as pink, magenta, 
and chartreuse widgets; click Duplicate, stick in a new product name, 
and you’re good to go.
 
✓ Export: Select the products you want to export and then click Export to 
export a list of your products to Excel.
You can quote me on that
Wouldn’t it be lovely if all your customers simply picked up the phone, placed 
an order, and ka-ching — the money was in the bank. Dream on! Many — if not 
all — of your customers are going to require, request, and/or demand that you 
send them a quote before they send you the money. If that’s the case with your 
business, you’ll want to use the Quotes module that comes with SugarCRM 
Professional.
Quickly creating quotes
The Quotes module lets you create, view, and manage quotes for your organi-
zation. When you create a quote, you can select a product from the product 
catalog, or you can manually enter information on products that aren’t in the 
catalog. Quotes specify the quantity and the price per unit for the products 
and services that you sell to a customer. When you select from the catalog, 
the system automatically fills in information, such as the manufacturer’s 
number and tax class.
 
1. Choose Create Quote from the Home page’s Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Quotes page opens. The top half of a Quotes page is shown in 
Figure 7-14.
 
Figure 7-14:

122

 Alternatively, you can click Quotes on the Module Tab bar and use the 
Create Quote Quick Form displayed below Shortcuts. This form contains 
only the required fields. However, you can add information after you 
save the form. 
 
2. Enter information into the fields on the Quotes page.
 
• Quote Subject (required): Give the quote a name that will make it 
easy to identify.
 
• Quote Number: You can be lazy here because Sugar will assign a 
number automatically.
 
• Purchase Order Num: Enter the P.O. number if you have one.
 
• Payment Terms: Choose the customer’s payment terms from the 
drop-down list.
 
• Team (required): Enter the name of the team that is allowed to 
view the Opportunities record.
 
• Assigned To: Add the name of the individual who is working on the 
Opportunities record.
 
• Opportunity Name: Here’s where you can associate an existing 
Opportunities record with a quote.
 
• Quote Stage (required): Choose the current stage from the drop-
down list.
 
• Valid Until (required): Click the calendar icon and select an expi-
ration date.
 
• Original P.O. Date: Click the calendar icon and select the Purchase 
Order date.
 
3. Add information to the Bill to and Address Information subpanels, as 
shown in Figure 7-15.
 
 You must associate every quote with a Billing Account. Happily, any 
address information you have on record for the account will automatically 
fill in to the billing address information. Select the Copy Address From 
Left check box if the shipping address is the same as the billing address.
 
4. (Optional) Add the basic Line Items information.
 
 You can cram a lot of information into the Line Items subpanel; follow along 
so you won’t get lost. You start by filling in a few non-required fields:
 
• Currency: Choose the currency used in the quote from the drop-
down list.
 
• Tax Rate: Choose the tax rate for the account from the drop-
down list.

123
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
 
• Shipping Provider: Choose a shipping provider from the drop-
down list.
  
 The administrator defines the currency, tax rate, and shipping provider 
information that display in the drop-down lists.
 
• Grand Total: Check this box if you want Sugar to get out its abacus 
and add up all the products you include in the quote.
 
• Line Numbers: Check this box if you want to number your products 
when you save the quote in PDF format.

• Enter a name for the product group in the Group Name field. All 
products must be in a group in the quote.
 
• Choose the status of the group from the Group Stage drop-down list. 
For example, you might have a group of products that are backor-
dered; you would place them all in the Backordered status.
 
6. Click the Add Row button.
 
 This allows you to enter your first product within the group. Now the 
fun begins and some of your long hours of setup start to pay off — you 
add your products to the Quote. For each row, add the following prod-
uct information:
 
• Quantity: Enter the quantity that you’re quoting.
 
• Product: Enter the product name or click Select to select it from the 
product catalog.
 
• Description: Add a description of the product if desired.
 
 Sugar will automatically enter information for the remaining fields — 
Mft Num, Tax Class, Cost, List, and Unit Price — if you select an item 
from the catalog that contains this information. If not, feel free to 
add it manually.
 
 The cost price doesn’t display in the quote you e-mail customers.
 
 You can’t modify the pricing information of products you added directly 
from the product catalog. However, you can modify the pricing for items 
that you manually enter into Sugar.
 
7. Add additional Groups and/or rows.
 
 Typically, you continue to add products to the group you create in Step 
5. However, you might want to have more than one group on the quote 
to help distinguish between different types of products or services. 
For example, if you offer both products and services, you might have 
a Products group showing the products you’re selling, and a Services 
group showing the services you’ll render.
 
8. Click Save to create the new quote.
 
 After you save the quote, the system displays the Quotes Detail view. 
You can also find the quote listed on the Quotes List.
Creating a PDF of a quote
Sugar treats a quote exactly like any other record. You can edit, duplicate, 
and delete a quote directly from the Quotes Detail view. You can also create 
Activities, History, Projects, and Contracts from the Quotes Detail view that 
are then associated to the Quote. If you’re not sure how to perform these 

125
 Chapter 7: Working with Opportunities
wondrous tasks, flip back to Chapter 4, which focuses on creating Contacts, 
Accounts, and Leads records.
One cool thing you can do with a quote that you can’t do with other records 
is to convert it to a PDF. You can then print the PDF or e-mail it directly to the 
customer. And of course, Sugar lets you do all this PDF (pretty darned fast!).
 
1. Click the Quotes module tab on Sugar’s Home page.
 
 As expected, the Quotes Home page opens.
 
2. Click the quote name to open it.
 
 The Quotes Detail view springs open.
 
3. Click the Print as PDF button and then click Open in the dialog 
window that appears.
 
 A PDF version of your quote opens in Adobe Reader (see Figure 7-17). 
Try to avoid jumping up and down in delight because your cubicle 
mates might look at you strangely. From here, you can save the PDF and 
attach it to an e-mail, or you can print it, squeeze it into an envelope, 
and send it on its way via US Snail Mail.

 The only modification that you can make to the quote template is to add 
your logo to it. Chapter 16 shows you how.
 
4. Close Adobe Reader.
 
 You’ll end up right back where you started — in the Quotes Detail view.
 
5. Click the E-mail as PDF button.
 
 The E-mail page opens with an e-mail message already addressed to 
the contact that is linked to the quote. And even better, the subject and 
body of the e-mail are filled in as well (which of course you can edit if 
necessary).
 
6. (Optional) Click the Options button on the e-mail icon bar and select a 
different e-mail template.
 
 If you’ve read Chapter 12, you might have set up some e-mail templates. 
Feel free to choose one of them from the Templates drop-down list.
 
7. Click Send and your e-mail — with the attached quote in PDF form — 
will hurtle through cyberspace on its way to Mr. or Ms. Customer.

Working with Documents
In This Chapter
▶ Adding documents
▶ Viewing documents
▶ Checking out documents
▶ Working with multiple document versions
T
he Documents module is the module you turn to when you want to share 
documents with the rest of your company. You can use the Documents 
module to store, share, and supervise the versions of your documents. And, 
just like with a traditional library, you can decide who is allowed to check out 
documents — and monitor what kind of shape the documents are in when 
they return.
Creating Your Documents with 
the Documents Module
If you’ve ever tried to e-mail a large attachment to a colleague, you know that 
a seemingly easy task can run into a whole bunch of snags. The file might be 
too big to get past your ISP or, if you can send it out, it might be too big for 
your recipient’s ISP. If the file is large, it might take a long time to transmit — 
during which you’re unable to receive any other e-mail. Your recipient might 
have a spam blocker, or his company might have e-mail policies that prohibit 
receiving file attachments.
By using the Document List, you can create a library of documents and 
graphics that can be shared by all members of your staff. For example, you 
might be collaborating with a colleague who works from home on a brochure. 
Or perhaps you’re building a custom-ordered widget for your best customer 
and want to share the specs and some sketches of the final product with your 
boss who’s vacationing in Botswana. By placing documents and graphics in 
the Document List, you — and anyone else you authorize — can view files 
whenever and wherever needed.

128
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
You can find the Documents module — and add a few documents to the 
Documents List — by following these steps:
 
1. Click Documents on the Module Tab bar.
 
 As you’d expect, the Documents Home page opens. Don’t just take my 
word for it — view it for yourself in Figure 8-1.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
Documents 
Home page.
 
 
2. Choose Create Document from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Documents form opens. You might be surprised at the number of 
fields you see here. The only required fields are the document name, the 
publish date, the revision number, and the file itself.
  
 No pain no gain! The more information you enter now, the more orga-
nized you’ll be in the future.
 
3. On the Documents form, enter information for the following fields:
 
• Document Name: Enter a name for the document. It doesn’t have to 
be the same as the actual filename.
 
• File Name: Click Browse to navigate to the location of the docu-
ment file and then click Open to add it to the Document form. The 
form will not reflect the path and filename.
 
 If you leave the Document Name field blank, it will automatically fill 
with the filename.
 
• Revision: Enter the revision number; if you’re adding a document 
for the first time, type in 1.

129
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
 
• Template: Select this box if you are creating a template to be used 
in merges.
 
• Document Type: Choose a pre-defined document type from the 
drop-down list. Just like a library makes use of a filing system, this 
is a great way to help keep those documents organized if you’re 
planning on housing a lot of them. At the very least, you might 
want to differentiate your templates from your pictures from your 
sound bites.
  
 If you’re less than thrilled with the options in the drop-down list, 
you’ll want to go Chapter 15 where you discover how to change 
those options.
 
• Category: Choose a category from the drop-down list. If you’re 
groaning at all these fields, just remember that the Dewey Decimal 
System contains more than one number. Here’s where you 
might group documents, such as Marketing Materials and FAQ’s 
(Frequently Asked Questions).
 
• Sub Category: If you selected a category, select the category subset 
if possible. If you add a category and subcategory for the docu-
ment, you create a document tree, which helps you to organize 
files and find documents.
 
• Status: Choose the status from the drop-down list to indicate the 
current state of the document. Consider using choices such as 
Draft, Under Review, and We’ve Got a Winner.
 
• Publish Date: Click the calendar icon to memorialize the date of the 
download.
 
• Expiration Date: Like milk sitting too long in your refrigerator, it’s 
good to have an expiration date. For example, a brochure for an 
April sale loses its potential on May 1.
 
• Related Document: Click Select to associate a related document. 
The window you see in Figure 8-2 opens, revealing the documents 
you’ve already downloaded to Sugar. Click the appropriate docu-
ment name to associate it with the current document.
 
• Related Document Revision: Choose the revision number of the 
associated document from the drop-down list; if only one revision 
of the document exists, you’ll only have the choice of one number.
 
• Description: Enter a description of the document just in case the 
document name and filename don’t do the trick.
 
4. Click Save to add the document to your Sugar database.
 
 Sugar actually clones the document and adds it to Sugar. You can 
delete the original document if you want without worry because 
the cloned copy remains safely in Sugar.

Dealing with Your Documents
After you add documents and graphics to the Documents module, you’ll 
probably find it even more useful than the local library. You can view your 
files, save a copy to your desktop, create updated versions, and even send 
them to your adoring masses.
Any file that you attach when you create a document displays on the Document 
List subpanel of the Documents Home page for your viewing pleasure.
Accessing your documents
For your first trick, you’ll want to learn how to access files. If you’re thinking 
that you’ll have to paperclip this page for future reference you’re wrong — 
unless you just want to keep reminding yourself how easy it is to work with 
the Sugar Documents module.
 
1. Click Documents on the Module Tab bar.
 
2. Choose Documents List from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Documents Home page opens, complete with the Document List 
subpanel. This list works exactly like all the other lists sprinkled 
throughout Sugar, so you can sort the List view or even delete selected 
documents.

131
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
 
3. Click the name of the saved file.
 
 For your convenience, the document names appear as hyperlinks, so 
you know something cool will happen when you click one of them. In 
this case, the Documents page opens, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
The 
Documents 
page.
 
 
 Notice our good friend the Duplicate button on the top of the page. 
Duplication is particularly popular among the smart and lazy of the 
crowd. After you create a prize-winning document — or at least one that 
you’re happy with — you can duplicate the document, make a few minor 
changes, save the document again with a different name, and voilà! — 
new document.
 
4. Click the file that you want to see.
 
 You find out how to make document revisions in the next section, but I 
want to give you a preview of how this is going to play out. You’ll notice 
a file name; that represents the most current version of the file. However, 
you’ll also notice the Document Revisions subpanel, which shows you 
all versions of the document. And, Sugar very sweetly marks them with a 
date and time stamp so you can view any of the versions. Usually, you’ll 
just click the filename, but if you need to see the original document or 
one of its earlier updates, you can click those as well. In all cases, the 
File Download window will open.
 
5. Click Open to view the document immediately, or Save to save the 
document.

132
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 If you open the document, it will open immediately. At this juncture, you 
can edit the document exactly how you would any other document. And, 
you can save your changes.
 
 If you’re going to be loading your changes back into Sugar, you’ll want 
to save the document as a different name. Sugar, helpful as always, 
suggests a name change for you; if the original document was called 
myfile.doc, Sugar will automatically suggest myfile(2).doc as the 
new name.
 
Sugar gives you tons of software functionality but it can’t give you licenses 
for software that you don’t own. If one of your users uploads an Excel spread-
sheet — and you don’t own a copy of Excel — you won’t be able to view that 
document. You need to have a copy of the software originally used to create a 
document loaded on to your computer before you can view the document.
Verifying your versions
Sharing documents is a great timesaver, particularly for those of you 
who often work from remote locations. Very often, just being able to down-
load and review a document is enough to make you a very happy — and 
productive — camper.
However, hosting shared documents opens a whole other can of worms. 
For example, two employees are collaborating on new sales materials from 
separate, remote locations. They both download copies of the same docu-
ment and make changes to it. The first employee uploads the document to 
the library when she is finished. An hour later, the second leader uploads his 
copy of the document to the library — which overwrites the first employee’s 
document. Yikes!
The folks at Sugar must have run into the exact same problem because they 
came up with a great solution. Versioning enables you to track and manage 
multiple revisions of the same document and to view and recover earlier edi-
tions if necessary.
Here’s how you can add a revised copy of a document back into Sugar:
 
1. Click Documents on the Module Tab bar.
 
2. Choose Documents List from the Shortcuts menu and then click the name 
of the document you want to revise in the Document List subpanel.
 
 The Documents Detail view opens. I hate to make assumptions, but I’m going 
to make an assumption here: I’m assuming that you’ve already read the 
previous section, opened a document, made a few changes, and saved it.
 
3. Click Create in the Document Revisions subpanel of the Documents 
Detail view.

133
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
 
 The Document Revision page, shown in Figure 8-4, displays the current 
document name and revision number.
 
Figure 8-4: 
The 
Document 
Revision 
page.
 
 
4. Enter information into all the fields.
 
 I know all the fields aren’t required, but in this case, all the fields are 
really important ones.
 
 If you leave one of the fields blank or input incorrect information, you 
can’t go back and edit it after the fact. Proceed with caution!
 
• File Name: Click Browse to navigate to the file location, and then 
click Open to add it to Sugar. You cannot change the filename of 
the attached file; Sugar supplies it automatically.
 
• Revision: Specify a revision number for the revised document. If 
you’re making fairly minor changes you might use a decimal, such 
as 1.1 or 1.76. If you’re making fairly radical changes you might 
want to increase the ordinal to the next integer.
 
• Change Log: Enter a brief description of the changes. You’ll find 
this field to be really helpful if you have to track multiple docu-
ment versions.
 
5. Click Save to save your changes.
 
 The revised file now appears at the top of the Documents Revisions sub-
panel, which displays the revision number, the date and time of the last 
revision, and the Change Log comment.

134
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
If you look closely, you’ll notice the Remove icon next to all the older docu-
ments. That’s because you can remove any of the older documents if you 
want. However, the most recent version can’t be deleted.
I’ll Take a Bit of Sugar with My Word
A particularly useful Sugar feature enables you to create customized docu-
ment templates. Templates are forms in which your selected data fields are 
filled by Sugar. You can send these forms to a thousand people as easily as 
you can send them to just one person. You can send routine documents one 
at a time on a continual basis, or you can send a document one time to all or 
part of your database.
A good way to understand the concept of mail merge is to visualize this 
simple equation:
template + data field(s) = personalized document
Note the (s) at the end of data field, which suggests that you can use either one 
name or many names. Some of you might think that you’ll never perform a mail 
merge because you have no desire to send a mass mailing. Others of you might 
have already perfected the art of mass mailing but never realized that a mail 
merge can be directed to one person or to thousands of people. I hate to be the 
one to break your bubble, but if you have any kind of routine documents that 
you’re generating repetitively, you should be using Sugar to do so.
The three things necessary to create a mail merge are
 
✓ A name or a list of names: If you’ve followed this book to this point, 
you’re the happy owner of a database chock full of Account and Contact 
information.
 
✓ A document template: A document template is a letter or form that sub-
stitutes field names in place of names and addresses or whatever other 
information comes directly from your database.
 
✓ A program that can combine the names into the template: After you 
have a list of names and a document template, you need something to 
combine them. You could try to use your food processor, but I prefer to 
use the mail merge feature.
Sugar has a nifty plug-in that allows you to create mail merge templates in 
Microsoft Word. The plug-in comes as part of the SugarCRM Professional, or 
can be purchased separately if you’re using Sugar’s Community Edition.
You create the templates in Word and upload them to the Sugar Document 
module. Once uploaded, you can initiate a mail merge in either Sugar or Word.

135
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
Installing the plug-in for Microsoft Word
Because the ability to link Word to Sugar requires a plug-in, you have to 
install the plug-in if you’re running Sugar’s Community Edition (the plug-in is 
included in SugarCRM Professional). Fear not; this isn’t a particularly difficult 
thing to do:
 
1. Close Microsoft Word.
 
 You’re going to be able to access a special Sugar toolbar from within 
Word, but in order for the fun to begin, make sure Word is closed.
 
2. Download the Sugar plug-in for Word.
 
a. Go to www.sugarexchange.com.
 
b. Select Integration on the left side of the screen under Browse By 
Category.
 
c. From the alphabetical listing, scroll down and select Sugar Plug-in for 
Microsoft Word.
 
 The plug-in will come in the form of a .zip file. It doesn’t matter where 
you save the download file as long as you remember where you saved 
the file.
 
Unfortunately, it’s not very easy to find the Office plug-ins so you might need 
a road map. You’ll find them by going to the Sugar exchange (www.sugar
exchange.com/). For the Word plug-in you’ll want to click on the Integration 
category and then scroll down through the list of product until you find the 
Sugar Plug-in for Microsoft Word. For the Outlook plug-in you’ll select the 
e-mail category and then scroll down to Sugar Plug-In for Microsoft Outlook.
 
3. Double-click and follow the prompts to extract the file.
 
 You’re now the proud owner of your very own Sugar Word plug-in file.
 
4. Double-click the .exe installation file and follow the prompts to 
install the Word plug-in.
 
 No need to get fancy here — simply clicking Next and Next will get you 
where you’re going.
 
5. Start Word after the installation completes.
 
 Try to curb your enthusiasm! The SugarCRM drop-down menu displays 
below the Word menu exactly like the one shown in Figure 8-5.
 
 This menu gives you all the options you need to make Sugar and Word 
play nicely together.

136

6. In Word, choose SugarCRM➪Settings and fill in your SugarCRM 
credentials.
 
 Figure 8-6 shows you what the SugarCRM Settings window looks like. 
You just need to add your user name and password, and the URL you 
use to access Sugar.
 
Figure 8-6:

7. In Word, choose SugarCRM➪Login.
 
 You are now safe to roam around the cabin — and start creating mail 
merge templates.
Creating a mail merge template
Before you can win friends and influence prospects with your dazzling dis-
play of personalized documents, you need two basic elements: the data and 
the document template.
 
You’re creating a template, not a document, to perform your mail merge. A 
document is a plain old file that you create and use in Word. You use it once, 
save it, and store it away for posterity or delete it as soon as you’re done 
with it. Comparatively, a template is a form that merges with your database 
information. The convenience of templates is that you use them over and 
over again.

137
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
With your data tucked away nicely in your database, all you have left to do is 
to create the document template, which involves creating a form document. 
Your document template contains placeholders that are then filled with infor-
mation from your database after you perform a merge. Create a document 
template by following these steps:
 
1. If you haven’t done so already, open Word and choose 
SugarCRM➪Log in.
 
2. Choose SugarCRM➪Define Template.
 
 The Select Master Module dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Creating a 
document 
template.
 
 
3. Select the module that you want to create a template for and then 
click Next.
 
 You can add most any field to your template. Typically, you’ll want 
to use Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Prospects fields because 
that’s where you’ll find basic contact information, such as name and 
address. However, you can add Cases and Opportunities fields as well.
 
 Depending on the module you choose, a list of record field names dis-
plays, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Adding 
fields to the 
document 
template.
 

138
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
4. Start typing your document.
 
 You are, after all, in Word and can use all of its features. Write your 
thank you letter or create a few slick marketing pieces.
 
5. Click the spot in your document where you want contact information 
to appear, select the appropriate field name, and then click Add to 
Document.
 
 Here’s where the fun begins. Every time you get to a part that could be 
populated with Sugar information, scroll down the list of fields, select 
one to insert into your template, and then click Add to Document.
 
 The record type and field name appears in your document set off by 
lovely double-angle brackets. Treat these field names exactly as you do 
any other words in your template. For example, if you want to see them 
set in bold, bold the field name. You also want to place the appropriate 
punctuation next to an inserted field if necessary; for example, if you 
place the «Contacts_salutation» field in the greeting line, you’ll want to 
follow it with a colon.
 
 You can also double-click a field name to insert it into your document.
 
6. Click Next to continue.
 
 Here’s where you can add other record type fields into your document. 
For example, you might want to use Accounts fields for the address 
information, but Contacts fields for the first and last name information.
 
 When you select Campaign Prospects in the Master Module dialog box, 
Sugar won’t give you the option to include other record types.
 
7. Click Finish.
 
 The Add Fields window closes. Fear not, you can get it back again if nec-
essary by clicking SugarCRM➪Define Template.
 
8. Check your document for accuracy and edit as necessary.
 
9. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 Figure 8-9 shows Accounts billing address fields along with Contacts 
name fields.
 
10. Choose SugarCRM➪Upload.
 
 The Upload Document to SugarCRM dialog box opens, which looks 
remarkably like the one shown in Figure 8-10. Creating a document tem-
plate is only half the fun. The other half comes from getting your tem-
plate into Sugar.
 
11. Enter a document name and revision number for the document and 
then click OK.
 
 Notice that the Is Mail Merge Template check box is selected to ensure 
that the document is correctly identified as a template in the Documents 
module.

We’re off to see the Mail Merge Wizard
Now that you’ve created a document template, you’re ready to fill your 
template with record information. Don’t assume that creating a mail merge 
implies sending a single message to thousands of people at one time. A mail 
merge can also be used to automate the most mundane and routine of tasks. 
You can use Sugar’s document templates to write a thank you letter every 
time you land a new client or to write an inquiry letter each time you receive 
a new lead. After you discover this timesaver, I guarantee that you’ll never go 
back to your old way of creating documents again!
 
If a document is a Mail Merge template, the document type will automatically 
show as Mail Merge on the Documents Detail view.
Here’s how you create a mail merge in Sugar:
 
1. Navigate to the appropriate module’s Home page.

140
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
 For example, if you want to send a letter to a contact, go to the Contacts 
module.
 
 You can also initiate a mail merge by choosing Mail Merge from the 
Shortcuts menu on the Documents Home page. However, by starting at 
a record’s Home page, you can select the appropriate record(s) prior to 
the mail merge.
 
2. Select the record of whom you want to send a letter.
 
 If you’re just sending the template to one record, then you only need to 
select that record. However, if you’d like to send the template to mul-
tiple records, you’ll want to search for those records and then choose 
Select All Records.
  
 Chapter 4 shows you how to select records, and Chapter 9 shows you 
how to query among your records.
 
3. Click Mail Merge.
 
 The Mail Merge button is conveniently located next to the Export button 
above the record list. Clicking it starts the Mail Merge Wizard.
 
 The Mail Merge option must be enabled on both the Administration page 
and the My Accounts page to display the Mail Merge option. If you’re a 
database administrator, go to the Administration Home page and check 
the System Settings to make sure that the Enable Mail Merge option is 
selected. If you’re an end-user, go to the My Account page and make 
sure there’s a check next to Mail Merge. If Mail Merge is not enabled, 
you will not see a Mail Merge button.
 
4. Choose a template from the Select Template drop-down list on the 
Select Module and Template page.
 
 Take a look at Figure 8-11 just to make sure you’re on the right track.
 
Figure 8-11: 
The Select 
Module and 
Template 
page.
 
. 
 Although you can also choose a different module from the Selected 
Module drop-down list, you’ll probably find it easier to select the 
record(s) you plan on merging prior to starting the mail merge. You 
might also notice that only mail merge templates appear in the Select 
Template drop-down list.

141
 Chapter 8: Working with Documents
 
5. Click Next to continue.
 
 The Merge page that displays depends on the module that you selected. 
Any records that you select appear in the Selected section on the right. 
If you did not select any records, you can do so here. Use the left and 
right arrows to add or remove records.
 
6. Click Next to continue.
 
 The third step of the Wizard — the Review and Complete page — gives 
you a recap of your choices.
 
7. Click Begin Merge.
 
 You might hear a bit of clanging as the Wizard starts combining the data 
with the template. A dialog box opens that requests you specify whether 
to open the merged document in Word, or save it to a disk.
 
8. Make your selection and click OK.
 
 If you choose to open the document in Word, the merged document dis-
plays on the screen. If you choose to save the document to a disk, you 
can now specify the location to which you’d like to save the document.
Performing a mail merge in Word
You’ll probably find it much easier to run your mail merges in Sugar rather 
than in Word. Sugar allows you to make use of its queries, which makes tar-
geting your mailings much easier. However, some of the folks in your orga-
nization might find Word to be more familiar territory and want to use Word 
for their mail merges. Not a problem if you follow these steps:
 
1. In Word, open the template you want to use for the merge.
 
 You’ll want to close any other Word documents that you might already 
have open.
 
2. Click SugarCRM➪Perform Mail Merge.
 
 Similar to the dialog box shown in Figure 8-12, a list of records for the 
module that you selected in the template appears.
  
 You must be logged in to the Word plug-in for this to occur.
 
3. Use the right arrow to move the records that you want from the 
Available records list to the Selected Recipients list.
 
 You can use some of your old Windows tricks to help you here, such as 
holding down the CTRL key while selecting records to select several at 
one time.

142

Figure 8-12:

4. (Optional) Click Next to continue.
 
 You might be asked to select more records depending on the module(s) 
that you choose when you set up the document template. For example, 
if the template included both contacts and opportunities, you’ll be asked 
to select your opportunities.
 
 The Complete Mail Merge dialog box displays the selected records.
 
5. Click Complete Merge.
 
 The merged document displays in all its glory. At this juncture, you are 
free to print the document — or save it to Sugar for future reference.

fter you enter information into Sugar, you need a way to find it again. 
Sometimes, you’ll want a 360-degree view of all your information. You 
can accomplish this easily by making use of the Home page and dashboards. 
Other times, you’ll want to hone in on a single record. Or, you might want 
immediate access to a group of records based on very specific criteria. 
Knowing how to search in Sugar will provide you with the power you need to 
find the information you need. And, once you find the data, you might even 
want to print it for posterity.
There’s No Place Like Home
The Home module is the first thing you see when you log in to Sugar. The 
Home page consists of dashlets — individual components that summarize 
your various activities. A dashlet displays a list of item records that is similar 
to the List view displayed on a module’s Home page. You can remove the 
dashlets that you don’t use and add other dashlets that are better suited to 
your needs.
By default, the Home page displays the following dashlets:
 
✓ My Calls: Lists all the phone calls you’re scheduled to make, regardless 
of time period.
 
✓ My Meetings: Lists all your meetings.
 
✓ My Leads: Shows your recently added Leads records.

144
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
✓ My Top Open Opportunities: Lists your top open Opportunities 
records.
 
✓ My Accounts: Displays the Accounts records that are assigned to you.
 
✓ My Open Cases: Here’s where you can view a list of customer issues 
that you — or some other nice person — has assigned to you to resolve.
 
✓ Jot Pad: This is your virtual sticky note; feel free to jot down anything 
you need to.
 
✓ My Pipeline: Displays a chart of your sales opportunities based on their 
current sales stage.
Figure 9-1 shows a sample of the My Top Open Opportunities dashlet.

Honing in on the Home page
After you decide on the dashlets you want to display on your Home page, the 
real fun begins. All dashlets have several common elements:
 
✓ To rearrange your dashlets, place your mouse on the dashlet title and 
then drag-and-drop it to a new position.
 
✓ To remove a dashlet, click the Delete (X) icon.
 
✓ To refresh a dashlet, click the Refresh (double-arrow) icon. By refresh-
ing the dashlet, you’re able to see any changes that have been made in 
Sugar.
 
✓ To zoom in for more information, click the record name or subject.
 
✓ To sort your information, click a column header.

Changing the Home page dashlets info
You’ll probably find the Home page to be one of your best resources because it 
allows you to see the various aspects of your business on one page. However, 
you might not be satisfied with the information displayed on a dashlet. For 
example, the My Top Open Opportunities dashlet only displays your top five 
opportunities; with a little tweaking you can make it display ten — or as many 
as you want.
You can configure each dashlet to display various rows and columns. 
Additionally, you can change the filters to display the exact information you 
need. Best of all, it’s really easy to tweak the dashlets if you follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the Edit (pencil) icon of the dashlet you’d like to modify.
 
 The Options dialog box displays in a separate window similar to the one 
shown in Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Editing a 
Home page 
dashlet.
 
 
2. Change the dashlet title.
 
 For example, you might rename the My Top Open Opportunities dashlet 
to simply My Top 10 Ops.

146
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
3. Select the columns to display by selecting a column title from the Hide 
Columns area and then clicking the left-pointing arrow.
 
 Your column choices are dependent on the type of dashlet that you’re 
editing. You can also remove columns from the Display Columns area. 
And, feel free to use the up and down arrows to rearrange things a bit.
 
4. Change the Filters.
 
 You can opt to show only your items or to filter items according to date 
range or some other criteria.
 
5. Click Save when you finish editing the dashlet. 
 
 You might want to take a moment to appreciate your artistry. Or, if 
you’re not satisfied with your changes, you can always try, try again!
Adding new dashlets to the Home page
You can add and remove dashlets as needed. Simply click the Add Dashlets 
button at the top-right side of the Home page and the dialog window shown 
in Figure 9-3 opens.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Adding 
dashlets to 
the Home 
page.
 
Notice that many of the dashlets already appear on your Home page. 
However, you might want to add multiple dashlets of the same kind and give 
them different names and filters. For example, you might add a dashlet for 
your top five opportunities, and another similar dashlet with the top ten 
opportunities company-wide. After you added a dashlet, you can move it 
using the technique described in the previous section.

147
 Chapter 9: Watching Your Sugar Content
 
By default, you can only add ten dashlets to your Home page. However, if 
you feel an overwhelming desire to increase that number, consider wander-
ing over to the administrator with a subtle bribe because she can change 
this setting. And, if you find you can’t modify the Home page at all, you might 
consider finding an even larger bribe because the administrator has control of 
that setting as well.
 
Got the “I’ve done a bit too much Home page customization” blues? There’s 
a sure-fire cure. Click My Account from the Home page and then click the 
Homepage button in the Reset to Default area at the top of the Users page. 
Voilà! — you’re back to the original Home page layout.
You Can’t Drive Your Business 
without a Dashboard
The Dashboard is quite similar to the Home page. However, most of the Home 
page dashlets are in list format whereas the Dashboard dashlets take the form 
of neat graphical charts and graphs like the ones shown in Figure 9-4.
 
Figure 9-4:

148
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
You access the dashboards by clicking Dashboard on the Module Tab bar. If 
you’ve mastered the dashlets on the Home page, then you’ve mastered the 
Dashboard dashlets because you add, remove, edit, and move the dashlets in 
both modules exactly the same way.
Basic dashboarding 101
The Dashboard module contains six dashlets, all of which focus on informa-
tion it gathers from the Opportunities module:
 
✓ All Opportunities by Lead Source by Outcome: A bar chart displaying 
opportunities segmented by each lead source.
 
✓ All Opportunities by Lead Source: A pie chart that shows the propor-
tion of total opportunities for each lead source.
 
✓ Campaign ROI: If you’re using the Campaign module (see Chapter 14), 
this displays a campaign’s return on investment.
 
✓ My Pipeline by Sales Stage: This one is a funnel chart that shows the 
total dollar amount for your opportunities grouped by sales stage.
 
✓ Outcome by Month: A bar chart displaying the total sales pipeline for 
each month.
 
✓ Pipeline by Sales Stage: A funnel chart that displays the total dollar 
amounts for all your opportunities grouped by sales stage.
Click the Add Dashlets button to add an additional dashlet to the Dashboard 
page. Remember, you can add the same dashlet multiple times and then edit 
it to change the names and filtering criteria.
 
Not satisfied with the available dashlets? Chapter 20 talks about the 
SugarForge and SugarExchange where you find lots of additional dashlets.
Professional dashboarding
SugarCRM Professional Edition comes complete with mag wheels and 
enhanced dashboard functionality. It also comes with two additional dashlets:
 
✓ My Closed Opportunities: Shows a gauge chart of your opportunities 
that you’ve closed.
 
✓ My Forecasting: Compares your sales quota against the actual amount of 
your opportunities. You read about the Forecasting module in Chapter 16.

149
 Chapter 9: Watching Your Sugar Content
You can also perform an additional party trick using SugarCRM Professional: 
the ability to group your dashlets into pages.
If you look closely at Figure 9-5, you’ll notice two tiny — albeit important — 
differences from what you see in Figure 9-4:

✓ The Dashboard features additional page tabs.
In Professional Edition, you modify the Dashboard by clicking on a page of 
your dashboard and then clicking the double down arrows. This opens the 
dialog window shown in Figure 9-6.

From here you can
 
✓ Rename: Rename the dashboard page by replacing the existing page 
name with a new one.
 
✓ Add Dashlets: Add additional dashlets to the page using the same tech-
nique as you do for Community Edition dashboards. In addition to the 
dashlets mentioned above, you can also add any customized charts that 
you’ve created.
 
 If you’re not sure how to add your customized charts, you might want to 
take a gander at Chapter 16.
 
✓ Change Layout: Change the dashboard layout to have a one, two, or 
three column layout.
 
✓ Delete Page: Delete a dashboard page. However, you can’t delete the 
Dashboard’s Home page.
Seek and Ye Shall Find
If all roads lead to Rome, surely all processes in SugarCRM lead to the Search 
window. A search is a way of looking at only a portion of the records in your 
database, depending on your specifications. A good practice in Sugar is to 
perform a search and then perform an action. For example, you might per-
form a search and then follow up on your key opportunities. Or, you might do 
a search and then perform a mail merge.
The theory behind the search is that you don’t always need to work with all 
your contacts at one time. Not only is working with only a portion of your 
database easier, at times, doing so is absolutely necessary. If you’re changing 
your mailing address, you probably want to send a notification to everyone 
in your database. Comparatively, if you’re running a special sales promo-
tion, you probably notify only your leads and accounts. And if you’re sending 
overpriced holiday gift baskets, you probably want the names of only your 
very best customers.
In Sugar, you can search for information across several modules or restrict 
your search to one specific module. You can also perform a quick search 
based on a single field.
The three types of Sugar searches are
 
✓ Global Search
 
✓ Basic Search
 
✓ Advanced Search

151
 Chapter 9: Watching Your Sugar Content
Doing the Global Search
A Global Search can be an extremely useful way to find data about your 
records no matter where that information might be lurking. In fact, you might 
nickname this search the “Super” search. As your database increases, you 
might want to see all the records that revolve around a single Contacts or 
Accounts record. Sugar’s Global Search enables you to dig for that informa-
tion in the Accounts, Bug Tracker, Cases, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, 
Projects, and Quotes modules of Sugar.
For example, suppose that you’re looking for all the information about a key 
Accounts record. You perform a Global Search by filling in your search crite-
ria in the search box located at the top-right corner of any Sugar screen and 
then clicking the Search button.
 
The percent sign (%) is the universal wildcard in a MySQL database. Sugar 
automatically adds the % wildcard to the end of a search. For example, 
searching for “The Big%” matches such records as The Big Kahuna or The Big 
Bopper. Searching for “%Big” returns Mr. Big.
 
Depending on the type of database you’re using, a Global Search may or may 
not be case-sensitive. Sugar databases that use the MySQL database are not 
case-sensitive whereas those using Oracle are case-sensitive.
A Gobal Search searches throughout your database — checking all records — 
and returns all records relating to your criteria in a page that looks similar to 
Figure 9-7.
 
Figure 9-7: 
The results 
of a Global 
Search.
 
The Search box

152
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
The modules with the most records display at the top of the Search Result 
page. When the search has completed, you can further refine your search 
by selecting only the modules you wish to query and then clicking the 
Search button.
Getting back to basics
You can perform a Basic Search from the Search subpanel, which is conve-
niently located at the top of most module Home pages. The Basic Search 
limits your search options to a few crucial fields.
Performing a Basic Search is easy if you follow these steps:
 
1. Select the tab of the module that you’d like to search.
 
 Unlike a Global Search, the Basic Search is limited to a single module.
 
2. Fill in the criteria on which you’d like to search.
 
 For example, Figure 9-8 shows you the Basic Search tab of the Contacts 
Home page, which includes the First Name, Last Name, and Account 
Name fields. You can search by any — or all — of the fields.
 
 The search fields are context-sensitive; when you type a character in a 
field, the system performs a search and presents a list of values starting 
with that character.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Performing 
a Basic 
Search.
 

153
 Chapter 9: Watching Your Sugar Content
 
3. (Optional) Select the Only My Items check box to find only those 
records that are related to your tasks and activities.
 
4. Click the Search button.
 
 Quick as a wink, your List view modifies to show only those records that 
match your search criteria. If you enter information into more than one 
field, then a record must match all those fields to be included.
 
 At this point, you can continue on your merry way. Feel free to perform 
a mass update, delete the selected records, and perform any function 
that you can normally perform in the List view.
 
5. Click the Clear button when you finish working with the selected 
records.
 
 You might feel a momentary feeling of panic right after performing a 
search, wondering what happened to the rest of your records. Sugar 
believes in the “Mother May I” school of computing. After you perform 
a search, those records — and only those records — will display in the 
List view even if you log out of Sugar and log back in again. Make sure 
you hit the Clear button to bring the rest of the records out of hiding.
Advancing your way through the searches
After you use your database for a while and it slowly but surely fills up with 
more and more records, you might feel the need to add a little more power 
to your searches. You also might find yourself constantly creating the same 
search and wishing you could save that search. In fact, you might even start 
using the term query, which is computer-speak for search.
If you need to base your search on multiple criterions, you can perform a 
query to create the search. In Sugar, a query searches all the records in your 
database based on the criteria that you specify and then creates a list of the 
records that match that criteria. Additionally, you can rearrange the list to 
show the fields you deem to be most important.
Many of you might associate advanced with difficult, but that’s certainly not 
the case here. In Sugar, the Advanced Search is powerful, but not difficult, if 
you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Advanced Search tab of the module’s Home page.
 
 As you probably know by now, most every module includes the Search 
subpanel on its Home page. The Advanced Search page displays vari-
ous fields depending on the selected module. The fields are blank; your 
mission — should you choose to accept it — is to specify the fields and 
values that define the query.

154
Part II: Cooking with Sugar 
 
2. Fill in any criteria on which you want to search.
 
 The Advanced Search allows you to create an exact profile for the contacts 
you’re hoping to find. For example, you might want to have a look at all of 
your Accounts records from the state of Arizona who are manufacturers.
 
 Fill in as much criteria as you need. The whole purpose of doing an 
Advanced Search is to look for records that fit more than one criterion. 
If you’re looking for all customers who are located in Arizona, select 
Customer from the Type list and type AZ in the State field, as I do in 
Figure 9-9.
 
Figure 9-9: 
The 
Advanced 
Search 
page.
 
 
3. Click the Search button.
 
 Sugar happily displays a list of all the Contacts records that match your 
search criteria in the List view.
 
4. Click the double down arrows next to Saved Search & Layout.
 
 The Saved Search & Layout subpanel expands. The Saved Search & 
Layout option lets you save the search criteria as well as how you want 
that information to display.
 
5. Select a field from the Hide Columns list and click the left arrow to 
add a column to the List view.
 
 The object of the game is to decide which fields you want to display — 
and the order in which they’ll be displayed.

155
 Chapter 9: Watching Your Sugar Content
 
 To change the order of the displayed fields, select a field from the 
Display Columns list and then use the up or down arrow to move it. To 
remove a column from the List view, select it from the Display Columns 
list and use the right arrow to move it to the Hide Columns list.
 
6. Choose the column you wish to sort by from the Order By Column 
drop-down list.
 
 Only those fields you select in the Display Columns list will show in the 
Order By Column drop-down list.
 
7. Select the appropriate Direction radio button.
 
 Most folks like to see things in Ascending or A–Z, low-to-high order. 
However, you might choose descending order if you’re searching for 
opportunities and want to see the big-ticket items first.
 
8. Enter a name for the search results in the Save This Search As field 
and then click Save.
 
 Creating an Advanced Search is only half the fun; the other half comes 
from being able to use it again — and again and again!
 
9. Choose None from the Saved Searches drop-down list to clear the 
current search, and then select your saved search from the Saved 
Searches list to view the saved search.
 
10. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the search criteria and/or 
the layout and then click Update.
 
 Mistakes happen. The world evolves. And you may need to tweak your 
saved search. Feel free to do so.
 
11. (Optional) Click Delete to delete the saved search.
 
 Over time, your list of saved searches might get very l-o-n-g; you’ll want 
to prune it a bit.
 
Saved searches can be a bit confusing. You might find yourself using a saved 
search, changing the filters and actually creating a new search — even though 
the Saved Searches drop-down displays the original search name. It’s a good 
practice to choose None from the drop-down and then click Clear to rid your-
self of any evidence of the prior search.

In this part . . .
E
ven the best-laid plans of any business can result in 
unexpected outcomes. Hard as it may be to believe, 
your customers will find things to complain about — and 
you’ll want to be responsive to their concerns. Using 
Sugar, you can set up and manage cases for those prob-
lematic customers as well as report on any bugs that you 
uncover in your product line. And, as your company 
grows, you might consider creating custom portals for 
each of your customers as a way of handling their prob-
lems immediately — before they have a chance to 
escalate.

Chapter 10
Adding a Bit of Case Management
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding case management
▶ Working with the Cases module
▶ Evaluating your case load
▶ Creating a Knowledge Base
C
ase management is the collaborative process of assessing a problem, 
planning its solution, and ultimately providing a favorable outcome. In 
this chapter, I show you how to use Sugar’s Cases module to identify and fix 
the problems that are bothering your customers before they snowball into 
major headaches. And, after you solve the problem and/or resolve the issues, 
you can document your findings in the company Knowledge Base.
I’m on the Case
Fortunately, some of you may never have to use Sugar’s Cases module. Maybe 
you sell a product that never breaks — or one that you don’t have to worry 
about fixing. Perhaps the services that you offer are so stellar that you never 
receive a complaint. Lucky you! If that’s the case, feel free to skip this chapter.
For the rest of the crowd, the Sugar Cases module will seem heaven-sent. Many 
other CRM products require you to purchase expensive add-on software if you 
need to manage a help desk or incident tracking. By having one integrated prod-
uct, however, your support personnel can attach the issues to existing records 
without having to retype address and other contact details in the database.
With Sugar, you can use the Cases module to deal with a variety of com-
plaints and questions that all too often land on your desk. Maybe you sell 
products or equipment that can break from time to time. Maybe you run 
a call center that fields questions about various products. Or maybe your 
company has a customer service department that needs a place to log the 
complaints they have to deal with. Whatever the situation, Sugar is there to 
handle all the negative aspects with a sweet smile.

160
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
Generally, the bigger the company the greater the possibility that things will 
go wrong. The Cases module is fairly generic, so you can use it company-wide 
to help resolve the issues facing various departments. This is very important 
in a small or medium-sized company where typically a single solution is used 
for multiple purposes:
 
✓ Customer service department: A customer service department can 
use Sugar to keep track of all the issues and problems your customers 
report about your product or services. Issues no longer slip through 
the cracks. Sugar tracks the life of support issues from the day they’re 
reported to the day they’re resolved so that you keep your customers 
happy — and don’t lose them to your competition!
 
✓ Sales department: Because the entire database is integrated with the 
customer support issues, your sales folks can see how your customers 
are being taken care of and what issues they face.
 
✓ Marketing department: Marketing can refer to the Cases module to ana-
lyze the nature of the problems your customers are reporting and use 
the insight to improve your product or services.
 
✓ Internal IT department: Your overworked and underpaid IT folks can 
use Sugar to keep track of internal, employee-related tasks so they can 
prioritize their time.
 
Although the Cases module is fairly basic at first glance, a trip to Chapter 15 
shows you how to customize and make Cases as robust as you need.
Let’s Make a Federal Case Out of It
Creating Cases records and resolving them with Sugar is a very easy process. 
In essence, the customer notifies the help desk or customer service depart-
ment of his issue and the support personnel assigns a ticket that details the 
problem. If the first person is able to solve the issue, he closes the case. 
However, if he is unable to resolve the problem he can assign a follow-up 
to someone else in the company who might have better luck in helping 
Mr. Customer — and ultimately closing the case. Anyone in the company 
can view the details of the case from the Cases subpanel of the associated 
Accounts record.
Creating a Cases record is much easier than waiting for a small problem to 
develop into a mountain of trouble:
 
1. Choose Create Case from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Cases page opens. Check out Figure 10-1 to see what it looks like.

161
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
 
Figure 10-1: 
Creating a 
Case.
 
 
2. Enter information into the fields on the Cases page.
 
• Number (required): You may wonder how exactly you fill in infor-
mation for this required field. Gotcha! You don’t; Sugar automati-
cally assigns the next sequential number to a new case.
 
• Priority: Specify the urgency of the problem (High, Medium, or 
Low) from the drop-down list.
 
• Assigned To: Specify the lucky person who is in charge of the 
Cases record.
 
 If the administrator has enabled e-mail notification, then the case 
owner will receive an e-mail whenever a Cases record is assigned 
to her. Chapter 16 shows you this and a few more tricks available 
to the database administrator.
 
• Status: Specify the status of the problem from the drop-down 
list; typical choices include items like New, Closed, and I’m really 
stumped.
 
• Account Name (required): You must associate a Cases record with 
an existing Accounts record. You can type in the first few letters 
of the account name and Sugar will magically suggest possible 
matches, or you can click the Select button to manually search for 
an Accounts record.
 
• Type: The type of case you’re creating. The choices are Product, 
User and Administration.

162
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
 
• Subject (required): Enter a brief summary of the Cases record to 
help identify it among the rest of the Cases records.
 
• Description: For some record types, a description offers little or 
no value. However, in the case of case management this is where 
you’ll want to write a litany that clearly describes the problem.
 
• Resolution: Enter the results of the investigation into the problem.
 
3. Click Save to save the Cases record.
 
 The Cases Detail view displays, as shown in Figure 10-2.
 
Figure 10-2: 
The Cases 
Detail view.
 
I Rest My Case
Some cases have easy resolutions and you’re able to open and close the case 
at the same time. However, many cases are more complex and involve a bit 
more intervention before they can be closed.
Here’s how you can monitor a Cases record from start to finish:
 
1. Click the Cases module tab from the Sugar Home page.
 
 You can access your entire case load by clicking the Cases module tab 
from your Home page. The Cases Home page allows you to search for 
Cases by Number, Subject, or Account Name. In addition, Figure 10-3 
shows how you can opt to view only those Cases records assigned to you. 

163
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
 
 By now, you’re pretty much a Sugar List expert. You can sort, delete, 
export to Excel, or merge Cases records using exactly the same method 
you use for any other List in Sugar. 
 
2. Click the case record’s name to view the details of a Cases record.
 
 Clicking the name of a Cases record from the Case List opens the Case 
page. This page is extremely important in the life cycle of a Cases 
record.
 
3. Click Edit to change the case record’s details and then click Save to 
record your changes.
 
 Because Cases records are fairly volatile, you need to edit them fre-
quently. In particular, you’ll want to change the Status field — especially 
when you close the Cases record.
 
4. (Optional) Click the View Change Log button to view any recent 
changes to the Cases record.
 
5. Scroll to the Contacts subpanel and click Select to associate additional 
Contacts records with the Cases record.
 
 You can associate as many Contacts records as you like to a Cases 
record. By associating the Cases record to various Contacts records, 
you give the rest of your organization a bit of a heads-up that there’s a 
problem before they step into a possible minefield.

6. Scroll to the Activities subpanel.
 
 You can perform a variety of case-related tricks from the Activities 
subpanel.
 
• Task: Here’s where you can hand the next step of the case to one 
of your unsuspecting colleagues.
 
• Meeting: If the case requires some major fine-tuning on the part of 
the customer, you might want to schedule a face-to-face meeting 
with him to discuss it.
 
• Call: Schedule a follow-up phone call for either yourself or one of 
your co-workers.
 
• E-mail: This really sweet option automatically opens an e-mail pre-
filled with the case record’s number and subject in the subject line 
so that you can keep Ms. Customer informed via e-mail.
 
7. Scroll to the History subpanel.
 
 Need to fill in a few more tidbits of info? Here’s the place!
 
8. Scroll to the Bugs subpanel.
 
 Chapter 11 tells you about the crawly critters and insects that infect 
software; here’s where you can associate a bug with your Cases record.

165
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
It’s a Case of Reporting
You have a couple of nice ways to really stay on top of your case load. My 
favorite is to make sure you include the My Open Cases dashlet on your 
Home page — and place it in a prominent position so that you see it each 
time you fire up Sugar. Chapter 9 walks you through that task.
Another way to keep track of your cases is by using a report to view your 
cases. SugarCRM Professional Edition comes with both a price tag and a 
bunch of case reports.
You can access the Case Reports by clicking the Cases module tab on the 
Sugar Home page and then choosing Case Reports from the Shortcut menu. 
As you see in Figure 10-5, the four “out of the box” reports are
 
✓ Open Cases By User By Status
 
✓ Open Cases By Month By User
 
✓ Open Cases By Priority By User
 
✓ New Cases By Month
 
Figure 10-5:

166
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
The default reports all display in graphical format. Once displayed, you can 
change the filters or opt to have a report display as text rather than as a 
graphic; Chapter 14 explains how to change the report options. You can also 
drill down on any portion of the report to see more detail. Figure 10-6 shows 
you a sample of the Open Cases By Priority By User report.

Building Your Base of Knowledge
The beginning of this chapter deals with the issues that your customers face — 
and the process you go through to provide a solution. You might think that after 
the customer goes away — hopefully with a smile on his face — your problems 
are over. However, chances are pretty good that other customers will come to 
you with the very same issues somewhere down the line. You might start the 
process all over again — or you might try to learn from your experiences.
SugarCRM Professional Edition includes a Knowledge Base module. A knowl-
edge base is a collection of articles that pertains to a specific topic. Generally, 
knowledge base or KB articles include a problem and its solution. Typically, a 
knowledge base includes the ability to search the articles to find the answers 
to your specific questions.
Using the Knowledge Base module, you can create articles on any subject 
to develop your own searchable library of answers to common questions as 
well as create FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions). You can attach a file to 
the article, create an article from an existing case, and even e-mail the article 
directly to one of your customers.

Creating a KB
The steps for creating a new Knowledge Base article are easy. Here’s all you 
have to do:
 
1. Open a new Knowledge Base article.
 
 You can create a Knowledge Base article using any one of the following 
three methods:
 
• From scratch: Click Knowledge Base on the Module Tab bar from 
the Home page and then choose Create Article from the Shortcuts 
menu.
 
• From an existing Cases record: If you have an existing case — 
preferably one you’ve already resolved — open the case and then 
click Create Article on the Cases record’s Detail view. This method 
saves you from having to enter a Title, Subject, Description, or 
Resolution because that information automatically fills in from the 
corresponding fields in the Cases record.
 
• From an existing e-mail message: Hard as it may be to believe, a 
problem might stump the stars of your company only to be solved 
by the customer himself. In cases like these, the customer e-mails 
you with a solution, which you can use to generate a new article 
without having to start from scratch.
 
 Whatever method you use, the Knowledge Base article page opens, as 
shown in Figure 10-7.
 
Figure 10-7: 
Creating a 
Knowledge 
Base article.

2. Enter information into the Knowledge Base Article fields.
 
 Although not all the fields are required, they’re all important so take the 
time to fill them all in.
 
• Title (required): This is the main way you identify an article so 
give it a good title.
 
• External Article: Select this check box to make the article available 
to both your internal Sugar users and your external SugarPortal 
users. 
 
• Revision (required): Enter the article’s revision number. Typically, 
the revision number of a new article is 1, followed by 2, 3, 4, and 
so on.
 
• Status: Choose the status of the article from the drop-down list to 
indicate whether it’s ready for prime time viewing.
 
 To make the article available for viewing, the status must be set to 
Published.
 
• Team (required): Enter the name of the team that’s allowed to 
access the article. If an article is an external one, Team will default 
to Global so that everyone can access it.
 
• Author (required): By default, the article creator is the assigned 
author. However, you can click Select and choose a different user.
 
 Make sure that the author is a member of the assigned team so 
that she will be able to access — and subsequently edit — the 
article.
 
• Approver: Click Select to select the name of the lucky user who’s 
responsible for the final rendition of the article.
 
• Expiration Date: Old news is, well, old news, so you might want to 
include an expiration date to ensure that your article will not dis-
play when it is no longer relevant.
 
 When an article reaches its expiration date, it no longer appears in 
any internal search results or in the SugarPortal.
 
3. Click the Tags Select button to link the article with a new or existing tag.
 
 The next section, “Playing tag with your KB articles” talks about tags, 
which is the method Sugar uses to organize your articles.
 
4. Enter the text of the article in the Body field.
 
 This is the main purpose — and most important part — of the article. 
The body includes a nice HTML editor so you can format your text using 
familiar tools, such as bold, italics, underline, colors, and font size. 
You’ll even find buttons that allow you to create a hyperlink within the 
article and preview the final product.
 
 Typically, KB articles include a description of the problem and its 
resolution.

169
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
 
5. (Optional) Click Browse to navigate to the location of a file and select 
it to attach the file to the article.
 
 For example, if you are a software company, you might have created a 
hot fix to fix a problem and want to attach it to the article.
 
6. (Optional) Click Browse to navigate to the location of a graphic and 
select it to embed an image into the article.
 
 A picture is worth a thousand words so you might want to include one in 
the body of your document to illustrate your point.
 
7. Click Save to save the article.
 
 The article’s Detail view displays.
Playing tag with your KB articles
Tags are similar to folders. They allow you to group articles so that it’s easy 
to find the ones you want. When you tag an article, the system creates a link 
between the tag and the article.
Sugar comes with two tags: FAQs and Untagged Articles. You also have the 
capability to create custom tags. If you’re a software company, for example, 
you might create additional tags such as Hardware Errors, Software Errors, 
and Nut Behind the Keyboard Errors. An article can be linked to more than 
one tag, and a tag can be linked with multiple articles.
As your Knowledge Base grows, you can organize your tags into root tags and 
subtags. Root tags are the main categories, and subtags are the subcategories.
When you create an article, you can create a new tag for it or select an exist-
ing one. It’s probably a bit easier to create tags prior to creating the articles 
so that you give some thought to the organization you want the Knowledge 
Base to follow.
Here’s how to start creating tags:
 
1. Click Knowledge Base on the Module Tab bar on the Sugar Home page 
and then choose Knowledge Base Admin from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Knowledge Base Admin page opens. A list of existing root tags dis-
plays under the Tags heading.
 
2. Choose an action from the admin options drop down list and then 
click the folder to which you’d like to create a new tag.
 
 Don’t be fooled by the check boxes — you need to click the actual file-
name here. Click the Tags folder if you’d like to create a root tag; click 
one of existing root tags if you’d like to create a subtag.

170
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
 
3. Fill in the name of the new folder and then click Save.
 
 Figure 10-8 gives you an idea of what adding a new tag looks like.
 
Figure 10-8: 
Creating a 
new tag.
 
Being the KB Editor and Chief
After your Knowledge Base grows, you’ll probably need to reorganize it a bit 
by renaming or deleting tags, or maybe changing which articles correspond 
to a given tag. The Knowledge Base Admin page is just the place to make 
these changes.
Notice in Figure 10-8 that you can select both Tags and the corresponding 
articles associated with a tag. By selecting Tags and/or articles and making 
use of the admin options drop-down list, you have a whole bunch of editing 
options available to you:
 
✓ Delete Tag: Choose Delete Tag from the admin options drop-down list, 
select a tag, and then click the Delete Tag button.
  
 Only administrators can delete tags because they can view all the arti-
cles associated with a tag, whereas some of your users might not have 
the necessary permission to view all articles.
 
 Only empty tags can be deleted.
 
✓ Rename Tag: Choose Rename Tag from the admin options drop-down 
list, click a Tag name, and type in the new tag name.
 
✓ Move article(s): Choose Move Selected Articles from the admin options 
drop-down list, select the article(s), click the Select Tag button, and then 
click the name of the desired tag.

171
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
 
✓ Apply new tags to an article: Choose Apply Tags to Articles from the admin 
options drop-down list, select the article(s), click the Select Tag button, and 
then click the name of the tag you want to associate with the article.
Seek and ye shall find the article
Ah. The hard work is over. You’ve solved the problem, saved the world — 
and created a Knowledge Base article so that everyone else can benefit from 
your brilliance. But, like most of life, there’s a slight catch — how are people 
going to find your article?
If your Knowledge Base contains only a handful of articles, it’s easy to browse 
for the article in question. However, as your Knowledge Base grows, you’ll 
want to search for articles.
Browsing the base
It’s very easy — albeit a bit time-consuming — to browse for an article. 
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Click Knowledge Base on the Module Tab bar on the Sugar Home page 
and then choose Articles from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Browse tab of the Knowledge Base Home page appears in all its 
glory, as shown in Figure 10-9, and displays a list of existing tags.
 
2. Click a tag name to view its contents.
 
 All the articles within a selected tag display in the right panel.
 
3. (Optional) Click the plus (+) sign to view the sub tags and the articles 
contained within.
 
4. Click an article name to view the contents of that article.
 
 From here, it’s a question of clicking a tag to reveal the articles it con-
tains. You even have an Untagged Articles tag that you can use to search 
for any articles that might not have been tagged.
 
Figure 10-9: 
The 
Knowledge 
Base Home 
page’s 
Browse tab.
 

172
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
 
All tags are visible to all users. However, you can see only those articles you 
have permission to see.
Quickly querying the Knowledge Base
Browsing works well for tiny knowledge bases — or if you have lots of time 
on your hands. However, as your Knowledge Base grows, you’ll want to 
search for articles by keywords, tags, and/or titles to find the articles that 
you want.
The Knowledge Base Home page has three tabs: Search, Browse, and 
Advanced. Your first trip to the Knowledge Base lands you in the Browse tab, 
which I discussed in the previous section. In this section, I discuss the two 
other tabs, which you use to find just the article you’re looking for.
Simply searching for an article
 
1. Click Knowledge Base on the Module Tab bar on the Sugar Home page 
and then choose Articles from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Knowledge Base Home page opens.
 
2. Click the Search tab.
 
 The Knowledge Base Search tab opens, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
Figure 10-10: 
The 
Knowledge 
Base Home 
page’s 
Search tab.
 
 
3. Enter one or more words in the search field to find related articles.
 
 You can search by supplying a part of a title or the information found 
within the article.
 
4. (Optional) To restrict the search, choose a criterion from the Search 
Within drop-down list.
 
 The Search Within list allows you to restrict your search a bit more by 
allowing you to choose such options as Pending Approval or Added Last 
30 Days.
 
5. Click the Search button.
 
 Any articles that match your request will appear in a list at the bottom 
of the search page.

173
 Chapter 10: Adding a Bit of Case Management
Performing an Advanced search
As your Knowledge Base grows, so too will your need to perform bigger, 
more powerful searches. And, like the reliable software program that it is, 
Sugar is ready to grow with you.
The Advanced tab of the Knowledge Base allows you to plug in lots of addi-
tional criteria to your search. And, although it’s advanced and powerful, the 
Advanced search is every bit as easy to perform as the basic search.
 
1. Click Knowledge Base on the Module Tab bar on the Sugar Home page 
and then choose Articles from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Knowledge Base Home page opens.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab and then click the More Options link.
 
 By clicking the More Options link, you can view all the fields shown in 
Figure 10-11 that are available to you.
Building a better query
On the simplest level, Sugar tracks down any 
articles that include a specified word or phrase 
in either the title or the body of an article. 
However, if you’re using a MySQL database with 
Sugar, you can make use of SQL’s advanced 
querying language to build more sophisticated 
queries.
Here are a few query rules to keep in mind:
 ✓ Words and phrases are not case sensitive.
 ✓ Use spaces to specify multiple words. A 
space works like the word or. For example, 
if you search for error message, the search 
results will return articles that contain 
either the words error or message.
 ✓ Specific phrases must be enclosed in 
quotes. If you are looking for articles that 
contain the specific phrase software error 
messages, then you must type “software 
error message” in the search field. Without 
the quotes, you’ll end up with a bunch of 
articles that contain either the words 
software, error, and/or message anywhere 
within the article.
 ✓ Use the plus (+) sign to find articles that con-
tain multiple words. For example, software 
+error will find articles that only contain both 
words. Additionally, you can combine a word 
with a phrase; for example, to find articles on 
keyboard error messages, you can search 
for “error messages” +keyboard.
 ✓ Use the minus (–) sign to exclude words 
or phrases. For example, error messages –
keyboard will find only those articles about 
error messages that don’t include a refer-
ence to the keyboard.
 ✓ SQL uses the percent sign (%) as a wild-
card. For example, searching for %dem will 
retrieve demo, democracy, and epidemic.
 ✓ MySQL ignores words with three letters 
or less unless they are part of a phrase. 
Therefore, the search results will not dis-
play articles containing the, or, and of.

Chapter 11
Keeping Bugs Out of 
the Sugar Bowl
In This Chapter
▶ Working with bugs
▶ Creating a forum
I
n this chapter, I show you how to use SugarCRM to keep track of — and 
hopefully find solutions for — software bugs. I also show you how to 
create a forum so that the members of your team can collaborate to solve the 
problems of the world — or at least fix what’s bugging your software.
 
Nobody likes to think that bugs are roaming around in either their picnic 
basket or in their software! If your company develops software, this chapter 
will be particularly useful to you. Even if you don’t develop software the Bugs 
module is a great place for your users to report issues on the Sugar installa-
tion itself.
Learning to Fix What’s Bugging You
In computer-speak, a bug is an error or defect in software or hardware that 
causes a program to not work correctly. Typically, bugs appear in one of the 
following situations:
 
✓ Software conflicts: It’s almost impossible to test to see how your soft-
ware program is going to react with every other piece of software that’s 
on the market today. You might find that the software mysteriously 
stops working when you upgrade your operating system or install a new 
piece of accounting software.
 
✓ Hardware conflicts: Just as with software, many types of hardware are 
out there. Again, your software might function perfectly well until you 
purchase a new computer. Sometimes, even peripherals (such as print-
ers) can cause a problem.

178
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
 
✓ Defect: If you’re a software manufacturer, this is probably the most 
annoying — and easiest to fix — of all the bugs. A defect is a problem 
with the software that prevents it from working correctly.
Bug Tracking is fairly similar to Case Management. In both instances, some-
thing is not working correctly and it’s up to you to get it corrected. Sugar’s 
Case Management module is fairly generic and can be used with a wide 
variety of goods and services. Comparatively, you’ll probably want to use 
the Bug Tracking module specifically for software-related problems because 
bugs are generally tied to a specific release version of your software. In fact, 
if you’re a software developer, you’ll probably find that the folks in your Q&A 
department will love the Bug Tracker because it will allow them to easily 
identify software defects — and hopefully get the bugs corrected in the next 
release of the software.
Waiter! There’s a bug in my software!
Sugar’s Bug Tracker module allows you to report, track, and manage product 
bugs. After you create a bug, you can associate it with a related Cases record. 
Alternatively, you can create a bug directly from a Cases record.
The first step in fixing bugs is to report them. When you report a bug, you are 
in essence identifying it for all to see. Here’s how it’s done:
 
1. Click Bug Tracker on the Module Tab bar on Sugar’s Home page.
 
 The Bugs Tracker Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Report Bug from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Bugs page opens, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
3. Enter information for the bug fields:
 
 Subject is the only mandatory field. However, the more information you 
add, the more helpful it will be toward resolving a problem.
 
• Number: No worries, here. Sugar fills in the number automatically.
 
• Priority: Specify the urgency of the problem from the drop-down 
list.
 
• Type: Choose the type of problem you’re dealing with from the 
drop-down list.
  
 The administrator can make changes to the drop-down lists to give 
you choices that better fit your needs. Not sure how to get that 
done? Hand him a nice bribe — and direct him to Chapter 15.
 
• Source: Bugs reporting can come from a variety of places — internally 
from your own staff or externally from your customers.

179
 Chapter 11: Keeping Bugs Out of the Sugar Bowl
 
Figure 11-1: 
Helping to 
stamp out 
bugs.
 
 
• Category: Select the portion of your product associated with the bug. 
For example, the bug might deal with e-mailing, printing, or saving.
 
• Found in Release: Bugs are often fixed in later releases so it’s impor-
tant to know what version a user is using when they report a bug.
  
 Along with a corner office and large salary, the administrator is the 
person responsible for making sure that all your software versions 
are listed here.
 
• Subject: Enter a brief statement of the problem.
 
• Assigned To: Click the Select button to select the name of the lucky 
individual who’s responsible for fixing the bug. By default, that 
lucky person is you.
 
• Status: Indicate whether the bug is New, Fixed, or Mind-Boggling 
from the drop-down list.
 
• Resolution: Select the resolution to the bug, such as Fixed in Later 
Version, or Not Able to Replicate.
 
• Fixed in Release: Indicate the product version in which the bug was 
fixed.
 
• Description: Here’s where you can expand on the subject if you 
need to describe the bug with a bit more detail.
 
• Work Log: Use this field to record the steps you’ve taken to try to 
stamp out the bug.
 
4. Click Save to report the bug.
 
 The Bug Detail view displays on the screen.

180
Part III: A Spoonful of Sugar Keeps Your Customers Happy 
It’s a case of too many bugs
While Sugar can’t help you to fix the bugs in your software, it can help you 
keep them organized so that eventually you’ll have enough information to 
stamp them out. The Bug Tracker Home page is a great place to keep track of 
your bugs. On this page, you can create a new bug, view the details of a bug 
by clicking its subject, or edit an existing bug by clicking the Edit (pencil) 
icon.
The Bug Detail view, shown in Figure 11-2, is the hub of the Bug Tracker.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The Bug 
Detail view.
 
As is the case with all the other record types, the Bug Detail view contains 
many subpanels. You can use the Activities subpanel to schedule a task, 
meeting, or call, or to compose an e-mail. The Contacts and Accounts 
subpanels give you the opportunity to associate the bug with one of your 
Contacts or Accounts records.
The Cases subpanel is the one that you’ll probably find to be the most help-
ful. By associating existing Cases records to a bug, you can get a feel for how 
prevalent the bug is — or in what situations it’s likely to appear.
 
So far, you’ve read how to report a bug. If you have the Professional version 
of Sugar, you can also create and run a bug report. Chapter 14 shows you how 
to create reports; any reports that are based on the Bug Tracker module will 
automatically appear when you click the Bug Reports shortcut on the Bug 
Tracker Home page.

181
 Chapter 11: Keeping Bugs Out of the Sugar Bowl
Focusing on Forums
A forum is an online discussion group. Sometimes called newsgroups, forums 
allow participants with common interests to exchange ideas. Forums are typi-
cally based on a topic that is of interest to most members of the group. The 
group members then post threads or messages to the forum. Sugar’s Forum 
module is a great way to allow your users to collaborate on a variety of 
topics, such as bugs, sales, and marketing — and find out what the members 
of your staff are thinking.
 
The Forums module is not a core Sugar module. The administrator must 
download from it from SugarExchange using the Module Loader.
In case you’ve never visited a forum, I want to give you a bit of an idea about 
how they work. A database administrator — or the big kahuna — decides 
that he’d like to have an online area to discuss ideas. He starts the forum by 
creating several generic topics. For example, a company that manufactures 
software might have one topic pertaining to sales and another pertaining to 
software bugs. After the topics are established, end-users post forums to the 
topics, such as “anyone encountering a printing bug” or “tips for increasing 
end of the month sales.” At that point, other users post threads, or comments, 
pertaining to the forums. Generally, several forums are going on at one time; 
moreover, forums eventually die out and new ones constantly spring up to 
take their place.
Creating a forum one topic at a time
The first step to creating a forum is to find a good topic. After you create a 
forum, members post threads of discussion. Over time, you’ll find that some 
of your topics invoke a lot of response whereas other topics don’t receive 
any at all.
 
Creating topics is a job for the administrator of the database — if that’s not a 
part of your job description, then feel free to skip this section.
 
1. Click the Admin link on the Sugar Home page.
 
 The Forums Home page opens.
 
2. Click Forum Topics in the Forum Topics subpanel.
 
 The Forum Topic Home page opens.
 
3. Click the Create button.
 
 The Forum Topics Home page expands. If you’ve been following along at 
home, you should see a page similar to the one shown in Figure 11-3.

4. Enter Forum Topic title.
 
 You want to create topics that are of general interest to your group that 
will elicit conversation.
 
5. (Optional) Add an Order number.
 
 If you don’t supply a number, Sugar will assign the topic the next avail-
able one.
 
6. Click Save to save the topic.
Creating a forum
After the administrator creates some topics, it’s time for the users to start 
creating forums by posting to the topics. Hopefully, after a user creates a 
forum, other users will chime in and start responding to the forum — or 
create new forums of their own.
 
1. Click Forums on the Module Tab bar on the Sugar Home page.
 
 The Forums Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Create Forum from the Shortcuts menu on the Forums 
Home page.
 
 The Forums form opens, as shown in Figure 11-4.

• Description: Enter a brief description of the forum. Very often, this 
will be a problem you want some help with, or some cool trick you 
just discovered.
 
4. Click Save to save the forum.
 
 The new forum is now listed on the Forums Home page under the topic 
name.
Threading your way through the forums
Now that you’ve decided on the topics and users have started to create forums, 
it’s time for the real fun to start. Here’s where users can post follow-up mes-
sages, or threads. Here’s how to create a thread:

• Body: Here’s where you get to give your two cents worth. And 
those two cents can be formatted using the tools available on the

I
n this chapter, I show you how to configure Sugar so that you can send 
e-mail to an individual contact in your database, or to a selected group 
of contacts as part of a campaign. You also discover how easy it is to create 
e-mail templates to make your life even sweeter.
Getting Started with Sugar E-mail
An e-mail system consists of two separate but equal components: sending 
e-mail and receiving e-mail. Prior to sending e-mail from Sugar, you’ll need to 
set up at least one outgoing e-mail account. However, with incoming e-mail, 
you have a few more options available to you:
 
✓ Continue to use your existing e-mail client.
 
✓ Configure Sugar’s e-mail module.
 
✓ Use a plug-in to integrate Sugar and your existing e-mail client.
You must configure the following areas in order to use any of Sugar’s e-mail 
capabilities:
 
✓ Mail accounts: You must set up at least one e-mail account in Sugar 
to be able to send e-mail. Additionally, you need to set up an e-mail 
account for every external e-mail account that you want to access 
through Sugar.
 
✓ General settings: These are your e-mail preferences, such as your page 
layout. General settings apply to all of your e-mail accounts, but users 
can change these default settings.
 
✓ Folders: You can create folders to help keep your incoming e-mail organized.

Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Setting up outbound e-mail accounts
The administrator must create an e-mail account in order to send e-mail. The 
first — and most important — e-mail account is one that will allow you to 
send e-mail from Sugar. After all, you can continue to use your existing e-mail 
client to receive mail, but you’ll need to use Sugar if you plan to do cool 
things like e-mailing contracts, quotes, or campaigns.
Here’s how you create an e-mail account in Sugar for outbound e-mail:
 
1. Click the Admin link from any Sugar page and then click E-mail 
Settings in the E-mail subpanel.
 
 The E-mail Settings Configure page opens, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
2. Enter information for the following fields:
 
• From Name: Enter a name to identify this e-mail account.
 
• From Address: Enter the e-mail address associated with this 
account.
 
• SMTP Server: Enter the outgoing (SMTP) server’s address.
 
• SMTP Port: Enter the e-mail server’s port number; generally, it’s 25.
  
 The e-mail procedure explained in this section applies to SMTP e-mail. 
The instructions will vary slightly if you are using a different e-mail 
system.
 
3. (Optional) Add additional settings if your provider requires additional 
security settings.
 
 Some providers require SSL or SMTP authentication; feel free to add 
them if needed.
 
4. Click Save to save your settings.
 
 You’re now ready to start sending e-mail.

 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
Setting up inbound e-mail accounts
After you set up at least one outbound e-mail account, you’re ready to create 
a few inbound e-mail accounts. Inbound e-mail accounts can be accessed 
by a specific user or a group of users; therefore, you can set up group mail 
accounts to handle e-mail that is more general and individual e-mail accounts 
for specific usage by a single user. As a user, you can subscribe to group 
e-mail accounts that your administrator has created. For example, you and 
several other people might have access to the info@yourcompany.com 
mail account.
Follow these steps to configure your incoming group e-mail accounts:
 
1. Click the Admin link from any Sugar page and then click Inbound 
E-mail in the E-mail subpanel.
 
 The Inbound E-mail Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Monitor New Mail Account from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Inbound E-mail Setup window shown in Figure 12-2 opens.
 
3. Fill in the Basic Setup information for the incoming e-mail. Your 
system administrator or your Internet service provider (ISP) will provide 
most of this information to you.
 
• Name: Enter a name for the e-mail account.
 
• User Name: Enter the username you need to access your e-mail.
 
• Mail Server Address: Give the address of the incoming e-mail server.
 
Figure 12-2:

Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
• Mail Server Protocol: Choose either IMAP (normally used with an 
online e-mail client, such as Google or Yahoo!) or POP3 from the 
drop-down list.
 
• Password: Enter your e-mail password.
 
• Mail Server Port: The system automatically populates this field with 
the port number for the selected protocol.
 
• Use SSL: Select this box if your external e-mail account requires SSL.
 
4. Fill in the E-mail Handling Options section.
 
• Possible Actions: Specify the action that the individual or team is 
permitted to perform from the drop-down list. For example, e-mails 
to this address can be used to create a lead or for bug handling.
 
• From Name: Fill in your name or the name of the group handling 
the e-mail.
 
• From Address: Provide your e-mail address.
 
• Reply-to Name: Enter the name that will be associated with reply 
e-mails.
 
• Reply-to Address: Enter the e-mail address that will be associated 
with reply e-mails.
 
• Auto-Reply Template: Choose an existing e-mail template from 
the drop-down list if you want an automatic response sent to any 
e-mails that arrive at this e-mail account.
 
• No Auto-Reply to Domain: You can include a domain name that 
should not receive the automatic response e-mails.
 
• Assign To Group Folder: Choose a group folder from the drop-down 
list, or click Create to create a new one. Adding a group folder will 
allow several people to access the group e-mail account.
 
5. Click Save to save your changes.
Working with the Emails Module
The administrator has the job of setting up the initial outbound e-mail 
account and the group inbound e-mail accounts for all the users. He’ll most 
probably set up generic inbound accounts that will be used for general pur-
poses, such as information, customer service, or technical support. At that 
point, he can bid adieu to e-mail setup and turn the rest of the project over to 
the end-users.
If you’re a Sugar end-user, this section is for you because you’re going to 
setup your personal incoming e-mail account — unless Mr. Administrator 
responds well to bribes — and tweak your e-mail preferences.

191
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
 
If you are using your own e-mail client, such as Outlook — or you have purchased
a link between your e-mail client and Sugar — feel free to skip this section.
You begin your voyage into Sugar’s Emails module by clicking Emails on the 
Module Tab bar. The Sugar Emails page shown in Figure 12-3 opens.
To understand the e-mail portion of SugarCRM fully, you must understand 
the concept of the e-mail client. An e-mail client is an application that 
runs on a personal computer or workstation and enables you to send, 
receive, and organize e-mail. Sugar’s Emails module provides you with the 
following functionality:
 
✓ Access e-mail without downloading them into your Sugar database.
 
✓ Import incoming e-mail into Sugar to the My E-mail folder. Once 
imported, you can associate an imported e-mail with a Sugar record, 
such as a Bugs or an Accounts record.
 
✓ Archive outgoing e-mail that you sent to Sugar. For example, you might 
send an e-mail from Outlook and then use the Sugar Outlook Plug-in to 
create an e-mail record in Sugar.
 
✓ Search for e-mail based on various criteria, such as keyword and subject.
 
✓ Create a related record, such as a Bugs or a Leads record, from an 
e-mail message.
 
✓ Create an address book of the users, contacts, and leads to whom you 
often send e-mail.

Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
The Check Email, Compose Email, and Settings options appear at the top of 
the page. The remainder of the Emails module Home page is divided into three 
panels: Shortcuts, Folders, and Inbox. The Folders panel includes the Folders 
tab, the Search tab, and the Address Book tab; you might want to flip to the 
Search tab to hunt down an old e-mail that you’re having trouble locating (see 
Figure 12-4), or access the Address Book tab to find someone’s e-mail address.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Searching 
for a lost

message.
 
Any incoming e-mail accounts that your administrator has set up for you 
appear at the top of the Folders window along with an Inbox subfolder. Once 
received, you can organize your e-mail into folders that you create in the My 
Email folder.
You’ll find three Views icons at the top of the Inbox panel, which unfortunately 
aren’t labeled. The first icon displays a list of the messages in your Inbox. The 
second shows a list of your e-mail messages in the top panel and the contents 
of the currently selected message in the bottom panel. The third icon seems to 
display exactly the same view as the second icon; however, the e-mail viewing 
area is increased by removing access to the other Sugar module tabs.
Setting up inbound e-mail accounts: Part 2
Earlier in this chapter, you find that the administrator can set up an outgoing 
e-mail account and optionally configure incoming accounts as well. For those 
of you who don’t have a nice administrator to do this work for you — or if 
you have numerous e-mail accounts that you monitor — you can set up addi-
tional accounts through the Emails module’s Settings tab.

193
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
You must set up an e-mail account in Sugar for every external e-mail account that 
you want to access through Sugar. Sugar automatically creates an Inbox folder 
for every e-mail account that you configure. Additionally, you can create subfold-
ers under that Inbox to help keep yourself — and your e-mail — organized.
To set up an e-mail account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Emails module tab and then click the Settings tab.
 
 The Emails Settings window opens.
 
2. Click the Mail Accounts tab.
 
 If you’ve been following along at home, the Mail Accounts tab should 
look like the window shown in Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
Configuring 
a personal 
incoming 
e-mail 
account.
 
 
3. Choose None from the Active Mail Accounts field.
 
 Alternatively, if you need to edit an existing incoming e-mail account, 
choose the name of the account from the drop-down list.
 
4. Enter a name for the account in the Name field.
 
 You’ll probably want the name of the account to coincide with the name 
of the e-mail account that you are receiving, so name it something like 
Info or Tech Support — or your name.
 
5. Enter information into the following fields:
 
• From Name: Your name.
 
• From Address (required): The e-mail address that will be used on 
any outgoing correspondence.

194
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
• User Name (required): Your e-mail username for the account.
 
• Password (required): Your password for the account.
 
• Mail Server Address, Mail Server Protocol, and Mail Server Port (all 
required): Your ISP will provide the mail server address, protocol, 
and port number.
 
6. Choose the Outgoing Mail Server from the drop-down list.
 
 Specify the default e-mail server for your company from the drop-down 
list, or add a new one by clicking the Add button and filling in the appro-
priate SMTP information given to you by your ISP.
 
7. Click the Test Settings button to ensure that all your settings are correct.
 
 A little window will pop open requesting that you cool your jets 
while Sugar verifies your information. If all entries are correct, you’re 
rewarded with a message telling you that your setup is correct.
 
8 Click Save to create the e-mail account.
 
 Sugar creates the e-mail account — and collects any e-mail waiting to be 
delivered.
 
9. Click Close to return to the Emails module Home page.
Personalizing your e-mail
You can set a number of e-mail preferences. These preferences include how 
you view your incoming e-mail and how others view e-mails you send.
 
1. Click Emails on the Module Tab bar and then click the Settings tab.
 
 The Emails Settings window opens.
 
2. Click the General tab.
 
 The Settings window opens, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
3. Configure your e-mail Preferences.
 
• Check for New Mail: Determines how often you want Sugar to check 
for incoming e-mail.
 
• Send Email as Plain Text: Select this check box to send e-mails in 
plain-text format rather than as HTML.
 
• Copy to Sent Email: Select this check box to store a copy of your 
outbound e-mail in the Sugar database.
 
• Signatures: Click Create, enter your full name, and format your sig-
nature as HTML or plain text.

Filing e-mail in e-mail folders
In Sugar, the two types of e-mail folders are
 
✓ Local folders: Folders created by individual users to group and organize 
their own specific e-mail.
 
✓ Group folders: Folders set up by the administrator to organize incoming 
e-mail that is more department-specific.

196
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
In the earlier “Setting up inbound e-mail accounts” section, you saw how 
the administrator could set up group e-mail folders when he configured the 
group incoming e-mail addresses. In this section, you discover how to use the 
group folders — and make a few folders of your own.
Creating local folders
You create local folders directly on the Emails module Home page. The first 
time you access the Emails module, you’ll notice several folders that Sugar 
automatically configured for you:
 
✓ An Inbox for each of your personal e-mail accounts. Mail in this folder 
is not stored in the Sugar database.
 
✓ Group folders that the administrator has created. Group folders are 
identified by an icon of three little people.
 
✓ The My Email folder, which holds e-mail that is stored in the Sugar 
database.
 
 The My Email folder is divided into two subfolders:
 
• My Drafts, which holds e-mail you’ve written but not sent.
 
• Sent Emails, which is the folder that holds all your sent e-mail.
You can create additional folders under the My Email folder to organize the 
e-mail that comes into your own specific account. You can also create sub-
folders under your group folders to help organize your departmental e-mail.
To create additional folders:
 
1. Right-click the My Email folder on the Emails Home page and select 
Create Folder.
 
 The Add New Folder dialog box displays.
 
2. Enter a name for the folder and click OK.
 
3. (Optional) Right-click the new folder to create a subfolder, enter a 
name for the subfolder, and then click OK.
You follow the exact same procedure to create a subfolder under a group 
folder. Refer to Figure 12-3 to get an idea of a typical folder structure.
Choosing your folders
Users have the option of determining which folders they would like to access. 
It’s easy to decide which group folders you have access to — and which ones 
you want to access — by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Emails module tab from any Sugar window and then select 
the Settings tab.

197
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
 
Figure 12-7: 
Deciding 
which folder 
you want to 
access.
 
 
2. Select the Folders tab from the Settings window.
 
 The Folders window opens, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
3. Make the desired folder changes.
 
• To select your personal folders: Hold down your Ctrl key and click 
the desired folders in the Available User Folders panel.
 
• To select group folders: Hold down your Ctrl key and click the 
desired folders in the Available Group Folders panel.
 
• To rename a folder: Select a folder name from the Edit Group 
Folder drop-down, modify the name in the New Folder field, and 
click save.
 
 Wondering how to rename local folders? Don’t let the name Edit 
Group Folder fool you because all your folders are listed there and 
can be renamed.
 
• To create a new group folder: Type a name in the New Folder field 
and then click the Add New Group Folder button.
 
4. Click Close to save your changes.
 
 Don’t panic if you don’t immediately see your new folders. They will 
magically appear the next time your browser refreshes.
Creating an Address Book
In the upcoming sections are a number of ways to generate outgoing e-mail in 
Sugar. One way is to use entries in Sugar’s Address Book.

198
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
If you generate your e-mail using one of the other methods — or are using a plug-
in to connect Sugar to your existing e-mail client — you can skip this section.
The idea here is to add the people you frequently e-mail to the Address Book. 
The benefit of the Address Book is that Address Book contacts will auto-
populate when you type the first couple of letters of a recipient’s name into a 
blank e-mail message.
Here’s how to add entries to the e-mail Address Book:
 
1. Click the Emails module tab from any Sugar window and then select 
the Address Book tab from the left panel of the Emails Home page.
 
 You can see what the Address Book looks like in Figure 12-8.
 
2. Click the Add Entries button.
 
 The Select Address Book Entries window opens.
 
3. Fill in the name of the person who you want to add to the Address 
Book and then click the Search button.
 
 Although the Address Book is separate from the other modules, a 
person must already exist in a Contacts, Leads, Targets, or Users 
module in order to be added to the Address Book.
 
4. Select the e-mail address of the person you want to add to the Address 
Book and then click Add.
 
 Figure 12-9 shows you what the process looks like.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 if you want to add more names to the Address 
Book and then click Close.
 
 The new entries appear in your Address Book.

Creating E-mail Templates
Before you can win friends and influence prospects with your dazzling dis-
play of personalized e-mail documents, you need two things: the data and the 
document template.
 
You’re creating a template, not a document. A document is a plain old file that 
you create, use once, and store for posterity. A template is a form that merges 
with your contact information that is used over and over again.
A template is a form that contains placeholders that are filled with informa-
tion from your database. Using Sugar to create e-mail templates enables you 
to send personalized e-mail to each recipient. For example, you routinely 
might want to send thank-you e-mails to your contacts and not have to rein-
vent the wheel each time.
You can create a template by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Emails module tab from any Sugar window and then select 
the Create Email Template from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Email Templates page (see Figure 12-10) opens.
 
2. Give the template a name and optional description.
 
 After all, if you go to all the effort of creating a template, you may as well 
be able to find it again!

200
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
3. Supply a subject line and start filling in your message.
 
 Nothing new under the sun here. The template editor includes all the 
standard formatting options, such as font, size, bold, and italics. For 
your added fun and enjoyment, you can also embed images and add URL 
links.
 
4. Click the spot in your document where you want to insert a field.
 
 You need to let Sugar know where you want to insert your data place-
holders.
 
5. Determine what type of field you want to insert into your template 
from the Insert Variable drop-down list.
 
 Basically, you can insert either Account fields, or fields from your 
Contacts, Leads, Targets, and Users records.
 
6. Select a field and then click Insert.
 
 Your field choices will change depending on your variable type. Sugar 
will display the official field name and then place it into your template.
 
7. Click Save to create the template.
 
 You can use the template whenever you send an outgoing e-mail — and 
use it in your marketing campaigns.

E-mailing Your Contacts
A benefit of sending e-mail from within SugarCRM is that a history of the 
event is added to your Contacts record’s History subpanel each time you 
send an e-mail. E-mail is an increasingly popular form of communication, so 
having a record of all the e-mail that you send to each of your contacts helps 
you keep track of it all.
You can send e-mails to users, contacts, leads, and anyone else for whom 
you have an e-mail address. When you compose an e-mail, you can choose 
to send it using any of the e-mail accounts that you have configured. You can 
create your message from scratch using the e-mail editor, or you can use a 
pre-designed template.
Follow these steps to send an e-mail in Sugar:
 
1. Create a new e-mail message using one of the following methods:
 
• Click the contact’s e-mail address in either the List or page Detail view.
 
• Add the contact’s e-mail address to the Address Book, click Compose 
Email in the Emails module, and have the address auto-populate in 
the To field.
 
• Click Compose Email in the Emails module and manually fill in the 
e-mail address.
 
 These methods all result in a new message (see Figure 12-11). Notice 
that if you used either of the first two methods, the contact’s name 
already appears in the To field.
 
Figure 12-11: 
Creating an

202
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
2. Choose an e-mail account from the From drop-down list if you created 
more than one e-mail account in Sugar.
 
3. (Optional) Add the names of additional individuals who will receive a 
copy of the e-mail.
 
4. Fill in the Subject field.
 
5. Create your message using one of the following methods:
 
• Enter the text in the body field.
 
• Click Options and choose a template from the Templates drop-down 
list. While you’re there, you might want to choose a signature from 
the Signatures drop-down list.
 
6. (Optional) Click the Attach Files button to attach a file to the e-mail.
 
 The Attach options page appears in the right panel. Click Add File from 
File System to attach a file located on your computer, or click Add 
Documents from Sugar Documents to attach a file that’s been saved to 
Sugar.
 
7. Click Send to send the e-mail or click Save Draft to save the e-mail as a 
draft.
 
 Off your e-mail goes, hurtling through cyberspace. You can see the mes-
sage in the Sent Emails folder or by looking at the History subpanel of 
the Contacts record’s Detail view.
Viewing and Managing E-mails
Sugar makes a distinction between incoming e-mail and incoming e-mail 
that is actually imported into the Sugar database. The distinction is even 
clearer when looking at the e-mail folders. The top set of folders contains 
the e-mail accounts that you’ve set up in Sugar; each account has a single 
Inbox. However, any e-mails that appear in the group or the My Email folders 
are e-mails that have been imported into Sugar. When a new e-mail message 
arrives, you have the option of either leaving it in the Inbox or importing it to 
Sugar.
Importing an e-mail message to Sugar
After you view an e-mail in the Sugar Inbox — and decide it’s a keeper — 
follow these instructions to import it to your Sugar database:

203
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
 
1. Check for new e-mail by clicking the Check Mail button in the Emails 
module.
 
 Any new messages that arrive on the scene will appear in your Sugar 
Inbox. Alternatively, you can review the earlier “Personalizing your 
e-mail” section and request that Sugar automatically check for e-mail at 
regular intervals.
 
2. Right-click the message you want to import to Sugar and choose 
Import to Sugar from the contextual menu.
 
 The Import Settings window opens (see Figure 12-12).
 
Figure 12-12: 
Importing an 
e-mail into 
Sugar.
 
 
3. (Optional) Assign the e-mail to another user.
 
 By default, the e-mail is already assigned to you.
 
4. Choose a record type from the Relate To drop-down list.
 
 You can associate an e-mail with virtually any type of Sugar record, 
including Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, or Bugs.
 
5. Fill the name of the record that you want to link to the e-mail.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Select button and browse to the name.
 
6. (Optional) Select the Delete Message from Server check box if you also 
want to delete the message from the external e-mail server and the 
Inbox.
 
7. Click the Import to Sugar button.
 
 The imported e-mail will now appear in the My Email folder. From there 
you can drag it to one of your subfolders if you want. It will also appear 
in the History subpanel on the related record’s Detail view. Once you 
place an e-mail on the History subpanel, any other Sugar users with 
access to that record will also have privy to the e-mail message.

204
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Creating a record from an e-mail
In the above section, you take an incoming e-mail message and quickly 
associate it with an existing record. That method works great if the record 
already exists in Sugar, but how about times when you receive e-mail from a 
perfect stranger? And, more importantly, you want to archive that message 
as well.
One of the nicest features about Sugar is that it is just so darn accommodating — 
and tries to fulfill your every wish. Here’s how you can create a new record on 
the fly from an incoming e-mail:
 
1. In the Emails module, open the e-mail you want to associate with a 
new record.
 
2. Click Quick Create and choose Bugs, Cases, Contacts, Leads, or Tasks 
from the drop-down menu.
 
 The appropriate Quick Create form displays. Figure 12-13 shows you 
what the new Contact form looks like.
 
3. Fill in as much information as you can.
 
 Sugar helps you a bit here by filling in the contact’s name and e-mail 
address if the sender has included them in the header of the e-mail.
 
4. Click Save to save the new record.
 
 Like magic, the e-mail message will attach to Sugar and appear in the My 
Email folder. Better yet, you’ll have a new record in your database — the 
e-mail message is accessible from the History subpanel.

 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
Working with group folders
You may have discovered numerous features in Sugar that help it live up to 
its CRM moniker. And, hopefully, you realize that Sugar can automate many 
of your routine business processes. For many of you, the group folders fea-
ture will be the proverbial icing on the Sugar cake.
Group folders are those folders that the administrator sets up to help pro-
cess e-mail accounts that might be accessed by a department rather than 
by a specific individual. For example, most companies have an info e-mail 
account that might receive hundreds of e-mails a day. Thankfully, Sugar can 
make mincemeat of that large load if you follow these steps:
 
1. Select a group folder from the Folders list on the Emails module Home 
page.
 
 Any e-mails in the group folder display in the right panel.
 
2. Select the message(s) you want to process, right-click the message(s), 
and choose Assign To from the contextual menu.
 
 The cool thing here is that you can process more than one message at a 
time. Hold down the CTRL key and select as many messages as you need.
 
3. Click the Users icon in the Assignment window.
 
 Figure 12-14 shows the Assignment window.
 
 You can select a single person to assign the e-mail to, pick specific 
users, or assign it to everyone in the group.
 
4. Choose a rule from the Rules drop-down list.
 
 You have a few choices here:
 
• Direct Assign: Assigns the e-mail to the specific user you selected.
 
• Round Robin: Distributes the e-mails evenly between the selected 
users.
 
• Least Busy: Assigns the e-mails to the user who has the shortest list 
of assigned e-mails.
 
5. Click Assign.
 
 Poof. The e-mail disappears from the group folder and magically reap-
pears in the My Email folder of the assigned user(s). Talk about magic!

Changing Your Outlook on Sugar
Some Sugar users find themselves needing to use Outlook for a variety of 
reasons. For instance, your company might use Outlook to maintain the com-
pany calendar. Fortunately, you can use both Outlook and SugarCRM if you 
install the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook.
 
The plug-in is included with both the Professional and Enterprise versions 
of Sugar. If you’re using the Community Edition, you can subscribe to it on a 
yearly basis.
If you are using the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook, you can synchronize 
your Outlook e-mail, contacts, calendar, and tasks to Sugar directly from 
Outlook. Synchronized e-mails will land in the My Email folder, tasks and 
appointments will land in your calendar, and your contacts will transform 
into Sugar accounts or contacts. Additionally, you can attach your Outlook 
e-mail to various record types, such as Accounts, Opportunities, or Bugs.
After you install the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook, you notice a Sugar 
toolbar in Outlook, as shown in Figure 12-15.

207
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
The toolbar changes slightly when you wander into different areas of Sugar.
 
After you install the Outlook plug-in, you can change various Sugar options by 
accessing Tools➪Sugar Options in Outlook. Here’s where you’ll enter your Sugar 
username, password, and the URL you use to access your Sugar database.
Archiving e-mail
The Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook provides a quick way to attach an e-mail 
to a Sugar record. You can attach an e-mail to the following record types:
 
✓ Accounts
 
✓ Contacts
 
✓ Leads
 
✓ Bugs
 
✓ Cases
 
✓ Opportunities
 
✓ Projects
Once attached, the e-mail appears in the History subpanel of that record 
where you can click the e-mail link to view the details of the e-mail.
Archiving outgoing e-mail
The Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook allows you to send an e-mail and 
attach it to a Sugar record in pretty much the click of a button if you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Create a message in Outlook following your normal procedures.
 
2. Click the Send and Archive button in Outlook’s message toolbar.
 
 The Archiving Email window (see Figure 12-16) appears.
 
3. Fill in the information about the record you’re searching for.
 
 By default, the e-mail address you’re sending the e-mail to will already 
appear.
 
4. Select the check box(es) for the record type(s) you’re searching for 
and then click the Search button.
 
 In the wink of an eye, Sugar finds the appropriate record(s).

208

an outgoing 
message to 
Sugar.
 
 
5. (Optional) Click the Edit Email tab and change the information that 
will be attached to the Sugar record.
 
 By default, your e-mail message will appear. However, you can add addi-
tional comments or remove extraneous information that you don’t want 
to archive.
 
6. Click Archive and then click Close.
 
 The contents of your e-mail message will be attached to the appropriate 
Sugar record and then sent to the intended recipient.
Archiving incoming e-mail
The Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook really shines when it comes to 
attaching incoming e-mail from Outlook to Sugar. The three methods for 
attaching an incoming e-mail are

209
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
 
✓ Right-click the incoming message from Outlook’s Inbox and choose 
the Archive to Sugar option. As you can see in Figure 12-17, Sugar 
automatically identifies the sender and matches her to a record in your 
Sugar database. Click the sender’s name, and the message is immedi-
ately attached to the record in Sugar.
 
✓ Select the message from the Inbox and click the Archive to Sugar 
button on the Outlook toolbar. This option opens the Archiving Email 
window (refer to Figure 12-16). By following the instructions discussed 
in the previous section, “Archiving outgoing e-mail,” you can edit the 
message if necessary prior to attaching it to Sugar.
 
✓ Open the message and click the Archive to Sugar button conveniently 
located in the message toolbar. This also opens the Archiving Email 
window.
If Sugar can’t find an appropriate matching record for an incoming message, 
you can create a new Sugar Contacts or Leads record by right-clicking the 
message and choosing one of those options. The Quick Create window (see 
Figure 12-18) appears, allowing you to fill in the basic record information. To 
speed the process even further, Sugar fills in as much information as it can 
garner from the header information of the incoming e-mail.
 
Need to attach several incoming messages from the same sender? Hold down 
the CTRL key, select the messages in your Inbox, right-click anywhere in the 
highlighted area, and select the record’s name. The messages dispatch to 
Sugar immediately.

Not sure whether you’ve archived a message to Sugar? There are a number of 
ways to tell.
 
✓ Right-click a message and choose Options; SugarCRM will display in 
the Categories field.
 
✓ The message’s flag changes to red.
 
✓ You see the View in Sugar option when you right-click the message 
in Outlook. Click it, and you’re transported to the Details view of the 
record where you can see the e-mail in the History subpanel.
Connecting contacts to Sugar
The Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Outlook allows you to synchronize your 
Outlook contacts with your Sugar records. Changes made to contacts in 
either database are updated through the synchronization process.
 
Creating and maintaining two separate databases is very time-consuming — 
and can very easily lead to unnecessary duplication.
Marking existing Outlook contacts for synchronization
Here’s how you can begin the synchronization process:
 
1. Navigate to the Contacts folder in Outlook and then select the contacts 
that you wish to synchronize to Sugar.

211
 Chapter 12: Adding Sugar to Your E-mail
 
 You can hold down the CTRL key and “cherry pick” the contacts or hold 
down the CTRL key and tap the letter A to select all contacts.
 
 When you first install the plug-in, none of your Outlook contacts syn-
chronize to Sugar until you mark them for synchronization. You can 
double-check that an Outlook contact will synchronize to Sugar by open-
ing the contact in Outlook where you’ll see SugarCRM in the category 
field. In Sugar, a check mark will appear in the Sync to Outlook field on 
the record’s Detail view.
 
 You can’t synchronize Outlook contacts that you’ve marked as Private.
 
2. Click the Sync to Sugar button.
 
 There is a moment of silence while Outlook checks your connection and 
sends your contacts to Sugar. If you look closely, a dialog box shows you 
the number of records being sent to Sugar.
 
 Sugar matches your Outlook and Sugar contacts based on the contact’s 
e-mail address, first name, and last name. If no matches are found, Sugar 
will create a new Contacts record on the Sugar side; you’ll be listed as 
both the creator and the person assigned to the record. Sugar will also 
attach the Contacts record to the appropriate Accounts record in Sugar; 
if it doesn’t find a match, a new Accounts record will be automatically 
created.
  
 Only those Sugar Contacts records with the Sync to Outlook check box 
selected and Outlook contacts with SugarCRM showing in the category 
field will synchronize.
Working with new Outlook contacts
During the synchronization process, Sugar hunts through your database look-
ing for Sugar records that match the information you’ve entered in Outlook. 
However, there is a little room for error. What happens if you forgot to mark 
an Outlook contact for synchronization? Comparatively, what if company 
names of two Outlook contacts are not an exact match and you end up with 
two separate — but equal — Accounts records in Sugar?
To avoid these unnecessary — and bothersome — problems, the Sugar plug-
in for Microsoft Outlook installs a toolbar directly on the contact record’s 
page in Outlook that allows you to do two things:
 
✓ Save and Mark for Sugar Synch: This saves you the trouble of having to 
go back and mark a new Outlook contact for Sugar synchronization.
 
✓ Set Company to Sugar Account: Here’s where you can associate the 
contact with an existing Sugar Accounts record now to avoid duplication 
later.

212
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Synchronizing your Outlook 
calendar and tasks
Attaching Outlook calendar items and tasks to Sugar uses pretty much the 
same methodology you use when attaching an Outlook contact to Sugar. You 
have the option of marking existing appointments or tasks to Sugar from an 
Outlook list showing those items, or you can opt to mark a new appointment 
or task during the creation process.
 
Because Outlook doesn’t make a distinction between calls and meetings, 
the calls and meetings that you create in Sugar appear as appointments in 
Outlook.
To synchronize your existing Outlook appointments and tasks to Sugar:
 
1. In Outlook, select the appointments or tasks that you want to synchro-
nize to Sugar and then click the Mark to Sync button in the Outlook 
toolbar.
 
 You can do this from just about any Sugar view. For example, hold down 
your CTRL key while selecting various appointments from Outlook’s 
monthly calendar.
 
2. Click Sync to Sugar in the Outlook toolbar.
 
 A dialog box keeps you posted on how many activities or tasks are syn-
ching to Sugar.
To synchronize new appointments and tasks to Sugar, simply click the Save 
and Mark for Sugar Sync button that appears at the top of the scheduling 
window in Outlook. The next time you click the Sync to Sugar button, any of 
the changes you’ve made to those activities in either Outlook or Sugar will 
update in both programs.

Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur 
in an Election Year
In This Chapter

▶ Keeping your eye on the target
▶ Creating a Leads form
▶ Creating templates and newsletters
▶ Diagnosing campaign issues
O
n the simplest level, you can use SugarCRM as a glorified Rolodex and 
be quite happy with a place to find basic contact information. However, 
if you’re at all interested in growing — or maintaining — the size of your busi-
ness, you’ll want to make use of the Campaigns module. You start by creating 
a Target List of the folks who will be the recipients of the campaign. Next, 
you decide exactly the type of collateral you’ll be sending them. You test 
the campaign process — and figure out ways to measure the ROI (return on 
investment). Finally, should you find that your campaign stalls at the time of 
blast-off, you need a way to figure out exactly what’s wrong.
Campaigns Module
Quite simply, a campaign is an activity — or series of activities — designed to 
accomplish a purpose. Just as a candidate campaigns to get elected, a sales 
manager campaigns to get products purchased. You measure the success of 
a political campaign by whether the candidate is elected; you measure the 
success of an advertising campaign by whether you see an increase in sales. 
And, to continue the analogy, should your campaign not attain the desired 
outcome, there’s nothing to prevent you from trying again!
Typically, a mass marketing campaign targets a specific group of individu-
als or businesses. Therefore, the campaign process begins with identifying 
targets and grouping them into a Target List. In addition, you can associate 

214
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities records with an existing campaign to get 
a better understanding of your campaign’s results. For example, you might 
want to know which specific Opportunities records were a direct result of a 
campaign.
Sugar gives you two options for creating a Campaigns record. You can find 
both options in the Shortcuts menu of the Campaigns module Home page:
 
✓ Campaign Wizard: This option steps you through the process of creat-
ing a campaign as well as all campaign-related tasks. Because so many 
steps are involved in creating a marketing campaign, it’s probably best 
to complete the wizard as thoroughly as possible and then go back to 
add more information later.
 
✓ Create Campaign (Classic): This option creates a basic Campaigns 
record; however, you’re responsible for completing the various other 
campaign-related tasks, such as specifying the e-mail settings all by your 
lonesome.
The Campaigns module is ideally suited for a variety of marketing efforts. 
Sugar excels with e-mail and e-newsletter campaigns; Sugar helps you by 
using merged documents, transmitting them to a Target List, and tracking 
their results. Sugar can also help automate snail-mail campaigns by merging 
a template with your Target List and creating labels. When you create other 
types of campaigns, such as radio, print ads, or telemarketing, you can’t exe-
cute the campaign directly from Sugar; however, you can create a Campaigns 
record to help you manually track the results.
 
If you plan to create Campaigns records using snail mail, you need to purchase 
a license for the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Word so that you can create per-
sonalized templates in Word and then merge them with your Sugar contact 
data. Chapter 8 shows you how to create mail merge templates.
 
The plug-in comes free with the Professional and Enterprise editions.
We’re Off to See the Campaign Wizard
Whew! You might be thinking such a powerful feature must be confusing and 
complicated. Fortunately, the handy dandy Campaign Wizard guides you 
through the process.
Follow these steps to create a new Campaigns record using the Campaign 
Wizard:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar window.
 
 The Campaigns Home page opens.

215
 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
 
2. Choose Campaign Wizard from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Campaign Wizard displays. You’ll probably find it easiest to use the 
wizard every time you create a new campaign, and then edit the vari-
ous stages manually. And, as Figure 13-1 shows, creating a campaign 
involves a lot of stages.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Launching 
the 
Campaign 
Wizard.
 
 
3. Select the type of campaign you want to create and then click Start.
 
 The next screen of the Wizard opens; Figure 13-2 shows an example of a 
Newsletter campaign.
 
 If you haven’t done so already, Sugar will prompt you to set up an e-mail 
account to handle any potential bounced e-mails. This isn’t a hard thing 
to do but must be performed by the database administrator; just make 
sure he knows the e-mail address you’ll be using.
 
4. Enter the basic campaign information and then click Next.
 
 You’ll want to record a few minor pieces of housekeeping information:
 
• Name: Give the campaign a name.
 
• Status: Choose a status from the drop-down list to let others know 
how far along you are in the campaign process.
 
• Assigned To: Supply the name of the person who is in charge.
 
• Frequency: If you’re creating a newsletter, you need to indicate how 
often you’ll be sending it.

216
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
• Start Date: Click the calendar icon to select the campaign’s start date.
 
• End Date: Click the calendar icon to select the campaign’s end date.
 
• Description: Give a description of the campaign if you think it 
needs one.
 
5. (Optional) Enter the campaign budget information and then click Next.
 
 This information is purely optional. However, if you’d like to calculate 
your ROI (return on investment), then you’ll want to figure out your 
budget and how much money you hope to make from your marketing 
endeavor. Later, you might want to edit this information to include the 
actual cost of the campaign.
 
6. Enter the tracker URL information and then click Create Tracker.
 
 A campaign e-mail can include text, images, and links directing your 
targets to other URLs. In case you wonder whether people are actually 
clicking the links in your e-blasts, you can set up a tracker URL to track 
the response to your campaign. The tracker URL keeps track of such 
information as the date, the time, and what domain the user was logged 
on to when she clicked the links.
 
 Sugar can create trackers for you — as well as a specific opt-out tracker 
that supplies a link for anyone who wishes to opt out of your newsletter. 
If you choose to create an opt-out link, Sugar automatically selects the 
Email Opt Out option on the target’s Detail view.
 
 As you see in Figure 13-3, you just need to supply a name for the tracker 
and decide whether you want to have an opt-out link; Sugar does the 
rest of the work for you.

URL track-
ing link is 
easier than 
you think.
 
 
 If you want to create additional tracker URLs, click Create Tracker 
again and enter the new tracker information. Click Next when you finish 
adding URL trackers.
 
7. Complete the Subscription Information page for your campaign.
 
 The Subscription Information page of the Campaign Wizard opens. A 
Sugar campaign requires three lists of people, or targets:
 
• Subscription List Name: These are the folks who you are either 
targeting for a marketing campaign or to whom you’re sending a 
newsletter.
 
• Unsubscription List Name: These are the people who no longer want 
to buy what you’re selling — or at any rate, don’t want to be both-
ered by future e-mails.
 
• Test List Name: This list comprises all of your e-mail guinea pigs. 
Over the years, you’ve probably been the recipient of a mailing in 
which the sender hits the Send button a tad too early. Hopefully, 
by sending to a test list, you can circumvent problems now instead 
of later.
 
8. Select your Target Lists and then click Save and Continue.
 
 Click Allow Select and then click the Select button to use an existing 
Target List, or click Auto-Create to create a new Target List. If you 
choose the Auto-Create option, Sugar will suggest a snappy name for the 
list; you can add more names to that list later. Figure 13-4 gives you an 
idea of what the finished product looks like.
 
 You just gotta love software that unobtrusively makes life easier for you. 
When you choose to select an existing target list, Sugar displays just 
the right types. For example, if you want to select a test list, Sugar only 
shows you existing test target lists.

and choos-
ing Target 
Lists.
 
 
9. Fill in the information on the Marketing Email page.
 
 The Marketing Email page you see in Figure 13-5 lets you specify how 
and when your newsletter or campaign is distributed. You want to indi-
cate the From Name, From Address, when you want your campaign to be 
sent, and the name of the template you’re using.
  
 Not sure how to create an e-mail template? A quick look at Chapter 12 
will show you how.
 
 The Email Marketing record that you create is a mandatory part of an 
e-mail campaign. If necessary, you can create multiple Email Marketing 
records. For example, if you’re sending a monthly newsletter, you’ll want 
to create an Email Marketing record for each issue.
 
10. Click Next to continue.
 
 This is the moment you’ve been waiting for: the final page of the wizard! 
Whew! You made it. At this juncture, you can send a test e-mail or sched-
ule the e-mail for a later transmission, as shown in Figure 13-6.

 Personally, I’d click Finish and go for a quick jog around the block, know-
ing that most of my work is complete and that I can tweak my campaign 
when I get back.
Creating Web-to-Lead Forms
If you surf the Internet, you’ve probably run across Web-to-lead forms. In 
general, a company’s Web-to-lead form prompts you for your contact infor-
mation in exchange for something you want. For example, you might have to 
fill out a Web-to-lead form to enter an online contest or to receive additional 
information about a product.
In essence, a Web-to-lead form is an easy way to harvest contact information. 
Typically, you place a link to a Web-to-lead form on your Web site. However, 
you can also place a link to a Web-to-Lead form in your campaign template. 
When the targets in your campaign click the link, they’re prompted to fill in 
the form. Sugar will take that information and update the Lead record in your 
Sugar database or add a new lead in case the template finds its way to a new, 
unsuspecting target. You can then use this information in future campaigns.
 
Although this chapter focuses on using a Web-to-lead form as a part of your 
campaign, you can also create a link on your Web site to a Web-to-lead form. 
Hopefully, visitors to your site will click the link — and submit their contact 
information.
Here’s how you easily create a Web-to-Lead form:
 
1. Click the Campaign module tab from any Sugar window and then 
choose Create Lead Form from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Create Lead Form page displays, as shown in Figure 13-7.

220
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
Figure 13-7: 
Creating a 
Web-to-lead 
form.
 
 
2. Click and drag the desired fields from the Available Fields panel to 
either the First Column or the Second Column panels.
 
 All the available Leads record fields appear in the Available Fields panel. 
If you would like to capture additional information, the administra-
tor needs to go to Chapter 15 and read how to use the Sugar Studio to 
create new fields in the Leads module.
 
3. Click Next to continue.
 
 The Form Properties page opens.
 
4. Enter the form information.
 
 This is probably one of the easiest forms you ever have to contend with 
because most of the information is already filled in for you.
 
• Form Header: Sugar automatically supplies a name; feel free to 
edit it.
 
• Form Description: Again, Sugar fills this in, but you’re free to 
change it at will.
 
• Submit Button Label: This is the button that recipients click to 
transmit the Web-to-lead form. You can change the wording to 
Click Me, Sign Up Here, or any other cute phrase that crosses your 
mind.
 
• Post URL: This is the location where the lead information is stored. 
If you want to change the URL, click Edit and change away.
 
• Redirect URL: This is where the recipient lands after he submits 
the form; you might choose your Web site or some other landing 
page.
 
• Related Campaign: Select the campaign that this form is linked to; 
this field is required.
 
 Not sure what to choose if the Web-to-lead form is placed on your 
Web site? Consider creating an ongoing campaign called some-
thing along the lines of “Web site Leads.”

221
 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
 
• Assigned To: By default, this is you, but you can click the Select 
button to select the name of another user if you prefer.
 
• Form Footer: Add a footer to the Web-to-lead form if you feel like 
there’s something you want to say on the form.
 
5. Click Generate Form.
 
 After a momentary pause, the form opens in the editor, as shown in 
Figure 13-8. You can beautify the form by changing its color, or by 
adding additional information and/or hyperlinks. Required lead fields 
automatically appear with an asterisk. Notice that the header of the form 
corresponds to the header you assigned in the previous step.
 
Figure 13-8: 
The Web-
to-lead form 
generator.
 
 
6. Click the Save Web To Lead Form button to save the form.
 
 You receive a prompt to download your Web-to-lead form followed by a 
hyperlink to your form. Copy the hyperlink and paste it into a template 
or onto a part of your Web site.
Targeting Your Targets
Your campaign is fairly complete: You’ve associated an e-mail account with 
the campaign, you’ve determined the template to use with your campaign, 
and you’ve scheduled a start date and time for the campaign. But wait — 
you’ve overlooked one key element of the campaign. A campaign is only as 
good as the list of people to whom you’re sending the campaign.
Keeping your eye on the Target List
If you start your campaign by using the Campaign Wizard, you have the 
opportunity to create three different types of Target Lists: campaign recipi-
ents, opt-outs, and test recipients. Once created, you can edit those Target 

222
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Lists to provide a few more details than what is available to you with the 
wizard. If you chose to create your campaign using the Create Campaign 
(Classic) method, you have to create the Target List from scratch.
Follow these steps to create a Target List.
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar screen and then 
choose Create Target List from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Target Lists page opens.
 
2. Enter the following information on the Target Lists page:
 
• Name: Give the Target List a name.
 
• Type: Specify the Target List type from the drop-down list. I 
mentioned three Target List types: default, which consists of the 
people receiving the campaign; suppression list, which are the 
opt-outs; and test, which is the sample group you send to prior to 
sending the campaign. However, you can also designate a Target 
List as a seed list — usually, this is the head honchos who need to 
see and review the Target List before it’s sent.
 
• Assigned To: Add the name of the person in charge of the list; by 
default, that person is you.
 
• Description: Optionally, enter a brief description of the Target List.
 
3. Click Save to save the target list.
Hitting the Target List with a few targets
In the previous section, you create a Target List, which is the list of recipi-
ents you want to reach with your campaign. Now you need to fill that list with 
contacts. A Target List can consist of four records:
 
✓ Targets: This is the low man on the totem pole. A target is a really cold 
prospect or lead. Targets are generally considered unqualified because 
you just don’t have much information on them yet. You can convert a 
Targets record to a Leads record.
 
✓ Leads: Leads are the next step up from targets. You might have quali-
fied a lead and have one or more opportunities associated with the lead. 
You can convert Leads records into Contacts, Opportunities, and/or 
Accounts records.
 
✓ Contacts: These are the folks that you’ve, well, made contact with — and 
have probably sold some of your wares to.
 
✓ Users: You might want to add database users to a test Target List so 
you can double-check the mechanics of your campaign before you set it 
loose on thousands of unsuspecting individuals.

223
 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
 
Notice that an Accounts record can’t be in a Target List. That’s because you 
send marketing collateral or newsletters to specific people.
Follow these steps to add new targets to your Target List:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar view and then click 
Create Target from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Targets page opens.
 
 Unlike Contacts, Leads, and Users records, you can only access Targets 
directly from the Campaign module. Additionally, Targets are stand-
alone records that can’t be associated with other types of records. If 
you plan to send your campaign to only existing Contacts, Leads, and/or 
Users records, skip to Step 4.
 
2. Enter any information that you have for the target.
 
 If you have a text file containing a list of brand-new targets, you can 
import that list. Click the Import link on the Shortcuts menu and navi-
gate to the saved file.
 
 By nature, you might not have much information about a target 
other than his name and e-mail address. You can add as many e-mail 
addresses as you want by clicking the Add Address link, filling in an 
address, and specifying whether the address is primary, opt-out, or 
invalid.
 
3. Click Save to create the target.
 
 When you save the target, the target’s Detail view displays. You’re now 
ready to add those targets — along with your existing Contacts, Leads, 
and Users records — to the campaign’s Target Lists.
 
4. Click Target Lists from the Shortcut menu and then click the name of 
the Target List you want to populate.
 
 The Target List Details view opens.
 
 Make sure you select the correct Target List. Adding contacts to the 
wrong Target List can result in disastrous results. If you followed 
the wizard, you might see three lists for each campaign, as shown in 
Figure 13-9. The main recipient Target List displays Default in the Type 
column; test lists display Test as the type, and Suppression lists display 
Suppression List.
 
5. Scroll to the appropriate subpanel and click the Select button.
 
 For example, if you want to add existing contacts to the Target List, scroll 
to the Contacts subpanel. In any event, the Search window will open.
 
6. Fill in your search parameters and click Search.
 
 Alternatively, you can scroll through the contacts and place a check 
mark next to any contacts that you want to include. Figure 13-10 shows a 
search of all existing customers who are assigned to Karen Fredricks.

 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
Let the Campaigns Begin!
By now, you might have a mental picture of yourself at the starting line. 
You’ve gone through the on your mark and get set stages of the race, er, cam-
paign. But hold on there — you need to attend to a few more housekeeping 
chores before hitting Go!
Look before you leap — or hit Send
Before you launch your e-mail or newsletter campaign, it’s important that 
you test it to make sure the thing is going to work. Consider the following 
important points:
 
✓ Test your e-mail preferences. You should test your e-mail preferences 
before sending your message to thousands of people. If you don’t, you 
might find yourself with a thousand e-mails in your Outbox that can’t be 
sent. Make sure your test Target List includes contacts from both inside 
and outside of your office.
 
✓ Test your e-mail template. Again, testing your message before send-
ing it across the universe is always a good idea. Having correct spelling 
and punctuation isn’t a bad idea, either. Make sure the graphics can be 
viewed correctly through a variety of different e-mail clients.
 
 You might discover that although your templates look picture perfect when 
you first create them in Word, they look a bit spacey when you attempt 
to use them as e-mail templates. You might find that your message now 
appears to be double-spaced. Basically, something was lost in the transla-
tion from Word to HTML. You can correct this quite simply by returning 
to the scene of the crime — or in this case, the original template — and 
holding down Shift each time that you press Enter to create a new line.
 
✓ Check with your ISP. Many ISPs have implemented safeguards against 
spam. Before you send an e-mail to all the contacts in your database, call 
your ISP to find out how many e-mails you can send at a time. If your ISP 
limits the number of e-mails you can send at one time, you need to send 
your mailings in smaller groups or purchase an add-on product that 
sends your e-mail in batches. You discover more about these products 
in Chapter 18.
 
✓ Read up on the Can Spam laws. Laws are in place that require your 
e-mail to contain various elements, including your correct contact infor-
mation and a way for recipients to opt out should they not want to hear 
from you.

226
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Here’s all you need to do to test your campaign:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar view, click 
Campaigns from the Shortcuts menu, and then click your campaign.
 
 The Campaign Detail view opens. You might want to take this oppor-
tunity to scroll down the page and make sure that a test Target List 
appears in the Target List subpanel, and that you have at least one 
record in the Email Marketing subpanel.
 
2. Click the Send Test button.
 
 The Send Test page opens. As shown in Figure 13-11, the test message 
will automatically send to your test list.
 
Figure 13-11: 
Sending 
a test 
message. 
 
3. Select the name of the campaign message you want to test.
 
 When you’re in the test mode, Sugar very cleverly disables your 
Suppression lists and then checks for duplicates. Therefore, you can 
send the test message multiple times until you get it right.
 
4. Click Send.
 
 This is a case of no news being good news. If all systems are go, you’ll 
return to the Campaign Detail view. If there’s a problem, Sugar rewards 
you with an error message. And, if you included yourself as one of the 
recipients in the test Target List, you can race over to your Inbox and 
take a look at the message.
Houston, we have a campaign problem
Running a campaign can seem a bit overwhelming. You have a template 
to produce. You have Target Lists to fill. You have tracker URLs to insert. 
You have Email Marketing records to create. You have a test to send. Holy 
guacamole — that’s a lot of details to take care of! In the previous section, 
you create a test message that confirms whether you dotted all your Is and 
crossed all your Ts.
After all that effort, it would be fairly mind-blowing to have a technical glitch 
prevent the campaign from staying on schedule. Unfortunately, although a 
regular user can perform all the campaign tasks mentioned above, only an 

227
 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
administrator can set up the actual e-mail handling portion of the campaign. 
Fortunately, Sugar comes with a neat Campaign Diagnostics tool that will put 
your mind at rest by confirming that the administrator has done her job — 
and you won’t be left in a finger-pointing match should the campaign go off 
schedule.
Follow these steps to run the Campaign Diagnostics tool:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar view and then choose 
Diagnostics from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Campaign Diagnostics page displays on the screen.
 
 Warning messages like the one you see in Figure 13-12 appear if the 
administrator has not configured the e-mail settings and bounce-handling 
options correctly.
 
2. (Optional) Contact your administrator to complete the necessary 
e-mail tasks.
 
 You might alternate between using threats and bribes, depending 
on which method works best with your administrator. Printing the 
Campaign Diagnostics screen and posting it throughout the office often 
works well, too.
 
3. Follow Step 1 above to return to the Campaign Diagnostics screen and 
then click the Re-Check button.
 
 At this point, all systems should be good to go.

Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
Managing your non–e-mail campaigns
I mentioned earlier that there are basically two types of campaigns — those 
that use e-mail and those that don’t. If you are using a non–e-mail campaign, 
such as a Telemarketing or a Mail campaign, you will need to make changes 
manually to the campaign to keep others updated on the status and success 
of the campaign.
Follow these steps to view the campaign’s details so that you can make 
changes:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar view, choose 
Campaigns from the Shortcuts menu, and then click the name of the 
campaign you wish to edit.
 
 Seems like a whole lot of steps, but by now you should feel pretty com-
fortable with navigating to a Detail view.
 
2. Click Edit to add additional campaign details and then click Save to 
save your changes.
 
 In particular, you might need to adjust these fields to help calculate 
your ROI:
 
• Impressions: This is the number of calls made, or items sent.
 
• Actual Cost: This is the amount that the campaign cost you.
 
 Sugar uses this information to automatically calculate a Cost Per 
Impression figure.
 
3. (Optional) Click Mail Merge to perform a mail merge.
 
 You’re now able to select the template you want to merge to your 
Target List.
  
 This option works only if you have the Sugar Mail Merge add-in for 
Microsoft Word.
 
4. Mark as Sent after you launch the campaign.
 
 You need to mark a non–e-mail campaign as sent to let other users 
know when the campaign has been launched. When you do this, the 
Campaigns subpanel on a target’s Detail view will show the status as 
Active.
Measuring the success of a campaign
As you can see, creating a campaign requires a lot of planning and work. As 
the saying goes: no pain, no gain. However, all your work won’t go unnoticed 
by the Sugar system — and hopefully not by your boss! After you launch a 

229
 Chapter 13: Campaigning Doesn’t Just Occur in an Election Year
campaign, you can head to the pool, grab a drink, and float into the sunset 
with visions of dollar signs dancing in your head. Alternatively, you might 
want to check on the outcome of the campaign.
The campaign’s Detail view allows you not only to view the current campaign 
status but the results as well. This information can help you plan future 
campaigns. For example, you might want to view the leads that came in as a 
result of the campaign and add them to a Target List for a future campaign, 
or add the opt-out records to a master unsubscribe Target List. You can even 
see the exact return on investment (ROI) of the campaign.
Because the campaign’s Detail view supplies you with so much information 
about the results of your campaign, you’ll want to head back there at least 
one more time:
 
1. Click the Campaigns module tab from any Sugar view, choose 
Campaigns from the Shortcuts menu, and then click the name of the 
campaign you wish to analyze.
 
 By now, you can probably open the campaign’s Detail view in your 
sleep, but it’s always nice to have instructions just in case!
 
2. Click the View ROI button.
 
 The ROI chart displays. Figure 13-13 shows you a sample of the data 
you’ll find for your campaigns. The ROI chart shows the actual revenue 
versus the expected revenue generated from the campaign, and the 
actual and budgeted cost of the campaign. In case you’re wondering, 
the revenue figure is a compilation of all new opportunities that users 
have attributed to the campaign; hopefully, that number will continue to 
increase every time you check the campaign’s ROI.
 
Figure 13-13: 
Analyzing a 
campaign’s 
ROI.
 

230
Part IV: Sharing the Sugar Bowl 
 
3. Click the View Status button.
 
 If you’ve created an e-mail campaign, you’re treated to a wide array of 
information. You’ll see a tracking chart of responses from campaign tar-
gets. This includes seeing how many people viewed the message, how 
many opened any links that were included in the campaign e-mail, and 
how many people chose to opt out of the campaign. You’ll even see the 
number of leads that were created as a result of your campaign. Talk 
about heavy-duty analysis!
 
 If that’s not enough, if you scroll to the bottom of the page, you’ll find 
subpanels listing the people who are graphically represented in the 
chart. For example, you’ll find lists of the people with bounced or invalid 
e-mail addresses as well as those who clicked through the various links 
in your campaign e-mail message. Most importantly, you’ll see a list of 
the opportunities that were created as a result of your campaign.

Working with 
Extra-Strength 
Sugar

In this part . . .
You may think that Sugar offers you everything you 
could ever want right out of the box. However, you 
might be interested in adding a few special features that 
are a part of the Professional and Enterprise editions of 
Sugar. Those of you who are so inclined — or who didn’t 
run fast enough — might want to add SugarCRM database 
administrator to your current job description. The 
database administrator is in charge of adding new fields 
to the database and making sure that they’re properly 
placed onto your layout. Your job as administrator also 
includes managing all of those tricky settings and user 
permissions. And, when things go wrong, guess whom 
everyone will turn to? Not to worry, though — just turn 
to this part for help.

Chapter 14
Sweetening the Deal
In This Chapter
▶ Adding a bit of Team Management
▶ Doing a bit of forecasting
▶ Reporting on your progress
▶ Working with Workflow
M
ost of this book covers functionality that you can get free with the 
Community Edition of Sugar. However, you may want to consider 
upgrading to a fee-based version of Sugar — particularly if your business 
consists of many users and requires a bit more organization than does a 
smaller business. In this chapter, I focus on four features available only in the 
Professional and Enterprise versions of Sugar: Team Management, forecast-
ing, reporting, and Workflow.
Being a Team Player
A team is a group of individuals who band together for a common goal. In Sugar, 
the Team Management option allows you to group users into teams — hopefully 
for the purpose of winning sales and satisfying customers. You can assign Sugar 
records, such as Accounts, Contracts, and Opportunities, to a specific team; 
once assigned, those records can only be accessed by members of that team.
Creating a team
By default, a private team is set up for each user and contains only that spe-
cific user. Sugar also sets up a Global team, which automatically includes all 
users. Any new records you create are automatically assigned to your team 
and, therefore, are visible only to you — unless you add other users to your 
private team or assign the record to a different team.

234
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Because new records are assigned by default to your private team, it’s good 
practice to set up teams prior to adding new records. However, should you 
find yourself with lots of records that need to be reassigned to a different 
team, don’t forget about the mass update feature on the various Home pages 
that allows you to make all those changes en masse.
Here’s how you can get the ball rolling and create a winning team:
 
1. Click the Admin link from any Sugar screen and then click Team 
Management from the Users subpanel of the Administration Home 
page to open the Teams Home page.
 
 Because creating and maintaining a team is a function of the coach, er, 
database administrator, it’s only logical that you manage your teams 
from the Administration Home page.
 
2. Choose Create Team from the Shortcuts menu of the Teams Home 
page.
 
 The Teams page opens. See it for yourself in Figure 14-1.
 
3. Fill in the team information.
 
 There’s really not much to do here other than to assign a team name 
and an optional description so don’t rack your brain trying to come up 
with a mascot or team colors.
 
4. Click Save.
 
 The Teams Home page appears — with your team on the roster.
 
5. Click the name of your team to open the Team Detail view.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Creating 
a winning 
team.
 

235
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
6. Click the Select button at the top of the Users subpanel.
 
 The User Search window opens. From here, you can search for a specific 
user or simply scroll through the list of users and select the one(s) you 
want to add to the team by selecting their check box.
 
7. Click the Select button.
 
 The selected users are now proud members of the team.
Being noticed by the team
E-mail is a great way to communicate. So great, in fact, that you might find 
yourself bombarded by lots and lots of e-mail — and lose an important mes-
sage or two in the bargain. Using Team Notices, the database administra-
tor can create broadcast messages to the members of the team. When the 
members log in to the database, they’ll see the announcements on the Team 
Notices dashlets of their Home page.
Here’s all you need to know to set up a team announcement:
 
1. Click the Admin link on any Sugar screen and then click Team 
Management in the Users subpanel of the Administration Home page 
to open the Teams Home page.
 
2. Choose Team Notices from the Shortcuts menu of the Teams Home 
page.
 
 The Team Notices Home page opens.
 
3. Choose Create Team Notice from the Shortcuts menu of the Team 
Notices Home page.
 
 The Team Notice form opens.
 
4. Fill in the pertinent information.
 
 You are, after all, creating an announcement so include all the appropri-
ate who, what, when, where, and whys. Figure 14-2 gives you an idea of 
what a Team Notice form looks like.
 
5. Click Save to save the announcement.
 
 The announcement will be visible to all the group members the next 
time they access their Home page.
Sure beats the heck out of a bulletin board — and you don’t have to search 
for a thumbtack!

Knowing which team to root for
Nothing’s worse than hearing the entire office discuss an upcoming event — 
and not being sure if you’re expected to attend! After your administrator has 
set up teams, check the roster to determine whether you made the cut.
If you find yourself unsure about your team status, there’s an easy way to 
find out your eligibility. Click My Account from any Sugar view and then 
scroll to the My Teams subpanel. Any groups you’re a member of are listed 
there. And, if you really want to feel like you’re a member of the in-crowd, 
click a group name, and you’ll be able to view a list of all the other group 
members.
The Forecast Is Looking Good
Chapter 7 focuses on the Opportunities module. The Forecasts module 
allows you to create quotas for your sales force — and measure its perfor-
mance based on actual sales and opportunities.
 
Forecast records are based on sales opportunities. Only those users who are 
listed as the assigned user of an Opportunities record can include the oppor-
tunity in a sales forecast.

237
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
A Forecast record consists of four parts:
 
✓ Time Period: A forecast is based on a time period. You can use tra-
ditional periods — months, quarters, or years — or you can define a 
custom period, such as a week or specific period.
 
✓ Forecast Schedules: After you set up a few time periods, you can create 
schedules by assigning a specific time period to various teams of users. 
For example, the region sales teams may have a monthly schedule, and 
the corporate sales team may have a quarterly schedule.
 
✓ Sales Quotas: The next step in the process is to set up sales quotas, or 
the amount of sales an individual is supposed to close during the given 
time period.
 
✓ Forecast Worksheet: The Forecast Worksheet reflects what sales people 
think they can produce in sales.
 
The first three steps of the forecasting process are performed by your 
friendly neighborhood database administrator. The final step — the Forecast 
Worksheet — is performed by the lowly worker ant.
 
After you create a Forecast record, you can add the My Forecast dashlet to 
your Home page so that you see it every time you log in to Sugar. You’ll see 
a visual comparison of your quota along with your closed opportunities and 
committed forecast. Not sure how to add something to your Home page? Take 
a peek at Chapter 9.
Creating Time Periods
Time flies when you’re having fun, and the administrator has the task of 
defining the Time Periods that will be used company-wide. For added fun and 
enjoyment, the administrator can also define the fiscal year for the company. 
After the administrator defines the time periods, the periods automatically 
appear in the Forecasts module where they can be attached to a forecasting 
schedule.
Follow these steps to create time periods:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then click Time Periods in the 
Forecast subpanel.
 
 As you might expect, the Time Periods Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Create Time Period on the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Time Period form page opens.

238
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
3.  Enter the appropriate information about the Time Period.
 
 As shown in Figure 14-3, this doesn’t involve much contemplation on 
your part. Enter a name for the Time Period, and then indicate a Start 
Date and End Date. If the Time Period corresponds with the Fiscal Year, 
feel free to select the Is Fiscal Year check box.
 
Figure 14-3: 
Defining a 
time period.
 
 
4. Click Save to save the Time Period.
 
 You are now free to roam around the cabin — or start working on those 
schedules.
I’m forecasting that there’s 
a schedule on the horizon
After you create a Time Period or two, it’s time to scurry around creating 
schedules. Fortunately for you, there’s not much involved in the process so 
you should be able to perform this feat in a small amount of time.
To create a Forecast Schedule:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then click Time Periods in the 
Forecast subpanel.
 
 The Time Periods Home page opens, this time with your Time Periods 
prominently displayed.
 
2. Click the name of the Time Period you want to include in a schedule.
 
 The Time Period Detail view opens with a chime. Okay, maybe I’m just 
hearing things, but all this talk about time might have you envisioning a 
row of ringing alarm clocks.
 
3. Scroll to the Forecast Schedule subpanel and click Create.
 
 The Forecast Schedule page opens.

239
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
4. Fill in the timely information.
 
 Again, it won’t take you much time to create the schedule information. 
Indicate when the schedule will start, whether it’s active, and specify the 
person for whom you’re creating the schedule. Figure 14-4 shows you 
the finished product. You can select the Cascade option if you want this 
information to roll into other user’s information that it relates to.
 
 The forecast start date determines the information you’ll see in the 
Forecast Worksheet. Generally, you want to set a date prior to the actual 
period so users can access the Forecast Worksheet prior to the Time 
Period.
 
Figure 14-4: 
Creating a 
Forecast 
Schedule.
 
 
5. Click Save to save the Forecast Schedule.
 
 Any schedules that you create will appear in the Forecast Schedule sub-
panel of the Time Periods Detail view, as shown in Figure 14-5.

Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Setting Quotas
After you create Time Periods and then use them to create Forecast 
Schedules, you’re ready to start setting up sales quotas for your users.
 
Time passes — at times too quickly. As time goes by, you have to continue 
to create new Time Periods and schedules. An administrator’s work is never 
finished!
Here’s how to quickly set up a Quota:
 
1. Select the Forecasts module from any Sugar screen.
 
 The Forecasts Worksheet opens. If you’re using the Forecasts module, 
you’ll see quite a bit of this page in the future.
 
2. Choose Quotas from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Quotas Home page opens.
 
3. Choose a Time Period from the drop-down list on the Quotas Home page.
 
 You can see why you need to set up those Time Periods prior to setting 
Quotas. After you select a Time Period, any existing Quota records for 
that period will display in the Quota List subpanel.
 
4. Fill in the new Quota information.
 
 Although forecasting requires many steps, the steps are baby ones. In 
this case, you just need to choose a user from the drop-down list, fill in 
a quota amount and the currency you’re using, and select the Commit 
Status check box to show that the Quota is Active. If you don’t select 
Commit Status, the Quota will show as Pending. Figure 14-6 shows an 
example of a Quotas Home page.
 
5. Click Save to save the Quota.
 
 The Quota now appears in the Direct Report subpanel.
 
The cool part here is that various users can access different quota informa-
tion. For example, a sales rep can only see his Quota record, whereas a man-
ager can change the Quota record. Feel free to flip ahead to Chapter 16 for a 
bit more about role management.
Working through the Forecast Worksheet
The Forecast Worksheet is the icing on the cake — and the final stage of 
the Forecast process. Sugar automatically takes Amount, Probability, and 
Weighted Amount information from your opportunities and plunks them into 
the worksheet. You add your best-guess estimates for what you think you can 
sell and sit back and let Sugar calculate everything for you.

241

Figure 14-6:

To edit the Forecast Worksheet:
 
1. Click the Forecasts module tab from any Sugar view.
 
 The Forecasts Worksheet appears.
 
2. Choose the Time Period from the Time Periods drop-down list.
 
 If you logged in as a regular user, you see only your data, and your 
Quota appears at the top of the page. If you logged in as a user with 
higher access privileges, you see data for the other users who report 
to you; you then have the option to view their specific information or 
a combined worksheet consisting of several users. Figure 14-7 shows 
you an example of a “rollup” worksheet that you’ll see if you log in with 
higher access privileges.
 
3. Enter the Estimated Best Case, Likely Case, and Worst Case forecasts.
 
 Sugar follows along and updates the Totals row for you.
 
4. Commit the amounts by clicking the Copy Values button, selecting 
Total Estimated Amounts, and then clicking the Commit button.
 
5. Click OK in the dialog box that appears.
 
 The committed amounts appear at the bottom of the worksheet along 
with the date that you entered the totals.
 
6. Click Save Worksheet to save your changes or Reset Worksheet if 
things don’t look right and you want to try again.

Figure 14-7: 
The

Viewing your Forecast Worksheet progress
The whole purpose of the Forecast Worksheet is to compare the actual sales 
to a pre-determined Quota. The worksheet enables sales managers to track 
sales for a specific Time Period by user, and allows users to see how they are 
measuring up to their Quota.
Charting your progress
The Rollup view accessed by a manager (refer to Figure 14-7) allows you to 
enter best- and worst-case sales scenarios. The manager can then click the 
View Chart button and view the chart, as shown in Figure 14-8.
The chart is a comparison of data that you’ve entered in a variety of Sugar 
modules:
 
✓ Quota: The sales goals set by the sales manager — or another power-to-be.
 
✓ Committed Forecast: The best-guess estimate for how likely the users 
are to achieve the Quota.
 
✓ Closed Opportunities: The total of all opportunities closed by the users 
during the given Time Period.
 
If you’re in the Rollup view, the chart portrays the totals of all the users. If you 
click a specific user’s name in the Forecast Worksheet, the chart displays only 
that user’s information.

Supercharging your Forecast Worksheet
At this point, most sales managers might think they’ve died and gone to heaven. 
However, Sugar has one more forecasting trick up its software sleeve — the 
ability to view more detail via the Forecast Worksheet.
If you are a manager, the Forecast Worksheet will list the various users in 
your sales department. And, you can drill down to garner more information 
on any one of them by simply clicking a name in the left pane of the Forecast 
Worksheet. The worksheet refreshes and provides you with a list of the 
user’s current opportunities, similar to what’s shown in Figure 14-9.
 
Figure 14-9: 
Focusing on 
one user’s 
informa-
tion in the

244
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Optionally, you can provide estimated Best Case, Likely Case, and Worst Case 
figures, although they will not “roll up” into the estimated figures for the user 
as a whole. The manager can also drill down on any specific opportunity that 
he wants to edit or view by clicking the down arrow next to the Opportunity 
name. A pop-up window similar to the one shown in Figure 14-10 opens, dis-
playing the Account name, probability percentage, and type; click the pencil 
icon to edit the opportunity if needed.

Forecasting your history
Although the thought of forecasting history is a bit of an oxymoron, Sugar does 
provide you with a way to view your forecast history from prior periods.
 
1. Click the Forecasts module tab from any Sugar view and then choose 
Forecast History from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Forecast History Home page opens. You’ll notice a Committed 
Forecasts subpanel.
 
2. Choose the Time Period you’d like to review from the Time Periods 
drop-down list.
 
3. Select either My Forecasts or My Team’s Forecasts and then click Search.
 
 A summary of the past forecast displays in the Committed Forecasts 
Search subpanel and shows the committed amounts, Time Period, and 
the number of opportunities for that period.
Creating Reports 101
The information that you put into a database is only as good as the informa-
tion that you can pull out of it again. Although you might not be a proponent 
of using reams of paper to print out myriad reports, you’ll probably want to 
at least view some simple information online.
The Reports module allows you to create, view, and edit reports on a variety 
of exciting topics including accounts, contacts, and opportunities.

245
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
Both the Professional and Enterprise versions come equipped with lots of 
reports. You might consider taking a peak at them before jumping in head-
first and creating more reports “from scratch.”
 
Need a new report in a hurry? You can always use an existing one, make your 
changes, and then click Save As to save the report with a different name.
It will come as no shock to you that you find the Sugar reports nestled away 
in the Reports module. Running existing reports from the Reports module is a 
great way to find out about the various report filtering and display options.
 
You might notice the Add to My Favorites button. This will allow you to select 
a report and designate it as a Favorite. You can access your favorite reports 
by choosing the My Favorite Reports shortcut from the Reports home page. 
You can also add a favorite report dashlet to your Home page for even easier 
access to the reports you run the most often. Chapter 9 shows you how to add 
items to your Home page.
The two basic types of reports are
 
✓ Rows and Columns: This is the typical report format; each column has 
a header reflecting one of your Sugar fields and the rows contain the 
corresponding data pulled from your records. For example, you might 
create a contact report with such columns as Name, Address, City, State, 
Phone, and E-mail, and then thousands of rows each containing the 
appropriate information from every one of your contacts.
 
✓ Summation: This type of report generally includes totals, such as sum, 
average, or count of the items reflected in the chart. Summation reports 
work particularly well when you’re trying to group various data into 
individual categories. Optionally, a summation report can include a 
chart.
Running a Rows and Columns report
A Rows and Columns report displays information in rows and columns with 
the columns reflecting the fields that you choose to display in the report.
Here’s how to take a look at an existing report:
 
1. Click the Reports module tab from any Sugar view.
 
 The Reports Home page opens, providing a list of the current Sugar 
reports. Notice in Figure 14-11 that the administrator created all the 
reports and assigned them to the Global team, which means that they 
are viewable by all the Sugar users.

246
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 14-11: 
The Reports 
Home page.
 
 
2. Choose the record type for which you want to create the report from 
the Module drop-down list.
 
 Because many reports come with the Reports module and, over time, 
you might add lots more, you might want to narrow your options. You 
can also narrow your options to include a specific Report Type, such as 
Rows and Columns — the type of report you’re focusing on.
 
3. Click the name of the report you want to run.
 
 Although this page is still labeled the Reports Home page, as you can 
see in Figure 14-12, it differs slightly from the real Reports Home page. 
This Home page includes three tabs that help you customize your 
report. The report information appears at the bottom of the screen.
 
4. Select your basic report options and then click the Filter tab.
 
 You have a number of options here:
 
• Report Name: It’s always a good idea to give a report a name that 
means something to you.
 
• Module: Reports are based on a primary Sugar module; if neces-
sary, you can add other related modules as well.
 
• Related: Displays a list of the related modules, which you can then 
delete or change if necessary.
 
• Show Query: Administrators can use this option to show the query 
on which the report is based.

247
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
• Assigned To: The person in charge of the report or the person you 
go to if the report doesn’t work correctly.
 
• Team: The users who are allowed to view the report.
 
• Rows and Columns or Summation: Use this option only if you want 
to change the format of the report entirely.
 
5. Select your filtering options and then click the Choose Display 
Columns tab.
 
 You then specify additional filters to narrow the data based on the mod-
ules you select. For example, if your report is based on the Contacts 
module, you can filter the report to contacts that are located in a spe-
cific state.
 
6. Choose the columns you want to display in the report.
 
 Again, you can select columns based on the modules that you included 
in your report in Step 4. Select a field name from the Module column list 
and then click the left-pointing arrow to move the field to the Display 
Columns list.
 
 If you select a field in the Display Columns list, you’ll see the column 
header that will appear on the report, which is generally way too long. 
For example, you might want to change the label Contacts: Primary 
Address Postal Code to a simpler Zip, like the example in Figure 14-13. To 
change it, delete the contents in the Label field and type the new and 
improved version.

7. Choose one of the following options when you’re finished tweaking 
your report:
 
• Run Report: Click this button to refresh the report any time you 
change any of the reports options.
 
• Save: Click this button to overwrite the previous version of the 
report.
 
 It’s never a great idea to overwrite an “out of the box” report 
unless you’re absolutely 100-percent positive that your version 
is superior to the original version. Using the Save As button is a 
much safer option.
 
• Save As: Click this button to create a copy of the report with a new 
name.
 
 Need a new report in a hurry? You can always use an existing one, 
make your changes, and then click Save As to save the report with 
a different name.
 
• Print as PDF: Click this button to print the report in PDF format.

Creating a Summation report
If you’ve ran a Rows and Columns report — and understand the various 
options — you’re well on your way to running a Summation Report. The first 
several steps are identical, but I repeat them for you just in case:
 
1. Click the Reports module tab from any Sugar view.
 
2. Choose the record type for which you want to create the report from 
the Module drop-down list.
 
3. Click the name of the report you want to run.
 
 Because you’re learning about Summation reports, your best option 
here is to pick a report that lists Summation as the report type.
 
4. Select your basic report options and then click the Filter tab.
 
 So far, so good — you’re in fairly familiar territory here. You see the 
same options that you see for the Rows and Columns report — except 
that you’ll notice that there are now five tabs to choose from: a Group 
tab appears after the Filter tab and a Chart Options tab appears on the 
end. You’ll also notice a chart at the bottom of the screen.
 
5. Select your filtering options and then click the Group tab.
 
 Again, the filtering options are identical to what you see in the Rows and 
Columns report.
 
6. Specify the data grouping on the Group tab and then click the Choose 
Display Columns tab.
 
 A nice benefit of Summation reports is that they allow you to group 
information in sections. You can add grouping information by clicking 
the Add Column button, choosing a module option from the Group By 
drop-down list, and then choosing a field from the drop-down list to the 
right of the module type. The field information will depend on the mod-
ules you select in Step 2.
 
 Figure 14-14 shows an illustration of grouping case information by 
subject and then Account name, which would prove useful if you were 
trying to determine whether several people at the same company were 
all experiencing the same problems. If you select a date field, a third 
drop-down box appears that allows you to group by day, month, quar-
ter, or year.

250
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 14-14: 
Grouping 
criteria for a 
report.
 
 
7. Indicate your display Columns and then click the Chart Options tab.
 
 Although the process for adding columns to a Summation report is the 
same as that for a Rows and Columns report, your options are slightly 
different. Because the whole idea of a Summation report is to group like 
items together, you see options like AVG and Quarter, meaning you can 
show an average of your data and/or group your data by quarter. You 
also notice a Show Details check box under the Label field, which dis-
plays the details of the report in addition to — or instead of — a chart.
 
8. Indicate your Chart Options.
 
 You have three pertinent pieces of information to add here:
 
• Chart Type: You can have a horizontal bar, vertical bar, line chart, 
pie chart, or funnel chart type, or you can choose No Chart if you 
only want the summary information to appear.
 
• Select Data Series for Chart: Choose an available grouping function, 
such as Count or AVG (average), from the drop-down list. Your 
choices will depend on the Group-By and Display Columns options 
you select in Steps 6 and 7.
 
• Chart Description: Add a short description for the chart.
 
9. Choose an option to either Run, Save, or Print the report.
 
 If you pick one of the chart options, the report displays as a chart com-
plete with a legend. To hide the legend, click the down arrow. Place your 
cursor over a segment to see more information. If you chose the Show 
Details option, the details appear directly below the chart.

You can add custom charts to your Dashboard. For more information, head to 
Chapter 9.
Scheduling reports
After you have the hang of running and customizing reports, running them 
again is simple — just head back to the Reports Home page and select a 
report. However, if you want to automate the process even further, you can 
schedule to run a report at a specific time. Sugar runs the report and e-mails 
it to you. Talk about easy!
Here’s how you can schedule e-mail delivery of your reports:
 
1. Click the Reports module tab from any Sugar view.
 
 If you’ve already scheduled a report to run automatically, you will see 
the date and time that the report is scheduled to run. For now, you want 
to create a schedule, so None will appear next to any report not sched-
uled to run automatically.
 
2. Click None in the Schedule Report column of the report you want to 
schedule.
 
 The Schedule Report dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-15.
 
Figure 14-15: 
Scheduling 
a report to 
run auto-
matically.
 
 
3. Enter the scheduling information.
 
 You need to add only a few items to create such a powerful tool:
 
• Start Date: Select a date to begin the scheduling process.
 
• Time Interval: Choose an interval to run the report; you can pick 
durations, such as daily, weekly, and every four weeks.

252
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
• Active: Select the Active check box to get the show on the road. 
If you don’t select this box, the schedule is not activated, and the 
Schedule Report column displays None.
 
• Next Email: If you’re editing an existing schedule, the date and time 
that you previously specified appear here.
 
4. Click the Update Schedule button.
 
 You end up back at the Reports Home page where the next scheduled 
date and time appear in the Schedule Report column for that report. Sit 
back, relax, and wait to receive a copy of the report when it’s scheduled 
to be delivered.
Working with Workflow
Workflow is the feature that sets apart the men from the boys. Workflow is 
the heart and soul of a true CRM product and probably the main reason you’ll 
want to upgrade to the Professional or Enterprise version. Creating a Workflow 
allows you to track milestones, send out alerts, and take the appropriate 
action. For example, you might set up a Workflow to track warranty expiration 
dates; the customer will receive automatic notifications, which will stop when 
the customer either renews his contract or decides to discontinue the service.
The different stages of a Workflow can be assigned to different users of your 
organization. For example, in the above scenario, customer service might be 
in charge of sending the renewal notices, and accounting might be in charge 
of updating the customer’s record. When one task is finished, the folks who 
are responsible for the next stage in the Workflow are notified.
A Workflow consists of five steps:
 
✓ Creating a Workflow Definition, which is the key element of the 
Workflow.
 
✓ Specifying the Workflow Conditions that trigger when the Workflow 
starts.
 
✓ Creating an alert to let your users or teams know exactly what is 
going on.
 
✓ Creating an action that you want to happen when an event triggers 
the Workflow.
 
✓ Optionally specifying the Workflow Sequence if you have several 
workflow processes that might overlap.

253
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
Although the process for creating a Workflow is a bit long and involved, 
you’ll no doubt find the time you save to be well worth the effort. Not only 
will you be automating your processes, you’ll also be assuring that nothing 
“falls through the cracks.”
Creating a Workflow Definition
The database administrator is the person who starts the Workflow process. 
Be nice to this person because he is going to be saving the rest of the people 
in the organization a lot of time! The Workflow Definition is actually a record 
in your database; and, as is the case with other records, you can relate vari-
ous elements to it after you create it.
Here’s how the administrator can get the ball rolling:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Workflow Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Create Workflow Definition from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Workflow Definitions form opens.
 
3. Fill in the Workflow Definition information.
 
 When you finish, the final product looks similar to what you see in 
Figure 14-16.
 
Figure 14-16: 
Creating a 
Workflow 
Definition.
 

254
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
 You have only a few pieces of information to fill out:
 
• Name: Enter a name for the Workflow.
 
• Execution Occurs: Indicate the event that will trigger the Workflow. 
Your choices are When Record Saved, which means when a change 
is made to a record, or After Time Elapses, which means the action 
is triggered by the passage of time.
 
• Status: Choose Active from the drop-down list to show that you 
want the Workflow to be usable. It’s a good idea to set the status 
as Inactive until you’ve fully developed the Workflow to prevent it 
from triggering prematurely.
 
• Target Module: Select the module to which the Workflow applies.
 
• Applies to: Decide whether the Workflow will apply to new, exist-
ing, or both new and existing records. For example, a thank-you 
letter might apply to all Contacts records whereas a company 
introduction letter might only be sent to new Leads records.
 
• Processing Order: Decides which comes first: an alert or an action. The 
deciding factor is whether or not you want Workflow changes to be 
included in an alert. For example, let’s say that changing the status of 
an opportunity will automatically create a task to follow up with the 
contact for that opportunity. You’ll want to let the Workflow create 
that task prior to notifying your salesperson that the task exists.
 
• Description: Enter a brief description of the Workflow so you can 
remember what the darn thing is supposed to do.
 
4. Click Save to create the workflow.
 
 Congratulations! You land in the Detail view of the Workflow Definition 
where you can move on to the next step in the operation!
What condition is your condition in?
The second stage in the Workflow process is to add conditions to the 
Workflow. You might think of this in terms of if and then; for example, if a 
new lead enters my database, then I am going to pester the heck out of him! The 
nice thing here is that you can add a variety of conditions. For example, if the 
lead becomes a contact, you might want to send a thank-you letter and add 
her to your newsletter mailing list; if you never touch base with the lead, you 
might continue to include her in your marketing campaigns.
Here’s how you can start adding a few conditions:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Workflow Home page opens.

255
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
2. Click the Workflow Definition record you want to add conditions to.
 
 The Workflow Detail view opens.
 
3. Scroll to the Conditions subpanel and then click Create.
 
 A pop-up window appears.
 
4. Select the condition that you want to use to trigger the Workflow.
 
 As you see in Figure 14-17, you have some nice options here. You might 
want something to happen when the contents of a field change — or 
when nothing changes during a given time period.
 
5. Indicate the field or module that the Workflow depends on, fill in the 
time parameter, and then click Save.
 
 The choices here vary slightly depending on the condition you pick in 
Step 4.
 
6. Click Save to save your condition.
 
 The condition now appears in the Conditions subpanel of the Workflow 
Detail view.
You can add as many conditions as you need to a Workflow. For example, 
you might want new leads in any one of six states to go to one salesperson, 
and new leads from a different set of states to go to a different salesperson.
 
Figure 14-17: 
Adding con-
ditions to a

256
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Alert! There’s an alert ahead!
You can send alerts as part of the Workflow process. For example, you might 
want to let your co-workers know that you’re going to start a marketing cam-
paign so that they can prepare for all those new orders. Or, perhaps you want 
to alert someone when a contract is about to expire, or that one of his key cus-
tomers hasn’t made a purchase in six months. The possibilities are endless!
Alerts arrive in the form of an e-mail. An alert can be based on a template, or 
you can create your own unique message in the body of the alert. You also 
create a recipient list of the people who will receive the alert.
Creating an Alert Template
If you think your alert will take the form of a template, then you’ll want to 
create the template prior to creating the alert. This prevents you from having 
to edit the alert to add the template to it.
The nice thing about Alert Templates is that they can be recycled and used 
in multiple Workflows. For example, you might have a variety of Workflows 
directed at specific users when their customer information changes. 
However, you can use the same Alert Template for each of these Workflows.
Follow these steps to create an Alert Template:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 Because Alert Templates are a part of the overall Workflow process, it’s 
only natural that you return to the Workflow Home page to create one.
 
2. Choose Alert Email Templates from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Alerts Template page opens.
 
3. Choose a module from the drop-down list and click Create.
 
 The idea here is to tie the alert to the Workflow. If your Workflow 
revolves around new leads, select Leads as the module. If your Workflow 
involves contacting customers who haven’t purchased from you in a 
while, select Contacts or Accounts.
 
4. Fill in the basic information on the Alert Templates page.
 
 Keep in mind that you’re creating an e-mail message here so, as shown 
in Figure 14-18, the form looks somewhat like an e-mail message.
 
 The information you enter includes:
 
• Name: Enter a name for the template.
 
• Description: Enter a brief description of the template.
 
• Subject: Enter the subject of the e-mail.

257
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
Figure 14-18: 
Creating an 
e-mail Alert 
Template.
 
 
5. Enter the body of the e-mail message.
 
 The body of the e-mail message works like any other e-mail. You can for-
mat your text and write pretty much whatever you want. However, there’s 
a neat trick here. If your alert depends on a change to a specific field, you 
can let the recipient of the alert know exactly what’s changed. For exam-
ple, you can choose a specific field from the Target module drop-down 
list, choose Old Value from the bottom drop-down list, and then click 
Insert so that the recipient knows exactly what information has changed. 
You can also choose New Value to see what the field has changed to.
 
6. Click Save to save the template.
Creating an alert
By now, your Workflow is really starting to take shape. You’ve even created a 
template that will automatically go to the users you need to notify of a Workflow-
related event. You only have a few steps left, and fortunately, they’re easy ones.
Now, you’re going to set up the actual Alert process, which is easy if you 
follow these instructions:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Workflow Home page opens.
 
2. Select the Workflow that you’ve been busily creating, scroll to the 
Alerts subpanel, and click Create.
 
 The Alerts page opens, as shown in Figure 14-19.

258
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 14-19: 
Creating an 
alert.
 
 
3. Fill in the alert information.
 
 I told you this was easy; there are only a handful of fields:
 
• Name: Enter a name for the alert. You might choose a name that 
corresponds to the name of the Workflow to avoid confusion.
 
• Alert Type: You can send the alert in the form of an e-mail or an 
invitation.
 
• Source Type: You have two options here. If you choose Normal 
Message, an Alert Text box will appear for you to type in the mes-
sage. If you select Custom Template, the Custom Template field 
will appear, and you can choose a custom template from the drop-
down list.
 
• Custom Template: This field displays existing Alert Templates if you 
select Custom Template as the source type. Choose the template 
from the drop-down list.
 
4. Click Save to save the alert.
 
 Your alert appears in the Alerts subpanel of your Workflow; look closely, 
and you’ll notice a cute Recipients icon. Stay tuned — you’ll be clicking 
that icon in a minute.
Sending an alert to those that need ’em
At this point, you might feel like you’re working on a giant jigsaw puzzle. 
Fortunately, you only have a few more pieces to add. The Alert Recipient List 
allows you to determine who is supposed to get the alert — an important 
part of the entire Workflow process.
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.

259
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
 
 The Workflow Home page opens. If you just added an alert, you were 
already in the Workflow Detail view. However, it’s always a good idea to 
start from the top to make sure that no one gets lost along the way.
 
2. Select the Workflow that you’ve been busily creating, scroll to the 
Alerts subpanel, and click the Recipients link.
 
 The Alerts Detail view opens. Notice that it includes an Alert Recipient 
List subpanel.
 
3. Click Create.
 
 A pop-up window opens.
 
4. Select the option for the user(s) who are to receive the alert.
 
 Sugar creates hyperlinks depending on your selection. For example, if 
you want to send the alert to a team of users, Sugar will furnish the mes-
sage you see along the bottom of Figure 14-20. Click the hyperlink to 
select the users, teams, or recipients of the alert.
 
5. Click Save to save the recipients list.
 
 The selected users appear in the Alert Recipient List subpanel.

Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Actions speak louder than words
You’re now ready to put the last piece into the Workflow puzzle. You can 
schedule actions to occur automatically when the Workflow is triggered. For 
example, you might set up a Workflow to notify a sales rep when a new lead 
in his territory is added to the Sugar database. Then, when the Workflow 
starts, you can have Sugar automatically change the lead’s status. Cooler yet, 
you can add multiple actions to a Workflow. For example, you might have 
Sugar create a new opportunity for the lead and add the lead to your newslet-
ter recipients.
Here’s how you can set up those actions.
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Workflow Home page opens.
 
2. Select the Workflow that you’ve been working on, scroll down to the 
Actions subpanel, and click Create.
 
 A pop-up window appears.
 
3. Select as many actions as you want and then click Next.
 
• Update fields in the Targets module: Change information in the 
Target record.
 
• Update fields in a related record: This updates information on one 
of the subpanels. For example, if you’re working with the Leads 
module, you might want to add a note to the record.
 
• Create a record associated with a module related to the Targets 
module: Create an entirely new record.
 
4. Fill in your response and then click Save to save the action.
 
 As shown in Figure 14-21, here’s where you hone the information you 
indicate in Step 3. For example, if you opt to update fields in the Targets 
module, here’s where you supply the fields you want to update and pro-
vide a value for those fields.
 
5. Click Save to create the action.
 
 You land on the Workflow Detail view where you can view the Workflow 
in its entirety, as shown in Figure 14-22.

Two optional but useful Workflow steps
At last! You’ve come to the end step of the Workflow process. You should be 
proud of yourself — you definitely deserve a well-earned pat on the back. At 
this point, the Workflow is finished, although you might still want to tweak 
it a bit. You can go back and edit any part you want by following all of the 
above directions, looking for the pencil/Edit icon as you go.
Although you’re finished with the actual process of creating a Workflow, you 
might want to add two optional — albeit important — steps to your Workflow 
checklist.
Specifying the Workflow Sequence
If you create more than one Workflow for the same module, you might run 
into a conflict down the road. For example, suppose you have one Workflow 
process that includes sending a welcoming e-mail to new leads and another 
process that sends out a thank you to any leads that place an order. The lead 
might be confused if he receives that thank-you letter prior to buying anything.
You can arrange the order of related Workflow items to ensure that your 
Workflows don’t conflict with one another and run in an orderly fashion. To 
do so, simply follow these steps:
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Workflow 
Management in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Workflow Home page opens.
 
2. Choose Workflow Sequence from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Workflow Sequence page opens.
 
3. Select the module that contains the conflicting workflows and then 
click Select.
 
 To make life easy, Sugar only gives you a choice of the modules that con-
tain Workflows.
 
4. Arrange the order of the Workflows on the Workflow Sequence page.
 
 As Figure 14-23 illustrates, you can rearrange the order of the pro-
cesses by selecting the up and down arrows next to each process. Your 
changes will save automatically.
Testing the Workflow
With so many steps involved in the process of creating a Workflow, it’s only 
natural that you might get lost along the way. You might want to think of 
yourself as a rocket scientist — you’d be very disappointed if nothing hap-
pened when you yelled, “Blast-off!”

263
 Chapter 14: Sweetening the Deal
Again, Sugar has your back. Testing the Workflow prior to implementation 
will allow you to rest comfortably, knowing that all your Ts are crossed and 
your Is are dotted. Plus, you won’t have to hide the next time the boss comes 
roaring around the corner.
 
If you had set the Workflow status to Inactive while creating the Workflow, 
you’ll need to change it to Active prior to testing the Workflow.
You test the Workflow by actually recreating the process. This includes 
adding or making changes to the Workflow that correspond to the conditions 
you created for the Workflow, making sure that the appropriate alerts are 
sent and the specified actions are taken.
 
1. Click Admin from any Sugar view and then choose Email Settings in 
the Email subpanel.
 
 Verify that all your basic e-mail settings are correct.
 
2. Make sure that there is a check mark in the Notifications On? check box.
 
3. Log in to Sugar as a different user and click My Account.
 
 Verify that your e-mail settings are correct.
 
4. Access the module around which the Workflow is built and create or 
edit a record.
 
 For example, if you want to test that you’ll receive a notification every 
time a new lead from Florida is created, then create a new lead who just 
happens to be located in Florida.
 
 You should now receive an e-mail informing you that a new lead was just 
created, at which point you can let out a loud whoop and dance around 
the office. If not, it’s back to the drawing board.

isn’t addressed by the existing Sugar modules, I show you how to add one.
Creating Your Own Unique Database
For many of you, the modules and their fields that come with Sugar are more 
than enough to run your business. If that’s the case, feel free to skip this 
chapter. However, many of you like to do things in your own unique fashion. 
Fortunately for you, Sugar includes the ability to make changes to modules, 
fields, drop-down lists, and even layouts directly from within the Sugar pro-
gram. And, by doing so, you can create a customized solution for your busi-
ness that would probably cost you tens of thousands of dollars if you were to 
hire an outside programmer to create the whole thing “from scratch.”
 
To make structural changes, you must be a database administrator; the 
makers of Sugar made this a requirement so that you understand the impor-
tance of this responsibility. So, unless you have those rights to the database, 
you don’t even have to read this chapter! I suppose you still could just for 
curiosity’s sake, but it isn’t necessary.

266
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Sugar is Open Source software, which means that you have access to the entire 
source code. Therefore, if you have a good, working knowledge of PHP, you 
can change any aspects of Sugar. This chapter focuses on the areas you can 
change by using the Developer Tools you find in Sugar; however, feel free to 
explore other changes that are beyond the scope of this book.
Doing your homework
I am a firm believer that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Although 
making structural changes to your Sugar database isn’t hard, it is something 
that should be well thought out and planned. This is particularly true if you 
plan to share your database with other users. Planning is important because 
you usually have a goal in mind for your database. For example, if your goal 
is to create a report with three columns — contact name, birthday, and 
Social Security number — you need to make sure all those fields exist in your 
database. Planning also prevents you from adding thousands of contacts to 
your database, only to find that you have to modify each record to include 
information that was omitted the first time around!
Okay, I admit it — I’m a former secondary school teacher, and I guess that 
background just naturally spills over into my Sugar consulting. Well, class, 
pretend you’re back in school because you’re going to be assigned some 
homework. I consider it important homework that you must complete prior 
to jumping in and making major changes to the structure of your database, so 
your assignment is as follows:
 
1. Jot down all the fields that you want to add to your database.
 
 Most of the fields you want to see, such as company, name, phone 
number, and address, are already included in Sugar. What you need to 
decide here is what fields, if any, are specific to your business.
 
 Dust off your thinking cap while you create your list. Sometimes one 
field will do the job, and other times you might need multiple fields. For 
example, suppose you sell widgets that are red, white, or blue. In one 
scenario, a customer needs to buy only one widget; in this case, you 
create a product field with three choices in the drop-down list — red, 
white, or blue. Or, perhaps you manufacture a different kind of widget; in 
this case, a customer would hopefully buy one of each color. This time, 
your purposes would be better served by creating three fields — one for 
each type of widget.
 
2. Scurry around the office and collect any documents that you want 
Sugar to create for you. This includes both forms and form letters.
 
 You have to get a little high-tech here, but I think you can handle it. Get 
out your trusty highlighter and highlight any of the information in each 
document that is contact specific. For example, each contact has its own 

267
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
unique address. Maybe you’re thanking particular contacts for purchas-
ing widgets (as opposed to gadgets, which you also sell). This means 
that you need a Product field.
 
3. Think how to populate the fields with drop-down lists. Then, on the 
list that you start in Step 1, jot them down to the side of each of the 
fields.
 
 For example, if you run a modeling agency, you might need a field for 
hair color. The drop-down choices could contain red, blonde, black, and 
punk pink.
 
4. Visualize where you’d like your new fields to appear.
 
 Adding a field is half the fun. The other half comes from deciding where 
you want that new field to appear.
 
5. Sketch out any reports that you want to create from Sugar and add the 
column headings to the now rather long list that you created in Step 1.
 
 The idea here is to get your thoughts down on paper so that you can 
visualize how you want your reports to look. If you already have a 
sample of your report in Excel, you can use that. If not, get out your 
trusty pencil and outline on a piece of paper what you want your report 
to actually look like.
 
6. Identify your pain points.
 
 We’re not talking about a stubbed toe here. Rather, think about areas of 
your business that Sugar could help you manage. Maybe you’re a travel 
agent and would love to add a module that lists itineraries. Or, perhaps 
you’re selling yachts and need a place to track the specs on each vessel. 
Put Sugar to use to help manage any or all data.
 
7. Jot down even your smallest wish.
 
 You may as well take advantage of Sugar’s customization capabili-
ties. For example, you might deal only with hospitals and would like to 
rename the Accounts module the Hospital module.
 
8. Get out a red pen. At the top of your paper, write 100%, Well Done, 
and then draw a smiley face. Hang your list on your refrigerator.
 
 Okay, that last step isn’t really necessary, but now you’re well on your 
way to having the database of your dreams!
Knowing your Developer Tools
After you’ve done your homework, you’re probably chomping at the bit to 
jump in and start creating. Although I admire your enthusiasm this might be 
a great time to take a quick peek at the design tools that you’ll be using.

268
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
The tools are easy to access — just click the Admin link on the Home page 
and scroll to the Developer Tools subpanel. Figure 15-1 shows you what 
you’re getting in to.
 
Figure 15-1: 
The 
Developer 
Tools 
subpanel.
 
Although the elements are logical, it doesn’t hurt to take a fast tour:
 
✓ Studio: You might think of the Studio as a playground for nerdy grown-
ups; this is where you can add fields, change a label, rearrange your lay-
outs, and edit a subpanel on your existing modules.
 
✓ Module Builder: Like a fancy set of building blocks, here’s where you 
can build new modules to customize Sugar exactly to your liking.
 
✓ Configure Tabs: If you’re overwhelmed by the number of tabs that dis-
play across the top of Sugar, here’s the place to remove the ones you 
aren’t using.
 
✓ Configure Group Tabs: You might want to swap the module format for a 
menu-based system grouping.
 
✓ Portal: Select this option to add tabs to other Web sites.
 
✓ Module Loader: Use this option to load Sugar modules, themes, and lan-
guage packs that you’ve purchased or downloaded.
 
✓ Dropdown Editor: Click this option to add and edit the contents of your 
drop-down lists.
 
✓ Rename Tabs: Select this option to rename a module tab.
Stepping into the Studio
You might think of the Studio as the heart and soul of your design efforts. This 
is where you change the data that is displayed — and determine how that data 
can be viewed — for the basic Sugar modules as well as any modules that you 
might have created. Figure 15-2 shows the Sugar Studio Home page.
 
Need a little more room to spread out? Click a double left arrow to close a sec-
tion that you’re not using, such as the Help or Shortcuts menu section. Want 
to get them back? Click the double right arrows.

Figure 15-2:

Studio 
Home page.
 
The Studio Home page lists all the existing modules in the left panel. The 
middle panel displays the exact same information in the form of icons. If you 
like working from a list, click the plus sign (+) to expand the module to show 
the Labels, Fields, Layouts, and Subpanels associated with the module. If you 
prefer icons, clicking them will reveal the view you see in Figure 15-3.

You’ll also notice that the right panel offers you helpful hints; these hints will 
change to reflect the area of the Studio you’re in. And, should you get lost 
wandering around the Studio, the buttons that run along the bottom of the 
page will get you back on track.
Adding a field to the database
Before getting started, I want to outline briefly the three steps involved with 
adding fields to a database:
 
1. Understand why you want to add fields and what purpose these fields 
will serve. And, if you did your homework earlier in this chapter, you’re 
already done!
 
2. Determine what fields you’re going to add and what type of data will be 
stored in them (dates, numbers, drop-down items, and so on). If you’re 
creating a drop-down list, decide on the drop-down items.
 
3. Add the fields to your layouts and subpanels.
For most of you, adding a field to your database will be easy. After all, you’re 
good at following directions. However, for some of you, knowing why to enter 
a field can prove to be more challenging.
To explore the question of why, I first want to reiterate the basic concept 
of fields. What the heck is a field? A field is a single piece of information. In 
general, a field contains just one piece of information. For example, you have 
only one business zip code; therefore, you have one business Zip Code field. 
Alternatively, you probably have several phone numbers: home, business, 
toll-free, cellular, fax, beeper . . . and the list goes on. Each of these phone 
numbers requires a separate field.
A good field holds one fairly specific piece of information. A bad field contains 
too much information. For example, having a separate field for your street 
address, city, state, and zip code is a good thing. These separate fields allow 
you to perform a lookup based on any of the criteria: You could find clients 
by zip code, city, or state. An example of creating a bad field is lumping all the 
address information into a single field; in this example, you’d then lose your 
ability to search by zip code, city, or state. (Need a refresher on searching? 
Head to Chapter 9.)
You can add custom fields to any module in Sugar. The actual addition of 
fields is relatively easy; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio in the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.

271
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
2. Expand the module that you want to edit from the Modules panel and 
then click Fields.
 
 The Edit Fields panel opens, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
3. Click the Add Field button.
 
 The Field Editor panel (shown in Figure 15-5) opens on the right side of 
the screen, replacing the Help panel. If you still need a bit of help, click 
the Help tab.
 
 If you’re attempting to create a new field that is identical to an existing 
field, click the name of the existing field in the Edit Fields panel and then 
click the Clone button on the Field Editor. Make any necessary changes 
and then click the Save button.
 
4. Choose one of the data types from the drop-down list.
 
• Text Field: This is probably the most common of the field type 
choices; a character field can contain both numbers and characters.
 
• Address: Talk about a timesaver! When you designate a field as 
an address field, Sugar automatically creates five fields: street 
address, city, state, zip code, and country.
 
• Checkbox: Creates a check box field.
 
• Currency: This field comes equipped with a dollar sign, appropriate 
commas, optional decimal places, and a sunroof (optional).
 
Figure 15-4: 
Making field 
changes.
 

272
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 15-5: 
Creating a 
new field.
 
 
• Date: When the time comes for you to enter information into a Date 
field, you see a tiny little calendar that enables you to select a date. 
The calendar supplies a useful purpose. If you create a field for a 
birthday and make it a character field, the other local yokels using 
the database might get creative and input anything from Jan 1 and 
January 1st to 01/01 and 1/1. Finding all birth dates in the month of 
January would become an exercise in futility.
 
• Dropdown: When you choose this data type, you pick an existing 
drop-down list to associate with the field or create a new one. I 
cover creating drop-down lists in the upcoming “Creating a drop-
down list” section.
 
• Decimal: This field accepts only numbers, a decimal point, and 
more numbers.
 
• Integer: This will create a field specifying positive or negative num-
bers. You can specify a range with the Min and Max value fields. 
This option enables you to enter only numbers into a field. Say you 
want to find all your customers that have more than 30 employees. 
You can easily search for a number greater than 30, whereas you 
can’t possibly search for a number greater than thirty.
 
• MultiSelect: This is a special type of drop-down list field that allows 
you to select multiple items from the drop-down list.
 
 You cannot create a MultiSelect field in the Module Builder.
 
• Flex Relate: This is kind of a wild card field; with a Flex Relate 
field, you can choose a record type from a drop-down list, select a 
record, and then link that record to the current record.
 
 You can add only one Flex Relate field to a module.
 
• Phone: If you designate a field to be a Phone field, you automati-
cally get a year’s supply of dashes.
 
• Radio: Creates a radio button, which will allow you to pick only 
one of the drop-down list options.

273
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
• Relate: Creates a field to associate a record with another record. 
You can add multiple Relate fields to a module.
 
• TextArea: Where you can store a large amount of information you 
don’t want to bury among your other notes. For example, you 
might want to include your driving directions in this area.
 
• Link: Use this field type if you need to associate another Web 
address with your record.
 
5. Specify a Field Name. Enter a name for the field.
 
 The field name can’t include any spaces so use a name like FieldName or 
Field_Name rather than Field Name.
 
6. Add the remaining field properties.
 
 The remainder of these fields is optional but it’s always nice to know 
what they mean just in case you decide to use them:
 
• Display Label: The label you will see to help you identify the field.
 
• System Label: This is the official “system” name for the field label.
 
• Help Text: Like a little set of training wheels, this information will 
appear when a user places their cursor over a field.
 
• Default Value: Add a default value for the field. For example, if you 
sell most of your products in the state of confusion, add confusion 
as the default value for the state field.
 
• Max Size: Enter the maximum number of characters that the field 
can have.
 
• Required Field: Select this check box to ensure that the users will 
enter information into this field.
 
• Audit: Select this check box if you want changes to this field to 
appear in the Audit Log for a record.
 
• Duplicate Merge: Select an option from the drop-down list to indi-
cate whether you want to use the field as a way of finding duplicate 
records.
 
7. (Optional) Fill in any remaining field values.
 
 Some fields appear depending on the value you use in the Data Type 
field. For example, a Decimal field will ask for a Precision (number of 
decimal places) and an Integer field will ask for a minimum and maxi-
mum value.
 
8. Click Save to create the field.
 
 The new fields are listed above the core fields in the Edit Fields panel. 
Notice that a tiny “c” was added to the end of each one indicating that it 
is a custom field.

274
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Deleting a field
 
If you delete a field from a database, all data in that field is deleted. Forever. 
Permanently. Delete a field only if you’re sure that you no longer need that 
data. 
The core fields that come with Sugar are so important that Sugar won’t allow 
you to delete them. As an alternative, you can delete those fields from your 
layout so that they can’t be accessed.
Ironically, the monumental task of deleting a field is ridiculously easy to ful-
fill. To do so, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio from the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.
 
2. Expand the module that contains the field you want to delete, and 
then click Fields.
 
 The Edit Fields panel opens.
 
3. Select the field you want to delete.
 
 I don’t think I need to mention how important it is that you click the field 
you want to delete and not one you mean to keep.
  
 You can only delete customized fields; you can identify them by the “c” 
that appears after their names.
 
4. Click the Delete button in the Properties panel to delete the field.
 
 Click OK to confirm the deletion, as shown in Figure 15-6.
 
5. Click OK to the warning prompt.
 
 That’s all, folks. If you’re waiting for a second reminder to ask whether 
you’re really, positively, 100 percent sure that you want to delete the field, 
you’ll be waiting for a very long time because it’s not going to happen. Any 
information associated with the field will be gone permanently.

 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
Editing fields
After you create a field, you might find that you need to tweak it later on down 
the road. Unlike many programs that are very difficult — if not impossible — to 
edit, you can edit your newly created, customized fields to your heart’s content. 
However, the only part of a core field that you can edit is the label.
To edit a field:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio in the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.
 
2. Expand the module that contains the field you want to edit and then 
click Fields.
 
 The Edit Fields panel opens.
 
3. Select the field you want to change.
 
4. Click Save to save your changes.
 
The only portion of a core field that you can change is its label.
What you see is what you get
Arranging fields the way you want them might sound like a no-brainer, but 
many SugarCRM users never realize the importance of changing the field 
locations in the various Sugar views. For example, after you add more fields 
you might end up with the main business phone number on the top portion 
of your layout, the toll-free number somewhere in the middle, and the direct-
line phone number in a third location. If you’re constantly scrolling through 
your layout to find phone numbers, you’ll want to move them together into 
one strategic place on your layout. This organization might not make your 
layout look better, but you’ll certainly work better! The point is to design 
your layout in such a way that data input becomes easy.
You can edit where a field appears — or doesn’t appear. In addition, you can 
change the order in which the fields appear. You can make those changes to 
a number of locations throughout Sugar:
 
✓ Layouts: You can edit the Edit, Detail, and List views of any record type. 
In addition, you can edit the QuickCreate menus.
  
 The Detail layout is what you see when you view a specific record; the 
Edit layout is what you get when you edit a record. Although you can 
modify those layouts to be very different from one another it would 
prove to be very confusing.

276
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
✓ Search pages: You can change the search fields in both the Basic Search 
and Advanced Search windows.
 
✓ Subpanels: You can add your new fields to a subpanel. For example, if 
you add an Account Number field to the Accounts module, you might 
want to see it on the Accounts subpanel for all the associated Contacts 
records.
The good news here is that it’s very easy to add and remove fields from any 
page. The bad news is because there are so many places to customize, it’s 
easy to add a field and then forget to make it visible throughout the various 
areas of Sugar.
As an example, say you add a toll-free phone number to the Contacts module. 
At the very least, you’ll need to add that field to the Edit view (so you can 
add the number) and to the Detail view (so that you can see it). You might 
even decide to include it in the QuickCreate menu and on the Advanced 
Search window if you might want to find a contact by his phone number. As if 
that weren’t enough choices, you might include the number on the Contacts 
subpanel of the Accounts and Leads module. Whew! You have your work cut 
out for you.
Changing the List view is a drag
The technique for adding fields and editing their position differs slightly 
between the various views. Here’s how you can edit the various list-type 
views including the List view, Basic and Advanced Search pages, and the 
subpanels.
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio in the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.
 
2. Expand the module for which you want to change the view, expand 
the Layouts section, and then click the List view you want to edit.
 
 If you’ve been following along at home, the Edit Layout page opens. 
Figure 15-7 shows you an example of the page you see when editing the 
ListView.
  
 You might want to close the Help panel on the right side of the screen to 
free up a bit more space to see the Studio fields.
 
 The Edit Layout panel consists of three columns if you’re editing the 
ListView:

277
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
• Default: Contains the fields that are displayed in a List view by 
default.
 
• Available: Contains fields that the users can choose to create a 
custom List view.
 
• Hidden: Contains fields that the users won’t be able to see until the 
administrator makes them available.
 
 If you’re editing Search windows or subpanels, you only see the Default 
and Hidden columns.
 
3. Make your changes by dragging fields to the desired location.
 
 You can move fields around to get just the look you’re looking for. For 
example, you might want to add a new field to the QuickCreate menu 
and remove an existing one.
 
• To add a field: Select and drag the field from the Available or 
Hidden column and drop it into the Default column.
 
• To remove a field: Select and drag the field from the Default column 
to the Available column.
 
• To hide a field from users: Select and drag the field from the Default 
or Available column to the Hidden column.
 
4. Click the Save & Deploy button to save your changes.

Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Changing the page views
When you modify the Edit view or Detail view, things look a bit different. 
Studio shows the separate sections of the layout and the fields they contain. 
You can edit, create, rename, and/or move the sections. Talk about having 
things just the way you like them!
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio in the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.
 
2. Expand the module for which you want to change the view, expand 
the Layouts section, and then click the DetailView or ListView.
 
 The Edit Layout page opens, as shown in Figure 15-8. Notice that it 
comes equipped with a Toolbox.
 
3. Make your editing changes.
 
 Notice the pencil icon in the top-right corner of each field; to drag a 
field, you need to place your mouse pointer directly on that icon.
 
• Remove an existing field: Select the field and drag it to the Recycle 
bin. The field will appear in the list of fields under the Recycle bin 
where you can retrieve it at any time.
 
• Replace a field: Select the field from the list of available fields 
under the Recycle bin, drag it to the new location, and drop it on 
the field that you want to replace.
 
• To add a field: Drag the New Row icon from under the Recycle bin 
and drop it on the layout where you want it to appear. The field 
will display (filler). You can then replace the filler field with an 
available field. 
 
• To move a field: Drag the field to the desired location on the 
layout.
 
• To expand the width of a field: Drag the field next to it to the 
Recycle bin.
 
• To decrease the width of an expanded field: Click the minus sign on 
the left corner of an expanded field; the field will contract and a 
filler field will be left in the open space.
 
4. (Optional) Click a field’s pencil icon and then replace the existing 
field name with a new field name in the dialog box that opens.
 
 In most cases, the field name and the field label are exactly the same. 
Having a field label differ too radically from the name of the actual field 
proves to be quite confusing when you wander into the area of template 
and report creation. However, sometimes you might want to tweak the 
field label so that it fits your layout better. For example, a field named 
Cellular Telephone Number might be shortened to a more readable Cell.

5. (Optional) Drag the New Panel icon to the layout to create a new 
panel.
 
 You can then create a label for the panel by clicking its pencil icon and 
giving it a name. Once created, you can start adding fields to it.
 
6. (Optional) Drag a panel to a new location on the layout to move it.
 
 You can drag a panel — and all the fields it contains — to a new location 
on your layout.
 
7. Select a save option when you’re finished editing the layout. 
 
• Save: Allows you to save your changes without making them vis-
ible to your users.
 
• Save & Deploy: Displays the updated view to the Sugar users.
Working with Drop-down Lists
The sure-fire way to destroy a database is by adding information in an incon-
sistent manner. Drop-down lists help ensure that users input data in a uni-
form way. As an added bonus, drop-down lists also save you time: When you 
type the first several letters of an item in your drop-down list, Sugar responds 
by completing the word for you.
As the administrator, you can create and edit values in all of the existing drop-
down fields. Better yet, you can create new drop-down lists for Dropdown and 
MultiSelect field types.

280
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
Creating a drop-down list requires two steps:
 
✓ Building a drop-down list.
 
✓ Specifying that the field is to contain a drop-down list.
Creating a drop-down list
Although you can start by creating a field first, it’s probably better to start by 
creating the drop-down list. It will save you from having to edit a new field to 
associate it with a drop-down list.
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Dropdown Editor 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Dropdown Editor panel opens, as shown in Figure 15-9.
 
2. Click the name of the drop-down list you want to edit or click the Add 
Dropdown button.
 
 Because the names of the drop-down lists are a bit confusing, selecting 
an existing drop-down list can be a bit tricky and may take you a few 
tries before you select the correct one. In any event, the panel shown in 
Figure 15-10 opens.
 
3. Give the drop-down list a name in the Name field.
 
 To make life easier for you, provide a name that coincides with the field 
that is going to use the drop-down list.

4. Add the first drop-down item in the Item Name field and add its label 
to the Display Label field.
 
 Generally, the Item Name and the Display Label are the same.
 
5. Click the Add button.
 
 Your new drop-down value appears at the bottom of the Dropdown 
Editor.
 
6. Continue adding new drop-down values by repeating Steps 4 and 5.
 
7. Click Save to save the drop-down list.
 
 The new drop-down list displays under the module name in the center 
panel.
Adding the drop-down list to a field
This might seem like a case of “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” In 
the preceding section, I tell you how to create a drop-down list. Typically, 
your next step is to create a field and associate the drop-down list with it. In 
other cases, you might create a field, create the drop-down list, and then edit 
the field to associate the drop-down list with the field.
Here’s what you need to do to edit an existing field and associate it with a 
drop-down list:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Studio in the 
Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Sugar Studio opens.

282
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
2. Expand the module that contains the field you want to add the drop-
down list to and then click the name of the field.
 
 The Field Editor panel opens.
  
 You can only add drop-down lists to Dropdown and MultiSelect field 
types.
 
3. Choose the name of the drop-down list from the Dropdown List drop 
down menu.
 
 Whew! You might want to reread that sentence a few times. Basically, 
Sugar provides you with a list containing all your drop-downs. And, if 
the name of the drop-down list matches the name of your field, Sugar 
cleverly makes the association for you automatically.
 
4. Click Save to save the changes to the field.
Manufacturing a Module
Just as you can add fields to your database, you can also add modules. Using 
modules is a great way to organize the information in your database. Once 
created, a module can appear as a subpanel on other records.
There are a number of great scenarios for creating a custom module. For 
example, you might create a Products module that lists the various products 
you’re tracking that includes the serial number and a link to the Accounts 
or Contacts record(s) that purchased that specific product. Or, if most of 
your business comes from specific individuals, you might create a Referrals 
module and then link the referral source to each Accounts record that they 
send you.
 
Before you begin to reinvent the wheel, you might want to check out 
SugarForge (www.sugarforge.org) and SugarExchange (www.sugar
exchange.com) where you can either download lots of modules for a slight 
fee or free.
Packing up a package
The first step to creating a new module is to create a package. In Sugar, a 
package holds your custom module(s). Although a package can contain mod-
ules that are unrelated to each other, generally you create a package for a 
project you’re working on.
After you create a package, you can begin creating modules for it, or you can 
return to the Module Builder later to finish the project.

283
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
The process of creating a Package is a very easy one:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Module Builder 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 Module Builder opens. If this is your first foray into the Module Builder, 
there won’t be much to see except a rather large icon that reads New 
Package.
 
2. Click the New Package icon.
 
 Module Builder’s Package panel changes to allow you to enter informa-
tion about the new module.
 
3. Enter the basic module information.
 
 As you can see in Figure 15-11, there’s not much information that you 
need to enter: 
 
• Package Name: Give the package a name.
 
• Author: You may as well get credit for your work.
 
• Key: Enter an alphanumeric key to help Sugar with its housekeeping, 
as Sugar will append this key to various directories and tables. In 
general, it’s a good idea to keep the key name as short as possible — 
but long enough so that you can still identify it.
 
• Description: Enter a description of the package.
 
• Readme: If there’s something else about the module that you want 
other users to know, feel free to give them some reading material.
 
4. Click Save to create the module package.
 
 The Package page refreshes and displays a couple of new options. You’re 
now free to roam around the cabin — or start to build your module.
Making a module
After you create a package, you’re ready to fill it with a module — or two or 
three. And of course, you’ll want to edit the module — which you already 
know how to do if you read the section, “Stepping into the Studio,” earlier in 
this chapter.
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Module Builder 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 Alternatively, if you just finished creating a package, you can start by 
clicking the New Module icon that appears when you save a package.
 
2. Click the name of your package and then click the New Module icon.
 
 The Module page opens, as shown in Figure 15-12.

284
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
3. Fill in the basic module information:
 
• Name: Enter a name for the module.
 
• Label: Enter the name that the users will use to identify the module.
 
• Navigation Tab: Select this option if you want to create a tab for 
the module on the Module bar.

a new 
package in 
Sugar.
 
 
Figure 15-12: 
Adding a 
module to a 
package.
 

285
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
4. Select the type of module you want to create by selecting its icon.
 
 Each module template contains a set of fields; picking the right module 
type now will save you from having to add a bunch of fields later.
 
• Basic: Creates the basic fields used in most modules, such as 
Name, Assigned to, Team, Date Created, and Description.
 
• Company: Provides such fields as Company Name, Industry, and 
Billing Address. Think of this as the Accounts module clone.
 
• Issue: This Cases and Bug Tracker clone includes such fields as 
Number, Status, Priority, and Description. 
 
• Person: Gives you basic contact fields, such as Name, Title, 
Address, and Phone Number.
  
 Choosing a module type is just a starting point. After you create a 
module, you can edit any of the field labels or create new custom fields.
 
5. Click Save to save the module.
 
 The Packages page refreshes and shows you a hierarchy in the Packages 
panel on the left side of the page. This hierarchy should give you a feel-
ing of déjà vu because it’s the same type of hierarchy that appears in the 
Studio.
 
6. Expand the name of your project from the Packages panel and then 
expand the name of your module.
 
7. Click an element to start editing the module.
 
 You’ll probably want to start by looking at the fields that Sugar created for 
you and tweaking them. You can then move on to your layouts and cus-
tomize the ListView, EditView, DetailView, and Search fields if needed.
 
You can’t delete any of the default fields that come with a module but you can 
hide them from within the Layouts pages.
Building a relationship
Like a family tree, a Sugar module can have multiple relationships with other 
modules. For example, the Accounts module is related to the Contacts, 
Leads, and Opportunities modules. After you establish a relationship 
between modules, the related modules will appear as subpanels in a record’s 
Detail view. In the example of the Accounts module, the Contacts, Leads, and 
Opportunities subpanels are in an Accounts record’s Detail view because 
they are related to the Accounts module.
When you create a module, you need to specify its relationship to other 
modules. A Sugar module can have multiple relationships with other Sugar 
modules. You can also specify the modules in which you want to display the 
custom module as a subpanel.

286
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Module Builder 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
2. Click the name of the package and then click the name of the module 
that you want to relate to another module.
 
 The Module’s page opens.
 
3. Click the View Relationships button.
 
 Any existing relationships display on the page.
 
4. Click Add Relationship to create a relationship.
 
 The relationship fields display in the Properties tab in the right panel. 
You might take a look at Figure 15-13 just to make sure you’re on the 
right track.
 
5. Add the following information about the relationship:
 
• Relate To: Choose the module that you want to associate with your 
new module from the drop-down list.
 
• Label: Enter a name for the relationship.
 
• Subpanel: Choose Default from the drop-down list if you want to 
display the associated module as a subpanel on the Detail view of 
the custom module.
 
• Record Subpanel: Choose Default from the second drop-down list if 
you want to display the custom module as a subpanel on the Detail 
view of the related module.

Creating a 
relationship.
 

287
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
6. Click Save to create the relationship.
 
 The new relationship displays under the Add Relationship button in the 
middle panel.
Deploying the module
Neither Rome — nor a Sugar module — is built in a day. Now, maybe you see 
why it’s so important to plan your Sugar implementation before you dive off 
the customization deep-end.
Knowing that it can often take several days — or even a month — to create 
a new module from start to finish, Sugar offers you a “create now, use later” 
scenario. Here’s how you can get that module to your users:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Module Builder 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 Alternatively, if you just finished creating a package, you can start by 
clicking the New Module icon that appears when you save a package.
 
2. Click the name of your package and then click the name of your 
module.
 
 Sugar offers you three options for getting your newly created module 
into the hands of your end-user:
 
• Publish: Use this option when you only want to give the module to 
specific users. Sugar creates a zip file, and then the users upload it 
by using the Module Loader. Further customization can be done by 
using the Studio.
 
• Deploy: This option makes the module available to all the users in 
your organization. Further customization can be done by using the 
Studio.
 
• Export: This option is used to share the module with other devel-
opers. Sugar creates a zip file that a developer can save and install 
with the Module Loader. Further customization can be done by 
using the Module Builder.
 
 For now, concentrate on deploying your new module to all your users.
 
3. Click Deploy.
 
 Sugar begins loading the module into your Sugar instance and indicates 
that something wonderful is happening. Any smoke that emanates from 
your computer is temporary.

288
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
 When Sugar finishes deploying your module, the Package page will 
refresh. If you want to make further changes to the module, you can do 
so from the Sugar Studio where the new module appears along with all 
the existing ones. Your users can access the module by clicking the cor-
responding tab on the Module Tab bar.
Configuring Module Tabs
By default, all the module tabs are displayed when a user logs in to Sugar. 
However, if you’re the administrator you can decide which module tabs to 
display — and which ones to hide. You can even choose the order in which 
these tabs are arranged.
When you decide which tabs you want your users to access, the users can 
go into the My Account page and make further modification (see Chapter 9). 
However, users can’t add module tabs that the administrator removed. And, 
if the administrator has an ax to grind with the users — or is afraid that they 
might wreak a bit of havoc — the administrator can prevent the users from 
making any changes to the module tabs.
 
Although it’s been said that you can’t go home again, this adage doesn’t hold 
true in Sugar. Nobody — not even Mr. Administrator — can hide the Home tab.
Renaming the module tabs
You can rename the module tabs that display in Sugar:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Rename Tabs in 
the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Administration: Rename Tabs page opens. As shown in Figure 
15-14, it’s a simple page consisting of the name of the official tab name 
(Database Value) and its label (Display Value).
 
2. Click the label that you want to edit and replace it with the new value.
 
 You can’t change the name of the Database Value; it remains constant 
just in case you want to return to the original tab name.
 
3. Click Save to save your changes.
 
 The new tab name appears in the module tab menu.

289
 Chapter 15: Adding an Extra Lump of Sugar
 
Figure 15-14: 
Renaming a 
tab.
 
Playing hide and seek with the tabs
By now you’re acquainted with the basic modules and are probably in awe 
of their functionality. However, sometimes less is more — particularly when 
you are dealing with computer-challenged database users. For example, you 
might not use the Quoting module that you’ll find in the Professional and 
Enterprise versions, or you might use Outlook for your activities and not 
want to confuse your users with the Activities module. Or perhaps you just 
want to start out slowly and introduce new modules as your users become 
more proficient Sugar users.
Sugar makes it easy to hide a module tab. The operative word here is hide; 
it’s an easy matter to unhide a module should you decide you’d like to use 
the module.
Follow these steps to hide a module tab — or to bring it back to life if you’ve 
already hidden it:
 
1. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page and then click Configure Tabs 
in the Developer Tools subpanel.
 
 The Configure Tabs page shown in Figure 15-15 opens. Like the Rename 
Tabs page, this is a simple page consisting of two columns: Display Tabs 
and Hide Tabs.

290
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 15-15: 
Hiding tabs 
from the 
users.
 
 
2. Drag any tabs you don’t want the users to have access to from the 
Display Tabs column to the Hide Tabs column.
 
3. (Optional) Remove the check mark in the Allow Users to Configure 
Tabs check box if you don’t want the users to make changes to the 
tabs that they’re allowed to access.
 
4. Click Save to save your changes.

I
f you’re the Master Chef . . . er, I mean database administrator, you need 
to make sure that your soufflés don’t flop — and that your database purrs 
along. As the administrator, you have the sole access to the Administration 
module where you perform great feats of daring, including updating Sugar 
and setting system settings. You also set up users — and decide which areas 
of Sugar they can access.
Setting up the System
If you’re the database administrator, becoming familiar with the system 
configuration is good practice. If you’re the sole user of the database, these 
settings will likely save your sanity. If you share the database with other 
users, these settings can probably save you all a lot of head scratching.
You can access Sugar’s System Settings by clicking the Admin link on your 
Home page and then scrolling to the System subpanel of the Administration 
Home page. The System subpanel (shown in Figure 16-1) is divided into nine 
areas; although I only cover the most basic ones, feel free to flip through the 
other settings.

292
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 16-1: 
The System 
subpanel.
 
Fiddling with the System settings
Clicking the System Settings link on the System subpanel opens the System 
Settings page shown in Figure 16-2. Here’s where you can configure various 
default settings that will apply to all your users.
You have a number of options to change including:
 
✓ User Interface: This subpanel configures how users will view Sugar. You 
can set the number of records they’ll see in a List view or the number of 
subpanels they’ll see in a record’s Detail view.
 
 Worried that your users won’t like your choices? Don’t be — users can 
specify different settings for many of the options in their My Accounts 
page. Worried that they will change so many things that they’ll get 
confused? You can opt to keep them from customizing their Home page 
and subpanel layouts by checking those options.
 
✓ Logos: Here’s where you can upload your logo to give Sugar a piece of 
your corporate identity.
 
✓ LDAP Authentication Support: If your organization is using LDAP or 
authentication, you can also enable LDAP authentication in Sugar.
 
✓ Proxy Settings: If you’re using a proxy server to connect to the Internet, 
you’ll need to enter the settings.
 
✓ Customer Self-Service Portal: This option enables your customers to 
access their Bugs, Notes, and Cases information.
 
✓ SkypeOut: Allows your users to make calls through Skype.
 
✓ Mail Merge: Click this if you have the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Word.
 
✓ Export: By default, both users and administrators can export files 
from Sugar. However, here’s where you can prevent users from 
exporting data.
Click the Save button after you select your System Settings options to make 
sure they’re saved.

Sticking to a Scheduler
You might nickname Sugar’s Scheduler “Set it and Forget it” because that’s 
exactly what it does. You can schedule a variety of jobs that will automati-
cally run based on your pre-determined time schedule. The benefit is the 
peace of mind you have in knowing that various scheduled maintenance 
tasks will run without any further intervention. It’s a wonderful thing — set 
up a task and have Scheduler complete the job for you.
The Scheduler allows you to automate several key jobs. The small amount of 
time you need to set up a job in the Scheduler will save you plenty of time — 
and possible heartache — in the future.
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page and then click Scheduler in the System 
subpanel.
 
 The Schedulers Home page opens. As shown in Figure 16-3, the 
Scheduler comes equipped with several pre-programmed jobs. Feel free 
to edit them to make them behave the way you want, or continue to 
create your own unique task:
 
• Process Workflow Tasks: Chapter 14 talks about Sugar’s Workflow 
feature that triggers an activity based on an event. This process 
runs those triggers. 
 
• Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks: Runs reports and e-mails 
them to a specific user.
 
• Check Inbound Mail Accounts: Checks for activity in your Inbox.

294
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
• Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign E-mails: Checks your mass 
e-mail campaigns to look for any bounced e-mails.
 
• Run Nightly Mass E-mail Campaigns: Sends the outbound e-mail for 
your mass e-mail campaigns.
 
• Prune Database on 1st of Month: Similar to the Windows 
Defragmenter, this permanently deletes any records that your 
users have deleted to improve performance.
 
2. Click Create Scheduler in the Shortcuts menu of the Scheduler 
Home page.
 
 The new Schedulers form opens, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
3. Fill in the Scheduler information:
 
• Job Name: Give the job a name.
 
• Status: Select Active when you’re ready to go live with the job.
 
• Job: Select a job type from the drop-down list. The job names 
correspond with the pre-programmed jobs listed above.
 
• Interval: Specify the time intervals to check for new scheduled 
jobs.
 
• Execute If Missed: If for some reason the job didn’t run, select this 
check box to run it manually — just give yourself a minute or two 
because it might take a while to run the job.
 
• Date & Time Start: Give a date for the job to start running.
 
• Date & Time End: Specify a date to stop running the job.

 If you’re using UNIX or Linux, you need to add a new Cronjob to your 
Crontab. If you’re using Microsoft Windows, you can add the tasks to the 
Task Scheduler.
 
 The new job appears on the Schedule List.
Applying Sugar updates
Nobody’s perfect. Although it might seem that Sugar comes pretty darned 
close, from time to time, a few of those dreaded bugs slip by the program-
mers and annoy the heck out of you. Or, you run out to purchase the latest 
and greatest version of Microsoft Office only to find that it won’t work with 
your existing version of Sugar. Enter the update.
Sugar’s Upgrade Wizard provides a quick way to upload and install Sugar 
upgrades. During the upgrade process, Sugar automatically converts all 
customizations implemented through the Sugar Studio. And, although the 
database administrator is the only one who can update Sugar, she can 
do it from the luxury of her desktop rather than needing direct access to 
the server.
As you can see in Figure 16-5, Sugar makes it abundantly clear when a new 
update arrives on the scene by placing a notification at the top of just about 
any window you wander to.

296
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
Figure 16-5: 
It’s time 
to update 
Sugar.
 
Here’s what you need to do to make sure you have the latest and greatest 
Sugar version:
 
1. Download the appropriate Sugar Upgrade zip file from the Sugar 
Web site.
 
 For your convenience, www.sugarcrm.com has a download link that 
takes you to the Download Wizard that walks you through the process 
of finding the correct upgrade file.
 
2. Click Admin on the Sugar Home page.
 
3. Click Upgrade Wizard in the System subpanel of the Administration 
Home page.
 
 The Upgrade Wizard displays, as shown in Figure 16-6. The wizard will 
hold your hand while you continue to upgrade your Sugar installation. 
 
4. Click Next to continue.
 
 A progress window appears while Sugar checks your system to make 
sure you’re good to go. When it finishes, the System Checks page 
appears.
 
Figure 16-6: 
Sugar’s

297
 Chapter 16: The Administrator’s Recipe Book
 
5. Click Next.
 
 The Upload an Upgrade page appears.
 
6. Click the Browse button, navigate to the location where you saved 
the Upgrade zip file, and then select the file.
 
 The path and filename conveniently appear in the Upload an Upgrade 
box.
 
7. Click the Upload Upgrade button to upload the package to your 
installation of Sugar.
 
 An indicator window appears while Sugar uploads the package and 
displays it on the page. Feeling lost? Take a look at Figure 16-7 which 
should help clear things up. 
 
8. Click Next to continue.
 
 Again, you have to wait a minute as Sugar performs a preflight check. At 
this time, you just might feel like you’re in a spaceship hurtling towards 
Mars. At any rate, the Commit Upgrade window appears.
 
9. Click Next to continue.
 
 Like most wizards, the Upgrade Wizard contains many Next buttons. 
However, this is the final one because if all systems are go, you’ll see the 
Debrief window.
 
10. Click Done.
 
 Aren’t you glad I didn’t tell you to click Next? At any rate, you’re treated 
to a page verifying that yes, indeedy, you have officially upgraded to the 
latest Sugar version.

Getting Locale with the locals
Clicking the Locale Settings link on the System subpanel opens the System 
Locale Settings page you see in Figure 16-8. Here’s where you can configure 
various default settings that apply to all your users. Use this page to specify 
the default system-wide locale settings, such as the language, date and time 
format, and even the type of currency that your company uses. Changing 
these settings ensures consistency for users when they access Sugar; these 
settings appear throughout Sugar in various documents including Quotes and 
Contracts.
 
Figure 16-8:

the system-
wide locale

Dealing with Database Users
A user is a special contact in your database who logs in to your database. 
If several people enter data into your Sugar database, I highly recommend 
setting up each person as a separate user. If you and Jane are both set up as 
users of the database, make sure that you log in as you and Jane logs in as 
herself. Sugar automatically enters several key pieces of information based 
on how you log in to the database. For example, you’re recognized as the 
record creator of each new Contacts record that you add to the database. 
Your name is automatically associated with any meetings, calls, or other 
activities that you schedule. Having unique, identifiable users in a database 
allows you to view your activities on a calendar. Otherwise, you might find 
yourself driving to Podunk to visit Jane’s mom on her birthday!

299
 Chapter 16: The Administrator’s Recipe Book
After you assign the players to the teams, get ready to rumble! The purpose 
of the game is to decide exactly what each user can do within Sugar. You can 
do this on a user-by-user basis. This works out well if you assign access 
rights to each new contact when you create it. Or, as the administrator, you 
can assign users a role. Roles determine which modules a user has access 
to — and the type of activities he can perform within that module.
Adding a new user to the mix
Although creating new users is an easy process, take your time and fill in as 
much pertinent information as possible. In addition to simply creating users, 
the administrator can — and should — include contact information about 
the users.
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page.
 
 It’s only logical that because only an administrator can create new 
users, you start the process on the Administration Home page. 
 
2. Choose Create New User from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Users page shown in Figure 16-9 opens.
 
Figure 16-9: 
Adding a 
new Sugar 
user.
 

300
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
3. Add the user’s first and last name, their login name and password, 
and the user status in the top subpanel.
 
 The user name is the name the user will use to log in to the database. 
Although it’s not case sensitive, make sure you remember what name 
you decide on. If you set up multiple users for the same database, 
consider sticking to a set naming convention: Gary Kahn or gkahn are 
good choices; you might want to avoid Gary B. Kahn or Gary Kahn, Esq.
 
 You can’t delete users but you can stop someone from accessing the 
database by changing their status to inactive.This is done so that you 
can still see what records have been assigned to them, or what fields 
they’ve changed.
 
4. Select the appropriate options in the User Settings subpanel. 
 
 You can specify whether you want the new user to have Mail Merge 
privileges (if the user has access to the Sugar plug-in for Microsoft 
Word), and how you want his name to appear at the top of the various 
Sugar views. You can enable e-mail notifications to the user when a 
record is assigned to him.
 
 Most importantly, you can specify the type of user you wish to create. In 
Sugar, there are three different kinds of users in addition to the basic 
end-user. By default, Sugar assumes you’re creating an end-user unless 
you specify otherwise.
 
• Administrator: Finding the job of database administrator to be 
overwhelming? You can assign another user to be your partner 
in crime.
 
 Assigning two users as the database administrator is always a 
good idea. Not only do those two people feel extra special, but it 
can also save your little rear end. As hard as it might be to believe, 
the administrator might leave the company suddenly and without 
warning — taking the keys for the restroom and the password for 
the database with him. This means you might not be able to access 
the database, add users, or make field changes. You might also find 
yourself looking for a new job. Remember: No password, no entry!
 
• Group user: A group user can’t log in to the database. The function 
of a group user is to receive general inbound e-mails that might 
pertain to a department as a whole instead of a specific individual. 
For example, you might create a group user named Complaints to 
handle customer service issues. You can then assign them to the 
appropriate users from the group Inbox.
 
• Portal-only user: A portal user can log in to portals created in Sugar 
but can’t log in to the Sugar database. For example, you might 
create a user record for one of your top customers so that he can 
access general portal information, such as FAQ’s and the 
Knowledge Base.

 Chapter 16: The Administrator’s Recipe Book
 
5. Set the values in the Locale Settings subpanel.
 
 Although you can set default locale settings (see the earlier “Getting 
Locale with the locals” section), you can change these values for individ-
ual users if necessary. For example, your company may be headquar-
tered in New York, thus you’ve set default locale values to EST and US 
Dollar. However, you may have a user located in California who works 
on PST, or maybe a user in London who works in a different time zone 
and uses a different currency.
 
6. Specify the information in the User Information subpanel.
 
 Here’s where you can supply work-related details including the user’s 
title, department, phone numbers, who he reports to, and any other per-
tinent info. You can even add a comment in the Notes field if necessary.
 
7. Supply the user’s home address in the Address Information subpanel.
 
8. (Optional) Enter a Publish Key in the Calendar Options subpanel to 
prevent others from publishing the user’s calendar.
 
9. Change the modules that the user can see in the Layout Options 
subpanel.
 
 By default, a new user has access to all the Sugar modules. As the 
administrator, you decide which of those modules the user can access.
 
 As shown in Figure 16-10, the Layout Options subpanel contains three 
lists:
 
• Display Tabs: Lists the tabs that the user can see.
 
• Hide Tabs: Shows the tabs that the user can’t see.
 
• Admin Remove Tabs: Lists the tabs that none of the users can see.
 
 You can move a tab from one list to another by selecting it and then 
clicking the appropriate right or left arrow. To change the order of the 
modules, select the module and then click the up or down arrow.
  
 Chapter 3 shows the end-user how to configure the tabs that she sees. 
Chapter 15, on the other hand, shows you how the administrator can 
prevent the end-user from doing exactly that.
 
10. Add the user’s e-mail address in the Email options subpanel.
 
 You can set up an e-mail address — or two or three — for each user.
 
11. Click Save to create the user.
 
 You land with a plop on the Users Home page where the new user is 
listed right along with all the other Sugar users. They also appear on the 
Employees List, which you can access by clicking the Employees link 
from any of the Sugar views.

Doing the rock ’n role
After you create your users, you assign them roles depending on the tasks 
they perform within your organization. By default, users have access to all 
Sugar modules. Roles enable the administrator to limit access to specific 
modules. Additionally, roles allow the administrator to decide the functional-
ity the users have within a module.
For example, you may decide that your customer service folks don’t need 
to access the Opportunities module; you can create a role that restricts 
their access to this module and assign that role to everyone in the customer 
service department. Or, you may want to allow your sales staff the ability 
to view and edit Accounts, Contacts, and Leads records but not the ability to 
delete or export records.
Users who aren’t assigned a role can, by default, access and take any action 
in any module they want. The only way you can change that access is by 
assigning them a role that limits access to a module. The same role can be 
assigned to multiple users, and a user can be assigned multiple roles.
 
An administrator, by default, has permission to access all modules and 
records. And, the only way you can deny him those permissions is to edit his 
user record so that he is no longer an administrator.
Creating a starring role
Follow these steps to create a role:

303
 Chapter 16: The Administrator’s Recipe Book
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page.
 
2. Click Role Management in the Users subpanel.
 
 The Roles Home page opens.
 
3. Choose Create Role from the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Roles page opens.
 
4. Supply a name for the role, give it an optional description, and then 
click Save.
 
 All the Sugar modules — along with the basic functions — are listed in 
table format. You use this table to grant permission to access modules 
or perform specific actions.
 
 As shown in Figure 16-11, the edit view appears a bit intimidating at first.
 
 You might think of this as a giant Bingo board. The column on the 
left lists all the Sugar modules. The top row shows you the various 
functions:
 
• Access: Determines whether the users assigned that role can 
access a module.
 
 If you deny users access to a module, you automatically deny 
the users all the functionality listed in the rest of the columns in 
that row.
 
• Delete: Authorizes the user to delete records (Contacts, Accounts, 
Leads, Opportunities, and so on). By default, the administrator 
already has permission to delete at will.
 
Figure 16-11: 
Creating a 
user role.
 

304
Part V: Working with Extra-Strength Sugar 
 
• Edit: Lets users edit records in the module through the Edit page, 
List view, or the Mass Update panel in the List view.
 
• Export: Permits the user to export any List view information to a 
file.
 
• Import: Users can import record data in the module.
 
• List: Users can view lists of records in the module or in a subpanel 
but can’t edit them unless they have editing permissions.
 
• View: Users can see the Details view of module records.
 
5. Double-click a cell to change its value.
 
 Here’s where the Bingo board concept comes into play. If you want to 
disable a module, double-click the cell in which the Access column and 
the module row intersect. Depending on the cell you’re modifying, you 
have a number of options available:
 
• All: All users who are assigned to the role can perform the action.
 
• Owner: Only the user who either created or is assigned to the 
record can perform the action.
 
• None: None of the users assigned to the role get to play — or 
perform the action.
 
• Enabled: Allows the user to view the module.
 
• Disabled: Hides the module from the users’ view.
 
• Not Set: This leaves the setting unchanged. This can be because 
you haven’t gotten to the setting yet or you left the function unset 
knowing that another role covers that particular function.
 
 If you assign more than one role to a user, the most restrictive setting 
prevails. For example, if a user is assigned to two roles — one allowing 
him to access a module and one disabling the module — he won’t be 
able to access the module.
 
6. Click Save when you finish defining the role.
Rolling out roles to the users
By now, if you’re following along at home, you’ve added a couple of new 
users to your database. You’ve also created a role that will both let the 
users carry out their day-to-day business and leave you with the security of 
knowing they can’t abscond with the entirety of your database should they 
decide to seek employment elsewhere. Your next step is to tie the two 
together. Fortunately for you, the hard work is over; assigning a role to a user 
is very easy.
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page.
 
2. Click Role Management in the Users subpanel.
 
 The Roles Home page opens. The role you created is listed there.

305
 Chapter 16: The Administrator’s Recipe Book
 
3. Click the name of the role to which you want to assign a few users.
 
 The Roles page opens.
 
4. Scroll to the Users subpanel (see Figure 16-12).
 
Figure 16-12: 
The Users 
sub-panel 
of the Roles 
Home page.
 
 
5. Click the Select button.
 
 The Select Users window opens, revealing a list of all your database 
users.
 
6. Select the corresponding check box for all the users you want to 
assign to the role and then click Select.
 
 The user(s) that you assign to the role appear in the Users subpanel.
 
7. (Optional) Click the Rem icon corresponding to a username to remove 
a user if you no longer want him to abide by the role.
Viewing roles for a user
Because so many options are available to you when creating a role, it’s only 
natural that you might get lost along the way, particularly if you assign sev-
eral roles to a user. Fear not, dear reader. Sugar again has your back, allowing 
you to view the finished work — or in this case the final role settings — on a 
user-by-user basis.
Follow these steps to view the permissions you set for each user:
 
1. Click Admin on the Home page.
 
2. Click Role Management in the Users subpanel.
 
3. Choose List Roles by User in the Shortcuts menu.
 
 The Roles page opens, looking slightly different than you’ve seen it 
before.
 
4. Choose the user in question from the drop-down list.
 
 Sugar responds by displaying a table detailing the user’s permissions 
for each module. The bad news is that you can’t change any of the 
permissions for the user. The good news is that you can click the List 
Roles shortcut and edit the role if you need to.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
very For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. By golly, 
this book is no exception to that rule. Think of this as 
the icing on your Sugar cake. Here’s where I answer a few 
of your more burning questions:
 
✓ What in the world is the difference between Sugar 
Community Edition and the subscription-based 
Professional and Enterprise versions?
 
✓ Is there a way that I sweeten the deal even 
more — or at least add a few items to make Sugar 
work even “more better?”
 
✓ Where do I go from here if I want to learn even 
more about Sugar?

Chapter 17

Professional or Enterprise Version

A
s I mention throughout this book, SugarCRM has three flavors: 
Community, Professional, and Enterprise. Each version builds on the 
previous version: Professional contains all the features you find in the 
Community edition; and Enterprise has all the features you find in SugarCRM 
Professional. I sprinkle references to the Pro and Enterprise features through-
out the book. And, in Chapter 14, I devote an entire chapter to a few of the 
Professional features. In this chapter, I list my ten favorite Pro and Enterprise 
features.
 
Sugar created the Professional and Enterprise editions to support companies 
with many users and teams. Hopefully, customers with less than five users 
find that the Sugar Community Edition meets their needs because both the 
Professional and Enterprise versions require a minimum of five users.

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Users of a shared database must all use the same version of Sugar. A user of 
the Sugar Community Edition (CE) can’t open a database created with Sugar 
Pro. However, you can upgrade a Sugar CE database if you decide to move up 
to Sugar Pro or Enterprise.
 
You can use any of the Sugar versions in a network environment.
Becoming a Team Player
You find references to teams sprinkled throughout the Pro and Enterprise 
editions. The administrator can create and manage teams based on job 
type, division, geography, or any other criteria he can think of. After the 
administrator creates a team — and assigns users to it — he can assign 
access rights to the team.
You can assign most of the record types that you create in Sugar to both an 
individual user and a team. For example, Opportunities, Contacts, Accounts, 
and Cases can all become the shared responsibility of a team of users.
I Want that Report on My Desk 
First Thing in the Morning!
Putting information into Sugar is only half the fun; the other half comes from 
being able to mine and manipulate the data to give you a good feel for what’s 
working in your business — and what’s not.
If you’re a single user running your business from a tree house in your back-
yard, you probably have most of the facts and figures about your company 
whirling around in your head. The amount of data in your database grows 
proportionately with your number of employees; relying on your memory is 
no longer a viable solution.
The Reports module (see Chapter 14) transforms piles of data into organized 
knowledge. Managers can evaluate performance by running reports on 
salespeople, marketing campaigns, and customer service issues. Reports are 
drillable which means managers can double-click the information in a report 
to see the underlying data.

311
 Chapter 17: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to the Professional or Enterprise Version
The Reports module includes a basic report writer, so managers can develop 
new reports based on customized queries. Customized reports can also take 
the form of a chart or graph so they can appear on the Dashboard module. 
Reports can be printed in PDF format and you can schedule them to be sent 
to your Inbox on a regular basis.
You Can Quote Me on That
Although a handshake is binding in some parts of the world, most of us 
would prefer to have our business dealings committed to in writing. Sugar 
Professional allows you to create Quotes (Chapter 7) and Contracts, which 
you can deliver to customers via e-mail, Word, or PDF format.
Sales reps can generate quotes that calculate line items, currencies, and 
taxes — saving you the worry of having to double-check their math. 
Version control makes it easier to manage the myriad versions of quotes 
and contracts that your users have issued.
The Quotes module integrates with the Products module so that you can 
create a Product Catalog designed to arm your sales reps with product 
information ranging from the amount of inventory on hand to discounted 
pricing available to preferred customers.
The Forecast Is Always Sunny
Large companies — especially those with lots of cubicles and a large sales 
force — live and die by quotas. The Forecasting module (refer to Chapter 14) 
allows sales managers to view the committed sale amounts of individual sales 
people as well as sales teams.
Forecasts are based on opportunities. The module includes a forecasting 
worksheet that allows you to set a quota and predict the best- and worst-case 
scenarios for that quota. At the end of the sales period, you can then see who 
is meeting or beating their quota — and who’s not.
Becoming a Road Warrior
Who says you can’t take it with you? Certainly not the folks at Sugar who give 
you an option for accessing your database when away from the office — and 
possibly away from an Internet connection.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The Sugar Offline Client enables users and administrators to use the Sugar 
application on their local machines without connecting to the Sugar server. 
This allows users to work in locations where it’s not possible to access the 
Sugar server. They can then synchronize the data on their PC with the data 
on the Sugar server to make the updated information available to all users in 
the organization.
You can use the Sugar Offline Client, which is only supported on the 
Microsoft Windows platform, for the following subset of Sugar modules:
 
✓ Home
 
✓ Calendar
 
✓ Activities
 
✓ Accounts
 
✓ Contacts
 
✓ Emails
 
✓ Leads
 
✓ Opportunities
 
✓ Quotes
 
✓ Products
 
✓ Forecasts
 
The Offline Client does not synchronize information from any custom modules 
that you create.
Keep Up with the Folks at Microsoft
Face it. Microsoft is everywhere. Most likely, you’re running more than 
one of its products on your computer. Like many other software products, 
Sugar takes the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” philosophy. Sugar 
Professional and Enterprise includes plug-ins to two of the most popular 
Microsoft products — Outlook and Word (refer to Chapters 12 and 8, 
respectively).
 
Both Microsoft plug-ins are also available to Community Edition users for a 
slight fee.
A word about Word
The Sugar plug-in for Microsoft Word enables you to merge data, such as 
names and addresses, from Sugar Professional or Enterprise with form letter 
templates created in Word.
With the Sugar plug-in for Word, you can
 
✓ Perform a mail merge from Sugar using a Microsoft Word template.
 
✓ Perform a mail merge from Microsoft Word using Sugar data.

313
 Chapter 17: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to the Professional or Enterprise Version
Changing your Outlook on Sugar
For many Sugar users, Microsoft Outlook represents their first foray into the 
world of CRM. Because old habits are hard to break, new Sugar users often 
encounter Outlook anxiety pains. The Outlook plug-in connects Sugar to 
Outlook. Outlook addicts synchronize Outlook e-mail, contacts, and calendar 
information into the appropriate Sugar modules.
With the Sugar plug-in for Outlook, you can
 
✓ Synchronize contacts, appointments, and tasks between Outlook 
and Sugar.
 
✓ Archive e-mail items from Outlook with Sugar Accounts, Bugs, Cases, 
Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, and Projects records.
 
✓ View Sugar records from within Outlook.
 
✓ Create Sugar Accounts, Bugs, Cases, Contacts, Leads, and 
Opportunities records from within Outlook.
Portals
Sugar’s Customer Self-Service Portal module allows companies to provide 
marketing, sales, and support services via the Internet. Customers with a 
problem can create a case, upload relevant information, and track the case to 
its resolution without ever having to pick up a phone. All cases automatically 
appear within the Sugar Cases module.
Using the customer portal reduces the time your customer service and 
tech support people spend on the phone — and this typically helps your 
bottom line.
In addition to creating a case, the Sugar portals allow additional functionality:
 
✓ Account Updates: Customers can update their contact information.
 
✓ Subscription Management: Customers can select the subscriptions to 
newsletters that they want to receive; their selections are automatically 
registered in the Campaigns module.
 
✓ Knowledge Search: Customers can search for information found within 
the Knowledge Base, FAQs, and Bug Tracker.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Flow through Your Work with Ease
A workflow (see Chapter 14) is a defined series of tasks to produce an out-
come. Sugar Professional and Enterprise editions include a Workflow module 
that allows you to define different workflows for different types of jobs. 
Defining workflows has several benefits: it allows the company to standardize 
their business processes, it automates the procedure, and it insures follow-
through.
In Sugar, a workflow consists of four parts:
 
✓ Templates: You define workflow templates based on the process you 
want to follow.
 
✓ Alerts: You create alerts based on changes to records or a time lapse.
 
✓ Triggers: You define what action sets the wheels in motion.
 
✓ Define actions: You define what you want to happen when a trigger is 
set off.
Access Control
If you are the only user of your Sugar database, your security might be 
limited to the password that allows you access to your entire database. In 
the Community Edition of Sugar, the administrator can create roles (refer to 
Chapter 16) that determine the access level of each user to the various mod-
ules and what they can change and/or see when they access that module.
Sugar Professional and Enterprise editions take the issue of security a bit 
further by giving you a few more options:
 
✓ Field-Level Access Controls: You can limit access to specific field 
information.
 
✓ Role Management: You can create roles based on user types 
(Administrator and Normal).
Building a Bigger Database
MySQL and PHP are both Open Source (meaning they are free to download 
and use) software products. The PHP/MySQL combination has become a 
popular choice for database-driven Web sites and the combination that Sugar 
supplies with all three versions. Although MySQL can be used for a variety of 
applications, it is most commonly found on Web servers.

315
 Chapter 17: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to the Professional or Enterprise Version
For most of you, the MySQL database is powerful enough to run your 
business — and your database software. However, larger corporations 
often require beefier database software to run their various business 
processes. The two most popular database applications are Oracle and 
Microsoft SQL Server.
SugarCRM Enterprise allows you to connect Sugar to either an Oracle or 
SQL Standard Server database. This is enticing to large companies for a 
number of reasons:
 
✓ ROI: Oracle and SQL Server are expensive databases. When a company 
has forked over a sizeable amount of cash for these solutions, they want 
to be able to use these powerful databases with all of their applications.
 
✓ Smaller learning curve: All databases need an administrator and 
Sugar is no exception. And, chances are good that the over-worked and 
underpaid IT guy is going to inherit that position. Using a database that 
he’s already familiar with means he already has the advanced knowledge 
needed to keep the database in good, working order.
 
✓ Advanced Reporting Capabilities: Larger, more powerful databases 
come with design tools to create reports accommodating just about any 
need. Administrators can design complex reports by using familiar 
design tools.

t’s only natural that Sugar, an Open Source product, has captured the 
imagination of developer types who love to program. Literally hundreds of 
add-on products work with Sugar. The products range from little things like 
changing the screen colors to robust solutions for your HR department. In 
this chapter, I highlight my favorites.
You can go to two areas to find the products listed in this chapter — as well 
as investigate hundreds of other products on your own:
 
✓ SugarExchange (www.sugarexchange.com): Only those developers 
who are “certified” by Sugar can post products to this site; developers 
pay to list their products here.
 
✓ SugarForge (www.sugarforge.org): A Web site where anyone can 
post embellishments to Sugar.
 
There is a bit of “good and bad” news that goes along with SugarForge. The 
good news is that many of the products listed here are either free or very 
inexpensive. The bad news is that sometimes you get what you pay for — and 
you might find that some of these products are “handyman specials” that 
require a bit of tweaking. Many of the products mentioned here come with 
free trial versions — you might want to try these products before you buy.

318

Parlez-vous Francais?
If there is any question as to the worldwide popularity of Sugar then check 
out the fact that Sugar has been translated to over 75 languages. Called 
language packs, you find these translations on both SugarForge and 
SugarExchange by clicking the Language Packs category on the left edge of 
both sites.
In addition to typical languages, such as French and Spanish, you find 
Sugar language packs in everything from Hebrew and Hungarian to Thai 
and Turkish.
I Think I Need a Change of Theme
Out of the box, Sugar comes with a number of themes (Chapter 3) that 
change the color of your Sugar installation as well as the look of the Module 
tabs. Although changing the theme won’t make you work better — it just 
might make you feel a bit more at home in Sugar.
Some of the themes are designed to be very functional. For example, the 
Enhanced Notes theme gives you the ability to attach notes to your various 
records that include a username. Other themes, such as the Golf theme and 
the Love theme, are a bit more whimsical. There are even RTL themes that — 
you guessed it — work with languages that read from right to left.
Have BlackBerry, Will Travel
Who doesn’t use a smartphone these days? And more and more of those 
phones are a BlackBerry. Although Sugar can be accessed directly from the 
browser of any smartphone, there are a few limitations:
 
✓ The screen on a handheld device is much smaller than on your laptop 
or desktop machine. Therefore, although you can see Sugar on your 
phone, you’ll be doing a lot of scrolling to see an entire record.
 
✓ Pulling up links on a handheld is much slower than on a computer.
 
✓ If you don’t have connectivity — such as when you’re traveling on an 
airplane — you don’t have a database.

319
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Make Your Life Even Sweeter
Mobile Edge is a monthly subscription guaranteed to keep you up-to-date 
with your Sugar database. Quite simply, it installs a mini version of Sugar on 
your BlackBerry. You can view all the basic Sugar modules — Accounts, 
Contacts, Activities, Opportunities, and so on. Any changes you make are 
instantly available to the home office, and vice versa.
Grabbing Tidbits of Information
You might have a love/hate relationship with Sugar: You love having a CRM 
database but hate entering all of that information. If that’s the case, then 
Contact Capture by Broadlook Technologies should rank high on your list of 
must have add-ons.
Contact Capture can capture information from a variety of sources including 
e-mail signatures and Web site directories. The procedure is simple: highlight 
the information, press a hotkey, and indicate where you want the information 
to go (Contacts, Leads, and/or Accounts records). For example, you can 
highlight contact information from the signature area of an incoming e-mail 
and within seconds add a new record to Sugar. Better yet, you can find a list 
of contacts from virtually any source and export the entire list to Sugar.
Broadlook is so sure that you’ll become addicted to Constant Capture that 
they provide it free for the first year.
Plugging in to Microsoft Office
Face it. Microsoft is everywhere. Most likely, you’re running more than one of 
its products on your computer. Like many other software products, Sugar 
takes the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” philosophy. Sugar offers plug-ins to 
two of the most popular Microsoft products: Outlook and Word. You can 
download the plug-ins free if you are using either the Professional or 
Enterprise versions of Sugar; you’ll have to pay for them if you’re using Sugar 
Community Edition.
Even though the following two products are mentioned in Chapters 8 and 12, 
they are so useful that they bear repeating in this chapter.
Plugging in to Outlook
A common misconception I hear from potential CRM users is that they 
don’t need CRM because they’re using Outlook. I like to think of SugarCRM 
as Outlook on steroids because of all the powerful tools you can find in 

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Sugar that aren’t available in Outlook. However, many Sugar users continue 
to use Outlook as their e-mail client yet want to have those e-mails linked 
to Sugar.
The Outlook plug-in (refer to Chapter 12) installs a Sugar toolbar in Outlook. 
From there you have a number of options:
 
✓ Archive to Sugar: Attach the e-mail — or edit the e-mail content on the 
fly — to Bugs, Accounts, Contacts, or other Sugar records.
 
✓ Create a new Sugar record: Create a new Accounts, Bugs, or Contacts 
record from an incoming e-mail.
 
✓ Sync to Sugar: Synchronize your Outlook contacts, appointments, and 
tasks to Sugar at the click of a button.
What’s in a Word
Chapter 12 shows you how to create e-mail templates using Sugar’s template 
editor. However, many of you would probably prefer to use Word because 
you’re already familiar with it. With the Word plug-in, you can create 
templates in Word. The process is quite simple. You start by creating a 
document in Word — or editing an existing one. Anytime you want Sugar data 
to fill the template, you select the appropriate Sugar field name from the 
SugarCRM toolbar that appears in Word. Once completed, you can perform a 
mail merge on the fly by selecting Sugar Contacts, Accounts, or Opportunities 
records.
Chapter 8 talks about creating a document library in Sugar. The Word plug-in 
takes the concept one step further by allowing any of the documents you 
create in Word to be uploaded directly into Sugar. Once loaded, they’re avail-
able in the Documents module — or any other module that uses templates.
Using a Talended Piece of Software
A new business has it fairly easy. They can download a copy of SugarCRM 
and have their marketing, service, and support needs met instantly. Throw in 
a piece of accounting software and they’re ready to go.
However, the plot thickens with larger or more established companies. First, 
they might have information floating around in a variety of legacy systems 
that Sugar is replacing; these products can range from Outlook and Excel to 
Access and SQL or even Salesforce.com. Although you can import informa-
tion into Sugar fairly easily, the process becomes very cumbersome if you 
have to bring in multiple data sources — many of which include multiple 
tables of information.

321
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Make Your Life Even Sweeter
The process gets even more complicated. Some of your systems may contain 
data that you need to keep in both Sugar and the other, existing system. For 
example, you might have proprietary inventory-tracking software that 
includes customer contact information that must be updated on an ongoing 
basis. It’s enough to make most of us wave the white flag and admit defeat.
But wait, the cavalry — or in this case Talend — arrives to save the day. 
Talend software will
 
✓ Help with your data migration.
 
✓ Synchronize the data among your various systems.
 
✓ Give you a 360-degree look at all of your data.
Talend includes connectors to over 250 different data source types for 
purposes of migrating and synchronize your data. You can “click and pick” to 
define very complicated mapping systems between your various databases. 
In addition, Talend helps you clean data and even eliminate your duplicates.
But wait — there’s more! After you synchronize your data, you need a way 
to analyze it. You might want to identify trends or target a certain class of 
customer. For example, you might want to focus on your customers who 
have placed the biggest orders — and logged the fewest support calls. Using 
Talend, you can run just such a report.
Talend is available in both Open Source (free) and Enterprise (subscription) 
editions.
Connecting QuickBooks to Sugar
Most business owners need at least two pieces of software to run a business: 
database software like Sugar to keep track of customers (and to market 
to potential customers) and accounting software to help keep an eye on 
the bottom line. Unfortunately, software that does it all often comes with 
a whopping price tag — and a very steep learning curve. As a result, you 
might have chosen Sugar for you CRM needs and QuickBooks for your 
accounting needs.
QConnector, by RPS Technology, lets you have the best of both worlds. It 
eliminates the need to enter your information into both sets of software 
because it synchronizes your QuickBooks data with your Sugar data. The 
synchronization includes your account, invoice, payment, and product data 
so that you can bid adieu to double-entry data input.

Getting Organized with Sales Folders
Chapter 8 shows you how to attach a document to the Documents module. 
However, if you’re attaching a lot of documents, you might find this feature to 
be somewhat limited because there’s no way to organize these documents 
into a file system.
If you plan to attach lots of documents to Sugar, check out SalesFolders by 
InvisibleCRM. Here’s a few of the things it does to make your life easier:
 
✓ Creates a desktop application that allows you to drag a document 
directly into Sugar.
 
✓ Lets you create a file structure for the documents you store in Sugar.
 
✓ Automatically synchronizes your new or changed documents between 
your desktop and Sugar.
 
✓ Allows you to save documents in Word or Excel directly into Sugar.
Being Alerted by SalesAlerts
Unlike many other CRM products, Sugar does not contain “pop-up” alarms 
that appear shortly before your scheduled activities. Enter SalesAlerts.
Using SalesAlerts, you can be notified of activities as well as changes that 
occur in other designated fields. For example, you might want to receive 
notification when a Leads record changes to an Accounts record, or of an 
upcoming event, such as a birthday or expected closing date.
SalesAlerts also includes a desktop application that further expands Sugar’s 
native functionality. Sales managers can opt to receive alerts for their sales 
force — or access the desktop application to see all their alerts in one central 
location. End users can use SalesAlerts to quickly search for information 
scattered throughout Sugar without having to go directly into Sugar to 
initiate the search.

W
e all learn differently. Some of you are visual learners and rely on 
documentation to help you. Others of you may take a more hands-on 
approach and prefer to tinker with a program as a way to learn. Still others of 
you require a bit more handholding, and prefer to have someone directly 
show you the ropes. I hope this chapter helps you find the answers to your 
sugary questions — no matter what your learning style!
Read this Book!
My editor advised me when I wrote my first For Dummies book that I was not 
writing the Great American novel — and that very few people would read my 
book from cover-to-cover. That said, I’m really hoping that eventually you will 
read the book from cover-to-cover.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Although this book comes complete with a cover in a very tasteful shade 
of yellow that may enhance your office décor, it’s not going to do you 
a whole lot of good sitting on your bookshelf. Feel free to use the Index 
(conveniently located in the back of the book) to help you find an answer 
in the flip of a page.
If you happen to be embarrassed to be seen reading a For Dummies title, try 
pasting the cover of your favorite computer magazine over the book — and 
remember just which Dummy will have the last laugh!
Visit the Help Menus
In addition to the information that I provide in this book, SugarCRM comes 
with a very good — and quite extensive — online Help system that supplies 
step-by-step instructions for just about any sweet feature that you might 
want to explore. For example, if you’re attempting to create a new Contacts 
record, clicking Help displays a listing of all the Contacts record’s fields and 
what they mean. If you’re configuring your e-mail account, clicking Help gives 
you step-by-step instructions for the configuration process.
You can access the Sugar context-sensitive online Help system by clicking 
the Help icon displayed in Figure 19-1. Help arrives in the shape of a new 
window.
 
Figure 19-1: 
The Sugar 
Help icon.
 
To make life even sweeter, the Help window gives you three options at the 
top of the window:
 
✓ Print: Click this option to create a hard copy of the Help window.
 
✓ Email: Choose this option if you want to send a link to the Help system 
or to one or twenty of your closest Sugar users.
 
✓ Bookmark this page: You can save the Help page to your Internet 
browser if you’d like a repeat performance sometime down the road.
Download a Bit of Documentation
A picture may be worth a thousand words but I’d rather have the thousand 
words when it comes to researching a problem. And way more than a 

325
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Become a Master Sugar Chef
thousand words are available to you on the SugarCRM Web site. Simply 
go to the Support & Training menu on Sugar’s Home page and choose 
Documentation.
The Documentation page breaks down the documentation into three sec-
tions: Enterprise, Professional, and Community Edition. Click the section that 
corresponds to your version and you’ll see a nice assortment of User Guides. 
And, as you see in Figure 19-2, additional tabs allow you easy access to the 
documentation from previous versions of Sugar.
You can choose to see the documentation in either HTML or PDF format; if 
you choose the PDF format, you have the option of either viewing or saving 
the document.
 
For those of you who might not be familiar with Adobe Reader, it includes a 
couple of really great searching tools that will prove helpful when looking for 
an answer to your question. In Reader, choose Edit➪Find to produce a simple 
search window that allows you to search by a single word or phrase. If that 
doesn’t provide what you’re looking for, choose Edit➪Search, which will give 
you more advanced search options.
 
Although I’m not an advocate of sacrificing more trees in the rain forest, at 
times you might find it easier to print the documentation — particularly if you 
want to give your entire office easy access to the manual. Choose File➪Print 
to print any of the PDF files. You might also consider printing on three-hole 
punched paper to make it easy to place into a binder.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Adopting a New Sugar Baby
I’ve spent the last ten years implementing CRM for small to mid-sized busi-
nesses, and I’ve learned that a CRM implementation is not something you 
enter into without plenty of prior planning.
Sugar designed the Sugar Adoption Program to help keep you organized 
during the CRM transition. The Sugar Adoption Program Web page features 
three important links:
 
✓ List of resources: Here’s where you find links to virtually every little 
detail to make your Sugar implementation painless — and then some. In 
addition to common sites, such as the Sugar Wiki, Documentation, 
Forum, and Training, you find links to a sample Intranet launch page 
that you can use to help transition your staff into using Sugar. There’s 
also a neat Adoption Checklist spreadsheet that can help you organize 
your implementation.
 
✓ Roles and Responsibilities: Everyone wants to claim credit for when 
things go right; no one, however, wants to take the blame for when 
things don’t go so right. Here’s where you see a clear description of the 
duties you assign to the members of your implementation team, from 
the IT manager to the database administrator.
 
✓ Sugar Adoption Checklist: Here’s where you find a list of the critical 
checkpoints of a CRM installation, as well as links to corresponding 
documentation.
 
 You can access the Sugar Adoption Program materials by clicking 
the Support and Training menu on the SugarCRM Web site and then 
choosing Sugar Adoption Program.
Attending Sugar University
Although it doesn’t offer a tree-lined campus and a great football team like 
my alma mater (Go, Gators!), the Sugar University offers a great curriculum 
of courses designed to increase your knowledge of SugarCRM at a very 
rapid pace. And, unlike other universities, 80 percent of the Sugar University 
content is free — as in no tuition!
You find Sugar University by choosing Support & Training on the SugarCRM 
Home page and then clicking Training. Sugar University offers several 
options:

327
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Become a Master Sugar Chef
 
✓ Online Library: Every university has a library, and Sugar U is no excep-
tion. Here’s where you find How Do I learning guides with step-by-step 
instructions for the most common tasks and Show Me videos for a visual 
guide to many of the main Sugar functions.
 
✓ Learning Session: Think of this as your course catalog because here’s 
where you find all kinds of classes. Many of the classes come in the form 
of free, pre-recorded Webinars that you can “attend” at your leisure. 
Others, although free, require prior registration. A few of the courses 
require “learning credits,” which either you purchase or they might be 
included with your Sugar subscription.
 
✓ Sugar University Offerings: Here’s where you can view all the Sugar 
training options — and, believe me, there are a bunch. In addition to the 
How Do I guides and Show Me videos mentioned earlier, you find links to 
hands-on workshops and classroom training.
Who knows? Maybe in a few years, there’ll be a Sugar University Alumni 
Association!
Sharing Sweet Words of Love
It amazes me to think of the vast amount of information that the Internet 
contains. Whether you have a medical ailment or you’re looking to purchase 
a new car, chances are good that the Internet will be one of your primary 
sources of information. SugarCRM has helped close the gap between users 
in various locations by creating a couple of sites that allow for virtual, inter-
active communication. Although you need to take some of the information 
found there with several grains of salt, these sites allow you to see what 
other users are thinking — and even post a few thoughts of your own.
Watching the Wiki
Although Wiki means “quick” in Hawaiian, wiki is more commonly used to 
describe a collaborative Web site that allows anyone to edit, delete, or 
modify informational content that has been placed on a Web site. There are 
actually two Sugar wikis — one for Support and one for Developers. And, 
because Sugar is Open Source software, Sugar users are constantly editing 
the wikis. You’ll find them to be a great source for issues that might not be 
covered with the more traditional learning materials.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You can find the Sugar wikis by selecting Support & Training from Sugar’s 
Web site and then choosing Wiki.
Thinking fondly of the Forums
In computer-speak, a forum is an online discussion group. In Sugar-speak, the 
Forums are a great way to post questions you might have about Sugar. 
Although the sweet folks at Sugar monitor the Forums, you often find that 
other users supply great answers.
You can get to the Sugar Forums by clicking the Forums link on the Sugar 
Home page. Here you find links to discussions on everything from general 
help to issues faced by Sugar developers.
Finding Bugs in the Sugar bowl
Software can be frustrating even for the most seasoned of users. You might 
spend hours trying to figure something out to no avail only to find that the 
fault lies not with something you are doing but rather in something that the 
software isn’t doing.
A software bug is an error or defect in your software that causes it not to 
work correctly. I’ve heard the term originated years ago when a couple of 
moths wreaked major havoc when they were French-fried in a super 
computer. Personally, I think the term originated because bugs can really 
bug you!
In any event, Sugar has a Web page devoted to those annoying insects. 
You can access that buggy Web site by going to www.sugarcrm.com/
crm/sugarbugs.html. You can submit any bugs that you might stumble 
across — and discover what is bugging other Sugar users!
Taking a Honeymoon
SugarCRM holds a number of conferences designed to let Sugar end-users 
learn first-hand about new features that might be coming down the Turnpike 
as well as to achieve an even higher mastery of their current version of Sugar. 
You can find the exact date and location of these events by clicking About Us 
and then choosing Events from www.sugarcrm.com.

329
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Become a Master Sugar Chef
Taking a trip to Silicon Valley
The SugarCRM headquarters is located in the heart of Silicon Valley in 
Cupertino, California. This is where the folks at Sugar hold their yearly bash, 
SugarCon. In keeping with the spirit of Open Source software, SugarCon is 
open to vendors, consultants, end-users, and prospects. I guess a lot of 
people are looking for an excuse to visit California in February!
The three-day event features a number of simultaneous learning tracks as 
well as the opportunity to network with other Sugar users. Participants can 
select and attend the tracks that they find the most useful. And, from what 
my sources tell me, a good time is had by all!
Coming soon to a location near you
If you can’t make the trip out to sunny California, you might want to check 
out CRM Acceleration. CRM Acceleration events take place virtually all over 
the world and are designed to help companies understand and succeed with 
SugarCRM. These one-day workshops include sessions on marketing, sales, 
and customer support and are geared towards both existing and potential 
Sugar users.
Developing a Love for 
the Developers Page
Not content with merely using Sugar, developers are a weird bunch of people 
who want to change Sugar to take it to its next level. Chapter 15 shows you 
how to make modifications from within Sugar, and Chapter 18 shows you 
some of the neat products that some SugarCRM users have developed to 
work with Sugar. However, if you want to be one of those people that develop 
neat products yourself, then you want to visit the Sugar Developers Web site. 
You can access the site by clicking Developers from the SugarCRM Web site.
If you’re a developer, you can find a wealth of information on the Sugar 
Developers Web site, including:

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ A blog.
 
✓ Podcasts that you can download to have with you where your travels 
may take you.
 
✓ Help on more advanced areas including Oracle, PHP, Apache, and IIS.
 
✓ A toolbox containing snippets of code, tutorials, documentation, and 
other tools of interest to developers.
 
✓ Links to chat sites and developer user groups.
Using a Portal Instead of a Door
I often wonder how many new words and phrases have been added to the 
dictionary since the advent of the computer. Interestingly enough, Sugar 
must have a great vocabulary because they’ve incorporated so many of these 
new concepts into their software and Web site. Unfortunately, because the 
Sugar Web site holds so much information, you might find it a bit difficult to 
navigate. Enter your portal.
A portal is a Web site or service that offers all kinds of resources and 
services. In the case of SugarCRM, your portal offers you links to everything 
from support resources and news about upcoming classes to answers to 
your frequently asked questions.
You can access your personalized support portal in two ways:
 
✓ Click Admin from your SugarCRM Home page and then choose Sugar 
Support Portal in the Sugar Network subpanel of the Administration 
Home page.
 
✓ Click Support & Training from the SugarCRM Web site and choose 
Support Portal.
You need to login to the portal if you haven’t done so already. If this is your 
first time logging in, you’ll be asked to provide a username and password.
If you’re using the Professional or Enterprise version of SugarCRM, you can 
activate a more specialized version of the Support Portal (shown in Figure 
19-3) that will allow you to submit support questions to the technical support 
staff directly from your Web site.

Portal.
 
Hire a Consultant
Many years ago, I decided to wallpaper my living room. I chose very expen-
sive (and thin!) paper. Not wanting to drip paste on my carpet, I set up a table 
in my garage for the pasting process, smeared on the paste, and carted it into 
the dining room. Those of you who have ever tried their luck at wallpapering 
can imagine the results. For the rest of you, picture a mummy wrapped in a 
lovely print and you’ll get the drift. After I removed the paper and paste from 
various parts of my anatomy, I sheepishly called in an expert. Mr. Expert gave 
me a few strange looks, muttered about the table in the garage, and had my 
dining room done in no time.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You might find yourself in a similar situation when learning Sugar. Perhaps 
you don’t have the time — or patience — to attend a class or read documen-
tation. Maybe you have specific questions about functionality as it applies to 
your business. For whatever reason, you might want to hire an expert to help 
you with some — or all — of your installation.
SugarCRM Partners are folks who earn their living helping folks implement 
Sugar. These partners come in three flavors (gold, silver, and bronze) 
depending on how large an ad the consultant wants to appear on Sugar’s 
website and how much money they want to commit to be listed as a partner. 
You can find a complete listing of SugarCRM Partners at www.sugarcrm.
com/crm/partners/partnerfinder.html.
