Change a Door Handle
From "Ask DIY"
episode ADI-202 -- More Projects Â»
Even beginners can 
install a new doorknob 
with a power drill and 
slot screwdriver.

Q: A couple of doorknobs in my house have seen better days. Can I easily 
replace them?
A: (Brad Staggs, Ask DIY Home Repair Expert) Sure. It's a very simple 
project. Even if there's nothing wrong with your doorknob, you might want 
to upgrade to one that's easier for people with disabilities to open. Before 
you buy a doorknob, though, take off the old one and take it to the store 
for comparison. Also make sure you know whether your doorknob goes on 
the right or left side of the door. To remove the old knob and install the 
new, follow these steps. 
Materials:
Lock set with key and screws
Flathead or slot screwdriver 
Power drill
Safety glasses
1.  The toughest part is getting the old doorknob off. If your doorknob 
has screws on the cover plates, remove those to loosen the old 
knob. If not, look for a slot on the side of the handle that has a 
little piece of metal sticking out. Then use the key from the new 
doorknob to push in on the metal -- that will make the doorknob 
pop loose (figure A). 
2.  Pull off the doorknob to reveal the plate below. Look for a slot in 
the plate along the seam where it butts against the door. Wedge a 
slot (also known as flathead) screwdriver in the slot and then give 
the plate a half twist to pop it off. 
3.  With plate removed, you'll see the screws you should remove with 
a power drill (figure B).

drill. 
4.  Remove the old latch by taking out the screws with a power drill or 
screwdriver (figure C). 
5.  Screw the new latch in, setting the screws by hand first and then 
tightening them with a power drill. 
6.  Place the knobs themselves, set the screws by hand, and finish by drilling. Don't overtighten the 
screws or you'll bind the doorknob. 
7.  Test the key and make sure the door locks properly. 
More Questions for Brad:
Q: I'm painting the trim around my doors. Would it be easier with the doors off the hinges? How do I 
remove them? 
A: It's a whole lot easier to paint with your doors off the hinges, and you should take your doorknobs off, 
too. There's a hinge pin running through the center of the hinge, which you should remove with an old 
screwdriver. Take all three hinges off and then carefully remove the door.
Q: My kids have caused damage by slamming the doorknob on the wall. How can I prevent this?
A: There are actually a couple of solutions. Try one of those springy doorstops that screw into the 
baseboard of the wall and keep the door from opening all the way and hitting the wall. There are also 
doorstop contraptions that attach to the top of the hinge pin, for places where you don't have a 
baseboard on the wall the door is hitting.
Q: My bedroom door is hard to close. I have to really slam it. Any suggestions for solving this problem?
A: That means the door is either too wide for the door opening itself, in which case you need to plane it, 
or that the latch plate is sticking out too far. Or it could mean that the strike plate needs to be adjusted.
