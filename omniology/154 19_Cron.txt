Cron

The cron service allows us to schedule
commands to run at regular intervals like:
- Every 30 minutes
- Every day at midnight
- Every 1st of the month
- Every December 15th
Cron

To set up a cron job, we need to edit the
crontab configuration file.  Rather than
edit the files directly, it's best to use the
crontab -e command.
